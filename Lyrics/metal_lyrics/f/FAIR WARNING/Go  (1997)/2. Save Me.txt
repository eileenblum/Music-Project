Like the rivers that don't know
Where they're flowing
Like the free birds who don't care
Where they're going
It's been a long time I lost control
Hear the cry of a left alone soul

For the first time in a many years
I'm listening
To the words that all the wise man
Have been saying
All these answers they all might be true
But give me reason to start something new

Ooh this lonely road
We're riding for much too long
Longing and searching we keep going on
Through the night

Come save me tonight
Be my guiding light
In these times of despair
Take the chance if you dare

Come save me tonight
And walk by my side
Be the stars be the sun
And be my kingdom come
Come save me tonight
Come and save me tonight

There are times it's really hard
To hide emotion
But believe me girl this truly is devotion
Maybe someday all chains will be gone
Maybe someday we'll walk in the sun

Come a time when rivers know
Why they are flowing
Come a time when free birds know
Where they are going
Don't you think that solution is near
Say the one word that I want to hear

Ooh this lonely road
We're riding for much too long
Longing and searching we keep going on
Through the night

Come save me tonight
Be my guiding light
In these times of despair
Take the chance if you dare

Come save me tonight
And walk by my side
Be the stars be the sun
And be my kingdom come
Ooh come save me tonight
Tonight

Come save me tonight
Be my guiding light
In these times of despair
Take the chance if you dare

Come save me tonight
And walk by my side
Be the stars be the sun
And be my kingdom come
Come save me tonight
Save me, tonight...
