The morning light has left you, there's no sign where to go
You've lost your way to Eden but you can't let it show
Somewhere in the distance the vision fades away
Of where your life is leading of all the better ways

In the night you find yourself alone

Remember when you started everything was clear
The road that lay before you, solution seemed so near
Then you got elected, you still can hear the cheers
Someone who will save us to take away the tears

In the night you find yourself alone
Tell me why do you live a lie
You are acting blind

Tell me what did you find now you're out in the cold
Does your promise still hold
And what did you do, you find yourself telling lies
While a million hungry eyes are watching you

Some men would do anything to keep their golden crown
Are you really one of them, are you laughing at the crowd?
You close your eyes to all the things you once believed were true
And say I would forgive you if I would wear your shoes

In the night you find yourself alone
Tell me why do you live a lie
You are acting blind

Tell me what did you find now you're out in the cold
Does your promise still hold
And what did you do, you find yourself telling lies
While a million hungry eyes are watching you

[Repeat chorus]
