Your face in the mirror - the words that you say
They echo in circles through my mind

The streets of the city - lie empty and grey
They're leading to nowhere, Â´cause now we pay the prize

It's too late - for the dreams, we had in mind
We learned it the hard way - but now we realize

t's too late for love -
Girl, don't you see, we're running out of time
It's too late for love
We lost it to the night
A hand full of memories - the truth that remains
The voice in our hearts - it's never wrong

A new day is dawning - it's calling our names
Seems love is a wanderer - and now it's moving on
It's too late - for the dreams we had in mind
We closed our eyes, girl - but now we can't deny

It's too late for love -
Girl, don't you see, we're running out of time
It's too late for love
We lost it to the night

It's too late for love -
Girl, don't you see, we're running out of time
It's too late for love
We lost it to the night

We lost it to the nights
