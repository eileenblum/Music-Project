Blinding light on the rooftops
Summerwind in your hair
Just a breeze of the autumn
Rising up through the air

Up ahead in the distance
Dusk is falling so far
And the mist's rolling in from the seaside
Like a vision, that destined to last

You got to believe â
This hour is more than a moment in time
It's now that you see â
A whisper from heaven has shown you tonight
The heart of the summer

Walking out at the coastline
Turning tide on the shore
Is the fire still burning
Do you simply don't care anymore

You got to believe â
This hour is more than a moment in time
It's now that you see â
A whisper from heaven has shown you tonight
The heart of the summer

The night is breaking â change is going on
Deep down in your mind
The dreams you wished for â
Fading in the past There's nothing left behind
Nothing has remained tonight

You got to believe â
This hour is more than a moment an time
It's now that you see â
A whisper from heaven has shown you tonight
The heart of the summer
