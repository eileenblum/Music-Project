You know I'll run to you when this world made me all too blue
When the pain just gets too much
You keep me save and warm, give me shelter from the storm
When I need a tender touch

Crying on your shoulder I made it out alive
You're the one to catch me, helped me to survive

You talk to the stars an the moon
Smile at me, shine 'till my dark night is through
Your smile â can take away all my fears
When you're by my side gone is the pain and the tears

The one who can't decide caught in many doubts and pride
Is a man who looks like me
You know I have to try and even if you don't know why
You're the only one to see

Crying on your shoulder I made it out alive
You're the one to catch me, helped me to survive

You talk to the stars an the moon
Smile at me, shine 'till my dark night is through
Your smile â can take away all my fears
When you're by my side gone is the pain and the tears

Crying on your shoulder I made it out alive
You're the one to catch me, helped me to survive
