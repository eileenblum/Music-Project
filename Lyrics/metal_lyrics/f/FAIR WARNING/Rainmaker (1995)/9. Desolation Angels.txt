Lost in a dream a fantasy
Born in the wasteland of the night

Way down the coastline of reality
Visions of terror came alive

Faces of stone haunting my soul
Eyes full of mad desire
Voices of pain desperate and cold
Trapped in a world of lies

Desolation angels desolation angels

Washed to the shores of nowhereland
They are the castaways of life
Caught in the darkness, they once tried to end
Bound to be phantoms of the night

But somewhere out there there's still a world
They left it long behind
Somewhere they hope there's still a chance
Just when the time is right

Desolation angels desolation angels

From the gates of isolation
To the fields of agony
Through the deserts of frustration
To the edge of sanity

Cast in the dark a blazing light
Gave me direction just in time
Saved from the circles of mad delight
Pity and sorrow on my mind

Desolation angels desolation angels
