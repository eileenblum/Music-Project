A girl stands waiting at the bus stop
Watching the traffic flowing by
Way down the street there's children's laughter
I still can hear it, as it echoes in the night â
And the rain falls

Old man comes staggering down the sidewalk
Picks up a dollar he just found
He sure looks homeless, as he stand there
The wind is rising as I'm listening to the sound â
Of the rain fall

Flow, flow â from the edge of time
To cool my heart and make me see
Life's sent a blessing to the lonely ones tonight
And I only wish, I could
Be, what I shall be â
And the rain falls

Night's fallen gently on the city
Silence is rising from the streets
Out on the stream â a lost umbrella
I watch it dancing to the secret melody â
Of the rain fall

Flow, flow â from the edge of time
To cool my heart and make me see
Life's sent a blessing to the lonely ones tonight
And I only wish, I could
Be, what I shall be
And the rain falls

And the rain falls

Flow, flow â from the edge of time
And the rain falls
And the rain falls
