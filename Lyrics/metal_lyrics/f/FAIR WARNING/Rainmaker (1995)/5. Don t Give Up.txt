So here you go again, all on your own
The roads you used to know
Turned into deserted land
Lost in your memories
A place called home
It's now you realize
All your hope was build on sand

When life's got you down
Then life can bring you rught up
Cause no one can steal your dreams

Don't give up
Whatever may come
There still shines a light
Keep your dreams
When the walls come tumbling down
Just stand up and fight

Sure there've been better days
For you and me
But you've made up your mind
To walk alone on lonely streets
Though sadness fills my heart
Since you've been gone
May all your dreams come true
May you trust the ones you meet

When life's got you down
Then life can bring you right up
'Cause no one can steel your dreams

Don't give up
Whatever may come
There still shines a light
Keep your dreams
When the walls come tumbling down
Just stand up and fight

When life's got you down
Then life can bring you right up
'Cause no one can steal your dreams

No one can steal your dreams
I said no one can steal your dreams
Oh ...no...
Keep them
You have to keep them
Cause there still shines a light
So stand up and fight
And fight, and fight
So don't give up
Never give up
So don't give up

Don't give up
Never give up
Don't give up
Keep your dreams
Keep your dreams
Try, try, try...
