The wind is whispering to the rising moon
Through the cool of the night
Puts a spell on my heart and it beats like a drum

'Cause now I know, girl it was much too soon
That we gave up the fight
And the memories return 'till the morning has come

And I roam through the night
With a secret that I'm holding inside

Pictures of love still in my head
When the morning breakes
They keep coming back, whatever I do
Pictures of you

The hours go by just like movie scenes
As I'm making my way
Like a traveller in time and it seems so unreal

Cause the world, that I see
Is just a mirror of my own fantasy

Pictures of love still in my head
When the morning breakes
They keep coming back, whatever I do
Pictures of you Pictures of you

Pictures of love still in my head
When the morning breakes
They keep coming back, whatever I do

Pictures of times, when we were close
Tell me what it takes
To unchain my heart 'cause I know, it's through
Pictures of you
