Danny's got a job straight from nine to five
Saving all he earns for a better life
Friday he went out gambling hall
Laid it on the line and he blew it all

He used to call on his stream of luck
Just had the magic touch
He tried too hard and it all went wrong
It was a touch too much

Thunder, lightning what you wanna do
Giving up just halfway to the top
Thunder, lightning you can make it thorough
There's one way up

Lonely is the night
When you're down and out
Trying to find a way just to work it out

Just takes a man with a burning heart
Out in the cold of night
No use to cry and look back in tears
The time has come to fight

Thunder, lightning what you wanna do
Giving up just halfway to the top
Thunder, lightning you can make it thorough
There's one way up

Once you were tall and strong
But now these days are gone
You take it hard, it's plain to see
The tides of fate, they'll turn
One day you're back again
That's just the way it's got to be

[Repeat chorus]
