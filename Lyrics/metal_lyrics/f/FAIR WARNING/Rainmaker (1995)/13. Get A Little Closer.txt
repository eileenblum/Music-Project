When the going gets tough and you're wasted and tired
Give yourself another chance for what you wanna do

You wanna give up but you better think twice
You're the only one in charge to find out what is true

There's something in your eyes, girl
It's just not meant to die
It takes away your sleep at night
And opens up your eyes

Get a little closer get a little tough
Try a little harder what you're dreaming of
You can be a fighter talking ain't enough
Get a little closer in the name of love

You might call me a fool I don't care about that
You can call me anything but what you wanna do?

Cause maybe you're wrong You know, you never can bet
You can turn it either way the choice is up to you

There's something on your mind, girl
It just won't go away
It takes away your sleep at night
Growing day by day

Get a little closer get a little tough
Try a little harder what you're dreaming of
You can be a fighter talking ain't enough
Get a little closer in the name of love

There's something in your eyes, girl
It's just not meant to die
It takes away your sleep at night
And opens up your eyes

Just find out who you are, girl
And what you're meant to be
The time is on your side, my friend
And one day you'll break free

Get a little closer get a little tough
Try a little harder what you're dreaming of
You can be a fighter talking ain't enough 
Get a little closer in the name of love
