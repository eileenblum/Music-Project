Girl, I've been lonely
I've been lost in the shadows
I found my way a thousand times

But this time it's different
Â´Cause my heart's been so empty
There's desperation on my mind

I sailed the ocean - now my ships wrecked at the shore
The stars I followed - I can't see them anymore

Angel of the dawn - night is coming on
WonÂ´t you heal me, save my soul
Open up my heart - take me through the dark
'Cause tonight, I cry - for my soul

You know, I've been loving
I've been hurting and healing
The ways of life - I've seen a few

But time is a teacher
And I fear that I'm changing
Now I'm just longing to be true

The road I travelled - now itÂ´s washed into the sea
The tide is rising - wonÂ´t you come and set me free&gt;

Angel of the dawn - night is coming on
WonÂ´t you heal me, save my soul
Open up my heart - take me through the dark
'Cause tonight, I cry - for my soul
