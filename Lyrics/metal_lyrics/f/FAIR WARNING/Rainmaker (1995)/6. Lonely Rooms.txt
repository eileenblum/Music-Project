These memories, they still come back sometimes
Keeping me awake late at night
A restless soul, that's what I'm right now
Trying to find the way back to the light

So many times I spent the nights alone
Wishing you were here right by my side
The words to say just wonÂ´t come to my mouth
And I can't help you're thinking that's my pride

Will it get any better
Will the feeling last for the rest of my days?

Here I am - all on my own in these lonely rooms
Here I am - waiting for a message from you
And I wait - waiting for a message that never comes
'Cause the last chance that we had - we didn't take it

Lost summer nights that I wish to forget
On my own now I have to survive
And though I know you wonÂ´t come back some day
It's these foolish thoughts that keep my heart alive

Will it get any better
Will this feeling last for the rest of my days?

Here I am - all on my own in these lonely rooms
Here I am - waiting for a message from you
And I wait - waiting for a message that never comes
'Cause the last chance that we had - we didn't take it
