It only seems like yesterday -
You broke the spell and turned away
The darkness of the night.
Your smile just like the morning sun -
It healed the pain I felt so long
Dried all the tears I cried.

One look into your eyes -
It's like rising with the wind
One moment changed my life -
It's love I'm breathing in

I dream -
And nothing breaks the silence that I feel
The love I used to wish for - now it's real
You turn it on and break the spell -
I know it's true, I know it's true -
I dream...

A castaway out in the storm -
In search for love and far from home
That's all I used to be.
But then you came into my life -
To open up my blinded eyes
Your love it set me free.

When silent is the night -
I'm driving with the wind
No matter what I try -
It's love I'm breathing in

I dream -
And nothing breaks the silence that I feel
The love I used to wish for - now it's real
You turn it on and break the spell -
I know it's true, I know it's true -
I dream - I dream...
