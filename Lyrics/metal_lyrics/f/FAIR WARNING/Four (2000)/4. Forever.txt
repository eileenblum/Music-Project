Another sleepless night
Paradise drifts out of sight
You find yourself on a street to nowhere

And you found talk is cheap
And promises not made to keep
You can't go on and pretend you don't care

By now you realize
Change's a faithful guide
And it will take yoi thru flood tide
(Come let your sun rise)

Forever we will change
Forever we will learn
As long as time turns
As long as love burns
Forever

Don't mind to rearrange
For you never can return
To these shores to save
From all stormy waves
Forever

And hate won't take control
Do closely listen to your soul
No rest no sleep till the answer is near

You chase the rainbows end
A virtue you may will defend
'Cause each day will take you to a new frontier

By now you realize
Change's a faithful guide
And it will take yoi thru flood tide
(Come let your sun rise)

Forever we will change
Forever we will learn
As long as time turns
As long as love burns
Forever

Don't mind to rearrange
For you never can return
To these shores to save
From all stormy waves
Forever
