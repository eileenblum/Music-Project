Sometimes I'm fightin' with myself -
And take it everywhere I go
Nothin' really matters much -
Gets harder not to show
There is no use in complaining -
When it's others who decide
Take it as a given fact -
Then lost is wrong or right

It is hard to believe in -
A vision bound to fail
Every road leadin' nowhere -
Takes your dream away

Let me find my way -
No longer I can stay
Let me find my way -
Each and every single day
And luck may shine -
On everything you do
May it shine over you

And it's clearer now to see -
That this ain't no way to win
For much too long this story goes -
The light is gettin' dim
And all the high goals that we had -
Call them precious memories
Up in smoke they went this time -
But someday you will see

It is hard to believe in -
A vision bound to fail
Every road leadin' nowhere -
Takes your dream away

Let me find my way -
No longer I can stay
Let me find my way -
Each and every single day
And luck may shine -
On everything you do
May it shine over you
