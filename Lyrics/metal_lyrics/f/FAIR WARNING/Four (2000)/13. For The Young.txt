May every single star shine down to guide you
For you may never fail to find your way
May the words you hear prove to be true
Make the truth the judge for what you say

May every single day see hope and new dreams
And be the night alight with bright moonbeams
And should times get rough wait patiently
Trust your heart and you'll find liberty

May guardian angels always be by your side
May all the loose ends down the line unite
May your heart stay pure throughout the fight
See the line dividing wrong from right

May all your visions be as clear as daylight
Like rivers love may safely find your sea
May your mind be strong so you can face the night
To defy all lies and agony

And may I never see you crying sad tears
And may you never follow false tongued seers
May the ones you love see honesty
Find yourself and you will hold the key
