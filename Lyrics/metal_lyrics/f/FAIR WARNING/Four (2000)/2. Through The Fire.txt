As the night's coming slowly -
In endless space and time
I can feel through the silence -
There's something out of line
There's a force in the distance -
That pulls me on too strong
To a hole in the system -
I can't resist for long

Through the oceans - of the night
Distant starlight - shining bright
Lost in silence - my fuel's down -
Getting low
I can't get on - I can't get back -
There's just one way to go

Through the fire - through the fire -
Through the fire - through the fire -

In the heart of the moment -
I feel my heartbeat rise
As a stargate to heaven -
Unfolds before my eyes
There's a light in the distance -
I now I can't be late
If you just could excuse me -
I must be on my way

Through the oceans - of the night
Distant starlight - shining bright
Out from nowhere - a thunder -
Blinding blow
I can't get on - I can't get back -
There's just one way to go

Through the fire - through the fire -
Take me higher - through the fire -

Through the fire - through the fire...
