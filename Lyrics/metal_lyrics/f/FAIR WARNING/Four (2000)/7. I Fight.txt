Riots on the misty roads of night
Faces carved in ignorance and pride

Looking for another way
Trouble's down the street
The sky's on fire - I'm moving on
I got to face the heat

I fight - when silence breaks at night
I fight - no mercy in these eyes
And if my love is strong enough,
I got to break this pride -
I fight - I fight...

Castles built on anger and desire
Waymarks in a no man's land on fire

Looking for a different life
Longing for the day
And all I know's - I must get out
I got to find my way

I fight - when silence breaks at night
I fight - no mercy in these eyes
And if my love is strong enough,
I got to break this pride -
I fight - I fight...
