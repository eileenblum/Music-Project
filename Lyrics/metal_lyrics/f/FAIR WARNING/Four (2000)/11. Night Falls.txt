Shadows in the distance -
Dreamy days long gone
I can see them rising -
To guide the setting sun
From the edge of nowhere -
As I'm waiting for their call
When the night falls

Walking by the ocean -
Driving with the wind
I can see you movin' -
To watch the tide come in
Reaching out from nowhere -
As I'm waiting for your call
Longing for the moment -
When the night begins to fall

When the night falls -
I can see you in my dreams
And the distance's coming closer -
'Til your love has wraped me in
And the more my eyes can see -
Just the more my heart can find
When the silence meets the sorrow -
There's a dream deep in my mind
When the night falls

Just a fading moment -
Rising from the dusk
Coming on so slowly -
And moving by so fast
Like a true emotion -
'Til there's nothing left at all
Leaving just a memory -
'Til the night begins to fall

When the night falls -
I can see you in my dreams
And the distance's coming closer -
'Til your love has wraped me in
And the more my eyes can see -
Just the more my heart can find
When the silence meets the sorrow -
There's a dream deep in my mind
When the night falls

When the night falls
.....
There's a dream deep in my mind

When the night falls -
When the night falls -
When the night falls...
