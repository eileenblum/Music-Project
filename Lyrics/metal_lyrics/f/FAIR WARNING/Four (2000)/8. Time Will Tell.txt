A ring of ice - around you heart
You lost control - right to the dark
And in your dreams - the night comes down
The power that you wanted -
It turned your heart to stone

Hey look at you - so full of doubt
Those wasted years - you see them now
And deep inside - the prize is due
You're bound to pay it back now -
And no one else can do

For now - it's suddenly you find
The road you left behind you -
It's only in your mind
And now - you realize the truth
There's nothing left inside you -
And nothing left to loose

Time will tell - Only time will tell

A burning heart - that went astray
A searching mind - who lost the way
And looking back - you're torn apart
Your life it was so easy -
And now it seems so hard

For now - a lonely road you go
I still can hear your laughter -
Little did you know

Time will tell - Only time will tell

Time will tell - Only time will tell...
Only time will tell - Only time will -
Time will tell...
