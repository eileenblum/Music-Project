The night is cold and you're out in the city
Down in the dark where the streets got no name
You lost your love in the heat of the moment
She's out of sight and you're searching in vain

The eyes of a thousand strangers
They're watching your heart so low
Your life like a silent movie
And no one to save you from just letting go
Why don't you wait - wait for a moment
Your heart is strong - but you sure had enough
Why don't you wait - wait for a moment
Did nobody tell you it's tough - when it's love

Deep in the heart of the night turning circles
You're waking up to the eye of the storm
No use to cry when the odds are against you
Get up and fight to just prove them wrong

The eyes of a thousand angels
They're guiding your heart tonight
And out in that misty morning
There's somebody waiting to stand by your side

Why don't you wait - wait for a moment
Your heart is strong - but you sure had enough
Why don't you wait - wait for a moment
Did nobody tell you it's tough - when it's love...

The eyes of a thousand dreamers
They're guarding your dreams for you
But if you won't start believing
You never will see when your dream's coming true

Why don't you wait - wait for a moment
Your heart is strong - but you sure had enough
Why don't you wait - wait for a moment
Did nobody tell you it's tough - when it's love
When it's love - love will find a way
When it's love...
Did nobody tell you it's tough - when it's love...
