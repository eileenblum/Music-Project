Tired of waiting - of waisting time
You wipe the sorrow out of your eyes
The spell is gone -
That led your life astray

The distant mountains -
You see them shine
Driving rainbows into the sky
And now you feel -
You've cast your chains away

Just don't look back -
To what went wrong
It's just the past - and now it's gone
Gone, babe -

Look inside these eyes of love
See your dreams and don't give up
Tonight I'm yours -
Tomorrow I'm on my way

I ride the rainbows - touch the sky
Know all the secrets you must find
And deep inside -
You know I'll guide your way

Just don't look back -
To what went wrong
It's just the past - and now it's gone
It's gone, man -

Look inside these eyes of love
See your dreams and don't give up
Tonight I'm yours -
Tomorrow I'm on my way

Look inside these eyes of love
See your dreams and don't give up
Trust your heart -
Don't waste this life away

Reach out to the open sky
Spread your wings and learn to fly
Tonight I'm yours -
Tomorrow you're on your way...
