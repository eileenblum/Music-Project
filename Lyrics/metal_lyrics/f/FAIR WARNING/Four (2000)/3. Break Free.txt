Cool and misty morning -
Fall's come silently
Another golden summer has gone by

You wake up like a dreamer -
To what your life could be
A prisoner of ambition -
But now you can't deny

The days of your life -
They're slipping away
And now it ain't so easy -
To waste another day

Break free - on the wings of tomorrow
Find your dream in the tears of this night
Break free - from the chains of your sorrow
Open your eyes - saving your soul, this time

Addicted to the fast life -
You never seemed to care
'Bout where the open road would lead you to

Those glory days are over -
And sure you had your share
But now it just means nothing-
And nothing just won't do

The call of your heart -
You pushed it down low
But now you feel it rising -
Come on and let it show

Break free - on the wings of tomorrow
Find your dream in the tears of this night
Break free - from the chains of your sorrow
Open your eyes - saving your soul, this time

Why don't you Break free...
