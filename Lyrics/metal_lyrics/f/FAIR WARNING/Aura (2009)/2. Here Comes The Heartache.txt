Out in the night the mistery's waiting
I feel it rising from the dark
Tearing apart the curtain of the night

I'm on my way, there's no mistaking
But there's a pain deep in my heart
Now I can feel my sorrow come alive

And the pain creeps down my spine
To the memories left behind

Here comes the heartache - why did I lose her
The mystery's cast a spell onto this life
Bearing the heartache - until I've found her to survive

Out in the dark the wind is whaling
I see my chances rise and fall
There ain't no use to hang on to a dream

But the pain creeps down my spine
To the memories lost in time

Here comes the heartache - why did I lose her
The mystery's cast a spell onto this life
Bearing the heartache - until I've found her to survive

[Solo]

But the pain creeps down my spine
To the memories lost in time

Here comes the heartache - why did I lose her
The mystery's cast a spell onto this life
Bearing the heartache - until I've found her to survive

To survive
