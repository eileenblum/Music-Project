You learned your lesson
And you learned it well
Don't look back don't look back

It's been a long way
Now it's hard to tell
Why you don't and never will

Talk of the days when love went away
Hold emotions at bay
Not much left of high aims
You know how it feels to go up in flames

Now you're telling yourself
Rise from the ashes a new day's dawning
What if mercy ain't blessed
Ashes to ashes the past is calling
Ashes to ashes locked out of eden

Don't count on me
For some man might heed no golden rule
Don't count on me
I'm not here to be playing your fool

You fought the good fight
And it turned out wrong
Don't look back don't look back

You asked for nothing
Now there's nothing left
And you don't ask for more

Not much left of high aims
You know how it feels to go up in flames

Now you're telling yourself
Rise from the ashes a new day's dawning
What if mercy ain'y blessed
Ashes to ashes locked out of eden

Don't count on me
For some man might heed no golden rule
Don't count on me
I'm not here to be playing your fool

The truth just does not taste too sweet
So kiss your past farewell
For live it rips you off and cheats
And leaves you with the ashes
