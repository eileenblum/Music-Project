I see you smile - such a silent smile
A bittersweet emotion -
From deep inside your eyes

And sometimes in the night -
As you whisper in your sleep
You reach out like you used to
And then it cuts so deep

For the love that I am sending -
Now it's drifting with the wind
And the faith I'm still pretending -
It's a fight my heart can't win

Just tell me I'm wrong -
Just tell me this love ain't gonna die
Just tell me I'm wrong -
Whatever you need I'll make it right
Just don't keep me hanging on, girl -
To a dream your heart can't find
Don't you know - it's breaking mine

I roam the streets -
Trying to read your mind
A drifter going nowhere -
For now these eyes are blind

But somewhere in that night -
There's a dream that drives me on
No matter what it takes now -
'Cause still it seems so strong

But the love that I am sending -
Now it's drifting with the wind
And the doubts they're never ending -
It's a fight my heart can't win

Just tell me I'm wrong -
Just tell me this love ain't gonna die
Just tell me I'm wrong -
Whatever it takes I'm gonna try
Just don't keep me hanging on, girl -
To a dream your heart can't find
Don't you know - it's breaking mine

Just tell me I'm wrong -
Just tell me this love ain't gonna die
Just tell me I'm wrong -
Whatever you need I'll make it right
Just don't keep me hanging on, girl -
To a dream your heart can't find
Don't you know - it's breaking mine
