A quarter to three - as the wind's rattling down at the door
She's lying awake
Just like so many hours before

And out there a grey day will dawn - and somehow the night's gone by
It seems she lost count of the sad days
That make up her life.

Hey girl, don't you cry - time is on your side
Deep in your heart - love just might take a while
Hey girl, don't you know - you're strong and beautiful when you smile

Rain's pouring down - as she's making her way cross the square
There's faces she knows - but it seems as if no one would care

And sometimes at night when she's home - and all of her dreams fly by
It seems as if nothing will change
'Til the day that she dies

[2x]
Hey girl, don't you cry - time is on your side
Trust in your heart - there's so many ways to try
Hey girl, don't you know - you're strong and beautiful
When you smile - when you smile
