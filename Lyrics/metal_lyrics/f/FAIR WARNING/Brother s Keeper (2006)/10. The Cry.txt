Silence is rising - from the burning shadows
Darkness has fallen - but I just can't stay
I wish you could see me - as I roam these meadows
I wish you could reach out - for I'm on my way

Is somebody out there - sharing this pain inside?
I know, I must fight it -
But sometimes I just can't hide - I cry

Send me a rainbow - right through the darkness
Drop me a lifeline - straight to my heart
Lay out a whisper - into the silence
I cry, I cry - the cry of my heart.

Soldiers of fortune - as the wind is rising
Selling illusions - but I turn away
I wish I could reach out - to those lost horizons
But who knows the bargain - and the prize they pay

Is somebody out there - feeling this pain inside?
I know, I can bare it -
But sometimes I just can't hide - I cry

Send me a rainbow - right through the darkness
Drop me a lifeline - straight to my heart
Lay out a whisper - into the silence
I cry, I cry - the call of my heart

[Solo]

Send me a rainbow - right through the darkness
Drop me a lifeline - straight to my heart
Lay out a whisper - into the silence
I cry, I cry - the call of my heart

Send me a rainbow - right through the darkness ...
