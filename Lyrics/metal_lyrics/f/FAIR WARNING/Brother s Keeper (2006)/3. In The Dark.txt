Somewhere in the city - fear inside your eyes
Don't know where you're going, trapped in your disguise
You rose to fame so easy
But somewhere in this night you're gonna fall.

Calling me a dreamer, how was I to know
The dark was gonna get you, you never let it show
But some day from the distance, the truth, it dawned on you
They trapped you, there was nothing you could do

Just look at you now, tracking your way from the start
You're caught in delusion, under the spell of the dark
And somewhere within, your soul's crying out to your heart
In the dark, in the dark.

Roaming in the twilight, hiding from the day
Soon they'll gonna get you - and then you gotta pay
And captured in the darkness - you'll know you've lived a lie
An outcast 'til the day you're gonna die

Just look at you now, tracking your way from the start
You're caught in delusion, under the spell of the dark
And somewhere within, your soul's crying out to your heart
Through the dark, through the dark.

[Solo]

Somewhere in the city - a man who's lost his smile
Just waiting for the day he's gonna die

Just look at you now, tracking your way from the start
You're caught in delusion, under the spell of the dark
And somewhere within, your soul's crying out to your heart
From the dark, from the dark...
