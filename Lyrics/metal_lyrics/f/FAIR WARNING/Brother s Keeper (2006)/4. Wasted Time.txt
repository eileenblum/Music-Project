Remember better times - you told me 'don't think twice'
'We have the future on our side'
A life in overdrive - that's what you had in mind
But in the end it was just lies

For somewhere in that night your vision went astray
You lost it to the streets - a dream that broke away

Talking 'bout wasted time - you do
Talking 'bout wasted life
When the doubts are coming through
And the promises you've broken, coming back in rhyme
On your mind - wasted time
Ambitions flying high - they all were bound to die
You never noticed moving on
They turned into your dreams - just like some memories
But now you know they've come undone.

For now the tide has turned, somewhere behind those blinds
And no one seems to know an old man left behind

Talking 'bout wasted time, you do
Talking 'bout wasted life
When the doubts are comin' through
And the promises you've broken coming back in rhyme
On your mind - wasted time

[Solo]

Talking 'bout wasted time, you do
Talking 'bout wasted life
When the doubts are comin' through...
