You say come with me - the land of the free
Is waiting for us - that's where we should be
In no time you'll see -the lock fails the key
It's just a big fuzz - and we start to discuss

Your save bets and the old ways won't do it in these days
Don't walk around selling worn out dreams
And don't you try to tell me, we're bound to win this race
By staying in the same old place

Tell me lies and under cover take my song and let it die
Rocks did roll beyond you, brother
Oneway street with no return
Say what you want, but leave me alone
Your vision has long run dry - has long run dry

You say, heed my call - there's no way we'll fall
Your talk is cheap - for soundly you sleep
Go praise the past - know few things do last
Your time has come - leaving you numb

Your save bets and the old ways won't do it in these days
Don't walk around selling worn out dreams
And don't you try to tell me, we're bound to win this race
By staying in the same old place

Tell me lies and under cover take my song and let it die
Rocks did roll beyond you, brother
Oneway street with no return
Say what you want, but leave me alone

Your vision has long run dry - has long run dry

[Solo]

Your save bets and the old ways
Won't do it in these days...
