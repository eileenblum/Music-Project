Troubled times - ages dark and violent
Lost my love and lost my life
On my way - crossed the seas of silence
Learned to fight - learned to survive

The darkness led me way astray - I cried
IÂ´ve learned to be a castaway - it comes as no surprise

Push me on - dry my eyes
Guide my heart through the night
Underneath your silent wings of love
Drive me all the way, I know -
For my love, it will grow - IÂ´m alive

Moving on - to a new horizon
And IÂ´m bound to make it through

The sorrow, it canÂ´t hold me down, IÂ´ll fight
I know your light will lead me on - I know, I will survive

Push me on - dry my eyes
Guide my heart through the night
Underneath your silent wings of love.
Drive me all the way, I know -
For my love, it will grow - IÂ´m alive, IÂ´m alive

[Solo]

Push me on - dry my eyes
Guide my heart through the night
Underneath your silent wings of love.
Drive me all the way, I know -
For my love, it will grow - IÂ´m alive, IÂ´m alive
