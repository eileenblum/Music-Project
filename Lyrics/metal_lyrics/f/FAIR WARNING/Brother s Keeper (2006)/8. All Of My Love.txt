Dreamin of the summerwind
Talking to the night
Silence left me over on my own

The memories of you and me
They keep me warm inside
For days are getting shorter now
And colder since you're gone.

And somewhere in that night - I see you cry
I wish, I could have wiped away - the pain you felt inside

All of my love to you
All of my hope and my faith in this life
May all of your dreams come true
Forever you shall stay in this heart of mine

Summer came and summer went
't was love on borrowed time
It feels like an illusion long bygone

And still I wonder, why we lost our way
I wish, I just could hold you now - I wish you would have stayed

All of my love to you
All of my hope and my faith in this life
May all of your dreams come true
Forever you shall stay in this heart of mine

[Solo]

All of my love to you
All of my hope and my faith in this life
May all of your dreams come true
Forever you shall stay in this heart of mine
