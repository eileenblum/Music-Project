Calling from the scene at midnight - talking like a movie star
Someone called you superficial, do you mind?
You party on until the daylight - and then you find, you've gone too far
It looks as if you're never making up your mind

There's something in your eyes, you can't hide
I wonder, if you'll ever notice, you're wasting your time

All I wanna do - 's to show real life to you
Drying all the tears in your eyes
And if you wanna know - c'mon and let it show
No one's gonna stop you this time

TV sails on cheap emotions - ego looks like sacred ground
Someday you might start to wonder, if it's true.
It looks as if you can't remember - a thrill that didn't let you down
I wonder if that's really all, you wanna do

There's something like a doubt on your mind
I guess, you'll never find the answer, unless you start tryin'

All I wanna do - 's to show real life to you
Drying all the tears in your eyes
And if you wanna know - c'mon and let it show
No one's gonna stop you this time

Some headline of the morning papers shows -
A fairy princess with a powdered nose - that's you
You lay awake at night and wonder why -
Those shiny daydreams feel like lies - they do

[Solo]

When there is love, when there is love,you see it through
Just need some love, take some love
That's all you need to do ...
