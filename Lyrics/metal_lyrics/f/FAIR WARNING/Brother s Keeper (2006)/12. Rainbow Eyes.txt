From the edge of nowhere, when daylight is fading

And time after time I've tried
To break up that spell on my life

Rainbow eyes, shine on bright
The hope in my heart never dies -

My hope in my heart never dies,
My hope in my heart never dies

And time after time I've tried
To break up that spell on my life

Rainbow eyes, rainbow eyes
Haunt my nights - I'm tryin to ...
