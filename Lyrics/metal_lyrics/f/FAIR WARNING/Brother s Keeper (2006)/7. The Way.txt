Riding on the wind - call it direction
Underneath the stars - into the night
I can see them rise - call it infection
Powerful and bright - guiding my life

Escaped from the chains of my sorrow
Laid out in the depth of my heart
I search for the gates of to-morrow
Show me where it starts

Show me the way - under the moon
Show me the rhythm of my life
I just can't wait 'till you come down into this night
Show me the way - out of the dark
Tearing the veil before my eyes - show me the way

Waiting for the wind - call it devotion
Underneath the skies - distant and blue

Unbound from the chains of my sorrow
Way down in the depth of my heart
In search for the gates of tomorrow
Show me, where it starts

Show me the way - under the stars
Show me the rhythm of my life
I just can't wait, 'till you come down, light of my day
Show me the way - to just where you are
Healing a tired and troubled mind - show me the way
The way

[Solo]

Show me the way - under the moon
Show me the rhythm of my life
I just can't wait 'till you come down ...
