Riots raging in that silent city
Eyes of anger as you hit the street.
(You) don't know much about the art of fighting
But down in your heart you've got some fear to beat

And the night comes slowly - creeping in your mind
Once they got you running
It seems you go down just for one more time

Once bitten, twice shy
You took it easy, but now you fight
Once bitten, fighting back the eyes of night

Hey, bigshot, don't you run for cover
Fear's a sidekick you just can't deny
You can try, but you can never hide it
For out on the streets you're standing eye to eye

When the night comes slowly - darkness all around
Ain't no use in hiding
Just keep a cool head as you stand your ground

Once bitten, twice shy
You took it easy, but now you fight
Once bitten, fighting back the eyes of night

[Solo]

When the night comes slowly - creeping in your mind
Ain't no use in hiding
What's left of yourself, put it on the line

Once bitten, twice shy
You took it easy, but now you fight
Once bitten, fighting back the eyes of night
Once bitten, twice wrong ...
