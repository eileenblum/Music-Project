(NO, TRY NOT
THERE IS NO TRY
DO OR DO NOT
UNLEARN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED)

We trade in the truth
Don't mind to spoil our youth
On comforts we feast
Lip service - a well known beast

We close our ears
We heard it all before
Dispel no fears
No one left to adore

When the times are changing
The visions fading
The walls are falling

When the tides are turning
The bridges burning
The world stops spinning
Around you

A simple message underrated
I'm generation Jedi
And I hope there's some force to be with me
Intimidated, educated
I'm generation Jedi
And I pray for the day there's a light to see
For the generation Jedi

No good and no bad
Do we believe this lie
A world all gone mad
We kiss our minds goodbye

When the times are changing
The visions fading
The walls are falling

When the tides are turning
The bridges burning
The world stops spinning
Around you

A simple message underrated
I'm generation Jedi
And I hope there's some force to be with me
Intimidated, educated
I'm generation Jedi
And I pray for the day there's a light to see
For the generation Jedi

So how come twisted words of wisdom do make sense
Tales of kings and queens gives us confidence
Cause we're much too used to cheap pretense
Laugh about innocence truth is nothing but offense
Political correctness spoiled our common sense
And nothing makes a difference

When the times are changing
The visions fading
The walls are falling

When the tides are turning
The bridges burning
The world stops spinning
Around you

A simple message underrated
I'm generation Jedi
And I hope there's some force to be with me
Intimidated, educated
I'm generation Jedi
And I pray for the day there's a light to see
For the generation Jedi
