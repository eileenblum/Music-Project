Silence turns my heart into the night
Visions of the past begin to rise

I'm tired of looking back - it feels like wasted time
I just can't wait to leave it all behind

Don't keep me waiting - Don't let me stand here on my own
I learned the truth, that drives my soul's desire
Don't let it end here - I just can't make it all alone
My heart's on fire - My heart's on fire

Driving through the wastelands of my mind
Mysteries and dreams, I left behind

I'm tired of looking back - those days are dead and gone
My heart, it just can't wait to carry on

Don't keep me waiting - Don't let me stand here on my own
I learned the truth, that drives my soul's desire
Don't let it end here - I just can't make it all alone
My heart's on fire - My heart's on fire

[Solo]

Don't keep me waiting - Don't let me stand here on my own
I learned the truth, that drives my soul's desire
Don't let it end here - I just can't make it all alone
We'll rise up high, we'll touch the sky
with hearts on fire - with hearts on fire
