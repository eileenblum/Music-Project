â¦Humanityâs Coronation

Wreathed in clairvoyance
Lucid to solely stare into naught
Wrapped in dead silence
We fade to solitude

In the abstract hands of genesis
Consciousness created life in its image
Taking the anthropocentric shape of their desires

The more rose the light-burned leaves unto the wrath of Ra
The more sank heroic roots deep into subsurface springs
We now might be through the prism of existence

But, curving space through immemorial time
In shadows of deadly haste they wrote
Hatred's upstrokes upon each other's skins

From light violence flew to shade to thus return
Blessed in arcane waters by their own-drawn fear

And, curving space in spite of immemorial time
In shadows of hopeless wait I sense
Hatred's token deep in my ghostly flesh

Dazzled by obliveon's reflexions we shall push away
Contingency that once wove our human crown

Wreathed in thorns, baptized yet naked
Already acclaiming the blindfolded to come
