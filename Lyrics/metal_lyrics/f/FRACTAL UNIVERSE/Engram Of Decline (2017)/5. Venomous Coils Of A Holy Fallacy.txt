Hopeless they stood
Fatherless and guilty
Begetting in sorrow
Alone amongst themselves

Dawnless and curved
Loathing our finiteness
The first eye that killed
And the last one that saw

These faces altered into a play of shameful reflections
Fists open on puny ghosts beneath rainy laments
We are possessed by the foundations of a sacred premise

Willows of guilt thrust their roots deep in essential grounds
Over turbid swamps we walk, beyond an earthly sight we believe
Down by the Styx' springs towards bottomless skies we sink

Venomous coils of a holy fallacy
Sights whole to transcend multiplicity

Strangling contingency between the serpentine coils of fate
Upon nihilist surfaces a celestial venom to be distilled

Rose the third-named altars where shined mists oniric
For arachnidean greed self-fragments dwell in webs of reality

Venomous coils of a holy fallacy
Bleak lands annihilating unity

For our inner streams have painted scarlet the horizons
In an illusory delight we weaved metaphysic veils
Crowned heavens with stars-eyed canvases

For we stare at the preaching mouths of creatures beyond
Spewing out the subservience of a Manichaean nightmare
Thrown in shaded projections we became chosen serves

Trapped in ancestral crypts
Amid moonlit archetypes
That sinful legacy
Denied our identity
