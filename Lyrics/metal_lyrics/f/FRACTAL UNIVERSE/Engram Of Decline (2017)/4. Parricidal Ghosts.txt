Crowned with light of prismatic clouds to be
Thousands of water drops to fill the sea
Boundless spaces opened behind this name

Although tainted by skyless dawns aflame
Stenches of necrosed humankind's breath
Choking with the panacea of death

Uniqueness â ambivalent creation
Imago sinking into oblivion

That presaged greed to spawn in hearts crawling to the ever-forsaken
Which stared restless at their father's fist closed on this upper perdition

Rising once again against the Otherâs dominion
Strangling with its tail in an endless repetition
In the blood of their forebears we baptised our children

Nerves flickering in the windy caress
A moth flew beneath this moonlit promise

Scarlet quills of violence, this vengeful duality
United in knowledge sprang from multiplicity

Rising once again against the Otherâs dominion
Strangling with its tail in endless repetition
In the blood of their forebears we baptised our children

Gathered to recover what they once lost
Carving the flesh of their own flesh with might
They tore his limbs in a reckless delight
A parricidal feast upon his ghost

Sphinx down ere fulfilment of prophecy
Death merging with life â born anew in guilt
Wandering blindfolded midst thorns they built
Moral effigies for humanity

Rising once again against the Otherâs dominion
Strangling with its tail in infinite repetition
In the blood of their forebears we baptised our children

The wheel is turning, end annihilated from actions
Children of deceit cursed by ancient generations
We are the last preachers of sinful aberrations
