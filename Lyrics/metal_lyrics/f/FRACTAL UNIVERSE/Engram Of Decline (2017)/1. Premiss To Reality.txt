Naught Ere the beginning of times
Blindfolded by icy breaths on oneiric spaces
Like shadows we experienced to create
Choking on stardust - to be born or to be

Lifeless matter stood away from time
Roots thrust deep into the aerial grounds
As macrocosm of an infinitesimal supernova
We're elements of gravity on a fractal universe

Abyss' eyes upon a moonlight-born meniscus
Simultaneously inside and outside we lived
Linked in anonymity - bottomless and topless
Flowers of chaos in a contingent enlightenment

Reality laid still, a fear to be drawn
On the immaculate canvas of genesis

As furrows aflame in the wake of the temporal wheel
Fractal elements we used to creep under the weight of gravity
Longing for the threnody of celestial choirs
In a verticality momentum we rise to gaze upon...

In a mist layer shrouded world we dream like puny ghosts
Anthropomorphic - we established a sense of gravity
Time as an artifact of the curved line of matter
A before and an after whereby life shall be our archetype
