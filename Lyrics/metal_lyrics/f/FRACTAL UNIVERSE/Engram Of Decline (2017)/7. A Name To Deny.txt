Once blood-blessed at cold dawn, providential heavens
That turned into roots the gift of identity
In the name of ruled effigies of existence
All power out loud, quoth the Father : âThou shalt beâ

Embracing in hate black suns of contingency
They created the world after their own-drawn fear
But how could I exist if I am doomed to be
We consecrate creation with a name to tear

The chalice bore us nameless, naked â solitude's creation
Wholeness lands lifted over Unitarian aberration

Staying red deep the tearful eyes of our failing derision
As slowly rose from naught the cursed winds of children's horizon

And though daylights are restlessly worshipped amidst midnight seeds
Deathbreath always carries the flame of our namesake dreamlike greeds

Blessed at blood cold dawn from providential heavens
Turning the gift of being into creation
Worshipping the festering laws of existence
All breaths damned for Humanity's coronation

Staying red deep the tearful eyes of our failing derision
As slowly rose from naught the cursed winds of children's horizon

Give highest mounts the force to build a memorial to silence
We are the ones whose denial carved names twisted in violence
