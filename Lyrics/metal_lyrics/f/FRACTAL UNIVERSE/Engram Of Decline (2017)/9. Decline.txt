From a crimson dusk embracing the fall of winter heights
That took monochrome dreams over with moonless sights

Moonless yet dazzling like sand dunes
Flayed through a nameless misery
Our voices sink against the nocturnal singings
Into the dusty ennui of a conform thought

In the hollows of ocean valleys I wander
This nagging glimmer shall remain my grandest curse
Faces fallen as the threnody of a circular pendulum
Through aeons still I wonder

Solitude stays an earthly sorrow
Aquatic reflections â our infernal shadows

Holding burning suns in our ritual hands
Hell is an earthly abode
A sweet flagrance of genetic poison
Sparkling violence and intrinsic hatred

Under the ashes of charred trees I rest
This nagging glimmer shall remain my deadliest curse
Faces drowned in the abyssal depths of mind
Through aeons still I wonder

Like clay creatures in a pre-existent altar
Carrying illusory flames under deceitful winds
My midnight melody
Alone amongst themselves

At twilight of highest mounts
Shall I face the world united
Ephemeral names â faceless
Through aeons still I wonder

When come the most silent hour
Throwing my heavy crown of light aside
I Listen to the depths-spurting springs' whispers
