Matter could not bear the vision of the Blind
As only darkness pierced through unconscious gates
They used to bow down before the black-glowing suns

Yielding substantial wombs to words of reality

A nameless raven swept the earthly meniscus
Skimming the sparkling winds with its monochrome wings
Tearing translucent waters like a veil of flesh

Untainted â The Third Eye
Emerged â From the Dephts

Come to me â Sons of ignorance
Humanity's coronation â Wreathed in clairvoyance

Behold â Thy mind begot the essence of verity
Blinded â For in its namesake Thou shalt be

And thus they weaved the world with lying webs
Bright and uncompromising, infested with emotions

And thus they built the world for their children's memorial
Naming the stars after their enlightened sights

Come to me â Sons of ignorance...
