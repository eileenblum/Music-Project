Listen to the depths-spurting springs
Like a core in flames supporting an anaclitic bark
At death of night they whisper the faintest riddle
For those who still have an ear to behold

Through aeons still I used to gaze upon
Lyrical songs as an architectural monolith
Plebeian choirs in archaic dissonances
A fear shared midst uncounted unquenched roots

Humanity embraced by the archetype of death
MÃ¶bius strip... Engram of decline

Temporal wheel closed on a compulsive spiral
Purpose for purposes â to be born or to be
Our desires consumed us behind deceit
The twilit glows of truths gathered

I dreamt global crystal that withdraws into itself
Opening to reflect the starlit meniscus
So leaves shall fly away beyond the tops

Humanity embraced by the archetype of death
MÃ¶bius strip... Engram of decline

Threnody spawned from silent nothingness
Solitude among ourselves, one word to curse us all

Simultaneously inside and outside we stand
Like skin torn apart â narcissistic haemorrhage
Petrified by MÃ¶bius' deadly command
Under nocturnal skies of despair we bleed

Rise over thyself
Through aeons still I wondered
Gazing upon highest mounts
Whereas the truth rests in the abyss

Threnody spawned from silent nothingness
Solitude among ourselves, one word to curse us all

Rise under the lands
Man is something that must be overcome
Fall over the seas
For the answer dwells deep in thee

Humanity embraced by the archetype of death
MÃ¶bius strip... Engram of decline

Decline...
