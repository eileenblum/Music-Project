Leaning over the narrowing oblong
Of a generating experience
My ambivalent fortress
Like a sail in a sea of ramifications

A sharp-limbed figure is whispering
The muffled harmonics of a lunatic lullaby
Relics of absence that closed the Klein bottle
Upon itself

To seal these corporeal arabesques with metonymical incisions
Humanity has lift up the depths of madness' mark

Once doomed our hopes of remembrance
From the sporadic preachings of a bewitched tongue
How could I reach a path that lays still in another voice?
I bear the tumbledown architecture of the inconceivable

Being and nothingness
Torus of desire
Vacuity of existence
We starve for salvation

To seal these corporeal arabesques with metonymical incisions
Humanity has lift up the depths of madness' mark
