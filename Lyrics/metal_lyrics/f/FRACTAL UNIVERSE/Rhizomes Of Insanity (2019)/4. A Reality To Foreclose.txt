Dividing the atmosphere into a disconcerting jigsaw
Heaven's vault is splitting up along manifold broken lines
Every moist piece of untold history will fall apart
Boundless gloom of precedence-to-be â space pervades

Continental facets as projections of our unilateral sights
I stare at the wan caress of those artificial crystals

Scrolls of a manuscript truth
Opening to meaning to foreclose reality
Madness in the eye of the wise man

The fantastical relics of absence
Writing the meaningless to bring the present forth
Wisdom in the eye of the mad man

On Charon's trail sensed I the foul breath of the netherworld
Within themselves the Wight's words carry the harbingers of insanity
