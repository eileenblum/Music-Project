Sanded pearls falling through the narrow neck of time
Thousands of paths are furtively opening before my steps
Splinter of a temporal incision healing in a heartbeat

And thus I stand on the edge of these fractal dilemmas

The luxuriant canopy of stillborn destinies
Twisted constellations with esoteric roots
Whence shall I write an indecipherable will with an unconscious hand

If my guiding star is one mid the milky way
My life wavers between the befallen and the unbefallen

And thus I stand on the edge of these fractal dilemmas
A mosaic of sorrow beneath those forbidden truths

Is this but the last shred of my unfulfilled dreams? Or the unfathomable fruit of a perception surreal by its omnipresence? My thoughts are coiling themselves up to drift along the meanders of time â as an ingenuous butterfly that would vanish into the oneiric spectrum of my bottomless sight...

Fading into the void's omnipresence
I shall carry the voices of nihilism

And thus I stand on the edge of these fractal dilemmas
A mosaic of sorrow beneath those forbidden...
