The Earth's core is pulsating in a dull trance
My body has sunk its veins deep into the ground
I am the measure of a world that converges on death
Fleshless being drifting at the whim of tides

Reflection stays but the virtuality of a parallel mosaic
As heavens would face the netherworld
The matrix that crosses every artifact of our constellation

Eel of precedence-to-be wriggling within the seabed's cracks
That bends at the echoes of beats of existence
Torus of desire under the will of the atmosphere
Concentric spirals of choking incarnation

Reflection stays but the virtuality of a parallel mosaic
As heavens would face the netherworld
The matrix that crosses every artifact of our constellation

Orbital furrows of a fractal space deformed
Ballet of void revolving in insane arabesques

Caught into the labile tangents of a bubble-world
With the porous membrane of a blurred screen
Janus' silent supplications
My universe is naught but the paradox of an eternal return

Reflection stays but the virtuality of a parallel mosaic
As heavens would face the netherworld
The matrix that crosses every artifact of our constellation

And yet virtuality brings more than an ethereal moth's fantasy
The being of radical otherness
Madness is the masterpiece of humankind
