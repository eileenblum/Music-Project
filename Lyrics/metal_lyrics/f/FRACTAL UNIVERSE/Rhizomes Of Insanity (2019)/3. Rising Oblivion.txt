Truths are flickering at the rate of my steps' parallax
I gaze upon this sphere with an eye stranger to itself
Like a serpentine river curling its frozen coils up
Abysmal epicenter of our circular projections

The elusive modulations of the field of possibles
Shaped these ghosts with deformed masks â as real as fleeting
The Wight affixed its violence with a bewitched tongue
The evanescence of life carved into our flesh

Piercing through skin and choking bones
Its words became stratified in symbolic sediments
Eternity from the burning shivers of their existence
Human flimsiness' macrocosmic reflections

The elusive modulations of the field of possibles
Shaped these ghosts with deformed masks â as real as fleeting
The Wight affixed its violence with a bewitched tongue
The evanescence of life carved into our flesh

Harrowing shadows wriggling into a spiritual abyss
From a boundless might with unconscious moves

Whispering a disturbing future in the ear of a misty past
My soul is a constantly born-again oblivion

Newborn oblivion
Spirit's incision
Abyss of my soul
Dawn of damnation
