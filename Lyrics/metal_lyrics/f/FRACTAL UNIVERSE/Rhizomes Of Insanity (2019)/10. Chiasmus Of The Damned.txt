At the end of this archaic dividing process
Cynical puppet under the heavenly leer of invisible figures
Waver I between the will to power and the chiasmus of oblivion

Life stays now just a spark
Guttering under changing...

Winds of the endless greed for an Utopian promise
That fathered this nameless creature â fantastical reality

Thrusting its fertile tentacles
To reach the heart of our dreams â tainted from now on

The countless arabesques of hallowed scrolls
Became incarnated from the un couscious parallax of might
Human obscurantism near madness' transcendence

Life stays now just a spark
Guttering under changing winds

The endless greed for an Utopian promise
Has fathered this nameless creature â fantastical reality

As the reckless heirs of cannibalistic injunctions
Rotted from within since the gnawing maggots of consumerism

I mourn our children that will never come into the world
