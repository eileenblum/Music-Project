For fear of a bifacial contamination
Janus' paradox in front of our unspoken works

They forged again the hypocritical links of an imperfect symmetry
With the prospect of a growing swarm of perplexity

Passing the blade edge of allegorical otherness
Over the unfulfilled promises of a salutary emotion

And thus I am the bastard child of this self-maddening chaos
And this matrix reflection that pierced through our universal flesh

The unquenchable greed for a deadly utopia
Has twisted the silky curtains of our existential potentialities
From the egotist canopy to a desire yet to come
We are the cynical heirs of a fundamental dividing principle
