Architecture of paroxysm
Paradoxical wombs of life

A single spark amongst the vacuity of gloom
That spreads its tentacular ramifications
To create a sphere of possibilities
Was it the realisations I dreamt about
Or did I spring from this oppressive allegory?

To divide the space-time with metaphorical blades
