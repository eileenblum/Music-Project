Opening horizon, sketching an ever-present temporality
I float upon the flickering surfaces of the atmosphere
Twisting scales of light apart through a silky curtain of vacuity
That shades with the curves of my crystal wings

Darker than nightfall
Burst the sun through heaven's vault
To wave the confused layers of bifacial realisations
To make ether as earthly as the blackening dawn

Aren't those curves mine?
Or did the morning mist mark these bounds to tear up my mind?
Is this moth's path just a fantastical line?
Or is my being but a piece of its mind?

Dream of mine
Piece of mind
Nightmare's blind
Sightless line

Fleet the heartbeats of a forever closed path
As disperse the last shreds of my oneiric hopes

Aren't those curves mine?
Or did the morning mist mark these bounds to tear up my mind?
Is this moth's path just a fantastical line?
Or is my being but a piece of its mind?

Dream of mine
Piece of mind

Truth, vicissitudes of soul and contingency
As many tears dropping within circles of causality

Am I that name? Or a thousand of dreams?
Rising and dying in a intangible parabola
