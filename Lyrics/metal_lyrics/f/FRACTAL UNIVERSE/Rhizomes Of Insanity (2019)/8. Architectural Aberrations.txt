Birth-chained by the radical otherness
Of a prophetic word
The paroxysmal remnants of shredded wombs
Have merged into a contourless cytoplasm

Swarming humankind â countless ramifications
A plasma of probabilistic chaos to link our realisations

The untold history
Of an unanimous masterpiece
That used to creep from one to the other
To thence settle in stratifying foundations

Swarming humankind â countless ramifications
A plasma of probabilistic chaos to link our realisations
Divided into a thousand of singular jigsaw pieces
We developed an architectural sense of aberration

A core of denial

For the ever-unbefallen universal
As the moody porosity of a diseased membrane
Pushing its achievements away
