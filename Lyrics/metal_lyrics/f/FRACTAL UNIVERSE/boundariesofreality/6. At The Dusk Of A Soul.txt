At the dusk of a soul
A raven appeared
Cheering in the fading light
Exalted by the subtle flavour
Of raising frailness
Comes the bringer of truth
Consuming like a candle
My existence is crumbling
I fall into oblivion
Of my own existence
At the dusk of a soul
A child stood
Hiding in the shadows
A lonely tear
Running down the cheek of he
Who wanted to teach the eternal return
Consumed like a candle
His mind a crystal shattered
By uncarriable emotions
He took shelter in nihilism
