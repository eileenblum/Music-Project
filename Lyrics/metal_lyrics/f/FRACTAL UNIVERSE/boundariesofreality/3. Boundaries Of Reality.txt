Where are the boundaries of existence

And where does the world of dreams begin
And an eternal nightmare, where life would be my reality
Emotions are perverted
Flattened are thoughts
Senses are confused
Perception in faked
Bound by non-existent chains
In a mental prison forever
Illusions of freedom and light
Disappear into a sphere of darkness
Trapped in myself
Trapped in nothingness
I slowly fade into a state

Of unconsciousness
Where are the boundaries of existence

And where does the world of dreams begin
Boundaries of reality
Where light and darkness unite
Boundaries of reality

Where spirits collapse
Where are the boundaries of existence

And where does the world of dreams begin
And an eternal nightmare, where life would be my reality
