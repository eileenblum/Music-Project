Every night has turned into a celestial quest
Away from stars and the tainted light of truth
I always dream whence dawn the grief
The rotten roots of this deadly astral sorrow
Trough the secret denied of a dark-lit cradle
The shared glister bloomed in truthfulness

Still powerless against the coming loss
Mourning the loss of a dim glance

In the gloaming of failing days
As the lock rusted turned closed forever
I filled the whispers of the lost seeker
With wish of a strength timelessly missed
Two sightless eyes to lament the dimness
The dying glance of a bleeding misery

Still powerless against the coming loss
Mourning the loss of a dim glance

And this fire has finally burned my eyes
Reflecting the fading sight of an hopeless smile

Still without travel unto the waterfall
To face the existential walls of the unfathomable
The forsaken soul dissolved within all believes
Drew a suffering sky for the gleams sake

Still powerless against the coming loss
Mourning the loss of a dim glance
