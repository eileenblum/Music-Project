Timesand wasted beyond the mirrors of sins
Piercing the done and the undone forth
In purpose to assuage a selfcentric system

A sparkling lake rimmed with narcissus
Staring at another eyes for reflection
With bloodthirstiness of their own Creation

I blame the culture creators
Which befoul the Altruist Word
I bewail but one butterfly sake
In the tears of misanthropy

A chosen drowning into a green ocean
A heavy heart aflame that fears no more
The last justice of Anubis Scales

Forsaking the selfishness of dust
To contemplate an inhuman beauty
The dazzling light of the purest gleams

Among the scattered fragments of broken mirrors
Awakening of a misanthropic greed once denied

I blame the culture creators
Which befoul the Altruist Word
I bewail but one butterfly sake
In the tears of misanthropy

Chained with darkened-origin weakness
Dimming with disillusion ere falls the dusk
Crying for loveletters and the thirteenth

The twinkling wings of the green butterfly
Bounce the drowned eyes of the Misanthrope

I blame the culture creators
Which befoul the Altruist Word
I bewail but one butterfly sake
In the tears of misanthropy
