The damn sinister river
Flowing through the highest mountains
Contains the tears of
A thousand human lost souls
Swept away by the ice cold torrent
Of human's torment and despair
I feel that resistance is vain
And let dark water fill my lungs
I climbed up endless cliffs
To find answers to my questions
The wind whispered to me
Implored me to turn back
Swept away by the ice cold torrent
Of human's torment and despair
I feel that resistance is vain
And let dark water fill my lungs
I hoped to resolve The Enigma of Human's Sorrow
But driven mad by a choir of lamentations
I fell into the water
