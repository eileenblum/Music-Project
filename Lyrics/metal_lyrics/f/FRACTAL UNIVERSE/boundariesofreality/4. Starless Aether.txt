Weeping for infiniteness
They mourn the covenants of our longing
A scarlet line burning through loneliness
Aerial dreams fade yet pain ever remains
Clouded midst whispering shadows
I am the one whom curse the suns
Whom walk within the ashes of hatred
Greedy for their endless suffering
In that boundless universe
Heavens spangled with stars
From birth to death
From wholeness to nothingness
And I lost my mind to the aether
But no light falls here below
Hither shan't pierce any glint
Unforgiving by the unbiased Aeon
Watching a stillborn doomed to naught
I plunged deeply to my only empyrean
To the hopeless dream of the Stargazer
So far of the earth, out of reach
A sacrifice to touch a single moment
To feel the burn of an undiscovered sadness
And this life quest intended for failure
Thusly I finally understood the meaning
The true arcane purpose of the Alchemist
In that boundless universe
Heavens spangled with stars
From birth to death
From wholeness to nothingness
And I lost my mind to the aether
But no light falls here below
Hither shan't pierce any glint
Beneath the measureless skies, a sombre lifetime
Over this existence, a starless aether...
