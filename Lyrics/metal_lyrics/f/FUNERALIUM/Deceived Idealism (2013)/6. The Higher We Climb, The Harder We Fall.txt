I bitterly loathe all shitheads on earth
Yet, I'm undeterred to hijack all their feebleness
Yeah, I'm climbing again!

I teach them how to be the most flawless crooks
And collect their stolen gold
Yeah, I'm rising again

They tear apart one another and are devoured by envy
They're divided and against one another, craving for gold
Yeah I'm ruling again

They finally spit at my face like a louse
And stab me remorselessly in the back
Why am I stumbling now?

I see their shrieking laughters (sic) and sparkles of cruelty
It's all reddening now, it's all befogging now
My remains are already being shredded
Tattered and torn, each wants their piece
I knew this was coming, oh what a farce
I don't really feel anything anymore, not for much longer,
It's all dim, darkening and crimson as these very last seconds last forever I can reflect...
Sad to be just a one eyed man ruling over the land of the blind

My decline had more grandeur, a sardonic grandeur
The struggle for power has begun, who will replace me?
I'm being scattered nothing ever really mattered
Nothing really ever mattered
Nothing really ever mattered
Yeah, I'm dead now
