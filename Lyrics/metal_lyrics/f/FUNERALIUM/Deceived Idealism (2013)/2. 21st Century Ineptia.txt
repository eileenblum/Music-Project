Scums! Chant for me
Worms! Crawl to me
Corpses! Rot for me

Men! Bow to me
Women! Be free to pleasure me
Children! Feed me

Minions! Lick my feet
Slaves! Worship me
Insects! Obey my will
I'm the lord Ineptia

Thus now you know your god
The master of Defection and Falseness
Run and rush to nothingness
Rejoice in the baseness I offer you
Love the intellectual void I feed you with
No food for thoughts, you're on ground zero
No wonder, no pain

You worms! Crawl to me
You plagued! Empower me
Already dead, still walking
Accomplices in the arrival of the Great Ineptia

Thus now you know your world
A world where I rule with Art
Flesh puppets of my will
Your mind is gone to ashes
Bow your head, walk in line
Fuel the machinery I am
Break your hands, your spines
There is no truth except my lies

Don't even dare to think  by yourself
You've already been lobotomized by my toys
Turning consumption to compulsion
Turning culture to ignorance

Do the will of thy Architect
Grease the wheels with your blood

When you'll awake, it'll already be too late
Storm comes near, inside your mind
You tend to find out but you're delusional
The law of the new Era mass control
Poor media, you scream in horror
But nobody cares!!!

Inhale the fragrance of my stench
You're the source of it all
It comes and goes as you get in deeper waters
Conditioned behaviors only feed me more
As mediocrity and idiocy are the new standards

You live by it, you live in it
You crawl like worms, my worms
What you preach is what I vomit
My wastes are your idols

But deep inside, you know something
Is still moving but you forbid yourself
To face it to unveil the truth
Beyond the plan, to reach once again
Your own consciousness

Now you see, you all belong to me
My world of worms, my brethren
Pathetic empty shells under my will
This is how I spread Ineptia

Awakening in the sweat of awareness
The horror of understanding dilating the eye
The ridiculous dominion of all that is superficial
In the Great Ineptia era, nothing is random

Walk the line, watch your feet
The unbearable predicament of being a toy
The story of your existence, same as all the others
Will end up in the coffin that feeds my machine

The final chapter is already written
The coldness of the barrel on you tongue
The Final Clap of the Trigger
