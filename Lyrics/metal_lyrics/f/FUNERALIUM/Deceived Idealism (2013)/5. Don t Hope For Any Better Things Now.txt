You'd better stop screaming towards these merciless walls which keep on echoing back
Feel and touch, blood is running from your own ears, you are making yourself deaf

Scratching your throat, sore, exploding your ears, sore, ripping your vocal cords, sore
What shall you do when you're deaf and mute? Only your eyes left to tear off
So don't hope for any better things now

Your empire has fallen so trying to gather all its pieces won't make the sun come again
So forget these ruins, swallow your bitterness and look beyond your everyday variations
Just because villains will always remain the same glorious parasites for the whole mankind
Vultures feasting on your demise, scornful grins as an audience, worms and cockroaches

Moss on the fallen rocks, harsh and deadly cold
No softness whatsoever; they are your last refuge
Broken rocks scattered on a hostile ground
Your feet would bleed; your fingers could turn blue

Damp and penetrating: the biting cold your blood slowing down, shunning your fingertips,
Your hands, your torn feet
Blisters scorched by the freezing cold, what a vengeance!?

Your empire has fallen and it could have crushed your skull,
But its unforeseen collapse, oh it was tremendously slow
Like decay, rocks poured from a lurid sky

And there was nothing you could do about it,
They fell and fell, one by one, your fate slowly dripping away
Now grab these rocks, hold them ferociously
With all your strength and love, that's all there is

And lo! Within that confused head of yours, something is rotting; the miasma makes you feel dizzy
The sheer pestilent smell of lunacy resulting from ceaseless disappointments, over and over again
Don't hope for any better things now

Fucked in the head, they took you for a fool repeatedly, they have been vomiting in your brain
You're so full of acrid disillusions; they are munching your hopes, corroding your values,
Don't hope for any better things now

Corrupting your senses, piercing your chest
Choking your soul, bursting your ire
Powerless, defenseless and helpless

Don't hope for any better things now
