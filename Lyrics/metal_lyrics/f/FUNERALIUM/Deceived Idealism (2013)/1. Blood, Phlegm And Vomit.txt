It's time to regret the day you were born
So curse all the prostitutes who gave you this burden!
Called LIFE! Yes LIFE! You know what it deals with now?

You are just a bunch of rotting corpses to me
I will grind your tongue, pierce your eyes and cut your ears!
Vomit in your mouths, skin you alive and lick your wounds!
Then, I will take your guts out and defecate on them!
In the name of our LORD! Yes in the name of our LORD!

Finally, you will tied (sic) down and left to a herd of pigs in rut
You will be defiled and I will sew your little holes with barbed wires!

I want to inhale the smell of your burning flesh
Then, I will bathe my face in your own blood
Yet, I will carefully keep you alive until the gallows
I will be the first one sitting butt naked on your corpse
And I will devour you for the sheer pleasure of vomiting you out
