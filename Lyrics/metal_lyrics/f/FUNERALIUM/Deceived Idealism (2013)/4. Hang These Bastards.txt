Drag them by hair
Bring them to the place
Please, no forgiveness for their acts

Make way for the hangman
Invoke his heinousness
Please, no pity towards their weeping

Bring them to the gallows
Hold tight their ropes
Yes, behold their brutal agony

Their tar tongue swollen
Burst red eyes disfiguring
Rigor mortis from retribution
