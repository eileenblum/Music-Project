All these squandered but precious years could have been spared
Keeping faith with mankind has led you do a well deserved dire fate
You could have avoided all these mockeries and this awful sense
Which have both led you to a path on which nothingness dwells

But you have remained adamant that this was the decent path
Trying to reach a respected social status, all mirrors and filthy lies
By smoothing your life over, always smiling to fate, whatever comes
ow the stench is poignant but still you refuse to acknowledge it

So bury once and for all every single one of these stinking principles
Dictated by that so-called moral and that will to become someone honorable
Set now an example of yourself by walking with a conspicuous humiliation placard
Then embrace your deserved misery in the middle of the most crowded public place

There yell your pathetic story like a martyred pig and beg them all to stone you to death
Rejoice when the stones hit your shameful face expressing the sign of your own defeat
Purify your body with the mixture of blood and humiliating spits covering your mortal flesh
And ask for pity to be able to teach the lessons of benefaction to your children and relatives

But guess what? They won't listen to you at all, ignorant filth, they'd rather forget you
Forsaken creature, you will be left alone, scorned and scolded like a guilty wimpy child
Protest in vain, your weeping won't be considered as rain falling on a burning dried up soil
Behold how they err, and how they are happy to err, so ignore what you have been taught

Basking in ignominy, you might reach salvation
Flirting with fallacy, you may achieve redemption
Fighting all calumny, you must face aggression
Embracing your folly, you shant avoid oblivion
