OK that's it
Couldn't feel the change
Reality has warped so let's face it
Years have passed
Forgotten how the pain is disguised
But still hiding away from the sun

A fist plunges into my chest
And extracts a blood weeping heart
Crooked hands scraping my entrails
The pills are out of mine now
That cleans and resets
Couldn't see the thing
Hiding away from the sun

In the corner, the waving stigmatas of heat
The vertical bars sweat the blissful light
Candies spilled around me
A chemical constellation tells a story
That no man should ever hear
Blind am I, hidden away away from the sun
