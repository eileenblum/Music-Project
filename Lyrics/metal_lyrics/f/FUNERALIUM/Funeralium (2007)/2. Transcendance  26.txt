Set your arms free, leave your corpse
Departure for the ultimate trip
Climb high, seize the speed
Never get back! Always making for the cold

Fix the raw energy of the earth

Set destination to nowhere, nowhen
Outside of space, outside of time, inside of you
Ought to leave your eyes now
No need further

Mental metaperception
Unlinking of soul anchors
Complete dehumanization
Irresistible attraction for the void
Sickness behind the mask of gold
