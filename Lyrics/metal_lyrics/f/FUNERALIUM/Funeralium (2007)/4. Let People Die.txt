Let people die
Please let people die
Please, please cease their suffering

One person you don't take care of
Is one more for oblivion

Let people die
Please let people die
Please, please cease their suffering

A dead you let go with a flower
Concerned by a cold fluctuation
Trade a vegetable against another one

One more sore to be scared
One more lie to erase
One more ball to my ankle
