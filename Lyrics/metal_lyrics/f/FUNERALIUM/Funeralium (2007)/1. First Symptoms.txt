I played the painter on my skin
And engraved some figures on it

Push them away!!

Suppurated became my draws
The stinking precious waste

Push them away!!

I poured some salt into my wounds
and softened them with cotton-wool

Push them away!!

Attempted to extract this gem
the fucking black bile

Push them away!!
