Oh sweet adorable worm
Begotten in mud, born in mud
Barking at the void, slithering in circles, awry, so awry

Warding off bad luck
Always bouncing back bravely
Never stop looking at the unreachable
Envying the unattainable, the pure, the true,
Oh thou the corrupted

Wriggle with all your strength
Stubborn and acrimonious,
Wriggle to no avail for you're going nowhere
Digging in the mud ferociously looking for ways to escape
In vain of course in vain

Conjure up bad luck
Get a hold of yourself
Never stop staring at the unreachable
Beholding the unattainable, the pure, the true
Oh thou the limbless wretched

The mighty ones are so above,
In olden times, they moulded a world without entry
They feast there on the corpses of you and your siblings
While building houses of cards with your own destinies

But rest assured: They see you not
Utterly oblivious of your feeble existence,
Oh so feeble, perfectly unaware of your sufferings,
Your throes, your woes

Your ceaseless struggles
Until your demise
For nothing but half rotten crumbs
Incommensurable amounts of petty griefs
Minuscule tragedies, cute little agonies, yet unnoticed

You screech
You slay your fellow worms pitilessly
for their crumbs and truth be told,
Sometimes they watch, they watch and then they giggle:
Your strifes for crumbs, jaws ajar, nails sharpened,
Cruel and lethal bitings,ceaselessly
For nothing but crumbs, so deliciously hilarious harken!
You may hear their disdainful giggles

Crawl, crawl further, beyond the feasible
Lower yourself furthermore for more unfulfilling scraps
Slither in bile for just a few miserable ones
And preserve the precious fruits of your labor

Struggle with all your strength
Mulish and bitter but spiteful,
You wallow in your sludge without going anywhere
Oh thou the worthless

Scream your lungs out to no avail as youâre fading away
Your sharpest, most piercing yells are unheard
For they join the cacophony of the worms which cannot be distinguished
The abhorred din of vacuity

Keep the pot boiling, get angered, thereâs no way to be resigned before your last breath
Embrace your fate Youâre doomed to perish with dry, half rotten crumbs in your dismal mouth

As your remains will be served inside a shabby coffin painfully purchased with your very last saving
Your siblings will all celebrate your demise by devouring your meagre body and feasting on your leftovers
