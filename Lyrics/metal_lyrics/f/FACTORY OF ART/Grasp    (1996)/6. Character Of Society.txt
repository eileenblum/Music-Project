Here you sitting now and your brain's like
confined. Never you have thought you could fall so
deep into dirt. You're a kind of separation of this
society. You know you're near the suicide, no one
helps, you're not right. You're ready now to turn
off the lights. Even god who always stood by your
side, hopeful light, leaves you now, wind keeps
your cry

What's behind the face of this society.
What's inside of you and me.
Now you know the real character of this society.

Everyone is waiting for the end of your part.
Cause this world needs just people of prime
quality. False tears after your death is all they
leave to you. Oh I'm sorry but here rules religion,
sex and force, what a nice age we're living in. Even
god who always stood by your side, that's not
right, he did nothing he's not there.

What's behind the face of this society.
What's inside of you and me.
Now you know the real character of us,
the character of you and me.
