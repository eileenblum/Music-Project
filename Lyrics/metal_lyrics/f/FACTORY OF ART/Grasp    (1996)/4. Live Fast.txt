You stand in front of the mirror,
the night is young but you don't know
how can you light the fire.
Come on step out of the shadow,
we want to show you the signs of time,
come out, don't hesitate!

Once is your life, now or never.
Wake up to go your way!

Live fast, living free, stay young.
Live fast, living free, stay young.

How long you've been waiting
for the highlight of your life?
Just move your ass before death will overtake
you cause there's an end for everybody,
also for you

Once is your life, now or never.
Wake up to go your way!

Live fast, living free, stay young.
Live fast, living free, stay young.

In the dark you wake up
and it's time to save your mind.

Live fast, living free, stay young.
Live fast, living free, stay young.
Live fast, living free, stay young.
Live fast, living free, stay young.
Live fast, stay young,
Live fast, stay young,
Live fast.
