He's coming to us step by step
nearer and nearer but you can't hear him
and he knows everything
about you and your sins.
Never dare to show him
your eyes your looks could betray.
Dirty thoughts belong
behind a wall of plate glass.

Everywhere you go, everything he knows.

Until the end of time we're living like on fire.
You can take every chance but the flames
will be leaping higher and higher.

We love the risk because it's giving us
the power we need to go some ways.
We just can't get enough,
it's rolling you can't stop it again.
This is the age we're living in,
no way back you will see.
Only a question of time, too late to stop it now.

Till the end of ways, till the end of days.

Until the end of time we're living like on fire.
You can take every chance but the flames
will be leaping higher and higher.
