Sunday morning, rising sun,
I hear the voice from heaven now
and listen to the bells.
Jesus Christ I come to you,
my parents said
you speak the true,
but I don't know why.
words from you come
to me so unreal,
so far away from me.
can you ever
understand what I feel,
your image don't see.

never dying hero
to your mind I can't stay.
never dying hero
to a phantom never pray.
never dying hero
see you on judgement day.
never dying hero.

your revenge comes right from the stars,
your blood runs in so many wars which
you could never win.
your tears are falling down on earth,
the rivers, oceans overflow
to drown your sins in unexpiated sins.
people say the
lord is everywhere.
you see all what we do.
why do you accept
when we make mistakes.
you let us kill the world.

never dying hero
to your mind I can't stay.
never dying hero
to a phantom never pray.
never dying hero
see you on judgement day.
never dying hero.

never dying hero
to your mind I can't stay.
never dying hero
to a phantom never pray.
never dying hero
to your mind I can't stay.
never dying hero
see you on judgement day.
