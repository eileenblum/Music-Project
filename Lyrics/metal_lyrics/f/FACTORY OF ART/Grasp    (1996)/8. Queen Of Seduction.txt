We are a clean society, sensible sense of shame.
You are the dirty side of life, personified sin.
They are the prayer of true love, giving real
satisfaction. You are a stigma on the mirror,
disfigure the face.

We want you, we need you, we love you, you got
to be the black in white. We hate you, we buy, we
kill you, aim of sick morality.

You make that feeling so fine by your sensual
delight. Make secret dreams come true but the
delecation has its price.

You can profane the truthful purity of marriage. We
have no chance to deprive of your magic influence.
How can we tell the children clearly what we do.
How can we use your service without consequences.

We want you, we need you, we love you, you got
to be the black in white. We hate you, we buy, we
kill you, aim of sick morality.

You make that feeling so fine by your sensual
delight. Make secret dreams come true but the
delecation has its price.

We are, we are, you are, how can we use your
service, you are, how can we use your service
without consequences.
