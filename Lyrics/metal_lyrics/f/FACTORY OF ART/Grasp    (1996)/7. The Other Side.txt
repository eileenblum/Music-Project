I don't know some things about me,
things from next to me,
sometimes I feel down and dirty,
sometimes I feel free.
Life in gratitude for clearly lights
leads me in my dreams,
but when I'm awake at midnight
comes the fear of the dark.
Feel the fear of daily ignorance,
feel the fear is filling out my brain.

I come to the other side to see I change my mind.
I come to the other side, my friends I left behind.

Black and white are fighting inside me,
the victim's always me.
Wounds are covering soul and body
but you can't see it.
During the day I am a man
which never hurts you.
In protection of obscurity
I'm howling to the moon.
Moonlight's shining deep inside my head,
the moonlight's breaking up my jail.

I come to the other side, I could no longer hide.
I come to the other side, I look for what I find.

I come to the other side to see I change my mind.
I come to the other side, my friends I left behind.
I come to the other side, I could no longer hide.
I come to the other side, I look for what I find.
