Eternal dissatisfaction is wearing down my brain,
I'm going down but I do not care.
My Hands are touching the sky
while my feet are near the hell,
It's difficult to keep the glam in my eyes.
I'd lie for you and you are lie for me,
destroy each other in ignorance.

Always on the run, always be in search.
You'll dare the long way to the hight
or never you'll see the light.

My dirty pussy at home would do
all these things for me
but even this cannot make me high.
The bridges are back to myself
I've crashed in the night
because I can go so many ways.
Thousand moments of changes,
falling down into my life,
can decide if I lose or win.

Always on the run, always be in search.
You'll dare the long way to the hight
or never you'll see the light.

Till the end of ways, till the end of days.

Always on the run, always be in search.
You'll dare the long way to the hight,
always on the run, always be in search.
You'll dare the long way to the hight
or never you'll see the light.
