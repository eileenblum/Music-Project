last night I'm going down the body's of betrayers
thats the bridge to my reborn
Under my feet is a river full of blood from the forlorn souls
jailers of false lord

thats not the twilight zone or gates to paradise
this great wide open door to my illumination

can hear all the lies
it's in my head
I must banish this
with burning pain
get out from my way
the last temptation
can you hear my screams
my sweet salvation

[Chorus]
I'm walking on fire
the flames burning higher
thats my last desire
I'm walking on fire

I go barefooted of the glow and the flames divide for me
my salvation never ending agony
in this world is a little piece from me as way to my wounded soul
a way to loose my mystery

I'm a chessman and must get down from this dirty square
you can play this game to the end without me

[Chorus]

in the crackle of fire
I can hear a crying
of a little forlorn child
I must banish this
with burning pain
get out from my way
the last temptation
can you hear my screams
my sweet salvation
