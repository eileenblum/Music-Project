Big saviour great leader lord of triumph and agony
show us the way to a better life and give us a fast victory
big saviour great leader we are your shield and your sword
and when we've fallen on the battle field
bring our enemies death with your words
praise the lord and die afraid of him

[Chorus:]
the mass was celebrated at a place of blood and destruction
the mass was created in a spirit of greed and corruption

big saviour great leader we follow the gregarious instinct
you turn us from sheep to wolves and we commit in your name bestial things
praise the lord and die afraid of him
