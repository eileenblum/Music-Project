What have you done to my head?
I walk into the light
You are sweet medicine
Out of the night
I see the angel in white
The visions are real
You are my saviour
I'm not forlorn I'm reborn

[Bridge]
She lays her fingers on my open wounds
To dry up my hot bloody streams
And her cool hand is placed on my forehead
Takes away the fever, the pain of my dreams

[Chorus]
You can heal my soul, wake my love
My temptation, hear my call
You can heal my heart, save my soul
Touch my body, you are my fall

A little apple pie is not enough
I have a great hunger for love
I want to drink from your lips
The sweet nectar of love, I can't get enough
Your hot breath is on my ear, your hands are stroking my skin
flashes through my mind, the healing with a sweet therapy
sweet words coming from your mouth, blabber from faithfulness
I choke with my tongue, our love is so strong

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

I lay in my bed all by myself, in the shadow of the night
A dream is creeping into this room, I see your face in the warm light
I see a sharp blade in my hand, your nurse's uniform
is drenched with blood
