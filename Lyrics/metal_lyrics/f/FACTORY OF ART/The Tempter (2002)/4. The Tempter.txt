in the night I find to you and call your number
I'm creep under the load of my chains
the torture never stop
I must last my miserable life can go this short way
cables guide in my past time my negative impulse

[Chorus:]
call me The Tempter
help me with my pain
I'm Doctor Tempter
torture in my brain
I'm the fake healer
give me medicine to get the power

in my dreams I see the light a near wide open door
I need a leader with healing hands must pull me out of dark

[Chorus]

from the fire make of agony slide in cold seas
I rip the cables out of my flesh forget my past life
