round and round in a circle of high walls
feel like an animal
step by step I'm waiting for the fall
in a cage without a light
day by day claustrophobia in my head
can't get out of this place
night by night waiting nightmares in my bed
every day another fight

[Chorus:]
this is the story of pain - day by day
feel like down in hell - day by day
another day of violence
feel like down in hell
another day as prisoner

stone for stone are hanging on my feet
cannot out of this place
by and by forget the time when I was free
in a cage without a light

[Repeat Chorus]

round and round without a light - light
can't get out
day by day an animal
day by day
