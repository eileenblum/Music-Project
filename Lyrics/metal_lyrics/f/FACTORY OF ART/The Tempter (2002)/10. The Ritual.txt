[Meister / Schmikale]

I see tears in your eyes, the refreshment what I need
and the blood in your hands, the sealing wax of our league

feel the power of this moment
the control over sacrifice
you are shiver and whine
for this little life

[Chorus]
welcome in my night, this is the end of all your days
welcome in your hell, to bring about the ritual

see the shine of candlelights , its not warm but cold as ice
and the blade in your hands is are glittering in my eyes

feel the power of this moment
the control over sacrifice
you are shiver and whine
for this little life

[Chorus]

feel the power of this moment
the control over sacrifice
you are shiver and whine
for this little life
