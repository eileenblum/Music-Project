I walk alone into my night
and not a light are shining bright
step by step I go into my hell
I feel like hunting animal

I hear the sounds of thousand sirens
in this streets of violence

every day I need my medicine
in my prison full of gloomy dreams

[Chorus]
without light I drown in my agony
without light in this goddamned dark deep sea

my nerves send me seven signs
please give me back the painless times

I hear the sound of thousand sirens
in this streets of violence

[Chorus]

I'm a fallen angel
can a god destroy himself
who is doctor tempter
where is doctor tempter
and who is this man in the mirror

feel the fire
in my nerves
give me please
medicine

[Chorus]
