proud like a god I've driven on the streets
strong and almighty
I have heard the warning in my dreams
I've waited for the flash me stops the crash
into the silence of my dirty cell
the loneliness kills me
the misgiving from a life after the jail
I have survived and sneer in your face

[Chorus]
I have seen a dying friend
and every pain find to the end
and when I look into my eyes
I cry out in the mirror
no tears no tears no tears but more fears

I sell the visions out of my brain
I am benumb me
see through the milk glass the endless rain

make of my bloody tears I feel the fear
into the silence of this dirty room
the loneliness kills me
the reality of this life after the jail
I must survive and sneer in your face

[Chorus]

into the silence of this dirty room
the damned headache kills me
in sweet dreams arise a beauty in my head
but without a help I can never see the good times
