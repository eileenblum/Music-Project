the twilight zone is my last way
thousands of moments race past my eyes
the teardrops wither away when I say goodbye
in heaven or hells fire in twilight zone

[Chorus:]
the twilight zone is my last way
the twilight zone the end of the game
the twilight zone is my last way

endless drops of sinnerblood will run out my veins
and deep obscurity overcomes my brain
I throw out my pain into the darkness of twilight zone
