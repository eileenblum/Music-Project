can feel the power
and I see the signs
no questions, no more agony
the end of painful times

I don't see the darkness
I don't feel the rain
let the shadows out of my head
the impulse of my pain ...

Why? I need a doctor?
Why? (I) need medicine?
My life was a dirty game
(I) was born to lose not win

[Bridge]
You stand beside me
tell me who I am
I'm a god stand next to you
the rage for all your sins

[Chorus]
Don't stop the god
you can't stop the gods
you can't stop a little piece from me
you're shivering dogs I'm a god
my power is locked including
from glowing iron
the key to it you never find

Why? Hold the pain me slavish
I was not born for creep
let me do for you the biggest things
whatever you have seen

[Bridge / Chorus]
