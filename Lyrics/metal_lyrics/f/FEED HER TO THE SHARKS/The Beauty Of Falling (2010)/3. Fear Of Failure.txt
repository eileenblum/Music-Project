I have seen where the frail die
They are slain by their weakness
The fear to try
They are the fallen, and they have cheated themselves
Break this bridge now

When did you sacrifice?
When did you dedicate your life?
To strive for something more
Did you eliminate
The walls standing in your way?
And rise from the fear of your failure

If your eyes are waiting
To see this life
Forever changing

Did you give your...
Did you give your heart, your blood?
That's why you have become forsaken
You have lied to yourself
And you have died because
You did not give enough
And you'll regret this 'til the day you die

If your eyes are waiting
To see this life
Forever changing
Then you are falling from reality

You have lied to yourself
And you have lied to us all

[2x]
If your eyes are waiting
To see this life
Forever changing
Then you are falling from reality

We will rise up
And you will die with a bleeding heart
Envious!
