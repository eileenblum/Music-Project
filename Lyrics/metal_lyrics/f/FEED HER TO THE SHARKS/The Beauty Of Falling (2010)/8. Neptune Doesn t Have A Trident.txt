Down in the water
Drowned by the sea
She sleeps in a floating graveyard waiting for me

And it destroyed my heart
It takes a man to kill the beast
(it takes a man to kill the monster)

Lacerate, cut this life away from me
Paralyzed, I survived to kill the enemy
Cut this life away
Open my eyes to a brand new day
I must never let this life sleep away (with no regrets)

No regrets
My emptiness is gone
For I have wept too long
Waiting for these scars to mend
So I can carry on

(It takes a man to kill the monster)
(It takes a man to defeat the beast)

Clarity, I can see for the first time
I rise from insecurity
And so I embrace until the end to what I fucking sold
I must never let this life wither away

No regrets
My emptiness is gone
For I have wept too long
Waiting for these scars to mend
So I can carry on

Down in the water
Drowned by the sea
She sleeps in a floating graveyard and she's waiting for me

Down in the water
Drowned by the sea
Lies the emptiness that lived inside me

Down in the water
Drowned by the sea
Dies the sickness
The poison
That mutilated me...

Let the fucking bitch drown!

Down in the water
Drowned by the sea
She sleeps in a floating graveyard
And it destroyed my heart
It takes a man to kill the...
