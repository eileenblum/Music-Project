Will I fall to pieces?
Standing strong
Hope is all that remains
That's all that remains

I have shed my blood
I have wept these tears
Am I forsaken?
Am I set to fail?
My dreams are yet to become reality
And my time is running out

Searching for the answers
Hoping for a change
How long until my world comes crashing down?

[2x]
Will I fall to pieces on this darkest day?
Will I rise from ruins to victory?

I will not rest
I will not sleep
Until this curse is lifted from me

I will not rest
I will not sleep
Until this curse is lifted from me

Will I fall to pieces on this darkest day?
Will I rise from ruins to victory?

And I will not spend another day
In this hell [3x]
Not spend another day in hell

I will not rest
I will not sleep
Until this curse is lifted from me
From me [3x]

Will I fall to pieces on this darkest day?
Will I rise from ruins to resurrect my dreams?

I'll never fucking burn in hell!
I'll never burn in hell [4x]
