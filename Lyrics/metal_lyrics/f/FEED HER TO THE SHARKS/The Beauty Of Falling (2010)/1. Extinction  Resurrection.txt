There was a time that I would hate myself [2x]
Searching for solace
Consumed my loneliness
There was a time my identity was lost
And my everthing was torn to pieces
Lets go!

(she nearly killed me)
(it's like she's breathing down my neck)

She nearly killed me
Just like a vampire on my neck
Draining my entity to emptiness
Two worlds apart I cannot live this way
Why did I promise?
Why did I promise to change?

'Til the day I die
I will never change
Try to burn me alive with conformity

But it's too late, let go of me
This is who I am
I will never change

But I'm haunted by the memory
Of a promise that I couldn't keep
And I can't escape this guilt inside me
It never sleeps

But it's too late, let go of me
This is who I am [2x]

'Til the day I die
I will never change
You can stab me with the knife of conformity

But it's too late, let go of me
This is who I am
I will never change

There was a time that I would hate myself
Searching for solace
Consumed my loneliness [2x]

But it's too late, let go of me
This is who I am
I will never change!
Let go of me!

But I'm haunted by the memory
Of a promise that I couldn't keep
And I can't escape this guilt inside me
This is who I am
I will never change!
