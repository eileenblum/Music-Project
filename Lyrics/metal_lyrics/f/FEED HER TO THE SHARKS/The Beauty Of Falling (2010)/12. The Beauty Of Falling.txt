I watched her die [2x]
Waste away
And crumble to the ground
Fallen from the grace of paradise
She wonders why
She wonders why
Let me tell you

The day she slipped from reality
Was the day she locked herself away
To scream a silent scream
Looking back she had everything
More promise than you could ever dream
I could see her falling...
I watched her die
I watched her eyes fall back
To see her smile fade away
And she screams...
Let me go
Let me walk alone
Leave me in the dark
You have held my hand
For far too long...

I watched her die
I watched her eyes fall back
To see her smile fade away
And she screams...
Let me go
Let me walk alone
You have held my hand
For far too fucking long...

Now this face is a memory
And I am left with nothingness
She meant the world to me
Looking back she had everything
More promise than she could fucking see
I could see her falling...
Down

Let go
And she screams
Let me go
Let me walk alone
Leave me in the dark
You have held my hand
For far too long...
Goodbye my love
All that's left in my heart
Is memories...
But it wont be long
Before this darkness dies
And the sun rises up

Goodbye my love
All that's left in my heart
Is memories...
But it wont be long
Before this darkness dies
And the sun rises up
