Feed Her To The Sharks!

Twelve months of misery
Stab me in the heart and watch me bleed
I was nothing but a puppet
Strung by the hands and feet
Strung by the hands and feet
And I'm...
Searching
For a reason
To believe your fucking lies
Oblivious
Your treason
Is killing me inside

With the smile
Of a thousand knives
Stone cold in her malice
She walks away
She walks away from her deviance

Oblivious to everything
Her black heart sleeps in a dead dream
No willingness to compromise
'Cause she thinks she's royalty

Stab me
In the heart
And watch me fucking bleed
Stab me
In the heart
And watch me
Fall to pieces!

With the smile
Of a thousand knives
Stone cold in her malice
She walks away [2x]

Twelve months of misery
Stab me in the heart
Watch me bleed
Bury me
In a blood soaked tourniquet

Oblivious
Blinded by the greed
In your heart
Oblivious

Go!

Stab me in the heart
Watch me bleed
Stab me in the heart
Watch me bleed
You fucking bitch!
You fucking!
