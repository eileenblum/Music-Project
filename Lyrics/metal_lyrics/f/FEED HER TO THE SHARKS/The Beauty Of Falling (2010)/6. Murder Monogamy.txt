I defy this lying world
The place of broken dreams
Beat my chest with an iron fist
On my heart of purity

It won't be long before the rain comes falling from the heavens
I sing this song in desperation
'Cause I fear that we are killing ourselves

Confess you were never content
To be with no else but me
We regress because you undress
Fucking anything that you see, you see

MURDER IS IN THE AIR
KILLING US BY DECEIT, BY DECEIT

It won't be long before the rain comes falling down
It won't be long before the rain comes falling down from the heavens
And I sing this song in desperation
Because I fear that we are killing ourselves
I fear that we are killing ourselves

Here comes a rain [4x]

Get out
Right now
Or this will fucking end in violence, end in violence!

MURDER IS IN THE AIR
KILLING US BY DECEIT, BY DECEIT
Now we say goodbye to this monogamy

It's too late
She's lost her way
For all she knows is everything's OK
Can't you see that all we had is lost
I'm trying to bury the dream alive
You have destroyed yourself
For the last time

It's too late
She's lost her way
For all she knows is everything's OK
Can't you see that all we had is lost

Certainly
She's lost her way...
