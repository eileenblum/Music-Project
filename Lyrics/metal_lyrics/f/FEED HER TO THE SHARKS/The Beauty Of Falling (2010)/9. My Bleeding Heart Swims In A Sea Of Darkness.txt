Watch as I wither away
And fall into darkness again...

When will I break away...
The chains to my dying heart?
Falling to darkness will I fade away?

When will I see this day...
Before my hope is lost?
Falling to darkness will I waste away?

Have I wasted my time watching others live?
They will surpass me
Have I been wasting?
I've been wasting my life
I am the sheep eaten by the wolves tonight

Release me from this world
Just let me go
Free my eyes from deception

Now I refuse to wait
In the shadows of my past
Falling to darkness will I fade away?

Now I must break away
And reclaim everything I've lost
(for I have wasted away)

I've been wasting my life
I am the sheep
Eaten by the wolves tonight

When will I break away the chains to my heart?
My bleeding heart swims in a sea of darkness (in the sea of darkness)
Hope is not lost

Swimming to save my life
My bleeding heart will never die
I won't succumb to the darkness
Watch as I break away the chains to my heart
I will now embrace and weather this storm

Swimming to save my life
My bleeding heart will never die
I won't succumb

[2x]
When will I break away the chains to my heart?
My bleeding heart swims in a sea of darkness (in the sea of darkness)
