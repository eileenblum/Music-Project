How many times must be burn and break?
I've never felt so faithless
How much more can we take?
When will this vicious cycle break?
We're treading water
Have we gone insane?
Are we living a lie, stuck in a dream?
A beautiful nightmare
I'm burning alive, you live in ecstasy
Now I'm losing faith in everything
Give me the strength to walk away
How many times must burn and break?
I've never felt so faithless
Your paradise is my misery
Still the darkness holds us down
You think it's love, your self-sadistic ways
Your condescending words
Your malice and deceit
Wake the fuck up, cunt
You think it's love to lie and cheat
You stole my innocence from me
You'll never know what love is
Why am I standing here in misery?
How many times must we burn and break?
I've never felt so faithless
Your paradise is my misery
Still the darkness holds us down
You think it's love
Give me the strength to break these chains
Your love is contagious, it's a fucking disease
I'm giving up on everything
When will this vicious cycle break?
We're spinning out of control
We've got to fight our demons cause we're killing ourselves
This is the end of paradise
I'm not a slave to your fucked up romance
Goodbye
How many times must we burn and break?
I've never felt so faithless
Your paradise is my misery
Still the darkness holds us down
We're running out of chances
And I have nothing more to give
Still the darkness holds us down
