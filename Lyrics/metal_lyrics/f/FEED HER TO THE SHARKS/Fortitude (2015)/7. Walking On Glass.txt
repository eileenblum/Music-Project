You wanna fuck the world and watch it burn
You drank the blood of the innocent
You wanna fuck the world and watch it burn
You'll never destroy us and you'll never tear us down
Don't waste your breath
Don't waste another breath on your hollow promises
You never gave us one fucking chance
You left us hanging by a thread
Now I'm living with rage, screaming with hate
After eighteen months of hell
You'd love to deny your faults and your crimes
You used us and spat us out
You wanna fuck the world and watch it burn
You drank the blood of the innocent
You can't destroy us and bury the past
Bet it felt so good, like walking on glass
Felt so good, just like walking on glass
You're a fraud, a fake, a rat in a cage
We've heard enough hypocrisy
And we will never forget the lies that you fed
Your words are like a fucking disease
You wanna fuck the world and watch it burn
You drank the blood of the innocent
You can't destroy us and bury the past
Bet it felt so good, like walking on glass
Go fuck yourself
You drank the blood of the innocent
And we'll never forget
The way you watched our world crash down
You wanna fuck the world
You wanna fuck the world and watch it burn
