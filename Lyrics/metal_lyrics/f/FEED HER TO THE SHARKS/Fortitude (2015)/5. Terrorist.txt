You're a coward, just face it
You're nothing but a gutless terrorist
You can't break us, won't defeat us
This is the land of the free and we'll stamp you out
We will never succumb to the voice of hate
Faceless scum
No!
You will never strike fear in the hearts of the young, the brace
Our daughters and sons
Lay down your fucking guns
The sky is raining blood
We'll fight
We'll bring the beast to its knees
And feed the bastard justice
You're a coward, just face it
You are the voice of hatred
So callous, so pathetic
You're nothing but a gutless terrorist
You're nothing but a murderous piece of shit
Nothing you say will pay for your sins
You sacrifice the innocent
These heavy hearts will never forget
This is war
Lay down your fucking guns
The sky is raining blood
We'll fight
We'll bring the beast to its knees
This is war
Bow down, feel the wrath of justice
You're a coward, just face it
You are the voice of hatred
So callous, so pathetic
You're nothing but a gutless terrorist
We'll carry on, we'll stand as one
We'll never surrender the love in our hearts
We'll carry on, we'll stand as one
These broken wings will fly once more
We'll carry on
