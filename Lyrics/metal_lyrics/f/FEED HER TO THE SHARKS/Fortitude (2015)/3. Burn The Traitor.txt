I watched you stab me in the back
Would you break my fucking neck for the price of fame?
Keep your friends close
Leave your enemies screaming in the grave
Look into the eyes of a traitor, the man who wants it all
He'll sell you down the river
Watch you as you fall
No conscience, no resent
Running from the consequence
So fucking shameless
Now it's time to taste your fate
Nothing can save you now
The ghosts of the past will drag you down
You've made an enemy, now pay the penalty
You will face the pain of retribution
We're coming for you
Burn the traitor
You left us all forsaken
And now you'll dance with the devil
As you rot in fucking hell
Six feet underground
You can't run from the consequences
Witness the act of vengeance, nothing can save you now
Witness the darkest affliction, as the heavens strike you down
Look into the eyes of a traitor, the man who wants it all
He'll sell you down the river, watch you as you fall
You can run from the consequences
And we will never forget this
Burn the traitor
You left us all forsaken
And now you'll dance with the devil
As you rot in fucking hell
Six feet underground
You're a liar, you're a traitor
We will hunt you down
We're coming for you
Burn the traitor
You left us all forsaken
And now you'll dance with the devil
As you rot in fucking hell
Six feet underground
