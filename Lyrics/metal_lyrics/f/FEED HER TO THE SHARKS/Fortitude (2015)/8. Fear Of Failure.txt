I have seen where the frail die
They are slain by their weakness
The fear to try
They are the fallen, and they have cheated themselves
Break this bridge now
When did you sacrifice?
When did you dedicate your life?
To strive for something more
Did you eliminate...
The walls standing in your way?
And rise from the fear of your failure
IF YOUR EYES ARE WAITING
TO SEE THIS LIFE
FOREVER CHANGING
THEN YOU HAVE FALLEN FROM REALITY
Did you give your heart...
Your blood?
That s why you have become forsaken
You have lied to yourself
And you have died because
You did not give enough
And you ll regret this till the day you die
You have lied to yourself
And you have lied to us all
We will rise up
And you will die with a bleeding heart
Envious!
