I've spent my whole damn life
Fighting through adversity
No mountain was too high
I swam the depths of Savage Seas
Now I'm fucking drowning
My dreams are paralyzed
And all that I've been yearning
Is fading like a candle in the night
Can you save me now?
Lift me off the ground
I need you more than ever
Will you save me now?
I'm reaching for the surface
I'm searching for the light
Reach out your hand and save my life
Stay with me, give me the strength
I've got to break away from this nightmare
Every day I look in the mirror
And all I see is a shadow of myself
Can you save me from the deepest darkest dreams?
From the depths of agony?
I will never perish with you by my side
It's time to turn this life around
Pick the pieces off the ground
I'll resurrect the future that belongs to me
I'm never giving up
I will never say goodbye
I'm reaching for the surface
I'm searching for the light
Reach out your hand and save my life
It's everything I live for
I'm fighting for a chance
Reach out and take my hand
Stay with me, give me the strength
I've got to break away from this nightmare
Every day I look in the mirror
And all I see is a shadow of myself
Can you save me now?
Lift me off the ground
I need you more than ever
Will you save me now?
