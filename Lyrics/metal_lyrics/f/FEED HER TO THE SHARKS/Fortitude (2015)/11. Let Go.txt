And I will never walk in your footsteps of deception
I'll never hang my head in shame
I see the beauty in your eyes forever fading with these lies
Your words meant nothing all this time
She smiles at me, I hold her close
And in this moment time has stopped
It's a bitter place, it's an ugly world
She hides a secret no one knows
No one knows her secret
I know what you are
I'll never let you steal the good in me and poison my soul
You fucking bitch
And I will always follow my heart and my convictions
I'll always hold my head up high
I've found the bravery to follow my own destiny
Your fading memory is what will set me free
She smiles at me, I hold her close
And in this moment time has stopped
It's a bitter place, it's an ugly world
She hides a secret no one knows
Let fucking go
I've found the bravery
I've found the air to breathe
Your fading memory is what will set me free
Will set me free
She smiles at me, I hold her close
And in this moment time has stopped
I should've walked away
I should've let you go
Maybe I'm better off alone
She smiles at me, I hold her close
And in this moment time has stopped
It's a bitter place, it's an ugly world
For all this time she was someone else
Someone else
