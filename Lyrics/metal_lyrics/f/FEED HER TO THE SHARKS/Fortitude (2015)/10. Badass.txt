Wasted on the ground
The night's just begun and he's passing out
He's the life of the party, he'll never change
He lives every moment to the extreme
He's a badass, haven't you heard?
He's got a one-way ticket to the underworld
This guy's as tough as nails
Wakes up to his surprise
He's had another wet dream
But he's 25
He couldn't get a girlfriend to save his life
Even on a website!
He still lives at home with his mom
And his best friend calls him DRAGON WARRIOR
This guy's on level 305 on Candy Crush
Never look him in the eye
'Cause he will fuck you up
He's a badass
Haven't you heard?
He's got a one-way ticket to the underworld
They say he's wild!
He's tough!
This guy is dangerous!
He's got a one-way ticket and he's never coming back
So lock your doors
Here comes the one-man wolf pack
He's on the loose and he's breaking all the rules
And he says
"Fuck your rules, I'll live my life
The way I want, there's no turning back
Fuck your world, I'll live my life
The way I want, 'til the day I die"
He's a badass
He's a renegade
There's a fire in his eyes
No one can tame
He's a badass
Haven't you heard?
He's got a one-way ticket to the underworld
They he's wild!
He's tough!
This guy is dangerous!
He's got a one-way ticket to the underworld
He's dangerous
