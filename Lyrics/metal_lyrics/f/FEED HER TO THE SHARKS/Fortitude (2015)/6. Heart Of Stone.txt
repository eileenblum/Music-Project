There was a time I would run from the light of day
Cut myself from the human race
Reaching out there was nothing to find
I was a dead man searching for a second life
Shipwrecked, I'm a castaway
I'm a self-destructing disaster piece
I've walked this road alone for far too long
And all that I love is gone
There was a time I was blind
When I was plagued with suicide
I tried everything I could to survive
This fucking goddamn nightmare
I was reckless, I was cold
I turned every heart to stone
And I walked on the broken bones
Of the innocent lives I've left behind
I've burnt every bridge I know
I won't look back
Turned every heart to stone
With no regrets
With no regrets and no remorse
Nothing will reverse the world of tears and pain
That I brought you every day
I'm sorry and I beg for forgiveness
If I could go back in time and erase the pages
I would treat every day as if it was my last
I've burnt every bridge I know
Turned every heart to stone
I can't believe the monster I've become
And there's no one left to save me but myself
I've burnt every bridge I know
I won't look back
Turned every heart to stone
With no regrets
Would you forgive me for all my wrongs?
Would you release me from chains and thorns?
And there is one thing that you should know
If I could go back again, I'd change it all
With no regrets
