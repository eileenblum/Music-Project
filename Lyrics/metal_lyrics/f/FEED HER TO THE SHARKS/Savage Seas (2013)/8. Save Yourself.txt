My hate lives on
Let the bitterness be gone

And you have played the innocent too long
Unveil your mask and show the world who you are
I watched from a distance
To see you destroy your existence
Betraying everything you love

Where is your fucking conscience?
Can you save yourself?
With eyes wide open
Can't you see the blood on your hands?
Is the weight of the world on your shoulders?
I will show you a pain you will never forget

All that you know will crumble
You'll fall to your knees
The world seeks judgment from your wretched disease
And you will burn for your mistakes
And we will cast you out like a witch on the stake [2x]

My hate lives on

I refuse to live another day
I refuse to let this bitterness live on
Be gone
Just let this bitterness be gone

Can you save yourself?
With eyes wide open
Can't you see the blood on your hands?
Is the weight of the world on your shoulders?
I will show you a pain you will never forget
Forget

How can you sleep?
Where is your fucking conscience?
You are the thorn in my side
You are the poison in my lungs
My hate lives on
