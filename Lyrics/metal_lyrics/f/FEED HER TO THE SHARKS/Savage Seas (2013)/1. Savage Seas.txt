We are Feed her to the Sharks!

We've come a long way
Come so far
Won't rest till we get what we deserve
We won't rest, with this breath
I scream from the top of my lungs
We will triumph
From the bottom of my heart
We won't rest

Risen from a Savage Sea
Of broken corpses and treachery
We have a secret, the will to survive
The weak choke and die
But we are still standing

Risen from a Savage Sea
We are young, destined
We can be anything we can dream
They say it's darkest just before the dawn
Hope everything we yearn succumbs
We are destined

We the strong are the last ones standing
In the dark we refuse to die
Break the chains of oblivion, soon
It won't be long 'til our dreams ignite

Watch the torches burn

Here we come, destined
This is our time
Watch the torches burn
Won't rest till we get what we deserve

We the strong are the last ones standing
In the dark we refuse to die
Break the chains of oblivion, soon
It won't be long 'til our dreams ignite

Risen from a Savage Sea
We have come so far we will never concede
Nothing can stop us now
Now it's time to conquer the world
Mother Fuckers!
We are the last ones standing
We will never look back
