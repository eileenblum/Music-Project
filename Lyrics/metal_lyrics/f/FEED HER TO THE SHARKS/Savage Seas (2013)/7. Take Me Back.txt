Take me back to yesterday

Take me back to the golden city
Miles away from the bitter place I reside
Take me back tonight

Flashback to yesterday
I was headstrong with so much certainty
But I will never give up on myself today
The world won't break my destiny

Never give up
Never deny
The life that you dreamed of, don't watch it die

Take me back to yesterday
When I was young, sorrow seemed so far away
Take me back to yesterday
I know we're dying, but we still hold on to faith

I tell myself I won't lay down and die
One foot in the grave, but I will survive this torment
I won't be defeated, I stand strong
I will never give up on myself today
The world won't break my destiny

Never give up
Never deny
The world that you dreamed of, just take it

Take me back to yesterday
When I was young, sorrow seemed so far away
Take me back to yesterday
I know we're dying, but we still hold on to faith

Take me back to the golden city
Miles away from the bitter place I reside
Take me back tonight

Take me back to yesterday
I know we're dying, but we still hold on to faith

I'll never kill my dreams until the end
They'll shine so brightly
It means everything to me

Take me back to yesterday
When I was young, sorrow seemed so far away
Take me back to yesterday
I know we're dying, but we still hold on to faith
