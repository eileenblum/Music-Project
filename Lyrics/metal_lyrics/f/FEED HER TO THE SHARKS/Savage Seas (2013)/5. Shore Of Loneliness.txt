Lying to myself, you were just a dream
My malice destroyed us; I set your heart ablaze
I watch you fall to ashes, fear my death anxiety

I perish; I descend
To a world of loneliness
What do I live for?
If i poison every soul dear to me...
I would fall asleep right now
But I can't rest
With a guilty conscience haunting me
And she burns to a cinder

My malice destroyed us
You were only just a dream
Why must I burn bridges?
I watched her fall to ashes
By the hand of my destruction
Won't you sail with me?

Even in death you're beside me
Wish I could see
That our dream is dead and buried
Even in death I'm sorry
'Cause the times we had
Were the best days of my life

Sail with me; into descent
To this Shore of Loneliness
Say goodbye; as I fall into pieces
The light inside of me is dead
Broken
Everything is dead
An empty vessel is all that's left
An empty vessel is all I am

Even in death you're beside me
Wish I could see
That our dream is dead and buried
Even in death I'm sorry
'Cause the times we had
Were the best days of my life

Sail with me; into descent
To this Shore of Loneliness
Say goodbye; as I fall into pieces
The light inside of me is dead

Is fucking dead.
