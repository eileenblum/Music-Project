But how could something so beautiful walk like the living dead?
Buried, buried, buried alive
Makes me fucking sick...

I saw the promise in your eyes, trapped inside
Gave my empathy to bring you back to life
But you destroyed yourself as you fell from grace

You waste another day pretending life will fall into place
Stop regressing, descending, going back to your old fucking ways
Back to the grave

Let's go!

Time, time, time again
Why did you lie to yourself and your friends?
You're pathetic
How could you look yourself in the mirror?

Time and time and time again, I brought you back to life
Still you betray
I will not forget this
Listen here you fuck, you're full of shit

But how could something so beautiful walk like the living dead?
Buried, buried, buried alive
Makes me fucking sick...

Now kiss good-bye to what you could have been
You could be anything, many things
Makes me fucking sick...

I saw the promise in your eyes, but you're blind
And you will always play the victim for the rest of your life,
Engulfed by the flames as you fall from grace
You're lying through your teeth
And now your wings shall burn from your act of deception

How can you look in the mirror?
Without you things are so much clearer
How does it feel to be buried alive, you prick?

There is nothing you can do to survive this

But how could something so beautiful walk like the living dead?
Buried, buried, buried alive
Makes me fucking sick...

Now kiss good-bye to what you could have been
You could be anything, many things
Makes me fucking sick...
