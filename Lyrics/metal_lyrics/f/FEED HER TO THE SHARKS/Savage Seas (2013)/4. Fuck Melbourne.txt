Is this what you've become
A shadow of yourself reduced to nothing but a sheep amongst the fools
You're just another glitch in this scene you bitch 
Why can't you be yourself 
You will never impress me with your green eyes 
Two red ribbons on the back of your thighs are saying screw me tonight I've done this before 
I am skin deep and I'll always be a dirt cheap whore 
Every paycheck she lives for the weekend, cracked and jaded as she degrades herself 
There's nothing left but an empty shell
Fuck Melbourne 
Fuck the drainers 
They're on a road to no where 
How long till you wake up from a dead existence 
What have you become?
Fuck the guys with ink on their neck
You think you're cool but you won't win my respect 
You're not a rock star 
You're not famous 
You're just a scene kid dying for attention! 
With sharp teeth I will rip you apart
We are the wolves
Every paycheck he drinks till he's wasted 
Lost and shameless he doesn't fucking know himself 
There's nothing left but an empty shell
Take me far away from this deadbeat town 
Save me from the filth and vermin 
You drained this city from life to ruins
Take me away this is a wasteland
