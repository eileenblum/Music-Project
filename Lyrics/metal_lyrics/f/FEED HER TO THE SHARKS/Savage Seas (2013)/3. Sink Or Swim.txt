The time had come to salvage what I've lost
Give me strength to destroy this fame monster

The stars that shine have blinded my eyes
I've traded fame and lies for the price

It's time to sink or swim
But my heart is sinking to the ocean bed
Time won't wait, I can feel the tides are turning
Will I be swept away?

For the price of my own soul
The devil is calling
You'll never take my soul
Must I?
So callous and blind
Forsaken my identity for the bright city lights

Give me the strength I need to kill this fame monster
Just bring me bravery to face this faceless dream

It's time to sink or swim
But my heart is sinking to the ocean bed
Time won't wait, I can feel the tides are turning
Will I be swept away?

This is my final breath
My day of contempt
As the waves come crashing down,
I weep
I'm so ashamed

I've traded fame and lies
Rip these stars from my eyes, and bring me back to reality
Give me strength
Destroy the demon within and bring me back to reality

It's time to sink or swim
But my heart is sinking to the ocean bed
Time won't wait, I can feel the tides are turning
Will I be swept away?
(I'm sinking)

For the price of my own soul
For the price of my own
