The weights on our shoulders make walking a path that much harder (that much harder). Yes, we could be colder, bitter and faint(fake?) but we endure, yes we endure because life makes it worth it; all the struggle in the end. The pain makes it worth it. It's a
necessary currency.

We are born in the fire. We embrace our desires. We will build ourselves higher. We will breathe and respire. We will surpass all the liars. We will build ourselves higher.

I find it hard to believe that we could be so unhappy. If we didn't know, that it takes the best of the worst. So we could be the best of the best of the best. We must see the breakups of hard times, the breakups of being kind, the breakups of love denied.

We are born in the fire. We embrace our desires. We will build ourselves higher. We will breathe and respire. We will surpass all the liars. We will build ourselves higher.

The day will come, and it will. You will realize everything is worth it. Better yet, you're realize that you enjoyed it, that you enjoyed it. Triumph in its purest form, is realizing love was never gone.
