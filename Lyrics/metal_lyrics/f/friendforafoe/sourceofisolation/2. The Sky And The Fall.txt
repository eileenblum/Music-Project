take a look
(take a look and process the sound)
find a way to
(I'll find a way)
weave the whole
(the fragments allow)
save your own
(save your own or risk all)
violations
(and memory)
be atoned

coming around
all the things
that I've seen, left to die
watch as the force ignites, bright

walking along the fine line
all of the ways I choose to be alone
lost so deep in my mind
caught in the throws of all (you allow)

this could be your perfect life
so take your time
and leave the line
show your maker
it's all for gold
so take your time
and leave the line
whether not we go again
still believe

(so weak)
playing the role human
the subtle role of living within the frame
patient, restless in delay
living a life through my haunted dreams

break through the sky
inhale the fear of the unknown
take your time
and bring yourself to the maker

walking along the fine line
all of the ways I choose to be alone
lost so deep in my mind
caught in the throws of all

we're caught in the throws of it all
collapsing
the internal structure
weep for me
maybe death can bring us
closer
all my life I'm feeling
closer
even time can't save me now

fuck

collapsing
the internal structure
weep for me
maybe death can bring us
closer
nothing
