recall
everything you've made me
the fall of my securities
we all can relate
recall
some will make it over
some make it far under
we won't fail to wait
(c'mon)

now in times of progress
we're moving forward
cycles of birth and decay
returned
protecting all that is clean
torn form the ground
reconnect
then elevate

bow, forever
in the presence of all that is me
bow, surrender
before all that you seek

forever lost
for the pain within yourself
forever lost
slipping away
forever lost
for the past that claims the present
surviving
unscathed

she is the pain that starts the day
and never lets me be
this is the way i never meant to be
and i will walk away

closed now its set aside
unsure, define the line
peace please be for me
more than a word, more than a dream

give me your best shot
and count the open scars
give me your best shot
the flesh is raw
give me your best shot
cleanse yourself within
and just give me your best shot

(so i know to be your home)
faking the patterns of the clever
what a person you've turned out to be
making the moments last forever
when living the dream

[2x:] she is the pain that starts the day
and never lets me be
this is the way i never meant to be
and i will walk away

haunted
by the failure of this type
can you see it with your eyes
you've got to walk away
questions for the faceless lies
brought out by silence
rooted deep inside
grow, grow

(resolved)
faking the patterns of the clever
what a person you've turned out to be
