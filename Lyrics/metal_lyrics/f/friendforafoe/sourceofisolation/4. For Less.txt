obscure, altered
awareness forerun by question
our source confirmed
god's children, so say we all
fractured,
just beneath the frame is nature
seduced by variance
but in truth, we are the same
inside
beneath your pride

there's a spark that grows bright
and brings to view
all of the things you knew
about me
tell me why,
what is behind
fashioned after your kind
the children grow,
coming around through the age
in some expected time
now they're taking to the sky

we will fly
we will find
we will know
the gods are a word on the page

sail away
assured in open arms
(wide open)
waiting for something else
to claim we are
(we are with the stars)
stay awake
remember who you are
(remember)
waiting for something else
to claim we are
(we are bound inside for our time)

deceived
by memory

my potential outlined
the feeble view
all of the people use
to bring shame
tell me why
my value denied
fashioned after your kind
the elders knew
coming around through the age
in some fantastic time
our existence comes to light
we will fly
we will find
we will know
the gods are a word on the page

sail away
assured in open arms
(wide open)
waiting for something else
to claim we are
(we are with the stars)
stay awake
remember who you are
(remember)
waiting for something else
to claim we are
(we are bound inside through out all of our time)

look out into our creation
look up and gaze upon your self

look at me now
the same reflection
mirrored by creation
continued by our mien
look at me now
the same expressions
as observed by yourself
continued through our relics

vagrant under holocaust
searching for a new life
vagrant under holocaust
people thirsting for power
distant culture
overlapping
caught in the tangles of war

reclaim
the final word
the name will be heard
but not understood
if we are to continue
if we are to survive
honor
in accordance
can only support our brethren's
claim
the certain show desire
for unity
the blood that we share
no longer impaired
if we are to continue
if we are to survive
honor
in accordance
can only support our claim
for unity
