Just breathe, Don't say a word.

The empty, consumes me, and buries me so deep,
The empty, consumes me, and buries me so deep,

All that you, could have done,
before the face, of the sun,
burns a mark, upon my heart,
upon my thoughts, discraced and flawed.
Seeking vengence, braced in pride,
seeking the truth, seeking your life.

Nothing can comfort me now, cant say why or how,
this fate was chance, this test of pain, this injustice

This cant be happening, this cant be happening.

[CHORUS:]
in my heart and in my head, consummated by their action, hollow and broken
in my heart and in my head, consummated by their action, shattered and vacant

And your light has left my sight, But your warmth remains with me...
For the love of life I have lost you, please return...

Suddenly taken broken, torn from peace, torn from her beauty,
She tries and she fights, But she cant break free,
Suddenly taken, suddenly broken, she cant breathe,

He takes, he violates, he, spoils, she, she screams
He breaks, her piece by piece, severs the link, between her and peace, Why-------

Nothing can comfort me now, cant say why or how,
this fate was chance, this test of pain, this injustice

This cant be happening, this cant be happening.

[CHORUS repeat]

[Speaking:]
All that you, could have done,
before the face, of the sun,
it burns a mark, upon my heart,
upon my thoughts, discraced and flawed.
Seeking vengence, braced in pride,
seeking truth, seeking the life,
seeking the life, Im seeking your life.

He cant hurt you anymore, No more pain, No more suffering,
He cant hurt you anymore, no more pain, no more suffering.

So empty, this feeling, with out you, its hard to forget,
That Im so empty with these feelings, without you its so hard to forget

Your safe now, in the clouds, or in the ground.....
