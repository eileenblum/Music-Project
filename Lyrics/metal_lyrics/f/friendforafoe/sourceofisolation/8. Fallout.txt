fallen
shadows dance upon a broken wall
faces of the awakened
we'll see them all

vile as a result of the past
the guilty consequence we see on the face of everyone
so wicked, classes of mutation emerge
the instinct to survive, motivates the conscious mind

lost in a world
where the damned walk hand in hand with the living
oh my god
the fallout washes over me

everything of value claimed
everything in the wasteland breathes

the population
decreases, they seek they're shelter
way down beneath
the surface, so contaminated
still they breathe
filthy breeds of human

wait
everything of value claimed
every second counts to me
everything in the wasteland breathes

for my survival
the choices foreseen
the weapons in holding
shall maintain the disease
for my survival
the choices between
the people shall know them
as elements of violence consumes them

so sleep
in the arms of the stars

decayed
statues of the mind decayed
(the flesh reciprocates)
decayed
statues of the mind decayed
(the flesh reciprocates)
the seasons change
(they're crossing over)
with the starved
(let's give them something)

all the infected will burn
they will burn

for my survival
the choices between
the weapons in holding
shall maintain the disease
for my survival
the choices foreseen
the people shall know them
as they burn

save me
from this world
