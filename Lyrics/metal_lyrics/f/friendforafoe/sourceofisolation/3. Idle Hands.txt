they'll come for you
they'll come back to make you suffer
for making light of their world
fantastic crowds
relative to the thoughts of all those abound
they'll take their pound of flesh
within a moments time
and feed it to you

silence sanctioned
for the time
wake up
take in the tide

the source of isolation
begs to be exposed

still alive
waiting on
(the hope for us all)
still alive
waiting for truth
(I'm waiting for the truth)

you can't escape the noise in your head
you can't escape the noise that's been said

failing to capture the wonder
of the simplest mind
(you speak with indifference)
still the faithful listen in
and close their eyes (they close their eyes)
and live the lie

the weight of the world and all your energy
make up your mind
the distant seas and turbulent geography
make up your mind

still alive
waiting on
(the hope for us all)
still alive
waiting for truth
(I'm waiting for the truth)

no
you can't escape the noise in your head
you can't escape the noise that's been said

runaway patrons of control
isolate passions working through

(still alive)

still alive
waiting on
(the hope for us all)
still alive
waiting for truth
(I'm waiting for the truth)

time awaits
