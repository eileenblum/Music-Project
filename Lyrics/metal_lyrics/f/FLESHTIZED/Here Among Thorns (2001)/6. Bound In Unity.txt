The minds are closed to learning... expansion
Each of us surrounded by the naive in denial
They boast so loudly now, but the truth is coming out
No grasp upon realities of greater law
So then they search for flaws in us, seen through moronic eyes
What could ever defeat we brothers bound in unity
Boundariless contempt expanding it overflows
Thus we're annointed with our own strength of will
Strength of mind - We have eyes that see where others never will
The savior baptized in lies can only lie
The martyr with ivory eyes will leave you with blindness
A false hope springs from the life of the savior - He should fear this...
