Your written word is poetry intoxicating clarity
All is well in chaosmind where only you can purify
I breathe again inside your voice angels sing demons rejoice
Alternate realities dividing Canaan piece by piece

[chorus:]
Your within me
You've taken root
We are one now
Here among thorns
Bloood roses and choirgirls crucify with icicles
Show me what it is to be one with words that truly speak
Open me pour your self in. Fill me up again
Show me now take the other world take grain of sand and form a pearl

You spread your wings
You show your rage strange tears from a new place
Under the pink I find your soul only this can make me whole
Bloodroses and choirgirls crucify with icicles
Show me what it is to be one with words that truly speak
Lost inside a maze of tangled flesh a new thought comes to mind
Am I the thorn that pierces when you're the soul I melt into?
