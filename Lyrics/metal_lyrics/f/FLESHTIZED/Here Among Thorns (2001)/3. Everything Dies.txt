No savior - No forgiveness
Nothing but a thorn in my side
Bow down, servant, lashes are all you get
Discarded - Passed over
Punishment is all you deserve
Never were we close
Never were we one mind
These words show true feelings
I wish you nightmares
I wish you blisters
I wish you sickness
This that you deserve
These things shall come to pass
So remember my face when the pain comes
Your mother bears my seed
Pleasure in raping
When her son is born
I'll kill you again
All you love shall wilt
