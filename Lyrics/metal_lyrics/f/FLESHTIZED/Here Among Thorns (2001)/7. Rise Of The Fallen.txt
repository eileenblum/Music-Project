Infiltrate see past our enemies spread the word of our sacred code
To do is to die and to die is to live
We must believe live for the fight its a warrior's right
Stand now side by side no longer blinded by ignorance
Growing stronger with every step knowing the power of the cause
Mercy is for the weak
Stay through them all striking hard demanding the fall
Come all ye faithful the time is now
Deliver us from our diease
Eye to eye - we crush all of them now forget the pain up and onward
Smashing them into the ground
Freedom of mind without it we are nothing
Never letting your given rights be taken
Living everyday as if it were your last
Forever marching on
Rise, rise, rise - Marching on
