I cannot conceive this that you believe
Changing with the season self betrayal treason
More sincere with every breath getting hard confidence
Changing
Forming
Ever Growing
With every breath getting harder
What master do you serve that sells you your self worth
It's something you can't earn
The mindless never learn
Forced down on your knees to the masses please
Soul forever grieves eyes that never see
