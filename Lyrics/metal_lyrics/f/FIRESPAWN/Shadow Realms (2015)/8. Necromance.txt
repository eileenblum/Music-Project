Dark desires, molesting intent.
Shiny blade cuts through the neck.
Lifeless she's falling down, taste the victim's blood.
Feel the heart stop, bring her to the rite.

Lifeless, stiff and pale, will never breath again.
Gently stroke her skin, lust obscene inside of him.
Ripping the clothes from the cold white corpse.
Violating this dead girl all so grim.

Necromance, the most vicious of rite.
Necromance, the lust for corpse shines so bright.
Necromance, penetrate all through night.
Necromance, the smell of death in sight.

Necrophiliac acts of pleasure, defile the innocent.
Manhandled body on the bed.
Over and over and over again, in his temple of lust for the dead.
Hunger in his head.

Hammer and chisel now at use, separate all the bones and joints.
Blood now flows!
Packed in bags and thrown in piles, the hunt will start again.
But first feed the crows!

Necromance, the most vicious of rite.
Necromance, the lust for corpse shines so bright.
Necromance, penetrate all through night.
Necromance, the smell of death in sight.
