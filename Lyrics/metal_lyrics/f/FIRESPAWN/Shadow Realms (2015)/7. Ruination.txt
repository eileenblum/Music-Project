I'm feeling genocidal, it's flowing over me.
I've never liked denial, violent authority.
This urge is raw and primal, far beyond tyranny.
Prepare for my reprisal, crush your conformity.

I'm pulling life up from the roots.
Bone puzzle under army boots.
Another tomb for me to feed.
Annihilation guaranteed.

I'm feeling genocidal, free from morality.
Prepare for death's arrival, cleansing impurity.
