Shadow realms, violence is born.
Shadow realms, chaos torn.

Nor face, nor shape, watchers of the underworld.
Searching, haunting, claiming souls of the dead.
Black in sight, reeking breath of death.
Creatures of the night, plague and misery raging like wildfire.

Black masses come to me!

Endarken my mind! 
Enligthen my essence with fire!
Endarken my mind! 
Enlighten my essence with fire!

Shadows their realms, darkness their empire.
The night their castle, cast the curse

Shadows realms, violence eternal.
Shadows realms, chaos infernal.

Dawn of the black moon is here.
Driven by Satan's hunger they search.
Claiming your dark soul to tear apart.
Filled with hate, filled with rage.
bloodstained blades in you.

Black masses come to me!

Endarken my mind! 
Enligthen my essence with fire!
Endarken my mind! 
Enlighten my essence with fire!

Black masses come to me!
Black masses come to me!
