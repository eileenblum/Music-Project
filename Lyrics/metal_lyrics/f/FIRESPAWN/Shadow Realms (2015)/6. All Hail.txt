Minions, scorching as they burn the feeble victims.
Dominate, through submission they'll learn.
Demonize, they cry out as they weep, submission bound.
Nowhere near, in fire they will sleep, the horns will reap.

All hail, by horns and hooves we ride.
All hail, the gates are open wide.
All hail, we aim for global genocide.
All hail, with death and fire side by side.

Followers, a purgatory wait, with strength they burn.
Warriors, this flame is fueled by hate.
Summoning of darkness, death will breed his every need.
Suffering, our legions they will feed, the hooven creed.

All hail, by horns and hooves we ride.
All hail, the gates are open wide.
All hail, we aim for global genocide.
All hail, with death and fire side by side.

From beneath, the roots of death are thickening.
You feeble foe, reckoning.
The world you know is sickening.

Trinity, horns of the infinity.
He's wearing sin from below.
Nocturnal graveyard gathering, the undead sing.

All hail, by horns and hooves we ride.
All hail, the gates are open wide.
All hail, we aim for global genocide.
All hail, with death and fire side by side.
