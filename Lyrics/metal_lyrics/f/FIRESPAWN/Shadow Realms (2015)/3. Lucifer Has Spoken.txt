Through out the night, as a spider's web they glitter.
Poisonous words they hear, in the shadows they whisper.
The followers of fire, attend their master's demand.
In patience they wait to carry out morningstar's command.

The son of black dawn will rise up his throne.
Deep down in the pits of darkness unknown.
The eyes of the king sparkle with hate.
The prophecy is coming through the irongate.

Dominantur mali mores.
Dominantur mali mores.
Dominantur mali mores.
Dominantur mali mores.

Lucifer has spoken!
Lucifer has spoken!

Through out the night, the march begin.
Let every tomb know the act of sin.
The eye of the serpent is watching close.
The time has come that he knows.

The son of black dawn will rise up his throne.
Deep down in the pits of darkness unknown.
The eyes of the king sparkle with hate.
The prophecy is coming through the irongate.

Dominantur mali mores.
Dominantur mali mores.
Dominantur mali mores.
Dominantur mali mores.

Lucifer has now spoken!
Lucifer has now spoken!

Throughout the night, Mephistopheles shines.
Throughout the night, armies in lines.

Lucifer!
Lucifer!
