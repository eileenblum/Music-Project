Test your strength, force your steps.
Miles of pain, so much left.
Raining down like storms of fire.
Swarm of terror, crown the liar.

Hungry we tear through the soil.
Hungry we tear through the soul.
Trampling life as we charge.
Predators still at large.

Our trail of dead, the rivers are red.
Now march, onwards we charge.

Hand of doom, flesh consume.
Crawling in the dirty trenches.
Body parts attached to fences.

Hungry we tear through the soil.
Hungry we tear through the soul.
Trampling life as we charge.
Predators still at large.

Our trail of dead, the rivers are red.
Now march, onwards we charge.

My command, death's at hand.
Will they stand, not as planned.
Mushroom cloud, the corpses blooming.
This old field is life consuming.

Hungry we tear through the soil.
Hungry we tear through the soul.
Trampling life as we charge.
Predators still at large.

Our trail of dead, the rivers are red.
Now march, onwards we charge.
