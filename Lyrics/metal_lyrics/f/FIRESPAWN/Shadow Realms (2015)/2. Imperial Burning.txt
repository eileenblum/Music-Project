When someone's watching, you walking.
With murderous intent they're stalking.
Patiently waiting, the result will be devastating.
Lurking, he lingers, your life is sand between his fingers.
Cutting and stabbing, with heavy leather gloves he's grabbing.

Ceremony, indecency, undergoing.
You are as sand and the winds are blowing.

Conqueror, collector, obsessor, psychotic thrill.
Predator, molester, aggressor, needs one more kill.
Conqueror, collector, obsessor, psychotic thrill.
Predator, molester, aggressor, needs one more kill.

You feel your heartbeat is racing.
You realize it's death you're facing.
Brute force, incision, your body in his morbid vision.
Carnal, perfection, a piece of art in his collection.
Climax, relief, fulfilled a murderer's belief.

Ceremony, indecency, undergoing.
You are as sand and the winds are blowing.

Conqueror, collector, obsessor, psychotic thrill.
Predator, molester, aggressor, needs one more kill.
