Wicked tunes, evil mind.
Deceving premeditation, contempt is blind.
Lizard eyes dancing in moonlight, children's cry.
Little do they know, die they shall, with devil unite.
Trix them all, he steals your young.
Condemning their souls with Hell's nasty tongue.

Hear his call, he's drowning them all.
Under the surface they lay cold, will never get old.
Stolen, lost and forgotten into the tide until flesh be rotten.
Born of sin to rule upon waters of North.

Spirit of the black tide.
Hellspawn, Lilith's progeny.
Spirit of the black tide. 
Collecting childrens souls and agony.
Spirit of the black tide.

Scaled in skin, pale as snow.
Darkness inside him and hate will grow.
With the tunes written in flames.
Lure them down, life he claims.

Human prey, the hunt is on, in patience suspence.
Down the tide they are drawn, into the void, through dark domains.
There's no way out, caught in nykrman's chains.

Hear his call, he's drowning them all.
Under the surface they lay cold, will never get old.
Stolen, lost and forgotten into the tide until flesh be rotten.
Born of sin to rule upon waters of North.

Spirit of the black tide.
Hellspawn, Lilith's progeny.
Spirit of the black tide. 
Collecting childrens souls and agony.
Spirit of the black tide.
