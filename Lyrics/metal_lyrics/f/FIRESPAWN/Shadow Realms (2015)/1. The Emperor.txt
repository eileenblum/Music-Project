Limbo shelters heathens from the past.
Baptized by fire, died by war.
Dwelling shadows, chaos rising fast.
Black rain of acid, dark sky thunders roar.

Hunger extreme of the great black beast.
Gobbles with three mouths, feces, blood and flesh.
Lurking about with only aim, eternal feast.
Hooks in with chains, trapped in this infernal mesh.

Emperor of endless night, come to us with all your might.
Ancient demon show your wrath, we follow thee on left hands path.

Swampy waters River Styx. 
Wrathful fights are at hands.
Malice, vengeance, state of mind.
All Hell's damned souls shackled down in pain.

Guardians of darkness whipping hard.
Starless night forever reign.
Depths of tombs and rotten death.
Snake eyes in fire, Satan's breath.
