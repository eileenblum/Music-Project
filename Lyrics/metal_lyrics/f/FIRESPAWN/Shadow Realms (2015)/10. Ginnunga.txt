Voices of northern darkness call out for war.
Horror in flames, hear the fires roar.
Sons of Nifelhel shaped in the pits of death.
Murderers eternal will take away your final breath.

Armies of Ginnunga, bringers of pain.
Show them our wrath, let blistering thunders reign.

Join us now in Ginnunga.
Gather legions in Ginnunga.

Apocalypse draws near in Ginnunga.
The one who walks in flames, 
walks with us in Ginnunga.

Release the hellhounds, set the world on fire.
Commander in arms, bringer of lights will take us much higher.
Let go of the raging wolves and spread the night.
Impale the holy, let it be done.
Show them our fury, shoot them down while they run.

Join us now in Ginnunga.
Gather legions in Ginnunga.

Apocalypse draws near in Ginnunga.
The one who walks in flames, 
walks with us in Ginnunga.

Join us now in Ginnunga.
Gather legions in Ginnunga.
Apocalypse draws near in Ginnunga.
