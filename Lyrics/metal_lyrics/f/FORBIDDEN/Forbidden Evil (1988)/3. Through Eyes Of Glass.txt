See the light is flashing through your eyes,
Deep inside your brain another stirs,
They're telling where they've been
And what they've seen
Who is this that lives inside my dream,

Visions are coming at last to me,
Once I was blind but now I can see,
Should you believe what you see,
When you look through eyes of glass
Through eyes of glass

My mind is one, now has the crystal power
It's reaching back where my life began,
Reflecting who I was and what I've been,
I've lived before, I've been many men,

Visions are coming at last to me,
Once I was blind but now I can see,
Can you believe what you see,
When you look through eyes of glass
Through eyes of glass

Crystals
Clashing
Evil's
Calling
Cracking
My brain
Now I'm
Insane

I drift into abyss fast asleep,
Guarded by the spirits over me,
I walked along a winding path of gold,
Which led me to a world of my lost soul,
I've seen the light flash through my eyes,
Deep inside another stirred,
Telling where they've been and what they've seen,
Who is this that lives inside my dreams

Through eyes of glass,
Through eyes of glass,
Through eyes of glass
