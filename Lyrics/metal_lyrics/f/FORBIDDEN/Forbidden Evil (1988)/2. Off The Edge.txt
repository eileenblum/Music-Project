Little Johnny was a clown,
A clown indeed he was,
Just what he needed was attention
To kill his inner frown,

Pay you toll you're growing old,
You've seen that life's a game,
Now you turn it's time to learn
That life is yours to tame

Lend me a dime 'cause I'm running out of time,
I'm living, I'm snapping, I'm falling off the edge,
Don't know what to do, off the edge I flew,
I'm falling, falling, falling off the edge,
I'm near the edge, I'm on the edge,
I'm off the edge,
Jump

Little Terry and little Mary,
The fry-heads of the school,
Just some kids that fried on' cid,
And now we all must bury,

Alas they walked up to the cliff,
They didn't hear a word,
Little Mary fell through the air,
A thump was all we heard

Lend me a dime 'cause I'm running out of time,
I'm living, I'm snapping, I'm falling off the edge,
Don't know what to do, off the edge I flew,
I'm falling, falling, falling off the edge,
I'm near the edge, I'm on the edge,
I'm off the edge,
Jump

Alas they tripped out on the edge,
What a crying shame,
Their lives controlled by chemicals,
And half their friends the same,

Tried their best to live their lives,
In some other's person fashion,
It's always seems they lose their dreams,
And now's the time they'll cash in

I'm near the edge, I'm near the edge
I'm on the edge, I'm off the edge,
Jump
