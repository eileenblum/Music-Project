Killers thrill, endless slaughter,
Mother cries her tortured daughter,
Tattered flesh, and silky hair,
Ripped her soul and left her bare

Unbelievers hold evil,
Learn or burn,
Torment, hate and torture,
Your soul will burn

Bloody angel, trapped in sin,
Ripped down to blistered skin,
It's wings became fallen prey,
Holy Lord please end this day

Unbelievers hold evil,
Learn or burn,
Torment, hate and torture,
Your soul will burn
Burn

The king of death shall rule,
His plague of hell is fire,
He's come to fight his duel,
He's worshipped with desire,

Behold forbidden evil,
They've come to fight you'll see
Behold good God the savior will rule eternity,
Prince of hell, he surrounds the Earth
Fulfilling what is said,
The demons scream from hell
And kiss the bloody birth

Forbidden Evil
Forbidden Evil

Evil
