Feel the noose around your neck,
Hang mankind untimely death,
No way to change what will be done,
Just watch and wait until we're gone

A curse in on our souls, we have no choice,
We are but toys marching into fire

Don't deceive or be deceived,
The truth just wait, just will be revealed,
It's too late to change the bland man's fate
It's too late to change the bland man's fate

A curse in on our souls, we have no choice,
We are but toys marching into fire

Awoke again to find this hell,
Surrounds me everywhere,
Lakes of blood around my feet,
It fills me with despair,
Destroy all life now watching mankind,
Walking into fire,
No cause, no need, just evil's greed,
Give me insane desire

We all march into fire
March!

The game is done there's nothing left,
Our necks now hang we've met our death
A curse in on our souls, we have no choice,
We are but toys marching into fire
March!
