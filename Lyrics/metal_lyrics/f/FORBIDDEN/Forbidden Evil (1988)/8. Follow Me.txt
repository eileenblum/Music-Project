Come my children follow me,
I hold all eternity,
Worship what I live and dream
Help me fill the demon sea,

Take my hand
Walk with me,
Search your soul
Let it free

Come my children follow me to
Come my children follow me to
Your misfortune follow me
You'll be smashed to the ground in the pits of hell,
Into my clutches you all fell,
Now we'll see that all is lost,
Now your soul must pay the cost

Now I find out what is mine,
A kingdom of my divine,
My love had turned to lust,
As diamonds turned to rock the dust,

Take my hand
Walk with me,
Search your soul
Let it free

Come my children follow me to
Come my children follow me to
Your misfortune follow me
You'll be smashed to the ground in the pits of hell,
Into my clutches you all fell,
Now we'll see that all is lost,
Now your soul must pay the cost

I'm drained I can't go on
With you I feel I can go on,
Blind they'll walk into the grave,
We must hold on, we will be saved,
Saved

Follow me
Follow me
