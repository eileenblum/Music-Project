Broken code holds information,
Deadly message of confrontation,
Secret passed from spy to spy,
Covert action needles eye,
Silent hero secret word,
Blow his cover kick down the door,
Caught in act the pain is near,
Close my mind to all fear

Give him strength to help block the pain,
In his mind that screams,
For mercy he will not give in
Feel no pain, feel no pain

Talk is done he must prepare,
Tortured now strapped in the chair,
The beating's over he must rest,
He has suffered his very best,
Sharpened blades rip through his skin,
Worthless efforts he won't give in,
His blood is cold his nerves is are dead,
They can't get inside his head

Give him strength to help block the pain,
In his mind that screams,
For mercy he will not give in
Feel no pain, feel no pain

Pain, pain, pain, pain
Crush

Broken code holds information,
Deadly message of confrontation,
Secret passed from spy to spy,
Covert action needles eye,
Silent hero secret word,
Blow his cover kick down the door,
Caught in act the pain is near,
Close my mind to all fear

Give him strength to help block the pain,
In his mind that screams,
For mercy he will not give in
Feel no pain, feel no pain
Pain!
