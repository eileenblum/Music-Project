The end is coming fast, flags they fly halfmast
Soldiers have come to fight,
Tanks roll off the hill, men are lying still,
Armies of hate in sight,
Death now wills to be, kill for you will see
The end is coming fast

Planes shoot, blood runs,
Killing innocent people,
Bombs hit were blown to shit,
Killing all our children

Now prepare to die, bombs light,
The sky eat dirt and hit the ground,
Kill a Yankee snitch, run hit the ditch
Troops prepare to die

Planes shoot, blood runs,
Killing innocent people,
Bombs hit were blown to shit,
Killing all our children

Evil lives in minds of those
Who fill our lives with war,
Making sure the lines are guarded,
We're closing all the doors,
Mad desire fills your head,
Your mind id brain dead,
What you've seen you'll never forget
Your child is dead,

Over the hill the light is the blast,
The smell of guns in the air,
Screams of pain the wish for death,
Emotions sounding scared,
Don't try to live, you will not live,
The force brakes through the line,
First to shoot, blow off your gun,
Now kiss your ass good bye

Troops drop

Summons to this battle field left to die,
Death before your eyes, hear the cries,
Military minds have called the shot,
The power broke loose, they watch you rot,
Armies on the hunt, taking force of life,
Life is just a game, throw the dice,
The power and the might, who's right?
From air and sea and land, we must fight

As good as dead

Who are you to know the reasons why?
Going to war men must die,
The power and the might, who's right?
From air and sea and land, we will fight
As good as dead,
As good as dead, as good as dead,
Your all as good as dead
