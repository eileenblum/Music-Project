We've always been told to stand up tall
"Guard the nation"
This killing force that we have made, what for?
I am sickened by this attitude that plagues
The Mother Earth
It always seems that we're all fighting
We don't know what it's worth

Close the door as they beg for more
Children cry as they're left to die
See the tears running down their faces
See compassion is at end
Mother Earth is crying
Rest in peace... Peace!

Who can you believe? It's never what it seems
Feel the anger
They're tightening the vice, now who pays the price?
We will!
I am saddened by this selfishness and, "Who cares"
Attitude!
Put down your arms and stop this fighting
Save our Mother Earth

Close your eyes, say your last goodbyes
Self-destruct, we've run out of luck
See the lights turn to darkness
Realize there is no hope
The human race is dying
Rest in peace... Peace!

Desperate - Is what we've all become
Helpless - There's nowhere left to run
Crushing - The spirit of mankind
Forbidding - What's yet to come!

We've always been told to stand up tall
"Guard the nation"
This killing force that we have made, what for?
I am sickened by this attitude that plagues
The Mother Earth
It always seems that we're all fighting
We don't know what it's worth

Who will drop the curtain
Who will end Earth's history
No more "Happy ever after"
Rest in peace... Peace
Rest in peace -

[Lead: Tim]
