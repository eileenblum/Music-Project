[Theme: Craig]

Looking into saddened eyes that morn, I'm unashamed
Witness to the crying of the poor, I can't relate
Afraid to see what lies behind the lies, I'm ignorant
Don't tell me, I won't know, just leave me be

Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched, I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand, why should I?
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away, tossed away!

Glutiny, I'm hungry then I'll eat, I'm a selfish pig
Thinking I'm thirsty, I'll have a drink, it pours away
So tired, so I'll lie down awhile, the lazy life, ha!
Don't bother me, I'm dreaming, just le me sleep

Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched, I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand, why should I?
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away, tossed away!

Disgusting! Revolting! They sicken me!
Send them somewhere out of sight, away from us
Separate their children from our young, they're dangerous
Don't say I didn't warn you, just wait and see!

Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched, I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand, why should I?
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away, tossed away -

Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away, tossed away!
