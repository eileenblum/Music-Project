Regression! Progressive downfall
Grabbing what's there and still wanting it all

On words they fall

Obsession! Religious belief
Worshipped on Sunday, forgotten all week

One foot in Hell

Taking the truth from "The Book" and then twisting it
Feeling they're touched by the Lord
Loving their neighbor, yet tasting the flavor of sin
But seeing no wrong
Cramming the wisdom that righteously flows in them
Walking the crooked, straight line
Closing of minds to these innocent crimes
Now they're deaf, dumb, and blind!

One foot in Hell

Wretches! This pitiful man
Preaching and teaching with cross in hand

On words he falls

Into...! His final mistake
This fool was fooled, it was all give and take

One foot in Hell

Taking the truth from "The Book" and then twisting it
Turning the pages of writing, it falls into place
A puzzle of words
Cramming the wisdom that righteously flows in them
Attempting to fear the Commandments they hear
Now they're deaf, dumb, and blind!

"I look to the Heavens and call the Lord's name.
Praying on my knees, with much faith, and little doubt
I have a yearning for the answers to my calling in life
Am I wasting away on spirits of myth?
Am I questioning the Lord's prayer?
Is this unholy temptation or, my final realization?
Please, God, if you're there for me, give the wisdom for faith
Help me Lord!
God help me" - !

Show me the way - Point to the light
Is there a Heaven after I die?
What is a truth - Where does it lie
Give me the answer
Bare my soul - Naked and cold
End confusion, shed my last tear
Take me Lord - Open your Gates
End my deep sorrow

One foot in Hell
Who's answering the bell?
