I can't remember a time when I was innocent
There is no word that hurts me
No one could stop what was coming down
Nothing has changed inside of me
If I could end sorrow I'd be there laughing with you
If I could stop laughing we'd cry and cry forever
You can't save me from the riddle
that creates my own frustration
I am starring
A cold impression trailing off to nowhere
There is no look they gave me
A painted smile turned upside down, inside out
Blank as a page
Don't try to turn it on me
you can't control my mind
My thoughts are always with me
I listen all of the time...
Can't ever laugh when I'm alone
Won't ever smile, emotion prone
Can't see the night, can't see the day
Embrace the wounds, now here I'll lay
Take a trip to the other side
I'm never coming back to your side
Inner face that I'm gonna hide
Can't speak the words I wanna say
Their on my tongue but locked away
Can't see your world, you won't see mine
Can't ever stop the wheels of time
Take a trip to the other side
I'm never coming back to your side
Inner face that I'm gonna hide
Never coming back to your side
If I can end sorrow I'd be there laughing with you
If I could stop laughing we'd cry and cry forever
You can't save me from the riddle
that creates my own frustration
I am starring
