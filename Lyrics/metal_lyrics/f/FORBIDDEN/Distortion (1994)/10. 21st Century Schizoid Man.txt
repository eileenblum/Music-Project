Can't food iron claw
Neuro-surgeons scream for more
At paranoia's poison door
Twenty-first century schizoid man

Blood racks barbed wire
Politician's funeral pyre
Innocents raped with napalm fire
Twenty-first century schizoid man

Death seed blind man's greed
Poet's starving children bleed
Nothing he's got he really needs
Twenty first century schizoid man


Thanks to nirajpandya for correcting tracks ## 2, 5 lyrics.
