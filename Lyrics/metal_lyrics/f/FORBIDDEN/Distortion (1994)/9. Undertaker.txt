Face one another, dig to uncover
Under the veil, eyes of betrayal
Under taker, under taker

Drown in disorder
Silent explosion
Funeral for strangers
Under takers, over taking me
Under the cancer shell
Under taker please
Overtaking me
Give them a second chance

Hold my hand
and don't let go of it
Taste the pain and don't let go
is there still a place for me?
Just don't turn away

Face one another
Under taker, undertaker

Buried beside you
Strangers you once knew
Under the flowers
Under takers, overtaking me

Give them a second chance
Under the cancer shell
Under taker please
Overtaking me
Give them a second chance
