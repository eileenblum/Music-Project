Sanity walks the razors edge, unconsciously
Questioning the shadows, calling me
Listen to the voices of my past

I'm screaming, free falling here I stand

Reality slits the riffs of time now ticking true
Reflections of yourself, I laugh at you
Pushing me I'm slipping off the ledge

I'm screaming, I'm falling, here I am
I'm dreaming, falling, where I am

Behind the mask, my faces of delusion
Behind the mask, I can't separate confusion
Behind the mask, it's my paranoid delusions
Behind the mask, who is behind the mask?

Look through these eyes
See all my faces their hiding behind
Here by my side
Those who I trust turn against and divide me
So near but always beyond me
So clear their calling me back

Behind the mask!
