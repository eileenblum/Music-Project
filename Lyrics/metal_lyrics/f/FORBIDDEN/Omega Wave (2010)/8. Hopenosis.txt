Live the lie, breath the lie,
Fall in line, show us how to live
Lead us to the edge then throw us in
When our senses fail us,
Who'll be there to break our fall
Who'll be there to save us from ourselves

You promised to show us the way
While selling your dreams of a radiant day
You gave us hopenosis, ill-lycid psychosis

Blessed one, chosen one,
Block the sun, show us how to live
Make us all believe that we can win
Raise your armies thunder,
Line us up again the wall
Endless confrontation severs all

You promised to show us the way
While selling your dreams of a radiant day
Lost in the roses, ill-lycid psychosis
You gave us hopenosis its fucking psychosis

Hopenosis

Actor walks on the flood lit stage
Embellishing lies, just for show
Entrapper of nations, words of elation
Burned to the ground what is sold

Hopenosis
