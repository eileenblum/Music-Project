I am - hand of the elite, you know who
I am - winds of tyranny, too close to see
Power of the mob won't set you free
Thin the heard to save humanity
Soft kill solution - deadly swine
Righteous pig divine

I am the savior, calculated killer I am swine

They lie - truth resides beneath the surface
They hide - winds that carry me, too close to see
Born with-in-a trough, the filth you breath
Thin the heard to save humanity
Soft kill solution - deadly swine
Righteous pigs design

I am the soldier relentless and indifferent in the mind
I am the savior calculated killer I am swine

Dispose of the useless eaters
Malevolents line up to die
Mountain of disbelievers
Infected, now die

Souls tell their stories, witness to the end
Witnessing the end
