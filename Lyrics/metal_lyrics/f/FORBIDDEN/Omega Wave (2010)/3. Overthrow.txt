Fighting our way through,
We break through the day
We've become what we all hate the most
Making ourselves sick, we are sadistic
The pain we inflict always takes
Destroy all fear, defy all pain
Taking it back we regain
Manifestation our mutilation
The masochist watches and waits

I am awake - overthrow, rebellion of the mind
Overthrow, overthrow, overtake

Turbulent unrest with blood on the streets
The pressure that builds detonates
Collapse of the system, violent resistance
Fueling the fire of our hate
Destroy your fear, defy your pain
Taking it back we regain
Manifestation our mutilation
The masochist watches and waits

I am awake - overthrow, rebellion of the mind
Overthrow, overthrow, overtake
Uprising of our time
Overthrow, I am awake
Overthrow, overtake

How can I look in your eyes?
Turning away
Keeping you safe from the lies
Protect you always

My life for you
Hold you closer
All for truth
Protect you always
