Get in line or lead the way
Below the grinding gears of war, adapt or die
Powers bought and sold
Choose a side then stand your ground or run away

It's done, prepare yourself the ending has begun
It's done, this is the beginning of the end
Adapt or die

Disseminate blinding one by one
Riding on the coat tails of destruction
Follow or lead the way
Choose a side then stand your ground or run away

End times we fear, wearing shades of arrogance
Blood river of tears, clock turns past our time
The world rejects mankind, the earth swallows
Feeling emptiness, no one is safe
Souls crushed in a wake, we're leveled

Lift your head or hide in shame
Below the grinding gears of war adapt or die
Deviate, change the game
Choose a side then stand your ground or run away

It's done, prepare yourself the ending has begun
It's done, this is the beginning of the end
