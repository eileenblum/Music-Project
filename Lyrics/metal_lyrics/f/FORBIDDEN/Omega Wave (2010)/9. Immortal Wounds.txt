Millions of lost souls, envision them dead
Conscious deceivers
Follow the same light to endless impressions
Unconscious believers
Delusions of grandeur, we lay them to rest
Ending your nightmare
Except your existence, there is no resistance
This is forever...

Misplacing our feelings, we've lost all the meaning
Blinded illusions
Pushing our limits beyond comprehension
Breeding confusion
Drift through space and time
Except our existence, there is no resistance
This is forever...

Immortal wounds tear through the sky
Immortal wounds safe passage in time
Safe passage through time
