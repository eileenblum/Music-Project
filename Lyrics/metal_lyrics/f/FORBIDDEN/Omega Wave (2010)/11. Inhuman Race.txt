Running going nowhere, chasing the finish line
Obsessing over nothing burning from both ends,
We've lost our minds

Where does it end? Where does it go? I feel nothing
Winning the game, nothing to show... Lost
Where does it end? Where do I go?
I feel nothing, I am nothing

Senseless over-thinking, falling so far behind
Possessions consuming everyone
Selfish human beings running blind

Inhuman race, lost in the game we create
Inhuman race, trapped in the walls we create
Falling backwards we've lost our way
Inhuman race, inhuman

Breaking my back, chasing down the dream
Relentless attack I want something give it all to me
Manipulating feeding off the weak
All consuming I want something give it all to me
