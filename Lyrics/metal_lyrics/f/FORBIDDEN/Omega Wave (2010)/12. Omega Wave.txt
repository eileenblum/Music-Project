The crest of the wave is crushing human kind
Rolling with ungodly force, omnipotent omega
Delivering the pain, condemning one and all
Eradicate the conscious stricken, everyone must die

Slaves to the fear we've created out impending doom
Avoiding the warning we've turned a blind eye to the truth

The message re-conveyed, distorted in translation
Prophecies are re-deranged, manipulate the masses

Slaves to the fear we've created our impending doom
Avoiding the warning we've turned a blind eye to the truth

Omega!

Forced to live despair, life abandoned
Voices unheard in white noise forgotten caught in the web
Of disinformation
Pulling us down underneath our redemption

Slaves to the fear we've created our impending doom
Avoiding the warning we've turned a blind eye to the truth

Omega!
