OH, this feeling takes my mind await, to a dark place
I hope to see the light again, someone help me
I need your hands to reach out for me, I'm descending
This tension is eating away at my dreams, dragging my casket!

OH, I'm blinded by conspiracy, so I question
Contradictions plague my mind, always guessing
I'm caught underneath all the agony, I'm descending
This tension is eating away at my dreams, dragging my casket!

Digging my grave, who's going to save me
Burnt by the fire, stole my desire
Holding me down, who's going to save me
Embracing my pain, no one will save me
I'm dragging my casket down!

Shovel the earth upon my dreams
Nothing is ever what it seems
Diluted illusions reality
Buried ambitions, they've died!

Dragging my casket... Down
No on can save me... Now
Stealing my life force
Their holding and choking me out
No one will save us... Now
Dragging my casket
