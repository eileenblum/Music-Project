[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
God gave me a vision,
Go and live in another land
He told me, that heâs with me
In any situation

[Pre-chorus]
Itâs hard for me to believe it
Is hard for me to leave everything behind

[Verse 2]
When I felt like I was going to die
He allowed me to start a new life
Iâve been dreaming every day
And God confirms his word to me

[Chorus]
I know that you will not  let me die
Now I can see in the sky
The signs of his love, I donât have another choice
I must keep going on, in my vision.
