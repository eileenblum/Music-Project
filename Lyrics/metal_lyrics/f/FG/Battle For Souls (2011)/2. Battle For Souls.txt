[Music &amp; lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
The people think Itâs the battle of two worlds
The people think Itâs the Good against evil
But that is a lie of the liar
You must look to the sacred book

[Pre-chorus]
There is not the same power
All evil is subjected to the truth

[Chorus]
We are in a âBattle for Soulsâ
We are in a âBattle for Soulsâ

[Verse 2]
Donât Believe in the false prophets
They want  to control you like a puppet
The Sacred Book is never wrong
Itâs teaching you to save your soul
