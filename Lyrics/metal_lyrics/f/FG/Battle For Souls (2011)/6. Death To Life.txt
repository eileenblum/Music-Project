[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
I pass through the pathway of death
I  saw my life in danger again
But God decided  give me more time
To keep working on in his land

[Pre-chorus]
I should be grateful
I must be a good worker

[Chorus]
He  revived me, from death to life
I'll give him the honor for all eternity
He  revived me, from death to life
Now I have to tell the whole world
âHe gave me lifeâ

[Verse 2]
I had to trust Fully in him
I had to believe what the Bible says
Because I had no other way
Believe in the King of heaven and earth
