[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
Thank you father for giving me the strength
You didnât let me die in the enemyâs hands
You have a purpose for me beyond death
You showed me when I was lost, all your love

[Pre-chorus]
Because that my love grows stronger every day
I just wanna be under your reign

[Chorus]
I will serve you
I will praise you
Who can keep me from your love? nobody can.

[Verse 2]
Now The Lord has given me a mission on this Earth
To Tell all the people about His Love
He will return like a thief in the night
You better Believe in Jesus Christ
