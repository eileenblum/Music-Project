[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
We must Shine our light , We must go and tell  others
The majesty of the kingdom, how great is faith in the king of kings

[Pre-chorus]
The final age is coming soon
The time is now; we must preach the word of the lord

[Chorus]
We must shine  in the darkness, The prophecy became reality
We must shine in the darkness, we are the people who will make the change

[Verse 2]
We must be prepared, Because Jesus is coming to the earth
Take your war weapon, The bible is the best sword
