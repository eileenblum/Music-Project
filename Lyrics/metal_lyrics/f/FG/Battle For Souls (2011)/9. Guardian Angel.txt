[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
Since I met you
You Changed my world, and all my ways
I fell in love with you
You fell in love with me

[Verse 2]
It was a beautiful sunset
God was uniting us
In one mind and soul

[Chorus]
Cuz you are my guardian angel
My other half,  you're my air
On this altar we climb
We will be one for eternity

[Verse 3]
I promise to believe in you
I promise to take care of you
After many years
My love will remain,  until eternity

[Bridge]
No matter how old we are,
Because our love always will be. yeah yeah
