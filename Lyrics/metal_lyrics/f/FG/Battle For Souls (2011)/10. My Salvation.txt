[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipie GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
From where comes my help.
From where comes my salvation
When my soul is afraid
Because of desperation

[Verse 2]
When the enemy is attacking
How can I defend myself
Because this war is not in flesh
This war is in spirit

[Chorus]
Lord, to you I will sing
You are my light, my salvation
The Strong of Israel
You gave your only Son
For me, to save me

[Verse 3]
When I see my adversaries  join
To demolish my flesh
They stumbled and fell down
Therefore, JesÃºs I will serve you
