[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
You say you are a Christian
You say you love God
They see your face every day
And see the love of Christ

[Pre chorus]
You act like a holy man
But in the secret, you laugh the name of God

[Verse 2]
With bible on your hand
And daily prayer
You steal so much money
That someone gave with love

[Pre chorus]
You act like a holy man
But in the secret, you laugh at the name of God

[Chorus]
No, no, no, you canât fool God
No, no, no, your lies will not save you
No, no, no, when you are in the presence of the creator
He will look to you
And say âI never met  youâ
