[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
The final time has come
Many signs have been revealed
Every eye shall see Him
And His arrival is near

[Pre chorus]
Now is the time, we got to believe
And the apostasy is inminent

[Chorus]
Prostrate yourself before His feet
Repent of all evil now
If you confess your sins and become saved
His justice will reach your heart, will forgive you

[Verse 2]
The prophecy told us rightly His word
A global order will come
Some will say evilness is the right way
And goodness is evil others will say

[Pre chorus]
Hunger of hearing they shall have
They will surrender to iniquity
