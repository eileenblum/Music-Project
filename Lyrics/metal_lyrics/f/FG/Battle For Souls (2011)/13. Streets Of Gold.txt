[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
I was born to be a rocker, I was born to play metal
This is the thing, the people canât understand
Can Someone tell me what is wrong in that?

[Pre-chorus]
The only reason for my music
Is giving praise to my lord

[Chorus]
I am rockin for the lord, Cuz he is the truth and the life
I am rockin for the lord, Cuz I have my hope in the streets of gold

[Verse 2]
Iâm sick and tired of religion
They will not rest until my flesh be destroyed,
I just wanna be a normal guy,
I just wanna sing metal for God
