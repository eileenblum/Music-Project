[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse 1]
There was a Man who came to us, But he was also Divine
He came to die for our sins, He came to die for you and me
But his own people didnât receive him, They didnât believe in his promises

[Chorus ]
We got the power to be children
Children of God
We got the power to receive him
Receive him in our hearts

[Verse 2]
All things were made , and would not exist without him
In his name we can be free, the lovely name of Jesus Christ
But the key of the door is in your hands, Only you can use it
