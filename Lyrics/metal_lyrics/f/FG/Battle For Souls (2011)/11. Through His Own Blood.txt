[Music &amp; Lyrics: Felipe GonzÃ¡lez]

[Verse  I]
Iâm walk down the street, seeing  people everywhere
Trying to understand, what is the meaning of life
I see the different faces, going through the motions of life ,
I canât take that any more

[Pre-chorus]
Iâve discovered the one, who give me the chance
To break my prison, you must believe in him

[Chorus]
Iâm a soldier of the Jesus
Soldier of the rock
Iâm a soldier of the Jesus
He gave me salvation, through his own blood

[Verse 2]
Many people think, the way out is
Commiting suicide, fear is in their minds
God gave us his word, the Bible is the only chance
To understand whatâs happening, we have to see the light
