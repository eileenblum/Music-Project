...dibbacakkhu-pannacakkhu-samanta-cakkhu-buddhacakkhu-dhamma-cakkhu 
[transl. pali. 'the most excellent divine eye. eye of knowledge. all-seeing eye. budding eye. dhamma-eye']

god's eye point of view. neither to be born nor to perish. negation of 
substance. impermanence of being. everlasting becoming. unconditional mind. 
expressing absolute revelation of truth. manifested beyond the 
trans-substantial &gt;&gt;i&lt;&lt;. all being and nonebeing. neither mind nor buddha. 
in an all-embracing immanent end-in-itself. paradoxes are unveiled. 
contradictions collapses. where boundaries failed. plunging into the vortex 
of darkness divine. entering the void where all things intertwine. this is 
the existence of the non-existence of duality expressing the radiance of 
ultimate reality.
