it's too late now. over the brink of the interior gravitational abyss. i 
spiral downwards.
inwards. torn apart into multiple i's. the totality of which i used to 
perceive as the absolute self. all processes are rapidly slowed down.
contracting. dissolving. freezing out. tidal gravitational forces tend to 
infinity. the godhead is pulling me beyond the swartzschild sphere. the 
theoretical maximum value for potential.
spatio-temporality inverted. space and time are turned inside out.
