not lost. but gone before.
deposited at the brink of time. across the borders of infinity.
atomized state. crystalized existence. linear-time ignored.
indescent wings take me home.
from within john wheelers hyperspace.
the secret disclosed. neither body nor radiation.
vanished to outside observers. those poor souls left behind.
