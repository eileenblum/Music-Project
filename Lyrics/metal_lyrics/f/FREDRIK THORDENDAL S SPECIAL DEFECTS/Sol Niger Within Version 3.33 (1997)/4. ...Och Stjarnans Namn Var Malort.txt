immolate reliance: suffocate defiance.
(ephemeral slimy fluids. soft entrails. squishy. squashy worms. we're 
nothing but germs.)
cardboard figure. skeletal man. in venomous confinement.

new dawning of fate. no exit from this torment. sickness and hate.
all in vain. everlasting suffering in pain.

constricting steel headbands. adrenaline boil.
temperature rise. pressure succeed.
in crushing my skull. destroying my seed.
divine epiphany of pyrocatharsis.
internal ascension to skyward domains.
preparation for rebirth.
