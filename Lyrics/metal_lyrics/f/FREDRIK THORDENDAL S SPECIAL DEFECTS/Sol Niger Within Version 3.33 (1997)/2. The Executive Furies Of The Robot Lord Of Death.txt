I'm seraph. I'm snake.
controlled. pre-programmed entrapped soul.
extraneous powers conditions my mind.
I'm vermin. I'm fake.
causality ignores the persecutory illutions of free will.
morality justifies no cause.
beyond reason: we eat. reproduce and die.
a genetically conditioned psychomotor machine.
I'm seraph. I'm snake. an evolutionary mistake.
