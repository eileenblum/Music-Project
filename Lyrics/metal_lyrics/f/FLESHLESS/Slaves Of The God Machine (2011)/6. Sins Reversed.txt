Join the selected few
In army of decadent mankind
Pathogens consuming you
Deranging human mind

Enter the collateral sanctuary
Creating new invincible soldiers
Consumer morgue of creations
Full of soulless strangers

Used to produce
Sins Reversed
Consumers abuse
Faith accursed

Synchronous and global
Praying for water, drinking wine
Revision of line all formal
Murdering the God, the sons of mine

Devised by political madness
Freedom of line goes down
This is the end of entertainment
Instead of king, facing the crown

Money, power, emptiness
Fulfilling commitments
Presenting speech wordless
Finishing complete treatment

Used to produce
Sins Reversed
Consumers abuse
Faith accursed
