Corroding in the dust
Only some debris and waste
Once so great
Once so vast
Now but to heaven
Is to be raised

Thise false ascension we'll carve to stones
Traditions distorted as we turn to the goners
Lies have always been mutated to another form
Nothing new uknown just the same norm

Iconic denigration
The deeds could be a sin
Once much proud
Transfiguration
But now of the hell
Comes out unclean

Thise false ascension we'll carve to stones
Myths were forgotten as we turn to the goners
Lies have always been mutated to another form
Nothing new uknown just the same norm
Ascentions remain, but we all are gone...
