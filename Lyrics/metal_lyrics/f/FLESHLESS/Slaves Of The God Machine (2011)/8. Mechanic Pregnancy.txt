With the enemy inside the body
Suffocated by the navel string
Another machine is ready
Death instead of life to bring

All my dreams are bloody red
While walking on the trail of tears
Nightmares burning in my head
Facing all the darkest fears

Machanic Pregnancy
Child without future
Fulfill the prophecy
Inhuman creature

Born in the name of misery
Forced to the mother's womb
Inseminated by machinery
Serving the system to the tomb

Machanic Pregnancy
Child without future
Fulfill the prophecy
Inhuman creature

Becoming the part of machine
Vaginectomy maleformation
Supplying the veins with vaccine
Mechanized  by deformation

Trying to turn off the system
There is no winner in the game
Loosing all wordly wisdom
Reborn again in eternal shame

Machanic Pregnancy
Child without future
Fulfill the prophecy
Inhuman creature
