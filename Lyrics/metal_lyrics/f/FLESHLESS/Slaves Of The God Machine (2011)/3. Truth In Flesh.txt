Soul imprisoned to flesh
It must be free
Remove the tissue
Pain of salvation
When the body is turned
Into a mesh...

Piece by piece, slice by slice
Truth in your flesh, wouldn't be nice
Piece by piece, shred by shred
Icon to torture, it cannot be dead

Reveal your destiny
And demonstrate
Picking at deep wounds
Excoriation
We'll find a reason of
Your mutiny

Blood splattered back
Follow your truth
Essence of your false life
We try to extract
As our tools and instruments
Are ready to hack

Tatter by tatter, slice by slice
Truth in your flesh, wouldn't be nice
Tatter by tatter, shred by shred
Icon to torture, it cannot be dead

Soul entangled in steel
It is now free
Improved machanics
No pain, salvation
When the body is turned
Into mesh of cogwheels...
