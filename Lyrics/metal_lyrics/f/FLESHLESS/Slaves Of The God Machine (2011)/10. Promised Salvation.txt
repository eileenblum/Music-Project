Body count within the end of the game
Declaring the state of war
Killing in your government's name
Shoot to kill, to kill them more
Grown with all the fallen forms
Composting pile of viscous warm
Getting older, cemented over
Sickening good citizen - Soldier

Promised Salvation
That never comes
Promised Salvation
Just hate, death and guns

Washing tons of decay away
Eliminate the words they say
The victor's exultant moments
Adrenaline flowing away

The conqueror, victorious candidate
The desolate expanse eating the world
Minister, senator, running for president
So what is it in the plan? Void agreement!

Promised Salvation
That never comes
Promised Salvation
Just hate, death and guns
