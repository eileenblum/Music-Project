Suffering mantally
Somatically maimed
Looking for some messiah
Looking for another life
To life and to get
Tortured and bent
Much more I could bear
Looking for some mechiah
And babbling glossolalia
Reality's so unfair

Revolting thoughts boiling my brain
Broken will of self-defence, no way to restrain
Seditious ideas, I want to fight for
But I'm getting down, more and more and more

Enemized thoughs, brain scouring is done
Masochistically enjoying that self-respect is gone
Seditious ideas, I once wanted to fight for
But I'm getting down, more and more and more
