I show you the might
I show you the power
Energy is just reason
Why we can fight

Pumping gear
Follow me here
There is somebody, no name to say
Hide your fear
He's trapped like deer
He must be betrayed

Steam powered faith
Red and hot
Dead paved way
To Dethrone God
Goddes of engine
Lewa, bloody, naked
Boiling me, pressing
'Till he'll be hacked

Steam-preacher, steam-creature
Steam-featured in steam rupture
The steam is purity
The steam-preacher
