Written in blood of innocent
Our minds deformed
Believe in lies, even in God
Believe in everything
All what was said
Such twisted doctrines
Indexed hate

Written by stool of frichtened
World is so cruel
Word is like nail, do not be a fool
Word is like humans
Shitlike infection
Their Sanguinary Doctrines
As deterioration

Doctrines fouled
Doctrines vexed
Their Sanguinary Doctrines
Lives perplexed

I do not believe... Having my own
I... Have... My... Own
