No nails, just screws
Iron cross, rusted and coarse
Welded well
One way ticket for trip to hell

Pinned as fly, wincing
Uncomfy hearse, binary tears
Wept out well
Pain will gradate, everyting failed

Fixed, fixed... On ironcast fixed
Ensnared and trapped... In belief matrix

Fixed, fixed... Crucified, fixed
Deconstructed... Through lie matrix

Fixed, fixed... Mystified, fixed
Reconstructed... Through truth matrix

Pinned as fly, stand and still
Uncomfy hearse, wet with real tears
Meant well
Pain is not over... That's all I can tell
