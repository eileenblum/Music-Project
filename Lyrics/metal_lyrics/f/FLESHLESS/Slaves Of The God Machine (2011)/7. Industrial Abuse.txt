Desperate dreams of life
Cancer crawling from the clouds
Useless treatments using the knife
Paranoia dressing the shrouds

Breaching in our minds
Forced us to resign
Leaving us with lies that blinds
Big mistake like worship divine

Industrial Abuse
Controlled by the rich
Humanity in use
Art of money bewitch

Undefined short future
Emerged in formaldehyde
Late to recall the nature
Compensations denied

Enchained by hoses and wires
Devastated brains
Our life time expires
Helpless with poison in veins

Worldwide chemicals
Killing instead of cure
Certification toxic medicals
Radiation far from secure

Industrial Abuse
Controlled by the rich
Humanity in use
Art of money bewitch
