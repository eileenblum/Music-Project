Dreaming, broken by impassive world
Pain in me, your words, fire in me, your sights
So cruel and lethal
Where's mine resurrection?
God's light cuts me dead
I am imprisoned in your spirit
Talous of your thoughts dig
My hopes hurnt from inside
All what I like, all what I believed
Now dead littering is in mud of your pleasure
I vomit of your laughter, I suffocate of your pleasure
Why don't dead see me and living ones pass me by?
So alone, still alive, I wanna rot!
Drowning in that fucking words
You hammer into my head
I want to die and to live
One day living and then dying in pain
Is that your wish?
You are full of lies and pus
And I die inside you
