Your fast heart beats I conduct
Breathe...
I will dominate you, your body and mind
Bleed...
Be a part of my gore masterpiece
Eyes like windows flung wide to fear
Breathe...
As I carve bizarre ornaments
Bleed...
The body as costume for tragedy you will act
This deadly slab will be your stage
Resurrected in my disgusting parody of life
Dance steps to blood-draw I will let
In this swaying move something wonderful in
As dead ballerina on leading vein-thread
You will dance for no audience of my sick brain
For tones of silent tender music
And then in fall of applause you'll die
Close your eyes, you'll be a powerless actress
Breathe...
My lethal choreography only for you I write
Bleed...
Beautiful in quite suffering you'll be immortal for ever
Death is like a blood red sunset
Bleed...
Ascent as a glimmering postmortal star of mine
Bleed...
Our macabre showtime is beginning now
