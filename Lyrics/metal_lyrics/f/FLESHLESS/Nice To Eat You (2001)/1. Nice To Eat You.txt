It was sudden as a flash
As we looked eye to eye
In that moment time had no role
The lust in your sight I felt
...Lust for corporal touches
Violence and tender of sexual love
No style was strange for you
But I am not so fucking sure
We want the same thing to do
...As we scrutinize each other
I wipe my saliva-streams
From my hungry mouth in clandestine
As you turn your face away from me
But our love glowing up
...Will take different way
Nice to meet you, nice to kiss you
Nice to lick you, nice to fuck you
Strangled you've a surprise in your eyes
It doesn't matter we fall in love
Love is so close to epicureanism
And my passions are the proof
...So damn apparent
Each piece of your tragic body
Will have place in my evening menu
Be this grilled, be that fried
Searchiing for in recipe book
...Chinese. Greek or Japanese?
It will be so nice
To spend the time with you
The best thing is just coming now
What a shame you can't taste
Wish me please good appetite
Nice to meet you
Nice to eat you, nice to puke you
Nice to shit you, nice to eat you
