Fleshpiles of tissue mass
Lethal velocity
These creatures put to death
With tire impression
They lay on the lanes
Yes, it's my larder
I can choose everything I want
Whatever takes my faney
To appease my strange taste and hunger
A roadkill recipe
Cooked it will be
Shriveled piece of flesh
A steak with asphalt mesh
I need no recipe book
So let us fucking cook
Shapeless roadkill pancake
Firstly deboned and sliceed
And then corned in sweet-hot sauce
The scent of ripe meat
Mixes with odour of spice in bizarre
As in flame of burner I grill it
At last dinner can be served
I love the couvert fantasy
Whatever will augment that taste
A roadkill recipe
Cooked it will be
Shriveled piece'of flesh
A steak with asphalt mesh
Yes, kiss the cook
And then you can puke!
