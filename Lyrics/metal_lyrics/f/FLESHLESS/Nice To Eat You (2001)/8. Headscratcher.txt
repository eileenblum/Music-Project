I reach inner space of your head
To scratch the remains of my dreams
Storeed in your reeecking mind
Where everything is dying fast
You can't imagine the life
With that infinite pain
Strike down the suffer bound inside
And start to think of death
How to survive another day inside your head
I want to find that forbidden world
Hidden in turns of your hate
Controlled by brain's brutality
I curse the day when my eyes saw you
I hate the voice you spoke to me
I'll never learn why...Why is was happened
