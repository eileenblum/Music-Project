I lived in doubts of life
You saw that and stood onwalls of dumb
I was deaad in slumber
In was blind in life
And you stood with your back turned to me
I laughed as it was mad
He came to me in my doubts
As I slept he told me
I am the chosen one
He told me about his power
Peelings and moods
As he's been grinding the world with his hand
In heads of others
As he's worn clothes
Of other's blood
As I'll be in shaeds with him
Shaeds of pain, suffer and urge to live
I ask if it's mad to dream like that
The life is just like this
Everybody enjoys other's shame
Everybody smiles as others suffer
You let me to flounder in pain
You stood on walls of dumb
You slept in your circle of silence
You stood with your back turned to me!
