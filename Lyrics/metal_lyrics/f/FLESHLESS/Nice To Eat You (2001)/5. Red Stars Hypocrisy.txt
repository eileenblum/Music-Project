Would I like to say thank you?
For these millions tormented
For thousands maimed
No! I want to kill you
Now you act like nothing happened
Red flags like never flapped in winds
There's array of your peaaasant no more
You saluted from your pedestal
Concentration camps filled with the honorable
They were enemies of country and government only
They were not wanted witnesses of present time
So they've to live their lives in infamy and oblivion
Fictive actions incourt with predefined rules
Written by you - red stars hypocrites
They've no chance to save themselves
Human's life...Gor you a valueless commodity
I wish you the death, for that all
I want to see tear drops of your pain
Senile ruins facing the suffer
