Motivations gone
Desperate end is coming
Lost the will to run
Thanks God I am dying

Staying alive or better be dead
Empty look with eyes wide open
Rotting body, infection is spread
Drowned soon in the bloody ocean

Dead never dies
No rest in pieces
Dead never dies
In the world of corpses

Prepare for the path of pain
'Cause you die only once
You'll be never dead again
So kill the rest with indulgence

Dominating crippling rage
Lack of sadness, remaning hate
Frenzy unleashed from the cage
Opening the evil gate

Dead never dies
No rest in pieces
Dead never dies
In the world of corpses
