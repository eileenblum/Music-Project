Rotting Lord
O' Decrepit One buried beneath earth
Entombment be damned, festering plague spill forth
Ruinous expunge, evil unleashed
Descent in hate with his name on our breath
Ancient chants we speak
Evoking the one
True Father of Man

Flames on the rise
Ascending from abhorrent planes
Smiting the will of God again
Flames on the rise
Ascending from abhorrent planes
Smiting the will of God again
Flames on the rise
Ascending from abhorrent planes
Smiting the will of God again
Flames on the rise
Ascending from abhorrent planes!!

Quiving world plunges
Deeper into the abyss
Souls in fear turn fire
Licked by foul embrace
Returning to the Maker
The one true Father of Man
Claiming his kingdom again
A hate for the Holy one
Deep and perverse
Throttle embers higher
Burning hotter and hotter
Until the sky is lit ablaze
O' Rotting Lord come forth!
Come and reclaim our kingdom
We know no other truth but you

Flames on the rise
Ascending from abhorrent planes
Smiting the will of God again
Flames on the rise
Ascending from abhorrent planes
Smiting the will of God again
Flames on the rise
Ascending from abhorrent planes
Smiting the will of God again
Flames on the rise
Ascending from abhorrent planes!!
