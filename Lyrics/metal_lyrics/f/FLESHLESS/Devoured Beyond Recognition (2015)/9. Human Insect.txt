Caricature of humanity
Worse than the meat-fly
Another fatal fault
Gets you high
You inhuman bastard
You have no right to live
We will smite you
And we will achieve

Life sucking asshole
To leech and to infect
You fucking scumbag
You pestilent insect!

So be resected
Just kill 'em on the sight
You are expected
There errors must be fight

So be erased
You've no place to hide
Let's start the chase!
End 'em with pride!

Life sucking pisshole
To leech and to infect
You fucking scumdog
You pestilent insect!

Caricature of mortality
Much worse than the plague
But we will get you
Gun or the blade?
You distorded bastard
You have no right to exist
We will smite you
With our iron fist
