Fuck this world, make it clean
Rancid souls and rancid dreams
Perfect idea and distorted genes
Broken identity, my visible deformities

Scratched perfection, abrased feeling
There's no way for normal healing
My psyche I had to cut
Take a chance to kick my butt

Life confirmed, death canceled
Death confirmed and life canceled
Eaten now and back again
Very strange kind of game

Twisted me and twisted you
Sadness now we are going through
Just the pain and the real redolence
Where to have to set defence?

Mind is split and chewed one more time
None knows where is the line
Torn and crushed is my spine
I am not living but feeling fine

Life confirmed, death canceled
Death confirmed and life canceled
Eaten now and back again
Very strange kind of game

Looking for perfection, looking for good
Your life is fetid and my words are so rude
Mental breakfast all meant for food
There is nothing to change my mood

False prophecies and false words
False meanings and false sorts
Brilliant things given and then taken away
I have now nothing to say...

Life confirmed, death canceled
Death confirmed and life canceled
Eaten now and back again
Very strange kind of game
