For aeons we have walked the world savage
A millennia of suffering
Given bodies unto frigid lands
And willed ourselves to stand again
Earth shifts its fickle demeanor
Adaptation of man
Building to withstand
A rage she harbors deep inside
For those who won't conform
Caught within her sights
A millennia of perseverance
No longer merely surving
We know better than the earth
We shun her fickle ways
Contorting her to our desire
Plundering her wealth
Ushering a time of progress
Where all our needs are met
The wilds we have tamed
Now claimed as home
Technology is our God now
Nothing natural sacred
Angry earth, devoid of its soul
Stripped of all she provides
Slowly she dies, rotting to the core
A final gasp, last breath of life
She withers, her flesh cracks and sags
Her chest implodes, we sink below
In tears we are drowning
Returning to the womb of our mother
We see our own demise in the rupture of her heart
We are consumed by her critical mass
Earth and man to dust
Poetic retribution, mankind fall
