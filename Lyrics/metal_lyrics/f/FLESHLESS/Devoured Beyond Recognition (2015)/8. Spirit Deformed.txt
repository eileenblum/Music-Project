Daily lies fall from the sky
Money talks to politicians in black
Entire world it's time to die
Ther's no enemy keeping the track

Vote for the spirit deformed
Easy ride to hell not back
Vote for the spirit deformed
Breaking the mankind neck

Eternal greed turning day in night
Deadly feasting on remains
Tons of corpses burned with delight
Sickening mind out of the chains

Worldwide slaughter of the weak
Covered by justice of the dead
Unseen enemy is what they seek
Thoughts trapped within their heads

Vote for the spirit deformed
Easy ride to hell not back
Vote for the spirit deformed
Breaking the mankind neck

Apocalyptic army of pain
decorated with the signs of death
Drives the world insane
And suffocate thy breath

Terrible anger and wrath
Spreading mind evisceration
Sadistic abuse, bloody bath
Total conscience annihilation

Vote for the spirit deformed
Easy ride to hell not back
Vote for the spirit deformed
Breaking the mankind neck
