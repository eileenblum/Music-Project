Born as rotten, born as foul
Evil to the core and very soul
Your senseless blabbering I don't care
Try to cross me, don't you dare

Screening your fear I am so glad
Tearing your wishes inside your head
Feeling your dread it is so cute
I have some more to execute

I am an epitome of malefice... So be my sacrifice
Bored of all of you... My twisted paradise

Face of horror, let there be dark
In confused brain ther's no sign of spark
My evil mind linked to yours
Your worst nightmare, my power's source

Sardonic grin and slobbering lips
When I'm trying my violent tricks
Ruptured in one burst of evil deeds
Where the cruelty insidiousness meets

I am an epitome of malefice... So be my sacrifice
Bored of all of you... My twisted paradise
I am an epitome of malefice... It is my sacrifice
Born for evil, born for ire... All you lived for is a lie!

Encyclopaedically done...
All good is gone...
Is gone...
