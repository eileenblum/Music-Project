Soft tissue removed, slowly niblled away
Thousand of small teeth, million of bites
Your body looks like a pulped mash
Sick vermin is feasting all over night

Devoured... Beyond... Your recognition
Devoured... Beyond... My recognition
Our recognition...

Facial muscules feed the worms
Lips and wet cheeks are slowly dripping off
Eye ball in socket fits no more
A putrid vapour urges to cough

Devoured... Beyond... Your recognition
Devoured... Beyond... My recognition
Our recognition...

No sign of shape and form is missing too
Liquified torso, grubs writhing in your flesh
Massively bloating and sickly deteriorated
Indentification's impossible of this human trash

Devoured... Beyond... Your recognition
Devoured... Beyond... My recognition
Our recognition...

Fingerprints slipping down in smeary mass
Bones are shimmering with the gloom glow
Eat-traces ruined whole you head
Indentification's impossible of the half-eaten clown

Devoured... Beyond... Your recognition
Devoured... Beyond... My recognition
Our recognition...

Devoured... Beyond... Your recognition
Eaten... Beyond... My recognition
Digested... Beyond... The recognition
Devoured... Beyond... Our recognition...
Beyond recognition...
