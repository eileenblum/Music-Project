Watching The Mirror
See The Perfect Body
Thinking You're A Princess
Others Are Just A Trash
You're More Than Human
You're TV Star...
No Good You Don't Feel
His Eyes Full Of Lust
Watching You Naked
When Taking A Shower...
Even If You'd Know About It
There Is No Chance
'Cause You're Enough
Beautiful To Kill
Finally Meet Him
Face To Face
The Best Day Of His Life
Is Coming Up
It's His Eternal Dream
Don't Cry Anymore
Prepare For The Pain,
Prepare For The Pain.
Killed Beauty
Overfucked Body
Burried Corpse
Awaiting The End
This Is Your Last
Movie Action
Need No Lights
No More Suffer...
This Action Is Your Last
And The Best As Well...
Even You'd Know About It
There Is No Chance
'Cause You're Enough
Beautiful To Kill - Beautiful To Kill
