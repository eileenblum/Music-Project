Turn Left
Finding A Joy
From The Death
Of A Strange Human
Turn Right
Thinking It's Better
Rise Of Brutality
All Deviations
Mangled Remains
Full Of Worms
Blood And Gore
Around The Table
Not A Professional Autopsy
But Well Disfigured Body
No More Hungry
Feeling Good
Eat, Vomit, Bleed, Die
Eat, Vomit, Bleed, Die
Eat, Vomit, Bleed, Die
Mangled Remains
Full Of Worms
Blood And Gore
Around The Table
Not A Professional Autopsy
But Well Disfigured Body
No More Hungry
Feeling Good
The Real Humen Love
Is Eternal
Just When Comes
Through A Stomach
Your Piece Of Flesh - Will Be A Piece Of Me!
Your Piece Of Flesh - Will Be A Piece Of Me!
Wanna Go Back?
Don't You Know It's Impossible?
Only One Certainty
One Day You'll Die...
