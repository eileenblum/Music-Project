Thought the higher justice works
taking your body
beyond the border of suffering
out from the terrific reality
going with you thru the life till death

Inhuman torture
in mad condition
testing new narcotic
on your full mind
brain must explode

The Pain is Domain

Suffering, screaming
Consensual self pissing
there is no end but why?
you wanna die, die
right now, please, help...

Whre is the limit for human psycho?
it is long time ago-your hair is grey
They are smiling when increasing the torture
your body is brokenly shaking

The Pain is Domain

Even they are mortal
praying on altar
making confession
but where is the true?
Praying the same god
that support these frights....

The Pain is domain
