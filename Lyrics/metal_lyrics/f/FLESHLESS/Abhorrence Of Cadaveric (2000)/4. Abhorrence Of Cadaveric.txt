Fear of god
limited mind
good or not
mystical fight

Hate of church
possessed by evil
truth is in fire
justice from the devil

Shadows in the dark
violence giving power
the pope is the saint
and lord is the lier

Terrific dream
of cataclysm
hell is the heaven
for damned nation

Poor is a man
who trust in god
forgotten himself
saying I am not

Abhorrence of cadaveric
Abhorrence of cadaveric
