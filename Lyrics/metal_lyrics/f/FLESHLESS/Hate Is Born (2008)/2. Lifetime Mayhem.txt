With the loss of vital power
My roaming is useless
In second changed my life
What a fragile existence...

Kill the offender!
Spreading the fear
Pain is his stupid fascination
Increases and gets stronger

Lifetime Mayhem
Eye for an Eye
Lifetime Mayhem
Let him to Die

Bleeding mouth and soul
Caused that I've lost my Faith
With the painful memories
on my way of life and hate

As ever! Forever - without aims
Possessed by own stupidity
Blind, simple, boring...
Tortured by perverted mind
[2x]

Lifetime Mayhem
Eye for an Eye
Lifetime Mayhem
Let him to Die

Revenge is coming
Blood all around and lot of pain
Energy in circle coming back
Back to him, cutting his vein

Lifetime Mayhem
Eye for an Eye
Lifetime Mayhem
Let him to Die
[2x]
