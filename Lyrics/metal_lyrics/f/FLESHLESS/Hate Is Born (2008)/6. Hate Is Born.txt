First breath, first gulp and no effort to live
But it is here
Ready to be treacherous, ready to deceive
No soul's crystal clear
From ancestor to predecessor, the deepest disbelief
A predator to fear

Hate... is born, hate is born
There's no good in the human being
Hate... is born, hate is born
No love left around the world
And all good will?
Bullshit...
Just hate is born

Hate is resection, hate is possesion
Hate is a reflection, our so-called perfection...

Second breath, second gulp and still it is the same
And it will be
Infinite and perpetual, like a game
God's dead indeed
So powerful, another to kill, another to maim
We're unwished breed

Hate... is born, hate is born
Since first men was spawned
Hate... is born, hate is born
No love left around the world
And all good will?
Bullshit...
Just hate is born

God's fault we are, suppurating wound
To be amend
I hate you and you hate me, our morality tomb

Cry and lament...
It's no place for me
No life to live too
Here hate is born...

Hate... is born, hate is born
There's no good in the human being
Since first men was spawned
Hate... is born.
