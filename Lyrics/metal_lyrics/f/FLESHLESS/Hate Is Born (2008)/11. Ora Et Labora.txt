Having no choice
Because end should come anytime
Woking for life, worked to death
And all the time they lie

Faith will save you
Work will set you free
Trust if you are moral
Ora et labora...

Meat processor
Seething human flesh industry
Praying for death in senseless life
All to be devoured

Just faith, and no more future
No chance to flee
Trust if you are moral
Ora et labora...

Working in carnage, working with lust
And another punch, an another blast
Valueless comodity, a feeble prize
New carnivourous order to rise

Faith will save you
Work will set you free
Trust if you are moral
Just faith, and no more future
No chance to flee
Trust if you are moral

Stripped from life, and torn assunder
Death is cheap, just mind to plunder
Bleeding and suffering, price of faith
Religion will save you, expose face...

Having no choice
Because end should come anytime
Woking for life, worked to death
And all the time they lie

Faith will save you
Work will set you free
Trust if you are moral
Ora et labora...
