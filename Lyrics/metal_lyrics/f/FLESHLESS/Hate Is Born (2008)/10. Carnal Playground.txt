I feel your fear, I can feel its smell
Wet belly, sweating forehead
So cold, it is so cold
Trembling with desire to live
But I can promise, you'll never get old
Fixed beauty, preserved from hell
...Of life
...And Rotting

Gorgeously clean, innocent and untouched
But still here's something left undone
Breathless and helpless
Shivering under my hot lustful hands
It should be slow but almost painless
Just your bleeding will be watched
...Running
...Maybe

Don't be afraid, it is a perfect play
Young body like a theatre, where's nice to act
So vulnerable, such venerable
So vulnerable, such venerable
So vulnerable, such venerable
So vulnerable, such venerable
Like a Venus embodied, naked in front of me
When alone feeling sickly miserable

My ecstasy is near
As you're to cum too
Nails scratch my back
Vulgar words to hear
We are a strange couple
You accepted my role
And I accepted yours
So set up your fucking hole
I am almost melting
When your tongue attacks
I want to be eaten
From my top to sting
...And victim for tomorrow?
...No one else than me!
