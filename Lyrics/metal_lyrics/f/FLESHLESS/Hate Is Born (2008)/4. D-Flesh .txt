Hacked, gutted, pulverized
None should recognise
The original form
You are hacked, gutted, pulverized
To adorn

Cut, pounded, dissected
Flesh piles of resected
My guinean pigs
You are cut, pounded, dissected
And no eyelids

Deflesh, meet your fate
Meet the god, deflesh
Meet my lancet
Just meet me.

Bled, battered, scrutinized
My tools are cannonized
To take you to heaven
You are bled, battered, scrutinized
An angel number seven
[2x]

Hacked, gutted, pulverized
None should recognise
The original form
You are hacked, gutted, pulverized
To adorn
