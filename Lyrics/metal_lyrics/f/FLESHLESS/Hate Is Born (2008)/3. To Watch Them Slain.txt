Eye on screen
To watch them die
To watch them slain
To watch them down
Their pain is keen

I like to see people die, closely
But in quiet privacy...
Hidden from their fading sights
My perfidious fancy...
I need to watch something die, statedly
Just watch...

Blood red or purple dawn
My morning ritual
My evening ordinance
My midnight possession
When someone's to be gone

I love to see you die, closely
And no distance...
Still watch...

Killed by someone
Raped by myself
Torn by the fury
Cut by your own hand
This is a long end
For me...
[3x]

I had to see you die, closely
With my assistance...
Hidden from your hidden sight
Your blood's fragrance...
I had to watch all of you die...
Just watch...
