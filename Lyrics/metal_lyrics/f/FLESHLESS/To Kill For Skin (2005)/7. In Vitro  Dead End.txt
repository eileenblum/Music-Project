Deadly reflections leaking rom gloomy
exponates
disintegration tubular horro fills this narrow
space
art prepartion im turning human remains to
fester diction in my glass thesaurus thats what
I do

This is dead end
in vitro world is like graden of past
its my dead end
where everything stops time flows not too fast
in vitro dead end
gallery of strange so empty sights
heres your dead end
in virtro dead end

The silent flasks ad vials of your own me
face full of understanding no deaths to be
stripping dead masks lifes funny masquerade
no rights are fucked pending you're finaly free

That is dead end
in vitro graves are like orchard of lust
its my dead end
where everything starts time flows but here
stops
in vitro dead end
gallery of strange so empty view
here's the immortality clue
in vitro dead end

Dead plates of humans bottled with such care
I do more donations deposition in my heirs
instead the funeral dirge I lavage your carthly remains
Lysol eternity thats all you are to gain

This is dead end
in vitro world is like graden of past
its my dead end
where everything stops time flows not too fast
in vitro dead end
gallery of strange so empty sights
heres your dead end
