Array of disarray
face twisted to groin
order in mess mess in order
nonverbal communication
Gets you high
and dim

Match in mismatch
mismatch in match
disturbing in match
disturbing tremble
mental scalds are mended and patched
raptured and torn
sophistically dissipated
waiting for limbo
to grudge

Grudge gear drives me
grudge gear opposes me
grudge gear binds me
grudge gear rushes me
then and again

The grudge gear

Eat or devour
That reverse feeding
propels me and slows me down
the grudge gear I vitalize
Malice in veins
After death to memorize
resecting my dream
to nourish my own

The grudge gear

Grudge gear drives me
grudge gear opposes me
grudge gear binds me
grudge gear rushes me
then and again
