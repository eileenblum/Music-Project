Tormented souls
and shredded soldiers
from the former
land of freedom
where parents pay
the highest tax
with lives of their sons
for the bush and bucks

They possessed their minds
made from blind morial slaves
far from home with bullets and mines
finding just eternal desert graves

Blood for oil, oil for money
They'll never more hear
Come back home honey
for American dream they dying is near

They pay hard
and the price is so high
useless sacrifice
and death for lie!

CONTRACT OF BLOOD
signed just for their profit!

CONTRACT OF BLOOD
only one god can judge it!

CONTRACT OF BLOOD
victory means we all loose it!
