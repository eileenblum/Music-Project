Thoughts of black are drawing near
as the smell of death incoming clear
God can't be far away
pushing the needle into my vein
my adrenaline begins to rise again
all I need is more and more
injcting deadly posion unto my skin
this living nightmare starting the final gore

FINAL CUT
too late for God
FINAL CUT
feel the flowing blood

Thoughts of depression go through my brain
I'm taking the knife crying in vain
hating to exist with this confused mind
I feel the real need to stop it forever
filled with cadaverous pleasure
red plagues spreads around with the time
swarms of vermin pathetic wounded
just human fragment wihile bleeding is gutted

FINAL CUT
too late for God
FINAL CUT
feel the flowing blood

Satisfaction of ending over a body of lividity
this suicide kill causes schizophrenia in my mind
from the drugs flowing thru the brain
living the hell on earth abominated of the fear
encouraging himself to do this now
loosing control over his own body
preparing himself for the mighty death coming
he took out his knife starting to cut

FINAL CUT
too late for God
FINAL CUT
feel the flowing blood
