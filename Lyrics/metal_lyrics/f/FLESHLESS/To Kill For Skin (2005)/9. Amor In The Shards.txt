The fragile power
collapsing like glass
fragmented lasiviously
into the shards
each piece is bursting
with will for life
descanting the choirs of death
mental depths to dive

Thousands shards my armor is in
I love her so much but border's so thing

Everything seemed to be so clear and done
and there was no need
but the sky faded out like your eyes
when you started to bleed
fear and dispair I brought in my hand
you bleeding beauty a logical trend
I am loving you i am killing you
feel your homme fatal
the scent of fresh such deep injuries
cheerish so foetal
dead as the aborted unwanted child
it was a suicide of my very own mind

Thousands shards my armor is in
I love her so much but border's so thing

You were really strong
atrabilitiy
Shit it was not me
my ability
fractured in sick dreams
all blood I washed clean
you loved I killed you
I think I showed you
that borders are so fucking thin
