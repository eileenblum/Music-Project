Oh for this I'm wasting my strength and for fighting I'm wasting my life

I wont go down I was too passive to afford that luxury

I have to see who's walking in front of me
'Cause if I'm planning to look up
I wouldn't see who's walking in front of me
Oh would it be better when we die
Watching this sky I see ONLY CLOUDS

All the gods and saints we prayed
they are not here in the real life

PLEAAAH!

All that you find written in books

THEY'RE ALL LIES WE LIVE IN LIES

When life seems so wrong
Trust can make everything
When life seems so wrong
We are here to save the day

For the world we speak. He is not dying. We're killing him !

We all love the freedom
The same freedom that now we repay
With the smell of war and our world infected with the prayers to false gods.
Do you feel the smell of war?

Oh would it be better when we die
Watching this sky I see ONLY CLOUDS
