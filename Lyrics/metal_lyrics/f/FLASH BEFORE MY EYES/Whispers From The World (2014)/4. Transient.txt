We're falling in this hole forcibly uprooted from every grip
We are so short sighted that we call danger what we don't know

Follow false wise 
you will break your conscience down
hear the footsteps 
They are the slaves kicked out 

We have the power to split the world

WHO THE FUCK YOU THINK YOU ARE 
This people will not accept
Who you think you are
OH you are no one

What is science without thinking minds
What are the leaders without followers

We're falling in this hole forcibly uprooted from every grip
We are so short sighted that we call danger what we don't know

while losing hope in a place i can call home
Feelings inside 
they fall from my eyes

We are so short sighted
From the dust they craft our lives
And from the hell they bring us lies to make us blind

What is science without thinking minds
What are the leaders without followers

Own your culture
Own your culture
Sweep away all ignorance
We are alone
Our lives are nothing but lies
