In your life there are many moments that have been hidden
In your life you met his eyes just to see what's not yours

All your dreams were denied set for the task that they've required
Live oppressed waiting for the day the one you call father will take you away

Oh forgive us for the way we meant life we thought it was a right and not a gift
And give me back the time we wasted just one more chance to feel alive

WRONG!

Poor girl you are
Poor men we were

Truth of the men we sway
Truth of the men we are
Truth of the men we sway
We've bound our souls

We are leaving together
We've bound our souls
We are leaving together
We've bound our souls

All your dreams were denied set for the task that they've required
Oh forgive us for the way we meant life we thought it was a right and not a gift
And give me back the time we wasted just one more chance to feel alive

I'm heading to the time
I'll see you hoping for your skin to blow
Oh in my life I've been dreaming to avenge
A warm feeling of respect

We are leaving together
We've bound our souls

When all your dreams are denied
Will all the fables be rewrited

When all your dreams were denied
We've bound our souls

We are
We are
We're a lost dream they denied.
