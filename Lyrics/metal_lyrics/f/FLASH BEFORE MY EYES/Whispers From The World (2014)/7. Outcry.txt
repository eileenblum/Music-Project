[feat. Garrison Lee of ERRA]Have you
have you faith in my words of love?
discard all these lies

own your nation
is where you can buy your disgrace
is all about your choice

Find your strength upon the voice and time we spent
Fight this doom
raise up

I will speak doctrine
I will pray for a brighter sun
I will soar
I will pray for a brighter sun

All united as we are meant
Because a split is what they seek
Because a split is a world wide

END!

we are the children of the
blood that now recall
our ancestors have paid
to gives us a brighter sun
let's payback the price they paid
we own more than what we believe

now it is time to set yourself aside
take a step forward and walk into the light
I cannot see with my own eyes

Are you preying too
or you just flee to live as slave?

I'm waiting for some clear sign
I'm living for what I believe
I'm waiting for the truth they hide

Grow
Grow some balls
This is a call to arms
We're fighting for each other
We're fighting for a brighter sun
