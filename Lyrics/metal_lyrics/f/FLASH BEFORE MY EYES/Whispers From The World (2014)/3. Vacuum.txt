The best we can do
Means nothing to the world

Blinded from the truth we hide
Blind for the years to come
If there is no love how could we thrive in peace

Take my hand is time to fly above the sorrow we deployed
We are so close in the journey we're in
So take your time to set your life
A thousand shining lives
They are so close in the journey we are in

GET UP GET UP
This is a song to say

We are not anymore able to speak some bastard are buying our words

How long can they ignore this half lived life?
So take my hand,is time to fly, the journey we are in

Blinded from the truth we hide
Blind for the years to come
If there is no love how could we thrive in peace

Life is so precious they can't understand
I will rip out the truth from their eyes

With all this hate we could build cities
With all this hate we could build a brighter sun

Take my hand is time to fly above the sorrow we deployed
We are so close in the journey we're in
So take your time to set your life
A thousand shining lives
They are so close in the journey we are in
