We traveled the world
We brought peace to the souls
We gave everything to be something more
And when the day has come the seas rose to the sky
to unite as one and cleanse all of our kind

We will never be free if we base our lives on death
Our journey means more than a street to this dark

We are meant to paint papers that are meant to be white
Like a mother raises her son to be like the man she loved
Embrace your world

We will never be free if we don't let 'em get that feeling that we carry inside

If we don't let the feelings,oh we will never
oh no we will never be free
