Ice cold torture burns our skin deep to the bones
The wind blows our hope to be someone
I have put everything I had inside a world that is rotting from inside
give up hope day by day
Swallow our pride to stay alive

Time to end this
They keep telling us stories traded by time
You can ear my far cry yelling to the gods of space

If you snapped your tongue while you were selling your friends
the blood you poured will now sink down your mouth
We always searched for the light to see what we are
We realized in the dark what the demons are
We need new eyes

With some brand new
Now I can see
What we're today!

The famine makes the snakes bite their mother's womb
Ice cold torture burns our skin deep tot he bones
The wind blows our hope to be someone
From that depth you always knew you were selling your soul to be free from regrets

If you snapped your tongue while you were selling your friends
the blood you poured will now sink down your mouth
We always searched for the light to see what we are
We realized in the dark what the demons are

With some brand new
Now I can see
What we're today!
When this world comes down
we hold our hands and blame the lord
that we all
We all praised

We are the hope that lives today
We are the one that saves the day
