All the ignorance can't stop what I behold with the eyes of hope
This is a mayhem I'm full of feelings that I cannot explain
This is my dream
still I sleep I wont forget it

I'm back to claim our rights,the right to dream of a better world
we are back to claim our right
the right to sing to all of you

In the end we are only memories
If people don't remember us
we just fade away
We just never been

All the ignorance can't stop what I behold with the eyes of hope

My mind is so fragile I can't see the best of me

In all of this
They are calling my name
Everyone's calling my name
'Cause everyone
has something more to say

And to me your world means nothing
nothing without the right to sing again.

This is my dream still I sleep I wont forget this

And no one will lead us to the end of our days

We are back to claim our rights

We are the memories of a perfect world in our dreams
We are the whispers of a perfect world we dreamt
