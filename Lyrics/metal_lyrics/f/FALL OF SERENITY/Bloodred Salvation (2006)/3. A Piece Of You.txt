I hate to hear you laugh
The memories are fading but my hate continues to grow
I live to see you suffer
You created a monster I've never been
With each embrace I take a piece of you
(I use your thoughts &amp; feelings to shatter
your future
I feed my hatred with your weakness
'cause your life's worth nothing at all)
(Your fears &amp; desperation fills my soul with peace)
With every drop of satisfaction
your traces are wiped away
(Now you're crawling on the floor &amp; I see my task is done)
I look in the mirror- the walls are falling
I'm down on my knees
See the blood of my malicious actions
Smashing down on me
