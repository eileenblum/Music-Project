We're coming straight forward
No-one can ever retard
Stepping closer- Moving further
Inside a fire resurrecting
A blind mirror's reflection
Falling deeper- Smashing harder
We're born as one to die alone
Rotten memories of a fight
Against a force that lives inside
We're hunting the hunter
Damned &amp; forgotten
Desperately running
Exhausting till death
