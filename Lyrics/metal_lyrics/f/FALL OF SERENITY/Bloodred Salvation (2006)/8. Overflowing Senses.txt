Too many puzzles; thousands of fragments
My broken wings; overflowing senses
Tonight I'll take a breath of life
Before the sunrise burns my soul away
Frozen facial expressions
But I can hear my blood flow
Bound hands; I'll never forget
(I broke the chains I wore
but all) The pain and suffering remains
No room for peace on my final journey
Frozen facial expressions
But I can hear my blood flow
Bound hands; I'll never forget
(My hands are shaking, my body's filled with adrenalin; the rain is
hitting my body)
Inside of me I'm free for hours; is this reality or just a dream
