My darkest visions; all my hate
Forgotten dreams; hidden yearnings
My deepest nightmares- Become a bitter reality
Swallowed lies; torn down fakes
I spit out the blood; full of disappointed friendship
The darker my world: the stronger my pain is
The clearer my feelings!
The deeper the cuts (Run through my flesh
The more satisfied my soul is)
Swallowed lies; torn down fakes
I spit out the blood; full of disappointed friendship
Now I'm walking distant ways; roads of freedom
(I'm prepared to feel the knife again
But I'm smiling back to you- Nothing kills me anymore- Nothing)
