I touch your skin as blood's running out of my dead eyes
How am I supposed to win; when there is nothing left to lose
Where's the fire leading me- Too many questions unanswered
Waves crashing down; I'm drowning in it
The storm is threatening; I'm freezing in my own war
I wish the night would go by; but still I hear the demons cry
(Hands are pulling at me; needles in my head
Paralyzed by fear;) No way out of here
Waves crashing down; I'm drowning in it
The storm is threatening; I'm freezing in my own war
All this grief and indifference; It's coming back again
(I can feel it in my blood and in my veins
The cold wind beating my face; gently whispering:)
It's time to leave this place
