Your lies and facades make me sick
As I watch your big words
Returning with an echo of emptiness
Your body turns pale and weak
As I watch your soul
Swallowing the greatest lies of insanity
With eyes wide open I've seen your face
As I watch you becoming
The embodiment of my darkest hate
You scratch my skin &amp; cut me cashes
As I watch you spitting
The venom out of your bleeding mouth
(I crushed the chains that held me down
Though you've almost smothered my fire
The will to live on gave me strength
To see my life was set up by a liar)
