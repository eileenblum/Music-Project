Suffering in a case full of sorrows
My last breath to recall your words
In a moment of fading, I feel the freedom
The freedom of losing ground, (motionless)
A sudden call of peace, (still emotionless)
Time to pretend the redeemer inside
Searching for a final clear thought
No fear; no desperation, I feel the silence
(The silence that is resurrecting, fearless
A deliverance of all your pain, lifeless)
A dangerous time to reach the trap of your own lies
Reaching the point of no return, (The rope is strangling)
(A hole live to raise your remorse, a second to fake our repentance)
Raise your remorse
