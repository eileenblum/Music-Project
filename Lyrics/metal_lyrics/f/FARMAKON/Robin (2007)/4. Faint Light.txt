How everything seems to be turning
After hanging long from one good thing
After despair the faint light
Is now surrounding me

Beautifully revolving
Through sincere tears of pure happiness
Indescribable by words or actions
I content myself with silence

For love I can not
Thank my fate enough
Not divine
But a fortunate coincidence
It still means the world to me

To gaze into the sky
And to see the universe
To feel life itself
Softly caressing me

Everything I have ever craved
Ever needed
Bestowed upon me

And still my part is
Regardless of everything
To never completely understand
The blessing I have been given
