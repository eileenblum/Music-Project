Fainting and vanishing
To a rhythm of a heartbeat
Borderline and near the edge

Slow and firm grip
Cool and lifeless
Patiently parting the world in two

I've never said anything meaningful
Timeless and true
My game was silence

I am but a grain of sand
But nonetheless eternal
Not the lack of direction
But of understanding

The strain in me
Another train into
A temporary death in me

Linear sequence of choice points
The circle of my history
The feelings prevail

Control now
Lost on its way
Like a tear in the rain

The instant of my purity
No excuses, no solutions
Only the helplessness

Before this all ends
I want her to know
Just how much I love her
