Pencil-drawn lines
dancing against the white
like a butterfly with frozen wings
slowly moving the air around

Throughout this strange world
through my doubts and my fears
I see robins in the air

The hurting halo of love
a shape buried into my heart
I fall to dreams stretching
the endless second of departure

For one moment I know
for a fragment I feel
everything necessary

For one moment I forget all the vain and vanishing
from this vast ocean of eternity
I untie myself from the strains of reality
and live another day
