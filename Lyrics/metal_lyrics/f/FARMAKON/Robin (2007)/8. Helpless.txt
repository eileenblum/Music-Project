The warm, dim light
In autumnal twilight
Sets the scenery
For a heart-breaking play

Strangled sorrow
Pains of two
Merciless grasp of loneliness
Uncompromising and endless

I miss the past
I miss the simpler times
Momentary images
And fragrances

To close my eyes
Detach myself
Sink into numbness
And reminisce

Cold streetlights
Damp asphalt
Take me away
Hide me

I can't stay eternally
Sunshine opens me
The feeling slowly
Fades away

Sometimes I feel
Every piece of misery there is
Powerless to avert my thoughts
I let it in
