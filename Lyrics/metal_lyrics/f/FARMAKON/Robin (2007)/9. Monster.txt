Eternal doorway
A gate to truth in despair
I feel caught in the fading headlights

Superiority by misbelief
Violence through delusion
How can one find passion
In such a storm

Even if we all were
Monsters in war
This would still differ
No excuses, no solutions

Beneath lies
An irrational mind
Tempest of anger
Forever burning

Two opposing sides inside
Taking turns in defining an illusion
Inefficient struggle against
Definite destination

A chance to save the sadness
To a later day
What would you do if you
Met him back in '25
