I redraw my wish
line by line
My thoughts retrace the history
to the point where I failed

Pictures of long summer nights
burnt with a bright flame
their flames now
tearing me

I'll shield my love with my fear
reach inside me and I'll never be whole again

and then strikes
this drowse again
a warm depth of fantasy
I float with the streams of ecstasy

A light of a star
A way without pain
I step through the door and walk
again forgetting to fear the fall

I'm forever stuck
between this
and something that happened
in 1969
