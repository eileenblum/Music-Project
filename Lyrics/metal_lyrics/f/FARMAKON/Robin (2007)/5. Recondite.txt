I can't seem to penetrate the shadow
That's hanging over my past
In vain I search for the truth of what I was

Like surfaced from a dream
Guided back from my cage of seclusion
Nevertheless, I'm not going to turn away now
After the years blindness

I remember
But I can't recognize the feelings
Was that really me?
Was that really my voice?

I host memories that only speak when I sleep
I chase the times and the places
And sometimes I find
Yet never all there is

Imprisonment came from beyond my vision
But somewhere it still breaths
Even if it would never be revived again
It will not leave me alone

I at the same time struggle to retain and to forget

But even if I remembered
I would only keep it inside me
For sometimes it is hard to see
Any light at all
