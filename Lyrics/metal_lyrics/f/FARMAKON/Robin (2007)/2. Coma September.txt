I'm facing the infinite
Overwhelming sadness
The heart-breaking beauty
Of the whole world so fragile

I am not the one to carry
The burden of past
But a mere reflection
Of her suffering

Like was she
Like a reflection
Of all the warmth
In this world to find

This is the world's balance in misery
A never-ending time and place
Silently tearing down my voice
A hand so close and yet unseen

I can't help her
With my spirit in white
I'm forever doomed to stand aside
And relive this

A single tear
Stretched throughout eternity
I fall into the world behind dreams
And take my share of the sadness unbearable

I miss you so much
My luminescence
The bringer of light
Into the darkness of this town
