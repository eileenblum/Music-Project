Those moments of serenity
Those dream-like instants
I knew I could let go
And the time would still be

What once seemed so hard
Begins to feel so simple
And what is
I can't comprehend

To be in this
Disabled state of mind
Unable to completely indemnify
All the wrongs of the time passed

As the world
Continues to stretch
I still can recognize myself
What should I have to be afraid of?

When did I become
A potion of poison

My test in courage
Is to go through life
To earn my blood-red stains
