I feel the melancholy of deepening summer night
And I loathe it
The dark shades of green entangle me inside
The dices falling 

Oh with wounded hearts
Accepting the fate
We shall drift apart
And never meet again 

The years gone by, approaching the final step
Will you be there by me? 

Oh with wounded hearts
Accepting the fate
What we thought would last forever
Ends right here 

I touch your cheek through the morning light
Receive a sleepy smile in answer
Whatever is good in this twisted world
It's all here to be taken 

Oh with wounded hearts
Accepting the fate
We shall drift apart
And never meet again 

But till the day arrives
I'll give you all my best
Stand by you in heaven
And in the deepest of hell
