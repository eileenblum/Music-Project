Sprung from total emptiness
Inpenetratable and cold
I'm drawn into the gray
And then only darkness 

I can hear the rain again
And feel the fragrance of fall
I can remember the summer no more
Seems like it never was
I try to run back where I came from
But I fail
The gate closes in front of me
Now already earlier than yesterday 

Raging tempest has reached me
I'm no longer safe
The beauty I saw
It can't hold me now
The more I walk, the more I stray
Long strides in the garden of a withering flower
Trying becomes hard
And hope unnecessary 

I'm willing to curse my past, curse my dream
With which my demons now dance with me
The one now taken away
I'm led away
Like blind 

The beauty I saw
It can't fade forever
I will take into me the cold kiss of reality
I will find a way
