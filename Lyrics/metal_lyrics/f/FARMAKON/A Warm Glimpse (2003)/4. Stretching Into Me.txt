I want to tear my thorn away
The shadow of my end
Once more I see less than yesterday
The vision escapes 

I cry for oblivion
The obscure image embracing me
Alone I can't heal what once was scarred
Still reminder 

Slowly - I spread myself open
Willing - To float through this rain
Slowly - This emptiness is turning to pain
Again - I draw back in fear 

Deep inside me something always screams
But I hide it all under my skin
I wouldn't want to masquerade
Deep inside me something always screams
But I just keep myself still
I can't care of anything anymore 

Injured by a blade of black
As I tear my chest open 

Take this dream I hold
It's cracked and it tears me
Take it as I hold up for you
I don't want it anymore 

Maybe I've just always been
The one to await the dawn shall not rise
I don't want to be
To exist in the world of lies
