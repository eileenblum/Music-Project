My quiet steps
And the sound of being alone
Line my home
Mask the edge of my reality 

Swallowing lament
No more than a fading memory
I cease my steps and lift the rose
Beautiful and so deadly to the sinister side of my world 

In silence I've lived, in silence I've grown
It gave me everything I have in my soul
Here only the echoes of my past thoughts are to follow 

Dusk points a finger at me
From a world I no longer recognize
The circle of thoughts has vanished
My cage is gone 

In depths I am without sin
I have become the wolf that dwelled inside me
Only my nightmares still faintly
Imitate the life I had 

The final comforting
In a silent question
I now cast a shadow
On the arms I have searched for eternity
