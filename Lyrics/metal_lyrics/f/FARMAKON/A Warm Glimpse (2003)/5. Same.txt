I may seem strange to your eyes
But I'm still the same deeper down
Under the surface nothing has changed
You can still recognize me 

My body is torn
into the thing that bit me
It has scarred my skin
but hasn't touched my soul 

I may seem different
but I am the same
I may seem strange to you
But I know who I am
I am still the same
They tried but failed to strangle my soul
I am not drowning 

My voice remains the same
My will, my hope, my love
No one has taken them away
No one has had a chance
