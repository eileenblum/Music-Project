You can still change your fate
And return from where are the haven's or hell's gate
You can still change your fate
And return from the hell's gate
From the hell's gate
Take your last nad only chance and play a game of chess with death

Just like a dry leaf ripped off a tree you'll fall face in the sand
Just like an old rock stoked by a lightning you will turn into dust

On the chessboard put the lives of those who have
Your love and blood in their veins
Take your last nad only chance and play a game of chess with death

Today chess are alive
They have their own past
They don't know their future
They can not scream even though they feel only fear
They can not run even though they feel only fear

Just like an old rock stoked by a lightning you will turn into dust
Take your last nad only chance and play a game of chess with death

With trembling hands you give hope but it fades like a spark
Just one more mistake and you will blow off another candlelight
How many tears how much blood has to soak in the sand
For you to understand that there's no chance for you
To win a game of chess with death
