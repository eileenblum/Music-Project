Blutandrang
Kalte nacht give no dream

Of lurig bliss of dreamed might
I was told one stormy night
Of honoured codes of loyalty
Of innate virtue through royalty

Blutandrang
Kalte nacht give no dream

Since they crippled hath I felt
Kalte nacht give no dream
O alas gerforen heart won't melt
Blutandrang
Kalte nacht give no dream
Blutandrang - ever flowing stream
Blutandrang

Lange dagas of omniscient dark
Kannst nicht lie once got a mark
The nature speak her own language
Blut tutoreth right from wrong
Blutandrang
Kalte nacht give no dream
Blutandrang - ever flowing stream
Blutandrang
