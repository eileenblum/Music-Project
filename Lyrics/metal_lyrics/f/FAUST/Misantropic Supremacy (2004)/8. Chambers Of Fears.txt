My soul needs no mate
Fate seems to be a puzzle
When my caress cut
Neverhealing wounds

My sweet whisper made you old
Light tortures by senses
Sink with me into the dark
Give my shadow
Trespass on to my side

Gloomy clandestine mission
The master I am and his tool
Devoid of consience
Deprived of emotions

My face always facing dusk
Eyes that know no beauty
Welcome to the mental world
Welcome to the red chamber
Of your fears
Of your fears

Born into the world
Of ambiguilty I was
Muse but never blind
Decease I did see of a one
That who just gasped
For his first breath
