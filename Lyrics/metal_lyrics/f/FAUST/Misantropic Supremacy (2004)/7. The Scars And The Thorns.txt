The scars have marked all my life
Long thorns stuck in my crying heart poisonous
No one wants me to believe him
Like an old dog I have dreamed of good death since

Your God with disgust pointed at
Every even the smallest of my imperfections
Wingless I'm standing in the rain
At the end of the world
Which wants to see me no more

You don't sleep don't close your eyes
Maybe I'm in the shadow
You don't turn back to darkness
When you laugh at me
Maybe I'm in the shadow

Why it is me but why can't you live that way
You've sentenced me even though I haven't sinned
Tears in my eyes was I created for them?
Before my curse reaches you
You've got some time to ask my name father!!

The scars have marked all my life
Long thorns stuck in my crying heart poisonous
No one wants me to believe him
Like an old devil I have dreamed of good death since
