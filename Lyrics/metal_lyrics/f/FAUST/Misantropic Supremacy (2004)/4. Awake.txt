Awake! Awake!
Nocturnal howls
I raise my sword
Awake! Awake!
Hear me now
All come forth
I shall not withdraw
Roaming the paths
I'm daring my young soul
To fight for the sake of
The long forgotten laws

Awake! Awake!
I invoke thee!
Day and night
Unseparable
Good and evil
Indiscernible
Awake! Awake!
Hear me now
All come forth
I shall not withdraw
Roaming the paths

Spitting out termbly vows
I'm unleashing mesmeric spells
Criphered in the ancient runes
