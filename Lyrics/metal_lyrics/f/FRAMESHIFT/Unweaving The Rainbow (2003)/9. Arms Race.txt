[Lyrics: Cash/Pauly/Guadagnoli]

I kill you I'm a lion
Snap your neck and leave you bleeding
I kill you I'm a virus
Destroy you once I'm in

I'm running I can't beat you
That's why I am so fast
I'm running down the food chain
This breath could be my last

Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong, the other stronger
Balance shifting, how much longer?

I'll eat you I'm a shark
Sink my teeth into your flesh
I'll squeeze you I'm a snake
Then down you whole while you're still fresh

I'll hide so you can't see me
Make myself disappear
Competition drives us forward
And blind ambition holds us back
Our tool manipulation
Forcing others' adaptation
Nature learns form its mistakes
Takes generations to improve
Can't run from the higher primates
Unchecked intellect devours
Animal communication
Manipulating other's power

Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong, the other stronger
Balance shifting, how much longer?

Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong, the other stronger
Balance shifting, how much longer?

Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong, the other stronger
Balance shifting, how much longer?
