[Music: Pauly/Donlon]
[Lyrics: Donlon/Pauly/Cash]

Down where it's deep
Your thoughts are complete
All you need is a light
This will lead us unsparingly
Toward theories that cut like a knife

And the sun as it sets
Does not go unnoticed
It makes me wonder
How I can focus on.

You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon

Without that invention
I would not be here
Half an eye for me is perfectly clear
So that I find you wherever you are
I am not blind, I just can't see far

And as the sun sets
I will not regret
If I keep on moving
I won't forget

You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon

Each one lashes out at me
I'm drowning in a deep green sea
I will swim for eternity
Maybe one day I will see more clearly

You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon

You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon

You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
