Mount Improbable rears up from the plain
Standing tall in the rarefied sky
Once we crawled along its base
It seemed these cliffs could never be climbed

Unattainable heights they tower above
Drive the bravest man to give up
We know it has been scaled before but how
Can you tell me - do you comprehend

Look around the other side
And you will reach a distant land
Who would have thought that you would find
A gradual ascent

Cliffs and echoing canyons
You'd be right to never ever wanna try

But if you take it step by step
The long way - it will lead up into - the sky

Are you a man with time to spare
If so don't be concerned
The back route's sure to get you there
So tell me what you've learned

How do we fit in
It is not just random
Not like a hurricane
That just kept on blowing

Inch by inch we built
This world of wonders
Still we can't see the top
Don't know where we're going

As you go up the hill you look around
And see other wanderers travel
Each on their own going up
Some rest while others struggle

At the top you will find perfection
It's a place you might never see
Maybe at a different time
Chance brings opportunity - to us

Rise up - go on - until you reach the distant land
Our past seems far below - down the trail

How do we fit in
It is not just random
Not like a hurricane
That just kept on blowing

Inch by inch we built
This world of wonders
Still we can't see the top
Don't know where we're going

Too far along to ever think of turning back
Too far to go to ever stop for rest
What stands before seems far too steep to try

Rise above
And survive
Multiply
And cease to be

How do we fit in
It is not just random
Not like a hurricane
That just kept on blowing

Inch by inch we built
This world of wonders
Still we can't see the top
Don't know where we're going

How do we fit in
Tell me are we sleeping
Can we go another step
And keep on growing
