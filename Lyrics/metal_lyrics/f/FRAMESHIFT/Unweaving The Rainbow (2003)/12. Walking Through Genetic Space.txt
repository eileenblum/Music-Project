[Music: Pauly/LaBrie]
[Lyrics: Pauly/Guadagnoli]

Walk - walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand

Think - open your mind a little more
Breathe - open your eyes and look around
Feel - that you are a part of something else
Come

Now we travel through both time and space
See the beauty this world has made
View the stages one by one
Explore the change - don't be afraid

Walk - walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand

Walk - walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand

Hear - what the row of voices has to say
Speak - ask them questions on your way

Now we travel through both time and space
See the beauty this world has made
View the stages one by one
Explore the change - don't be afraid

Walk - walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand

Walk - walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand

Walk - walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
