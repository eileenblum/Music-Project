[Music: Pauly/LaBrie]
[Lyrics: Pauly/Cash]

Promise me you won't look up
It could change your life
Can you handle what you'll find?

Stories you can not explain
Unfold quite easily
If you see the other side

An open mind
An attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate

We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be
Other lives to live
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars
Or above the grass

A new image in your grasp
Focus getting clearer
Seize the moment, take it in

Count on this - you just found out
Three sides to every story
None more right, not one will win

An open mind
An attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate

We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be
Other lives to live
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars
Or above the grass

We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be
Other lives to live
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars
Or above the grass
