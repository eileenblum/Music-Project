[Music: LaBrie/Pauly]
[Lyrics: Cash/Pauly/Guadagnoli]

Gimme skin behind my legs and arms
And see me glide
Just 'cause it's not soaring
Doesn't mean it can't be flight

10 feet from tree to tree
Is moving to efficiency
Half a wing is everything
If it's all that you need

Gimme wings I wanna fly
Into the air I wanna rise

Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream

Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line - Give me time

Wind currents always keep me lifted
If I can feel it
The abnormality of flying
Is best explained by watching
Avionic aspirations
Following fowl play
Structures of steel and strut
The Wright way through the day

Gimme wings I wanna fly
Into the air I wanna rise

Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream

Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line - Give me time

Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream

Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line - Give me time
