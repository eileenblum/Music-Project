[Feat. Nik Guadagnoli - Chapman Stick]

Life was always there
With that I can't agree
This had to start somewhere
That much is clear to me

All this complexity
Traced back to one event
A single moment of
Naked coincidence

Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance

Take a mountain of rust
And wait for a breeze
You'll still never see a wind that builds
A perfect machine

A universe without design
Or an entity that's blind
Who built a world without a plan
No final form in mind

In the end there is no goal
Only a chain of questions
Be one of those who answer them
Turn off copy protection

Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance
Origins and Miracles
Haunt us day by day
We can make some sense of all
It can be explained

Primate armies slave away
Writing infinitely
Still they can not create
What Shakespeare wrote so easily

Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance
Origins and Miracles
Haunt us day by day
We can make some sense of all
It can be explained
