[Music: Pauly/LaBrie]
[Lyrics: Pauly]

Learn to teach
And teach to learn
Open your eyes
Knowledge returns

Pass on the word
The modern virus
Spread it through the crowd
Watch it grow

Your mother taught you
How to sing a song
Your father showed you
How to tie a knot

Will you teach your kids
In the same way
Coming generations
Will they play this game

What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe

Every single teacher
Has been taught herself
She takes this information
And feeds the new machine

Once there were wise men
Who told a story
Current tales spread on a web
And rumours fuel the pages

What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe

What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
