[Music: LaBrie/Pauly]
[Lyrics: Cash/Pauly]

I lie awake wondering who I am
My dreams don't seem to make any sense
Imagination running wild - it can't satisfy my need

Oceans taunt me - I'm a patron to the coast
Dark seas, cool breeze - today the tide is low

And then suddenly a shape has caught my eye
Calling me - could not resist or pass it by

On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand, circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me

I hold it close - I know there are many more
It's like a gallery - down on the ocean floor
Shapes and patterns infinite - spelling clues to history

Swept ashore - could not resist or pass it by

On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand, circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me

Moved by the swells
Currents will tell
Tell us you story
So many out there
No one just like my
Immortal coil keep on floating

On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand, circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me

I lie awake knowing who I am
My dreams now seem to make sense again
