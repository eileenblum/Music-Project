[Feat. Nik Guadagnoli - Bass and Acoustic Guitar]

A stream it flows through time
Without direction
The current holds the line
Abstract Instruction

The liquid of life - You and I

The banks are line with lies
The future is inside
It flows into a child
A great divide

Blueprints passed down the line

River out of Eden
Flow along through time
Carry all that goes into a child
River out of Eden
Your waters drift apart
You brought a new life - It came into this world

Channels forging their own way
Progress never cease
Information can create

An augmented beast
Elements they test the young
Who then will be released

After the trial of life
Blueprints passed down the line

River out of Eden
Flow along through time
Carry all that goes into a child
River out of Eden
Your waters drift apart
You brought a new life - It came into this world

River out of Eden
Filled with what we are
Keep on flowing far beyond this day
River out of Eden
Your waters drift apart
Maybe sometime new life will find its way
