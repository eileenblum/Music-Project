Born natural machines
For changing information
Changing me
Ride the River out of Eden
The flow of change comes slow
But constantly

Day by day I compete
New brothers in the pool, but wait
Most of them won't stay
Guiding chaos into order
Genetic symphony goes on
A brand new score to play

Take a strand of DNA
Slight mutation every day
Survive so I can make my way
And be passed down - down

You - Them - Him - Her
I drive you
Need to survive you
I'll work you like a clock
I write your story

Does our hero live or die
Remains yet to be seen
I need you to survive
You're my machine

Survival of the species
Third in line behind the gene
Behind me
Compared with the machine
The bloodline doesn't prove as thick
Or change a thing

I'm afraid of crossing over
I try to stay alive in you
Your life paves my way
If I really won this fight
If I am intact I will
Construct without delay

A brand new score to play

Take a strand of DNA
Slight mutation every day
Survive so I can make my way
And be passed down - down

You - Them - Him - Her
I drive you
Need to survive you
I'll work you like a clock
I write your story

Does our hero live or die
Remains yet to be seen
I need you to survive
You're my machine

Mother - Father - Sister - Brother
They fight me
They try to hide me
Inside where I belong
I have played my part

You - Me - We - Are
You are me
Think through it clearly
You work me like a clock
You write my story

Does our hero live or die
Remains yet to be seen
I need you to survive
You're my machine
