Give me sundown till the light
Give me just one long night
Watch me work and slave away
I'll be done when you awake

Marvel at my bed of silk
Marvel at the one thing I can build
I will call this place a home
A trap for the drifter on the run

Deep in a corner where I wait
He will find me I'm his fate
I'll enjoy him day by day
Cause he'll never get away

I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand

Watch the dew that follows lines
Trickle through this web of mine
You see me can't comprehend
I'm a killer - a friend

You see me don't be afraid
Of this crystal I have made
It gives life to my own kind
And there'll be nothing left behind

I'm more than a witches pet
I am more than a beast
I know that I hide in shadows
But there's a little light in me

I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand

Build your own world
No regrets you have
And do what you have to do
For survival

Build your own world without regret
Do what you must to survive

Soon you'll kill me
Soon you'll kill me
Crush my home with you own hands
Soon you'll smear me
Why do you fear me
Cause I build the dreams you can't

I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand
