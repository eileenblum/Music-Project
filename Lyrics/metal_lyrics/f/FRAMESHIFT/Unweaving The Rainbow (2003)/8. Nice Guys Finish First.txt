Come on my friend
Get back to nice again
Let us walk this land
And make it alright

Play this move I make
It's the better way
Let's just do it
And we'll both be fine

I know that there's a chance
You'll stab me in the back
But we'll have none of that
Alright

There's cause to celebrate
Within this game we play
Wash away the hate until we shine

Cooperate - Defect
Resist the temptation
Tit for Tat yes Tit for Tat
Support cooperation
Delightful combination
Play your part

Look me in the eyes
I won't tell you a lie
Let's build a better world
And make it alright

There are people who defect
But that does not reflect
The good ones who elect
To do it just nice

There's something to be said
For being kind to men
You break we only bend
You have no right

There's more than love at stake
This view of life creates
A better living state
For you and I
