[Torture I - Torturing]

Me and you alone now
Are you frightened are you scared
Let my little toy show you how
To scream so loud no one can hear
We're gonna play a game that I enjoy
We won't stop 'til you tell the truth
No matter what - I won't believe
'Cause I just like hurting you:
And that's the truth

This is gonna hurt when I turn it on
We'll be real close till the pain is gone
This is gonna hurt till you tell it all
217 the writing's on the wall
This is gonna hurt gonna make me smile
Think I'll make it hurt for a little while
This is gonna hurt - ain't telling lies
You'll see yourself inside my eyes

Got all kinds of instruments
Each one plays a different tune
A chord of pain, a scale of tears
Now don't be a fool
A grinding rhythm for your bones
A forte for your flesh
Help me write my symphony
Hear the music make a mess

The prettiest thing I have ever seen
Is the sight of you suffering
I don't need to explain
Let the beauty fade and the misery reign

I can't understand why
But your pain keeps me alive
