[War II - Historic War / Personal]

For heritage love and pride
And for this land I'll give my life
Guard against the raping flag
Here's a blade now you're a man
From horse to flaming arrow
You may take a mortal blow
They will underestimate
Damage one man fighting for his home can make

I have no choice but to defend

I draw a line in this dirt with my metal blade
Not gonna cross if you don't believe that
In the end they may take all I love away
But not today

Walls of rock on an empty plain
Give way to greed when it invades
But there's a creed that builds a bridge
Of strength and honor in this village
Stench of death seeps from the ground
I see their eyes fade and turn to stone
Their faces haunt and follow me back home

It is time to take a stand
I have no choice but to defend

I draw the line in the sand
And I'm asking you
Brother of mine
Won't you follow through so
In the end they may
Take all I love away
But not today

With this blade in my hand
I'm ready to conquer
Ready to fight for it all
And if I should die
I will go with honor
Take one more life before I fall
With this blade in my hand
I'm ready to take back
Take back what's rightfully mine
And if I should die
My brothers will come through
Victory's here for my kind
