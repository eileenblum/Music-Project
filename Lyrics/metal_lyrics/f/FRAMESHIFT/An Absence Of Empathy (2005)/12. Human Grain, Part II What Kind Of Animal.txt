[Human Grain II - What Kind Of Animal]

Cradle - Sleeping
Four walls protect my baby
What will your tiny hands hold
Safe in my arms today
Hidden from what I've seen
I hope you never meet anyone I've been

Right now - doubting
If there's anything worth saving
The answer's somewhere on this globe
It's not in politics
Religion cannot fix
Should we turn towards our young

What kind of animal are we
Is there anything else to us
Inside a child is hiding behind the grain

Why die trying
Is there any use in fighting
Let's do right by our own sons
It's not in politics
Religion does not fix
We should turn towards our young

I've searched a million memories
Cut my finger on the frame's rough
And I know I'll never be the same

I've seen pain, so much pain
In every shape and size
I feel scared, oh so scared for human kind
I gotta say, no I gotta scream
What's on my mind

And I
Know I'll
And I know
Know I'll never be the same

What kind of animal are we
Is there anything else to us
Inside a child is hiding behind the grain
