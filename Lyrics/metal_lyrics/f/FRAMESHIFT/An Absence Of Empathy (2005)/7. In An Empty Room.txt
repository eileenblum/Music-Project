[Rape I - The Victim]

Here you sit innocent, your beautiful face
Everything all at once taken away
Even though not everything can be replaced
Yesterday's gone and you still have today

I can see you
Hiding behind broken eyes
It'll be fine please don't cry
You will be OK with me
I can see you, living inside scared and blind
I am right here please don't hide
Close your eyes my child

To rid your mind of all the hurt
And turn gray skies blue
I'd wash away the memory
And make your heart new
No comfort in these clumsy words
No solace no truth
Just to exchange one life for pain
And I'd give mine for you

Oh how time went by - you and I
Used to live that life - that made us smile

I know right now that you don't want me here
Soon the stain will fade -
I'll wipe away your tears
'Cause without you in my life
It just does not seem right
I'll wait right by your side 'til you come home

I can see my presence
Is dragging us apart
It's hard to be so closed off
From you in my heart
Flesh and blood
Can heal and hurt
Time will take away the pain
I'll back away
Give you space
Until you feel no shame
