[Rape II - The Assailant]

They never see me coming
I know their every step
I am the perfect hunter
They'll fall into my trap
You're stronger than temptation
You're a better man than that
A game we both are playing
She doesn't know she's in
I count the times she passes by
Sitting, waiting, getting closer
Can almost feel her skin
Will I make her mine

How long can I resist
No escaping this
You'll never control
The desire that's in me
It's burning my soul
It's a fire of envy

Don't do anything
That you might soon regret
'Cause the mirror must still show
A man you can respect

A girl's just a pawn
A means to an end
I don't dare approach
Never find a lover -
Always find a friend
The answer still is no
The other day she talked to you
No means no - you don't have to
It's not a want, I have a need
And I can feel it rise
Past the point of no return
Then it dies

Please help me
It's taking control of me
I can't hold back much longer
I must set it free

How come this life's a bitch
Why can't this break be fixed
They always persist
Though the thoughts are appealing
I cannot resist them
The siren is calling

Beautiful - I can't escape the pull
Unapproachable - I never get too close
Horrible - the images I keep
Cinema - of filth inside of me
Undeniable - my insecurities

Chain these hands
Before they burn out her light
Make it impossible
For her to face her life
You're stronger than temptation
Please don't lose respect
Up to my neck
Sinking in this quick sand
Begging please hear
This last call
From this desperate man

The girl's just a pawn
A means to an end
And I don't dare approach
