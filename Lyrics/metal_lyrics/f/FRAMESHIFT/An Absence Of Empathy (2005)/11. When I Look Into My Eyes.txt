[Torture II - Being Tortured]

It's just you and me
And a single light to expose my fear
You're holding something in your hand
And I admit I am scared
Your face shows you're enjoying this
I swear I told you everything
It seems as if no matter what I say
You're gonna do it anyway

I can feel you - I can feel me
Now I want it back the way it used to be

When I look into my eyes
I can feel me touching, hurting
And I know the kind of pain
I'll go through
'Cause I've been you

My body feels like you're playing a wrong chord
Like you hit a note out of key
Every part of me is wailing
In perfect harmony
There's a pounding running through my marrow
There's a beat I cannot shake
It's like an anthem to the sick and sorrowed
Your smile's a witness to your hate

I can hear you
I can hear me
Singing screaming melodies

When I look into my eyes
I see you touching, I see you hurting
And I feel the pain inside
I'm not through cause I am you

How could I be the man behind those eyes
And if I am I'm gonna lose my life
But when I do I guess we both will die

I want you to stop, stop all of this
You wrote a score that doesn't fit
I can hear you, I can hear me
Singing screaming imperfect melodies

In the silence I can hear a sound
It makes my heart skip a frame
It's your laughter from another room
I guess I'm not the only one
