[Murder I - Serial Killer]

Guilt is forcing me
To act unethically
When I think I've killed enough
A voice is waking up
Propaganda in my head
Another woman dead
Tunnel vision no white light
Giving in to avoid a fight
Masters pull my strings
Control of everything
That happens on this stage
A puppet of their rage
I try to run away
Desire makes me stay
Every time I try to turn my back
I find them still attached

Tell me is it really sin if all I do is just give in

Gimme just one more that's all I need
To quench this thirst inside of me
Feeling satisfied but beyond the door
The need still cries give me
Just one more

Guilt is forcing me
To act desperately
Must add to my collection
Still improving my reflection
On the outside I appear
There is not a thing to fear
In the basement with my tools
Gotta check your principles
When I work I feel the rush
Dead and living things I touch
Use my skill to take apart
Creating twisted works of art
I know there'll come a day
I might give this away
I'll have to make a choice
Bear the shame or blame the voice

Gimme just one more don't take it back
The next one's gonna be
The best we ever had
Feeling satisfied before the final score
I'll be begging you for just one more

And at their graves they don't mention me
Even though I'm the one
Who put them to sleep
I'll make my name in privacy
For you and I it's time to meet - hello

The need still cries - grant me
Just one more
