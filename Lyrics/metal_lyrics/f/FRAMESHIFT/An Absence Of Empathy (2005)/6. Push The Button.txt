[War I - Modern War / Impersonal]

Caged in metal - my protection
Coordinates they read this direction
Whatever happened to
"Don't fire 'til you see their eyes"
New rules, new ways, more questions
How can I use my discretion
My brothers run by armed and eighteen
While I sit here controlled and waiting
I'd be the first to trade my button for a blade
Battlefields are brought to homes
Where children, babies, mothers roam
One button wills a game
While another one
Blows you away

I can kill with a finger
Can I kill without eyes
I can kill on demand
Can I kill without why
While humanity cries
I will kill in a box
Will I kill in the streets
I will kill my own conscience
Will I kill the peace
When I push the button in my dreams
And you scream
Silent screams
Corporate Schemes
Killing screams

Kill a few to save a lot
Don't tell me, I know the cause
There's no time to make up my mind
Army brass breathing down my back
In a think tank - life in the abstract
We are programmed to attack
When this flag goes on the war path
I'd rather fight this war with just a blade
No more metal sunk into my foe
How can tanks go toe to toe
I get a medal if you go down in flames

Walk away from this fate
Where children scream and cry
Take a new name
Move away from the safe
Out to where the bombs fly - I'll pay
For my sin -
In the state that you're livin' in
Don't wait on me let's begin again
Let me face the consequence
Never gonna hear a soldier cry
Unless you're killin' him
Still gotta push the button
