[Murder II - Impulse Killer]

Beautiful love what makes it up
The pull to end up in your arms
Freeway's packed
With people so naÃ¯ve
As I found out I could be
Off the ramp on down the street
Stop for nothing I can't wait
To feel the press of your lips
On the mouth
That praises you all day
Turn the key enter the house
Up the stairs look around
Fingers feel for my love
Who is that I'm thinking of

Never saw this coming
Backed away hit the wall
Never thought I'd fail you this way
What happened next I don't recall

I killed you -
I guess I just blacked out
I'm still holding the gun
And now there is no point to go on
Without you in my life
All that's left to do
Is to sing you one more song

Now that the deed is said and done
Here comes the violent flashback
Ran down the hall
Got daddy's gun
Blood of the unfaithful
Three bodies one's still breathing
God I wish it wasn't me
I hit 'em both without feeling
You unleashed a beast

Never thought
You'd fail me this way
Betrayed me once,
Once and for all

I killed you - I guess I just blacked out
I'm still holding the gun
And now there is no point to go on
It's your own damn fault
Can't make right what's wrong
There was so much pain so
I killed you
Without you in my life all that's left to do
Is to sing you one more song

I can't believe it's true
What you've done and what I'd do
For my revenge to get back at you
But the beast in me would follow through

You killed me - it's all over now
We should have talked it out
But it's all over now
Nothing to talk about

What the fuck did you think
You could cheat on me
You turned Jeckyll and Hyde
And I made you bleed
I think you got what you had coming
And now I'm free
To let Hyde go home
And let Jeckyll in me
Weep

Why could I not control my rage
Control my anger
Why did you not love me for who I am
And be my life

Yes I killed her and I have to face
That she is gone
Nothing can make right what's wrong
But I won't suffer long

All that's left to do
Is to sing you one more song
To stare into my gun
