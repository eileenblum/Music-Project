[Violence in Schools II - School Shooting]

Inside I know there's two of me
Can I conquer this duality
I try to fight this demon seed
If these walls could talk
You'd hear a piercing scream

(Dear Classmates)
Can I ask what it is like
To win at everything
Some of us were born to lose
'Least that's how it seems
Never had a love that lasts
I'm an outcast looking in
Never had a friend in class
Gave all I had to give

This day might be my last
And after class
I'll settle the score

(Dear Parents)
You know that you failed me
At just about everything
Too busy fighting there were nights
I couldn't even breathe
You know at nine
I just wanted to be loved
But now at seventeen
I know I'm way past that,
I need company in suffering
Bad behavior up to bad parenting -
Oh tell me father where have you been
It's gonna be the worst thing
You've ever seen -
I call it proof, you call it sin

(Dear Teacher)
We could've been more
Than you gave us credit for
Everyone can do something
And in home room you will soon know that
Fuck you! We're capable and you turned it all to salt
Your bitter show of doubt know that what I do is all your fault
We are all capable of something good or bad
You heard them pick on us - didn't do a thing
You're pushing me too far... way too far

Inside there still are two of me
I can conquer this duality
I try to fight this demon seed
If these walls could talk
You'd see what I mean
