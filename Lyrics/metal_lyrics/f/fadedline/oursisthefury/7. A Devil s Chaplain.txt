Now... I am absolutely convinced that the main source of hatred in the world is religion and organized religion. And I think it should be, religion, treated with ridicule and hatred and contempt. And I claim that right.

Religion poisons everything. It infect us in our most basic integrity.

It is a horrible idea that there is somebody who own us, who makes us, who supervises us... To demand this, to wish this to be true, is to wish to live as an abject slave.

If you don't consider me an enemy, you don't know an enemy when you see or hear one.

You better off thinking for yourself and taking all the risks.
The most overrated of the virtues is faith. The metaphysical claims of religion are untrue.

-Why can't you keep your atheism to yourself?
-Because the religious won't allow me to. Because every time I open up the paper thereâs another incidence of theocratic encroachment on free society. Which I won't put up with. Up with which I will not put.
