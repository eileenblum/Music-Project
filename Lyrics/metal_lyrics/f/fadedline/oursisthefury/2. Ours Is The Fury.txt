I don't have to tell you things are bad, everybody knows things are bad... it's a depression!

It's like everything everywhere is going crazy,
so we don't go out anymore,
we sit in the house and slowly the world is getting smaller
and all we say is please,
at least leave us alone in our living room,
let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel belted radios
and I won't say anything, just leave us alone
Well I'm not gonna leave you alone,
I want you to get mad!

All I know is that first you've got to get mad!
You've got to say "I'm a human being god dammit!
My life has value!"

I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!

[The Network]

We are seeing how very important it is,
to bring about in the human mind a radical revolution

A crisis that cannot any more accept the old law

And considering what the world is now,
with all the misery, conflict, destructive brutality,
though man is still brutal, violent,
aggressive, acquisitive, competitive
and he has build a society along this line.

[Krishnamurti - The Real Revolution]

We can say without a doubt that this system is
an absolute failure.

The problem is the system we've created. It is the empire.
And we need to dig it out, get rid of it
and implement a better system.

[John Perkins - On Globalization]
