As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that the future of the
human race requires the cooperation of its members; that our system must
protect our rights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the
individuals to protect their own rights. That a democratic government
derives its just power from the people and that no true democracy is
attainable when the process is determined by economic power.

We come to you at a time when corporations, which place profit over
people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our
governments. We have peaceably assembled here, as is our right, to let
these facts be known.

Join us and make your voices heard!

[Occupy Wall Street Manifesto]
