Forget the politicians, politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.

You have no choice. You have owners.

They own you.

They own everything.

They own and control the corporations, they've long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all the news and
information you get to hear. They got you by the balls!

They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.

You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers.

People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that
disappears the minute you go to collect it.

The table is tilted folks, the game is rigged and nobody seems to notice... nobody seems to care...

Good, honest, hard working people continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don't give a fuck about them.

And nobody seems to notice... nobody seems to care...
