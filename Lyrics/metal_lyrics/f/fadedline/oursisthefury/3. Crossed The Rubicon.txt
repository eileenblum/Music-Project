How ironic, that the cradle of Democracy has been robbed by the bankers,
the politicians and the bureaucrats.

See they using Greece as the excuse for the whole failure, it's a way to
focus the problem on Greece when, in fact, the whole economic system is
collapsing from printing all of this digital money that it's not worth the
paper it's not printed on.

That's all these austerity measures are about, it's paying off the banks
of the Belgians, the Dutch, the French and the Germans that they 've made
bad bets.

For all those little children out there that think they're living in
democracies, the merger of state and corporate powers is called fascism
and that's all this is, is fascism pure and simple. Let's stop this facade
of democracy.

It's class warfare, it's beginning and you're really looking at the first
great war of the 21st century.
