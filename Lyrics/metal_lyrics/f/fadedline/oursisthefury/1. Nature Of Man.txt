We are seeing how very important it is,
to bring about in the human mind a radical revolution

A crisis that cannot any more accept the old law

And considering what the world is now,
with all the misery, conflict, destructive brutality,
though man is still brutal, violent,
aggressive, acquisitive, competitive
and he has build a society along this line.
