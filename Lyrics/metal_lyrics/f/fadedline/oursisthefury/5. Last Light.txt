Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so
that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a
fraction of a dot.

There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits
than this distant image of our tiny world. It underscores our
responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and
cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

[Carl Sagan - Pale Blue Dot]
