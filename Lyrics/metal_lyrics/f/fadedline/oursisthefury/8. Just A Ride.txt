The current socioeconomic system is a complete failure. Not only is it not sustainable, but it slowly destroys the prospects of the human race by creating misery, poverty, violence and destruction.

This system is a cancer. This system must change or we will face oblivion.

Our allegiance is to this planet, our allegiance is to humaninty, ours is the fury...
