Embers in dormancy - the greatest of sins
Damming the blood that flows, closing the veins
Drowning in lethargy, deadly decay
Losing vitality, fading away

Deep-seated malady holds you in chains
Taking its root from the seed that you have
Sucking the life from you, rusting your blade
Arresting your will on the orders you bade

By thy deeds
Kindling flames
Sowing seeds
By thy deeds
Sounding the strings

Avowing your sovereignty, making your waves
Marking you out from the mass of the slaves
Claiming your land, truth to proclaim
Repay the gift with the exploits of fame
