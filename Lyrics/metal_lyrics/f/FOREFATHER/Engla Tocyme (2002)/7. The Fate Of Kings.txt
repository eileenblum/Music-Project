"I give words of thanks for these adornments which I gaze on here, that I was able to acquire such things for my people before the moment of death. Now that I have paid for the horde of treasures which the life allotted me, you must attend to the people's needs henceforth; I can remain here no longer! Bid those famous for war to build a fine mound after the pyre on the headland by the sea; it shall tower high on Whale's Cape as a remembrance to my people, so that seafarers when they drive their tall ships from afar across the mists of the flood will thereafter call it Beowulf's Barrow"
- Beowulf
