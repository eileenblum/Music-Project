The Vessel forsook the land of the Danes,
moved out to stir the deep water.
Then at the mast the sail was made fast by a rope, a fine sea-dress; the water-borne timbers creaked. The wind over the billows did not hinder the wave-floater from its journey. The sea-traveller advanced, floated foamy-necked over the waves, the clamped prow over the ocean currents, until they could descry the Geatish cliffs. Driven by the breeze, the craft pressed forwards, grounded on land.
