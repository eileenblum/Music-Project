Men of the sea, on the waves they did ride
Drifting towards their new dawn
Sailing forth with the wind as their guide
Fathers of a kingdom to be born

Their blood flows in me
Through their eyes I see
With their spirit I shall bring down my blade
I speak with their words
Their callings I have heard
For their honour I shall bring down my blade

Offa's sons, by the waters they fared
Gliding beyond Angeln's plains
Swiftly on to their fortune's ahead
Masters of a land to be claimed

[Translate to English: Kingly buildings tumbled and fell, together and singularly, and everywhere priests and clergymen were slain and killed among their altars; bishops with their folk without regard to any mercy were destroyed with iron and fire together]
