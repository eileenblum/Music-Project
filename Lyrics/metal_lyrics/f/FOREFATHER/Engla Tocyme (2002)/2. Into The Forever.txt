Intensity - a fire does burn in us
Adversity - nothing can hinder us
Fervency - strong enough is no enemy
Victory - eminence is our destiny

Mortality - We're not afraid of the other side
Bravery - from our fate we refuse to hide
Ignominy - In our hearts is no room for shame
Prosperity - What is ours we shall now regain

To the battle we'll storm and fill the souls of our foe with fear
Crush their towers and their rule until all signs of them disappear

Supremacy - Redeemind our dignity
Liberty - free of nonentity
Mastery - towards our own ends we go
Eternity - into the forever we flow
