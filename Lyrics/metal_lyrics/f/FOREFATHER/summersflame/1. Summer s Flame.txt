Fire conquers the ice
Frost melts away, the forest can breathe
Sound filling the air
The song of the bird and hammer on steel
Hear the call from afar
We tread a new path, spreading the seed
Shine, lady of light!
Empower the soil, strengthen the yield

Summer's flame riding high
Golden spears rain on the land
Eager souls now fly free
Winter's chill a distant dream

Summer's flame riding high
Golden spears rain on the land
Far and wide, seas of green
Days burn long into the eve
