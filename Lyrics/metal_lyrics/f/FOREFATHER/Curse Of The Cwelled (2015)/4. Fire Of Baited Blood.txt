Graven faces gather in the hall 
Messengers bring word from the shore 
Ill winds behind hostile sails 
Black wings approach beyond the pale 

Fire of baited blood 
A hearth of ancient stone 
We must resist, hold fast to this 
To keep the spoils of Rome 

Fell serpents slink through the reeds 
Outriders hunt them unseen 
The lord wills bring victory with speed 
Bannermen give pledge on bended knee 

Fire of baited blood 
A hearth of ancient stone 
We must resist, hold fast to this 
To keep the spoils of Rome 

Break the chains of fear 
Prepare the course for war 
Make no retreat, repeat the feat 
Of fathers gone before 

May your blade be swift and just to the end 
Take our hopes, in you we trust to defend 
Win this fight and send them back to the sea 
Let them spread the fame of our mastery 

Defend! 

Fire of baited blood 
A hearth of ancient stone 
We must resist, hold fast to this 
To keep the spoils of Rome 

Break the chains of fear 
Prepare the course for war 
Make no retreat, repeat the feat 
Of fathers gone before 

Defend!
