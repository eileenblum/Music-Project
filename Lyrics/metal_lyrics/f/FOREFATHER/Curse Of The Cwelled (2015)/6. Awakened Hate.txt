In the darkness an ancient power lies 
If you rile the beast, in time he will arise 
Thieves disturb the peace, a reckless seed to sow 
A rage will be unleashed, purging fire bestowed 

Heed their steady words, vast the columns grow 
No sign or show, awakened hate! 
See their level gaze, mark the coming age 
It won't abate, awakened hate! 

Stricken down, a fighting man was tamed 
In his tomb he lies but never truly waned 
Such a primal force can never be restrained 
Soon he will return to raise the flag again 

Heed their steady words, vast the columns grow 
No sign or show, awakened hate! 
See their level gaze, mark the coming age 
It won't abate, awakened hate! 

Deep in the dark it is found 
In restless caverns far under the ground 
Walls of the citadel groan 
Halls of the fortress come crumbling down 

Heed their steady words, vast the columns grow 
No sign or show, awakened hate! 
See their level gaze, mark the coming age 
It won't abate, awakened hate!
