Soldiers of the stonefolk through narrow paths wind 
Celebrated warriors, the grand emperor's pride 
The old woodland watches with cold forbidding eyes 
Terror is unleashed as the forest comes alive 

Painted with blood, a line in the sand 
Mangled and broken by bold Hermann's hand 
In the land of Germania they faltered and fell 
Wasted by fate, legiones redde! 

Spear-ravaged remnants break onto the plain 
A last desperate surge but all is in vain 
The last stragglers flee in humbling defeat 
All overwhelmed, the slaughter is complete 

Painted with blood, a line in the sand 
Mangled and broken by bold Hermann's hand 
In the land of Germania they faltered and fell 
Wasted by fate, legiones redde! 

Ire, cold foreign rule inflames 
Lust for rebellion gains 
Tribes band together 
Glory and freedom seized 
Overlords brought to their knees 
Fame everlasting 

Painted with blood, a line in the sand 
Mangled and broken by bold Hermann's hand 
In the land of Germania they faltered and fell 
Wasted by fate, legiones redde!
