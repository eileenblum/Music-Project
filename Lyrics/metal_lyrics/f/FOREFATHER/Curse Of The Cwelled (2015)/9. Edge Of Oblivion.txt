Edge of oblivion, heads in the sand 
Wolves in the fold raping the land 
Shadows of men by meekness consumed 
Weak willing slaves marching to doom 

Dire whirlwinds growing, the craven fall deaf 
Seek no compassion, mailed fist you will get 
Standing defiant, the bold brazen few 
Storm-battered monoliths, guardians of truth 

Edge of oblivion, bewildered they fall 
Madness and chaos darken the halls 
Powerless servants basking in woe 
Headlong to nothingness, gladly they go 

At the final hour they see the chasm opens wide 
The feckless fall into the void 

Dire whirlwinds growing, the craven fall deaf 
Seek no compassion, mailed fist you will get 
Standing defiant, the bold brazen few 
Storm-battered monoliths, guardians of truth 

Edge of oblivion, heads in the sand 
Wolves in the fold raping the land 
Shadows of men by meekness consumed 
Weak willing slaves marching to doom
