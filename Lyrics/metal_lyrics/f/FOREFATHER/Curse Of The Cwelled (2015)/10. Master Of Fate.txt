Veiled in despair kneels the ill-fated son 
Drowning in unnumbered tears 
Wretched, the steadfast one watches on high 
Pawn in the dark enemy's game 
There on the brink the great worm lies slain 
Foulest deceit he has sown 
Free from his spell, mournful she leapt 
Taken by the waters below 

Out of a dream, the far-farer heard this tale of agony 
Tragedy born in tangled threads of cruel destiny 

Those roaring waters he will not defile 
Beseeches the black, fickle blade 
Answered, the bloodstained on death's iron falls 
Ruthless, the curse meets it end 

Out of a dream, the far-farer heard this tale of agony 
Tragedy born in tangled threads of cruel destiny 

Master of fate 
Mastered by doom 

"Hail, Iron of Death! Wilt thou take the Master of Fate?" 
"Yea, I will drink thy blood. I will slay thee swiftly." 

Out of a dream, the far-farer heard this tale of agony 
Tragedy born in tangled threads of cruel destiny
