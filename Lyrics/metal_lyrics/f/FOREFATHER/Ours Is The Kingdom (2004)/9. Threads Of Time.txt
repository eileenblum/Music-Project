Wise are the weavers who carry our destiny
Golden threads are the tales of our lives
Worlds entwining, a journey eternally
All as one are the earth and the skies
Three are the goddesses, pillars of wisdom
Spinners of what is, what has and will be
There is no escaping the web
You cannot defy them, you cannot break free

Enter the world and the sisters are with you
An energy knot in the fabric of time
To rulers of gods death's the debt we must pay
For creating the pattern of our life's design
Few are the shamans who look upon everything
For this great gift sacrifice they must pay
They will know our choice at the crossroad
The strings of the universe will lead the way

Never-ending river flowing
Threads of time unfold
