Falling towers of stone, smashed by fate
The giants' craft declines, undermined by age
Once shining and strong with celebration of men
Until the mighty one swept them away

Their warriors destroyed with war, the times of affliction came
Their shining realms in ruin, deserted and decayed
Where bold, proud-hearted men looked on riches bright
Behold the power of fate at this crumbling site

The earth's grip holds as eras pass
We took what we wanted and claimed it as ours
Many a storm these shadow kingdoms have seen
Grey with lichen, stained with blood and misery

Once they looked on riches, possessions, precious stones
Everything must die, all that's left is echoes
Legends fading day by day, cracks are gaping wide
Till mighty fate will sweep away their ancient work and pride

Their warriors destroyed with war, the times of affliction came
Their shining realms in ruin, deserted and decayed
Where bold, proud-hearted men looked on riches bright
Behold the power of fate at this crumbling site

The earth's grip holds as eras pass
We took what we wanted and claimed it as ours
Many a storm these shadow kingdoms have seen
Grey with lichen, stained with blood and misery
