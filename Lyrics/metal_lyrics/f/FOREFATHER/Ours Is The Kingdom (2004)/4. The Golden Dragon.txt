Papal banner, cross bears the red of the blood we shed
Gave his blessing, leaving the heart of the nation dead
Ancient sunwheel stolen and warped for a demigod
Raised in our name, you will worship what you hate and fought

Sign of conquest buries the past in the centuries
Beast in slumber lurks in their deepest and darkest fears
Restless dragon guarding the horde of our destiny
Fuck your standard, watch in despair as we're breaking free

Show them our sign, raise it up high
Banish their symbol of conquest
Tear it to shreds, burn it to ash
Throw of the weight of enslavement
Open your souls to our mark of old
Don't let the false one deceive you
Now is the time, we shall rule again
Bring down the cross that subdued you

The Golden Dragon flying high again...

Dragon slayer, so goes the myth and the history
With sword he severed, cut us adrift from our unity
Drifting, wondering what is amiss, what it means to be
Raise the dragon, find the answer to the mystery

Show them our sign, raise it up high Banish their symbol of conquest Tear
It to shreds, burn it to ash
Throw of the weight of enslavement
Open your souls to our mark of old
Don't let the false one deceive you
Now is the time, we shall rule again
Bring down the cross that subdued you

The Golden Dragon flying high again...
