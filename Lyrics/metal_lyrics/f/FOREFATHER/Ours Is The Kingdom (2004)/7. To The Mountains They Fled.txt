From beyond we sailed the sea
Seeking new prosperity
We came for the victory
On the fields we cut them down
Stole their pride and burned their towns
These lands held our destiny

Routed and shamed to the mountains they fled
Soundly defeated they sadly abandoned their homes
A new force had arrived to remain
Covered with glory we conquered and settled our land - Englaland

From foreign soil they saw us come
They new the fight could not be won
We offered them no mercy
Ruthlessly they felt our might
In fear they ran into the night
We shattered their dignity

Routed and shamed to the mountains they fled
Soundly defeated they sadly abandoned their homes
A new force had arrived to remain
Covered with glory we conquered and settled our land - Englaland
