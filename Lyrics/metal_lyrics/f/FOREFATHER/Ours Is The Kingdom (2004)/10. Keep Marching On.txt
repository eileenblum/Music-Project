Now is the time, to the battle we go
The enemy's waiting, much blood will soon flow
But fear ye not death, no such honour so high
To fight with your brothers and die
Think not of failure and be strong of mind
Remember our women and bairns left behind
Dawn is now breaking, be ready to fight
We'll feast our triumph tonight

For our kin we must win
Never stop struggling
Never give in
Show them our might!
Show them our pride!

Our culture and creed confined to history
Such a sad tale to tell so my warriors keep marching on!

The sun is now rising, the birds are in song
Set thoughts of your families spur you along
Smiling they'll greet you, a hero's return
Fame and renown to be earned
Gather your weapons, lock pity away
We shall be drinking as night follows day
Boasting of victory, praising our dead
And glorious times that lay ahead

For our kin we must win
Never stop struggling
Never give in
Show them our might!
Show them our pride!

Our culture and creed confined to history
Such a sad tale to tell so my warriors keep marching on!
