We'll slay and we'll destroy and we'll feel no guilt
Haphazardly we'll do as we do please
We will act on instinct, our minds know not compassion
Unimpeded by corrupt restraints

This is the way it should be
And in natural chaos we are free
With laws and morals cast away

We'll violate, obliterate to fuel our will
On impulse act without any regret
Survival of the strong will be the only rule
Disorder is and will be evolution

A time when life is pure
And justice is our blades
When being is unspoiled
And gone are all restraints
