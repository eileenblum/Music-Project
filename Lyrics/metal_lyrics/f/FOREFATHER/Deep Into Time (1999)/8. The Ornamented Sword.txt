[extract from Beowulf] "the ornamented sword, forged on the anvil,the razor sharp blade stained with blood,shears through the boar-crested helmets of the enemy.we shielded our heads in the fight.,when soldiers clashed on foot, slashed at boar-crests.and his head was guarded by the gleaming helmetwhich was to explore the churning waters, stir their depths;gold decorated it, and it was hung around with chainsas the weapon-smith had wrought it long before,wondrously shaped it and beset it with boar images,so that afterwards no battle-blade could do it damage"
