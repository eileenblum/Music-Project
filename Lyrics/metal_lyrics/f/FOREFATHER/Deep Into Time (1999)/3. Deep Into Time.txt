They came from other lands to change our viewsThey said to worship their god or we would dieeras on I yearn to reveal our ways againTo unveil ancient wisdom gained through generations I dig deep into timeTo bring back ancient waysBefore they clawed them downTheir reign is failing now Our forefathers resisted all they couldTo save the traditions oldenBut they destroyed them and stole our childrenâ€™s mindsAnd now we shall restore forgotten honour and pride Pure blood, unpoisoned waterPassed from father to sonAn age now long since goneIs there time to revert?
