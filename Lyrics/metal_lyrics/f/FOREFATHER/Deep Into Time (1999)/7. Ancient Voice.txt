The winds of wisdom lash my faceAs I hail this open spaceUnder the burning midday sunI sense the power that makes us oneThis stretch of land before I seeLies symbolic of historyAn Angleman, I am of manyI am of their spirit, I am of them I hear their ancient voice The storms of knowledge pound the skiesAs I praise this sight before my eyesThrough the mist beyond the seaI see the past that calls to me We are oneHeathen sonAs I stand above your gravesWe are oneHeathen sonAs I see the world in flames
