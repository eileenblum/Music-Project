The winds sweep across the raging skies of our tormented domain
All around I heat the ghostly chants of generations gone
can't they the howls of the Old Ones great coming with the storms?
Cries of betrayal and destroyed will over ages passed

I hear the winds of immortal wisdom sing
Nature is yet to breath its last breath

They blindly go about their ways, forget what is real
A fantasy turned to legacy, a spiral of doom
Can't they hear the howls of the Old Ones great coming with the winds?
The warnings fall on stubborn minds and on deaf ears
