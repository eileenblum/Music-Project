Somewhere we lie in a circle of time
Where ages of elders have passed the land by
Somewhere we lie in a circle of time
Where those ancient mortals will not ever die
Taught in the valleys and forests of home
Devoted to ways of old
Sometime we'll lie in a circle of time
Where we are the fathers who told

I live by the distant sun of the earth
And hills that have branded my name
Visions of elders are all that I see
Alive on my elders' plains

Onward the fyrd's men, together we go
Chanting songs of victory
We will always live
Like the fathers once did dream
Guided by that which is known to us all
And means all of living to me
Somewhere we lie in a circle of time
Where reason of old is the key

The sun and the moon hold the key
To how the ways of life should be
Free of ruler, we will see
On a journey deep in ancestry
