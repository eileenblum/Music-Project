[Music &amp; Lyrics Athelstan]

Gathered together, the meoduseld shining brightly
Cempan and ealdormen, in a drunken dream
Among all the riches and relics of many hearth-kin,
Foretell unyielding their coming feats and deeds

Harp strings, stout-played, sing the praises of many ring-lord
Lay of blood-reddened fields, myriad foes cleaved
Spear's flight nor sword edge did smash his almighty war-disc
Honour did save him for future king to be

Oh, they feast in their hallowed halls
Ghostly warriors ashen and pale
Shadows dance in the light of the flame
Gold and majesty, glory and fame

Pour from the well, share a toast with our nation's heroes
Beauty unheard of will carry us the mead
Fortune this night brings a war-leader far across the sea
By his hand we may from demon scourge be freed

Oh, they feast in their hallowed halls
Ghostly warriors ashen and pale
Shadows dance in the light of the flame
Gold and majesty, glory and fame
Oh, they feast in their hallowed halls
Ghostly warriors ashen and pale
Bold they rode on the crest of a wave
Shielded tight in a womb of oak staves
