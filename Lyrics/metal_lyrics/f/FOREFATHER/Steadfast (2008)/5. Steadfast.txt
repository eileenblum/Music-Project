[Music &amp; Lyrics Athelstan]

Steadfast as a weathered mighty stone
Weary of this furious raging storm
Defy, and resist the endless war
Withstand, and uphold the sacred law

Though I may faulter on my journey
And I will suffer pain with time
I know I'll keep my head up high

Bring forth your gods
Your sacred strife
With truth I crush your wretched life

Roots so deep this oak will now be swayed
Core unwavering, edges burn and frayed
Enduring as all else wilts and wanes
Earth-red blood is coursing through my veins

Steadfast!

Noble, Glorious
Ever victorious
Entwined everlong
Steadfast forever

Loyal is this friend who rides with me
Ever true companion reigns supreme
Smashing all deluded false belief
Laughing at their feeble self-deceit

No one can take this strength away
I will resist the fearsome tide
And I will keep my head held high
