[Music &amp; Lyrics Wulfstan]

Let the shaman cast the runes
Is it today that we should strike?
We don't want to take them on
Without the gods on our side
See the ravens in the sky
What do the paths of their flight portend?
If we go forth and face them now
Will there be death waiting at the end?

It was an omen
A message of fire from the sky
A candle of doom in the night
It was decided if we were to conquer or die
Hear the witches chant their spells
What do their strange melodies foretell?
Whichever way it's destined to go
They can be sure that we'll fight them well

It was an omen
A message of fire from the sky
A candle of doom in the night
It was decided if we were to conquer or die
At dawn we faced them
We gathered beneath a red sky
The hills hearkened our battle cry
It was decided if we were to conquer or die
