[Music &amp; Lyrics Athelstan]

Was a time when men they fought for kindred's cause, a struggle to survive
But far beyond the native burghs I see they send our blood to death
Is it to kill for greed, to find eternal peace or sow the seeds for war?
This army is not for Folk and Fyrd, there is no peace beyond these shores

Fields of graves reveal courageous aims of brothers long time gone
Should we live to see another cemetery for men who died but not for their own kin to feed?

For these shores
For these shores

Fields of graves, futile slaves
To distant wars, far beyond these shores
