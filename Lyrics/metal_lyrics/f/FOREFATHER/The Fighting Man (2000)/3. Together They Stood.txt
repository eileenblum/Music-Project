[Music &amp; Lyrics Wulfstan]

Heroes now forgotten from a time long ago
Shadowy figures of battles fought
Those who slew with passion and vigour
Warriors that trod our path to glory

Under erratic skies and pounded by pouring rain
Together they did stand, our land and our folk to preserve
Battered by roaring winds and frozen by winter storms
Together they did stand, our ways and our pride to retain

Martyrs beyond recollection from the heart of the fray
The ghostly cries of passionate strife
Those who protected and killed for our cause
Faces unknown that to our destiny strode
