[Music Wulfstan/Athelstan]
[Lyrics Wulfstan]

On the fields of yesterdays, where many battle's been lost and won
Great domains of seasons passed, where many a deed was done
Shining lands of yesterdays, deep down they will always be ours
Mighty paths of epochs gone, with all their olden powers

Wooded hills of yesterdays, throughout our England's soil
Forests vast of times surpassed, stretched out for mile on mile
Potent earth of yesterdays, I know you will always be ours
Earth of our fatherland, with all its olden powers

Olden paths of yesterdays, with their olden power
Great domains of seasons passed, they will always be ours
Mighty paths of epochs gone, throughout our England's soil
Forests vast of times surpassed

Wooded hills of yesterdays, throughout our England's soil
Forests vast of times surpassed, stretched out for mile 'on mile
Potent earth of yesterdays, I know you will always be ours
Earth of our fatherland, with all its olden powers
