[Music Athelstan]
[Lyrics Athelstan/Wulfstan]

Into darkness, unwilling we fell
Augustine came to preach heaven and hell
All must worship the cross he did tell
The heathen spirit condemned to his hell

1000 years on the dawn starts to break
Spirits of the old ones shall awake
Temples of the enslavers shall fall
Liberated, we'll stand proud and tall
