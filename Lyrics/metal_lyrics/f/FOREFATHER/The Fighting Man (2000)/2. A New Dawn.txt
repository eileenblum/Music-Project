[Music &amp; Lyrics Wulfstan]

We shall be part of a mighty revolt
We'll sow the seeds of a great overthrow
Our command shall prevail endlessly
Forever triumphant and full of pride

Shields and swords shall clash but we'll succeed
Our grand Fyrdmen shall fight robustly
None who betrayed us shall parry our scorn
Covered with glory, we'll mark a new dawn

The elders' delight shall be known through the land and sky
Prosperous and yielding times they'll bring
Forever in victory we'll be
Our command shall last incessantly

Prosperous and yielding times we shall see
The land and the sky shall bring potency
Our command shall prevail endlessly
Forever in victory we shall be
