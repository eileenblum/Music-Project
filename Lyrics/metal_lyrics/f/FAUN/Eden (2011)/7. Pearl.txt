I saw her once and then no more
't was Edens Light on earth a while
She passed along the meadow floor
Spring seemed to smile
and then no more

Ah! What avail my magic lore?
She shone before mine eyes awhile
My peace is wrecked on Beauty's shore.
I saw her once and then no more

Oh might I see, her once again
Death would soon heal this heart
Now sad and sore, would beat anew
A while and then no more
