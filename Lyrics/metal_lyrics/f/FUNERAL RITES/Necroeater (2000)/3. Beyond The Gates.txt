The sky covered with weird clouds
The forest rustles and tells us ominous premonition
The earth splits and swallows all lives
Before the final war, every evil thing is ready

I left my land, as master told, I have no regret
Intense cold, tenacious assault, freeze with fright
Awaiting fate, prepared altar, loose my mind
Look up the sky, fill demons lust, feel Satan's breath

The sun goes down, the moon comes out, lights way to hell
The goal is nigh, my steps are light, I look back
Warriors are dead, are death in vain? No! inevitable fate
Their bodies were, buried in snow, I pause

[Chorus:]
I find the way to the unseen gate
Go through the ice floe of nordland
In the sign of evil worship
I must open the gate of doom
Summon the troop of darkness in hell
Return of master commands us
Release from eternal freeze
Beyond the gates of unknown infernal gods

Hear the laughter, of demons, yell of joy, ringing in hell
Offer a prayer, for our master, burn the sky, for our hell
Open your eyes, gaze at the gate, seal of demon, cursed mark
You'll awaken, sense of hell, sense of fate, and repent

Then I came near the first gate and resigned myself to hatred god
My body floated in the darkened sky, assimilated the power of hell
Similarly I passed through the seven gates and succeeded to the name of son of Satan
Eternal freeze have been released, the work is now complete
Wait the wartime tranquilly, we will taste the triumph of blood
