And perfume of white rose shroud you
Phrase of lure wavw you slowly
You suffer from delusion and reality
Spiritual world is covered by chaos

In deluge of lust, deep meditation
Shivery ensamble resound through the cathedral
Aeonian devotion and eternal oath
Do you feel it meanless bindings?

I never blame you and pursuit you by disciples
But you should not shy away from facing up to reality
The way you chose is so hard, so cold and so mysterious
Are you ready to risk your life? Don't you mind whatever happens?

May be fearful, painful and lifeless, oh my master
I will roam in the sea of chaos and gaze at myself
Don't fear!! Don't fear!! Don't fear!! oh my sweet disciple
I grant you my power, power of hell, power of Satan

Dark oceans you cry, writhing in the misery
Bleeding in the despair, roar with your soul
You fell away from me my love
Vanish in deaths cold mysterious
