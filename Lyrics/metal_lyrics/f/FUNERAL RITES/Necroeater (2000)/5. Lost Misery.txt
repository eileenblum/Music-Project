We forget in ancient times, weakness of the human race
Progress arose us pride, long peace took out of us

God never be able to punish us, he overestimates his power, too
Pagan watches for a chance to, summon the troop of hell
Helpless god don't know, what to do for them

In the gardens of Eden, angels rest on peace
Neglect watch and, be sward with lust
No one become aware, the other race revenge
Too late to repent, it all went wrong

After days torment, silence has come
New order was formed by them
Engrave in your mind and know taste of defeat
Curse your weakness and your deadly fate
