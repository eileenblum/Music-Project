Tonight is no time to repent
push your feelings to the side.
All your prayers and miracles
are useless to you know.
It alL is, about to, come to a halt.
gasp as much as you can
till it tightens your lungs.
you will regret
These choices are no longer.
Feel everything collapse
inside your chest.
Your silence shows permanence
This is your end.
Your silence shows permanence,
you wonder why he's failed you again.
So look in my eyes there is nothing there
there's nothing there.
I'm frozen cold, no conscience, no fear.
