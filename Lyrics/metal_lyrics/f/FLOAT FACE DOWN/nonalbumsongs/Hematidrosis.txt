Let this spread like a fucking disease,
and infect everyone you love
the fear you feel, the reason you're not sleeping
never forget
every day is like your last, nothing unfollowed.
you'll never feel comfort again
this is a promise to you, of unforgiving hatred.
feel the blade against your throat
i want to feel your airway collapse
i'll never rest until you're dead
don't give me reasons you should live
i'm not listening anymore.
nothing can compare to the fear, i've instilled in you
for as long as you're body is breathing, i'll be there
never forget.
everyday is like your last.
you will never feel comfort again.
this is a promise.
keep these thoughts at the front of your mind
this is never ending.
you're fucked, your life is nothing.
