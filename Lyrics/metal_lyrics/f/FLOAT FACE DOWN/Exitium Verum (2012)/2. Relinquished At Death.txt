We'll let this spread like a fucking disease.
And infect everyone you love.

The fear you feel,
The reason you're not sleeping.
Never forget.

Everyday is like your last.
There is nothing unfollowed.
You'll never feel comfort again.
This is a promise to you, 
of unforgiving hatred.

Feel the blade against your throat.
I want to feel your airway collapse.
I'll never rest until you're dead, anymore.

Nothing can compare to the fear, 
I've instilled in you.
For as long as your body is breathing,
I'll be there.

Everyday is like your last.
You will never feel comfort.

Keep these thoughts at the front of your mind.
This is never ending.
You're fucked.
Your life is nothing.
