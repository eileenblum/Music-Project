This the final scene
The alternate ending
Lips sewn shut, tongue cut out
To raise the worth of your life

A twisted turn, a torturous moment
The sky turns black, the piano descends
Faster &amp; faster &amp; the notes are out of time
A sharpened pain, rips through
Faster &amp; faster all the notes are out of time

So take a bow
They loved the murder scene tonight
We've entered total darkness
So take a bow
This wasn't in the script
The walls are closing now

Let the curtain drop right in front of you
&amp; take a fucking bow
Let the blackness seep deep inside of you
Let's make this ending believable

Tongue cut out

A twisted turn
A torturous moment
Eject the tape

Close your mouth
Your eyes are unplugged

Let the curtain drop in front of you
&amp; take a fucking bow

This is the final scene
With no outtakes

Goodnight
