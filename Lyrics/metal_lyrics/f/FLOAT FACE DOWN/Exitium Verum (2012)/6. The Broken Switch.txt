This time he won't
Come back from a blackened mind that plagues us all
All time of sanity has expired
Has expired

He's slowly digging deeper
Into the center of the Earth
To bury all of these misfortunes

He'll watch your solemn faces
With the coldest eyes
[2x]
His mind was lost never to be found again

As the boxes are lowered [2x]
To the ground
He'll never shed a fucking tear

Slipping in delirium
Lay back down

Devastation
Left to live with your spirits broken

This time he won't come back
The time has expired
Keep your eyes to the ground

You'll feel the pain [2x]
Leveled out in your vortex
Paralyzed by the crushing blow
We're all standing to destroy this aura
Everyone fears the life of their own

Devastation
At its finest

This time he won't
Come back from a a blackened mind that plagues us all
All time of sanity has expired
Has expired
