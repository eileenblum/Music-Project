There's something in our mind
It's changing our reality.
I will embrace this.
Give me your evil thoughts.
I can obliterate all that was good and pure.
Give me your evil thoughts.

Bring forth all your contempt
Let your hatred set you free.
Leave standing none of those
Who stand in your way.

We will stand alone.
We stand alone.
We are in no need of alliance.
We will stand alone
We stand alone.
The days are so fucking Cold.

True destruction
is the only class we'll know.
Begin the countdown
This is the visual of true destruction.
