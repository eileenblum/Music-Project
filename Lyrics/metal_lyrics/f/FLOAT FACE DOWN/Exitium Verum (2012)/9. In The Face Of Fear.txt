It shook the world [2x]
All questions will be answered

The sky is almost open
Another day in a life filled with deceit
Our slate is clean
Wiped with your blood

The sky is open

So bow your head
You will be condemned
So bow your head

You lived your life
In fear
The time is now
Show me your hate

This is the final chance to destroy
Everything you've become

Show the world all the hate
You've bottled up

You've lost this game
Another rediscovered
