Black is the color they'll wear

So watch the morning commence
Every morning that they wake
The life force drained
From their eyes

Your eyes rolled into the back of your head [2x]
This is an abomination

So trust no one
Everybody's out to get you
Become a monster
Cripple every sign of threat

You roll your eyes to the back of your head
Your intentions umpire
Your emotions run ramped
Watching yourself from a distance
Let's turn the place in a war zone
Watching yourself from a distance
Let's turn the place in a war zone

Look down on the fallen bodies
They are weak
[2x]

Nothing is pure
Life as we know it
Is all gone

Ignite the fire
Burn [2x]
