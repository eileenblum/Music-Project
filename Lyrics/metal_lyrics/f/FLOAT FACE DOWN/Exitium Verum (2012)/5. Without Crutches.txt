You'll never find your comfort
With faith in nothing
Come to this realization
Your faith is nothing
This world will crash &amp; crumble
So sit &amp; watch it
So often we've ignored it
You've been mislead

I'll wage this war
Swallow your blood before your pride
It never ends
This just does not concern you

Every time you fall
For all the lies
That are put in front of you
You sold yourself short

Get on to your fucking knees
Beg for your life

Beg for your life
There's no reason to look up this time
Beg for your fucking life

Fuck you
I believe in myself
No one
Is higher than me
[2x]

You'll beg when you stand for nothing
Living your life in fear
You'll beg when you stand for nothing

I'll wage this war
So you realize

Show me
Your God I'd like to see
What he's made of
Show me
Your God the light has ceased
You're all fucked
What he's made of

I'll wage this war
Swallow your blood before your pride
It never ends
This just does not concern you
