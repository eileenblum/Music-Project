Alas, witness the demons arise
Futures ago

The winds has led me here
Guided by stars through magi spheres
Windows to dimensions filled with fear
AT dawn galactic time I'm here

Invoke the princess of time
Announce my arrival
I bare the sign of the empire
Let me pass the gates of the tripleworlds

A serenade for the dead
For centuries heavens has bled
Magic held up high
Those not dead will surely die

Behold, the castle of kings
Where the new empire was born

I am the spiritshade
I cease forgotten spells
Demons, I will set the free
By all the impurity in me
