I curse you, fool of temptation
To walk the path of shattered dreams
To find answers of life &amp; death
And to seek the truth of man's existence

The night holds many secrets
The truth's lies hidden beneath the stars
Unmask the saint, dressed in sunlight
To reveal the question of heavens demise

A dark tower rising in burning skies
The visions coming into dreams
Solve the riddle of ungodly terror
I am the seed of anciet prophets

Burn his kingdom, destroy his laws
Erase his presence from this earth
Leave this world, this world of lies
Can't you see, he's the devil in disguise

You're fooled, obsessed by desire
Your life has ended
You're burned by his fire

The skies are painted
painted with nightmares
As your soul is descent into oblivion

The night holds many secrets
The truth's lies hidden beneath the stars
Unmask the saint, dressed in sunlight
To walk the path of man's existence

Enforce the punishment!

A dark tower rising in burning skies
The visions coming into dreams
Solve the riddle of ungodly terror
I am the seed of anciet prophets
