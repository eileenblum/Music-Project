Many a man has fallen before me
In the quest of the magic rings
In the search of the spirit in me
In the search of the demons we see

I pledge allegiance to thee

Dance the dance of the spiritflame
And they will appear
The kings &amp; wizards of the blizzard sky
Emerges from the shadows of your soul
I have witnessed madness
Plagues &amp; death has passed by
I know the secrets of the gods
I hnow ancient rituals they tried to hide

Spirits, dance around these magic runes
I riddle you this &amp; gates may open
In my world no names are secret but mine
And chant me the kings
In the shadow worlds
