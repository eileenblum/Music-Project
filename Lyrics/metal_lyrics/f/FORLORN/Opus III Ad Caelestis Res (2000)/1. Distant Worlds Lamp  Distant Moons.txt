Releasing my spirit in search for the infinite
Paths of frozen stars shall guide me
All spiritual secrets will be discovered
Never before seen, never before touched

Entwined is my soul &amp; binded am I
I enter this mirros of souls blindly
Ancient havens, grasp my hands
And wrap me in shadows

Spiritless, I float through time &amp; space
Endless journey, unite me with future worlds
Slipping into a deceiving dimensional trance
Life slowly fades, as I enter a greater void

Distant worlds &amp; distant moons
The second universe has emerged
Take me, embrace me, &amp; make me yours

Serpent stars, millenniums enigma
Infinite horizons, reflecting divine moonlight
Seductive night, drifting in a pale disguise
The trinity is complete

Distant worlds &amp; distant moons
The second universe has emerged
Take me , embrace me, &amp; make me yours
