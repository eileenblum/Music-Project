The power of the ancient
Chants hymns of celebration
You can hear their echo
Descending into the night

Celebrate the ancient ways
In the circle of infinity
Praise the power of the gods
Let them lead you to the future
Listen to the voices in the night
They speak of times vicious &amp; cold
Of death's &amp; tales untold
Of moonlight embracing the bold

Phantoms, hear my call
Beuond the stars

Lead me through hidden galaxies
And grant me the power of thee

Celebrate the ancient ways
In the circle of infinity
Praise the power of the gods
Let them lead you to the future

Behind shadows they watch carefully
Listen to the whispers in the dark
They will tell you of the phantoms magic
And of the worlds which they dominae

Now listen to the voices in the night
They speak of times vicious &amp; cold
Of death's &amp; tales untold
Of moonlight embracing the bold
