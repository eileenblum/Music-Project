Faceless horror
In the mirrors of the heavens
Dark secrets
turking behind their desires
The shadows of your soul
Screams painfully
Release me, release me

Enslaved is my heart &amp; I
Enslaved is the beast inside
Captured is the soul of mine
Necto Spiritus

Painting signs of death
Captued, caressed by thousands
A path to the richous
The heavens are calling me

Enslaved is my heart &amp; I
Enslaved is the beast inside
Captured is the soul of mine
Necto Spiritus

Beasts foul &amp; ugly rise before me
Illusions, through them I see
Illusions where-ever I go
Fools, you can't deceive the free
The wintermoon shines on warriors wrapped in ice
Illuminate the invisible faces ou your way
Embrace the heavens when they fall

Enslaved is my heart &amp; I
Enslaved is the beast inside
Captured is the soul of mine
Necto Spiritus
