The dark essence of your heart
Seals the gate to the lightchamber
And forces the sun to no longer rise
The time is here, the end is near

Through eternal darkness &amp; endless nights
The earth will freeze all life shall cease
You have drained the moon &amp; drained the stars
You are the shadowmaster lord of chaos &amp; disaster

Stormchoirs celebrate total darkness
Performing the midnight's overture
Their themes of death &amp; sorrow tells
There will be no tomorrow

The skies are painted with nightmares
Illusions &amp; horrors confirming the end
The earth is prisoned and captured in time
You are the shadowmaster lord of chaos
