Tied to machines
That will forever tear you down
In the dark you're stumbling blindly
Bound to believe in a lie
Moulded into perfection
While feeding your lust for depravity
Nails of fate pierce your flesh

You are just another replica
A mere duplication of failure

Make no mistake by praying for an end
No foolish thoughts
On how you may commend
Assume no acts of kindness
To be practised anymore
No kindness anymore

Stigmata damnation
Pity the martyr
Stigmata damnation
Carry their guilt

Let me be your stigmata

An icon of man's horrid creation
Fear mingled
With insubordinate stupidity

You will be punished for crimes
That you have never done
You are the icon
Of mankind's lust for morbidity

Recognize the falsehood and the lie
What is the trae nature of this calling
Bleeding hands, bleeding eyes
Open wounds, the sacred demand

A bloodsoaked nightmare
Of horrid creation
You are the image of sinners that wept
