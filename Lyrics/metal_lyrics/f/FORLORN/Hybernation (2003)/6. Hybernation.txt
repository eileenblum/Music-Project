Prepared and bottled
Pre-installed horizons
Qued, piled and stocked
Packed, labeled and stored

Arms and legs, attach detach
Access profile, search for gene match
Injected manners and flaws
Hope is fiction; reality is war

Institute of glass
Compressed format
This world of shattered mass
Made by the "Don't do that"

Here you have no name
Here you live through digital fame
Life through needles
Lifeless, leedles

Hybernation
Where they monitor what you do
Where men of creation
Draws down the truth for you

The "I made this" compromise
The selected few, the sacred ones
Providers of life, removers of choice
We won't bow down
We'll go down in a unison voice

Our voice will bind ten
Who in turn will bind ten
Over and over again
Hiding is signals
Exchanging ideas
Organizing our counterstrike

New ideas proclaimed dead before born
Innovation corrupt, you life in a box
Controllers of down's and up's
Renovation hended,
A revolution greeted

In this hybernation
Where slavery is a deal
Where men of perfection
Cuts of your disbeliefs

Hybernation
Salvation
Damnation
