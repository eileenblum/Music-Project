I find me, in Grow city
I find life in quantity
Quality has perished
I search through social caves
Through reckless minds
Strap me down;
I might fail just to displace you

I am a drug of my own,
No need for leedles
No need for candles
I get high on instict
The survival structures of my soul
Survival structures of hate

A scrubbed knee, my only witness
I carwl infinitely,
Through snoring democracy

Uprising in numbers
Countless, meaningful
The lack of soul
The coming of metal
Clinical streets
Organ dumpterst on every corner
Now let's dump each other
In Grow city
