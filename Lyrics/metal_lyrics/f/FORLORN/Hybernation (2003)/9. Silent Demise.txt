I hold the world at a distance
But yet... death still surrounds me
Made a servant of my own departure
Viral infestation, terror on the body

Till death do us depart

A war inside me, and I keep losing terrain
I am a battlefield, the final frontier of death
Growing weaker - fading day by day

Born into eternal life
Empty is my demise
A shadow of me am I
I crave not this despair

Into my nightmare I crawl
This deadly companion of mine
Like cold winds from the north
My body turns frozen and void

To those I'll leave behind;
Remember now that I am free
And that I do not endure this pain no more

... I am free

In aeturnus... dolor et timor
(For eternity... misery and fear)
I become one with eternity
I aeturnus... equiden silens mors
(For eternity... my truly silent demise)
To slowly fade away

No peaceful ending, no worthy way out
The shadows of death are closing in on me
No graceful journey, no perfect harmony
In desolation I see the end

Viral infestation, terror on the body
Till death do us depart

Viral... Terror... Death... Depart...
