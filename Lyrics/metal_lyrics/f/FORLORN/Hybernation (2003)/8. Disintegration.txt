Life
Another sense of reality
Could be an illusion
Possibly a nightmare

Galactic on forward in motion
Cursed systematic evolution
Genetic codes
Programmed to failure
Dismay is the new content

Mechanic organs - organic chaos
Creation of bitter times

Flesh or mechanics
Soul or software
Not in control
Can't be rebuilt to think
Force field emotions
Internal confusion
To be something but no one
The curtain falls hard on illusion

Disintegrate to create

I see the new stave
I see the same dismay
Same shit, new day
