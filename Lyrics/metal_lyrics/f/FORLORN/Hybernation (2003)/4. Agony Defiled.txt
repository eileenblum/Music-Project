They make you crawl
They make you bleed
They make you cry
Get you down on your knees
They make you beg
They make you plead
That your lives be spared
But they dare not take heed

Ain't that sweet
The taste of defeat
The poison you take
The truth that you're fake

You try to hide
Your hurt inside
But you lost the game
Your face, your name

They call out their names
They are writhing in pain
Wrongfully accused
Watching brothers get sat
Being torn apart
They feel their wrath
For ages and ages
In life's aftermath
