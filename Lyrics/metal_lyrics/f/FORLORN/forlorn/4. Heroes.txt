Where are the heroes that courage revealed,
The battle - bright warriors who strode to the field
Of the war, their swords a light in the fray?
The heroes are gone, they have all passed away

Where are the earls who led in the van?
The chieftains and kings who held sway in the land
Of our fathers, revered in the story and song?
They have all passed away, now our heroes are gone.

Where are the unsung who silently strove,
The women and children and all the unknown
Who were models upon which to pattern our deeds?
Those heroes are gone, from this life they are freed.

And now in this time of dark of the sun,
Remember what is ended is only begun,
As sun sets each evening, she rises at morn,
To the halls of the gods are the heroes reborn.

And we, who with valor must conquer each day,
We to are heroes as gallant as they,
With the truth as our banner and courage our lights
We will come to those halls when we tread the long night.

So lift up a toast with the ale filled horn,
To those who have faced well their wyrd and are gone,
Live well your life and traditions all keep,
Drink to the gods and to hero this midwinter's eve
