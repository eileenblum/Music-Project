I've tried to see the beauty in your crimes, but did you ever think of us?

No, I refuse to leave the world the way you left it for us.
You have forsaken your children.

Generation after generation, left with the waste of the past.
We face the consequence, we face the facts.
We live in the shadow of a broken age.
We live with the problems while you left without a trace.

Is this all I'll ever be?
The shadow of a broken dream.

We are forsaken.

We are forsaken, destined to live with this.
We are forsaken, doomed from birth.
