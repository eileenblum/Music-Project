Born without a chance of success.
They've led you into a path of numbness.
Torn away from the power to direct what you think and what you feel, with our backs to the wall we've sent you into a cloud of mind sickness.

Destroying the earth in the name of your god.
We suffer for your mistakes.
Stuck in a crime filled hive, justified by a lie lost in time.

What type of person does it take to discard their own humanity?
You're spineless. Abiding by the outdated rules forced on us.

I can't give up, and I won't sit back as a full civilisation reduces their own people to ash and dust.

I wonât stand by, condemning the children to die.

Too long I've watched you tear their hopes away.
You are but a plague, inflicting pain and suffering.
I long for a day when we are moral and just, but some presence of mind will tell you - that day will never come.

Ah, but our time is almost up.
If we were to rectify our mistakes, the chance has passed and long since gone.
