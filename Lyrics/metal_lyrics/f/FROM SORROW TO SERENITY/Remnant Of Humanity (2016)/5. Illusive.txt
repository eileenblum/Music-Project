[feat. Scott Kennedy]Building, twisting, the illusion that we're in control.
They pull the ground from our feet, and watch as we fall into the depths.

Time has taken its toll on me.
I've searched for the answers but they're so far from my reach.
You tell me all is well when you know we live in a broken system.
They show the dark in this world, but we will never see the light.

I have witnessed enough; the blood is on your hands.

We've caused a reaction, now watch the deception unfold.
The blood is on their hands, the blood is on your hands.
