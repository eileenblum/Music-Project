[feat. Aaron Matts]Push aside the unnecessary; there's only so much you can hold.
Think of the difference we can make if we fight for something more.

We are the last chance, the single hope for advance.
We hold the key and we can build a better land.
The only restriction is our misplaced fear, what does the future hold? That's for us to decide.

Break from the mould.
This is not the way that it should be, living in such hypocrisy.
See the world for what it really is and become the minds rebuilding it.

Searching through the ruins, we carve our own potential.

What does the future hold? It's in the palm of your hands.
Break from the mould.

We may not change their minds, but our words will stand the test of time.

How could you know what i am?
How can you speak for us all?
You cut the ties and left us in despondency.
Holding us down, pulling us back, suffering more and more - you turned away and left us with disparity.

They say don't think, don't feel - but I'll never kneel.
