If only you could see how i see, feel what i feel.
Prosthetic eyes, unhinged minds.
Living in a clockwork existence, portraying balance where there's none.
How can we breathe in this cold reality?

I see the world crumble beneath the hands of tyranny.
I feel the grief of the families torn apart by our own greed.
We will rise up from the ashes, and put an end to this.
They say the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

I have to believe we were meant for more.

We will rise up from the ashes and put an end to this.

How can we breathe when we're surrounded by chaos?
The more we lie to ourselves, the more we sacrifice to the will of the world.
Have we not lost enough?
