[feat. CJ McMahon]Can you hear it knocking at your door?
Do you feel the presence you can't ignore?
Are you afraid to walk away?
Welcome to the lie, the land of 'prosperity'.

Blinded by our own ignorance, we've followed this path for far too long.
The dormant feeling of indignation has been our true motive all along.

I stand before the scourge of life, encapsulated in the darkest mind.

Fear the end, for it is within our grasp.
Will you stand by and watch as everything we know slips through our fingers?
There is nothing left but to watch the world burn.
Watch it burn.

Can you hear it knocking at your door?
Do you feel the presence you can't ignore?
Are you afraid to walk away?
Welcome to the lie, the land of 'prosperity'.
How many people will suffer?
How many people will take?
Will there ever be a moment where I say - we are not wasting away.

We are vessels in time, carrying the weight of all mankind.
It's not too late to change, we've lost our way, but we can find the way back.
