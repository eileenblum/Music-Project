You've lost all control.
How will you answer for all of the things that you've done?
I can feel your breath at the back of my neck.
Darkness grips to your mind, and crawls through your skin.

I see through the smoke, walk through the burning embers of hate and anguish.
I feel the fire growing inside me.
You'll never learn.

All you do is take.

And now you've had your fill,
taken what you wanted from us,
Consumed the last of our hope (have you no remorse?),
I know you're hellbound.

You'll never learn.

But I see through the smoke, walk through the burning embers of hate and anguish.
I feel the fire growing inside me.
You'll never learn.

I scratch away at my eyes to stop the blistering.
Your poison in my skin, Iâll bleed you out.

I claw and I tear 'til you seep out of me. the lies and the stories mean nothing to me. Draining the world to replenish yourself, you're a leech, you're a waste. Get out of my mind.
