Consumed by fear and ignorance.
Your wretched mind clutches onto faith.
Your devotion will bring nothing but agony.
Forget the stories you were told and free your mind to the world.

This institution breeds pure hate.
Contradiction unfolds with every word.
Tormented souls, bound by loyalty.
Cut the noose around your neck and see the world as it is.

They kept you in the dark, removed from freedom, in the palm of their hands.

The time has come for you to see through the cracks, break through the restraints they forced upon you.
Sever the ties you've held for so long, open your eyes; open your mind.
