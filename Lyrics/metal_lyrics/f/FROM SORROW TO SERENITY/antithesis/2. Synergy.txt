I see a broken world wither and bleed before my eyes.
Polluted, diseased, engulfed in acrimony.

Are we all mindless drones, conforming; not thinking for ourselves?
We've lost our way.

If only we could find a way to escape from all the lies and torment.
Together we could search for the answers, while we still can.
We have to discover our potential.

No more running from the truth.
