I refuse to walk the same path as you - hindering, neglecting.
You spit in the face of humanity.

You are irrational, spiteful, full of resentment.
Descending further into nothingness; you are a plague on this world.
You speak nothing more than empty words.

My mind is clear of all sickness.
My mind is clear of this illusion.
My mind is clear of all the things you fear.

Your reign has come to its end. Your reign is dead.
Dead reign. Dead world.
