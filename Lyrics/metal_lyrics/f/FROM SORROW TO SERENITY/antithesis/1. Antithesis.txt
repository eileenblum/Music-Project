Born into hate.
Constrained to a life of oppression, your life pre-determined by a fallacy.
You release the light; conceal the dark.
But no pretense will save you from yourself.
You release the light; conceal the dark.

For every day you've spent, lying through your teeth, and every life you've left, destined to fail:

I will rid the world of your tainted grip.
I will break the chains we've put ourselves in.
I will show the world there's dark in your light.
There is dark in your light.
