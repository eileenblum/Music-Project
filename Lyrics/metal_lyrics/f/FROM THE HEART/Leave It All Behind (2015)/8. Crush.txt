Have you ever been caught in a moment
When the sky turns to grey?
Iâm trying the fucking hardest
But it all seems to slip away
Canât get a hold of changes,
and itâs suffocating me
Lifeâs got me by the throat
WELCOME TO REALITY!

Find myself drowning,
Cause it looks I can only breathe,
To crush myself to pieces,
Shattered Iâll rise to fall again!
In need of some fucking guidance,
This is my final stand!
Walk the path of the righteous,
Even if it kills me in the end

Cherish everything,
Daylight dreams forever told.
See me bleeding, see me falling,
Everything so dark and cold
Canât get a hold of changes,
and itâs suffocating me
Lifeâs got me by the throat
WELCOME TO REALITY!

Find myself drowning,
Cause it looks I can only breathe, 
to crush myself to pieces,
Shattered Iâll rise to fall again!
In need of some fucking guidance,
This is my final stand!
Walk the path of the righteous,
Even if it kills me in the end

(Find myself drowning)
Cause it looks like I only breathe!
(Crush myself into)
Falling just to RISE AGAIN!
(Find myself drowning)
Cause it looks like I only breathe!
(Crush myself into)
Shattered to rise again! AGAIN!
