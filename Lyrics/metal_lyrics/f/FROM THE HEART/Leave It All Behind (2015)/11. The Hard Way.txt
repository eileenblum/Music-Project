Lifeâs hard and filled with pain,
You have to GET UP! Before it drives you insane,
You have to do whatever it takes,
LEARN! FROM! YOUR! Mistakes!

Lifeâs hard and filled with hate,
Stay positive, itâs never too late,
Take a stand, prepare for war,
Never forget who you are

[Ref.]
THE HARD WAY! [2x]

Lifeâs hard and filled with greed,
Just take a look at all the people you meet.
Raise your fist in the air,
WE! DONâT! FUCKING! CARE!

Lifeâs hard, just let it be,
As long as there is you and me,
We won't sink, we wonât drown,
We wonât go down!

STAND UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE AND FIGHT FOR IT
TAKE BACK WHATâS OURS IN THIS WORLD OF SHIT
BEEN AT THE BOTTOM NOW I REACH FOR THE TOP
FIGHT FOR WHAT I BELIEVE, I WILL NEVER STOP

THE HARD WAY!
MAKES ME WHO I AM TODAY!
THE HARD WAY!

[Ref.]
THE HARD WAY! [2x]
