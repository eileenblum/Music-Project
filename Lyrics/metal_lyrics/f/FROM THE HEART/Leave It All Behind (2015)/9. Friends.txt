I see it all around, I see it every time,
So-called friends, who cross the line!
Betray and backstab their best friends,
I wonder, will this ever end?
For all those wankers who forget!
Friends! You treat them with respect!
For better or for worse,
Never turn your back!

[Ref]
Friendship, respect and loyalty,
It still means the world to me.
Me and my friends, try to do it right,
Always stick together, as one we will fight.

You will lose our friendship and our respect!
For me and a lot of people are already dead!
So fuck off and the life you want to live.
We we will never forget and never forgive!
Just leave and go your own way,
You are shit to me, there's nothing more to say.
You will never understand!

[Ref]
Friendship, respect and loyalty,
It still means the world to me.
Me and my friends, try to do it right,
Always stick together, as one we will fight.

We stay true to ourselves,
To friends and family.
Without them,
What a hell that would be!

Friends, family, forever!!!!!
