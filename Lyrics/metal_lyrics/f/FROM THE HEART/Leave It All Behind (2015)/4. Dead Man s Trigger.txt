Always remember,
Whoâs the real enemy
False prophets
Of our society
Recruting demons
To fight on their side
Itâs time for resistance
Itâs time to unite

[Chorus:]
Speak the truth
Set your mind at ease
Dead manâs trigger
Will bring you to your knees
Think for yourself
Cause we all die alone
The ground that we walk on
Is also our home

I wonât let you bring us down
Get out of my face
Fuck all you assholes
And your selfish ways
Ready for battle
Freedom of speech
Ie will never ever
Be a dog on your leash

[Chorus:]
Speak the truth
Set your mind at ease
Dead manâs trigger
Will bring you to your knees
Think for yourself
Cause we all die alone
The ground that we walk on
Is also our home

Resistance!
I am the resistance!
We are the resistance!
This is the resistance!
