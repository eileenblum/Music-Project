What the fuck was on your mind?
Why is happiness so hard to find?
Why did you walk away,
And leave it all behind?
I tried to make you happy,
The only thing that I could do!
Why couldn't you love me,
The way that I loved you?

Had everything you want,
but chose to lose it all that day,
âI have to go my own wayâ
was all you had to say.
I hope one day,
That you will see.
You can never be,
better off without me!

[Ref]
I gave you my best,
FOR SO DAMN LONG!
What did you expect?
Never treated you wrong.
I gave you my best!
why couldnât you do the same?
What did you expect?
I'm not the one to blame!

All thatâs left is a broken heart,
And all the questions that I have.
I will never know the reason,
Some of the answers I'll never get.
I made a new start,
Feeling fucking great.
Enjoy all things in life,
Before it is too late.

I know I'll find my real love,
And I know I will see,
Happiness, trust and faith,
It will be the best for me.
Everything happens for a reason,
NOW HERE I AM!
You had your chance!
You will never be mine again!
