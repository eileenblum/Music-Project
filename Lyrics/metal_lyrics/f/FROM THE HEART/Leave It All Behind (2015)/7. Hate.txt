I walk the streets,
with a backpack full of hate.
I have to clean this mess,
before it is too late.
Took the wrong turn,
My mind is fucked up.
Itâs getting worse,
This aggression just won't stop.
Stay the fuck out of my way,
Iâve chosen my own path,
Why it had to be this way.

[Ref:]
Hate! [3x]
I can't run and I can't hide
Hate [3x]
For all this pain I feel inside

The pain, the hate,
Itâs killing me inside
But I can't walk away,
I have to fight.
Thanks for your help,
Never stand alone.
Have to go through this,
ON MY OWN!
I know I'm strong,
I've got my balls and my pride.
But itâs gonna be a hard way,
To make it all right!

[Ref:]
Hate! [3x]
I can't run and I canât hide
Hate! [3x]
For all this pain I feel inside

This is just not me
Not the person I am supposed to be
