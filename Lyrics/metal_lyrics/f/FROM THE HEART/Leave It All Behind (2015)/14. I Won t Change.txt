Who are you to judge me,
and tell me how to live my life?
I wonât change,
You donât even have to try!

I respect your believes,
I respect who you are.
Just leave me be,
Or Iâll have to start a war!
I am proud of who I am, 
and how far I've come,
You donât have to tell me,
Whatâs right or whatâs wrong.

I won't change the way I Live,
I'm proud of who I am
You can tell me what to do,
But I don't give a damn!

In love with the music,
Going out with my friends.
On the road again,
To see some hardcore bands.
Tats on my chest,
Thatâs a part of me,
A tribute,
To friends and family!

I won't change the way I Live,
I'm proud of who I am
You can tell me what to do,
But I don't give a damn!

Donât you fucking judge me,
For the life, that I live!
Worry about yourself,
Life has so much more to give!
I WONâT CHANGE! 
I WONâT GIVE IN!
I WONâT CHANGE! 
THE WAY IâM LIVING!
