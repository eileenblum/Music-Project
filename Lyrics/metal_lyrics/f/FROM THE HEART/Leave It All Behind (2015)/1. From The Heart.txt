We are back on stage,
From the heart, right in your face!
We are back in the game,
The passion, it still feels te same!
We know what we stand for,
So much stronger than before!
Scene stars, new jacks, we don't care,
In this "scene" thereâs bullshit everywhere!
From the heart,
From the heart, we will have our say!
From the heart,
From the heart, we're here to stay!
Always friends on my side,
This is what feels right!
Hardcore, from the heart,
They can never tear us apart!
