The life I left behind,
The darkest days and my fucked up mind.
All the shit I went through,
And now I give my heart to you.

The flame still burns inside,
Open my heart with no place to hide.
The scars remind me of the past,
But once again I gonna give my best.

Fight for our love, stay gold!
Give me your trust, stay gold!
Show your respect, stay gold!
Give me your best, together, stay gold!

Walk a thousand miles with me,
Side by side, how itâs supposed to be.
We can make it if we stick together,
Through dark days and stormy weather.

True love is what I found,
I can be myself with you around.
Take my hand! YOU &amp; ME!
We are gonna write some history.

Fight for our love, stay gold!
Give me your trust, stay gold!
Show your respect, stay gold!
Give me your best, stay gold
