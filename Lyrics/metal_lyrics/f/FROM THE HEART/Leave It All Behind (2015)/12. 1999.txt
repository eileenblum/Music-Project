I take you back
To â99
Everyday together
We had a good time.
Drinking and Rollinâ
Thatâs how itâs been done.
On our skateboards,
Had so much fun.
Friendships were made, 
We took a stand.
Crew of â99 
Still the best of friends.
Laughing and crying,
But we had a great time,
All the kids,
Stood in one line.

Crew of â99
We'll never forget that time

Be there for eachother,
Our friendshipâs still strong,
We built our foundation 
Weâre still moving on.
