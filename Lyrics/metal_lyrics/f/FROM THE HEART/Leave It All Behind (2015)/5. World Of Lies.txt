Everyday, when you open your eyes,
You wake up in a world full of lies.
No more love, only goodbyes,
We live in a world where no one even tries.

We wonât back down and wonât adapt,
Living a lie, we wonât accept.
Fuck what you stand for,
We donât need your respect!

NOW IS THE TIME TO FIGHT!
TO MAKE A CHANGE AND GET IT RIGHT!
TODAY BELONGS TO US!
TODAY BELONGS TO US!

Our heartâs on fire, we are out to win.
You can try to break us, but we wonât give in!
You did your best, I must admit,
But youâre a coward, a liar, a fucking piece of shit!

We wonât back down and wonât adapt,
Living a lie, we wonât accept!
Fuck what you stand for,
We donât need your respect!

NOW IS THE TIME TO FIGHT!
TO MAKE A CHANGE AND GET IT RIGHT!
TODAY BELONGS TO US!
TODAY BELONGS TO US!

This is what still keeps me going, 
What matters most to me.
TRUE LOVE, MUSIC,
FRIENDS &amp; FAMILY!
