Growing up seems like a start,
But in the end youâll work too hard.
People come and people go,
Will this life be all I know?

Friends will become traitors,
Backstabbers and haters.
Enemies become your friends,
Youâll never know where it ends

[Ref:]
Who told you life is easy?
Do you only feel the pain?
Who told you life is easy?
Life's hard and not a game.

Can you feel it personally!
A nightmare or reality!
Pick yourself up and live your dreams,
Itâs not as difficult as it seems.

Enjoy your life before it's too late,
There's more in life then only hate.
Look positive thatâs what itâs about!
There are always friends to help you out!

[Ref]

So who told you life is easy???
