There's so much more
I wanna say
to family and friends
who past away.
I still remember
The great times we had,
But it's over now,
and it makes me sad.

I can only hope,
Youâ ll find your place to rest.
Always in my heart,
Your memory will last!
Be my guardian angel,
and guide me on my way,
I live life to the fullest,
before it all fades away.

[Ref:]
Rest in peace! I'll never forget
Rest in peace! The great times we had
Rest in peace! I hope you're fine
Rest in peace! Waiting for my time

When all I can see is darkness
I look into the sky,
I see the light of stars,
My heroes will never die.
Heaven must wait,
I have so much more to do,
Iâve chosen my own path,
Something I learned from you.

[Ref]

But I know one day,
I'll meet my destiny.
Seeing them once again,
Friends and family!
This is for my beloved ones,
you spirits will live on.
Wait for us to meet again,
Cause I donât wanna die young!
