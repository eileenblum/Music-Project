Forging a difference
We summon existance
This distance is not what it seems
Painstaking process
It pulls at our instincts
We're living outside of our means
So long, I've hoped
To be strong
Down-sloped

[pre-chorus]
And the damage will commence
The beginning of the end
And the damage will commence

[chorus]
All these occurances bring me to life
All that I've sacrificed makes it seem right
Don't underestimate how hard I'll try
This is our final cry

Placing a marker on what I must offer
It's slowly becoming unfair
Will I recover from being pulled under
I'm desperate and gasping for air
So long, I've hoped
To be strong
Down-sloped

This is not anything that came from me
You have embedded it within my seed
All of my memories are blending in
Now the real damage will begin

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

This is our final cry [repeat]
It's the beginning of the end

[chorus]

This is our final cry [repeat]
