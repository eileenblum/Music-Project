Doesn't it make you nervous, at least you could have tried
And if it doesn't disturb us, couldn't we just sit by
And make a pact to ignore it, all of our secret needs
Becoming connected further, giving a life to feed on

[chorus]
You let them decide, the course of my life
And you just stood by, you threw me aside

Isn't it overwhelming, living a lie inside
Causing so many problems, hoping to just get by
When will it all be over, what would I have you say
But you won't have to trouble yourself for me that way

[chorus]

Didn't mean to complicate tomorrow
Didn't mean to make you feel that way
Didn't come to irritate your morals
But then you push me far away
Why did you push me far away
I just can't see why you neglected to try
To move on with our lives, when we shared the goodbye

You let them decide, the course of my life
We shared the goodbye, and you threw me aside
You'll never make that choice again, no not again
Will you affect my life again [repeat]
