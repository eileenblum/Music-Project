Lost in these times
Its hard to make up our minds
This is the reason
We're convicted for our crimes

So we wait
Scars on our face
They show the importance
Of finding a way to leave this place

But then we're left with
Nothing substantial to hold
And I'm afraid that
Our stories will never be told

Some people carry on
Some just stay right where they are
Our worlds divide the sight
I'd rather move along
Knowledge is not very far
Our worlds divide the sight

When innocence dies
It tends to shake up your life
Let it consume you
And then leave it all behind

I need escape
From the choices we made
And the feelings of longing
That are standing in our way

Don't give up on hope...
DON'T GIVE UP ON HOPE...

Don't give because its hope that binds us
Pain that guides us
Who do we trust when those things remind us
Its hope that guides us
Pain that binds us
Who do we trust when they're not behind us?
