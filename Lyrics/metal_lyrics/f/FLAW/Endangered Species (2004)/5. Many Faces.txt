Will it take some time, to release the inner apathy
Enabled inside, and it looks like you're the enemy

Things are never what they seem, can't explain the reasons why
The illusions that we see, the many faces of our lives
When you find it hard to breathe, never keep it all inside
Which one should I be, the many faces of our lives

Irrelevant minds, you become a little more serious
Still passing me by, you should not be, rightly, dear to us
[Chorus x1]

If you feel that the timing is all wrong
Here's the key to remove yourself from harm
Maybe then you will live again, live again

[Chorus x1]

I'm afraid we're in too deep, things are never what they seem
[repeat]
I'm afraid we're just too deep to come out okay
I'm afraid we're just too deep to come out okay
Now
