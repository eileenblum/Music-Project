We've been through this before......

Compromise
With me agree right now
Useless cries
I'm telling you just how
Paralyzed
There is nothing I can do
I realize
I liked the other you.

You've changed
Everything about you is strange
Look at yourself, you've changed
With the facts in your face
It's causing conflict

You've changed
Everything about you is strange
Look at yourself, you've changed
With the facts in your face
It's causing conflict

Hypnotized
By all your complex games
Sacrifice
My own opinions change
Justify
Just why to stay with you
I can't see why
Nothing else for me to do
It makes no sense
Putting ourselves through all this
At my expense
Don't I deserve much less
It's way past time
To right the wrong we're in
The bottom line
No way that we can win

You've changed
Everything about you is strange
Look at yourself, you've changed
With the facts in your face
It's causing conflict

You've changed
Everything about you is strange
Look at yourself, you've changed
With the facts in your face
It's causing conflict

You brought it all, all on yourself, you're strange to me
[background vocal]
You brought on all this mess
My needs were not addressed
You caused so much distress
This much you must admit

You brought it all, all on yourself, you're strange to me
[background vocal]
You brought on all this mess
My needs were not addressed
You caused so much distress
This much you must admit

You've changed
Everything about you is strange
Look at yourself, you've changed
With the facts in your face
It's causing conflict

You've changed
Everything about you is strange
Look at yourself, you've changed
With the facts in your face
It's causing conflict

I'm not the one who changed

I'm not the one who changed
