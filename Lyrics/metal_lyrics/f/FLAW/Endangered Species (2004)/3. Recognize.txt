Well I've had enough
Of these selfish crimes
I hurt myself again
Not knowing why
It seems so easy
To leave it all behind
And avoid the truth I think I'd rather just go blind

Then everything erupts
My life has come unglued
And the ties that bind have left me
What am I to do?

Cant seem to recognize
That stare behing those eyes
Who is this man I see?
Whos looking back at me?
Cant focus through the grey
And I am fading into nothing
The reflection must get clearer

I think I'm cracking up
Like ive lost my mind
I hurt myself again
Still dont know why
I end up the same way
Each and every time
I cant avoid the truth
Theres just nowhere to run and hide

Cant seem to recognize
That stare behing those eyes
Who is this man I see?
Whos looking back at me?
Cant focus through the grey
And I am fading into nothing
The reflection must get clearer than it appears to be right now

There must be somone I can see....
THERES GOTTA BE SOMETHING FOR ME
SHOW IT NOW, LET IT GO FREE
I KNOW ITS THERE WAITING ON ME
LET IT OUT, LET IT GO FREE

Cant seem to recognize
That stare behing those eyes
Who is this man I see?
Whos looking back at me?
Cant focus through the grey
And I am fading into nothing
The reflection must get clearer
