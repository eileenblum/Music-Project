I try to simplify, these thoughts that plague our minds
What is this mood we're in, we live like saints with sin
How much to dignify, the facts that come to light
We've lost the will to fight

At the top of the food chain we arrive (we arrive)
Are we destined to grow old
Are we really the right strain to survive (to survive)
We've got to redeem our souls, souls

Unable to comply, so eager to defy
The risk when you apply, it hurts when loved ones die
Where is the moment when, existence will depend
The test of now and then

[Chorus x1]

(Constant ending, no real mending)
If we keep on living like we are
There isnt a chance that we'll get very far
So much waster, so much lost
It's out job to alter the terrible cost

[Chorus x1]

We are the endangered species
We're running out of time... [repeat]
