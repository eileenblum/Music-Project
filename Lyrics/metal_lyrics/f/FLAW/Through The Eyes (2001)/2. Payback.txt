There's another reflection involved up in my mind
A wholeness that has just been lost
Striving hard for perfection but still nothing to find
Some value with a cheaper cost
And as I reach out to hear you the sound is so muffled
It makes a lesser man of me
So the only thing left to bring up to date is

[chorus]
You suck!
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with
me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me
[repeat]

I'm at the point of retraction and still slipping further
This place is getting worse for me
There's such a lack of direction and models to live by
No bright skies ahead of me
And as I reach out for your hand you turn and
then wander
Why I simply just can't see
No separation of gender no difference in me
You're just leading me on and on and on
You lead me on and on and on and on

[chorus]

Pretty soon it's gonna come back and be your turn
Pretty soon you're gonna be the one that burns

[chorus]

Your turn now
