Come on and brace your face
Engulfed up in the rat race we hold our futures down
So just resist the plot and find the answer
etched eternal
as we self destruct

[Chorus]
day by day
one by one
more example of disrespect
that you seem to offer no more than complete neglect
a generation with fate all tied
this aint a game
we dont enjoy this ride

try to perceive the lie
all caught up in your own high
opinions of yourself
should be concerned about your life
theres been enough strife to crash a persons hope
and as the days delay our every other move
we've been consumed by apathy
thats right
it has become a pain
inside my brain is screaming
look what you've done to me

[chorus]

Break
its just the break we're givin em
Break
its just the break that you`re givn' em
Break

layed to waste out in the open
turned away once again
this isn't right
this ain't supposed to happen
now life's too short
we shouldn't have to die
and i have had to stop all of my emotions
why
oh bittering faith escapes agian, agian
just look at what we have done
will you look at who we've become
priorities astray
it goes on and on each day
we've wrecked their only try
and still we wonder why
we're recipients 
Of hate Motherfucker

break your back
just once and then you know
you gotta
face your fright
that's right
yeah
with your five second morals and your three second smile
you just
face your fright
that's right
yeah
with your five second morals and your three second smile
you just
face your fright
that's right
yeah
with your five second morals and your three second smile
you just
face your fright
that's right
yeah
with your five second morals and your three second smile
you just
