There must be something you can recommend. 
I've lost my faith in man again
So sick of trying to pretend. 
Same pain over and over again
How much longer do you think we'll stand. 
So little left here to live for
By the time my life is at its end. 

[Chorus]
I want it back one more time
Let me try one more time. 
Live my life one more time
We never seem ready for this

It keeps on haunting me day after day. Am I
going about things the right way
Which truth's to pass and with which truth's to say
It's all so hard I'm just so damn afraid
Had about as much as I can take. 
So little left here to live for
By the time my life is at its end. 
I'll want it back

[chorus]

I need the chance to live my life one more time
Give me the chance to live my life one more time
