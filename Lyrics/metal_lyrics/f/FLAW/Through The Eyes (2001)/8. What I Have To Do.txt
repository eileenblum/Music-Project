Well it seems as though everyone's been led astray far away from. 
From what we know, still can't find a reason or
the right words to say. It'll be ok. 

[Prechorus]
Wrapped up in all the things that are wrong.
It's the only trial so far, as the verdict falls down you still break away.

[chorus]
Caught up in a social degradation, you can't even see the truth. 
We're only half as good at personal relations, look around and see the proof.
Only a few of us go in the right direction, even though we're singled out. 
It's the only thing that keeps
me alive, I do what I have to do.

How was I to know, force fed corporate trials each day, every single day. 
But we must grow, echoing the single most thing in the way.

[prechorus]
[chorus]

Not slipping, still drifting, falling one step further from the norm. 
What is the norm? Not living, longing, trying so much
harder than before. What if I, what if I run far away?
Would I still be seen the same? Break away.

[chorus]

It's what I want.
