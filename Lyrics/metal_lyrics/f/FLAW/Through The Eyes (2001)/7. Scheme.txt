It woke up in me years ago how this was meant to be
all of those falsehoods plain to see they dug
and hung their greed
will there be profit you could see if only we were blind
lonely and sheltered, our life is free but it's 
still one step behind
just like me, they tried their rules on me
they tried their rules on me, me, me
i broke those chains and fucking split
and so you and so you and so you and so you
pass all the fascist asses ignore those classes
of bottleneck masses
producing an all but awful stench, delivering a
section off all the money stole and spent
as you start to recognize you're in the game
growing afflictions head to toe, this never
should have been
but placing blame is cowardly restructure must begin
will there be profit you could see if only we were blind
lonely and sheltered your life is free, but it's 
still one step behind
[chorus]
yes and the playing board is you...
