Here we sit all alone in an outnumbered fight 
led to decipher between wrong and right 
and some may fail at this joke that some of 
us call life 
yes at this game some call life 
but the system can't bail me out of hell 
i've made this descovery and it has helped 
all i've got is myself i have faith in that 
believe and one day you'll do just as well now 
as you were you little puppet you pauper you 
freak that's right 
that's what some of them have said to me 
so i object and try to figure things out for myself 
i'm building up full emotional wealth 
[chorus]
the inner strength is what the hate it wants 
us not to feel 
it's time that we helped there's no room to fail 
you already know the way out of hell 
all we got is ourselves i have faith in that 
believe and one day 
we'll put the system in jail, we'll put the system in jail 
i made it through scraped black and blue 
but so can you i made it through so black and blue 
but you can too i made it through scraped 
black and blue 
but so can you i've made it through 
we'll all make it through
[chorus]
