maybe nobody told you about this life 
maybe nobody answered your questions why 
simple revelations they come in time 
those liars told us things would all be fine 
born out of whack give him something possible 
you thought it would've mattered 
not likely to change things we've come too far 
where innocent young kids are put behind bars 
but it's an easy decision banished so far 
you're not as civil as you think you are 
[chorus]
you say we're all born out of whack 
well don't act so surprised how there's been 
a lot going on 
since you realized that we're all just kids trying 
to get along 
so answer one thing 
are you gonna stay inside. are you gonna stay 
inside of our minds? 
are we all born wrong? 
[chorus]
