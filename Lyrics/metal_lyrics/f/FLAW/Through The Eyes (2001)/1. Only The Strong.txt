what makes you think that it'll all work out in the end. 
afraid to feel bad. better off to try and pretend. I'm
immortal, immune to all that is wrong. just keep on wishing. 
crossing my fingers. so long. is this helping? i'm growning
weaker each day. can't stop whining. 
still afraid of what i might say or reactions, that control us one and all.

[chorus]
It's mine, it's pure and as decent as i can make myself.
Inside, we all know, only the strong survive.

Why don't you think about that?
so now i'm bleeding on myself yes once again.
seems i trusted another deceitful freind. my fault. should've known the deal.
keep your friends close, but your enemies closer, for real. 
seems easy, but nothing could be so hard. trying to guess lifes
dealing. what's the next card? I'm surely folding. 
i don't like this hand at all.

[chorus]

Keep those eyes wide open, here comes a blind side.

maybe things happen for a reason and wherein lies the answer. 
to overcome the grieving of lifes unruly lessons. i'm handed
in sucession. it builds my pain which makes me strong.

[chorus]

Why don't you think about that??
