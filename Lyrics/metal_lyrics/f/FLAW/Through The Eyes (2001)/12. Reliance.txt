so you think the areas gray but it continues each day 
a bad example of the attitude you portray 
act like I owe you my life you should be 
burdened with strife 
so i continue to pray hope that 
you'll go away 
a bad addiction to a home wrecking thing who plays 
with my heart and that's the bottom line 
i feel so empty 
what can you give me that I can't give myself 
and what part of my life can you fix, that I 
can't fix my damn self 
god i'm losing patience each day i've put 
myself in harms way 
can't seem to justify none of the shit you say 
can't find another way out here's nothing left 
but pure doubt 
i'm on the verge of pulling my hair straight out 
so if you listen to me not to the powers that be 
we're not supposed to be together can't you see 
in decision is the bottom line i feel so empty now 
[chorus]
i'm gonna show you now this time i'm getting out 
i've said it many times but this time I have 
figured out 
just how i'm moving on it's taken way too long 
inside I know i'll feel much better when you're 
really gone 
[chorus]
