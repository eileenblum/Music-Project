SILENCE in the midst of madness, of men hellbent on war
SILENTLY we endure the hardship so others can have more

SILENCE... Time has come to break this...
SILENCE... Time i snow to break my...
Silence is... BETRAYAL to the ones you love
BETRAYAL to us all
BETRAYAL to all the innocent

Silence is... BETRAYAL to humanity
BETRAYAL to the worl
BETRAYAL to all those suffering

SILENCE is BETRAYAL
