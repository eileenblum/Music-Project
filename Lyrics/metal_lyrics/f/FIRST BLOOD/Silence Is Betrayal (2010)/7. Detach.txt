The more we look... THE MORE WE LOOK
And understand... AND UNDERSTAND
We start to see... LIES EVERYWHERE
And get the feeling that...
WE HAVE BEEN MISLED

By illusions that constantly
Try to convince me of what to believe
And tell me what I need
Tell me how I should feel
That all of this is real
I know there's got to be...
SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS
False sense of reality
The truth is what I seek
Into this fabric of conformity
Some choose to blend
But I choose to...

DETACH from this legacy
DETACH from this lunacy
DETACH from this apathy
DETACH from this insanity
DETACH from this suffering
DETACH from this misery

At the point of no return
And there's no turning back

I will not LIVE MY LIFE
By the game that's laid out for the masses
HOW CAN THEY JUSTIFY
Who will live, who will die, who will suffer?
HOW DO THEY SLEEP AT NIGHT?
To defy and to face consequences
THIS IS THE CHANCE WE TAKE
In our struggle to find true meaning
I made the choice to...

BREAK free from this cycle, I must...
BREAK free from this herd
BREAK free from the madness that's been crippling this world
I must BREAK FREE FROM THIS CYCLE
I must BREAK FREE FROM THIS HERD
We all must BREAK FREE FROM THE MADNESS
That's been CRIPPLING THIS WORLD

When I look back to the beginning
To see where this journey began
To see those planes crash into those two buildings
I knew there had to be more than this

The more we look... THE MORE WE LOOK
And understand... AND UNDERSTAND
We start to see... LIES EVERYWHERE
I know there's got to be more than this

WE HAVE BEEN MISLED
We all have been misled
I know thre's got to be more than THIS

This world won't defeat me
It's my life and I chose to...

DETACH from their conditioning
DETACH from all this hypocrisy
DETACH from all that's enslaving me
DETACH from this false reality
DETACH from this legacy
DETACH from this insanity

All that we've known is just a game
All we've been told is just a game
The lies we're sold; It's just a game
It's getting old; I know it's just a game
