Why are we LIVING IN FEAR
Of who we are and what we have
Afraid to STAND FOR OUR BELIEFS
To rise against, voice our dissent
And not be torn DOWN FROM WITHIN

The more we give, the more they take
If they can KEEP US ALL AFRAID
Taking advantage to make sure that we are...

Kept in a constant state of...
Kept in a constant state of... FEAR!

Why are we living... LIVING IN FEAR
Why are we living in FEAR

Of what we do not understand
LIVING IN FEAR
As we keep eating out of their hands
LIVING IN FEAR
This plague I cannot comprehend
LIVING IN FEAR
When will this madness ever END

Searching for the answers but they're
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
As they take our rights and bury them
SIX FEET IN THE GROUND

SEARCHING FOR THE ANSWERS
BUT THEY'RE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND

As they take our rights, our freedom, and liberties and bury them...
SIX FEET IN THE GROUND

Why are we living in...

FEAR of organizing
FEAR of consequences
FEAR to take a risk and...

FEAR of organizing
FEAR of sacrificing
FEAR of realizing

Why are we living in FEAR?
