Don't believe the lies
Read between the lines
Seek and you will find
The truth has been denied
Don't believe the lies so easily
Read between the lines to see the signs
Seek and you will find they're everywhere
The truth has been denied for all our lives
As long as there are those who feel the need
To lie and deceive
To gain advantage
To achieve their ends
There are those will keep pointing it out
That day will come
When they no longer get away
With all the lying through their teeth
That day will come
When they get the message
Dragging their bodies through the streets
Maybe then they'll learn
The lesson that they teach
That filter down through all society
If at first you don't succeed
Then lie and lie and lie again
The culture of deceit that filters down through all society
That if at first you don't succeed
Then lie and lie and lie again
That day will come
The tides of justice take their turn
Sending the message that this cannot continue
Or else they'll never fucking learn
If you continue to lie and deceive the people
Then you will fucking burn!
