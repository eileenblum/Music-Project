Silence those who protest
Opponents of the government
Use the courts to extend
Powers to repress dissent

Dig up their past... KILL
Discredit their name... KILL
Divide their cause... KILL
Stifle debate... KILL! KILL

Single out those who speak
Who question your authority
Target those who resist
And lavel them all terrorists

Smear them with lies... KILL
Accuse them of hate... KILL
To justify all the horrors
Wrought in your name

Kill the MESSENGER
YOU MUST KILL THE MESSENGER
To shield all consequence of the lie
The agenda you should never engage
YOU MUST KILL THE MESSENGER
Thje mortal enemy of the lie
And the greatest enemy of the state
YOU MUST KILL THE MESSENGER of the truth
That is why they'd rather see me DEAD
