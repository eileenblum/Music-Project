I'm just trying to live
I'm just trying to survive
And find the meaning, my purpose in life
And break free from all that has been
Holding me down from the goals I wish to achieve

I'm just trying to keep the message alive
I'm just trying to live
I'm just trying to survive

The influences that try to shape our minds
Our difference that they stress to make us fight
But we know better, all together singing...

Through my conviction I have remained free and clear
Through dedication to the values I hold, dear
To keep the message and the resistance alive

I'm just trying to live
I'm just trying to survive
And find the meaning, my purpose in life
And break free from all that has been
Holding me down from the goals I wish to achieve

I'm just trying to keep the message alive
I'm just trying to live
I'm just trying to survive
I'm just trying to live
I'm just trying to survive
I'm just trying to live
I'm just trying to survive
I'm just trying to live my fucking life

The influences that try to shape our minds
The forces telling us how to live our lives
Won't be defeated, won't be denied by
By people telling us how to live our lives

The forces telling us how to live our lives
Just trying to live, trying to survive
The forces telling us how to live our lives
The forces telling us how to live our lives
Won't be defeated, won't be denied by
The people telling us how to live our lives

Can't slay the beast, at least we can change our minds
The only place for truth we'll ever find
Why can't they see that we are so much more than meets the eyes
Because what matters the most is what's inside
I'm just trying to live...
I'm just trying to survive
