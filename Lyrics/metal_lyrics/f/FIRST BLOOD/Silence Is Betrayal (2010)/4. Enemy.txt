I'm not your enemy
We're not your enemy
They're not who they appear to be
Those with the power to
Control our beliefs

To break this curse
Expose for all to see
To know that I am on your side
We're on your side
Powers that be have their methods
To dominate and be secure
In their power

To gain control
Over all that we see...
All that we see
Over all that we hear...
All that we hear
Manipulate to divide and conquer
Search for the truth
And you'll find the real enemy

I'm not your enemy
We're not your enemy
They're not who they appear to be
Because some things are not
Always as they seem

Control the public mind
To be secure in their power
