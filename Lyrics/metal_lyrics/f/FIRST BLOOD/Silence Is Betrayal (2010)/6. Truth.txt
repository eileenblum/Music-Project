The pain that we must all endure
To pass the THREE STAGES OF TRUTH

So many who base their lives
On the prevailing point of view
And because a great many who will believe
Therefore it must be true

DARE NOT TO ASK...
Who gains? Who profits? Who wins?
Who benefits the most?
From the conditions we accept with our own lying eyes
From believing what we are told
WHAT WE ARE TOLD!

Those we condemn... THOSE WE CONDEMN
For what they know... FOR WHAT THEY KNOW
To have the vision to see beyond the status quo...

1) First they are RIDICULED then
2) Opposed so violently until...
3) ACCEPTANCE

These are the three stages of truth

The pain that we must all endure
To pass the THREE STAGES OF TRUTH

The pain... the THREE STAGES OF TRUTH
The damage... the THREE STAGES OF TRUTH

The pain that we must all endure
To pass the THREE STAGES OF TRUTH

The damage we must all endure
To pass the THREE STAGES OF TRUTH
