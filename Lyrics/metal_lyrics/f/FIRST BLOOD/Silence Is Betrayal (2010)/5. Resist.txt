The choice to refuse/RESIST!
To say NO! I WON'T COMPLY!

With the corrupt institutions that keep getting worse with time
While liars and cheaters keep looting the system and robbing people blind...

I REFUSE to pledge and ounce of allegiance to benefit the few
I REFUSE to serve and FIGHT for a system that's really fighting you...
IT'S FIGHTING YOU!

Why do we need the?
How do we beat them?
TELL ME HOW do we defeat them?
When does this begin?
IT STARTS NOW!

Buried under all this weight. Tell me...
How much will you take? HOW MUCH WILL YOU TAKE?
Stand up before it's too late. Tell me...
How long will you wait? HOW LONG WILL YOU WAIT?
Feel like you've been pushed too far?
The time is now to draw the line... TIME TO DRAW THE LINE!

The choice to refuse/RESIST!
And say NO! I won't comply!
NO! I WON'T COMPLY!

Why do we need them?
How do we beat them?
TELL ME HOW do we defeat them?
IT STARTS NOW!
