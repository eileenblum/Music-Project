I cannot forgive, what I cannot forget...that day you took that shovel to my chest. Because of you I'll never trust. Because of you I'll never heal. You represent a time and place that I wish to forget. Dead. Next time I see you, you're DEAD. Don't even bother to waste your time to make amends. You don't deserve a place in my life ever again.
