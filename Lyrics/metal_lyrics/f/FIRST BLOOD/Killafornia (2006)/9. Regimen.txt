Conditioned to live life in constant SERVITUDE, never questioning another way OF LIVING LIFE 'cause what I gave you I didn't get back in return for my time spent building their dreams 'til I was left with nothing. Spending each waking moment waiting for my days to end. A slave to the man will somone just save me from this regimen. Forcing myself to do something in absolute compromise. I'm stuck in a rut will someone just save mefrom this torture, from the life that I truly seek, I have to take a chance and live in risk 'cause these chances are just passing by. Pieces of my soul being to face. Will someone just TAKE ME AWAY from this modern slavery. Just so high someone can climb, yet still they fall behind. And when it's gone they treat it like it's the end of the world. THE END OF YOUR WORLD. I can't let life pass me by. Save me from this regimen now.
