Nowhere to run, to hide. Justice, revenge FOR THEIR CRIMES. Bloodshed without warning. Now they must all PAY THE PRICE. The ultimate in justice, reprisal for their crimes. Assassinate, eliminate, the rule of an eye for an eye. The moral question, to take another's life. Political necessity when justice has been denied. TERRORIZED for crimes that often go untried. SPREADING FEAR throughtout their victims, ultimate sacrifice. CRITICIZED for killing any hope for peace. VIOLENCE no matter what the consequence. Who pays the price? All for a place that they call home. Conflict will never end, all for a place that they call home. This pain, this suffering, in a fight that will never end. Withdraw, to disengage from a place that they call home. Reclaim, retaliate in a fight that will never end. Fighting for a home, the right to claim a land, when victory is everything and nothing will hold back. This is their fight to keep their home. This is their fight to claim their land. This is their fight to keep their culture and their people on the map. Someone must pay for their crimes. Attrition. Kill their own kind. Suicide. Kill their own kind. Attrition. Kill their own kind. And they will fight with everything for victory no matter what the price. They must defeat at any price and they will fight with everything, relentlessly, when justice is denied. The choice must be made. Kill. This price must be paid. Kill The choice must be made. KILL. This price must be paid. KILL. Revenge must be made. KILL. For a place that they can call THEIR HOME. And they will fight with everything until they've reached their goal. The price to pay for a place to call their home to keep their culture and their people on the map. Conflict will never end, all for a place that they call home.
