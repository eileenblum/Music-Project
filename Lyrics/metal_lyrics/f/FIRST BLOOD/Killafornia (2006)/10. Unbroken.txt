WHERE ARE YOU NOW? Hiding behind the mask of blatant fucking lies. I despise everything you once fucking said. Look into your eyes there's NOTHING LEFT. What have you become but a WHISPER IN THE WIND. Every word you said has been pissed away and ripped to shreds TORN THE FUCK APART. Now we are left with this epiphany. No sympathy and not one BROKEN HEART. For all the wrong reasons you won't be forgotten. But I remain UNBROKEN. I watched as it slipped through your fucking hands. It won't be a surprise if you're not ever SEEN AGAIN but I will remain... UNBROKEN.
