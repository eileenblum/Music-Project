The polluted face of life hiding in black clouds unknowingly killing you, killing me. HIS FILTHY HANDS... are wrapped around our trusting throats but the last thing that we need is another liar breathing the fire... SUFFOCATE... of death down below. Suffering in solitude as your last breath slips away... with no one ever knowing. From the last generation, turning their backs to the truth, to the new generation, continue to spread the truth. Rebellion against the truth... Ignorant minds hide from the truth... Angry minds defy the truth... Greedy minds deny the truth... as we all SUFFOCATE.
