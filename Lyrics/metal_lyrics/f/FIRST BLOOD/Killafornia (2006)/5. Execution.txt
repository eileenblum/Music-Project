Someday you'll have to face the fire. Someday you'll have to face their law. Someday you'll have to face your trial. Someday you'll have to face the firing line. THE FIRING LINE. Wave your flag of your beliefs and wave it high, safe within the group in which you confide. Wear your mask, let everone know just where you stand. Irony strikes when you help bring your demise. Casualty of war no matter what you're fighting for. Sentence you to death unless you cowardly conform. They will pick apart your everything, shoot you down for anything, tryin to gain anything, everything. Face the firing line. Blindfold, hands behind your back. Deciding moment, will you stand or will you turn back? Under attack, will you defend your honor? When no one has your back, will you press on or cowar? They will kill. They will take. And relent until you break. Will you bend for their sake? It's your choice to stand or break. Most of them won't make it out alive. ALIVE. Some will stand or join the other side. THE OTHER SIDE. You can choose your fate. Will you stand or break, it's up to you. Do what you can cause you can choose your fate. Do what you will, it's up to you, so will you stand or break the line? Wave your flag of your belief's and wave it high. You've endured a true lesson in life. Someday you'll have to face the fire. Someday you'll have to face their law. Someday you'll have to face your trial. Someday you'll have to face the firing line. THE FIRING LINE.
