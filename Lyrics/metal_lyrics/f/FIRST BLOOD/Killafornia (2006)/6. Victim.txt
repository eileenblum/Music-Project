Defend your life, defend your soul. Victims digging our own graves. Terror. Horror. Fear within their veins passed down along a never ending chain. ANOTHER VICTIM DIES. The lies kill both sides. No regard. No respect for life. UNDERSTAND the effects kill two ways... killing the life, killing the soul. FALL VICTIM TO THEIR LIES. Defend a way of life you can't justify. How many more must die? Defend your life, defend your soul, but you will pay FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE. Set your stake and place a price with no RESPECT FOR LIFE. Raping, pillaging, someday you will pay. Taking, displacing, someday you will pay. Mock me, belittle me, someday you will pay. ANOTHER VICTIM DIES. FALL VICTIM TO THEIR LIES.
