For all the promises BROKEN
For the lives and the dreams that we've BROKEN
For our faith in a system that's BROKEN
So many rules meant to be BROKEN NOW

So many rules must be broken now

Burn down, tear down, break this...
BREAK THIS LEGACY DOWN

Find the reason, now it's time to begin
And recognize the evils of this system
Open your eyes before the years drag you down
In a civilization that is drowning in
War, hate, death and division
Reject this lesson of aggression
that keeps on teaching us...

"If there is something you want
and you have the means
then you TAKE IT"

"If you can't change their will
then you BREAK IT"

Force is king and it need not be spoken
So many rules meant to be BROKEN NOW

BREAK THIS LEGACY DOWN

Every barrier, every wall must be broken NOW
Every unjust law must be broken NOW
Every form of division must be broken NOW
Every gear in this corrupt machine must be broken NOW

Every link in their chains BROKEN
Every lock in their cages BROKEN
Every beam in their structures BROKEN
So many rules meant to be BROKEN NOW
So many rules have to be BROKEN NOW
Break this legacy DOWN
