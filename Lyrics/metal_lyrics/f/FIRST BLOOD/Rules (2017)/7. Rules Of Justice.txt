All that they KNOW is no JUSTICE
Can we expect them to ever KNOW PEACE
All that they KNOW is no JUSTICE
Always and forever NO PEACE

All that they KNOW is no JUSTICE
Can we expect them to ever KNOW PEACE
All that they KNOW is no JUSTICE
Condemned to forever NO PEACE

FIFTY YEARS of brute occupation
Cleverly concealed through misinformation
Who can explain with no rhyme to the riddle?
That's what you get, starting stories in the middle

"All they know is violence" LIE!
"They've hated us forever" LIE!
"So complicated, so why even bother" LIE!
Ignoring the root of the conflict leads to the
Third, fourth, fifth... INFINITE INTIFADA

Do you hear their cries for JUSTICE?
No justice, NO PEACE!

The RULES OF THE GAME WILL CHANGE
We've come to the end of our patience
Must end this humiliation
World stands in direct condemnation
ENOUGH WITH THE OCCUPATION!
Boycott Divestment SANCTIONS
Diplomacy, non-violent ACTION
Year of conflict resolution
Before it explodes into ALL OUT WAR

Do you hear their cries for JUSTICE?
No justice, NO PEACE!

Free their people!
Free their nation!
ENOUGH WITH THE OCCUPATION!
