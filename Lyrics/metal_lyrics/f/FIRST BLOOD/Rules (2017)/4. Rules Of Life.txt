I CAN'T for the life of me begin to imagine
Where I would be if I denied
This chance to follow a calling
I'd regret for the rest OF MY LIFE

WHEN I LOOK BACK
To the way those around me would see it
His generation wouldn't dare fall out of line
Why dream? You will never fucking be it!
This is how it is until the day you fucking die
Inside I felt the fire burning
Like a bomb ticking it would only be a matter of time
Break free in a split second decision
Carve my own path, to hell with your tradition

DON'T TELL ME that's the way that is
DON'T TELL ME that nothing will change
DON'T TELL ME just do more of the same
Don't tell me THAT'S LIFE!

Don't take for granted all the moments in life
When you feel like you are moving up, MOVING ON
In this life, be careful what you wish for...
You never know what you have until it's gone

DON'T TELL ME that's the way that is
DON'T TELL ME that nothing will change
DON'T TELL ME just get over your dreams
Don't tell me THAT'S LIFE!

That's life?
That's life?
That's life?
That's life

THAT'S LIFE
Having courage to stand on your own
Follow what you believe even when you're alone
THAT'S LIFE
Be strong, be proud, be brave
To be a fucking rebel instead of a slave
THAT'S LIFE
To see the world, follow your dreams
THAT'S LIFE
Independent from life's routines
THAT'S LIFE
There is nothing you can't achieve
THAT'S LIFE
Wolfgang! This is for you!
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
That's life
THAT'S LIFE
FUCK!
