What are you willing to sacrifice TONIGHT?

Are you willing to SACRIFICE your rights?
Are you willing to SACRIFICE your time?
Are you willing to SACRIFICE your life?
What are you willing to SACRIFICE TONIGHT?

You speak of things with deep admiration
Things you will never know
You praise the values of a dead generation
How far are you willing to go?
Oblivious to the facts, that a grim truth awaits
No rest, just death for those who are willing to...

SACRIFICE their freedom for security
DESERVE NEITHER SACRIFICE
nor bloodshed in their name
For those who...
SACRIFICE compassion for authority
I will SACRIFICE nothing for their gain
And that WILL NEVER CHANGE

To live, to thrive, you shouldn't have to
SACRIFICE YOUR RIGHTS
To be safe and live free, you shouldn't have to
SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE
What gives meaning, what makes me feel alive
I am willing to SACRIFICE my time
For those I love, forever willing to
SACRIFICE MY LIFE

For those I love, I will SACRIFICE
