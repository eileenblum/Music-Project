No one can serve two masters
and survive the seas of treason
How faith in government defies
both history and reason...

What we were meant to be...
INDEPENDENT AND FREE

The shadow cast by the ruling class
If we only could see past

Within these hands...
WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS
in the hands of the "more capable set of men"
WITH THE PURSUIT
marginalized, factionalized, and dispossessed
THE SELECT FEW
To answer to this purpose
with permanence and stability to
PROTECT minority of the opulent
against the majority

Protecting wealth is the primary role of GOVERNMENT
Overwhelmed by those who pull the strings of GOVERNMENT

SERVE AND PROTECT
The power to coerce by violence declines
to BALANCE AND CHECK
Other mechanisms of control must be devised
AND MUST EXTEND
over what they know and they feel
and belief systems inside
Like ARMIES regiment their bodies
we must regiment their minds

Control by force until they bow in fear of GOVERNMENT
Mould their thoughts so they don't interfere with GOVERNMENT
Send them to war and they will fight and die for GOVERNMENT
My father told me that I should never serve the GOVERNMENT

For those who gave their fucking lives
Can you imagine the outrage
FOR THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR FUCKING LIVES

We must fight the rising TIDE
The tides are turning and it's only just a matter of TIME
Before the masses wake up to this LIE
CAN YOU?
Can you imagine the outrage for those who gave their fucking LIVES

FOR THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR FUCKING LIVES
