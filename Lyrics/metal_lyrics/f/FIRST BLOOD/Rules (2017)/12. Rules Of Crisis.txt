To wish that one day...
I'LL MAKE IT HOME

Distant explosions come creeping closer
I hear the terror right over my shoulder
Death falls from a blue sky we lived and loved
Now thick black smoke blocks out our
WARMING SUN
Grab what you can
Take only what you need
Ditch the rest
We have to leave
I take one final look around this room
I can't help but feel like we left too soon

There's no exceptions to the rules
RULES OF CRISIS

Run down
FORCED OUT
Stay down
GET OUT

Sprinting for an unknown fate
Get aboard before it's too late
As we push off I begin to mourn
Forced from a land I love for unknown shores
Amidst the chaos of an angry sea
I pray to God it doesn't swallow me
A prayer that would go unheard
I've entered a fight from which I would not return

As I come undone
And as the water fills my lungs
I use my last bit of hope
To wish that one day
I'LL MAKE IT HOME

TAKE ME HOME

With only one wish to TAKE ME HOME

I always thought my time would come more peacefully
With family, not freezing water surrounding me
I'll just give in because now it's clear to me
That in this world, only death treats us equally

TAKE ME HOME
