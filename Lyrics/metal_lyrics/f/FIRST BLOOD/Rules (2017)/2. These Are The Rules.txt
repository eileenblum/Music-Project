THESE ARE THE RULES
We accept but refuse to ignore
The things we never question but we choose to endure
THESE ARE THE RULES
That keep us fighting war after war
But no one knows what they are even fucking fighting for
THESE ARE THE RULES
THESE ARE THE RULES
THESE ARE THE RULES
THESE ARE THE RULES
THESE ARE THE RULES

THESE ARE THE RULES
That control everything that we do
Regimented to the service of a privileged few
THESE ARE THE RULES
That deny those with nothing to give
Because the system doesn't care if you die or you live
THESE ARE THE RULES
That we promise to defend until the day that we die
THESE ARE THE RULES
That never stop controlling our fucking lives

DON'T STOP fighting the lies and the greed
DON'T STOP fighting the fascist machine
DON'T STOP fighting for what you believe
If you're to rise up from this hate
DON'T, DON'T STOP
DON'T STOP fighting for what you believe
If you're to rise up from this hate

NEVER FORGET the solution in front of your face
Just walk away from a system meant to keep you in your FUCKING PLACE
Trying to change the world, but are you willing to change yourself?
Stop depending on someone else...

We've got to find the courage to REARRANGE
The vision to SEE THE CHANGE
To live to BE THE CHANGE
You want to see in THIS WORLD

THESE ARE THE RULES
When your life is falling to pieces
You gotta let it go...

THESE ARE THE RULES
Start to see things a little more clear
Now you know you don't have to keep living in fear
THESE ARE THE RULES
Be strong and look out for each other
Instead of fucking running for cover

DON'T STOP
DON'T STOP
Fighting for what you believe
DON'T STOP
DON'T STOP
Fighting to...
RISE UP FROM THIS HATE

THESE ARE THE RULES
DON'T STOP fighting for what you believe
If you're to rise up from this hate
THESE ARE THE RULES
