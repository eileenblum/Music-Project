Time fades everything with painful certainty
Remember when we used to FIGHT FOR SOMETHING
Because I refuse to be taken so easily
or to believe that this was ALL FOR NOTHING

One BY one BY one pieces begin to fall
It's got you thinking nothing LASTS FOREVER
What you still feel inside, simply can't be denied
So take the step because this is NOW OR NEVER

Stone BY stone BY stone we build this back again
To when we used to fucking STAND FOR SOMETHING
So after all these years, the blood, the sweat, the tears
I won't forget respect for those who remain...

Loyal... LOYAL TO THE GRAVE
You remained loyal... LOYAL TO THE GRAVE

After all you've done you remained
Loyal... LOYAL TO THE GRAVE
In the face of the wrath of sanity
Loyal... LOYAL TO THE GRAVE
After all you've done you still stayed
Loyal... LOYAL TO THE GRAVE

Across the world, the fierce opposition
Outnumbered, but maintained position
Day after day, imminent confrontation
Stay on message, the true motivation
Now! ALWAYS PERSISTENT!
In the face of this constant resistance
Paving the way while your allies diminish
Seeing it through, to the end, TO THE FINISH

For those who remain...
Loyal... LOYAL TO THE GRAVE
You've remained loyal... LOYAL TO THE GRAVE

Are you sure? I am sure!
Are you sure? I am sure!
I am sure as the BLOOD RUNS THROUGH MY VEINS

For the ones who stood by me
And the ones who paved my way
Are you sure? I am sure of it!
SURE as the BLOOD RUNS THROUGH MY VEINS!
For the ones who still believe
And the ones who gave everything
Are you sure? I am sure of it!
SURE as the BLOOD RUNS THROUGH MY VEINS!
For the ones who still remain
These beliefs will never fade...

These beliefs will NEVER FUCKING FADE!

Rules of CONVICTION!
