Climb:
You see, I am here:
right on the top...

Imperious time of decay.
Gargoyle donât be sad.
Inaction is what they expect from this old men
but I never gave the pleasure...
You idiots who know nothing,
who only put the blame on the others
for their own lousy life.

Wings of mercy, do not save me.
Wings of mercy let me fall.

People:
We donât go away!
We always lose!
Heâs a liar!  Let him pay the prize!
We donât need âem...  Shoot âem!
Traffic Jam...  Why donât they fix our problems?
Liar! Liar! Liar!

Climb:
Why not !
