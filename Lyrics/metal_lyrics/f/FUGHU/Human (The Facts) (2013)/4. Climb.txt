[People:]
Climbing a tree in the forest,
looking down the lights fading out
and hearing noise of all the people
talking Â´bout you.

There was a time
when you were the one,
the tallest, the clever, the famous.
The one all wanted to hear.
But the boss is other now...
...and he doesn't even know your name.

[Climb:]
Cold as youâve been, spitting on your feet,
they left you one by one.
All those men who claimed to be your friends
but no one has the guts now.

There was a time
when you were the one
the tallest, the clever, the famous,
the one all wanted to hear.
But the boss is other now.

She always looked so great...
If she were here sure youâd have the strength.
But your hands is not so strong now
as the time you saw her so bright into the night.

Climbing a tree in the forest,
looking down the lights fading out
and hearing the noise of you, the people
talking âbout me...

The boss is other now!
They are denying my name!

Falling down! Down!
