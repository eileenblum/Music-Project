[Climb:]
Between the curtains,
seeing you walking through the room
your skin so white, your eyes so far
you are so pale, why are you here?
Your teeth are redâ¦

Love me till I die, you said
âLove me till day I dieâ

Under the pillow I have
Can feel it, cold as an ice
in this fucking room so alone...

Love me till the day I die
you said âLove me till the day I dieâ
