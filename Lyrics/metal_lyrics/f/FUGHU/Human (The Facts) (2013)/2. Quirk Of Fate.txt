Welcome, my friends, to this compendium of humanity.
A hall of mockery and reality.
YouÂ´re gonna witness the quirk of fate
and how things happened in such funny ways.

[Thlot:]
Tonight my friend
Iâm going to betray you.
You wonât see it comming
but you have to know
things have changed
and will change much more.

The wave is so strong this time
and IÂ´m moving to the highlands.
You are what you are.
And that will never change.

Iâve never thought you were the best.
YouÂ´re so weak and slow.
Obviously youÂ´re out of time.
ItÂ´s not by chance she came to me.
Her flameÂ´s still burning.
I know... she knows...

Complete my fate.
Complete me.
Come please my fate.
I am the one,
the succesor in your seat.
I am the one.

I remember good times.
I remember the bad times.
And that will never change.

Throughout this bitter rain IÂ´m blessed with an open sky.
Just me to rule myself, not someone else.
Time has come to change the actors of the scene.
Laughing I am, fooled is my destiny.

Goodbye nobodies!
IÂ´m blowing in the wind.
Goodbye my past life, my memories.

Goodbye nobodies!
YouÂ´ll see me on a screen!
Time to write my new memories.
My destiny! My destiny!
Time to write...
