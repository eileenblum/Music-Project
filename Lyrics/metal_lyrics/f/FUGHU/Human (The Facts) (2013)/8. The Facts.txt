[Part 1: In the top of nothing]

[Host:]
Are you prepared?
Are you still there?
The very end's coming.
Our man still on the roof.

He is on the top of nothing
but he have to choose.
Still on mumbles, still on burbles.
He never lived in love.
Oh dear!

Look at him, just an old fool.
But he should be feared!
The poor bastard...
Shall we watch the completed tale?

[Part 2: The doom waits for no one]

[Climb:]
How could this tired hands make it once more?
Once I trusted, once I was weak.
But I will make them both crawl. I made them!
You shut up! I know who I am.
And I am this building.
And I am going back for whatâs mine.
I only master my fate.
And the doom waits for no one.

[Part 3: Fade away]

[Climb:]
I'm going down the stairs.
Must be the last floor.
Donât look at me like that!
You stay back now!

I'll be the last to laugh.
I'm laughing.
Don't look at me as I was gone.
Iâm not gone!

Every breath I take, I feel, I feel stronger hands.
Every breath I hold.
Thlot where are you, fuck!
Somebody screams "relax old man"
Somebody's screaming full of lies.

I'm going down the stairs.
The lights over my head.
I will unlock your past,
the darkest side of you.

[People:]
Youâre falling down and now itâs too late.
Leave all behind, fade away.

[Climb:]
Stay away from me!
Vater: blut bleibt,
Climb and Otto Climb: blut stirbt!

I'm going down the stairs.
Her smell's still here.
The window opened legs, I can't resist.
Everyone I've trusted has been silenced.
Everyone I hold now they're gone.

Now violently I starred,
the abyss straight ahead.
He looks at me from there.
But father, I'm not you.

[People:]
Youâre falling down and now itâs too late.
Leave all behind, fade away.

[Climb:]
All I hear is:
âNight must fall. Relax, old man,
forget, conform, surrenderâ
âNight must fall. Relax, old man.
You'll gonna be so safeâ.

The chair is mine.
Itâs my name, my name!

Now violently I starred, the abyss straight ahead. 
They look at me from there.
Why does red taints the view?

Everyone I know have been silenced.
Everyone I hold now they're gone.

[People:]
One treeâs fallen, one grows near it.
One treeâs fallen, one grows near it.

Night must fall.
Your time is near.
