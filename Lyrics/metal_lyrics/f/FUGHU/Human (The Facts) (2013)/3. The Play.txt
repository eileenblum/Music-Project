[Climb:]
Time, I wish for nothing more.
You turned my fears in scars
through the window of the bar.
Time: a picture fading slow.
Through the glass I hear that song.

See my hands, drawing near âlove me till I dieâ.
âTill I dieâ, you said to me.
As my life rides in this merry go around,
spinning in my mind.

This is not the field where the battleÂ´s gonna be
but the actors are coming to play.
The sand is clean, just some traces of little feet
and a barbie leg, and a little car, and a chocolate bar.
Another Billy is playing alone, the other is the laughing one
and many... I donât know... obey.
ItÂ´s the play.

Now she hides.
He goes round.
Leave their friends behind.
She is so beautifuly shy.

How could I win at last?
I'm so tired of running now.
I donât want to run.

Oh, boy,
now is time to play again.
You know the way you are.
Oh, boy,
now is time to play again.
Now is time to play again
Can you change?
