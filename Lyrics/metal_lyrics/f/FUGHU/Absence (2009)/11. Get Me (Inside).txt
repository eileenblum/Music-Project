Voices in my head
start to get me scared.
Through these fears I stand.
Screaming for revenge.

Absolutly insane.
Wasting time again
Try to stay alone.
Try to keep your soul.

I close my eyes.
Nothing left to say again.

Absolutly insane.
Wasting time again
Try to stay alone.
Try to keep your soul.

For a while
I feel the changes...

Come and get me, Iâm inside
Come and get me, now.

DonÂ´t know where to go.
DonÂ´t need nothing more.
Need to find my way
to be free, my friend.

For a while
I feel changes in my mind.

Come and get me, IÂ´m inside.
Come and get me, IÂ´m inside.
Come and get me, now IÂ´m inside!
Come and get me...  Now!

Get me inside!

Come and get me...
For a while
I feel changes in my mind.
For a while
I feel changes...

Come and get me, IÂ´m inside.
Come and get me, IÂ´m inside.
Come and get me, Iâm just right your eyes!
Come and get me...  Now!

For a while
I feel changes in my mind.
ThatÂ´s how I feel now.
Inside.
