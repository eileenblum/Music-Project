In the dark,
the eye of the storm.
Colors
in a black and white world

Slow dig
in your mind.
Careful.
Donât you cry now.

Donât know
what is real, what is a dream?
Raceâs on.
now the rain starts to fall.

Shadows, misery .
Need to be forgot.

Blind man.
Lost in voices
deep in yourself.
In this world.
Misery.

The road
is full of dead and falling kings.
Genious lost walking in waisted worlds.

Shadows, misery .
Need to be forgot

Timeless,
storm is getting closer.
Still the sand
keeps falling down.

ThereÂ´s no one who can understand yourself.
No one feels what you feel.
Are you reaching out?  Are you fighting blind?
Lost in your own world,
face the dices now.
You know my friend
that youÂ´re on your own.

King of lonely, genious lost.
No one sees your crown.
In your castle, in your cage
no one sees you shine.
Know you drowning down.

Storm is coming ahead.
Still youÂ´re lost in your world.
RaceÂ´s on.
