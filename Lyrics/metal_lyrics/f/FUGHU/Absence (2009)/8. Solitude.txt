One last song
with falling tears
around the memories.
Silent eyes, broken glasses
no matter what you see.

You know yourself.
Wait for yourself
to see the circle drawn once again.
Deranged by the voices
distempering your mind
in a shelter, in a twister.
White pages and alcohol.

One last song
of tears and pain.
A tale written in your skin.
Silent eyes, broken promises.
You're loosing all you care.

You know yourself and gently hope
the brand old sky to settle in its place.
And the breath of the old voices
finally comes to help
and gives you the streght
to get and up to get out.

Lying lines in poetry games
the foolish play you play
lost confused in a future in the past.

Autumn rain falling and singing
ancient fingers, the same curiosity.
Tired is the glance
denies to hear, to see.

Fade to grey, becoming flesh,
lying in the cage.
With those who are not here
in this side of the mask.
Where nothing is so real,
where nothing itÂ´s more real
than the solitude
my lonely solitude
my sweety solitude
a little bitter sweety solitude
