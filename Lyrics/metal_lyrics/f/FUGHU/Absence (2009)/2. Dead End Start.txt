Don't understand the situation.
Nothing has changed and everything's changed.
I can't pretend it flows by my side.
But I know I will go on and sure will you.

Can't fix my shape in your twisted mirror.
You spoke my truth in your little disguise.
You're still the same but I can't trust you no more.
As you can't match your words with the facts.

Dead end start.
Dead end start.
When you're blowing the ashes of what will never be
all that you see is a
dead end start.

I don't regret persuing your game.
Although you say, now, we have never played at all.
Some bitter memories from tomorrow.
From where I've never been got to move on.

Dead end start.
Dead end start.
When you finally feel there's nothing you feel
all that you live is a
dead end start.

Blackened dream
with my eyes wide open.
Insanity:
is it the answer to it all?
Anyway
my mind still wonders
how I got here in this

dead end start.
Dead end start.
When you're blowing the ashes of what will never be
all that you see is a
dead end start.

Dead end start.
Dead end start.
When you finally feel there's nothing you feel
all you see, all you live, all that you feel is a
dead end start
