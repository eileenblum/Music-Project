Going out to find
donÂ´t know what, donÂ´t know why.
The moon shines so dark.
So fucked-up and lonely.
One more vodka, life still goes on.

Blinded foolish mad man.

Trumbled by my sorrows.

There was a day, I don't know when.
I wasn't me, you weren't you.
What made the glass so deadly break?
The screaming silent moment when your
heartbeat gave away my soul.

what is true, what is false?
Laughing, I drawn on your void in
the back of the bar.

How we got in this black dawn?

Going out to find
donÂ´t know why, donÂ´t know what.

I saw you dream, I saw you fly.
I felt your heart, beat so hard.
Felt your skin, heard you crying, why do you leave?

Why everything is empty?
Bitterness has won.
IÂ´m still waiting but you'll never come back.
Drinking all my memories
from a sorrow broken cup.
IÂ´m still waiting but you'll never come back.
When the sweetest wine
turns in bitter lies,
IÂ´m still waiting but you'll never come back

words I have to say
that you would never gonna hear
cause youÂ´re gone and youÂ´re not coming back

Where are now?
Where have they gone?
Those stories that we wrote...

[whispering:]
All that chearfull moments we have shared
Where have they gone
Right, You are right:
I'm a fake.

Going out to find
donÂ´t know what, donÂ´t know why

This is not me.
Right.
You donÂ´t see me ?
You are right I'm a fake
Here IÂ´am lost.
Here you're not.
Right
donÂ´t you say that
that is not you
You are right I'm a fake
Where are you know?
Where are you know?
ItÂ´s rainnig now

Going out in a hopeless fight
shouting smiling crying hard
coursing craving through the croud
fighting my crow, fighting my crow

Why donÂ´t you see?
Why donÂ´t you see me?
Still I feel the hurting silence.

Still I feel your silent.
