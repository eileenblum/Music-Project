IÂ´m trying to find my way in
through this hole in the dark.
IÂ´m trying to find my way out
through this wet, wet, wet...

When the night comes to dawn
wonât you tell me lies, sweet lies?
When the night comes to dawn
wonât you need me to stay alive?

Find my way out, find my way out
through this wet, wet, wet... call in the dark.
Find my way out, find my way out...
And every time I look around
a new light beam hunts me down.
Give me back my life, Shangri La.

And the fear devours me.
And the thirst of flesh boils my blood.
Take me back, take me back, take me back...

Take my hand, let me show you my world.
As the fangs of my monster engorges you all.
Jumping ân jumping from stone to stone.
Why you tell me lies?
Give me back, give me back my life...

Godly youÂ´ll feel
as my fears devours you.
Now is the time.
I am here to take you home.
Take me home.

And the sky will be iluminated by the lightning strikes.
I will dance and youâll follow me to the other side.

Godly I feel
as you fears surrounds me.
Now is the time.
I am here...
Take me home.
