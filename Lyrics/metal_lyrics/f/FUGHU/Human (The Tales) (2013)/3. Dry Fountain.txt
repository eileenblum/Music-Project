The promise was not to leave
before the moonlit closed its eyes.
The killing words not to speak
until the silence kissed the darkness.

Seems like we're never gonna see
what was hidden under the hat.
It's over now, we thank you all
need no approval, don't need no clap.

Cries its liquid sand,
dry fountain waits.
Waits behind the haze,
dry fountain waits.

We shook our hearts and believed
the same blood would ride our veins
forever till the end of life.
Maybe there's some truth in this little death.

Cries its liquid sand,
dry fountain waits.
Waits behind the haze,
dry fountain cries.
Cries its liquid sand,
dry fountain waits.

The sun is crumbling, blinding our souls.
God's gone forever, all faith is lost.
Rivers of fear taking our tears away.
It's hard to fly with broken wings
but we must try as the ground
our feet used to know is not there.

Swearing disillusion.
Dancing on the grave.
Harlequins of sorrow.
Dry fountain in the end.
