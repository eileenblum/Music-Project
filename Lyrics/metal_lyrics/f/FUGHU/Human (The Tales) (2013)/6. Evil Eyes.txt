If the crystal turns to black,
would you find the key?
If the shadows beat the man,
could you find the key?
Don't know who am I before you.
But that ain't me.

How can I show myself vulnerable
when I've just through away the keys after all?
Keep the knife for your back
'cause it's not mine.
Draw the line, cross the line.
I know what it takes.

You seem familiar
but different sounds your voice.
Wonder if Iâve ever heard it before.

Without faith or conviction I raise my head.
Rather hide in my cave from this lucky day.

How can I survive
in this ice cold steady night
behind crystal walls
from that blinding light?

âCause that ain't me.
I can't be me.
I'm not me under your evil eyes.
This is not me.
Gotta stay free.
Can't be me under your evil eyes.

Life and death in your hands, I can't take it.
Take my words, get my signs
'though they're meaningless.
Seems to me what you see is not what you get.
Won't sell my soul
for your nasty breadcrumbs.

You seem familiar
but different is your sight.
Wonder if Iâve ever seen it tonight.

âCause that ain't me.
I'm not me.
I can't be me under your evil eyes.

This is not me.
Please let me be.
I canÂ´t be me under your evil eyes.

If the crystal turns to black,
would you find the key?
If the shadows beat the man,
would you find the key?
Don't know who I am before you.

You seem familiar
but different is your touch.
Wonder if Iâve ever felt it inside.
'cause it's freezing my bones.

I'm not me under your evil eyes.
This is not me.
I can't be me.
Gotta stay free from your evil eyes.
That ainât me.
Canât be me.
I can't be me under your evil eyes.
This is not me.
Please let me be.
I canÂ´t be me under your evil eyes
