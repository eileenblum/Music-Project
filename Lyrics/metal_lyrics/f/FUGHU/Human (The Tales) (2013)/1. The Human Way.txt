Clouds...
Late walking down the streets near the dump.
Dirt, people lying on the floor
craving for something or someone in the garbage.

The child with eyes of an old man is staring at me.
Women as men and men as women
selling themselves for a drop.
Iâm walking round and round looking for some place to buy.
In the meantime, maybe someone is following me.
Someone who knows of the cold lead
in the garbage.

No one could hear the sound of the blast.
IÂ´m falling down on my knees.
On my trembling legs,
I donât feel a thing.
IÂ´m just waiting for...
...waiting for the next beat of my end.

Crying smile, longer nights.
Reaching for the death.
In the labyrinth trace of working kids
you always see around. 
See me falling,
sure you wonât be hurt.
To make some profit is the rule
in this democratic future.

In a flash I could see,
I saw the scene.
Falling down, bleeding me.
I remember the child 
staring at meâ¦
I remember the man...

Crying smile, endless nights.
Will my spirit rise?
of this labyrinth trace of working kids
you always see around.
See me falling,
sure you wonât be hurt.
To make some profit is the game
in this democratic future weâre in.

We need to find a way.
Civilized man, born and raised to kill the man.
We need to find a way.
Spirit of the man, dying in a pray.

Hear us now, highest god!
Free my human race
from this labyrinth trace of working kids
Iâve always lived inside.
Thereâs is no more...
We drained our little world
What makes the man be so cruel with man...
No there is no god,
weâre sinkin in the sand.
What makes the man be so cruel with man...

We could have found a way
Spirit of the man, dying in a pray.
We could have found a way
Spirit of the man, dying in a pray.

We could have found another way.
Spirit of the man, dying in a pray.
We could have found a way
Spirit of the man, dying in a pray.

To make some profit is the game...
Dying in a pray...
