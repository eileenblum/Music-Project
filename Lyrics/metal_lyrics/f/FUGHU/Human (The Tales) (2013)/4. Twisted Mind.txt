One life feeding one life, tell me,
isn't that quiet a sacrifice?
Youâre sick and youâre finally rising
while your self-called healer poisons you.

And your head keeps sailing
through waves of confusion
and you don't care who drawns in it.

I look around, I'm lost again.
Circle traces hunting me.

âCause every time I am next to you...
Every time that I think it through...
Every time I am next to you...
Cannot help myself, cannot help me.

Once I had an angel in my ear
whom told me crystal clear
to stay away from you.
But I opened up every single door.
You sucked my blood,
my soul and spat on me.
Now I try stay away from hatred, from regrets,
from doubts, from every memory

'cause every time I am next to you...
Every time that I think it through...
Every time I am next to you...
Cannot help myself, I simply see red.

Gotta find my way out of the game
played by your twisted mind.
Gotta keep my business miles away
from the realms of your twisted mind.

As long as you survive,
letâs keep the heads rolling on.
Ain't no shame to step on corpses
when on your feet you fall.

Yes, I lived the dream you painted.
A harvester of nightmares
driven by the vortex of your head.

But I found my way out of the game
played by your twisted mind.
Gotta keep my business miles away
from the realms of your twisted mind

Yes I found my way out of the game
played by your twisted mind.
Gotta keep my business miles away
from the reign of your twisted mind.
