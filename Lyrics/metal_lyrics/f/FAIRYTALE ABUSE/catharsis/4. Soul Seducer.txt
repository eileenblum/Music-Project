Mother of the night
Mother of twilight
Raise me as your child
Raise me into life

Sexuality, Sensuality
Teach me what I am
Tell me where I stand

Hi tech world remorse
Hi tech world divorce
I am your pattern
I am your pattern
Upon her pale white naked palms
Hangs a virgin of mahogany steel
Penetrating the worlds of wonder
I scream intentional screams

This is unreal!! Is it the truth??
This is unreal!!

Upon her pale white naked palms
Hangs a virgin of mahogany steel
Penetrating the worlds of wonder
I scream intentional screams

Mother of the night

Raise me as your child
Raise me into life
Sexuality, Sensuality
Teach me what I am

I am your pattern
I am your pattern
