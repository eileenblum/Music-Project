Shown in fear, the heaven is so called near
The black engulfed is here!
...and white, his eyes are made of light!
Evil spread tonight!
His strong and blatant steel
Will tell you what you feel!
Descent into his arms
His Ghouls will give you warmth!

I am thy, a man in mystery
In a world of tragedy
My eyes are burning white
In show a bright delight
My strong and blatant steel
Will tell you what you feel
Descent into my arms
My ghouls will give you warmth

"The face that I saw was utmost terrified
Dreams of which I thought never was believed
Contained in my soul but buried so deep
Lastly evil confirmed: it was.... No... sleep"

May I forever rest in a forest of flames

Shown in fear, the heaven is so called near
The black engulfed is here!
...and white, his eyes are made of light!
Evil spread tonight!
His strong and blatant steel
Will tell you what you feel!
Descent into his arms his Ghouls will give you warmth!
