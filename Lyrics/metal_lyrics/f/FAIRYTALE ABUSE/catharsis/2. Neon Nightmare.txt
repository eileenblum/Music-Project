Bulbs of light arousing in my filter
Subway Light
Day shadows spread like eagle wings
Here comes the night

Behold of my passion,
beware of what you are
Now dusk embraces her
Feels like the first time every night

Feel the power
Of I the almighty
Catharsis
The lust enslaves me
I am a prisoner of sex!

Flavours of desire! Red light zone under siege!

Un human design, wrecked so fine, stab wounds sacred, undefined hatred!
