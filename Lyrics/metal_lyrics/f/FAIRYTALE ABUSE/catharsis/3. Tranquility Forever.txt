I suck life from the worlds
It flows like water into me
This energy
It streams like wind
Through my veins
I am the redeemer of fall
The autumn is my shape
I breathe
The madness that feeds
The night with hate
I travel through dimensions of fear
Embraced by the mist goddess

I shall fill the air with dust this night
Misery the triumph for millenniums
My deepest sufferings

I strike the earth time by time
Murder of millions, life to one
My deepest sufferings

I set forth through the night
Riding my dusk disaster
To fulfil my mysterious quest
And slay the earth
On which I stand

Earth was solemnly swept in wind
As a lightning from the sky
My deepest sufferings

I strike the earth time by time
Murder of millions, life to one
My deepest sufferings
