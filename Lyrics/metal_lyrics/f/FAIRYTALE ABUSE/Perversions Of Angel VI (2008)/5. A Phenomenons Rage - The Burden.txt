Deep in the night beyond the stars and the moons
Last the darkest stars in where the evil looms
A globe engulfed in white by many meters snow
Therein lies the doom that lies dormant deep below

A phenomenon's rage â the burden

A shivering quake that shake the surface of this globe
Magma cracks the earth in bursts of misanthrope
Shingle falls from these vast pinnacles of fate
The core of this world implodes at the malice here awake

The sky as clear and clean as the waters of a pond
Planet earth unaware of the end so close to come
The eagles flying high in the first hours of the sun
The time never told what was to be undone

Burdens stir the reddish sky and specters weep
In tears for festering despondency
Rain and blood decant in a concoction of
Cruelty from the fallen heavens

A creepy wind from a gulf beneath the soil
A scream in fear from where last humans boil
The sky and earth in mutual descent
Dead angels walk our world to see the last extent

The beast that sleeps, before the fire gale

The burden
