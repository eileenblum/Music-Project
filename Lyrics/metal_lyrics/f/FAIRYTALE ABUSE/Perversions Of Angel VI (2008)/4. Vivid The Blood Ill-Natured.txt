"Stand by my side and watch the impiety of all
Fear not, for those who turn, blind they are
Sickening to watch, the way they hide
Sickening to see the way they die"

Vivid the blood ill-natured
Vivid the dark damnation

"Now... now come with me for the last time
To end the day of human sin"
"Yes lord - lead my way to
The shores of bereavement
The cursed must die"

This night became a feast so forceful
Slain one by one by angels of a greater power
A theatre of Bizarre abnormalities
Bleeding plains of dismay and sorrow

His cape was made of humans, a skin draped leather cloth
At staggering pace he drew his knife he murdered half a flock

"Fight by my side and slay them one by one
Feel not, for those who turn, false they are
Sickening to watch, the way they hide
Sickening to see the way they cry"

Vivid the blood ill-natured
Vivid the dark damnation

This night became a feast so forceful
Slain one by one by angels of a greater power
A theatre of Bizarre abnormalities
Bleeding plains of dismay and sorrow

"Now... now come with me for the last time
To end the day of human sin"
"Yes lord - lead my way to
The shores of bereavement
The cursed must die"

"Call your god!"
