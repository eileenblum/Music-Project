Resting briefly 'fore the stroke
Consciousness abhorred,
A bloody ground bears a witness
Ordeal assured

Incidental senseless beating
Stunned and strung up
Mortal death is but a wish
A graceful death it will not be

Senseless slashing into ones flesh
All pain ignored, a
Feast of gore, smell of blood
Tormented whore
Impending apoplexy
Scarred and affected
Mortal death is but a wish
A graceful death it will not

The Angel watches the minors at play
Their terrors exerting all mercy away
Gasping in despair, the victim concedes
Refusal disappears, when one bleeds

Soulless child-like weeping
Poured out honor, guts
Fate of the blameless fatality

Fate has caught up
Fate has caught up, vigorous
Eager with vengeance
Atrocities in great numbers fall upon him
A certainty of consequence

Soulless child-like weeping
Poured out honor, guts
Fate of the blameless fatality

The Angel watches the minors at play
Their terrors exerting all mercy away
Gasping in despair, the victim concedes
Refusal disappears, when one bleeds

The Angel watches the minors at play
Their terrors exerting all mercy away
Gasping in despair, the victim concedes
Refusal disappears, when one bleeds
