At mourners door in the realm of god
Fallen from lips of an angel of truth
Denial of existence
Of the nether world

But as all deceits are bared
This one talked its way to hell
Wind brought the words around
Even through gaps in the ocean floor

For those in pain we lead the light
To lies they have spread
Forsaken ones search no further
The truth we shall abide

At the gate in the outskirts of hell
Reaching the ears of a demon
Denial of existence
Of the netherworld

By the prophets will we swear to thee
By the odium throne bound by tones
By the darkest light that plays at night
By isaiah's heart the diviners hunt has begun
