Your words a weight that strained the burden of time
You passed away in my cacophonous cries
You were all that i loved in life
You with your blood red smile
My fear is back as a craven lord
I beg you to have remorse
To this day i regret my laws
Die by my demons

It was a night that was more like a day
The moon was blond, dented in grey
I took your soul when you slept
No anger, you never wept
Took your innocent heart
Took it into the soulless dark
Where angels feed of the sins of time
Never again for you the sun shall shine

Now rise you shall again
Mistress of the deadening
Show your face to the world at hand
Die by my demons
Demons of my mind progenies of time

Hybrid of the underworld
Spread out your wings my darkest of angels
Though flesh you were
No blood shall rove your veins

Embodiments of sins, though decades of time
Lose your way from the prison of life
For the powers of heaven will be shaken

Father, father, come bless your new born child
Father, father, emperor of the nightfall

He came at dawn where the mysteries dwell
He came with a force found in the deepest pit in hell
Embraced his new creation with a cordial relief
Father, judge of my belief
For ministry of malice
My band of destroying angels
Free your souls through the seventh commandment
Paradigms of primal human fear will see the day

Transition in time we find the light that shows our pain
By society's bleakest rules, we spread our blood again
There will be a day, where no tide is still, no pride is kept
This will be the day of our glorious revivification
