A glance at coronation in cover by the blood
Mist engulf the night as indication of our doom
An audacious move from the serpent of our doom
Behold for what you see, it will never see the day

Even the chosen ones shall perish in their graves
As the two-faced prophets make the human race believe
By words and sway they make the people slaves
Of the under-god that leads the big deceive

A dance with temptations, a fight with your conviction
The eerie thoughts in your mind can find no sleep
As you read the signs, for you had no benediction
You tamper with the malice that lies in your deep

The under-god
Powers and signs
The under-god
Thou shall reign
To see the batteries of war
To hear the scattering screams afar
To smell the stench flesh apart
To drink the blood of a dying heart

"For there shall arise false christ, and false prophets
And shall show great signs and wonders
Insomuch that, if it were possible
They shall deceive the every effectâ
