Curtains are drawn for the lust chimera
The wounded moaning for their last repentance

The unveiling of is newborn carnage
A rosy light upon his face
A midnight play â a shadow drama
The extras are pinned in place

Come for the lust murder theater
Where princesses die and evil feeds
Experience the lust murder theater
Where princesses die and devils eat

Executioner in a robe swept dim
The spectators tensions spurts within
As he clutch his blade of sharpened steel
Ready for the entry light

Curtains are drawn for the lust chimera
The wounded moaning for their last repentance
Walls painted red in blood, splattered patterns
Applauding cries from the wicked mass

Cries from the fallen
Reach for
To eden

"Nemesis â far thou shall reachâ
"Heed my repulsionâ
"Nemesis â far thou shall reachâ
"Heed my repulsion
