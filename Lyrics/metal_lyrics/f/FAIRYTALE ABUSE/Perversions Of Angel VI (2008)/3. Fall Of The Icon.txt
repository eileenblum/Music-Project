With a grasp that stun the earth in a thundering silence
You fall from your voracious throne
White embrace for the modern world defiance
Now in trepidation and terrifyingâ¦ alone

Soul of the humans, a grieving red eye
Reincarnation â you will not see another life
As mesmerizing symphony of tears at your grave
Grief not for you but for those you have enslaved

Prophets of the netherworld
Heed your vocation

Beasts that pass beyond time
Through the seventh dimension

Weeping in repentance
Bleeding by the arches of pain
Falling in repentance
Falling from the throne of horizons

At the 11th moon rise at call by the wolves
A deep red bliss twist in the mangling woods
Here at the dormant blood stained oasis
Resurrection

A war that gash the earth for decades in time
A bloody field
A rage that shatter the souls of the dead
Fall of the icon
