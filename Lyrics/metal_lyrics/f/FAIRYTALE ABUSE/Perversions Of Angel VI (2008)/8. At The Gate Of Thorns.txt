She found herself behind a gate of thorns in a graveyard
It had outlived wars, wind and wonders
Perplexed, stunned, not awake
She believed it was a dream

She held in her hands the 5 black stars that should fill the world with pain
Never thought that it would have come this far, not knowing who she had slain
...Your wings are like dust
...Yielding to your lust

Reversing time in her mind. She was shocked to find
Rivers of blood telling her burden
The sweetness in her eyes spurts blood from her heart
Tearing us apart

She held in her hands the 5 black stars that should fill the world with pain
Never thought that it would have come this far, not knowing who she had slain
...Your wings are like dust
...Yielding to your lust

And crayon marked the walls where she lived
The doors sealed with magical faces of mist
In her home a sculpture of human flesh and bone
This was her throne

Staring into the eyes of darkness and all that was far and beyond
Stunned by the amazing feeling that she had killed not only once
From beauty came sodomy as sudden as death could turn her life around
A glimpse in the sky, a turning red moon, shadows that revealed the past in the tomb
Flickering souls on a wall, insanity screaming

In fury and fire! embrace (the eternal night)!
Speak to me - mother desire!

She was not scared too see all the things she had done
So it became her burden, her twist in life
Satan saw her soul
"Kill the light"

She held in her hands the 5 black stars that should fill the world with pain
Never thought that it would have come this far, not knowing who she had slain
...Your wings are like dust
...Yielding to your lust 

In fury and fire! embrace the eternal night!
Speak to me - mother desire!
