Behind the lurid evil walls in the woods of Cathar
Here she rests the girl dressed in white

She feels the morning wind on her pale face
She feels the gust of dark in her heart
This day is the - the only day to save her soul
This day is the - the only day to save us all

And darkness spellbound her obsessive mind
Here she feeds the girl dressed in white

A tower - fearsome tall - in the night
A tower - dominion - tower of sin
This place is the - the only place to save her soul
This place is the - the only place to save us all

Darkness betrayed her soul again
Darkness enslaved her soul again

She feels the morning wind on her pale face
She feels the gust of dark in her heart
This day is the - the only day to save her soul
This day is the - the only day to save us all
