"I wash my cold hand in your blood
I smell the gust from your heart
I am the blood filling your veins
I am you

I bow my head - I am your slave
In your mind - engraved behind
I am yours to control
I am you"

And he saw nothing but soulless bodies surrounding him
Ensnaring his new identity as the demon he had become
"Unfold your nightmare as you unfolded your curse on me"
He yelled out trough the woods of Catharsis

The misery tree - Stigma divine

Unfold your anger goddess of mine
I am here by the misery tree
Endlessly devoured to stigmata mine
Blessed be your curse - Stigma divine

Marvelous grave oaks but dark as ghouls in hell
You bow your head waiting for your life to turn gray
Fury and anger out spell the words of time
Turn - turn - turn him free

The misery tree - Stigma divine

A deep gray horizon erupts deep behind
The trees are gates to the worlds beyond
Compel your soul to the words heavenly
From oaks voiceless words but still divine

Unfold your anger goddess of mine
I am here by the misery tree
Endlessly devoured to stigmata mine
Blessed be your curse - Stigma divine
