Hold me tight tonight
Kiss me with your bleeding lips
Entangle me in your web of eternity
I want to be free, imposed to life endlessly
Goddess suck my mortality

A deep dark still on the surface of nothing
Black when the water turned to blood

I feel your cold hands in my hands breathe in the cold
Our destiny is sealed - forever we rule
You my eternal love of lust and life
We shall enter darkness now

I drink the water from the still divine
Black when the water turned to blood

By the vampire still

They sat by the still in utter darkness
Only surrounded by entangled oak trees
She pressed her white teeth into his innocent skin
Seconds after he hungered for the human blood
"Oh Lord! What has happened to me?
Oh Lord! It feels so good!
Am I a monster or a dream?
I feel like killing!"

"Your flesh is blessed by the hands of hell
Black as the water turns to blood
I know it is life endlessly
Black as the water turns to blood

Oh Lord!"
