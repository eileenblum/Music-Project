"I can't stand this emotional distress - soul disorder
My self control used to ignore my mistakes - filtering pain"

"I betrayed you, I faked you - I want to be hollow and empty
I fear nothing but life now
My ignorance destroys you but still I am
I want to crush my bones, to burn my soul"

This must be the end
This must be the end of subject I
This must be the end

She held his head in her arms - staring in his eyes
Telling him she can not love
But just as she spoke the winds changed
And the night felt brighter

This must be the end
This must be the end of subject I
This must be the end
