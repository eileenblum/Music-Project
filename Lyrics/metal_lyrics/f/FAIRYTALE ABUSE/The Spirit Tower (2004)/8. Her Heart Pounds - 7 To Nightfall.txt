"I see the dawn arise in a glimpse of a new time
I feel despair of what I see
For Stigma has seen your sins - sins she hated more than life
A white rose in the sky for the devils whore - it is time to die"

Staring at the oracle - her face engulfed in fear
Her eyes deeply terrorized - her skin as pale as death
Realizing the end to come
Demise of Sindarilla the vampire whore

Sky-high parade in a sinful design - Winged beings shapes without form
The horizon screams - a night full of dreams - an overcast sinful storm
A legion of hooded sinners - hunters for vampire blood
Sent to war at seven to nightfall

She held her hands into the sky that bleeds that night
Screaming out - her soul in pain
She was torn asunder by the god that never sleeps
Rest in peace - Sindarilla has deceased

Suddenly spoken words from a dimension beyond
The never spoken words trembled the ground
"You committed the only sin
You dared to care! The sin to love!"

Sky-high parade in a sinful design - Winged beings shapes without form
The horizon screams - a night full of dreams - an overcast sinful storm
A legion of hooded sinners - hunters for vampire blood
Sent to war at seven to nightfall
