Upon the cross in the sacred hall of instant echoes
A scream unfolds through the night
Blasphemic prose from a hidden world
Effigies shiver in fear

Reflections from the moon
Repel the motions of her evil

Now she awakens - the goddess of depression and sin
Her eternal castigation will find - all souls alive

The night furious as a thunderstorm
Stars embittered by the sight
Spirits dismayed in anguish
Rise of Stigma the almighty

Reflections from the moon
Repel the motions of her evil

Innocent souls knotted together
In a cluster of flesh and blood
Enslaved to eternal carnal imprisonment
Of lust and love in agony

Now she awakens - the goddess of depression and sin
Her eternal castigation will find - all souls alive

Day turns to night, bloom to blood
Love is pain and pain is love
Life on earth is life in hell

Day to night, bloom to blood
Love is pain and pain is love
Life on earth is life in hell
And agony shall be!
