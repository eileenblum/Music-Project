Can you imagine we're lovers?
And we've fallen asleep again?
Like a window into someone's
Longing that never ends

Watch it now as it comes through the station
Through every life I've known
I'll take a one-way ticket man,
To a new elevation
I ride the last train home, the last train home

On the way I discover
What I never could understand
Like a child I'm uncovering my worth
In a wonderland

Watch it now as it comes through the station
Through every life I've known
I'll take a one-way ticket man,
To a new elevation
I ride the last train home, the last train home

Through the mist you check your list
Of all the past upon you
Blow a kiss you're not remiss
To throw your love away
While I'm waiting for the day

Heaven's hallowed hunkered heart
Is hoping for a halo
Princess plays her perfect part
And pines for yesterday
While I'm waiting for the day

Stepping on the cold cement
The doors are slowly opening
Waving back, you leave alone
Don't be sad you're going home
Stepping back, you leave alone
Don't be sad you're going home
You're going home
Though the water has covered you
You'll stand and begin again
This is your genesis
Your train to Jerusalem

Watch it nowâ¦
