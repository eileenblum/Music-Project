Give myself away
Freely dis-associate
Climb up mountains of sand
There to find there's holes in my hands

I dream the day
In nights in the fray

Dawn comes gripping tight
Bathed in secret delight

I dream the day
In nights in the fray

I fade away
Into my passion
Nights in the fray
Forever askingâ¦ more

I wish you lied to me
Anything but this reality
Still life of clay
From nights in the fray

I fade away
Into my passion
Nights in the fray
Forever askingâ¦ more

Poised on a hill
Will you die from your suffering?
Your were born into lies
Deep as rain
There's a kiss
Undespised
And your love is a wish
Let it fly while we swim in the dark

I dream the day
In nights in the fray

I fade away
Into my passion
Nights in the fray
Forever askingâ¦ more
