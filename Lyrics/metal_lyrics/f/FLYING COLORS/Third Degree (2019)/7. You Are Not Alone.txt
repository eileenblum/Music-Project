Hurricane impossible
Wake up wading our
When you just want to understand

Drifting through the contracts
Weeping in the fields
The Currents stealing all the past

Through the raging water
In the rain of suffering, we're
In this mess together
Your are not alone
Your are not alone

Destruction is the offering
Wall turn into waste
And there aren't words that can be found

Through the raging water
In the rain of suffering, we're
In this mess together
Your are not alone
Your are not alone

When the ocean leaves you in the desert
Your are not alone
Bury the past and survive
Hold on to what never dies

Through the raging water
In the rain of suffering, we're
Through the raging water
In the rain of suffering, we're
In this mess together
Your are not alone
Your are not alone
