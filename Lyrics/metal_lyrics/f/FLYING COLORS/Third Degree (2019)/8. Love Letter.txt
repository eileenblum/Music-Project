So you say you're done with me
An nothing's workin' anymore
Won't you stop and walk with me
Instead of walkin' out the door

We could end our story here right now
It's hard to write
When our house is burnin' down

Every time you start to cry
Or say goodbye
It's you and I
'Cuz your are my love letter
Every tear becomes a line
And I write yours as you write mine
Our words align, love letter

It's been rough, you've had enough
I've driven you to memories
Moments came but not enough
To counterweight the drudgery

Waiting for new chapters to appear
The words will come
If we don't end it here

Every time you start to cry
Or say goodbye
It's you and I
'Cuz your are my love letter
Every tear becomes a line
And I write yours as you write mine
Our words align, love letter

There's pages that we can't erase
Phrases that seem out of place
But somehow it will make sense againâ¦
There's poetry in every scar
Becoming part of who we are
Your letter's still what I want to send

Every time you start to cry
Or say goodbye
It's you and I
'Cuz your are my love letter
Every tear becomes a line
And I write yours as you write mine
Our words align, love letter
