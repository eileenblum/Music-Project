I've hung my mind round every door
Prison silence, poised for war
I lost my way the day you left
And you don't care if I'm alive or dead,
Do ya

I thought I knew, but now I know
We find our love deep in the undertow
We're out to sea like everyone
You were my anchor
That ya cut the rope on

I'm sinking with loss inside
And I cannot escape the great divide
As we drift, through the tide
When your heart cannot belong to anyone
The wreckage I've become

Drownin' in gin, and acid sour
You reach your no go shallow final hour
I can't let go
I can't hold on
You cut me to the quick, girl
And I'm goin' downâ¦

I'm sinking with loss inside
And I cannot escape the great divide
As we drift, through the tide
When your heart cannot belong to anyone
The wreckage I've become

I'm sinking with loss inside
And I cannot escape the great divide
As we die, in the tide
When your heart cannot belong to anyone
The wreckage I've become
Faded and undone
Saved by anyone
After loss
