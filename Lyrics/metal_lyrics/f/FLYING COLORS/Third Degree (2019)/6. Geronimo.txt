Night the auburn sky
The stars we see burned up long ago
I have seen the place
We used to know but now it's just a show

All the world's ablaze a maze of chains
We're lost in the sun - Lost in the sun

Owned and aimless - Can I change it ?
Make my break and wake up this silent heart

It's in the wake of the impossible
Out on the edge of unattainable
Enter the night and cry Geronimo

Bite down on the blade
Let's blame it all on our sordid part
Nothing is ok, why even try
Live your, die fast

All these lonely days this maze of chains
We're lost in the sun - Lost in the sun

Owned and aimless - can I change it?
Make by break and wake up this silent heart

It's in the wake of the impossible
Out on the edge of unattainable
Enter the night and cry Geronimo

Look at the night sky
We'll never make it
Impersonal and vast
Without our understanding
We're like a razor
We're cutting through forever
Or maybe nothing
If that's our understanding

Night sky - Don't lie
We cry - To lose the night forever

Night sky - Raise high
Our solemn cry - For one more try

It's in the wake of the impossibleâ¦
