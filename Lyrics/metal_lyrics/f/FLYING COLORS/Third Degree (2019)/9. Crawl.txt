We were born under blood built skies
Black and blue in the wraith of the night

Frat gets forced in our tired eyes
Spoon fed war machine
As you walk in this alone
And you come in our own

Stars are fallin' down on you
Stars are fallin' down on you
And it takes you away

Life is tearing up the road
In the season of the torch
All you people come and look upon
The child behind the door
That always longs for more

Stars are fallin' down on you
Stars are fallin' down on you
And it takes you away

You're facing head on into the wind
'N' soon you'll find your way
On your knees to begin
There's beauty found in the fall
When we learn to crawl
Learn to crawl

Born into the gilded cage
Tied in ribbons and awards
It cam upon us deep as frost
No one saw, but we were warned
Never knowing, trapped and torn

You're facing head on into the windâ¦

You with your broken heart
There's a rise for your requiem
Come down and crawl again and be born

Come down and crawl again and be born

Stars are fallin' down on you
Stars are fallin' down on you
And it takes you away

The higher way is down
There is a deeper life that's yet to be found
More than what we have knownâ¦

You're facing head on into the windâ¦
