In the wasted wealth of earth
Losing our courage
Where has all the lust of life gone?
Like the sap out of a birch
Cut to discourage
But has someone left the light on?

Is there none to speak or stand?
Where are our fathers?
They left us long ago now

Wasting so much life
The scars they leave behind
But that's not who we are
You're not far

Cadence you're losing time again
You've been left on your own
Cadence dance through the embers and
Every light becomes your start
Cadence it's not far away

In the distance there's a wake
Life giving fortune

There's a voice that leads the way now
The mosaic to create
King or an orphan
As we walk we'll ding our way out

Wasting so much life
The wounds from deep inside
Carving who we are
You're not far

Cadence you're losing time again
You've been left on your own
Cadence dance through the embers and
Every light becomes your start
Cadence it's not far away

Wasting so much life
The wounds from deep inside
Carving who we are
You're not far

Cadence you're losing time againâ¦
