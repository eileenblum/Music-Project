At the end
Of the road
Where the sea
Meets the sky
All we know
We'll be leading to one
While the day
Wears you down

And you dance 
Without sun 
Kiss the ground 
Well be reaching for

One love forever
One all-consuming light to find
One love forever 
Leading me home

At the end
Of the road
Where the silence
Gets loud
In your soul
Were surrounded by

One love forever
One all-consuming light to find
One love forever
One chance creates your life
One love forever
For one consuming hole inside
One love forever

Son of dark and light
Awaiting
I'm laying him down like a centipede
Here's a flash of light
Cascading
Like an ocean it drowns my enemy

One love for all time 
Is calling
Our eyes contain eternity

It's written on our souls 
It must be
And still this love goes on...

One love forever
One all-consuming light to find
One love forever
One chance creates your life
One love forever
For one consuming hole inside
One love forever 
Leading me home

One love forever 
One love forever 
One love forever 
One love 'til forever
