Remember when we were young
Like Eden was in innocence
No looking through the camera lens
And every moment was
A living lightning afterglow 
A constant river's overflow

And somewhere in the back of your mind 
Yours was more important than mine

Then you went on your way 
Just being who you couldn't be 
Without our love's intensity 
I'll never go halfway
For me it's all or everything 
There's just no living in between

And somewhere in the back of my mind 
I can't seem to leave you behind

Baby don't worry 'bout this intensity
It's just the fury of my love
Things aren't what they seem to be
It's just what you mean to me 
And it's just the fury of my love

Can we start over now?
A place the past has never looked
A pardon closing every book
Love covers all our doubts
Unhindered by the icy shell
That's grown around your heart so well 

Somewhere in the back of your mind 
I'm the one you're looking to find

Baby don't worry 'bout this intensity
It's just the fury of my love 
Things aren't what they seem to be 
It's just what you mean to me 
It's just the fury of my love

I hope you don't think I'm scary 
Drowning in the pain
I hope you can recognize that 
Your love means everything

Baby don't worry 'bout this intensity 
It's just the fury of my love 
Things aren't what they seem to be 
It's just what you mean to me 
It's just the fury of my love

My love 
My love 
My love 
My love
