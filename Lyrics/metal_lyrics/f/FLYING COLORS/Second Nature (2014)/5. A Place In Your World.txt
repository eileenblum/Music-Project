Would you like to see within my heart? 
Would you like to be there when I fall apart? 
The sun might scorch my eyes
But no-one ever cries a tear for me

Is there nothing more that I can stand?
I feel so displaced now I'm the lonely man
But look into my eyes
And maybe you can see what's in my heart

Turn away
(Don't turn away) 
Don't turn away 
(Don't turn away) 
I'm reaching out

Is there a place in your world? 
Is there a place in your world?
Is there a place in your world for me?

What is there to do but try again?
Stuck in your solitude you won't find life again 
But if you let this love
Rule you'll go where fools come rushing in

Take me down
(You take me down)
Find the flow 
(Find the flow) 
I still don't know 
(I still don't know)

Is there a place in your world?
Is there a place in your world?
Is there a place in your world for me?
I want a place in your world
I want a place in your world
Is there a place in your world for me?

Help me if you can
I'm back where I began
Singing I surrender 
I surrender
Tearing all the walls away
I'm giving you a place

Singing I surrender 
I surrender 
I'll give it all!

Turn away
(Don't turn away)	
Don't turn away 
(Don't turn away) 
I'm reaching out

Is there a place in your world?
Is there a place in your world?
Is there a place in your world for me?
I want a place in your world
I want a place in your world
Is there a place in your world for me?

I'm gonna run 
I'm gonna run 
I'm gonna run 
I'm gonna run
