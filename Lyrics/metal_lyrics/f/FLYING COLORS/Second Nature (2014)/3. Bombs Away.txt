Stuck in the heavy 
Trapped in the distance 
Feelin' so, oh, oh wrong

Made up of choices 
And too many voices 
Now it's all, all, all gone

Bombs away 
Mountains are falling 
Born in the thunder sky

Run by my instincts
I'm high on the freeway
And I'm scared I'll come down

Snackin' on Cheeze Whiz 
Lost in the business 
But I'd love to be found

Bombs away 
Mountains are falling 
Born in the thunder sky

I need you like I need a name 
I've given up on everything 
I'll give the rest of me to get to you 
I need to find a way beyond 
This life that I've just painted on 
I'll give the rest of me to get to you

I need you like I need a name 
I've given up on everything 
I'll give the rest of me to get to you 
I need to find a way beyond 
This life that I've just painted on 
I'll give the rest of me to get to you
