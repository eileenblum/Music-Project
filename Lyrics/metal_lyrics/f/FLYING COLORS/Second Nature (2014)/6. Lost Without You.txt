Wake up Monday morning pessimistic in my head
And everyday I'm waiting 'til I can go back to bed
But you're smilin'
In your window hide away
I'm tryin'
Just to stay alive another day

'Cause I'm lost
(Cause I'm lost)
Yes, I 'm lost
(Yes, I'm lost)
Without you

Every Thursday I go out and have a laugh or two
And everyone I'm with I can't help wishing they were you
It's old now
Abandoned, far away
So cold now
I'm still bringing flowers to the grave

Yeah, I'm lost
('Cause I'm lost)
Without you
(Without you)

And I'm finding all things wanting
'Cause all I want is you
Yeah, I'm lost
(Yeah, I'm lost)
Without you

Only time will help you now
Lizard kings to take you down
I'm still waiting for the sun, yeah
Living somewhere back in time
There's no ladder worth the climb
Gladly trade it all for love

Got no resolution
Just spinning in the blues
I'm finding all things wanting
For all I want is you

'Cause I'm lost
Without you

Yeah, I'm lost
(Yeah, I'm lost)
Without you
(Without you)

Without you...
