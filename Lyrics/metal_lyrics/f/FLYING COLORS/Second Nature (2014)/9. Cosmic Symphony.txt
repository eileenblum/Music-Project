[I. Still Life Of The World]

The moon is stained with midnight tears of fortune
Tainted pastures, scarecrows point to no one
My favorite cigarette plays its funeral song

A still life of the world
Shrinking violet wounded by her mother
Old men sleep while porcelain screams take over
And the wolf disguises her undying lover

A still life of the world
A still life of the world

[II. Searching For The Air]

I took in the Sunrise and I tried to save it
I looked through my own eyes and I thought I've made it
I thought I could reach the sky
but I'm stuck here on the ground

I wanted to drink wine from the captain's table
I saw in my mind's eye but my hands weren't able
Searchin' for the air but it all keeps comin' down, down,
comin' down
I'm searchin' for the air but I'm stuck here on the ground,
on the ground, on the ground now

Searchin' for the air but I'm stuck here on the ground now
Searchin' for the air
Searchin' for the air
Searchin' for the air

[III. Pound For Pound]

I'm neither more, I'm neither less
And I'm not trying to take some test
And I'm not trying prove myself
And I'm hot trying to run away...away from you

In all these years I've seen the changes take place
Like the ice melting away
Like the sun bringing the morning
And I know...it was all for you

And when I get to walk the streets
Without this burden on my feet
I know I've been called home
These shoes won't be my own to fill
When I see the past beneath
My heavy heart is finally free

I'm searchin' for the air
Searchin' for the air
But I have found
It's pound for pound

Underneath this cosmic symphony
Underneath this pain, this happiness
And underneath the river's stream...a will to live

I've given love, I've given hate
I've given peace and I've made a war
And I've been scarred by words and swords
But here I am, the will to live

And when I get to walk these streets
Without a burden on these feet
I'll know I've been called home
This place will be my own again
When I feel the past beneath
My heavy heart is finally free

I'm searchin' for the air
Searchin' for the air
But I have found
It's pound for pound
