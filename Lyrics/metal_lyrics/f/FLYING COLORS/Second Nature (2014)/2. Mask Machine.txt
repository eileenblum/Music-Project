Rows and rows of aisles for miles 
And intercoms with screens that smile 
And angry hands continue shaking
A hole as large as humankind 
With no redeeming thing to buy 
Calls to every soul worth saving
Welcome to the mask machine 
Be someone else forever
We see the labels in my head 
We're beautiful, our boss is dead T
here's nothing like an ego feeding

And when I get what I deserve 
With love for sale and gold for dirt 
I'll worship every fleeting aching

Welcome to the mask machine
Be someone else forever 
Make me extra small 
Beautiful and tall
Be anyone else forever

Fill my void
I want too much

Peel the layers one by one
A mask beneath a mask, undone 
To shine the light on real and wild 
And turn the world from dead to child

When I get what I deserve
With love for sale and gold for dirt 
HI worship every fleeting aching

Welcome to the mask machine 
You can be someone else forever 
Make me extra small
Beautiful and tall
Be anyone else forever
