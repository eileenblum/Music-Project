Born into the wind
It makes its way
To the lost and the hollow
Life begins again
Sometimes we lead
Sometimes we follow
Where we do not know
No sky can hold
No end, no border
The wind will fill the sails
And push you through to peaceful harbor

Love, like Heaven's wind
No eye can see
How it blows in the darkness
Fear may freeze our steps
Loss and regret, every scar turning scarlet
Help to set your course
Through sightless days and violent waters
Love will fill your sails
And bring you through, to peaceful harbor

Chase this rising wind
Anchor released
No want of landing
All in deep despair
Come feel the air
In its full finale
And yes, the chase is on
I'll look beyond
With the bedlam behind me
And I embrace the sky
My soul will cry
May your wind ever find me
