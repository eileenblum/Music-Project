Red knights coming to Rome
Blood in the streets
Kingdoms die overthrown
Lay down your lives or be slaves to a fool
When it all falls down

Freedom stolen in sight
Do you love destruction or do you want life?
He who is faithful from ashes will rise
When it all falls down

Wake up, chosen ones
Stand up, fight for love
Where lies your treasure
So shall you become
When it all falls down

Wake up, chosen ones
Stand up, fight for love
Where lies your treasure
So shall you become
When it all falls down

Wake up, chosen ones
Stand up, fight for love
Where lies your treasure
So shall you become
When it all falls down
