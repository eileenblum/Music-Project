Don't want to fight about the money we spent
About the things that we did
About you leaving all the lights on

Don't want to talk about the singer again
And all notes that he missed
'Cause he always sings the wrong ones

And I'm sleeping in a similar state
But for this I swore I'd wake

Love is what I'm waiting for
Come and then I'll start a war
Love will change what you're waiting for
Love is what I'm waiting for

And everyone cheers for the winners that win
And every giver who gives
While all the losers sing the fight song

And everyone sits on the edge of their seat
While the contenders compete
And I'm still waiting for the right one

Love is what I'm waiting for
Come and then I'll start a war
Love will change what you're waiting for
Love is what I'm waiting for

There'll come a time
A drop of rain that always knew
It would fall into the sea of blue
And cause the sun to shine
Around the bend with lightnin' eyes
They will light your heart on fire again

Love is what I'm waiting for
Come and then I'll start a war
Love will change what you're waiting for
Love is what I'm waiting for

Hey, give it out, give it up, get it in
Hey, give it out, give it up, get it in

Love is what I'm waiting for
Come and then we'll end the war
Love will change what you're waiting for
Love is what I'm waiting for
