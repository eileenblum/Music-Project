Safe in my arms
Sleeps the daughter of light
In her calm spring-like smile
Dreaming skies in her eyes
But she died

Fall tears from the clouds
Cold trees in the dark,
So cold inside

Lady in white
To your heart now I cry
Let me weep at the sky
You're the only one who can find
One gift for her life
Please answer, I beg, my chant...

My light flies away,
So far away
My hope fades
As wintersuns at dusk
