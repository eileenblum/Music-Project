Shine no suns in the morning
A storm in silence is crying
For the daughter of light
For her now, he's rising into the sky his steel
Out for vengeance and fight

Ride a warrior alone
For war his heart pounds
Like tempestes of iron and snow
Awakening his last strength for one last ride
Then storms will die

Gone is your light...
Such is the warrior's time!

Ride alone, master of fight!
Down from the North
Feel the force of the rising warcry
And the fog will cover all the stars
Into the dark when the blizzard awakes...
...it's war!

Burns her death in your eyes
No more your power will storm
This cold land with no life
With blind rage at your side
You'll leave behind all wars to strive

Gone will be might...
Now hail the warrior's time!

Ride alone, Master of Fight!
Down from the North
Feel the force of the rising warcry
And the fog will cover all the stars
Into the dark when the blizzard awakes...
...it's war!

All hail the last war clouds!

Ride alone, Master of Fight!
Down from the North
Feel the force of the rising warcry
And the fog will cover all the stars
Into the dark when the blizzard awakes...
....it's war!
