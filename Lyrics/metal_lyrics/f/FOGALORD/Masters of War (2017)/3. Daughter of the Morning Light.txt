She was born of the brightest light
Away, a timeless fading night
Gold hair, green-morning eyes
With her spring-like voice
She had early sung in joy

She grew up, a girl full of life
In silver woods, enchanting skies
But sorrow crept in disguise
And darkness filled her smile

Hear the tale of the child who walked through the shadow
As she raised her chant on the absence of light
Let her sadness turn hope to storms in the oceans
May the gray in her songs be remembered in time,
Out of sight

Joyful times had soon passed by
Turning rays of life to fight
And nightmares painted in her eyes,
Battles filled her heart
Bringing the war inside

Hear the tale of the child who walked through the shadow
As she raised her chant on the absence of light
Let her sadness turn hope to storms in the oceans
May the gray in her songs be remembered in time

Silence, shadows, sorrow
Falling as black rain in the night
Silence, shadows, and dark clouds
Cover me and let me fight for her light

She can't forget the scars
Hiding from the mirror,
Nothing shones at all,
Leaves are falling down with no signs
Of the neverending sadness inside
Her heart was drawn
With colors of autumn
And by seas by storm
It pounds secret thorns

Hear the tale of the child who walked through the shadow
As she raised her chant on the absence of light
Let her sadness turn hope to storms in the oceans
May the gray in her songs be remembered in time
Out of sight...
