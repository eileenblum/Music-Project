The snow will keep on falling
On mountains in the wild
The coldness of the wintersun
Painted icy marks

Through victories in battle
And chapters full of life
The story of the Warmasters
Suddenly went dark

The warrior lost his magic
In blinding dark, alone
The daughter of the morning light
Pure as snow is gone

Her chant of spring is soundless
It can't be heard, no more
The memories of white brightness
Left in fear his world

When darkness comes down
As tears on the ground
The storms of a thousand fairy tales
Falls with no sounds

When brightness has died...
Is gone out of sight
We all hear this silent fairy tale
In absence of light

The daughter fell in silence
No tears upon her eyes
For treason passed by
To the clouds that rule the sky

In search of her he wandered
Until the end of the world
No solance for her death
He could find forevermore

When darkness comes down
As tears on the ground
The storms of a thousand fairy tales
Fall with no sound

When brightness has died...
Is gone out of sight
We all hear the silent fairy tales
In absence of light

When darkness comes down
As tears on the ground
The storms of a thousand fairy tales
Falls with no sounds

When brightness has died...
Is gone out of sight
We silently cry for fairy tales
In absence of light
