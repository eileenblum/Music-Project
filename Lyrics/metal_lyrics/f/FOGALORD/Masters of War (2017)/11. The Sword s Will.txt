Skies of an epic immortal life seal
Marked the gift in a timeless snow landscape
So revealed were the secreds of magic and steel
In the end of the Warmaster's tale

Rise for your will
Be the Sword of the Foglord forever
Rise! ...from the dark you will shine,
You're the one
And the fate of the Masters of War

Harsh was the crossroads that lies on her life
As the words of the White Lady's message
"...to return as the goddess of light in the sky
Or to live in the dark of the gates..."

Rise for your will
Until the end with the Forglord forever
Rise! ...from the dark you will shine,
You're the one
And the fate of the Masters of War....

Night falls, fall darkness and cold
The Masters' fates unite
When fog calls the gates seal their walls
A silent storm arises
It's the sign!
...the time has come alive
For the Sword's will!

"Out of the battlefield I'll follow you again,
Walking down the path that lead us to the the end"
Until the world will burn
Her Warmaster's will be done!

Will is the secret of magic and might
All the strenth in your heart no one shall quell
For your sake a new kingdom of fog and ice-skies
Will be born as the legend will tell

Rise for your will
Be the heart of the Forglord forever
Rise! ...live again as a light in the dark
Hear the scream of the thunder inside!

Night falls, fall darkness and cold
The Masters' fates unite
When fall calls the gates seal their walls
A silent storm arises
It's the sign!
...the time has come alive
For the Sword's will!
