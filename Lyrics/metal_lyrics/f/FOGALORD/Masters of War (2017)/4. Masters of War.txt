They met in a battle one day with no sun
The fog spread its wings on the sky
The time it was right for the heroes to fight
Each other with hammers and might

See the Masters raging for the steel as one
Hear their warcries on the battlefield
Let their deeds be sacred

The masters of war clashed deciding who's right
But destiny changed all their lives
The steel in their weapons refused to fight
And made them unbreakably tied

See the Masters raging for the steel as one
Hear their warcries on the battlefield
Let their deeds be sacred

Northern fog... everywhere!

From the stormy highest mountains
To the bloody fields of fire
They will swear their oath on high
"Into the battlefield I'll follow you again
'Til the last drop of my blood will wash the land..."
Until the world will destroy the world at end
Glory hails the Masters!

(Voices of the Gods of Light)
"Hear my call and bless the signs...."
She will rise as spring grapevine

(Voices of the Ancestors)
"Ride my son and fear no one..."
He, as winter ivy, will rise

Light was a miracle within a world of night
Their blood meant life, their will meant might
And sealing swords into the sky
Vows they made with steel
Into new wars they'll ride...
And kill!

See the Masters raging for the steel as one
Hear their warcries on the battlefield
Let their deeds be sacred

Northern fog... everywhere!

From the stormy highest mountains
To the bloody fields of fire
They will swear their oath on high
"Into the battlefield I'll follow you again
'Til the last drop of blood will wash the land..."
Until the world will destroy the world at the end
Glory hails the masters.
