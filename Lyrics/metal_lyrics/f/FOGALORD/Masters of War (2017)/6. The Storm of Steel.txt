Fog dimmed the sky
Heavy snow was falling fast
White ran the cold rivers
Ice was on the land

United strong heroes
They marched as one
Grey were their seals
Colder than their metal blade
They trust in steel

Through lakes of blood
Fighting with swords in hands
The Masters rode shining
Northern suns in them

Unleash the storm!
Hammers rule loud this war!
Your scream called for vengeance
Foes of ye were seen no more

It's time! The war is glory
Kill with lust for blood inside!
Steel legends rise!

Winter's blood inside
Endless wars they will storm
With the fog by their side
Through the mist he was born
Through her power the Foglord
Will return to fight
With a heart made of ice,
A sword made of light...
In the end they will raise
The storm of steel!

And so they fought
Leading the grey army's might
At their command
Legions of immortal knights

Their banner flew
Higher than tempest clouds
And on their shields
Rose up trees and hawks in red and white

It's time! The war is glory
Kill with lust for blood inside!
Steel legends rise

Winter's blood inside
Endless wars they will storm
With the fog by their side
Through the mist he was born
Through her power the Foglord
Will return to fight
With a heart made of ice,
And a sword made of light
In the end they'll arise...

The storm of steel was their soul
The storm of steel inflamed their will
The storm of steel was their right
The storm of steel led their weapons into the fight

Winter's blood inside
Endless wars they will storm
With the fog by their side
Through the mist he was born
Through her power the Foglord
Will return to fight
With a heart made of ice
A sword made of light...
In the end they will raise the storm of steel!
