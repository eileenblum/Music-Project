Rise!

From out of nowhere he will rise
Through the mist of time he was born
When there was no legend:
"One day he will storm
The power in this world"
Strong as iron he grew up and

By ice and snow
His soul was forged
Of storms and steel
His heart was pounding

Fight!
Neverending wars he'll fight
And falling with the fog by his side
He'll become the legend:
"One day he'll destroy
The fire in this world"
In his eyes the signs of winter

By ice and snow
His soul was forged
Of storms and steel
His heart was pounding

As cold as the winter
Strike like a god of war
Fight 'til the end of time
As white as the wind that
Blows on a winter night... rise!

A legend is flying
A tale is rising through the mist of time
A neverending force is striking
Like a tempest of steel and ice he'll ride away
With a silent storm inside, one day

Ice... Snow... Storms... Steel... Rising!
By ice and snow his soul was forged
He's rising through the mist of time!

Come vento all'orizzonte
La tempesta raccontava
La leggenda della morte
E della gloria di una spada

Tra pianure e monti
Acciaio e neve incontrerai
Storia senza tempo
E la nebbia dominera

...in his eyes the signs of winter!

By ice and snow
His soul was forged
Of storms and steel
His heart was pounding

As cold as the winter
Strike like a god of war
Fight 'til the end of time
As white as the wind that
Blows on a winter night... rise!

A legend is flying
A tale is rising through the mist of time
A neverending force is striking
Like a tempest of steel and ice he'll ride away
With a silent storm inside
One day!
