my ears they bleed thoughts full of pain and agony reveal oh god what disturbs me from night's rest my end is near I lay petrified in fear it fills my lungs with angst something nocturnal unholy a choking ecstasy intestines unfolding bile spews lungs collapse in mystery my world stops turning
darkness speak to me why me your chosen light fades to black filthy dog i am your master your end you are my feast i hunger for the flesh of man through your world i've lurked about always near open your eyes and discover all that you fear death stands before you collector of souls a blackness falls upon me i cannot breathe frozen i lay bare drowning in the horror of all that lays unseen a new world approaches a tangible disease so insidious the ways of thee man and beast alike unworthy I'll take your soul with ease i gladly cast you from this world this fate you chose i'll show you pain and horror that you've never known body raped of all sanctity the roads are paved with them they preach of wisdom honor and greed through eyes i inhale the insidious falesy my body lacking the strength to resist the will to be free i drown here alone in painful agony
hell surrounds I exhale mortality
