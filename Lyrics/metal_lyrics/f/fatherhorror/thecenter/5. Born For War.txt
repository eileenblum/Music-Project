they say we're traitors to faith what truth do they know fools bring this slaughter to me eradicate their ways crush them with distain my hate growing boiling my veins rise now reborn under me slaves to a god in flesh destorying humanity decieved by lies demise is so near they preach of christ and peace as if he were here now we flood the streets with fear go forth and murder all that you see no god no mortal shall deny this from me rape their women their children slaughter their weak a new age has begun it's their heads that i seek see the signs know that i'm the way
ill leave their cities riddled with decay you'll hear their bones crush from our weight soldiers march freedom is an illusion you belong to me this world shall bathe in flames no where left to flee my malice unmatched my will is law and by your hands my fire shall enslave them all burn them alive seal their demise tear them limb from limb my war now begins born for war
