For too long ive waited and watched the sphere shall be clensed of your filth know that the center is here to enter your minds consuming your hearts devour your fear fallen from the earth into a pit i lye in wait fear me i am the center of all that you feel believe it you've known i am the center your lives are mine surrender prepare to die humanity a disease on my back a plague which i intend to cleanse you are weak meaningless to me I'll take your life and swallow you whole i am the demon eater of flies shead your tears you're spared not human stench suffocates me i wont stop til there's nothing left risen again free again kill bow to me cry my name children die bravery exposed mother's tears shower my feet your god lacks the strength to be real I've come to taste his mortal mistake
your bodies quinch my thirst for flesh revenge I want you've soiled my home a sphere bathed in living disease come now I will set you free
