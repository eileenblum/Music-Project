Awake a man quiet in repose who dwells in carrion rotten flesh and bone the night is mine wielding bane as I desire within lies a vex which god and man alike detest darkness strikes full moon arise unleash the horror within the curse demands of me skin melts and begins to fall from their fingertips a crowd gathers to see their faces fade away nothing but rage and hunger left in me horrifier mortal guts bursting from my skin the beast crawls within transforming my body I refuse to fight it off it becomes a part of me piercing teeth human flesh is no longer what weakens me this disease gives me a hunger i have never felt before wandering again without hope my beast follows snarling ever close i spread disease pain and sorrow hidden within my cloak of purity a lie a front for morality i feel no pity no shame for what I've done you fear the strong because you're weak I'm reborn of a higher breed your human lives are food to me I breathe new life unto this earth reborn in light of the moon cursed to walk alone for all time under the moon beam's curse
