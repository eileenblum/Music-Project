I have refused desire
The beheaded and cold pain
Reaching towards the illness

Caressed by dark
Behold the burning Death!
Goathorns shall crush the time!

Darkness and Death!
Let your shadows fall around me
Come to me and hear my prayer

Caressed by dark
Behold the burning Death!
Goathorns shall crush the time!

Morbid winds blow
Through bones and skulls
Of ages and dust
Crucified to our Doom
To a new dawn
Of the midnight sky

Darkness and Death!
Let your shadows fall around me
Come to me and hear my prayer
