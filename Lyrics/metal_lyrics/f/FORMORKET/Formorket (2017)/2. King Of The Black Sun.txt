Heartbeats of a dying plane bury in eyes
In the shadows of a false universe
Where boundaries lie guarded by us

Of the pale hand of the king of the Sun
All from Nothing is true
And Nothing is All in the Doom
Over the visions

Coldness rise from the dusk
Of the dying plane

Grimness of the forever
Wanderings in tears
On fields in the raging night

On these paths of Nowhere
The only way that you can find
Whispering voices are in my dreams
