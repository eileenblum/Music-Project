The spirit of revenge awakened me
From the deepest shadows
And now that we avenge our father
To appear and to dissolve in vain

Return back to the roots
Cast the suffers
To the mid-point
Oh, His flame burns!

Rise from the stones and leaves!
From the core of the dying flesh
Blood flows and streams in fear
And paints worship
To the Death!

Worship!
Return back to the roots
Cast the eternal suffer
To the mid-point
Oh!

We are the fellows of Doom!
We are fellows of Doom!
We are fellows of Doom!
We are fellows of Doom!
