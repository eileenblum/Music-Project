I can see this world
Fall down to pieces
Erasing to malicious
Everlasting yearns
At the end under the edge
When each returns to vulture
My death will curse upon thee

Walk into Nothing
Cold dawns in the mind,
Shut stillness in life

This planet Earth
Turns out of itself
From the piece of time
Which is shattered
This planet Earth
Turns out of itself

This planet Earth
Turns out of itself
From the piece of time
Which is shattered
This planet Earth
Turns out of itself
This planet Earth!!!
