I will destroy what they have done
The purity of chaos shall restored
To once again we can see
The Darkest Dreams of the Old...

Destroy them, created from dreams
Their acts are so disgusting
Destroy these gods' rebels
My arms will see you again

Let's poison the water depths
And the power of the ring in the darkness

Of the abyss, it brought our light
Blind to the grief of our father

Let's poison the water depths
And the power of the ring in darkness

Ancestors of the deep
Risen from the abyss
And ready to poison his water
And now we will avenge
