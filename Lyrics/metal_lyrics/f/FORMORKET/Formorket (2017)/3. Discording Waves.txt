Discording waves emerge on end in furthermost empires, forces of deep in motion
A moonlit rock awaits, raised, beaten and rugged by the elements
Restless law of Hatred is Alpha and Omega there, by and for the rampage kept raging on
Knowing there must be words of secrets hidden, can not be learnt by mere legends from afar

Silence upon fierce heart
A horizon cloaked in crimson welcomes
Thus an arrival night fills with mysticism
As the water-plane reflects the might of Nanna
Not a vision any more
In midst of the wrath of Discordia
Could we dare to offer all to Vanity?

Behold the blackening
Legacy for our kin
All is out there
Stand at the world's end
Past the borders
Hindsight it is
Ever since the journey began
Mind and spirit never be healed
Yearn back not, yore is Now
