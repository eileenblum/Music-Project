The Lurking will
Eternal madness possessed
Feeding with Prayers
The last breath of decay

Moments of the Undead
Deeps of the poison
In Rust with this hunger
There's no Death in dying

On a winter night
Of gleaming it burns
Covers us slowly
On a path of a dream

Emerging from Hell
We all fall in time
Ultimate no mercy
And this is the last

Moments of the Undead
Deeps of the poison
In Rust with hunger
There is no Death
