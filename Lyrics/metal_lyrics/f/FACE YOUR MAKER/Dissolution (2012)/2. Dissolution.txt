This isn't a nightmare
This is the cleansing
Of a vile place

Our actions have brought this
Upon ourselves
We are all to blame
For our own extinction

We are all to blame
No one is innocent
No one is safe
We will all suffer the same fate

It's useless to weep for salvation
Our destination has been foretold

It's useless to plead to an empty sky
We will all repay every debt we owe

Agony, famine &amp; plague
Will lead us to extinction
This is all unavoidable

This world will be neutralized
This world will be sacrificed
