Disloyal, you've committed treason &amp; won't be forgiven
Hypocrite, you put on a mask &amp; pretend to be something you're not

Your consistency runs thin
Your complexion is counterfeit
Forfeiting the innocent for your egotistical gain

Your selfishness has brought upon misery &amp; obliteration
Gluttony has made you pray on the negligent

I will put an end to your existence
Your wretched life will be your demise
No benevolence, no mercy for filth

Your misfortune befalls becoming my
Adversary

This will be your
Genocide [2x]
I will be your
Genocide [2x]
This will be your
Genocide [2x]

Youâre nothing but a treacherous pig
Nothing, you pig
