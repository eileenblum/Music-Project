A nation filled, with manipulated minds set to obey

In a world where no one is equal
Salvation is known as a fabrication to you all
Confide from justice &amp; freedom

Enslaved by despair
You are forgotten
No voiced opinions
Numbers not names

Involuntary patriotism [2x]

They pull the strings
Twisting your minds to comply to their needs
Blinding you from reality
Mindless puppets hanging from your masterâs strings

There's a difference between
What youâre told &amp; what you know
No peace without order
No order without authority

Generations born
Into imprisonment
Procreations sentenced to death
Unable to use your brain

When they control what you think or say
The eye above the sky watches down on you
Watching your every move you make

New denominations are born
Into profit from suffering
