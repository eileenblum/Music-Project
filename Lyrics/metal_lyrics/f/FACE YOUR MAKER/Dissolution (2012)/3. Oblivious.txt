Mankind faces
Ruins &amp; despair
Empires will crumble
Monuments will collapse

This world we knew is changing
Yet we choose to play the blind mans game
Ignoring all the warning signs to our undeniable fate

We are oblivious
We are ignorant

One by one we are taken in by the tongues of a liar
Like sheep to the slaughter
We have fallen in the hands of a tyrant

You claim to be
Humanities one &amp; only salvation
You claim to be
This society's only redemption

This is
Our impending end
