So many devoted subjects
Sacrificing themselves, in your name
Follow &amp; obey
Follow &amp; obey your shepherd

Deceiver
Slanderer
Chastiser
Forsaker

You cast aside your apostles
Lead them to wander down a bottomless pit
As they fall to their knees
Prayers of help, left unanswered
Years of devotion, yet your guardian is absent
Where can he be?
Where are the things you have promised?

Where's your savior?

Every soul has
Been condemned
Every follower
Has been misled

Where's your savior? [2x]
