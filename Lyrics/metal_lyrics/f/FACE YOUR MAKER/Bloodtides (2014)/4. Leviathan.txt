Keep begging for mercy
Cry for forgiveness
No one can hear you
&amp; no one will listen
[2x]

There's no hope for
Taking down this beast [2x]
Nothing but false beliefs
Another fallacy

I never thought that it would come to this
Question a world that gives no explanation
Say goodbye to all your hopes &amp; your dreams
The filth in this world just keeps haunting me

Everything under what you believe
To be Heaven is, slowly coming down
To a screeching halt
&amp; there's no turning back from this

Nothing on Earth is equal
A creature
A nightmare
A monster you all fear

Dread of disappear [2x]

Keep begging for mercy
Cry for forgiveness
No one can hear you &amp; no one will listen [2x]

No one is fierce enough
To stand against this giant

It will devour anything in its path
Nothing will live &amp; no one will last
The mere sight of this is overpowering
Until there's nothing left

Weep
You worthless human [3x]
Weep
