Condemned with constant callousness
Afflict misery to those who deserve it
Prepare for the end
Beg for your life
There will be no trace left

There's no escaping this [2x]
I see the fear in your eyes

I will make you suffer
Then start with the pain
The hatred built inside is what's controlling me
I will erase your existence
&amp; there's no stopping the monster I've become

Your fate will be my closure
Your end will be my cleanse

Every time you weep you wish this was all a dream
Haunting your thoughts, I am your greatest illusion
Living a nightmare
As I live my fantasy

Accept your punishment cause there's no forgiveness here
This will be the last breath you take
As I wipe you off the face of this disgusting Earth

Strapped onto this chair you look into my eyes
You know I'm under control [2x]
Beaten to a mess, savor the pain &amp; burned alive till nothings left

Burn to a crisp [2x]
I have lost my mind &amp; there's no coming back from it
You scream, you shout but
No one can hear you now [2x]

I am the executioner [4x]

The executioner
