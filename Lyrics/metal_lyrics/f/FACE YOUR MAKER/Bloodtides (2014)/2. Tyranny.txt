Forced to be controlled by subliminal mind condition
Materialistic traits born into imprisonment
Consumed by consumption
Luxuries blind humanity

From the harsh truth of false accomplishments
This is known as modern day slavery
Divided nations filled with disgusting pigs

Freedom is lifeâs greatest lie
Freedom is a figment of imagination
Humanity is the pig
&amp; government is the butcher

You are all in line
Every one will get a chance
[2x]

Enslaved to work everyday for nothing
I wonât bow down to their oppression

Never will I carry out your lies
A world full of copies
A world full of greed
A world full of tyrants
Controlling everything
Cast into the flames of regret
Enforcing ideas that contradict

I will never fall to my knees
Iâd rather die on my feet
Abusing power at their own needs
Manipulating society
