You're so ignorant to think
I will fall for manipulation
I could read the lies off the tip of your tongue

You think you have every right to pass judgment
When you're a walking contradiction
Blood tides will drown the ignorance
&amp; death will come for all

No one can save you, you insect
I don't need beliefs to prove of my existence
Fragments of dust
Is what you'll become

You live your life like you want to die
&amp; try to save yourself with all your picket signs
Generation, after generation of being told what to believe
Exposing this cold world
Full of ruthless human beings

No substantial foundations [2x]

No matter what you say
You are sinners in the end
No matter what you think
You are the true bringers of death

You move your mouth before your ears
Only listen to
What you wanted to hear
Never think for yourself
Easily led to follow the crowd
Why are you so afraid of being wrong
There will be hell to pay &amp; it's free of cost
