Everything is melted, everything is so confused.
How to make decisions when there's so much to lose?
Money keeps this world going on.
How to survive not losing part of your own?

Screaming, twisting, step forward, turning back.
I'm in the cage my mind is cage I want to escape.
Give me your hand, please say a word to me.

So I can rely on something be me eyes to see this world in colors...

I'm turning this age when you lock your heart in cage.
I'm passing this gate behind which it is too late.
Or at least it's harder to see this world... in colors.

Everything is melted, everything is so confused.
How to make decisions when there's so much to lose?
Money keeps this world going on.
How to survive not losing part of your own?

Are you gonna loose this game?
Are we gonna lose this game?
