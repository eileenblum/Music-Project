Sick tradition. Slavery.
Never released from the leash.
They have too much to say while the others wish
They could open their mouth at least.

DISCRIMINATION.
Majority's REGULATIONS.

Suck your own blood, eat your own flesh.
I'm nothing like you, I don't want to be dead.
My eyes I can rely on them.
I must have redefined everything that you had said.

Words you're saying are poison we choke we crawl we die.
You're talking about love I can't see love in your god.
You're talking about mercy so let us live.
You're talking about values, they make me sick.

I don't believe in what you say...
I don't believe in what you're saying to me...

Does spirituality needs control?
What is your right to rule the world?
I'm not against god I'm just against you.
Your lies I just can't get through.

I don't believe in what you say...
I don't believe in what you're saying to me...

BURN...

You're a godkiller
