Senselessness occupied all senses
Was I following the patterns of dunces?
The predictable laws in the exterior
Got indefinable as it floated into the interior

But conflicts turned to harmony
When I crawled out through my wormhole
And admitted insufficiently
As part of the human role

You call me outcast, an empty nimbus
But I am just preserving my sanity
Why waste energy on your stagnating muss?
That curses my behaviour as insanity

(In your eyes) My aura losing it's glow
But I'm saving my strength in the shadows
Shutting down the power
Outting the chord to your observing tower

"He used to be a radiant head
But now it's pale like the dead"

You call me outcast, an empty nimbus
But I am just preserving my sanity
Why waste energy on your stagnating muss?
That curses my behaviour as insanity

Your idea structures are breathing by unreasoning
In essence and conclusion
With logic in mind, it's just false seasoning
That spices your illusion
