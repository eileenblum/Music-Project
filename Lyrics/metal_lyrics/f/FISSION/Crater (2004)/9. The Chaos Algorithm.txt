When the vapour of untempted fission
Energizer the eternal invasion
It spawns a chaotic violent mission
We're all victim for his sensation

Masters that turn to slaves
When the process conducts itself
Buried by atoms in falling caves
Neck high in radiation's delf

A step by step downfall
As a result of our megalomania
We aimed to make energy crawl
But lost the fight to Urania

Like the occurring of tidal wives
And volcanos furious fidelism
Untuning ligocs' harmonious octaves
To outshine every syllogism

That algorithm is now at work
When a bullet cuts through the air
Finding it's target through the mantle murk
That plunders every lair

A step by step downfall
As a result of our megalomania
We aimed to make energy crawl
But lost the fight to Urania
