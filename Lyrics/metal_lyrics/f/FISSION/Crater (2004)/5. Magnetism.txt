The flow of electrons aboard the compass
Tweaking the needle towards hell
Where the confluent harmony turns to fuzz
By field lines of anguish that encircle the cells

The neurons and the nerves
Depression colour's it's canvas
Inside the thinking canals, like curves
Magnetic waves wrap it's was

Like a sun from a distant universe
That burns down my soul
I suffer dejection's eternal curse
At it rules the corridors of my nole

I'm a magnet to emptiness
And I can't change the polarity
Attracting the darkness
Beyond the boundaries of modicity

As a dynamo for uncontrolled hate
Both rotator and stator
Storing the emotions in a mental crate
Swallowed by depression's generator

I am the engine and the turbine
For atrabilious accidents
I am privation divine
Molded by an ignitable element

By stars from a violent universe
As they sleep withing my soul
Pulling down an infinite curse
Into the corridors of my nole

I'm a magnet to emptiness
And I can't change the polarity
Attracting the darkness
Beyond the boundaries of modicity

As a dynamo for uncontrolled hate
Both rotator and stator
Storing the emotions in a mental crate
Swallowed by depression's generator
