My persection is set to a mode
Of squeezing thoughts into one lane
A phase that ends with overload
Through the head blows a violent hurricane

I feed this process with mental twisters
While watching man's stupidity
Building up a billion blisters
In the brains anatomy

Failing to flee, forced from the lee
Into the wind of unbearable motion
A blizzard of dree, across the mind's sea
Completes the inevitable tortion

Thought coordinations that fail to flex
Construct a daedal cyclone
I'm encircled by this vortex
Narrowed b the borders of it's cone

Dawn: becomes dark across the globe
Mountains: inverted abysses
The gentle breeze that travelled the lobes
Turns into typhoon enterprises

Failing to flee, forced from the lee
Into the wind of unbearable motion
A blizzard of dree, across the mind's sea
Completes the inevitable tortion

Awareness: flooded by infrequent precipitation
Vision: cursed by the spiral container
Hearing: deafened by this storm's invasion
Thinking: the vortex retainer
