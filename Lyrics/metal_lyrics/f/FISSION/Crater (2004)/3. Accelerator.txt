The society is subservient
To promote it's truth as a universal brand
About personal deviant
Like a wild fire it sweeps the land

Don't dare to think differently
Then it'll drown you in it's lough
Cause then you start a conspiracy
Steering revolution's plough

If you break the conformity
You offend it's unfluent platitude
Therefore I'm refining my asperity
Edifying my own magnitude

I've smelled the stench of arrogance
Under the limited skies
Of society's flamboyance
Fighting the accelerator of lies

The clinical laws that direct our culture
Seem set by barbarians
A static formula that scars like a vulture
Over us, the sleeping carrions

I've smelled the stench of arrogance
Under the limited skies
Of society's flamboyance
Fighting the accelerator of lies
