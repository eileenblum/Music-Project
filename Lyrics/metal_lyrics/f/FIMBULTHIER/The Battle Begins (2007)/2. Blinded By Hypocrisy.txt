Look above your head, blackened is the night
Black like endless death, the stars are losing their light
Hear the heavy pound, like a thousand hooves its sound
No more the sky is quiet, the stars have lost their light

See the heavy light, the light which makes us blind
Only a black cloth seen, where once the stars have been
The sky is falling down, in it we will drown
Mercy won't be showed to us, abandoned by the gods we trust

What have I done I lived like a man of war
Abandoned by our gods, Thor's anger now I saw
Lived full of honor and fought like man of war
Abandoned by mighty Thor, his anger now I saw

Listen to me you fools, because you must be blind
Thor did not abandon you, you all left him behind
Nothing can save us now

In your heads is grown, the seed which makes us blind
Sowed by lying bastards, makes us leave our gods behind
And want us to see their own

Vom falschen Gott erzÃ¤hlt
Wollen wir nicht den wahren Feind sehn
Den falschen Weg gewÃ¤hlt
MÃ¼ssen wir zum Ursprung zurÃ¼ck gehn
Ewig geeint im Zorn
Zusammen stehen wir hier
Drum lasst uns streiten fÃ¼r Thor
FÃ¼r Odin und fÃ¼r Fimbulthier

What have I done did I live like men of war
Abandoned our gods our anger now I saw
Did I live full honor and fight like men of war
Abandoned the mighty Thor, his anger now I saw

We are blinded by hypocrisy but take a look above
A star that shows us we can see
Where once we came from and where to move
And it is not the only one no we're not alone
We have resisted the evil seed
And all the doubt is gone

Never we will be alone don't need your single god

A new day arises the sun's coming through
The gods have forgiven
Never we will forgive you

This storm which awoke us, will soon come to you
Never again you will see, the sun coming through
You all will be hit then, not by thunder but swords we
Use to make it rain again, red the earth will be

Restoring our honor and fight like men of war
Revenge for our gods our anger then you saw
Even if we should die, we won't be alone
To late to believe, your god is gone

He never existed
He was a lie
