Great stories have been told
Of strong heroes and ancient wars
And now we live in a glorious world

The sun shines brighter then ever before
And the fields are greener and the sky is so blue
Peaceful is the world
But as history told us freedom is never secure

And the time will come
When we have to strike for freedom again
Then the flaming hearts of brave men
Have to flare up again
And the time is come that the sword will do the talking
