Into the battle I ride
The gods and my brothers at my side
Facing thousand enemies
Surrounding us but we will not kneel

Pulling our swords that will never rest
Defending our thoughts and finish our quest

Arrows are flaming in the sky
And their fire is the only light
Heads are falling to the ground
Our striking swords are the only sound

Raising our swords that will never rest
Defending our gods to finish our quest

Charge steel cutting flesh
We refuse to submit but we smash
Through the hordes of enemies
Revenge for our gods we'll make those men kneel

Striking with our swords that will never rest
Killing for our gods to finish our quest

Blood covers the battleground
My brothers and I are full of stab-wounds
Were fighting on in heavy rain
Cause strong viking blood runs through our veins

Still holding our swords that will never rest
Revenge for our gods till the end of our quest

The last head falls to the ground
But with our gods we are forever bound
All enemies have died
I fall to the ground see a valkyrie at my side

Never leaving my sword
My soul will never rest
I'm on the way to our gods
I finished my quest
To Vallhalla I ride
Again I raise my sword at Odin's side
