I dress myself in battle clothes
Preparing me to fight
My brothers I will meet them soon
Together we will ride

From the slopes of death we came
To destroy the years of blame
Brake the chains we were put in
Finally we'll win

We are predators in a human shape
Four warriors with flaming rage

We are fighting with burning steel
To make false warriors kneel
Blood will drown our way
No we'll make them pay

We are predators in a human shape
Four warriors with flaming rage

We will make false hammers fall
Until we here Odin's call
This will be our final ride
Cause Odin wants us at his side
