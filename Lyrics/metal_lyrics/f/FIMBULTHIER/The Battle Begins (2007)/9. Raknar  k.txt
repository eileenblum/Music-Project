Sitting in the great halls of Asgard
Fathers, brothers, me and glorious gods
Watching Midgard, the life of men without fear
But the sound of Gjallahorn reaches my ear

The sign Bifrosts guardian had to give
Sign of destiny, fate, no one shall longer live
The summoned deamons charge without remorse
Bifrost's breaking down under this overwhelming force

Vallhalla's gates open up, the ground begins to shake
My father riding the eight hooves leading his force to brake
The deamons siege, but his death is divine
So Fenrir ate him in one piece, now the wolf is mine

This is our realm's last dawn
Our fate, RagnarÃ´k is spawned

The fury in me grows up high
I'll avenge my father, Fenrir shall die
Treating his mouth with boots of steel
Breaking his jaw in a half, now he's killed

This is our realm's last dawn
Our fate, RagnarÃ´k is spawned

My brother snuffs at Jermungard
Nine steps later he'll be forever gone
Our god of war also my brother
Faces the deamon garm killing each other

Two long enemies both brothers of mine
Meet in the battlefield perish is divine
Two proud men of the same blood
But rage in both is all they got

I can see their staring eyes showing no fear
My scream to stop don't arrives their ears
Swords are drawn, making the final charge
To pierce without remorse each others heart

Now I've to see god of growing peace
Facing the lord of fire, the fire that will be released
Because he gave away his sword for his wife
The fire-lord will burn him out of life

This is our realms last dawn
Our fate, Ragnarok is spawned

Now around the world his fire will burn
I'm standing there have to watch what all will earn
The flames are raging high up to the firmament
Sun gets black, stars fall down, this is the end

A new world of golden time
Will rise from the sea and the sun will shine
Proud humans will live without blame
My survived bothers and I again shall reign
