I have led astray some stars, in remebrance of the embrace that we shall never
have. Lo my everlasting quest. The everflowing stream, the kis within the
sword, so near in the absence, close in the surrender. A sigh within a storm can
bring us together. Forget me not.

Feel the winter Eves, the glimmers of midnight are the promises of our coming
delight.

I have always been who I am, I am the one that I shall be, out of sight, always
there, like a shade in the night and a spark in the flames. You're so dear to my
heart. I have to fade away, I dwell in every signs. Fearless be for the grace,
and never satisfied. Forget me not.

Feel the winter Eves, the glimmers of midnight are the promises of our coming
delight.
