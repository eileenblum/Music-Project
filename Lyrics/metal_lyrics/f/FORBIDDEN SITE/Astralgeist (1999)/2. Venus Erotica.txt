She fainted in such a delicious kiss
That he heart didn't follow
Reaching in lust a final peace
To leave alone heaven below

An erotic spleen
Runs over my skin
Holding me within
My dark unrest

My heart ever keeps
The touch of her lips
And her finger tips
Upon my chest

Our last embraces
Have left their traces
In timeless places
Whence I still burn

But she far and wide
Whispered on my side
As a living tide
I shall return

A scarlet swang song in
my head
Entrances my sores for Death
Feeling her sights within my breath
Weeping with her the tears I shed

...Ideals are beings...
She's everything but a dream

She came to stir again
The violet laces
In a forgetful kiss
Made of silence and tears

We shall darken again
In a sweet violence
And fasten forever
The gates of innocence

...Astern of paradise...
Transfigure us Venus Erotica

She fainted in such a delicious kiss
That her heart didn't follow
Reaching in lust a final peace
To leave alone heaven below
