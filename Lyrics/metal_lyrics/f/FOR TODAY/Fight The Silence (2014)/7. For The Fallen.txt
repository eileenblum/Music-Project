THIS IS A SONG FOR THE FALLEN. I SEE YOU RISING AGAIN.
ONLY A COWARD WOULD RUN AWAY.
LOOKING FOR FREEDOM YOU ONLY FOUND REGRET.
ONLY A COWARD WOULD RUN AWAY.
LEAVE YOUR PAST BEHIND YOU, THERE IS HOPE AHEAD.

I SEE YOU WRITHING IN PAIN FROM ALL THE HELL THAT YOU'VE SEEN.
YOU LEFT IT ALL FOR A LIFE THAT NEVER SATISFIED YOU.
UNLOVED BY THE WORLD, YOU LOST IT ALL TO CONFORM TO.
THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR THE VOICE THAT'S CRYING OUT INSIDE YOU.
IF YOU CAN HEAR IT YOU STILL HAVE TIME!

Come back to your home, and all you're running from.
I'm begging you to come back to your home, and all you're running from.
I'm begging you to come home.
YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU'VE DONE, AND THIS IS NOT WHO YOU ARE.
NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU'VE RUN, YOU HAVE NOT GONE TOO FAR.
YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU'VE DONE, AND THIS IS NOT WHO YOU ARE.
NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU'VE RUN, YOU HAVE NOT GONE TOO FAR.

TAKE A DEEP BREATH, AND SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE.
TURN FROM THE PATH YOU'RE ON, AND CONQUER THE FEAR INSIDE.
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES, BUT IF YOU'RE STILL ALIVE YOU CAN STILL WRITE YOUR STORY.
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES, BUT THERE IS STILL TIME FOR THE HARD CLIMB TO GLORY.

I SEE YOU WRITHING IN PAIN FROM ALL THE HELL THAT YOU'VE SEEN.
YOU LEFT IT ALL FOR A LIFE THAT NEVER SATISFIED YOU.
UNLOVED BY THE WORLD, YOU LOST IT ALL TO CONFORM TO.
THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR THE VOICE THAT'S CRYING OUT INSIDE YOU.
IF YOU CAN HEAR IT YOU STILL HAVE TIME!

Come back to your home, and all you're running from.
I'm begging you to come back to your home, and all you're running from.
I'm begging you to come home.
YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU'VE DONE, AND THIS IS NOT WHO YOU ARE.
NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU'VE RUN, YOU HAVE NOT GONE TOO FAR.
YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU'VE DONE, AND THIS IS NOT WHO YOU ARE.
NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU'VE RUN, YOU HAVE NOT GONE TOO FAR.

COME BACK HOME!
THIS IS A SONG FOR THE FALLEN!
I SEE YOU RISING AGAIN, COME BACK HOME!
YOUR STORY ISN'T OVER, BUT ONE DAY IT WILL COME TO AN END!

TIME IS RUNNING OUT!
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES, MAKE NO MISTAKE, TIME IS RUNNING OUT!
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES, MAKE NO MISTAKE, TIME IS RUNNING OUT!
