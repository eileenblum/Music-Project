I stood, with terror flowing through my veins,
Before a judge that could see past the white mask that hid my shame.
With terror flowing through my veins,
All of heaven and earth hid themselves from His face.
And wrath is all I could see, as I looked back over my faded memories.
I sold my soul, and lost my destiny.
I let selfish ambition get the best of me.
Exposed for my arrogance, and justice demands my conviction.

Dead to rights.
He took my place and saved my life.
He had me dead to rights.
He took my place and saved my life.
There was no way out for me.
I had blood on my hands.
Guilty! Guilty!
Blood on my hands.
Guilty! Guilty!

Alone, I turned to hear my advocate saying,
"Father, forgive him. My blood is sufficient for him."
Though I had nothing left to give,
It had already been given as perfect provision.
So, gladly, I gave my life
To the only One who could save my life.

Dead to rights.
He took my place and saved my life.
He had me dead to rights.
He took my place and saved my life.

"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged, every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death." [Revelation 20:13-14]

No one is innocent.
There is hope, but what if no one is listening?
No one is innocent.
There is hope, but what if no one is listening?
This is the second death.
No one is innocent.
This is the second death.
No one is innocent.
This is the second death.
