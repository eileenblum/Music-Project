What have we done? What have we become?
A broken mirror reflecting only darkness.
Disruptive vision and closed off hearts.
We turned our face away from those we're sent to love.
But now I hear your voice calling me back home, it isn't over yet.
Bringing hope into our hopelessness.
Turning hearts from stone to flesh.

In a world headed for self destruction, the answer is here; are we too blind to see it?
