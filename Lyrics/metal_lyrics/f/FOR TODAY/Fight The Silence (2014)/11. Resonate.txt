If this was the last song that I could sing,
I pray these words would resonate.
Even if my voice gives out, my heart will still beat.
It's more than melodies, more than everything.

We're not alone; there is hope to heal the hurting.
We're not alone; there is hope to heal your soul.

We're not alone; there is hope, there is forgiveness.
We're not alone; you don't have to walk alone.
