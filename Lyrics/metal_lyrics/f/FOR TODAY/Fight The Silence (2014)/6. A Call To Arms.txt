Let desperation have a voice you can't ignore.
Now, listen closely to the voices of the poor.

"If a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and not be answered." [Proverbs 21:13]

Dying in the streets, they are fighting to see peace.
This is a call to arms against the greed of our nation.
This is a call to arms, we are the seed of salvation.
Call, call to arms; preying on the helpless for far too long.
Call to arms; it's time to cross the lines we've drawn.

Too afraid to be made to suffer, we stay safe in our luxury,
While broken people kill each other.
Desperate men do desperate things.
You want to stop the violence? Put an end to poverty!
You'll never keep them silent.
Desperate men do desperate things.
Greed is a deadly thing, still, in our shame, we hide.
Greed is a deadly thing, but justice won't be denied.

Dying in the streets, they are fighting to see peace.
This is a call to arms against the greed of our nation.
This is a call to arms, we are the seed of salvation.
Call, call to arms; preying on the helpless for far too long.
Call to arms; it's time to cross the lines we've drawn.

Too afraid to be made to suffer, we stay safe in our luxury,
While broken people kill each other.
Desperate men do desperate things.
They may be forgotten, but they are still not gone.
If we can meet their needs, we can find the peace
That we've been chasing all along.
They may be forgotten, but they are still not gone.
If we can meet their needs, we can find the peace
That we've been chasing all along.
