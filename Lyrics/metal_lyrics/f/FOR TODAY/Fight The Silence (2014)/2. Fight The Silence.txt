Eye to eye, face to face
Still we don't see them; we look away
Still they cry; but no one is listening
When will we open our eyes?

Open our eyes

This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries?
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes?

So let the world listen closely
As I scream to see the freedom they deserve
Let the world listen closely
I say it's time to cross the lines our culture blurred

Praying on poverty,
They keep us uninformed and distracted
If they can't fight for themselves,
We'll fight for them
It's time to fight the silence

Go

Broken, abused, and exploited
For the sick satisfaction of selfish men
Only a coward would try to ignore it
But we can raise our voice and bring it to an end

Fight, fight, fight the silence
Set the captives free
Fight, fight, fight the silence
They're a slave to a system of apathy

Bought and sold
Their right to life has been taken away
Bought and sold
Bring an end to slavery

Open our eyes

This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries?
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes?

This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries?
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes?

Their fate is in our hands
Will they be left there to suffer?
Will somebody take a stand?

Against a system
That's been designed
To deny its victims
Their right to life
Let's set the captives free

When all is said and done,
We'll see justice come
It's time to fight the silence

Go

The voice of the voiceless
Fight the silence
We are the hope for the hopeless
Fight the silence

Fight, fight, fight the silence
It's time to fight
