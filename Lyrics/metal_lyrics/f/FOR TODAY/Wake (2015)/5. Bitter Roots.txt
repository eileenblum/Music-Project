Bitter roots
I can't remove
The poison inside you

Bitter roots
Sorrow runs deeper
Than I ever knew

This thorn in my side
Was once so easy to hide
Beneath the surface I tried
To reach deeper inside (inside)
But I just can't deny

These bitter roots
I can't remove
The pain you held on to

Oh these bitter roots
Feed the disease
Spoil all the fruit
My bitter roots

This thorn in my side
Was once so easy to hide
Beneath the surface I try
To reach deeper inside (inside)
But I just can't deny

Reach deeper down inside
(Release me)
Consume the pain I cannot hide

(Let me go)
Reach deeper down inside
(Release me)
Consume the pain I cannot hide
Let me go

Take it all away
My skin is stronger than soil
My heart won't be pierced by these thorns

Let me go
Take it all away

My skin is stronger than soil
My heart won't be pierced by these thorns
Tear out the bitter roots
