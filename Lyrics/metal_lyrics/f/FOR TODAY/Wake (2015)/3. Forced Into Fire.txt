Life or death
Open your eyes before there's nothing left
Life or death
I fear we are facing our final breath

Life or death
Open your eyes before there's nothing left
Life or death
I fear we are facing our final breath

Living on borrowed time
Dwelling in despair
The weight of our malevolence
Is more than we can bear

Forced into fire
Purify
A world rotting to the core

Forced into fire
We can't revive
A world forever at war

In the midst of desolation
There is a call to a new life
(call to a new life)
Take the scars from my soul
Draw out the parasite

The heavens cry
Tears of blood
For the fallen world

Where is the standard of Man
Within the lawless plague?

The heavens cry
Tears of blood
For the fallen world

Where is the standard of Man?
Distorted by hatred
Hatred and rage

Forced
(forced)
Into fire

Forced
(forced)
Into fire

Life or Death
Open your eyes before there's nothing left
Life or death
I feel we're facing our final breath

Life or death
Open your eyes
Life or death
I feel we're facing our final breath

The heavens cry tears of blood
For the fallen world

The heavens cry tears of blood
Tears of blood for the fallen world

The heavens cry tears of blood
Tears of blood for the fallen world
