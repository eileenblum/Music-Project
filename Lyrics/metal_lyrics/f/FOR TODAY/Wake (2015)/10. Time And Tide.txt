Tell me it's not too late
Tell me it's not too late

Time slips away just like water through my fingers
The past lies in differential, fibbish decay 
Can I fix fractured wings before they whither away?
Rescue me!

Tell me it's not too late
Tell me we'll be OK
Tell me it's not too late
To rescue me, rescue me

Turn it around, turn it around
Wasted years will never come back around
Let them go, and
Turn it around, turn it around
All the pain that made us strong
Faded long ago

Can you take me back, can you take me back?
Trapped in this grace, I just can't forget the past
Can you take me back, can you take me back?
I can't live in misery

I will not let regret break me
I found strength through suffering
Strength through suffering
Strength, strength through suffering

Time slips away like the breath from my lungs
Blinded and deaf, come carry this soul
So broken and desperate, in search of its home
Rescue me!

Tell me it's not too late
Tell me we'll be OK
Tell me it's not too late
To rescue me, rescue me

Tell me it's not too late
Tell me we'll be OK
Tell me it's not too late
To rescue me, rescue me
Oh!
