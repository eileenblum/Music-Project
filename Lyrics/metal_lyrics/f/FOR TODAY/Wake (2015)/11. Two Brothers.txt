Father forgive me, I confess
I know exactly what I've done
While reaching out in my selfishness
Have I become a wayward son?

What more do you have for me?
I threw it all away while my brother stayed
My life's been in misery
As he defends the home that I betrayed

So disgusted with the life I've built
Overcome by the burden of shame
So disgusted with the life I've built
I'm afraid there's no one left to blame

Lying face down, covered in the filth of my own failure
I became, in desperation, what I swore I'd never be

Father forgive me, I confess
I know exactly what I've done
While reaching out in my selfishness
Have I become a wayward son?

What more could you want from me?
I watched my brother leave, but I stayed faithful
My life's been in misery
So I could make you see that I am able

Never moved and never conquered
I gave my heart and soul to 
Defend this home
Heart and soul
Defend this home
Heart and soul
Defend this home

Two brothers, far from home
One in heart and one alone
Two brothers are done with grace
Father forgive us of our disgrace

Two brothers, far from home
One in heart and alone
Two brothers are done with grace
Father forgive us of our disgrace

Two brothers, far from home
One in heart and one alone
Two brothers are done with grace
Father forgive us of our disgrace

Two brothers, far from home
One in heart and one alone
Two brothers are done with grace
Father forgive us of our disgrace
