Watch me as I self destruct
Under the weight of everything I wanted
Watch me as I self destruct
I gained the world, but it was not enough

Our idols are why we're broken
Please show us that hope is
A hopeless ambition

So we turned away
From the gods we'd made
And we made to break
So only truth remains

All our heroes will fail us
Everyone will fall
All our heroes will fail us
We'll forget them all
All our heroes will fail us
Everyone will fall
All our heroes will fail us
We'll forget them all

Like a crown on a dead man
All our praises are wasted on fame
Like a crown on a dead man
Every king takes his throne for granted

The one who flies the highest
Is doomed to fall the hardest
The one who flies the highest
Is doomed to fall the hardest

Our idols are why we're broken
Please show us that hope is
A hopeless ambition

So we turned away
From the gods we'd made
And we made to break
So only truth remains

All our heroes will fail us
Everyone will fall
All our heroes will fail us
We'll forget them all
All our heroes will fail us
Everyone will fall
All our heroes will fail us
We'll forget them all

Watch me as I self destruct
Under the weight of everything I wanted
Watch me as I self destruct
I gained the world, but it was not enough
