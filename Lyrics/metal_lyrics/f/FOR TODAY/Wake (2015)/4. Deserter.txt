Help me light the way for the brothers we have lost, 
their silence on the pain is still replayed for all that we are not.

Across the plains of everything, 
I see wreckage standing where revival used to be.
No sadder sight than the work their hands abandoned, 
leaving vacant towers to crumble in the sand.

Fear brings out the worst in men, 
they go where there is nothing but destruction, 
and they thrive in it.
Fear brings out the worst in men, 
they turn away from anything their prideful heart resists.

Light a candle for the lost, 
the ones who wander in the dark, 
seeking help from helpless hearts.
Light a candle for the lost, 
I still remember, 
I still remember who you are.
(I still remember who you are)

Help me light the way for the brothers we have lost, 
their silence on the pain is still replayed for all that we are not.

I walk the same path my brothers once began, 
but it's much lonelier tonight than it was back then.
Wearied by the storms and subtle songs of discontent, 
I watched heroes fall along the way where angels fear to tread.

Deserter, 
your truth is left unsaid.
Deserter, 
there's a war, 
there's a war inside your head.
Deserter, 
I remember you; 
There was a dream in your heart, 
I could see from the start, 
and it never came true.
Deserter, 
I remember you; 
I see the pain in your eyes and the fear that you hide from the brothers you once knew.

So light a candle for the lost, 
the ones who wander in the dark, 
seeking help from helpless hearts.
So light a candle for the lost, 
the ones who wander in the dark, 
seeking help from helpless hearts.
Light a candle for the lost, 
I still remember, 
I still remember...
