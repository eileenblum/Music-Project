This place is a wasteland
In isolation, we will fall
Never forsaken if we can fight the flame
That burns within us all
This place is a wasteland
In isolation, we will fall
Never forsaken if we can fight the flame
That burns within us all

Isolated, broken down to the ground
Like a castle in the sand
Scarred by betrayal
There's a darkness that creeps into everything I am

I never asked to be an outcast
Promises turn to tragedy
I wasn't meant to be alone
Severed ties turn to broken dreams

Broken dreams
Only memories of the peace I once felt
Broken dreams
Desperation is all that I have left

This place is a wasteland
In isolation, we will fall
Never forsaken if we can fight the flame
That burns within us all
This place is a wasteland
In isolation, we will fall
Never forsaken if we can fight
The flame that burns with us all

Face down in the dirt
With vultures surrounding me
Praying for my death
Have I been betrayed?
Or the mother betrayer
Save me before there's nothing left

I'm not hopeless, I'm just abandoned
I'm not dead, I'm just dead to you
I'm not hopeless, I'm just abandoned
I'm not dead, I'm just dead to you
I'm not hopeless, I'm just abandoned
I'm not dead, I'm just dead to you
