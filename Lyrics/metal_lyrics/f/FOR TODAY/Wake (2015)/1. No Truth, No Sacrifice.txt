The weak, justify the actions of the weak.
There is no answer, in cancer you speak.
Sickness in the selfishness

A wolf in disguise hiding a bitter fire
Too afraid to look into his lifeless eyes
Lost inside a world built upon deception
The coward in the mirror is his own reflection

No truth, no sacrifice
This world has grown content with compromise
No truth, no sacrifice
This world has grown content with compromise

Helplessness is just an illusion
There's a hole in our hearts
that overflows, and stains the earth with sin
There's a hole in our hearts
That will not close, unless we face what lies within

Helplessness is just an illusion
The adversary that threatens to kill us all
Paralyzed by our own confusion
Our selfishness will be our downfall

No truth, no sacrifice
This world has grown content with compromise
Know truth, know sacrifice
This world has grown content with compromise

There's a hole in our hearts
that overflows, and stains the earth with sin
There's a hole in our hearts
That will not close, unless we face the lies within.

The weak, justify the actions of the weak.
There is no answer, in cancer you speak.
The weak, justify the actions of the weak.
There is no answer, in cancer you speak.
Sickness in the selfishness
