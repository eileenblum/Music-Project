You mean the world to me. Thoughts of you not being here with me. Youâre giving up without looking for a way out. Walk towards the light. Stop this timebomb on yourself. There is more to this world than you could ever imagine. A love so pure, wanting to lift you up. To bring your head out of the sand and carry you on the path to righteousness. A love so pure fixes broken hearts, broken lives. This gift delivered by our God. These words of hope are yours to take. You may be fearful but you are not alone. I will be there to help you through. Are you up for the challenge? Believe in yourself. Know that these words, these words of hope are yours to take.
