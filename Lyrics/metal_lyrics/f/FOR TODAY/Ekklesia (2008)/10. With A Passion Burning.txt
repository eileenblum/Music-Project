Do you have a passion? Find something that you love. Run with it, donât stop for anyone else. No one can get you down. You are better than that. Fight for your passion. Be knowledgeable of your roots and proud of what youâve become. If what you love reflects yourself inside out it is not a trend. So many people will never find true life and all the passion that can flow from it. Everyone is so quick to judge. All just so quick to judge. But while theyâre just watching. Weâll run past them.
