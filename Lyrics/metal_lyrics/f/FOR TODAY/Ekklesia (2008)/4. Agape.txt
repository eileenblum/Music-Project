Can we payback more than can be measured? If we could love. If we could love. There is an amount of love. An amount of grace. Beyond all meaning. Beyond all measure. If we could even grasp it. There would be more pleasure. There is no greater love than laying your life down for a friend. If we loved God to a teaspoon of his overflowing cup what would this world then see? Our land of sorrow and turmoil would swirl to a community of joy. Open our eyes to glisten. Open our hearts to receive. Open our mouths to smile. This is a love that none can fathom. How can we repay? Love the Lord your God. With all your heart. All your soul. All your mind. All your strength.
