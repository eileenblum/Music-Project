Weâre all people with a dream. Some good, some bad. Some are real, and some are just fads. Who will come out on top &amp; who will just give it up. God has his own plans for us. Itâs not ours, itâs His. Itâs time to give it up. Keep your head up high and never lose sight of the goals. We will never give up. Never lose sight, of the goals within us. We will never give up and He will never back down. Seek and live everyday to never worry what heâll say. He will never back down. Itâs not ours, to decide. Shake it, move. In the end there will be no doubt. We will never lose sight, of the goals.
