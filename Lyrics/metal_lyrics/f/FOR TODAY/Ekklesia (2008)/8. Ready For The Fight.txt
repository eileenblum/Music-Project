Ready for the fight. Weâve made it too easy to excuse everything we do as acceptable. Or that itâs just like everyone else. The popularity of something does not excuse it. We cannot live a life of sliding. Let us walk straight forward. Eyes focused on our destination. Body armored for the battle. Soul ready for the fight. Prepare us, O God, to go out this time. Honoring your bride. With the respect you deserve. No more excuses this time. Keep the dress clean. We will walk before you and return with no more dirt upon us. We will return clean.
