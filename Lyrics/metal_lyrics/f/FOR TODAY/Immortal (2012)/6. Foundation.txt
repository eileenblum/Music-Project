I make this declaration with heaven watching my every move:
He is my sure foundation, and I will trust Him with my life.
I will remain a keeper of the flame for the righteous one.

I will never abandon this cause. My devotionâs uncompromising.
I will never abandon this cause. I see the light, I see hope arising.
This faithful generation will rise with focused gaze.
This faithful generation will stand in heavenâs gate. 

So I will not let you go.
I will not let you go. I will not let you go.
Through these trials, I will stand.
I will not let you go. I will not let you go. Through these trials, I will stand. 

I have built my life on the rock of my salvation, and I will not be moved from my firm foundation.
I will not be moved from my firm foundation. I will stand on the Word of my God, with everything.
Iâm not ashamed to say I will stand.
The sword of Truth in my hand is conquering every demonâs stronghold.Â 

So I will not let you go.
I will not let you go. I will not let you go.
Through these trials, I will stand.
I will not let you go. I will not let you go. Through these trials, I will stand. 

Every nation will bow.
Weâll stand with fire in our eyes, and He will reign forever as a King with justice at His side.
Every nation will bow.
Weâll stand with fire in our eyes, and He will reign forever as the King of Kings. 

I will not be moved. Unshakeable. Watch the nations bow.
Unshakeable. I will not be moved. Unshakeable. Watch the nations bow down.
