(We stand as one) Under a flag of âfreedom,â...
(We stand as one) ...we feel the flames of hell.
(We stand as one) But revolution comes for the brave ones, we know that time will tell.
We wore the chains of bondage,...
(We stand as one) ...painted with stars and stripes.
(We stand as one) But we can turn this nation from its path, if we will pay the price.

This is a call to the brave ones, the few that stand and fight:
Awaken our generation from their sleep! The fate of a nationâs hanging on your word.
Just stand up and testify: âI am free!â And watch heaven open wide. âI am free!â
Just stand up and testify: âI am free!â And watch heaven open wide. âI am free!â

At the gate of our nation stands the guardians of the new age. I can see them now.
They will intervene in the course of our destruction. I can see them now.
We are the protectors, the few that stand and fight. We are the protectors, the guardians of light.

This dying nation needs your hope, so stand up and testify.
Let your light shine in the darkest night. Never hold back, never give up the fight.
Then the darkness will not overcome where the light shines.
So we call to the strong: Let your voice be heard. Let your voice be heard!

(We stand as one) Under a flag of âfreedom,â...
(We stand as one) ...we feel the flames of hell.
(We stand as one) But revolution comes for the brave ones, we know that time will tell.
We wore the chains of bondage,...
(We stand as one) ...painted with stars and stripes.
(We stand as one) But we can turn this nation from its path, if we will pay the price.

This is a call to the brave ones, the few that stand and fight:
Awaken our generation from their sleep! Let your voice be heard.

We are the revolution. I hear the new sound. We are the revolution. All hell canât stop us now.
We are the revolution. I hear the new sound. We are the revolution. All hell canât stop us.
