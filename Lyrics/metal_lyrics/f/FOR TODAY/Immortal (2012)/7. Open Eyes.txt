Iâm in over my head, but help is on the way.
When all hell stands against us, weâll have the victory.
Iâm in over my head, but help is on the way.
When all hell stands against us, weâll have the victory.

We will prevail.

We will prevail...
I keep my eyes upon the Savior, and tear my eyes away from every worthless thing.
For my eyes were made to see Your glory. 

Now I am not my own, I was bought with a price â
bought with the blood of heavenâs precious King.
So now I gladly give You all of my life, to manifest Your goodness in everything.
Only You can set me free, only You can set me free, so I fix my eyes upon You.
Only You can set me free, only You can set me free, Youâre the One that I belong to.
(I belong to You)

Purify my eyes.
Let wisdom be my narrow path (Purify my eyes.), and righteousness my guide. Purify my eyes.
Deliver me from youthful lust (Purify my eyes.), and fix my gaze upon my calling. Purify my eyes.

The rising Son is all I see; the bright and shining One who died for me.
The rising Son is all I see; the bright and shining One who died for me.
The rising Son is all I see; the bright and shining One who died for me.Â 

And You demand every part of me.

Now I am not my own, I was bought with a price â
bought with the blood of heavenâs precious King.
So now I gladly give You all of my life, to manifest Your goodness in everything.
Only You can set me free, only You can set me free, so I fix my eyes upon You.
Only You can set me free, only You can set me free, Youâre the One that I belong to.

Iâm in over my head, but help is on the way.
When all hell stands against us, weâll have the victory.
Iâm in over my head, but help is on the way.
When all hell stands against us, weâll have the victory.

Darkness will not prevail.
The rising Son is all I see; the bright and shining One who died for me.
The rising Son is all I see; the bright and shining One who died for me.
