Broken men are delivered from their bondage to sin.
The hardest hearts break in surrender, and heaven conquers once again.

So I lay down my life for the world to see
that there was only One who could break the chains that bound me. 

Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man. My King is alive! My King is alive!
Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man. My King is alive! My King is alive!
And He is worthy of everything.

I know Iâm not the only one who felt the hands of death.
But I have found the only One who can restore this life.
I... I am convinced He can save you, because I was once in need of a savior.

"If an individual loves God supremely, he will be as conscious that he lives for God as that he lives at all." - Keith Green

So, in this moment I declare, for the lost and the hopeless:

Deliverer, deliver us. Deliverer, deliver us.
Deliverer, deliver us. Deliverer, deliver us.
Deliverer, deliver us. Deliverer, deliver us. Auh....

Here I stand, unashamed.

Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man. My King is alive! My King is alive!
Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man. My King is alive! My King is alive!

And I will hold fast to the profession of my hope, because He who promised is faithful.
(My King is alive! My King is alive!)
Time and time again, in my weakness, Heâs been strong for me.
Iâve not just heard about Him, Iâve heard Him.
Iâve not just seen evidence of Him, Iâve seen Him. 
(My King is alive! My King is alive!)
Heâs alive, and Heâs conquered the grave once and for all. (and for all) (My King is alive!)
