Only one name has the power to save us. (Eternal One, You stand alone.)
Only one name has the strength to heal. (Exalted King upon the throne)
Only one name causes demons to tremble. (Eternal One, You stand alone.)
Only one name sets the captives free. (Exalted King)

Only one name has the power to save us. (Eternal One,Â You stand alone.)
Only one name has the strength to heal. (Exalted King upon the throne)
Only one name causes demons to tremble. (Eternal One, You stand alone.)
Only one name sets the captives free. (Exalted King)

There is hope in the wake of misery in the name that is above all.
Hope in the wake of misery. I will stand strong when the nations fall. 

Into my strong tower I can always run.
And I know that Your name will defend me from every threat.
When I was overcome by this life, I called Your name to protect me.
You came and you rescued me from myself.

Overcome by the deafening sound of self-destruction, I turned to You and You saved me.
Overcome by the deafening sound of hell on earth, I turned to You, You remade me.

My fortress and my protector, I belong to You. 

Only one name has the power to save us. (Eternal One, You stand alone.)
Only one name has the strength to heal. (Exalted King upon the throne)
Only one name causes demons to tremble. (Eternal One, You stand alone.)
Only one name sets the captives free. (Exalted King)

There is hope in the wake of misery in the name that is above all.
Hope in the wake of misery. I will stand strong when the nations fall.

And heavenâs army stands alone. 

Into my strong tower I can always run.
And I know that Your name will defend me from every threat.
When I was overcome by this life, I called Your name to protect me.
You came and You rescued me... You came and You rescued me...
You came and You rescued me from myself.Â
