Give me strength to stand when the battle rages. I will never falter on this narrow road.

I was made for this battle, and I will never fear my enemy.
I was made for this battle, the only threat is my apathy.

I was made for war. (for war...) I was made for war.
And my victory is certain. Yes, my victory is sure.
Youâll see me stand defiant, with the warrior that will conquer all.
Victorious in death, He will never fall.

I am victorious only when I remember who I am.
And heavenâs waiting on the glory that Heâs put in my hand.
My redemption (my redemption...) is to bring redemption.

Steadfast, I press on for the freedom of the world, for that is why my Savior bought me.
