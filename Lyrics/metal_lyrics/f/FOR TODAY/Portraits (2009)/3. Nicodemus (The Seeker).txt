Grace is my destiny, but pride is my home. Your words have called me from my comfort. Iâll give you my life, if youâll hold it in your truth, because truth is the pursuit that captivates my soul. And teacher, to be honest, I am very afraid. This is all I have. I come before you broken. This is all I have. Tell me there is more than this. Jesus, Iâd give my life... Iâd give my life... Iâd give my life for a truth that could never be shaken. And then you came to offer me everything that Iâd been looking for. I am the reborn, into a life of purpose. I am the renewed; born of the Spirit, and sent forth to walk in truth. I will walk in truth; in all the truth of your miraculous power. I will walk in truth. And expect your healing hands to work in me. Grace is my destiny, but pride is my home. Jesus, your words have called me from my comfort. Iâll give you my life, if youâll hold it in your truth, because truth is the pursuit that captivates my soul. You are all I have. I stand before you redeemed. You are all I have. I could never want more than this.

Nicodemus was called a ruler of the Pharisees. He was regarded as a spiritual leader and a religious authority in his time; yet, he approached Christ to acknowledge and confess that He (Jesus) was sent by God. And, while he was afraid and approached Jesus in secret, at night, Christ validated His search for Truth, and shared with Nicodemus a number of the greatest statements of spiritual truth and authority to have ever stood to challenge the human soul.

The search for Truth will always bring us to Christ.
