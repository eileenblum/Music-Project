Youâre not alone, my son. I made you for so much more than this... more than this. Donât be afraid, my child, for I have overcome the world. Go tell the world that I would die for them to know me. And I would die for them to live. And this is life: that they would know you, God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. This is life, child. Iâll give you everything. And you can stand tall for there is life in me. Now, let the blood I shed be just enough for you to know that you will always have a home with me - no, you will not be abandoned. All hell will not stand against us, for only those who choose to die will claim the life I have for them. So now the question stands: Would you die... would you die for me? Would you die... would you die for me? Would you die... would you die for me? Would you die... Can you hear it? Can you hear my voice? Iâve been calling you since the day you were born, to come home... to come home to the place Iâve prepared for you. Youâre not alone.

Perhaps one of the greatest mysteries surrounding the character of Christ is His willingness and desperation to partner with us. He was God in the flesh â the complete manifestation of goodness and love â and yet, he not only lived to bring people into partnership with Himself, He died to make it a possibility. In the pursuit of the deepest, most eternal desires of your heart, believe this one powerful truth: You are not alone.
