An army approaches! Arise! Arise! Arise! Prepare! Prepare! Prepare! This is the Word from the mouth of God. And in itâs power you will find life. We are the watchmen of a new generation, and we will stand faithful; as intercessors and as prophets, as those who call down the breath of God to fill the dead. Know they will arise. Prophesy: âDry bones, claim your lifeâ. This is the river of life, and it will flow from the place of worship. He is the giver of life and at His voice, the mountains will fall. Ultimate decimation. Ultimate decimation. Ultimate decimation. I will not be afraid, for I am a chosen one of God. I will not be afraid, but I will stand for you. I will not be afraid, for I am a chosen one of God. I will not be afraid, but I will stand for you. We will rise up, and we will stand prepared, and we will fearlessly defend this city. We will rise up, and we will stand prepared, and we will fearlessly defend this city. But, we will not stand alone. Holy Spirit fall... Holy Spirit fall on us... Fall... Holy Spirit fall... Holy Spirit... and breath your life into us. ...fall... Holy Spirit fall on us... Fall... Holy Spirit fall and breathe your life into us.

A heart for passionate and powerful intercession is a rare thing, but when God calls it forth, it is something that will change entire nations. Desperate prayer will shift the heavens and shake the earth. We, as a people, will declare to a dead world âArise!â, and we will see the breath of God fill their lungs, and hear the praises of the redeemed fill the air. In the spirit of Ezekiel, I wrote about standing fearlessly on behalf of our brothers and sisters in humanity â our own flesh and blood. May the Sons of God begin petitioning the Father for the sake of their generation.
