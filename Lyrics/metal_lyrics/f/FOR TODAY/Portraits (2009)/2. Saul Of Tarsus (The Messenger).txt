May the world know that I am Yours. I will never be silenced. May the world know that I am Yours. I will never be silenced. I will never be silenced. I will never be silenced. I will never be silenced. I will never be silenced... I will resist my sin to the point of blood, and I will wear my scars like badges of honor. But let my hope cry out that my God is greater than the pain of persecution. My God is greater than this world. There will never be another chance to live today for God. There will never be another name that can save us from ourselves. And so, steadfast and undeterred, I will proclaim the name of Christ to a dead and dying world. I am not ashamed! I am not ashamed! I am not ashamed! We will resist our sin to the point of blood, and we will wear our scars like badges of honor. But let our hope cry out that our God is greater than the pain of persecution. Blinded, I saw that Christ is Lord. Now, may the world see You through open eyes. God, my Father, reign.

Saul of Tarsus, later named Paul, after his conversion to Christianity, was pivotal in the establishment of the church of Jesus Christ. Previous to his revelation of the divine nature of Christ, he was a brutal persecutor of Christianity, and was responsible for the death of many members of the early church â He was even present at the stoning of the first martyr, Stephen.

If there is any person that deserves to be rejected by God, and abandoned by Christ, it is Saul of Tarsus. But, not only was he sought out and forgiven by Christ, He was used miraculously and powerfully by God. Let this stand True for us all. Not one of us has fallen too far to be redeemed by the blood of Christ. We are not asked to be qualified for the work of God, we are asked to be willing. May we never be silenced, and may our world change as He glorifies His willing servants.
