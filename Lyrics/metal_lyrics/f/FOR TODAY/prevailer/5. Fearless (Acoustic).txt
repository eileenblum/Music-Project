[3x]
We will not
We will not
We will not
Be afraid

We will not
We will not
We will not

We are fearless
Fearless

We bear the mark of the uncreated god
So what should we fear?
We bear the scars of the holy risen son
So tell me what should we fear?

Every threat is hollow
Because our victory is already set in stone

We are the fearless ones

[2x]
We will not
We will not
We will not
Be afraid

[2x]
Though we stand in this dark valley
We will not be afraid
For we know that you are near

You are near

I can feel the courage rising
In the hearts of the sons of god
I can feel a fire burning
Across the earth we stand as one

We are not dismayed by the darkness
That surrounds us here
Because we know that when all hell closes in
If we stand and fight we are not alone

Though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death
We are not alone
We will fear no evil for you are near

We are the fearless ones

[2x]
We will not
We will not
We will not
Be afraid

[2x]
Though we stand in this dark valley
We will not be afraid
For we know that you are near

You are near

He can't stop the kingdom
You'll see him bow at the throne on judgement day
So let the devil come

We are fearless
Fearless

So let the devil come
