To the ones with broken dreams, and to the lost and hopeless.
To the ones ashamed of what was lost to the world: Come meet your King!
Let the generation of the broken-hearted be restored. Come meet your King.
Let the generation of the broken-hearted be restored. Come meet your King.

God, I... I declare over my generation: Restoration!
Under siege, we have fallen into the hands of deception.
Open our eyes. Bring us back to life again.
Open our eyes. Bring us back to life again.
Open our eyes. Bring us back to life again.
Come set our minds free. Let us not be bound to this world.
Come set our minds free. Let us not be bound to this broken world.

But only You can bring us back. Father, turn our hearts away from this world.
Only You can bring us back. You are the only hope and so we run to You.
Break everything in Your path. Take Your rightful place in our lives.

Ahh... We stand our ground, contending for breakthrough.
And we will never let up, so now the stage is set, and ready for breakthrough.

Greater suffering is to come, if You donât break everything.
Destroy the compromise of our flesh. Come and break everything.
Bring with You liberty for the captives. Savior, break everything.
Break everything in Your path....
Break everything in Your path. Take Your rightful place in our lives.
Break everything in Your path. Take Your rightful place in our lives.
