Crucify me! The only honor I seek is to live and die for the warrior King. Crucify me! And let the world cry out that I am still too bold, but I wonât back down. Crucify me! And you will see, this flesh will die to liberate my Spirit.

If death has touched my Kingdom, watch, as it bows itâs head in shame. My eyes have seen glory. Watch as I fearlessly procl.. âFor me to die is gain.â And so my legacy is set. I am eternal. But, I was born to die, that the sons may live. Let the nations see. I was born to die.

I am everlasting. From the grave, I have come in glory. I am everlasting. When the world burns, know Iâll be standing. Wake up, and see my destiny. When you can wake up, youâll know I stand as the hope for victory.

No one takes my life, but I lay it down willingly. My words will not fall; this is the heart of God.
My words will not fade. Truth is the ground I built my Kingdom on--and it will stand eternal.
