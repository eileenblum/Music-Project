[feat. Drew Dijorio from STRAY FROM THE PATH]

Arm the masses! For too long, we have lived like captives. Now we fight for freedom. Arm the masses!
Arm the masses! Godless generation, turn around! Turn your face away.

The weapon I hold separates soul from spirit. The weapon I hold is the Word of the Living God. What the eternal One has spoken, He will do.

The front lines are littered with the bodies of the unarmed. So, take your weapon! The time has come for
the brave to rise up. Take your weapon! The enemy comes to destroy your vision. The time has come!
Take your sword and fight. The time has come for Truth to rise. The time has come! Take your sword and
fight. Truth is all we have in a world of deception. Defiant, I rise. Alive again and equipped with just one weapon. Defiant, I fight. He is eternal and supreme in victory. Defiant, I will stand, and bow before no one but the living King, who holds the world in His hands.

Are you the one who will stand up to a corrupt world system? Are you the one who will stand and fight, now is the time, rise against them! Are you the one? Stand up!
