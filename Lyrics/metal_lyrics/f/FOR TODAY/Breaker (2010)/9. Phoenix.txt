Now is the time for those who have died to rise, and lift the sound of our voices high; kingdom come!
Kingdom come!

There is a fire in the atmosphere. Can you feel it? You have been called to relinquish fear. Can you hear
it? You were made to stand before the throne. Can you see it? Tell me, where are the ones with the heart
for warfare--the ones that died to say, âThis is the price you payâ? Step up! There is no glory without
death. Step up. Who will answer the call? Death is glory!

I will rise from the ashes of my own death to abundant life under the cross, and I will not be turned back,
but I will come with an army; for He will raise up a generation to seek His face.

Now is the time for those who have died to rise, and lift the sound of our voices high; kingdom come!
Kingdom come!
