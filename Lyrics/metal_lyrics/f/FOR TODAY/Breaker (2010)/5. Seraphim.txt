Burn, and let the whole world see! You were made to burn.
...and let the whole world see! You were made to burn.
...and let the whole world see! You were made to burn.

I see an old breed of prophet arising, speaking as voices from another age;
set ablaze with the flame of the Spirit of God, and sent from before the throne.
...sent from before the throne.
We are sent from before the throne to stand up and speak out,
and let hell tremble when they hear us say,
âWe are the burning ones, and we will not be contained!â
âWe are the burning ones, and we will not be contained!â Oh...

Burning ones, arise! Come forth!

Oh take your flame, ignite the world.
We are the only hope for a hopeless world to see the face of the living God.
Oh take your flame, ignite the world.
Under the name above all names, we declare that the glorious One lives.
Take your flame, ignite the world. Take your flame, ignite the world!
Take your flame, ignite the world. Take your flame, ignite the world!

Come to the throne! Come to the throne!
You were made to burn and let the whole world see!
Burn, and let the whole world see. Burn, and let the whole world see.

Oh take your flame, ignite the world! Oh take your flame, ignite the world!
...ignite the world! Take your flame, ignite the world! Take your flame, ignite the
world! Take your flame, ignite the world! Take your flame, ignite the world!
