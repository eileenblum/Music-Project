You see my blood and sweat and tears I have poured on the ground before you. Take everything.
Blood and sweat and tears, you have poured on the ground before me, when you gave everything.

I have lived this war too long. Come and take everything. I have lived in sin too long. Come and take
everything. I release it all, finally. Finally, I surrender. All to you, I give it all to you. Finally, I surrender. All I am, I owe it all to you. Finally, I surrender. All to you, I give it all to you. Finally, I surrender. All I am, I owe it all.

You fight for me when I canât fight for myself. This battle is not mine, but the battle belongs to the Lord. This battle is not mine, but the battle belongs to the Lord. I am no slave unto this broken flesh, because you gave me hope. I am no slave to this broken flesh, because you are my hope. I am no slave to my flesh--that man has died. I am a free man!

Under the blood, I rise. Redeemed, I stand; carried back from hell by your nail-scarred hands. And now
Iâm free. You broke my chains and you gave me the key. So I bow to show you, that you are everything
to me. Finally, I surrender. All to you, I give it all to you. Finally, I surrender. All I am, I owe it all to you. Finally, I surrender. All to you, I give it all to you. Finally, I surrender. All I am, I owe it all to you.
