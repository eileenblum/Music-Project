Reaper of the night 
the end of their lives 
following the rules 
pushin through 

waiting in silence 
I will be there 
Striking in the dark 
taking your life

If you want the truth 
That I can give to you 
make your choice right now, 
before I let it out

Words just can't describle 
My perfect alibi 
Dare you cross my glance 
I will give you the blade

Futile your prayers 
Last words in dispair 
There is no savior 
The ends drawing near

Struggle to shout 
till your last breath 
before I cut you 
and lay you to rest

There's no where to run 
there's no where to hide 
there is no place on earth 
that I cannot find 

I know all your life 
So I take my time 
let the voices start 
screaming inside

The life from your veins now flows 
forsaken, perplexed your eyes going grey 
My blade penetrates your soul 
Reapin, screamin, lying, your dying 

Bedtime you bastard, a lust kill, 
you feed my affliction 
addiction

Tied in position 
You'll bleed out, reflecting 
I cut you in pieces 
I throw you to high seas 

Fulfillment through violence 
The cycles complete 
Amidst this sheep herd 
A Wolf wanders deep

To serve an protect

The Angel of death

Screaming Inside
