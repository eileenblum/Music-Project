Pray for life 
the air is running low 
I'm getting out of control 
and there's no turning back

Ignorance 
Can't you understand 
the brainwash ahead 
leeches of the law

paralyse 
don't you run away 
the guilty is your game 
that you never play

make my day 
this shit will never change 
you're birth a mistake 
stay away from me

Stare at yourself 
and see what you've become 
victim of persistence 
a puzzle you'll never solve

Day by day you try to spit in my face 
make my world this reign of violence

Empytness 
This words full of lies 
Feeding off of your life 
you don't know shit

masks will fall 
Showing your real face 
it's time to embrace 
your final stand

eye for an eye 
you gonna meet the truth 
crawling at my feet 
you face your doom

fuck you all 
I gonna break those walls 
gona put you down 
no regrets at all

Stare at yourself 
and see what you've become

victim of persistence 
a puzzle that you`ll never solve

Day by day you try to spit in my face 
make my world this reign of violence

Free forever I walk alone 
never judge what you have done 
forget me now or pay the price 

lies [3x] 
lies that you deny 
Deny [3x] 
Deny this life of lies
