The One, The One, the One 
Whose feeling distant 
I've been searching for all my power 
across the world hidden in your soul

The one, the one, the one 
Whose feeling distant 
I shall never know my path 
but sometimes I need to return

Possession 
Creation 
Destruction 
My nation

Nervous Breakdown [4x] 
Take All control 
Take from my soul

The lies from myself 
feeding my soul 
leaving behind 
where Should I go

Going insane 
out of control 
away from the pain 
I'm fighting alone

They say that I can't 
be who I want 
my legion is ready 
We are coming for war
