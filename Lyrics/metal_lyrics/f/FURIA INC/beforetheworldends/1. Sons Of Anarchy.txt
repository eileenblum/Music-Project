Join the crew and let it roll
no destiny, no path to forge
Feel the fury drive to the core
destructions pistons under the hood

Yeah......

These dollars dance, more flesh more sin
fuel the flames of hellÂ´s engine
Flags of leather, balls of steel
chains and rings drive burning wheels

Face my fears on the road
just to conquer another day
Raise my fist into the air
screaming as loud as I can

Ride through the storm, ready to explode
guns and knifes take you out of the globe
Drink some booze, smoke all you can
a code of honor that you can't forget

Face my fears on the road
just to conquer another day
Raise my fist into the air
screaming as loud as I can

Take your chances till the end
there's no stop and there's no plan
For the glory of the ride
where they fall we will rise
