Seeking perfection
Chasing a lie
Feeding the vanity
We go blind

Living a nightmare
At broad daylight
Forever bound
Forever gone

Inject the opium
Estabilize
Endure the torment inside

Burst in tears
When no one's watching
Entangled in a web of lies

Bring in the cross
Bring in the nails
Bring in the martyr of those who have failed

Bring them

We made it up
It's make believe
We lost the will to face reality

We're gone astray
We lost the way
Behind the safety of this private fiction

In between these fading lines
The deaf will lead the blind

When life and fiction are the same
Nothing will remain

Inject the opium
Estabilize
Endure the torment inside

Burst in tears
When no one's watching
Lost into a maze of lies

Bring in the cross
Bring in the nails
Bring in the martyr of those who have failed

Bring them

In between these faded lines
The deaf will lead the blind

When life and fiction are the same
Nothing will remain

Face the mirror
Face yourself
Escape this private hell

Break the circle
Open wide
I's time to free your mind
