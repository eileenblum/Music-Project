[Act 1: The Ritual ]

Sacrifice
The candles lit encircle me
It ends tonight
The dagger crawls upon my skin

Infernal rites evoking shadows from beneath
Unearthly presence closing in
Swallowing the light

Death
Failed me
Won't
Abandoned
Let me lay to rest

Roam
All alone

[Act 2: The Awakening]

The restless hunger consume my mind
Extinguishing my humanity from inside
From inside
Deep inside

When the moonlight paves the way
I walk the Earth in endless night

See the dagger ripping through your soul
Silent cries
Vengeance is mine

[Act 3: Retribution]

Soulless
Predator
Stalking and lurking behind every step

Ruthless
Relentless
Dead eyes staring through an opened chest
A blood starving beast

Craving more
Blood
Starving beast

When the moonlight paves the way
I walk the Earth in endless night

See the dagger ripping through your soul
Silent cries
Vengeance is mine

Death

Won't
Let me lay to rest

Roam
All alone
