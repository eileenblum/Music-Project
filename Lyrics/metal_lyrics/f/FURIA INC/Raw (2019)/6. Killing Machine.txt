Fire and blood
That's what it takes
Strength and trust
That's what I'm made of
Determination
Over the edge
Rise in fury
'Til there's nothing left

Can you take the pressure,
Crushing down your spine?
Can you bear the agony
No hope in sight

Come taste the growing fear
Behind the enemy lines
Violence be my guide
One shot
One kill
One shot to kill

Stronger than all
Kill'em all
Hear me roar when the light goes green

Burn it all
To the ground
I am a killing machine

To fear
No one

Respect
The few

Molded by hatred
Consumed by the flame
Incinerating the one last chance

Fire

Hear the mighty tunes of war
A hymn to their lamentations

Mass destruction
The final solution

Kill with hate
Cut and maim
I will dethrone kings and queens

Forged in war
Slayer of gods
I am the killing machine

In the end, nothing but ashes shall remain
The bitter end

Violence cohabitate
In every man alive

Stronger than all
Kill'em all
Hear me roar when the light goes green

Burn it all
To the ground
I am a killing machine

Kill with hate
Cut and maim
I will dethrone kings and queens

Forged in war
Slayer of gods
I am
I am the killing machine
