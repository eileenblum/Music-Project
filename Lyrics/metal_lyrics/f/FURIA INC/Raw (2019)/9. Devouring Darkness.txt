In the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost
I'm taking over your soul

I'm the savior knocking at your door
To protect you from myself

I'm the martyr of your vainest hope
Judge, jury and the executioner

Bring'em to me
Bring it to me

Liars

Bring'em to me
Bring it to me

Lepers

Let me feast upon their innocence

Keep
Your
Head
Down

Submit yourself to me

Worship me

Kneel

My kingdom come
But not for free

Watch them crying all alone

Entertain me with your agony
Contradiction is the law

Sanctify and glorify me
Before it's too late

Feed the money hunger machine
And strengthen your faith

Keep
Your
Head
Down

You
Fucking liar

Deep inside you always knew it all
You can't deny

Laying crosses over open sores
You can't defy

Face the court of an invisible God
Faith over mind

In communion with the holy fraud
Vile... and divine

This addiction may save your soul
From eternal damnation and torture

"Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem"

Pray for salvation
Wash your sins away

"Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancti"

Fear is the key to keep them in line
Pulling the strings
Controlling their lives

Consumed
By the power of fear
Surrender your soul

Keep
Your
Head
Down

Deep inside you always knew it all
You can't deny

Laying crosses over open sores
You can't defy

Face the court of an invisible God
Faith over mind

In communion with the holy fraud
Vile... and divine
