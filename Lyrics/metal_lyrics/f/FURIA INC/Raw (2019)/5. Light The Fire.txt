How can we permit them building up so many walls
Watch them herding us like cattle
Riches from the poor

Racist shit
That make me sick
We won't take this anymore

Sexist prick
Coward dick
Now you can hear their voice

I bring the truth you can't deny
I will spread a plague you won't survive

Fear the quiet right before the storm
Feed the flame that burns inside

Watch the rising of the underdog
No more talking
Prepare for war

We got no choice
But bring the noise
We light the fire

We'll never bow
We'll stand our ground
We light the fire

Never-ending conflict
A point of no return

There's no one else to turn to
There's nowhere left to run

Spare us all your bullshit
Nothing's changed at all

Children of tomorrow
Smashing down the wall

I bring the truth you can't deny
I will spread a plague you won't survive

You
Can't
Take
Us
Down, now

Fear the quiet right before the storm
Feed the flame that burns inside

Watch the rising of the underdog
No more talking
Prepare for war

We got no choice
But bring the noise
We light the fire

We'll never bow
We'll stand our ground
We light the fire

You cannot hide behind your lies
Your kingdom gone before your eyes

The time has come for your demise
We are the plague you won't survive
