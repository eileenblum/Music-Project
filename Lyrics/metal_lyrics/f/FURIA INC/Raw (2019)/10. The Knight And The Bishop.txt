The ultimate deed of the living
Is to face the inner darkness

I
Am
Death

A pilgrim
Crusader
The righteous hand of God

Forgotten
Forsaken
Cast unto these shores

So, you've been
Beside me all this time

Watching in silence
As my days passed by

You have witnessed
All my murderous deeds

So, bear it once more
In my apostasy

Filled with fear
And doubt
Indifferent to others but me

I call out to Him in the dark
But only the silence follows

The void is a mirror
Turned to the face of men

Reflections of a wish for hereafter

The knight and the bishop
Pawns of a worthless plan

An endless search for answers

Vicious
Collector
Our only certainty

Heartless
Reminder
Of our own mortality

So, you thought
You're able to cheat death

Plotting cheap tricks
As pious final stand

Your inquisition
Such a futile campaign

For I am unknowing
In a endless game

Father
Why have you
Abandoned me?

After
All the things
I've offered unto thee?

The void is a mirror
Turned to the face of men

Reflections of a wish for hereafter

The knight and the bishop
Pawns of a worthless plan

An endless search for answers
