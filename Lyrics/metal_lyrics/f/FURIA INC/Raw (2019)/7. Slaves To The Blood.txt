When the curtain falls
And darkness fills the crimson skies

Hunger
Rising
Impossible to detain

The night grows cold
We celebrate as daylight slowly dies

Lurking
Hunting
Feasting upon the flesh

One bite
One kiss
Drink the poison

As we
Tear you apart
To bring you terror

We are slaves to the blood
We are slaves
We are slaves
We are

We are slaves to the blood
We are slaves
We are slaves
We are slaves
We are
We are slaves to the blood

I am the reaper of innocent souls
Sworn to the black
Forevermore

Mesmerized and paralyzed
You enter my domain

God forsaken
Desecrating
Reborn in the embrace

Impurity
Profanity
Now rushes through your veins

Corrupt volition
Sick addiction
By blood become a slave

Tormented soul
Inflicting pain
Condemned to suffer

Eternally

Concealed
Forever hiding
Behind the shadows

One bite
One kiss
Drink the poison

As I
Tear you apart
To bring you terror

One bite
One kiss
Drink the poison

As I
Tear you apart
To bring you terror

We are slaves to the blood
We are slaves
We are slaves
We are

We are slaves to the blood
We are slaves
We are slaves
We are slaves
We are

We are slaves to the blood
