Stray away from reality
Filled with disdain and despise

Watch the world consuming itself
Reduced existence
To a synthetic life

With pride!
They wander lost in plain sight
Struggling in vain
Against the crushing tide

Simulated source of pleasures
Artificial, re-manufactured

The eye of e-justice
Is watching you

Claim for salvation
Celebrating death

Systematize
Join the fight
For something you don't understand

Desecrate
Subjugate
The hate you hide behind the silver screen

Navigating the sea of lies
The media feeds the starving minds

A sense of injustice
Devouring you

A crucifixion
Based upon fake news

Villainize
Join the fight
For something you don't understand

Spreading hate
Human plague
No way to prevent the endless void

Force-fed

Let them hate
It's all they want
Let them hate
What they can't create

Let them judge
Let them cry
Let them run
Beyond their mamma's sight

I don't think we have room for your shit no more
You spoiled bastards

Villainize
Join the fight
For something you don't understand

Spreading hate
Human plague
No way to prevent the endless void
