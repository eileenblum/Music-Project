embrace the pain
embrace the pain
the only thing you know
just pull, just pull
just pull the fucking plug

whats keep you alive
whats saves from yourself

from anger, frustration
the pain that pulls you down

Erase your mind
erase your mind
youÂ´ve now become a lie

this lethal, infection
infernal liquid consumes you
inside

this cage of hate
you rot and waste
no sense of life
in pitch black downfall

downfall

you will be
crushed by the hand of fate,
youÂ´re drowning in your tears

surrender not an option,
something you cant forgive

rise from your ashes,
youÂ´ve been called to fight

rise from the depths
take back your life

you find yourself ready to confess
beneath the innocent silhouette

the fallen waits with the gun to his head
life will teach you to act like a snake

crushed by the hand of fate,
youÂ´re drowning in your tears

surrender not an option,
something you cant forgive

rise from your ashes,
youÂ´ve been called to fight

rise from the depths
take back your life
