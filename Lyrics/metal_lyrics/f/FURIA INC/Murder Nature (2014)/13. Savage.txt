feel... the rope around your neck

choke...you gasp for

your last breath
scream my name, you ride hard on pain
writhe,contort youÂ´re now my slave

I will summon all my deepest sins
savage incarnate,I will gorge on filth

Savage!
rapture torture
IÂ´m the savage
no law, mercy
or shame
on your knees
worship, beseech to me
I am..I am the Savage!

If you think you can take my throne
just try, IÂ´ll pay your weight in gold

Punishment, I drill you in respect
24/7 I will dominate

Savage!
rapture torture

IÂ´m the savage!

no law, mercy
or shame

Savage!
on your knees
worship, beseech to me
I am..I am the Savage!
