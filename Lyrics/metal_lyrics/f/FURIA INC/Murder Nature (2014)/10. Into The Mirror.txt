Reflecting, retracting
destroying the truth

denying existence
the image so pure

Transforming, deceiving
consumed by the fear

narcissist
by nature

Behold
my face turns to grey

so lost
the yellow brickÂ´s way

so dark
memories seem to fade

so far
like everybody's name

Gossip, retard
spreading those lies
the only reason that you keep it alive

Aggression, rejection
bring false intentions
greeted with silence

Look at me
Here on the wall
telling me anything I want

talk to me
As I speak
one step to fall into the mirror

the void

no sign of redemption, no mercy for the weak
I came to destroy, I came to defeat

You ask for salvation
at the end of the line
no more chances for beauty in disguise

cruel is vanity, now itÂ´s the time
make your choice and make it right
silent rejection youÂ´ve been denied
unleash the fury, you gonna die
