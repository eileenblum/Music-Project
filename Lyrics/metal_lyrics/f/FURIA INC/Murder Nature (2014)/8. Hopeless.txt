How much dead time
do we need to fully heal ourselves
How do we know
if we are ready to trust again

how?

how?

why can't we try
to forget the sins that wrecked our lives?

can we deny
all the evil that lives in us

letÂ´s pretend that you don't hate me
letÂ´s pretend
that you are full of love

waves of time, drag me down
oceans of memories collide

now, you find yourself alone
digging down into this hole
you didn't let it go

all your hope
your hope is gone
betrayed by impulse
you didn't let yourself go

just leave it be
is too late to know the truth

you forsake me
for everything I have done to you

letÂ´s pretend you don't hate me
letÂ´s pretend you are full of love

waves of time, drag me down
an ocean of memories collides

now, you find yourself alone
digging down into this hole
you didn't let it go

all your hope is gone
betrayed by impulse
you didn't let yourself go
