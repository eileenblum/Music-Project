defy ourselves, seeking for nothing
searching for everything that has been lost
lose ourselves to the ancient
older than 
than good and evil

"as the lavas that restlessly roll
their sulphurous currents down yaneek
in the ultimate climes of the pole"

sanctify
for what 
what I believed

purify
for I've been blind

sacrifice
to feed 
to feed the unknown

we must leave this place behind
this cursed land forgotten in time

between the sadness 
the absence of hope
in absolute confusion 
the terror posses our souls
deep in a haunted 
cursed
cursed reign
where life, death, space and time
join forces to kill and maine

human 

monstrous 

unspoken terrors

forbidden secrets

mountains of madness
take me to the abyss

mountains of madness
show me the truth

mountains of madness
take me home

god help the dreamer whose mad visions shew
those dead eyes set in crystal gulfs below

sanctify
for what 
what I believed

purify
for I've been blind

sacrifice
to feed 
to feed the unknown

we must leave this place behind
this cursed land forgotten in time

mountains of madness
take me to the abyss

mountains of madness
show me the truth

mountains of madness
take me home
