forever i will stand for this
my everlasting fight
the leader, believer,
they want to see
who you really are
my time,is the right time, shall come at any price
and no one will point the
finger to tell me whats wrong

Hey
throw your stone!
(in strife I pray)
the path is cruel and long
(feed your decay)
nothing comes easy in this world

so glorious
ferocious
don't you take me for a fool
glamour faceless
don't you see you are just tool
of plastic pleasures of moneyÂ´s tether
of your
fabricated world
the dream illusion
runs
runs everything you are

Hey
throw your stone!
(in strife I pray)
the path is cruel and long
(feed your decay)
nothing comes easy in this world
