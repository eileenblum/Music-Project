hunters will be hunted

death brings life

saints will be sinners

angels crucify

holy and profane

morph into survival
morph for my survival

I
I will control
I will defeat
the weak inside of me and you

you will submit
you will obey
dominion as it alters

time
time wont conceal
time will reveal
the weakness behind all these walls

walls of deceit
walls of disease
dominion as it alters
