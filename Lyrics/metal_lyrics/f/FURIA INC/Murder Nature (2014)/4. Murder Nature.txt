fighting for survival
fighting for pleasure

prepare for war
prepare for the last hunt

death by the sword
death by the trigger pull

soldiers playing god
making death abundant

KILL!
for religion

BURN!
for demonstration

RAPE!
for dominion

murder nature

PLAGUE!
contamination

BLOOD!
our currency

FAMINE
desolation

once we kill with clubs
now we burn with nukes

hunter killer culture
delivering death in all forms

stones and spears
grenades and flames
the reapers scythe
will cut and maine

we will obliterate
well wipe them out

fight and die until the end
carrying my flag to the grave
primal pilot engage destroy
murder nature will kill us all

this is murder nature
WeÂ´ll fight die destroy
