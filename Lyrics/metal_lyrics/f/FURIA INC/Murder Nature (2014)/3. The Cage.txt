are you feeling alone
are you feeling down

you know what you want
you want feel the rush

drop, inject, inhale
let your spirit flow

you are in the green zone
nothing can hurt you here
you are safe from the world
safe from yourself

Once inside, you realize
that you just cant control

hold your breath and start to pray
the cage wont let you go

the agony will slow the time
and play cruel tricks on your mind

sleeping all day, high night
reality comes at dawn

wake up, wake up
you must work
you need more, you need more
yes you need
you need more you need more

get a job, get a job
you must work, you must
relax your next fix is coming

this is the last time
you know, I know
fuck this

walking in circles
there's no escape

hunger that devours
kneeling by the power

destroying your brain
destroying the man

shadows in the night
dead in the morning

no name, no sign of memories
a blanked file

Under the moon the dreamer wanders
under the sun the derelict suffers

food will only
feed your eyes

the real meal is
there outside

inside the cage the chains wont break
you have to feel the rush again

consuming your flesh and your skin
bones and dust in the end
