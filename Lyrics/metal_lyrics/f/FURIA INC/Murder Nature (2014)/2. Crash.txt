Meaningless acceleration
memories twist your mind
trapped in a chain reaction
night after night

Minefield sensation
mutilation per mile
full metal projectile
nothing hits that hard

There is no pride
there is no fault
the innocent will succumb
and the guilty will prevail

Before the hammer throws the sentence
before this moment marks your soul
one irresponsible act
will change your fate
your dreams turn to ashes
your future rests in peace

There is no pride
there is no fault
the innocent will succumb
and the guilty will...

Crash!
no last goodbyes
Crash!
an violent ride
red lights and pavement

Crash!
no last Goodbyes
Crash!
an violent ride
red lights and faces

We don't care about no others
speed will show the way
adrenaline must flow through these veins
we live fast die young

one by one you know the words
decree what you want from me
this life wont replace my loss
in my heart! in my heart they will live

before the hammer throws the sentence
before this moment marks your soul
one irresponsible act
will change your fate
your dreams turn to ashes
your future rests in peace

Burn in hell!

in hell!

Crash!
no last goodbyes

Crash!
an violent ride

red lights and pavement

Crash!
no last Goodbyes

Crash!
an violent ride

red lights and faces
