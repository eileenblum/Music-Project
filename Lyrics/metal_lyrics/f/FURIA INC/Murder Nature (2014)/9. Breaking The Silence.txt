Take one good look at your life
and tell me what is wrong

Spoiling the masses
hiding the facts
the truth that they will never know

How much can you take
how much to suffocate

Dead eyes behold the pillage
profit from the sickness


Breaking the silence, screaming out!
breaking away from all the pain

Awaking the giant, set us free
back to where we belong

I am the strength deep inside
I am the burning in your heart

Searching for something they will never find
running to something until they die

This is the time to break out
in the pull of the tides
this empire will retreat

This is the time to speak out
the return of the tides
brings what we deserve

we deserve, something worst
we deserve, something to regret

my right to fight has been granted
my time to suffer has come


Breaking the silence, screaming out!
breaking away from all the pain

awaking the giant, set us free
taking the reins of fate

Riding the storm, breaking out
burning the empire down

changing the powers without remorse
back to where we belong
