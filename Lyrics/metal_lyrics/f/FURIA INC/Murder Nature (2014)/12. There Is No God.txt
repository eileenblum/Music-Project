I

bring you to your knees
obey and serve to me

take you as my slave
sanctified
by my wrath

my sons will drink the blood
and feast on the flesh

devoted is my herd
to spread the profane

in fire we purify
through pain to satisfy

the screams will be the guide
to your last confession

scream

burn

there is no god
there is no life
there is no god
there is no hope

they will take
all your creed by force

make you the martyr
of their own crusade

baptism in terror
to oppress the weak

I will sell you fear
your soul belongs to me

just kill in my name
death to infidels

there is no light
there is no savior
there is no hope
