Uncertainties of life - plaguing me
Never ending failures - are all I see
Hopeless frustration - fill me with pain
Battles and struggles - come to kill again
Lost in myself - seeking to see
Trying to be - whatâs been called of me
Falling so short - expected and seen
Bleed not in vain - he who died for me

[1st chorus]
Here on this mountain I stand crying, crying
This fallen one
I who turned my back and forgotten god
Rebellious child weary of idolâs and sin
Lord heal me again
By you alone I swear my life, the living god
Pour out your blood

Struggle and pain - left me for dying
Wanting to curse him - but him iâd not shame
So many questions - confusion betrayal
Calling for answers - in this world all will fail
To suffer to grow
Patience and hope - call to suffer this I know
Accept my burdens - carry my cross
All else is vanity - in this world all will fail

[repeat 1st chorus]

Looking back - I can still see
Darkness of those days - but now they are dead
New life filled with power - freedom and peace
A baptism of fire - to open blind eyes
Iâve stumbled - iâve fell
I fought with myself - iâll fight no more
Now I can see - a day at a time
Hope for tomorrow - bright light breaking through

[2nd chorus]
Here on his mountain I stand singing praises
This chosen one
I who changed my life and gave it to god
Rebellious child weary of idolâs and sin
Lord heal me again
By you alone I swear my life the living god
Pour out your blood

Waters of life - flowing and pure
Quench this deep thirst - restore my soul
Covered in his blood - reborn in the spirit
Comforter of promise - guide my new life
I surrender my will - and open my heart
I receive what you give - with joy iâm filled
This promise is mine - my life now given
My name again written - eternally to be with thee

[repeat 2nd chorus]
