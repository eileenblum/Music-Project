In a place darker than night
Intensive heat flames burn black
Pool of fire consuming flesh
Vapors of brimstone poisonous breath
One way in hellbound in sin
No way out scorched within
Borne of death never alive
Fallen angels hate filled eyes

Beneath the grave â demons await
Doomed to eternity â past hellâs gates

Talons rending spreading your gore
Forever receive your suffering
Eternity and torment one and the same
Revisiting your sin that plagues within
Feverish suffering forever and more
Longer than life no ending in sight
Punishment wrought blameless your not
A vessel of wrath justice prevails

Beneath the grave â demons await
Doomed to eternity â past hellâs gates

Beware and be warned your living will end
Without godâs son thereâs nowhere to hide
The empty tomb sacrifice and resurrection
Buys freedom from that painful dominion

Beneath the grave â demons await
Doomed to eternity â past hellâs gates
