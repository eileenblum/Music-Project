I walk among them
Faces reflect their needs
Shadows of what could be
Envisioning their peace

Travelling towards nothing
Imprisoned they wander
Enslaved to what befalls them
Traverse a path unknown

The eyes are the windows to the soul
Visions of oneâs condition
Tomorrow is mirrored in those orbs
The value of oneâs control
I stare into the dead eyes
Vacant of understanding
A hunger quenched within
Until the choice to awaken

A stirring in my presence
To light the proper path
Seeing joy of a babe reborn
Adopting what would be mine

Dead eyes tell my reasons
For birth, life and death
Resurrection to secure my love
From evilâs complacent grip

Today is your choice
Do not ponder long
I will be told to gather
What was purchased on the tree

Go, those who are mine
Set in motion my seeding
Harvest the weary caste
Proceed for the time is almost hereâ¦.go
