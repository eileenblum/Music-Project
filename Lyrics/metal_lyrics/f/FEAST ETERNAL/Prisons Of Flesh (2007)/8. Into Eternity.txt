Repulsive thoughts
Decaying process of the mind
You are deceived
The only way to end pain

Demonic possession
Dark forces forcing infection
Your heart hardening
Death prepares for harvest

Pull the trigger
The barrels in your throat
Grey matter escaping
The blood freely flows

Assumed rejection
God has never denied you
Prepare to burn
Only you have rejected Christ

Open blind eyes
Hold on to precious life
Receive his grace
His love eternal life
