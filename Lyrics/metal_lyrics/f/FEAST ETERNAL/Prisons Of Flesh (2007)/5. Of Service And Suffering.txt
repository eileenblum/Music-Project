I have felt the pain of life
The flesh that longs
The world that corrupts
I have felt the loneliness
Confusion in my days
Longing for my death
I hang my head
Ashamed as I weep
The anger envelops me
Grasping for the reasons that I seek

A grinding of patience
Of service and our suffering
The strength of our testimony
The witness of our walk
A grinding of patience
Of service and our suffering
Our life our witness
The testimony of our faith

The pain of life gives way
Comforter of promise cleanse the pain
Him I feel god of love cleansing blood
Guide my way
I hang my head humbly as I pray
His spirit envelops me
Reaching for his spirit, Christ redeem me
