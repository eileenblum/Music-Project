My heart sails through - a river flowing red
Result of his compassion - an offering was given
A cruciform tree floats by - remnant of the price
Scoring a tear in my soul - my being permeatesâ¦. darkness

Trenches of my sorrow - congested righteous delight
Elation replace defeat â bring forth praise
Lord god within me - hold me together inside
Keep my path steadfast - to escape drifting away

Choosing total immersion
Into the delivering flood
Currents annihilate the sin
Resurrecting what is dead

Embracing me from within â choke out my sin
Your power holds me steady - when calamity strikes again
Father of my heart - save me from the void
Lord fill my sails - your spirit be my guide

Choosing total immersion
Into the delivering flood
Currents annihilate the sin
Resurrecting what is dead
