The morning son
Rising above so high to fly
A hope so piercing
The morning sky
True as now, truer than none
Miracle prophesy
My worlds begun
To life be beckoned
The choice is free
Righteous anointed, in purity

Beautiful one, majesty
Spirit speak my name
I call to you in holy tongues
As pain passes away

Merciful master, chosen king
Great lion of Judah
Even serpents proclaim
In reverence I worship
Singing this song
Unending praise
Follow his light
Take up this fight
Till the end of my days
To life I am beckoned
My choice made free
Anoited in righteous purity
