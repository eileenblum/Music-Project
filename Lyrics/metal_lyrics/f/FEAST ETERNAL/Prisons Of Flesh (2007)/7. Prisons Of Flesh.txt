Cold fingers claw away
My cage oh so cold
This life they seek to strip away
Deep dark strangle hold
Caught in his snare, the fowler
The flame calls to my flesh
Temptation sweet like honey
Dark angels sing to my death

Overcome by darkness â falling away
Spirit broken â lifeless cold
Entangled in sin â tightening begin
To a prison of flesh â iâm thrown
Burning lust, idolatry
Iniquities speak my name
Shackles of greed weigh me down
Corrupt the truth inside
This world this flesh, destroying
Virtues fallen in disgrace
My heart broken
This life blackened

[repeat first chorus]

Once I was dead in transgression
In which I lived
Following darkness, encaged
Trapped in deathâs firm grip
Now I live so freely
Ransomed by purist blood
Set free from these chains
The reward of Christâs love

Resisting darkness â the turning away
Reach for hope â in salvation
Call on his name â throw off the chains
This prison of flesh â I escape
