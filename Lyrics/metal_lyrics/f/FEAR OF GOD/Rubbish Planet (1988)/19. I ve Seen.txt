Sitting here staring at my blood-covered hands
Thinking of nothing but what I've seen

So I went out again, tried to forget for an instant
Grabbed my victim, my work was about to begin
Why me? What did I do wrong? I've seen

I now fight the voice inside of me that wants me to do it again
Know that I must stop but it's a senseless trial
'Cause at the end it will overcome and I'll lose
And I'm out there again - why? 'Cause I've seen....
