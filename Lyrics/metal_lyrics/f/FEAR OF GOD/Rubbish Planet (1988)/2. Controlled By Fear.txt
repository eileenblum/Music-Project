Light gives birth to cold shadows
All our imaginations gone forever
Uninterrupted, the voice is in your head
The eyes are blind, you're controlled by fear

You are...controlled...by fear

A puppet that kills and cheats on command
Holy crusades in the names of light
Millions of murdered heathens mark the way
Countless defrauded people punished with civilisation

We must...control...ourselves

It's the fear of God that makes them obey
While the holy ones stab them in their backs!
