Did things he shouldn't have done
But now he really regrets
Walls around him, he knows he's never
gonna leave this room 'til he's fucking dead

So he's the fool he's gotta pay
For the faults in our society
No rehabilitation, just pain and disgust
Is he locked away from us or are we locked away from him?
