First class people, better than the mob
First class people, more equal than others!
See them sit in their first class cabinets
Painted faces smiling at those lower people
Feeling so secure, setting themselves apart
Tell me who rules the world?
First class people, greedy brainless bastards
First class people, the first to go!
