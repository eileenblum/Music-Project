When the night comes
Run Away
When the night fall calls out your name.
The lust you feel
Has cause pain
Silent in the morning light
Go home to your betrayed.

When the night comes
Run and hide
When the night falls
Get inside
It belongs to the betrayed
Who can't decide
To live or die.
Something's on their minds...
It doesn't matter
They're just killing time.
I like the way the knife feels in your back.

Words fall
Between us
Lying in the dust, no trust
Their shadows cover us.
Recite this vow together
Swear on
Our souls forever
In nothing, in no one. Can we trust

Without mercy
Without pity
We silent stalk
The streets of the city looking for you
I am betrayed. You will feel my rage
You fucking goddamn king of the world.
