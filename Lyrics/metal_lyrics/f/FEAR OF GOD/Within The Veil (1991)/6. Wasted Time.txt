Words can't say
The way I feel

Words can't save me

Faith has been broken
I'm no longer blind

Faith has been broken
Time after time

Harsh words are spoken
by those who deny
Harsh words are spoken

Lies always lies

He whispered "Be kind to me
Come kill me one more time
I'm lost in bitter rage".
Why, tell me why

Chorus
Holding on to the pain
Holding on, watch life fade
Holding on the past
Holding on, to wasted time

I can't see through delusion
Oh I'm trying

Isn't life strange
When you're living a lie.

[Chorus]
