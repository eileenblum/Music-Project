She calls out to you
From behind sin's doorway

Her 13 years have left her so calloused so diseased...

Oh still she's begging you

Like you wish your daughter would...
Half a word away
Betrayal fills her eyes

It's the sick of the unkind years...
And scars start to form

A tangled web of shame

Across her bleeding, tortured flesh...
And you want more

to take her down with you,
beneath the crimson tide.
Slip... silently... under... the... water
(remember no pain)           Lost in the rapture
You're running fast                    from the past
But it's freeze framed... you can't see what's beyond.
Her voice keeps echoing... your name... you keep remembering

The world so cold to you
You get what you gave
The world so cold it's true
When the red... turns... to... grey

[Chorus:]
When she's on her knees... she's saying a prayer  for me
And through the frenzied feed... she's saying a prayer for me
And through the waiting tide offered sanctuary... I know she's saying a prayer for me
She just needed... someone to love her...
She just needed a kind word...

Crawling, calling across your memories.
Torture you.
