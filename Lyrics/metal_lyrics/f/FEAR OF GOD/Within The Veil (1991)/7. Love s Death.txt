Whispers in the darkness
Cold lies burn like fire
Page turn slowly
Fading the flame of desire
Unholy flame of desire

You come crawling down upon your knees
Liar
You come crawling begging baby please

Love's death is a slow death
Is a Quick death
But once it's over
Fate's hand is a cold hand
Is a sly hand is the hand on your shoulder
But now you're older

You come crawling down upon your knees
Liar
You come crawling 'cause I got what you need
Liar
you come crawling begging me baby please
