Cold wars... genocide...
Slavery of man
Third world poverty...
Multimillionaires

Mass starvation, but don't be alarmed
That part of population doesn't matter much anyway.
Blood drunk like water, now no more rain
No more victims for the altar, in the temple of decay.

Watch the frightened refugee seeking sanctuary.
His government want him dead...
He has no choice.

Old woman in the gutter, barely alive
The crown turns..
looks away
The never ask why.

Why are we DECEASED?
