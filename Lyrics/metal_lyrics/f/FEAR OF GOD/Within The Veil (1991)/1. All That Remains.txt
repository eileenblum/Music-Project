Powerlines... steel webs confine, violating the brownish sky.
Hard grey smothers, earth, like cancer.
Cracks revealing, ground below broken and bleeding every seed every stone.
I've heard the promise, I feel hunger, I realize.
As time creeps over me and days are torn away.
There are no answers only bitter lies, the only voice I'm believing is the beckoning blade.

I know the feeling the loss of control
Voice of reason slips away
Eyes staring back at me
So dark, so cold
Reflecting all that remains

I know the enslaver.
I taste its poison... felt its sting deep inside.
It has mo answer, only the bitter lies but its voice I'm hearing, keep calling my name.

Who can tell the torture of the soul?
Is it wrong... tell me is it wrong... to close your eyes... to sleep forever?
