Nocturnal shades of blue dance before her eyes,
and call to me pleading please don't lie.
In her darkest hour
Emily knows
the fate of whores....
who lie down...
and swear the sacred words.

Love was just something I did to survive
Love was just something I did to get by.

Like a circus clown with her painted frown.
Sun going down and the long night begins.
Harvest
Where will you run to now?
You've betrayed all who cared.
Harvest.

[Chorus.]

It never changes,
it goes round,
and round
round.

you've got the need I got you suck me or you rot.....
