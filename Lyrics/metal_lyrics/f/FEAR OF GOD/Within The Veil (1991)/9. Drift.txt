Do you ever think about tomorrow?
Do you ever think about yesterday?
Do you ever feel sorrow?
Over what you've left drift away?

Lie alone rotting...
calling out for compassion...
far a final act...
they'll gladly pay...
You know you're just another...
broken brother...
scared sister...
No one will ever miss you
anyway.

Do you ever think about the other side?
And who's waiting for you there?
I'll be waiting for you dear.
When the suck you in.

Waiting for the door to be kicked in
Waiting for the head to hit the ground
Waiting for my heart to stop beating

Yesterday is dead and gone
Tomorrow is out of sight
It's so sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

You're lost in the drift
That's what you want isn't it?

You're lost in the drift
That's fucking tough isn't it?

You're lost in the drift
You get what you gave yes
