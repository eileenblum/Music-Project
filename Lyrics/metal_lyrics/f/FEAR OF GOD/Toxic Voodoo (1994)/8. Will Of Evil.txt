[Spoken words (Eileen Wornous):]
Lies!
Lies!
Lies!

See the swine stalking
New stranger in the town
Smell the blood pumping
Signal fires soon be burning bright
They push push push with cigarette
Burning lies into sound
Give the names you go free
You get your turn when the word gets around
It's just the will of evil
It's just the will of evil
And nothing standing in its way
Underneath the ground
Four stories down
Feeding swine have bit me
The poor me though I've done nothing wrong
They push push push with cigarette
Burning lies into sound
And spread the man made disease
Sickle cell and aids above the ground
It's just the will of evil
It's just the will of evil
And nothing standing in its way
How'd it get this way?
Is the lost one feeding in the night?
Is the lost one feeding underground?
Got to feed...
"What were you arrested for?"
"Prostitution"
...the monkeys
Who feed on...
"What are you addicted to?"
"Everything"
...the junkies
"When was the last time you fixed?"
When was the last time you fixed, you bitch!
Everything's changing [x4]
Strippers stalked and set up
Whores without a chance
They don't mind or nothing
I heard 'em singing yesterday
It's just the will of evil
It's just the will of evil
And nothing standing in its way
