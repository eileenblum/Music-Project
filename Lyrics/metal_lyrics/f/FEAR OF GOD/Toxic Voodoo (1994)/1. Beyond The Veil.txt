Remember the night that you left me
Battered and so all alone
What was the force
Did possess me
And taking me so far beyond?
So far beyond

Beyond
Beyond the veil
Beyond
Beyond the veil

Remember the power
Of darkness
Remember the strength of my will
And nothing on earth's gonna stop me
Once I am homed in for the kill

Beyond
Beyond the veil
Beyond
Beyond the veil

Yeah...
Like the unholy alliance
Between the moth and the flame
The winds of destruction still call you
You still hear them calling your name

Beyond
Beyond the veil
Beyond
Beyond the veil

So far beyond

Beyond
Beyond the veil
Beyond
Beyond the veil
