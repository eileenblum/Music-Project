Yeah
Yeah
A whore before
So punish me
I deserve it
Come on down and bring the wrath
A whore before
So punish me
I deserve it
Come on down and bring the wrath
I gave into the pleasure
With spirits I danced
I gave into the pleasure
Now I'm gone
Holy God have you mercy?
I deserve it
Bring it now and show the path
Gave into the pleasure
Some spirits lay dead
Gave into the pleasure
Now I'm gone!
Now I'm gone!
Gone!
Now I'm gone!
Now I'm gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Gone gone!
I'm gone!
Gone!
I'm gone!
Gone!
Bring it down
Gave into the pleasure
Some spirits lay dead
I gave into the pleasure
I gave into the pleasure
Have you mercy?
I deserve it
Bring it now and show the path
