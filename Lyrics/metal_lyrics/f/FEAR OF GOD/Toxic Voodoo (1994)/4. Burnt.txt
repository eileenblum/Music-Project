Through the veil of flesh
Innocence of a kind
Cast my pearls for the swine
I'm withered another day
Yeah

[Spoken words (David Koresh):]
Through the veil of flesh
Getting too late to deny
Years go by I'm so cold...
I'm bought and sold
Withered another day

(I'm bought and sold)
Burnt
Burnt
Burnt another day
Burnt
Know the enemy!
Years take us over... yeah
The years
The years take us... where we're taken over...
Again
Through the veil of flesh
Drowning in misery
Cast my pearls for the swine
I'm withered another day
And I say
Come on motherfucker
You're the enemy
Come on motherfucker
Won't be the end of me
