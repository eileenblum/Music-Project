Worms breeding... underground
Worms take you down
Worms feeding
And now you know
Worms break you down

I don't give a fuck
I don't need that luck
I don't wanna try
I don't know what's real
I don't know what to feel
I just wanna get high

Yeah I'm outta luck

I don't give a fuck
I don't wanna try
I don't know what's real
I don't know what to feel
I just wanna get high

And withdrawal is slow man
Worms breeding...all around
Worms take you down

I don't wanna get hooked
I don't wanna get took
I don't wanna cry
I don't need to kill
I don't need that thrill
I just wanna get high
I don't wanna fuck
I don't need that luck
I don't wanna die
I don't know what's real
I don't know what to feel
I just wanna get high
I wanna know...why?

And withdrawal is slow man
And withdrawal is slow!
Worms!
Worms breeding...all around
Worms take you down
I don't wanna get hooked
I don't wanna get took
I don't wanna cry
I don't need to kill
I don't need that thrill
I just wanna get high
I don't need your fuck
I don't need that luck
I don't wanna die
I don't know what's real
I don't know what to feel
I just wanna get high
And withdrawal is slow man
"Bring it down"
Yeah
Come on
Calm down
Bring it on down
Damage took a destiny
It's over, oh yeah?
"When you've taken all you can take
Then it can be over, oh yeah"
Come on!
Calm down
Bring it on down
Yeah...
