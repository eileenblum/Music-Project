Download in her face!
Lord... the fear's alive
Get up won't you see
Fool... on your knees...
Now get down and crawl
Get through the night
A new city
Not to bleed
No more to give pity
Other three were just waiting
So sure...gonna die
Feed boys take a bite
Eat my skin
God damn out of their minds again
Feel fine off the wagon
All nightmare
Feed time feast my flesh
By the ones I've hated
Are you one I should resist?
Everything's changing
Look what we've become
Everything's changing
Look what we've become
Then you cry wolf again
Then always...run and hide
You've been praying on your knees again
That I...won't survive
Feed boys take a bite
Eat the skin
Drive them out of their minds again
I feel fine off the wagon
All night man
Feed time feast my flesh
By the ones I've hated
