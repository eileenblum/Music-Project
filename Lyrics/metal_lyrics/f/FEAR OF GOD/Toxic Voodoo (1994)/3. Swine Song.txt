Mine... is redemption
And I... have waited for so long
Nigh is redemption
And I've waited for so long
The seven ways to sorrow
I must leave behind
The lie I lived had me so low, so long
The words of the swine keep raping me
"I must submit, I must deny"
No!

Mind is dying faster than the stone
Waiting for an answer
Getting old
Do you feel anger?
Will you ever know?
Waiting for an answer never told

Now my heart is beating faster...
(Far away from what I'm after)
Nigh is redemption
And I have waited for too long
The seven ways to sorrow
I have left behind;
And the lie I lived had me so long, so low
The worms and the swine I no longer hear
I must admit I feel fine!

Mind is dying faster than the soul
Waiting for an answer
Getting old
Do you feel anger?
Will you ever know?
Waiting for an answer
Never told?
