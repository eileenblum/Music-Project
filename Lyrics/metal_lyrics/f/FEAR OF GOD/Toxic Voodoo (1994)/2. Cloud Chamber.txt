Lost among the lonely
Deep as ocean wide
I mention the unfolding
And they suck at my disgrace
I am damaged now and showing
And vultures fill the skies
And sizing up my desperation
It smells like something's died
Even now
When I'm alone
I'd scream but I'm afraid...
I'm afraid...
Only devil's arms to hold me
They seem an ocean wide
Can't you hear me?
Don't you know that I'm sinking?
As the cloud chamber starts to rise
Your love's in vain
When it comes down
Give us complete surrender
Your love's in vain
But baby don't wait too long
No! Baby don't wait too long!
Only devil's arms to hold me
Inside something has died
I can't feel you near
I don't know what I'm thinking
Cloud chambers in my eyes
No religion
No salvation
No redemption
Cause nothing matters
Your love's in vain
When it comes down
Give us complete surrender
Your love's in vain
When it comes down
Give in complete surrender
Your love's in vain
