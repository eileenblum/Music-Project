Why? Why? Why?
Black heart rise
In the fog of waking dream
Crawling from the face you fear
Life ain't really what it seems
Living on your hands and knees
It takes you over
Over and over
You come so near
Bitter and older
The pictures clear
Where were you
When the worthless came?
Brought a new
Bitter world of shame
Every night a broken dream
In the sun avoid a mirror
"You're the only one to blame"
Spreads across the face of fiends
Who take you over
Over and over
The sacrifice in vain
The demon feels no hunger
Til he smells the blood in your veins
Would you like to see it...
From the corner of all sides?
Would you believe it?
Human sacrifice
Would you like to see it...
From the corner of all sides?
Would you believe it?
Human sacrifice
Would you like to see it
From the corner of your mind?
Would you like to be my
Human sacrifice?
Why? Why? Why?
