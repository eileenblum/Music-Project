Used to be the poser
Fearing the pit
Now you're in the middle
Thrashing around enjoying every hit

Addicted to the chaos
You hit the floor
Just the way you like it
Up again and coming back for more

[Pre-Chorus]
The sound will make you act insane

[Chorus]
Bleed!
Bleed for me evil thrasher
Do you have what it takes?
Moshoholic or just a fake?
You have to scream
Scream for me bloody mosher
Let us hear your voice
Come on and make some roaring noise

You release aggression
Out of control
Now you're addicted
Dictator of the pit you have found your role

Now amongst equals
And it feels right
Just what you desire
Frolicking around in a mosh delight

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

You must scream!

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
