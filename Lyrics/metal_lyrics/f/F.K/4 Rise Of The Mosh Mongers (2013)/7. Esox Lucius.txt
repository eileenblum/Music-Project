Gone fishing, gone for good
There's a new killer in the neighbourhood
Fresh water, fresh meat
A predator you cannot defeat

Evil assassin, lurks in the dark
He is faster than the shark
You will never stand a chance
Against decades of nature's advance

[Chorus]
You will catch him face to face and eye to eye
You will fight him but you will die

He's the new ruler of the sea
On a merciless killing spree
Getting ready to invade
Cuts flesh like a blade

Dip your feet in if you dare
He's the master of rip and tear
You and your demise will merge
When his power starts to surge

[Chorus]
You will catch him face to face and eye to eye
You will fight him but you will die
You will catch him but you'll realise too late
All this time you were a bait

He's as deadly as he looks
A carnivore with teeth like hooks
This killer will leave his mark
And drag you into the dark

Going down, losing the fight
He is terror, the ultimate fright
He will strip you to the core
Your remains washed ashore

[Chorus]
