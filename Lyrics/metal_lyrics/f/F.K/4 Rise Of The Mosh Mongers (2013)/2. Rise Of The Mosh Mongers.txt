Done dwelling, welcome back
Domination, your world will crack
Ripping and tearing, rumble and pound
Attacked with force, blown to the ground

Hear our chant, four for all
Horror metal horde will stand tall
An army like soldiers a million strong
That never asks for right or wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Rise!
And join the mosh crusade
We rise
We're the horror metal brigade

Licensed and trained so step aside
Moshoholics nationwide
Merchants of mosh, the thrashing elite
An unholy power, roaming the streets

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Come forth and give heed
And listen to our creed
Come forth all those in need
And join the superior breed
We'll march to the top and we will never stop
Until we see you bleed
So rise, mongers of mosh!
Death is guaranteed

Here to crash your humble abode
We light the fuse and watch it explode
The four moshmen in command
We hold your future in our hands

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

We pledge allegiance to the flag of the moshoholics
And to the republic for which it stands, one nation
Under F.K.Ã., indivisible, with horror and metal for all

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
