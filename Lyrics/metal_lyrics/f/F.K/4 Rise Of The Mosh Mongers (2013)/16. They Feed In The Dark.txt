It's near dark, time to feed
In your veins, what they need
Force them back but not for long
They'll attack, their hunger is strong

Pray for light but it's too late
Useless fight, it's your fate
In pure spite they will return
And tonight you will burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Blood - their demand
Thirst - their motivation
Light - their enemy
Darkness - their feeding ground

[Chorus]
There's nowhere to run
When they come to kill the sun
Watch the mayhem commence
You won't stand a chance
When they feed in the dark

Suckers unite, coming for you
Just one bite, become one too
Test you will, feeling strange
Show your skills, psychotic change

Getting strong, devour the night
See no wrong, blood in sight
It's your turn you're now undead
Time to learn, go for the red

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
