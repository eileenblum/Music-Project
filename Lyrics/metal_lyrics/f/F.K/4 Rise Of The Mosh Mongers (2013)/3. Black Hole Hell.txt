Welcome to Dr. Weir's creation
A behemoth from another dimension
State of the art interstellar terror
Infinite space means infinite horror

Instantly it folds space
A gateway to an unknown place
A demon vessel with a curse
The black in the gulf of the universe

[Pre-Chorus]
They...
They cannot avoid, the never-ending end
They will be destroyed, transcend

Watch the crew on Lewis and Clark
Heading for the darkest of dark
Led to the slaughter like sheeps
Going off the deep end, a quantum leap

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Enter the home of the devil
Into the womb of fear
Enter a void of the evil
Submerged in the darkest sphere

Confronting ghosts of the past
Hallucinate, this hell will last
Pain comes like a flash flood
Rivers of fire and oceans of blood

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Into the black hole hell

Hallucinate
It's their gruesome fate
Only pain is real in this reality
Mutilate
Now it's too late
They are lost and will face inhumanity
Rip, tear
It's fuelled by their fear
Powered by their sheer insanity
Kill, shred
Their blood runs red
Hell awaits for all eternity

[Chorus]

Into the black hole hell
