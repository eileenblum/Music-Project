An expedition to the eerie cold
To unveil a story never told
Beyond a range of mountains high
And the secrets they behold

Horrific sites before their eyes
Bleak realm of death and ice
A gateway to an unknown world
Hidden under darkened skies

[Pre-Chorus]
Creators of life - elder things
Progenitors of mankind - evil kings
Creators of fear - elder things
Enter the darkest sphere
Where the evil kings rule

[Chorus]
At the mountains of madness
The will lose their minds
At the mountains of madness
Too much to comprehend
The ancientsreveal their secrets
Never meant for mankind
At the mountains of madness
Sanity will die

These barren peaks of mystery
Holds a secret of treachery
A world 40 million years dead
Is in charge of their destiny

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

They will never understand
The sight of forces in command

[Chorus]
