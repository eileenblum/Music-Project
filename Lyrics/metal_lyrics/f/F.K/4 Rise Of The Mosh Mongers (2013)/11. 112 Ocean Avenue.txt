Strange manifestations
In a dream house, possessed
Life becomes a nightmare
It does not want them there

[Pre-Chorus]
In for the kill, Amityville
Blood it will spill, Amityville

Swarms of flies
A premonition of things to come
Demonic forces in the walls
Green slime oozing in the hall

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
112 Ocean Avenue
Built on evil ground and it's coming for you
There is no one to blame because you already knew
112 Ocean Avenue
Get the hell out and never look back
Just bolt for the door 'cause there's no time to pack

A building that hosts
Evil forces from the unknown
3:15 the time to kill
Time to obey the demons will

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Filled with fear
Evil lurks everywhere
End is near
But why?
Find the well
It's the passage to hell
Break the spell
Or die

[Chorus]
