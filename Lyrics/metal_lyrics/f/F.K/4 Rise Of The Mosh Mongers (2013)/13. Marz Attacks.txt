On certain nights
When the moon is full
The maniac farmer
Will come for your skull

A demented menace
That lurks in the dark
He's seeks revenge
And he will leave his mark

A mass serial killer
Enter his domain
You're all doomed
And you will be slain

Call out his name
Death is guaranteed
You're on his list
Get whacked and start to bleed

[Pre-Chorus]
A madman with an axe to grind
A backwoodsman out of his mind

Damage will be done
Anger's on the rise
A murderous psycho
Pure hate in his eyes

An ugly craving beast
He will slaughter and maim
Reeks of rotten flesh
Madman Marz is his name

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
The axe will drop
He'll never stop
No mercy!
When Marz attacks

When you least expect
You will feel his spite
A predator deformed
Creature of the night

A hunter in the shadows
Out to crush you all
He's stark raving mad
And he's having a ball

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
