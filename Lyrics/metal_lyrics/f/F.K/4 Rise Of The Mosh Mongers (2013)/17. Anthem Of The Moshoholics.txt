This is not the end, no, we have just begun
We will come for you and you will run

There is no escaping, you can never hide
But we're quite sure you'll like what we provide

[Chorus]
We are the moshoholics
The amry of four
Here to wage a metal war
Rise moshoholics!
Settle the score
Shock the earth down to its core

We'll restore disorder, the tables we will turn
The world you know will slowly crash and burn

You will leave behind the world we all once knew
With pride you'll join the horror metal crew

[Chorus]

Mosh!

Feel the tension build getting ready to attack
Stand your ground and never fall back
Onward into battle it's time to aggress
The world we'll repossess

Surrender to the sound of the quadruple thrash treat
Four in the air and march to the beat
A brave new world under a blood red sky
Where posers will forever die
