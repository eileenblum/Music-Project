You seek pleasant dreams
That's not what I provide
Love to hear your painful screams
You're Jekyll, I am Hyde

Exit sandman, I'm for real
Here to break your stride
It's your innocence I steal
And there's nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
So you see, you created me
The scource of your mental clash
It's you and me in eternity
I'm a nightmare made thrash

Your the maggot, I'm the hook
I'm the pain inside your head
Step aside and take a look
Are you alive or are you dead?

You will never live your dream
Your nightmare is here
When I unveil my evil scheme
And your insanity is near

[Chorus]

Fright!
Of morbid visions that haunts you in the night
Dread!
The possibility that you might wake up dead
Phobia!
What made you think that your dreams would be utopia?
Anxiety!
Will make you face your own mortality

[Chorus]
