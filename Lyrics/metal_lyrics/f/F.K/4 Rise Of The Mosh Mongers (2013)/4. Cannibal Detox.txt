Got an urge I can't control
When I see you I see meat
I'm so pleased to have met you
Main ingredient in my stew

You're the meat to please me
Just the way I want it
The human flesh is my treat
Hell, I'll even eat your feet

[Chorus]
Meat!
Off to a party, I know how it ends
Me left alone to feast on my friends
Greet!
A cannibal detox is what I really am
But tha human meat, it's such a treat

I will not lie, I cannot deny
My need for marrow and blood
The taste of flesh is what I crave
Fresh or from the grave

Call me sick or even insane
Try to bring me down in vain
I really can't control my need
All I know, it's time to feed

[Chorus]

I'll eat it raw or I'll eat it cooked
Doesn't matter much to me as I am totally hooked

[Chorus]
