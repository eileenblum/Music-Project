New year's eve, it's party time
They once committed a dreadful crime
Driving poor Kenny quite insane
So tonight they will die on a train

It all started three years ago
A party prank hitting an all time low
Fooled by the college fraternity
Thought he would lose his virginity

[Pre-Chorus]
The boys and girls of Sigma Phi
Some will live and some will die

[Chorus]
Terror train
Tonight they'll lose their lives on the
Terror train
Tonight he's going off the rails on the
Terror train
Tonight they'll lose their precious lives on the
Terror train
Tonight he's going off the rails

Now he's back to make them pay
Just need to make the pain go away
Just one kiss from pure insanity
A kiss from Alana, the eternity

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

New year's eve, it's party time
They once committed a dreadful crime
They drove poor Kenny quite insane
And now they will dia, on a train

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

On the terror train
