Out of the pit, thrashed and abused
Is where our story begins
We pack up our gear and get ready to roll
The nightmare returns

'Cause sometimes they come back
To mosh
With fire in our eyes
And bloodsoaked hands we've come
To mosh
Fueled by revenge
And a diehard belief we're back
To mosh
Down on your knees 'cause we command you all
To mosh
And lay down your souls to the gods
Mosh n' roll

Back in the game
We've been gathering strength
Planning our sinister plot
The devil himself has nothing on us
In hell he can stay and rot

Bonded by blood and Freddy's revenge
Our mission begins to unfold
A journey through terror, a trip to hell
Our tale will be told

Sometimes they come back
To mosh
With fire in our eyes
And bloodsoaked hands we've come
To mosh
Fueled by revenge
And a diehard belief we're back
To mosh
Down on your knees
 'Cause we command you all
To mosh
And lay down your souls to the gods
Mosh n' roll

Mosh

Sometimes they come back
To mosh
With fire in our eyes
And bloodsoaked hands we've come
To mosh
Fueled by revenge
And a diehard belief we're back
To mosh
Down on your knees
 'Cause we command you all
To mosh
And lay down your souls to the gods
Mosh n' roll
