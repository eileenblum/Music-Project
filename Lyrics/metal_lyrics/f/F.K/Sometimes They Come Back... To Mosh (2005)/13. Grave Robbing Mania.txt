I'll tell you a story about a girl
Her name was Karen Greenlee
She had a taste, quite bizarre

Grave robbing mania
Corpse fuck insania

She liked having sex with young men
What's so strange with that
I hear you ask
Well you see, she preferred the dead

Grave robbing mania
Corpse fuck insania

Hey hey hey
You know what they say
Dead guys don't say no
If it ain't stiff it ain't worth a fuck
Hey hey hey
You know what they say
Dead guys don't say no
If it ain't stiff it ain't worth a fuck

Grave dancer, corpse romancer
Lover of the dead and decaying flesh
The stench of cadavers get's her wet

Grave robbing mania
Corpse fuck insania

Karen was a different kind of girl
Freshly deceased was her hor' durves
She'd lick them, taste them
And fuck 'em dry

Grave robbing mania
Corpse fuck insania

Hey hey hey
You know what they say
Dead guys don't say no
If it ain't stiff it ain't worth a fuck
Hey hey hey
You know what they say
Dead guys don't say no
If it ain't stiff it ain't worth a fuck

What does it take to fuck a corpse?
Ask Karen, she knows, of course
What kind of protection is her choice?
Whatever it is he won't make a noise

Hey hey hey
You know what they say
Dead guys don't say no
If it ain't stiff it ain't worth a fuck
Hey hey hey
You know what they say
Dead guys don't say no
If it ain't stiff it ain't worth a fuck
