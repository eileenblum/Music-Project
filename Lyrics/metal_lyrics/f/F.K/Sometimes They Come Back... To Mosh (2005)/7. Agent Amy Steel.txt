Back in the days we first sighted
Her shields gleaming bright up in the sky
Now the day is getting so much closer
She will return for the masses to see

You can't stop her, she's already coming
Too late, no hiding
She's an unstoppable force
You can't stop her, she's already coming
Too late, no hiding, mistress of mosh
Agent Amy Steel

With reflexes faster than light
Her power will crush you all
Posers and wimps
Die by the hand of Womanowar
With her disciples of metal and mosh
She will end the war
The day has come
She's back to reign
And even the score

She will take you by force and brutally rape you
Pumping horror metal into your head
She's the bringer of pain, you the receiver
Split your dick with a cleaver
And leave you for dead

You can't stop her, she's already coming
Too late, no hiding
She's an unstoppable force
You can't stop her, she's already coming
Too late, no hiding, mistress of mosh
Agent Amy Steel
