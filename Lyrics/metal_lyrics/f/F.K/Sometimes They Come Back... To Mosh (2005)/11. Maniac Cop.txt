All dressed up in blue and white
He surely will kill tonight
With pride he wears the badge of silence
He'll give you a lesson in violence
Most terrifying man in the city
With no remorse and no pity
Just the urge to go out and kill
He's homicidal and kill he will

No one knows his name
Just that he is quite insane
No one knows his face
He's the maniac cop

Back from the dead, he seeks revenge
The urge to kill will never change
This cop will never read your rights
You're about to die tonight
Don't even have to break the law
Make you draw your final straw
It's all metal, blood and honour
You're soon to become a goner

No one knows his name
Just that he is quite insane
No one knows his face
He's the maniac cop

He stalks the streets of New York
Spreads terror through the night
He strikes without mercy, without cause
When a cop turns killer you have the right
To remain silent forever

No one knows his name
Just that he is quite insane
No one knows his face
