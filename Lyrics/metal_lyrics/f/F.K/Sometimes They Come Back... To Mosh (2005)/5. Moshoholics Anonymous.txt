Strapped in this room, I'm starting to itch
I've been clean for a couple of years
It's always at night the taunting begins
I have to get it off my mind
An addict, a junkie, call me what you want
But moshoholic fits the profile
Unexplainable urges to thrash it out
Is what I battle night and day

Do you wanna mosh?
Then mosh
Do you wanna thrash?

If you need to mosh
Call the moshoholics anonymous
Really need to mosh
The moshoholics anonymous

Here we unite and share our addiction
A sanctuary for the enslaved
In horror metal mosh you're never alone
We're all as metal moshing mad as it gets
So come on inside and join in the pit
We ain't shy when the metal begins
There's a new album we're playing tonight
It's called sometimes they come back to mosh

Do you wanna mosh?
Then mosh
Do you wanna thrash?

If you need to mosh
Call the moshoholics anonymous
Really need to mosh
The moshoholics anonymous
If you need to mosh
Call the moshoholics anonymous
Really need to mosh
The moshoholics anonymous

Let's mosh

If you need to mosh
Call the moshoholics anonymous
Really need to mosh
The moshoholics anonymous
If you need to mosh
Call the moshoholics anonymous
Really need to mosh
The moshoholics anonymous
