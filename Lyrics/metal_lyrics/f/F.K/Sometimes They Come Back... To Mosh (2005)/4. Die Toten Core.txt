Adaptable to battle conditions anywhere
Able to kill with their bare hands
Waiting at the bottom of the sea, in silence
Creatures with an innate desire for violence

From beyond the dead they rise
From beneath the depths of hell
From the bottom of the ocean
Thousand rise

Die toten core
Die toten core
Die toten core
Die toten core

The third Reich had created the perfect soldier
Now awakening from their watery slumber
Unholy, unliving, unfeeling, unstoppable creatures
Genetically engineered aquatic Nazi zombies

From beyond the dead they rise
From beneath the depths of hell
From the bottom of the ocean
Thousand rise

Die toten core
Die toten core
Die toten core
Die toten core

Die toten core
Die toten core
Die toten core
Die toten core

Die toten core
Die toten core
Die toten core
Die toten core
