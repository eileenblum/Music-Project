Hideous and hungry
Indecent and obscene
Ferocious, carnivorous
Slobbery and mean
Disfigured and deformed
They crawl, they breed
Rotting and raving
They hunger, they need

Find them in the attic or the cellar
Find them anywhere
But the place they prefer
Is in my evil Ã¼nderwear
They're a different kind of breed
And their hunger is strong
Better kiss your lucky star
I'm not wearing a thong

Cannibalistic humanoid underwear dwellers
C.H.Ã.D, C.H.Ã.D.
Ugly, slobbering, ferocious and carnivorous

C.H.Ã.D, C.H.Ã.D.
Ugly, slobbering, ferocious and carnivorous

Monstrous and malicious
Toxic and unclean
Inhuman, inbreed, red and green
Disfigured and deformed
They crawl, they breed
Rotting and raving
They hunger, they need

Your worst nightmare is
Living where the sun don't shine
In the dark is where they hide
Waiting for the night to come
Flesh-eating, crusty creatures
Living in your knickers
There's no goddamn way in hell
You can stop these evil critters

Beware beware of the Ã¼nderwear
