Enshrouded by a strange fog
Driving the ship into the bay
There's a fire in the swirly mist
They think they are saved
Heading towards the light
Lured into a certain death
They crash into the rocks
And the wreckage sinks

Marine marauders
Rising from the swirly mists
Marine marauders
Hides behind an evil fog
Marine marauders
You cannot stop this captain
And his twisted wicked force

Down at the bottom of the sea
Lay Elisabeth Dame with it's crew
Lungs filled with salty water
Staring into the darkness
Binding their time, 'cause they know
When the fog rolls in again
They will finally get their revenge
On the people who betrayed them

Marine marauders
Rising from the swirly mists
Marine marauders
Hides behind an evil fog
Marine marauders
You cannot stop this captain
And his twisted wicked force

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Captain Blake and his crew
Are back to slay
Seeking revenge
On the town of Antonio Bay
Lock your doors
And close your windows
What you can't see
Won't hurt you
It will kill you

This seemingly perfect little town
Masks a guilty secret
A sleepy seaside village with a past
Steeped in murder and greed
Now they will learn the true meaning
Of the word vengeance
These pissed off mariners have returned
From their watery grave

Marine marauders
Rising from the swirly mists
Marine marauders
Hides behind an evil fog
Marine marauders
You cannot stop this captain
And his twisted wicked force

Marine marauders
Rising from the swirly mists
Marine marauders
Hides behind an evil fog
Marine marauders
You cannot stop this captain
And his twisted wicked force
