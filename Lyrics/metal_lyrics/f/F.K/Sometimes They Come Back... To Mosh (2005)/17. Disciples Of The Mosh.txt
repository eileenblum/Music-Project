Horror metal men and woman unite
With wimps and posers we'll start up a fight
But this is a battle we cannot lose
Cause F.K.Ã. rules the world tonight

Mosh pit bombs come together as one
No wimps or posers when we are done
All unite bang in the same direction
Mosh and thrash 'til global perfection

Disciples of the mosh, obey
Disciples of the mosh

March to the kingdom of F.K.Ã.
The pit is right here waiting for you
Now is the time to dive in
To become a thrashin' assassin

F.K.Ã. CrÃ¼, coming for you
F.K.Ã. CrÃ¼, what will you do?

Yes we know our fans are insane
A moshing horde built for pain
Once we start to mosh they will never stop
Enjoying our good friendly violent game

Love us or hate us we just don't care
You're welcome into the pit if you dare
With amps cranked up to eleven
You will go deaf or enter horror metal heaven

Disciples of the mosh, obey
Disciples of the mosh

March to the kingdom of F.K.Ã.
The pit is right here waiting for you
Now is the time to dive in
To become a thrashin' assassin

F.K.Ã. CrÃ¼, coming for you
F.K.Ã. CrÃ¼, what will you do?

With Agent Amy Steel on our side
It's time for you to decide
Moshers take your stand and obey
Our horror metal command
