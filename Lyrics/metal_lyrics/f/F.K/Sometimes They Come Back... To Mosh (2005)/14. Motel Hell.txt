Meat snacks and jerky treats
What's the secret ingredient?
Meat's meat and a man's gotta eat
You breathe the gas and we get the laugh

It takes all types of critters
To make farmer Vincent's fritters

Visit this tasty place if you dare
Your vocal chords are slit on command
Buried up to your neck
And then force fed
Seasoned to prepare you
For his roadside stand

It takes all types of critters
To make farmer Vincent's fritters

Welcome to Motel Hell
We'll cook and serve you well
