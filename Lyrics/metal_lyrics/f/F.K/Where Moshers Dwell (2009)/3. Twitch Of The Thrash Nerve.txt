Synchronize your thrashing
With our moshoholic sound
Endless slashing and bashing
When F.K.Ã. comes to town

Engaging on full power
Heading for overload
Said you had enough but you lied
Bang your head, ready to explode

[Pre-Chorus:]
Our moshoholic breed will exceed your need!

[Chorus:]
We seek, we aim and then we fire
You'll get what you deserve
Your need to thrash is dire

We seek, we aim and then we fire
You'll get what you deserve
Your need to thrash is dire
It's a twitch of the thrash nerve

Reckless devastation
The answer to your desire
Thrashing with pure aggression
Never slow down, never tire

Moshing like a maniac
There's nothing that can stop you
Causing a massive heart attack
But dead thrashers mosh too

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

There is nowhere to hide
It's a spreading nationwide
A new world order
Extreme moshover
A new era is born
Fist bang and devil horn
They're just poor substitutes
For the four finger salute

So put them in the air
And swear allegiance to the Ã¼nderwear
Congregate, moshers stand strong
And sing along

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
