Another return from the masters of fright
Time has come to enter the mosher's delight
The nightmare dominion that posers fear to tread
Doesn't matter if you're alive or already dead
Come dear moshoholics, obey our evil sound
The aura of true horror and metal all around
Freddy's dream team, Larry, Pete, Ted and Pat
The unholy four are gathered for attack

[Pre-Chorus:]
Adrenaline pumping through your veins
As your body prepares for the pain
The Horror Metal CrÃ¼ will grind you down

[Chorus:]
Warning! Mosh zone ahead
One mistake, you're dead
Running to avoid our third attack
Too late, there is no turning back

A deadly invitation to the ride of your life
You have to walk the line, the four edged knife
Your thrashing skills are judged and taken to the test
Time to join the pit and find out who's the best
Intensity builds, maximum terror soon obtained
Masters of our trade, horror metal sustained
Never quit, never gonna change our evil ways
'Cause we will thrash you 'til the end of days

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Blistering Lead]

We'll take you on a trip you'll never forget
No stop signs, heading for the pit
Grab a ticket to our show of
Mayhem, blood and pain
It's the pedal to the horror
Metal Moshing Mad again

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
