Chuck [x5]

[Chorus:]
Sleepwalker Texas Ranger
If you're an unsuspected stranger
You're in grave danger
Cause he's Chuck out of luck

He wakes up all drenched in sweat
Lost mission to serve and to protect
Blood on his hands, hat on his head
He is the law but he's no Judge Dredd

Chuck [x5]

[Chorus]

Can't take it, life off-screen really does suck
Narcolepsy, in his character he's stuck
Hitting the streets night after night
Kicking and jumping and fighting the fight

Chuck [x5]

Out of luck
