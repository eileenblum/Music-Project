We're all gathered in this room,
Six sinners one deciever
Good ol' Pal Pazuzu brought
Some hot winds and some fever
Father Merrin's in the kitchen fixing up a drink
Father Karras had too many, puking in the sink

[Chorus:]
All you faithless slime
This, this is the night
Now, now is the time
Time to desecrate

Lookout! Here comes Regan
Riding on her flying bed
She look right at you
And she starts to spin her fuckin' head
Hot and horny wants to get
It on with him tonight
There's no way the son of God
Can win this fuckin' fight

[Chorus]
