Welcome to your nightmare
Where life will end in pain
First you meet your maker
Then you go insane

A dark mansion of metal
Will be your last domain
In this house of F.K.Ã.
Four evil forces reign

[Pre-Chorus:]
Slashing
Thrashing
Moshing
...'Til death

[Chorus:]
This is where mosh pits grow
Where you thrash and die real slow
You are just south of hell
Welcome to where moshers dwell

Call him daddy Freddy
To him you must obey
Best to treat him nicely
Or you will be his pray

You must know Jason Voorhees
We gave the boy a home
Still the man behind the mask
In here he will roam

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

In our boiler room supreme
No one else can hear you scream
It's not heaven it's not hell
This is it, where moshers dwell

Watch for Michael Myers
He likes to play with knifes
Not a fan of trick or treat
But of ending lives

We hope that you will like it
Your nightmare has come true
Pinhead, Spinell, Leatherface
They're all part of our CrÃ¼

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
