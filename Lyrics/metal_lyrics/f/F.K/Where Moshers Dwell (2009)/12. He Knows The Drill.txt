Apartment complex under siege
Hot young tenants living in fear
A masked maniac on a killing spree
Beware of his home improvement gear

[Chorus:]
Drill! He knows the drill
There's oceans of blood to spill
Kill! He needs to kill

It's shredding time!

The ski-masked sadist's on his way
The hack 'n slash handyman
Pure evil, here to slay
Crush and maim whenever he can

[Chorus]

Some shredding to be done!

He's a son of a nail-gun
He knows his way around
The second floor apartments
His favorite hunting ground

[Chorus]

Some shredding to be done!
