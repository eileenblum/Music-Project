Beware of his six-string attack
He's no ordinary Joe Six-Pack
Faster than you'll ever live to be
Riff meister to a deadly degree

Humanuclear device, fuming with rage
He's Radiation Joe, breaking the cage
Hey! Stand back! The right decision
There's no way you'll win this competition

[Chorus:]
Turn out the light and watch him glow in the dark
You may as well accept he's faster than the shark

Commander of the powersurge
Dictator of the metal church
Watch him reach critical mass
Forcing metal up your ass

Unknowingly blessed, his licks unfolds
Supercharged, unveil the power he holds
Unearthly shredding, so it shall be done
He'll take it to the limit going defcon 1

[Chorus]

A guitar demon, showing no mercy
Finger-tapping frenzy and whammy-bar abuse
Stunning your senses, blinding your eyes
First comes submission, then you die

[Radioactive lead]

[Chorus]
