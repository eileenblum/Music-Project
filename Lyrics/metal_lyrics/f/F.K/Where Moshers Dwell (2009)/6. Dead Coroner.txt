Dead and buried, there's no guarantee
In potters bluff there's no real R.I.P.
Introducing William Dobbs, mortician
Serving the dead in the time of need

In this town there are dead men walking
There's always a body ready at hand
Black magic or a medical breakthrough?
Re-animated corpses under his command

[Chorus:]
Sadistic mentor
Morbid inventor
The re-animator of life
An artist with the knife
Dead coroner

Murder as art, corpse painter supreme
People here never end up in an urn
Death's just the beginning of his evil scheme
Can't kill his children, they always return

Need them disfigured to work his skills
People check in and corpses check out
He's the mastermind behind the kills
A real life puppet master, no doubt

[Chorus]
