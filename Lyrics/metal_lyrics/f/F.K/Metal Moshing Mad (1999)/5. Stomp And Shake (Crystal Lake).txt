The man behind the mask
To slaughter and to maim that is his task
Innocent youth down the lake
Mother says their lives he's gotta take
One thing you cannot trust
Is a man with a machete in his hand
Get the fuck out, he's not a goalkeeper
It's Jason Vorhees with an urge to kill

[Chorus]
STOMP AND SHAKE! Down at Crystal Lake
STOMP AND SHAKE! Down at Crystal Lake

Down at Crystal Lake, down at Crystal Lake

[Repeat 2nd Verse]
[Repeat 1st Verse]

[Chorus x2]

Down at Crystal Lake, down at Crystal Lake
Down at Crystal Lake, down at Crystal Lake.. Lake!
