Escaped again, on the loose
Out to have some fun
He invites you all to a Halloween party
Boy, you'd better run
The food is great and the drinks are strong
The stereo is playing F.K.Ã.!!!
What you don't know, is you should go
Cause he's gonna kill you

[Chorus]
Michael Myers, TRICK OR TREAT!
At his party there's a lot to eat
Michael Myers, TRICK OR TREAT!
At his house there's a lot of meat
Dr. Loomis will loose again
There's no way to stop The Shape
Samhain made, made him strong
There's no way in hell he's wrong
Behind the mask a sad little boy
His name is Michael Myers
That big old knife is his favourite toy
Slice that pumpkin, slice that man

[Chorus]
[Lead Pete]
[Chorus]

Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
