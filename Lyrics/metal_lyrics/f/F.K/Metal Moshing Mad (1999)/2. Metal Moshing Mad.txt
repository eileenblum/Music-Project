In the name of metal, in the name of mosh
The hordes of evil gather for a bash
Joining all together to explode as one
The moshing pit is where to we all run
We love the horror metal we love the sound of mosh
We love the crunching riffs that defines thrash
The amps are on full power the drums being to pound
The night of metal madness has arrived
You wanna mosh? Then mosh!
You wanna thrash? Go ahead and thrash!

[Chorus:]
METAL METAL METAL! Metal moshing mad
METAL METAL! Metal moshing mad
METAL METAL! Metal moshing mad
Metal moshing mad

In the name of Freddy, four fingers in the air
Get into the mosh pit if you dare
Feel the power rising, adrenaline exploding
Be sure to see us when we're on the road!
You wanna mosh? Then mosh!
You wanna thrash? Go ahead and thrash!

[Chorus x2]
I wanna see you mosh for the cause
See you bang your head
It's all madness anyway
And you're...
Metal moshing mad [x5]

[Chorus x2]

METAL METAL METAL METAL METAL METAL
METAL... Mad!
