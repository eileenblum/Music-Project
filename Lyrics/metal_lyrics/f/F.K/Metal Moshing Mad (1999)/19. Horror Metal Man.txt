You better not stand in his way
Cause this dude knows how to stay
If you're a poser it is time to pay
If you're not into metal there's no need to stay

[Chorus]
HORROR MAN! The metal man
Haven't you heard? Taking over the world
HORROR MAN! The metal man
Worship him or die
He brings us the new world order
To slay among the living, OBEY!
He's the first in metal, second to none
Shows no mercy, none believes, be gone

[Chorus - Mosh Part - Chorus]

Look up into the sky he's 50 feet tall
When the sun fades black, then he'll attack!
