The ultimate pleasure through ultimate pain
Pinhead will take you to his home
Jesus wept and so will you
The Master will rip you in two
Your fingers on the box open the gates
The sounds of flesh ripped into shreads

[Chorus]
Tear your souls apart!
Tear your souls apart!
Tear your souls apart!
Tear your souls apart!
[Repeat]

Tear... Apart!
