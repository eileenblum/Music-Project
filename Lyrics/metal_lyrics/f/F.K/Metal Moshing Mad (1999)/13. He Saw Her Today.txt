Five young people in a Volkswagen wan
Out of gas down in southern Texas
Four of them were never seen again
There was only one survivor
Saw is family, redneck inbreed
Saw is family, yes indeed
Picked up on a desolate roadside
Was Sally Hardesty Enright
Bloodcaked and screaming murder
Broken out of a window of hell
Saw is family, redneck inbreed
Saw is family, yes indeed

[Chorus]
She escaped, she got away
But then again, he saw her today
She escaped, she got away
Nevertheless, he saw her today
A cannibal family
In an isolated farmhouse
Bodies hacked up for BBQ
Chairs made out of human skeletons
Saw is family, redneck inbreed
Saw is family, yes indeed

[Chorus x2]
