Bus Bitch Die!
I try to get, to get on the bus
But there she stands, blocking my way
Fat and ugly and a pain in the ass
Why don't you pay!

[Chorus]
BUS BITCH DIE! Get outta my way
BUS BITCH DIE! You're gonna pay
BUS BITCH DIE! Get outta my way
BUS BITCH DIE! You're gonna pay

The only reason for existance
There can be, can be only one
Her life is sad, it is for me to take
Stood in my way for the last time

[Repeat 1st Verse]

[CHORUS]

Bus Bitch Bus Bitch Bus Bitch DIE! [x4]
