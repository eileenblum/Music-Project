You can lock your doors, but you can't lock
the madness out of your mind
Your terror is unreal, cause the horror is insane
It's time for you to experience...

[Chorus]
JOEY SPINELL! Straight out of hell
He will hunt you down, tear the life out of you
JOEY SPINELL! Straight out of hell

You know that he will attack, cause he's the maniac
Carmen Zito, his mothers name
The woman who drove him insane
She locked him in the closet, there's nowhere to run
And there's no time to pray cause...

[Chorus x2]

Madness and mayhem, when the maniac attacks
Two slaughtered at Venazaro Bridge
And there was this nurse, she didn't stand a chance
No way!

[Lead Pete]

He'll take your scalp and nail it to a mannequin
A beautiful wig for his bride
Your terror is unreal, cause the horror is insane
It's time for you to experience...

[Chorus x2]
