You pathetic piece of shit
take up too much space
The fuse to my hate you lit
Get the fuck out of my face
Everywhere I turn I see
nothing but your ugly face
Your existance, a disgrace
I will make you die and then...
(DIE!)
And I know, and I know
Know you've got to die
(SOME MORE!)
And I see, and you see
See you have to die

[Chorus]
Die Die Die some more
Die in the name of the law
Die DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDie

[Repeat All]

Time for you to mosh!

[Mosh Part]

HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY [x4]
