Late night, go to bed, feeling beat
I need to rest through the night
Rough day, all went wrong, very wrong
I need to sleep through the night
Lay down, dozing off, all is well
I start to drift into sleep
Then I hear a sound, eerie sound
Coming from the laundry basket
I start to yell
What is that smell?

[Chorus']
BEWARE BEWARE!
Of the Ã¼nderwear
BEWARE BEWARE!
Don't come near
BEWARE BEWARE!
Of the Ã¼nderwear
BEWARE BEWARE!

Satan's drawers are here
Hamper starts to shake, making noise
Up flew the drawers of doom
Red, green, all in stripes, grandpa-style
And with the smell out of hell
Flew up from the bed, screaming loud
Could this just be a dream?!
NO WAY! It is real, very real
Suddenly I realize it
I start to yell
What is that smell?

[Chorus]

I start to yell
What is that smell?
I start to yell
Drawers from hell

[Chorus x2]
