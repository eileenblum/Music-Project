Abducting the dead and cutting them up
Mixing chemicals in a cup
Morbid experiments on the deceased
The level of madness will increase

Switching and stitching their limbs and heads
Assemble them from bits and shreds
Pumping serum into their veins
Electric shocks into their brains

Grey-skinned death
Starting to moan
Ravenous for human flesh

Reanimating, reanimating the dead
Reanimating, reanimating the dead
Reanimating, reanimating the dead

Digging up graves for body parts
Robbing the morgue on second-hand hearts
Down in the crypt to kidnap the dead
Stealing a corpse from a hospital bed

Switching and stitching their limbs and heads
Assemble them from bits and shreds
Pumping serum into their veins
Electric shocks into their brains

Grey-skinned death
Starting to moan
Ravenous for human flesh

Reanimating, reanimating the dead
Reanimating, reanimating the dead
Reanimating, reanimating the dead
Reanimating, reanimating the dead
Reanimating, reanimating the dead
