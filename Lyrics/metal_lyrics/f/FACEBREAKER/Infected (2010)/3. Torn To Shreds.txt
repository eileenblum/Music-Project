Corpses crawling from the graveyard
Fury in their eyes
Seeking human victims
Hungry for their flesh
Countless hordes of deadheads
Return to hunt you down
Blood spewing from your wounds
Annihilation time

Die!
They slice and carve inside your head
Cut in half
Skin and flesh are torn to shreds

Slime infested creatures
Tear your insides out
Feed on your intestines
Feast upon your ribs
Bits and pieces all that's left
Blood soaks the ground
They hack, they claw, they rip and tear
Annihilation time

Die! Die!

Die!
They slice and carve inside your head
Cut in half
Skin and flesh are torn to shreds

Torn apart
Torn to shreds
