Biting through the coffins
Clawing through the dirt
Digging to the surface
Crawling up from six feet down
They crave your skin
You plead for mercy
Mutilated, resurrected
Terror from the grave

Creeping flesh
Horror and death

Invaders from the bone yard
Intruders from the ground
Neighbors, friends and workmates
Back from the cemetery
Vengeful wrath
You plead for mercy
Mutilated, resurrected
Terror from the grave

Creeping flesh
Horror and death

They want your blood!

Creeping flesh
Horror and death

Invasion of the undead
Horror creatures from the pits of hell
Tombs and graves are vacant
Creeping flesh
You die!
