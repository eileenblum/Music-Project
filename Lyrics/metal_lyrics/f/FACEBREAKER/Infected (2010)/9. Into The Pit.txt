Damned, cursed by a spell
Demons arise from hell

Beneath the crypt
Beyond the grave
A fate worse than death awaits

A powerful
Infernal force
Drag you into the gates

Into the pit
Your blood will drip
Your throat will be slit
You're dragged into the pit

Burn forever burn
You will never return

Beneath the crypt
Beyond the grave
A fate worse than death awaits

A powerful
Infernal force
Drag you into the gates

Into the pit
Your blood will drip
Your throat will be slit
You're dragged into the pit

Into the pit
Your blood will drip
Your throat will be slit
You're dragged into the pit

Into the pit
