Cramped up in a corner
Waiting for the pain
The dead are resurrected
Mutated and insane
Cramped up in a corner
Paralyzed by fear

The beasts are coming closer
You hear them loud and clear

Brain-dead freaks approaching
Blood they will spill
A violent obsession
They must feed and kill
Surrounded by the rotten
Abandoned to your fate
Encircled by a swarm
Driven by pure hate

Waiting for the pain
Waiting for the pain

You scream as they bite
A certain death is near
Blood is gushing out
Torture is severe
The target of aggression
You lie on the ground
Body parts and bowels
Your limbs are all around

You scream in pain
Nothing will remain
You scream in pain
Nothing will remain
