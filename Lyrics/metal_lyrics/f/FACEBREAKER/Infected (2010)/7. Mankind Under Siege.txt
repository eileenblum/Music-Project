Pain and fright, no control
Bays of blood, heads will roll

Mayhemic destruction
Chaos is complete
Mercy won't be given
The mortals will retreat

Horror rise, fear and dread
Evil draws near
Cannibals, living dead
Hell is here

Rot and mould, flesh decay
The undead, strike their prey

Mankind under siege
Completely unprepared
The bodies of the dead
Come from everywhere

Horror rise, fear and dread
Evil draws near
Cannibals, living dead
Hell is here
Smell the rot, dead arise
Evil draws near
Gruesome death, world demise
Hell is here

Corpses march to war
Rotten to the core

They will eat, you're the meat
Blood they drink, gore they stink

Awakened from their slumber
Creatures full of sin
A rancid stench of death
Blood on filthy skin

Horror rise, fear and dread
Evil draws near
Cannibals, living dead
Hell is here
Smell the rot, dead arise
Evil draws near
Gruesome death, world demise
Hell is here
