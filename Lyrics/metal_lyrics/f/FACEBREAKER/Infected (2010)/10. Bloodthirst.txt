Cursed and buried
But now I'm back
Unknown powers are unleashed
Never felt more alive

Veins leak
As I puncture your skin
Separating flesh from bones
I kill again and again

Blood! Blood! Blood!
Thirst for blood

Hunger for more
A lust I can't ignore
Rage, out of control
My jaws are dripping from your blood

Straight from hell
A body with no soul
I wear the devils mark
On the back of my neck

Veins leak
As I puncture your skin
Separating flesh from bones
I kill again and again

Blood! Blood! Blood!
Thirst for blood

Hunger for more
A lust I can't ignore
Rage, out of control
My jaws are dripping from your blood
My jaws are dripping from your blood
