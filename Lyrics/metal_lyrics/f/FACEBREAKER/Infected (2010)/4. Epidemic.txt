There is no hope or cure
Epidemic has spread
All horror by the dead
You will lose, you can not win
Hope is lost for humanity

Epidemic, epidemic of the dead

The world we knew is gone!
The world we knew is dead!
There's no way out, it's too late
There's no way back, this is the end!

Worldwide funeral
Internal hole of narrow ways
Deathless butchers kill and maim
Our souls are there to rot in hell!

You will die!
Fresh meat is what they need
You can't escape, meet your doom
You want survive, you want live

Epidemic, epidemic of the dead

Worldwide funeral
Internal hole of narrow ways
Deathless butchers kill and maim
Our souls are there to rot in hell!
