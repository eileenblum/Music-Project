Hear the howling, fear the dark
The moon, the teeth, the claws
Hounds of hell, beast of prey
The sound of grinding jaws
Ripped, torn â soon you will transform
Ripped, torn â you will be reborn

Bloodshed and insanity
In a state of ecstasy

No chance of a normal life
You're running with the pack
Every month when moon is full
The beast is coming back
Once torn â you take another form
Ripped, torn â repeatedly reborn

Lycanthrope
Blood and skin between your teeth
Dedicated to the flesh
Victims, torn â soon they will transform
Ripped, torn â they will be reborn

Bloodshed and insanity
In a state of ecstasy
Bloodshed and insanity
In a state of ecstasy
