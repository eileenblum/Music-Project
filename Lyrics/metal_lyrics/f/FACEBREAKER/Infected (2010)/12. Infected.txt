Yellow pus, open sores
Infection running through my veins
Cold and stiff, I start to rot
Disgusting stench of death surrounds
Filled with hate, I'm staring blind
Sickness gains control of me
Hunger starts, can't hold back
You're about to die!

I... I'm gonna eat your brain
My hunger drives me insane
I will crush your head
I'm infected by the dead

Hollow eyes, moulded skin
There's no cure for my disease
Can not tell wrong from right
I can not think, my mind is blank
Filled with hate, I'm staring blind

Sickness gains control of me
Hunger starts, can't hold back
You're about to die!

I... I'm gonna eat your brain
My hunger drives me insane
I will crush your head
I'm infected by the dead

You're about to die!

Infected
Infected

You're about to die!

I... I'm gonna eat your brain
My hunger drives me insane
I will crush your head
I'm infected by the dead

Infected
Infected
Infected
