Open wounds
Starts decomposing
Infected flesh turning gray
Waking up
Infected by the virus
Slowly turning dead
Reanimate
The already deceased
I smell the human flesh
Vomiting
My guts on the ground
My body feels no peace
My body feels no peace

In my blood
A terrible disease
What will I become
Immortal butcher
Unstoppable force
You can not kill what I am
Can not stop
The hunger for flesh 
Blood of the living
It tastes so fresh
A sadistic lust for blood

I am filth
I am dread
I am the walking dead
I am filth
I am dread
I am the walking dead
Condemned
I realize my fate
Found a way to stay alive
I eat human flesh

Morbid hunger
Stripped off skin
Blood-soaked victims
Torn off limbs
Can't control my appetite
Can not stop
The hunger for flesh
Blood of the living
It tastes so fresh
A sadistic lust for blood

I am filth
I am dread
I am the walking dead
I am filth
I am dread
I am the walking dead
Condemned
I realize my fate
Found a way to stay alive
I eat human flesh

Walking Dead...walking dead...walking dead...
