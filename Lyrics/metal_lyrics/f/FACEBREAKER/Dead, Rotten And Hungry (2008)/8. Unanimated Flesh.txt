decomposition, rotten death
unanimated corpses, stench of caked blood breath
nuclear error, virus spread
lifeless limbs and putrid flesh become walking dead

they rise from their grave
it's your blood they crave
so draw your last breath
put to death by unanimtad flesh
unanimated flesh

radiation rains down in the ground
reanimation of limbs of the rotten
no longer bound

the horror of the walking dead
feeding frenzy, starts to spread
skin from flesh, blood is drained
you scream in torment, insane
pain inflicted, it matters not
the hollow eys of the enembalmed, left to rot
purely instinct, eyes don't see
soulles hunger, random mayhem, killing spree

they rise from their grave
it's your blood they crave
so draw your last breath
put to death by unanimtad flesh
they rise from their grave
it's your blood they crave
so draw your last breath
put to death by unanimtad flesh

decomposition, rotten death
unanimated corpses, stench of caked blood breath
ripping humans, gut float in the mud
need to feed from the flesh of the living
dwelling in blood

they rise from their grave
it's your blood they crave
so draw your last breath
put to death by unanimtad flesh
