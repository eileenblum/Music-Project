bleed to death
rot and burn
murderous power
unleashed upon manking
die
prepare to die
the final chapter, your final day

humanity
slowly rotting aay
I'm the ruler of hell
the creator of evil

one by one
I rip out their souls
forever in flames
one more sent down
die
prepare to die
the final chapter, your final day

suffering, you will roar with pain
when you die
I rip your soul, you rot
mutilation sets in

humanity
slowly rotting away
I'm the ruler of hell
the creator of evil
