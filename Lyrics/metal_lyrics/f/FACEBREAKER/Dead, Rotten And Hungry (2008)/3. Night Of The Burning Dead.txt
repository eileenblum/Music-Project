the dead come to life from their prison of flames
seeking their vengeance on man
pitch black skeletons burning in pain
rise from their tombs of the damned
scream in hatred of utter revenge
at stakes they were burned for their sins
breathing sulphur through pitch black skulls
cleansing through fire begins

dead, dead, dead
night of the burning dead
dead, dead, dead

blood must be spilled in the hour of death
unleashing the dead from their chains
cleansing through burning sickness that's man
the dead purified by their pain
scream in hatred of utter revenge
at stakes they were burned for their sins
breathing sulphur through pitch black skulls
cleansing through fire begins

dead, dead, dead
night of the burning dead
dead, dead, dead
