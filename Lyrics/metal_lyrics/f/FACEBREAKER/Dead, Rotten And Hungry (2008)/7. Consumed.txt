festering bodies
back from the dead
the line has been crossed
plague has spread
gathered to eat, they cut through your meat
razorsharp teeth
moving in for a bite
consumed by the dead
an unholy rite

rapturours slaughter, they eat you alive
brutally butchered, there's no escape

bodies, crawling back from their tombs
zombies, ripping the flesh from your bones

inhale your last breath
the sun will die
total annihilation
blood sprays the sky
gathered to eat, they cut through your meat
razorsharp teeth
moving in for a bite
consumed by the dead
an unholy rite

rapturours slaughter, they eat you alive
brutally butchered, there's no escape

bodies, crawling back from their tombs
zombies, ripping the flesh from your bones
