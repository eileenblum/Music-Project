come, come I will show you your funeral
a lesson in pain and suffering
come, come an open grave awaits
bloody screams as you take your final breath
blood and gore, I will cut you up
expose your maggot-infested brain
a pill of skulls and bones
a smell of rotting flesh

dead, rotten and hungry

you are in the pits of hell
repulsive sound of frantic feeding
the fall of man is now at hand
this is your death
blood and gore, I will cut you up
expose your maggot-infested brain
a pill of skulls and bones
a smell of rotting flesh

dead, rotten and hungry

my blood-dripping mouth is never satisfied
blood-soaked, cracked up heat
you will suffer
a stream of blood flowing down my throat
the human pest, food for the undead

die, this world won't last

dead, rotten and hungry

my blood-dripping mouth is never satisfied
blood-soaked, cracked up heat
you will suffer
a stream of blood flowing down my throat
the human pest, food for the undead
