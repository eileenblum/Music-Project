blood dripping from my hands
darkness looms, when I awake
the horizon will burn
I arise in fire, the return
I will take you in
I will spit you out
face my wrath, I will bury you

unleash the fire
absorb the flame

soul eater
soul eater

enter the gates of hell
feed the fire, die in pain
the world is minej to rule again
I will take you in
I will spit you out
face my wrath, I will bury you

unleash the fire
absorb the flame

soul eater
soul eater
