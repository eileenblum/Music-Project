I am the one
come follew me down
it's time to burn
flames of hell, eternal suffering
I will bring you pain
die, slow
I'm the chosen one
burn, for eternity

ripped off your skin
torment
feast upon your soul
die

I rule the world
and I will remain
you will pass away
drown in flames, eternal suffering
I will watch you burn
you, die
let the horror begin
burn, for eternity

I'm the one who takes your soul
burner
From the halls of hell I rise
burner

ripped off your skin
torment
feast upon your soul
die

come walk with me
through endless flames
don't turn around
dust to dust, eternal suffering
I'm the lord of fire
die, slow
the everlasting flame
burn, for eternity

I'm the one who takes your soul
burner
From the halls of hell I rise
burner
