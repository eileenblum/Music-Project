storm of flesh everywhere you look you will see
death of man, by the plague of the corpses of the dead
putrified, fearless shadows from the ashes where they died
undead and still to life

devoured piece by piece
through carnage bloody feast
there's just one urge to please
hunger

devoured by decay
their thirst for carnage, there's no use to pray
devoured by decay
dismembered and butchered, slaughtered and slayed

torn apart by
death, decay, lifeless limbs that's risen from their graves and morgues
hear the cries of the stillborn
arise, bright green skin and dead-white hollow eyes
turnedinto dead, before they even died

blood insane, impulses in their rotten brain indulges them to hunt down humans
screaming in pain and dread as they are riping of your head to feed
it's your blood they need

devoured piece by piece
through carnage bloody feast
there's just one urge to please
hunger

devoured by decay
their thirst for carnage, there's no use to pray
devoured by decay
dismembered and butchered, slaughtered and slayed
