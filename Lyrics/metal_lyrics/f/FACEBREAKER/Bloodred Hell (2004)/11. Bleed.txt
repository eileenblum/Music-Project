An eternal life,an eternal need
I will live,and you will bleed
You'll be dead,just a mailer of time
Your pulsing river will soon be mine
A blood flowing stream, the moon turns red
I slake my thirst,as you join with the dead
As you join with the dead

A stream of power
Your blood starts to rain
Your skin turns-while
As I bite through your vein

A smell of blood-a smell of fear
I rule the darkness-your end is near
It's my doom-yeah I'm living in sin
Time has come-let the bloodfeast begin
A blood flowing stream,the moon turns red
I slake my thirst,as you join with the dead
As you join with the dead

A stream of power
Your blood start to rain
Your skin turns-white
As I bite through your vein
A stream of power
Your blood start to rain
Your skin turns-white
As I bite through your vein....
