A force of evil,soon too awake
Rollen hands will reach for your skin
Stinking creatures in search for the meal
Will cut you up and eat you from within
Hellish intruders will tear you apart
Slice you up with filthy claws
The dead will march,a command of the dark
They skinned invaders with deadly jaws

Then hell is full they will rise from their graves
Restless souls awaits rebirth
Reborn dead from a world below
Resurrected beasts will walk the earth
Resurrected beasts will walk the earth

Command of the dark...
Command of the dark...
Command of the dark...

Malice hordes unleashed from hell
The flag of death,will be raised by the dead
Hell on earth,a zombie attack!
A new world order lies ahead
Hellish intruders will tear you apart
Slice you up with filthy claws
The dead will march,a command of the dark
Grey skinned invaders with deadly jaws

Then hell is full they will rise from
Their graves
Restless souls awaits rebirth
Reborn dead from a world below

Resurrected beasts will walk the earth
Resurrected beasts will walk the earth

Command of the dark...
Command of the dark...
