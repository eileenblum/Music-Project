Come let me show you,I'll lake you for a ride
I'll lake you six feet under,I'll rul you open wide
I'm possessed by fire,I'll let you lurking burn
I'll tear your heart out,and there is no return

I'll rip your soul out,
I'm the most vicious man you'll ever meet

I'm the fallen-the demon
A spirit dressed in black-the demon

I'm the angel of darkness,I'll put your body to sleep
I'll lake you down below,I will bury you deep
I'm possessed by fire,I'll let you lurking burn
I'll tear your heart out,and there is no return

I'll rip your soul out.
I'm the most vicious man you'll ever meet

I'm the fallen-the demon
A spirit dressed in black-the demon

I am the bringer of death-inhuman,anger running
Through my veins
Brutality.I'm evil-hell has arrived...

I'll rip your soul out.
I am the vicious man you'll ever meet

I am the fallen-the demon
A spirit dressed in black-the demon

The demon............
Demon.....
