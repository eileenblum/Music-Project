A universe all drenched in fire
Burning breath inhales the storms
Feeding on the feeble liars
In the inferno where I am lord
Facing truth,evil has known
I am the lord for all men to know
Come with me to bloodstained shores
Where we slay the weak-minded whores

With my hands I wave the sickness
Causing plague for all unbound
I'm hale and bitterness
I'm malice without sound

Lord of infernal burning,crucifixion nails my name
Lust,sin and yearning
I am all that is inflame
Devil,demon and darkness
Nothing is my truth
Totally fucking soulless
Forsaken,fallen and used

With my hands I wave the sickness
Causing plague for all unbound
I am hale and bitterness
I'm malice without sound
With my hands I wave the sickness
Causing plague for all unbound
I'm hale and bitterness
I'm malice without sound

Bloodred hell-suffer the sickness and suffer my pain
Living and breathing,inhaling the flames
Slowly decaying imploding your cells
Enter the kingdom of my bloodred hell...

Bloodred-bloodred hell...
Bloodred-bloodred hell...
Bloodred-bloodred hell...
Bloodred-bloodred hell...

With my hands I wave the sickness
Causing plague for all unbound
I'm hale and bitterness
I'm malice without sound
With my hands I wave the sickness
Causing plague for all unbound
I'm hale and bitterness
I'm malicde without sound
