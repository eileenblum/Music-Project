A species of self-destruction
Not build to last
Like vampires sucking each other's blood
Spreading the deception vast
Burning their fingers
On the fire that keeps them alive
Like leeches floating in blood
Addicted to the addiction
Believe the lies,like cancer in your eyes
Spreading the detesting infliction

Human spoil-driving the spikes into the coffin of man
This rollen evil-a stillborn race not to see they're damned

You go around wondering,what to die from
Guierl the needle with the drugs of life,
And get the biller taste of mass hypnosia.
Like immortality through suicide
Like leeches floating in blood
Addicted to the addiction
Believe the lies,like cancer in your eyes
Spreading the detesting infliction

Human spoil-driving the spikes into the coffin of man
This rollen evil-a stillborn race not to see they're damned
Human spoil-driving the spikes into the coffin of man
This rollen evil-a stillborn race not to see they're damned
Not to see they're damned...

Human spoil-driving the spikes into the coffin of man
This rollen evil-a stillborn race not to see they're damned
Human spoil-driving the spikes into the coffin of man
This rollen evil-a stillborn race not to see they're damned
