I rose from chaos
I rose from carnage
On rage and fury,I stand tall
I'm on the right track
I'm on the attack!
In my world of hate
I'll take you down

They say,I'm evil
They say,I'm cursed
I am the reaper
This is my revenge

Evil they call me,but I am true,
My instincts are pure and I'll follow
Them through...

This night you'll suffer
This night you'll beg
This night you will come crawling
Back, praying for it all to end
I'll make you cry
I'll make you scream
I'll make you pay the price,forever
Burn in hell

They say,I'm evil
They say,I'm cursed
I am the reaper
This is my revenge

Evil they call me,but I am true,my instinct are pure
Evil they call me,but I am true,my instinct are pure
