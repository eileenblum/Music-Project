The strive for evil has become my obssession
Only seeking the cruel things in life
The throne of darkness is now in my possession
Sacrificing the week with a demons knife
They will rot,and there will be a feast on tnheir flesh
Their souls belongs to me...

Have you ever been this far before
The pain,your flesh in the burning flames
Have you ever fell this pain before
You keep decaying 'till you rot in hell

It's coming closer,I can feel it burn my mind
It drives me insane,it makes me cause all this pain
I am the evil messenger,bound to serve the evil lord
Desecrate the flag of faith
Spilling in the face of god...

Have you ever been this far before
The pain,your flesh in the burning flames
Have you ever fell this pain before
You keep decaying 'till yopu rot in hell
