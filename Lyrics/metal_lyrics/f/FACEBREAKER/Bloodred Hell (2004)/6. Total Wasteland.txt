Demons are dancing in my mind
Turtning everylhing upside-down
Love into hate,good into evil
My body is not my own...
Grotesque madness,rips trough my vein
Hellish pain,laking my sanity
Darkness surrounds me,frustation grows stronger
I fight but the stuggle is over...

A world in ruins,burned to the ground
Total wasteland
Nothing remains,a world turned to ash
Total wasteland

Is there something wrong with my head
Is there anything that I can do?
Can this be real?can this be true?
Seeing trough the eyes of hell
Feeling only pain and anger
The dark is here,with demons from hell
The light is gone,my world turns black
The light is gone,evil's on the attack!

Demons are dancing in my mind
Turning everything upside-down
Love into hate,good into evil
My body is not my own...

A world in ruins,burned to the ground
Total wasteland
Nothing remains,a world turned to ash
Total wasteland
