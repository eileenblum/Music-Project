Caressed by the dark side
No remorse for my chosen path
Not fearing the band of my reaper
Not fearing my evil mind
With me,eternity ends
I'm the ruler of life
I'm the bringer of death
I have been since the dawn of time
Not always me,but always the same
You-can't bring me to an early grave
I-begotten not of blood
You-can't bring me to an early grave
I-will take you to your maker
Bewitched from my birth
Reborn again and again
Created to change the world
Created from torment
With me,it all dies
With me,eternity ends
My creation,a dark world
My creation,an evil race
