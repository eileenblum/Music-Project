I am the hunter,it's time to die
I cut your flesh,your blood runs dry
I am the bringer,I bring you down
The king of sin,I wear the crown
I'm the inhuman killing machine
I show no mercy for the victims I slay
I show no mercy for the weak
I show no mercy so.......

You will be-crushed,by the unholy jaws of hell
I will swallow your soul
I will leave you to rot!

You are the victim,you will be slayed
You are doomed,forever bloodstained
Another soul,the sin is done
Another hunt,born of evil I'm the one
I'm the inhuman killing-machine
I show no mercy for the victims I slay
I show no mercy for the weak
I show no mercy so .......

You will be-crushed,by the unholy jaws of hell
I will swallow your soul
I will leave you to rot!

Crushed,by the unholy jaws of hell
I will swallow your soul
I will leave you to rot!

Rot!
