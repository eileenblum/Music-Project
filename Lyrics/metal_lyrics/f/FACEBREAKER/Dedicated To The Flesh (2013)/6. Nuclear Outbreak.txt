Nuclear radiation
A world beyond repair
Global scale disaster
Chaos and despair
Catastrophic error
Reactor full of gaps
Loss of cooling, heat is rising
Power plant collapse

Melt down
Melt down

Unsuspected horror
The dead return to kill
Awful chain reaction
A result from toxic spill
Total error, total terror
Bedlam, havoc, total mayhem
Devastation, excruciation
Contamination spread

Nuclear
Radiation unthaws your flesh
Outbreak
Of radioactive death

Black rain of toxic fallout
Ashes in your breath
Atomic mass destruction
Mushroom clouds of death
Vomiting and nausea
Your lungs are in decay
Internal bleeding, abdominal pain
Your skin is turning grey

Melt down
Melt down

Radiation sickness
You die from toxic spill
With rising hate and hunger
You return to kill
Total error, total terror
Bedlam, havoc, total mayhem
Devastation, excruciation
Contamination spread

Nuclear
Radiation unthaws your flesh
Outbreak
Of radioactive death
