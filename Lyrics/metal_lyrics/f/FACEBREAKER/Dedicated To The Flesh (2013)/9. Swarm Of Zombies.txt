Sharp-set murder mob
Battalions of rotted meat
A force you can't defeat
No chance for you to retreat

Blood flows on the ground
Surrounded by awful dread
Among the living dead
Floods of gushing red
Screams and brutal scenes
Crawling through human wrecks
Walking through fields of flesh
Limbs, guts and torn up necks
You're trapped in hell
Cornered by walking dead
You have to go ahead
Into the

Swarm of zombies
Swarm of zombies
Swarm of zombies
Swarm of zombies

Bestial, repulsive brutes
Ingest from an open chest
This is a certain death
You're trapped inside their nest
Blood flows in the ground
Surrounded by awful dread
Among the living dead
Floods of gushing red
Screams and brutal scenes
Crawling through human wrecks
Walking through fields of flesh
Limbs, guts and torn up necks
You're trapped in hell
Cornered by walking dead
Yeah! You have to go
Into the swarm

Swarm of zombies
Swarm of zombies
Swarm of zombies
Swarm of zombies
