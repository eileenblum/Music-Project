I'm waking up at the morgue
Muscles aching, throat is sore
I'm crawling out down the hall
The staff arrive, I beat them down

I bash, smash to death
I can't control myself
I kill, slay, maim
I'm totally insane

I'm carving for brains
Feeding from their veins
Carving for brains
Eating their remains

I roam around randomly
I meet a guard, I slash his throat
I continue out on the street
A crowd arrive, I beat them down

I bash, smash to death
I can't control myself
I kill, slay, maim
I'm totally insane

I'm carving for brains
Feeding from their veins
Carving for brains
Eating their remains

Carving for brains
Feeding from their veins
Carving for brains
Eating their remains

Carving for brains
Feeding from their veins
Carving for brains
Eating their remains
