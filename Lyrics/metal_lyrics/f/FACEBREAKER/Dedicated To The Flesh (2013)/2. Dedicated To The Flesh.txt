Fourteen years since the outbreak
We are the living dead
A death metal militia
Ripping the ears from your head
Blood-red hell in the front row
We crave the flesh from our crowd
We're dead rotten and hungry
Infected, distorted and loud

Dedicated to the flesh
Dedicated, dedicated to the flesh
Dedicated, dedicated to the flesh
Dedicated, dedicated to the flesh

Fuck all trends, we obey no rules
We always stay true to our sound
Facebreaker stand for death metal
We burn the stage to the ground
Blood-red hell in the front row
We crave the flesh from our crowd
We're dead rotten and hungry
Infected, distorted and loud

Dedicated to the flesh
Dedicated, dedicated to the flesh
Dedicated, dedicated to the flesh
Dedicated, dedicated to the flesh
