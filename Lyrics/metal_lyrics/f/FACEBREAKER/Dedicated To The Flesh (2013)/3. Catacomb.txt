Buried, forgotten
Thousands of nameless corpses
A chamber of evil
Beneath unholy soil
Pure hatred awoken
The cursed, the doomed and damned
Assassins and killers
Will rise to slay again

Dead shall rise from the crypt
Catacomb of rotten evil
Hell shall rise from the ground
Catacomb of violent horror

Despised, detested
Condemned for countless sins
Reborn in coffins
Worm-eaten faceless demons
Pure hatred awoken
The cursed, the doomed and damned
Assassins and killers
Will rise to slay again

Dead shall rise from the crypt
Catacomb of rotten evil
Hell shall rise from the ground
Catacomb of violent horror
