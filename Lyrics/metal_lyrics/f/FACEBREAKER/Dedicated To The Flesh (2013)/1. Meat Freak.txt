I have a primitive instinct
A manic lust for flesh
A compulsive fixation
I like it raw and fresh

Carnivore
I rip out your tongue
You can't win this fight
Carnivore
Consuming your lung
You're in hell tonight

Meat freak
I'm reborn in sin
Yeah! I'm a cannibal
Meat freak
I devour your skin
Uh! Like an animal

Resurrected predator
I'm a savage beast
I revel in murder
Barbaric ravage feast

Carnivore
I rip out your tongue
You can't win this fight
Carnivore
Consuming your lung
You're in hell tonight

Meat freak
I'm reborn in sin
Yeah! I'm a cannibal
Meat freak
I devour your skin
Uh! Like an animal
