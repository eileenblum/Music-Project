Lord of the undead
The king of death
The ancient one will rise again
Incantations from the past
A gate to hell revealed
Resurrection rituals
A portal unsealed
Zombie god
Hidden from this world above
For centuries unknown
The commander of the decomposed
Will restore its throne

Evil
The last thing you will ever face
Zombie God
The extinction of the human race

We are damned
The end of the days
Death across the globe
Multiple crowds of carcasses
Ascend from the sand
Entities of moulded flesh
Under one command
Zombie God
Hidden from this world above
For centuries unknown
The commander of the decomposed
Will restore its throne

Evil
The last thing you will ever face
Zombie God
The extinction of the human race
