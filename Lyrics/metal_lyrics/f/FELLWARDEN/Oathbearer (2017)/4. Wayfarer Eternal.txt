I am cursed
To wander forever alone
I am condemned
To stand in solitude and defiance

My farsight takes wing
To soar beyond
The comings of man, the dawn of our kin
To a world untouched by patterns of malice

I have witnessed the seas rise and fall
Watched mountains carved from the primordial bedrock
I have seen walls of ice march and collapse
A landscape shaped by conflict and violence

Winds that scour soils untouched by humanity
And scream across fells of verdant promise
They howl of a doom yet to come
As stygian clouds gather upon the horizons of millennia

I am cursed To drift, solemn and bereft
I am condemned
To carve a solitary path
And gaze upon a scouring of all that was once radiant

I watch the doom of ages roil and rend
Earthpower dwindling in the face of exultant malic
My eyes burn with the coming of chaos
The scourge of despite, the will of desecration
Tearing at the very seams of reality
Venom and corruption, a raging thirst.

I am the first and last of my era
A soul-shadow that sours adrift
On vortices that sing with the songs of loss

I take their voices within me
Embrace the many choirs of sorrow
As the land is shaped and reshaped one hundred times or more
And the black fog of malediction descends like a shroud,
I remain: Unbowed, resolute, Eternal.
