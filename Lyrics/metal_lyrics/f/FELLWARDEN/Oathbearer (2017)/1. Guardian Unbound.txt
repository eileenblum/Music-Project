Unbound
Unfettered by the fell chains of deference
I bow to no man
Worship no Gods
No creature, no elemental act of savagery
Can cause this will to bend or snap

I travel as I please
My path is unmarked, my destiny unwritten
Driven by the cause of the just
The heathen cry of righteousness
The thunderous pulse of vengeance
Resonates my soul like a storm

Rivers of time run with blood
The blood of those who would oppose
In defiance of persecution, I stand like rock
Anchored as roots in earth
Stoic as the shoulders of mountains
Glacial giants that stand in the face of the millennial winds.

From the darkest forests of the valley floor
To the snow-capped cairns where eagles soar
My dominion knows no limit
My demesne boundless, ageless, timeless

I turn my eyes to a wind-burned landscape
And fix my gaze with purpose
I raise my arms to the storm-charged skies
And scream my defiance in wordless rage

A spirit gilded by burning resolve
A paragon of the stoic in an age of treachery
A soul-guide to those who drift, lost and afraid
A banner-bearer for the essence of honour
A brooding scion whoâs fate thus knows no end
A totem of iron-bound vigilance
A weaver of destiny, master of time
A clarion call summons those of this line
A guardian unbound
