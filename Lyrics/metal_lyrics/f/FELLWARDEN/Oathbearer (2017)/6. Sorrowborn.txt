I come from a line of kings
Long forgotten, long dead, long interred in ancient soils
Their bones naught but a latticework
Of old memories that thread beneath these hills.

Flesh merged with earth
Spirit with roots
An essence left to drift
On the sad winds of time

I am the last of my line and in strife was I sired
Forever the bitter taste of slaughter upon my tongue
To an age of blood I have come and only pain awaits
Sovereignty my gift and sorrow my reward

Eyes that witnessed the death of their father
Burn steadfast with the vengeance born of righteousness
Alone, I traverse the ways of the old ones
Before the barrow of my ancestors, I cry out for wisdom

Centuries of woe bleeds through this earth
Threnodies stir the very stones of these chambers
A single voice travels forlorn on the nightwinds
A desperate prayer beseeching for guidance

For thine was an age of glories now dust
A kingdom flourishing on pillars of honour
Gilded by the strength of the steadfast
A radiating brilliance painting this land
