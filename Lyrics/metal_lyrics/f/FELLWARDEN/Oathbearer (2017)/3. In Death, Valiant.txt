Great pyres will burn in celebration of sacrifice
Those who lay down their lives in mute rectitude
Our songs will chime in leaf-dappled valleys
The forests will ring with thy names

A storm is coming, the skies thus darken
Moonlight gleams upon oceans of iron
Shadows reach across heath-shrouded hills
Murderous intent exhales

Feet planted on the black earth
Sword-haft gripped, eyes like flint
None shall pass whilst breath in thy body moves
Unyielding. Remorseless.

Guardian until death!

Bound in life to honour
Bound in death to glory
A credo of stone
A code of iron

To defend with full force
To repel those who would defile
To stand, steadfast and unbreakable
To the very end

These cold rivers run with the blood of the slain
Soils steeped in tragedy and ruin
Yet stained with sorrow though it may be
The bedrock of these fells remains unbroken

I fall â alone and unmourned,
I fall â unwitnessed my passing
I fall â unsung my song of ending
In death, valiant.
