Many years of my life I have been in search of,
Someone to shelter from the cold.
I may be a fool, standing waiting here forever,
In those quiet eyes I know -

That' it's - So long I've been left too far behind
So long to me.
Cause it's - So long that I've almost lost my mind
So long to me - I'm so tired of tryin'

There are those who stop and tell me who I'm best for,
And that love will pass me by.
But they'll fade away, and I continue searching,
All my life -

That' it's - So long I've been left too far behind
So long to me.
Cause it's - So long that I've almost lost my mind
So long to me...ahhhhh ohhhhhh...

[Guitar solo]

And it's - So long I've been left too far behind
So long to me.
Cause it's - So long that I've almost lost my mind
So long to me - '

So long, So long, So long to me.
So long, So long, So long to me.

[Outro guitar solo]

So long. So long, So long to me.
