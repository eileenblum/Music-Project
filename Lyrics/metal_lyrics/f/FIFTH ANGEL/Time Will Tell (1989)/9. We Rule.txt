Hey you - you know that I'm watching
And I - know just what you do.
We have power - we will rule your lives.
Hey you - your dreams are no secret
Cause I - can see in your mind
Always hoping - fighting to survive

Over and over I hear the voices call -

We rule - the lords of the wasteland.
We rule - the eyes of the underground
We rule - the lords of the wasteland.
We rule - the eyes of the underground.

Hey you, I feel your anger
So, I will take you away.
Hide your madness from those we control.
And you, you lust for the power
Cause I, am holding the keys
(To) chains that bind you, tearing at your soul.

Over and over I hear the voices call -

We rule - the lords of the wasteland.
We rule - the eyes of the underground
We rule - the lords of the wasteland.
We rule - the eyes of the underground.

We watch you, we see you,
We'll tell you what is real.
No running, nowhere to hide -

[Guitar solo]

We watch you, we see you,
We'll tell you what is real.
No running, nowhere to hide -

We rule - the lords of the wasteland.
We rule - the eyes of the underground
We rule - the lords of the wasteland.
We rule - the eyes of the underground.

We rule - the lords of the wasteland.
We rule - the eyes of the underground
We rule - the lords of the wasteland.
We rule - the eyes of the underground.

We rule.
We rule
Whoah oh oh oh
