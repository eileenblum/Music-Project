Can you feel the fever, as it burns inside of me.
Seven hours 'til midnight, and the world will be set free.
And there's talk of justice, for the ones we leave behind.
So reveal your sins now, to release you from mankind.

You know you've lived a life of evil.
So - get down on your knees and pray -

Seven, hours, 'til judgement
Seven, hours, I can feel the time is coming
Seven, hours, 'til judgement
I can feel, the time is drifting away.

Preaching down the subways, and they stop you in the streets.
'Cause they have a message, like a saviour when they speak.
When we stop and wonder, if that day will ever come.
Maybe we're believing, in a destiny they've won.

You know you've lived a life of evil.
So - get down on your knees and pray -

Seven, hours, 'til judgement
Seven, hours, I can feel the time is coming
Seven, hours, 'til judgement
I can feel, the time is drifting away.

You know you've lived a life of evil.
So - get down on your knees and pray -

Seven, hours, 'til judgement
Seven, hours, I can feel the time is coming
Seven, hours, 'til judgement
I can feel, the time is drifting away.
