You, the obsession in my life,
Leave me so torn up inside.
I only want you to be with me.

Time, isn't always on our side,
But we're trying to survive.
'Cause there's a need in me can't you see.

I need some time to think it over -
Just find a way to work it out -

Angel of mercy - lay your hands around my heart.
Angel of mercy - don't you know I need you.
Angel of mercy - tellin' me you're torn apart.
I know there's something left here.
I know you bleed, the way I do.

I, have been trying for so long,
Tryin' to find out what went wrong.
And why I need you I'll never know.

Now, it's so hard to understand,
I've been brought down by your hand.
But your belief in me never shows - oh, oh.

I need some time to think it over -
Just find a way to work it out -

Angel of mercy - lay your hands around my heart.
Angel of mercy - don't you know I need you.
Angel of mercy - tellin' me you're torn apart.
I know there's something left here.
I know you bleed, the way I do.

I need some time to think things over,
Oh...I'll find a way to work it out -

Angel of mercy - lay your hands around my heart.
Angel of mercy - don't you know I need you.
Angel of mercy - tellin' me you're torn apart.
I know there's something left here.
I know you bleed, the way I do.
