[UFO cover]

Wind blows back on the battens chargin'
Runs all the way.
Off to the thud, of my gun
Maybe now your time has come -

From the backstreets, there's a rumblin'
Sound of anarchy
No more nice time, black boy shoe shine,
Pie in the sky dream.

Lights out, lights out in London
Hold tight until the end.
Maybe now you'll know they'll never
Wait for tomorrow.

Lights out, lights out in London
Hold tight until the end.
God knows when I'm comin' on my run.

Heaven help those who help themselves,
That's the way it goes.
Frightening thoughts, what's been taught
And now it shows -

Lights out, lights out in London
Hold tight until the end.
Maybe now you'll know they'll never
Wait for tomorrow.

Lights out, lights out in London
Hold tight until the end.
God knows when I'm comin' on my run.

[Guitar solo]

Lights out, lights out in London
Hold tight until the end.
Maybe now you'll know they'll never
Wait for tomorrow.

Lights out, lights out in London
Hold tight until the end.
God knows when I'm comin' on my run.

Lights out in London (repeat 3x)

[Outro solo]

Lights out!
