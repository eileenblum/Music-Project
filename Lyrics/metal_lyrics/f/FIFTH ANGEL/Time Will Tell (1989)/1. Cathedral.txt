I fear the fire, calling down below.
A dark desire, as it tears through the flesh of my soul.
And there's a feeling, hiding deep within.
It's always fighting, to bleed my heart when temptation begins - Oh No.

You'll find a way to me.
To reach my soul...

In the cathedral - voices crying to heaven
In the cathedral - where they pray to the light
In the cathedral - voices crying to heaven
In the cathedral - they escape from the night again.

I hear them lying, see them cheat and steal.
There's no denying, the endless bloodshed they try to conceal.
And there's a feeling, hiding deep within.
But be forgiven, so they can do it over again - Oh No.

You'll find a way to me.
To reach my soul...

In the cathedral - voices crying to heaven
In the cathedral - where they pray to the light
In the cathedral - voices crying to heaven
In the cathedral - they escape from the night again.

[Guitar solo]

You'll find a way to me...
To reach my soul.
Now hear the whispers...
They call...

In the cathedral - voices crying to heaven
In the cathedral - where they pray to the light
In the cathedral - voices crying to heaven
In the cathedral - they escape from the night.

In the cathedral [8x]

[Outro guitar solo]
