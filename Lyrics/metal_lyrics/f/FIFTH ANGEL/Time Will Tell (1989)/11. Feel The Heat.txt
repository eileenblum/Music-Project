Feel the heat, let my heart rise,
Feel the heat -

Through the alleys and backstreets,
I'm watchin' and I'm waitin' for you.
Should have known you could not change.
I don't know why you're putting me through.

Satisfied that I need you, more than words can say.
Just a change before I'm through, to touch you my own way -

Baby can't you feel the heat, let my heart rise.
Need so much, the fire in your eyes.
Feel the heat, take me to the sky.
Let me touch the fire in your eyes.

You can work me everyday.
Run me 'round in circles again.
It's a game we've always played.
And now you've brought it all to an end.

Satisfied that I need you, more than words can say.
Just a change before I'm through, to touch you my own way -

Baby can't you feel the heat, let my heart rise.
Need so much, the fire in your eyes.
Feel the heat, take me to the sky.
Let me touch the fire in your eyes.

I'm so confused, I feel so alone.
Maybe your love would save me.
So why don't you take me into your arms. Oh -

[Guitar solo]

I'm so confused, I feel so alone.
Maybe your love would save me.
So why don't you take me into your arms. Oh -

Feel the heat, let my heart rise.
Need so much, the fire in your eyes.
Feel the heat, take me to the sky.
Let me touch the fire in your eyes.

Feel the heat. Baby can't you feel the heat.
Feel the heat. Whoah - feel the heat.
Feel the heat. Let my heart rise. Feel the heat.

Feel the heat [3x]
