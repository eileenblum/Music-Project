I feel a hunger deep inside.
I hear at voice at night - calling out to me.
Tryin' to escape the doubt that holds me down,
Can't get beyond the wall that would set me free...

Broken dreams - There's nothing left worth fighting for. Broken dreams - I ask the reasons why.
Broken dreams - There's nothing left of dreams before,
Just shattered pieces that I've left behind.

I've felt the pain of losin' once before,
The memory's almost gone - But so is part of me.
I've spent my life in search and wondering.
My dreams aren't made to live, they're just meant to be...

Broken dreams - There's nothing left worth fighting for. Broken dreams - I ask the reasons why.
Broken dreams - There's nothing left of dreams before,
Just shattered pieces that I've left behind. That I've left behind...

[Guitar solo]

Broken dreams - There's nothing left worth fighting for. Broken dreams - I ask the reasons why.
Broken dreams - There's nothing left of dreams before,
Just shattered pieces that I've left behind.

Broken dreams - There's nothing left worth fighting for. Broken dreams - I ask the reasons why.
Broken dreams - There's nothing left of dreams before,
Just shattered pieces that I've left behind.

Woh-oh, Broken dreams...
