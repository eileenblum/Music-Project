Try to tell them of your fantasy,
But their faces made of stone.
They will cry in anger, they will cry in rage,
When you release the secrets that you know.

Understanding is so far away, Shout but no one ever hears.
Now you know they'll listen, now you know they'll cry,
Into the raging thunder in their ears -

Ah, ah, don't turn away
No place to hide.
Ah, ah, don't you betray
My needs inside.

Wait for me, don't you leave me far behind.
Wait for me, I'll follow.
Wait for me, don't you leave me 'til I find
The way to go - hear the voices in my mind.

Now you take them under your control,
They hear every word you say.
Maybe they're not crazy, maybe they're afraid, If they can realize who you portray.

Ah, ah, don't turn away
No place to hide.
Ah, ah, don't you betray
My needs inside.

Wait for me, don't you leave me far behind.
Wait for me, I'll follow.
Wait for me, don't you leave me 'til I find
The way to go - hear the voices in my mind.

[Main guitar solo]

Wait for me, don't you leave me far behind.
Wait for me, I'll follow.
Wait for me, don't you leave me 'til I find
The way to go - whoah.

Wait for me. Why don't you - wait for me. I'll follow.
Wait for me. Don't you leave me 'til I find the way to go.
Wait for me. Come on and wait for me. Ahhhh ohhhh. Wait for me.

[Outro solo]
