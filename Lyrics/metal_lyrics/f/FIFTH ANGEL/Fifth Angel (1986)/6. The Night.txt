I see on television savagery and madness every day
Our twisted minds are spinning, coming ever closer to the break

Hide your eyes, don't watch them suffer
Can't you see the action isn't real
See their face, uneasy laughter
Maybe it's a fear we really feel

Through the night, you can't escape what you see
There is no way to be free
You can't escape what you see
There is no end to this dream

You watch them as they're screaming, haven't we all seen them here before?
You mustn't change the channel, wait until they scream a little more

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

What is that on the corner, fighting in the darkness on the street?
Can't wait to see what happens, just like TV violence that we need
