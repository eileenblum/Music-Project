In a land far from nowhere
With a false god as a king
They rejoice and sing
In the night their chanting rings
In the dark mist they wonder
If it's true, the distant spell
They look to the sky
And they call the Fifth Angel

They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel

With his eyes dark and steady
Feel that time is growing near
In the days to come
They will hide his soul in fear
So he stands on the mountain
Signs that echoed as he fell
They stand hand in hand
At the dawn of Fifth Angel

They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel

You know it's a feeling
Like a memory from a spark
It all came together when Fifth Angel left his mark

You know it's a feeling
Like a memory from a spark
It all came together when Fifth Angel left his mark!

They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel!

They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel!
They call the Fifth Angel
They call the Fifth Angel!
