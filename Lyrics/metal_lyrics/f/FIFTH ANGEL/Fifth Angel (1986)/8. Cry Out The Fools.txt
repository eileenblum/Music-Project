Call to me she speaks with evil eyes
Drawn away with whispers, of her spell
All escape but leave their souls behind
She has you trapped, inside her private hell

Hear her whisper, in the morning light
She's calling you away

Cry out the fools
That she takes, in the heat, of passion fire
Cry out the fools
In the night no escaping her desire

Lie with me desire is all it takes
A demon knows your weakness feeds your fright
Bound in chains your spirit she will break
She'll set you free, but never leave your mind

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Hear her whisper, in the morning light
She's calling you away
It's just her vengeance, in the night
