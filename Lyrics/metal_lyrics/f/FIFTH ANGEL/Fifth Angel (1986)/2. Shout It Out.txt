Almost daylight, as the watch carries on he sees plans being laid
Always knowing, with the time coming near the ones who will be saved

Hear their laughter, as they gather around and watch a fool being stoned
Hear their whispers as he raises his eyes and warns of what he has told

And he calls to the world of the coming
In the end there'll be nothing left
Let me touch your soul I'll take you away

Shout it out
He calls to the world of the day of the coming
Shout it out
In the end you'll see his tears
Shout it out
He calls to the world of the day of the coming
Shout it out
There'll be nothing left but fear

And they're moving, to his chants as if he has touched powers above
His voice soothing, the mistrust in the eyes of those which he has come

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Oh - almost daylight, as he gathers them all and cries for what he must see
In the darkened skies, he feels death descending with cold greed
