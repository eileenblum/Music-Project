Face a dark life they cannot see
It's for their own greed not humanity
And they make the choice that will be their fall
It's a terror nightmare, they blindly call - yea

And they say that there's no tomorrow
In the night, we only hear their cries from the dark side
(That) Call out the warning tonight
From the dark side - (they) call out the warning tonight

Safe in power they sit and wait
They can't understand their impending fate
And their cold steel eyes - bleeding hearts of stone
They can't hear their own, crying souls - no

[Chorus]

Fight the dark horse you've lived your lie
There's no time for last rites, it's time to die
Into waiting darkness below you'll fall
Hear the lost souls their warning calls you
