Waiting in a cold room dark for hours
And the time goes on so slow
Carried by desire for survival
From the crying wind that blows

Day into night - you can see their fear
It goes on, and on, and on
Cold is the night, as the time grows near
As we wait, and we hide, from the fallout

And we cry out
In the fallout, from the sky
In the fallout
And we hide out
From the fallout, in the sky

(The) Aftermath of cold light strikes the city
When the children raid the streets
Tell them they can live their lives in pity
For the dogs whose war they lead

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Fighting to forget the guilt and violence
But the pain it burns so deep
In their eyes that whisper sad defiance
Of a dream they'll never reach
