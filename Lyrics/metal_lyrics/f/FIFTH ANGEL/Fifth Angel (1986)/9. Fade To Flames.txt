Here in this silent world, I know it's sure
Only in days of cold could I speak the words
Now I'm cast out again, sent far away
There's nothing left of me, on my judgment day

Sailing an endless sea, chained down by the force in the sky
I feel like a criminal, that's fallen and been left to die
If I walked in the land below, I could return to the sea
And watched as this criminal reached evil and set himself free

(And) then he came, I did not feel the same
Promises made, then he just fades away

âNow he must crawl to me, lies burning his soulâ
âIf he feels the love again, then he'll be saved from belowâ
So he looked at him through the door, all the torture and pain in his eyes
There's a feeling I got when he spoke, that forbade me to reach for the sky

What did he say? He thought it was all insane
So he might die, then burn in fire

Laughing at Satan's door, I could not see where to run
And he looks through me once again, and he knows he has not won
Back in the endless sea, I'm leaving the darkness behind
Back in this silent world, I've fallen and been left to die

What could I say, in the end I'll just fade away
Why should I try, I'd just feed the fire
