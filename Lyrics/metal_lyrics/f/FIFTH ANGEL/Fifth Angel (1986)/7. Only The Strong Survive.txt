Follow a madness, called by your desire
Always unending, driving ever higher

You know how slim your chance is, trapped here alive
Fighting the circumstance
But you know, in the end, only the strong survive

Only the strong survive
Only the strong
Only the strong survive

Stealing a lifetime, things you take for greed
Falling forever, trying to succeed
