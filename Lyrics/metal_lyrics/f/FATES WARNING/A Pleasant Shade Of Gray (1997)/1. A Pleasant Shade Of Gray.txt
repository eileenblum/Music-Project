[Part I]

So where do we begin
And what else can we say?
When the lines are all drawn
What should we do today?

[Part II]

Are you listening
Am I here screaming?
Drowning in a silent sea
Or only dreaming?

Drifting in and out
His mind never rests
Lying in shadows
Replaying a thousand regrets

Can you hear me
Am I getting through?
A million miles away
Or here beside you?

Drifting in and out
His heart never forgets
Lying in shadows
Replaying a thousand regrets

And the minutes just pass
As the hours change
And the shifting sands
Slowly rearrange

Drifting in and out
His mind never rests
Lying in shadows
Replaying a thousand regrets

[Part III]

There's a cloud above us
And there's a shadow on us
And outside of us
Hangs this shade of gray

Rain falling
Hours crawling
All around this shade of gray

There's a chill about us
And there's a sadness with us
And deep within us
Lies this shade of gray

Rain falling
Hours crawling
All around this shade of gray
This shade of gray
"rain's falling, hours crawling"
This shade of gray
"rain's falling, hours crawling"

There's a space beside us
And there's miles between us
And all around us
Grows this shade of gray

Rain falling
Hours crawling
All around this shade of gray

Rain falling
Hours crawling
All around this shade of gray
This shade of gray
"rain's falling, hours crawling"
This shade of gray
"rain's falling, hours crawling"

[Part IV]

Listen
Only us breathing
And the rain keeping time
Dividing the silence
In a distant thunder

Listen
Only hearts beating
And the rain keeping time
Measuring out the minutes
And taking us under

[Part V]

Murdered in munich
Crucified in rome
Was killing time
On the long road home

Let nothing bleed into nothing
And did nothing
Let nothing bleed into nothing
And did nothing at all

Withered in winter
Wished away the night
Was out of mind
While out of sight

Let nothing bleed into nothing
And did nothing
Let nothing bleed into nothing
And did nothing at all

Let nothing bleed into nothing
And did nothing
Let nothing bleed into nothing
And did nothing at all

Watched the days just pass
As the seasons changed
And the shifting sands
Slowly rearranged

But I will not eulogize
I won't apologize
I will not defend
Anymore, anymore
I will not dramatize
I won't soliloquize
I will not pretend
Anymore, anymore

[Part VI]

I know that I don't know you
And you couldn't know me
But time and space collided
And here we are, here we are

I know that you don't understand
And I can't explain
But circumstance conspired
And here we are, here we are

"the time is four nineteen..."
"time flies..."
"???"
"the answer is no..."

And I know we can't turn back all the years
Time reflected in a shade of gray
But I often wonder what could have been
And I still hold on to yesterday

And I know we're not children any more
Innocence lost in a sea of gray
But I often wonder what else could be
And I still dream of running away

So where do we begin
And what else can we say?
When the lines are all drawn
What should we do today?

[Part VII]

Stare from the darkness
Hear the silence call?
Devise divisions, delay decisions,
Watch the hours crawl and...

Let nothing bleed into nothing
And do nothing?
Let nothing bleed into nothing
And do nothing at all?

Recite soliloquies
To shadows on the wall?
Revise revisions, reverse decisions
Watch our heros fall and...

Let nothing bleed into nothing
And do nothing?
Let nothing bleed into nothing
And do nothing at all?

"I want you to do me a favor..."
"I want you to get a gun...and just shoot me! shoot me!"

Let nothing bleed into nothing
And do nothing?
Let nothing bleed into nothing
And do nothing at all?

Let nothing bleed into nothing
And do nothing?
Let nothing bleed into nothing
And do nothing at all?

[Part VIII]

[Instrumental]

[Part IX]

Stayed up late last night
Lying here in bed
Looking for words
To say the things I left unsaid
Wind at my window
Whispers to me instead
And I lie alone
Writing letters in my head

Where you are, I am
Through nights that never end
Where you are, I am
In words I'll never send

Walked alone last night
Cold streets of could be anywhere
Looking for words
To share the thoughts I could not share
Road at my heels
Takes me away instead
And I walk alone
Writing letters in my head

Where you are, I am
Through streets that never end
Where you are, I am
In words I'll never send

Where you are, I am
Through nights that never end
Where you are, I am
In words I'll never send
Never, never send

Stayed up late last night
Lying here in bed
Still looking for words
Still writing letters in my head

[Part X]

[Instrumental]

[Part XI]

Do you think that I, that I remember
Do you think that I, that I recall
When you were falling
And I just watched it all?

Do you think that I, that I remember
Do you think that I, that I recall
When you were breaking
And I just let the pieces fall?

Don't you think that I remember
Don't you think that I recall
When you were alone, oh all alone
And I didn't hear, hear your call?
Call... hear your call, hear your call, hear your call...

[Part XII]

This shade of gray
This certain sadness
This cold morning light
And this silent madness
It hangs in the air
It hangs like a memory
It hangs like a cloud
It hangs on desperately
Between dark and light
Between was and be
Between young and old
Between you and me
Between you and me

I remember cities
And I remember rain
Like the sound of your voice, falling
These memories and more remain
I remember winter
And I remember strain
Like the sound of your voice, breaking
These memories and more remain
I remember the nights
And I remember pain
Like the sound of your voice, alone
These memories and more remain

So where do we begin
And what else can we say?
When the lines are all drawn
What should we do today?

Close our eyes awhile
As morning shadows play
And listen to the rain
Wash the long night away
Face to face we'll awake
To see another day
And with hope in our hearts
Embrace this shade of gray
This pleasant shade of gray
