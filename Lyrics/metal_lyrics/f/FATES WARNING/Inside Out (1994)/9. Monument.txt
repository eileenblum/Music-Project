There's a blind desire there's a drive
There's a need to leave some lasting feat
Something to hold, something to keep
A monument to complete

There's a written page there's a book
There's a search for something to say
Something to share, something to speak
A monument to convey

Is it fiction, is it confession
Is it passion or just a profession
Is it performance, is it expression
Is it passion or just an obsession

There's a photograph there's a frame
There's a time, a moment to confine
Something to save, something to see
A monument to enshrine

Is it performance, is it expression
Is it passion or just a profession
Is it fiction, is it confession
Is it passion or just an obsession

There's an empty room there's a blank page
There's a picture left incomplete
Something is lost, something remains
A monument to defeat

Is it fiction, is it confession
Is it passion or just a profession
Is it performance, is it expression
Is it passion or just an obsession
