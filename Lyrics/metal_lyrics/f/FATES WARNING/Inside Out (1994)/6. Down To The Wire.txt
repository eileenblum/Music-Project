Has it been so long
I can't remember what we last talked about
My friend, forgive me
Do you think of me as I think of you
I owe my life to ...

I hold on clutching to the hope that I'll be strong
When it comes down to the wire
I'll hold on to with every ounce of strength within me
When it comes down to the wire

Don't think I've not thought
Of what you mean to me, I do constantly
My friend, forgive me
Do you think of me as I think of you
I owe my life to . . .

I hold on clutching to the hope that I'll be strong
When it comes down to the wire
I'll hold on to with every ounce of strength within me
When it comes down to the wire

My friend, forgive me
Do you think of me as I think of you

I wish it were different
I wish I could take your pain
And now that I've found you
I feel like I've lost you again
