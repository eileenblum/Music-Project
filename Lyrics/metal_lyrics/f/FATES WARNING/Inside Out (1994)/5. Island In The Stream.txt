Have you stood at the edge of the world
Where the sea and sky collide
Looked out to a distant horizon
And dreamed of drifting away

Have you stood beneath a troubled sky
And watched the dark clouds gathering
Closed your eyes to the threatening tide
And woke to another day

Feel the cold winds all around you
Let the night circle and surround you
Breath deep the darkness that drowns you
Let your imagination take you

To where your sleepless mind rests
To where your thoughts all run free
To your island in the stream
Where you can dream at the edge of the world

To where your restless minds will sleep
To where our hearts will run free
To our island in the stream
Where we can dream at the edge of the world
