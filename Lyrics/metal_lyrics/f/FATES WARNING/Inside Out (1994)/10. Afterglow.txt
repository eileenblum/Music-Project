Twilight and I lie awake
Afterglow is all around me
I lie awake, in this light
And I wonder where you are tonight

Voices turn to silence
Echoes never fade away

Twilight and I lie awake
Afterglow is all around me

Voices turn to silence
Echoes never fade away
I lie awake listening
Wondering where you are today
