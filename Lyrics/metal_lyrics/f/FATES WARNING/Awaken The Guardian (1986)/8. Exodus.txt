Morning desert sun horizon rise above the sands of time
Mystic journey to Arcana travel starry spheres in trine
Sands of the dunes dust of the bones
Swallow the trace of creatures left behind
Gods of the fire fall from the sky reaped
All the fruit and plagued earth dry

Distant vision tempting water fall to me
Knees I'm going to drink it dry.
Blazing desert sun reflection on the water
He caught my eye
Up in a tree preying on me vulture of fear why don't you let me be
He said you're mine one day
Spit out the sand of the mirage
Be on your way

Exodus ascend the plane
Exile this medium of bondage
Far beyond the myriads of crypts and pyramids
Beyond the harpy vultures guarding their tombs
Arcana awaits.
Exodus ascend the plane
Exile this medium of bondage
Far beyond the prophecy of tyrant guardians
Traject the esoteric sisters they are mythical
Nah nah nah nah nahhhhh
Arcana awaits you.

Oh guardian predestination calls
Silent wind I felt what you said
Soon I'm exhumed for consummation
He charmed my soul with his book of the dead
He read it said beat no children
He will inhere the malignant fear in man
Sovereign the force more than emotion
It controls your destiny at hand

False guardian I will compel false as the fear of heaven and hell
I should have known its all a mirage just as well
The power of good will not be shown by conquering fear
Let it be known its a constant resist
While facing transformation
