[Matheos/Alder/Jarzombek]

My friend, it seems you've been
Where you belong
Take what you deserve, don't make it mine to carry now
Take what you deserve, and never make a sound

When words are walls I am the end
I'll make them fall, I am

Tearing walls down, I am
Tearing walls down, I am

It's happening
Can't you see the edge calling to us?
In spite of everything
That lives and moves

In silence I breathe again
I flow and descend
I'll take what I deserve but can you help me understand
Why should I deserve a solitary word?

When words are walls I am the end
I'll make them fall, I am

Tearing walls down, I am
Tearing walls down, I am
Tearing walls down, I am
Tearing walls down, I am
