[Matheos/Alder/Aresti]

So, we begin, a perfect launch a perfect wind
Pictures pave the road ahead
A winding way, a silent dread
Then I see

One thousand fires
Like stars they fill my eyes
One thousand fires
Flames burning midnight skies

Caution to wind, we push further to the end
And there she stands, all alone
Her tired eyes, her flesh and bone
And I see

One thousand fires
Like stars they fill my eyes
One thousand fires
Flames burning midnight skies

And it's never ending, this sky high white night
Feels like I'm descending out of reason
While mountains burn before my eyes
While mountains burn

Winters end is falling beneath ash on the wind
As the March flames take all away
With one glance, I felt her desperate eyes call to me
Then she turned to give herself away

And so we end, as we began so long ago
Pictures fade, the road behind
Still she stands, still she cries
