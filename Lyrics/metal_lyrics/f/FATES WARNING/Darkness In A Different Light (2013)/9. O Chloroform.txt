[Matheos/Alder/Moore]

See what you've done, holding your tongue
Now tell me who's the delirious one
So safe and warm o chloroform
Keep us from coming around again

Lets say the sun turns up again
Lets say its the same one that's ever come
No stars can round you up again
They're suffering so long, so long

That photograph tore you in half
So the sane can escape the past
True to form o chloroform
Get the windows and the door

Home on the border
You can write yourself a letter
Wave to the camera
And keep your body warm

Lets say the sun turns up again
Lets say its the same one that's ever come
No stars can round you up again
They're suffering so long, so long

And no one takes over when you fall asleep
Ten hours of eternity
Tell yourself and call yourself a refugee
We're suffering so long, so long
