[Bonus Disc Track][Music &amp; lyrics by Jim Matheos, Ray Alder]

Take away the part of me
That makes me feel that makes me see
The things that I don't want to be
At least I know that I can count on you

A step ahead I step behind
The things I fear, I've crossed the line
Into a world where I feel blind
I always know that I can count on you

Took the time to live a life
To see the world then say goodbye
To my old friends, I don't know why
I always know that I can count on you

Oh, and it's hard to stay this graceful when
I'm falling, falling
Oh, and I have to say that yesterday is calling

Now here I am with eyes shut tight
Not knowing if I'll see the light
Before it's too late in this life
I never knew I could not count on you
