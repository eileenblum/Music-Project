[Matheos/Alder]

Lying on the flood, the world carries on
Life does not wait for me
Trying to pretend that I was
Everything you believed

Drowning in my own desire
All your needs fail to inspire

Miles of vacant years run through my mind
Like headlight through the night

And oceans have their ways
Of getting between what I feel should be

Drowning in my own desire
All your needs fail to inspire

It's not over, it's not crashing down
What's the game, what's the prize?
And one moment of belief
Disturbs the quiet dream for you

When poetic moments
Aren't all they seem
Then reality becomes
The dream

Drowning in my own desire
All your needs fail to inspire
