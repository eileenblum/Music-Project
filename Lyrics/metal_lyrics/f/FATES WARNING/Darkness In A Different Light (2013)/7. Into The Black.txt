[Matheos/Alder]

Night is fallen above me, fallen
And I cling to hope and fate
Lingering passions calling
Now it seems they cannot wait

As I wander into the black
Far beyond far, I'm never coming back
Forgive me my darkness for living in light
No more shadows to hide behind

Time, a whispering frail lie, falling
On my deaf ears constantly
Somehow I feel that longing
To hold near what I can't see

As I wander into the black
Far beyond far, I'm never coming back
Forgive me my darkness for living in light
No more shadows to hide behind

This can't be, all that's left now
Light has turned it's back on me
The hourglass is out of sand
Too late to reach out my hand

As I wander into the black
Far beyond far, I'm never coming back
Forgive me my darkness for living in light
No more shadows to hide behind
