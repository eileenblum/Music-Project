[Bonus Disc Track][Music &amp; lyrics by Jim Matheos, Ray Alder]

There, in the silence of the night
I see you shine
Drifting down to me, drift down to me
Is this how it's supposed to be?

Will you stay, will you go?
Again, this time, how far?
Then you take, and you're gone
No longer need to wait here anymore

Fly, far away
I won't regret at all
Not asking you to stay
I can't make you understand
As I close my empty hand

And as I stand here
Watching stars go shooting by
A thought comes to me, it comes to me
This is how it's supposed to be

Fly, far away
I won't regret at all
Not asking you to stay
I can't make you understand
As I close my empty hand

And as night turns to day
Alone now I walk away
And as time changes
Your light fades into the gray

Will you stay, will you go?
Again, this time, how far?
Then you take, and you're gone
No longer need to wait here anymore

Fly, far away
I won't regret at all
Not asking you to stay
I can't make you understand
As I close these empty hands
