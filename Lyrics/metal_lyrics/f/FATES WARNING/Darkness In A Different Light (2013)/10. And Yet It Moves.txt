[Matheos]

Start towards morning
We leave the station
Long long miles, ahead
To an unknown destination
Landscape in gray
Meets a tired eye
Like the years unnoticed
It all just rushes by

Falling, floating
Feeling far removed and alone
Dreaming, driftin
No direction, destination unknown

Racing forward
Pushing through the haze
Slipping slowly back
And tripping through the days

Falling, floating
Feeling far removed and alone
Dreaming, driftin
No direction, destination unknown

Horizons shift
Sea and sky combine
Out there, somewhere
Distant points align

Perceptions blur
Time and space collide
Long days, years blaze
Across the great divide

Falling, floating
Lost and far from home
Dreaming, driftin
Destination unknown

Reflections dim
Day and night converge
Routine, unseen
The past and present merge

Falling, floating
Lost and far from home
Dreaming, driftin
Destination unknown

Eyes to the window
Watching the rain come down
Too soon it's over
And we're left with dry ground

And in the evening Shooting stars come passing through
Too soon it's over
And they drift from out of view

But now between sea and sky
Shadows are growing thin
Losing light, lost in time
As the night rolls in

And then under moon and stars
The long day fades and ends
All alone but not lonely
As darkness descends

In the moment all is well
Sea and sky slow and pause
You are small, days are long
And time stands still
(yet it moves, and yet it moves)

In this moment mind at rest
Moon and stars slow and pause
You are tired, nights are long
And time stands still
(yet it moves, and yet it moves)
