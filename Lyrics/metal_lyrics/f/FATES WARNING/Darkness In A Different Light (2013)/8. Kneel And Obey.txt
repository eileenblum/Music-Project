[Matheos]

Feel waters rise
Sink down below
Kneel and obey
Breath deep the flow

When the book is open wide
Bow down and pray
Salvation's what you need
Kneel and obey

Feel fires heat
Fall to your knees
Kneel and obey
Swim burning seas

When the book is open wide
Bow down and pray
Salvation's what you need
Kneel and obey

When the book is open wide
Bow down and pray
Salvation's what you need
Kneel and obey

Kneel
Obey
