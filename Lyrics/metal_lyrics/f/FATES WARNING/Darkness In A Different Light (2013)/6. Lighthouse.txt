[Matheos/Alder]

Through the rain there is hope ahead
Through the rain there will be a light for you
You believed in those faded maps
And now you find yourself lost and alone

Close to you and yet miles away
A lingering heart beats inside of you
A quiet answer to such fragile things
You're not alone, you're not alone

The lighthouse waits
It waits for you
The lighthouse waits
It waits for you

I know that now it's so hard to see
But in time you'll find, the light, waiting
Boundless and barren oceans surround
But when it's darkest, you'll see the light

You must open your eyes
Then you'll know that the thunder only crashes awhile
And the storm clouds will pass soon
Then you'll see that the lighthouse waits for you
The lighthouse waits

The lighthouse waits
It waits for you
The lighthouse waits
It waits for you
