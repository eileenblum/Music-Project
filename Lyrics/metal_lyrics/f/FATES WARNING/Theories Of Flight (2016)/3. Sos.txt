We wait for days
The hours can't replace
That moment of walking away

There's none to blame
But buildings still remain
Their empty halls fading away
And now I
I can feel the rain
Falling on me
I can see the waters rising
Undermining me

I can feel the rain
Wash over me
Can the places and the faces
In the flood be saved

Now the darkness fades
And thoughts fall in to place
Let the flood take away
The pain of yesterday

Sink or swim
Sink or swim
So now I

I can feel the rain
Falling on me
I can see the flood is rising
Undermining me

I can feel the rain
Wash over me
Can the places and the faces
In the flood be saved
