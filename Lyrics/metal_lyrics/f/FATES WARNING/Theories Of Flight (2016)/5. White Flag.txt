You've looked through eyes
Under darkened skies
Your world was standing still

No one's going to take your soul away
It's all your own
But innocence was gone, it's gone
No surrender, don't give up
Never carry that white flag
No surrender, now get up
Rise and bury your white flag

In the days that followed you
A new heart now is born
You'll never be alone

No surrender, don't give up
Never carry that white flag
No surrender, now get up
Rise and bury your white flag

And as days pass along
Know you've done no wrong
Few know sorrow as you did
You've made it, you've made it

As life dims and fades away
Like shadows in vain
And when all light is gone
I'll be there, waiting

The echoes there
Were more than most could bare
Yet no regrets at all

No one's going to take your soul away
It's all your own
But innocence was gone

No surrender, don't give up
Never carry that white flag
No surrender, now get up
Rise and bury your white flag
