See the dark road that's ahead
Lit by memories you knew
Now the ghosts begin to follow
Let it all come back to you

Chase that moment
Like stars our eyes have seen
They slip away, just through your fingers
Chase that moment
The forgotten become known
Once again, their shadows linger

Remomber November in Turin
And streets that said goodbye
Remember all those words that now haunt
The places that you've been

Some say the moon looks briken hearted
Alone in its orbit
Forget what they said when you departed
Those memories are your own

Chase that moment
Like stars our eyes have seen
They slip away, just through your fingers

Chase that moment
The forgotten become known
Once again, their shadows linger

Now the dark road lies in ruin
And the dawn becomes your friend
Stand in silence now we all know
That every road comes to an end

Chase that moment
Like stars our eyes have seen
They slip away, just through your fingers

Chase that moment
The forgotten become known
Once again, their shadows linger
