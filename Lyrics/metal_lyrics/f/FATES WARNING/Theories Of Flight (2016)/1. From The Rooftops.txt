See what there is to see
The view from the rooftops is the same
It seems there's no end
And the lights below burn cold

Thoughts of the past recede
They fade into history, and now the rain begins
Somehow everything seems right
Colors flood into the night
And eyes open then
There's no room for trying
Forget what was known
There's no use in hiding
From shadows unknown

No wall's ever lasted
Not brick, steel or stone
No thing lasts forever
Except the unknown

There's nothing that time can't end
How long can darkness live in the empty spaces
Until lights collapse and time misplaces
(All good things will have their end
How long till this time is over then)

How long till stars have faded and leave their traces
Before we collapse and time erases
(All good things will have their end
How long till this time is over then)

There's nothing that time can't end
There's no room for trying
Forget what was known
There's no use in hiding
From shadows unknown
There's nothing that time can't end
