You confess a lot of things
But you confess alone
The absense of a person brings
The burning question home

The nights are long, they turn to days
And sleep is not a friend
The voices though you hear them sing
Are only in your head
And you have not begun to fight
It slowly takes a toll
The burden of the little thing
Will never make you whole

I understand that feeling of dread, you're used to it
And thos empty promises are just the same
When our time had come to end, it's over then
It's over then, it's over

The light and shade of things
The light you held is gone
And although people change
I know it can't be far

The light and shade of things
And I can't understand
How one is more important
Than the other

You're nowhere now, you're nowhere now
I know that it's hard to find
A heart that's there inside
It's hard to find your heart now

Forget falling down, forget all that you've been
It's time to face those broken promises
Oh, burn the past, this thing has to end
I wish that it felt strange that you feel nothing

The light and shade of things
The light you held is gone
And although people change
I know it can't be far

The light and shade of things
And I can't understand
How one is more important
Than the other

You're nowhere now, you're nowhere now
I know that it's hard to find
A heart that's there inside
It's hard to find your heart now

Some roads are empty
Some roads just go on
And though you may walk alone, my friend
I know it won't be long

It's not over, not over yet
I know you can remember when
You gave away you heart in your hand
It's not over then, it's not over

I know, your heart is there
It's there inside
