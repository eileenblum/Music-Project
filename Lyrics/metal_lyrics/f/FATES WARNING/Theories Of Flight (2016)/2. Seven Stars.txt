Sometimes one photograph
Can make the whole world fade
You'll never be the same
You'll never be the same

While silent words were read
The miles still divide
You'll never be the same
You'll never be the same
Seven stars, destination
Calling out my name
Seven stars, destination
Take me far away

Then the slow walk we made
Turned the hours into days
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

What once was lost is found
And I cannot deny
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Seven stars, destination
Calling out my name
Seven stars, destination
Take me far away

Yesterday, I could never see
A future far beyond, forever
I would stay if you wanted me
I know where I belong, forever

So now face the day, make the change
When the story ends it now begins forever
And I've felt the flame, seen the light
Of your seven stars that burn at night, forever

Seven stars, destination
Calling out my name
Seven stars, destination
Take me far awa
