By black we ride, or so they say
Our need for reason, there greed is paid
Powers rumble for spiritual sway
Paths are laid then leaders stray

It's right then left, witch way to turn
Follow me or forever burn
We evil blessed, bring your soul to sell
All wish away into empty wells

Fortunes found in holy halls
Redeem your every fault
When dogmas given are blindly held
And treasures given caught
Any wish can only last
Until the spell's descried
While subtle, wicked ways
Fracture weakened minds

Slaves of a different kind march to broken bells
Freedom in a bind and make it all sound well
Blackened blue etched in glass forming outer walls
Tell clearly of the emptiness and mute distressful calls

Lines lead to dead ends where
Plays seen are never clear
And those who ride never fare

Crowned voids forever rule
In worlds lived and learned of fools
Conformity's the teachers' tool
