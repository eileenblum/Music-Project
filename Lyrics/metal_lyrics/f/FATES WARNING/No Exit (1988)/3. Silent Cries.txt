Born to an air of apathy
Indifference shapes a fragile mind.
Questions formed at an early age
Beg answers unasked

Silent cries

Behind curious eyes resides a child who cannot speak.

Silent cries

Years find a mind alone whose
Questions flow too deep for words.
Covered in a shroud of silence
Watching the world go by

Silent cries

Behind outcast eyes, hides a child who cannot speak.

Silent cries

Time blindly races on
Toward the autumn years
Seasons unheeded pass
While we all drown in tears.

Questions unanswered remain alone
They mourn a fragile mind

Silent cries

Behind lifeless eyes, lies a child who cannot speak.

Silent cries
Silent cries
