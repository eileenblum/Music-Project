We find ourselves in ruin
And it's come too far, how?
It's no use,
Too much allowed and abused.

Worlds apart,
They're excused.
When we've warned
They're amused.

We slip right by, and ignore
This sable scene.
We've lives to live,
It's all for one you see.
Why should we think to care,
Won't we soon disappear?

Worlds apart,
They're excused.
Balance waived as we speak.

Praised are those with fashions grand,
Self concern leads their plans.
A moment's craze and natural crime
Subserves a world to malignant minds.
