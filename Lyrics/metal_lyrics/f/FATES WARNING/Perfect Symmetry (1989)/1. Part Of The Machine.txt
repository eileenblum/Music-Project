Just another face in the crowd
Wandering towards obscurity
Driven by the dull desires
Of a worn out routine

Stagnant in the suffocating silence
Of emotional exile,
A fugitive from freedom
Surrenders to mediocrity.

A helpless voice
Starting to sink.
You could make a choice
But you never learned to think.

Weary and weakened
Victims fall prey
To vague ideals
And passionless play.
Systematic spontaneity
In synchronized society.

Immersed in the cause
And the call of the day,
Sacrificed inner needs
Give way.
To shared individuality
In collective reality.

A spirit of belonging
Satisfies your longing
But the truth is never seen.
False sense of freedom grows
But dependency shows
Your part of the machine.

A hopeless choice,
Searching for someone real.
You could find that voice
But you never learned to feel.
