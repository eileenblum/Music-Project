Its so cold in the shadow of distant lights
And the chilling wind slows our pace and tests our will
Still a voice whispers it will be over soon
And there we find the courage to climb the hill

Sometimes I lose sight of where I'm going
Fanned by a flame I can't remember
But distant lights still burn bright
And the road goes on forever

Year after year with renewed ambition
We scale the walls to find there's nothing there
Still idle hands clutch the empty page
With the passion of a desperate prayer

Sometimes I lose sight of where I'm going
Fanned by a flame I can't remember
But distant lights still burn bright
And the road goes on forever

And here we are again
The doors close behind us
And the road goes on and on and on and on...

Sometimes I lose sight of where I'm going
Fanned by a flame I can't remember
But distant lights still burn bright
And the road goes on forever
Forever...
