These walls are stained engraved with pain
You will find them under shadows casting shame
Some it's all they've ever known,
Angels of the fortunate sons come and go...
You may not
Entities pass in the night Guardians and the
Reaper fight the will to live shall win
Mares of hope ride through their dreams
Blinding light awakens sleeping dawn
It seems it was all a dream, an endless dream

I will wish upon a star I believe in you
And if my will has strayed afar I rememebered you
Will you remember me
I the one you sentenced Pennance unabsolved
Answer me save my will have you forgotten me

Pace the hallway blindman for a million
Miles of stars
His mind has seen. think you may he lives
In darkness
We're the dark he's seen the light of dream
Karen, she's been asleep forever
I know she hears me
She has so much to say,
The machine shoots sparks through
Her eggshell mind
A tear streams from her face
Into my hand, into my heart

I'm a fire without a flame
A helpless child without a name
With broken wings catch me I'm falling
I'm a question with no answer
Who are you that takes my life away from me
Unveil the bondaries of the black

I had a dream I was you strong as the fire
In your veins then when I called out your
Name I would remain to witness the pain
I am beyond silent black I will be back
As your guardian

Angels in white you have sacrificed
You witness and bury the pain
You walk hand and hand with the fear stricken child
Strengthen the weak and the lame
Pillar of pennance and lore
Perpetual journey into the realm the
Sovereign servitor
