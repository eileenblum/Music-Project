I thought I reached the final stage,
Time enough now to catch my breath.
Holding on to each fleeting moment,
Until the winds of change come blowing through.

And all the things I
Thought I needed
Go sailing out of you.

I thought I reached a new beginning;
Faint, distant glow on the horizon.
Holding on to the promise of the day,
Until the sunset hides sea from shore.

And all the things I
Thought I needed
Don't mean much anymore.

Circles within circles,
Hoping one more turn
Will bring us to the end.
When truth and fiction finally meet,
We find again
New beginnings become old ends.

Circles within circles,
Hoping one more turn
Will bring us to the end.
When the circles complete,
We find ourselves
Starting all over again.

Too many things left undone,
Too late to turn back,
I can change course before the end,
But when all is said and done,
All I really want is a chance
To start again.

Circles within circles,
Hoping one more turn
Will bring us the end.
When truth and fiction finally meet,
We find again
New beginnings become old ends.

Circles within circles,
Hoping one more turn
Will bring us to the end.
When the circles complete,
We find ourselves
Starting all over again.
