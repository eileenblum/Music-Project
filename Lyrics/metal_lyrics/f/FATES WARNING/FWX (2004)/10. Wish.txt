Was standing in the darkness
I was watching over you
And all the fears came drifting back
With every little breath you drew
Wished upon a falling star
Cold and pale against the night
And all the fears came drifting back
To cloud the view and steal the light

Was underneath a falling snow
I was lying next to you
And all the fears came floating down
With every little wind that blew
Wished upon a passing cloud
Cold and pale against the gray
And all the fears came floating down
To cloud the view and steal the day

May you never know this darkness
May you never be so blind
May you always know the peace
That I could never seen to find

May you never know this darkness
May you always see the light
May you always know the peace
That comforts you tonight

[Music &amp; Lyrics - Jim Matheos]
