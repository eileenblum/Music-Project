Down beneath my underlying thoughts
There lurks a silent scream
How can I breath when the weight
Of words crash down on me?

And I feel stranded
I can't take it
I'm wandering lost

Don't make me comfort you
Don't make me crawl inside your head
Don't make me comfort you
Don't make me crawl, crawl, crawl

I will take apart the view
And you will take apart the scene
Take away the mask of innocence
It doesn't suit you

Don't make me comfort you
Don't make me crawl inside your head
Don't make me comfort you
Don't make me crawl, crawl, crawl

And I feel stranded
I won't take it
I'm wandering lost

Don't make me comfort you
Don't make me crawl inside your head
Don't make me comfort you
Don't make me crawl, crawl, crawl
