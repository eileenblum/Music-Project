Her, with her loving eyes
Her, with her open arms
A shelter in the night
As we drift into sleep
A soothing voice singing
River wide ocean deep

Her, with her vacant eyes
Her, with her withered arms
 A vague promise of rain
Overhead storm clouds creep
A distant voice thundering
River wide ocean deep

Her, with her wild eyes
Her, with her clutching arms
A tempest pouring down
A flood no wall can keep
A drowning voice crying
River wide ocean deep

The ties that bind are the ties we keep
And she cried river wide ocean deep
The ties that bind are the ties we keep
Until we sleep, until we sleep

[Music &amp; Lyrics - Jim Matheos]
