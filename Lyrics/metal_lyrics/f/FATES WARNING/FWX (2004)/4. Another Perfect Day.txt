You tell me you love me
And I wonder why
The sun is overhead
But I can't see past the clouds in my eye
You show me what is real
And I just pretend
Another perfect day
And I wonder how it all will end

Another perfect day
And I will hide away
From all the sights and sounds
Another perfect day
And I will walk away
From all the light that surrounds

Shadows embrace this room
As I draw the shades tight
Close the curtains, shut out the day
Shut out the light

Another perfect day
And I will hide away
From all the sights and sounds
Another perfect day
And I will walk away
From all the light that surrounds

Lying awake again
Restless in this bed
Summer night whispers soft
But I can't sleep through the noise in my head
Soon the sun is rising
And I just descend
Another perfect day
And I wonder when it all will end

Another perfect day
And I will hide away
From all the sights and sounds
Another perfect day
And I will walk away
From all the light that surrounds

Another perfect day
And I will hide away
From all the sights and sounds
Another perfect day
And I will walk away
From all the light that surrounds
