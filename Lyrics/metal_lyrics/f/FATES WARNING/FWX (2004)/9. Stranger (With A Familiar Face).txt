Something in me
I don't understand, a demand
A threatening voice
With a firm command
A liar, a danger
A killer, a stranger

Yeah, I guess that's me

I will extol you
I will control you
I will pick you up
Just to let you down
I will desire you
I will tire of you
I will pull you in
Just to see you drown

Someone in me
I don't recognize, a disguise
A faint reflection
With far away eyes
A liar, a danger
A killer, a stranger

Yeah, I guess that's me

I will extol you
I will control you
I will pick you up
Just to let you down
I will desire you
I will tire of you
I will pull you in
Just to see you drown

I will extol you
I will control you
I will pick you up
Just to let you down
I will desire you
I will tire of you
I will pull you in
Just to see you drown

[Music &amp; Lyrics - Jim Matheos]
