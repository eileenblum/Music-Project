I move in slow motion
And the world Is no longer at my heels

I wither and falter somehow
I wither and fall silent now

Sometimes I say too much
Even when there is no one listening

I wither and falter somehow
I wither and fall silent now

Hey, are you out there
Did you feel my sacrifice
Hey, do you see me
Can you really be that blind
Hey, can you hear me
Are you out there in the night

I'm haunted by your voice
And you are satisfied
Your words are the cross I bear
And I am crucified
Heal me

Hey, have I reached you
Are you too far gone now
Take a look around you
I this what you had in mind

I'm haunted by your voice
And you are satisfied
Your words are the cross I bear
And I am crucified
Heal me

And now I've reached a part of me
That I know shouldn't be
A certain kind of calm
A false tranquillity
I see now what's in the dark
It's looking back at me
I see now what's in the dark
I'm looking back at me
