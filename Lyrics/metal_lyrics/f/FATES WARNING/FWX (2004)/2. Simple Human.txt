Stand right there man
I can see right through you
Make me understand
The mind within my head

Yeah, I am a simple human like you
Yeah, I am a simple human too

Speak what's on your mind
A simple thought, a reason
Some self righteous blind
Deconstructive thinking
I want to rip it away
I want to tear the walls down
Don't be afraid
You can't feel anything

Yeah, I am a simple human like you
Yeah, I am a simple human too

We're all caught
It's like a giant tangled web
We're all trapped going nowhere
Now you know, now you know

Yeah, I am a simple human like you
Yeah, I am a simple human too
Yeah, I am a simple human like you
Yeah, I am a simple human too
