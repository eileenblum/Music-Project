Left here long ago
Was passing through the years
I was waiting for the day
Chasing a distant star
While the sun just slipped away

Lost my way long ago
Was running in circles
I was drifting through the night
Tracing a fading star
Moving slowly out of sight

Lost my way, I lost my way back then
now it seems Iâm lost, it seems Iâm lost again

I left here long ago
Was someone else back then
I left here long ago
Now I'm leaving again

I lost my way long ago
Was somewhere else back then
I lost my way back then
And now I'm lost again

Everything changes
Everyone moves apart

Left here long ago
Now I'm staring into space
As my thoughts drift back to you
I'm facing a falling star
Moving swiftly out of view

Left here way, I left here way back then
now Iâm leaving, Iâm leaving again

I left here long ago
Was someone else back then
I left here long ago
Now I'm leaving again

I lost my way long ago
Was somewhere else back then
I lost my way back then
And now I'm lost again

I left here long ago
Was someone else back then
I left here long ago
Now I'm leaving again

I lost my way long ago
Was somewhere else back then
I lost my way back then
And now I'm lost again
