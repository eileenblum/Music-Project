Seven hours
And a handful of doubt
The candle burns quick now
And time is running out
I never asked for this
Yet somehow here we are
I never asked for this
Now I can't live without

Time moves
Time heals
Time slips
Time steals

Forty pages
And a handful of doubt
The eyes are tired now
And the words are fading out
I never asked for this
Yet somehow here we are
I never asked for this
Now I can't live without

Time flies
Time fills
Time wastes
Time kills

I will leave behind all of the hours
I will find a way, a way out
I will walk away from all the years
With a handful of doubt

I will leave behind all of the pages
I will live without, live without
I will walk away far from here
With just a handful of doubt

Twenty years
And a handful of doubt
The candle burns quick now
And time is running out

[Music &amp; Lyrics - Jim Matheos]
