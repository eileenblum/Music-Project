[Music: Matheos]

[Instrumental]

[Spoken words:]
"I say to you, there is only one way in which the world can be saved from itself and that is by the realisation that love overcometh all things.
That those who have gone before you are concerned for you, each one.
We come back to your world endeavouring to break down the barriers that you have created by foolishness and ignorance over the centuries and we knock at your door, hoping and praying that you will open just a little, that we may enter therein and save you from yourselves.
I think we were disconnected"
