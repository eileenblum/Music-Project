[Music &amp; lyrics: Matheos]

Feeling so strong
I feel so inspired
Like a man with all the words
I could move the world
If I weren't so tired

So, so tired
So, so tired
So

Feeling so proud
I feel so admired
Like a man on a stage
I could play the part
If I weren't so tired

So, so tired
So, so tired
So

Tired of mind
And all I think
Tired of thirst
And all that I drink
Tired of will
And all that I need
Tired of body
And all that I bleed
Tired of breath
And all that I breathe
Tired of heart
And all that I grieve
Tired of sight
And all that I see
Tired of you
And tired of me

Feeling so full
Nothing desired
Like a man with everything
I should be happy
But I'm only tired

So, so tired
So, so tired
So
