[originally by Kenny Wayne Shepherd]Night falls and I'm alone
Skin, yeah, chilled me to the bone
You turned and you ran, oh yeah
Oh slipped right from my hands

Yeah

Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
It don't mean much
Joker on jack
Match on a fire
Cold on ice
A dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's like blue on black

Blind, oh, but now I see
Truth, lies and in between
Wrong can't be undone, oh no
Well it slipped from the tip of your tongue

Yeah

Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
It don't mean much
Joker on jack
Match on a fire
Cold on ice
A dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's blue on black

Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
It don't mean much

Blue on black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
It don't mean much
Joker on jack
Match on a fire
Cold on ice
A dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's blue on black
Yeah, blue on black
Yeah, it's blue on black
Yeah, blue on black
