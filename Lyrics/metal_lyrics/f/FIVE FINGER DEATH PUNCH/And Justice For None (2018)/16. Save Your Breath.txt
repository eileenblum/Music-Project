Children of all ages, welcome to the game
Time to face your demons (Question the answers)
Wasted generation, raised by television
Come and choose your poison (Poison or cancer)

I can't be sympathetic
Repent repent, repent repent
Are you that blind?

Save my breath, 'cause no one is listening
There's no today if there's no tomorrow
Save your breath, 'cause no one can hear you
Another day in the life...
Save your breath

Life, bigger and better, sell your soul for whatever
Lie, so fucking clever (Nothing is sacred)
Priests and politicians, crime masked by religion
Faith with no contrition (Bring on your hatred)

I can't feel empathetic
Repent repent, repent repent
I'm not that blind

Save my breath, 'cause no one is listening
There's no today if there's no tomorrow
Save your breath, 'cause no one can hear you
Another day in the life...

Save my breath, 'cause no one is listening
There's no today if there's no tomorrow
Save your breath, 'cause no one can hear you
Another day in the life...
Save your breath

Repent repent, repent repent
Repent repent, repent repent

Save my breath, 'cause no one is listening
There's no today if there's no tomorrow
Save your breath, 'cause no one can hear you
Another day in the life...

Save my breath, 'cause no one is listening
There's no today if there's no tomorrow
Save your breath, 'cause no one can hear you
Another day in the life...
Save your breath

Repent repent, repent repent
Repent repent, repent repent
