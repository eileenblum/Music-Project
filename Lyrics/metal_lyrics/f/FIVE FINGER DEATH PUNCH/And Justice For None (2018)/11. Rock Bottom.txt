I ain't your bitch, I ain't your boy
I ain't no god damn motherfucking toy
I'm not dead, I'm still alive
You don't like it, you can go ahead and die

Rock bottom
I got nothing left to hide
Rock bottom
I got nothing left but pride
Rock bottom
Nothing left to say
Rock bottom
Don't bring that shit to me
Rock bottom

You're such a punk, you'll never see
What it's like to be a man like me
I refuse to be your kind
Have you lost your god damn motherfucking mind?

Rock bottom
I got nothing left to hide
Rock bottom
I got nothing left but pride
Rock bottom
Nothing left to say
Rock bottom
Don't bring that shit to me
Rock bottom
Rock bottom

Do you like blood? Cause I like mine
When you're not looking I'll be standing right behind
Can you taste blood? Cause I taste mine
You want the pain? Well I'm your motherfucking guy

I hit rock bottom
I got nothing left to hide
Rock bottom
I got nothing left but pride
Rock bottom
Nothing left to say
Rock bottom
Don't bring that shit to me
Rock bottom
Rock bottom
