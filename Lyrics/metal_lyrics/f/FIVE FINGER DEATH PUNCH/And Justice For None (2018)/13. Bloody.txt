I'm staring at the photographs
That used to make me smile
Now all they bring is rage
Flipping through the albums
We made for one another
I'm tearing out that page

I love to hate you
I hate to love you
How did heaven turn to hell?

I can't blame you for leaving me
I took more from you than I could give away
You can't blame me for turning face
Because everything became so bloody

Does it have to burn
Does it have to sting
When we say goodbye
Do you ever stop to think about
What you've done to me
'Cause I'm so bloody, bloody, bloody
'Cause I'm so bloody, bloody, bloody

I hate to love you
I love to hate you
I will never wish you well

I can't blame you for leaving me
I took more from you than I could give away
You can't blame me for turning face
Because everything became so bloody, bloody
Bloody, bloody yeah

The pain we shared, the laughs and cries
All the evil lullabies
It all went up in flames

I can't blame you for leaving me
I took more from you than I could give away
You can't blame me for turning face
Because everything became so bloody, bloody
Because everything became so bloody, bloody
Bloody, bloody
