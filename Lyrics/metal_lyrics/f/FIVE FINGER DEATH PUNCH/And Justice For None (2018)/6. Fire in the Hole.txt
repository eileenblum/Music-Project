I have a knife in my heart, I could never explain
Cloned from a killer, I crawled out the drain
Dark from the start, there's a short in my brain
To some it may hurt but to me it's just pain

Regret it? Never...
Forget it, this ain't a game
Ain't gonna talk it, I ain't ashamed (I ain't ashamed)
I'm gonna walk it, I'll never be tamed

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges then fire in the hole

Ugly I can be, what you know about me?
I'm a pirate and a thief and you'll never fucking see
There comes a point in time, put it all out on the line
I'm gonna get mine (mine), I come to take mine

Regret it? Never...
Forget it, this ain't a game
Ain't gonna talk it, I ain't ashamed (I ain't ashamed)
I'm gonna walk it, I'll never be tamed

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges then fire in the hole
Burn all the bridges then fire in the hole

You live - die
That's - life
You live - die
That's - life

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Whoa, whoa
Open windows, closing doors
God can't help us anymore
Souls forever come and go
Burn all the bridges then fire in the hole
Burn all the bridges then fire in the hole
