I didn't give up the fight
I gave up on what's right
Everything I should've believed
I don't care about the warnings
Just who I've become
You swore that I wouldn't succeed

I know that you're wrong
Insanity embraces me
It's what I chose and it's what I believe
I still stand here strong

I won't deny, deny
The sun never shines
It always rains on me
I can't deny, deny
That I haven't tried
No honor amongst us thieves
Inside, inside
I try to survive
Strangled by the waste
You can't deny, deny
That I never tried
It's always been on me

I'm just a bad seed
I'm just a bad seed
I'm just a bad seed

I gave up on the light
I gave into the night
I never knew how much I could bleed
When it's all said and done
I still stuck to my guns
I always knew what I couldn't take

Even if I'm wrong...
Honesty is everything
It's what I know and it's what I believe
I still stand here strong

I won't deny, deny
The sun never shines
It always rains on me
I can't deny, deny
That I haven't tried
No honor amongst us thieves
Inside, inside
I try to survive
Strangled by the waste
You can't deny, deny
That I never tried
It's always been on me

I'm just a bad seed
I'm just a bad seed
I'm just a bad seed
I'm just a bad seed
I'm just a bad seed

Yeah!
Bad seed!
Yeah!
Bad seed!
I'm just a bad seed

I won't deny, deny
The sun never shines
It always rains on me
I can't deny, deny
That I haven't tried
No honor amongst us thieves
Inside, inside
I try to survive
Strangled by the waste
You can't deny, deny
That I never tried
It's always been on me

I'm just a bad seed
