This wasn't supposed to be a love song,
Matter of fact this was about hate.
I fucking said it, I don't regret it
A little much or a little too late.

I turned away just one too many times
I'm tired of the reasons, sick of all the lies.
I looked away just one too many times
I'm tired of pretending, that I'm not here, not here to die.

You want my best, you get the worst
You're not the last and you ain't the fucking first
You gotta live, I live to die.
Screw that mother fuckers, fingers to the sky.

I turned away just one too many times
I'm tired of the reasons, sick of all the lies.
I looked away just one too many times
I'm tired of pretending, that I'm not here, not here to die.

I've been hated by better
I've been beaten by the best
It's not a game, it's a mother fucking test

I turned away just one too many times
I'm tired of the reasons, sick of all the lies.
I looked away just one too many times
I'm tired of pretending, that I'm not here, not here to die.
