I'm gazing upwards, a world I can't embrace
there's only thorns and splinters, venom in my veins
it's okey to cry out when it's driving you insane
but somehow, someday I'll have to face the pain

It's all gone cold
but noone wants to blame
it's all so wrong
but who am I to say

I'm begging for forgivness, everything I've done
if God is listening he knows I'm not the only one
it's okey to lash out from the rules that I've enslaved
but somehow, someday I'll have to turn the page

It's all gone cold
and noone wants to change
it's all so wrong
but noone wants to blame
it's all so cold
there's nothing left to gain
it's all so wrong
but who am I, who am I to say

My heart's an endless winter, filled with rage
I'm looking forward to forgetting yesterday

It's all gone cold
and noone wants to change
it's all so wrong
but noone wants to blame
it's all so cold
there's nothing left to gain
it's all so wrong
but who am I, who am I to say
