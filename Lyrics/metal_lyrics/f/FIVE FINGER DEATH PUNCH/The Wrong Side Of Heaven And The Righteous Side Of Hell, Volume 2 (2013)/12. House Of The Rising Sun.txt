There is a house in Sin City,
They call the Rising Sun 
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And God, I know I'm one 

My mother was a tailor 
She sewed my new bluejeans 
My father was a gamblin' man 
Down in Sin City

Now the only thing a gambler needs 
Is a suitcase and trunk 
And the only time he's satisfied 
Is when he's on a drunk 

Well, I got one foot on the platform 
The others on the train 
I'm goin' back to Sin City
To wear that ball and chain

Well mother tell your children 
Not to do what I have done 
Spend your lives in sin and misery 
In the House of the Rising Sun
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, there is a house in Sin City 
They call the Rising Sun 
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And God, I know I'm one.
