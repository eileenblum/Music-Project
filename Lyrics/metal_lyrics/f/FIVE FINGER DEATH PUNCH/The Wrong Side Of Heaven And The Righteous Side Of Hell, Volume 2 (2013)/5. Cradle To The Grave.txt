The blood that runs within my veins
Keeps me from ever ending up the same
The fire that's pushing me on and on and on
To me it's everything and it makes me fucking strong

Love me or hate me
I walk alone

Been called a monster, called a demon, called a fake
I'm not an idol, not an angel, not a saint
I walk alone, I always have, I'm not ashamed
A living nightmare from the cradle to the grave

The soul that lives within my chest
Just won't allow me to turn out like the rest
This heart that's driving me on and on and on
Has the same vision and it keeps me fucking strong

Love me or hate me
I walk alone

Been called a monster, called a demon, called a fake
I'm not an idol, not an angel, not a saint
I walk alone, I always have, I'm not ashamed
I've always been a living nightmare from the cradle to the grave

I walk alone

Been called a monster, called a demon, called a fake
I'm not an idol, not an angel, not a saint
I walk alone, I always have, I'm not ashamed
A living nightmare from the cradle to the grave

I walk alone

Been called a monster, called a demon, called a fake
I'm not an idol, not an angel, not a saint
I walk alone, I always have, I'm not ashamed
I'll always be a living nightmare from the cradle to the grave
