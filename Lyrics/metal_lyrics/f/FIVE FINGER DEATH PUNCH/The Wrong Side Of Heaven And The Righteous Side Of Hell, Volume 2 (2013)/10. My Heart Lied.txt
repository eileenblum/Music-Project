Another chapter in my life
The sun has set, only ashes left behind
It turns out I was always wrong
I always have been, and you knew it all along
I knew it all along

I gave you everything, everything but blood
Everything I had, and everything I've loved
You tore away and left me dead inside
Outside looking in, my heart lied

A whole new chapter in my life
A new beginning, can you see it through my eyes?
It turns out you're not always right
You never have been, and I knew it all the time
You knew it all the time

I gave you everything, everything but blood
Everything I had, and everything I've loved
You tore away and left me dead inside
Outside looking in, my heart lied

I gave you everything, everything but blood
Everything I had, and everything I've loved
You tore away and left me dead inside
Outside looking in, my heart lied

Outside looking in, my heart lied
