Once upon a time I swore I had a heart
Long before the world I know tore it all apart,
Once upon a time there was a part of me I shared
years before they took away the part of me that cared

I've been a thousand places 
and shook a million hands,
I don't know where I'm going
but I know just where I've been.

I've flown a million miles 
and I've rode so many more,
every day, a castaway, 
a vagabond, battleborn
battleborn

Once upon a time I had an open point of view,
That was just so long ago before I had a clue.
Was there such a time where I didn't stand alone?,
Was there ever a time, and how would I have known?

I've been a thousand places 
and shook a million hands,
I don't know where I'm going
but I know just where I've been.

I've flown a million miles 
and I've rode so many more,
every day, a castaway, 
a vagabond, battleborn
battleborn

every day, a castaway
a vagabond, battleborn
