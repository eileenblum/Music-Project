What kind of man would I be
If I accepted defeat
What would my eulogy read
Here lies a wasted soul

What would my destiny be
What sort of life would I lead
Consumed by apathy
Spinning out of control

[Chorus:]
It's how we live
How we live that defines us
What we change
And what we leave behind
You know you can't
You can't take it with you
Your day will come
It's just a matter of time

What type of man should I be
You know - so you tell me
Stomp out my identity
So I can be just like you

What kind of life should I lead
You'd have me down on my knees
Treat me like a I'm a disease
Fuck you

[Chorus]
