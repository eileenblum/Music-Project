[feat. Ryan Clark Of Demon Hunter]You stole my life - you've taken everything
Left me here to die
You wonder why - I wish you'd suffocate
And kiss your ass goodnight

It's the same old fucking story
The same old fucking lies
The same old fucking ending
With the fucking same good bye

I can't believe...

[Chorus:]
Now I know that
I don't belong - I don't care
You're a scar burned into my skin
Can't hold on - can't move on
You're the weight beneath my sin

You wish I'd die - you don't care how
And I know you don't care why
Can't see what you see - I know you're
Begging me
Begging me to bleed

It's the same old fucking story
The same old fucking lies
Without the same old ending
Without the same good byes

[Chorus]
