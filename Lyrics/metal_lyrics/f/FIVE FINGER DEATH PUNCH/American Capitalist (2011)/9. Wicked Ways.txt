I should've seen this
From a mile away
I should've never let you
Get that deep inside
You're an actress
I can't believe a word
You'd say anything
To get anywhere in life

Stumble back to where you came from
Wide awake and falling on your face
You've got an evil wicked way
Of saying I love you, I'd love to
Tear away from everything you are
You've got an evil wicked way about you, I hate you!

Like a virus
That spreads throughout my veins
You're incurable and such a waste of time
You're an angel
But only in your head,
You'll hurt anyone
To get anything in life

Slither back to where you came from
Wide awake and falling on your face
You've got an evil wicked way
Of saying I love you, I'd love to
Tear away from everything you are
You've got an evil wicked way about you, I hate you!

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?

Wide awake and falling on your face
You've got an evil wicked way
Of saying I love you, I'd love to
Tear away from everything you are
You've got an evil wicked way about you, I hate you!

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
