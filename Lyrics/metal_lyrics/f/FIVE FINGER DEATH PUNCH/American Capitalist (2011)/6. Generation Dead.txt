I look around and all I see is evil
Walking dead disguised as real people
It's kill or be killed 'cause life is not forever
It comes apart and then it falls together

I am what you made me
'Til death do I part

It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it

It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it anymore

We're generation dead
We're dead

You see yourself as such a fucking shepherd
But you trip the blind and then you curse the leper
Do you really want my true opinion?
You've taken more than you've ever given

You are what you are
Until death do you part

It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it

It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it anymore

Generation dead

It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it

It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it anymore

It's the world I've grown to know
Unforgiving and so cold
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it

It's a life I'm forced to live
I've got nothing more to give
Take it away
Take it away
I don't want it anymore

We're generation dead
We're dead
