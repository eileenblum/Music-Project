I owe you nothing
I've given everything and more
I stand for something
The blood on my hands, the broken bones, I live it

Knife in my back, you can't take it back
Eye for an eye it's cut and dry
I'll do what I know, reap what I sow
While you're waiting for me to fail

(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm dragging everybody down
If I fall I will take everybody down
(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm taking everybody out
If I fall I will take everybody down

I'm not a voice of reason
Never been too big on fate
Seeing is believing
You run from it all, you stumble and crawl, I hate it

Knife in your back, I won't take it back
Live and let die, the art of a lie
You do what you know, you reap what you sow
And I'll be waiting for you to fail

(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm dragging everybody down
If I fall I will take everybody down
(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm taking everybody out
If I fall I will take everybody down

Heeeyyyahh [x5]

If I fall, if I fall
I'm taking everybody down
If I fall I will!

(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm dragging everybody down
If I fall I will take everybody down
(If I fall)
If I fall, fuck you all
I'm taking everybody out
If I fall I will take everybody down

(If I fall, if I fall, if I fall)
If I fall I will
