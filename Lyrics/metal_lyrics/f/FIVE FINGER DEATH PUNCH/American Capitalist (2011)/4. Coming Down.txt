Itâs caving in around me
What I thought was solid ground
I tried to look the other way
But I couldnât turn around

Itâs OK for you to hate me
For all the things Iâve done
Iâve made a few mistakes
But I'm not the only one

Step away from the ledge
I'm coming down

I could never be
What you want me to
You pull me under
To save yourself (save yourself)

You will never see
Whatâs inside of me
I pull you under
Just to save myself

Was there ever any question
On how much I could take
You kept feeding me your bullshit
Hoping I would break

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone who cares?
Is there anybody listening
Will they hear my final prayers?

Step away from the ledge
I'm coming down

I could never be
What you want me to
You pull me under
To save yourself (save yourself)

You will never see
Whatâs inside of me
I pull you under
Just to save myself (save  myself)

Itâs caving in around me (caving in)
It's tearing me apart (tearing me)
Itâs all coming down around me (coming down)
Does anyone, anyone
Care at all

I will never be
What you want me to
You pull me under
I pull you under

I could never be
What you want me to
You pull me under
To save yourself (save yourself)

You will never see
Whatâs inside of me
I pull you under
Just to save myself
