Hate your goddamn, motherfucking, shitty ass band
Hate the way you've got my back while you're holding out your hand
Hate the way you pussies talk shit, hiding on the web
Just the fact you think you know me makes me fucked up in the head
Hate your nails, hate your hair, hate the fact I even care
Hate the way you said you loved me but you fucking weren't there
Hate your friends, hate your folks, hate your stupid fucking hopes
Ain't no way I'd try to change when the whole thing was a joke

I...hate...you...
That's an understatement
I...hate...you...
For who you are

I hate you
And all you stand for
I don't care
Anymore
I gave you
100 chances
You gave me
A 100 ways to hate

Hate your face, hate your lies and the blank look in your eyes
Hate your needs, hate your wants, hate the way you look and talk
Hate your voice, makes me cringe every time I hear you speak
It's uncomfortable to know you share the same air as me
Hate your lack of common sense and I'm tired of compromising
Take a good look in the end, 'cause it's just on the horizon
I've been wrong about a lot of shit, this I know is true
There's a 100 fucking things that I hate about you

I...hate...you...
That's an understatement
I...hate...you...
For who you are

I hate you
And all you stand for
I don't care
Anymore
I gave you
100 chances
You gave me
A 100 ways to hate

I hate you
100 ways
I don't care
100 ways to hate
I gave you
A million chances
You gave me
A 100 ways to hate

A 100 ways
A 100 ways to hate
