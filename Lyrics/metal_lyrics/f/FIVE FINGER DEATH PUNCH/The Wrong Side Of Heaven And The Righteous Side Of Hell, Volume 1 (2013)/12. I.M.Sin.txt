[feat. Max Cavalera]What a fucking poser, that's all you'll ever be!
Don't get any closer, or you'll meet the real me!

Eu sou quem eu sou, voce nao me descreve
Eu sou o que sou, Voce nao me nega, nao

I want out, but I could never surrender.
Try and brake me down, but I wonât let you win.
You can call me out, but I know youâre a pretender.
You may think your god, but I know that I am sin!

I am SIN! I am SIN!
I am SIN! I am SIN!

Eu nao vou me vender
Nunca fiz e nunca farei
Voce continua
So espero o sangue a escorrer

You are, who you are, I can't explain it!
You are, what you are, to me you're not shit.
No!

I want out, but I could never surrender.
Try and brake me down, but I wonât let you win.
You can call me out, but I know youâre a pretender.
You may think your god, but I know that I am sin!
I am SIN!

If there was ever a time you needed to walk the fuck away,
It's right fucking now, right fucking here!

I want out, but I could never surrender.
Try and brake me down, but I wonât let you win.
You can call me out, but I know youâre a pretender.
You may think your god, but I know that I am sin!

I am SIN! I am SIN!
I am SIN! I am SIN!
