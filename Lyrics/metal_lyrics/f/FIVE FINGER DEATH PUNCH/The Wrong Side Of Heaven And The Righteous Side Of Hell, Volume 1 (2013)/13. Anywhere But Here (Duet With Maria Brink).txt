Some say a storm is coming,
some say the end is near,
some think itâs all so hazy,
I think it's all so clear.

If it all ends tomorrow,
if it all disappears,
where do you think you're going?
Anywhere else but here!

I don't claim to have the reasons!
All I know is, if the world stops spinning tomorrow,
I'd never she'd a tear! I'd rather be anywhere,
anywhere, anywhere but here!

Some say they have the answers,
some say they know the truth,
some people live in question,
some people have no clue.

If there was no tomorrow,
if there was just today,
would you make different choices?
Or would you stay the same?

I don't claim to have the reasons!
All I know is, if the world stops spinning tomorrow,
I'd never she'd a tear! I'd rather be anywhere,
anywhere, anywhere but here!

If there was no tomorrow,
if there was no tomorrow,
if there was no tomorrow,
would you stay The SAME?

If there was no tomorrow,
if there was no tomorrow,
if there was no tomorrow,
would you stay The SAME?

If the world stops spinning tomorrow,
I'd never she'd a tear! I'd rather be anywhere,
anywhere, anywhere but here!

If the world stops spinning tomorrow,
I'd never she'd a tear! I'd rather be anywhere,
anywhere, anywhere but here!
