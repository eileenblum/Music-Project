I'd give anything just to cut you free.
I'd give blood just to watch you,
(Just to watch you) BLEED!

I see through you and all your lies.
You are everything that I despise.
You wonât take shit when you leave.
What the hell do you want from me?

I'm over it, so over it, this is goodbye!
I'd give anything just to cut you free.
I'd give blood just to make you,
Just to watch you BLEED!

I know you better then you do.
I'm to fucking blame, so are you.
It wonât kill me to watch you leave.
What the fuck do you want from me?

I'm over it, so over it, this is goodbye.
I'd give anything just to cut you free.
I'd give blood just to make you,
Just to watch you BLEED!

(Just to make you, Just to watch you)
(Just to make you, Just to watch you)
BLEED

I'd give anything, just to cut you free.
I'd give blood, just to make you,
Just to watch you BLEED!

I'd give anything, just to cut you free.
I'd give blood, just to make you,
Just to watch you BLEED!

I'd give anything, just to cut you free.
I'd give blood, just to make you,
Just to watch you BLEED!
