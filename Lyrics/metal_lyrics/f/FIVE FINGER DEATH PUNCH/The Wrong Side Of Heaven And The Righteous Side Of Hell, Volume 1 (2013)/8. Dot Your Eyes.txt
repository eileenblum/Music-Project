[feat. Jamey Jasta]My life is prefect, so you believe.
Are you that stupid? Cuz I strongly disagree.
I'm not a liar, more like a thief.
Your rules are twisted and they don't affect me.

You saw me coming, so why you running?
What's the matter, it's just little old me.
I know your kind, you're fucking blind.
I give a shit, don't give a shit about anything.

There ain't nothing in this world for free.
There's not a man, not a man I believe.
Give a ratâs ass what you think about me.
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth.

Bring it!

You're just a trip. It's got to end.
I stand in place while you mother fuckers bend.
You own a clock, your time is up.
You bottom feeders, it's just time to give up.

Ready to throw down, this is a show down.
You get the memo, cuz it's all about to go down.
I know I'm twisted, I can't resist it.
I give a shit, don't give a shit about anything.

There ain't nothing in this world for free.
There's not a man, not a man I believe.
Give a ratâs ass what you think about me.
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth.

Bring it!

There's nothing in this world for me.
I gave away, gave away fucking everything.
This is the man that I'm choosing to be.
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth.

Pressure's building breaking down.
Suffocating till I drown!

You know how the saying goes?
It's not the size of the dog in the fight.
It's the size of the fight in the dog.

YEAH, Bring it!
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
There's not a man, not a man I believe.
Give a ratâs ass what you think about me.
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth.

Bring it!
There's nothing in this world for me.
I gave away, gave away fucking everything.
This is the man that I'm choosing to be.
I'll dots your eyes and cross your fucking teeth.

Bring it!
