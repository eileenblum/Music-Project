I'm
Never gonna live, never gonna give
Never gonna die your way
Fuck No! go away
Never gonna try, never wonder why never gonna change
No, say it, what
Never understand, never gave a damn

Never see it through your eyes
Fuck you, no way
Never understand never lend a hand never see it through my eyes
There's a fire within, hate to admit it, but always knew violence and sin
keeps me fearless keeps me from being...

You - so dated
You - outdated
You - so fading away
You - can't take it
You - just fake it
You - are just in my way
I don't give a fuck about you!

I'm
Never gonna quit, never gave a shit
Never gonna walk away
Fuck you! all day
Never gonna drop, never gonna stop never gonna fall
No, what, say it
Never understood, never really could
Never saw it through your eyes
Fuck off, no way
Never understand never give a damn never gonna change my mind
There's a fire within, hate to admit it, but always knew violence and sin,
keeps me fearless keeps me from being...
