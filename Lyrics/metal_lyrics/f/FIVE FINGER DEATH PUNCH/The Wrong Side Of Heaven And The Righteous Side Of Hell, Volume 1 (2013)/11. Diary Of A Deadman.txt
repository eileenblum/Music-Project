Looking back I still have so many questions
So many things unanswered
Like what did I do?
What could I do?
Was there ever a moment you cared?

Was I always ugly and abbanded
Remember all the times you wished me harm?
You wished me dead
How can I have changed to make it better?
And would I?
Would I?
Would I?

I still feel so much hate inside of me
Seems like you were just waiting for me to fail
I'm sorry I can't forgive you
Do you blame me?
You never forgave me

I've tried to grow from this
Every day is a new challenge
Because with you there is just no winning
Like it is not I'm still a part of you
And you're still a part of me

Like it or not you're still a part of me
Yeah

So this is how it is
All the tears, all the blood
It's all gone for nothing
As the candle dwindles, then freakes out
In the end
