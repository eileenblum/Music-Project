My heart is frozen
My soul's been broken
The whole world's on my mother fuckin' shoulders
and I can't seem to control it
I can't contain it
And I just don't give a shit
You need to feel the way that I feel
but you'll never fuckin' know it

Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
You try but you can't reach me
Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
There is nothing you can't teach me
In hell
Motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
I swear you'll out to get me
Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
I live but you won't let me
BURN

Your life's been wasted
You'll die forsaken
You act like the world's on your shoulders
But its not there so you fake it
Do you embrace it
How do you take it
I'll never feel the way that you feel
I'd rather fucking brake it

Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
You try but you can't reach me
Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
There is nothing you can't teach me
In hell
Motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
I swear you'll out to get me
Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
I live but you won't let me

Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn [x3]
BURN MOTHERFUCKER BURN

BURN!!!

Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn [x3]
BURN MOTHERFUCKER

Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
You try but you can't reach me
Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
There is nothing you can't teach me
In hell
Motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
I swear you'll out to get me
Burn motherfucker burn motherfucker burn
I live but you won't let me
BURN

BUUURRRRNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
