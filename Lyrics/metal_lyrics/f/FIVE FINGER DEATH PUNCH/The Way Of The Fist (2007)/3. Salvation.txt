Disgusted by your weakness!!
You have NO right to live!!
To know you... Is to HATE you!!
But your life's, yours to give!!

You monkey see: You monkey do!!
You're always doing what they tell you to!!
You're such a puppet on a string!!
YOU DON'T GET IT!!??!!

I won't bow to something that I've never seen.
I can't believe in something that doesn't believe in me!
I'm not Blood of Your Blood!
I'm no son of your God!!
I've no faith in your fate!!
..STILL I FIND SALVATION!!

[guitar solo]

YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE ANSWERS... TO EVERY LAST DETAIL!?!
IN YOUR EYES YOU'RE THE "VICTOR"!?!
IN MINE YOU'VE ALL, BUT FAILED!!!!

You monkey see: You monkey do!!
You're always doing what they tell you to!!
You're such a puppet on a string!!
YOU DON'T GET IT!!??!!
