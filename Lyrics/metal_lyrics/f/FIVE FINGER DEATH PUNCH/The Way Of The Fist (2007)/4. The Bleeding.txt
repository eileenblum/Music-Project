I remember when all the games began.
Remember every little lie
and every last goodbye.
Promises you broke, words you choked on
and I never walked away. Its still a mystery to me

Well I'm so empty
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me.
Well you're so UNCLEAN!!
I'm better off without you and YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME!!

THE LYING!!
THE BLEEDING!!
THE SCREAMING!!!
WAS TEARING ME APART!!
THE HATRED!!
DECEIVING!!
THE BLEEDING!!
IT'S OVER!!!

Paint the mirrors black (to forget you)
I still picture your face and the way you used to taste.
Roses in a glass dead and wilted.
To you this all was nothing,
everything to you is nothing

Well you're so filthy...
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me.
Well I'm so UGLY!!
You're better off without me and I'M BETTER OFF WITHOUT!!!

THE LYING!!
THE BLEEDING!!
THE SCREAMING!!
WAS TEARING ME APART!!!
THE HATRED!!
THE BEATINGS!!
DISASTER!!!
IT'S OVER!!

As wicked as you are...you're beautiful to me.
You're the darkest burning star, your MY PERFECT DISEASE!

THE LYING!!
THE BLEEDING!!
THE SCREAMING!!!
WAS TEARING ME APART!!
THE HATRED!!
THE BEATINGS!!
IT'S OVER!!!
DISASTER!!
