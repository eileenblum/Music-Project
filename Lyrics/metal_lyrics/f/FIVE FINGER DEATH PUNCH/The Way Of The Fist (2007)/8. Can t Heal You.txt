The deeper you get,
the farther you fall down.
the closer I get,
the more you dissolve
You're lost inside
your pale addictions
Bury you with the demons in the ash
Can't heal you, don't want to, cause you can't save your fucking self.
Can't heal you, don't need to, cause you won't save yourself.
YOU ARE THE ONE who made the decision, stuck in a prison shattered and broken,
I am the one who expected to heal you save you from drowning in your endless nightmare.
Blessed be
The disillusioned
the banished misfit and the cursed hollow son
Can't heal you, I don't want to, cause you can't save yourself.
Can't help you, don't need to, cause you won't save yourself.

We're taught to perish, but fade away. Become the haunted and die as slaves.
Can't heal you, I don't want to, cause you can't save yourself.
Can't help you, don't need to, cause you won't save yourself
Can't heal you, don't want to, cause you can't save yourfuckingself.
Can't heal you, don't need to, cause you won't save yourself.
FUCK- FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!!!
