Its days like this I wish that I had stayed asleep!!
It's times like these that make it so difficult to be!!
The light at the end, the crack in the sky, there's NO promise for release!?!
No way for me to get away!!
And all I'm trying to do is breathe!!

[1st chorus]
Searching... For SOMETHING more!?
Searching.... For SOMETHING right!?
Searching... For a sense of clarity!!
Searching.... FOR A PLACE TO DIE!!!!

Days like this I really wish... I really wish I wasn't ME!!
Its times like this that make it hard... makes it hard to fucking see!!
No light at the end!! No crack in the sky!! EVERYONE ends up DECEASED!!
A life like mine makes a man!! Turns a grown man to a flea!!

[2nd chorus]

[guitar solo into bridge]

[bridge]
Piece by Piece, I slowly fade away... I slowly drift apart.
I see a different world, closing in on the future.
Sorry to be so cynical... but it's all I know!
Piece by Piece, I slowly start to change... I SLOWLY START TO CHANGE!!!!

Its days like this I wish that I had stayed asleep!!
It's times like these that make it SO difficult to be!!
No light in THE END!?! No crack in the sky!?!
EVERYONE ends up deceased!!!!
A LIFE LIKE MINE... MAKES A MAN!!
TURNS A GROWN MAN TO A FLEA!!!!!!

[last chorus]
SEARCHING... FOR A PLACE TO DIE!
