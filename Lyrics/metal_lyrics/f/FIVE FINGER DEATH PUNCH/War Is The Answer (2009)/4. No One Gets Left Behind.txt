No one gets left behind, another fallen soul
No one gets left behind, another broken home
No one gets left behind, we stand and fight together
No one gets left behind, or we all die alone

Politicians bathing their greed
No idea how to be all they can be

Have you no honor? Have you no soul?
What is it your dying for? do you really even know?
Have you no backbone? Have you no spine?
Whatever happened to No one gets left behind

No one gets left behind, I know you made it up
No one gets left behind, It's war for money
No one gets left behind, Drink from the golden cup
No one gets left behind, Your time is coming

Play your wargames with other people's lives
It should be you on the front line

Have you no honor? Have you no soul?
What is it your dying for? do you really even know?
Have you no backbone? Have you no spine?
Whatever happened to No one gets left behind
No one gets left behind, I know you made it up
