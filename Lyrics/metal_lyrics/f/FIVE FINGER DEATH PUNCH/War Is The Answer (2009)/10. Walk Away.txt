I'm sorry for the Demon I've become
You should be sorry for the angel you are not
I apologize for the cruel things that I did
But I don't regret one single word I said

Just walk away
Make it easy on yourself
Just walk away
Please release me from this hell
Just walk away
There's just nothing left to feel
Just walk away
Pretend that none of this is real

Would you forgive me
If I told you that I cared
Would you be sorry
If I swore that I'd be there
Please forgive me
For laughing when you fall
I'm so sorry
But I never cared at all

Just walk away
Make it easy on yourself
Just walk away
Please release me from this hell
Just walk away
There's just nothing left to feel
Just walk away
Pretend that none of this is....
None of this is...

Just walk away
Make it easy on us both
Just walk away
There was never any hope
Just walk away
You already know the deal
Just walk away
Pretend that none of this
No, none of this was real
