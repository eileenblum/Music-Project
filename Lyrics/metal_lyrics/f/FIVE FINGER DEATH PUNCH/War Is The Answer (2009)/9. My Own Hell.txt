Twisting and turning unable to sleep
Do the voices ever stop
My thoughts speak louder the more I resist
And they're driving me insane
Do they ever go?

Inside
I'm a danger to myself
(I'm a danger to myself)
Inside
I'm a prisoner of my own hell
(Of my own hell)

Losing the battle I waged on myself
Lock me up and toss the key
Toys in the attic it's all getting worse
Why won't I let me be
Oh god make it stop

Inside
I'm a danger to myself
(I'm a danger to myself)
Inside
I'm a prisoner of my own hell
(Of my own hell)

Fit me for a strait jacket
Put me in a padded cell
I'm a danger to you all
And I'm a danger to myself

Inside
I'm a danger to myself
(I'm a danger to myself)
Inside
I'm a prisoner of my own hell
(Of my own hell)
