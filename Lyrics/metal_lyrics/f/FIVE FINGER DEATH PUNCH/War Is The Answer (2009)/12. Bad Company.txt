[originally by Bad Company]A company
Always on the run
A destiny
It's the rising sun
I was born
A shotgun in my hands
Behind the gun
I'll make my final stand

And that's why they call me
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad bad company till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

Rebel souls
Deserters we've been called
Chose a gun
And threw away the sun
Now these towns will all know our name
The death punch is our claim to fame

And that's why they call me
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad bad company till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

Eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood
We've all gotta die
We've all gotta die

And that's why they call me
Bad company
I won't deny
Bad bad company till the day I die

Bad company
I won't deny
Bad bad company till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
