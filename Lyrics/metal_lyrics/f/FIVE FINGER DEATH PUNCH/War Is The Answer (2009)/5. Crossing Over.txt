Perched alone he sits there broken
An elder man with storm clouds setting in his eyes
He counts the sands of time, remembering days gone by
it's seemed like yesterday before it washed away

Hey don't wait for me there, just find your own way
Hey don't wait for me there, I'll be there soon enough

A widows life ticks out like clock work
A thousand tears she's cried a hundred times before
But now that he is gone, she's ready to move on
It all just fell away, it seems like yesterday

Hey don't wait for me there, just find your own way
Hey don't wait for me there, I'll be there soon enough

I'll be there soon enough
