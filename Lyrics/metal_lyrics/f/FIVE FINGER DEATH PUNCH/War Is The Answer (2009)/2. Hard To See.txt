I'm growing so distant
Nothing makes sense to me anymore
I'm learning to resist
Becoming more than you ever we're

[Chorus:]
Can't explain
What's come over me
Come over me
Can't explain
Why it's so hard for me
So hard to see your side

Rejecting all my anger
I can't seem to get this through to you
The walls are closing in
I dare you to walk in my shoes

[Chorus]

Your side
I won't see your side

[Chorus x2]

I won't see your side
Your side
