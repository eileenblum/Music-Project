[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]It's not enough
It's not enough
It never was or will be
I never had the chance to thank you
(FOR RIPPING OUT MY HEART)

It's not enough
It's not enough
It never was or will be
I never got the chance to say
(FUCK YOU)

[Verse 1:]
I don't want to be your tourniquet
For minor lacerations
Don't wanna be your Romeo
Because you're no Goddamn Juliet
(you always did know just what to say; insult and injury)
(YOU JUST LOVE TO HATE ME!)

[Chorus:]
It's not enough
It's not enough
It never was or will be
I never had the chance to thank you
(FOR RIPPING OUT MY HEART)

It's not enough
It's not enough
It never was or will be
I never got the chance to say
(FUCK YOU)

[Verse 2:]
You've got a gun
I've got a gun
Let's write a tragic ending
Don't wanna be this way again
Don't wanna be the one to blame
(you can have the high roads; I'll take I, disguise the frailty)
(I JUST LOVE TO HATE YOU!)

[Chorus:]
It's not enough
It's not enough
It never was or will be
I never had the chance to thank you
(FOR RIPPING OUT MY HEART)

It's not enough
It's not enough
It never was or will be
I never got the chance to say
(FUCK YOU)

[Outro:]
(YOU JUST LOVE TO HATE ME!)
It's not enough
It's not enough
It never was or will be
I never had the chance to thank you
(FOR RIPPING OUT MY HEART)

It's not enough
It's not enough
It never was or will be
I never got the chance to say
(FUCK YOU)
