[Bonus Track]

Sometimes the things get so jaded
Still my heart slowly beats
Sometimes life gets complicated
Still the world around me sleeps

I'm ashamed, not to blame
don't wanna think about it
Who I am, what I've done
How do I carry on?
Wanna change, turn the page
don't wanna think about it
How do I undo what's done?
Undo what's done!

Sometimes the things get so faded
How is it that you can't see?
Sometimes life seems overrated
Makes my heart slowly bleed

I'm ashamed, not to blame
don't wanna think about it
Who I am, What I've done
How do I carry on?
Wanna change, turn the page
don't wanna think about it
How do I undo what's done?

Undo what's done! [x3]

I'm ashamed, not to blame
don't wanna think about it
Who I am, What I've done
How do I carry on?
Wanna change, turn the page
don't wanna think about it
How do I undo what's done?

I'm ashamed, not to blame
don't wanna think about it
Who I am, What I've done
How do I carry on?
Wanna change, turn the page
don't wanna think about it
How do I undo what's done?
