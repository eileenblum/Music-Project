Charge!!!
Imma fucking solider
Just like I told ya
While I'm just warming it up
You're getting colder
Out on the battleground
Lets take a look around
There's a million of us
Ready to throw down
They'll never take me alive
Hit the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back
'Cause I got your six
Wont go down
Never gonna quit
Don't turn back
'Cause I got your six
You know I got your back
They'll never take that
Until the bitter end
You know I'll never crack
I'll face an army
Cant fucking harm me
Out on the front line
That's where you'll find me
They'll never take me alive
Hit the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back
'Cause I got your six
Wont go down
Never gonna quit
Don't turn back
'Cause I got your six
I will never accept defeat
And I will never quit
I got your six
I got your six
Hit the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back
'Cause I got your six
Wont go down
Never gonna quit
Don't turn back
'Cause I got your six
Hit the pit
Blood on the bricks
Don't look back
'Cause I got your six
Wont go down
Never gonna quit
Don't turn back
'Cause I got your six
I got your six
I got your six
