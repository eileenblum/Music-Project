[Deluxe Edition Bonus Trackil]Let's take a walk down memory lane
When I was just a boy and I wasn't insane
Back before the world got inside of my heart
Before all the sickness almost tore me apart
Corruption, deception
Natural progression, denial
Was a drug that I couldn't refuse
Now I'm just a puppet
Always sticking to myself here
Blame it on myself
But I know it was you
I know it was you
Here we go again
Like turns, another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind
Here I go again
Like sphinx, another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind
You're not my kind
My dad was a killer, a cold blooded guerrilla
Something that I can never perceive
Mom was just a survivor, worked till it broke her
She always landed right on her feet
Rejection, infection
Now in the wrong direction
I'll never walk a day in their shoes
From a child to a leper
Feels like I've been severed
Blame it on the world
Because I know it's true
I know it's true
Here we go again
Like turns, another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind
Here I go again
Like sphinx, another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind
You're not my kind
HAHAHA
You're not my kind
You're not my kind
You're not my kind
You're not my kind
Here we go again
Like turns, another corner
No way around it
I was born to fall behind
Here I go again
Like sphinx, another loner
No way around it
You will never be my kind
You're not my kind
You're not my kind
