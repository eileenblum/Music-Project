[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]One day the shadows will surround me
Someday the days will come to end
Sometime Iâll have to face the real me
Somehow Iâll have to learn to bend
And now I see clearly

All these times I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologizeâ¦

One day Iâll face the Hell inside me
Someday Iâll accept what I have done
Sometime Iâll leave the past behind me
For now I accept who Iâve become
And now I see clearly

All these times I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologizeâ¦

One day the shadows will surround me

All these times I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologizeâ¦
