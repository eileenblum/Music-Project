[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Tongue tied, dead inside
Nothing left, not even pride
This isn't how I thought the future would go
Hell-bent, soul spent
Nothing left but to repent
I've gotta dig myself back out of this hole
This isn't my fight
This is my war
(War, war, war)
I never wanted anything more
(This is my)
This is my war
(War, war, war)
Everything I love I'm fighting for
(This is my)
This is my war
Crazy eyed, certified
Nothing left but shit inside
Nobody said this would be easy to do
Crying out, crying out
Nothing left but pain and doubt
I would be lying if I said it's for you
This isn't my fight
This is my war
(war, war, war)
I never wanted anything more
(This is my)
This is my war
(war, war, war)
Everything I love I'm fighting for
(this is my)
This is my war
This is my war
This
This is my war
This is my war
(war, war, war)
I never wanted anything more
(this is my)
This is my war
(war, war, war)
Everything I love I'm fighting for
(this is my)
This is my
This is my war
