Feels like I'm running in place
A past I can't erase
I'm breaking, breaking apart
(I know they're after me)
It's like I'm fading each day
They took it all away
Left nothing, nothing but scars
(they make it hard to breathe)

Don't know where it went wrong
But my love for this is gone

I tried to numb the pain
But I can't get away
Hiding behind this disguise
The games I had to play
The hell I had to pay
Everything comes with a price

You're waiting for me to fail
That ship will never sail
Keep pulling and pushing me down
(but I just won't let go)
I know you wish I was dead
I'm stuck inside your head
I'm taking and breaking your crown
(I'm better left alone)

Don't know where it went wrong
But my love for this is gone

I tried to numb the pain
But I can't get away
Hiding behind this disguise
The games I had to play
The hell I had to pay
Everything comes with a price

I tried to numb the pain
But I can't get away
Hidi
ng behind this disguise
The games I had to play
the hell I had to pay
Everything come with a price
