Always try to see it your way
Never really knew whats right
Never really played in your games
(Saw it from the outside)
Never going to live it your way
I'd rather stand and fight
Never going to fall into place
See it from my side
Letting go of everything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of anything
Not until I meet my maker
Never really saw it my way
Never really knew what's right
Always gotta hide from the pain
(Saw it from the inside)
Never had to save it from face
Never had to run and hide
Tell me I've fallen from grace
See you on the dark side
Letting go of everything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of anything
Not until I meet my maker
Letting go of anything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of everything
Not until I met my maker
Saw it from the outside
See it all from my side
Saw it from the inside
See you on the dark side
Letting go of everything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of anything
Not until I meet my maker
Letting go of anything
Looks better down on paper
Letting go of everything
Not until I met my maker
Meet my maker
