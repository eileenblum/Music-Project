I'm the apocalypse
With a fat lip
I never did and I still don't give a shit
I'm such an outcast
You swore I'd never last
I got news for you
This ain't my last dance
This ain't my last dance
I've given it all (give it all)
I've given everything for you
I've given you all (give you all)
What more do you want me to do
I've taken the fall (taken the fall)
I've given everything to you
I've given my all (give my all)
Will it ever be enough for you
I am your nemesis
I don't regret this
I wrote the fucking book with no consensus
Born to live fast
You said I'd never last
Let me say it again
This ain't my last dance
This ain't my last dance
I've given it all (give it all)
I've given everything for you
I've given you all (give you all)
What more do you want me to do
I've taken the fall (taken the fall)
I've given everything to you
I've given my all (give my all)
Will it ever be enough for you
I won't say you're wrong
It comes together now
Falls together now
I won't say I'm right
But it falls together now
Comes together now
This ain't my last dance
I've given it all (give it all)
I've given everything for you
I've given you all (give you all)
What more do you want me to do
I've taken the fall (taken the fall)
I've given everything to you
I've given my all (give my all)
Will it ever be enough for you
This ain't my last dance
