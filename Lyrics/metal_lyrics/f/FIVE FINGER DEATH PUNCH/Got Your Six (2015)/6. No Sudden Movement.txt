Live your life
Like your a demigod
You force your weight
On everything and everyone
The bars you live
Behind are made of straw
How do you see the world
When you're dead and gone
I did not say what I want to say
No sudden movements
No sudden moves
I did not say whats inside of me
Right
Between your eyes
Nowhere to hide

Life
Ain't on your side
Your out of time
Click - clack reload
Click - clack unload
Your a wolf
Who eats amongst the herd
You built a bridge
So you can watch it burn
Kick and scream
Your voice is never heard
Write down your complaints
And I'll act like I'm concerned
I did not say what I want to say
No sudden movements
No sudden moves
I did not say whats inside of me
Right
Between your eyes
Nowhere to hide

No sudden moves
No sudden movements
No sudden moves
No sudden movements
No sudden moves

Between your eyes
Nowhere to hide

Ain't on your side
