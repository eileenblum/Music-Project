She was a princess, she could've been a queen
She had the angels beneath her broken wings
She had the vision, she had the sight
She wants perfection, she wants it right
Who cares anymore, what's right anymore?
(I question everything!)
I won't lie, I've never been ashamed
I don't mind, admitting I'm to blame
I care no more, I can't bare no more
I'll say no more, I can't give you anymore
(I question everything!)[2x]
He lives in darkness, there is no progress
He knows the demons, the lie within him
He has no vision, he has no sight
He hates perfection, it wasn't right!
Who cares anymore, who's there anymore?
(I question everything!)
I won't lie, I've never been ashamed
I don't mind, admitting I'm to blame
I care no more, I can't bare no more
I'll say no more, I can't give you anymore
(I question everything!)[5]
(I question everything!)
I won't lie, I've never been ashamed
(I question everything!)
I don't mind, admitting I'm to blame
(I question everything!)
I care no more, I can't bare no more
I'll say no more, I can't give you anymore
(I question everything!)[2x]
