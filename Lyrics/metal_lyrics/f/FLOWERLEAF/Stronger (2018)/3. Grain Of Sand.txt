When I see the sun shining down on me
Iâm exactly where I wanna be
Itâs like I feel heaven in the sky
All I wanna do is make you mine

No one can do it but me
Change the whole world
But I know I must be
Stronger than before
Itâs the way I must learn

And I will be with you till the end
Even though weâre just a grain of sand
I look at the stars so far above
Thereâs no mistake you are my love

No one can do it but me
Change the whole world
But I know I must be
Stronger than before
Itâs the way I must
.
Live all my life I've been waiting for this
Moment to get here
Now that itâs time I can feel it inside
Who I gotta be

No one can do it but me
Change the whole world
But I know I must be
Stronger than before
Itâs the way I must learn

No one can do it but me
Change the whole world
But I know I must be
Stronger than before
Itâs the way I must go
Ever alone for itâs my destiny

Even though we're just a grain of sand
