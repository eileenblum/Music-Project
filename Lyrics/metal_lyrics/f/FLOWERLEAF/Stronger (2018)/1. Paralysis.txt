As dawn arrives
And the light enters the room
Shadows draw me into a deep, deep sleep

For no reason at all
I feel that I could cry
At any time I could fall
Upside down from the sky

And so this way Iâm looking down
And so this way I see you there
And anywhere I look around
Save me from the ground

I am stuck inside this nightmare
My heart is pounding and my soul is bare
Have to fight this dream inside the dream
Chase the ghosts haunting in my sleep

For no reason at all
I feel that I could fly
At any time I could fall
So high up to the sky

And so this way Iâm looking down
And so this way I see you there
And anywhere I look around
Save me from the ground

I am stuck inside this nightmare
My heart is pounding and my soul is bare
Have to fight this dream inside the dream
Chase the ghosts haunting in my sleep

Between the line
Of real and fantasy
Shadows crawl
Somethingâs pushing me down
Light, scream
I must resist
Wake up, wake up, wake up

Save me from the ground

I am stuck inside this nightmare
My heart is pounding and my soul is bare
Have to fight this dream inside the dream
Chase the ghosts haunting in my sleep
