A girl in her dress
Full of pearls and distress
In her eyes the sadness
Of a life in loneliness

Behind your eyes I see the light
I can see it all

I see she's staring at me
Right in my soul
Her voice in my head
Tells me don't let me go

Beneath the fantasy
There's a spark in her heart
All the dreams of once before
Are alive deep inside

Come let me embrace you
Tell you it's alright
To be who you are
This is not all of it
You can make your own way
To the starsï»¿
