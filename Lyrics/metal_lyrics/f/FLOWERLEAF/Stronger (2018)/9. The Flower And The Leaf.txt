You hold me in your arms
I can feel in my heart
With you I see the stars
The glow is so bright pure light

And now when I close my eyes
Youâre taking me so high in the sky

Together we are one
Tell me youâll never leave
I am a part of you
Like a flower in spring

No one can hold us down
Nothing will do us part
Our love forever free
Like a leaf in the wind

The world is ours to take
Iâll go with you till the end
My struggle is when youâre far
From me, please stay here tonight

Through forest and desert wild
No nothing can compare to your smile

Together we are one
Tell me youâll never leave
I am a part of you
Like a flower in spring

No one can hold us down
Nothing will do us part
Our love forever free
Like a leaf in the wind
