You said that youâre so poor
So sad, so under comprehended
You said the world is boring
Thereâs nothing more to understand it

You feel misunderstood
Judged by the so small minded
But you donât see that youâre
The one to be afraid of

We will fall
But then weâll rise again
Stronger

You think that youâre so fair
Defending fiercely all your brothers
You speak like you care for
The well being of another

It hurts your pride and joy
To realize youâre not that vital
And so whatâs left for you
Self-compassion, anger

We will fall
But then weâll rise again
Stronger

Maybe youâll realize but itâs too late
And then I hope at least youâll feel ashamed
Until this time has come you can try
You can try to bring us down

We will fall
But then weâll rise again
Stronger
