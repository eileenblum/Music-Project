Did you know that you are not alone
In your path weâre watching over you
They can say whateverâs in their mind
Iâll obey only what I am inside

Let them try to set the rules of my life
Iâll face them with my head high

They wonât be able to quiet our voice
Thereâs no power to end our fight
Anymore, they can try
Come what may
Together we will stand

Donât you fear we all know what weâve been through
Itâs so clear they donât care about the truth
Being kind, we know where we must grow
Take my hand we will never let you go

The ones who are frustrated so they defy
Iâll let it out with a cry

They wonât be able to quiet our voice
Thereâs no power to end our fight
Anymore, they can try
Come what may
Together we will stand

I know what it feels like
But I am not on my own

They wonât be able to quiet our voice
Thereâs no power to end our fight
Anymore, they can try
Come what may
Together we will stand
