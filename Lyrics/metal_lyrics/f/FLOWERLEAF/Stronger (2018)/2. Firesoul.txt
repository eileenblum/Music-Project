In your head firesoul
Innocence fill the hole
Across the sea rhapsody
Donât you waste your time
Follow me

All the halos in the night sky
Petals of roses are falling to Earth
Watch the glaze of the crystal glow

See the moonlight hit your face Iâll go
Sail to the Silver Millennium
Spread your wings and take a leap of faith
With the wind I soar

Hold yourself thunder hell
Donât you dare to be somebody else
Time and place, loose the chains
Love and beauty they all fade away

All the halos in the night sky
Petals of roses are falling to Earth
Watch the glaze of the crystal glow

See the moonlight hit your face Iâll go
Sail to the Silver Millennium
Spread your wings and take a leap of faith
With the wind I soar
