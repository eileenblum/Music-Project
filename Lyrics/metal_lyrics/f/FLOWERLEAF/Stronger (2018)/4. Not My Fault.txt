Agony
Hold your tears
Mustnât scream
You cannot do it better

Second-string
Feel like nothing
Always below
You won't do it better

No way I will say
Shouldnât be this way
Pressure all the time Iâm torned apart
Leading me astray
I donât want to play
All those games youâre throwing at my life
Canât deny

Misery
How to fix this
How to work out
You have to do it better

On your knees
Can not resist
Can not get out
Youâll never do it better

No way I will say
Shouldnât be this way
Pressure all the time Iâm torned apart
Leading me astray
I donât want to play
All those games youâre throwing at my life
Canât deny

No, donât! Itâs not my fault
I didnât ask for this
Itâs not my issue to relieve

No, donât! Itâs not my fault
I didnât ask for this
And I will end this suffering

Now
And I will not allow
Them to make of me
Tell me who to be
I am so much more
Than your self-importance

No, donât! Itâs not my fault
I didnât ask for this
Itâs not my issue to relieve

No, donât! Itâs not my fault
I didnât ask for this
It is enough of suffering
