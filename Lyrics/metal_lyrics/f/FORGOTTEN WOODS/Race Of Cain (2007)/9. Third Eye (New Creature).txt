Yahweh scatters all.
Discard your senses.
And the abyss which sees all.
Whilst you master mediocrity with the eyes of GÃ¶ring.
Sieg Heil!
Lion appease the new masses.
Third eye watch the fall.
Amid to the faltering ego never letting you back in.
Sieg Heil!
Jehovah, inner peace.
Inner love.
Adonisian falsities in the mind of the ugly.
We conclude; there is no other.

Chase another rabbit down the hole.
Keeping my grave leveled, and boil, in communion with god.

The End.
