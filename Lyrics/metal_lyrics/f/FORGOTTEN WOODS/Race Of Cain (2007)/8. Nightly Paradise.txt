Far beyond your wildest imagination
we'll create a kingdom to ruin all entire nations.
Embraced by darkness we'll gather the purest of evil
to ruin the face of the earth and control our suffering world.
Inhale the smell of nightly glamour
inject this of dark and pleasure.
Swallow the wine of crimson taste and come awake
Dance in the rain of tears, climb the mountains of lies.
Swim in the oceans of sins, within this nightly paradise
Walk the fields of battle, sense their ghosts longing for life
Trap the suffer in silence within this nightly paradise.
