Indeed, we've seen the serpent rise, six-legged triumphant reptile.
Success!
Chakra!
I love you like no other.
Totalitarian regards.
The principle and the whip.
Silence the mutant mind.
Inside this dormant.

Cyst.
Outnumbered, writing in his presence.
Reinventing the myths.
Reversing the symbols.
It is inevitable.
