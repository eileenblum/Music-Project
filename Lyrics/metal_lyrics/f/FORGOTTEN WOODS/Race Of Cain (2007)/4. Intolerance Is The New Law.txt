I adhere to no god.
But I can taste the flames.
I despise your apathy and how easily you conform.I loathe every denial and every herd-adjusted step.
We can smile, knowing our minds need not worry.
Visual aggression leads the blind.
Abstract in matter, decayed.
Polluting in Effect.
I answer only to the master.
Discarding all unconscionable matter.

Bring the current on!
