The room opened widely before me....
So silent,so empty it seemed.
...Virgin white,Virgin light.

Swans emerged out from the velvet walls...
Dancing..Time stood still.
I caressed them with my eyes..
...Sinfull white,Sinfull light.

"How can you watch this happen
without tears in your eyes..?"
the velvet lake roared.

Drowning swans who screamed My name..My name.
"Let my world rape you" I yelled..
I turned and walked away.

...My ravens followed me.
