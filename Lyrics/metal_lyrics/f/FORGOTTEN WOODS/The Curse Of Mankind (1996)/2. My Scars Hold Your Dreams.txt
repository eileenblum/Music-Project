"Join me", I say beyond the forest and the holy lake.
...."Be mine", I yell under the silver stars beyond the crimson haze.

Crawl into my open wounds
And il show you all your dreams....
"Search, and you'll find diamonds in my rosegarden".

Oh,how neat you dance between the ancient trees
"...Dance beloved one" I laugh in your dreams.
Crawl into my open hand, and i'll clench it...

Far beneath your well of thoughts
you swim in my wounds....
I embrace you with my poisoned blood
and drag you to your bed of Thorns.

Eternally, you'll sleep in my rosegarden
Fear me, and i'll give you claws.
