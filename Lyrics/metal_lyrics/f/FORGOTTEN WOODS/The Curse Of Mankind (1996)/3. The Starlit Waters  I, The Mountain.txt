I... Will lead you to the stone
that is stronger than you...
The monument of my past,
I'll guide you through the walls of mist
and my sunless realms...
The woods Forgotten...
This one time,
In my world, you're mine!

The starlit sky above
the water mirrors... The water is my blood,
the stone is my human shell.
Those two things I found so worthless
for what is an existance among you mortals..?

As my light extinguished years back... When..?
I remember not.
I felt cleansed... Darkness with it's claws,
invincible yet strong, tore my dusty shell apart.
Death I fear not, I am Immortal!

I am the lakes, the mountains too.
The lakes where my blood calmly and
poisoned rests, and as a towering wall,
I am the mountains built by my very own,
Flesh and Skin...

[Lead]

The dust at my feet swept away by the wind
called...Devastaion.
The dust, I always hated...
...Why..?
You need not know.
YOU are the dust, while I, the mountain
do not even sway in the wind.
