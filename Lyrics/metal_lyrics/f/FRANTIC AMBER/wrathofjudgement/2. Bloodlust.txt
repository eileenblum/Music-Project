I feel a violent anger
I've no lines [?]
I can't feel, I can't breathe
I just want to rip out your throat

Hanging on to life by a thread
I can't hold on longer
Catch me and I fall

My inner strength fails me
I lie like this on the floor
People I love letting me down
Trying to save me from myself

My feelings are raping me!

The anger I breathe is toxic
I want to kill
The bloodlust in my eyes
My hands around your neck

I drag you down
Now you will feel my pain
Taking your last breath

In my frantic state of mind
I'm afraid
What have I become?
Who am I?
Where shall I turn?

Here is my sacrifice
Dance, you die

The anger I breathe is toxic
I want to kill
The bloodlust in my eyes
My hands around your neck

I drag you down
Now you will feel my pain
Taking your last breath

The anger I breathe is toxic
I want to kill
The bloodlust in my eyes
My hands around your neck

I drag you down
Now you will feel my pain
Taking your last breath
