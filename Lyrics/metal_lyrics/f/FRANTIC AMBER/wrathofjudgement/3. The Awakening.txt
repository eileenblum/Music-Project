I awake
As my confusion sets in
Takes me away
Save me from the dark

(Hate)
As I open my eyes
(Hate)
Reality hits me
(Hate)
The voices in my head
(Hate)
Take me over

Break the chains
And set me free
Only the memories
Remain

(Frantic)
I feel the need to run
(Frantic)
Too much to grasp
(Frantic)
The turmoil in my core
(Frantic)
Drives me crazy

Break the chains
And set me free
From the agony

There's something inside of me
Raging to get out
I try to hold back
But it has spoken
The beast inside of me
Screams
I have awakened
It's raging
No self-control
I surrender

Screaming I raise my bloody hands
From the kill in front of me
Why did we die? Where did we go?
How could this have happened to us?
Hate and anger

Break the chains
And set me free
Only the memories
Remain

There's something inside of me
Raging to get out
I try to hold back
But it has spoken
The beast inside of me
Screams
I have awakened
It's raging
No self-control
I surrender

The beast inside of me
Screams
The beast inside of me
Screams

I have awakened
