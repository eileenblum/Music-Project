You look at me with judging eyes
Seeing my dead friends
I am who I am, and proud to be that
You can say what you like

I serve no one, I do what I want
There are no rules here
I make my own way, so move...
I'm coming through!

I am wrath, denying you to punish me
With amazing bulls
I will not change, you cannot make me
I am in control!

With a mind of my own I will rise to the top
You can't stop me!
I'm just too low
To test for this [?]

Judge me, kill
I kill the feel with rage
Stand alone
I will rise!

Hear me, whore
Taste my wrath
Watch me rise above them all

Hear me whore
Don't push away
I came from nothing
Victory is mine!

The hammer has fallen
I've been judged
The words are spoken
You have judged

Judge me, kill
I kill the feel with rage
Stand alone
I will rise!

Hear me whore
Taste my wrath
Watch me rise above them all

Hear me whore
Watch me rise above them all

Hear me whore
Don't push away

Victory is mine!
