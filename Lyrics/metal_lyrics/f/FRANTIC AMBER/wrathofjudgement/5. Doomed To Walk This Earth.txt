Eternal War
Doomed to walk this Earth

Eternal War
Killing in its wake

Eternal War
Never request if you taint your soul [?]

Infecting places like a curse

Darkness gathers above
The shabash[?] is falling
Death coils like a snake
Slithering through the halls

On the battlefield
Soldiers that once had a wish
Now have nothing
Shattered and exposed
Wait to die

Ride!

Eternal War
Doomed to walk this Earth

Eternal War
Killing in its wake

Eternal War
Never request if you taint your soul [?]

Infecting places like a curse

Fields, they twist in blood
This are running for tainted [?]

You can't run, you can't hide, like cancer
The war must state that reasons, [?]
Seem to be religion, beliefs, terrorism
It always comes down to money and control

Eternal War
Doomed to walk this Earth

Eternal War
Killing in its wake

Eternal War
Never request if you taint your soul [?]

Infecting places like a curse
