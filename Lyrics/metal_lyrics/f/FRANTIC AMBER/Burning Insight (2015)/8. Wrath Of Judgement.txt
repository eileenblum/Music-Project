You look at me with judging eyes
Seeing my difference
I am who I am
And proud to be that
You can say what you like
I serve no one
I do what I want
There are no rules here
I make my own way
So move
I'm coming through

I am rough
Denying you to polish me
With your mainstream bullshit
I will not change
You cannot make me
I am in control
With a mind of my own
I will rise to the top
You can't stop me
I'm just too raw
So dance to this

Judge me
Kill
I kill the fear with rage
Stand
Alone
I will rise

Hear me roar
Taste my wrath
Watch me rise above
Them all
Hear me roar
Don't push away
I came from nothing
Victory is mine

Don't try to make me act like you
I'll never be what you want
I'm one of a kind
Not like the rest
I can't pretend
To be something I'm not
Just deal with the fact
That you're wasting your time
'Cause I won't listen
So shut the fuck up

Judge me
Kill
I kill the fear with rage
Stand
Alone
I will rise

Hear me roar
Taste my wrath
Watch me rise above
Them all
Hear me roar
Don't push away
I came from nothing
Victory is mine

The hammer has fallen
I've been judged
The words are spoken
You have judged

Judge me
Kill
I kill the fear with rage
Stand
Alone
I will rise

Hear me roar
Taste my wrath
Watch me rise above
Them all
Hear me roar
Don't push away
I came from nothing
Victory is mine

Hear me roar
Watch me rise above
Them all
Hear me roar
Don't push away
