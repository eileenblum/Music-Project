When lightning strikes, there is no embrace
The hit is precise, taking my place
It sucks the life right out of me
This isn't the way it was supposed to be 
Thought I was the chosen one
Guess again I was wrong

Meaningless belief, there is no breathing
It just cant be, while I'm alone here aching
Your head stuck between my thighs
I'll your your skull filled with lies
In no mood for pleasure
All I feel is the pain

This is it
My fear is growing
What will I lose?
Shall I laugh or cry?
Who am I?
Where am I going?
It's time to choose
Live or die

A life full of spite, depression and hurt
I suffer here, while you stand there and gloat
Must never have meant to be
I can't, but the knife's all bloody
I cheat to deceive my fear
The end is here

Everything's too much, I might just explode
Driving me towards death, lock and load
Soon gone you won't remember
Your memory will get denser
Ghosts laugh pathetic being
My life has no meaning

This is it
My fear is growing
What will I loose?
Shall I laugh or cry
Who am I?
Where am I going?
It's time to choose
Live or die

I think I am losing my mind
Sanity leaving me behind
There are no more words to say
Don't try to make me stay

I fail
Slowly rotting
Inside I bleed
Restless, can't focus
Wide awake, can't sleep
This pain I cannot take

This is it
My fear is growing
What will I loose?
Shall I laugh or cry
Who am I?
Where am I going?
It's time to choose
Live or die

This is it
My fear is growing
What will I loose?
Shall I laugh or cry
Who am I?
Where am I going?
It's time to choose
Live or die
