Trapped in a furnace of hate
I burn
Can't you see me?
In the unbreakable silence
Touch yourself

My innocence disappeared
My conscious is tainted
All this shit I've made it through
Makes me sick
It has taken it's toll
I have paid the price
You tried to blame me
Now feel my rage

All of your lies
Turn into my hate
But even if the truth hurts
I'm unbreakable

You let go of my hand
Seeing my fall
Pushing me into darkness
Throw me away
The love I've lost
The hate I've gained
It tears me up inside

Destroy it
Burn it
Hate it
Eat it
Fuck it
Break it
Feed it

Come on
Let the pain wash over me
Like a wave of Death
Suffocating on the words of love
Hear me choke
What doesn't kill me
Makes me stronger
I will fight the fight
'Cause I refuse to die

So bring it on
Let me feel the pain
Take a hit at me
I'm unbreakable

You let go of my hand
Seeing my fall
Pushing me into darkness
Throw me away
The love I've lost
The hate I've gained
It tears me up inside

Your greed is overrated
It's never enough
But I won't give up
I've come too far
You reign will now be ended
I know what to do
I refuse to fall apart
Just let me go

Tear me down
Force me to my knees
You can't touch me
I'm unbreakable

You let go of my hand
Seeing my fall
Pushing me into darkness
Throw me away
The love I've lost
The hate I've gained
It tears me up inside
