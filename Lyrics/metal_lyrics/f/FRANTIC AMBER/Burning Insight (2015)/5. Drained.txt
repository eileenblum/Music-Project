Let me die
My soul is yours to take
Let me die
She's my doom
Let me die
She will become my savior
Let me die
Destroy me

The beauty of the light
Behind the simple mind
Who is she?
Why am I drawn?
She walks through my dreams
Haunting my restless state
I want to follow
Run at full speed

Drained
Skin turns pure and white
Transforming my strength to fault
Eyes glowing red with a spark
A dangerous glare
I want to touch

My steps echo in the dungeon
Sinking into shadows
Blinded by her
I fall to my knees
Our eyes meet
I cringe at her stare
Eyes narrow, gaze sharp
A predator wanting me killed

She caresses my cheek
Grabs my hair pulling my head back
Exposing my flaws
Tasting a bite of my weakness

Let me die
My soul is yours to take
Let me die
She's my doom
Let me die
She will become my savior
Let me die
Destroy me

The silence of the night
Behind the searing blind
Who was she?
Why was I drawn?
The fills my head with screams
Laughing while sealing my fate
I became so hollow
Drained me with greed

Drained
Skin turns pure and white
Transforming my strength to fault
Eyes glowing red with a spark
A dangerous glare
I want to touch

I look in the face of Death
Feeling my heart beet
I see the light
To end my pain
I stumble away
Cringe at her stare
Imagine immortality
Don't you ever wonder?

Moving in I feel the end come near
Feeling the energy drain from me

Let me die
My soul is yours to take
Let me die
She's my doom
Let me die
She will become my savior
Let me die
Destroy me

Let me die
My soul is yours to take
Let me die
She's my doom
Let me die
She will become my savior
Let me die
Destroy me
