Repressing information
Disregarding freedom with corruption
Destruction's not faceless
They feel the pain ice cold and without mercy

Like a wave of vengeful wrath
Hands of justice will be served

Someday you will burn
In the fire of the flames that became her fate
Open your eyes
In disruption you destroyed her life

Ignorance is not bliss
It's time to change the fabric of the violence
Perspective must be gained
Get angry, fight back and stand up for what's right
Kill the delirious beliefs that drive your crimes
Crush the oblivious insight
Feel the deliverance and pay for what you've done
And choke until you die

Like a wave of vengeful wrath
Hand of justice will be served

Someday you will burn
In the fire of the flames that became her fate
Open your eyes
In disruption you destroyed her life

Someday you will burn
In the fire of the flames that became her fate
Open your eyes
In disruption you destroyed her life
In the fire of the flames that became her fate
Open your eyes
In disruption you destroyed her life
