Once upon a time I died
Just to feel something
Once upon a time I died
All there's left is the cruelty
of immortality

You take a look
I am not there
Roaming this earth like a ghost
Left for dead
On this path of self-destruction
Something sinister awakes

I block out the sun
Hate, anger suffocation
I, I have no name
Darkness, despair, desperation

Vengeance
Falling, down breaking the truth on my head
Vengeance
Falling, like the rain smelts away snow

I block out the sun
Hate, anger suffocation
I, I have no name
Darkness, despair, desperation

Cowering in madness
A shadow in silence
Whispers your name
Always haunting
Please leave me
Breathing
Alone
Not breathing
Anymore
Die, that is why
Die, that is why

The last time I
Rip out my eyes
Choke on the lies
Failure never deceives
Distraction stills my hand
Revulsion stirs my gut
I'm running out of time

I block out the sun
Hate, anger suffocation
I, I have no name
Darkness, despair, desperation

Vengeance
Falling, down breaking the truth on my head
Vengeance
Falling, like the rain smelts away snow

I block out the sun
Hate, anger suffocation
I, I have no name
Darkness, despair, desperation

Behind the hate
I disappeared
Behind the hate
I rot in my desire to destroy

Defeated
Defeated
Don't search white noise
Waking the wrath of wraiths
Invisible, there's no escape

I block out the sun
Hate, anger suffocation
I, I have no name
Darkness, despair, desperation
