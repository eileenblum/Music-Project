Don't take for granted
All that you have
It's more important
To believe in you
When it gets too hard to fight
Don't give up
Raise your hands to the sky
One last time

Soar
Spread your wings and fly
It's your time, it's your time, time to shine
So soar
Spread your wings and fly away
I'm coming home

It's when the world falls
That we fail to see
The potential in us
Passing us by
Looking into the light
You'll see your strength
We will all come out
On the other side
Stronger

Soar
Spread your wings and fly
It's your time, it's your time, time to shine
So soar
Spread your wings and fly away
I'm coming home

Soar
Spread your wings and fly
It's your time, it's your time, time to shine
So soar
Spread your wings and fly away
I'm coming home
