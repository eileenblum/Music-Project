I've been caught up in my project
Creating something unknown
Psychotropic substance
Provoking side effects to the extreme

Good by day, bad by night
Every shade I must fight
Anguish of splitting souls
As he emerges
Good by day, bad by night
Every shade I must fight
He's an enigma to me
That way he will always be

The promise of nightfall
The echoes of his laughter haunt me still
Lurking in the shadows of my mind
Waiting for the dark to come

Good by day, bad by night
Every shade I must fight
Anguish of splitting souls
As he emerges
Good by day, bad by night
Every shade I must fight
He's an enigma to me
That way he will always be

He comes to me in the hours of darkness
Cold hypnotic eyes set to kill

Good by day, bad by night
Every shade I must fight
Anguish of splitting souls
As he emerges
Good by day, bad by night
Every shade I must fight
He's an enigma to me
That way he will always be

Good by day, bad by night
Every shade I must fight
Anguish of splitting souls
As he emerges
Good by day, bad by night
Every shade I must fight
He's an enigma to me
That way he will always be
