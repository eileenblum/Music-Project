I will follow the wind blowing softly
Over the tallest trees, touching leaves,
Twisting playing with your hair passionately
Leaving all your wishes there in the past

I will follow the sun, its warm rays are
Falling on the icy ground letting bright days
Come to the epoch where old world stories
Are going quiet to memory

Arise, and follow me, set free from earthly leash,
Fly with the tameless wind, into serenity,
To the eternity, where dreams come true,
For me and you, where time is but an empty word

I will follow the rain, warm drops falling
Down on the frosty stones and reviving
Greenish silver mountain cover
Walking up the drowsing waterfall, and ice disappears

I will follow the moon howling wolves will
Tell me that I here belong place that's full of
wilderness, gives me hidden powers, feeling that my
Inner beast found his home

Arise, and follow me, set free from earthly leash,
Fly with the tameless wind, into serenity,
To the eternity, where dreams come true,
For me and you, where time is but an empty word
