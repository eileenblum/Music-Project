The memories burn
Bringing back the times gone by
The pages turn
And I recall forgotten friend of mine

I close my eyes
My nightmare lives again
Tearing apart
This sleepless night in hell
We both have seen
The death that wasn't not fair
We both have killed
The ones we should have spared

My friend, my foe
My mentor, my disciple
We both were born
Challenged to survival
In battle raised
Bound by one desire
Two souls, two friends
Will burn on the same pyre

I closed my eyes, 
My nightmare died with me
Cold at heart
I'm sleeping peacefully
We both have sinned
Before all kind of gods
But both have lived
Our best against all odds

My friend, my foe
My mentor, my disciple
We both were born
Challenged to survival
In battle raised
Bound by one desire
Two souls, two friends
Will burn on the same pyre

The memories burn
Bringing back the times gone by
The pages turn
And we forget, the life we left behind
