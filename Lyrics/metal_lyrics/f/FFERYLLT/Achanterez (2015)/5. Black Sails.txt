As sunrise arrives
The flames inside are raging
Drifting with the tides
Anticipate the landing

Born in the waves
And raised by briny waters
Our cradles and graves
Among the distant oceans

Njord! our father
Guide us through the waves
To the distant lands,
Where we will meet our fate
Lead us through the storms
Ye lord of sea and oceans
Help us find the shore
Let sea wolves feed their thirst

Children of the sea
In endless drift of time
Towards the lands unseen
We set our sails tonight

Winds blow from the east
Bringing scent of treasures
The long awaited feast
And taste of eastern pleasures

Njord! our father
Guide us through the waves
To the distant lands,
Where we will meet our fate
Lead us through the storms
Ye lord of sea and oceans
Help us find the shore
Let sea wolves feed their thirst

With first rays of sun
Our ships arrive at bay
The purpose here is one
The blood will flow today

Clash of shields and swords
Bodies fall like rain
The victory is close
All enemies are slain

Set sails wind blowing
Sea rage storm waves
Dark sky black clouds
Sun rise dawn breaks

Steel swords blood flowing
Ships burn smoke flames
Strike kill rain falling
Scream pain fear death

Boiling blood and choking thirst for battle
Close your eyes and feel once more
The moment which devoted to the metal
Where furiosity and thunder shaking world in war

Sacrifice your body to the water
Sacrifice your spirit to the gods
Honor, glory won't be immortal
But crashing rage, revenge and pain forever stay and last

Another war is won
The sea wolves sail away
Making our way home
Beneath the skies of grey

Children of the sea
In endless drift of time
Towards the lands unseen
Again we sail tonight

Another war is won
The sea wolves sail away
Making our way home
Beneath the skies of grey

Children of the sea
In endless drift of time
Towards the lands unseen
Again we sail tonight
