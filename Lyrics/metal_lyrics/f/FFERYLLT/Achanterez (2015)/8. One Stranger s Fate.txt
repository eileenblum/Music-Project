Sun is setting beyond the horizon
Rays are sliding down the sea
Far away on the distant shores
A lonely wanderer's journey begins

Dressed in moonlight, forest sleeps
Calm and silent my sanctuary
High above, guarding me
Three black crows among the trees

Lost my way, far from home
Wandering this lonesome road
Only shelter - Veil of the night
Let by darkness, betrayed by the light

Shimmering light of the fire till dawn,
Sitting in silence for long time alone,
Hearing the sounds of night,
Thinking of times that already have gone

Faithfully waiting in mind
Embracing his shoulders, his powerful arms,
Hiding the tears from myself
Caressing the hope he is coming safe

Come back, come to me!
Hear me! I'll reach for thee!
Raise your head to the sun,
See my face in the clear blue sky

Valleys are opening eternal view
This beauty is powerful, drawing and pure
Devoting yourself to the wandering life
And never regretting, forgetting the time

Hundreds seconds already have passed
I'm praying my ancient gods in the dark,
Looking forward to meeting the sweetheart
He's on earth the only beloved

Dawn's coming soon and my fears are fading,
Greeting the sunrise and farewell' moon
Hope revived and never dying
Will stay near candle in my quiet room

Come back, come to me!
Hear me! I'll reach for thee!
Raise your head to the sun,
See my face in the clear blue sky

Flaming heart, full of hope
And I know it's never too late
On the quest for regaining my love
This endless journey, one stranger's fate

Flaming heart, full of hope
And I know it's never too late
On the quest for regaining my love
This endless journey, one stranger's fate
