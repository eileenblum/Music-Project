Behold the skies crack open
Unholy vultures gather for the feast
Behold the troops approaching
A deadly army of immortal beasts

Embrace the fate
And call upon gods in despair
As one, together
The darkness will never prevail
Breathe deep and remember
Remember - there's no turning back
We stand together
Together as one till the end!

The stench of rotten bodies
A ruthless fight in graceful dance of steel
Avenged will be our brothers
We'll rise again when our wounds are healed

Embrace the fate
And call upon gods in despair
As one, together
The darkness will never prevail
Breathe deep and remember
Remember - there's no turning back
We stand together
Together as one till the end!

Shroud of the night leads us to fight
Approaching the hour of final sunrise
Gather the strength, remember the oath
To death for the glory
And future world's hope!

Embrace the fate
And call upon gods in despair
As one, together
The darkness will never prevail
Breathe deep and remember
Remember - there's no turning back
We stand together
Together as one till the end!
