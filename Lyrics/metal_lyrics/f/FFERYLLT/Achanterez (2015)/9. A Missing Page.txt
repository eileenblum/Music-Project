A distant cry, a melody long time forgotten
Night and day I dream about your guiding light
For many years this secret will remain untrodden
A missing page in history of humankind

Long lost and forgotten
Locked under the ocean
Atlantis, I'm seeking
The wisdom and knowledge
That caused thy demise

Dominon of power
The graveyard of secrets
Atlantis, I'm seeking
The ultimate weapon
That caused your demise

Abandoned world locked beneath the icy waters
Hiding mysteries and knowledge of the gods
Eternal frost the lore of never ending story
The key to answers to the question never asked before

Haunting, disturbing, the dreams of eternal life
Sickening agony pushing us to the fire
Possessed by life we seek immortality
Though endlessly rot in fading reality

Long lost and forgotten
Locked under the ocean
Atlantis, I'm seeking
The wisdom and knowledge
That caused thy demise

Dominon of power
The graveyard of secrets
Atlantis, I'm seeking
The ultimate weapon
That caused your demise
