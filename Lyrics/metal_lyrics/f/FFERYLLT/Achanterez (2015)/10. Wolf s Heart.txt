At night when the stars wake up,
How far can your dreams take you,
When you're howling up to the sky
And following lonely round moon

What are you looking for here?
Guard beholding endless landscape
How long have you been going?
Leaving the pines of woods and capes

Where is your secret hidden?
How can it be good and evil?
Never known is your severe
Mysterious and playful heart!

Your traces are covered by night,
Your figure will slip by in the fog,
Roaming silently in the moonlght,
Which path you will choose or which road

What are you looking for here?
Guard beholding endless landscape
How long have you been going?
Leaving the pines of woods and capes

Where is your secret hidden?
How can it be good and evil?
Never known is your severe
Mysterious and playful heart!

Running wild you're catching gusts
Of icy wind chasing stars,
Following visions, noises of night
You're spirit of freedom in wildness of life
