Illusion of peace is dissolving,
Veil unfolds the runes foreshow the war
Salvation, the bloodshed oncoming,
Holy war we must survive the storm

Remember words of our fathers
And heed the wisdom of gods above
Return the christian locust
Back to oblivion below

The northern folk shows no mercy
For those who spit on our gods
And on the land that is sacred
We slay the christian scum

Delusion of hope leaves the hearts
Of our foes down on their knees they fall
Frustration, no way to turn back,
One last breath they won't survive the storm

Blood red snow beneath crippled bodies
Slowly melts into the crimson lake
Torn apart, defeated bastards flee
Clear blue sky we have survived the storm

Inspired by our elders
Heeded the wisdom of gods above
Sent back the christian locust
Into oblivion below

The northern folk shows no mercy
For those who spit on our gods
And on the land that is sacred
We've slain the christian blood
