[Music: G. Tsedov, lyrics: A. Davtyan]

Burning sky
And raging flames that blind
Rain of blood
And symphonies of battle intertwine

We bathe in blood
In name of ancient gods, arise
Day has come
Fulfill the oath and leave all fears behind

Rain of blood
And symphonies of battle intertwine
Day has come
Fulfill the oath and leave all fears behind

[Chorus:]
Through misty plains
To golden halls of fallen braves
Fear not the pain
Your strongest weapon is your faith

Fear not the death
Ye sons of mighty Odin
Your fate awaits
The Asgardâs horn is callingâ¦

Side by side
Weâll meet our fate tonight
Witness the sign
The graceful valkyries descend from the sky

Our will is strong
And hearts are filled with hope
Ragnarok
Will reap the seeds that gods of war have sown

[Chorus:]
Through misty plains
To golden halls of fallen braves
Fear not the pain
Your strongest weapon is your faith

Fear not the death
Ye sons of mighty Odin
Your fate awaits
The Asgardâs horn is calling

Screams and clash of swords
Blood flows as flesh and steel are one
War cry sounds again
Die by the symphony of ice and flames

[Chorus:]
Through misty plains
To golden halls of fallen braves
Fear not the pain
Your strongest weapon is your faith

Fear not the death
Ye sons of mighty Odin
Your fate awaits
The Asgardâs horn is calling

Battle rages on
Still we together stand as one
And though our fate is sealed
No one will leave this battlefield

[Chorus:]
Through misty plains
To golden halls of fallen braves
Fear not the pain
Your strongest weapon is your faith

Fear not the death
Ye sons of mighty Odin
Your fate awaits
The Asgardâs horn is calling



[Music: D. Eliseev, Lyrics: M. Chikviladze]
