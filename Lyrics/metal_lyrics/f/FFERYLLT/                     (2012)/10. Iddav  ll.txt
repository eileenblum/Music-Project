[Music: D. Eliseev, Lyrics: E. Permyakova]

Children of Heimdal will not fight for gold,
New era's coming, bringing harmony soon.
Meadows and valleys will cover the ground,
Midgard will see a new sun and new moon.

Strong winds are taking the smoke far away
Strong waves are hitting the rocks, on their way.
Seeds of a new life are growing again,
Warm rays of sunshine absorbed by the Earth.

Daring deeds are committed again,
By Aces - children of gods,
Never forgotten, forever in hearts
Previous couragous feats of Asgard
