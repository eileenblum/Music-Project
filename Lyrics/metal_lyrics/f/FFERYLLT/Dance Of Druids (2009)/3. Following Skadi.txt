The northern nightâs shining by fires of enemyâs ships 
Is awakening my mind from the tranceâ¦
Itâs time to remember all blood and all sorrows
And swords of my brotherâs in wildest danceâ¦ 

When beauty dawn closer Iâll raising my hands
To Asgard through grey northern cloudsâ¦
My beautiful Goddess, Iâm following you
Towards wars and battles and storming seaâs soundsâ¦

In enemyâs eyes I have red a great hatred,
The revenge was flashed on the edge of my swordâ¦
And Scadhi will wait till Iâm ready to follow â
Together weâll save our beautiful world. 

The cold wind of freedom will break off all chains,
And push in the embrace of warâ¦
And forcing my heart to remember all names
The Valhall will open the doorâ¦

The Child of the Will is your name I knowâ¦
All wishes and dreams in your hands.
Like you I will stand on the native landâs snow 
Protecting my dear Fatherland.

There were many battles that we had seen,
And our foes are deadâ¦
Now going to Valhall Iâm following you 
Highly raising to stars my headâ¦
