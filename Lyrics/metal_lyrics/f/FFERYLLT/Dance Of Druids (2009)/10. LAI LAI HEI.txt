[Ensiferum cover]

HÃ¤n katsoi maan reunalta tÃ¤hteÃ¤ putoavaa
Nyt kanuiit kasvot neitosen peittÃ¤Ã¤ karu maa
Jokaisen tÃ¤ytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
sillÃ¤ aika ompi voittoisa, mutÂ´ tÃ¤mÃ¤ maa on ikuinen

There's a place in the North, far far away
Home of the wandering man
Dreaming fells with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
that we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song

Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The ravenÂ´s magic enthralls the woods
Crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
full of wisdom, secrets and tales
The morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead

LAI LAI HEI!

He watched a falling star, at the edge of the world
Now the maidenÂ´s beautiful face is covered in barren earth
Everyone has to look into the eyes of the truth,
for time is victorious, but this land will always stay true
