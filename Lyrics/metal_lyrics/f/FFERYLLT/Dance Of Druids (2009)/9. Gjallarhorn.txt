[Part 1]

There was no life in Midgard
For many times agoâ¦
Our Gods gave it to us
And soon our time will goâ¦
From Fenrirâs genus on land
Our home and souls we must defend.
Nothing will mean for us that silence â
Calling you can hear between the windsâ¦
Odinâs sight from the sky
Invokes your heart to fightâ¦

[Part 2]

Keeping the sword near the heart,
Weâre waiting for the sign.
Out of the danger our lives
Directing by the Godsâ¦
The Runes on our steel are glowing,
Our souls will never be bowingâ¦
Mjellnir is dissecting the sky â letâs die
Only after win of this war, we need no more.
Follow Heimdallâs disturbing sound â
Gjallarhorn is sounding around.

[Chorus:]
An arrow of the lightning
Begins to kill our fearâ¦
This sign is Thorrâs reminding
That he is always near.
Weâll draw the Runes on our hearts,
Weâll glorify our Godsâ¦
The last beam under Asgard
Is fading in the nightâ¦
The Twilight of the Gods
Is spilling among the cloudsâ¦
Weâll draw the Runes on our hearts,
Weâll glorify our Godsâ¦

[Part 3]

The scramble will take our souls,
Begin to whirl in dance,
Bloody dance of last fight
We must to use last chance.
From Fenrirâs genus on land
Our home and souls we must defend.

[Chorus]

[Part 4]

Mjellnir is dissecting the sky â letâs die
Only after win of this war, we need no more.
Follow Heimdallâs disturbing sound â
Gjallarhorn is sounding around.
Odinâs sight from the sky
Invokes your heart to dieâ¦
