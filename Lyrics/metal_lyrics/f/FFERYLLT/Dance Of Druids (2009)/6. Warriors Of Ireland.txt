[Part 1]

For last time I see you, my fatherland proud
The voice of the horn calling you is too loud
Our foe is so close, as we hear his war cry
We go to the midnight to fight and to die.

[Chorus:]
Thunder in the sky is calling us to die,
To die for your freedom, your truth and your pride.
All hand-by-hand forever we'll stand
Enemy shall run from our land!

[Part 2]

Reminding my fathers, before me they're gone,
Ages and spell turned them into stone,
I hear cry of Erin, who loved me so well,
I hear shore of waters and ring of the bell.

[Chorus]

Your heroes await thee, we see them arise,
Their power and might come to us from the skies,
The Morrigan's shelter will cover our heads,
And Erin will wait âtill we rise from the dead.
