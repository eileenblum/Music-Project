Old stones by the sun will be lighted,
Summerâs longest day will begin.
Weâll make a sacrifice to remind 
The Gods and Goddesses for our win.

The cheerful clang of the sickle is around â
Anticipating the pleasure of Gods.
Weâre making better our beautiful ground,
Our native land spilling enemyâs blood 

Hands to sun we have raisedâ¦
Fire of hearts and mood of Midsummer is reflecting in our eyes... 

Druids gather in glade of the forest,
Silently talking near stone altar
The scoured echo of the oldest stories
Is flying through branches to the Northern stars.

âWeâre thereâ¦ Weâre staying on our Great land
With bowls full of a glimmer bloodâ¦
For you, the Gods, our open hearts and
For sun, its arrows through the cloudsâ¦

Between the elements our freedom
Itâs time to glorify the cropâ¦
Letâs fade everything we neednât
And ask the win in future war!â

When spirits of the forest are dancing near the fire
The twilight will come to us from horizonâs line.
The silence has enveloped the loudest someoneâs cryingâ¦
And summerâs songs of birds and wind will recall in our mind.

âThe Gods! Take the gifts from our land
And give the goodwill for our tribe.
Weâve sent in battle not one thousand 
Their names by ice wind have been scribedâ¦

No more our land will be anotherâsâ¦
Our wish is enemyâs fast death.
The Queen of Hel will waiting for them
When they are gone by icy breathâ¦â

The northern night is closer; the longest day is endingâ¦
Old stones are raying the heat like from entrails of Earth.
And in the middle of the world named Midgard weâre standing
While in the bowl is impious blood of a christian girl.
