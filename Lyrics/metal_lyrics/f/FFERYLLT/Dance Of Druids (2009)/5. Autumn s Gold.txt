[Part 1]

The autumn rain on a frozen valley;
The birdâs wedge is calling our souls fallow themâ¦
Dejected trees will be colored in yellow
As soon as the sun will whispering your nameâ¦

[Chorus:]
Oh, Gods, I am waiting your anger,
Sitting near water where my sword will sink.
My land has been locked by a stranger,
Has been covered by nightâs black wings.

[Part 2]

Remember a time when the trickle of water
Was streaming to hands like a diamondâs drops,
When silky grass was caressing our bodies
And our hearts were full by eternal hope.

[Part 3]

The fields are empty, the woods are burnt -
Our kings have been blinded by shining of gold.
The autumn treasure as rich as yours,
Its fading is my trouble untoldâ¦

[Part 4]

The Earth in gold is a dream of tomorrow
In stuffy metal itâs restless soul.
We canât be ruthless, we can not borrow
Its shabby heart hearing Motherâs call
