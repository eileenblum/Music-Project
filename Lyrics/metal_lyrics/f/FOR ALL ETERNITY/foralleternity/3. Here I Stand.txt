Reveal yourself.

you try to hide your face,
But your disguise is withering.

I do not know why, you run away from me
Your eyes are full of lies, you cannot lie to me.
This you canât deny, you are afraid of me.
You canât deny.

With all of your might, prove you can win the fight
With all of your might, prove you can win the fight.

This you canât deny, you are afraid of me.
You canât deny.

The light I bear shines through your imitation.
The light I bear shines through your imitation.
Now, you know where I stand, I stand at the right hand.
So, if god is with me, who is against me?

So here i stand, before my enemy.
Against countless odds, his grace consumes me.
His grace consumes me.

So here I stand.
With these scars upon my back.

So here I stand.
With these scars upon my back.

With all your might, prove you can win the fight.
With all your might, prove we can win the fight.

Donât try to prove me wrong.
You try to hide your face, but your disguise is withering.
The light I bear shines through your imitation.

Donât try to take away, my eternity.

I do not know why, you run away from me.
This you canât deny, you are afraid of me.
I do not know why, you run away from me.
This you canât deny, you are afraid of me.

Reveal yourself.
