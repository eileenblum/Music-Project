I will proclaim my faith tonight
i'll hold tight to your name,
deep down inside i know your mine,
one day they will fall into line.

Sure as the sun will fall, 
I know that we will rise,
We are not bound with time, we are not bound with time.

Sure as the sun will fall,
I know that we will rise,
We are not bound with time, we are not bound with time.

Why canât you just see, death's no hold on me,
why canât you just see, we are forever.

Why canât you just see, death's no hold on me,
Why canât you just see, we are forever.

Forget the preset notion of your end.
His plans for you, are Everlasting.

Everlasting

The sun will fall, and we will rise.
We are not bound with time.

The sun will fall, and we will rise.
We are not bound with time.
The sun will fall.
The Sun will fall.
Fall.
