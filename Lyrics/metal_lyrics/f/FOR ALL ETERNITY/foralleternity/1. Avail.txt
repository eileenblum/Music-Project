Time has come,
All else fades away,
Walls close in, till this day
Today's the day, that we are free.

And if we fall, we will stand up.

Hot or cold, tyrant sold,
Today, you meet your maker,
Hand in hand, with the angels
Oh, led down the path,
To find all youâve ever had.

And he whispers in my ear, all this time.
To stay away.

Take everything,
Everything.

And if you take me down that path,
To find all Iâve ever had,
Prove that I am yours.

And if you take me down that path,
To find all Iâve ever had,
Prove that I am yours.

I am yours.
