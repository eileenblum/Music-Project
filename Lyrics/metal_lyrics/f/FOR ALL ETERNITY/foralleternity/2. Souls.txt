Your soul is priceless,
No sacrifice you can make, so take hold.
Priceless, the fear you must forsake, so let go.

Priceless, priceless.

So was his blood,
So was his blood.

Flesh can break, Iâm full of lies and deceit.
Take everything, for I am weak.
Ground to take,
Draw your sword,
Take everything my god till there is nothing left.

Ill give it all up, just to be at your side.

More of you, less of me.
More of you, less of me.

Father, Father, slay my beast
Father, Father, slay my beast

Father, father take my hand, here i am, in awe i stand
and show me your everlasting love

I cannot describe this, i cannot describe this, i cannot describe this.

I cannot describe this.
the stones they throw will build us
as long as it doesnât kill us
the suffering makes us stronger, until we meet our father

take my hand
save me
oh lord, save me.

Save me.
