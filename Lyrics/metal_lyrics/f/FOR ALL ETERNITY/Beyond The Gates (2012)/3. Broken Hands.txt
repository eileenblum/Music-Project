Purpose, isn't found in my broken hands or my selfishness.
Everything they have told me has broken my spirit,
and it has left me, without a plan or a purpose for this life that i am meant to lead.
Iâm a broken man, I find no purpose in these hands, I canât build anything for myself.
They have left me, with no guideline or outline of what or who I am meant to be.
Everythings unclear(everything that I see here), so tell me what, what do you expect from me?
Im just a broken man, gripping to life with a broken hand.
I wish, I had the strength to live a life, a life free of regret.
All these thoughts running through my head, in my own strength, I think i'd just wind up dead.
Lend me a helping hand, someone teach me to be a better man.
Itâs like i've heard it all before.Give me a reason to breath or I wonât breath at all.
Living through all this pain, living amongst this hate, I cant bear another day.
What could I do, what could I say, that could make this pain go away,
What could I do, what could I say,I cant bear another day, and itâs eating me away.
I am alone and cold, hopeless and broken and wretched with no place to go.
I am alone and cold, in desperate need of a purpose and a chance of hope.
I wish, I had the strength to live a life, a life, full of hope.
To live a life, free of regret.
Give me the strength.
