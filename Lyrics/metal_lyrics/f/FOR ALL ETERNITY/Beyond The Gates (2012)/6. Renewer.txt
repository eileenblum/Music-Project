Iâm crying out for, someone to take, to take this away from me.
My pain, it still remains.
Despite all the things I have seen,and all i've come to be.
I still struggle, my life is on the line.
So now I walk in this shadow, a few steps from the light.
I am so close to the decision that will change my life.
On the edge, I see my future out in front of me.
The only thing in my way is all I used to be.
Stand down, step aside, my wicked mind and my pride.
Iâm done with you.
Take, take it all upon yourself.
To the man I was, to the man ive been, you are dead to me,
and I am dead to you.
So now I walk in freedom, and I see where iâve been. 
This heart, in my chest has been washed clean.
Now I am new,
My Renewer, my Healer, my Saviour, my God.
