Truth is calling out, He is crying out your name,
What would it take for you to know,
What would it take for us to see.
Truth has paved the way, there is life to be attained, there is no reason to doubt you.
Show us Your ways, reveal to us, all that awaits.
All that awaits.
What would it take for us to lose grip of this mindless state, return to knowledge that was intended for us.
No longer, will we live in absence, no longer, no longer will we deny You.
We have not a single reason to doubt You.
By your grace, we see all that was kept from us.
I am a completely new man, with my eyes set on your plan.
What would it take, to explain what iâm feeling, understanding all that awaits me.
I have found something, that has changed every part of me.
The truth is our for the taking. The truth is ours for the taking,
As You have graciously shown.
What would it take for you to know(for you to know).
What would it take for you to see(for you to see).
We strive in life, to a place of nearness to our God.
All that awaits us, is at the foot of His throne.
All that I ask, all that I ask, is for you to, walk through the gates, walk through His gates.
Walk with us, walk with us.
I would give it all, to see this through. I would give it all, to see this through.
All I ask, all that I ask, all that iâm asking is for you to walk through the gates,
walk with us, walk through His gates.
Walk with us, walk through the gates.
