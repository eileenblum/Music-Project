I will bare myself to the world.
In my truest of forms, I will stand firm in the things you have called me to.
The blood runs thick in these veins.
Blood that is not my own, not my own.
The very core, of who I am has shifted drastically.
My intentions have changed my outlook on everything.
Now I go by a different name, with a different face to the one that preceded me.
I am a whole new creation, all of me is devoted to You.
All that I was called to has come to pass.
Ive been given strength that I have never known before.
I will never back down again, never again.
All that I was called to has come to pass.
Your work in me, has changed everything.
I turned away from who I was, to realise who I truly am.
All that You've made me to be.
In my truest form, You have given me the strength.
You have given me a strength I have never known before.
I will bare myself to the world.
In my truest form, I will stand firm in all that You've called me to, in my truest form.
All the world will see what You have made of me.
Everyone will know that you are King.
