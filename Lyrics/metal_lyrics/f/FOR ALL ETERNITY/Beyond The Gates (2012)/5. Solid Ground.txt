Help to keep me, firmly on the ground, I need to feel the gravity.
I need solid ground under my feet, because I am drifting away.
I am drifting away, and it wasn't my intention to be this way, forever slipping away.
All they say they claim to be true.
Pull me closer to you.
Pull me closer to you, free me from the grips of those who aim to stop you.
The enemy paints these skies with lies to keep me off this floor.
Their persuasive ways have tricked me before.
They haven't stopped for years, they are pulling me away in desperation.
For fear of what i've found in you.
Be my gravity.
Help to keep me, firmly on the ground, I need to feel your gravity.
I need solid ground under my feet, because I am drifting away.
I know You planned it out, You knew that it would end this way.
I'm not easily swayed.
Ill stand here, immovable, firm in my footing, firm in my faith.
Away from the lies that they say, All that they said, all that they said.
Now its all clear to me.
Now its all so clear to me.
Standing right here.
