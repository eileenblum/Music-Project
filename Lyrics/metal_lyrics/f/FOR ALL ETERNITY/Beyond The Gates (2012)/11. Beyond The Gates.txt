I open my eyes to the skies to see You standing there right in front of me,
wearing a light far too bright for my eyes to perceive.
You open the gates, take my hand and You guide me in.
Into your presence Lord and the the love that You hold within.
You were before and You are right now, You forever will be here with me.
Forget the world, all it has You surpass for You outshine it all.
Leaving behind my selfish mind still You never let me fall.
Absence of time now is mine spent forever by your side in your arms at your feet.
I will worship You my King, we are no more obsolete.
You were before and You are right now, You forever will be here with me.
You were before and You are right now, You forever will be here with me.
In Your presence I will sing songs that praise Your name,
I will singloudly with no shame of how You conquered the grave.
In Your presence is where I belong, grant my heart just this one song to sing You forever and ever.
Hallelujah You are my King, hallelujah to You I will sing.
Though I know not very much, I've known You not very long.
The little I can give I will give You through this song.
You were before and You are right now, You forever will be here with me.
You forever will be here with me.
