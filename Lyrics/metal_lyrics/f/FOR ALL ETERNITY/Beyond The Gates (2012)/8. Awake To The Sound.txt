This darkness, left me with nothing
I could not see, and I was captivated, in disbelief (in disbelief)
But now, my eyes are open. I have new sight and you are the light that I'm chasing
If only you were standing right in front of me

I hate this separation, this is not where I'm meant to be
We must be together, there's nothing else that this world can offer me
But I wont give up, and I wont give in.
Can you hear the sound [3x]

There's no sweeter sound than the footsteps of the Almighty
Coming to find me, coming to bring me home

Come find us, here we are.
Sitting and hoping and seeking your love to overflow
Because I owe everything that I am to you,
And everything I have belongs to your kingdom
I must bare the truth [2x]
Can you hear the sound?

There's no sweeter sound than the footsteps of the Almighty
Coming to find me, coming to bring me home
There's no sweeter sound [4x]

I can hear the footsteps,
I can hear him coming
I can hear the footsteps
I can hear him coming

To take us home.

There's no sweeter sound [3x]

I can hear the footsteps [2x]

Of the Almighty.
