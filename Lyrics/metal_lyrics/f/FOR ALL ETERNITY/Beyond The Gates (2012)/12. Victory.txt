After all these years, after all ive come to know, after eveything iâve seen,
I am proud, I am proud of who You have made me to be,
and I know I can stand here,with fire in my eyes &amp; my brothers at my side.
Nothing can defeat me.
I see through all the lies.
For in the name of Christ we declare our victory.
This truth I hold has destroyed my enemy.
Victory.
Jesus has come &amp; paid the price for every single life.
On the cross, blood bought victory, we stand redeemed, we stand redeemed.
Victory.
By His blood we stand redeemed.
