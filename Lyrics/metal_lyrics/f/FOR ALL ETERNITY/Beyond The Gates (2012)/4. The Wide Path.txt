You've been swept away, the little hope that we have is wasting away.
Swallowed up by the grips of the tide, submerged in treachery, fathoms from a single breath.
Your life expectancy is only measured in seconds.
The little hope we have, is wasting away.
The little hope we have, is wasting away, day after day.
I see past all the haze, all they have made you out to be.
So follow me to the surface, take a chance, take a breath, and follow me.
Would you rather be, the nameless, the faceless, the lifeless, a man with no eyes to see.
Would you dare stray from the wide path to see what you could become.
Would you dare.
Seek out truth, with your whole heart &amp; it will find you.
Seek out truth, with your whole heart &amp; it will find you.
There is no mistake to be made, He will find you, there is no mistake to be made.
Make your way to the surface, He will meet you there, He will find you.
Would you dare to become all that you were made to be.
Would you dare stray from the wide path to see.
I see past all the haze, all they have made you out to be.
Take a chance, take a breath, and follow me.
Would you rather be, the nameless, the faceless, the lifeless, a man with no eyes to see.
Would you dare stray from the wide path to see what you could become.
