[feat. Mattie Montgomery]How can you lie through your teeth,
And force your ways on all you meet?
I will resist you, and I will stand against your schemes.
I fought, and lost a battle against you before.
But I return twice as strong, with the armor and shield I sought for so long.

I will watch you fall.
Back in the hole from which you came from.
If you try to face me, I will strike you down with the force of an army.
All your hope is lost when you fight for your own cause.
Free of resolve.
I'll have no part of your ways and your wicked heart.

I'll stand between you and all those that I love, with protection from above.

I will stand against you dark and dead
I will fight until by dying breath.
I have no intention of ever letting you crush my defenses.

[Mattie]
With each stride, I'm marching towards the front lines.
Face to face with your kind.
Opposing the ideals of the life I choose to lead.
You're making threats to me.
I'll destroy everything you build up to cut me down.

I will stand against you dark and dead, I will fight until by dying breath.
I have no intention of ever letting you crush my defenses.

My strength and approach is determined by how close I hold You.
When You draw near, I depart from the fear.
When I love as You love, my enemy is left with no ground to stand on.
When You gave Your life for us, a life I'll bear before me.

When I love as You love, the enemy trembles at my feet.
When I love as You love, my spirit is breaking free.
When I love as You love, my life is made complete.
You gave Your life for us so that we can live in peace.
