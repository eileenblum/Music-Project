I remember the words You said to me
They still ring true as if You said them yesterday
Giving up is never an option
You may find it hard but they have forgotten
The love they have left is never far from them

Though this world has turned cold
I'll let the warmth embrace me
And lead me on my way home
Through these streets I roam, thinking all along

Awaken the heart
We have numbed ourselves to the concept of love
We have forgotten how to truly embrace how to face each day
I have given all of myself to bridge the gap between heaven &amp; hell
All coming in none going out stolen from the grips of the reaper himself
I foresee pointing fingers and accusations aimed at me
Our methods may not be of ease
But we're spreading His love with our arms outreached

Though this world has turned cold
I'll let the warmth embrace me and lead me on my way home
Through these streets I roam, thinking all along
How can they not know?
How can they not know?

There's a void in us all, waiting to be made full.
We have numbed ourselves to the concept of love
We have forgotten what it means to say, âI'm alive and well todayâ

I know I will never be alone
His loving reach stretches past the farthest place that I can go

I will never be alone
Assured to me by the love He has shown
I will never be the same
My home is found in His embrace

Our goal is reached by showing love and compassion to those we meet
An entire world at peace
Covered by grace and completely set free
Our home is found in His eternal embrace
