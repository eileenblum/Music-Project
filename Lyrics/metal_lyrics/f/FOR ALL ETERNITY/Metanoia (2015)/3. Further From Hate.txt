You've lifted the greatest burden off my life.
Waking up, in company of all I love.

This grace is what I know; it shields me from the cold.
Each one of us has made the other whole.
The sun rests on my shoulder, it guides me on and on.
I once resided on the other side of life and love.
Now peace has hold of me and I see clearer than ever before.
Hopeful for what my life has in store.

My spirit, soul and mind have come alive.
Alive.
Alive inside.
Love, has its grip on me.

Two become one in His full sight.
My insecurity and vulnerability, wiped away.

Each day I face, I am further from hate, compassion is at the forefront of my faith.
Waking up in company of all I love.

This grace is what I know; it shields me from the cold.
Each one of us has made the other whole.
Because of You, in this life, I am further from hate.
Overrun by grace.
Further from hate.
Overrun by grace, further fromâ¦

I am ways away.
I am further from hate.
