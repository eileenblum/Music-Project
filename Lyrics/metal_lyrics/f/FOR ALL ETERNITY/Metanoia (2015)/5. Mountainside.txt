The same searchlights coming to find me, coming to save my life, are the same ones blinding my eyes, leaving me to die.
Forever lost on this mountainside.

The same searchlights coming to find me, coming to save my life, are the same ones blinding my eyes, leaving me to die.

Will I ever get off this mountainside?
