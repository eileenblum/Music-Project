What I know is that a life without love is no life at all.
Hope is the key to answering the call.
It's written on your heart.

You find that all your hopes and dreams
Are dead and gone.

You think each person of value
Has left you alone.

You should know
There is no one in this world even worth counting on

Besides, there's a fire burning in your eyes
That you cannot disguise

Even if you tried
Even if you tried

There's a purpose for your life you cannot hide

It's written on your heart in the clearest of white.

Burning bright.

You should know, hope found its way, found its way to me
You too can be changed forever.
It's written on your heart.
You should know, hope found its way, found its way to me
You too can be changed forever.

Will you remain as you are?

I've felt your pain,
I know your pain,
I've felt your pain.
We all make the same mistakes.
We all wear the scars we've won.
I too lived with the same uncertainty.
But hope found me.
Now you know me.
Hope found a home in me.
Now you know me.
Hope found its home.

You should know, hope found its way, found its way to me
You too can be changed forever.
It's written on your heart.
You should know, hope found its way, found its way to me
You too can be changed forever.

Return to the start
With love in your heart
You too can be changed forever.
Return to the start
With love in your heart.
