Fallen through hell and back again,
Recollect with full vision.
No rest each night
I am haunted by demons out of sight
Assuring me that there is no way out.

All I have is measured by incapability.
No way out for me if I live free of a remedy.

How is this so hard to shake?
I'm so willing to change.
What can I make of this life if I'm unable to break free.

My outcry for life is swallowed by the night sky.
My outcry for life is swallowed by the night sky.

I'm being hopeful for once
The sunrise I seek is moments from my eyes.
Gazing upon the sky
Longing for the departure of night.

I'm being dragged away
Into endless night
Without putting up a fight.
I owe it to myself to fight the oppression,
Enduring till morning, to stop it from starting.
Will I wallow in my self-defeat and paralyzing deceit?
Will I ever find peace of mind or more demons to come and destroy my life?

Facing my greatest fear,
A fear of dying here.
Dying with no air in my lungs to spare.

Will I live to see the end?
Will I see the sun rise?

I'm being hopeful for once
The sunrise I seek is moments from my eyes
Gazing upon the sky
Longing for the departure of night.

Forever
Looking towards the skyline.
Towards the skyline
Forever
Awaiting the sun to rise.

Waiting for the break of dawn.
