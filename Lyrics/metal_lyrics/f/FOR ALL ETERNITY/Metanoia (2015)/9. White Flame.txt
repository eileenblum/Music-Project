I have overcome
Every wall, every inch of myself
With no hold on the ways of this world
I have conquered my inmost defeat
Now death lays dying before my own two feet
Our path was always meant to meet

Maybe not now but soon you'll see.

This white-hot flame inside of me
Will scorch the earth
And everything that stands in my way.
Overcome!

I am no mortal
As long as this spark is within me
Is within me

As it engulfs me
It changes everything
My soul is on fire for reasons
Made certain by desires found in me

But what choice did I have?
But what choice did I have?

They engraved my back
With this detailed map,
Showing the plan
That I should outlast

I can feel it burning under my flesh
This feeling has averted me to this very second
This moment means everything
I have come to life
Life

As it engulfs me
It changes everything
My soul is on fire for reasons
Made certain by desires found in me

My eyes are burning
My eyes are burning
My eyes are burning
My eyes are burning with desire

Scorch the earth
Scorch the earth

We have overcome
We have overcome
We have overcome

The white flame burns in me
