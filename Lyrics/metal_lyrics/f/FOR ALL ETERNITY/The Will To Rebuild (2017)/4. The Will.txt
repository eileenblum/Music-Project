Pieces of me are scattered too far to see.
Pain ends they say, but it refuses to leave.
I have the will in me, but at times I refuse to believe.
I may seem whole, but I'm missing a crucial piece.
My reality is the hardest truth to instill.
I'm in pieces, I'm in pieces.
Slowly finding the will to rebuild.
