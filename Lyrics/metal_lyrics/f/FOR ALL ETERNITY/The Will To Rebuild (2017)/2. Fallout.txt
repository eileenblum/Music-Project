Inhale, inhale, life leaves as smoke prevails
These walls weep as my will to live simply fails
Inhale, inhale, few words remain in the wake of betrayal
I've felt every stone and every nail

You said this world was behind us
You used these words to define us

With every chance to pull back your hand
You sparked the match, you sparked the match
You sparked the match and let us burn

I'm standing in this house, burning down
Was it worth it, was it worth it
Twisting home into my own hell?

I'll never find my own sense of self
In another person, I've been far too complacent
So now I know my whole world is flammable

Inhale, inhale, it's coming down and I'm not so certain
There's something wrong here
Inhale, inhale, confining walls are built to burn
Oh, this is a place I hope to never return

Watch me tear this wall of fire open
And crawl from the furnace our love once sculpted
From the inside I was blinded
Broader vision helps to define it, you can't deny this

You said this world was behind us
You used these words to define us
No matter your intention
All you ever did was confine us

I feel the air
I feel the air

For the first time in years
For the first time in years, I feel the air
For the first time in years, I feel the air
