This is the sound of my certain self being unwound.
I sink deeper and deeper into hell, a hollow shell entering a new realm.
Inside my mind, captive to a new Reich.

So this is what it sounds like?
This is what it sounds like.

Hell.
It's all around.
Hell.

So this is what it sounds like.
Failure to prevail. Trapped in my own cell, living in my own hell.

What is worth discerning through all this hurting?
This is truly concerning.

I've seen hell and home blur together.
Am I a man or a monster?

Am I a man or a monster?

I can feel it now.

No returning back through all this hurting.
The deep and dark has swallowed me up.
There's no describing what I have become.

Must I destroy myself to see the good prevail?
I was certain of who I was, but now I'm certain that it's all lost.
Seems so much harder now, to keep my feet on the ground.

I don't belong here, trapped in this nightmare.
Pick me up, pull me out from this place that has me bound.

I don't belong here, trapped in this nightmare.
This is my life unwound and this is how it sounds.

This is how it sounds.
This is how it sounds.

Will I ever exist again, with my own heart within my own skin?

Can you feel it now?
