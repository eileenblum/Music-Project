Can a broken man speak whole words?
Can hope be taught from a place of hurt?
Can love exist in a world of hate?
Can truth outlast even the faintest of faith?

Will I ever know?

I can feel there's a devil in me refusing to leave.
My life didn't end, it never began.
There's a thorn in me that won't leave me be.

So when my last breath fails and I start to go,
Will I figure out what's been binding up my heart?
We can't go back to where it began.
The hardest times are the times we're living in.
Right now.

We are the shadow.
