Drowning in every word you've said to me.
Realising the tide is swallowing me.
I can't breathe, I can't breathe.
My visions blurred though I clearly see.

Is it clearer?
The way in which you left me.
The hope I hold for life itself is locked away.

Is it clearer?
How easily you broke me.
You've had my heart all along.
You hold the key.

What you've said and done can never be forgotten.
Cos my trust is lost and my love is gone,
I don't feel I can ever move on.

From a lie to a lie to a lie to a lie, just to get you by.
From a lie to a lie to a lie to a lie, just to get you by.

The place I want to be I can never go.
The waves of suffering are crashing so slow.
So slow.

Is it clearer?
The way in which you left me.
The hope I hold for life itself is locked away.

Is it clearer?
How easily you broke me.
You've had my heart all along.
You hold the key.

I'm waiting for the hands that mend.
I'm waiting for the hands that mend, to make me whole again.

To make me whole again.

Is it clearer?
