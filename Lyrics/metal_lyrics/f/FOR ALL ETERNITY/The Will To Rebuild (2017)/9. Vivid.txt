Light still bleeds in through the window, I lay faintly awake.
A gentle warmth is present as I discern my thoughts from my dreams.

I've been here for weeks with only few winks of sleep.

The tears keep flowing and flowing.
The pain keeps growing and growing, to no end.

My mind now knows what my body refuses to believe.
The worst part of losing you, I know I've lost me too.

I've been here for weeks, with only few winks of sleep.
Our love once alight, is now lost to the night.

The tears keep flowing and flowing.
The pain keeps growing and growing.
