As the wind blows, hope from sorrow
This place we used to call our home leaves me cold as stone

The voice of the vacated is still present

In a way it has never left
I wish the pain away but it holds in my skin
Old wounds are the words I have left unsaid
The pain behind these eyes is the kind you don't forget

You've taken everything, more of me that anyone ever has
Now I'm taking it all back, taking it back

We were tethered, you and I
Tangled up in a lie, intertwined
We were tethered, held together
I may seem free but I'm lost behind your eyes

Pain is shaping who I am
Time is taking me away from this
When I arrive, survived and determined
I can rebuild with the pieces that remain untaken

I may be broken and hurting in this place you left
Place you left
But in a flicker, this will be a memory
Years in the past

Hold on, hold on, hold on
These words will soon be gone

My heart refuses to restart
It once beat in time with yours
Our eyes lock and I remember what we've lost

Across this barren plane, staring you in the face
I'll say it again as I've said it before
These scars are the same as yours

As the wind blows, hope from sorrow
This place we used to call our home leaves me cold as stone
