I've been pulled back, from the jaws of death.
The knife moves slow through skin on bone.

Time I had to myself in my head on my own,
Almost severed the light of life I've always known.
No second chances, none for granted.
These two feet are planted.
Through the heart of the moment somehow I'm still standing.

I know I'm stronger than I've ever been.
For what its worth, through all this hurt, I'm still standing now.
Claws draw light from the hole in my soul, how don't they understand.
I'm more than a man.

Ascendant.

I am alive, take a look inside.
Every ounce of me fights to survive.
All that I've said and done doesn't matter.
This war is won.

Drowned out by thoughts of the past, none of it matters, nothing ever lasts.
I count myself blessed to be free from the grips of heresy.

I know I'm stronger than I've ever been.
For what it's worth, through all this hurt, I'm still standing now.
For what it's worth, through all this hurt.
I know nothing can break me, nothing can break my skin.
They'll see I'm still standing now.

Claws draw me back to the hell I've known.
Claws draw me back to the edge of death.
They mustn't know I am, ascendant.

Ascendant.
