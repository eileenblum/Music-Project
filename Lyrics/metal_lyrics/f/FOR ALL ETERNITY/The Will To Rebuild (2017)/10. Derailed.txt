Could your life pour out through the chip in the glass?
Could you hold regret as your time slips past?
If it doesn't hurt then what's it worth?

That's why I remain within the pain
Nothing is lost and no one is to blame
That's why I remain within the pain
Afraid to feel? Be afraid to slip away

Granting yourself no escape, counting every single day
Comfort is the road to a life left to waste
Contentment is the freight train to decay

That's why I remain within the pain
Nothing is lost and no one is to blame
That's why I remain within the pain
Afraid to feel? Be afraid to slip away

Be afraid, all you love will lead you astray
Be afraid, be afraid to slowly decay

Far too much time I've spent hidden away
Holding my breath in just to feel okay
I feel my heart is far too far away
Life left me lost, it's only me to blame

How far must I fall
Before I feel some self-remorse?
How far, must I go
Before I find my way back home?

On the tilt of time, on the brink of life
On the edge of night, purpose looms in the light

Don't be afraid, you're safe
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

How far must I fall?
How far must I go?

How far must I go?
