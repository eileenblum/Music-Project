You were life and love upon this island
And it was hard but you made it all worthwhile
So afraid that I'm gonna run away
If I was I wouldn't be here today ay
And you you took me by the heart
And showed me where I was deep inside your love
You will never hear me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say it's over now
I look at you and I see that there's a fear
There's something wrong
But you're holdin' back your tears
Well here is where I am and where I'll stay
So lose the bad thoughts push 'em far away ay
Hope and dreams will take the shape
I'm shootin' for the stars and diamonds for your eyes
You will never hear me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say it's over now
You will never hear me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say it's over now
You will never hear me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say it's over now
You will never hear me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say it's over now
You will never hear me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say it's over now never hear never
Never hear the words the pain that hurts
Never hear the words the pain that hurts
Never hear the words
