I know you've been up I've seen you flyin'
Sometimes I'd wish that you would fall down
I'm tired of your act you're not even tryin'
Any dreams of hope are dashed all away
I'll take you down so you can see me
Take you down what you've done to me
Take you down you're wanted by all below
Oh oh oh oh oh fallen angel oh oh oh oh oh fallen angel
Many times alone I've been here waitin'
And many times again I could not care less
But you've got a hold and deep down I'm shakin'
But I won't let you make a fool out of me
I'll take you down so you can see me
Take you down what you've done to me
Take you down you're wanted by all below
Oh oh oh oh oh fallen angel oh oh oh oh oh fallen angel
Oh oh oh oh oh fallen angel oh oh oh oh oh fallen angel
