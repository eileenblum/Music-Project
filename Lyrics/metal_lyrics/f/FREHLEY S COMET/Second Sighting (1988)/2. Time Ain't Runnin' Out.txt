Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Monday mornin' the sun wasn't out you were lazy
The fight last night it didn't set right I was hazy
But you were cool actin' like nothin' had happened
Time ain't runnin' out you hurt me for the last time last time
And time ain't runnin' out 'cause I'm leavin'
The thing with the stare it just wasn't fair you rubbed it in my face
And how do I know when I'm not around he's not takin' my place
I'm done with abuse knowin' you'll never admit it to me
Time ain't runnin' out you hurt me for the last time last time
And time ain't runnin' out 'cause I'm leavin'
I'm leavin' oh I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
Maybe someday not far away you'll remember this voice
Oh maybe you won't maybe you can't but you were given a choice
I was ever so close but so far away do you remember
Do you remember could you remember remember
Time ain't runnin' out you hurt me for the last time last time
And time ain't runnin' out 'cause I'm leavin'
Time ain't runnin' out you hurt me for the last time last time
And time ain't runnin' out 'cause I'm leavin'
Time ain't runnin' out you hurt me for the last time last time
And time ain't runnin' out 'cause I'm leavin'
I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin' yeah
