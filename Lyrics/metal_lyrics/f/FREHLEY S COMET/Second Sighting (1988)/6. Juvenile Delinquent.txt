You want to rock and roll it's been your big dream
You ought to celebrate girl you're only sixteen
Ignore your mom and dad and do what you feel
You gotta be yourself and follow your dream
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Don't let them say say that you're bad
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Just follow your dreams you'll never be sad
You ain't a kid no more adolescence behind
You're lookin' good these days believe me girl I'm not blind
Now there's no turnin' back baby you've made up your mind
It's time to stand your ground you know that you've turned the tide
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Don't let them say say that you're bad
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Just follow your dreams you'll never be sad
Life's too short you gotta realize the days go by turn into years
Rock and roll it's just a way of life it's here for me for me and you
It's time to party now enjoy what we've missed
Screw everybody else and raise up your fist
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Don't let them say say that you're bad
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Just follow your dreams you'll never be sad
Now listen don't let them call you
A juvenile delinquent don't let them say
Say that you're bad don't let them say that
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent
Just follow your dreams you'll never be sad
