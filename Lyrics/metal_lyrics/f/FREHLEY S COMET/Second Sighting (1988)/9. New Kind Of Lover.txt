She's made of shadows that live at night
Oh I dream of things no one would dare
Last night she came to me for a second time
And through the walls suspended in the air
She's a new kind of lover and she loves like no other
She came to me from a long time ago
She's a new kind of lover she makes love like no other
I don't wanna know that she's a ghost
She knows my secrets when we're alone
Oh she plays them out while I'm asleep
Last night she woke me up with a touch so cold
Can it be she's playin' me for keeps
She's a new kind of lover she makes love like no other
She came to me from a long time ago
She's a new kind of lover she makes love like no other
I don't wanna know that she's a ghost
I don't wanna know please don't let me know
A new kind of lover she makes love like no other
She came to me from a long time ago
She's a new kind of lover she makes love like no other
I don't wanna know that she's a ghost
She's a new kind of lover she makes love like no other
She came to me from a long time ago
She's a new kind of lover she makes love like no other
I don't wanna know that she's a ghost
