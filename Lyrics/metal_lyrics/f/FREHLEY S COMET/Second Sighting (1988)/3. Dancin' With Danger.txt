Frozen fingers on a coco wheel
Hot emotions that you can't conceal
Stay on the freeway take the chance of your life
Screamin' sirens cryin' in your ear
Flashin' red lights burnin' in the mirror
Come on step on it get them out of your sight
Can't be too cool when you're dancin' with danger
Don't play the fool when you're dancin' with danger hey
Runnin' lonely and your out of steam
Silent madness when you try to speak
Shattered pictures of a face you once knew
Life can't be too cool when you're dancin' with danger
Don't be too cool when you're dancin' with danger
Can't be too cool when you're dancin' with danger
Don't play the fool when you're dancin' with danger
Can't be too cool when you're dancin' with danger
Don't play the fool when you're dancin' with danger
Life can't be too cool when you're dancin' with ha ha danger
