Some people call me a walkin' disaster just a waitin' for a place to occur
But I still got enough that'll last her til the blood gets ready to burn
My meter's runnin' still got a lot of livin' to do
I live five days to your one and you know it's true yeah
Listen I got money I got fame got everything to play this game
No sorrow no shame 'cause nothin' matters when you're insane
It's never easy bein' the crazy just a job someone's got to do
Take a number and stand in the line for the good life you never knew
My meter's runnin' still got a lot of livin' to do
I live five days to your one and you know it's true yeah
Listen I got money I got fame got everything to play this game
No sorrow no shame 'cause nothin' matters when you're insane
My meter's runnin' still got a lot of livin' to do
I live five days to your one and you know it's true yeah
I got money I got fame got everything to play this game
No sorrow no shame 'cause nothin' matters when you're insane
Got money I got fame got everything to play this game
No sorrow no shame 'cause nothin' matters when you're insane
I got money I got fame got everything to play this game
No sorrow no shame 'cause nothin' matters when you're insane
