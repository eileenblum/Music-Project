He's got a holster filled up with grief
I wouldn't wanna cross his line I'd end up underneath
He's got an angry look of action shoot off both your knees
His gun was smokin' recently pleased
You don't wanna cross wits better not try
You couldn't learn his limits and you don't have the mind
Loser in a fight loser in a fight
Better learn to run your winnin' days are done
Loser in a fight loser here tonight
Better learn to run your winnin' days are done
He's a thinker you can see it sometimes the eyes don't lie
And if your head is empty he'll make your body die
I don't need his aggravation I'm better than the rest
You better shut up or stand up 'cause soon will come the test
You don't wanna cross wits better not try
You couldn't learn his limits and you don't have the mind
Loser in a fight loser in a fight better learn to run
Your winnin' days are done
Loser in a fight loser here tonight better learn to run
Your winnin' days are done done done
This would be the one guy to ignore
Ooh if you wanna save your face from hittin' the floor
So now would be the right time right time
I wouldn't want to cross wits better not try
You couldn't learn his limits and you don't have the time
Loser in a fight loser here tonight better learn to run
Your winnin' days are done
Loser in a fight loser here tonight better learn to run
Your winnin' days are done
Loser in a fight loser here tonight
Better learn to run your winnin' days are done
Loser in a fight loser in a fight
Ha ha ha ha ha oh just go go go go
