Hey Vinnie I got this new fighter from the Bronx
He's a natural oh yeah how
Reminds me of Jake Lamato no you can't lose with this one
You want a piece of the action or what Jake Lamato eh
See if Luis wants in I'll talk to you later
Alright ciao you got it Eugene's place can I help you
Hey Eugene this is Patsy Mitola
Listen I want to put five hundred on the acorn
And uh Eugene let's make sure
This guy spins in the third round
Know what I'm saying alright I got ya you're in
The acorn the best there has been yet
Hold it ladies and gentlemen
The acorn's spinning he's down on the canvas
This is the third time he's been down
Oh my God I don't think he's gonna get up
Ladies and gentleman I think it's all over
Eight nine ten it's over the acorn's lost
Listen curly the acorn may have lost this one
But there's gonna be a rematch
And when he comes back he's gonna be stronger than ever
Believe me I got a lot of faith in this kid
Man he's from the Bronx the best
