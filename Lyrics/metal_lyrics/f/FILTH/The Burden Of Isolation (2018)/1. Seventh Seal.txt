Fear of eternal sleep.
Take my hand, and life you shall defeat.
May the darkness take me, relinquishing me unto the blackest flame.
Death's icy grip lunges forward from the grave instilling fear within me.
A sense of panic leaves me locked in a gaze, for what I saw still haunts me 'til this day.
I cling to life beneath these sweat stained sheets.
It's all I've ever known.
It's all I'll ever be, but there's no turning back.
But there's no turning back.
Embrace the void with death up my spine.

Fear of eternal sleep.
What you've sewn now you must reap.
Fear of eternal sleep.
No! No more must you weep.

I cling to life beneath these sweat stained sheets.
It's all I've ever known.
It's all I'll ever be, but there's no turning back.
But there's no turning back, embrace the void with death up my spine
But there's no turning back, embrace the void with death up my spine
I feared in breathing, now I may rest my head.
Mourn the living, shed no tears for the dead.
