The world's are waging war inside of my head
For the isolation has become my dearest friend.
Silence the chaos, fortify the mind.
What will I find lurking on the inside?
What will I find?

Deeper down into the stillness, where no light resides, just the maddening cries of my mind, where no light resides.
Contorted and frantically thrashing of limbs as I'm held down, but expected to swim.
Dragged through the abyss and then sentenced to drown.
As the void pulls me down.

Darkness envelopes me, one becomes two, a voice in the distance cries "I'm in here with you".
No one else deserves to be here.
You are all that I need.
A sacrament I give to thee.
Suffer to succeed.

The world's are waging war inside of my head. For the isolation has become my dearest friend.
I am finally whole. I've lost myself a long time ago.
But now I've found my mind.
Deeper down into the stillness.
Cast aside all life.

There is war waging inside of me.
Waging endlessly!

Exiled myself, searching only within.
Waging inside my head!
