I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.
Left alone with my thoughts just waiting to expire.
So you tell me compassion just isn't how you're wired.
For you I swear id lay it all on the line.

Give me my life back stay the fuck out of my mind.

I'm just a damaged, just a damaged man!

Once again I've let you slip right through my hands.
You've always lingered, it's something I can't stand.
Running through my fingers just like sand.

In the deepest chasm of my mind, you crawl back every time.
Say what you want but you where never mine.
You're just killing time.

So numb yourself and take another line, you're just killing time.
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Sleep at night.
You wear me out and drain me dry.

Something within me still won't let you die.
So numb yourself, take another line.
Suppression is the art of getting by. We're just killing time.

I refuse to give praise to your walking monument of shame.
You've always lingered, it's something I can't stand.
Running through my fingers just like sand.
