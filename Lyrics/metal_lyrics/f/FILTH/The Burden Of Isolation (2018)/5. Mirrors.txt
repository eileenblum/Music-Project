These mirrors are everywhere, forcing me to see what has always been there.
What lies beneath made plain as day.
The truth revealed to my dismay.

Man believes what he sees to be reality.
Our intentions residing in the dark.
Deviant desires run rampant in the mind and heart.
Destroy the ego.

As man we covet what we see.
Lost in our own vanity.
Our eyes have forsaken us.
There's a face staring back at me,
It's not me, nothings what it seems.
Destroy the ego. Destroy the ego!

The Old God's have met their end.
Every head shall bow, pay homage to the new kings.
Masturbation, and instant gratification, this is what we seek.
This is what we seek.

Look inside your mind, and you will find that we do not exist.
All we have is time, our lives must be eclipsed.
All we have is time, our lives must be eclipsed.

The downfall of humanity, struck down by what we cannot see.
There's a face staring back at me. It's not me!
Worship what we see.
There's a face staring back at me. It's not me.
Worship that which bleeds.
Worship, worship that which bleeds.

Total annihilation of the concept that I exist.
We are everything and nothing, residing in this world of shit.
