[feat. Aiden Versteegh of Falsifier]The black coach of sorrow has arrived for me.
A putrid stench pervading the air, fills my lungs as I try to breathe.
Emerging forth from the abyss, darkness covers me.
Plaguing me of my insecurities.
May the shadows embrace me with the kiss of death.

May I suffer slow.
For the pain is all I know.
Struck by the blade of woe.
Baptized in sorrow.
Caught in the undertow.

Death come take me put an end to all my suffering.
I can't escape myself, my mind is the enemy.

Death come take me put an end to all my suffering. I can't escape myself, my mind is the enemy.

I'm trapped in this hollow shell, confined to a living hell. Deep within the cracks of solitude that is where my demons dwell.
Forcing me to pay penance.
I've brought this on myself.
Stuck in the muck of life, all my attempts have failed.

My mind is the enemy.
This life is suffocating me.
I'm trying so hard just to breathe.
I'm suffocated by these memories.

Life leaves so effortlessly, I am the thing that should not be.

[Aiden:]
The first breath is the beginning of death.
In this life I am my greatest foe met.
A lead filled isolation to make it all end.
Were all fucked, I'm just trying to clear my head.

No one can save me from myself.
Death has come for me this is the hand I'm dealt.
It's dead fingers grasping at my throat.
Let them know that I'm glad to go.

Life is filled with grief and sorrow, may I never see tomorrow.

[Dustin/Aiden:]
Life is filled with grief and sorrow, may I never live to see tomorrow.
