Shed these shackles.
Existence makes the heart grow colder.
The pain of loss pushing me forward, but I can't shake this fear of growing older.

All I see are blank faces in the crowd, voices beckon me, but are void of sound. They're seeking to let me drown, let me drown. Over and over constantly pulling me down, let me drown.
Hands reach out in every direction catering to to the pleasures of the flesh. Ripping and tearing until there's nothing left.

Existence makes the heart grow colder.
The pain of loss pushing me forward, but I can't shake this fear of growing older.

Mortality means nothing to me, take my hand. Drown with me.

I release restraints, holding me down, I will break these chains, binding me.

Led to the water
Like a lamb to the slaughter,
Submerged with your son's and daughters.
I try to reach the surface but still I falter.

It waits in every shallow corner.
It waits for us all.

Mother of abomination I accept this gift of sin.

Shed the skin of humanity, and let deviance win.
