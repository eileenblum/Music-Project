I seek perpetual darkness.
Cold and grim let me lay broken-hearted.
The vastness of silence bring me solace, for your emptiness is all I've ever wanted.
Sorrow painted signs along the streets, may these signs be the last for me.

They'll want to know what's wrong with me.
Thoughts of isolation haunting my dreams.
The way is plain even a fool can see my tormentor is me.

This is where they all go to die!

Seeking embrace to my own dismay, I could never be saved.
I've got this sinking sensation in the pit of my chest that existing was never enough, and I'm dead set on giving up.

I could have sworn I felt your heart stop beating.
Tighten the noose to cease your breathing.
Tighten the noose to cease your breathing.

One by one you will meet your untimely demise.
Numbing the sensation a creation of my mind.
I'd kill you again to relive it a second time.
This is where they all go to die.

I close my eyes to rid myself of this cruel design.

When I wake I'll no longer be me, may the sun never shine for me!
