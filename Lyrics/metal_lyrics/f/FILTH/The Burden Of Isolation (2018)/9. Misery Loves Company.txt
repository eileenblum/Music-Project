I am spent, just wasting my days.
One step closer to lying in my grave.
As I wither away in know things can never be the same.

What is my purpose if I am not by your side, just existing with no end in sight?
I'm waiting to die.
This is no kind of life. You are nowhere to be found. I'm trapped in this endless hell, loves the greatest lie.
This is no kind of life. You are nowhere to be found. I'm trapped in this endless hell, loves the greatest lie.

So fragile so weak, laid waste at your feet. Must bend and submit before it is sent to die.

Hang me on display for the world to see.
Here lies what is left of the man that should not be.
Awaiting the void to devour me.

I've never felt so high (so high), I've never felt low (so low).
I've never felt so high (so high), I've never felt low (so low).

Sweet hand of death, bring me to my knees.

Purge these emotions because misery loves company.
Lost in my head, but not lost in you.
Who would have thought that my heart would tie the noose.
Such is the way of youth.

I've never felt so high, I've never felt so low.
This is the source of suffering.
Misery loves company.
I'll put an end to you and me.
End my suffering.
