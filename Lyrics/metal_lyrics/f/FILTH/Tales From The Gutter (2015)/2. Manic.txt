I am a damaged man

Conflicted by both sides of the coin
Every thought that comes into your head
I hope that I am beginning &amp; end

There's only one rule for this game
Of life we're in it's win

Jealousy plagues me
&amp; cuts me to the very core

All I want is for you to accept me
&amp; be my fucking whore

No I can't let them see
Bury it, bury it deep
So no one will ever see
The monster that dwells in me

All on your knees
Come see the greatest fraud ever to be seen
A coward who boast about his class &amp; prestige
Is this really what they think of me?

No I can't let them see
Bury it, bury it deep
So no one will ever see

I will not let them hear
The tongues that I speak
My very thoughts seek to betray me
I have fallen from the peak
Into the trenches I shall retreat

I am a damaged man [3x]
