Just let me fucking sleep forever

I awoke from a dream to see that life is a nightmare
Just let me sleep forever

I search for open windows yearning to cure this itch
But it's the fear of flying that stops me
[2x]

Day dreams of my feet dangling from branches that snap
From this heavy burden embedded in my mind
I'll sleep forever if given the chance

Hell's not in my head it's every breath I take
&amp; every fucking move I make
I awoke from a dream to see that life is a nightmare
Just let me sleep forever

Life is nothingness, &amp; nothingness without an end
If this is a game, I give up, I can't win
All you inconsiderate fucks, all you sluts
Made me this way
Coward, liar, fake, faggot, insecure
That's what they'll all say
That's what they'll all say
Fake, faggot, insecure
That's what they'll say

But in the end they're left to suffer in this hell everyday

They will never comprehend this eternal gift of sleep they've placed into my hands
Everlasting sleep [2x]
