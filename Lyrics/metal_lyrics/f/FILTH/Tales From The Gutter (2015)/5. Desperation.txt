Sinking down into this pit of despair
I take a look around to see how I got here
There is a fear that dwells inside of my mind
Constantly plaguing me
I'm at the end of the line

Here all light has ceased to exist
It seems the shadows have become my only friend
The void keeps calling me
Death extends a cold hand
I embrace it
This concept of life I just can't comprehend

Take me to the gallows
Hang this noose around my neck
For I know what's next
This world is a living Hell
Deep in the dirt is where I'd rather dwell

Life is pointless
Full of false promises
It makes me beg for the end

We all where born to suffer
In this Hell we call home
Seeking compassion yet we all die alone

Take me to the gallows
Hang this noose around my neck
For I know what's next
This world is a living Hell
Deep in the dirt is where I'd rather dwell
[2x]

Tear my eyes from their sockets
So I don't have to see this travesty of the world we live in
If I've learned one thing in life
There are two things that we all feel
Disdain &amp; pain
False emotions are only here to numb the pain a little longer
