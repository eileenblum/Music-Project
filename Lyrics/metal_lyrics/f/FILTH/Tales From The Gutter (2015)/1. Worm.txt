They say the road to Hell
Is paved with good intentions
But your life isn't worth
Honorable mention
The ones you love fall victim to your game
But we all see that you'll never fucking change
Your life is a shadow of its former, seeking instant gratification
To numb the pain a little longer
No names &amp; no faces, just bodies in the same situations

You lead them astray
As you throw your life away

Deception is your game, purest form, no remorse [2x]

No pity for a lifeless corpse
No remorse
