Look into my eyes
This pain will never subside
It's through death that I am truly alive

Here in this shell of a man
Lies an emptiness so profound
The outside world is suffocating him
I'm sure he'll drown

Dragged down
Content with nothing
Obsessed with everything
These voices in my head
Tell me I'll live when I am fucking dead
I'm running out of time
Ask me if I'm fine
Ask me if I'm fucking fine

Nothing left to gain
Everything left to fucking lose
The world is cold as ice
With no regards for life

The cards you are dealt
You have to take them in strife
I have a losing hand
Tell the demon when I dig
That I'm the winner in the end

This is how I'll leave my mark
A target on the face of the world
This is how I'll leave my mark

In this shell of a man
Lies an emptiness so profound
The outside world is suffocating him
I'm sure he'll drown
