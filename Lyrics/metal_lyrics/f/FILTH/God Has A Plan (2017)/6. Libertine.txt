Pain as if knife just met bone.
Pushing the boundaries of pleasure that no man has known.

We have such sights to show you.
Break you, mold you, so if you think this is suffering
You've seen nothing yet.

I'm going to light up your body, and scorch every nerve ending, every sense is completely shattered.
Give yourself to me
When you start to scream your lighted eyes they slowly fade.

I breathe life into you just to take it all away.
This elasticity of skin you've bestowed unto me brings me to insanity.

I remember a time when I pledged my allegiance to the divine with compassion in mind.
Your skin is mine to oppress.
I am the heathen, I am pain.

I'm intoxicated dripping with the power of her flesh.

Illuminating what was once dark.
Pulling the lust from my heart to the surface.

I give in to these animalistic urges.
I am the heathen, I am pain.

I'm going to light up your body and scorch every nerve ending, every sense is completely shattered.
Give yourself to me
When you start to scream your lighted eyes the slowly fade.

You will suffer unto me!
This sensory overload will bring you to your knees.

Pain, pleasure and pain are one in the same, the two are indivisible.
Pain, pleasure and pain are one in the same, the two are indivisible.
Pain, pleasure and pain are one in the same, the two are indivisible
