[feat. Adam Warren of Oceano]Plunge me into the depths.
A place bereft of life.
Dead hands fasten around my neck.
Siphoning what sanity I have left.

Do my eyes deceive me?
Reality is not what it seems.
False tongues betray me.
The blackened speech only serves to avert my gaze.

My heart ceases beating, I've lost all sense of meaning.
I'm off the deep end, I'm going off the deep end.
Constantly drowning I can't keep sinking.
I'm going off the deep end.

[Adam Warren of Oceano:]
The earth splits and swallows me whole.
Limbs reach out to tare at the very fabric of my soul.
This blood runs cold.
Crushed beneath the heel of a world so cruel.
Broken I have nothing, I've been played for a fool.
I've been played for a fool.
I've been played for a fool!

I was fixated on what's in front of me.
Sedated kept blind to what can never be.
Such sights eyes weren't meant to see.
This will be the death of me.

My heart ceases beating, it seems I have lost all meaning.
I'm off the deep end, I'm going off the deep end.
I'm drowning constantly, I can't keep sinking.

What do you do when life is spiraling down?
Exist in silence, I dare not make a sound.

Contorted and mangled, left clinging to life.

Sedated kept blind to what can never be.
I have hell inside me.

I have hell inside me.
I have hell inside me!
