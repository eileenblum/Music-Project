I saw the sky collapse and rain down death from above.

I felt the earth tremble beneath my feet
Shaking the foundation of man.
We've wasted our lives on the here and now.
Thinking our new way of life is profound.

Living life for the minute, and not for the hour.
When will you open your eyes to see that everything you loved has died.

Everything you loved has died.

No regrets that's what you said
No regrets that's what you said
No regrets that's what you said.

To appease this digital age.

You're bought and sold and made a slave.
Never knowing you're one foot in the grave.
You're bought and sold and made a slave.
No regrets. No regrets that's what you'll say.

We where born to fucking rot.

We've brought this on ourselves.
We've brought this on ourselves.
We've brought this on ourselves!

The self righteous passing judgement on everyone else.

When you where bought and sold and made a slave.
Never knowing that you're one foot in the grave.
We all deserve to die, but I'm called a cynic.

I am pathetic but I admit it.
I am so selfish but I admit it.
