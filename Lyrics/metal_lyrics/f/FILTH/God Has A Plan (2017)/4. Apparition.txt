[feat. Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murder]Doomed to walk the earth alone.

I've lived as a Specter with disdainful thoughts of life.
For the dead can never hurt you.
Fear the ones that dwell among the light.

Dead but not allowed to die
Alive as good as dead.
Forgotten are the memories that once filled your head.

Hang me from the highest tree.

Hang me from the highest tree.
Sear me, wreckage of flesh I burn for thee.
No tears don't mourn for me.

[Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murders:]
Hang me from the highest tree
Wreckage of flesh I burn for thee.
I shoot you into my veins once again hoping to feel the light of the sun.
The choirs sing songs about the end in hopes that they may live again.

Left alive long enough to drain my last breath this is a fate more miserable than death.
Just let me cease to exist.

Built for dissection, I was born to lose.
This weight has sought to bury me.

I'm trapped here in this tomb.
Faint screams of desperation, my cries go ignored.

[Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murders:]
Into the void, submerge myself in darkness.
I am master of blight, fear all life.

The dead can never hurt you.
Fear the ones that dwell in the light.

[Dustin Mitchell and Trevor Strnad:]
I shoot you into my veins once again, hoping to feel the light of the sun.
