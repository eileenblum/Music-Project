They told me to try when everything I've known is a lie.
To forgive, forget and let die.
Pain is a matter of the mind.
When will my agony subside.

They told me to try when everything I've known is a lie.
To forgive, forget and let die.
Pain is a matter of the mind.

You are cancer, I'm a cynic with every laceration
I know you fucking meant it, bitch!

I can't escape you, I'm coming apart at the seams.
My heads unraveling but your conscious is clean.
You don't know what you mean to me.
Can't you see what this does to me.
If I could speak my screams would be deafening.

I bite my tongue.
My minds the tree and these thoughts are my branches

Psychologically lynching myself day in and day out.
Day in and day out!

Am I pathetic?
Am I pathetic?!

Keep my head held high.
When all love began to subside.
That's when they told me kid, you better hang 'em high.

Hang 'em high, hang 'em high.
Hang me high, hang me high.

Hang me high, leave me to die.

Hang me high, leave me to die.

Hang me high, leave me to die.

I'll keep my head held high.
I'll keep my hopes held high.
That's when they told me kid you better, hang 'em high.
They say God has a plan
Well let me tell you kid it's a lie!
