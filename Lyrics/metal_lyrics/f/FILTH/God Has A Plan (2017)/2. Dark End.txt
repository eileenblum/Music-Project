Welcome to the masquerade.
We're all pretending just to make it through the day.

What we do must never come to light.
Dwelling in the dark for what's wrong feels so right.
They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us at the dark end.
They're gonna find us at the dark end.

I'm smashed into pieces living hour by hour
Twenty four is too much to devour.
My eyes where blind but these words are so sour.
How does it feel to be alive?

How does it feel to be alive?
Here in my mind I've died a thousand times.

Dwelling in the dark for what's wrong feels so right.
Hand in hand my friend
This is the end.
My head is like a cage without a key
My thoughts run rampant.
These words I dare not speak.

In the shadows I wait and creep.

Sever my tongue to silence my speech.
So you may never lay eyes on this atrocity.

Seeking refuge in the depths for what we are must never see the surface.

So grim this game of skin were living in.
I'm not playing to win.

Despair is where I've made my bed
I'm not losing sleep.

Hell's inside my head!

When God fails, the noose prevails!
