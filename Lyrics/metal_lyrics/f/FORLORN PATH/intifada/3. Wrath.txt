Tears pouring, the watchful ones are quelled
Fog spreading, purblindness kindled

Nature's wrath, so vast, arrives
Ruins our progeny's lives

Jades falling as a mist of plumes
Buds halting, never will they grow

Pox upon the infidels!

Nature's wrath, so vast, arrives
Ruins all

Degrading
Our provider altered to a death pyre
