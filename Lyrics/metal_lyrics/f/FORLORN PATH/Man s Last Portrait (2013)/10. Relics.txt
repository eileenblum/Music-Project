I find myself on a ravaged path
Ruins before me, sun at my back
Shattered spires reach for the sky
With their broken arms

Mouthless skulls lament
Relics of a world gone mad
Weak with roots in shame
Victims of the choice they made

Broken walls scaled by vine and thorn
Hold more life now than before
Gods of indifference and deceit
Lay their dead hands here

Weak with roots in shame
Victims of the choice they made

Those who would destroy
Carriers of their own plague
Was it not enough,
Killing all that nature made?

In years of walking the wastelands,
I never saw such grief
I swear by my life,
This grove is better for the loss

Mankind learns its harshest lesson:
Only death can pay for life

Empires rust
The world moves on
Man falls to dust
The world moves on

The avarice our nature holds will be our downfall

Mankind learns its harshest lesson:
Only death can pay for life
