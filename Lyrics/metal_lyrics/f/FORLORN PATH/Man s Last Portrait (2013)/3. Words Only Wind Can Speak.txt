Fathom a realm beyond mortal ken
Eyes not wide enough to drink it in

I bid, because I've been there before,
Torn between where I am and where I was

Free from this cursed suffering
And the anguish this world pours upon me
At last this was the one time
I thought: I am truly home

I've seen colors unbeknownst to human eyes
Verdant plains dulling everything past seen
I've heard words that only wind can speak
Lamenting hymns that nature sang to me
This memory is etched within my mind
Now and eternally

Forget all the trappings of the world
That choke me with my sorrows
Loose me from my lesser self
And take everything else

Gaze plagued by ash
I will never walk there
Gaze plagued by ash
I will never walk there again

My eyes closed, all life in gray
The earth springs cold, brown in decay
Iâve lost the words that only wind can speak
I am deaf to what nature shrieks at me
Those memories dwell deep within my soul
For then, for now, and forever
