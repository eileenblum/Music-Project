I have lost my wings
For a world swallowed by spirals
My banishment is my grave anchored in iron

My one star is dead
Since the gentle one was slain
My own dismal heart
Lost and flying petals of disgrace

Suffering bound away in the house of lamentation

And only the trees pronounce my real name
And only the stones can fathom this horrid pain

I give my ghost to the children of dirt
Darkest part of shadows, woods no axe can cut
I deflect the darts of conquering gods
The horizon bleeds, chasing lost voices from below

The desolate hills
The desolate hills and fields
Are foiled by the fog

But then, when your rain
Disappears into the ground
I alone can breathe
The mist that brings a cure to drought

Am I the empire at the end of decadence?
Prince of stricken towers
Bound in Earth's realm forever
