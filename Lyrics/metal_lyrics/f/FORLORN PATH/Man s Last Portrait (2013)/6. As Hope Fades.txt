As I wake from this cold dream,
I seek to find that which I lost long ago,
Yet there is no solace to be foundâ¦

The woods feel empty and frozen in time
The shimmering lights flicker no more
And what hope there once was
Is all but a faded memory

I long to feel your warm embraceâ¦
To hear that voice once againâ¦

The sun's radiance shall never reach this place
In which I am condemned to spend eternity
There is no excuse for that which I have done
And such is my punishment

No hope for salvation
Emptiness draining me

No hope for salvation
Emptiness, eternally
