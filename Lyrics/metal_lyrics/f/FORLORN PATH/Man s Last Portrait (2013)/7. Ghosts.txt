I light a candle in the depth of night
To beckon back the memories, so faint and dear

Let this night take you in its cold embrace
Spirit you to where time stands still
Close your eyes and donât ask why
This pouring rain yet falls for us

Hushed are the words that rang
Throughout every hall I walked
Ashen faces, buried names
You are all that anchors me here

Let this night take you in its cold embrace
Spirit you to where time stands still
Close your eyes and donât ask why
This pouring rain yet falls for us

Frost bows to new earth, to sun,
On the endless march of time
Seasons change, as do we
Release the fragments of the past

Speak no more of deeds long gone
Feelings past, no need to stay
Ghosts may call me from the fog
But your hands will find me in the dark
