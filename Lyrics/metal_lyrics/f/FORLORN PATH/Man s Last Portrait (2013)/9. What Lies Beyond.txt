Kingdoms rise and fall
As rulers pull their strings
Centuries come and go
As we dance to the song of eternity

Sometimes, nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law.
Sometimes, the true nature of reality beckons â¦ from just beyond the horizon.

All that weâve ever known
Dies in the end
All that weâve ever known
Dies in the end
If time shall end, is there no meaning to all that we fight for?

I look up and see no stars in the sky
Degenerate era, devoid of life
Dwarves brown and white, all scattered about

Eternal nothingness from which we came
Will swallow us all in the end
Our futile existence is nothing but the cross we bear

All that weâve ever known
Dies in the end
All that weâve ever known
Dies in the end
If time shall end, is there no meaning to all that we fight for?

Dominion of nothingness, infinite warp
The passage of time, of meaning devoid
What lies beyond, we never will know
