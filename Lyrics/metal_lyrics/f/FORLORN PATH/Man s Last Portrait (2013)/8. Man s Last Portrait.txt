Turned deaf to her cries, despite how loud
Omens set far and wide: the ill symptoms of decay
Replete greed sealed our fate and deplete fountains that source our needs

Life we know is now a memory
And the Earth treks on without a tear
With broad strokes of color, man's last portrait is painted

Gardens once bore fruit, lavish no more
Trees have fallen, sun burns us all
Rivers run poisoned with waste of our kin
All that has come, done from within
Wreaked havoc on her, left vacant her walls
On each wall our deeds are left scrawled
There's only hunger, we've destroyed ourselves
Man's last testament is writ in blood

Life we know is now a memory
And the Earth treks on without a tear
With broad strokes of color, man's last portrait is painted

Memory: all we have as our pillars fall

Envy now from home and heart
All those cut off by snow, sand, or sea
For they're the ones who stand the best chance of all man
Only voices out of the air can reach them

Rows of fallen pillars leave us with only memories
Memories of when we stood as the pride of all creation
Rows of fallen pillars leave us with only memories
Memories of finer hours victims of our voracity

The path we espoused has all been for naught
Yearn for the past tides now defunct
No heed to the signs that pointed to graves
The throes of pain are verity
Too late to lament, too late for amends
Blood of nature's sorrow flows on
There's only death, we've destroyed ourselves
Man's last portrait's been painted color
