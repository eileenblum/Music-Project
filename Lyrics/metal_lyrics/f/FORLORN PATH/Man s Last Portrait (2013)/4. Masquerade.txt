Enter this masquerade of vanity and greed
Faceless shadows dancing without care
Forsaken truth, minds entranced
Blind to their demise

Empty vessels
Breed corruption
As the clock nears
Their hour of penance

Devoid of thought
Servile
Pawns in this twisted charade

As the world suffers
At the reddest hands of fate

Empty vessels
Breed corruption
As the clock nears
Their hour of penance

Devoid of thought
Servile
Pawns in this twisted charade

And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.
He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one
dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel,
and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.
And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay.
And the flames of the tripods expired.
And Darkness, and Decay, and the Red Death
held illimitable dominion
over all.

As their phantasmic waltz comes to end
They face the doom theyâve brought upon themselves
Glorified idols painted with fear
Time marches on without a care

Empty vessels
Breed corruption
As the clock nears
Their hour of penance

Empty vessels
Breed corruption
As the clock rings
Their hour of penance
