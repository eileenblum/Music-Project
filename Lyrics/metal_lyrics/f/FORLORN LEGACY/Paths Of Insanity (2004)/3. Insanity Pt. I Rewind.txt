I wake up in the bloodbath
my body marked with scars
the taste of hatred, in my mouth
what happened? where am I?
if only I could rewind
this awful scene in my mind
and go byck, back to the start
before the screen goes blank
another shred of flashback
now I know that there's
no thurning back
seized by this dark sensation
I sink deapper, I'm pushed too far
the knife in my hands
the grin on your face
I feel like nothing
can stop me! Your hands
on my neck, the blood from my
veins, can't catch a breath
just to save me!
if only I could go back
bend the time
erase my memories
seal my fate and walk away!
seal my fate and walk away!
