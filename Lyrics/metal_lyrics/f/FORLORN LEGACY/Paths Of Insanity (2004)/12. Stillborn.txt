The clock is ticking
persistent threatening sound
the dead are screaming
new age has began
nuclear winter
cold dawn of a new age
never- ending winter
who deserves to live and tell
stillborn in chaos
new breed of undead men
suicide solutions
new breed genetically altered man
crippled humanity
primeval need to breathe
forced evolution, without souls
half human, half machines
this is the punishment
for all our sins
stillborn in chaos
new age of the human- machine
there is no tomorrow
we destroyed it all today
the life as we know it
has been swept away
stillborn in chaos
