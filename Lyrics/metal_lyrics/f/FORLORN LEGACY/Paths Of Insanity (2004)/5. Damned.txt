Reclined among the lifeless
now your own
years merge the oblivion
guarding the graveyard stones
it's time to take the fate
of a blood-bonded son
from tarnished eyes, the ones
that gave me theyr grim shine
tonight when nobody needs you
no man shall see two feeble hands
clenching the agonized soil
relieve me father
desolation made our sort
forewer tyed to once fallen world
(where honesty silences the hope)
thine grave the throne
in this lifeless place called "home"
as riding weed breaks
through the stone
your debt becomes my crown
when lyst lump of dirt
falls to the ground
horror bites into my mind
'cause I've felt your fading glance
searching for my own
