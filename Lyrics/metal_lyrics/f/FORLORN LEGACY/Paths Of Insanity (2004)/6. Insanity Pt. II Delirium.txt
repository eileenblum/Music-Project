Thock layer of lunacy
riveted to my conciousness
stained my judgement paralyzed
my brain handcuffed, I just stare
at the white scenery of my
prison cell, I shake as the pressure
builds up in my head!
I scream, so these walls
can remember my name
this time I need to stay awake
this time I must not forget,who I am
another dose
another handful of pills
handful of dreams
I'll be torn apart
when the ayr starts to taste
strange and damp 10 years have
passed, 10 years lost in a maze
you've designed in my mind
now I'm immune to the "cure"
reality slowly leaks in my mind
I was caught up in this twisted game
now I'm back from being insane
the stains are all washed away
I'll revenge for every single day.
