Emptiness, do speak
as scars, bleed in my mind
remembrance still keeps
this corpse alive
Burying, time from time
swallowing self ire
coldness. do speak
I'll sneak inside
into this jaded eyes
swallowing self ire
coldness, do speak
from inside
words of comfort
another killer witha a smile
do speak the emptiness
hjde me in your dark rime
so, you came again to tend me
on the last hour
again to haunt me
with thirst engulf my scream
as I enter this creature
behind me
for no legaxy, no open wound
can give me
supremacy
