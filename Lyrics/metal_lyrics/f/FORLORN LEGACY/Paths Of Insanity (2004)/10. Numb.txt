I rise from the pain
tortured by lunacy
cold, numb, unaware of my
body struggling to remember
where I've been
where the soul died
where madness can not espy
there, in peace I will die
'cause I'm not the same man
in my mind
in my eyes, in my eyes
you can sleep insanity
in my eyes, in my eyes,
you canfeed me on the fear
this time, it struck the nerve
nothing left of reality
just a beatting heart,
a wondering thought living
within once existing sanity
no escape, no relief, no mercy
I'm becoming
something numb
beyond a sane man's dream
long live
the anxiety!
