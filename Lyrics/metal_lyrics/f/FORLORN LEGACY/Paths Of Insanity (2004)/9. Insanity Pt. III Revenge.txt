Payback day
I trade this soul
for sweet revenge
my tormentor- infected with fear
I'll have no mercy
like chant in my head
it is the voice of the damed
this dark heart im my chest
pumps out only hate
I'm blinded by this seizure
I have no patience to spare
surrounded by demons
from the past
engulfed in the fire
you set on in my head
I made it my prisoner
and it kept me awake
decades have passed
this is the beginning of the end
often I imaggine my last breath
I nurture this obsession
that gives me stranght!
ten years- in pain- have passed
I waited so long, today
I retaliate
