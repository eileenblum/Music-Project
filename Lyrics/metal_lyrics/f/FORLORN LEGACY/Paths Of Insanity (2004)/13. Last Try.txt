This is the last try
to break through this
empty shallow me, last switch
from dying filth
that learned to breathe
this vulture still biting
trapped inside me
my spirit spasms as I try to speak
hands like serpents strangling, fear
lying down on the floor
I'll vomit my soul, my blood, my life
bearing scream, awake me!
Faithful fear, awake me!
Faithful fear, creep next to me!
Here's your chance to be like me
stabbed within bleeding
hollow scream
I hide my face but it buries my eyes
now I am a blind man lurking
at the sky and my fall is fake
for this burden made my life
and this is the last try to
breathe out the one to whom
I am a kin faithful fear
awake me!
