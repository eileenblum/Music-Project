It seems like I welcome
such a horrible emptiness
as a hope tonight
it's like I hear the footsteps
from where I hide
at least I know we're of the same kind
at least I know I'm disappearing
with my own rime
I welcome you
my other mask.
Now you can see your seed has grown
welcome to illusive trap
I'll be your long lost forgotten son
newer knew why I fulfilled
this vain task
never knew what kept me walking
towards your cold
uncomforting arms
maybe the end can comfort the sanity
left in me, or maybe
I'm already stiff
and this is eternity.
It's all the same to me
still I velcome you with
reverence
