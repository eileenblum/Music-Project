Never again,
Will I fail myself,
Never again will I bow to nothing. [repeat]

All I want, is to change.
For the best.
And all I am is a hollow shell.

Never again,
Will I fail myself,
Never again will I bow to nothing. [repeat]

'Cause every time I'm looking back
I'm reminded, of everything I've done.
And I don't need it anymore.

Above the broken set of dreams, now in this I looked inside your heart.
One look into your face seen lies.
And I feel today that this is the end, this is my last breath of your own air,
I felt your heart clench around my fist.
This my sweet is death.

And my love, there's to pain [repeat]
