Where were you!
When I needed you! [repeat]

Time and time again, I see you slide your way through life so make things harder on yourself.

This is a test of what you've become,
all that I ask of you is your blood in arms,
this is a test of what you've become.

It's time to set this off!
To set this straight.
Where were you!
When I needed you! [repeat]
