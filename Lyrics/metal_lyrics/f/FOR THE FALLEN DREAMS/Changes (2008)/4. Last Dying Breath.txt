To see your fucking face, with the guilt inside us.
Try your best but I'll take it, this anymore.
These are desperate times get it right.

You can get off your knees,
This will not be done here.
Tell this to my face.
Your best way.

To see your fucking face, with the guilt inside us.
Try your best
This is dominate.
There are desperate times get it right.

Will I try to buy your love.
I'm getting friendless, back to the end.
Shadows of guilt run through, this time it's better than the last.
Guilt from your face,
This is wanted to the end there's a smile in me

My last dying breath I'd bleed for you.
My last dying breath I'd die for you.
