And I'm thankful for everything I have.
I'll make you proud never take this for granted.
Sticking to my side, before your judgement of me.

Pushing through, all the bullshit to make me happy.
I found faith in myself and I will always remember, your intentions.
Come on.
I'll never think that again, above everything else. [x2]
And I'm thankful for everything I have I'll make you proud won't forget this.

Now inside, now inside me.
Again
Now inside, now inside me.
I'll keep all these memories till my ending [x4]

Now inside, now inside inside you.
Again.
Now inside, now inside me.
