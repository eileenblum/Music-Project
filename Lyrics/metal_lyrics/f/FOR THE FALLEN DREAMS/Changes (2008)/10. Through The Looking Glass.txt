I push myself everyday, I push myself
I look to you everyday, I look to you
Now through this looking glass, it is time to set this right
Looking back on everything I have times have changed, seasons pass,
everyday I'm making things ok for myself
It's time to see what's at the end of the road
It's dark outside, and the feeling confidence is leaving my side
How could you hold on, to this fucking lie, the damage done [x4]
How much time will this take, it's so unforgiving
What will it take to forget this, tis changing nothing
How much time will this take, it's so unforgiving
What will it take to forget this, time is changing, time is changing nothing
Were going back and forth, and I'm starting to think that I'm just
wasting my time
Where do I go from here, this void in my life [repeat]
Where do I go from here, I need something more [repeat]

Thanks to tobias for sending track #10 lyrics.
