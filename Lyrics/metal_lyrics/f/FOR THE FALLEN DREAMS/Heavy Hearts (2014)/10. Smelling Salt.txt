[feat. Landon Tewers]This is what I need to say to keep to myself from watching you walk away, and the clock is ticking.
Five years fast forward, its not going to be the same it'll never be the same, I don't want to lose my way.
I am the maker of my future, I am the reason you cant sleep at night.
I am the reason you are so confused.
We're taking steps to the right.
We're losing light.
This is what I need to say to keep myself from watching you walk away.
And the clock is ticking, we only get one chance to make this right.
This is what I need to say to keep to myself from watching you walk away, and the clock is ticking.
Five years fast forward, its not going to be the same it'll never be the same, I don't want to lose my way.
I am the reason.
I am the reason.
I won't watch us die.
I am the reason.
I am the reason.
I don't want to see us die.
Move out of my way.
I'm leaning back on the edge of the wall.
The only that's stopping me is my own reflection, so get the fuck out of my way.
I'm my own worst enemy, the only thing that's stopping is my own reflection.
We won't be the same, I don't want to lose my way.
