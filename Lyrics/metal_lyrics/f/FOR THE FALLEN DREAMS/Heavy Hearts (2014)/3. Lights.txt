I never thought I'd see the light leave your eyes.
Never got the chance to say good bye.
I wish I were there to change the things that happened that night.
I never got the chance to say good bye.
I'd give anything and change the world to see you one last time.

You lived your life with no regrets.
You were my brother, and you'll always be a friend to me.
Do you remember all the nights where we would laugh til the sun came up?
I'll never forget that, and I'll never forget you.
Now who will take your place, nobody can replace what a friend you were to me.
I just feel empty, without the light that you brought into our houses.

I never thought I'd see the light leave your eyes.
Never got the chance to say good bye.
I wish I were there to change the things that happened that night.
I never got the chance to say good bye.
I'd give anything and change the world to see you one last time.

You wouldn't have wanted to leave any other way but black and white.
I will never forget.
You were a brother, and you were always a friend to me.
Do you remember all the nights where we would laugh til the sun came up?
I'll never forget that.
I'll never forget you.
Now who will take your place, nobody can replace what a friend you were to me.
I just feel empty without the light that you brought into our lives
