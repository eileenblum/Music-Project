Do you think with all of the madness that's been going on that I've forgot about you?
Among the business and success, I still find the time to think about what a pathetic rat you are.
(There's not a thing you can do)
Let me catch you slipping, let me catch you letting down your guard.
Still after all these years, I want to put you in the ground.

You fucking punk, you brought this all on yourself.
Stand up and face me like a man.
Anybody can hide behind a computer screen, what is your life worth to me?
I give and I've gave and tried to be a better man.
Well now that time is over.
It's my turn to even the odds, and if I see you around I'm going to make you eat every fucking word, you coward.
How many years has it been since you started this little feud with no results?
It's all wretch and no vomit.
It's all wretch and no vomit.
Who the fuck are you to walk around with your head held high like you're somebody?
Cause bitch you're nobody.
You aren't about to do a god damn thing because you never have and you never will.

I still find the time to think about what a pathetic rat you are.
(There's not a thing you can do)
Let me catch you slipping, let me catch you letting down your guard.
Still after all these years you don't know when to shut your mouth.

How does it feel to be completely helpless, and there's not a thing you can do about it?
Take me back to my younger years.
I'll teach you a lesson about respect.
If I knew right then, what I know right now, you wouldn't have got a single word out of your mouth.
So why so quiet the past few years?
Now you walk around with your tail between you legs, like a mother fucking dog.
I give and I've gave and tried to be a better man.
Well now that time is over.
It's my turn to even the odds, and if I see you around I'm going to make you eat every fucking word, you coward.
