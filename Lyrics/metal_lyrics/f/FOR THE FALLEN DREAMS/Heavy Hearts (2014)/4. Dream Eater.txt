[feat. Garret Rapp]And so the story begins of where I started my life, I made the best decisions molded on the way I survive.
And as the years go by I'm tested what I will be.
Will I stand the test of time, or will it make a better man of me.
I know what kind of man I can be, I've let the simple things pass by and never let it get the best of me.
There's so many things I have seen and its never taken a piece from me.
Live life, find happiness and never look back on the life you were meant to lead.
Never look back.
I never wanted to live like this.
I never wanted to live this life alone.
I've made a path that I'll never forget.
Times are getting darker, because there's so much to do and there's so little time to right the wrongs.
This is the life that I was meant to live.
There's not a thing I would change.
I'm vindicated and I swear I will make this worth my time.
And so the story continues I'm aware of what I've done, to many simple things have soiled all the things I believe.
And as the years go by I'm tested what I will be, will I stand the test of time or ill it make a better man of me.
This is who I am.
I didn't choose this, I was chose.
Never look back.
I never wanted to live like this.
I never wanted to live this life alone.
I've made a path that I'll never forget.
