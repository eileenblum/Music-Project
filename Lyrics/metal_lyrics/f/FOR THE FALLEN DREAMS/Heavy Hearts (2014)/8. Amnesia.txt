Who would have thought that 5 years later, I'd be back at it again.
Starting right where I left off, from when I was just a kid.
This is where I got my start, and where my life began to change.
Now that I'm back in this business I'll make sure you remember my name.
I knew where I was going, just didn't know it would be this far.

Life is strange, you never know when it will take that turn.
Life is strange, you better be ready for anything.
I made the best out of every situation, never let the odds stack against me.
I did what ever I had to make this happen for me and my family.
And I'll never take it back.
So give me your best shot.
And make sure you dont miss it.
The road to the top is all part of burning bridges.
This band has come so far, and we've barely scratched the surface.
We are here to stay and haven't even started.
