Fight for your life.
What are you waiting for?
How many times do I have to tell you
that you're not who you say you are?
How many times do I have to tell you
that you're just in my fucking way?
Turn the page,
and the uplift the masses we've done it over and over again.
Make the waves,
and control your path with the name that you've made for yourself.
Whats the point in asking
never fucking standing on your own two feet again.
We are the product of a hopeless world.
We are the future of the youth gone wrong.
Make your way, make your name.
What makes you tick what makes you live.
Nothing can stop you when you put you mind,
to what you want to make in this life.
Poison your mind.
Live in the moment, and swing for the fences.
The time to control it is here and now.
Fight for your passion,
and don't ever stop til you're at the top of your mountain.
We are the product of a hopeless world.
We are future of the youth gone wrong.
Make your way, make your name.
What makes you tick what makes you live.
Nobody can stop you when you put you mind to what you want to make in this life. Make your way, make your name.
What makes you tick what makes you live Fight for your life.
