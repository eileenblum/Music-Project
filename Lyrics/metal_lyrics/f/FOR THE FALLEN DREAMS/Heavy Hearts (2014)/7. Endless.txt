Taking a look at myself and all I see is an empty man. 
With nothing to do and nothing to lose. 
The weight of the world seems so much stronger. 
When your faced with the truth of living with yourself 
For the hate, for hate you've made.

I was an empty man, you saved me from myself (I'll never be the same again)
I was an empty man, until you came into my life(I'll never be the same again)

And the feelings so strong, that I can barely stand it. 
You mean more to me than words can express or you could ever imagine. 
I just want us to live forever. 

I was an empty man, you saved me from myself (I'll never be the same again)
I was an empty man, until you came into my life (I'll never be the same again)
