I am terrified of life, without all of you.
You have defined who I am and what's inside and what I am made of.
I know you've been pushed off to the side.
Just hold on for one more night, I'll make things right, I'll make this right.
I'm looking back on all the things I've left behind.
The years are flying by and everyday I'm reminded of all that you should have.
Things won't be the same, they won't be the same until you're back in my loving arms.

This life doesnt mean anything without you.
I'll give up it all for you.
The more I try to remember what this life is meant to be.
I can't lose sight of the things I need to fulfull my dreams.
To fulfill my dreams.

I am terrified of life, without all of you.
You have defined who I am and what's inside and what I am made of.
I know you've been pushed off to the side.
Just hold on for one more night, I'll make things right, I'll make this right.
When I lose all of my grip on reality you will always pull me back to my feet.
Things won't be the same, they won't be the same until you're back in my loving arms.
