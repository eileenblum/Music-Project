I watched my life flash before my eyes.
I'm not ready to leave this world.
Call it what you will, say what you will.

Unfinished business.
The will to survive and get the most out of my life.
I'm on top of the world.
This is, this is your one and only life.

I never thought I'd see your face again.
I never thought I'd live to see another day.
Never take your life for granted.
You only get one fucking chance.

Unfinished business.
The will to survive and get the most out of my life.
I'm on top of the world.
This is, this is your one and only and life.

Running about and cunning about.
Trying to make up for all of the time I've spent sleeping.
I can't believe how much I've been missing.
I can't believe how much I've been missing.
Wrap your mind around something greater.
Wrap your arms, wrap arms around ones you love.
The ones you love.
It can all be taken away.
In just an instant.
You can lose it all.
In just a second you can lose it all.
In just a second's time.
A second's time.
