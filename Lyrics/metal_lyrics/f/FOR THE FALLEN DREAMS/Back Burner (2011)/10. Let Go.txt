Let go of everything. Let go of everything.
When will you learn your lesson Repeating everything.
Don't come around here, or repeat what you've seen.
Keep my name out of your mouth... Out of your mouth.
If you swear to god again, I swear I'll lose my fucking mind.
I want you to learn your lesson. Lesson!
When hoping gets you so far, all the hate and scars still stand in my way.
All I ask of you is to always stay true and listen to what I have to say.
I have something I need to say to you. I am fueled by hate. I am fueled by
hate. This life I live is fueled by hate.
