When everything... When everything is falling down around you and you don't
know what to do...
We can make it clearer, if you make this sincere.
Pick up the pieces of your broken mirror.
Forging your skin with a broken knife won't make things clear within your life.
ive this a chance. Give it all you got. We've been given a chance.
Give it all you got and don't give in. Don't give up and don't pretend.
I hope you'll never take steps backwards.
All I hear is you want to move on with your life.
All I wana do is move along now, so move along now.
You need to move forward with your life.
