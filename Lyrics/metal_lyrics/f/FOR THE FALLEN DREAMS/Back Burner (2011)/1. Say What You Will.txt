Please go on with what you have said. I'm not... I'm not listening.
Is it that easy to lie in your head Please stop... please stop pretending.
You'll always ask yourself... Am I dead, am I dead, am I dead
Don't try and fight it off... In your head, in your head, in your head.
And when it comes down to it, try and prove it. Try and Prove it
Try and prove yourself.
It's all in your fucking head. It's all in your head.
