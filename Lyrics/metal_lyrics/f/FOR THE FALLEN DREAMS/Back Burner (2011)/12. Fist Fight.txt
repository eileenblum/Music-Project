Fight, fight, fight, fight for what is right. It's not my fault that I'm like
flies to a light.
I've said it before. I'll say it tonight. I'll break your neck, jaw, teeth in a
fight.
Don't temp me, I know that I'm right. I'll never let you bitch out, or our of
my site.
It's not unheard that I stand by my word by giving you everything that you
deserve.
I will give you everything that you deserve.
You don't deserve anything you don't deserve.
I will show you what I think of you. I'll bury you underground. I'll bury you
underground.
Give up. Give in. I'm ready to win.
I'll wipe that shit-eating grin right off your face until the day.
I will make it know that it's not okay.
Fight, fight, fight, fight for what is right. Ya gotta fight, fight, fight for
what is right.
You don't deserve anything.
Fight, fight, fight for what is right. Ya gotta fight, fight, fi
