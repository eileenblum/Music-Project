Go. Stop holding things in just to build frustration. Complicate the siutation.
Got my ticket, packed my bags for the station. Complicate the situation.
Situation. I should wrap my hands around your neck.
Won't forget the disgusting things you've said...
Taped and zipped up in a body bag... By then I'll pray that you're already
dead.
I'll pray for your death. I'll pray for your death.
Go ahead and look around at all the things that bring you down.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! You can't even save yourself.
Go ahead and keep it up.
Let's pretend this is all you know when no one truly gives a fuck
about your life, or your so-called goals.
Let's keep this fire from going out. Crucify her!!! Live life stress-free, no
doubts.
It's too early to tell... I hope you burn in hell. If i had it my way, I'd
say...
Only time will tell. If I had it my way, you'd burn in hell.
For all the things that you will never be, breathe it in. Breathe it out.
You'll fake it.
I know that you can't take this, Bet says that you won't make it.
For all the lies that you have fed me...
In my head, it drives me crazy knowing that you may survive.
Why can't I live my life. Only time will tell.
