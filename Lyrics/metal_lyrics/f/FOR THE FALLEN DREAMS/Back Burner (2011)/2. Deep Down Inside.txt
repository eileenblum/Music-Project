Deep down inside, reach down and find what you're looking for.
Keep this in mind...
Don't drag your heels and feel down while you look for more.
Every now and then you will feel the weight of the world on yout shoulders.
Turn it around. Stand up off the ground.
Stand up off the ground. The more you want it, the more you'll have it
What you have found Reach down inside. Reach down inside
Reach down inside. I hope you find what you're looking for.
Deep down inside, I want this for you... Depends if you want it more.
Deep down inside, how bad do you want this.
