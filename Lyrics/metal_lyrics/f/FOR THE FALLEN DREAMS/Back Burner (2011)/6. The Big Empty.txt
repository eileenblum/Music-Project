What brings me back, I don't know! I need to grow and I need to go.
I need some space. I need to erase all the thoughts of you that were put in
this place.
All the things that are now dead and gone, for all the things that I should
have done...
Needless to say, you got in the way. I regret everything about you until this
day.
I've driven down this road a thousand times before.
Do you know what it takes to bring me to your door!
When it's all said and done... I will know for sure,
what it takes to forget the fact that I want more.
Hey, hey, hey what do you say It's not me and it's not the same.
Don't go and throw it away. You did it yourself and you did it today.
What if I said I'm not to blame I don't care if you think I'm the same.
What if I said I'm ready to go I'll never say again that I told you so. I will
not say I told you so.
Now it's all said and done. You'll never admit that you've had your fun.
What's your deal and what are you on You're too fucking stubborn.
to admit when you're wrong. It's not okay and it's not the same.
All your friends and foes have put you to shame
Every now and then it seems you're losing your game.
Losing your grip. Losing your game.
