Now you've finally realized what it feels like to be alone, but you'll truly
never know.
Always rolling, tossing and turning. Fighting off the demons you have long
been yearning for. No need to apologize, but I feel you'll never realize.
You will never realize.
I haven't had much to explain, but you have always seemed to remind me of
all these issues we have had back burning.
Always yelling, talking and turning. It seems so hard when you're always
searching
for another exit or a way out, one like that of an open door.
Now you've finally realized what it feels to be alone, but you'll truly never
know.
Always rolling, tossing and turning. Fighting off the demons you have long
been yearning for. No need to apologizem but I feel you'll never realize.
You'll never realize.
Let these walls crash down. Build them back up. Show what you're made of.
