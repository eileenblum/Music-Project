Don't jump the gun. We'll find a way out, find a way out.
When was I wrong in admitting what I've done.
What have I done? What have I done?
It's over again. We always make the same mistakes.
It's over again. We go over, and over, and over and over again.
I got the point written in black ink. It's not over until we've started to sink
and when it comes time... You've always failed me. You always failed me.
Throw my hands up in the air, but I'll never be okay.
Every nerve in my body hurts. I'll never be okay.
Open these arms. Let me in. Get on your knees
Let me believe you'll never do this again. Again.
