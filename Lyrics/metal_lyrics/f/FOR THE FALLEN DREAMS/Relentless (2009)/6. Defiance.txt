Never coming back is this what I deserve.
Found in the flood.
Drowning in mud.
Washing away all the things in my life.
Manipulating, and separating.
Is this what you will do from the things that you choose.
From the things that you lose,
nothing ever happens to you.
If I had said to your face, your fucking face,
your cowardly face...bow down.
All this time, you've made nothing of yourself.
For what it's worth having said this before,
Your loosing from choosing with no remorse.
The things you say along
the way will help resent your destiny.
Is this what you will do from the things you choose,
From the things that you lose,
nothing ever happens to you...
You said this to my face, my fucking face.
You choose to ignore the things I say.
What I say...if I had said to your face.
Your disgrace.
