You'll blame yourself for this
Looking back on what once was, we don't exist
Not knowing if everything will be just fine
Will everything be alright
I won't fear tonight
For we will rid ourselves from all of this
And tear our thoughts limb from limb
A nightmare reaction
(There's nothing left of this)
A feeling you can't resist
The times you spent sleeping
Are more or less just a daydream

And when you find yourself at ease
You never will be (you never will be)
And when you find yourself at ease
You never will be
The times you spent sleeping
Are more or less just a daydream

You blame yourself for this
Looking back on what once was
You blame yourself for this
We don't exist

I won't let this go
For some things you will never know
This is who I am (who I am)
You will never know

And when you find yourself at ease
You never will be (you never will be)
And when you find yourself at ease
You never will be
The times you spent sleeping
Are more or less just a daydream

I won't let this go
