Your whole world has been torn apart from the start.
Your whole world, your whole world...

You're in my heart and in my head.
(...in my head)
A plethora of things that need to be said.
(...needs to be said)
Does it make it alright to wish that you're dead?
(...wish that you're dead)
I feel it's unsaid. Feelings unsaid.
(...feelings unsaid)

No one would care, no one would risk a thing for you.
This is swear, my dear, I fear it's true.
No one would care, no one would risk a thing for you.

No one would care, no one would risk a thing for you.
(...no one cares)
No one would care, no one would risk a thing for you.
(...no one cares for...)

...You.
Your whole world has been torn apart from the start.
Your whole world, your whole world...

You're in my heart and in my head.
(...in my head)
A plethora of things that need to be said.
(...needs to be said)
Does it make it alright to wish that you're dead?
(...wish that you're dead)
I feel it's unsaid. Feelings unsaid.
(...feelings unsaid)

Go.

I can see and feel it again, it's taking me away.
I don't know what else to say, but I know have said.
I can see and feel it again, I can see and feel it again.
I can see and feel it again, it's taking me away.
I can see and feel it again, I can see and feel it again
I can see and feel it again...
