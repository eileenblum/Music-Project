This is the end for now I pray.
Bring it back then take it all away.
My feelings are now on the line.
I haven't felt so far behind.
She lead my ghost to shallow water.
Nothing but respect, only with respect.
As I lay with regret, nothing but regret so I repent.
Every now and then I take a look at all the pictures
That you've sent me and all the letters.
Hoping your better.
Before I regret you'll never remember me, remember...
You will never be the same.
Every now and then I take a look at all the pictures
That you've sent me and all the letters.
Hoping your better.
Before I regret this will never be.
Will you remember me.
