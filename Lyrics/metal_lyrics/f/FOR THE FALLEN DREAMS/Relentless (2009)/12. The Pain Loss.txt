When you left behind all the selfish things that you loved,
You made the pain go away for the time-being.
For the time-being.

I'll make for sure I count the days of when
You'll be leaving from this earth.
I'll make for sure I count the days of when
You'll be leaving from this pain.
There's one thing you should know about me,
And if you decide to go then leave.
There's one thing you should know about me,
And if you decide to leave then go.

You cry yourself to sleep when
You think no one's watching you,
And you have no reaction, no pain, no loss.
You make for sure no one's laughing.
You make for sure.
You make for sure no one's laughing.
One thing's for sure.
I still have a fight in me.

All the selfish things you loved were all left behind.
So hold your head up high, and show yourself
What it means to be alive.
Show yourself what it truly means not to be alone.
Truly means
