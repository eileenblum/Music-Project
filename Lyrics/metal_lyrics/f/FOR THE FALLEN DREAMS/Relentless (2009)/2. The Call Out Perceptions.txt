Breathing in and out as they point to the man, as he lays a gun in his hand.
Looking through the window at him, no sign of breathing. Breathing.
Running around, I'm running around again. Back and forth, back and forth,
I'm breathing. In and out, in and out again, and again.
Running around, I'm running around again. Back and forth, back and forth,
I'm breathing. Breathing.
...And in this dream I had of you, if I could say one thing to you.
Our dreams won't die. They'll never go away.
I find myself reaching backwards for him. No sign of breathing.
Looking through the window at him, at him.
For the promises you've made, and all the lies you've portrayed,
Forever in those eyes...
Hopefully you will find what your looking for and maybe someday you can realize that the pain only holds so deep.
In this moment, in this day we will hopefully find underneath all the lies and somehow find our way, and somehow find our way...
Our dreams won't die
