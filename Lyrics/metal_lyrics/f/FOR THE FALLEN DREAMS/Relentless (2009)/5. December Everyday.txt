Recognize the lights set in front of your demon's eyes
And the path that we've paved.
Realize that the only thing standing between you and me
Is the tomb and the grave.
We will rot as the sun comes up.
We will rot as the sun comes over the...
As it's time, dig the grave,

In this phase of you and me

That separates us from the outside...
Recognize the lights set in front of your demon's eyes
And the path that we've paved.
Realize that the only thing standing between you and me
Is the tomb and the grave.
