Make something of yourself or search for someone else who makes you feel real.
Whoever thought that I could feel like this.
Pull back your mask and show us all who you really are.
How can you live like this, pretending everythings fine.
It's not alright. Your not alright. Find yourself.

So this is what we've come to.
Life is what you make of it.
So find something to hold on to.
I've practically gave up on this.

How can someone feel like this is the end.
Don't hold your breath in my life.
Tell yourself. Ask yourself. Am I alright.
Sinking, flailing, and fighting for air doesn't mean your alone.
There is someone else out there who will pull you down.

How can you live with yourself.

So this is what we've come to.
Life is what you make of it.
So find something to hold on to.
I've practically gave up on this.

I have run from myself. Mirrors show nothing but somebody else.

Life is what you make of it.

Life.
