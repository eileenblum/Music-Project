Fool me once, you'll never fool me again
I'll never give you my hand
You're not even a friend
Let's not pretend that I'll let you in
No, not ever again
No, not again
All your friendships have met their ends
I'm never crawling back again
No, not again
This is the end

Out of sight, and out of mind; the only way that I can get by
No more crawling back to you this time
No, not this time
I need somewhere to run and hide
I need something to pass the time to get you off my mind
No response to your calls next time

Drop this subject

All your friends have gone away
Nothing good ever stays the same
You're fake as fuck
Stop pretending

Stop pretending that your friendships aren't ending
