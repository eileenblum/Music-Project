Waking up alone is all you do,
The only friend that's left is gone,
There's no one there to comfort you,
It's been some years since we've last spoke,
It's hard to come to terms I know,
Last I heard you weren't doing so good,
Why do you do less to the ones you say you love?
We all know the truth,
The only one you truly love is you,
I hope you heard now that you have no one left [x4],
I finally know the truth,
The one that hurts is you.
