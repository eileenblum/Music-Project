Arguing In circles Is all we ever do
You say we wouldn't be together If It weren't for you
Well, It's not for you I'm trying to let myself breathe
I'm done feeling misused
Release this grip you have on me
Let me free
Just let me free
Pick and choose what you're trying to prove
You're too stubborn to be refused
I will not take the verbal abuse I will not be damaged, or bruised

Here we go again
It's the same old thing
It's all been done before I wanna be happy
I wanna be free but It's hard to leave when this Is comfortable to me we go
Around, and around again
There's nothing left to say
These problems never go away you've recreated situations In your head that
Have never happened
For the sake of us, believe
Why does this happen time, and time again
It makes me cringe
Same old langsyne put aside all of your problems (your problems)
I don't care how you solve them
You solve them
And I can't stop you...
For the sake of us believe, yeah from feelings how you do
Push aside all your problems
Don't throw me with them
I will not be your resolution when dealing with my own problems how will I
Resolve them when I'm dealing with yours too
You've forced me to leave!
