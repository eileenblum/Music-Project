Take a step back
I'm not the one you're fighting here
When will you realize there's nothing left to fear
Put your fists down
I'll show you how to settle this
Don't run it through the fucking ground every chance you get

I'm glad you see where I'm coming from
I'm not trying to break you down
I should have said this before now, but I never knew how

It's all in the way you use it
I'm not sorry for all the things I've said
I don't regret the things I've done

There's no remorse for a life poorly unsung

Take a step
Take a step back
I'm not the one that you are fighting here
When will you
When will you realize there's nothing left to fear
Put your fists down
I'll show you how to settle this
Don't run it through the fucking ground every chance you get

Don't say another word

Step it up
