Don't blame this on me
I'm right where you wanna be
All your dreams are slowly fading
With every single choice you're making

I gotta get up, I gotta get up if love is this
Then don't waste your charm
Forever-ever I need to know.
Coming running back to you

Won't forget the sign, I won't forget the sign.
Forever here you put me through.
Forever everyday a lie.
When its comin' back to haunt you.

Don't blame this on me.
I'm right where you wanna be
All your dreams are slowly fading.
With every single choice you're making

Is it lust or is it love
Its in your sheets but it
Is not enough
Whichever way you go, I don't wanna know
(Hey hey!)
You've never been so low
And it really shows

For always and ever we'll live with endeavors
You'll seem to fail somehow, fail somehow,
You'll never break me, 
you've only made me into who I am now, who am I now,
Just blame it on me
So I can live my life freely

Don't blame this on me
I'm right where you wanna be
All your dreams are slowing fading
With every single trace you're making
is it lust or is it love it's in your sheet but its not enough
Whichever way you go I don't wanna know
(Hey hey!)
You've never been so low and it really shows

Don't blame this on me
I'm right where you wanna be
And your dreams are slowly fading
With every single choice you're making
Is it love or is it love
Its in your sheets but not enough.
Whichever way you go I don't wanna know.
(Hey hey!)
You've never been so low and it really shows.
