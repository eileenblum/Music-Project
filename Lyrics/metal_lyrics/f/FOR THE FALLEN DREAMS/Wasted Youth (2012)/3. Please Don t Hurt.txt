Don't take these words from my mouth only to twist them around, all the
Things I've done by now have only been for your own good
If I'm gone by now, don't find me I left this town with everything behind me
All I wanted was to make you happy, or was that what I wanted for me, every
Wrong answer you've searched for
Every open door you've Ignored
Every time you let yourself bleed you wonder what you're fighting for
So tell me what you're fighting for
Tell me what you re fighting for, I've said this before, and I'll say It
Again
You've looked In the mirror
You've made no amends with yourself, or anyone else lost and lonely again
With no one's help
Pull yourself together Is all I have to say
It's black and white
You're always right
Don't throw It all away
Take my hand, not your life
I know you're not okay so don't say you're okay, Is this how you want
Things to be
I can see It In your eyes
I can see you're hurt
It's always In your eyes
Always In your eyes, you're falling down again
He'll pick you back up
You'll pull him back In
You're pulling me down again
I will not save you.
