Resentment is all I ever had
Don't forgive me
For being the person I am
Hopelessness
Is what has become of this
I'll walk away
It won't faze me
Don't ask for my thoughts again
The rebirth of us did not exist
The part you missed in my eyes
Her birth did not exist
Give me my life back
Invent me a cure
Erase all my memories
And my unborn
What is this life for
Because when it rains it pours
They always say it's calm after the storm
I'm the unborn,
Not the child I ignored
I have been torn a dozen times before
It's bittersweet and all I want is the cure for something pure
Is this my curse?
Is this my curse?
It's not a curse
It's a blessing
You're too blind to see any meaning
You're too fucked to see
What it's done to me
Take everything
Give me my life back
Give me my life back
What is this life for
Because when it rains it pours
They always say it's calm after the storm
I'm the unborn,
Not the child I ignored
I have been torn a dozen times before
It's bittersweet and all I want is the cure for something pure
What is this life for
Because when it rains it pours
They always say it's calm after the storm
I'm the unborn,
Not the child I ignored
I have been torn a dozen times before
It's bittersweet and all I want is the cure for something pure
