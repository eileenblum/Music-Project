Tell me what's wrong, and why you're feeling this way
Don't hold It all in, you know that's never okay
Don't hold it all back
Say what you've needed to say
Don't be ashamed, I feel the same way I've been through it all at lease,
That's what I think
I'll teach you to float
I won't leave you to sink
I'll show you the way you will be okay someday
Drink the bottle down
Won't fill you up
You'll only feel more hollow
Do you think you'll feel better now it only gets harder with every gulp you?
Sallow
One day you'll go Insane
Lose your path
Push everyone out of your way
Pushing all the pain away
Push all the pain
Block everyone out, and everything they say
Stop pushing away all the pain.
