You better hope I never find out what really went down
Your guilty conscience made you leave this town
I probably won't ever find out
Does your conscience eat at you?
I hope it eats at you

Memories forgotten inside my head
Never felt so good to kill off a thought before
All I wanted was to finally confide in you
All I wanted was to find the whole damn truth
Finally letting go
Finally moving on
I'd like to find the truth, that's why I wrote this song
Please don't tell me what's right from wrong
You've never been concerned with what you've done

I've never been concerned with what you've done until you did me wrong
I asked a question
I want an answer
I know you know where I stand here
I never thought I had to write this fucking song
To get the answers to the questions I've asked for so long
Your whole life has come unglued
