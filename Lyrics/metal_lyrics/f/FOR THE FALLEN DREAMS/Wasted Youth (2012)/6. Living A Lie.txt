Don't take this the wrong way I feel like I'm drowning
Surrounded by takers in a world overcrownded
Surrounded by liars don't get me started
Let's see who gets further, half, or wholehearted

Don't take this for granted I know this is subjective
Take what's been handed, roll with the punches
Let's see who's left standing, or what could be mended
If life is a joke, I won't be offended

[Chorus:]
Trust me when I say that this is not the way
It's not the way
I've done all my time for all of your crimes
It's not in the rhymes I write after line
It's in the lies you've lied time, after time

I feel sick to my stomach for all these lines that have been written
I feel sick to my stomach for all the lies that have been given
In my defense, can you see what I'm up against
I want more
Never laid to rest until this all makes sense
In my head, in my thoughts everything has a cost

[Chorus:]
Trust me when I say that this is not the way
It's not the way
I've done all my time for all of your crimes
It's not in the rhymes I write after line
It's in the lies you've lied time, after time

All of this time, we've been living a lie
In your defense, might as well be laid to rest
Nothing more, nothing less
Doesn't matter if it even makes sense in your head
All this time, we've been living a lie
