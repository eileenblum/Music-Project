servility to perpetual youth 
has fixed me to the plot I age on 
the bitter tincture of neglect 
plays about my tongue and eases, 
sighing music, down my throat 
to blight the sediment 
a record of my failures 

let malnourishment serve as your sustenance 
raise flares to the dwellings of equivocation 
may impermanence temper your suffering 
your sibilant manifold questioning 
and your pointed fear of a textbook senescence 
parceling out monotonies bent and arthritic 
waning baleful in the attics of decline 

shaped by the efforts of coercion 
bound helpless by the tethers of duress 
gilded with lack to frame your body 
dousing the kindling of the coming years 

near-forgotten 
our histories sprawling out behind us 
seconds birthing minutes became decades 
dusks new and unfamiliar sprang upon us 
we hung our heads and pretended 
there was never expectation 
there was nothing to corrode 

a flag in a sea of marble 
a dream is an empty stomach 
a flag in a sea of marble 
a dream is a drowning child
