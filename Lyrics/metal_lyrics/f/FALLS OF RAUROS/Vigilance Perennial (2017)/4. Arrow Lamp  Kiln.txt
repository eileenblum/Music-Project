no dream was blooming 
when our backs arced beneath the dread 
of another day lost 
of us growing apart 
screening ourselves from each other 
our hearts become riven 

I have attempted to shadow the trajectories 
sound the depth of uncertainties 
filtering loss through the apertures 
to refract it with mirrors 

I am seized with violence by a lust for renewal 
tending furies left unfostered 
padding across the cellars of my first years 
burying masks which seek the surface 
holding vigil in the wake of exertion 
dictating missives wholly unfocused 
and confessions wholly dissembled 

belief is close kin to avarice 
wending its way to a crest 
exposed and precarious 

yet we keep our beacon marked by signal fire 
nursing an open flame, fed with an equal breath 
it thus remains standing in thrall to its footing 
sworn to a vigilance perennial 
unsteady hand wielding a final arrow 
specious unbroken will 
self-doubt fingering the seams 
bewailing our impermanence
