like all beings pacing corridors 
trailing the ghosts of their deeds 
heads downcast and hands raised 
for their eyes refuse belief in 
leaving an arid shelter 
for centuries of rains 
to dance upon them 

I am as them, spurning history, I've discovered 
while awareness grows bleary and indistinct 
scouting fissures by inference of mark-bereft fingertips 
hunted by thirst 

and shiver still the masses of stone that enclose them 
tasked to contain a murmur thatâs soon to be 
echoing with unspeakable clarity 
keening its curse to the open 

I remain with those spurning history, I've acknowledged 
while awareness grows bleary and indistinct 
scouting fissures by inference of mark-bereft fingertips 
hunted by thirst 

every hopeless struggle 
every flightless endeavor 
everything kept at arm's length 
this labyrinth unfolding echoes
