standing vigilant by the gate of the first mask 
our hands they now creak from misuse, harden to leather 
we wait, with hope we can stand guard forever 
it's a weight that we share 
this mask is not meant to be buried 

nurture and consummate 
pronounced with a trembling inflection 
learning how the earth reclaims what it yields us 
sunken-chested we brandish our offering 
and admit that we haven't been living or breathing 
only striving swollen-hearted 

silent, blank tomb of white granite 
stark in its patience 
beckons for the mask 
with which we hold concealed 
the aging of our visage 
fleeing still its mirror 

sculpting frail clays of a tired love 
whose lungs have collapsed 
to languish in the breast of a spent kiln 
it's a weight that we share 
this mask is not meant to be buried
