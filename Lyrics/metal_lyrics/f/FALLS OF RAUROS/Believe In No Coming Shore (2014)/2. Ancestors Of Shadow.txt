They will wake to the sound of shattering glass
in the crux before dawn
and will not have dreamt it

How could they know what the night will hold?
They've slept through that dark
and they will again
Nurturing dreams for the covetous
While we could not sleep at all

All of us
helpless
will have to
find in each other distraction and tempering
lest we now fail as they failed

But I don't foresee that
because you've strength in you
carelessly misused
and blindly, tragically misplaced
and though your eyes drifted
they have not lost sight of our fixture
