Hoping that a slow death will wait for those
shielding their pale eyes from injury
Who would sacrifice limbs
for a shallow breath
hands trembling
I have seen you with confidence
lower your head with a purpose
and surety
but I knew you were elsewhere
pensively building a tomb for those you love

Your frail heart is wavering
Your exits narrowing
For what are you waiting?
Belief alone cannot sustain us

Believe in no coming shore
for we'll cross this sea and the sea then beside it
Navigate leagues of clamorous waters and lightning
Smoke hovering so low it becomes us;
we've all been betrayed

Believe in no nearing shore
No vessel could weather these sprawling expanses
Fire so black even the night has affirmed it
We've all been betrayed
We have all been
betrayed

Sight it was taken
Eyes they were left now to gaze;
gaze upon darkness enveloping
Vaguely perceiving oblique shapes in drift
and the silent conversing
of all wandering ghosts

Still your hands; they are trembling
Your weakening clutch is now forfeit;
forfeit to violence
It seems they'll forever be cursed to remain
empty yet grasping
Nothing to hold
Nothing is held
