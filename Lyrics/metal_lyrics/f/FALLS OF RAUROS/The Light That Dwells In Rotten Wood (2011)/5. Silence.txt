Wandering ever further.
Gathering momentum unrestrained.
There is no telling when we'll remember.
Or if we will at all..
Doomed to fall. Fall into darkness.
Fade into darkness.

Only a vague memory will then remain.
Embrace the absence of chaos
and the silence and the ruin that will follow.
Some say it was our destiny.

All that you love will perish
before your lifeless eyes.
You say you never saw it coming.
You say you'd have tried to stop it.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
I will not listen to a single fucking word.
Not a word. Not a word.
