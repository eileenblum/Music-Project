[performed by Falls of Rauros]We have thrived in
places not fit for life nor the living
We will carry on
bringing our curse where we wish
the death of significance
Worship oversight
Fabricate answers to volatile questions
Shelter your gains and show to them reverence
This is the world we preserve
This is how we would have it

I can not find any beauty
in our sightless ambitions
I am through with forgiveness
for our unseeing
I will not feel any sorrow
by the crumbling of towers
raised from the earth in arrogance
Cleaving the welkin
Piercing the heavens 

When we've choked our convictions
and we've acknowledged with certainty
that vacant and quickening darkness
living in all human hearts

When at last it's unbearable
and no contrivance can remedy
on that day you'll have to shed your old skin
take what you need and depart

I will leave this place
I will leave this harrowing place for another
I will not be returning

Alone now
in the purity of isolation
my breath a thin smoke on the air
Flickering shadows dance across my few belongings
May your only truths betray you
May your fires die
