[performed by Falls of Rauros]O light of day
descending flames
though night shall fall
the stars will grace us

And their gleaming will
illuminate the path
whichever we should take
A broken people can't mend
their wounds alone
Brilliant and sustaining
bathe us in your glow

For this soil gives
more than we shall ever give
We have chosen not to
And these roots know more
than we shall ever know
We have chosen not to
And the wind shall sweep away
the falsehoods
of our histories
