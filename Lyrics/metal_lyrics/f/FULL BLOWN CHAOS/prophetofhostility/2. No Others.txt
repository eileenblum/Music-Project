True till the end? You can never bring us down even as hard as you try. Talk your shit, spread your lies. In my friends I rely. Truth and honor, the ties that bind our way of life. Justified. Stand tall, be proud of who you are. It's not about unity, it's about integrity. No others, my brothers are what I hold true. Right or wrong they are there for me. My family. I won't fall, never again. My enemies, cast astray, bad blood washed away. My brothers, no others are what I hold true. My friends will forever by my family.
