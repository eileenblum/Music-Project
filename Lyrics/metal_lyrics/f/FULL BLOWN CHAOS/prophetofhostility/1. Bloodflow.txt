This life is not worth living, I can't keep fighting these thoughts, they consume every piece of my mind. My choice is made now it's time to die. My choice has been made, only I can control my own fate. Disregard every word that you plea, sit back and watch me bleed. This life is not worth living I can't keep fighting these thoughts, they consume every piece of my mind, my choice is made now it's time to die. To this world I'm done. No room for thoughts, no need for prayers. This blood will flow. If I was gone tomorrow, would anyone shed a tear?... Did I make a difference in any person's life?...Would I be missed?...Would anyone wonder why?...I've lived for far too long am I right or am I wrong? My sanity is put to the test, as my body lays to rest. Laid...down...to...rest laid down to rest. Wishing for a noose around my neck, razorblade in the palm of my hand. Staring down the drain of the sink. This blood will flow...flow...flow...this blood will flow.
