Is every word you say just another lie???...I won't believe in your bullshit cries. From the day we met you have had one intent, to see me suffer. Until you see me dead, our friendship is long in the past, we both knew it would end this fast. Left myself open for your attack. All that's left for me to do is turn my back. My suffering. For everytime I was ignored. inside my mind you explored, searching for my weakness to consume every last portion of my soul. Can you feel this torment, this sorrow, inside. Will you ever know the extent of the pain you inflicted upon me. My suffering, my suffering made me strong. Showed me the light at the end of the road.....N.Y.C
