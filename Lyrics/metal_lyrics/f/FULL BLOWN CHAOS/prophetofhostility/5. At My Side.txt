You can't question my pride, you can't doubt my loyalty. My friends are at my side until the day that I die. At my side, till the day that I die, at my side. Nothing you say or do will ever bring us down, stand side by side, can't question our pride. Hardcore, a way of life. Represent till the end. Dancing like there's no tomorrow is the message that we send. That's the message we send motherfuckers!!! Until the end. They're at my side until the day I die. The times have changed since we're young and afraid. Tables turned. We're on top, We won't, won't be stopped. You can't question my pride, my friends are at my side until the day I die.
