From below staring through my world on fire
Everything and everyone, all I have is gone
Fade away, come undone was never an option
From below fighting toward my resurrection

I'll tear down these walls you helped me build around myself
Reborn in stone, harder than ever
Rise up from the ashes, what are you waiting for
Born again a mountain, harder than before

Harder than ever, reborn in stone
Harder than ever, reborn in stone
Harder than ever, reborn in stone
Harder than ever, reborn in stone
Harder than ever, reborn in stone
