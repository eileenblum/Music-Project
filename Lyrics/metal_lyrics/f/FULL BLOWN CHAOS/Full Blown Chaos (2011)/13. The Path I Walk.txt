Been away for too long, the gravity at hand
Live with no regrets, I hope you understand
To the beat I am a slave, but it doesn't control me
I didn't choose this life, it fucking chose me

It's not easy being gone, I'm counting every mile
Coming home to you makes it all worthwhile
Knowing that you're there is all I needed
A phone call away when I feel defeated

The path I walk is a lonely road
When I close my eyes I'm already home

Been away for too long, the gravity at hand
Live with no regrets, I hope you understand

Not easy being gone, I'm counting every mile
Coming home to you makes it all worthwhile
Knowing that you're there is all I needed
A phone call away when I feel defeated

The path I walk is a lonely road
When I close my eyes, I'm home, I'm fucking home

To the beat I am a slave, but it doesn't control me
I didn't choose this life, it fucking chose me

I didn't choose this life, it fucking chose me
I didn't choose this life, it fucking chose me
I didn't choose this life, it fucking chose me
