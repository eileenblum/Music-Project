Here we go again, I should have known
Thought we made amends, pull you from your throne
Take a hammer to your face, that's what you deserve
Bled out in disgrace, where do you get the nerve

What's right, what's wrong was never your concern
This time you crossed the line, a lesson you must learn

What's right, what's wrong was never your concern
This time you crossed the line, a lesson you must learn
What's right, what's wrong was never your concern
This time you crossed the line, I'll watch you burn - burn

It's a matter of respect, in which you show none
Don't say a fucking word, the damage is done
Should have watched your mouth, now it's broken
Watch where you spit your teeth, silence is golden

Silence is golden
Silence is golden
