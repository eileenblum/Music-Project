Swollen and bloated, you're splitting at the seams
Talking to yourself, is this real or just a dream
I got you red handed, foot in mouth
Pray for forgiveness and hope you make it out

Running on empty, no fumes for you to choke
You dove into the deep end with bricks around your throat
I want to smash your liars mouth cause all I feel is hate
My charity has faded me, leave you dying in my wake

Now everyone will see you for what you are
You're the shadow of a coward that dreamt of being hard

I got you red handed, foot in mouth
Pray for forgiveness and hope you make it out

Running on empty, no fumes for you to choke
You dove into the deep end with bricks around your throat
I want to smash your liars mouth cause all I feel is hate
My charity has faded me, leave you dying in my wake

Fuck, fuck your dishonesty
Fuck the rest for doubting me
Fuck, fuck your dishonesty
Fuck the rest for doubting me

Fuck, fuck your dishonesty
Fuck the rest for doubting me

Second guessed my loyalty, exposed for all to see
