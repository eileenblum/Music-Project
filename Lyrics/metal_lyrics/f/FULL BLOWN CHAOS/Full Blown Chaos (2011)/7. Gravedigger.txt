Draining yourself of life, I can see your strain
I refuse to let you down, live another day in pain
Draining yourself of life, I can see your strain
I refuse to let you down, live another day in pain

I'll bring you salvation

Take a step back to collect your thoughts
Take a step back, look into the mirror
Do you recognize the face staring back
Do you recognize yourself anymore

As of right now, I don't know who you are
What have you become, you've fallen so far
As of right now, I don't know who you are
What have you become, you've fallen so far

Running your whole life, you'll never get anywhere
It's time to face the facts, stop living in despair
Running your whole life, you'll never get anywhere
It's time to face the facts, stop living in despair

As of right now, I don't know who you are
What have you become, you've fallen so far
As of right now, I don't know who you are
What have you become, you've fallen so far

Don't destroy yourself, I've walked the road you tread
Don't destroy yourself, you're never better dead

As of right now, I don't know who you are
What have you become, you've fallen so far
As of right now, I don't know who you are
What have you become, you've fallen so far

Don't, don't, don't destroy yourself
Don't, don't, don't destroy yourself
Don't destroy yourself, I've walked the road you tread
Don't destroy yourself, you're never better dead
