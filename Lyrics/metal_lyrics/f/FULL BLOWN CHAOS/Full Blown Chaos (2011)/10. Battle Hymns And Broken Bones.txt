Choose your words wisely, they may be your last
Come at me with empty threats, I'll cut your tongue out
It's a battle for power, fight for earth and water
Disrespect for what I stand, die like the rest

We march to fight another day
We march onward to victory
We march to fight another day
We march onward to victory

You bring the crowns of kings With heads to fit to my ciy steps
You won't take mine, not this fucking time

It's a battle for power, fight for earth and water
There will be hell to pay, and the price is blood

We march to fight another day
We march onward to victory
We march to fight another day
We march onward to victory
We march
We march

We march
We march

This is where we hold them, this is where we fight
This is where they die, this is where they die
This is where we hold them, this is where we fight
This is where they die, this is where they die
