Bring me the end, the fucking fall of man
Our day is done, throw the towel in
Dead icons, false prophets will have their way
Born of fire, condemned to flame

Doomageddon, discipline has got us nowhere
Doomageddon, all right, alright, right
Doomageddon, this is the end of the fucking world
It's our time to die

Been pushed too far
This dog will have its day
Final act of a desperate man
I'll take you all with me
Fuck you and you and fuck you
Burn this fucker down
Strap me to the bomb
Ride it to the ground

Doomageddon, discipline has got us nowhere
Doomageddon, all right, alright, right
Doomageddon, this is the end of the fucking world
It's our time to die

Dead icons, false prophets will have their way
Born of fire, condemned to flame

Fuck you and you and fuck you
Burn this fucker down
Strap me to the bomb
Ride it to the ground
