Armageddon is upon us
The world we knew is gone
Been devoured by greed and corruption
We are the walking dead
We are the walking dead

Spit the venom, poisoned us all
We brought this plague down on ourselves
We are the cancer, we are the disease
We are the walking dead
The walking dead

Our values are rotting away
This is the process of decay
Process of decay

Open your eyes, behold destruction
You know we've gone too far
Blackened the heart of the land
We have become despair
Witness collapse of all nations
Brought down to their knees
Can you fathom the devastation
We are the disease

Armageddon is upon us
The world we knew is gone
We are the cancer, we are the disease
We are the walking dead

I want to ride on the front line of this world's demise - demise
I want to ride on the front line of this world's demise
I want to ride on the front line of this world's demise
I want to ride on the front line of this world's demise

Armageddon is upon us
We are the walking dead
