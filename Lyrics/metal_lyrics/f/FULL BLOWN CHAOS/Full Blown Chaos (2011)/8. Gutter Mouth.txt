Strike, strike it down
Strike, Into the ground
Strike, strike it down
Strike, Into the ground
Strike, strike it down
Strike, Into the ground

I feel no fear, I have no doubt
Hold your fucking tongue or I'll rip it out
Bring me the strength to make it through another day
Strike when the iron's hot and never miss a shot

Nothing can stand in our way, tear town your barricades

I feel no fear, I have no doubt
Hold your fucking tongue or I'll rip it out
Bring me the strength to make it through another day
Strike when the iron's hot and never miss a shot

Nothing can stand in my way, break through every obstruction
Tear down your baricades, I will shake every foundation

Your words mean nothing to me, your opinion won't change a thing
I'm done hearing your pleas, don't speak your bullshit to me

Strike, strike it down
Strike, Into the ground
Don't you ever shut the fuck up

Nothing can stand in my way, break through every obstruction
Tear town your barricades, I will shake every foundation

Your words mean nothing to me, your opinion won't change a thing
I'm done hearing your pleas, it's all bullshit to me
