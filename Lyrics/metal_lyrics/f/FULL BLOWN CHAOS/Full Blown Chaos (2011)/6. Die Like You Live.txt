Sleeping with one eye open, still you're blind to the truth
Bitten more than you can chew, and there's nothing you can do
You're not worth the air you breathe, not worth the salt I seethe
I'm the darkness that you fear, believe everything you hear

This is the end of all you know
Waste of life, with nothing to show
Die like you live, I'll tear you apart

This is the end of all you know
Waste of life, with nothing to show
Die like you live, I'll tear you apart

Die like you live, tear you apart
Die like you live, I'll tear you apart
Die like you live, tear you apart

Should have made your mark on the world
Now you're a stain on the floor
Wasted your life, and now you're wasted
I'll tear you apart

This is the end of all you know
Waste of life, with nothing to show
Die like you live, I'll tear you apart

This is the end of all you know
Waste of life, with nothing to show
Die like you live, I'll tear you apart

Die like you live, tear you apart
Die like you live, I'll tear you apart
Die like you live, I'll tear you apart

Die like you live, tear you apart

Wasted your life, and now you're wasted
Tear you apart
