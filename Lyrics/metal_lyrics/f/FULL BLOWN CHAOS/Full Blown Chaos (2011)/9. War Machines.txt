I've taken everything you've ever thrown at me
Buried it down where no one can see
Judged everything I am, questioned my loyalty
Left me with nothing, never believed in me

This time we'll show them all exactly what we're made of
Power from all this hate, been feeding me for years
Think you got the best of me, force fed animosity
This time we show the world, we've weeded out the weak

Judged everything I am, questioned my loyalty
Left me with nothing, never believed in me

This time we'll show them all exactly what we're made of
Power from all this hate, been feeding me for years
Think you got the best of me, force fed animosity
This time we show the world, we've weeded out the weak

Power inside of me, grant me supremacy

Broken, broken not beaten
Over, overcome it all
Hate, hate, hate turns to strength
Overcome it all, I overcome it all
Overcome it all, I overcome it all
