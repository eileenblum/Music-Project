All your words, so full of shit
You're not the first to lie to my face
I know the game, hit em hard and run away
This time won't be the same, dug your own grave

Nothing good will come from this

It's too late now
No one can hear you scream
You'll cry for me and go out like a bitch
No one will care, no one will know
You'll be in pieces before you're even missed

Fire away, today's the day
If ignorance is bliss you're fucking full of it
Even now you're thinking, you can't get away
This ain't no bad dream, it's your dying day

No one will care, no one will know
You'll be in pieces before you're even missed

Fire away, today's the day
If ignorance is bliss you're fucking full of it
Even now you're thinking, you can't get away
This ain't no bad dream, it's your dying day
