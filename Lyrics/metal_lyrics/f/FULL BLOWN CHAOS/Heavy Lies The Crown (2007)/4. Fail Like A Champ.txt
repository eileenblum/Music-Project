Failure
Should be your middle name
Anger
To focus all the blame
You think you got the best of me
But what you have is nothing
I can see much clearer
All I see is failure
You
You Fail
At Life
Have I succumb to seduction
To forgive and to forget
Has never been in the cards
Your lies strike twice as hard
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice and I'll cut your heart out
You've never been in the cards
Your lies strike twice as hard
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice and I'll rip your heart out
Should have known from the start
The hunt is on to tear you apart
Trust is another word you never understood
When I gave you took it all
Take it back to watch you crawl
On your hands and knees
You beg and cry your pleas
I will reap what you have sewn
From respect never shown
Hang yourself from a liar's truce
Your tongue has become your noose
Trust is another word you never understood
You think you got the best of me
But what you have is nothing
You think you got the best of me
But what you have is not a thing
You think you got the best of me
But what you have is nothing
You think you got the best of me
But what you have is not a thing
Eye for an eye
Failure
Should be your middle name
Anger
Focus all the pain
Eye for an eye
Eye for an eye
