One day you'll find
Hide too many lies
Behind your eyes
I see everything
You cant run from this
You hide your face in shame
How can you life this way
Your life's a fallacy
You cant run from this
You hide your face in shame
How can you live this way
You're lifeless
Took my strength for weakness
You called yourself a friend
Cover lies with other lies
Life of sorrow
One day you'll find
Hide too many lies
Behind your eyes
I see everything
You cant run from this
You hide your face in shame
How can you live this way
You're lifeless
Brought down
This on yourself
Enshroud
No truth within yourself
Brought down
Enshroud
Brought down
No truth within yourself.
