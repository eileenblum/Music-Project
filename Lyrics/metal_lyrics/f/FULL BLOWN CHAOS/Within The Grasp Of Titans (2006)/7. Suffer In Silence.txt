No innocent ignorance
Constant impetuous
Commit to nothing
What have you become
Remain oblivious, this world cold and calloused
Chew you up, spit you out
And never bat an eye
Cant you see I'm reaching out to you
Pick up the pieces, I am torn in two
No innocent ignorance
Constant impetuous
Remain oblivious
Your heart, cold and calloused
Cant you see I'm reaching out to you
Just a friend, trying to pull you through
Never wanted
Patience thinning
All that I have
You turn it away
Fallen on deaf ears
You suffer in silence
All that I have
You turn it away
Fallen on deaf ears
You suffer in silence
Deny my hand
You never learn
You are forsaken
All that I have
Turn it away
Fall on deaf ears
Suffer in silence
