Get up, get on your feet
I watched long enough
Time is now, to make things right
We must overcome gone on for to long
Where do you cross the line
Kept us down and out
Got rich while we were blind
You always had our trust
Now you turned on us
Sold your soul
To burn us all
Actions beyond forgiveness
Lies wont be forgotten
Take no prisoners
Destroy them all
Rise-to your feet
Fight - tooth and nail
Rise - brothers in arms
Fight - we will prevail
Get up, get on your feet
I watched long enough
Time is now to make things right
We must overcome
Gone on for to long
Where do you cross the line
Keep us down and out
Got rich while we were blind
Rise - to your feet
Fight - tooth and nail
Rise - brothers in arms
Fight - we will prevail
Gave our faith
Took our trust
Sold us out
Pay in blood
Rise - to your feet
Fight - tooth and nail
Rise - brothers in arms
Fight - we will prevail
