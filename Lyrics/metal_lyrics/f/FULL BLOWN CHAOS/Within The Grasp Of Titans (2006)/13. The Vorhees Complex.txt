Annihilation
Exterminate
Pressure mounting
Watch every move
Weight of the world
Crushing you
Cripple order
Destroy control
Death at the doorstep
Strings us all
Ever fleeting
Hope is broken
Dead lights
Fall on our eyes
Kiss of death
Brings our demise
On your knees
Beg to an empty heaven
Exterminate
Annihilation
I was born to murder this world
Suffer to stay alive
Bleed out the week
Only the damned survive
