Do you know me?
Tell me what you believe
How dare you judge me
I am more than what you see
I made this life
And everyone a friend
Still you turned on me
Shown true colors
You never listen
You hear the sound
You never listen
And fuck the words
Never ending every things become a trend
I hope you had your fill
Cause this is where the bleeding ends
Slowly dying
Were worked down to the bone
Go against the grain
Or die alone
I wont change for you
Cause you will never change
I live my life everyday
You just fail and fade away
Dare you judge
Turn on me
You just fail
Fade away
