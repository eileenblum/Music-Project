Another day of breathing
Acrid and thick, I inhale
Feel it burn inside
When will the smoke clear
Seems like its been forever
Seen only death and disease
With every breath I'm dying
See my fate in from of me
There will be no dawn for man
Rotting minds have faded
Damned us to years of flame
Use to fear a life in hell
Now I live it everyday
There will be no dawn for man
Humanity has collapsed
This is the burning age
Never cease until we are ash
There will be no dawn for man
Another day of breathing
Every wake brings more decay
There will be no dawn for man
This is the burning age
Another day of breathing
Every wake brings more decay
There will be no dawn for man
This is the burning age
