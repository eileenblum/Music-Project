Shudder at the though
How distant you became
Your eyes, clouded over
Haunted by yesterday
Dissipate
Right in front of me
Desolate
Feeding on emptiness
Soul bled
Left you hollow
Dissipate
Right in front of me
Undertow
Sucked you down
Desolate
Feeding on emptiness
Soul bled
Left you hollow
Hollow
You are hollow
Shudder at the thought
How distant you became
Your eyes, clouded over
Haunted by yesterday
Scarred from the inside
Hard times, bitter tears
Gave in too easily
Victim of memories
Dissipate
Right in front of me
Undertow sucked you down
Desolate
Feeding on emptiness
Soul bled, left you hollow
Soul bled
Left you hollow
You are hollow
