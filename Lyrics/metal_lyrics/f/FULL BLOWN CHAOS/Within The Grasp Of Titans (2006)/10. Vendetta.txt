Over before the start
Our eyes will never meet again
Cry after cry, lie after lie
Built upon deceit
You know what I believe
No a fucking word
With all you fabricate
How can you grip reality
Show now mercy
Vengeance mine
Deception led to nothing
That is what you are
Over before the start
Your eyes will never meet again
Show no mercy
Vengeance mine
Deception led to nothing
That is what you are
Over before the start
Our eyes will never meet again
Show no mercy
Nothing remains vengeance mine
Eye for an eye
