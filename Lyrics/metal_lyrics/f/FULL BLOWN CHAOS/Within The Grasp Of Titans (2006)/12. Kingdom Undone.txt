One man to rule them all
Conceived son of God
He will destroy us
Bleed the world dry
Power corrupted
Infected mind
Unholy messenger
Drank blood, of the martyr
Deceived and in denial
Betrayed by belief
Enslaved to an enemy
Involved in our prayers
Darkened harvest
Reaped their souls
Lambs to the slaughter
Kingdom undone
The sleeper has awaken
Lay down your crown, your reign is over
Raging angles, battle no more
Might have fallen
Lay down your crown, your reign is over
The sleeper has awaken
One man to rule them all
Conceived son of God
Power corrupted
Infected mind
Achieved and in denial
Betrayed by belief
Lambs to the slaughter
Kingdom undone
The sleeper has awaken
Raging angles, battle no more
Kingdom undone, your throne in ruins
Enemy of the world, praise our new lord
The might have fallen, law down your crown, your reign is over
Conceived and in denial
Betrayed by belief
Lambs to the slaughter
Kingdom undone
The sleeper has awaken
