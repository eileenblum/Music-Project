Think you are alone
You have never been more wrong
This affliction
Kills a piece of us all
Drowning inside out
Swallow fatal frame
Don't hold your breath
I swear, you will breathe again
This is a promise
All I have in my heart
Strength for both of us
Pull you from the shadows
This blight wont take your life
Scour the rust from your veins
I feel your pain
Shedding mortal remains
Put your mind at ease
You aren't on your own
With you all the way
Fight this together
This is a promise
To a fallen friend
If you are lost
I swear, we will meet again
Think you are alone
You've never been more wrong
This affliction
Kills a piece of us all
Drowning inside out
Swallow fatal frame
Don't hold your breath
I swear, you will breathe again
This is a promise
This is a promise
All I have in my heart
Strength for both of us
Pull you from the shadows.
