This is your end
No one to save you
Tore a hole through me
Left me for dead
Tare down your walls
To fill my soul
Consume this hate
To make me whole
This is who I am
How does it feel to loose it all
No one left to take the fall
Now I'm the one in control
These thoughts of you
Turn me to stone
Tare down your walls
To fill my soul
Consume this hate
To make me whole
This is who I am
How does it feel
To lose it all
No one left to take the fall
Now I'm the one in control
These thoughts of you
Turn me to stone
Crush it all today
So there is no tomorrow
I have no regret
I feel no remorse
You tried to take my life
And now I'm stronger than every
No regret
No remorse
Ill change nothing from the past
This has made me
Who I am
I will feed on this hatred
This is your end
No one to save you
