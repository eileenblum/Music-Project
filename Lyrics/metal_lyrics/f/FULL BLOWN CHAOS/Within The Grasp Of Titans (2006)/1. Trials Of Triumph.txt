My stride can't be broken
Always gaining ground
It'll prove you wrong
In steel my will is forged
Spark lights the friction
Mountains set in motion
Its not a slow burn
This is a firestorm
Impetus
Driven every wave
Catalyst
Master my influence
My stride cant be broken
Always gaining ground
Ill prove you wrong
In steel, my will is forged
Spark lights the friction
Mountains set in motion
Its not a slow burn
This is a firestorm
Impetus
Driving every wave
Catalyst
Master of my influence
Dominate
Trials of triumph
Incinerate
Conquer all my fears
Dominate
My stride can't be broken
Mountains set in motion
Ill prove you wrong
In steel my will is forged
