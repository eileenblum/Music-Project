Try and hold me back
You fail every time
No chains can restrain
Level barriers one by one
Only one way to go
Thats up above the rest
Breath through every wall
Iron will
I wont give up
Never again give in to you
Cant make me turn away
Ill never look away
This goes beyond desire
Driven by my goals
Too determined to be defeated
Steadfast on solid ground
Anchored heart
Try and hold me back
You fail every time
No chains can restrain
Level barriers one by one
I wont give up
Never give in to you
Cant make me turn away
Ill never look away
This goes beyond desire
Driven by my goals
Too determined to be defeated
Steadfast on solid ground
Anchored heart
Iron will
Too determined to be defeated
Anchored heart
Steadfast on solid ground
I wont give up
Never give in to you
Cant make me turn away
Ill never look away
This goes beyond desire
Driven by my goals
Too determined to be defeated
Steadfast on solid ground
