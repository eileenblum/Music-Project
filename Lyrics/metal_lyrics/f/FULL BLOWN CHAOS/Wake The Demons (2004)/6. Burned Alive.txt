Burned alive from the inside
My hatred set ablaze
I am sickened by this life
You could never understand

All my prayers were never answered
Despite my loyalty
You wrote right from wrong
All you did was feed on my faith

I am witness to the truth
I can see past your lies
Blood of my blood - A sacrifice
Cannibalize the body of christ

I will strike at your strength
A wolf amongst the sheep
Your flock will be devoured
They'll be like me BURNED ALIVE

I will not atone
No saving our souls
Consumed all my beliefs
Inside I'm burned alive

BURNED ALIVE

I will not become a victim
Sell my soul into slavery
I don't need forgiveness
Care not for mercy

No more good and evil
Just a pile of smoking ash
Set fire to our sins
And together we will burn alive
