Everyday I pull tighter
Bring you closer to the fire
Choke the life from your eyes
As I inhale your dying breath

Who need enemies with friends like you
Your lies cut like broken glass
Another day you will suffer
For every knife stabbed in my back

I'd rip your eyes out
If you would only look away
Blind you like I've been
Escape where you can't see

Another day you will suffer
For every day stabbed in my back
Finally there will be justice
When everything you love comes crashing down

Salt the ground that you walk on
So nothing grows and everything dies
I will never beat peace
Till these hands tear you apart

Everyday I pull tighter
Bring you closer to the fire
Choke the life from your eyes
As I inhale your dying breath

I'd rip your eyes out
If you would only look away
Blind you like I've been
Escape where you can't see

Another day you will suffer
For every day stabbed in my back
Finally there will be justice
When everything you love comes crashing down

There will be no justice
Till everything you love comes crashing down
There will be no justice
Till everything you love comes crashing down

Choke as I inhale your dying breath

There will be no justice
Till everything you love comes crashing down
There will be no justice
Till everything you love comes crashing down
