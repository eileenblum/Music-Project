So cold
Absence of those around me
Hide behind lying eyes
Cause you were never there

How can you explain
Your lack of honesty
You took an oath
Broke a bond that we believed

To you I'll turn my back
And face my family
You will never earn the respect
That my friends will recieve

Your life erased from my memory
Nothing left of you
Cause you're dead to me

So cold
Absence of those around me
Hide behind lying eyes
Cause you were never there

You took an oath
Broke a bond that we believed

To you I'll turn my back
And face my family
You will never earn the respect
That my friends will recieve

Your life erased from my memory
Never needed you
All I need is me

NEVER

Never needed you
All I need is me
My friends - my family

Never needed you
All I need is me
Nothing left of you
Cause you're dead to me

To you I'll turn my back
And face my family
You will never earn the respect
That my friends will recieve

Your life erased from my memory
Nothing left of you
Cause you're dead to me

So cold
You're dead to me
