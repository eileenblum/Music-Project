No longer blinded
As I rise from the shadows of hate
My vision has been released
Your suffering won't go unanswered

I - Prophet of hostility
Witnessed the second coming
Fate turns black through my veins
I will not be sacrificed

You've been fore warned

No longer blinded
As I rise from the shadows of hate
My vision has been released
Your suffering won't go unanswered

I - Prophet of hostility
Witnessed the second coming
Fate turns black through my veins
I will not be sacrificed

My lord you are mistaken
I never asked to be saved
Now you beg for my confession
I should have killed more with the time I had

I bring a holocaust
Waiting to awake itself
My pain will scorch the sky
The wake I cause - Catastrophic

I bring a holocaust
Waiting to awake itself
My pain will scorch the sky
The wake I cause - Catastrophic
