Abandoned word of god
Punishment for broken faith
Saturated floods of fire
Wave by wave I drown in flames

UNDYING
Condemned to walk this cursed earth
All that remains
Baron decay
Every nerve
Fires in pain
Eternal life in dying days

Condemned to walk this cursed earth
All that remains
Baron decay
Every nerve
Fires in pain
Eternal life in dying days

Damned every dawn
By new death
My heart bled dry
Filled with ash
All my sins keep me alive
Undying - Undead

Condemned to walk this cursed earth
All that remains
Baron decay
Saturated floods of fire
Wave by wave I drown in flames
Undying - Undead

Undying - Immolation
I am forever burning
Undying - Immolation
Begun by blood
By blood undone

Undying - Immolation
I am forever burning
Undying - Immolation
Begun by blood
By blood undone

No longer fear the pain
Of napalm through my veins
Unholy price I pay
To walk these dying days
