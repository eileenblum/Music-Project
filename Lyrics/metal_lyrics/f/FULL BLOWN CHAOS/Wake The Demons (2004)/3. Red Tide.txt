All I want is to see you dead
Everything you love must die
You have crossed me for the last time
All your bridges will burn

Sold my soul to see you suffer
A small price for the pain you've caused
I will see your world covered in ash
Fires blaze as darkness falls

Undying is the hate I hold for you
I'll remain relentless till your blood stains my hands
DEMONS - DEMONS - DEMONS
Legions of demons to exact my revenge

Death defied - Corpses rise to my side

Sold my soul to see you suffer
A small price for the pain you've caused
I will see your world covered in ash
Fires blaze as darkness falls

Undying is the hate I hold for you
I'll remain relentless till your blood stains my hands
DEMONS - DEMONS - DEMONS
Legions of demons to exact my revenge

Death defied - Corpses rise to my side
A red tide will mark the end of your time

Let the sea run red with the blood of my enemies
Let the sea run red with the blood of my enemies
Let the seas run red with the blood of my enemies

Demons turn chaos into flesh
No escape for the cross for the unblessed
Embodiment of suffering I've become
I will rise
A plague upon your world
