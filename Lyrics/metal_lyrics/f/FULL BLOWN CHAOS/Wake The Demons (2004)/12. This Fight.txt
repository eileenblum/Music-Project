In this fight
This thing that we call life
The war that we wage everyday

Win or lose
We won't fold
To quit is not in our blood

To the grave
We'll take our pride
And live with honor in our hearts

Right or wrong
We are in this together
Never turning, we'll stand strong

We'll break through solitude
And face the world as one
Answer to no man but ourselves
Our only choice is the truth

This world is ours for the taking
One chance to gain control
This is our destiny
We will rise to meet our faith

In this fight
In this fight
In this fight
We stand strong

We'll break through solitude
And face the world as one
Answer to no man but ourselves
Our only choice is the truth

This world is ours for the taking
One chance to gain control
This is our destiny
We will rise to meet our faith

In this fight
This thing that we call life
The war that we wage everyday

Win or lose
We won't fold
To quit is not in our blood

To the grave
We'll take our pride
And live with honor in our hearts

Right or wrong
We are in this together
Never turning, we'll stand strong

In this fight
In this fight
In this fight
We stand strong

In this fight
In this fight
In this fight
We stand strong
