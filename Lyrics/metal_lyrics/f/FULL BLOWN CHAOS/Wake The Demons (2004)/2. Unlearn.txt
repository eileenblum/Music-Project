Too many times I've been struck down
Fed lies to pacify
Drawn away from the truth
We are a dying breed

Everyday we move closer
The end drawing near
Time will slip away
If you drop your guard

Unlearn and be reborn
Your thoughts are not your own
Unlearn and be reborn
Only the wise will rise

Take hold of common sense
Sacrifice must be replaced
No need for martyrs
If we open your eyes

Strength in numbers
Makes for a larger target
Can't isolate ignorance
So I'll stand alone

Unlearn and be reborn

Take hold of common sense
Sacrifice must be replaced
Can't isolate ignorance
So I'll stand alone

Unlearn and be reborn
Only the wise will rise
Unlearn and be reborn

Humanity has lost all it's instincts
Our senses have been abandoned
We must regain our lives
Unlearn and be reborn

Humanity has lost all it's instincts
Our senses have been abandoned
We must regain our lives
Unlearn and be reborn
