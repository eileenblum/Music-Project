We are the unseen
Locked down and driven out
Too long we sleep in dreams
Inside nightmares unwind

Today we rise
The wait is over
Burn down walls of shadow
Tear through reality

You cannot hide the dark side
Blackened by years of hate
This darker half of our conscience
Will soon be revived

Breathe life into this nightmare
WAKE THE DEMONS

WAKE THE DEMONS
WAKE THE DEMONS
WAKE THE DEMONS
WAKE THE DEMONS

We are the unseen
Locked down and driven out
Too long we sleep in dreams
Inside nightmares unwind

You cannot hide the dark side
Blackened by years of hate
This darker half of our conscience
Will soon be revived

Unearth the buried
Contained within
Escape this cage
Penetrate the surface

Today we rise
The wait is over
Burn down the walls of shadow
Tear through reality

Breathe life into this nightmare

WAKE THE DEMONS
WAKE THE DEMONS
WAKE THE DEMONS
WAKE THE DEMONS
