This world is slowly dying
So thick death in the air
Condemned by your creations
Man is a god in ruins

Look into our past
History repeats itself
Damned by inheritance
From our mistakes we'll never learn

Humanity is at its end
Do you smell your extinction
Will you embrace the lord
Save your soul to further your denial

We have failed to take the blame
Brought down by your actions
Condemned by our fate to suffer
We are shadows in the light

This world slowly dying
Condemned by your creations
No more innocence
Abandoned by our lord
We're shadows in the light

These chains of bloodshed
You can never break
Condemned by our fate
In the long run we're all dead

These chains of bloodshed
You can never break
Condemned by our fate
In the long run we're all dead

These chains of bloodshed
You can never break
Innocence fallen from grace
Condemned shadows in the light
