To arms
The time to strike is now
Today we take our lives back
Do not fall victim to their lies
We've come too far now

The war we wage
A storm of chaos
Death the only escape
For your crimes against humanity
You will be judged by vengeance

There's two men I trust in this world
One is me the other is not you
Our defenses will not be purged
By your deception

Cast down
By your hand
Your life
Destroyed

Cast down
By your hand
Your life
Destroyed

One by one we will overcome
Every obstacle will fall at our feet
Full Blown Chaos
The war we wage
To crush our enemy

When you die I'll be there
Cuz I'll be the one taking your life
You'll known the meaning of suffer
My hate bestowed on you

When you die I'll be there
Cuz I'll be the one taking your life
You will known the meaning of suffer
My hate bestowed on you

Taking your life
Cuz I'll be
Taking your life
