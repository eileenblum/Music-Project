There comes a time for everyone
To fall back or stand your ground
Fight or flight - Do or die
You never fail if you try

Everyday we rise and fall
Sometimes we lose our way
Never bend to another's will
Courage is all we need

STRENGTH WITHIN

Make every second count
Lost time can't be reclaimed
Live every day like it's your last
And regret will have no meaning

Leave mistakes in the past
We live to learn and overcome
Yesterday has come and gone
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

STRENGTH WITHIN
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

Everyday we rise and fall
Sometimes we lose our way
We take a chance with every breath
How can we win if there's nothing to lose

Leave mistakes in the past
We live to learn and overcome
Yesterday has come and gone
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

STRENGTH WITHIN

Make every second count
Lost time can't be reclaimed
Live every day like it's your last
And regret will have no meaning

Leave mistakes in the past
We live to learn and overcome
Yesterday has come and gone
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

STRENGTH WITHIN
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow
STRENGTH WITHIN
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

STRENGTH WITHIN

STRENGTH WITHIN
STRENGTH WITHIN

Everyday we rise and fall
Sometimes we look away
Yesterday has come and gone
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

Everyday we rise and fall
Sometimes we look away
Yesterday has come and gone
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow

Everyday we rise and fall
Sometimes we look away
Yesterday has come and gone
Look ahead and embrace tomorrow
