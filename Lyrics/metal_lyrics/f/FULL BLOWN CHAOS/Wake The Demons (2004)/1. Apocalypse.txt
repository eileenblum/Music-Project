For every scar
A lesson learned

Heed the word hear the cries
Four horseman at my door
Your mistake
Killed all my problems so fuck your solutions

Evil runs, evil runs through my veins
Damned my eyes, blood from wine

Angels will be burnt offerings
Plucked from the sky
Burn down the heavens
And infest the world

Genocide for your actions
Prayers the same as poisoned lies
Gospel of your demise

No escape - Drown in agony

Open the gates - Arise
Dawn of apocalypse
Obey the way of old
Dawn of apocalypse

Made in his image
You'll die the same

Evil runs through my veins

I hope you suffer alone
And you drown in agony

Open the gates - Arise
Dawn of apocalypse
Obey the way of old
Dawn of apocalypse
