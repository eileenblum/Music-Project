All hope is lost
My faith can't be revived
Took everything I held true
Cast it aside

Betrayed by my own
Went against all my beliefs
Everything has fallen from focus
How could I let you in

KNOW YOUR TIME WILL COME

You've taken part of my life
That I could never recover
Blinded by my pride
All you did was break my trust

You've taken part of my life
That I could never resurrect
Blinded by my pride
All you did was bring me down

One day we'll meet again
Nowhere will you be safe
Stalk the world and wait
Patience my favored weapon

Held you so high
Now I realize
Cuz I fell for you

Held you so high
Now I realize
Cuz I fell for you

Nowhere will you be safe

All of your faith
Replaced with broken promises

Never again - trust no one
Never again - trust no one
Never again - trust no one
Never again - trust no one
