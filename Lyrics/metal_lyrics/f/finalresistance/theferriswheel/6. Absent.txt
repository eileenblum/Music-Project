my thoughts suspended in silence
I am absent, cant you see?
the pitch black heart in a wrong hands
your actions raises abhorrence
Â 
im closed in cage of sadness
got rid of emotions, indifferent
outcast the world, scared and hurted
taught not to trust, no one
Â 
rotten soul under my mask
burnout ashes of dead feelings
i will never understand the world
i will never accept its motion
Â 
im closed in cage of sadness
got rid of emotions, indifferent
outcast the world, scared and hurted
taught not to trust, no one

dont ask me anything, i wont answer
i'll suffer alone
dont say you're sorry, its needless
i'll handle it, i promise
