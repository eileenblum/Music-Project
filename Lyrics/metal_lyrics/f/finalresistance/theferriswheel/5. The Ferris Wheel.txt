we are wasting time on useless pursuit
of what we were told to be valuable
getting closer to the end with every breath
we forgot to live our dreamsnot only to exist

After moments of happiness
comes episodes of sadness
The life is just a ferris wheel
why don't we just sit, and take a ride?

afraid to face the new day
got lost in rush for ideals,
for which we're not going to die
we gave up from the present,
to achieve this, what was at our hands
Â 
why are we waiting for better days,
if we have have today?
answer me if we care too muchÂ 
or do we care too less?

judge your life and make up your mind
there is only one thing for us to do
enjoy our journey as best as we can,
cause the way we follow leads to a dead-end
