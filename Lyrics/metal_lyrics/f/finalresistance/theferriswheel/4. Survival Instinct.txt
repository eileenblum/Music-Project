I feel it in the dark
its staring at me from
the black of night
fear overcomes me,
I'm not brave enough to face it,
there's no escape from it,Â 
it's twisting my mind,
trying to deny it's calling
Â 
I won't follow my deepest fears
I need to regain control over my thoughts

I'm driven by survival instinct
I want to get it out of my mind.
I'm driven insane from my dread
Deliver me from madness

Nothing seems to save me from my phobia
No one seems to hear me screaming here
Â 
I won't follow my deepest fears
I need to regain control over my thoughts
I wonder if my time has come now?
What means that voices that I hear?
