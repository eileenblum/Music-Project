Which path should I follow?
Â 
struggling fate, fading ever more
trying to break throught this darkened days
I clench my fist, got lost again
I never seem to find my own fucking way
Â 
I'm tired of searching for the answers
for questions which are not relevant
Â 
for what am I running? who set the rules of the race?
I don't want to take parrt in this, I'ts not my game
Â 
Refren
the scars still remain, the signs of my way
what awaits at the end? please shatter me into pieces
the scars that remain on my heart
shows my decisions what awaits for me at the end?
can you shatter me?!
Â 
Please erase my burden
Â 
Which path should I follow?
Â 
for what am I running?
who set the rules of the race?
I don't want to take part in this,
I'ts not my game
