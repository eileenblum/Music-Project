We are the last ones standing on debris
our shadows on a smoke of burning ruins
We'll strike you down and drag to the streets
we're thirst of blood of our enemiesÂ 
Â 
you will burn for the burnt
you will hang for the hanged
you will die for your sins
you will suffer for the innocent

we are anonymous
we are legion, we dont forgive
we dont forget, expect us
expect the final resistance

goverment failed we've got enough your lies
we'll break our chains, get out of our cage
justice is coming, it has our name
marching in the front line, we'll bring you death

we are anonymous
we are legion, we dont forgive
we dont forget, expect us
expect the final resistance
