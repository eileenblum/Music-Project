The time has come to let it go,
We got this far, it's shame to lose it all
but none of us can change,
We know that we will be the same
Do we still want to delay the end?

For now it's too late,
We have to let it fall
break into pieces forget it existed
We cannot make it cause,
We can only get hurt

You were given a heart, you were given too much
for I can never get it back
You were given a heart, to protect, not to tear it apart
but now I don't give a fuck

So here we stand at a crossroads
so much time has passed, was it wasted?
Why do we strive?
We expected something better
that's why we're disappointed with life
