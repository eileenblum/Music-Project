I've spent plenty of nights consumed with the thought of giving up
Become a prime example of a person who's losing touch
I'm lost
[3x]
Bringin' it back I'm about to find myself.

All or nothing, it's all for nothing
All or nothing, it's all for nothing

When it's time
My back against the wall
Ashamed to know that I have nothing at all
Becoming something so much greater
Becoming something so much more
No hope

Trying to find all of this affection
That's been swallowed whole by this aggression
And I wanna be free
Clear the smoke and finally see
All the potential that's been building inside of me

And I can't ignore it
Give me something to live for
So waking up everyday doesn't seem like such a fucking chore
Such a fucking chore

When it's time
My back against the wall
Ashamed to know that I have nothing at all
Becoming something so much greater
Becoming something so much more

Something so much more than me
Something so much more than me..

Give me something to live for
[2x]

I'll write down every word
On these empty pages
But I'll make up for everything
And all the time I've wasted

Don't fear failure, fear acceptance
Don't fear failure...

It's too little too late
It's too little too late
It's too little too late..

I've shed the guilt
And the weight..
