Anxiety has taken over the city
It always finds a way to creep back into your life.
Into your life
It always finds a way to creep into your life
into your life

The fears we have decide our paths. We are victims in life's vicious game,
The fears we have

Fear always finds a way to creep back into your life. [2x]

You will never see the light of day,
You will never make things that clear, you will never escape the darkness,

Try and wake yourself

This is not a dream its reality.
This is not a dream it is reality.
This is not a dream it is reality.
