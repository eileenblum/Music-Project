What have you done to us?
who are we expected to trust?
blindfolded and left in the dark
pick yourself up, make your mark

It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here

Blindfolded and left in the dark,
pick yourself up and make your mark

Held down and force fed lies
about time to cut the ties
this noose around my throat
but I refuse to fucking choke

Fear money, and take control
fear money, and take control
A slave to money and the life you stole

Broke us to line your pockets with gold
I stopped believing all the things I've been told
I'll cut the legs off your high horse and I
can finally look you in your crooked eyes
and I'll tell you
I'll tell you that I'll keep fighting
I'll tell you
I'll keep fighting as long as I'm alive

They can't keep us quiet forever
we were innocent once, try and remember
a life you'll never relive
it's time to unite, grow and forgive
grow and forgive

So we will never turn into the likes of your victims

We will take our voices back, out of the hands of the god damn rats
And we will take our voices back, out of the hands of the god damn rats

False idols fade and disappear
Greed has taken the place of your fear..

We can build a wall that will block out the sun
a thousand voices are better then one
speak up and don't stand alone
face all the hatred it's all that you've ever known

Broke us to line your pockets with gold
I stopped believing all the things I've been told
I'll cut the legs off your high horse and I
can finally look you in your crooked eyes
