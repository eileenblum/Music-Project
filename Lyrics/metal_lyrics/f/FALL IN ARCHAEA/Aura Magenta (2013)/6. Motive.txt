Young man
You can't keep running away
Because there's so much more
Wake up and live for today
[2x]

Never let go,
And never give up
Open up your eyes..

I know it's hard to understand
And that it isn't fair
Bad things happen to good people
You don't have time to spare..

Young man
You cant keep running away
Live for today
[2x]

It's there, just need to see if for yourself
Fight what's growing inside of you
A year goes by and not a day goes by
Where I don't think about you

You're not alone.

I hope your life doesn't fail you
And your eyes don't end up sewn
Just tell us what we can do to
Help you feel alive and never feel alone

You're too young to die
And too proud to ask for help
I look in your eyes
Never understood exactly how you felt
You have so much life to live
Maybe one day you'll forgive..

[Courtney LaPlante:]
You think I'm trying to hurt you
When I'm trying to hold you
I'm trying to hold you
[2x]

Maybe right now
The world may seem so dark
But we can change it all
Light it up with a single spark
(With a single spark)

Young man
You can't keep running away
Live for today
Young man
You can't keep running away
Live for today

I know it's hard to understand
And that it isn't fair
[2x]

Save yourself from this...
