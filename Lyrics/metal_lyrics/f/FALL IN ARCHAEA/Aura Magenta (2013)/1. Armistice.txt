All you know is a lie
As the sand falls through
As the time passes by
Begging others to love you
Only seeking the praise of a sorry few
You're a liar and a thief
Bite your tongue because your time on top is bound to be brief
You're a liar and a thief
Bite your tongue because your time on top is bound to be brief

I will never let you fucking judge me
Discard you pretentious views
And gain some modesty
I will never let you fucking judge me
Discard you pretentious views
And gain some honesty

Armistice

No more praise
A mirage that only you can see
Theatric lies that only see the eyes of me
You want to be treated like a god?
Your whole view on life is flawed
A constant fight for acceptance
A false flag hunted down I will never accept this
I understand you're starving
But I will never be the hand that feeds you

I know my place
I know my capability
You are a fake understand all of my hostility
And while you're begging in the streets
I will always pass you by

Time will always pass you by
Time is always passing by
But it will not pass me

We are human and nothing more
But you are nothing like me
I will always pass you by
And you're nothing

Armistice

You're a liar and a thief
You're a liar and a thief
Bite your tongue because your time on top is bound to be brief

No more handouts
No more greed
Reaching further
Just follow my lead

You can make something count
If you do it for the right reason
You can make something last
If only you could see this

You can make something count
If you do it for the right reason
You can make something last
If only you could see this

And I will never be you
And you will never be me

And I will never be you
And you will never be me
