Now the crown lays in your hands
Never had to work for what you have
Fallen off of the throne
Just like us you're skin and fucking bone

I will watch your statue crumble
But there will be no sympathy from me
Death of a king

No place to run and hide
How do you live with yourself with what's left inside
You coward...

Now the crown lays in your hands
Never had to work for what you have
Fallen off of the throne
Just like us you're skin and fucking bone

Spineless and not willing to earn
What we've driven for all these years
Sit down listen and learn
Hard work, bloodshed, and tears

Control
Its a fear that will become you
Control
All the anger that I'm put through
Watching those who abuse what they don't deserve
Making slight of the few things that I have earned.

And you can never take that away from me
I'm through of watching you consume
Your life
And dragging others down with you [2x]

Should have took what you had
Could have done something with it
Now your stuck on the sidelines
Begging us for forgiveness

And it will happen over and over again.
You have no capacity to change.

I hope that you're not always like this,
My dear friend
Cause in the long run living like this
Will get you no where in the end.

And everything happens for a reason.
And everything happens for a reason.

You drive ahead for acceptance
A complete waste of existence
Never knowing honesty
But it's all too common, honestly.
