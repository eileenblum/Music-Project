I'm trapped
With nothing to say
it's hard to see the light when you are surrounded by hate
And I stand alone
I watch the world burn so far removed from what I used to
Know..

The root of all evil
Has taken a hold of me
Granted me
The right to an existence
Walk a crooked line
Down this path called resistance
Oh, these ghosts have a hold on me
Entities they're the thieves of my sanity
Fraction of
My true self that's been left behind
Lays dormant, intertwined with my failing mind.

This
Has to
Has to give
Forgive
What I've done
How I feel about myself
And the plague that I've become
Let you down once again
Now I'm trying to begin
To shed this skin

I'm trapped
With nothing to say
it's hard to see the light when you're surrounded by hate
And I stand alone
I watch the world burn so far removed from what I used to
Know..

I'm the root of all evil

Trying hard
To push through these hollow days
Reassurance I'm a failure and a hopeless case
I don't know what's left of me

Stand my ground
And I will overcome this
Fight my mind
And the evil that exists within it
Grind what's left of the future in my teeth
Prepare for what's next and cut the head off the beast..
Stand my ground, I will overcome this..
Stand my ground, I will overcome this.

I'm the root of all evil

And I was waiting for you
A place I couldn't call home
And I was waiting for you
A place I couldn't call home

Call my fuckin' home..
