Anxiety has taken over the city and
It always finds a way to creep back into your life.
It always finds a way to creep back into your life.
We are victims in life's vicious game,
The fears we have decide our path. We are victims in life's vicious game,
The fears we have.
And it always finds a way to creep back into your life.
Fear always finds a way to creep back into your life.
You will never see the light of day,
You will never make things that clear, you will never escape the darkness,
you will never see the light of day.
Chase down what you once thought was yours,
This is not a dream its reality.
You try and wake yourself from this nightmare,
Try and wake yourself
This is not a dream its reality.
This is not a dream it is reality.
Go before we are the victims
We are victims in lifes vicious game
