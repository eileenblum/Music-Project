Take the upper hand in leading this battle you created
There is no sympathy for you.
The battle has layn you in ruins.
I am a man but in your dreams I am a machine.
I am a man
But in your dreams i am a machine.
Your infection has spread through your vains into your head
"soon you will be dead!"
There is no cure for this desease,
There is no fighting chance for you, There is no hope in saving us.
I give up!
There is no hope in saving us,
There is no cure.
I give up!
Shadows walk the earth in day light with no fear.
The scum of the earth is our leaders.
Take the upper hand in leading this battle you created.
There is no sympathy for you.
The battle has layn you in ruins
Your looking out the fucking window
But you dont see the world staring back at you!
