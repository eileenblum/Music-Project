Pull my head out of the gutter as the water is getting higher.
We're littering these streets with lies.
we're drowning in our thoughts
Trying to keep open your eyes.
With all this said and done are you afraid to die
Because you keep pulling me closer fearing for a closure.
We're drowning in our thoughts
Trying to keep open your eyes.
How far do we have to go to plead through to you
Because i never wanted this.
Were standing on the edge waiting to jump.
Will you follow through.
