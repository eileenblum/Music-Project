Sleepless nights turn to mornings as these chapters come to an end.
We wake with blood shot eyes and bottles at our side.
Look what you created
I'm a machine on a never ending cycle,
That you left on.
I'm a machine that you created.
I'll take everything you have and bury it with the dead.
So take your fucking time and make it count.
You pick your battles but will never end this fight.
You led me to believe that there was something more, something on the

Inside and not the surface.
Something greater, something more.
I'll take everything you have and bury it with the dead,
Everything that you have.
It's strange enough to see,
That you and I are not meant to be
In this twisted game We call life.
Barack-ad these walls as i am not to escape
Because if this were to happen the world will soon know their fate
You led me to believe that there was something more,
Something on the inside and not the surface.
Something greater.
I'll take everything you have and bury it with the dead,
Everything that you have.
