I'll never trust again,
I'll never live with that look on your face.
I'll never trust again.
Your loyalty has become blasphemy,
Time and time again I look but you're not there.
Take your chances believe what you want
I will not change your faith.
Every time I look for something more
I end up hearing the same story as before.
I crave your guidance in these dark times.
I'll never trust again,
I'll never live with that look on your face.
Plead for the rest of your life it will get you no where.
