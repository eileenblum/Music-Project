The dark moon falls,
casting shadows across the earth.
Let this be the start of a new day,
Let this be the start of a new era.
The sun will rise,
Holding its place in the sky.
Let this be the start of a new day,
Let this be the start of a new era.
We will live another day as long as this god remains true
To its ever changing children we will let them down.
As these gods messengers rain from the sky a new page has turned.
With holding him of his duties so the night can rain again
Bow before me
The dark moon falls,
casting shadows across the earth.
Let this be the start of a new day,
Let this be the start of a new era.
The sun will rise,
Bow before me for i am your god
From the shadow begins a new uprising,
The sun it must not rise again.
The mighty must fall.
A lash out to the shadow overheard by all.
Bow before me bow before me for i am your god!
