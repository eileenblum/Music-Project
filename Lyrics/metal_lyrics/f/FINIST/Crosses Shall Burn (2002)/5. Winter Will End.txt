From the south the winter has come
There's no flowers, snow is around
Sun is shining but warmth is hiding
In temples built for the clown

Who can say there's no other way
I'm not a fool to blindly obey
Stream of life seems frozen but I know
The spring will come here again

Ain't you tired to live in the fear?
Gods! Please bless us - the battle is near
Take the sword in your hand
We have to defend
Our great Motherland...

And winter will end.
