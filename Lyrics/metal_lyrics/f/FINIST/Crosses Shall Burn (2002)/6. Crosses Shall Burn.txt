All of you talk about love and happiness
But what did you bring here? Slavery and death
You're building your churches and praying your messiah
You think he'll set you free... dirty jewish liar

No! Don't believe these lies, open up your eyes
Do you see the churches on our land?
We are occupied. Now we have to fight
And destroy these churches that still stand... at the end

[Chorus:]
Soon we'll return to the glory and fame
(Till the end of days)
Crosses shall burn in unholy flame

Brothers don't you say you cannot understand
There's no other way - your future's in your hands
These fools are hoping for this liar - I say he'll die in pain
I'm waiting for his second coming to kill him once again

Now we must take our swords and without a word
We will come as ravens from the sky
Now the time has come, we must carry on
Fight and christianity will die... in the flame

[Chorus]

Yes! Now the time has come.
We must carry on
