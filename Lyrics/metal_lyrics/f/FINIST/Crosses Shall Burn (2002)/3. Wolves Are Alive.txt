Darkness and fear - that's what I see
The moon is shining over trees
As the eye of eternity
Why many people turned to sheeps
And with prayers on their lips
They can say that they are free?

[Chorus:]
Yeah! From the darkness we'll rise
And we'll melt the ice
By the fire in our eyes
We'll bring the freedom again
In the churches' flame
We shall burn bastard's name

How all of you can be so blind
Or these bastards cleaned your mind?
Don't you know what's left behind?
Jews are ruling on our land
How you cannot understand
All our fate is in our hands?

[Chorus]

From the woods we'll return
As the firestorm
We will burn paradise
Soon gods will show us the way
And we'll proudly say
Wolves are really alive!
