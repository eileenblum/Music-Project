Perpetration
Annihilation
Your punishment
Is life damnation

Forever enslaved
Forever deranged

Searching for - The reason to all your pain
Suffering - From splits within your brain
Cold sweat - Runs through your veins
Nothing remains

Disfigured soul
Tears you apart
Conflict inside
Two minds in fight
All your efforts
Just wasted time
You've paid your toll
Disfigured soul
