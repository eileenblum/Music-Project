Baptized in blood
Chosen to reign
For evil's sake
You're the center of hate

Drown in blood sacrifice them all
Angel of darkness
Take their souls one by one they fall
Tormentor of dead flesh

Center of hate

Slaying, shredding, taking their lives
Bleeding, strangling, gasping for air
Rotting, decaying, part of the earth
Deciding master, symbol of fear

Your world - Is about to die
Your fault - You believed the lies
Everlasting hate - It's to late to regret
Burn eternally - For the pain you spread
