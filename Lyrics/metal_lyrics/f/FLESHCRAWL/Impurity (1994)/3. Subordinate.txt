Intimidate - By the power of darkness
Crushing fate - I'll give you the last bless
I control your hate - Only fear will remain
Subordinate - Cause I'll bring you pain

Captured and lost - In your own maze
Influenced by your - Devilish race
Take a final breath - In this world
Have a nice trip - Into the pit

Trust in me i lead you forth to independency
No remorse for the way i chose no mercy for my foes
I'll bring you down to the deepest ground the last to be found
Finally in the end of time you will be one of mine

Prepare to cross the line of death
A realm beyond where you're to rest
To the gates you step as they open wide
You can see the fire burning bright
