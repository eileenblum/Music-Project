I've heard the warning
So far away
Blood drunk like water
Now no more rain
Who's waiting for me
Now lost my friends
No one will ever
Miss me and my world

To blind to realize
Your gain is my demise
Infection's the reason why
Soon I'm gonna die
Nothing but shattered hopes
Can't work up the deadly truth
Suppressing my ruthless need
To give in the life of greed

God help me

Harsh words are spoken
By those who deny
Harsh words are spoken
Lies, always lies
Their drugs will cover
My soul forever
Their words will always
Be heard in my grave

Grave
So take me away
I'm finished with life
Ready to die
