In the end of time - When life expires
And everybody tries - To survive
We all have to pay - For all of our sins
Hate and fear
War and pain

Withering life - Rotting
Condemned to strive - Eternal
Feel no pain - Suffer
Intense strain - In vain

Withering life - Rotting
Condemned to strive - Eternal
Feel no pain - Suffer
Intense strain - In vain
Thoughts in mind - Chaos
About past times
Withering life - In the end you'll die
