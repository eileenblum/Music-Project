Dead ground - Misty fields
The complex - Of heavy guilt
High voltage - Barbed wire
No one - To leave alive

People crowd together
Desolate barracks day and night
Mass homicide camp
Like cattle inside a cage

There's no way to ease the pain
There's no hope inside this hell
Perished by the flames of hate
Serial killing by unscrupulous scum
Punished for something that was never done

Merciless - Till the last one dropped - No life
Enlarging - Cemetery of souls - Reveals
Solitude - For everyone - Deprived
Terminus - The chambers of incineration
