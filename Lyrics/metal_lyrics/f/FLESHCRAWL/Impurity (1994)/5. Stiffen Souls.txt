My soul beyond
Is stiff and cold
It's hard as stone
But it's not alone
The soul of war

My soul beyond
It's full of hate
It's hard as stone
But it's not alone
Stigmatized by war

Rotting beneath
Down on earth
So cold
A senseless war
On russian ground
So cold
And frozen blood
On frozen soil
So cold
Stiffening souls
In stiffening flesh
Behold

The zombies of war
Are raping my wife
Soldiers of death
Are looting my home
Now I hate forever
