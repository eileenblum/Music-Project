Evil - Your mind's all about
Pain is - What you deserve
Your soul - Is spoiled from inside
Creatures - Out of this world

Shattered dreams
Of perfect life
Cast curse
To endless pain

From the dead to the living s'been a horrible trip
Into the darkness you drift while your soul's being ripped
Your body's still alive, but the pain inside grows
From the dead to the living, a nightmare came true

From the dead to the living
