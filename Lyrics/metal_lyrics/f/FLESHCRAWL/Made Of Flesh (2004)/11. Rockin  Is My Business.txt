[Japanese bonus track]

["The Four Horsemen" cover]

We got hard drivin' cuties in their daddy's car
Shakin' their thing at every rock 'n' roll star
Got romance, hot pants, and I'm leavin' dust
Let me tell you 'bout love, it's in the back of the bus
Daddy said, son, do what you should
Rockin' is my business - business is good

We got cute suit dudes - they say they knew her
You broke her rock 'n' roll - motherfucker - I wrote it
You got no time - just sign on that bottom line
Leave it up to me, boy - everything's fine

Daddy said, son, do what you should
Rockin' is my business - business is good

We got hard rock babes in a Chevy Nova
Havin' a hard time largely with the scumbag who owns us
Studio, studio - night and day
Gotta play your songs boy - or you won't get laid

Daddy said, son, do what you should
Rockin' is my business - business is good

Rockin' is my business - business is good
Rockin' is my business - business is good
Rockin' is my business - business is good
Rockin' is my business - business is good
