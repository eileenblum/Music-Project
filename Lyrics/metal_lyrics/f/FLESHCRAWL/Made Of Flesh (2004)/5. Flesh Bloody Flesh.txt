Before the break of dawn
Creeping through the night
Fallen bastards crawl
Onwards in delight

Flesh bloody flesh - rotten human prey
Flesh bloody flesh - longing for decay
Flesh bloody flesh - suffering to ease
Flesh bloody flesh - unbound to decease

Beyond the realms of death
Beside reality
Plunging into hollowness
Apart from misery
Below the spheres of hate
Soaked in streams of blood
Branded and defiled
Devotion to the vile

Silent wings of death - closing to embrace
Burning skulls of flesh - Soon to be defaced

Flesh bloody flesh - Flesh bloody flesh
