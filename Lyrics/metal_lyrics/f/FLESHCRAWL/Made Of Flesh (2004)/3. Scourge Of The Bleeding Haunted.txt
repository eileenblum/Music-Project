Through the mist of foreign ground
Scattered souls of tales untold
Once forgotten scathing eyes
By damnation, lost in life

Seeking the void
The last one destroyed

Scourge of the bleeding haunted
Death and disdain, forever in pain
Scourge of the bleeding haunted
Revel in hell, bloodshed will tell

Staring into evil eyes
Fear beyond the truth will rise
Slavery of maggots will reign
Tortured human flesh remains

Once and for all
Covered in sin
Tainted in blood
The scourge of never ending pain

Caught inside the soul war
Trapped in burning graves
Suffer, Bleed and slowly die a thousand deaths
