Twisted Dreams I can't control
The sickness in my mind
Give 'em hell
Let them die
Hatred makes me blind
Bodies drop
I must obey
The voices never stop

Demons of the dead, demons of the dead
Demons of the dead, demons of the dead

I have seen ways to bleed
I suffer from myself
Living on a dead man's soul
Suffocates my health
Sacrifice
My blood runs cold
I'm dying to be free
The fall of my own sanity
The evil within me

Demons of the dead
