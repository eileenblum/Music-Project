Watching the end of the world
Follow the path to the edge
Endless perishment
Survival of souls unfulfilled
Calling the ghosts' afterlife
Awaiting the end to arrive
Downfall planet earth
Beneath a dying sun

With bleeding hearts
Embedded scars
The dying starts
All of our pain everlasts
Impaled alive
Slowly, all dies
The last day will come
Beneath a dying sun

Fading to black in the sky
Ashes and dust kill the light
Countdown world demise
Plunging into endless night
Forever in darkening void
Soulless hearts destroyed
The eve of emptiness
Beneath a dying sun

With bleeding hearts
Embedded scars
The dying starts
All of our pain everlasts
Impaled alive
Slowly, all dies
The last day will come
Beneath a dying sun

Turning into black
Rising of the dead
The dying has begun
Beneath a dying sun
