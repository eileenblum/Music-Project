The final curtain falls
When agony recalls
A touch of evil strikes
When life surrenders

Emerging emptiness
A banished soul to bless
My fading candle dies
When life surrenders

In twisted dreams my life will cease
The other side
My buried soul
In rotten soil
The end of time

The final curtain falls
When agony recalls
A touch of evil strikes
When life surrenders

The end of days arrive
When death replaces life
My judgement day - arise
When life surrenders
