Evil, mean and hellbent
We're searching for the way
No anticipation that our future has decayed
The fires burnt for ages
throughout the night
When history was written, no one survived

Damned in fire, we will burn
Damned in fire, our turn
Damned in fire, death in flames
Damned in fire, our grave

Evil, mean and hellbent
We're searching for the way
No anticipation that our future has decayed
Our souls are burning
Piled up at the stake
Misery and yearning
Forgotten to forsake

Damned in fire, we will burn
Damned in fire, our turn
Damned in fire, death in flames
Damned in fire, our grave
