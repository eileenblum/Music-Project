I saw the dimension where everything turns black
I had this vision of never coming back
I feel the growing hatred in their eyes
Before the sunrise all of us will die

I face the end
Sorrows disted
Into the depths of no return

Into the depths of no return
Into the depths

My soul is tortured by demons of the dead
I'm bound for nowhere with destination grave
My pending burden
To suffer for my sins
The final curtain will fall when darkness wins
