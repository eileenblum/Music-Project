Slimy, rotten bastards
Eating from my grave
Better leave this corpse undone
Soon, you'll feel my rage
I will change your passion
To things beyond your mind
Before you touch my bloody guts
Your flesh will be mine

Disturbance of my peace
Deep down underneath
Longing for revenge
The savagery commands

Slimy, rotten bastards
Gnawing off my bones
Leave my rotten corpse alone
Before I'll take your soul
Blood, guts, putrid flesh
You will rot alive
Slash, slice, chopped in half
Erosion of your bowels

Carnal Devourment
Carnal Devourment
