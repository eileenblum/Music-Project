[music: Mike / lyrics: Bastian]

Property, of a million dead lives
Victims, of the prophecy
Slaughtered, for the profit of lies
In agony, we'll decease

Shattered we lie
Slaughtered we die
In times of decay
Afraid of something new

Suffer in pain
Terrorizer
Perished by law
Eyes of the dead I saw

Primacy, is the claim of the wild
Darkness, upon our graves
Waiting, to be slaughtered at dawn
The sunlight is no more to rise
