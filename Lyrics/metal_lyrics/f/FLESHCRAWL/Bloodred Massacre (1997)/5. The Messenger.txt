[music: Mike, Bastian / lyrics: Bastian / guitar-solo: Stefan]

I'm the messenger, turning truth to lies
Watch my precious act, to disorganize
Turn around your will, leave you in good faith
Take your heart and soul, shattering disgrace

Never feel save as I lurk by your side
Still I am seeking access to your mind
I'm catching up, there's no way out
I will not stop 'till I am satisfied

Listen to me, won't you take my advice
Hell is on earth, downwards you ride
Try to escape, maybe you'll succeed
You should have known I'm the king of deceit

Crying for help, you're left alone
Unbound are the ones who are lying in wait

Unfold your power, build up your inner
Strength to dispraise, start the fire
Awareness will save you from death
Reproducing the revolution
