[music: Mike / lyrics: Sven, Bastian]

Enforcing evil
I kill your soul
I'm gonna live through your pain
Beyond retrieval
You'll fear your dreams
The way I am drives you insane

Obscure visions
Distorted by a withered shade
Shapeless demons
Fade away with the light of dawn
Unreal shadows
Turned to their incarnation
Ancient appearance
Crawled up through the veil of dawn

Lifeless bodies
Of flesh and skin
You're gonna bleed for my sins
Pretending power
Your soul is mine
You're gonna fall as I win

Lost souls - never they die, never they feel
Dark dreams - longing for death, never redeem
Lost souls - come with the dusk, go with the light
Crippled - mind is in pain, bleeding for me
