[music: Mike, Stefan / lyrics: Sven]

Shroud of velvet, ebony coffin
Deathly pale like peaceful sleep
The past looks back with thousand faces
From the confluent hiding of time

Break through your mental derangement
Wait for the inevitable end
Pray to your lord for forgiveness
While you hope to bear it up well

Hope you reach the sphere you dreamt of
Broken dreams seem so dreadful, grotesque
Slowly all your power's fading
Your own life shines so worthless, sinful

Embraced by silent shadows
Loneliness, guides all your path
No one's left to hear you
Alone with your fear of death

Flame of life lost in unknown
Fear of death crawls inside
Now you lost your energy of living
While you taste the chalice of death
Deep depressions enter your mind
Why doesn't god hear all your cries
Now the chapter's finished, it's your turn to die
You are in agony, death laughs at your cry
