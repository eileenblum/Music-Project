[music: Stefan, Mike / lyrics: Bastian]

See - Open your eyes - Take a look back
Find truth in the past
Your mind - Gliding through time -
Reminds you of signs - Once seen, but defied

Trapped - By paranoid dreams -
World inside the skull - Whatever that means
Lies - Built upon rules, reject and refuse
Deny and abuse

The paradox of life
Preserve and destroy
Heal the scars of the past
Disappear into the void

Emerging - From the depths of a realm beyond
New order to come
Tesselated - Low forms of life - In your hands
Deforming arts - A new term in this age - Overcome
Oblivion - Obtained by obliteration

Born to be sacrificed - Homicide
The blood, the pain, the age of chaos -
Burnt into your mind
