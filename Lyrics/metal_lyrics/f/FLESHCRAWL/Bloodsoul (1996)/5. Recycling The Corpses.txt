[music: Mike, Stefan / lyrics: Bastian / guit. solo: Stefan]

Maimed, killed, stabbed
Slain, shot, sliced
Hung, burnt, chopped
Multiple ways to die

Once you've been born
You're living your life
Trying your best
Not to be left
Kind of a race
Part of a maze
Your last day will come
You never know how
Some people can choose
The others just lose
Game over and out
When all lights go down

Dead and gone - Buried deep - In the mud
Had your chance, but you only took and never stopped
Never cared - For anyone - Anything
Await your soul - To be taken away

Away

Now it's dark - Freezing cold - Down below
Lying there - Find yourself - Paralysed
Got no fear - Unanimated - Not alone
Be aware - Of all the things yet to come
On the edge - Side by side - Final place
Just one step - In your mind - Realize
No return - You deserve - What you get
Decay brought you back - Where you belong
