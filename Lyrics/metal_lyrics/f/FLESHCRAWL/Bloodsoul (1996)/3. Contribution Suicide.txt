[music: Mike / lyrics: Bastian]

Bloody rain - Drippin' down from the sky
Discrepancy - The war between low and high
Former ages - Reign of superstition, magic rites
Dark powers - Influencing people's life

Holy priest - Absolution for all sins
Crusades - In the name of the holy church
Burn in hell - The damned now rot inside
Last chance - Was contribution suicide
Freedom of thoughts - No longer exists

Cries, cries, cries, cries

No place for changes - Uphold the flag of war
Millions already deceased - Even more to die
All time is wasted - Too late to forgive
Now the battle rages - Until no one is left

Cries, cries, cries, cries

Once so bright - The future's now dark
A crowd held down - The inferior race
Like the prophecy said - Don't deny the signs
T R U S T - First step into slavery

Interior plague - Intoxication of humanity
Twisted minds - Formed this chaos called world
Inheritance - Of the glorious dead
This hell called war - Beyond imagination
