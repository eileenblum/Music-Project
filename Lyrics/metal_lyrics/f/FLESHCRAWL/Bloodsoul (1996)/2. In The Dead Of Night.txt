[music: Mike, Bastian / lyrics: Bastian]

Bodies over bodies - One by one
They got sliced - By this bastard son
Helpless victim of an unreal horror mind
In one second takes you to the other side

Is it just a dream - Or is it real
Shaken by a shiver - Psychopathic ride
In the moment when you hesitate you feel
Sharp blades severing flesh and bones like peeled

Creep - On your knees
Pray - Mercy me
My task is search, find and kill again
I was born as a modern jack for everyone

Murder is the case - In which he believes
Dissecting his victims - Expert in human anatomy

Live and let die - Decision is mine
Under the eyes of the sun
Human leftovers - Lifeless remains
All means to my abnormal plans

Suffer this hell - Find your way into
This horror trip without return
Pack and send off - Numberless parts
Until the next episode starts
