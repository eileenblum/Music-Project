Dreaming of the dead
Visions of my death
Darkness is my friend
Till the bloody end
Sharing deepest pain
Fear drives me insane
Hate is my belief
Ever since I lived

Carved in flesh, piece by piece
You're gasping for air as I squeeze
In my eyes, there's no life
Feeding my ears with your cries

Carved in flesh
I see the sign of death
Carved in flesh
Your torture I confess
Carved in flesh
Your body's aching for
Carved in flesh
I smell the blood of you(rs)

Terrorize and torturize
I'm the tormentor of flesh
In my mind, no compromise
Creating the art of your death

Carved in flesh
I see the sign of death
Carved in flesh
Your torture I confess
Carved in flesh
Your body's aching for
Carved in flesh
I smell the blood of you(rs)

You're screaming and crying
And soon You'll die
You suffer, you bastard
Your soul is mine

Dreaming of the dead
Visions of my death
Darkness is my friend
Till the bloody end
Sharing deepest pain
Fear drives me insane
Hate is my belief
Ever since I lived

Carved in flesh, piece by piece
You're gasping for air as I squeeze
In my eyes, there's no life
Feeding my ears with your cries

Carved in flesh
I see the sign of death
Carved in flesh
Your torture I confess
Carved in flesh
Your body's aching for
Carved in flesh
I smell the blood of you(rs)

Carved in Flesh
Carved in Flesh
