We saw them approach
Through the rising dawn
With their giant war machine
And their deadly spawn

We fought to resist
From day till night
(But) their hate was merciless
We had to die...

All the victims killed
(So) innocent and weak
I still hear the cries of war
In my dreams they bleed

Our rotten souls
Forever lost
I saw them feast upon
My dying blood...

I saw them feast upon
My dying blood...

Out for the final wrath
(With) blood on our hands
Annihilate the path
Through hostile land
Drifting through killing fields
Alive and dead
Craving infernal fire
With blood stained desire...

I saw them feast upon
My dying blood...

Some ages passed
Still we can't forget
Extermination from the past
Our hate will last

They cry for peace
For a dying race
No mercy, face to face
and let the weapons bleed...

The dead will feast upon
My dying blood...
