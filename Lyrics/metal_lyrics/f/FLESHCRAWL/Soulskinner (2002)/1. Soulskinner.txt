I am dead
Hunting souls
Feel my wrath
In blood I bathe

Death and passion
Blood and flesh
Suffer eternally
I'm the bastard
The evil dead
Master of cruelty

Soulskinner
Skin my soul
Soulskinner
Forever blood will flow

I'm hunting you
I'm at your back
I will attack
Your soul is mine
So is your skin
I crush your spine
I steal your soul
I eat your flesh
I show you death
I bring you pain
You'll go insane
Your death, my gain

Soulskinning passion
Human flesh I need
Soulskinning pleasure
Forever blood I seek

I want you dead
I bring you hell
My hate will kill
For me you bleed
I drink your blood
I'll never stop

Soulskinner
Skin my soul
Soulskinner
Forever blood will flow

I am dead
Hunting souls
Feel my wrath
In blood I bathe

Death and passion
Blood and flesh
Suffer eternally
I'm the bastard
The evil dead
Master of cruelty

Soulskinner
Skin my soul
Soulskinner
Forever blood will flow

I'm hunting you
I'm at your back
I will attack
Your soul is mine
So is your skin
I crush your spine
I steal your soul
I eat your flesh
I show you death
I bring you pain
You'll go insane
Your death, my gain

Soulskinner
Skin my soul
Soulskinner
Forever blood will flow
