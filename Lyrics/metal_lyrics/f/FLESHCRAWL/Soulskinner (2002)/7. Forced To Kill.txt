Kill the pigs of war
Pain and fear no more
Kill to save my back
Hell and blood attacks

Forced to kill I rise
Death before my eyes
(The) beast of war in sight
Forced to kill I fight

The war machine
A deadly force so mean
A sky so black
The war machine attacks

Forced to hate I kill
Seas of blood I spill
Fast and mean I strike
Kill to stay alive

No retreat, no defeat
Seems that this battle won't end
War till death, relentless
Fight to the last and defend

Fields of blood cry
Marching to die
Scorching the land
Got no repent

Forced to kill I rise
Master in/of disguise
Spread the pain, the war
(like) never seen before

Death and blood will reign
Forced to reign in pain
Lots have lost their faith
Cuts the human race

Leave behind the weak
Strength in war we seek
Burning years to come
The dark ain't got no sun

Burning, fields of war, the massacre starts
I creep, through the dark, prepare the fatal attack
Control, the war machine, launch the deadly assault
Escape, the firestorm, turns life to dust
