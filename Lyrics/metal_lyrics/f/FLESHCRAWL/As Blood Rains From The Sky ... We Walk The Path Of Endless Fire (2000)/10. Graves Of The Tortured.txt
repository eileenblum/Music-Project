[Music: Mike, Stefan / Lyrics: Bastian]

Graves of the tortured - Burning in pain
Night of the living dead - Twisted, insane
Rise of the haunted - Visions in black
I am the chosen one to desecrate

Visions from the past
In blood and gore I last

Creatures from beneath, rising from the deep
Rotting in decay, Hell is the place I will stay

Kill you to survive - Burning your skill and your eyes
Sucking your blood from your heart - Soon your life falls apart
Rush of blood drives me on - Cutting the flesh from your bones
Take out your guts - Disembowel
Visions in black of your soul

Creatures from beneath, rising from the deep
Rotting in decay, Hell is the place I will stay
