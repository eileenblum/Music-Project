[Music: Mike / Lyrics: Bastian]

Dark and cold as my body awakes
Deep in the tomb of the night
Woke by the call of the undead I rise
Revenging their souls before the light

Prepare the absymal path - Beware the creation of wrath
Out on frozen blood - Out to kill in wrath

Sent from hell as the creature of the night - The light I must not see
Twisted and burned I'm a slave to black art - The forces of death I will lead

Out in the night - Hunting and haunting
Revenging the lost tortured souls  I won't find no rest
Till I'm ending this quest - Before I return to my grave

Messenger of the dead and the lost - Destined to bring out their wrath
Protecting the unholy caverns of hell - Witchery's demonic spell

Hacking and killing, and strangling to death - The victim is now sacrificed
Nothing is sacred, but evil is real - Feasting a dead carnal meal

Death is all I see - My immortality
Out on frozen blood - To teat their souls apart

Beware the creation of wrath

As I kill
