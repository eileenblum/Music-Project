[Music: Mike, Tobias / Lyrics: Bastian]

Buried deep into the tomb
Still alive with bleeding wounds
In agony I suffocate - I will return to seal your fate

I will be back to take revenge - To slay the bastard I will commence
To nail your body to the cross - And watch you die without remorse

COld suicide nation - Born to kill itself
Emptiness is burning me - Too blind to find ourselves

Impure massacre of bloody souls - The masterkiller reigns, the truth unfolds
Cause human life doesn't bother me - I kill and kill again to set my spirit free
Impure massacre of bloody souls - I can't remind, I can't control
Impure massacre of bloody souls - Unleash the beast to start the bloody ritual

Till death do us part

Sons of hell in torment - Slaves of torture rise - Suffer from eternal pain - I'm the enemy of life

Sons of hell in torment - Slaves of torture rise - Suffer from eternal pain - As I stare into your eyes
Set the corpse on fire - And Watch it with delight - Listen to the silent voice - I'm the enemy of life
