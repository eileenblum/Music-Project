[Music: Mike / Lyrics: Bastian, Stefan]

Await your final prayer, at midnight on the stake
Eternal fire burns your flesh, your soul is what I take
That's my proof that I don't care about your weak opinion
You had your choice of life or death, now enter my dominion

Apparently evil, destructive and mean
I rise from the coffin, to spread hate supreme
When darkness sets in and night comes to town
My sweet reign of terror, in your blood I drown

Embraced by evil - When night sets in
They wake my sleeping memories -Haunting nightmare
Pain extreme - The souls of night inside my dreams to see

Apparently evil, vicious and bad - I'm sipping your blood, until the last drop
No life left to save, no heaven to praise - No dreams left to chase, just brutal embraced

Embraced by evil - You're destined to see
The glance of my deceiving eyes - Extrication from the chains unseen
Devitalized - Embraced by evil minds

Cold eyes, delirious mind, the evil messiah in me
Afterlife, I cross your soul, deep down to set you free
Cry out, purged from your sins, beyond retrieval
Lay down, feel the relief, embraced by evil

Pale skin and severed nerves, forever no pain I will feel
Undead life, no heart to beat, enemies forced to kneel
Lay down and feel my touch, there's no retrieval
Give up, I grip your soul, embraced by evil
