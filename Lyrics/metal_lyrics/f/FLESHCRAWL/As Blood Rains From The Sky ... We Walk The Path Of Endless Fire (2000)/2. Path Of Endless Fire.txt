[Music: Mike / Lyrics: Bastian]

Path of endless fire, bloody ride, the burning of my soul
Paint twisting agony, killing me, I'll take the coffin ride
I feel my hollow breathing all in me, is emptiness inside
I feel my life is ceasing me, painfully, as life and death unite

Seas of red, I crossed before
Born dead, I take your soul, I come to life
Memories, still haunting me
Involving madness feeds my kill throughout the night

Path of endless fire, in my mind, I see the demons dance
They watch my body suffer, feast upon, my blood soaked misery
Afterlife confessions, buried lies, death inflicted murder
Spirit stained by blackened cries,
The future holds what death decides

Path of endless fire
Path of endless fire
Path of endless fire
Path of endless fire
