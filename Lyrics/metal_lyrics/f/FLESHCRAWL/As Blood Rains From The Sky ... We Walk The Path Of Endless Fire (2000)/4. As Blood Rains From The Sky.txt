[Music: Bastian &amp; Solo: Stefan, Tobias / Lyrics: Bastian]

As blood rains from the sky

Kill the fuckin' bastards - Spill their goddamn blood
The war machine is raging hard, the horror never stops
Killing on adrenaline - The devil's in my back
Unleashed hate defeats my fear, I shred to live

As blood rains from the sky
Marching to die, hell on earth, external extinction applies
As blood rains from the sky
Bringer of pain, monger of death, the human race gone insane

Screams throughout the firestorm - The enemy draws near
I get myself up out into, the battlefield of fear
I see the mangled bodies - Victimized by war
I join the madness to stay alive, as the bullets cut me down

Hit by hostile fire - My warhead's still alive
I crawl my flesh into the trench, destruction in my mind

I'm lying here like helpless - Bleeding fuckin' wounds
Conflict of my inner senses, unconsciousness comes soon
Mass annihilation - Redolence of death
Prepare myself for the attack
To kill the innocent ones ahead
