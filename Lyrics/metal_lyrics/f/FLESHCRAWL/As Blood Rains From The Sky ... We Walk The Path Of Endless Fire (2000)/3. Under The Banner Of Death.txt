[Music: Mike, Tobias / Lyrics: Bastian]

Blacken the day, the sky above is dark
Massive decay, I feed the demon's heart

With lies - All I hear is lies
Contradiction overseen - Only fuckin' lies

I raise the dead - Revive the ensanguined past - No life will last

Under the banner of death

Death worship nation, punishment we'll face
Longing for the final day, we receive the dark embrace
Set out to die, perishment so far away
Crushed upon the truth of time
Each day we live to see the same

Let's go fuckin' die

Death beyond redemption, we suffer piece by piece
Rapidly changing pace of life, what god should we please?
Eternal eclipse, let darkness reign this world
Soulless to the core we spill, the blood of centuries

Let's go fuckin' die
Under the banner of death
