[Music &amp; Solo: Tobias / Lyrics: Bastian]

Speaking throught my mind
Staring through my eyes
My inner freedom dies

The dark side of my soul - No longer to control

Dark to the core - Echoing voices
The dead are calling my name - I'm dying inside
Just to break free - They leave me lying in pain

Visions to explore - What I was living for - I'm dead forever more

Yet to be born - My future is torn
I'm lying deep in misery - Life is no more
Death is for sure - I'm facing darkness endlessly

Enter the other side - Drifting through the night - I feel the dead arrive

The dark side of my soul - Ragin uncontrolled

The dark side of my soul - The dark side of my soul
