Do you feel him coming
The harvester of souls
Companion for so many years
History unfolds

How who walks the shadows
He who stands behind
The one who's watching all your ways
The master in disguise

He's listening - the reaper
For anthems - of death

Now the scythe is sharpened
You will meet your doom
He's been waiting for so long
Death begins to roam

He who walks the shadows
Who awaits your day
The one who's watching all your ways
The master of all life

He's listening - the reaper
For anthems - of death

He will reach your soul
Thirsting for your tears
He still hungers for your flesh
Feasting on your feats

Merciless, he takes your life
Your epitaph already known
He's the master of disguise
The harvester of souls

Now his work is finished
He collects your soul
Takes it to the underworld
In hell you'll be reborn

Can you hear his laughter
He who never rests
Looking for another soul
Another life he gets

While he takes so many souls
Collects so many lives
Feasting on your fear of death
That's why he never dies
