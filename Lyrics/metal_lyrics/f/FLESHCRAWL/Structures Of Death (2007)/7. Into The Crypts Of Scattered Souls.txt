Into the crypts of scattered souls
Known as the place where death unfolds
Where my flesh will find a spot
Into the crypts of hell I rot

[chorus]
I just seek your blood (blood)
I just like your guts (guts)
I just need your flesh (flesh)
I just want your death (death)

[verse]
Into the crypts of scattered souls
Known as the place where death unfolds
Where my flesh will find a spot
Into the crypts of hell I rot
In a world where darkness reigns
Known as the place where pain sustains
Down the deadly crypts of hell
Where the passion of hatred dwells

[repeat chorus]

Me, myself, and I
Just want you to die
Leave you ripped and torn
Make your life unborn
Legacy of hell
Evil powers dwell
Feast upon the dead
Locked up in my head

[repeat verse]

[repeat chorus]
