I live in your dark dreams
I love to hear your screams
Your fer my darkest need
I am the demon seed
I tear away your flesh
The meat so warm and fresh
You know your time is near
I am your deepest fear

Structures of death
Structures of death

I'll get you, I'll take you, I'll bring you down
Relentless, with distress, evil and mean
You'll suffer, discover, structures of death
Becoming, the victim, sets your last breath

I'll get you, I'll take you, I'll bring you down
Relentless, with distress, evil and mean
You'll suffer, discover, structures of death
Becoming, the victim, sets your last breath

I live to feel your pain
To feast upon your brain
Your blood is bittersweet
Inside me feels complete
My hands rip out your eyes
They will become my prize
Through them I see your fear
It seems to dark and clear

Structures of death
Structures of death
