[verse 1]
Into the shadow of death
Gasping for your last breath
Into the realm of the void
All hope gets destroyed
Fighting the war of the dead
Slain by the evil you dread
Caught by the devil's spell
Condemned to rot in hell

[chorus]
War of the dead [x8]

[verse 2]
Into the claws of hell
Rotting in your dead shell
Spreading the wings of death
Inhale the lethal breath
Fighting the war of the dead
Spilling your blood unshed
Burning the left behind
The downfall of mankind

I'm dying for the dead [x4]

I'm rotting with the dead [x4]

[repeat verse 1]

[repeat chorus]

[repeat verse 2]
