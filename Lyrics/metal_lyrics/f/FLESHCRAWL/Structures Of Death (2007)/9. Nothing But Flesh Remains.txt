Nothing but flesh remains
Flesh remains

[chorus]
Within the veil
I'll grind your bones
Disperse your guts
Engraved in stone
Your finest skin
Conceals my sins
Your purest blood
Prolongs my life

Nothing but flesh remains - flesh remains

Within the veil
Your death prevails
Your flesh remains
The breed retains
My evil soul
Feeds my ghouls
My demon's greed
Therefore you bleed

I just wanna feast upon [x7]
I just wanna feast upon... your flesh

Nothing but flesh remains - flesh remains

Wallow myself in your blood
I revel in your flesh
Caskets shape my daily path
I satisfy my wrath
Longing for the final touch
My spirit needs so much
Stories of my legacy
Successor of my laughs

Nothing but flesh remains - flesh remains

[repeat verse]

Nothing but flesh remains... [x3]
Nothing but - Nothing but flesh remains [x6]
