[verse]
In silence, I listen to distant cries
Echoes, resounding throughout the night
Sick voices are milling into my head
The suffering of corpses, straight from the dead
Scared and shocked, staring into the black
Gone so far, there's no turning back
The eyes of perdition, rot in the mud
The signs of deception, written in blood

Written in blood - my fate, sealed by your death
Written in blood - your flesh, feeds my chest
Written in blood - your skull embellishes my grave
Written in blood

Blood for your blood, die for your death
Grave for your flesh, forever more the soulskinner in black

Written in blood - my fate, sealed by your death
Written in blood - your flesh, feeds my chest
Written in blood - your skull embellishes my grave
Written in blood

[repeat verse]
