[chorus]
A spirit dressed in black, dressed in black
A spirit dressed in black, dressed in black

[verse]
Into the void, where everything turns to black
Life gets destroyed, when evil forces wreck
Throughout the past, condemned to misery
Darkness will last, for centuries to come
For centuries to come

[repeat chorus]

Spirit of death, taking control of me
Spiritual mess, within my sanity
Driving me on, attrition of my soul
Drifting below, beyond my mind's control

Beyond my mind's control

Up against the wall
No one there to call
Insanity is back
A life drowned in black
Meet my inner fear
Perishing is near
Consciousness I lack
My spirit's dressed in black

Vitality's running low
Vitality's running low

[repeat chorus]

[repeat verse]
