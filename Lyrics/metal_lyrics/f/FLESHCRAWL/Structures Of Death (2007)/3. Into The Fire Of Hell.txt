Into the fire
With death on my side

Falling down into the fire
Where the beast awaits
Pounded into nothingness
Where my body fades

Massive tribe of evil hordes
Want to see me burn
Grab my soul to please the lord
There is no return

Into the fire
With death on my side

Into the fire
Of hell

[repeat]
