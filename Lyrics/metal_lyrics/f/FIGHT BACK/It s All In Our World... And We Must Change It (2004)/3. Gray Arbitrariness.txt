Sadistic bastards become the stupid cops
They just wanna sneer on law-abiding us
There are no thoughts in their dumb heads
They want to rise themself, so ACAB

Stupid bastards
It's tha gray arbitrariness
Stupid bastards
We don't need the dullness
Stupid bastards
It's tha gray arbitrariness
Stupid bastards

Coming down the street is no more safely
Stupid bastards're here, prepare to be abject
Violent attack, there're no wrong we doing
Instead of catching criminals, there're people on the rack

Stupid bastards
It's tha gray arbitrariness
Stupid bastards
We don't need the dullness
Stupid bastards
It's tha gray arbitrariness
Stupid bastards

Stupid cops
Have no brains
Stupid cops
Brainless shame
Stupid cops
It's arbitrariness
Stupid cops
What happens next?
