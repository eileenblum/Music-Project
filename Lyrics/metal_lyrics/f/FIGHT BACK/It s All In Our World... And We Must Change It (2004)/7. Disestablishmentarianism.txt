[New Society Of Anarchists cover version]

[We don't make drag-and-drop, just inspirated. We decided to rise and fight too]

Are you willing to fight for your cause
Are you willing to die for your cause
Don't stand in silence, don't stand unheard
Speak your mind for all it's worth

Rise
Stand up and fight
Rise
We must rise
