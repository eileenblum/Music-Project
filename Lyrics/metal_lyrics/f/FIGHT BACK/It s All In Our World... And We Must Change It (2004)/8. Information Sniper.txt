[Discordance Axis cover version]

[We don't make drag-and-drop too:)), just inspirated. May be it's delusion:)))]

Reassure my, security obsession
Beneath column headers and appraisals
Pages and pages to define
The eclipse of averages
Intently grinding in a circle
Piece by... piece
There's no joy on the nail head
When the hammer hits.
Dutifully hand over
Or regularly confiscated
A hit forfeited for a delusion
Or extra paranoia insecurity
