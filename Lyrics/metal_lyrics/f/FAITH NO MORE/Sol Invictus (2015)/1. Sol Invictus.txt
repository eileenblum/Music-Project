[Verse 1]
I'm coming, Lord, I'm on my way
Worshiping at the altar of know why
Can't remember which God is my wine
Can't repent if I'm wrong; impartial
Empty rituals, trinkets and fossils
And now, Lord, I'm on my way (my way)
Amen

[Chorus 1:]
Peace ain't coming our way
But the sun keeps burning my face
Where's my faith?
My blasphemy

Keep singin', Lord, I'm on my way
...Home

[Verse 2]
Floorboards and the ceilings are creaking
And the roof is old and leaking
But looking up high to the heavens
How can we declare our independence
From evolution and penance (our way)

[Chorus 2:]
Sin ain't coming our way
But the sun keeps burning my face
When's my faith renewing today?
I believe in something, I think
Where's my faith
My monastery
