When lonesome stood over me
A future shadow
Her ghost stood there, sang to me
Farewell, so long

Iâll awake you
From this living sleep
Weâll walk the shore
Where you were born
In bed with me

Pull the white sheet off your face
March forward, my son
A battle beyond frozen years
Only for dog's ears

We will rise from the killing floor
Like a matador

A stained glass
of bovine eyes
Can see right through
Every `dreams-don't-lie'

Letters will trace every step
Out of this world
With every ditch, every ditch

We will be when you will be no more, no more

Be no more
The Stained glass
Of the hangmanâs ass
Would've served you well
Now weâre coming back

Out of the weight
Of these ghosts
Weâll jump the gates
And live to rise, we will rise

We will rise from the killing floor
Like a matador

Let the dead live
May the dead live
And the dead live
What more can we give?
Let the dead live
May the dead live
And the dead live
Dead live.
