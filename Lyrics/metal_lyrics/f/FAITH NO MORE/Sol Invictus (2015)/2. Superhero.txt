Go Go Go Goâ¦

A Superhero,
I'm tugging on your cape
Tell me will your sons
Know their father one day

Leader of men
Leader of men
Get back in your cage
Will you be one of them?

Like an American drug
Makes a mean cock crow
Can't you care or tell a praise?
Makes a superman a-glow

Go Go Go

With the S on your chest
You're feeling like a god
An order of animal
We try to find a rod

Superhero, Sensei, mirror, smiling, hiding, riding, flying,
Super, jamming, smiling, falling

Leader of men
Leader of men
Get back in your cage
Ain't no grave gonna hold this body down

The sunrise is here to save us now
Oh, its all erased
The storybook years
(of) Sweet memories
Wash it away
Wash it away
Wash it away

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go!

Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
...
Will you be one of them?

Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be one of them?

Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be one of them?

Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be on of them?

Go go go...
