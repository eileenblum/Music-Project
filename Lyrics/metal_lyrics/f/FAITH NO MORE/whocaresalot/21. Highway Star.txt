[originally by Deep Purple]Nobody going to take my car I am going to race it to the ground
Nobody going beat my car it is going to break the speed of sound
It is a killing machine it has got everything
Like a driving power big fat tyres and everything
I love it and I need it I bleed it it is a wild hurricane
All right hold tight I am a highway star

Nobody going to take my girl I am going to keep her to the end
Nobody going to have my girl she stays close on every bend
She is a killing machine she has got everything
Like a moving mouth body control and everything
I love her I need her I seed her she turns me on
All right hold on tight I am a highway star

Nobody going to take my head I got speed inside my brain
Nobody going to steal my head now that I am on the road again
I am in heaven again I have got everything
Like a moving ground an open road and everything
I love it and I need it I seed it eight cylinders all mine
All right hold on tight I am a highway star
