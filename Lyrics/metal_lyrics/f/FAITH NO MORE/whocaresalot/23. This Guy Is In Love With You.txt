[originally by Herb Alpert]You see this guy this guy's in love with you
You see this guy this guy's in love with you

I'm in love who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell we know each other very well
How can I show you I'm glad I got to know you because

I've heard some talk they say you think I'm fine
I'm in love and what I'd do to make you mine,
Tell me now, is it so don't let me be the last to know.

My hands are shaking don't let my heart keep breaking because
I need your love I want your love
Say you're in love in love with this guy if not I will just die.

Thanks to nirajpandya for sending track #23 lyrics.
