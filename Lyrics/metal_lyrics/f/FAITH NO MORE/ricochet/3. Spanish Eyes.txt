[written by Kaempfert / Singleton / Snyder]Blue Spanish eyes tear-drops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry this is just adiÃ³s and not goodbye
Soon I'll return bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say Si Si say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Blue Spanish eyes prettiest eyes in all Old Mexico
True Spanish eyes please smile at me once more before I go
Dear, I'll return bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say Si Si say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your spinach eyes will wait for me

Thanks to nirajpandya for sending tracks ## 2, 3 lyrics.
