CAFFEINE
Pour shame all over us
Harden into a crust
- - - cement - - -
Forget the glamour and
Mumble a jackhammer
- - - under your breath - - -
Hide your face in the curtains
Better unsaid, so close
And it rolls off the tongue
ALMOST
The world expects the pose
Perfectly natural
- - - loosen up - - -
Smearing wet concrete
And swearing you'll never be
- - - caught - - -
At your weakest, etched in stone
And we're frozen here, peeking

ALMOST, sweet talk, CAFFEINE
Make contact
Up to my neck
I confess in quicksand
"But it's so easy for you"
"There's always one thing"
"Do you have something to tell me?"
"Say something"
"Anything"
"I'm warning you"
"I'm warning you"
"I'm fucking you"
"I'm warning you"
"Relax"
"It's just a phase"
"You'll grow out of it"
Believe anything anyone ever tells you
It's not funny any more
It's thing you hate the most
The thing you hate the most
The thing you hate ALMOST
