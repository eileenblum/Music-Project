One day you're thinking that maybe you're feeling better
And you're probably an OK person, if only you had a job...
Through the hollow tombs can see them
Through their mouths I can hear them praying for pain
But it's only a game

Listen, man, I know
That things are really rough
And everybody gets you
And life is really tough
But I know that deep down inside
There's a feeling that rides
All the way to the end

Thursday you sit in your room with the lights turned out
And you don't answer the door
Friday morning looks sunny and bright
Like it's going to be a good day
And it would be if only you had a job

Time is on your side, you're young
Don't waste your time today
