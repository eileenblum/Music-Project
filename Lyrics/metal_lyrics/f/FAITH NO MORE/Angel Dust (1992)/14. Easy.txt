I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed
Yeah...Ooo

That's why I'm easy
Aah, aah, aah, aah
I'm easy like Sunday morning
Aah, aah, aah, aah
That's why I'm easy
Aah, aah, aah, aah
Easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high
So high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me
Ohhhh babe...
oohh!

That's why I'm easy
Aah, aah, aah, aah
I'm easy like Sunday morning
Aah, aah, aah, aah
That's why I'm easy
Aah, aah, aah, aah
Easy like Sunday morning
yeah that's about it  but one thing i looked those lyrics up in an another site
 and there was this
"Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
I paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I'm trying to fake it"
