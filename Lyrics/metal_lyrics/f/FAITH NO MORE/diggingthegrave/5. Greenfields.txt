[Limited Edition Bonus Track][originally by The Brothers Four]Once there were green fields kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above
Once they were part of an everlasting hope
We were the lovers who strolled through green fields

Green fields are gone now parched by the sun
Gone from the valley where rivers used to run
Gone with the cold wind that swept through to my heart
Gone with the lovers who let the dreams depart
Where are the green fields where we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me nothing is now left for me to see
But I keep on waiting until you return I keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy when your heart's on the roam
You can't be happy until you bring it home home to the green fields

Thanks to nirajpandya for sending track #5 lyrics.
