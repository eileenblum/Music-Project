The landlord's here to visit they're blasting disco down below
Says I'm doubling the rent because the buildings condemned
You are going to help me buy City Hall
But we can, you know we can we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord man

I tell them turn on the water I tell them turn on the heat tells me all you ever do is complain
Then they search the place when I'm not here but we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord let's lynch the landlord let's lynch the landlord man

There's rats chewing up the kitchen roaches up to my knees
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau until the rain pours through the ceiling
But we can, you know we can let's lynch the landlord man
