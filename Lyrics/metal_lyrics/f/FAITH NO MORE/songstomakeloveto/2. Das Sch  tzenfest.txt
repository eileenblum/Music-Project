We went to the shooting-match,
Speaking for myself she looks like a German girl
Black-brown is the hazelnut black-brown is her hair
My girl, days lie down, shit, of course not with him
The shooting-match, never seen again

We're making love in the pigs trough
My trousers are exploding because of my dick
She thought I was a her was like an ice-bone.
My girl, days lie down, shit, of course not with him
The shooting-match, never seen again

Bell dog dog away dog away ass hole dog away
She makes a white-sausage out of my dick she's dancing and shoe platter
Her arm pit was fresh and smelled like summer morning summer morning
Girl her bra shit, weekend! But not with her
The shooting-match, never seen again never seen again.
