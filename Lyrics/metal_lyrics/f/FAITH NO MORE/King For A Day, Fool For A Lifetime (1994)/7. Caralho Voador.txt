They all know me by my car
They all know I'm gone, but not how far
I'm heading straight down 101
I'm going to go and get me some

My lips are movin' but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down

EU NÃO POSSO DIRIGIR
E AGORA APARECE
MEU DEDO ENTERRADO
NO MEU NARIZ

My lips anr movin' but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
