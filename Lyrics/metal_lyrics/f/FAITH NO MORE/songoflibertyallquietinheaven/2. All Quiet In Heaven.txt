Working on until the light with carefully smart for
Dancing in the mirror avoiding my reflection
Listening to your dreamful, awaiting my selection
Take me away, I can't take anymore 
I'm waiting in line for another to come
To make me see the sun
I'd love you much more if you left me alone 
It's all so quiet in heaven heaven

No mercy for the combat
But your make in doubt always shine
And all to lose, in another stake
And all to lose, in another stake
I'd love you much more if you left me alone 
It's all so quiet in heaven heaven

I'm hoping heaven will begin
I'm hoping I can face the fear
Dancing in the mirror avoiding my reflection
Listening to your dreamful, awaiting my selection
Take me away
