Time's up!
They're all around
No chance for escape
I see my friends on the ground
Is this our fate?

All hope is gone!
Greed turns to despair's dawn
Our might is fading away
This siege seems to be our downfall

They came with fire and strength
They set our town in flames
Once so beautiful land of peace
Now inferno where my heart bleeds

And now when the day turns to night
We've seen how weak we are
Our home has burnt down
So prepare to fight or we will die

They were all around
Left behind just ashes on the ground
But I will stay on the trail of honour
I won't stop as long as I breathe on my own

All hope is gone!
Greed turns to despair's dawn
Our might is fading away
This siege seems to be our downfall
