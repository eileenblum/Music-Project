The gilded frames of a perfect nation
Melt in flaming despair

Fire burns and melt the structures
That slammer embraced by fear

Ember burns my feet
Heat captures my body

Cold sweat drains from my face
We're under a siege in this place

Stay together, we will fight as once
In this place of disease
There's no future for our sons
In the ruins of defeat

We'll fight as once
No future for our sons
For our sons...

The gilded frames of a perfect nation
Melted in flaming despair

Fire burned and melted the structures
That slammer embraced by fear

Stay together, we will fight as once
In this place of disease
There's no future for our sons
In the ruins of defeat

For our sons...
