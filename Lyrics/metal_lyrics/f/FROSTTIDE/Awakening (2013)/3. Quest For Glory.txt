The quest has begun
Together we march
Our mission is clear
We shall not fear

Following this path
Our comrades will wait
We know our destination
Our reputation

The road covered with snow
The sky is turning black
Stars will show the way
This is our fate

Sharpen your swords
For this war
This is the time
We will fight

Quest for glory
Till the last breath we will fight
Write our story
The tale of victory
