Enslaved in the darkness
Rage blinds my eyes
Tortured human soul
Won't rest in peace

Give all you can
We won't give up
Before we die
We won't stop

Towards the enemy 
Pray for your life
In this nightmare
We will fight!
Everywhere
In this town
Dead people burning 
On the ground

Final chapter will be closed
Destroy my heart. Curse my soul
I will be gone. My soul will be free
Please fly like a dove without my greed

Mistakes I made once
Now those are back in my life
Now it's time to die in fear
Drain your last tear

Fight! Against the darkness, against your sins
Pray! For the last time, till the end, we'll stand!
We lost this fight. We lost this war
Now take your last breath before you die
