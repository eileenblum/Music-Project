First snow dropped to the land
I opened my hand
Saw the old date
Realized my fate

I looked last time
To the land of mine
Now I have to go
I know my role

Black ink and a book
The last step I took
Are you ready for a fight?
We'll show you our might!

Day by day
Our glory will rise
The story of us
Will rise from the dust

It's time! To raise our heads towards the sky
Last carefree sign
It's time! To change this land forever
Together

It's time! To create a new world
For us
It's time! To face the enemy for the last time
One last time

The journey has begun, under the sun
Together as once we'll fight our way
Trough the darkest times

It's time! To raise our heads towards the sky
Last carefree sign
It's time! To change this land forever
Together

It's time! To create a new world
For us
It's time! To face the enemy for the last time
One last time
