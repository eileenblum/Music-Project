Our men fall down one by one
This journey has just begun

This is the trail of mine
This might be the end of our lives
Darkness and fear on this path
There's no turning back

Raise your sword, fight with us
This battle is raw enough
Turn your head towards the sky
Now you can realize your enemies' might

Standing
Touching my scars
Waving
Reaching the stars

Try to
Find my trail
This will be gone
Oh I will stay!

Escaping to the forest, wind by our side
Waiting the enemy to show them our might
Drowning my past from my mind
Carry on hordes, remember your line!

Step by step we will march
Towards the end under the stars

This is the trail of mine
This might be the end of our lives
Darkness and fear on this path
There's no turning back

Raise your sword, fight with us
This battle is raw enough
Turn your head towards the sky
Now you can realize your enemies' might
