Usurp the values
Things will change
Betray the ally
How cruel is the world
Worship my name
Soon youâll kneel down
Unforeseen change
And new reign will begin

I canât stop time
I must live the now
Memories will remain
Time flies with the wind
But the way of the wind will change
Thereâs no way back

Dear old friend of mine
Could you understand?
Carefree life
Is not our way
Abrogate the blood oath
Itâs our turn to prevail
Weâll create a new kingdom
Your fate is written

New chapter will start in our lives
Unwritten is the end
Weâll march towards our destination
And be free again

Under the darkening sky
Wave the flaming torch
This is our time to rise

Gather together again
It might be the last time
Itâs time for final test
Before no sleep, no rest

Bow in front of me
Worship my name
Otherwise youâll taste the steel
New reign has begun

The order of precedence
The perfect harmony
Between the villagers
Torn apart, forever
The throne of might
The crown of fear
The kingdom of power
All those are now ours
