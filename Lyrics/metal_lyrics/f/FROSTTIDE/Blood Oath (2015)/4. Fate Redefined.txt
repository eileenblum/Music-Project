Back then we lived within the walls
Wide-eyed for everything
Didnât know the walls could break
The dark shade finally came

Real life nightmare no longer lasts
Now these days are reminding us from the past
Letâs start a new chapter

That day was the turning point
Which defined our way to live
This date marks the birth of our nation
And it will live in our memories

When the darkness showed its shade
Reality hit straight to my face
Uncertainty blurred my mind
But I was sure I wonât step behind

Past days are now only a memory
If those come back
We may be stricken down but we will rise
We are here to stay, we will fight

Real life nightmare no longer lasts
Letâs start a new chapter.
