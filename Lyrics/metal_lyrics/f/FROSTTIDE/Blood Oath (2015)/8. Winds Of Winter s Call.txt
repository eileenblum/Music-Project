In the top of the world you can see the suffering
What have you done? Why do you close your eyes?
From the ground a gold-plated statue arises
Arrogant smile fills its face

Towards the mountain, we looked up high
To the top we dreamed to climb
One day that dream became reality
But once on the top, you cannot climb anymore
The only way is down below

Thereâs no turning back
My thoughts are under a siege in my mind
From the ruins of defeat we build this land
Unwritten is our quest for glory

Humanâs outer shell remains the same
Inside the head the fight has just begun
Rewards and riches arode the pure humanity
The presence of evil taints the good-hearted
Is there anyone who has common sense anymore?
If I find you, please escape with me from this lunacy

Two different roads open for us
Which one should we choose?
Two different destinations await
Only one can be reached, it defines our fate

Iâm starting to lose my mind
Everything is too fine

If we continue this quest
Weâll march to the throat of death
Even if we donât gain victory
We will not regret

I know this canât last
Think a while about your past
We betrayed our allies
Fueled by anger
They will revenge

Dawn of despair arises
By the winds of winterâs call
Could this be our awakening?
The future is engraved in the stars.
