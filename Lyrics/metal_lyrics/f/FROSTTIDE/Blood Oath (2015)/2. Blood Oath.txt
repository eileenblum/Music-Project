Screams of fear drift in the wind
Those are the signs we are following
Towards death we ride
Across this land, together, side by side

Horns of war echo from the mountains
Unknown tribe descends from above
Who are they? Are they here for us?
An army is revealed by the light of dawn

Lend your hand
This is our proposal
What will you decide?

Blood Oath has been sworn
These scars are made to recall
That together we can achieve more
And now as one we are ready for this war

Wilderness unfold before me
The great unknown is what I see
Two tribes walk the same path as one
To protect this land for our sons

How this land can change
From beauty to a grave
Everything will grow back one day
And weâll see this beauty once again

Now is time to run
The might of this legacy wonât be undone
Our enemies are raising their swords
Bring it on, weâll show our force.
