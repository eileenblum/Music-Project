Exciting times are changing
Carefree era is here
Before restless times faded away
Adrenaline flowed when my enemy died

Am I traitor if I think for my own?
I just want to feel the thrill of war
Iâll do everything to bring it back again
I may be a traitor, but do I care?
Hell no!

I donât know how to live anymore
I was born to be free
In chains we slowly limp to the grave
But from that burden itâs possible to break free

The idea starts to grow in their heads
Itâs possible to get some more
Only one barrier is guarding the treasure
If we betray the allies that could be our pleasure

Traitor within!
