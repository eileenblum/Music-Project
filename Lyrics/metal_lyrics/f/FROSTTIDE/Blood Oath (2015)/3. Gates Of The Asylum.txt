Silence overwhelms my mind
A storm is coming and I see the signs
Escaping from my body trying to fly free
When is the time for massacre?
The answer isâ¦
NOW

Gates are opening
I run towards the horde
I run towards my nightmares
Iâll face my fear

The new chapter started in our lives
We closed one era and now is our time
The change is in our hands
How we utilize this chance
Leave your fears behind and remember that

As long as we are here
There is a path for hope
Choose your side and write the ending
To your tale of life
That path shows the way
To your dreams of the night
If you decide to read the chapter
Of your tale of life

Time slows down, heart rate accelerates
Our war city will tremble in the air
Till this day is gone
Forevermore

Show your force
Show your might to us

I feel a new wind blowing on my face
Whispering the question:
Do I want to stay alive?
You can try to strike us down weâre here to stay
We have found our path and weâre not going away

This is the place from the ancient stories
The kingdom of domination
Bloodstains paint the asylum
Our men still stand
