Terrified to change, terrified to lose with all of this on the line.
And why decide right now?
In the ways we thaw.
In the ways we flaw.
In the ways we stain.
In the ways we concede.
In the ways we please and in the ways we rid...
We are all just as abandoned with our thoughts as we are with our own actions.
They'll say: "The truth is really amazing but we can never reach it again."
I guess that in some ways we never know the truth exists at all.
Substitute all of these myths for a fable.
We refuse to fly with our wings in our mouths.
We refuse to fight with our fists in our mouths.
