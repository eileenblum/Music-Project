Assessing all the goals and the virtues that congealed.
Am I the sum of all that I have struggled to fulfill?
The hands of time have carried me closer to my intentions;
Thwarted the affirmation in all that I find authentic.
Justified.
I grow towards the sky, but not alone.
I have grown towards the sky, but not alone.
Always remembering those who pushed me closer.
And this is not just mine.
Selflessly embracing time.
This is not just mine!
Brandishing the hopes we all have.
Flourish in the limitless prospects.
Emphatic in all we feel to be the truth.
Nothing is as safe as the truth.
If I had lived the way I wanted to live, would I have any doubt today?
If I had lived the way I wanted to live...
Is it too late? It's not too late!
I reinforce everything I am and everything I have been up to this day.
Proclaim it: I fortify!
I will try to look within myself,
Compare how strong I've been to how strong I can be.
I will look inside myself to find new strength.
