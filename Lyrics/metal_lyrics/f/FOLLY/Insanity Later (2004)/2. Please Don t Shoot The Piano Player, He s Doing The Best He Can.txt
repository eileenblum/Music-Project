I will not deceive myself this time.
I, with cheating another, I have cheated myself.
I feel so incited that it's come down to this.
This is how I repair the hurt that I have caused.

I offer my hand as an equal, as a friend.
I offer my hand as an equal, as a friend.

Tonight it is a reunion.
We have forgotten everyday that we spent when we dismissed each other
In claiming that we shared in separate victories.
Tonight it's all that I have. It's all I give and it is all that I share.
Because one way or another we all know that our days are new.
Our days are new and I offer my hand

As. An. Equal. As a friend. I offer my hand as an equal, as a friend.

I hope that people see what this all means to me.
Confidence in my actions with positive regard for others.
And I know that respect paves a clear path for successful valor and comaradery.
It's a vision of progression. It's a vision.

Please don't shoot the piano player, he's doing the best he can.
Please don't shoot the piano player, he's doing the best he can.
Let us live by one rule, respect us - we'll respect you.
