In my left hand pocket, I may not have been aware,
But there's a note addressed to "I Am."
In my right hand pocket, I may not have been aware,
Another note addressed to "The Cynic."
They both read: "Look into the mirror, you'll never see yourself like this again."
If I evaluate and analyze, I become twice as guilty.
I must deny and learn to reprimand myself for this fascination.
Is it in your mind? In my mind?
Should I withdraw or should I deposit, should I risk everything for this?
Terrified for someone to show me what I will not become.
Deny. Reprimand. Myself.
Should I risk everything for this?
