Lift the sky above the city lights.
After all, these are the brand new boundaries
From which we offered and accepted the distinct ideas and evolving though.
There was somewhat of a distant insight left vacant
By voids exceeding the expectations of prior lifestyles.
As eyes veiw other eyes, those I's may view other I's.
Homeward thoughts rely greatly on the weight of one's heart.
Moonlight is shading the thieves of the sun.
Moonlight shading the thieves.
The son!
If this life is like the surf, we'll give ourselves away like the sea.
These are the days when the open road points to the sky and screams:
"Our brand new face rested on every unknown floor,
And every time I look back this saves me."
Long time, no sea.
Thanks for everything!
