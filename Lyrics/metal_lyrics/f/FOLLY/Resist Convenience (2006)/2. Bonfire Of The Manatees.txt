Aquatic fortitude!
Unscathed and witless, below the hopes and fears of robotic fixtures.
Proposed to the fluent lovers, hopeless romantics enthralled in semantics.
They'll flee the highlands, they'll flee their skin.
Quick, under the cover of darkness!
De javu and amnesia simultaneously.
Haven't I been here before?
Did I just ask myself that question?
Illustrious madmen knitting quilts for comforters.
Well, isn't it true that we all need outlets to grow?
It's everything that it's not.
Knots everywhere.
There's contradictions in all of us, in everything.
Oh, luxuries maim lunatic.
Auction / action.
Hit the button, admire the implosions.
We're burning ourselves alive, screaming 'peace out!' at the ocean.
Although the flames will engulf the laughter, best bob while limbless and out of air supply.
Anything that's worth doing is worth doing right.
"brevity is the brother of brilliance."
The screw that holds it all together.
In place, in time solo duets.
Audiences fainted!
Live dying to be someone else.
Die living to be yourself.
Possessions are lucrative at best.
Investments buy some time.
Exceptions forth, everything cast aside.
Buy / sell, buy / sell.
Bovine divine!
