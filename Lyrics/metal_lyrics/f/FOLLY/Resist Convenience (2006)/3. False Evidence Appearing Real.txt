Woe?
Blame it on the rain.
Whoa!
Blame it on the name game.
Size-up, suit up self-esteem.
Tie-down, dress-down fight in the dog-days.
Wolf nights?
Introspection and longing are a feverish solitaire.
In fact, it's a lot like masturbation.
When you win, you beat yourself.
See-saw, hear / say.
Say-saw, heresy.
Stimulus, responsive.
Stimuli responded.
Let's pick a definition!
Undue sense of ones own arrogance or a family of lions?
Yeah, I'm afraid.

Not now.
Not ever.

Those songs you'll hear when you're deaf.

Footsteps you see?
Cat and mouse is a game of subterfuge.
The mind scratches itself to pieces.
Spat-up.
Chew it down or leave the entrails to dry in the sun.
In summation, fright is nothing more than a collection of preemptive suicides.
Do what you do to be alive.
It's a massacre outside that hole, wandering three-blind mrs. butcher.
Suspense!
"it's that cat, doc, he scares me to death,"
Confesses the mouse to the shrink.
