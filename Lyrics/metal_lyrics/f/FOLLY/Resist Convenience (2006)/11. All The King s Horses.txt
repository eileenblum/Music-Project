Excellency, by the time you read this I'll be gone.
Long gone.
Gone long.
No longer adorned in robes, nor the finest of armor.
Wayward grows a light exponentially beseeching me.
Divergent boundaries suck the ocean in.
Spit it out!
Spit it back at my face!
Testify / aliby.
Mother nature versus father nurture.
Oh monarch, throw your towel in!
These minstrels must play their flutes at will.
Hurry up, protect your people, incompitent fool!
So overwhelmed with publicity, lacked patriotic integrity.

Come on!
Dissemble the conscience.
Long gone.
Gone long.
