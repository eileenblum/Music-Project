Taken this for granted.
Pawned a laugh for a smile, a hug for a handshake, a note for a goodbye, thank you.
Dial the sun, for the time?
Dial the sun, forgive a big hand, a little hand.
We'll never tell them apart regardless.
Best regards.
Forfeit sundials.
Dispersed the days wondering what it feels like to look back at this.
Unending rituals, line for line.
Memory infinity.
Believe in it.
Dial the sun, for the time?
Dial the sun, for everyone sighs.
Its not my thing but I appreciate it.
At least I can tell them apart from the rest.
Forfeit sundials.
