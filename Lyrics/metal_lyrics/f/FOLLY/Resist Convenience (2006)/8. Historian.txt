In one eye and out the other.
The heiress turned historian, reach-out!
How did she handle herself
Position herself while writing this?
Book-signing autobiography.
Prize-winning best-seller.
Tie her hands to your heart.
She bore no breath.
She bore no cavity.
Relinquish the pageantry, little girl all grown up.
All is said and done.
Verity was supposed to be 'the dirt.'
All is fair in love and lies.
Little girl, growing gray, silent, and blind.
