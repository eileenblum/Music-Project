Take my eyes.
And you will see what pulled me from my ignorance.
Sight. See this. See us. See us. See us.
I can only feel this around you and no one else.
I have searched for a sympathy.
I have searched for a brace to lean on.
And now you're my only brace, and yet I stand so tall.
You would pick me up if I'd fall, you would carry me.
Our great ascension.
We're one in the same.
On that mountain and on that beach.
We watched the sun rise, we watched our lives.
Come so far. Together.
And now your my only brace and yet I stand so tall.
You would pick me up if I'd fall, you would fall with me.
Our great ascension.
We're one in the same.
The love that you return to me (this is for my friends)
It's more vital than the blood pumping through my heart.
