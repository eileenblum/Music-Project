We've been apart for too long
I should have never let you go

I can't change how things have been
But I can try to prevent them from getting worse

Now Im here looking for you
In the furthest depths
Counting the bodies
Obliterating everything I see
Long term exposure has decayed my mind
Ever wonder the mistake that was made
(Cut off their Limbs)
Internal visions block my mind
Sinking deeper

Dreams of the past constantly come
Eating what's left of my sanity (My sanity)
At the end I Find you
Dead, Dead the whole time

(Dreams Left Behind)
