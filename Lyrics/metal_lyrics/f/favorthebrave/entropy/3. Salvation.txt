I see the destruction in your eyes
Ripped down from my high charity
We'll never see the day of light when a constant battle wages through the trenches a Galatic never ending doom
Implemented to see your destruction, this is only tearing us apart.
Tears roll down my face
Could this be.....
With one pull, I could end this torment
Carry me away
Could this be our salvation.
With one pull, I could end this torment
I feel guilty for leaving this spark
It fills my soul with regret
Your visions will only create a failsafe
I never knew what this would become of us
The unexpecting side of this world
Triggered ourselves for another failsafe

I see the destruction in your eyes,
A catastrophic way to begin this

Carry me away, I could end this torment
