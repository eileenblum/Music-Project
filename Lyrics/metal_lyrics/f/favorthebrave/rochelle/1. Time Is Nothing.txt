Why is it that time is not be to be continuous? Equivalent to a straight line.
Time is whatever you want it to be. Maybe it is possible that time in itself is
discontinuous. If time can be significantly magnified, would we discover that
time is made up of tiny segments? Is it possible to find microscopic segments
between all of these spaces? We see time as a straight line from afar, but it
is only our illusion. The spaces in time exist from people, who fall into them
during time, and some remained trapped forever, others continue their path and
make choices that will determine what segment they will recede into . Time is
measured by nothing, but a clock.
