Thanks for the time that we had, let me go. I knew it all would disappear. My
memories built solely on false hopes. Could this also have been a false
pretense? You yell and scream at the top of your lungs which leave your lips.
Instant gratitude, another misfortuneâ¦â¦.Egotistical, self absorbent got the
best of you. The alter will not share your smile that I bear.   This is my time
to realize so thank you for the bullshitâ¦.Thank you for the bullshit, weâll
leave this alone, thank you for the bullshit weâll leave this alone..Bring back
these times; memories that couldnât last [X4]
