My soul collapses to see you drown, drowning apart from what has been created.
To radiate your pain has been a problem to this unspoken solution. My soul
collapses, my soul collapses. To see you drown, drowning apart from what has
been created. It should have been me; it should have been me she said! It
should have been me; it should have been me      . Youâre in a higher place [X3]â¦â¦.
Rochelle donât cry, I know what I must do now. Things will only get
better, and your pain will cease to exist. Rochelle save me, Rochelle Save me.
I feel a tension between us I swear; this family will be no more. I feel a
tension between us I swear; this family will be no moreâ¦â¦ I feel a tension [X4]â¦â¦.
THEREâS NO SAVING ME!
