I'm traveling through the dark magic woods
Reaching the place where the mighty oak stood
The forest will speak with a whispering breeze
For wisdom
I seek among the ancient of trees

Reaching through the flaming mountain,
Fire and heat
I breath
The depths of endless darkness,
Resting below my feet
Dark and narrow tunnels,
Leading through the cave
Secret years have swallowed,
Will forever be my grave

Years of heat and burning sand
Torments me throughout the land
Darkness falling where
I stand
Shadows calling on demand

I'm walking down the lonesome dark road,
I'm going all alone
My eyes glow with painful sorrow,
A journey on my own
My life is filled with agony,
Torture and despair
Secrets that forever slumbering for the world to fear

Rising high in the fearful night
Embracing life when the moon shines bright
Facing the tide for a peaceful site
Waiting for the sacred light

I'm traveling through the dark magic woods
Reaching the place where the mighty oak stood
The forest will speak with a whispering breeze
For wisdom
I seek among the ancient of trees

Years of heat and burning sand
Torments me throughout the land
Darkness falling where
I stand
Shadows calling on demand
Years of heat and burning sand
Torments me throughout the land
Darkness falling where
I stand
Shadows calling on demand

Rising high in the fearful night
Embracing life when the moon shines bright
Facing the tide for a peaceful site
Waiting for the sacred light
