An endless journey throughout the wasteland,
Desert is all we see
With a fearsome army in command,
We will fight as free

There's nothing here but bones and sand
The sun is burning where we stand
Years of travel through a far away land
Arriving at the fields i banned
The smell of deaths cold winter breeze
Chains of frost,
Incurable disease

Hatred and emptiness,
Burning in my soul
Slavery and insanity,
Haunting my home
Feeling the presence of a long forgotten past
Riding the dark road, the lights are fading fast
Piles of ashes, old withered trees
Dark magic slumbers,
Longing to be free

Hatred,
Emptiness
Burning in my soul
Slavery,
Insanity
Haunting my home

Frozen soil and silent screams
A meaning from my hollow dreams
Counting years with inner grief
A burning scorn from inside of me
Frozen soil and silent screams
A meaning from my hollow dreams
Counting years with inner grief
A burning scorn from inside of me

Slavery,
Insanity
Haunting my home

An endless journey throughout the wasteland,
Desert is all we see
With a fearsome army in command,
We will fight as free

Hatred
Emptiness
Slavery
Insanity.
