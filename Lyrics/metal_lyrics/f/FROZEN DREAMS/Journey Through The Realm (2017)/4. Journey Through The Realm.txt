I have sworn obedience to the living dead
Many years I wandered,
Battles to be shed
My eyes are scarred with blood from my sins
Tormenting my heart,
Cursed from within

Haunted by the living
Wanted by the damned
Never to return from the burning land
I was banned

Across the rivers and mountain springs
A land was ruled by an immortal king
Doomed to a fate hat no man could take
His kingdom reaches high like wind from the sky

Many years have passed still his kingdom stand vast
But a man soon to rise,
Destroy his kingdom of lies
A cold chilling breeze when he sail across seas
The god strength he bear,
Spreading darkness and fear
Alone he will face the treacherous king
With a hammer he strikes with a mightyfull swing
A new world will rise as his enemy dies
A world full of life and light shining bright

The journey of a sacred quest,
Seeks the tides of time
Searching for eternal rest,
Reaching for a sign
Deep into the mountains,
Endless piles of gold
Harvesting the menace and secrets to unfold
There's a secret passage leading through the mist
Guided by the lightning
Into the falling pit
Intoxicated surroundings,
Lethal to inhale
The full moon slowly rising,
Allays to prevail

An army of the undead,
Erupting his pain
Everlasting torment,
Runs through his veins
No man could match the greatest of felonies
With sharpened steel,
He kills his enemies
