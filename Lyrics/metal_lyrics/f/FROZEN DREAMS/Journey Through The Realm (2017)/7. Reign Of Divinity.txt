My spirit of reason,
Trapped in my pain
Sentenced for treason,
Blood from my vein
Vicious and fearsome,
A leash for my chain
Mighty and dreadfull,
The nights wandering bane

Trapped in my pain,
Blood from my vein
A leash for my chain,
The nights wandering bane

I see my shadow,
Piercing my soul
A pathway so narrow,
Feelings gone cold
Meaning through suffering,,
Righteous to be
Where demons are gathering,
A ritual to see

Piercing my soul,
Feelings gone cold
Righteous to be,
A ritual to see
Regency,
A kingdom in my dream
Painfully,
A reason for me to bleed

Deep into the unknown,
Cuts through like a black thorn
Darkness are filling me,
Spirits are roaming free

Portals of clarity,
Sends me to infinity
Voices of sanity,
Reign of divinity

Regency,
A kingdom in my dream
Painfully,
A reason for me to bleed
Regency,
A kingdom in my dream
Painfully,
A reason for me to bleed
