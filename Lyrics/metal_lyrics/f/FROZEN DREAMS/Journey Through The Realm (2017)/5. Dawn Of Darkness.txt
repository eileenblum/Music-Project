The sky's turning black,
The nights chilling breeze
Deep into the forest,
Awaken the beast
Cursed and wounded,
To evil were drawn
Living in solitude,
Fear for the dawn
Freeze to the point,
Killing all trees
Deaths burning star,
Awaits to be free
Strong wind run silent,
Through sharpened leaves
The dusk slowly coming,
As darkness leave

The nights chilling breeze
Awaking all the beasts
Through sharpened leaves
As the darkness leave

Thunder and lightning,
Storms so frightening
Cast into the field,
Where no man has yield
Fearsome serenity,
Stories from my elegy
Landscapes that never sleeps,
Evil haunted memories

Cold black wind,
The darkest of sin
Wisdom's of cruelty,
Far from reality
Unholy blasphemy,
Ice freezing agony
Everlasting obliterate,
Dark flames to suffocate

Far up high in the great shimmering sky
The crows fly free,
Everything they see
Deep in the forest the old trees will sing
Guiding the living and flourish the springs
The great mountain side shines in the light
Snow covered peaks,
Never to deprive
The heart of the ocean,
As far you can see
Depths of infinity,
Waves of the sea

The crows flying free
Everything they see
The great mountain side
Shining in the light
The crows flying free
Everything they see
The great mountain side
Shining in the light

Cold black wind,
The darkest of sin
Wisdom's of cruelty,
Far from reality
Unholy blasphemy,
Ice freezing agony
Everlasting obliterate,
Dark flames to suffocate
