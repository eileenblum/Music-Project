From the realms of time,
Through eternal darkness
Arise at its prime
Forgotten by the past,
Left without a soul
Falling far to fast,
Relive the world as whole

Corruption spreading across the land
Whispering voices that once were banned
Through the furthest cold in the furthest north
To the blistering heat that will crack the soil
Piercing flame of eternal suffering
Destruction and pain far from recovering
Unholy creatures from the orb of summoning
Awaken the void from the slumbering

The nights are black and dark
Through the fields of time we walk
Grasping out to the world beyond
Endless depths of a magic pond

Over seas and tides were crossed
Unholy boundaries that once were lost
Eternal damnation is yet to fear
Until the rising suns appear
The deepest woods were voices echoing
Where time stand still waiting for the reckoning
A mighty kingdom of shadowy flames
A restless king rising from the grave

The end will come,
The end draws near
Global destruction is yet to fear
The end will come,
The end draws near
Painful agony from sorrow it tear

We fight for glory we fight for darkness
The seeds of fear at dawn we harvest
The day of salvation and punishment is here
The king will fall pierced by a spear

With freedom at hand,
Perish the evilness
Cleansing and sacrifice,
Filling out the emptiness

With freedom at hand,
Perish the evilness
Cleansing and sacrifice,
Filling out the emptiness
