The dawn of mourning,
Cold winds blowing
Stars slowly burning,
Tides rise and falling
Into the deepest of forest,
Trees that bleed its sorest
Sacrifice,
Stealing and harvest,
Lights up the glade of darkness

Dark times arise,
Years of forlorn will thrive
Fearsome demons of lies,
Falling down from the sky
Plagues of deaths winter chill,
All the righteous dreams they kill
Numbing your cold veins so thrill,
Rituals of dark evil fulfilled

Awakening curse from hollow dreams
The sorcerers seeds of immortal schemes
Fields of ravage no man can find
Restless savage,
Darkness that blind
Silent screams whispers to me
Fallen trees floating the sea
Fiercing sadness,
Feelings confined
Tears of madness,
Secrets that blind

Silence ruling the night,
Nothing but dreams alive
Breathing the winds of lie,
Screaming with feelings deprived
Shadows roaming the night,
The sky burning so bright
Evil and darkness despite,
The crimson tears of life

The moon shines through the howling wind
The shadowy beast with his rawhide skin
His hunger for blood,
Beyond and evil sin
Rising to feel his wrath of violent reckoning
Guardians of light with power so bright
Mighty they fight when the suns line of sight
A fearless thief from the reckless seed
Living with grief like a slow falling leaf

Silence ruling the night,
Nothing but dreams alive
Breathing the winds of lie,
Screaming with feelings deprived
Shadows roaming the night,
The sky burning so bright
Evil and darkness despite,
The crimson tears of life

Silence ruling the night,
Nothing but dreams alive
Breathing the winds of lie,
Screaming with feelings deprived
Shadows roaming the night,
The sky burning so bright
Evil and darkness despite,
The crimson tears of life
