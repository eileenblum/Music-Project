My spirit of pain, calling upon all the evil I've tamed
Forever I fall, for the darkness I blame
The sorrow that call are no longer the same
I'll rise above all
Fire and flame, storming high above the clouds and the rain
Marking the gods, for the treason they're framed
Cursing us all in the heart of our name
I'll rise above all
My spirit of pain, calling upon all the evil I've tamed
Forever I fall, for the darkness I blame
The sorrow that call are no longer the same
I'll rise above all
Fire and flame, storming high above the clouds and the rain
Marking the gods, for the treason they're framed
Cursing us all in the heart of our name
I'll rise above all
The realm that I call, a dark and frozen hall
Through fire I fall, in the sky of burning stars
The evil I feel, above the mountain stream
My life of a dream, where everything is real
The realm that I call,
Through fire I fall
The evil I feel,
My life of a dream
The frost on the trees, embraced by a breeze
Cold winter seas, and ice covered peaks
The dawn of disease, corrupting all the seeds
Torn to my sleeves, curses to be free
I'll silence my fears, the sorrowful tears
Through all of these years, the dawn that will sear
The fall is no near, that all just disappear
A darkened nightmare, for the light that I've cleared
I'll rise above all
I'll rise above all
I'll rise above all

The realm that I call, a dark and frozen hall
Through fire I fall, in the sky of burning stars
The evil I feel, above the mountain stream
My life of a dream, where everything is real
The realm that I call,
Through fire I fall
The evil I feel,
My life of a dream
Rising towards the sun, all fear will just be gone
Feelings of empathy, fills up inside of me
No pain and misery,
Darkness has gone away
The light is so warm to feel,
All this is just a dream
All this is just a dream
