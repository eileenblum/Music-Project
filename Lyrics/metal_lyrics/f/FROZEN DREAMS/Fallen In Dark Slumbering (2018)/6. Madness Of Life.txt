The storm that is raging far inside my dream
Takes me places I have never seen
The shadows follow out on open sea
Rising higher that I've ever seen
The ocean depths are calling out my name
The voice that echoes deep inside my brain
A glimpse of darkness out there to be claimed
reaching over driving me insane
So trust in the signs, all madness in my life
Silence to deprive, all madness in my life
Tormented alive, just to get revived
Feelings that will die, tears I have to cry
Sorrow in my mind, fallen far behind
Reasons that I find, silence through the time
Tormented alive!
Feelings that will die!
Sorrow in my mind!
Reasons that I find!
The time that have forced itself upon my mind
Tries to tell me that I'll never find
Any fearsome thought I have to hide
Affecting all the tears inside my eyes
A fallen star that longing to be free
Burning sorrow deep inside of me
Rising up from darkness in my sleep
The search I follow leading me so deep
So trust in the signs, all madness in my life
Silence to deprive, all madness in my life
Silence to deprive, all madness in my life

Tormented alive, just to get revived
Feelings that will die, tears I have to cry
Sorrow in my mind, fallen far behind
Reasons that I find, silence through the time
Tormented alive!
Feelings that will die!
Sorrow in my mind!
Reasons that I find!
Madness of life!
Madness of life!

Rise to believe, fly to be free
Violent screams to the sound of the sea
Lies is the key, tries to be free
Cursed by a breed I shall fall to my knees
Cursed by a breed I shall fall to my knees
