The burning wind of empty screams, rise above the mountain kings
No fear of falling through to see, the world of mourning anarchy
A reckless storm arrives to fright, all the tears the world have cried
Leaving no one left to fight, only devastating plains in sight
Deeper dreams of fallen fiends, so far below the darkest fields
Embraced by hollow trees that bleed, the night is always far from real
Fallen in dark slumbering!
Forces through the time, darkness has revived
My fear has come alive, the silence in my mind
The roads are dark and hard to see,
The dawn so far and out of reach
An agony of pain I feel, corrupted by the broken seal
The shadows are my only friend, were cursed to sail into the end
Righteous stars of light that blend, my lonesome heart it tries to mend
Deeper dreams of fallen fiends, so far below the darkest fields
Embraced by hollow trees that bleed, the night is always far from real
Born full with sin, crawling in my skin
Cursed from within, the time has yet begin
Fallen in dark slumbering
Fallen in dark slumbering

Rise above, breaking free
The storm in me, howling through my sanity
Burning flesh, my dying dream
Scorching me, fallen in dark slumbering
The burning wind of empty screams, rise above the mountain kings
No fear of falling through to see, the world of mourning anarchy
A reckless storm arrives to fright, all the tears the world have cried
Leaving no one left to fight, only devastating plains in sight
Forces through the time, darkness has revived
My fear has come alive, the silence in my mind
