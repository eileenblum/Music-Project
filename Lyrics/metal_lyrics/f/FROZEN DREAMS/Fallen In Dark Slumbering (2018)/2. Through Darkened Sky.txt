Far into the night where sorrows left to die
Horrors in my mind from the violence yet to find
Pain to deprive of the endless songs of time
Forever heard across the sky
I fall below the trees and fly above the seas
No longer I breath the fear of all disease
The life and death slowly goes to sleep
The world I have foreseen, the blackness that bleed
A silence that never shall be seen
Lies that scream in the night, storms that follow my sight
Waiting for all the signs to die
A tear that will freeze, the glade of disease
The fire I breathe, that burns deep in me
Will live through eternity
The silence of grief, A tormenting breeze
The sorrow that lead, my hearts full with fear
To places that never have been reached
The sky is far above my eyes
The darkness spreading out from lies
The wind that blows in the trees
Far beyond and out to the sea
Are heard and calls upon to feed
Far into the night where sorrows left to die
Horrors in my mind from the violence yet to find
Pain to deprive of the endless songs of time
Forever heard across the sky
The world I have foreseen, the blackness that bleed
A silence that never shall be seen
Lies that scream in the night, storms that follow my sight
Waiting for all the signs to die
I fall below the trees and fly above the seas
No longer I breath the fear of all disease
The life and death slowly goes to sleep
Hard enough to breathe, fallen to my knees
No dawn will come to free, the sorrow that rest to deep
A darkness that spreading in my dream
A tear that will freeze, the glade of disease
The fire I breathe, that burns deep in me
Will live through eternity
The silence of grief,
A tormenting breeze
The sorrow that lead, my hearts full with fear
To places that never have been reached
To places that never have been reached
To places that never have been reached
