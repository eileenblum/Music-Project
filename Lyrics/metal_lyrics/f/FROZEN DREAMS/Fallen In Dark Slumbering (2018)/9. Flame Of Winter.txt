In the world of dreams, a fallen kingdom I reach
The silence that streams, in a place that's under siege
Forces of the wind, that's tormenting
Nothing can live inside the ruins of sin
Shallow seas that hide the darkest of fiends
Voices that will scream, calling for me
Fallen trees of the darkest of seeds
Rivers that freeze for as far I can see
Sorrow and disease, the winter breeze
Forever bleed
The sadness I free and the curses I breathe
Awakens the tide in the forest of time
Voices I have hide, inside my mind
That leaves me blind
The righteous fears will enlighten my mind
The saddest tear from the sorrow I find
The dawn will rise for the ravens to fly
A blood red sky and a tormenting cry
A burning flame of the fire I've tamed
Whispers my name and awaits to be claimed
Embracing the fields of the cold winter dreams
Forever to freeze the black world of disease
The righteous fears will enlighten my mind
The saddest tear from the sorrow I find
The dawn will rise for the ravens to fly
A blood red sky and a tormenting cry
Fallen trees of the darkest of seeds
Rivers that freeze for as far I can see
Sorrow and disease, the winter breeze
Forever bleed
The sadness I free and the curses I breathe
Awakens the tide in the forest of time
Voices I have hide, inside my mind
That leaves me blind
In the world of dreams, a fallen kingdom I reach
The silence that streams, in a place that's under siege
Forces of the wind, that's tormenting
Nothing can live inside the ruins of sin
Shallow seas that hide the darkest of fiends
Voices that will scream, calling for me
