Across the endless sea, to the land of fallen kings
Where snow never leave, and the ice has frozen deep
The air that I breathe, so cold but yet so free
The lore that I feel, of dark and violent grief
Trapped in this place, the cold I have to face
Mad or insane, so deep inside my vein
I burst into flame, for the rage I cannot tame
Sorrow and pain, for the life I live in vain
I'll ride with the wind, above the mountain peaks
Through sorrow and sin, the darkness that I see
Nothing can still, the hunger that I feel
Forever to bleed, the horror that I've freed
The signs that i find, inside the forest deep
Lost for all time, the sirens that sleep
The path in my mind, surrounded by the trees
None shall survive, the road that I lead
Trapped in this place, the cold I have to face
Mad or insane, so deep inside my vein
I burst into flame, for the rage I cannot tame
Sorrow and pain, for the life I live in vain
I'll ride with the wind, above the mountain peaks
Through sorrow and sin, the darkness that I see
I'll ride with the wind, above the mountain peaks
Through sorrow and sin, the darkness that I see
