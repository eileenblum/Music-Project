Far beyond my dreams, a darkness foreseen
Forces of the wind, howling through my sin
The evil of affliction, resents me no more
Rise to perfection, the nights open door
Corrupting my mind, the fire that blind
Silence of time, that rise in a line
Never to see, and never to free
Thoughts of destruction that resting beneath
Sadness and grief, consuming all my needs
Nothing to believe, the sorrow I feel
Embrace the wings that fly, through a darkened sky
Falling down to die, to hear my final cry
Corrupting my mind, the fire that blind
Silence of time, that rise in a line
Never to see, and never to free
Thoughts of destruction that resting beneath
Violently!
Face thy fear, fight to tear
Memories!
Come to me, to be free
Darkness will rise!
Rise from the deep, silent it sleeps
Darkness will rise!
Caressing my skin, lies from within
Caressing my skin, lies from within

Reach for my soul, from the fires down below
Torments the cold, always to behold
The pain that I feel, will forever now be sealed
In the darkest field, never shall be healed
Corrupting my mind, the fire that blind
Silence of time, that rise in a line
Never to see, and never to free
Thoughts of destruction that resting beneath
Violently!
Face thy fear, fight to tear
Memories!
Come to me, to be free
Come to me, to be free
Come to me, to be free
