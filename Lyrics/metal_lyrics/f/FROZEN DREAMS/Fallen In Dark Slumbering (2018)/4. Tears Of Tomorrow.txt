The light of the morning, warm winds are blowing
The cold has been turning, so far from my journey
The sun is my ceiling, above the clouds its feeding
My soul starts the healing, the sorrow that I'm feeling
Alone I walk for years, struggling through my fears
Reaching out to hear, I've never shed no tear
Reflection that I see, a journey far from real
My fate has been revealed, the darkness disappear
I walk towards the sea, through glades I have foreseen
The road is full with trees, and leaves that have been bleached
Forces of the wind, have never been so grim
I sail the tides I seek, the life inside my dream
The road that I follow, so far and so narrow
The stars shine so hollow, above the fields of sorrow
The darkness that follow, my trail of tomorrow
The sky's getting colder, I've fallen into tremble
Alone I walk for years, struggling through my fears
Reaching out to hear, I've never shed no tear
Reflection that I see, a journey far from real
My fate has been revealed, the darkness disappear
Fallen in fear, the dawn is near
Mourning that tear, the dawn is here
Lost in the time, light shall revive
Burning my mind, light shall deprive
Fallen in fear, the dawn is near
Mourning that tear, the dawn is here
Lost in the time, light shall revive
Burning my mind, light shall deprive
I walk towards the sea, through glades I have foreseen
The road is full with trees, and leaves that have been bleached
Forces of the wind, have never been so grim
I sail the tides I seek, the life inside my dream
