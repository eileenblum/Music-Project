My vicious crimes through dynasty,
Calling towards my enemy
Hide behind the walls I've breached,
Never to accept defeat
The land of darkness stretches deep,
Thorns of fallen trees that feed
Tormented feelings from my mind,
Nothing more than fears I find
My kingdom fly across the sea,
Burning wings of agony
High above the mountain side,
Fearless screams I meant to hide
Erupting storms so painfully,
Oceans cry to silently
Tears of madness through my eyes,
Forcing dreams to sympathize

The road I follow haunts my dream,
Curses caused by tears
I bring
Drenched in blood a darkened sin,
Rise above the howling wind
The dawn will never come for me,
Light is pouring out to free
My mind of broken memories,
Confined for all my felonies

Fall to my knees,
Calls to be free
Cry silently,
Far and out of reach
Diet o believe,
Hard not to bleed
Tied with no key,
For reasons I cannot see

Confessing feelings silently,
Thoughts of fear and empathy
Affecting all the sins in me,
Forever cursed with harmony
Darkness is the cure I need,
Caused by evil seeds to breed
Alone I face my broken dreams,
The righteous tears of pain they stream

Confessing feelings silently,
Thoughts of fear and empathy
Affecting all the sins in me,
Forever cursed with harmony
Darkness is the cure I need,
Caused by evil seeds to breed
Alone I face my broken dreams,
The righteous tears of pain they stream

Fall to my knees,
Calls to be free
Cry silently,
Far and out of reach
Diet o believe,
Hard not to bleed
Tied with no key,
For reasons I cannot see

Fall to my knees,
Calls to be free
Cry silently,
Far and out of reach
Diet o believe,
Hard not to bleed
Tied with no key,
For reasons I cannot see
