In a world where nothing lives,
Cursed for eternity
A place long lost to be,
Where there's nothing left to feel
Across the fields that weeps,
Forest that once were green
Scattered with fallen leaves,
Nothing will grow out here

Frozen in time I fly through the night
Piercing my life with darkness on my side
Taunting the lies of reasons I have hide
Burning my mind with secrets that will die
Forever die

The dark condemns the light,
Once so warm and bright
Nothing gets through alive,
Forever to greet the night
Everything will die

The dark condemns the light,
Once so warm and bright
Nothing gets through alive,
Forever to greet the night
Everything will die
I fight the rising tide,
Silence my screams I cry
The harvest of human lives,
Will forever greet the night
Everything will die

Calling the tides that reaching mountain heights
Seeking a sign that standing in a line
Waves of the light streaming down my eyes
The blackness I find are things that cannot die

Fear is
Drawing near,
Tears will soon be cleared
Time is on my side,
And thrive inside my mind

Fear is
Drawing near,
Tears will soon be cleared
Time is on my side,
And thrive inside my mind
Inside my mind

Fear is
Drawing near
Tears will soon be cleared
Time is on my side
And thrive inside my mind

In a world where nothing lives,
Cursed for eternity
A place long lost to be,
Where there's nothing left to feel
Across the fields that weeps,
Forest that once were green
Scattered with fallen leaves,
Nothing will grow out here
