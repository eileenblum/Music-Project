The world beyond my dreams,
Cold and filled with grief
Guiding me through fears,
For all who dares
The eyes of deaths embrace,
Til end of days
Carries the haunted tray,
To show the way

Sadness and empathy,
Erased from the time for evil to be free
Blindness and corrupted trees,
Arise for the fall of frost and misery
Darkness and sanity,
Embracing all my vanity
Demons of lunacy,
Controlling all humanity
Deadly hypocrisy,
Enslaved by immortality
Nightshade that's tormenting,
A taste for what the dawn will bring

Bloodshed and misery,
Thoughts in my head is forcing me to bleed
Silence the infantry,
Carving with a knife so the wounds won't heal
Darkness and sanity,
Embracing all my vanity
Demons of lunacy,
Controlling all humanity
Deadly hypocrisy,
Enslaved by immortality
Nightshade that's tormenting,
A taste for what the dawn will bring

Lost inside the ocean that bleeds,
For eternity
Never to feel the howling wind,
Crying to me
Far beyond mountains and hot river springs
Forest that's frozen so silent they sing
An evil deception corrosives the skin
A dark alignment haunting you dreams
Fiercing sadness and meaning of guilt
Are rising up faster than noon can build.
The long lasting loneliness forcing to feed
A mind of emptiness that no one breathe

Sadness and empathy,
Erased from the time for evil to be free
Blindness and corrupted trees,
Arise for the fall of frost and misery
Darkness and sanity,
Embracing all my vanity
Demons of lunacy,
Controlling all humanity
Deadly hypocrisy,
Enslaved by immortality
Nightshade that's tormenting,
A taste for what the dawn will bring

Lost inside the ocean that bleeds,
For eternity
Never to feel the howling wind,
Crying to me
The world beyond my dreams,
Cold and filled with grief
Guiding me through fears,
For all who dares
The eyes of deaths embrace,
'Til end of days
Carries the haunted tray,
To show the way
