The endless cries in the mountain high
Darkness and lies in a foreign sky
Arise to survive the end of all life
Sentenced to die the light will deprive

The road of darkness embracing me to the point where
I can feel
The life beyond the dying scream,
A curse for eternal misery
Facing a life with burning wings,
In a place of frozen dreams
Descent from up high in a time of need,
For reasons to kill those who don't believe

The hopeless dreams of haunted fields
Where seeds in need to bleed
A grievsome silence that rest to deep
With the sound of fallen leaves

The world beyond

The road of darkness embracing me to the point where
I can feel
The life beyond the dying scream a curse for eternal misery
Facing a life with burning wings in a place of frozen dreams
Descent from up high in a time of need for reasons to kill those who don't believe

A vision that calls,
A whispering fear
From a world I've carved inside of me
The essence of creation that silently sleeps
A reason that burns for eternity

No tears will fall cursing my dream
Restless
I call for insanity
The darkened sky arise in a line
Never to see the end of time

The hopeless dreams of haunted fields
Where seeds in need to bleed
A grievsome silence that rest to deep
With the sound of fallen leaves

The world beyond
The world beyond
The world beyond
