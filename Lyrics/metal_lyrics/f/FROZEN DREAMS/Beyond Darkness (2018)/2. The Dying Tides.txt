My mind of blindness tortures me,
Far and out of reach
Breaking the silence with my scream,
The voices of harmony
Lies of fallen dreams,
Feel like burning streams
The rage inside of me,
Lost within my empathy

Thousands of years of endless misery
Darkness that calls for all eternity
The world is falling carnage is the key
When sadness calling reaches to be free
Darkness arise erupting in the sky
Tears that
I hide increases through the night
Restless grief that surrounding me
Fiercing hate for all my memory

The shallow tides redeems my life,
Secrets will come alive
Empty thoughts revives to thrive,
Calling the open sky.

Embrace the silence from inner fear,
For shedding my final tear
Storms are facing winds that breathe,
Crossing the realm in me
Lies of fallen dreams,
Feel like burning streams
The rage inside of me,
Lost within my empathy

Rising high,
Sands of time
Cries for life,
Serenity of dying tides

Deep inside my dream corruption and disease
The land I cannot see is forcing me to sleep
Tears me up like a fallen tree
Voices so clear but no one left to hear
Time is a key that fits in everything
Surroundings that bleed infected misery
Counting the years I fallen in despair
A cemetery where the restless disappear
