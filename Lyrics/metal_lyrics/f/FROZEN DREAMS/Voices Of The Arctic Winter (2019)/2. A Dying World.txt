The cold arctic wind, that fly full with sin
The horror it brings, and shivers my skin
The oceans and sea, a thirst that will lead
The waves rising free, the night goes to sleep

I fly free, so blindly
Searching, for something
The stars feel, my dark dreams
The light stream, right through me
The rising, despising
I'll keep trying, to stop the lying
The violent lightning, and storms so frightening
The world is dying, but I'll keep hiding

The cold arctic wind, that fly full with sin
The horror it brings, and shivers my skin
The oceans and sea, a thirst that will lead
The waves rising free, the night goes to sleep

The tides that are calling far away
Calling the sorrow and my pain
Darkness will always find a way
The voices that are heard with my name
Alone I will go towards the flame
No one will ever know that I came
I follow the routes night and day
Forever I will walk to be sane

The tides that are calling far away
Calling the sorrow and my pain
Darkness will always find a way
The voices that are heard with my name
Alone I will go towards the flame
No one will ever know that I came
I follow the routes night and day
Forever I will walk to be sane

I fly free, so blindly
Searching, for something
The stars feel, my dark dreams
The light stream, right through me
The rising, despising
I'll keep trying, to stop the lying
The violent lightning, and storms so frightening
The world is dying, but I'll keep hiding

I fly free, so blindly
Searching, for something
The stars feel, my dark dreams
The light stream, right through me
The rising, despising
I'll keep trying, to stop the lying
The violent lightning, and storms so frightening
The world is dying, but I'll keep hiding
