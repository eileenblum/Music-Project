I'll rise from the darkness in my dream
A place of the sorrow I have seen
I try to escape but I can't feel
My mind cannot tell if this is real
I fall down in deep anxiety
My body is frozen of despair
The mourning is always far to clear
My time has come to rise again

I've called the voices in my head
Together we reign the land of dead
The sadness has always been the key
For darkness and immortality
This northern dream I have foreseen
Controlling the realms I've never been
A star has been falling out to sea
With flames and burning misery

I'll rise from the darkness in my dream
A place of the sorrow I have seen
I try to escape but I can't feel
My mind cannot tell if this is real
I fall down in deep anxiety
My body is frozen of despair
The mourning is always far to clear
My time has come to rise again

I'll rise from the darkness in my dream
A place of the sorrow I have seen
I try to escape but I can't feel
My mind cannot tell if this is real
I fall down in deep anxiety
My body is frozen of despair
The mourning is always far to clear
My time has come to rise again
