In a forlorn time, of the darkest divine
I'll shatter to find, what's left of my mind
The path I seek, have rose to its peak
In a far away creek, where voices will speak
I follow my mind, possessed by my crimes
The road I can't find, and the forces that bind
My eyes cannot see, the soul deep in me
The fate that will bleed, has not been revealed

The storm awaits far out to sea
Beyond the stars long to break free
The dying trees and lakes that will freeze
Will fall and seal along with all fears
A darkness rise the blackest demise
Cursed with lies for all it despise
The crows that fly embracing the sky
Will fall and die there's nowhere to hide

The storm awaits far out to sea
Beyond the stars long to break free
The dying trees and lakes that will freeze
Will fall and seal along with all fears
A darkness rise the blackest demise
Cursed with lies for all it despise
The crows that fly embracing the sky
Will fall and die there's nowhere to hide

In a forlorn time, of the darkest divine
I'll shatter to find, what's left of my mind
The path I seek, have rose to its peak
In a far away creek, where voices will speak
I follow my mind, possessed by my crimes
The road I can't find, and the forces that bind
My eyes cannot see, the soul deep in me
The fate that will bleed, has not been revealed

In a forlorn time, of the darkest divine

The road I can't find, and the forces that bind
My eyes cannot see, the soul deep in me
The fate that will bleed, has not been revealed
