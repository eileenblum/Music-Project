Far beyond the darkest dreams, high above the atmosphere
The stars guides me through my fears, into the land of frozen tears
The snow is falling down on me, so cold it falls upon the trees
The sky is always clear to see, far below zero degrees

I cross the endless sea, a burden I have freed
The ocean that I lead, through sorrow I will bleed
Calling out my name, the silence I have claimed
I trust in my pain, that flows inside my veins

A storm awaits at the rising tides
Forces I feel like a fire inside
No one can fight all the demons inside
The winds of time that will end all life

I cross the endless sea, a burden I have freed
The ocean that I lead, through sorrow I will bleed
Calling out my name, the silence I have claimed
I trust in my pain, that flows inside my veins

Far beyond the darkest dreams, high above the atmosphere
The stars guides me through my fears, into the land of frozen tears
The snow is falling down on me, so cold it falls upon the trees
The sky is always clear to see, far below zero degrees

The dawn will fall, with sorrow and despair
Like a stone brick wall, crushing down to clear
Voices of clarity
I hear them calling through a cold arctic winter breeze
The snow is falling still

The snow is falling still

The dawn will fall, with sorrow and despair
Like a stone brick wall, crushing down to clear
Voices of clarity
I hear them calling through a cold arctic winter breeze
The snow is falling still

The dawn will fall, with sorrow and despair
Like a stone brick wall, crushing down to clear
Voices of clarity
I hear them calling through a cold arctic winter breeze
The snow is falling still
