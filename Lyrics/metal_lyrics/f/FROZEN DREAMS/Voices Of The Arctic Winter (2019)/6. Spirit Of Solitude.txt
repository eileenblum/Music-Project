My grief some silence, burst into tears
Darkest of violence, spreading the fear
Reaction so painless, curses that free
Tired and sleepless, controlling what's real

My feelings are helpless, burning within
Sorrow that stretches, a thorn in my skin
Fallen and restless, forcing my mind
Scorching me senseless, with fire I die
My spirit of sadness, the soul which I hide
Attraction of madness, I try to deny
The words have been spoken, reflecting a sign
Whispers of torment, broken in time

Alone I wake up with a scream
Frozen from horrors in my dream
Tomorrow will never come alive
I trust that the stars will fall and die
I walk with the demons of despair
Through endless tracks we have been shared
At first light it forms itself to scare
My spirit of solitude appear

Alone I wake up with a scream
Frozen from horrors in my dream
Tomorrow will never come alive
I trust that the stars will fall and die
I walk with the demons of despair
Through endless tracks we have been shared
At first light it forms itself to scare
My spirit of solitude appear

My feelings are helpless, burning within
Sorrow that stretches, a thorn in my skin
Fallen and restless, forcing my mind
Scorching me senseless, with fire I die
My spirit of sadness, the soul which I hide
Attraction of madness, I try to deny
The words have been spoken, reflecting a sign
Whispers of torment, broken in time

My grief some silence, burst into tears
Darkest of violence, spreading the fear
Reaction so painless, curses that free
Tired and sleepless, controlling what's real

My feelings are helpless, burning within
Sorrow that stretches, a thorn in my skin
Fallen and restless, forcing my mind
Scorching me senseless, with fire I die
My spirit of sadness, the soul which I hide
Attraction of madness, I try to deny
The words have been spoken, reflecting a sign
Whispers of torment, broken in time

My feelings are helpless, burning within
Sorrow that stretches, a thorn in my skin
Fallen and restless, forcing my mind
Scorching me senseless, with fire I die
My spirit of sadness, the soul which I hide
Attraction of madness, I try to deny
The words have been spoken, reflecting a sign
Whispers of torment, broken in time
