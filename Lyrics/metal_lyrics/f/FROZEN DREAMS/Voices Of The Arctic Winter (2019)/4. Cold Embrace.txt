The world in my mind, nowhere to find
The path I walk among fireflies
That leads me through this winter night
The open sky, I fell inside
Creating all that I need to fight
A crumbling road that goes back in time

The burning sun so hard on my skin
Rising high for all of our sin
The brightness feed on all I can see
The sorrowful seed of the darkest of trees
My pathway leads, the darkest disease
The silent stream that reaches the sea
Alone I breach the horror and fear
Embracing the cold in the frozen lair

The world in my mind, nowhere to find
The path I walk among fireflies
That leads me through this winter night
The open sky, I fell inside
Creating all that I need to fight
A crumbling road that goes back in time

The burning sun so hard on my skin
Rising high for all of our sin
The brightness feed on all I can see
The sorrowful seed of the darkest of trees
My pathway leads, the darkest disease
The silent stream that reaches the sea
Alone I breach the horror and fear
Embracing the cold in the frozen lair

Forces of time, a tormenting cry
Arise to survive, the curses of lie
Darkness deprive, the lightning sky
Fallen behind, forever to fly

Forces of time, a tormenting cry
Arise to survive, the curses of lie
Darkness deprive, the lightning sky
Fallen behind, forever to fly
