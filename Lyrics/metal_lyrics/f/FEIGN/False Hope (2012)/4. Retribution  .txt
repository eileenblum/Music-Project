A blind world filled with blind minds
Left with a limited amount of time
I've never felt so low, thanks to you
I'll just use this time to grow

Now because of me
From the inside you will rot
You are the reason for my hate
There's no denying this is true fate
I'll rip you limb from limb
Grasp your heart &amp; inhale your sin
Cry for your dear life
From here I rip out your spine

This is retribution
You never fucking cared
This time you will suffer
Your end is fucking near

Inside me lies an abomination
That sadistically destroys everything that concerns your creation
Fuck your cause, fuck your memory

For once you'll be the one who's scared of me
Forward I stand on your corpse, blood covers my hands

Revenge never felt so good
Completely satisfied I stood

Now life moves on
In it's cycle of born, raised, &amp; inclined
