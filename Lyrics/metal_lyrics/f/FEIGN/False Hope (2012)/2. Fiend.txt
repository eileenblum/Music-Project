You made your choice
Your back has become overwhelmingly familiar
I'm not the one to judge, but you are such a waste
It's hard to see straight when you are so two-faced

How's the view from where you stand?
So far from yourself &amp; the ones that you called "friends"

I know that I'm just wasting words on ears that won't hear

I'm done asking myself over &amp; over again if I made the right choice
This is nothing to me anymore, &amp; never will be
This hole you dug for yourself is only getting deeper &amp; deeper
&amp; that hole will stay that way
"Hate" is only a minor description of the amount of disgust I have for you now
So sit back, listen, &amp; inhale what I mean when I say that

You are the reason that I put my trust in God

So keep running from yourself
You're bound to find nothing along the way
