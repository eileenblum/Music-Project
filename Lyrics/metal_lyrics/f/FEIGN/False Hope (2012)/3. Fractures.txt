What's become of this?
A place once named of higher hope, of beautiful canvas

This is the mouth of Hell, if I've ever seen it
Everything lies before me in pieces
Crushing everything in my path, I stand
Blood fills the air, fills the sand
This is the mouth of Hell, if I've ever seen it
Everything lies before me in pieces

You are all the same
This world is full of pain
Follow my path of destruction, I'll lead you
Mountains leveled, home of the few
Red cracks through the surface
This was his fucking purpose

Everyone was fucked, &amp; they all knew it
I watched you live like an ant on it's mound of dirt
Watched you live like you were on top of the world
Now this place is Armageddon

This place wastes away in turmoil
Everything once living, now soiled

This is the mouth of Hell

Who knew this would be it, the last day?
I beg you to stay

History melts before my eyes
My home, my family, my everything

With my hands gripped around your throat
I watch you choke
Choke on your own blood
With my hands gripped around your throat
Now tell me
How do you feel?

How does it feel
How does it feel to be the victim for once?

The heat soaks up your tears
As they run down your face
Everything laid away at stake
Clearly, you took everything for granted
Constantly lied to yourself because you couldn't stand it
