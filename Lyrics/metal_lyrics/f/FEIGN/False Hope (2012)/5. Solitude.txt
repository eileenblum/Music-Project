I have no one
But myself
I'm all alone
I'm on my own

Nobody sees what I see
No one feels what I feel
My soul has become hollow
My mind has been swallowed

I will hang you from your own intestine
I am happy as long as I can smell it
This is exactly what I wanted
This is your Hell
This is my Heaven

I am in complete solitude
Total isolation

Fuck the bullshit
I kill motherfuckers
Feign, 2012
Houston, Texas

This place I once knew
Has become a home for people like you
A home for Hell &amp; it's servants
I know you were scared
You should have been scared of me

But once everyone's dead
There is no more dying then
So let's speed up the process
Swallow all your fucking lies

&amp; say good-bye to your life

No one sees what I see
Nobody feels how I feel
I've given up on my surroundings
I never wanted any of this
So tell me
Why am I a part of it?
Darkness has become my only friend
Because I never cared about any of this
