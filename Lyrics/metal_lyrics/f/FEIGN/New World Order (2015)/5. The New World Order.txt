[feat. Dan Watson of Enterprise Earth &amp; Jim Martin of ex-Aegaeon]We won't fall to the hands of the ones that stand against us
By the law for all man
For justice
For all of us
New world order

A new world paved over the dust of the forsaken
Will we allow it, or will we stand against this treason?

We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans
They tell us what we want to hear never living up to a single fucking thing they say.
We can end this now.
But we must stand together for justice for all man
The new world order.

We will march to your fucking capitol
We will march until your system is destroyed

Fuck you and fuck your system
This is a new world order
Feign 2015
Houston fucking Texas
Let the unsung leaders come together
The like-minded
The right-minded

[2x]
Won't be held against our will
We won't be taken alive

[2x]
We will rise to stand against them
We won't
We won't
We won't be taken alive
