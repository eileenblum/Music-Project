Reawaken the evil in my heart
&amp; turn me into the way I was before
Cold &amp; ruthless [2x]
Standing there over your savior
Uninhibited by any foolish emotion

Drag me through the tides of your savior
I'll watch as the hopeless people pray
Drown me in the holiest of waters
I'll still see right through all of you

I am the tempter
I am the son
I have been summoned to
To kill everyone
[2x]

With nails through my hands &amp; feet
Stuck to their boards led up to a crooked peak
To suffer in scorn &amp; help them make believe
I won't hang for the misbelieved

Let them fall in line
Like the ones of the herd
Like the ones of the lied
Let them fall in line

I am the tempter
I am the son
I have been summoned to
To kill everyone
[2x]

Death is the solution
To all problems
No man, no problems
Death is the solution
To all problems
You are my fucking problem

Reawaken the evil
Inside my fucking heart
Return me to the way I was before
Cold &amp; ruthless

Your little bigotry can't exceed me
The mass appeal of what confirmed the weak
Won't consume me

Let them fall in line
