This is the end of your world as you knew it
The time you have left has been cut short
&amp; you aren't even worth it any fucking more

When you bow your head
Realize no God is there to hear your pathetic cries
Only know that everything you lived for is just a fucking lie

Death will envy me
Hate will fall behind
Sympathy &amp; remorse are absent of my mind
[2x]

A desolated past followed by a non-existent future
You are getting nowhere
Now you are better off dead &amp; gone

Death will envy me
Hate will fall behind
Sympathy &amp; remorse are both absent of my fucking mind

No need to hold it inside
We are all living a lie
We are all dying inside
Now fall behind
