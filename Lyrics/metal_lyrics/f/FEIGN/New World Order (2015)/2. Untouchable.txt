Your tomorrow came and went
And today is the same
Where is the change
Where is your change

Your time has come and gone
Four years served and nothing
Nothing has changed
Now you must pay

You've been warned
So make your move
You know me and what I live for
You've been warned
So take your chance
You know me and what I'll die for

Your mind is weak and damaged
Since the day you were born
Your life it holds no meaning
Just like the oath you've sworn

"No one is untouchable"

For the fact that you expect respect
My skin crawls
Force-feeding feeble ways to live
Fuck you all
