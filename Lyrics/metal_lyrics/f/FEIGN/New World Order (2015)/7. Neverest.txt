At both ends a burning candle
I've been here before
Now here I am again
Back to where it all began

Angst relentless
My hands they tremble
Useless fruitless
Stick in the mud

Never neverest
Conscience heavy
Numb the mind
Numb the fucking feeling
Lost in my thoughts
Welcome to my ending
Forever neverest
Conscience heavy
Numb the mind
Numb the fucking feeling
Lost in my thoughts
Welcome to my ending

Why wake up tomorrow when you can stay up today?
My thoughts continue, continue to betray me
You can blame me
You can hate me
But you will never break me

[2x]
Never neverest
Conscience heavy
Numb the mind
Numb the fucking feeling
Lost in my thoughts
Welcome to my ending
Forever neverest
Conscience heavy
Numb the mind
Numb the fucking feeling
Lost in my thoughts
Welcome to my ending
