Words have come to us with the morning breeze
We can feel the fuss of the wind of the seas
Mother earth in anger, lightning in the skies
Mighty force of thunder, open your eyes

Our sister cried a thousand tears
Against the wind and tides, forget our fears
We must cross the land with the forces of nature
And by our hands, let's forge our future

It's a march for freedom
In a world rules by jealousy
Let's walk through her kingdom
And set them all free
It's a march for freedom
Where magic has no place
And this march for freedom
Will change the nature of the human race

Closer to the castle, we still hear her song
Enchanting the battle, our powers growing strong
On the shaking ground, castles walls are falling
No soldiers around, brothers spread your wings

Our sister cried a thousand tears
Against the wind and tides, forget our fears
We must cross the land with the forces of nature
And by our hands, let's forge our future

It's a march...

Words have come to us
With the morning breeze
And this march for freedom
Gave us a kingdom
Our march for freedom, oh
