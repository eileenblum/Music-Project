Surrender, you sinners
We'll purify you hearts
So demons will return
Where corrupted souls burn

Around the castle, dogs are out
Villagers hiding in terror
Every door and window is blocked
The witchunt has begun

Verifying each and everyone
For traces of evil
No magic allowed, said the queen
Or burn at the stake you will

Surrender, you sinners
We'll purify your hearts

Around the castle, dogs are out
Innocent people are in danger
Soothsayer, illusionist, healer
Whoever you are, don't resist

Wherever you go they'll find you
Even if you're hiding away
What ever you say or do,
No sinner will last

Surrender, you sinners
We'll purify your hearts
So demons will return
Where corrupted souls burn
Surrender all you sinners
Who's hearts are in despair
Wizards and witches will burn
And all the sinners will have learned

Surrender
Now time has gone by
No sinner left around here
Did they kill all of them? Oh no

Surrender, you sinners...

Surrender, sinners
So demons will return
Where corrupted souls burn
Surrender all you sinners
Wizards and witches will burn
And all the sinners will have learned
