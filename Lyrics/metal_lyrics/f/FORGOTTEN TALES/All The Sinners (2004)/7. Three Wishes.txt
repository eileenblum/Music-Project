The end of a dream has come now
I know I am alone in this world
My life was changed, let me tell you how
I feel I've been caught in a swirl

I was passing through the forest
On that nice summer day
Everything was at its best
When I first saw him far away

A mocking smile on his face
A voice that froze my blood
Floating in the air with grace
Could not do a thing but nod

I knew he had a plan
But I was caught in his snare
The offer was so grand
Why haven't I been aware

He gave me...
Three wishes for a life of wealth and power
Three wishes to rule and reign all over
Three wishes to win the heart of a lover
Three wishes that destroyed my life forever

First, I wished to be rich
To be covered with gold
The have all the treasures on earth
Never miss anything

Why was I so foolish?
Money just left me cold
There is no treasure that is worth
More than friends that life could bring

Then I wished to reign on a kingdom
With my court and servants around
Own hundreds of horses
And decide who lives or dies

Why did I steal their freedom?
Only loneliness I found
They tried with all their forces
To make me live such lies

I finally wished to be loved
By each and everyone
To choose the one and only
Who could fulfill my desires

When I see that from above
Oh, I cannot carry on
No heart deserves to be
Controlled by the hand of a liar

A lot, he promised me
But little I received
I thought that he was my saviour
It was only an illusion

I've lost everything
Because I wanted it all
I can hear them laughing
I know this is my fall

Because of
Three wishes...
