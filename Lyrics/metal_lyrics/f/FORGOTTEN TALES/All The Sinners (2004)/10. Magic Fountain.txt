Far, far away I traveled
On mountains, skies and seas I searched
Fountain of youth you are my quest
My reason to live
To find you, many men have died
They abandoned all they had

I must reach the sacred island
To find the forbidden paradise
Among the magic trees you hide
In the gardens of the gods
To find you, many men have died
Don't think that they were mad

Magic fountain blessed by the gods
I will find you by all odds
Tell me where, give me a clue
Magic fountain I need you
It is just a matter of time
Magic fountain, you'll be mine

Oceans and skies are furious
They are trying to stop my quest
Now that I have reached the place
The guardian I must fight
To find you, many men have died
But not a chance they had

So near, I will not surrender
Even if the gods themselves appear
I will drink you magic blood
Now death will always fail
To find you, I'm ready to die
It won't happen don't be sad

Magic fountain...
