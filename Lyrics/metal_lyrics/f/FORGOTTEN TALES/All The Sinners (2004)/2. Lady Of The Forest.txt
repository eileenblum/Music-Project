Beasts and trees are warning me
Great danger is approaching
They're coming from the old castle
By order of the queen

Ground is shaking all around
All creatures fleeing away
Are they here to capture or kill me?
I must find a place I won't be found

Oh no...
Find a place...
I won't be found

What do they want from me?
Is there a price on my head?
How did I become so harmful?
Why not just let me be?

I am just the Lady of the forest
Healing all the wounds of men
Consider this as my quest
I am just the lady...
I'm the lady of the forest

Now I can hear them, they are near
There's no escape, I'm in fear
I can see them through the dust
And I realize, realise I am lost

The chase has now begun
I feel like a fox on the run
Dear mother nature please protect me
I will give my life for thee...for thee...
I will give...my life for you

I am just... Of the forest...
The lady...
Lady of the forest
