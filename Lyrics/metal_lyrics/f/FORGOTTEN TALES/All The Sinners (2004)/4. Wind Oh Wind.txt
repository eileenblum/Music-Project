I see darkness everywhere
In these icy wall of stone
All I can do is sit and stare
I could not feel more alone

I'm your prisoner but beware
You can laugh there from your throne
As long as I will breathe the air
I'm a danger for what you own

My brothers far from here
When they will hear my call
You will all shiver with fear
And you'll see your kingdom fall

Wind Oh Wind,
Carry my words away
To the lands where druids and I belong
Wind Oh Wind,
I implore you today
Make my brothers of the earth hear my song

No walls can break my will
No darkness, no fear, no pain
For freedom I would kill
But there is more to gain

My brothers far from here
When they will hear my call
You will all shiver with fear
And you'll see your kingdom fall

Wind Oh Wind...
