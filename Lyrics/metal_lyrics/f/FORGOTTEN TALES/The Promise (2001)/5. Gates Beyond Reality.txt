Do you know there's a strange place
Somewhere down an unconcious alley.
A sanctuary that you've already faced
Like a misty dream that won't stay.

Do you remember the last time you came?
You know you don't feel the same.
You got this joyful taste of your tears.
It's time to release your fear.

Everytime you look around,
Every place you're searchin' for.
There's no answer , there's no clue.
Until it reaches you waitin' for more.

Here are the gates beyond reality
Waiting for your destiny
Open it once and you will find
What clears the shadows of your mind.
Here are the gates beyond reality.

Everytime you look around...

While you're asleep, this world still turning.
A world of fairytales and glorious fantasy.
Waitin' for your until the next morning.
Now you know that you're free.

In daytime, aching for your way
You want to go back.
Nobody can steal your dreams away
In here you control your fate.

Here are the gates...
