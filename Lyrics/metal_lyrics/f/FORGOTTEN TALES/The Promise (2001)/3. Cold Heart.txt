I can see in your eyes the fear and the pain.
Now you know that today will be your last
If you could see in our hearts the clouds and the
rain.
You should know,we can't forget the past.

You lived your life in gold and lace
With plenty of food and wine.
But the world outside was in disgrace
Waiting for a sign.
You've raped, you have stolen
A thousand times on this land.
For you it was only amusement
That they didn't understand. But today... They will
see...

The death of a cold heart, liberty for all
There'll be no more tyrant to tear them apart.
Death of a cold heart, liberty for all
Death of a cold heart, they will be free at last.

You lived your life all alone, you thought you had
friends.
They got you to the bone, you'll regret 'till the end.

Now we see in your eyes
The end of this reign of terror
Wherever we'll go even in the skies
We'll never meet together
If you could see in our hearts
No more clouds, no more rain
We now have hope for your children
They are free at last. And they've seen...
But today... They have seen...

They've seen the death of a cold heart...
