Is there a place on earth
Where men could leave in peace.
With no frontier to fight for,
No treasure to keep.

I imagine a wealthy land
Feeding men 'till the end of times.
It seems so unreal,
Once I see it , it all disappear.

This land in my head, we'll find it one day.
Even it takes eternity.
This land in my dreams, we could reach all together.
And so it will become... our sanctuary.

There must be some countries
Where violence doesn't exists
A nation of true freedom
Never been controlled by kings.

My friends follow me on this land
To breathe the air of liberty
I know we're so close this time
I can feel it under my skin.
