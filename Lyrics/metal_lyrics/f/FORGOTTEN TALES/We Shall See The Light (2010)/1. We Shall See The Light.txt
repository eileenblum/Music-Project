Oh... oh...

Angel who came from the sky.
Remember why you've been sent here.
Trapped in this mortal shell.
Aware that your mission is near.

But you'll have to make this journey all alone.
To fight the evil down here on your own.

They will hide from you.
You'll never see their real faces.
Never turn your back on anyone.
In whatever places.

They were just like you,
Angels, but they have fallen.
Time has come to make them pay the price.
It's your burden.

Use your faith, trust your heart.
And you will succeed where we have failed.
So we shall see the light again.
In this world torn apart
You'll have to bring love where hate prevailed.
So we shall see the light forever again.

A place where angels dare never go.
Where even light cannot see behind.
Races divided by sorrow.
Whose leaders are those you must find.

Tell me, Angel.
That you will not give up the fight
Never break the oath you have sworn
And do what is right

It's a world of death
Where dark angels are kings.
Time has come for you to end this war
And spread your wings...
