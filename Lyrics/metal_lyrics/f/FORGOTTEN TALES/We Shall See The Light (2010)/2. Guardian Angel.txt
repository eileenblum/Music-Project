It happens every day.
In every place I go.
And before I realize,
You swiftly disappear.

You seem so close today.
Is it me you follow?
Are you here before my eyes?
I know you are near.

While I step toward you,
I suddenly lose your trace.
All I need is to see your face.

Have our souls met before?
In this life, or another.
Our destinies are bound.
Like so many here.

I wonder what you're here for.
There could be no answer.
What you hide must be found.
Then all things will be clear

While I step toward you,
I suddenly lose your trace.
All I need is to see your face.

You give me hope, when I am lost.
You hold my soul.
You're my guardian angel.
You give me hope, when I am lost.
You guard my soul.
You're my guardian angel.

I heard your song in the night,
Breaking through the silence.
These words comfort me.
Like a whisper in my ear.

I saw your face in the light.
Watching from a distance.
This force surrounding me,
Has eased away my fear.
