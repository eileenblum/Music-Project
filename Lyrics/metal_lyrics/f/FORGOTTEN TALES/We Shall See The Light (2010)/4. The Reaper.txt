There is no rest for me to take.
Since I am your humble servant.
There is so much work for me to make.
And give respite is what I can't.

On my list, growing on and on.
A name appears then fades away.
Until my duty here is finally done.
Like the hunter I'm on my prey.

Written by the ones above us.
Destinies, engraved carefully.
Forever drawn, none shall discuss.
The path is set, just come with me.

My world you can't see... forever will be.
Its gates open wide, for everyone here.
My world you can't touch is setting you free.
Come inside, now the path is clear.

I am no friend, I am no enemy.
I do not wear any mask.
Call me the reaper, call me bitter death.
I'm here to fulfill my task.

One day I liberate... the other I take.
Forever surrounding, prowling.
Always around, asleep or awake.
For the ultimate sign I'm waiting

On my list, growing on and on.
A name appears then fades away.
Until my duty here is finally done.
Like the hunter I'm on my prey

Many men challenged me in duels.
Astray souls... Ignoring their own fates
Wasting time trying to change the rules.
I always win when death awaits.

My world you can't see... forever will be.
Its gates open wide, for everyone here.
My world you can't touch is setting you free.
Come inside... the path is clear.
My world you can't see... forever will be.
Its gates open wide, for everyone here.
My world you can't touch is setting you free.
Come inside, now the path is clear.
