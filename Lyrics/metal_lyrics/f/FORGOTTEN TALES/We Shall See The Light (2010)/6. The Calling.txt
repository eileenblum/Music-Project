Whispers from times that have passed.
Deadly pain that forever lasts.
Prayers merely misunderstood.
Unheard voices that someone should.

This message however so clear.
Softly roaming at my ear.
Tells the story long concealed.
Of souls whose fate is sealed.

Their eyes forever open wide.
Witnesses to their death denied.
All the memories of hopeless living.
For help they're waiting.

Hear, hear the calling of those who once have lived.
Oh hear, hear the calling of these wandering souls.
For whom the bell tolls.

Helpless cries, forgotten song.
Breaks the silence they are among.
Feeling helpless, awfully blind,
Us who cannot... cannot glance behind.

Eternal sleep is their last wish.
To put an end to the anguish.
Since their death, living in pain.
And now they call in vain.
