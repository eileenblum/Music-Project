From the place where I stand,
I wished I'd be with you.
But life was already planned
For both me and you.
I now understand
There's nothing we can do.
That's why I kissed your hand
And I just flew...

(Ostende mihi vestros angeli oculos)
...so far away
I know I broke your heart.
Believe me there was no other way
I still can feel your pain
We're from two worlds apart
I had to break the chain.

From the dark where I wait
I wish I'd hear your voice
You know I don't believe in fate.
So what's my other choice?
I can't understand
The things I feel inside
That's why I left the land
So now I hide...

(Ostende mihi vestros angeli oculos)
...so far away
I know I broke your heart
Believe me there was no other way
I'm still searching in vain
A place for a new start
Where I'll forget my pain

Show me your angel eyes
And I'll follow you blind to heaven skies.
Take me by surprise,
Tell me sweet little lies
Show me your eyes.
Your angel eyes...

I never thought I would love.
A soldier of the light.
When I saw you rise above.
You were shining so bright.
I now understand.
How I feel about you.
That's why I kissed your hand
and I just flew...
