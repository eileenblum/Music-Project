Silent moon, high above.
Witness of the night to come.
Under your charm I succumb.

Sudden rage, from within.
Burning fire in my veins.
Need for blood, only remains.

Are you friend, are you foe.
Behind your soft glow?
Only you and me now know.
How far pain will grow.

Beast of prey, I've become.
Lurking at all that's passing by.
No mercy tonight, the moon is my ally.

Gruesome duty, deadly night.
Just like many in the past.
I can't resist, will pain forever last?

Are you friend, are you foe.
Behind your soft glow?
Only you and me now know.
How far pain will grow.

I am howling at the moon.
Hoping for dawn, crying in despair.
I am howling at the moon.
Until someone finds my lair.
(Howling at the moon...)

Long ago, from a curse I was born.
Living from innocent's death.
On my fate I mourn.
And suffer 'til my last breath.
