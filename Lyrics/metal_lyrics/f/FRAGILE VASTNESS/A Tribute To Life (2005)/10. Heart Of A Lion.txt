[Music: Vangelis Yalamas / lyrics: George Ikosipentakis]

Whenever life betrays you
and fears are overcoming
stand strong with a heart of a lion

Should I remember the reasons...
This journey never ending and I still live with it
Can I explain all my fears...
This life is slowly melting and I still breathe the same air...

[Chorus:]
Whenever life betrays you
and fears are overcoming
stand strong with a heart of a lion
Wherever walls are tougher
and you can't break through
won't you stand strong
with a heart of a lion

Whatever I believe,
I just need you here with me

If you can share this burden with me...
Still I will walk in silence and you with me in my arms...
Come now and dance this waltz of deceit...
The steps are always easy,
be careful, don't you fall on me

[Chorus]

Whatever I believe,
I just need you here with me

[Chorus x2]

Whatever I believe,
I just need you here with me
