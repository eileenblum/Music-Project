I'm waiting for the sun to wake up with me
it's too late for the warmth to come inside
I feel the same like yesterday
Although my life is coming to an end
a little smile stretches my skin again

GOD, why did you give me cancer?..
If you're honest, then give me an answer
I'm God himself, the Satan too
giving is a huge part of my being

[Chorus:]
God, why did you treat me like a punisher
like a parent locking up his child in the basement
God, why did you let all the joy go to waste?
I'm sure you're hiding somewhere

Are you the one who created me?
Maybe I'm the one who created you
I'm going to find out even if I have to travel around the world
If you can hear me, know that I'm not afraid of you
I'm going to hurt you like you've already hurt me
All I want from you is a good conversation

[Chorus]

I'm leaving today,
I'll fly over Nasca
till the people in this plane
are staring at me like I'm insane

I'm leaving today,
I'll fly over Nasca
till the people in this plane
are staring at me like I'm insane

[Chorus x2]
