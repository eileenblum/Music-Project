I find myself onto a cliff,
from one forest to another I fly
like the other day I feel the same
everywhere I go I smile, I cry, I'll die

Like a condor who stopped to catch his breath
I feel I'm one step closer to God
Am I so numb or just too scared?
Why is it so hard for me
to open my heart and see?

Ever since the day I was born,
my clock is ticking backwards
Only time will live forever
