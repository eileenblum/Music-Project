The purple sky around you looks like a frame,
covering the most beautiful painting
I see a picture every time I close my eyes,
I taste your tears

[Chorus:]
I want to cry,
I'm proud enough to lay my head
and let the pain outside
Love will tell,
cause you and me will be again
the queen and king of OUR time

You let a flower come into my side,
never took it just let it flow in the stream
the seeds will grow up and become new flowers,
reminders of a love that will always be...

[Chorus]

I wonder why
Why every good comes to an end
it's sad but true
Let's spin around until we feel the ground no more
When love and loss knocks at your door
you will feel out of control
All alone let's spin around until we feel the ground no more

"Who will take the blame
it doesn't matter any more
we're both lost tonight
maybe God thinks it's just a game
I'll drink another round
till the morning sun finds me on the floor"

The bright sky around me looks like a frame,
covering the most uncolored painting
I see a picture every time I close my eyes,
I taste my own tears

[Chorus x2]
