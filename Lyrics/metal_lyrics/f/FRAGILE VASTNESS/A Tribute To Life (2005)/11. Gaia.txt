The smell of soil wet by morning rain
A glimpse of drops touched by the sun
But still you are so far away
and I hope to stay

Hold on to live another day
I try to smile but it's too late

Now, I think it's time to fade away
The curtains go down, the show ends
But now I'm so far away
and the sun seems so fake

Hold on to live another day
I try to smile but it's too late
Hold on and seize another chance
The light of dawn, it warms my face

Hold on to live another day
When these moments fly
the tears are drained away
Now you got to hold on
and seize another chance
When emotions fall
it's when you've crossed the line
