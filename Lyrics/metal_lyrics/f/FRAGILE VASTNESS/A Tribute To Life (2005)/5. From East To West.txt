[Music: Vangelis Yalamas / lyrics: Vangelis Yalamas]

All my life I was feeling so incomplete
joined others at the crossroad of fate
who can define happiness when ignorance becomes bliss in the name of love

No more lies, I just found my inner truth
forsaken desires taken by storm
summer rain wiped out of my pictures of youth
I come to me, come to me, come to me

It's a new world that's coming through
and clears out my point of view
This woman is so mystified
I will delay my last goodbye

I remember the time when she spoke to me
all the others disappeared from my sight
I was feeling no more loneliness cause happiness replaced my heart with the warmth of love
No more crying, I found a reason to live
nothing can stop me cause I care anymore
summer rain mixed with my tears of youth
I come to me, come to me, come to me

It's a new world that's coming through
and clears out my point of view
This woman is so mystified
I will delay my last goodbye

Cause I want so much to cry,
but only you can stop me my rise

It's a new world that's coming through
and clears out my point of view
This woman is so mystified
I will delay my last goodbye
