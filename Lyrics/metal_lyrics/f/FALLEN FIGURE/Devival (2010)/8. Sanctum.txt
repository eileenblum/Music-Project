Captive, confined
Eyes set on liberation
Held down in our mind
Our only limits we set on ourselves

Inscribed in these walls
A race lost in its greed
Eradicated through hostility

Sanctum of solitude
Remembering never
Break free from ourselves
And look to new horizons

A vacant mind will be convinced by lies
Thus repeating the pattern
A vacant mind will be convinced by lies
Thus repeating the pattern

Negligence is never the answer
Recognized but hardly heard
Silenced, defied, and left to die
We must break the cycle

Liar, we can't hide our eyes forever
Our perception of reality is dead and buried

Exploitation of innocence
Exploitation of all that's left

Inscribed in these walls
A race lost in its greed
Eradicated through hostility

Sanctum of solitude
Remembering never
Break free from ourselves
And look to new horizons
