Inconsequential, unimportant
These are the judgments of the careless
They want to see us fall into damnation
Awaiting sentence from the tyrants

What goes around comes around
The walls have fallen down
What goes around comes around
The walls have fallen down

Will you see what I see?
They will forsake you and condemn you
Ignoring the issue will make you lonesome
Too late to crawl back, itâs your downfall

Delaying settlement, begging us for some aid

Profoundness is not found,
The Oppressor is behind this
Truth and time will bring down the tormentor

They want us to suffer
Lingering, we'll triumph
We will prevail once again

You will remember our name for eternity
Forever remember our name

Regaining my strength to prepare for what I'm fighting for
Oppressing the masses, a feeble thought manifests into an altered form of domination
Consenting to our masochistic livelihoods
Who could have foretold this prophecy?
Once again, humanity has the upper hand

Inconsequential, unimportant
These are the judgments of the careless
Now they fall into damnation
Awaiting sentence from the victims

What goes around comes around
The walls have fallen down
What goes around comes around
Resurgence is found

Crawl
