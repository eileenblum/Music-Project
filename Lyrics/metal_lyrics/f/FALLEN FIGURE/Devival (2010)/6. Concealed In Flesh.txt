We are the foundations of humanity
Concealed in flesh lies the root of all suffering
Incessant attempts at erasing our identity
This lifeless trance is everlasting

This is the hour of our redemption
No longer tolerating heedless acts of domination

Exiled and left for dead
Salvation obsolete as the infection spreads
This time around we will not turn our backs
And enter a new age of corruption

Recognize that the ill-advised willingly give their trust
In the end, we're all guilty of ignorance
Vindication, abomination, retribution in the absence of a solution

Scour for a solution
We are the ones in the end

Exiled and left for dead
Salvation obsolete as the infection spreads
This time around we will not turn our backs
And enter a new age of corruption
