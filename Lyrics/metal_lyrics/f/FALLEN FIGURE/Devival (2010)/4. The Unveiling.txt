Masquerades, a false sense of security
They shape their lies around us
Realizations consigned to oblivion
Defamation of what we believe in

Full of hope, you spoke with such conviction
From where we stand your lies forge more restrictions
The division between mankind and his keeper
Breeds a new generation of hatred

The illusions of a Utopian society
These fabrications will never be maintained
Your failures negate your accomplishments
And your tyrannical reign will soon mean nothing

Pull the veil over your own eyes
Pull the veil over your own eyes

The truth will be heard

Mortified by the ruins you have created
Mortified by the ruins you have created

Full of hope, you spoke with such conviction
From where we stand your lies forge more restrictions
The division between mankind and his keeper
Breeds a new generation of hatred

Masquerades, a false sense of security
They shape their lies around us
Realizations come with a sense of hostility
Your legacy will never be honored
