Falsifier, denier, go ahead and follow the herd
Your greatest flaw is your uncertainty
And your hesitance will leave you alone

Your ways will push me away
The origins of your moral decay
Sympathy for all your impurities
May the heavens have mercy on you

And itâs all in your hands
To choose the right path

What I am, is something you'll never amount to be
My qualities surpass your minds capacity

And itâs all in your hands
To choose the right path

Let this lesson be learned
The weak will follow the herd
Let this lesson be learned
The weak will follow the herd

Weak

Falsifier, denier, go ahead and follow the herd
Your greatest flaw is your uncertainty
And your hesitance will leave you alone

Your ways will push me away
The origins of your moral decay
Sympathy for all your impurities
May the heavens have mercy on you
