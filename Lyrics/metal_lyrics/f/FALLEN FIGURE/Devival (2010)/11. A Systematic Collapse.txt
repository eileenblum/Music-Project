Erosion of ascendancy
Collapsing everything
A rude awakening
Diminishing all restraints
Response was never expected
Failure was never intended

Mindless inhabitants
Scattered like debris (scattered like debris)
An empty headed population only cultivates hypocrisy

Terminate eternal enslavement
Break free from mass extinction
A new indoctrination
Devise a system of perpetual existence
Devoid of desperation

Genesis, a new beginning
We will rise from beneath the ashes

Descending desolation
Avoiding trepidation
Into endless misery
Life has lost it's all meaning

Mindless inhabitants
Scattered like debris (scattered like debris)
An empty headed population only cultivates hypocrisy

Collapsing injustice
Collapsing tyranny
Collapsing corruption
A new beginning

Genesis, a new beginning
We will rise from beneath the ashes

Collapsing
