Wake the fuck up

No time to feel regret for all these atrocities we have committed
These are the hardest times
Through struggle comes passion

Eidolons have been misled
The echoes of dismay are corrupting our minds
Prying into our lives
Which leads to fraudulence

And it is time to renounce our existence
And it is time to renounce our existence

The visions of torment, they haunt me
The will to live guides me through misery
The visions of torment, they haunt me
The will to live guides me through misery

And it is time to renounce our existence
And it is time to renounce our existence

Itâs time to torch a light
To stand for what is right
These are the hardest times
For multiple life collisions
What path will you choose?

Wake up and see whatâs around you, deceiving you
We must break these iron bars surrounding us

No time to feel regret for all these atrocities we have committed
These are the hardest times
Through struggle comes closure

Wake the fuck up
