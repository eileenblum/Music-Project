This is a revelation
We will decipher their cryptic lies

No longer will we wait in silence
Paralyzed and motionless
Establish apprehension
Through persistence

We will not cower away
Endeavors, they multiply
Responsible for all your iniquities
While you remain shrouded in secrecy

Burdened by disarray
Now we will rise
In search of liberation, we dispose of our reasoning
In spite of subjugation, we can achieve the impossible

This is a revelation

Vacuous, mindless creations

Burdened
Now we will rise
In search of liberation, we dispose of our reasoning
In spite of subjugation, we can achieve the impossible

We will not cower away
Endeavors, they multiply
Responsible for all your iniquities
While you remain shrouded in secrecy

We are vacuous
Mindless creations
This is a revelation
