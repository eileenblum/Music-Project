This world could change in an instant, utter your final farewell
And this revision could cause a divergence, incentive to rebel

A struggle we all must confront
We will face these altercations
Running away will only heighten the conflict

The fractured parallel
Reduces our chances of survival
The fractured parallel holds us back

In time all things will resume
Programmed for eternal survival
Protecting their hidden agendas
Awaiting revival

Erasing the pieces of our history

A struggle we all must confront
We will face these altercations
Running away will only heighten the conflict

The fractured parallel
Reduces our chances of survival
The fractured parallel holds us back
