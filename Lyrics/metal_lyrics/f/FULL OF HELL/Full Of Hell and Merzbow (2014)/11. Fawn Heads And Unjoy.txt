cankerous fluid seeping in through scraps and dregs abound
memories of thine untarnished standing and then weighted down
thrust into lights gaze eternal birthed from shaded willing womb
shards of hushed echoes and secrets clinging like so many motes.
Seed sowed. Engine burnt.
sentient and organic thought
climbing bridges and clavicles
tumbling and turning through
a warm and looming scattered space.
spilling and crashing through
the canals of every naive ear
and at last, a home is found on another crossed bent ear.

Seed sowed and engine burnt.
