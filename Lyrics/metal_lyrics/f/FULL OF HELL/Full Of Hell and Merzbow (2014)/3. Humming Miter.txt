Force fed bodies into empty rooms
long burnt plastic waxing moon
Ebbing ember wanes and shrivels
Flows weakly as ceaseless rivers
Bellowing hoarse. Into the wall.
Sea of dead eyes. waking rolling.
Carapace drags. On and on.
Shell of a shell. On and on.
folds of money pass through my hands
just as quickly to anotherâs 
Donât question your own self worth
accept that you are fucking worthless 
crushed worm under (the) foot of terra
and here i am, lacking desire.
bellowing hoarse. into the wall.
Bellowing hoarse. At you.
