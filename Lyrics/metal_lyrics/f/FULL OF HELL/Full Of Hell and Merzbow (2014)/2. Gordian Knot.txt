Lower class. Born to breed.
Knuckles drag. ovular bleed.
climb the wall, cyclic pain.
hit the floor, sapling maim.
Another empty jar and a fist of blood.
diadem crushed under a sea of mud.
You live in line. You fuck. You die.
In the folded repetition of a thousand moments.
Under the warmest blanket of being.
climb the wall cyclic pain.
hit the floor sapling maim.
Another product of an inbred system.
heightened to itâs peak by backwards dictum.
