A man locked up in a shriveled and frigid selfhood. With no living currency of faith and love between him and his fellow creatures. Is as much alone amidst a Parisian holiday surrounded by a bedecked and huzzahing world of humanity as the traveler who loses his way benighted in the center of a polish forest, and in the drifted snow, leans against a tree. Starving and freezing. while the distant yell of wolves is borne to his ears.
