Scores of ships bouncing - scraping off a black lid.
Exploding in arcs,
Across dark oceans.
A fruitless epoch.

Knocked on the black lid - no answer.
Hammered the lid for days - no fissure.
Flew towards the black lid - arrows rained down.

The outways are closed.
Transmitting waves halted.
Among the crumbling augers.
Congruently sealed.

Here you sit, king under the lid.
