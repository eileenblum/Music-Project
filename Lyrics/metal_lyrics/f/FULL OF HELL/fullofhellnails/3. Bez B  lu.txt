Languished sentinel will stand waiting. 
If it pleases thee, it will beget me. 
Unbecoming. 
Free yourself from this bent vault or die in prison. 

Needles bow and hammers twist
On splintered boards and broken fists. 

Let pain in.
Let it guide. 
Let pain win.
Let it decide.

Cuticles rupture as hands pull forward to hold that which you've never known.
