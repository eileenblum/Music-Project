An endless sea of rhododendron, 
Blooming within your blue ruin.
A black ink curtain of oppression,
Presses flat in opposition.

Your language is hunger, 
Your tongue is desire,
Walk along the bank and sink into the fire.
Flesh pillar, scar stretched
Star blight, stone etched 
Fucked wound, deep down.

Hands spread forward, stand resounding. 
Spilling in, lung blisters gorged.

Wake up underneath my sun.
Underneath my gnashing teeth.
Awaken underneath my fire.
Crushed pillar withers in my fists.

Onward, upward, forward.
