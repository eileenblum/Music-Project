A dream of transcendence. An act of piety.
An inscrutable face. An iron curtain.
Chemical dispersal. Dreams made real.
A lone sphinx, no longer bound.

Guiding blindly forward to glory and agony.
At the hands of angels, a mass murderer is free.
The gift of peace, delivered discretely.

All hearts stop and point to One!
Peace delivered. Chemical dispersal.
Mass murderer. To glory.
