Time pretense shatters harmony.
A mirror of savage remembrance, a hole of immeasurable intolerance. 
A sprite careens. A kamikaze bled dry. 
Into the river. On the muddy banks.

If it whispers, it bends. If it harks, it is alone.
Time pretense shatters harmony. 
Veins course with the memories of a present we've forgotten.
