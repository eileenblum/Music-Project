Walls collapse on the city of refuge.
Under the enormity of its own violence.
Roads bend slowly in on themselves with the sorrow of generations.
Buildings stained pitch black. Lean in.
The carcass of time glazing over.
They bite and latch at the throat of morality.
Strangle and smother the future of all.

Gnawing at old flesh, barking at the sun.
Within Armageddon, humans eat each other. 
Their teeth pull and tear at the chords of memory.
Gore the human soul. Dowse the human spirit.

Man will fail. Man will always fail.
