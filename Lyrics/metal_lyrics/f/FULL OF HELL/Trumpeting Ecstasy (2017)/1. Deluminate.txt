Once more we're thrust into the vacuum of God's yawning maw. 
A dream of human debt repaid. 
In fear you live and breathe and wait and sleep. 
Chambers under asphalt buried far beneath the boiling streets. 
There is not a hand to save you from the hunter's net. 

Society is a blister on the skin of the planet. 
Man is a pustule on the face of the Earth. Grace is a harbor for human ugliness. 
Free will is a barrel in the celestial mouth. 

When Atom splits and the genome melts, will Cain cradle Abel? 
Sudden death.
