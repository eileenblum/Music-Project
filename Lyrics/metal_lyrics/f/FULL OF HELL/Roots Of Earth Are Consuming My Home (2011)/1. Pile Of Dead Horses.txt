Drop out. Repress. Dig in. Regress
Iâm purging friends and backing out
Left alone in your post mourning doubt
I never kept in touch because i couldnât bear the thought
of the mal-de-mer inside your head that couldnât be un bought
Drop out. Repress. Dig in . Repress.
Shut in. Eat pills. Feel worth in your own reflection
