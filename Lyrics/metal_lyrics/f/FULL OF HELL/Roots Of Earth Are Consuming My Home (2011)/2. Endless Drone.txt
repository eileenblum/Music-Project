Iâm eating my own words and begging with lies
Circumventing reason for another month of trudging onward
Hard truth. Impoverished youth
Trading empty jars for empty promises and deeper ulcers
Canât buy myself out. canât ever escape
I'm just another slave bound to a fucking stick
Iâm pushing my hands deeper into the mud
When they say itâs hard all over, itâs the fucking truth
Iâm weeping into the gutter
I see the ladder and fucking shudder
If you work to the bone for fifty more years
the pension puts a stall to all your deepest fears
Hard truth. impoverished youth.
Trading empty jars for empty promises and deeper ulcers
Canât buy myself out. canât ever escape
Iâm just another slave bound to a fucking stick
The doors arenât open. theyâre rusted shut
The way is closed. the path is gone.
Iâm relenting to the corporate drone
Pushing my nose to the motherfucking grindstone
Splinters upon splinters
Wedging in deep
I try to pull them out with my worn down teeth
My periphery is narrowed like a god damned mule
Workhorse of the wicked, of the trite and cruel
Iâm relenting to the drone
The endless drone
