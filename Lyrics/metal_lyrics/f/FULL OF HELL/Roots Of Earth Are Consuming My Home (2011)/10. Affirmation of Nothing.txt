The wheels of this machine will continue to roll forward, 
because individual choice is but illusion and farce.
Reality is subjective, there is no truth. 
We are pressing feet into a soil that will never leave a trace.
Bring nothing. Take nothing.
Born as sheep. Die as sheep.
You are trapped by the world 
that has surrounded and engulfed you. 
We are cogs in this beast until the day we rot. 
It's a grid of mass delusion that you'll never escape.
We are pressing feet into a soil that will never leave a trace.
Born as sheep. We die as sheep.
