"We have each other"
Vulgar fictions of a callow iris.
Purpose is lost. 
Heat rises and the foundation looms.
Humidity will swallow the domicile and the ties that bind.
and roots of Earth will consume my home,
under the lonely moon,
and the stars that will never have any memory of us.
The stone will crack, 
the windows will splinter under the weight of time.
and as the bed burns,
our tongues and hands will be reclaimed by dirt.
and roots of earth will consume our home
