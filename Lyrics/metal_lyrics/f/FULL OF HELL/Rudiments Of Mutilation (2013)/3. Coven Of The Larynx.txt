The larynx croaks inward devotion.
An existence hewn from varicose flesh.
Palatal tones pass dimly outwardÂ 
from a slurred and careworn wretch's mouth.
Bereft of love, self inflicted.
The molded image of a crippled whelp.
Marked with a benign crow's foot
and wallowing in placidity.
and from the same loam, I was borne and cut.
A wicked lich, spiraling senseless.
Caustic pariah. Pitch smeared visage.
Boring through you.
