Split skin spread in fetid lacework
Babylon in crusted sea brine.
In opulence, he weeps and slumbers.
Asseteague son, long begotten.
Cryptic jeremiad in circles,
melange of ruinous copse.
Self destructive self denial,
pleasure wasted from within.
They moan, they whisper, they shake when they breathe.
They crawl, they weep, they croak when they speak.
They moan, they whisper, they shake when they breathe.
With new orifices made, they shudder with relief..
They moan.
