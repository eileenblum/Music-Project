[originally by The Melvins]I coulda swore I gave my wedding ring to you. 
Among the chewing gears you taunt me tear. 
Elements are still alive to shake from ear to ear. 

Pez are gonna let it slide, gonna burn what cotton decides are appellee. 
My main oven drive, he took from under what's come over me.
