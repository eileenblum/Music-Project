Murmurs. Failures. 
White wall fissure separates the conscious mind as light abates. 
An ecstasy bright burst swallows the surroundings. 
An amber mote in the black vault. 

"Death is to lose the Earth you know: for greater knowing. 
To lose the life you have for greater life, to leave the friends you love, for greater loving. To find a land more kind than home, to find a land more large than Earth." 

I wake from this fever. All is false.
