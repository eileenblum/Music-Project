To claim: of yours, of mine, the same. 
To grasp. To drink from life's boiling spring. 
Thistled fingers warm and bend, 
calling your children home hungry. 
Baited aurum and cocked lilly eyed lust. 
Perched like a jaundiced vulture, wings spread in vain for anything to clutch. 
Bones of contention. 

To drink, with blistered lips. 
To grasp, in hands of barb and sap. 

Your greed sticks to your bones. 
It sinks to your marrow and calls you home.
