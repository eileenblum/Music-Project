Earth bulge. Tenuous burgeoning. 
Man's grip slips like the waning warble of an autumn sparrow. 
Lists in triads justify means. 

The mental cocoon ruptures and light erupts. 
It chases and raises the shadowed mire of restless longing. 

Circuits blister and click. 
Branches rattle and crack. 
Skull shudders. 
Moon dies.

The mental cocoon ruptures and light erupts.
