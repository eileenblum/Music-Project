Noxious fugue harming
Vermilion fog mending
Flaccid weight crushing
Bearing down slowly
Like a corpse rotting
Smoldering prism speaking
Whispering lore, untruths
Scrambling signals

Circuits unwinding
Your heart is a wellspring of hatred
Errors embedded

As the gears slow to a stop
Unbound like a broken black egg
Do you see the hand upon my hand?
It is not my own

Empathy released
Your heart is a wellspring of hatred
