Thundering hammers, Christ's lovers
Veins of fluorite, fold over fold
Ore woven, band upon stone
Hands of man, undone
He shall give angels charge
Over thee to keep thee
In all thy ways, ever always

Crime on humanity
Crime of insanity

A lonely spirit eats the heart of the mountain
Hallways echo endless of past ages conflict
Imperceptible movement shapes all
A vicious heat melting death into life

Crimes on humanity
Crimes of insanity
Crimes on humanity
Crimes of insanity

Weeping onto thundering hammers
Begging before Christ's lovers
Eating the heart of the mountain
The melting of death into life

A crime on humanity
A crime of insanity
