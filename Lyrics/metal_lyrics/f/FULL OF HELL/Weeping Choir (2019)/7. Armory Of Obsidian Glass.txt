Cavern of dreams
Gnashing walls
Leaning obtuse
Crushing - gripping
Built up for millennia
A prison beyond death
Memorial fog
Thicker than mud
A whimper refracts
As a howl
Sightless obsidian
Wallowing armory
Sightless obsidian
Wallowing failure

Beyond the door are many doors
Beyond the window are many windows
They will always be locked and sealed
There will always be a defeat
Cavern of dreams
Gnashing walls
Sightless obsidian
Wallowing failure
Beyond the door are many doors
Beyond the window are many windows
