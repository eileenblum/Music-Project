A looming barge, a sea of fog
A candle soaked indefinitely
Weathered tower clawing out
Rattling at the worlds throat
Where you fell, so I am
Where you fall, I will be
A whispering hiss from tail to head, tumult and disease

Within the wake at the center of the fountain
A seething rage and blooming distrust ever mounting

A looming barge, a candle soaked
Weathered tower rattling
Where you fell, where you fall
A whispering hiss from tail to head

Clawing out from the center of the lid
A bastard coil, bolts of lightning long distilled
A light refracted, smoldering prism of my heart
Gazing inward, Gordian Knot so unbelieved
No time to forget before all is forgotten
