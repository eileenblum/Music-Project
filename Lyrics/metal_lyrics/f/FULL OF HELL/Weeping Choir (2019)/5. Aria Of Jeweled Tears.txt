Thief of one thousand names, whisperer
The stepless step, the gateless gate
Diamond jewel perched inside the mind's eye, within reach
The raining fire, the stinging warmth

You're clawing your way to heaven, but where is your soul?
Praise!
Pierced by a thousand arrows reduced to carbon atoms
Joy!
Youâre probing for weakness, an unwelcome lover
Praise!
Grasping at a heat you will never understand
Joy!

Hurtling violently towards the sun
Hurtling violently towards the sun
Hurtling violently towards the sun
Hurtling violently towards the sun

Fallen thief of one thousand names
Diamond jewel perched inside the mind's eye
