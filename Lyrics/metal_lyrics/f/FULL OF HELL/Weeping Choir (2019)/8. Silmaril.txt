Secrets in the permafrost
Trouble in the barrens
A brilliant glass
An eye of treasure
Thee old wisdom
Unloving
The truth, a piston through your skull
A steel bolt through your frontal lobe
Like a rope is reaching down
A dawn sapling is reaching up
What was wrought is unwrought
What was made now unmade
The truth, a piston through your skull
A steel bolt through your frontal lobe
Humanityâs step unbidden In godâs iron clutch
An eraser to your soul
A smudge across aeons
âAll goes onward and outward. All collapses.â

Wondrous upheaval
