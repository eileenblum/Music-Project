Driven by vagaries to the bottom
Sage lifts burning at both ends
A mortar grinding into a pestle
Overflowing with transmuted gold

Keyless passage
A hall of arches
All doors refracting doors
Like a lachrymose reliquary

A shadow swallows a rusty claymore
Ebbing down into hues of red light
Filling a black cellar with no exit
Like a drape of blood

Filling the cellar like a drape of blood
With my mouth agape
I swallow it all
