Still aligned with Corvus
Muttering incessantly
Thatched roof is muffling the rape of certainty

Still mounted atop old Hircus
Feeding brittle thread through a feeble loom
Offers of the blood pact, now ungiven
Straw &amp; Venus summers imbibed by fog
Entrenched &amp; ensconced
Conduit has grown over
Backsliding vivification
Shrouded in banality, shrouded in death

Still mounted atop old &amp; holy Hircus
Shrouded in banality, shrouded in death
