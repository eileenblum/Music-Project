True blue syphilitic grace, aligned
Pellucid intentions of thine
The knot wood overgrown nursery is reflecting
âCerebrum tuum putridaâ
The Goldfinch &amp; the Tern have begun feasting
On whatâs been left
The grey matter that the soul mate rejected
Cannot subsist on seed husks

Where did it go?
The sense of enchantment, the endeavors of passion?
Thinning hair line, lost in inception, time elapses
The cobbled foundation, so simply begotten, stands monolithic
Wander, swift fox
For love is gone, fertility has passed

Wander, swift fox
For love is gone
[2x]
