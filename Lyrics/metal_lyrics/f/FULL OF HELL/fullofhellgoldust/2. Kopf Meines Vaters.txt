Gums are folded back
Slow revealing rot
Smiling thin through mold admits the one obsessive thought
Emaciated bastard
Hopeless mother fucker
The man is gone &amp; what remains
Still haunts his bones &amp; floods his veins

Mind is under duress
Chased by southern worms
The insects in the ceiling have been gathering in swarms
Innumerable shapes
Delusions exhumed
The walls are leaning inward, the consumer is consumed

It took the head of my father, my sister, my mother
Rejected interventions only bring us together
Consume your failing liver, lose your sense of self
The dimming thoughts of something real degrade the chance to heal
