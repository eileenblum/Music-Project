Two shores exist within my line of sight
Neither is wrong, yet neither is right
The guilt is creeping out from inside my lungs
My diaphragm collapses &amp; consumes everyone
Indecision feeds me to the mouth of the bay
The reef pulls me in
All thoughts become grey
The lights are receding, this remarkable feeling is void
The void awaits [2x]
[2x]
