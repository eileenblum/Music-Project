Conception of life, beginning of the way
Aspiration for perfection's laid into us
All the living strive for light
Though darkness comes nearer
A short joy of existance, fate's ruthless
Blood carries life, life passes with blood
Pain changes pleasure - for ever
Death dictates it's will and all follow it
Life's an agonizing way to death
The living's destined to it
Worthless fussing, little joys
All will come to dust!
Nothing's eternal
All is coming round back
Death is everywhere
Feeling of inevitability...
Sun sets dawn
Dark is spreading
Wind of sorrow
Life comes to a standstill
Lightning blaze
Omen of fear
No way out!
Power of evil!
