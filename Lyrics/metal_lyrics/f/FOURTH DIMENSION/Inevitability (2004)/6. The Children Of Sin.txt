Lower your head, look down under your feet
You'll see dirty freaks, streching their hands to you
They're stinking, they're looking wickedly at you
Too many of them - a horrable sight!
This is filthy product of civilization
The result of reproduction of drunk herd
Born in fucking mud and lust
Children of sin!
Freaking bodies all around
Hungry eyes look into soul
Source of loathcome diseases
Pus discharges all the wounds...
Society of beastly laws, the stronger survive
Injustices pressing your mind, freaks grow in namber
Nobody can change it, the only way out our strength has come to an end
Throw away the needle, otherwise death!
