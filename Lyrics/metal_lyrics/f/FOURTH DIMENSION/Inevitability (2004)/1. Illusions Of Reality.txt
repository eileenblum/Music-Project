You've bought your dream, well
The illusions of reality
It's your way to the hell
To the doom's insanity
Look, your eyes go blind
Think, your minds dying
Play, you games and loose
You loose your lite, guy!
This comp's in yeah blood
Hidden dreams turn's true
You are virtual god
You are virtual killer
The hypnosis of screen
Deletes all the meaning
Your blood and scream
Rejects our beings
Do away with your dream, well
Illusions of reality
Let it's go to the hell
That's fucking devil thing
