Each day were ready to kill other
Horde is pierced with hate it's ready to cause pain
It needs an occasion to splash away it's rage
Look into their eyes - you see hunger and scorn!
Give them the piece of mind
Take away all the doubts, otherwise -
Hell on earth!
Kills the trust into you
The master without property...
You give birth to hate in the consciousness
There's bribery and false smiles all around
Useless wars and needless sacrifieces
Open your eyes, look into the reality!
You're an aged puppet in someone's hands,
A painted mummy speaking into the nothing,
You're a slave of the system your age's short.
Threads are broken, the promises vanish into the air...
Your placell be taken by another guy, everything startsanew
Motion on and around never stops
And he rises his head and spits against the wind...
Same as everybody does like all, but why? why?
Give them the piece of mind
Take away all the doubts, otherwise -
Hell on earth!
Kills the trust into you
The master without property...
