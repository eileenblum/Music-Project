You ramble the maze of the life
Hate, hate is about you
Each step brings in danger
Fright weaves nets all around
You feel you're so unprotected
Panic is growing from inside
You feel you're weak
Weak before the reality
Believe nobody
Cry for no mercy
Tune in to tortures
Tun in to death
Diseases and stupid doctors
Wars and treasons
Venality and greediness
All these is fucking inhumanity!
Pressure to mentality
Brings in insanity
Moral destruction
Fatique and apathy
Human herd
Is all degrading
Madmen at power
You're a fucking puppet!
Take a look into yourself
You just destroy your being
Try and feel you're strong
Don't be like them around
