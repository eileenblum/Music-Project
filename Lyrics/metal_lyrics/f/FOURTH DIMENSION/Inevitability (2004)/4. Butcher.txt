Yore swollen brain gives away the only thought
And it's bleeding red and it's lousy bad!
You wanna feel somebody's flesh
Prey's warm meat on your hands
You wait for coming darkness
To start you're bloody hunt again...
Cut!.. bite!.. tear away!.. rape!.. enjoy it!..
Your eyes shed wild gleam
Hands tremble, mouth dribbles
Death-rattle of your victim...
Ecstasy upon a corpse
Crazy butcher!
Your list of preys is huge but you're still blood-thirsty
Your rusty bleeding knife kills your sense of danger
Now triunph of justice, no blood any more
You're in court, you hear but only:
Final say... stand up... guilty... death...
Enjoy it, bastard...
Your eyes shed wild gleam
Hands tremble, mouth dribbles
Death-rattle of your victim...
But now the victim is you!
Die off, fucking butcher!
Crazy butcher!
