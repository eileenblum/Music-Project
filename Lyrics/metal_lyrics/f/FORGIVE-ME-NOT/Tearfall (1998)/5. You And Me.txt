Swallow the stones that I see in
your eyes
Tell me that fable for bleeding
surprise
When you're old you're full
of desire
Come to my dream but do not
take me higher
Maybe I can't give you all
that you need
I can't buy a ticket for my last trip
Decline of my glamour will sure
let me down
I'm always happy when I see
you frown

And I have told you
We'll be smiling as stars
And I'll you anew

I would never say that you don't
need me
Sunrise came to stay for
me and you
You could find the way to see
my shining
I would never play 'cos this is true

All gales and storms they seem
to be gone
Somebody said that escape
is to run
And when you sleep you look
so serene
I know that we live
for you and for me

And I have told you
We'll be smiling as stars
And I'll you anew

I would never say that you don't
need me
Sunrise came ot stay for
me and you
You could find the way to see
my shining
I would never play
'cos this is true...
