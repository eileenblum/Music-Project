Graveyard wind's hard blowing
Scents of bliss and sweet decay
Saint and devil are roaming
Where truth is never made

Emptiness is everywhere
Gloomy void surrounds me
I'm here to be found
But this thing will never be...
will never be

East and West dwelling as ever
Good and Evil hate each other
Don't try to break this measure
Love and Hate with one
another

Emptiness is everywhere
Gloomy void surrounds me
I'm here to be found
But this thing will never be...
will never be
Will never be...
