Another place of loneliness
Where I keep sorrow
in my heart
When I can feel the last kiss
of fate
Like snakebite
Nothing to hate
No one can stop
my sadness
Things that I say
Don't need the revelation

Now break the silence,
forget your shame
Don't try to run away
from your pain
With bloody hunger,
inside my chest
I drawn in midnight world
It's my guest

I wandered lonely as
a cloud
I've got the time to think,
to find
I see wet fingers of the rain
By my side
Nothing to hate
No one can stop my
sadness
Things that I say
Don't need the revelation

Now break the silence,
forget your shame
Don't try to run away
from your pain
With bloody hunger,
inside my chest
I drawn in midnight world
It's my guest...
