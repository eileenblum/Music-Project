You're depraved but strive
for freedom
Little speck on time's array
You abused the lows of nature
You're treasoned and betrayed

Neverland the land of dreams
Here the slaves rule over kings
The span of life will never end
You return to neverland

Crucify your ranker faith
Set on fire your beliefs
Death is near you, touch
her face
And accept her gentle kiss

Neverland the land of dreams
Here the slaves rule over kings
The span of life will never end
You return to neverland

When you turn for last adieu
You will see eternal flames
They will do no harm to you
You are lord of time and space

Neverland the land of dreams
Here the slaves rule over kings
The span of life will never end
You return to neverland...
