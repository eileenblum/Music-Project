When I see you are to cry
Tears are falling from the sky
And the meaning of
your eyes is strange
I never felt that you loved me
I never thought that
you could see
That magic moment of my life
when I'm free

I never felt that you loved me
I never thought that
you could see

To see the light...

Now I wish that you
could hear
That I'm lonely with my fear
I've been looking at
your eyes for years
Come to me and
soothe my heart
Fill it up with useless art
You're the last to see my light

To see the light...

When I see you are to cry
Tears are falling from the sky
And the meaning of
your eyes is strange
I never felt that you loved me
I never thought that
you could see
That magic moment of
my life when I'm free

I never felt that you loved me
I never thought that
you could see

To see the light...
To see the light...
