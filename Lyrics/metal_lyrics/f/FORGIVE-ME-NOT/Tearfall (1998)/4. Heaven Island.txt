I dream a dream of heaven island
Where justice smoothly dwells
There I'm not forgotten
on that island
But always kissed and
heartly delt
When morning sun starts
crazy smiling
I'm bored and grieved, oh,
to the core
That morning keeps me far from
island
For what I'd sacrifice my gore

Almighty heaven - take me there
Heaven - I'll be yours
Almighty heaven - withering,
take care
Please, let my mind be yours

Possessed by happiness -
that heaven island
Timeless freedom and eternal
grief are their chaos
Pity for the evil lacks it's
bleefing diamond
Future for the friends losing in
that score
I dreamed so much about
heaven island
To dive like a free endevour
for mighty winds caress torn
wings
And take me to the world of
dreams

Almighty heaven - take me there
Heaven - I'll be yours
Almighty heaven - withering,
take care
Please, let my mind be yours

Possessed by happiness -
that heaven island
Timeless freedom and eternal
grief are their chaos
Pity for the evil lacks it's
bleefing diamond
Future for the friends losing in
that score

I dream a dream of heaven island
Where justice smoothly dwells
There I'm not forgotten
on that island
But always kissed and
heartly delt...
