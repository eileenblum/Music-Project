Every cry of heart
Chooses you as home
You aren't in paradise
You're mistaken now you know
waiting has an end

But you are shining brightly
And you can't stand this world
You live and try to live in
You're shining but you're cold

Palace of my dreams
With the nights as walls
And it always seems (to me)
You're mistaken now you know
love will never wait

But you are shining brightly
And you can't stand this world
You live and try to live in
You're shining but you're cold

Fire in your eyes looks
like close door
We hide our signs
we've been livin' for

This reality will fit dreams
I really can't admit
Living partly in my soul
making me achieve my goal
Maybe if I see your smile
heaven will take me tonight
I'll been looking for my way
my last game to play

But you are shining brightly
And you can't stand this world
You live and try to live in
You're shining but you're cold...
