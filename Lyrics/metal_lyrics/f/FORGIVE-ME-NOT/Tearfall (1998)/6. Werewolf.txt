Roaming the planet all around
No need in blood and gore
God beyond this grave is bound
Please, desecrate him no more

Stars are swallowed
by the evening
Total inferno around
Only werewolf is aware
of meaning
Morning is the only
his ground

Darkness, ever darkness reigns
Ever darkness under moon
Darkness, ever darkness drains
Above me breaks through...

I'm alone in this world
Only moon is my bride
I used to be a bloke
But now start to sigh

Roaming the planet all around
No need in blood and gore
God beyond this grave is bound
Please, desecrate him no more

Found a shelter from the whirlwind
Which tears my soul apart
Down caught by that deathgrip
Silly the price of depart

Never been a wolf alive
Kindly human in my soul
Been taught by a cruel life
Pleased and thankful to the bone

Darkness, ever darkness reigns
Ever darkness under moon
Darkness, ever darkness drains
Above me breaks through
Above me breaks through...
