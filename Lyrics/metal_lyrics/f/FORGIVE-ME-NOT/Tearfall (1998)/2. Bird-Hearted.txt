So I wish I could fly
And sincere years of my life
Will never become
The rays of the sun
And I keep traveling in
This unreal world
And maybe soon I will
fly away... away

I'll hear you chirrup
I'll see you fly
Veiled in shawn in the blue sky
Showing you're sane
And keeping warm
Leaving my feeling alone

I know I cannot deny
That I was drowned in your cry
Feeling your lie
I can pretend

When I swear that you're
not the one
I loved in my life
And if you do I will
fly away... away

I'll hear you chirrup
I'll see you fly
Veiled in shawn in the blue sky
Showing you're sane
And keeping warm
Leaving my feeling alone...

Bird-hearted!..
