Sitting down and praying
Eating feelings of my own
You are alone
Getting used to cry
Try to reach the sky the one
That isn't mine
Twilight falls upon us
You just wander under the rain
Falling insane
Candles in my dreams
They look like a great stream
Of my tears

Lonely people will cry
Every dream is a smile (for you)

Deep inside of sadness
You avoid of madness and
Nowhere to go
Losing your attention
You can't stand it but your action
Makes you sleep

And all the tears will fall down
All the birds will fly away
Making haste
If you save your time
I will say good-bye and cry
See you in the sky

Lonely people will cry
Every dream is a smile
And I know where you go
I'm just the last to leave
that tearfall...
