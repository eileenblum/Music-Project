So I've seen you in the box
Thought I would fade away
You were looking like a fox
Asking to stay
I wanna cry and realize
That you will stay with me
And all the clouds should
memorize
You'll never see

'Cos I love you
Love you to much

Some people tell me the story
When you were young and
easy to find
You tried to f**k your own glory
It brought some tears to your mind

After tasting X-tasy
Flying on wings of blood
Nevermind world will say
No need to pray

'Cos I love you
Love you to much

Some people tell me the story
When you were young and
easy to find
You tried to f**k your own glory
It brought some tears to your mind

I'm gonna leave you
And I will send yourself away
I'm gonna leave you
Right now

Some people tell me the story
When you were young and
easy to find
You tried to f**k your own glory
It brought some tears to your mind
