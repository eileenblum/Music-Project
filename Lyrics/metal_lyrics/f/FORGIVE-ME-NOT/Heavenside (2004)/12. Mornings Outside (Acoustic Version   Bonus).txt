See another morning outside when it cries
Makes us feel that we're still alive
Clouds reveal any reason to hide and to find freshing morning outside

The Sun goes up
And my heart beats faster again

I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
I'm on the way of calling
Back the days of my past
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
Mornings of my past

Life turned out to be so easy to start
Make it easy to end
When the new day means to be real
In the end I look for the morning outside

The Sun goes up
And my heart beats faster again

I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
I'm on the way of calling
Back the days of my past
I've got to seek for warning
That every morning can be last
Mornings of my past...
