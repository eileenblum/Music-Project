We sleep and lose control
We must be there and choose our goal

Living in the dusk
You wear a misty mask
We mixed all the times
Walking on the line
Of border to recline
We mixed all the lives

Staring at the lonesome kingdom

We sleep and lose control
We must be there and choose our goal
The river of the time
Went out of my life teasing mind
We keep sleeping we can't go
Laughing at the morning after
Days when we were gone
Roaming in the lonesome kingdom

Penetrating rain
Was humbling me again
When I mixed all the times
Scarlet evidence
I guess I lost sense
When I mixed all the lives

Staring at the lonesome kingdom

We sleep and lose control
We must be there and choose our goal
The river of the time
Went out of my life teasing mind
We keep sleeping we can't go
Laughing at the morning after
Days when we were gone
Roaming in the lonesome kingdom...
