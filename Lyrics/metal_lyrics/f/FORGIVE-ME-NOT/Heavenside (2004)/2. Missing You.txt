I did see you flying
I've been waiting
Tomorrow to be insane
I did see you crying
I was smiling
Tomorrow when I met all saints

The days of leaving all the world
Are never to come
The days of speaking all the words
Are already gone
The time to know you should be there
Ran out of my life
The time to die but don't be scared

Watching mornings after
Always lazy
Endeavours to be alone
Every night I need you
Always empty
Tomorrow when I meet all saints

The days of leaving all the world
Are never to come
The days of speaking all the words
Are already gone
The time to know you should be there
Ran out of my life
The time to die but don't be scared
'Cos I'm behind...
