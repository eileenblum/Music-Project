I know you'll end up dead
Temptation is to strong for me
And my blood froze at sight
Of you redeeming lethargy

Remorse take my life
They stretch in never-ending line
Dive deeper into mind
Disgraceful place of modern crime

Take me out of empty space
There is no time to find trace
Yesterday becomes as real as now
Tears dissolve heart made of stone
Kind of pain that you belong
Do you hear my screaming is too loud...
