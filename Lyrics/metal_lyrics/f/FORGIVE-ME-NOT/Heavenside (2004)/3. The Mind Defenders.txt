Spirits of extinction
Spirits roam around us and they don't appal me
The ways of domination of human mind over the rules
Just get us trying

To struggle with the shadows
The shadows of the mind
On the old dead meadows
The moments when comes the night
To struggle with the defenders standing at the gates of the night
We're running and we're dying

The port into your heart has been closed and laid away
For millions of stars
The day 'round me arises but I'm numb and I can't say
This is too late now

To struggle with the shadows
The shadows of the mind
On the old dead meadows
The moments when comes the night
To struggle with the defenders standing at the gates of the night
We're running and we're dying

It is cold and raining
And the hearts beat as one
But the future won't come
When I'm held in agony
Every night I pray for
For the try to close the door
And the sun is rising
And I feel the pain no more
To struggle with the shadows
The moments when comes the night
To struggle with the defenders standing at the gates of the night
We're running and we're dying...
