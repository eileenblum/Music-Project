So close to the memories of time of my past
breaking the lust&lt;
Those days when we lived in the house of lies
spinning good-byes
We've lost all the passion to live and to survive
ruined inside
The heartache attacks when my heart takes a tax
to be alive

Stay in daylight of clarity
Paint it black for humility

Ambition and fortune brought up my delight
teasing the night
I won't accept all the tears from your eyes
when silence arises
We've lost all the passion to seek and to find
stolen lifelines
You paint all these pictures while we're alive
but black are the stripes

Stay in daylight of clarity
Paint it black for humility

Visual silence is near
Death hardly changes your state
Life has a story to tall
About what it means to be real

Stay in daylight of clarity
Paint it black for humility...
