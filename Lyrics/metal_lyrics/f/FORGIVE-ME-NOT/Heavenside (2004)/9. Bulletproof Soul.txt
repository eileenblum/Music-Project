The time to remain
Caught you in the game
For money to bleach
I want it to stop
But I can't be late
My bulletproof soul

Just fades away
Deny the days of yours
Accept the model of our yesterdays
Bang! Bang! Again
Tomorrow shoots the soul
And never gets me through my veins

It's time to believe
By challenging gods
The time to agree
But it's so hard
I want it to stop
But I can't be late
My bulletproof soul

Just fades away
Deny the days of yours
Accept the model of our yesterdays
Bang! Bang! Again
Tomorrow shoots the soul
And never gets me through my veins!
