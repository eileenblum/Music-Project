Never had a desire to live
Never had to love and believe
Never thought that you are so cruel
Never had my mind so cool
Never shared my wisdom before
Never got all I've looked for
Never lost the life harmony
Never been  but  I wanted to be
The ocean of your eyes

I wander around your shore of life
And see there dying people
They ask my night to share with them forever...oh! never

Never shown my sympathy
Never loved my enemies
Never heard fabulous sounds
Never let somebody down
Never played fanciful games
Never stood under the rain
Never charmed my destiny
Never been  but  I wanted to be
The ocean of your eyes

I wander around your shore of life
And see there dying people
They ask my night to share with them forever...oh! never
The waves of your ocean held me here
I have to choose: to live or to die
Birds fly above the waves of fear
They disappear every night

I wander around your shore of life
And see there dying people
They ask my night to share with them forever...oh! Never...
