Paradise marked my feelings
They're all around
Never kept my soul apart
Tried to get the finish
Running away
With no promises to stay

I'm just rending that truth
You have to prove
I'm just running that way
You chose to move

Leaving alone stepping outside
Didn't ever change my mind
The feelings belong to everlasting bedtime screams
So far away from anywhere
So far away so I don't care
If the morning of the future ever comes

Tears of the lost emotions
The pity for me
Flow entirely overseas
I'm close to get the finish
No losses behind
With no promises to hide

I'm just rending that truth
You have to prove
I'm just running that way
You chose to move

Leaving alone stepping outside
Didn't ever change my mind
The feelings belong to everlasting bedtime screams
So far away from anywhere
So far away so I don't care
If the morning of the future ever comes...
