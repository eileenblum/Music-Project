Can you see
I'm dying all alone
Could you be
The hardest of the stones
Could you ever see
Her forgive me
Could you ever see
Her relive me

She's so bright
When I fly and look around
She's so tired
But she's never lost and found
Fragments of my life
Pass before my eyes
Aching wish to live
Means to wake and rise

You close my eyes
See I'm fragile
Foresights arise
And they don't lie
They break my life into the memories
(I want to get 'em back)
She wants me standing on my knees...
