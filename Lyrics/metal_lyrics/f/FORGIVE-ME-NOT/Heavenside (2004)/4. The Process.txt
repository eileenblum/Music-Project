Always mine a sensual bliss
Always yours what you feel is right
Not a day with some joy to miss
One man stand â got a fight to fight
I face my fear
It has no name
Here I stand come and bring me peace
I disappear it's just the same
Future's now soul prices slashed

Erase the concept of time
And destroy all consequences of progress
'Cause nothing truly is mine
In the maze of resolution and process

Always yours a sensual bliss
Always mine what you feel is right
Not a day with some joy to miss
One man stand â got a fight to fight
I face my fear
It has no name
Here I stand come and bring me peace
I disappear it's just the same
Future's now soul prices slashed

Erase the concept of time
And destroy all consequences of progress
'Cause nothing truly is mine
In the maze of resolution and process..
