I'm sleeping on the cloud
I'm dreaming of the world
You're leaving so long then

I'm hanging on the poles
Those tiny waterfalls
Of your tears that you miss

I'm melting in the rain
I'm anxious to be saint
I'm lying, I'm crying

The feelings underground
The day when they are found
Will be there in my dreams

In paradise I'll leave you run
I'll make you stay just for one day
To be alone like a desert stone
Just let me go that's all I want
