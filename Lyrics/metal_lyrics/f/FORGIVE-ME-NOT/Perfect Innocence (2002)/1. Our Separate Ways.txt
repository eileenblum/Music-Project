Our separate ways we'll go
Our separate loves will be living broken apart
No use of too much crying
Don't waste these tears and save your feelings
For somebody else

Our lives are brought to ruins
But I will never give up trying to free me from love
I never share my sorrow
I never ask you for compassion
'Cos I don't know
My world so bright and free

I don't want you I just want to be
You are now on your own
I can do nothing to make you free
You are now on your own
My eyes are open and I can see
You are now on your own
The world I have it's made for me
You are now on your own

Our separate ways we'll go
Our separate loves will be living broken apart
No use of too much crying
Don't waste these tears and save your feelings
For somebody else
My world so bright and free

I don't want you I just want to be
You are now on your own
I can do nothing to make you free
You are now on your own
My eyes are open and I can see
You are now on your own
The world I have it's made for me
You are now on your own

So long then
I will not remember your wicked love
Oh, yes, it's true
I leave you
I leave you the sky and the stars above
Only for you
