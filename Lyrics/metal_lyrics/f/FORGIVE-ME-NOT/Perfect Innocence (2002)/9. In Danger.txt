My weakest sun refused to shine long ago
My strangest night is covered whole with the snow
I'm able to dream it means that I'm still alive
I think you'd die if you desired to live on this life

I think my life is in danger
It's burning in heaven tonight

The road I'll go is paved with the gold and it's cold
I'll run away I won't come back to this place again
My face is stoned all thoughts are away from me
I'll cease my time I'll blow out the fire that burns in me

I think my life is in danger
It's burning in heaven tonight
