Stars are falling from your eyes
So I can grab 'em
You look like an angel in the skies
Oh you're so blinding
In every morning of my past
I'm pleased but lonely
And I feel passion in my breast
But I'm just dreaming

Waiting in ecstasy
Falling from you and me

In every dream I see you where you fly so high
In every night I see you I know you are mine
In every dream of this world my feeling never ends
I want to be your perfect innocence

Say good-bye to broken hearts
They'll never beat on
Strings of living give no sound
But break the silence
Lonely followers of love
Will make it easy
But I want to make my life the night
For any reason

Waiting in ecstasy
Falling from you and me

In every dream I see you where you fly so high
In every night I see you I know you are mine
In every dream of this world my feeling never ends
I want to be your perfect innocence
