They look for me
I try not to see them
Pretend to be free
They fail to be saved
The task they're afraid
They cry too much

People stand and stare at them
And you can try, enough!
I came to fall and to remain
Any needle you can use again

They live inside me
I try not to feel them
They're turning my life
Into the flames
Their sun still drains
Wet fingers of my rain

People stand and stare at them
And you can try, enough!
I came to fall and to remain
Any needle you can use again
