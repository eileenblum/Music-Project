Exultancy of memory
Shows up eternal fear

Deep inside of framed god
Sweet design of everywhere

Stands still without your soul vision and dies
I wanna feel tomorrow in my heart
And keep the rain inside
I've got to know that you will give a sign
As candid as your smile

Exultancy of memory
Shows up eternal fear

Stands still without your soul vision and dies

I wanna feel tomorrow in my heart
And keep the rain inside
I've got to know that you will give a sign
As candid as your smile
