The sun is dead
The sun has taken you to fantasy
That distant star
Came up to the point of tragedy

Explosive dream
Disrupts the meaning of eternity
The sun is green
Its rays are no more a kind of reality

The planet dies
The planet lies in the hands of mystery
Accepted size
The smallest one in its history

I have to go 'cos I'm losing my reality
But I can't see 'cos I am already blind
I have to go 'cos I'm losing my serenity
I have to leave 'cos I'd rather be alive

It smells like rain
It smells like being in disharmony
It feels like pain
When nature suffers from my vanity

I have to go 'cos I'm losing my reality
But I can't see 'cos I am already blind
I have to go 'cos I'm losing my serenity
I have to leave 'cos I'd rather be alive

I wanna fly to nowhere
I wanna fly from my own home
I wanna be a pilot
The pilot of the planet soul
I wanna see that nowhere
And keep my feelings in my heart
I wanna be a pilot
The pilot of a dying star
