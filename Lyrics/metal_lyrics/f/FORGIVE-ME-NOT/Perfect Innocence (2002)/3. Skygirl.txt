Her eyes never seem to be lying
Her eyes never seem to be crying
But they fly so high

When I take a look around see you everywhere
In every breath of sun when you're gone
When I see you cry and rain falling down on me
You're throwing all your tears about me

When my sun turns to you and yours turns to me
The skygirl lives in you
She lives for me

I wanna drown in your eyes
I'll be fine even if you're shining
I wanna fly in your skies
To be the only your cloud even if I die

Every smile of dying sun is kept in me
The everlasting pain lost in flames
When you try to blow your mind it fails to be
Enough for final truth you don't wanna lose
When my sun turns to you and yours turns to me
The skygirl lives in you
She lives for me

I wanna drown in your eyes
I'll be fine even if you're shining
I wanna fly in your skies
To be the only your cloud even if I die
