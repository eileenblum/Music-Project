I see your face so ghastly
I need to run so fast you know
And if I touch you lastly
I need to see you go home

My hands tied again
When you want me to play (the game)

I never cheat
I gonna breath
I stand on my knees
I should do it to be released

Devote you rain to my soul
Your eyes are raining with the gold
They lead my soul to silence
Make us believe in something new

My hands tied again
When you want me to play (the game)

I never cheat
I gonna breath
I stand on my knees
I should do it to be released
