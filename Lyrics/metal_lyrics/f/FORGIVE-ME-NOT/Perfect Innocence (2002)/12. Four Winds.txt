The sky of destiny's still raining
Your eyes are open wide they don't lie
The sky is covered with the clouds
Brought here finally by four wind

Four winds play some strange game with me
They play unfairly my eyes don't see
My mind is blind it flies away from me
Being in extasy of destiny

The clouds are calling for the winds
Four winds are changing memories
They stay and make another day
The day for which I'll never pray

I never dreamed so much 'bout heaven
It still remembers me and I can see
That ever breath that I pretend to do
Tears me apart from you
Apart from you

The clouds are calling for the winds
Four winds are changing memories
They stay and make another day
The day for which I'll never pray

Heal me winds of life
Heat me never ending light
Turn me to the ashes
Take me to the land of cry
Heal me winds of life
Heat me never ending light
Leave me I'm so empty
Feel me but no more questions why

Leave me I'm so empty
Feel me but no more questions why...
