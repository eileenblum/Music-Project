Hurricane woke up your mind
To play the game that's called a life
As cold as snow it's frozen you will know
The way of rose is insincere
The rain of lies leaks out my ears
You live too much
Guess what I mean

Anyway you've lost the light
The day you lived became a night
The darkest night you have ever seen
Dilute the brain and step aside
A vision ghost will change this night
The scene of blood is now your new guide

Your religion is in me
Don't tell me that you could be
The cloud that leaves me flies away
We'll never be the same

Everyday led by emotions
You never think it's your devotion
You bite your soul and nowhere to go
Hit the soul by thorn destruction
Let it be your mind conduction
Praise the night
You final painful night

Your religion is in me
Don't tell me that you could be
The cloud that leaves me flies away
We'll never be the same

Your religion is in me
Don't tell me that you could be
The cloud that leaves me flies away
We'll never be the same
