It has just been notified that a b-2 aircraft has been sent to ex-Jugoslavia
to end the fightings between the Serbs and Croatians. According to military
sources the plane is armed with a nuclear bomb. The bomb has been set to hit
Sarajevo tonight.

We fly above our target destination
No resistance â total devastation
I realize my power as I hold the switch
Cleared to go â and ready to drop
The Bomb!!!

The war in Sarajevo has now been
Going on for far too long
Time is at hand â to stop this â madness
Endless war!!!

Important people have now decided to
Eliminate the Serbs and Croatians

Once and for all
We drop The Bomb
And make âem fall
Once and for all
We drop The Bomb
And make âem fall

Helpless soldiers unaware of the fires
Unprotected by their shelters

Sitting ducks for The Bomb!!!

How can one man decide the fate
Of all their lives
I would never find peace of mind
But orders are orders
If I deny â they'll destroy my life

Catastrophe in the Adriatic sea after a B-2 aircraft carrying a nuclear bomb
crashed into the ocean. We have reasons to believe that the pilot was
suicidal
