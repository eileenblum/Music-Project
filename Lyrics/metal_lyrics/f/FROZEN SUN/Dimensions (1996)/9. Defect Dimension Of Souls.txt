Insane people suffocate â from their lives
In between we all live a life in vain
Exterior appearance
In nature we all look alive
Inside we die â slowly but sure

A malevolent way of life
Put on this earth to suffer
A lifelong humiliation
Implanted in our minds
Abnormal creation
A defect sub-dimension
Inside we die â slowly but surely

Illusions spin in my mind â reality denied
Fate has chose its way
Iâll die and burn in decay
Iâm a castaway â I hear what they say
A mental pray â suffering day by day

I seek a light in my darkness
Expire from life â Iâm free when I die

See the dark in my eyes
Septic - distress healing my life
Epileptic â paroxysm inside
Enslavement â no way out weâll find
So please help me - take my life!

I seek a light in my darkness
Expire from life â Iâm free when I die
Defect dimension â defect dimension of souls
