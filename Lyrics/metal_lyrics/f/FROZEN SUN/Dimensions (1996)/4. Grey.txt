Welcome to this world
Where everythingâs grey

We see the obligation of fighting for
What we believe in
But some donât see the line
Trying to protect the cultureâs in which they live
Without recognizing their crimes

But I think for myself
Thatâs why they put me in this Hell
Iâm a player in the game
No choice is mine â but to die again
Scared to die â why?
From this erupt world

We are all fighting a battle
We have already lost
Fading and fading â right before our eyes
Right before our fucking eyes!

What the fuck is this world coming to?
I canât break away
Trapped in this world of lies and betray
Canât break away
Left in this jail called society
Everythingâs grey
Without colours â total decay
Canât break the fuck away

Children are raised under fanatic conditions
With pride born into their hearts
Still born without sympathy
In a society â who take away their rights

But I think for myself
Thatâs why they put me in this Hell
Iâm a player in the game
No choice is mine â but to die again
Scared to die â why?
From this erupt world
