I eliminate offence â protect the innocent
Against all harsh realities
Iâm constantly fighting offensive
Subject the messages of youthal fear
Torture â murder â isolation â violence
I create the silence

To tell their stories â to fulfill their lies
The are using the trust they are given
To create a perfect day â society

Censorship equals perfect society
Censorship equals false reality
Censorship equals
Censorship equals

Ignorance breed fear â fear breed hate
Two vital feelings in this world I created
Ignorance breed fear â fear breed hate
Two vital feelings in this world

In my favor the law is on my side
Thereâs nowhere to hide

I crave my sacrifices â destroy the liberty of speech
Through violent police actions
Using all whatâs in my reach
Bashing down demonstrants
I get them out of my way
Torture â murder â isolation â violence
I create the silence
