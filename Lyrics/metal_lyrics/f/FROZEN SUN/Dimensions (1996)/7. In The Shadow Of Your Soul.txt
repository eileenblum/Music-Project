In confusion
I never knew how you felt about me
My devotion â now I guess youâll never see it
My love to you will never be â recognized

You saw me as a liar â a god damn liar
Fooling your emotions
Enjoying my deceptions

Now I am left to rot
Left with nothing but hatred
Relieved of pain, yet suffering
In the shadow of your soul - I rot

Enslaved by addiction to pain
Iâm alway suffering
Possessed by a lust to hurt myself and others
Humiliating mentality
With a grasp of verbal superiority
The demons in your head
You gave âem all to me

In the shadow of your soul
The key to my freedom lies
Buried down next to your casket
Iâll never be free until I die

You saw me as a liar â a god damn liar
