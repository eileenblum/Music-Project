Streetwalker is what they call me
âCause thatâs what I do
From the streets of freedom
With no place to go
Nature is my home and here I belong
To walk the streets of freedom
And sing my streetwalker song

The bottle is my friend
It makes me take control
Satisfying my soul

Inhaling whiskey one by one
Crying out for more and more
The only thing I can ever trust
Helping me through the day and night

Once I had wealth in my hand
I was following the game
I had a wife and child
A life so undefiled

Suddenly Death came into my life
Took my wife and child
He too them away â yet I was the prey
I had to stay â suffering day and night

Inhaling whiskey one by one
Crying out for more and more

Now Iâm the streetwalker
Put my life behind as I leave my home
Trying to cope with life
But life is too strong for me
Enjoying the silence â away from all violence
An exodus for my soul
Where I have control â control - control
