My gift in this life includes hate
Mutilate, humiliate
Expurgate all weakened souls
Iâm still seen as a human enormity
Depict in puss, gore ânâ decay

I love the blood that flows free in my hands
The dick is rising in my pants
A dead blowjob is what I need â to come

Atrocious slaughter â creating disorder
Pulling the trigger in the back of a head

Suffer my pain

Nerves quiver - blood soaking
Brainfluids flowing
From a child now dead
A personal lust against the rest

Six year old pussies are divine
Hard to fuck â but screams a lot

Morbid sexual abuse
Forced to suck â until they drop

Just last week a girl was plying down the street
Turning me on I felt her nails ripping my skin
Anxious as I were I cracked her ass as I stuck it in
Dying with me

My gift in this life includes hate
Mutilate, humiliate
Expurgate all weakened souls
Iâm still seen as a human enormity
Deceit in puss, gore ânâ decay

Hollowed corpses â decorate my home
Flesh and bones â represent my throne
It is my temple â so come with me inside
I need your flesh â for my delight
Now
