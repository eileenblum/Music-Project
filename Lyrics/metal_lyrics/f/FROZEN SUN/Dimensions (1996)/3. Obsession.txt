In darkness we all roam
Among the shadows
Souls trapped from chemical waste
Useless minds â paralyzed minds

In Hell I fight to save my soul
The one thing I seek is control
But in Hell Iâll stay
Living only day by day
With dislocated emotions

I was told to give up this life
To live on insecticide
Flying â trying â dying!

Abstain to this insanity â realized itâs pain
Reject while you still face reality
Or nothing shall remain
A spiritual elimitation

I was told to give up this life
To live on insecticide
Trying â flying â dying!

In Hell I fight to save my soul
The one thing I seek is mental control
But in Hell Iâll stay
Living only day by day
With dislocated emotions

I hear the screams
Fading â dying
