Life in misery
Life in misery

Why resist â when no one makes a sacrifice anymore
Why exist â when our egos reflect the greed of a carnivore
Predict â The End is coming nearer and no one gives a shit
Expect â nothing in return

World demise
Our nature is already dead

Realize â weâre living on borrowed time
Victimized â all our chances to survive
Digitalize â our ways; our thoughts seem almost
Hypnotized â animalized!
Expect nothing in return

Why should I keep on giving
Life donât give me shit in return
All the good things time kept stealing
People died before my eyes
Friendships ended
Intrigues were created
Small details turning into chaos
Life is a bitch and then you die, die

Why resist â when no one makes a sacrifice anymore
Why exist â when our egos reflect the greed of a carnivore
Predict â The End is coming nearer and no one gives a shit
Expect â nothing in return

World demise
Our nature is already dead, dead, dead, dead

No oneâs true to themselves
Deceive meant in a way we canât control
Betrayed by the governments we trust
The media is printing nothing but lies!

Why should I keep on giving
Life donât give me shit in return
All the good things time kept on stealing
People died before my eyes
Friendships faded
Intrigues were created
Small details turning into chaos
Lifeâs a bitch and then you die
Die, die slow
