This is Hell on Earth
Everything reduced to ash
In the name of God
For the good of the common man
If the Devil deals in death, I will sell my soul
To watch you die
To see you burn
To make you suffer like the ones you sacrifice
In the name of God

There will be no funeral
There will be no ceremony

I owe you no redemption

Nothing to honor in your greed
No one to mourn your loss of life
There will be no love lost on wasted sorrow

Spill our blood in his name
Hell on Earth
Reduce to ash
Blacken out the sun
In the name of God

This is Hell on Earth
In the name of God
