Paralyzed by the overwhelming sense of failure
The weight of guilt and the dirt beneath my fingernails
I cant erase your stench from my skin
Ill never let you get away with what you did to me

I dont think you get the point
I dont think you understand just how far Ill go
All youve ever made me want to do is slit your throat

Never a word to be spoken from your mouth again

You are the empty well I placed my heart in
Now I will be the shallow grave you bury your life in

Your suffering will be the end of mine
Grind your teeth on this you fucking pig
Punishment to fit the crime
Ill watch you slip away
Im sorry it had to end like this

Ill watch you slip away

The trails of blood and flesh
Will lead them to whats left of you

I dont think you get the point
I dont think you understand
All I want to do is slit your throat

Its going to be a cold day in Hell before I let you ruin my fucking life
Its going to be a cold day in Hell before I let you live your life
