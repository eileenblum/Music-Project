[feat. CJ McMahon of Thy Art Is Murder]I am human
I am horror
I am the creator and the destroyer
A black cloud of corrosive breath
I am the giver, the taker, the messenger of death

Relentless in our pride of never-ending faults
We make the oceans rise and turn cities into salt

No time to care about the cost of living
Civilized suicide
No exoneration
This is our home yet still we destroy

On a warpath we will never return
And we are never coming back
Victims of a repetitive past
Our future was never meant to last

I am human
I am horror
I am the creator and the destroyer
A black cloud of corrosive breath
I am the giver, the taker, the messenger of death

Bright blood red
The eyes of man
Writhing in sickness
Speaking in whispers
Bright blood red
The eyes of man
Swimming in sadness
Slow and silent killers

We were born with death upon our backs
Playing god will never be enough
We want the heaven without the hell
But the devil knows better than us
He'll just let us destroy ourselves

Smoke of the sun
Let the rain fall as ash
We were born into this world with death upon our backs
We were born with death upon our backs
We were born with death, with death upon our backs
