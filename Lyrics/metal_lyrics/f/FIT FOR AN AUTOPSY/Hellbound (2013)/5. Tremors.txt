Mountains of bones
Piled high for the picking
Lift our skin to the sky
The tremors wonât end
This is just the beginning
Unwanted fruit of the harvest
Stillborn and barely living
The cries of the abandoned
Stuck between the teeth
A life so fucking sickening
I watched them burn alive in front of me
I watched them take my life out from under me
For nothing
We are nothing
An iron furnace
Filled with ashes of our once great aspirations
This is not what weâre meant to be
Scarred and blinded
My eyes have seen all they can see
Born with burden
Place the blame on destiny
Shattered cemented hearts
Sink like stones
Swept through the currents
They wander through the mountains of bones
I watched them burn alive in front of me
I watched them take my life out from under me
For nothing
We are nothing
Hellbound
Take down narrow paths
An atlas crafted by desperate hands
Never revel in the glory of our past
Those lost direction
Mountains of bones
Piled high for the picking
Lift our skin to the sky
The tremors wonât end
This is just the beginning
Unwanted fruit of the harvest
Stillborn and barely living
The cries of the abandoned
Stuck between the teeth
A life so fucking sickening

The tremors wonât end
Dilated eyes
In hospital beds
Filled with dead dreams
And dead friends
Take me away from this life
So fucking sickening
The tremors wonât end
The tremors wonât end
