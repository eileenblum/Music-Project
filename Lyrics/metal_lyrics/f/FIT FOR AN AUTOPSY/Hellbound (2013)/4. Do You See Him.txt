For shepherds we shall be
Leaders and liars cultivating the weak
Numb and trembling, hand in hand
Cowards we walk in shame
Bound to possessions like a noose on our throats
We deserve to choke upon the ash and sand
Sink the structures of a modern wasteland
Ripe with propaganda and prejudice
The failed mechanics of man
We play the part
The dawn of the hollow heart
Sick, sad world
No one can save us
Let it all drown in a river of blood
For shepherds we shall be
Leaders and liars cultivating the weak
Numb and trembling, hand in hand
Cowards we walk in shame
Bound to possessions like a noose on our throats
We deserve to choke
And maybe I'm a cynic
But its just too clear
And maybe I'm a monster
But I refuse to live in fear of a world that hates me
I wish it would all just disappear
Though I may bear the burden
We all share the shame
Together we fail
We all fan the flamesWe all wear the mask
We all know his name
Do you see him?
He walks as one with you
Do you see the Devil inside of you?
Do you see him?
He stands in step with you
Do you see the Devil inside of you?
Do you see him?
