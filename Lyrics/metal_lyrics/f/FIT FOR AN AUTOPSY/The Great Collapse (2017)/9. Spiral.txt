Embrace true emptiness
Embrace true emptiness
Behind the eyes the beast in man is never far
Dormant until we accept what we are
No saints
No grace

There is no relief
From the mountains of grief
Intricately, assembled stone by stone
The art of deception
In theory and practice
Smothers any compassion
We could hope to salvage

There is no progress
When forward motions just a test of another man's lust for greed
The will to resist
Disappears in the midst
Staining the sky in eternal misery

Intertwined in end times, wondrous webs of deceit we weave
Behind the eyes, the beast in man is never far
Only dormant until we accept what we are

Don't save me
There's nowhere to stay
That doesn't bear the scars of yesterday

Don't save me
There's nowhere to stay
That doesn't bear the scars of yesterday

Embrace true emptiness

Embrace true emptiness
Behind the eyes the beast in man is never far
Dormant until we accept what we are

No saints
No grace

The last lights, drift deep down into the spiral
Where shame and denial are forever and final

The last lights, drift deep down into the spiral
Where shame and denial are forever and final

Don't save me. Nomad on an orphan earth
There's nowhere to stay
That doesn't bear the scars of yesterday

Don't save me. Nomad on an orphan earth
There's nowhere to stay
That doesn't bear the scars of yesterday

Don't save me
Don't save me
