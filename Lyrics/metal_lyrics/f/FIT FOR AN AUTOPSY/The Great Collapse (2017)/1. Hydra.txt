I watched a man die in the cold.
He slept in the street. 
We left him there with nothing to eat
I watched a man burn in the coals. Shoveling shit into a furnace, trading a check for his soul
The city is a fucking prison.
Force fed failure, eat what you're given
The ivory tower, the higher power, I swear their laughing as we claw at the scraps
We were the lions now we bow to the hydra, cause when you cut off the head, fucking two grow back
See them at their worst.
Another day goes by, everything I love dies in the passenger side of the hearse
Lower the bar.
It's pathetic to think.
I knew their souls would sink, but I never knew how far
Repetition is only failure.
Repetition is only failure.
Repetition is only failure.
Repetition is only failure.
The cycle repeats
A march towards defeat
The wretched accept it, a bleak tomorrow
The fathers of greed sow the seeds for sons of sorrow
I watched a man die in the cold
He slept in the street
We left him there with nothing to eat
I watched a man burn in the coals
Shoveling shit into a furnace, trading a check for his soul
The city is a fucking prison
Force fed failure, eat what you're given
The ivory tower, the higher power, I swear they're laughing as we claw at the scraps
We were lions now we bow to the hydra, cause when you cut off the head fucking two grow back
I watched a man die in the cold
I watch a man burn in the coals
