When the world is empty of souls, it will become so clean
Silent death
Assimilation 
Hammers of seven hells fall from above
Settle the final debt, forced adaptation
Void of regret, absent of love
Subdue the lands until they bow at the broken will of man
Inescapable fate
The earth will swallow all that it can, until it finally reclaims the hell we create
When the world is empty of souls, it will become so clean
Terraform 
Annihilation, the human curse
Worthless warnings, terror swarming
Self preservation, ancient rebirth
Endless mourning, terraforming
Silent death 
Hammers of seven hells from above
