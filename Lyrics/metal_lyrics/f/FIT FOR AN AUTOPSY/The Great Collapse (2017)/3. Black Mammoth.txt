Fools gold, siphoned and sold, merchants of death
Dead in spirit, now dead in flesh
Born of violent flames, landscapes of ashes 
The roots soak up the rain, burning in acid 
The wounds are cauterized, and left un-bandaged 
Wilting beneath a sun, withered and damaged
Tragedy reigns forever
Rejoice in masses 
The tribe collapses
The mother weeps in her dying breath
Rise from the ashes, oh foul black mammoth
Dead in spirit, now dead in flesh
Tread on sacred terrain, envenomed and ravaged
The peace upon the plain, seized by the savage
Primitive practices, uproot and vanish
Modern barbarians, new rite of passage
Rejoice in the masses 
The tribe collapses
The mother weeps in her dying breath
Rise from the ashes, oh foul black mammoth
Dead in spirit, now dead in the flesh
Tragedy reins forever
