Feed the fire
Until it expires
Callous enemies, abandon sanity
Villains of vanity, design a life so clearly unstable
Dead remnants left adrift 
Red rivers fill the rift 
Poisonous pools emit an atmosphere just barely not fatal
Seven billion leeches
Squirming towards extinction
Tremendous fucking casualties of the human condition
All your material things mean nothing when bulbs burn out
All your material dreams mean nothing when the bulbs burn out
All the oil and blood will seep back into the mud when the bulbs burn out
Will you see you've done as it comes undone when the bulbs burn out
Feed the fire
Until it expires
