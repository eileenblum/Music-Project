Leave the room
It was empty before and it is empty still
Cross bearer 
Lost prayer 
Lord give me nothing, I've already lost my will
To begin or end, never again
The nature of a broken soul is to beg, but the burden of pity is greater than the calm
Resounding stronger than relief, I welcome the harm
The clashing conscience of a coward
Low hanging spirit, soul devoured
I never wanted to live in a world that would kill me
I never wanted a father who wouldn't forgive me
Please leave the room
It was empty before and it is empty still 
Inver wanted to live a world that would kill me
I never wanted a father who wouldn't forgive me
The man with two hats
Identified by one, embellished and black
The man with two hats
Distressed and divine
Fragile and white
Where do you hang them? 
How do you tell them apart when you tear them apart? 
Leave the room
It was empty before and it is empty still
Burning in hellfire, numb to the touch
I'm left to fix this fractured actor on my own
Artificial man
Sacrificial lamb
Love to dust
I've given up
I never wanted to live in a world that would kill me
I never wanted a father wouldn't forgive me.
