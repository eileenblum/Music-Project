Death's breath on the back of our neck
The bitter taste of blood, flowing in floods
Consuming all the rations, neglect is a crime of passion
I don't believe we've earned our keep or deserve this peace, self centered catastrophes
Armies of fools will fall.
Nights of no end
Writing on the wall
War is now the will of your God
The prophets hands are stained
War is now the will of your God
Heads will hang
All hail the antiheroes
Life reduced to ones and zeros
Expand and expire
Voices of reason retire
The threat is real, when you can feel the pain they feel
The writings on the wall
War is now the will of your God
The prophets hands are stained
War is now the will of your God
Heads will hang
Soul seller
Fortune teller
Plague bearer
The fog won't lift
First world counterfeits
The great collapse now justified
Peace is merely a gift for the privileged, safeguarded from the pain
This indifference is paid in blood
All hands our stained
The grip of oppression tightens the noose, but when they kick out the chair, heads will hang
War is now the will of your God.
