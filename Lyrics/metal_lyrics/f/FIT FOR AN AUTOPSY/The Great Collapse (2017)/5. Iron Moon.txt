Do you feel numb, or are you really just over it?
Old timer
Slave driver
Crack the whip while they sink our ship
Clocking in, work till the bones ache
No warmth so the hands shake
The pills suppress the pain, but the dependence is ever-growing
A fools devotion, devoid of motion
This mistake you can't erase
The bag may not inflate while oxygen is flowing
A coward ruled by force breeds a nation of discord, and a lifetime of remorse
No more
I'd rather suffocate than breathe in what this bullshit life has offered me
Defiance 
The new dawn of the iron moon
You should have let sleeping dogs lie, cause now they're hunting you 
Wallow in what could have been thumb twiddler
You handed them the keys to the kingdom, signed and delivered 
Do you feel numb, after the damage is done?
Do you remember the days when we didn't have to look over our shoulders?
Now we flinch at the kick, and head down the wrong track
We let them takeover
Fear is the final sin
Before it even begins, this rat race was over
A fools devotion, devoid of motion
This mistake you can't erase
The bag may not inflate while oxygen is flowing
I'd rather suffocate than breathe in what this bullshit life has offered me
Defiance 
The new dawn of the iron moon
You should have let sleeping dogs lie, cause they're hunting you
