Old ashes from repeated mistakes
Hell in a shadow that I can't escape
It's too late, it's too late
Dreams of love, dreams of sex, dreams of joy, dreams of peace
Lie in sickbeds with sweat stained sheets
You only regress, no matter how long you rest
You get what you fucking get
It's too late 
Another man falls down
Serenity, the condition we lack
When you finally accept your surroundings, you can cut through the fat
To the meat of the soul
One grand old hole
Stiff, blue, and cold
And now I know it's too late
A sinners dance of endless posturing 
Who the fuck are you when no one's watching?
Inescapable 
Undeniable 
Uncontrollable
Dreams of love, dreams of sex, dreams of joy, dreams of peace
Lie in sickbeds with sweat stained sheets
You only regress, no matter how long you rest
You get what you fucking get
It's too late
Another man falls down
Irreversible
Inescapable
Undeniable
Uncontrollable
