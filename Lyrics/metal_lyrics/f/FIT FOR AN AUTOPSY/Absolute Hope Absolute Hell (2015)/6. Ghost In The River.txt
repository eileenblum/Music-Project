Lay me deep in the mountain
Frozen limbs collapse as they climb
The impossible horizon
My will is broken
My eyes have seen what they've always known
Every man has a shadow behind him
Every soul

Every soul has a price in gold

Out of breath
We've stripped the lungs of its vessels and it's arteries
And now we drown in death
Numb to the pain of our man made blasphemy

We're the ghost in the rivers
So ashamed of our own reflection
And the demons stare back with eyes as mirrors
In a gaze forever fixed in our direction

Fire and vine
Human and serpent entwined
Force down the hand of foul will
As the world grows all the things it can kill

Lay me deep in the waters
Sunken limbs collapse as they try
To reach for the shoreline
Souls to left wade and wallow
Cries of sorrow call my name

My will is broken
My eyes have seen what they've always known
Every man has a shadow behind min
Every soul has a price in gold

We're the ghost in the rivers
So ashamed of our own reflection
And the demons stare back with eyes as mirrors
In a gaze forever fixed in our direction

Fire and vine
Human and serpent entwined
Force down the hand of foul will
As the world grows all the things it can kill
