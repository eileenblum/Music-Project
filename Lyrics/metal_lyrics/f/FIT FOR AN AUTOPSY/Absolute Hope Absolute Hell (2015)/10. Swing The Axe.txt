Wish I had known that life lets you down
Wish I had known that everyone drowns
In a sewer just a puddle of swill and spit

And I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
Cause it all smells like bullshit
We came into this world pure and shining
And now we drag through the mud
Bitching and whining
As machines carry us to other machines
To churn the chemicals that kill everything
That was once serene

It falls on our heads
like the axe
Like the mortars
Like a righteous intervention

It falls on our heads
Like the rain
Like the pain
We're the victims of ill intention

Denial and consumption
Poisoned by our own production
Tell me who do we blame
When the first turn up dead
And the children are born with disfigured heads
When the ground won't produce
And the leaves don't grow back
As the fires burn forever

In the lines of smoke stacks
Let the lights burn out
Squander the resources further
The droughts
Pretend they'll be a solution as we drown in the swill and polution

Life is a cycle of sin and sorrow
All we know are the crims we commit
Life is a cycle of sin and sorrow
We made our bed
And now we'll lie in it
We made our bed
And now we'll lie in it

Are we so diluted in this septic tank
That we turn to plague and poison
Like a temporary savior
No whispers of healing
No help no warning
It falls on our heads

Like the axe
Like the mortars
Like a righteous intervention

It falls on our heads
Like the rain
Like the pain
We're the victims of ill intention

It falls on our heads
The world is dead
Swing the axe, it falls on our heads
Swing the axe, it falls on our heads
The world is fucking dead
