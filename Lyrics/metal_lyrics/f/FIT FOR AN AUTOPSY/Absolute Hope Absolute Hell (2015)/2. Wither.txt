Put me in the fucking ground
Ugly fucking gods, ugly fucking heroes
Bow to your masters
Count your worthless fucking zeroes

Look me in the eye and tell me I'm a sap
Like the trees that leak green gold
Suck it out till they all collapse

I'm not a victim, at least I never thought I was
I'm just a product of my environment
Just the salted fucking slug

Pocket stuffer, motherfucker, soul stealer, bottom feeder
Just put me in the fucking groud
Ugly fucking gods, ugly fucking heroes
Bow to your masters count your worthless fucking zeroes

Watch me wither
I'm just the salted fucking slug watch me wither
I'm just the salted fucking slug watch me wither
I'm just the salted fucking slug born to burn
Give unto the pigs what they year
Give me hate in your handshake
Give me hell in pain I embrace it

Born to die
Born to rot in a soup of flies

Leave me in the pines
Let my body become the decay in my mind
We all deserve the shovel
We all deserve the crown
To a kingdom of dirt and devils

So just put me in the fucking groud
A kingdom of dirt and devils
Nothing more, nothing less
A kingdom of dirt and devils
Nothing is pure, nothing is left.
