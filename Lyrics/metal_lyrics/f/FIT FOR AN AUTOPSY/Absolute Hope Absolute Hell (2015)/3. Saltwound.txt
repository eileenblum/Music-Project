Home in the absence of light
Hammer the rusted nail deeper into my side
Fill me with needles and thorns
Down to the blone, the grey turns to black
The soul of the shapard exposed

Ruin
Lay the cities to ruin
Let the lifeblood envelop the sea
In crimson and chaos
We are reborn into suffering

Saltwound
Every night is a night that I wish would end
Saltwound
Every fight is a fight that I cannot win

God is a lie and man is a failure
God is a lie and man is a failure

I wanna reach out
But there's a disconnect
Between the ones we love
And the ones we neglect
The lines gone dead
But the receivers tone beats the silence
No operator, just hardwired to a world of violence

All I ever wanted was the truth
That the hell in me is the hell in you

Here's the fucking truth
Sometimes people should just fucking die
Stop pretending that's wrong, stop pretending it's a lie
Sometimes people should just fucking die
Stop pretending that's wrong, stop pretending it's a lie

Saltwound
Every night is a night that I wish would end
Saltwound
Every fight is a fight that I cannot win
