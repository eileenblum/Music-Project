The old man is gone, I hope he's drifting out to sea
He always loved to swim away
First the bottle, then drugs, then the apathy
Maybe he'll an island with a sycamore shaded tree
Just like the one in our year
Just like when it was him and me

Everything you love lets you down
Every wish sails away, every ounce of hope drowns
Everything you love lets you down
Every wish sails away, every ounce of hope drowns
