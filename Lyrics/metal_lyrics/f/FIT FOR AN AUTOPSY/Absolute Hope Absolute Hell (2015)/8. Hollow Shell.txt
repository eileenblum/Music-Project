Mourners in the hallway
Don't turn the lights out
For they await the passing

The devil knows, he always knows
How to find out where we hid the lashings
Show him your skin
Show him your skin
He knows the scars come from within
Let him in

Man is a hollow shell, how easy it breaks
So fuck being the victim
You live and die by your mistakes
Capable fucking failures
We let ride, like rookies at the table
We let it die, alone in the fallout

We deserve the fate we've enabled
I am the pariah
I am the liar who speaks the truth
I am the architect, sewing seeds of change that bear no fruit.

Dust, all I taste is blood and dust
The fogs are smothering
Rust coat the kingdoms in blood and rust
The lands are suffering

Shower the world in violence
Shower the world in violence
Fuck all this false sense of security
Fuck all the prophets and the parasites that cling to me
Fuck all these selfish self-righteous hypocrisy
We're nothing more than the demons in our arteries.

Man is a hollow shell, how easy it breaks
So fuck being the victim
You live and die by your mistakes
Capable fucking failures
We let ride, like rookies at the table
We let it die, alone in the fallout

We deserve the fate we've enabled
I am the pariah
I am the pariah
