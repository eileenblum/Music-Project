We'll tear this whole fucking world apart. Condemn the crown, deny
your faith, and kill the messenger. Embrace the end with open arms.
Watch the sky turn black as we cease to exist. The sign of the son of
man will appear in the sky, and all of the nations of earth will
mourn. We will tear this fucking world apart, searching for salvation.
We will tear this fucking world apart, in the face of damnation. We've
been given every chance to put an end to this insanity. Have we lost
our faith in God, or has he lost his faith in humanity? Maybe it is
him who does not believe in the ever failing will of man.The ability
to change is but a choice not a destiny placed in our hands.
Punishment for taking everything for granted. Never ending sickness,
absolute chaos, all the nations of the earth will mourn. Pestilence,
famine, war, hell on earth. Your day of judgement approaches. None
spared by the hands of the conquerer. Beneath the wings of the raven,
a new beginning. Rising from the ashes of toppled empires standing on
the broken backs of fallen giants. We will rejoice in the guilt. It is
our nature to destroy. We will tear this whole fucking world apart.
Searching for salvation, we will tear this fucking world apart, in the
face of damnation, we'll cease to exist.
