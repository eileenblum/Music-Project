What makes you think that you're the only fucking one worthy of a
throne in a kingdom of gold?Selling your soul for the fortune in lies
that you have told. False prophet of misery. Feasting on the minds of
the weak. Twisting the words of dead men to suit your perverse
beliefs. Disciple of dishonor. Loyal heir of unjust grief. Forked
tongue and scales for skin. You'll never see the light of day again.
King of all kings. Serpent divine. Savior of fools. Martyr to none.
You will die for nothing. Father of bastards. I am the executioner.
Mother of mercy, praise be to those who've died in vain. Whose
glorious conquest is this? Whose failed crusade? What lucid dreams of
destiny. You follow in your wake. The shadows of the trampled tombs
will forever haunt your steps. A cowards life you lead. A liar and a
thief. The despair you reap has sowed itself inside your veins. King
of all kings. Serpent divine. Savior of fools. Martyr to none. You
will die for nothing. Father of bastards. I am the executioner. Mother
of mercy, praise be to those who've died in vain. You'll never see the
light of day again. False prophet of misery. Feasting on the minds of
the weak. Twisting the words of dead men to suit your perverse
beliefs. Disciple of dishonor. Loyal heir to the unjust grief. Waiting
for your chance to be crucified on a monument of shit.
