Flatlining

I learn to live with the loss
Take a pound of flesh as an offering
I learn to live with the loss
I see god in violence
I see truth in suffering

Build your walls
Build your coffins
Rotten pine
Weathered and worn
Rotten hearts sink in the storm

At the edge of the earth
There is nothing but the fall

[2x]
We inherit the ghosts
Through the cracks in our bones
I am the vessel for the dying
Will they bring me home?

Flatlining [2x]

I learn to live with the loss
Take a pound of flesh as an offering
I learn to live with the loss
I see god in violence
I see truth in suffering

No blood left to drain
Turn my eyes to hell
And let them martyr me
No life without pain
Oh wretched sky
Let the light die in vain

[2x]
We inherit the ghosts
Through the cracks in our bones
I am the vessel for the dying
Will they bring me home?

I watched the world rip out its heart [2x]
And I know it meant nothing
I watched the world rip out its heart (nothing)
I watched the world rip out its heart
And I know it meant nothing
