So show us the sun wonât you save us, 
Just give us the sun
We lay here for years in the trenches,
Not saying enough 
We ambled so far for you leeches,
We suffered too much
We live in a criminal disco, 
So steady your legs 

Now, stand up, pull it together
Bury them, this ainât a test
Bury them, bury your thoughts
Bury them beneath the dirt
Yeahâ¦

We stuck by your rules, your principles, like lambs to the slaughter
He stands in front of you people, like a priest at the altar

Now, stand up, pull it together
Bury them, this ainât a test
Bury them, bury your thoughts
Bury them beneath the dirt
Yeahâ¦

Inside your torment, a creature he stands at the gate where the clock face is down
Keep your head, above the water

Look at his face, see all the scars he bears,
Keep your head, above the water

Unleash the hounds! 

The crows will burn!
