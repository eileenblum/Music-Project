Sitting ducks and people kill you
Wait your turn and they will take you
In the light where they canât see 
In this room where they canât breathe

What have we done, what have we done?
See how they run, head for the sun
Look at the tears, look at their eyes
Look at the tears stream down
Pierced with the tip of the end of a nail
Sweet execution
Kissed with a spell from the lips of a girlâ¦

Say what you see what you wanted to say, aahh
Look at the tears as they stream down my face
Think of the time that we wanted to waste
Look at this corner in space

On and on and onâ¦
On and on and onâ¦
On and on and onâ¦
On and on and onâ¦
On and on and onâ¦
On and on and onâ¦
On and on and onâ¦

Pierced with the tip of the end of a nail
This is our house!
This is our house!
This is our house!
This is our house!
