Somebody unchain this menace,
Release the current that pours inside
We keep the fear in this silence 
Transistor down

The breakdown of sound 
The separation
The frequency is killing me
Feels so motionless

With every move we feel the movements
With only clock hands confusing time
Now has the cycle here been broken
Transistor downâ¦ 
Burnâ¦ Burn.

The breakdown of sound 
The separation
The frequency is killing me
Feels so motionless

All, you little suckers, with your face down on the ground
Waist high up in dirt
All, you little suckers, with your face down on the mud
Waist high up 
Yeahâ¦

The frequency is killing me
Canât you see their eyes roll back?
Face down, flat lineâ¦
