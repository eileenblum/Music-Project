Wake up, wake up, wake up
Canât you see that the boys are out?
Feel the mood change
Get up, get up, get up
Thereâs no time for praying with the priest
Weâre creatures you donât see

So there is the entrance
And thereâs the exit, if you donât like it,
Fucking use it with no ill intentions
Bring out the demons, bring out the demons in yourself
As I wander around in these circles
To be a part of a puzzle, no
Freed heartsâ¦

So pull up your skirt, the girl at the back, Iâm the man at the front with the red eye
Sorry man, was that your girl, you should have said

Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦ 
Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦
Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦ 
Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦
Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦ Ohâ¦ 

So this is the exit
And youâll never, never tell us that weâll be down
This is the exit
And youâll never, never,
Noâ¦
