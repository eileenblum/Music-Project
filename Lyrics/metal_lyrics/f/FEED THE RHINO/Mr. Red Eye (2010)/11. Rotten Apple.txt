Yeah!
Weâre all committed to treason
Weâre all the victims of a dying fate
And to the sharks that feed us
But donât be scared, youâve got to stand up strong

You try to kill us with your words,
Your authorâs the weakness
We took a torture to your messenger
See how you wilted
You! come! come! come with the medic
Come! Yeah! Come! come with the medic

You all get up, we all get up
Seems like we fell for a fucking set up
You tried to see things through our eyes
But donât be scared
You gotta stand up strong

You try to kill us with your words,
Your authorâs the weakness
We took a torture to your messenger
See how you wilted

And to the sharks that feed us
Weâre all the victims of a dying fate
And to the sharks that feed us
But donât be scared, youâve got to stand up strong

So donât, waste time, with your feelings â Donât! Waste! Time!
Weâre tearing down the walls â we kick down the doors! â let us out!
