Release the dogs
They cannot touch you here
Itâs who we are,
So nail them to the floor with a smile on your face

Itâs just a game, remember the purpose, you donât be afraid
Make them crawl, make them talk

Hang from the rafters
They are the cancer
Theyâll leave you stranded youâll see

Itâs just a game, remember the purpose, 
You donât be afraid to move all the pieces

Open the door, here comes the judge
Now youâll take that look off your face, you
He will judge you as you stand and shake, yeah!

Roll the dice!
Roll the dice!
Crawl, dog you crawl!
Crawl, dog you crawl!
