Time, lost, weighing up the laws
when your loosing, all of your senses
time, lost, standing in the courtyard
waiting for the axe of execution

Stuck in the cage with these lions
so do you think you've caught us yet
we tear the hearts from inside you
well it's my pleasure, be scared!

You, there, standing in the chairs with your red eyes so purposely gleamingâ¦.

Regain control.
Regain your senses.
Regain all motion.
You, will, learnâ¦.

This is the caller of the town
here comes the caller of the town

Back, to life, moving in your stride
clear the wayâ¦.
hide in the walls from these sirens
well i can smell you by your clothes

Regain control.
Regain your senses.
Regain all motion.
You will learnâ¦.

This is the caller of the town
here comes the caller of the town
Put out the fight, put out the fire
i am the caller of this town

Stop right there, say your prayers
now your scared, now your scared

We're never gonna stop, till the dust settles on
we're never gonna stop, till the dust settles on

They've all gone away, they will go away, they've all gone away, they will go
away.
