Stop!
When the pressure falls on you
Stand to attention, come 
With everything you think that youâve got, not a lot, not a lot
And when the devil plays his card
And you get that sinking feeling as you come up

I, I felt it crawl its way inside of me,
Twisting and turning, Iâ¦
I felt it burrow its way inside of me,
Like a plague, with a purpose
And when the devil plays his card
And you get that sinking feeling as you come up

You stand straightâ¦
As the floor, it trembles
Oh as the floor, it trembles

I run away, and I push my feet to the sun, I find out what Iâve done
I wanna wait, I wanna wait, I wanna wait, 
push my feet to the sun, I find out what Iâve done
I wanna wait, I wanna wait, I wanna wait, 
Stand up, and all you sleepers stand up, and all you sleepers stand up, 
Stand up, stand upâ¦
