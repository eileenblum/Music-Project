Wake all you ants,
Wake to the sound of the ground breaking up
Fear what makes you, itâs your fix,
Break the worker line, wake!

Boat man, hereâs your coin,
To the Holy Land, where I want to lay
Boat man, whatâs that light up ahead there,
Wonât you take me back home

Further from the entrance of the dead
Not another lost soul
This is where I take another step down
You crawled out,
From the ashes,
Just take my hand and pull me back

You must have seen me,
Blood on my hands, burnt the bridge,
Now Iâm here to stay
Rolled your eyes, made me hide
Now Iâm here,

Wake! Come in the light,
Wake! Come in the light

We never thought we could leave here
We never thought we could steer clear

Drawn home, further from the entrance of the dead
Drawn home, further from the entrance of the dead
