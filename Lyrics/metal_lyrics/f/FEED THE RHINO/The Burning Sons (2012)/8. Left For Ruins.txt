Iâve watched the world change,
Iâve seen it change
Iâve watched the world change,
Iâve seen it change

Look for the signs it gives you,
Look for them loud and clear
It takes no time to get you,
But lions have no fear

Iâve watched the world change,
Iâve seen it change
Bleed colours drained in time,
Left with an outline

Donât you try,
Donât you try, donât you try!
Donât try to change me,
You wonât break me
We had our chances, had our choices

Iâve watched the world change,
Iâve seen it change
Bleed colours drained in time,
Left with an outline
Iâve watched the world change,
Iâve seen it change
Bleed colours drained in time,
Left with an outline

I woke with a fragile mind, full of decay
Led straight down the path of the blind, wasting away
You said it would work,
You said it would work!

Iâve watched the world change,
Iâve seen it change
Iâve watched the world change

Donât try to change me, you wonât break me,
Donât try to change me, you wonât break me!
