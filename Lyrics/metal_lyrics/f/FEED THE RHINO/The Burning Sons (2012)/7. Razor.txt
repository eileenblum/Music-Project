Stuck in my thoughts again,
Wound up so tight again
Whereâd it go so wrong again?
Whereâd it go so wrong?

Days seem much longer now,
Razors feel sharper now,
Hour glass is running,
Running down

Razor, razor,
Hour glass is running, running down

Whereâd it go so wrong?
Whereâd it go so wrong?
Whereâd it go so wrong, wrong,
Oh wrong?

Razor, razor,
Hour glass is running, running down

Razor, razor,
Hour glass is running, running down
