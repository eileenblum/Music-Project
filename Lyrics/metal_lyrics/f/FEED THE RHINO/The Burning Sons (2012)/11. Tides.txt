In the mirror stands the boy that makes no sound,
Heard a thousand words as teardrops hit the ground,
Let him go (Heâs not your saviour)
Let him go (Heâs not your saviour)

See your father lay the bodies to the ground,
See your mother's eyes screaming with the sounds,
Let her go (Theyâre not your saviours)
Let them go (Theyâre not your saviours)

You!

Theyâre not your saviours,
Theyâre not your saviours,
Theyâre not your saviours,
Theyâre not your saviours!

Ride the waves, home!
Ride the waves, home!
