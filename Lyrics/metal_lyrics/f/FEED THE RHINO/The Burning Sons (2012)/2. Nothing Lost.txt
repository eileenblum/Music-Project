Bring all you got, nothing lost, just rotten memories
Bring all you got, nothing lost, just rotten memories

Youâre the last, Iâm the first, hereâs the part you will learn, broke the silence for the first time
Cross your fingers hope for more the little things you ignored, broke the silence for the first time

Bring all you got, nothing lost, just rotten memories

How do you pass it to the rest, how the hell?
All the lies they were perfect, youâre only puppets
Nowâs your time you will learn, you will question all your words,
With the fires that you started

You can hang all your crosses, lies!
âCause you know whatâs deep in you, cries!

Now youâre lost, now youâre lost, now youâre lost!

You unleash the fire, that burns, you keep, you hide so well
Unleash the fire, itâs torn, it takes, takes you down, takes you down!

Bring! Bring all you got, nothing lost, just rotten memories
