The pain from the past,
That I wear as a mask,
With every day I live and breathe
Iâm here, youâre there, lost count of the distance,
On a winding road to nowhere

Pour yourself a glass,
Sit and count the scars,
Relive, recall the memories
Iâm here, youâre there, lost count of the distance,
On a winding road to nowhere

I read the words on the paper,
Tried to fill in the blanks,
Found the song of failure,
Just myself to thank

We fought we lost,
Then tore ourselves apart
We fought we lost,
Lay the pieces together
We fought we lost,
Then tore ourselves apart
We fought we lost

Failure! Failure!
Failure! Failure!

Battles fought and lost
Iâm here, youâre there, lost count of the distance,
On a winding road to nowhere
The song of failure,
The song of failure
