I donât know, I donât know,
Why I pick up the broken glass,
The hurt wonât stop âtil youâre gone

This is the final straw, the end!
The things you cannot fix, the end!
You are the thorn that canât be pulled

Pointless, the wasted minutes of a lifetime
Selfish, I pick these scars because theyâre all mine
Lost hope, lost hope!

I ripped into my heart, the pain!
Iâve torn myself apart, for me!
What is the curse? What is the cure?
âCause itâs always fucking there
Itâs always fucking there
Over and over again,
Over and over again

I feel the voice of a thousand screams,
I am the curse, I am the cure,
This is the house that will hold the answer,
I am the house, we are the cure,
This is the thought that will take me further

You resist, you resist, you resist
I feel the voice of a thousand screams,

I donât know I donât know,
Why I picked up the broken glass,
The pain, itâs gone
