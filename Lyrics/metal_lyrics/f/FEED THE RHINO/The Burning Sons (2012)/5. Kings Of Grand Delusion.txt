Theyâre the pacifist men,
These are the needles of cowards,
Truth is settled in stone many hearts to break
Many paths to walk,
Like to stick to the sun even when it shines black,
Even when it shines black

Walk alone
Walk alone
Told you once, told you twice,
Only here for the ride,
We are the kings of grand delusion
Only so much to take before itâs gone,
We are the kings of grand delusion

Hereâs a righteous plan,
Spoken in tongues of the victims,
As they fell to their knees,
You heard the screams

Come for the ride,
Grand delusion, grand delusion
Come for the ride,
Grand delusion, grand delusion
Come for the ride,
Grand delusion, grand delusion
Come for the ride, You!

And still, the sun shines black,
And still, the sun shines black

At first we were left for dead
That place where we lost our breath
In time this became our home
Shovelled dust âtil we sat on thrones, built from dirt!
The sons, built, from dirt!
