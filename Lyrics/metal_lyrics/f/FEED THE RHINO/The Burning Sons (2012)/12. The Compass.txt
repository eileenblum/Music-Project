Break the chain of command,
Hate the voice in your heart,
Are these the choices holding you back?

Walls will crush you,
The voices that put you straight in the ground,
These are the demons that show you your worth
What you are worth!

Stop watching, watching the stars,
Truth of the nightmare that hides here in the dark,
Further away, harder to see

This compass will guide you, will lead you
Straight, straight through your thoughts
The cure to your illness,
Waits in the dirt with what youâre worth,
With what youâre worth

Stand, behind the eyes of the true hate, judging!
See, the hatred that runs through your face,
Wear you thin!

You give me some answers!
You give me, what Iâm owed, what Iâm worth,
Now!

Break, the chain of command,
Hate the voice in your heart,
Hereâs what it gives you, itâs all youâre worth
Itâs all youâre worth
Itâs all youâre worth!
