Weâre all dead!
We all live in the same way,
Weâre all dead, weâre all dead
This is fear in its own state,
This is death, weâre all dead
You want a piece of this,
A simple piece youâll see
Weâre all dead
Try and take this place,
You will suffocate, youâre misled

I made peace with the enemy,
A friend of mine, this is my vice
Iâll eat dirt from the cracks in the street,
This is my heart now Iâm at peace.

No!
Hereâs where we bury the dead, what a masterpiece
We wonât stop, wonât stop, no we wonât stop!
We wonât stop, wonât stop, no we wonât stop!
We wonât stop, wonât stop, no we wonât stop!
We wonât stop, wonât stop, no we wonât stop!
Yeah!
We wonât stop, wonât stop, no we wonât stop!
We wonât stop, wonât stop, no we wonât stop!

I felt it burn from the inside out,
I made my way to the surface
And I fell back in,
Lost heart, lost hope
And now my skin wears thin,
Now Iâm back, back at the start
