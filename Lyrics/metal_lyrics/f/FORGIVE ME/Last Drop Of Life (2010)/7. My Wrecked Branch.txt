The roots are spreading
through rusty flesh
the worms are shaking
through eaten brains
lacerated faces..and dry blood
jaded remains...asking forgiveness

coldness handled the holes of scattered truth
October faced its mirrors with this youth
these tombs will witness reflections through the nights
my sparks of leaving are facing the entire right

Trapped among my ashes...Trapped...Trapped...

The eyes are moving
through wrecked skulls
600 wounds are spread among the dusk
these torn mouths are screaming near
"goodbye to memories, goodbye tomorrow"

I'll drop my branch
I'll release the weight
I'll meet you there,
with no shame

Coldness handled the holes of scattered truth
October faced its mirrors with this youth
these tombs will witness reflections through the nights
my sparks of leaving are facing the entire right..
