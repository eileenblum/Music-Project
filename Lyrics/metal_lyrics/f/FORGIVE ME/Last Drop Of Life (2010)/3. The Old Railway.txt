Old place...so forgotten
you were here...beyond the light
hanged trust..ripped promises
innocence died within the night

you were here ..
with a thorn and roses
Failure won...
and then you left

And this w as written, my destiny
and you have flown toward the skies

cold face...so distorted
I was here..searching the right
I found you bleeding with broken wings...
with a slit wrist...and skin so white..
