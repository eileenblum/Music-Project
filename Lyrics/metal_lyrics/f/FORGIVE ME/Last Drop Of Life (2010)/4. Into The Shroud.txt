I am bleeding, I am cutting myself
I am tainting the walls

I am screaming while no one hears
I am flowing what rest of me
I am dreaming of the final leave
I am seeking the peace in me
I am bidding farewell to pains
I am ending the final race
For no more darkness
lights shall appear
For no more lies
I cast the fears...

[Whispers:]
This existence's so cold and frail,
we fell into a delusion that called life"
its something which full of pains,
and its something which full of lies..
where wounds become our food and death hides in disguise"

[Whispers:]
Meaningless breaths where there're no goals to achieve,
where there're no joys at all but blood to feel,
where there's no love at all just hate to breed,
where there's no gladness at all just madness to seed,
where there's no gladness at all just madness to seed
where there's no gladness at all just madness to seed"

Bleeding...Cutting ...myself
I've Tainted the walls
Forgive me...
I am leaving...
