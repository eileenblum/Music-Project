Denim, Leather, Thrash is what we are!
Bang your head against the stage
At Baloffs command
Thrashing, smashing...Posers on the floor!!
We'll leave you on the floor,bruised and sore
Thrash Is Back!
Thrash Is Back!
Thrash Is Back!
Violence, mayhem, the crowd begins to slam!
Circle pitting maniacs, thrashing all around!
Louder, Louder the crowd starts to scream!!
Saying thrash is back with their fist in the air
Thrash Is Back!
Thrash Is Back!
Thrash Is Back!
Run on the stage, jump in the crowd
They catch you as you fall from the air
The lights hit your face as you surf the crowd
You see the band on the stage,
Kicked in the head
By a white high top
The mark is left on your face
Turned and tossed by the people below
Until you fall in the hole
The crowd pulls you in to the circle pit
Slamming and banging your head
A thrasher falls, you help him up,
Slamming the posers to death!
Singing along while your knees hit your face,
Not giving a damn who's in your way
Your hearts beating fast as your pitting away
Thrash Will Never ....Die!!!
80's is when thrash was made,
Those were the glory days
Thrash was asleep, but now it's awake
We'll never die, we're here to stay
The glory days are back!
Thrashers Unite!! Scream with Me!!
Thrash Is Back!
Thrash Is Back!
