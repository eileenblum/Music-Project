Walking Around with a twitch in your eye
Wishing it was the 80's when we ruled in
Our time, but open your eyes and look
Around, Thrash is coming back, and we'll
put up a fight
Spread the Fire!
Spread the Fire!
Spread the Fire!
Spread the Fire!
C'mon
Burnouts say that Thrash is gonna let em
So what ever they want, they won't know
Till they find out, don't you forget
That Thrash is coming back
Spread the Fire!
Spread the Fire!
Spread the Fire!
Spread the Fire!
C'mon
