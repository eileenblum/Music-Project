Evil rising from the ground
Tumbling walls a piercing sound
They're looking for your trembling soul
His evil eyes burn through your soul
Not a man but yes a foe
Its judgment day taking it's toll
Judgment day from the underground
Burning hell hounds coming for your town
Fight, for your right, to live
So fight!!
Fighting death, till your end
Striking Death!
Dark lit fire the gates of hell!
Six times you hear the judgement bell
Out walks now the commanding beast
He wants your life for his bloody beast
You can't run there's nowhere to hide
You have nothing left to stand up and fight
Bow down on to your knees
He crushes your face,
His victory
Fight, for your right, to live
So fight!!
Fighting death, till your end
Striking Death!
You watched your children burn alive
It's your fault your children died
The walls of death you can not cross
Now its Striking Death!
Striking Death!
Striking Death!
Striking Death!
