Good -vs- Evil, Evil -vs- Good
Choose your Side now
'Cause that's all you could
People say it's right
But other's say it's wrong,
The decisions up to you.
Forced to kill, is your command
Destruction on another,
Is what he Want's,
Forced by the beast to believe
That it's right, It's the final command
Evil Mind of the Dreadful
Destruction, Annihilation of the Vengeful
Command of the Beast
War Starts now, the worlds in his hands
Power of the beast, people starts to run
Escape now prisoners of war
The holocaust is here
Nuclear blast, people turn to ash,
Face Melting down, Painful death,
The final Hours here
Take your last breath, showing no mercy
Evil Mind of the Dreadful
Destruction, Annihilation of the Vengeful
Command of the Beast
The Holocaust is here, with power he attacked
He brought back hell on earth, civilians left to die
People dying Children cryond, Nations gone
Shootion guns, helpless people fall
Command of the beast
Now under power, Nations growing faster
Crushing our creation, Total Annihilation
Theres no solution, too much pollution
Victims cry in pain.
Terrors now raised, taking your life,
Under attack there's no turning back
The never ending swarm, a million more destroyed.
Evil Mind of the Dreadful
Destruction, Annihilation of the Vengeful
Command of the Beast
