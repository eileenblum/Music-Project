She's from whom is behind her
Screaming with terror in mind
The nightmare attacks
There's nowhere to run
Theres something screeching out side
She doesn't want to sleep alone
Now she's trapped in her dream
With blood on his gloves,and knives on his hands
He haunts her from the fire below!
Dreams of Terror
Dreams of Terror
Meet the Glove!!
Dreams of Terror
Dreams of Terror
Meet the Glove!!

Haunted Dreams,It's a nightmare attack
Freddy has come here for you!
He tries to attack, in your helpless escape
He knows where your running too
Plays with your mind, his knives tear his flesh
Showing your merciless fate
He laughs while you die, under his blade
Your drained of your blood and your life
Dreams of Terror
Dreams of Terror
Meet the Glove!!
Dreams of Terror
Dreams of Terror
Meet the Glove!!
The Black Evil Night
You Can't see his face
The fire from below
Reveals all his blades
This sleepless night
It seems all a game
But when you feel the pain
It'll drive you insane!!!
Dreams of Terror
Dreams of Terror
Death in Your Sleep
Dreams of Terror
Dreams of Terror
Death in Your Sleep
Meet the Glove!!
