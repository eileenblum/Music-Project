Disgusting, repulsive is the way of life
Slowly crawling towards, they see the light
Feeding and feeding how it feels so warm
Waiting and waiting till the child is born
Walls ooze with vile and slime
Mucus stuck on filthy grime
Tearing away until it's hollow

Unborn child
Languish in vile
The infestation
Rotten creation

Repulsive stench as time goes by
The rotten feast goes on inside
Body host, nurturing the young
Some of the guest the feeding is done
The time has come birth gives life
Child is born with silent cries
Thousands and thousands of insects crawling
Child's mouth opens and maggots falling

Unborn child
Languish in vile
The infestation
Rotten creation
