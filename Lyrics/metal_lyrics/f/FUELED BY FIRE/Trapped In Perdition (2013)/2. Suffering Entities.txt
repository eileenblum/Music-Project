Roam Through The Ruins
Through The Parrels Of Time
Searching For a Meaning
In a Meaningless Existence
Coping With the Emptiness
So Alone it Feels Inside
Deprived of Something More
What Is Seeked Cannot Be Found

Misery Turns Into Agony
For Agony Consumes The Entity

Unknown In Complete Despair
No Voice To Give To Silence
Sequence of Memories
Only Fathom The Desperate Mind
There Is Nothing There To Follow
No Beginning Or An End
What Can End the Torture
Why Can't Existence Fade Away

Agony Distress Anguish Forever
Defenseless to these Horrendous
Surroundings
Tormented
By The Heinous
Misfortune 
Of This Presence

Suffering Through This Terrifying
Existence
The Presence
Abnormal Being

Suffering Entities
