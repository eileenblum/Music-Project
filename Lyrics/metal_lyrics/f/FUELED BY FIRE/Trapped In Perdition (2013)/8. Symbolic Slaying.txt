Dismembering countless bodies
Directly a motive of greed
Bloodshed of innocent victims
All who stand in the way
Struggling to contain the deaths
Savages reign supreme
Replacing political powers
Killing one after another

The order is clear
Take silver or lead
Stand in the way
They will have your head

Worshiping death
Message is left
Slaughter proclaiming
Symbolic slaying

Murders growing in numbers
Bullets rain from the sky
Mass graves cover the lands
Stench of rot in the air
Some dead drenched in acid
Making stew out of men
Warnings send chill down the spine
Tortures proclaiming the massive terrain

Chopping the bodies
To flesh and bone
Depicting the killings
And millions are shown

With the beheadings
And butchering limbs
Murders collecting
New order begins

The order is clear
Take silver or lead
Stand in the way
And they will have your head

Piles of bodies
Collecting the debts
Profits and blood
Thousands of deaths

Deadly war the profits gained
Struggle that will see no end
Lives are lost money is gained
Power held by putrid men
Lawless cities in shambles
Order is held by greed
Dead land ruled by power
Murders to give the savage its way
