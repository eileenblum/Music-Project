Live for the day
For everyday may be is your last
Lawless to all, you choose
You must chose your own path

Taking for granted the breath in your lungs
Life with no fear
Greeting death, greeting death when it comes
Complete disregard
Every day in your life
Careless decisions
And never, and never think twice

The day will come
When your last breath
Is done

One life to live
Imprudent mentality
Rightfully free
Defaced mortality

Defaced
Mortality

Fulfilling desire
Never regret
This might be your last
Memories fade
Take what you get
The end is what's left

This world is yours
Do what you will
Anything goes
Live to fulfill
Any desire
This life is your own
Born to a world
Claiming a throne

This world is yours
Do what you will
Anything goes
Live to fulfill
The one to defy
Mark your own words
The day it will come
When your last breath is done

One life to live
Imprudent mentality
Rightfully free
Defaced mortality
