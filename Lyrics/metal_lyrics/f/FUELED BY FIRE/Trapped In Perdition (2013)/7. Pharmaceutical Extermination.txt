Reality slips away illusions of the mind
Evaluate what is real don't know where to turn
Seeking help for mental health looking for a cure
Welcome to corrupted system controlling populations of the world

Delusions pour as the mind withers away

Dose increase inject or swallow believing all the lies
Strategic plan attack the mind modern genocide
Prescriptions fall never cure expectancy to die
Deadly cocktail to the vane syringes as an instrument of death

Plan to exterminate
All say to medicate
Controlling populations
Prescriptions
To kill

Take what's prescribed
Deadly medication
Follow the directions
The government decided
Trip to the pharmacy
Bottles full of poison
Tell you it's a cure
Pharmaceutical extermination
