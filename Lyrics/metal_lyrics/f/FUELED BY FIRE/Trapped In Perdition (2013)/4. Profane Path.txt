Bastard child
Walks with disease
Dead are his eyes
Despise all he sees
Ruthless being
Fearless to all
Endless destroyer
Makes empires fall

Satan fulfills the prophecy
Gods will scream in agony
Laugh in the wake of tragedy
Holding the fate of humanity

Blasphemous cries
A god is now dead
Walk through the fire
Kills all who he led
He shall deceive
Eternally hate
Showing true Hell
The lives he will take

Ruling with his wrath
Through the passages of Hell
Visions of the underworld
He walks the profane path

Abandon lives eternally
Angel of bottomless pit
Leviathan lord of the unknown
Will deceive you by any means
Man of sin is reveled
The son of perdition upon us

Adversary the Devil
Seeking whom he may devour
This king of tyre
Apollyon the destroyer
Ruler of darkness
Ruler of demons
Ruler of this world

Fucking disgrace
to those who praise a faithful god
Atrocious desire
Feeding on the agony of all mankind

Vulgar displays
Possessing the power to enslave the world
Deceitful ways
He bares no truth the father of lies

Satan fulfills the prophecy
Gods will scream in agony
Laugh in the wake of tragedy
Holding the fate of humanity

Bastard child
Walks with disease
Dead are his eyes
Despise all he sees
Ruthless being
Fearless to all
Endless destroyer
Makes empires fall
