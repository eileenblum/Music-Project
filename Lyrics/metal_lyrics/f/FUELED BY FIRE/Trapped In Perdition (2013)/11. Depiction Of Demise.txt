[Bonus Track]Taking the still frames from the mind
Visions warped with intentions all so clear
Morbid thoughts and malice design
Into fruition the structure now comes to life

Destined to fulfill the thoughts massacres everywhere
Haunted by the deadly desire texture of blood in hand
Images of complete destruction
Possessed to annihilate
Carnage awaits the world
Bloodshed completes desire
Horror will please the mind
Kill for deadly ambition

Exposing the portrait to man kind
Unleashing the chaos locked inside
Capturing detail a tactical task
Harvest the carnage of a sickened mind

Replicate the visions of the insane
Perfection through the lives he'll take

Pictures within the mind
Will grace the sights of men
An architect of death
Slowly watch them die

Taking victims lives
The vision never dies

Duplicate the thoughts of the deranged
Inception of the art he makes
Depiction of the mind
Will grace the sights of men

Destined to fulfill the thoughts
Massacres everywhere
Haunted by the deadly desire texture of blood in hand
Images of complete destruction
Possessed to annihilate
