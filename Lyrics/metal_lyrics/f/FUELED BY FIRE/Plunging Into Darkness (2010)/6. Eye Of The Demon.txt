Sounds from the darkness are calling
the walls that surround you draw near
the whole world beneath you is falling
stricken by the torture of fear

Stare into the eye of the demon
it stares back into your soul
fuck everything you believe in
follow them through the gates of hell

This madness seems so unreal
are you going insane
no one knows how this feels
they don't understand your pain
the good that's inside you is forgotten
possession grows ever so stronger
everything fades and turns rotten
your mind and your body is yours no longer

Stare into the eye of the demon
it stares back into your soul
fuck everything you believe in
follow them through the gates of hell
