calljng upon my evil spell
mesmerized by witches of hell
surrounded by the wicked curse
taken over by demonic force

terrorized
by the sacred curse
try to escape
but I'll never let go!

over powering your worthless mind
blackened spirits wither away in time
never break the oath
feel the sorrow of my mystic ways
from the dark i obtain your soul
surrender down to the monarch of hell
praying on your knees
your plead for help will get you nowhere now

terrorized
by the sacred curse
try to escape
but I'll never let go!

evoking the curse with power and force
this spiritual demon shows no remorse
this blasphemous witch casting a spell
diving my mind strait to hell
unleashing the power
burning your soul
trapped in a daze your under control
eternally black you'll never live free
mysterious evil is now what you see

evoke!!! the!!! curse!!!
