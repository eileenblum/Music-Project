Left this world a terrible death
Severed apart in a bloody mess
Dissected body once was whole
Lacerations took their toll.
Rotting in pieces, deceased
Smells of vile ensued
Flies hover eating away
Laying separate miles away
A gory mess your demise
Finding a piece by surprise
Discover what's left on your bones
Cause of this massacre is unknown

Some parts just decompose
others just start to erode
All of the pieces lay bare
Brain matter found everywhere
Chopped up in several segments
Dumped on multiple pavements
Maggots enjoying a treat
Feasting away on human meat

Rotting in pieces deceased
Smells of vile ensued
Flies hover eating away
Laying separate miles away
A gory mess your demise
Finding a piece by surprise
Discover what's left on your bones
Cause of this massacre is unknown
