[Japanese Bonus Track]

[Swedish Traditional]

Maria gï¿½r pï¿½ vï¿½gen, som leder ner till byn.
Hon sjunger och hon skrattar, ï¿½t lï¿½rkorna i skyn.
Hon e pï¿½ vï¿½g till torget fï¿½r att sï¿½lja lite brï¿½d.
Och solen stiger varm och stor, och fï¿½rgar himlen rï¿½d.

Dï¿½ mï¿½ter hon en herre, pï¿½ en hï¿½st med yvig man.
Han sï¿½ger "Jag e kungens man, som tar vad jag vill ha.
Och du e allt fï¿½r vacker, fï¿½r att inte ha nï¿½n man.
Fï¿½lj med mig in i skogen ska jag visa vad jag kan".

Hon tvingas ner i grï¿½set, och han tar pï¿½ hennes kropp.
Hon slingrar sig och ber honom, fï¿½r guds skull hï¿½lla upp.
Men riddarn bara skrattar, berusad av sin glï¿½d.
Sï¿½ hon tar hans kniv och stï¿½ter till, Och riddaren e dï¿½d!

Dom fï¿½ngslade Maria. Hon stenades fï¿½r drï¿½p.
Men minnet efter riddaren, blev firat varje ï¿½r.
Jag herrarna blir hjï¿½ltar, men folket det blir dï¿½mt.
Och vi som ser hur allt gï¿½tt till, fï¿½r veta att vi drï¿½mt!

[English Translation by Mathias Blad]

Maria walks down the road to the village,
She sings and laughs at the larks in the sky.
She's on her way to the marketplace to sell some bread,
And the sun is rising, warm and big, and colours the sky red.

Then she meets a nobleman on a horse with a bushy mane.
He say's: I'm the king's man so I take what I want
And you are far too beautiful not to have a man,
Come with me into the woods and I'll show you what I can!

She's forced down in the grass and he touches her body.
She tries to get away and asks him for the love of god to stop
But the knight just laughs, intoxicated by his own glow.
So she grabs his knife and gives it a push and the knight is dead.

They put Maria in prison, and she was stoned to death for manslaughter
But the memory of the knight was celebrated each year.
Yes, the noblemen become heroes but ordinary people is being condemned
And we who see how it all really is learns that we've been dreaming!
