There are too many stones
and life is just made of glass.
Mark the words of the fool
he will tell you the truth, oh so cruel.

You say and I will believe
although I stumble and fall.
Deceived by my own eyes.
Trust is a gamble with pain, roll the dice!

Give my your confidence
and I'll lock the door.
Offer me the same
and I'll be busted to the floor.

Take a walk upon the ice
or ride the light of day.
Dance with flames of fire,
you will burn with the words, of the liar.
