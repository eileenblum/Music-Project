From the open range they hailed
Living free as the wind,
Children of the vast plains
The hunter became the prey
As their land slipped away
Into the bleeding horizon

Empty promises of snake tongues
Poisonous, venomous lies!

Dawning of the sombre age

In black the days were hung
When ancient ways denied
Struggling in chain and in shackles
Refused the native tongue
Losing identity
Once of pride and of power
