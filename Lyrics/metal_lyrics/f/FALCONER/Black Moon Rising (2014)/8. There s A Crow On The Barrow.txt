Thereâs a crow on the barrow
Saddest of figures in grey
Guardian of the royal grave
Ancient legends say
Thereâs a moan from upon the hill
Clad in a silvery light
Dweller of a forgotten tomb,
Dormant heathen might

Croaking at the autumn sky
An accolade in the wind
Carried to the ones up high

Thereâs a crow on the barrow
Silently spying into the dark
Thereâs a crow on the barrow
Secretly scowling into the black autumn night

Thereâs a present calmness so dense,
A bower of eternal peace
Vague shadows in reverence
Like breezes through the trees
Echoes of the ceremony
Flashes of silver and gold
Offerings of beast and slaves
While odes and legends told
