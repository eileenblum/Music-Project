I am the prince of hypocrisy
An apostle of the lies
Do as I say not as I do,
Iâm only playing dice
Hear the words of the prophecy
In my gospel of swarming flies

I am dancing in the waltz
Come join in, one and all
We will all compete at the jesterâs ball
For a seat at curtain call

In front of the virtuous mirror
Blinded men leads the way
Onto the altar at the judgement day
Living in self delusion,
Disciples of the deceit
Self nominated, the paragon elite

Play me a tune of ideology
A noble marching song
Though I am slightly out of key
Iâll try to sing along
The chorus speak of our doomsday
And all the things it deem wrong
