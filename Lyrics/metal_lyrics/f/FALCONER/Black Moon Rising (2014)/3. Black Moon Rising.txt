Seek the golden key
That open blessed doors
Seek it high and seek it low,
Cherish it forever more
Heavenâs out of reach
For fondling hands of yours
Turn around and burn your eyes,
Donât look back as shadows dies

Sworn to shed no more tears
Another El Dorado yet appears

On burning wings you fly
Into dead horizon
The sun sets forever more
Do you see the black moon rising?

Dance to the rhythm of fire
The flames will make you blind
Ascend the rainbow way up high
To the crest where dreamers die
Through the desert of discontent
In his hour of need,
Walks the fool on a wicked trail
Lost in dunes chasing his own trail
