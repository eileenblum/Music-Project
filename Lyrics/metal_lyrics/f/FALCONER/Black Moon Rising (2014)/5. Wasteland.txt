For the hot for the cold
For the brave and bold
Weâre emerging out of the condemnation.
In the fire, in the ice
In the faith of sunrise
Breaking chains in the name of our liberation

Naked in the storm
And touched by the flames
Now weâre breaking free
Out of this wasteland
Cast to purgatory,
Thrown out to the beast
Strived from dusk to dawn
Out of this wasteland

Through the storm, through the breeze
Through the nightâs disease
Every mortal fear and anguish set aside
Take the left, take the right
Take the path to daylight
Walking past the void with a new found pride
