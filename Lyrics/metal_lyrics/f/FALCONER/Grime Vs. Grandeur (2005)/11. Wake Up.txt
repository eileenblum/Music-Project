The ring upon your finger doesn't mean a thing?
Now when you are drunk you can be the king"

"You went out of line now pay the price my friend.
Rouse up in this charade, for how long can you pretend."

The Sandman returns you to reality.
Lose your sin in slumber, then you will...

Wake up with the demons.
You can neither run nor hide.
Can't get rid of the demons.
Ripping your soul apart,
Breaking you down from inside.

"Out there in the nightlife you shine my Neon Knight.
All the lucky ladies they wait for you to excite."

"Is this the woman? Was that all you could do?
I don't believe this. Shame on you!
