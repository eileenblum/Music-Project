Millions of fears are howling loud.
The tarn of tears is running out,
You reside to far away.
East and west and down below.
It's easier to let it go,
Not always bothered by the truth.

Darkened sky on middle day.
Destruction there, so they can't stay.
"Sorry boys", but you're alone.
The troops of doom has left the ground.
Take the shit, fire another round.
Eat the dirt, the crap is yours.

Over foggy waters, I reach the shore.
I can't sympathize, can't sense anymore.

I'll shed no tears for strangers.
Save my crying until another day.
Maybe sorrows are coming my way.

The mill is grinding trough the gloom.
Ghastly eyes gaze at the moon.
In palest glow the dreams descend.
So in the end I'm not so bad.
Don't have the time, I don't feel sad
That's the way so let me be.

The distance between you and me:
The scale of my emotionality.
My heart ain't weak enough
To bleed for all the tragedy.
If I was to feel for one and all
I would probably crumble and fall.
My heart ain't rich enough
To suffer your reality.
