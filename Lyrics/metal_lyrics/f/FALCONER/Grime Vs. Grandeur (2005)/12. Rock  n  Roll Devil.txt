[Japan bonus track]

Just this one time and then nothing more.
It's all so harmless, nothing like before.
If it wants my interest I even out the score.
Just this time baby.

It's the Rock 'n' Roll devil
he's calling out my name.
It's the Rock 'n' Roll devil,
in his body there is no shame.

The little Rock 'n' Roll devil,
can you hear him calling for you.
It's the Rock 'n' Roll devil,
he makes me feel so blue.

Needing the fix I can't get out.
If I don't get it my full body starts to shout.
I'm a sucker for this game.
This shit has become something I can't live without.
