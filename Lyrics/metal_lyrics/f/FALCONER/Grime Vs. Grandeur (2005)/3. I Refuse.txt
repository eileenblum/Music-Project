I can not stand your lovin'
I got to go,
Go and find myself some peace.
Go bitch on someone else
I'll take no more,
No more frustration to the core.

I refuse to stand by you
And see my future life through tortured eyes.
I can not do what you want me to,
I will not try to hide myself inside.

No more interrogation.
Accusations will end,
I'll put an end to my disgrace.
Take your opinion elsewhere
And leave me be,
Leave me to let me lead me free.

No more lost sleep.
No more lost love,
I'm free.
No more blames and
No more chains 'cause
I'm free.
