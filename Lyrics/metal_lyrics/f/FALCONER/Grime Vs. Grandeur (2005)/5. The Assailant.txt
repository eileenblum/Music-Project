Lonely hunter spying through the night.
Beast of pleasure, a gambler in pain.
Time after time always on the hunt
It will lead you round your grave.
You'll go down with a grunt.

You feel like a tiger, rush is in your veins.
You have to try to break these chains,
Annihilation will grab onto your bone.
The assailant is you on your own.

Like a tiger closing in for a bite.
Do not see the danger that lies deep within.
Waiting, Watching, ready for the play.
So beware, don't you stray.

You feel like a tiger, rush is in your veins.
You have to try to break these chains,
Annihilation will grab onto your bone.
The assailant is you on your own.
