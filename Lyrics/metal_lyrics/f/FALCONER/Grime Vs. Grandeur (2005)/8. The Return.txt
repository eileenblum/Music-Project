Don't let your mind pollute you,
You're screwing your brain.
The end is no beginning, you must break the chain.

The voices wail (don't do this, don't do that.)
You must not fail.
Maybe it's near (in the dark they remind.)
Dream dreams in fear,
Please wake up.

Not on your own,
You still have time to see what you can discover.
We all long for your return.

Don't let the drugs abuse you,
You must take control.
The circle keeps on spinning, endless like a roll.
