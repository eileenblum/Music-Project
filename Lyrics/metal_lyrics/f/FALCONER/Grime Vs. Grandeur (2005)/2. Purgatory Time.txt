Cry cry, cry your eyes out.
You'll get no pity out of me.
Try try, to lie your way out.
It will not fool me you'll see.

You alone have picked the game,
There is no one else to blame.

Reality closes in
On your life filled of sin,
It's purgatory time.
It's your time to live the sum
Of the acts you have done,
It's purgatory time.

No no, chance for pardon.
Don't try to plead unsound mind.
Go go, and try to bargain.
Your conscience's left far behind.

You alone have picked the game,
There is no one else to blame.

Reality closes in
On your life filled of sin,
It's purgatory time.
It's your time to live the sum
Of the acts you have done,
It's purgatory time.

You alone have picked the game,
There is no one else to blame.

Reality closes in
On your life filled of sin,
It's purgatory time.
It's your time to live the sum
Of the acts you have done,
It's purgatory time.
