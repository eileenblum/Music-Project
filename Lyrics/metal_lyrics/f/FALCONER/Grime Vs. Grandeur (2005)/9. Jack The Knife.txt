I'm a grim and lonesome wanderer.
I walk you through the night.
Lurking in the shadows, waiting for a bite.
You don't know who I am,
But I'm nasty and obscene.
I'll take you life cut your throat,
Fulfilling all my dreams.

You're never safe when you're alone
And you won't feel a thing
When I loot your body.
Digging in the grime.

I fool you first with candy,
I trick you to bone.
Make you feel safe and sound,
Not grasp you're on your own.
My work is swift you feel no pain,
You won't understand.
My blade is sharp your thorax's mine,
Your heart is in my hand

You're never safe when you're alone
And you won't feel a thing
When I loot your body.
Digging in the grime.

Do you know me now?
I'm Jack the Ripper
Do you know me now?
I am Jack the knife.

Do you know me now?
I'm Jack the Ripper
Do you know me now?
I am Jack the knife.

So young and sweet but not innocent,
Consuming every man.
You can't be missed, I'll take my chance.
Yes, I'll be damned.
No one knows my identity
But I'm a legend of my time
And I'm feared for what I've done
This little game of mine.

You're never safe when you're alone
And you won't feel a thing
When I loot your body.
Digging in the grime.

Do you know me now?
I'm Jack the Ripper
Do you know me now?
I am Jack the knife.
