Live your dream and live it well.
Soon comes the night
And you will dream in hell.
Build a tower to the sky.
Take on the powers
Not meant for you and I.

Can you walk on the water? NO!
Make no attempt, just turn around and go.

We are heading for the end
You found the key to immortality.
Thorns always come with the rose.
Here is what you got...
Humanity overdose.

For all of, eternity
She has played this game.
From half of, a century
Can you do the same?

Realize the holy Grail,
My oh my what a perfect plan.
But wait, the chalice's looking pale,
Polish it up if you can.

Step into the holy land.
Watch every move
'Cause damnation is at hand.
The gift of life is so divine.
But without death
Life will soon decline.
