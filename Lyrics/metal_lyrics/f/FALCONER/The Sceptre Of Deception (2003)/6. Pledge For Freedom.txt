[Erik:]
- I hope the future guides you well
Through archways paved in gold.
I hope tomorrow leads you right.
(To the gates of heaven!!) 
Count on me to stand by your side
in storms as well as sunshine.
Count on me to hail your name.
(As you see the bright light!!) 

Drop the crown onto my head, 
I'll mourn your death with
tears that needs to be shed.

Fall down and bow your heads for me
I am the king you all sought me, to be
To pledge you freedom

There are no dark clouds in the sky
So trouble not your mind.
There is no reason to rise.
(Keep your great halls heated!!) 

I hope the future guides you well
through archways paved in gold.
I hope tomorrow leads you right.
(To the gates of heaven!!) 

Drop the crown onto my head,
I'll mourn your death with
tears that wants to be shed.

Fall down and bow your heads for me
I am the king you all sought me, to be
To pledge you freedom

No more lies, deceits or malice 
Will haunt this family again
Linger on to life, and confirm you shelter 
Mark my words, I tell you the truth
