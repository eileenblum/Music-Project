[Birger:]
-It is with joy that I greet you.
Come inside, taste what is served for you.
Food does not lack, neither do wine.

Action or fate,
let's stir the mighty cauldron.
Love versus hate
by the sceptre of deception. 

[Erik:]
-Toast for you
and your glorious kingdom,
the home of heroes since early days.
Toast for us
and the newborn friendship.
It will now lead us on our way.

When the night became morning
the fire was no more, just reddest glow.
Down from the stairs the guards did descend.

[Erik:]
-Storming in upon us in the night,
what is this supposed to be.
Give me my sword and I'll:..

[Valdemar:]
-Our swords are useless here and now 
so give up this pointless fight.
Doomed is our luck tonight.

[Valdemar:]
-Ease this burden for I can not bare it, 
when dark shadows upon my soul play.
Can't look into the future
as my eyes cannot see the light of day.

[Erik:]
-Maybe you remember the game you played
me and my queen years ago?
Now it's my time to play!

[Ravenhair:]
-Who is laughing so evil?
It's the queen behind the walls of greed!
What cruel deed has she now done?
