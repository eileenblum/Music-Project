-= PROLOGUE =-

The Christmas of 1290 was soon to come and Magnus Ladulas was lying in his bed in the castle of Visingso. His body was weak of sickness and old age but his mind was still clear and sharp. He knew that it was not only his medical situation that was critical but the whole lands fate stood on crumbling feet. The future of his blood was unsure on the throne. Civil war was lurking around every corner in these unsteady days. There was however a way to evade a formal election and thus also a possible war. Some years earlier Magnus had been as provident as choosing his oldest son to be successor to the throne, although it was still an electional kingdom. Birger was now ten years old, still all  too young for his royal duties. The king then called for his Lord High Constable, Torgil Knutsson.

-"My three sons are still young, will you faithfully rule the land until Birger is man enough to take on the royal robe?"
-"Whatever you think is wise I will do for my land."

Torgil was deeply honoured by the duty. He got to be a wise guardian and the people were happy. With time the nobles' influence gained ground at the other estates' expenses. He withdrew the privileges of the church such as exemptions from taxes and army duty, something that did not taste very well in the mouths of god's men. Torgil's land properties expanded and he led a crusade to the east to be able to control the profitable trade with Russia.

At this time peace ruled the land but on the contrary the temper was another outside its borders. Denmark and Norway had icy relations since Danish magnates had killed the Danish king Erik Klipping and then fled to Norway where they got a refuge. 

Many people had gathered to join the ceremony and the streets and town squares were filled with excitement. High mixed with low without judgements or prejudices. There was plenty of food and entertainment during these joyous days. Torgil who arranged the coronation had twice the reason to feast. His daughter would on the very same day wed the youngest of the brothers, Valdemar. He thought that if he had Valdemar as son-in-law he could count on the younger brothers' support if Birger in the future would join up with the church and turn against him. Nothing could make this day more perfect.

-= EPILOGUE =-

In a prison cell  in Stockholm the former crown prince now received the tidings. He had stood on that very stone himself in the middle of the meadow as a four year old. Now he was one potential pretender too much. He had been involved in neither his uncles' death nor his father's coup d'etat so to him he was an innocent man. None the less, the execution was a political necessity to not risk history to repeat itself. As his exiled father heard of the fate his son had met he was so weighed down by grief that he had to be laid in bed, never to rise as the chronicles say.
