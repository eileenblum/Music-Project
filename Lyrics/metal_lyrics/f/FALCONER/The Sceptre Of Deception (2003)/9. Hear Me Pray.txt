[Erik:]
-Fly away my homeward mind,
out from darkness and touch the sky.
Chained and restless
yet flying high,
on wings of joy leaving my
fate behind.

I feel the silence,
I feel the dawn
coming closer for every
breath I take.
I hear my maker
calling my name all day
so God, hear me pray.

[Erik:]
-Please forgive us for our sins,
let not eternity yet begin.
Lost and broken
for the things we've done.
Longing to be caressed
by morning's sun.

Oh, please wait with paradise.
We are but fools in this
castle of ice.
