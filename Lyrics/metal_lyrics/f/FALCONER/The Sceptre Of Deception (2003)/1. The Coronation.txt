Blow your trumpets, let the feast begin.
Sing for us minstrels tonight.
Let the coronation shimmer and shine
in the golden sun so bright.

In a velvet mantle he takes the oath:
[Birger:]
-I will protect and serve my homeland
in the name of our lord.
Stand by me and we will prevail.
[The crowd:]
-Hail!

Remember the words of the old and wise
about what's wrong and what's right.
Do you know greed's face, the tongue of the snake
or the shades of black and white?

Receive the crown
and wear it with pride.
With it comes more than just the glory and gold.
Embrace the task
to stand by our side.
Fight for our freedom with the powers you now hold.
