Here I walk
On pathways so old,
Travellers of yesterday I still behold
Hearken to the waves
Caressing the shore
Oh how much land have they seen before

Oh, mountain great
How much you must know
So tell me stories from ages ago
Oh, vast sea
Whom shops sailed upon,
Why did they sail and where are they gone?

Behold the traces of history
Open your eyes and you'll see
That all across the land lies
Secrets to be revealed
The past still lives on

Lost mariners
Who still sail the sears
Who were your children you no more would see?
Earth, wind and water
And burning sun,
Bring me back to when we lived as one
