By the rail he stands
On black waves he rides
The tomorrow belongs to him
And the queen by his side
Do not fear the storm
Master the oaken galley
And be brave at heart
For your king and country

Turn the prow towards the storm
For it's too late to turn back

Royal galley under the sky
Ooooh ooooh
Breaking waves oh, so high
Ooooh ooooh

The ship is swaying
Great white sails are torn
"Work harder faithful crew,
Or you'll do nothing more."
The firm hand of doom
Makes the ship heal.
Rocking out of control

Bending up its keel
The impsing galley twists and turns
Struggling in the wild waves

Royal galley sailing no more
Ooooh ooooh
The ship is doomed forevermore
Ooooh ooooh

Panic and agony hands in the cold air
As we're heading towards our destiny
The figurehead is going down towards the black end
Never to be seen again crossing the seven seas
Clashing waves are our tragic requiem
Since the maiden voyage was the last to be

The golden flagship of the fleet
Is heading for its deepest grave

Royal galley lost at sea
Ooooh ooooh
Down in the deep, resent in peace
Ooooh ooooh
