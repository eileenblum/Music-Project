[The Ballad of Per Tysson's daughters in VÃ¤nge]

[Lyrics: Tradititional, Translation: Mathias Blad]

Per Tyrsson's daughters in VÃ¤nge
Oh how chilly their woods
They were fast asleep a long time ago
Whilst the woods burst into leaf

The youngest was the first one to awake
She soon awoke the others

They sat themselves down upon their beds
And plaited the hair on each other's heads

Then they dressed in clothes of silk
And made their way to church

When they came to VÃ¤nga hill
They met three robbers who held them still

"Pray, would you care to become robbers' wives?
Or would you rather lose your lives?"

"We would not care to become robbers' wives.
We would much rather lose our lives."

They chopped their heads off on birch-wood stem
And soon three wells sprung forth by them

The bodies were dug down in muddy ground,
The clothes they carried to VÃ¤nga town.

As they arrived in VÃ¤nga farm
Fru Karin came to greet them.

"Say, would you care to buy clothes of silk
That nine maidens have knitted and crotcheted?"

"Open your bundles and let me see
Maybe I know them, all three."

Fru Karin quivers as never before
And runs to Per Tyrsson who stands by the door

"There are three robbers outside our farm
They've gotten rid of our daughters"

Per Tyrsson grabs his sword and then
He runs to slay the two older men.

He asked the third one before he stroke
"Who is your father and mother?"

"Our father Per Tyrsson in VÃ¤nge,
Our mother Fru Karin in SkrÃ¤nge."

Per Tyrsson went to the smithy
And forged himself iron round his waist.

"What shall our retribution be?"
"We'll build a church out of stone and lime."

"KÃ¤rna Church shall be its name"
Oh how chilly their woods
"Oh, how willingly we will build it ."
Whilst the woods burst into leaf

[Per Tyrssons DÃ¶ttrar i VÃ¤nge]

[Lyrics: Tradititional: Swedish Version]

Per Tyrssons dÃ¶ttrar i VÃ¤nge.
Kaller var deras skog.
De sovo en sÃ¶mn fÃ¶r lÃ¤nge.
Medan skogen han lÃ¶vas.

FÃ¶rst vaknad den yngsta,
Sa vÃ¤ckte hon upp de andra

Sa satte de sig pa sÃ¤ngestock
Sa flÃ¤tade de varandras lock

Sa togo de pa sina silkesklar
Sa gingo de sig at kyrkan

Nar som de kommo pa VÃ¤nga lid
DÃ¤r mÃ¶tte de tre vallare

"SÃ¤g viljen I bli vallareviv
Eller viljen I mistra era unga liv?"

"Ej vilja vi blie vallareviv
Hellre vi miste vart unga liv."

De hÃ¶gg deras huvu'n pa bjÃ¶rkestock,
Sa rann dÃ¤r strax tre kÃ¤llor opp

Kropparna grovo de ner i dy,
KlÃ¤derna buro de fram till by

NÃ¤r som de kommo till VÃ¤nga gard
Ute fÃ¶r dom fru Karin star

"Och viljen I kÃ¶pa silkessÃ¶rkar,
Som nio jungfrur har stickat och virkat?"

"LÃ¶s upp edra knyten och lat mig se,
KanhÃ¤nda jag kÃ¤nner dem alla tre."

Fru Karin sig fÃ¶r brÃ¶stet slar
Och upp till Per Tyrsson i porten hon gar.

Dethaller tre vallare pa var gard
De haver gjort av med dÃ¶ttrarna var."

Per Tyrsson tar sitt svÃ¤rd i hand
Sa hÃ¶gg han ihjÃ¤l de Ã¤ldsta tva

Den tredje fraga han innan han slog:
"Vad heter er fader och mor?"

"Var fader Per Tyrsson ivÃ¤nge,
Var moder fru Karin i SkrÃ¤nge."

Per Tyrsson han gar sig at smedjan,
Han lÃ¤t smida sig jÃ¤rn om midjan

"Vad ska vi nu gÃ¶ra fÃ¶r syndamen?"
"Vi ska bygga upp en kyrka av kalk och sten!"

"Den kyrkan ska heta KÃ¤rna."
Kaller var deras skog
"Den ska vi bygga upp sa gÃ¤rna"
Medan skogen han lÃ¶vas
