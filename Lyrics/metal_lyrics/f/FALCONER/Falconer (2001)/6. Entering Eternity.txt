Riding through the echoes of the past
While the hooves pound the ground
Looking through the mist of the night
In the dim and covering light of the moon

Pale cold moon be my guide
Through this forest of the dawn
Enchanted wolves lead the way
To the land of infinity and destiny

I am entering eternity
Unfolding a new day
My future waits for me
To take me far away
I am opening realities
Never known before.

Here will my soul fly free
Forevermore

New dimensions open for me
As I reach my final horizon
Entering the world of the spirits
Dwelling in the shadow side
Of the living world

I'll be the soul of the wild hawk,
The whispering in the blowing wind
Or at the misty glade
I'll be the beast as the hunting wolf
Or the prey as the hunted hind
I'll be riding rays of light
Or lurking in the night's shade.
