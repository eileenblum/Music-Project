Behind the dark walls
Dark secrets hide in the shadows
An evil presence
In the fortress of light
Darkness is falling
As the spirit of God slips away
You're a sinner by night
And a holy saint by day

In the sacred corridors evil is set free,
Lurking among the shadows of the monastery

Heresey in Disguise
Heresey in Disguise

His eyes glow like fire
As he turns the ancient pages
Discovering mysteries
Not revealed in many ages
Brother William, brother of sin
What do you do as the sun descends?
Beware of what you might see
As you open the door
To the beast
