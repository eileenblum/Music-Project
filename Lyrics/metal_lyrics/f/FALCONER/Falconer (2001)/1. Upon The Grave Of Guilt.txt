Deep inside the black and winding mazes
I'm running from my ghouls,
My own thoughts are replaced by
The hidden faces deep from my soul.
Longing to see time rolling by
To case the thoughts of regret
My bad conscience tears me apart,
How will I ever forget

Dark recollections
Gnaw my inside
I've tried to run
And I've tried to hide

Reaching the barrow
Of my memories
To lay the final stone upon the grave
Searching inner kingdoms

For control
To put the lid of oblivion
Upon the grave of guilt

As I look into the mirror
I do not see my face
Two lying hollow eyes is staring back
With the look of shame and disgrace
My past is darkening my future
As my present dies
Every morning is a step towards
The edge of my soul's demise

Yesterday's demons
Is like a plague to my mind
That never seems to cure
Imprisoning me to
What I left behind
Letting my conscience
Unchain no more
