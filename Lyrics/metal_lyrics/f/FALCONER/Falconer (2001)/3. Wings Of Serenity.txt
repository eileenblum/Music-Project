Oh, you graceful eagle
That soar in the air,
How I envy your chainless life
You are calling from your sky
Living under the sun,
Just riding the winds up high.

Your cliff is your castle,
Your nature's truly royal,
A king in brown and grey,
Look down on the foolish man
Competing with time,
Chasing his precious day

You're flying on wings of serenity
Into the blinding light.
You're the majesty of freedom
Living life at its height
You're flying on wings of serenity
You're soaring above the ground
You're the majesty of freedom
Tranquility is your crown

Oh, please let me follow you
On your journey to the clouds
Take me up on your wide wings
And show me your world
We will cross the skies
New horizons we'll see,
Cross the slumbering landscapes
And disappearing into the dawn
