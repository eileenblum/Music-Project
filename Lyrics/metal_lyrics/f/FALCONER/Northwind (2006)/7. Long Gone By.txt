We dwell in a time of
Neither night nor day.
It's like an ever-eve
Of a gloaming light.
Our robes have gone grey
As we sailed to mortal shore.
The journey felt so short
To the gates of evermore.

The paths we used to tread
And the secrets we then told,
No one knows them by now
And we, we are too old.
We linger on hand in hand
Through the dusk-veiled glades.
Recalling our lives
As tomorrow, it fades.

Remember the times
When we ruled, you an I.
Where our Eden lied
In an age long gone by.
Your hair
Was like of a golden
Shiny dye.
Now so grizzled from
An age long gone by.
