From a dark horizon
A harlot once came,
Searching for the right path
To bring her to fame.
Ignorance and falsity:
A perfect symbiosis, for a royalty

Hold on
To your throne of glass.
Let not
Oblivion veil your name.
Stand strong
Against the days that pass.
Fight time
Your empty shell is the
Pillars of your fame.

In the tower of the queen
The joker loses his stage
As she wields the banner
Of vanity for the wage.

Beware
Doubles fill the court.
Who's who
In this hollow masquerade.
Take heed
Your reign might be short.
But wait
The crown on your head could be saved
By blood on the blade.
