Grasp your sword so blindly,
Time is in for holy war.
In the sign of a fairy tale
You sacrifice your precious life.

Yield to the nonsense,
Yield to the dogmatic scheme.
Kneel down embrace it,
Indoctrination supreme.

What is your inner holy delusion?
Will stupidity be canonized?
Would the Prophet or the Messiah
Then really welcome you in?

On a mission of evil
By a dreamer sanctified.
None believers shall suffer
For not believing the same lie.
