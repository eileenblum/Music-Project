Through the gates of hate I seeâ¦.

Eternal darkness, endless pain and evil anger
Surrounding the deep of an abyssal void
Flowing around cold edges
Like a frozen enraged beast

Black Tombs
Unholy thunders
Never ending pain
Creeping deathâ¦.
Through the gates of hate

Through the realms of hate I hearâ¦

Laments of infernal agony
Of an unborn frozen child
Crucified by its own sins
Buried into eternal ice

Cold breaths
Freezing chills
Agony laments
Funeral chants
Through the realms of hate

Beyond the throne of hate I seeâ¦

Whispering dreams of death and destruction
Frozen lakes of unholy blood
Burning black flames of the nameless
Freezing the lifeâs flows

Dark illusions
Goat lords
Burning flesh
Twisted minds
Beyond the throne of hate
