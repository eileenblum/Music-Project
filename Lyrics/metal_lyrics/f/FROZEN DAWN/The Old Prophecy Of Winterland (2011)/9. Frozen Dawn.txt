As the full winter moon twilight
The glittered landscape burns
Showing its bitterest face
Razing everywhere

Frozen Dawn â¦. Thrilling winds
Frozen Dawn â¦. Lightning storms
Frozen Dawn â¦. Winter rain
Frozen Dawn â¦. Lost remain

The fog arises,
Disguised in grey
As the clouds show another day
A day called to black.

No sun, no light,
No sign of life
Burned in white, covered with ice
Blizzard winds from northern lands.
