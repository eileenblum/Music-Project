In a cold winter night
My frozen soul awakes
From its icy prison
Hearing the call of the full moon

Nocturnal winds of death
Whisper into the darkness
Carrying black clouds and winter storms
Freezing every breath of life

Winds from the north
I hear your call [3x]

Winds from the north
Embrace me deep

The unholy smoke of the ice
Curse the blackened sky
Performed by frozen winds
Coming far from the north

Iâm in my ice graveyard
Surrounded by evil thoughts
Brought into my mind
By the cold of the night

The frost perform its ministry
Teaching me ancient rimes
In my cold asylum
I wait till dawn awakes
