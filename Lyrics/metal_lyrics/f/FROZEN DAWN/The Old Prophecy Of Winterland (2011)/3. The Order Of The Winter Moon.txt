At the vast frozen mountains
Where the horizon dies
The roar of the four winds blows
Beyond the edge of the Kingdom

Invincible voices of dark desires
Burial chants at the gates of the fortress
The Nine pray to the Dark Lady
As the shades of the winter night glooms

Beholders of ancient might
Keepers of the Nine seals
Guardians of the monolith
The Order Of The Winter Moon

And for Aeons, thy legend is still alive
And for Aeons, thy seals remain unlocked

Masters of black arts
Magicians and summoners
Bringers of darkness
The Order of The Winter Moon

And for Aeons, thy legend is still alive
And for Aeons, thy seals remain unlocked

A spell full fills the nocturnal sky
With grim cold voices,
The Nine invoke the ritual
Of reincarnationâs path.

Black winds, black order,
Black winds, black dawn.

Across the blackened fields
Torches lighten the path,
The Order unleashes black powers
As the starless night dies

From the burning abyss of my soul,
I call you my darkest queen

At the vast frozen mountains
Where the horizon dies
The Nine pray to the Dark Lady
As the shades of the winter night glooms.
