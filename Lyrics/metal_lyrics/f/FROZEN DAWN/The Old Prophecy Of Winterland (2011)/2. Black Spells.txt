I feel the embrace of the winter
As Iâm casting black spells
Spells that freeze my heart
Unleashing magical powers

I feel my soul cold
Cold into an ice coffin
Frozen for all times

Hallowed by dark cries
Into the heart of the woods
In the middle of Winterland

Powers of ancient majesty
Brought back by winter winds
Wicked spells by winterâs light
Forged in blood and pain
