Engraved by icy blizzards
Of endless winds and cold snows
The memories of ancient Kings remain lost
Inside the frozen veils of times

The extinguished cult of unholy rituals
The shadowed altars of sacrifice
Crystal coffins for elder dead monks
Burned out candles of black flames

Awaiting the come of the Dark Ladyâs son
The messiah, whoâs called to awake them up again,
The One that shall rebirth from the vaults of time
The old prophecy of Winterland

Evil shadows surround the monolith
Runes that open black gates
Cold demons arise again
The army of the northern wind shall march again

Raven wings and wolfâs claws
Acclaiming their new King
Echoes and chills of the cold souls
Beyond the heart of the winter woods

Awaiting the come of the Dark Ladyâs son
The messiah, whoâs called to awake them up again,
The One that shall rebirth from the vaults of time
The old prophecy of Winterland

Winterland, Winterland.

The black fog covers the glittered sky
Beneath the nine unbroken seals
The cult of the winter moon pray
For the come of the One
