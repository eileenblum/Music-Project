By the black moon shadows
The mysteries of ancient times
Arise in the deep of the night
Between mystical runes and words

With magical seduction of poisoned dreams
The fears and threats come true
By the command of old and forgotten rituals
Devouring the souls of the unscarred

Dark lady, mother of night
Darkness and death are your domains 
Dark Lady, Mother of night
The one of the unbroken cycle of death

Though the darkness of death
It's time to find the path
To worship you, goddess of night
Queen of the winter and ice

With mighty wrath you scour your kingdom
Thy servants are eternally by your side
Beloved mother of chaos release your powers
Imbue us with your black desires

The order of the winter moon sings
The secrets of the northern winds
Words spoken in forbidden hymns
Lurking in the shades of the night

Dark lady, mother of night
Darkness and death are your domains
Dark Lady, Mother of night
The one of the unbroken cycle of death

Though the darkness of death
It's time to find the path
To worship you, goddess of night
Queen of the winter and ice
