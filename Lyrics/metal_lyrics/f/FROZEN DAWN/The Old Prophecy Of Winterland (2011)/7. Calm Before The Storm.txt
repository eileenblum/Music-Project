I feel the cold winds                      
Heading from the north                
Electricity                             
Filling up the air

The gods of our ancestors                       
Shall take vengeance                   
The sky gets clouded                    
As daylight fades away

Thereâs something pending in the sky

Go!

Lightning coats the sky                
The storm is unleashed               
Thunder scatters                            
Across the land                              
This is the gods
Manifestation

My voidness
Becomes perspicuous
Being at mercy
Of mother north (ugh!)

The sun breaks through the ceiling                  
Built on the cloudy sky                              
The world seems once again                  
Purified from burdens

And when I roam the landscape            
My glance scours the beauty                  
That this destructive force                        
Revived so enviably
