The winter moon is rising
Awaking black ancient souls,
Souls of an ancient era
Of everlasting gods

Crawling in the night
The unforgotten cryptic soulâs ritual
Bring back to life
Black winged demons

Demons of black ivory horns
Twisted nails and thorny fangs
Not death nor alive,
Damned for all time

Frozen signs in a monolith of ice
Glittering cold in the winter winds
Ancient runes, dark invocations
Burning black sun in the deep of the void

Cold death, come back
I pray for you, I belong to youâ¦.

I will rise for you one more time
Oh!! You coldest souls
I will fight for you one more time
Oh!! You black majesty

I will fall for you one more time
Oh!! You coldest soul
I will die for you one more time
Oh!! You black majesty
