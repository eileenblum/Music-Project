Started the war
Never knew it would get this far
Been here before
Always questioning who you are

I gave it all
Gave it all
To you
Would stand and fall
For you
I gave it all
Gave it all
To you
So close to all we hold as true

And I lied
For the cause
Spill the demons out
To kill the false
And I'd die
For the cause
Spill the demons out
To kill the false

It still rages on
From sea to shining sea
The power of one
Always questioning who to be
