The hammer did fall too fast
The only one left in last
Stood before him and laughed
The mark it was true, the mark it was true

Only believing in fate
For seeing the signs too late
Was dying to be so great
Gave up on you, gave up on you

The glory of hate
The glory of pain
In time seeking all that was good
Hellspeak was the word
Heard only as true

The opened the gates to soon
Lost out on the coming moon
The blood of the fallen strewn
Only for one, only begun
