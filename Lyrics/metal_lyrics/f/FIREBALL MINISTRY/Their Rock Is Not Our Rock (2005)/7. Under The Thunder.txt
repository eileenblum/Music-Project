Call out the dogs
For the feeding's begun
Sing all the songs
For the best is to come
It stands to reason
That the story be told
They gave the honor
So the glory was sold

Not many heard the call
Set up to take the fall
Gave up before the gun
A cause that was unsung

Under the thunder now
Leaving them wonder how
Innocent ways for the true

The time had come
Of all man and of valor
Season's begun
All the souls had gone sour
Fortune and fame
They had stolen the power
What it became
Was an ocean of cowards
