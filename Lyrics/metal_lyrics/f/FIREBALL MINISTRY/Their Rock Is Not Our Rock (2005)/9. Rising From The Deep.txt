Leaving the lost, all the pain and emotion
One chance staring back at you
Gave it all back but it's all be stolen
Side stepping the payment due

You tried to run
You gave it up
You gave it up before you had to

Now the tide has turned
And the mountain is too sleep
Now the buildings burn
Rising from the deep

A sea of trouble, washed up on the shore
Took up a tired cause
Gave up a little, enough was more
Sealed up all the fatal flaws

There was another time
When all the sinners sighed
All of the beggard gave
And left their souls to blame
