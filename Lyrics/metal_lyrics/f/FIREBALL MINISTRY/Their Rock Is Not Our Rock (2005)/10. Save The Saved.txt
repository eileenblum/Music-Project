Pull the plug on all the non-believers
Electric charge behind the eyes
Static blood runs through the veins of deceivers
Steering clear of all the lies

Sight unseen
Untold dream
Hold it in 'till it explodes
By the code
Story sold
Travel fast on open roads

The time has come for killing
Not left for dead but willing
Save the saved
For the ones who prayed
Save the saved
For our rock

Weigh the strength of man by his need for malice
The strongest hammer strives the nail
