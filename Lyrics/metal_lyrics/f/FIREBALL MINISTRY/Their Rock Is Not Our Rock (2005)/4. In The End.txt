Draw the line
You're only killing time
It wasn't always mine
Of one it split in two

Left behind
A promise to decide
The masses will abide
Not knowing what to do

Tried flicking the switch
But it wouldn't give in
The signs for the rest of them

Now it's time for a fight
And there's nothing to gain
In the end they would be driven insane

Only son
Forgotten chosen one
The battle wasn't won
It only went away

Saw them hide
A mighty code of lies
The evil couldn't die
A power here to stay
