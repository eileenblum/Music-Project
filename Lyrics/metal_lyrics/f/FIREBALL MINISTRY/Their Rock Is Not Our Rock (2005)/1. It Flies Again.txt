Been locking for something
Something that was true
Benn looking for something
That wasn't like you

Came up from the ashes
Washed up on the shore
Crawled out from the seas of life
Only to settle the score

The liars
The cheats
And the beggars
Stared back in disgust
The liars
The cheats
And the beggars
Put out when they must

I gave it
I wanted
I listened
I stayed till the end
I gave it
I wanted
I listened
It flies again
It flies again

In time they would listen
In time it was seen
For all to be winning
And no in between
