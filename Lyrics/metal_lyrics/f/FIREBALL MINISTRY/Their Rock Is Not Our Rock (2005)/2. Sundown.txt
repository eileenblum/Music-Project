Well lock up the doors and be silent
Tell all of the children be still
A lifetime of pain is upon us
Never control a man's will

Sundown
Raise a fist to all before us
Rundown
Steel and sin were all they gave
Comedown
Pray the end will come to haunt us
Sundown
Send the demons to their grave

Listen for sounds of the dark ones
Spreading the fear they instrill
A lifetime of pain is upon us
Never control a man's will
