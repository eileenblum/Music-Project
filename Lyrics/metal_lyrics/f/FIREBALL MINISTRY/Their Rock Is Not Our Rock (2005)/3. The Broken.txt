The prophet of pain gave warning
The punishment due
Take heed of the early warning
In time it was seen as true

Four winds calling to zamora
Four winds of deceit
Four winds to the ghost of Yara
Four winds to defeat

Bow down to the thief of all men
The will to be tame
Bow down to the thief of all men
Only one time, only one to blame

I led the life unchosen
Gave the lesson to the broken
I heard the words unspoken
Gave the lesson to the broken
I led the life unchosen
Gave the lesson to the broken
I heard the words unspoken
Gave the lesson to the broken

The beast in the skies had risen
In time it would come
The lands had begun their schism
All bow to the fallen one
