[Aerosmith cover]

We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live, ain't a soul around
People start a-comin', all we do is just a-grin
We gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in

Tell me who ya know, and I'll tell ya who to
Go see my friend and he'll set you free
Tell me what you need and maybe I can go too
No one knows the way, but maybe me

Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where
You can find me

Good Morning! Glory!
Hallauiah to ya!
What is the story and
What's been goin' through ya?
Living like a King ??? off the land
Working like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're movin'
We're gettin' out
We're movin'
Without a doubt
We're movin'
We're goin' far
We're movin'
Yes we are, 'cause

Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where
You can find me
Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where
You can find me

Meddle with God and you're in tune withe the universe
Talk with yourself and you'll hear what you wanna know
Gotta rise above, 'cause below it's only gettin' worse
Laugh and time will take you where you wanna go

Good Morning! Glory!
Hallalluiah to ya!
What is the story and
What's been goin' through ya?
Living like a King ??? off the land
Working like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're movin'
We're gettin' out
We're movin'
Without a doubt
We're movin'
We're goin' far
We're movin'
Yes we are, 'cause

Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where
You can find me
Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where
You can find me

We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live, ain't a soul around
People start a-comin', all we do is just a-grin
We gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in
I said
We gotta move it out 'cause the city's movin' in
