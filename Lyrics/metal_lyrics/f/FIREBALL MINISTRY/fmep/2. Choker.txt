Across the sea
They came in three
Gave up your last breath
The time to lie
No one alive
Gave up your last breath
A time of fate
No give or take
Gave up your last breath
The sport is done
To kingdom come
Gave away the cause of death
It couldn't last
Into the past
Gave up your last breath
Their blood was clean
Their worst was seen
Gave up your last breath
The fallen one

The only son
Gave up your last breath
The vault is sealed
Their life concealed
Gave away the cause of death

If the call been made
Never was the chosen one
If the call been made
Gave away the smoking gun
