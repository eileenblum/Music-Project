[Misfits cover]

This street we walk upon
This corner full of piss and fear

This street won't bear it long
It slants, it tilts, it's brought outside
Alive

Cover your face when you walk by
Drench your visions in darkness

Spit up blood when you cough
Cool, cool, cool
Cough, cool, cool, cool

We dine on visions with new eyes
Creep, creep, creep, creep
We cut our visions with two eyes
Cool, cool, cool, cool

This street we walk upon
This corner full of fear
This street we walk upon
This corner full of piss and fear
