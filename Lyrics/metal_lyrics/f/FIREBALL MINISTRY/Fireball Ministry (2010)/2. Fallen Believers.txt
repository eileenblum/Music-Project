Head down last round all solutions the same
Fallen believers no one left in the game
Old world confusion sands of time running low
Caustic religion burns away too slow keep them guessing
Taught the lesson locked away behind the door fought the fever
A true believers till the same as before I gave up the one

That was really for you tried being the one that was really for you
Lost cause short straws clean hands washed away
Open ended only living today head down last round some will win
Some will lose fallen believers they were able to choose
