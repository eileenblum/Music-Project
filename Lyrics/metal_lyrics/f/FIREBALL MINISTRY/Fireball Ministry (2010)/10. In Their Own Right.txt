Insisting on resisting wont put the fires out the hands of time persisting causing
A thrash about victims of the circumstance seeing black and white
Martyrs or just arrogance in their own right in their own right

We got the place surrounded ainât going to go too far there'll be no thought
Propounded the carnival bizarre falling off the edge of time army for a fight
Living was their only crime in their own right in their own right
