You life was worth living but only so long you gave up forgiving and singing the song
All of the lies and all of the time giving up easy was your only crime looking back now and trying to sing
Sleeping with angels is the natural think look back on nothing
Try to make sense destiny's blessing went over the fence all the world's problems
You knew all along you gave up forgiving and singing the song I tried to call your bluff you knew you had enough
