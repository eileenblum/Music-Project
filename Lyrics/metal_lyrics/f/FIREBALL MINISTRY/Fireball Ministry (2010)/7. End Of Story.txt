There was a man who saw the reason there was a man who changed it all
There was a man they charged with treason there was a man who took the fall
We knew a man who had the power made us all see eye to eye
He took us to the final hour and never asked the reason why we have to stand up
For something have to live for today there's only one thing left to say
All looking for something all needing the cure time passes on empty feelings and it ain't stopping for sure

You were the man who saw the reason you were the man who changed it all
You were the man they charged with treason you were the one who took the fall
We always knew who had the power we never saw eye to eye
Sitting in the ivory tower he won and never had to try
