Edged out take your best shot it's the last time you'll be seen throughout
Found your weak spot regression toward the mean wrong one utility routine
We all can get along with a common enemy head strong born into the scene
We all can get along with a common enemy passed by made to measure never take the blame
Full on take your best shot nothing stays the same can't carry all the weight of all decisions
Made defend your alibi until you made the grade
