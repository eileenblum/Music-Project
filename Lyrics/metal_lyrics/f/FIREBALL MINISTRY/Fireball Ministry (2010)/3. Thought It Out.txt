Black balled burning all the bridges to heaven slack-jawed running
Out of issues to sell I don't want it I don't need
It I don't see it thought it out and maybe I do couldn't it apologize
For telling the truth out manned manifesting darkness in Eden

Too planned wearing out your welcome too soon
I'm not the one who went home too early I'm not the one who stayed out all night
Out of time picking up the pieces of mercy going blind after all the visions are gone
I'm not the one who went home too early I'm not the one who went home at all
