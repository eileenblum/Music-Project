Full on the work is done a pentecost for the prodigal son don't you believe it isn't over
We climbed the mountain to seek the truth nothing ventured nothing gained
Tomorrow's promise eye for a tooth forced the feeble to be trained and when the verity was rotten to the core
The choices laid before all to take their charity was better than before pride followed

By a fall time was we cleared the fog chances are in you are dragging the dog ain't going to be much of a hunter
Onward and upward we travel on only believing what we're seeing
There's just one question before it's done "Is life or death the symbol of being?"
