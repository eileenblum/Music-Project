Open lines can't afford the payout gone but not forgotten drift away and even through
The sell out I didn't want to watch them at all costs the man becomes a legend
Finding ways to stay clean close the door and find your way to heaven on the way
You lost the dream when it's all been said can't get ahead do not be afraid afraid 

Hard lines and you've had enough still waiting to call your bluff
Hard lines and it's all the same just step up and take the blame
All and all we give before we take it really ain't a raw deal
Only bad if no one ever commits there's just a look that's left to steal
