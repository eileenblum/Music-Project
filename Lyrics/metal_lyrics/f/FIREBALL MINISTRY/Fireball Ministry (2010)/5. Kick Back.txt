Can't stop the whining one who's bleeding last up the final curtain call
Lookout for any sign of leading I've said it all before you've heard it all
No lock. On any door looked over anyone who took the fall kick back begun
Kick back undone same old story kick back behind kick back unkind

All that faded glory don't walk don't ease the pain of strangers beneath there is an alibi watch out
There's a storm a coming watch out when the blood starts running watch out it was all because of you
Kick back undone same old story kick back behind kick back unkind
