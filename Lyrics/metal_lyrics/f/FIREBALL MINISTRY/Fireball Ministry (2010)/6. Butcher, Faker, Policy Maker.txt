So long consider me commuted stepped out of the rat
Race not wrong wouldn't have admitted not really a bad place
Stay strong my weakness is forgiven still new to the whole scene
Long gone didn't think I would give in real easy to come clean all signs
Pointed down the same road the last step is the hardest even though
It was shy of a load you still held it in contest it seems all has been lost
Butcher faker policy maker once all the rivers are crossed
Butcher faker policy maker about time taking what is needed

Won't end the confusion in line hating how they're treated
A simple illusion all wrong take it to the limit just needed
A game plan so long consider me committed not really a big fan
All signs pointed down the same road the first step is the hardest
Just waiting for it to explode so you can all protest
Butcher faker policy maker once all the rivers are crossed
Butcher faker policy maker about time taking what is needed
