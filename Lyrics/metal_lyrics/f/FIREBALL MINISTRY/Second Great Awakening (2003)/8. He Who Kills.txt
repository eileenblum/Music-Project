Open call to the fallen
The game's begun
Gave into the calling
For souls undone

Left out in the open
In the open
Gave up on seeing eye to eye
Four fires burning
And the black wheel keeps turning
Can't change the truth until you lie

Gave in to delusion
The battles won
Figured out the solution
Only just begun

Left out in the open
In the open
Gave up on seeing eye to eye
Four fires burning
And the black wheel keeps turning
Can't change the truth until you lie

Send back the sicknes
They all earned it
Can't fight the fallen
They all burned it
Just try forgetting

What they told you
Your life was only
What they sold you
Bought and sold you
