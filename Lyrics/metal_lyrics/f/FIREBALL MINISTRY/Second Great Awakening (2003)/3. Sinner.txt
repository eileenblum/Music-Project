Forgone
Conclusion
Wiping up the bitter end of emptiness
Sold out
Delusion

Past the time draining my head

And I've learned it
And I believed it
All of the things
Wasted in line
Never again

And I've called on the father
Spread disease among men
And I cast out the sinner
Stranger till the end

After
Forgiveness
Mastermind of all that's insane
Broken
Solution
Tried so hard to cope with the pain

And I've learned it
And I believed it
All of the things
Wasted in line
Never again

And I've called on the father
Spread disease among men
And I cast out the sinner
Savior till the end
