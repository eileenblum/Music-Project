Ante up the one who's deceiving
Beside the one who's believing
Emptiness to all that's raging
Honest man, never aging

Break down the walls of evil
Step aside for all that is good
Emptiness fills the chasm
A call to arms for war's orgasm

If I belong
Keep rollin' on
Ten miles too long
Keep rollin' on
