Summon evil to the masses
Open season on the weak
Call it out before it passes
Shut it down before it speaks

Rise
To the bottom
Time
To be true
Fall
When it's floating
Punish
Now it's due

Found it's way to the surface
After only
Came completely undone
Fell below the resurgence

Only to be
Crowned the master of none

Simple minded, open-ended
Honest envy, broke and mended

Rise
To the bottom
Time
To be true
Fall
When it's floating
Punish
Now it's due

Found it's way to the surface
After only
Came completely undone
Fell below the resurgence
Only to be
Crowned the master of none
