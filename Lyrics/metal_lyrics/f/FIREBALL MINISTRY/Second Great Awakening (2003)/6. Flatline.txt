Dead have been risen
Never forgiven
The kingdom of hatred
Born understated

Maybe I could find the one that wasn't here before
Beaten down under the rising sun
Fell from grace before you had the chance to learn to run
Tell the truth before your time is done

Fathers before us
Honored as pious
The ashes of seven
Raining down from heaven

Maybe I could find the one that wasn't here before
Beaten down under the rising sun
Fell from grace before you had the chance to learn to run

Tell the truth before your time is done
Fall in, Fallout
Broken through
Flatline, Mainline
Torn in two

Dead have been risen

The kingdom of hatred
Born understated
Maybe I could find the one that wasn't here before
Beaten down under the rising sun
Fell from grace before you had the chance to learn to run
Tell the truth before your time is done

Fall in, Fallout
