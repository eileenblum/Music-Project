Beyond
The life-giving highway
Reckless and innocent
The open door to everyday
Tried giving it up but it was already gone
For the weight of the world, didn't try to long

Cry out
The living fortress of pestilence
Over and under
Bow down for resistance

Too many fools have made their fortune
Broke drown the walls and found them crying
If I waited too long
To make right all that was wrong
It was innocent, only innocent

Begin
Never casting aspersions
Finding the solitude
Bow down for aversion

Too many fools have made their fortune
Broke drown the walls and found them crying

If I waited too long
To make right all that was wrong
It was innocent, only innocent
