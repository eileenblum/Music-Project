Drifting
Falling
Trying
To open the new sun
Screaming
Ending
Believing the one who couldn't run
And had I seenthe man inside of me
I might know the one who disagreed
Been building
Tried Living
Want to find The man who can't be found
Bring back
The lost one
I knew the time would come around
And had I seen the man inside of me
I might know the one who disagreed
There was a promise that I might return

Should of put it out before it burned
