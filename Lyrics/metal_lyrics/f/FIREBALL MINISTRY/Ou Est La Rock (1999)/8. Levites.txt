The end comes undone
Fear the chosen one
The time is at hand In the promised land
Hell driver
Only survivor
Weak and the wiser
Down on your knees
Hell driver
Your only provider
Power divider
Down on your knees
The forgotten survive
To be dead is alive In the end no one wins
Only die for their sins
Hell driver
Only survivor
Weak and the wiser
Down on your knees
Hell driver
Your only provider
Power divider
You're the disease
