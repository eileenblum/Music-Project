Far beneath the hated
Strangle the ill-fated
The hunted bastards die once more
Stare beyond the outside
Dismiss the strength of the tides
Never knew what we're here for
Truth dismissed
Judgement's fist find strength in confusion
Early grave
Easily swayed 3 times the illusion
End of time
Last in line never to be free
Careless collapse
The verdict past forgotten were 3
