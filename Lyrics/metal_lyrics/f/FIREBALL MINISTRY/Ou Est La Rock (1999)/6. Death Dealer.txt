Death beliver
Soul stealer
Time healer
How do they feel
Being born for the last time
Took it all away
Only came for what's mine
Now there's nothing to say
Can you feed me the right line
Bought and sold for the unkind
For the first time
For the last time
For my worst crime
My fate's been sealed
Being born for the last time
Took it all away
Only came for what's mine
Now there's nothing to say
Can you feed me the right line
Bought and sold for the unkind
