Abbadon
Coming on
Locust screams
The end is not what it seems
Fallen one
Destruction's son
Buried alive
No time to run and hide
Still waiting for the rapture
Your ticket's no way out
Living run
Damage done
Blackness swells
Suffocating in Hell
Abbadon
Always won
Endless strife
Time is not a measure of life
Still waiting for the rapture
Your ticket's no way out
