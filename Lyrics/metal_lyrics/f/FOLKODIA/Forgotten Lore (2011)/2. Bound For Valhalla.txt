Strike! Send me to Valhalla!
Iâll show you how a Viking dies!
It was not thy sword
But the Norns that decided my fate!

It takes a hero to put me down
Do you think you can even try?
The Gods are on my side,
The berserker rage is my guide!

Let your arrows fly to me,
Cast your spears strait to my heart â
I know no pain, death is my friend,
Iâm protected by Odinâs own shield!

Farewell my friends,
Iâm leaving today â
Bound for Valhalla.
I must be on my way!

Farewell my foes,
You were worthy indeed â
Bound for Valhalla.
Iâll see you there one day!
