Einherjer warriors
In silence march
Above the clouds
Aflame with sunset:
Hues of bronze and gold
Dancing reflections
On their shields and maille
The distant thunder roar
That forebodes a storm
Is the sound they make
As theyâre marching on
Throughout the aeons long
Into eternal halls
That shine with fame
And sings of their nameâ¦

Einherjer warriors
In silence march
Above the clouds
Aflame with sunset:
The tarnished gold
The stains of blood
The scars of battle
Washed with each rain â
The light in their eyes
Brings dawn to the sky
Each and every time
A warrior diesâ¦
