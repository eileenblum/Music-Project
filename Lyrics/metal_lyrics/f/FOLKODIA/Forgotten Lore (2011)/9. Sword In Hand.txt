Beneath the endless azure of the sky
Iâll ride a horse as black as night
With sword in hand raised aloft
To catch the pure white light
So that by blade is blessed
With the Rune of Morning Glory
And the chill of the wind
Is caught twixt the coal-black curls
Of my helmetâs mane
That billows in my wake
Like a banner of death unfurled â
A distant warning for my enemies to see
As I come riding down the hill,
Past the dolmens and the stones,
Through the trees that haunt
With sword in hand a glimmer in the light
For which I bled, was hunted down,
With sword in hand Iâll defend
Stand my ground and die glad of heart
For a swordsman knows no death
Only victory or Valhalla in the endâ¦
