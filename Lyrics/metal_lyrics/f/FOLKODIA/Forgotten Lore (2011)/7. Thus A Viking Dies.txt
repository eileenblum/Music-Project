See me as I lay,
Amongst my fallen brothersâ¦
Our swords are dim now,
Our shields shattered on the ground â
The light has pled our eyes,
Our hearts shall pound no more
In this here worldâ¦

This is how a Viking dies:
On the field of glorious war â
He stood fast to the very end,
By the sword he earned his fame!

This is how a Viking dies:
Besides the bodies of fallen foes,
On shores that lie many miles away
From home and hearth, away from the North!

Fight to the end â hail the gods!

Thus a Viking dies and yet
His spirit shall forever dwell
In Valhallaâs golden hall
Side by side with gods he feasts!

The Einhearjar await for him,
His seat is long prepared
At all-fatherâs dining table:
The Einhearjar raise him a toast
Of mead for the honored dead
Who fought and died like they did!

âI now live in the dream
Of fair Valkyries,
I now walk on fields
In Asgard evergreen:
My blood flows gold,
My eyes see afar
Like those of the eagle
Who now soars with me!

In Odinâs court I dwell,
In the shining hall
That lies cross the bridge
Guarded by Neimdall
Till the time is come
And he sounds his horn
Calling me to arms,
To do battle anon!â
