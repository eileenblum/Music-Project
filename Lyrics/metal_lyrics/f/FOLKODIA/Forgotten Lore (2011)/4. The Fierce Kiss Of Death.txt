The fierce kiss of death
Is felt through mine eyes:
See what no man
Should ever have to see â
And then in death youâll know
Comrade what I mean!

In an instant brief, a flash,
A blade comes for you â
Relentless it will plunge
Through armor, flesh and heart:
Your precious blood is spilled,
Thereâs nothing you can do!

The pain is white as Death,
He is your only friend â
You stood alone too long,
Your froze in the bitter cold
And now at last your fate
Is sealed by such a cruel blade!

The fierce kiss of death
Is felt through mine eyes:
See what no man
Should ever have to see â
And then in death youâll know
Comrade what I mean!

Is this glory toll?
Is this worthy of song?
Youâll never know my friend â
Youâll only sleep in death!
