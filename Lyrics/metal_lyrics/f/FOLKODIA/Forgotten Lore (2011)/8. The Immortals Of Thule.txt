Once long ago I was a man
Took pleasure in simple things
Then one day I sailed away
To far away lands, towards Thule

But a curse on me was laid
To stay and never homeward sail
Forevermore I will stand
As an immortal of Thule

Once long ago I was a man
Took pleasure in simple things
Then one day I sailed away
To far away lands, towards Thule
