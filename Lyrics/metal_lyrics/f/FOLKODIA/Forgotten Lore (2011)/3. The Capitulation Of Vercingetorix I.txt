Proud warlord now kneel,
Defeated, wan and in shame
At the Caesarâs sandaled feetâ¦

All these valleys that once were thine
Now are stained with the blood
Of the finest sons of Gaulâ¦

All these hills that you once called home
Are now shadowed by the emblem of Rome:
The eagle perched atop an iron SPQRâ¦

Proud warlord now crawl,
Behind the chariot that drags thee
Through the streets of Romeâ¦

The howl of the crowd
Rings like the curse of curses
To thy once proud and noble earâ¦

Proud warlord now die,
In agony and torment, die!
Your blood doth stain the arenaâs sandâ¦
