As far as I can see far off this frozen flatlands
Villagers relates the legend of the lone warrior
The one that could speak to gods of war
The one that could face death without fear
The one that could defeat a hundred men

Iâm not a legend
Iâm just a lost soul
There is no legend
There is only a man devoid of life

I was raised in the heart of an ironworks
My first and only friend is my sword
Those who cross my path
are bound for the after life
I was raised in the heat of an ironworks

Villagers relates the legend of the lone warrior
But Iâm not a legend
Iâm lost soul devoid of life
