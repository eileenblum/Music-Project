Alexander, the son of Zeus
Became a storm of flashing lances
That rained upon the beasts that dwelt
In the land of the Magog...

They who ate the flesh of man
And drank the blood of foal and child
Soon shall come to know the wrath
Of Alexander the divine!

To the east and far away
Rode our king that fated day:
In battle's clash with his phlanaxes
He bled dry the Magog...

Back into the underworld
Alexander pushed the Magog:
He build colossal gates of bronze
And a mighty, long wall:

The Caspian Gates he sealed
And all the ghoul-kings within:
Thus their evil was no more
As long as the gates hold...

Meri - Amen - Setep - En - Ra Arksantrs!
