A ship raises sail
Heads out to the sea
Ready for the enemy's defeat

As Naiads of woc
We bear down upon
Messina's straights
With flaming bolt
Ballistae of bronze:
We're ready to board!

Red churns the sea
With enemy blood

Trimeres sinking ablaze
Neptune doth claim the dead!

Black smoke filling the air
The depths shall be our grave!

O! Glorious day!
We are baptized in blood!
Our name shall be
In remembrance of thee:
We shall hence be known
As "The legion of the straits"!
What destiny commands
Lies in distant lands...

Desert sands
And cruel Gods
The blades of Judas
Masada falls!
Let them rejoice
They know not
That these walls
Shall be their tomb!

Sunrise is come
Mithras guide us forth!
Into the thick of war
Where heroes rise
Breast-fed by wolves
The blood of fallen foes!
Frater, steel thy heart
And take up your sword:

There is killing to be done!
Fell deeds - fire and blood!

Frater, steel thy heart
And take up your sword!

O! Glorious day!
We are baptized in blood!
Our name shall be
In remembrance of thee:
We shall hence be known
As "The legion of the straits"!
What destiny commands
Lies in distant lands...

An oath sworn on battlefields
The promise of the ironclad:
I swear to bleed by spear and lash
But never, ever shall I retreat!
