Ruler of the ether
Flame of the firmament:
Bearing the insignia
Of the black sun and moon...

Hannebu, wonder of the ancients
A secret 'ere Atlantis sank
Now doth rise again from the deep
To sow death and terror from above!

Hannebu pilot, a warrior in the sky:
Soaring over land, sea and the clouds -
Do or die! Warrior in the sky!
Hannebu rising - a lightning flash in the deepest night!

The craft of the Gods
Chariot of the Old Ones -
Now fallen into the hands
Of the Black Order...

Turbines rend the air
Vulcan fire, a deafening scream
A rotating Iron Cross:
Thy fate is sealed when they take to the wing!

Hannebu pilot, a warrior in the sky:
Soaring over land, sea and the clouds -
Do or die! Warrior in the sky!
Hannebu rising - a lightning flash in the deepest night!

No hope of victory
Against the weapon of the foe -
The fleet of Hannebu
Will soon swarm Europe...

Darting through the dark
Glimmering daggers
Ran through the stars:
A promise of death
As legions below
Hail the victory
Of the Black Sun
And the rising Hannebu...
