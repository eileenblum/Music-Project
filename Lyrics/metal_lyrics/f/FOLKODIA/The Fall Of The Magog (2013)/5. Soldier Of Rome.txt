Suctonius stands
Facing Boudicca
The 14th Gemina
'Gainst the Briton horde...

"I'm a solder of Rome -
I will not yield!
I will earn in blood
The legion's Martia!"

"Fear not their cries
Nor their empty threats:
Unwarlike, the barbarians
Shall soon come to know
The iron swords of death
Of their conquerors
That have routed their host
So of ten in the past..."

"I'm a soldier of Rome -
I will not yield!
I will earn in blood
The legion's Martia!"

"There is glory here
For every man to win:
Hold the Aquila high
Lock your scuta tight!
No mercy will be shown
On this field today -
Fight as one brothers brave!"

"I'm a soldier of Rome -
I will not yield!
I will earn in blood
The legion's Martia!"
