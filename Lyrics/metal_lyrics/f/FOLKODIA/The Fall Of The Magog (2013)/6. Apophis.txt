In darkness
It slithers
Chaos coiled thrice:
Reptilian eyes
Haunt the night...

Apep! Fiend of Izft!
Go back to thy pit!
In the name of Ma'at
The light that burns
Hoary one, I thee defile!

In blackness
It crawls
Terror coiled thrice:
Under  the Sphinx
Entombed, he resides...

Eyes that hypnotize
Ra and his court alike -
Great serpent of the Nile
In the name of Ma'at
The light that binds
Evil one, I thee defile!

"Apophis, old serpent vile!
Turn back and hide, thou
Whom Ra has banished!
In places deep, where terror sleeps
Retreat away from man and his kind..."
