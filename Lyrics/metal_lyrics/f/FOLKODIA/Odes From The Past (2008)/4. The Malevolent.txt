Hail me as the foeOf light and day alike-Hail me as the scourgeOf Gods and men that striveFor order in this world-All hail Loki, the melevolent! "In darkness I plot and scheme,With the fiends of the abyss...One day I shall be back,To show the Aesir the power of the One,The power of Loki, the malevolent!" Hail me as the enemyOf Odin's shining reign-Hail me as the LordOf the abomination of frost!My name is LokiLeader of the ravenous host! My day shall come,And it shall dawn red-Dyed with the goreOf my fallen foes!
