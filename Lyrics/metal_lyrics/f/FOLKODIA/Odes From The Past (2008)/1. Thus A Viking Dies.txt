See me as I lay,Amongst my fallen brothers...Our swords are dim now,Our shields shattered on the ground-The light has fled our eyes,Our hearts shall pound no moreIn this here world... This is how a Viking dies:On the field of glorious war-He stood fast to the very end,By the sword he earned his fame! This is how a Viking dies:Besides the bodies of fallen foes,On shores that lie may miles awayFrom home and hearth, away from the North! Fight to the end-hail the gods! Thus a Viking dies and yetHis spirit shall forever dwellIn Valhalla's golden hallSide by side with gods he feasts! The Einherjer await for him, His seat is long preparedAt all-father's dining table:The Einherjer raise him a toastWho fought and died like they did! "I now live in the dreamOf fair Valkyries,I now walk on fieldsIn Asgard evergreen;My blood flows gold,My eyes see afarLike those of the eagleWho now soars with me! In Odin's court I dwell,In the shining hallThat lies 'cross the bridgeGuarded by Heimdall'Till the time is comeAnd he sounds his hornCalling me to arms,To do battle anon!"
