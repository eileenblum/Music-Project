High up in the sky I see twin raven fly... Hugin and Munin guide me To the Hall of everlasting light! If I in a battle should dieI will sit by Odin's right side... A fight is a path that leadsHeroes to the sky, past the bridgeWhere Odin's ravens fly-High up in the sky! Valkyries take my hand, carry me,High up in the sky, to Valhalla lay me! High up in the sky,Where the eagles fly,My brave brothers wait:A seat they have prepared for meAnd a horn of mead-I'll tell them my tale,Show them my wounds,Tell them how I diedAnd found myself at lastHigh up in the sky fire...
