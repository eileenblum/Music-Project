Wherever I tread on this haunted, holy groundI look to the skies above,the clouds armed with storm... Born of thunder is he who ridesDown from the tempest's burning soul,To Midgard with a hammer in his handOn his chariot made of living fire... He's the protector of men:His name is a magic word;He's a god come from on high-He's the one... Whenever I see the glory that dawns each morn,Frozen like steel, enchanted by Northern light... Born of thunder is he who ridesDown from the tempest's burning soul,To Midgard with a hammer in his handOn his chariot made of living fire... He's the protector of men:His name is a magic word;He's a god come from on high-He's the one... Robbed in such splendor,Immortal eyes bedewedWith the gift of prophecy... Where I tread on this haunted, holy groundI took to the skies above, the clouds armed with storm... Born of thunder is he who ridesDown from the tempest's burning soul,To Midgard with a hammer in his handOn his chariot made of living fire...
