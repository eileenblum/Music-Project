Raised viking sails,The grinding of axes:One takes up the swordThe other the spear and bow Wives they left behindAnd their children alike;Their enemies awaiting Standing on the shoreline: 'Ere the nightThey shall die!Back home againFew shall return... To victory, through honor first,In valhalla they shall find rest!Odin's warriors they shall remainForever more, 'till victory one day!
