Over broad seas and deep oceans
Sail Viking Drakkar ships
In the ships are brave, armed warriors
Sailing proudly to one more battle.

Bearded and strong
Who are they? Viking warriors!
Young and old
To the word hero they gave worth!

And no one knows who will die, who will come back,
An answer to that only doom can give...
It they don't win now
After some time they shall try again!
