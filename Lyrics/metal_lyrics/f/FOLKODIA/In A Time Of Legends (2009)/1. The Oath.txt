Thor, great god of thunder
I swear on your mighty hammer
I shall ride under thy command
To where the tempest doth rage
To face without fear in my heart
And vanquish, smite and slay
All thine enemies where they stand...

Odin, great god of magic
I swear on your divine spear
I shall ride under thy command
To where thy ravens doth fly
To face without fear in my heart
And vanquish, smite and slay
All the blasphemers who tarnish thy name...

Tyr, great god of war
I swear on your right hand
I shall ride under thy command
To where the wolf doth hide
To face without fear in my heart
And vanquish, smite and slay
All those who defy thy justice this day...
