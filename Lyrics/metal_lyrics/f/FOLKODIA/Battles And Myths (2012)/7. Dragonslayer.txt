The lord of Light
is known by many names:
Apollo, Delphic Archer,
Paean, Leader of the Muses...

Dragonslayer!

You who faced
The reptilian miasma
Eleven thousand years ago
You who led those of your blood
In glorious battle to the farthest east...

Dragonslayer! Lord Apollo,
Welder of the light that burns
Archer of power, Mighty holy one,
Mighty God, Mighty Immortal One:
Rise again and deliver
The children of the stars
From the Dragon's tyranny!

Apollo, the dragonslayer,
Phoebus the fair-haired,
Is coming back at last
On the outstretched fiery wings
Of a storm from the sun...

Raise your right hand to the sky.
Hail the sun personified!
Death to the tyrants,
Vanquish the reptiles!

Dragonslayer! Lord Apollo,
Welder of the light that burns
Archer of power, Mighty holy one,
Mighty God, Mighty Immortal One:
Rise again and deliver
The children of the stars
From the Dragon's tyranny!
