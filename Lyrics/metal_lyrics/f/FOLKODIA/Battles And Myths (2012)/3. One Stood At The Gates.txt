Ragin fires sweep
The corpses on the battlefield
Arrows scream, an ebon swarm,
The wall is breeched...

Where all defenders lie dead
Drowned in the blood of their dreams
With broken swords still clasped
In their frozen hands
Where all hope is quenched
And victory can never be
When dragons fly in the air
Covering the sun with their wings...

Let it be known
That then and for all time
One stood at the gate
Facing them all!

When carnage reigned
Within the dreaming city's walls
One stood at the gate
Proud, defiant to the foe!

He stood all alone,
Just a man and his sword
He had lost all his hope
So he was left with a thirst to kill!

Let it be known
That then and for all time
One stood at the gate
Facing them all!

Lost was his fight,
Last of a dying race
A knight in a world
Where chivalry is no more!

The fire in his eyes
Was the amber glow
Of burning ideals,
Of all that he held dear!

Let it be known
That then and for all time
One stood at the gate
Facing them all!
