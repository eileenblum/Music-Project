I don't want no gold nor jewels
To bediadem my brow
Steel is what made me a man
And by steel I'll rule as king!

Fech me my helmet tall
And my shield of dragon horn
Ready now my heavy horse
As my fingers grasp my sword:

Caliburn, sword of the kings,
Today our shall be the field!
Our foes forgot that you and me
Yearn their worhtless blood to spill!

Raise my crimson banner high.
Let five dragons fill the sky
Amass the knights and men-at-arms
Form ranks and forwards march!

Ahead of all they'll se me ride
The king of kings who reigns on kings
There is no death for noone of us:
For eternally shall live the brave!

Caliburn, sword of the kings,
Today our shall be the field!
Our foes forgot that you and me
Yearn their worhtless blood to spill!
