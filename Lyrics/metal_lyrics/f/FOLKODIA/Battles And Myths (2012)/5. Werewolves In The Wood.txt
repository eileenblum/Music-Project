You thought it was all over
You said we were done for
Yet why do you fear
To venture deep into the woods ?

You know we're lurking there,
You've seen our eyes glimmer
You've heard the growl that years ago
Made you cower and run in fear...

We have not surrendered
And never, ever, shall we kneel!
We are the fighting werewolves
The battallions of the woods!

We had a dream, we nursed a hope
But you tore it down in flames:
You made our honor seem demonic
Let it be! Let your nightmare come to life!

You thought you saw
The iron eagle fall
You said you've crushed
The Empire's mighty men...

We have not surrendered
And never, ever, shall we kneel!
We are the fighting werewolves
The battallions of the woods!

The figh rages on
For the werewolf braves!
Cower in fear when the night falls:
We will be coming for you and your lot!
