Sky draped by a gloomy veil,
Unusal illusive peace,
Nature seems to hold its breath
At the hands of this imminent threat

Going through mountains and forests
The watchman patrol saw the enemy's squads
Our soldiers saddled up the horses
Only the victorious will get back home

The encounter can't be avoided
Tension is at is height
Weapons are all set to spread the blood

The air is freezing cold
The wind is carrying a fetid scent of fear

Inhuman figures appears from the woods
Nightmarish sight from the underworld
Running wild demonic creatures pouncing on us!

Going through mountains and forests
The watchman patrol saw the enemy's squads
Our soldiers saddled up the horses
Only the victorious will get back home
