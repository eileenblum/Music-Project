[Bonus Track][originally by Black Sabbath]Well, I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache
Before it takes me away from my mind

Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes that can spin in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead

When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And let tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me

So realize I'm much better without you
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living
But this time I'm gonna have the star part
