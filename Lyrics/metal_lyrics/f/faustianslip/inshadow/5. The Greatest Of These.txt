Let us not forget
Let us understand
That cold hearts tend to create cold hands
And your black soul removed from the grave
Was grace given, so that others might be saved

Words without love
A clanging noise
Faith without love
Is null and void
Works without love
Remain empty
Sacrifice without love
Gains not a thing
