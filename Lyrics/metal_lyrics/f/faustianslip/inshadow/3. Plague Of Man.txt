Darkness weighs down on this Earth
A doom that all can feel
It eats away at our souls
Though we pretend it isn't real

We feed our flesh amusements
To distract us from the fear
Out of sight means out of mind
We pretend we're happy here

Our hands plucked out our eyes
The same severed our ears
For the truth is so much sweeter
When you neither see nor hear

And yet there stands a lasting hope
A cry above the sky
"Return to me, my children
Your only hope is I"

"But I am whole, not broken"
Says the man "and all is well"
As the cancerous dark consumes him....
"I do not need your help"
