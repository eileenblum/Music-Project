Wherever you go - there you will find me
Wherever you lodge - that is my home
Wherever you die - there I'll be buried
Your people are mine - your God is my God

Do not ever urge me to go
Or desert your side and leave you
For may God to me
And more if anything
But death separate you from me

For may God to me
And more if anything
But death separate you from me

Do not ever urge me to go
Or desert your side and leave you
For may God to me
And more if anything
But death separate you from me

For may God to me
And more if anything
But death separate you from me
