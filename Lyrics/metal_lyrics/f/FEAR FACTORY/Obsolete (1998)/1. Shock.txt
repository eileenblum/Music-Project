Shock!
Shock!
Shock!
Shock!

Welcome to my world
Headfirst to the earth
With my sights on the god-damned kill switch

I've become a fuse
Charged with attitude
Fixed and dilated by my anger

I have become a direct
I have become a current
I have become a direct
I have become insurgent

I will be the power surge
Shock to the system
Electrified, amplified
Shock to the system

Shock!
Shock!

Alternate my wires
Heat my core desire
I will not stand for condemnation

I've become the volts
To lead the revolt
Fuck with me ensues certain danger

I have become a direct
I have become a current
I have become a direct
I have become insurgent

I will be the power surge
Shock to the system
Electrified, amplified
Shock to the system

I will be the power surge
Shock to the system
Electrified, amplified
Shock to the system

I am the power surge
I am the insurgent
Electrified, amplified
Electrified, amplified

Shock!
Shock!
Shock!
Shock!
Shock!

Shock to the system
