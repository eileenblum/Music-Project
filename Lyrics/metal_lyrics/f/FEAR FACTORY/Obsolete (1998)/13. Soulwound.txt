[Digipak Bonus Track]A tortured whipping dog defiled
Stalked by oblivion and denial
Scarring lacerations
Hopeless devastation

The cuts, cut deeper
The cuts, cut deeper
The cuts, cut deeper, deeper, deeper

These wounds are small slices of death
Draining my soul and final breath
Self-inflicted dementia
Bone shallow gravedigger

The cuts, cut deeper
The cuts, cut deeper
The cuts, cut deeper, deeper, deeper

Soulwound
Soulwound
Soulwound
Soulwound

Soulwound
Soulwound
Soulwound
Soulwound

Soulwounds I can not conceal
These wounds are so hard to heal

A tortured whipping dog defiled
Stalked by oblivion and denial
Scarring lacerations
Hopeless devastation

The cuts, cut deeper
The cuts, cut deeper
The cuts, cut deeper, deeper, deeper
