These weapons of mass destruction
Around our world, threat to us all
Operated by fears (fears), cold over years (years)
Systematic death (death), terminal breath

Leaders of our time just stand behind
An arsenal to end us all
Fighting a war (war), we can't ignore (ignore)
Destined to fall (fall), cowards to all

Cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards to all
Cowards to all

We are losing weapons controlling
This is the hour of your reckoning

These weapons of mass destruction
Around our world, threat to us all!
Fighting a war (war), we can't ignore (ignore)
Destined to fall (fall), cowards to all

Cowards to all

We are losing, weapons controlling
This is the hour of your reckoning

No more arsenal threatens all
Heading for a downfall
Mass destruction, mass destruction
Mass destruction for all
