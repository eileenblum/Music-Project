Noise in the machine
A world of lies backfires on you
Choke cause and effect
Built to collapse the final breakdown
To the system
Fire weapons of fear
Human affliction ever grinding us down
Blood fuels the engines of dissension
We are scabs and the scars now
We are nothing to the system
We are nothing the end
Betrayed and disowened
To suffer alone
