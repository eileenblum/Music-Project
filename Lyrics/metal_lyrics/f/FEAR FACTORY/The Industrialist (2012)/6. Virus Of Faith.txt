"Hope is threatened... Scarcity distortion... What is relevant?...
Social industrial machines... A future by design!"

Obedience to higher arcane
Altered state of machinery
Do not comply to protocol
There is no real law of war, law of war, law of war

Those who remain
Are those who have stolen
What's in a name?
For I am no one

Virus of Faith

Invoking god to spite enemies
Judge mankind implicitly
Kill everyone who does not see
Kill everyone who does not believe

Those who remain
Are those who have stolen
What's in a name?
For I am no one

Those who remain
Are those who have stolen
What's in a name?
For I am no one

What is faith? [6x]
