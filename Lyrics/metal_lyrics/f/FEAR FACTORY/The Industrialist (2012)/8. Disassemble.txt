What you cannot see is not what it seems to be
your life manufactured, to be disassembled
your world dehumanized, godless, desensitized
your mind insignificant, god damned degradation
falling down, breaking down
all comes falling down

I am your fate to bring your world of hate
to a final for my existence
I will tear you down
burn you to the ground
falling down, breaking down
all comes falling down
your world will end
your day is dead
your time will end
your world is dead
to me
