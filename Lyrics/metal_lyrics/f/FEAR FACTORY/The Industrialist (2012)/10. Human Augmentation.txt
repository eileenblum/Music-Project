I am a being
My life has value
Seek as i seek the secret design
My purpose is to relate with out bitterness
Or partiality from any motives
To which i am far removed
Fueled by antagonism
Accelerated panic
Headed towards a catastrophic event
Penetrating thoughts
Negative impressions
I don't feel...
I can't shed a tear for all the unnumbered dead
Desperate and exhausted the human character lays wasted
Like emotional distortion
Death is perceptible with definable features
I've had all that i can take
Yet the pain remains
My body is lacerated
My mind is poisoned
Ultimate revelations...
