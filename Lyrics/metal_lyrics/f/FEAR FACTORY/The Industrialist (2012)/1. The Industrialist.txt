"They say the world was coming to an end... Well..
It was by our own hand.Â  Turned out the world kept turning, only we ended
All the evidence was there... The punishment of faith creating animosity
between our brethren...
The dissolution of humanity in all cultures... The reluctance of acceptance...
Bigotry, ignorance and
narrow mindedness destroying our world..."

Slaves to incorporation
hate that excludes no one
enforced by the laws of deception
chained to the systematic suppression
fear, the source that fuels their greed
scraped down and warped reality
tensions explode a fire to purge
friction and anger to conquer and surge
we are victims of condition
a god damn nation of deprivation
power to kill death of free will
a system above and beyond the law
attrition through armed enforcement
an abomination of service
a criminal injustice system of laws
inherently dangerous for us
there will be blood
