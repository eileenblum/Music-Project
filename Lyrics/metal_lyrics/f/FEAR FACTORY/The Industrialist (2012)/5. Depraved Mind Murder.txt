I am a self contained machine
Prefabricated, no sympathy
My mind lay bare to world depression
My man made soul in isolation
I have been scraped by humanity
Darkness confines every injury
I must make witness with bitterness
Concealed existence of countless dead
I'm not a walking form of waste
Amassed illusion burning disgrace
I have been scraped by humanity
Darkness confines every injury
Deprivation has been forced on me
I am losing all my memories
They are nothing more to me then a dream
I reject all visions of reality

My metal heart is a dark shade of metallic dust
