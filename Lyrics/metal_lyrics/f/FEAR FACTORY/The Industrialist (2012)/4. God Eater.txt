No gods, no kings only man
They are not one of us
Disconnected and unwanted
Distressed and cut off
Hope and dispair silencing the world
The future is black and grey
There is no tomorrow
Torn apart by weakness
A cancer on the earth
No gods, no kings only man
The spirit lies contaminated
The fall of seduction
Transformation of yourself
Dark clouds in your heart
No gods, no kings only man
