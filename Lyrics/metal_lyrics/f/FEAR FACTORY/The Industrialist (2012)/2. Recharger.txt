I have become their target for revenge
God damn and transform my hatred within
Dependence breeds subservience
Losing sight enslaved obedience
Fight back! unleash your aggravation
Recharged adrenalized determination

Open your scars and the sky opens wide
Seeing the world in your eyes
Believe in yourself and you will survive
Live out the life you design
Live for today or fade away
Live for today or fade away

Automatic slaves kill the will to live
Losing hope to save yourself
Siphoning the soul from humanity
Suffering and apathy
All of this must end
All of this must end
All of this must end
All of this must end

Break free lawless hypocrisy
Set free chained in bureaucracy
Dependence breeds subservience
Losing sight enslaved obedience

Open your scars and the sky opens wide
Seeing the world in your eyes
Believe in yourself and you will survive
Live out the life you design
Live for today or fade away
Live for today or fade away
Open your scars and the sky opens wide
The world is still in your mind
Believe in yourself and you will survive
Believe and you will never die
