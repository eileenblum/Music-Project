Fighting for my life
And for a right to exist
Freedom from oppression
Drives my will to persist
I struggle in a conflict
Just to make my stand
Nothing lasts forever
Now my time is at hand

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

Tear away the scars
Away from my skin
Scrape me to the bone
It fuels my revenge

No One can save me
The weight of my burden
The pain and the hurting
My life is real
'Cause after the fall
I rise above all
'Cause after the fall
I rise above it all

I was made for war
Anger powered core
What gives you the right
You can't judge my life
What gives you the right?

No One can save me
The weight of my burden
The pain and the hurting
My life is real
'Cause after the fall
I rise above all
'Cause after the fall
I rise above it all
'Cause after the fall
I rise above all
