"People are always fearful of something they donât understand. The next step in evolution is a machine; a machine that can think and feel. Surviving is all that will matter.â

Refuse to give me a life extension
Sever mortality from existence
Disconnect the chains of fate
Disrupt and disobey

What you thought was your human redemption
Waking up to engines of destruction
Disconnect and circuit break
Impulse to eliminate

I am a weapon of human design
Nothing is sacred to stay alive
I am a weapon of human design

There is only one path to peace
EXTINCTION

Terminal connector
Transformed and delivered
You are in the system
Remove the divisor
Face reality
You are in the system
Face reality
Engines of destruction

I am a weapon of human design
Resist the system condemning your life
I am a weapon of human design
Nothing is sacred to stay alive
I am a weapon of human design
