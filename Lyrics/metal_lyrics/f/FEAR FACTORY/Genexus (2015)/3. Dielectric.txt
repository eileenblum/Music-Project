Electrocution
My will intensifies
Voltage division
Your power I defy
Disconnecting all mankind
Endless conflict to the end of time

Pulse modulation
Disrupting energy
Harmonic vision
Throughout eternity
My dissonance overpowers you
Mind distortion always cutting through

I will never break
Or suffer your hate
Flowing through my veins
Dielectric strength

Insulated to resist
My free will must exist
I will be the avalanche
Bringing your world to collapse

My dissonance overpowers you
Mind distortion always cutting through

I will never break
Or suffer your hate
Flowing through my veins
Dielectric strength
I will never fade (will never fade)
I resist the pain (resist the pain)
Burning through my veins (through my veins)
Dielectric strength
Dielectric strength
