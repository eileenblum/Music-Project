Ancient beliefs
Are a curse on mankind
Theories of punishment
Leading the blind

Force the concept of mortality
Force attack to kill the disease

Bow down submission
Kneel to obsession
Pray to infection
Church of Execution

Your static doctrines
Overreach the past
Faith executions
Through cowardly acts

Force the concept of mortality
Force attack to kill the disease

Bow down submission
Kneel to obsession
Pray to infection
Church of Execution

Death as a way of life
Godless contagion
Drawn in the promised land
New retribution
Your false epiphanies
For persecution
Hollow morality
Lethal religion

MANUFACTURED LIES
DESTROYING ALL LIFE

Bow down submission
Kneel to obsession
Pray to infection
Church of Execution
Bow down damnation
Force fed salvation
Pray to infection
Church of Execution
