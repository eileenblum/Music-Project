[Bonus Track]Your life is not a dream
The fading lights unforeseen
Find the time to comprehend
One last prelude to the end

Reaching out for the unknown
Across the darkness of your soul
Vanishing space and time
Along the memories of your mind

Live for today
Our lives fade away
Live for today
Our lives fade away

Reaching out for the unknown
Across the darkness of your soul
Vanishing space and time
Along the memories of your mind

Live for today
Our lives fade away
Live for today
Our lives fade away

Our lives fade away
Our lives fade away
