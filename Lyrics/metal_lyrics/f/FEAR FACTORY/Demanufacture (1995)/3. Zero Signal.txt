So, withdrawn and feeling numb
Watching life come all undone
Growing fear, a human grace
A drowning mind in a dark embrace

My life in disarray
And I fade away

I am down on my knees
Praying beyond belief
The silence deafens my ears
And welds the shackles onto my fears

Lost all faith
Lost all trust
Lost all faith
Lost all trust

So, withdrawn and feeling numb
Watching life come all undone

My life in disarray
And I fade away

I am down on my knees
Praying beyond belief
The silence deafens my ears
And welds the shackles onto my fears

I have lost all faith
I have lost all trust
A sordid mesh turning to dust
A sordid mesh turning to dust

I am lost
I am so numb
I am so numb

I am so numb
I am so numb
I am so numb
I am so numb
