[Spoken introduction:]
Everything is increasing, so violence is increasing, burglaries are increasing, armed robberies are increasing. More people have guns on the street now than ever be attacked.
Gun won't use.
They won't shoot you, they will stab you.

[A quote of San Bernardino cop in an episode of "COPS" movie:]
Gun control is, uh, is not working at this point. Everybody still has a gun. Whether it's a 22 or a 9 mm, they, they still have a gun. And they're really quick to pull that gun, and use it on another individual without a second thought. Once that bullet leaves the barrel, it's not coming back.

The conscious man is dead
And I buried him
Beneath this scarred tissue
Armored skeleton
The machine is now alive
Desensitized with open eyes
Powered by an angry mind
And is refueled by those I despise
despise

I've become what they detest
A delinquent survivalist
Without fear and no regrets
They fucking say

I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal

I must steal to survive
I must kill to moralize
Leaving people victimized
Fuels my angst inside

I'm your judge and your jury
You don't get an attorney
With my verdict of guilty
An execution in fury

The machine is now alive
To wreak havoc in your lives
There's no use to hold me back
I am ready to attack

[Spoken:]
[Recited by Burton C. Bell, but quoted from Linda Hamilton in "Terminator-2" movie:]
I lived only to face a new nightmare: The war against the machine.

[Spoken:]
Complete over just dead

I've become what they detest
A delinquent survivalist
Without fear and no regrets
They fucking say

I am a criminal [8x]

Criminal!
Criminal!
Criminal!
Criminal!

I am a criminal!
I am a criminal!
I am a criminal!
I am a criminal!

[Spoken:]
The war against the machi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-nesâ¦
