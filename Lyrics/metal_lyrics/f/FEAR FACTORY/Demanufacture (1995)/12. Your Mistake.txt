[Bonus Track]It's your mistake

We're here to be and the ones to succeed
No need for you to tell us how to be
Can't seem to find your reasons why
You tell us lies and think you're wise

Why can't you think
Before you sink
Why can't you see,
Then come to me

Tell us lies
And ask us why
We hate society
We're here to fight

I won't shake their hands
'Cause they're not our friends
Won't talk to you
'Cause you can't be true

You've got problems,
Yet you keep hiding them
You entered their gate
But now it's too late

It's your mistake
It's your mistake
It's your mistake
It's your mistake, motherfucker
