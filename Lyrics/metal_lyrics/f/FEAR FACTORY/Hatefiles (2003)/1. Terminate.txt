Drop!
All that is dead around me
Lifeless in the wake of catastrophe
Burning in my mind I am not deceived
Judgement into my own mortality
[Chorus:]
Now that the soul is free
I servered ties of man and machine
Now that the soul is free
I bled my heart of all it can bleed
Lighting the spark, igniting the fuse
Destroyed the lies and saw absolute truth
From out of darkness and into the light
The future is wide open and is on my side
[Repeat chorus]
You can't stop it
You can't kill it
And it won't stop coming
Until you're dead
[Repeat chorus x2]
