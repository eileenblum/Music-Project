Burn Away The Shade
Where Babies Were Born And Played
In The Corporate Eyes
These Murdering Machines

Seeds Of Destruction
Feeding Their Hate
Slowly Killing Indians
As They Burn Thier Sacred Place

Opress
Depress 
Famine
Asphyxiation

No Air To Breath
Buried Without A Name
As They Spread Disease
It's All The Same

Burn Away The Shade....
