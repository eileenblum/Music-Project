rise above rise above
steal away to hide your shame
rise above rise above

rise above your oppression
above the one that hates you
above the one that lies
above the pain that hates
death fear rage

rise above rise above
rise above 
rise 
rise 
rise

rise above your oppression
above the pain and suffering
above the one that hates you 
and kills you
through all of your life
