I realize my world of demise
and the poisonous sky
that's stinging my  eyes
I clench my fist
I spill my blood
I clench my fist
'cause I am the tool

I'm burning with contempt
that's bringing me down!
I'm burning with contempt
that's bringing me down!
I'm burning with contempt
that's bringing me down!

AS OF NOW
I AM A TOOL
OF SEVERE IMPACT
HAMMER DOWN
CAUSE AND EFFECT
AND CREATE A NEW WORLD!
