Echoes of innocence
Distant and obsolete
Crying for a saviour
Crying inside prayer
No more no more
Echoes of innocence
Echoes of innocence
Burning away the shade
Where babies were born and played
In the corporate eyes
The murdering machines
Eroding their destruction
Seeding their hate
Slowly killing indians
As they burn their sacred place
Opress, depress
Famine, asphyxiation
No air to breathe
Buried without a name
As they spread disease
Its all the same
