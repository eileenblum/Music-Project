Who was the man, that some feared
That some believed?
He was the man that would save them
From the stifling hands of terror?
Hatred was confused by lies
Was his own entity, was his own destiny
Dragged through the streets
Crucifix, humilation
Was his own entity, was his own destiny
Betraying laws of mankind
So death come in the night
Why did the father not save his son?
