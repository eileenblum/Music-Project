Skin
Your scars
Surface is
Rusty blades

Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out

Oblivion
Your weakness
Is your temper
Is your temper

Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out

Your god
High above
In your veins
Liquid sky

Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out

Immortal
Your savior
Destroys you
Destroys you

Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
Self-immolation crying out
