Hey soldier, do you knows who's in command here?
Hey soldier, do you knows who's in command here?
Motherfucker
Hey soldier, do you knows who's in command here?
Motherfucker, motherfucker, motherfucker

You that I despite
Repentance of sorts
Death comes naturally
Not from a hated war
Repentance
Repentance of faith
Repentance of hope
Repentance of hate

[Chorus:]
Not my war
Soldiers marching on
Not my war
Soldiers marching on

On your feet!
Crisis at hand
On your feet soldier!
Crisis at hand
On your feet soldier
On your feet motherfucker!

Not my war
Soldiers marching on
Not my war
Soldiers marching on

Crisis
Crisis
Crisis

This is my rifle, there are many like it but this one is mine
My rifle is my best friend, it is my life
I must master it as I must master my life
Without me my rifle is useless, without my rifle I am useless

Not my war
Soldiers marching on
Not my war
Soldiers marching on

Crisis
Crisis
Crisis
Crisis
