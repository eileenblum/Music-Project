Breaking out
This stifled room
A jail cell,
A steel tomb

To see the light
My mere existence
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness

Jurors hate criminal minds
They're making dates for killing time
Breaking out this stifled room
A jail cell, a steel tomb
One has to fight
For dissension
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness

Wasted life, tasted
Wasted life, tasted

Wasted life, tasted
Wasted life, tasted

Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!

So, let me die
(I want more life, fucker*)
So, let me die
(I want more life, fucker*)

Wasted life, tasted
Wasted life, tasted

One has to fight
For dissension
God's kill in sight
Confined in madness
Jurors hate criminal minds
They're making dates for killing time

I want more life, fucker*

[* a quote from "Blade Runner" film.]
