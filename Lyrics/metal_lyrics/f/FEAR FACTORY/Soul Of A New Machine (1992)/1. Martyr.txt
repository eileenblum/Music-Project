What I thought was life
Came to an end
Born into a world
I never asked for this

I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away!

Born into hardship
A world of destruction
Suffer, bastard
Suffer, bastard

I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away!

Take me to heaven
Adorn me with wings
Suffer, bastard
I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away!

Suffer, bastard [11x]

What I thought was life
Came to an end
Born into a world
I never asked for this

I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away

Born into hardship
A world of destruction
Suffer, bastard
Suffer, bastard

I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away

I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away
I've got to get away
