Desecrate the vows within
Sanctify all your fears
Desecrate the holy church
Desecrate

Fill the abyss
With your hatred
Slaughter my child
Before your eyes
Fill the abyss
With your hatred
Slaughter my child

Desecrate the vows within
Sanctify all your fears
Desecrate the holy church
Desecrate

Fill the abyss
With your hatred
Slaughter my child
Before your eyes
Fill the abyss
With your hatred
Slaughter my child

Thy will be done
On Earth as it is in heaven
Drink his blood like wine
Taste his body like bread

He's not my god
He's not my god
He's not my god

Thy will be done
On Earth as it is in heaven
Drink his blood like wine
Taste his body like bread

He's not my god
He's not my god
He's not my god
He's not my god
He's not my god

Not my god!
Desecrate!
Not my god!
Desecrate!
