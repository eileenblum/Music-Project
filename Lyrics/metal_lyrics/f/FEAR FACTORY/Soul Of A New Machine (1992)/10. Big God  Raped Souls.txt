In America today, every 25 fucking seconds someone is viciously raped, someone is brutally violated; 250 times a day someone is murdered, someone's life is taken in America.
This is America, this is America, and I love America, I love America!

[Big God]

No remorse for the pain
Look into the eyes of death
Strong man cannot endure
Big god of this Earth

Liar!
Big god, no god!

Take back this life
Give back the world
"Woe to you of Earth and sea"
Big god will always be

Liar!
Big god, no god!
Burn!

[Raped Souls]

God raped souls of our lives
Hammers crush all our lives
Just like clockwork
They'll crush our lives
