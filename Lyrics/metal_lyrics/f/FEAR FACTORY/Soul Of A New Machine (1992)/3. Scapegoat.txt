Judges have decimated
Meanings of our laws
Already guilt?
Something has a flow

Wrongly accused
Blindly confused
Open your eyes
Try to realize

Don't you know,
You can't see
Too damn blind
To judge me

Blindly confused
Open your eyes
Try to realize

Don't you know,
You can't see
Too damn blind
To judge me

Laws are meant to follow
But they've mislead you
Conceal their meanings
So, they can suit you

Misjudged by the system
No one ever knows
Add injury to insult
No one ever knows

All of us
No one
No one knows

No one
No one
No one knows
