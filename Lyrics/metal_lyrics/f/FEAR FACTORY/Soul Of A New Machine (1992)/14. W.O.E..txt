Caught beneath visions of hatred
Drowning fast in sounds of silence
Caught between divisions of hate
Can't breathe under this weight of existence

Too strong,
Too strong for you
Too strong,
Too strong for you

Caught beneath visions of hatred
Drowning fast in sounds of silence
Caught between divisions of hate
Can't breathe under this weight of existence

Too strong,
Too strong for you
Too strong,
Too strong for you

Drowning, drowning, drowning, drowning

Drowning, drowning, drowning, drowning

Caught beneath visions of hatred
Drowning fast in sounds of silence
Caught between divisions of hate
Can't breathe under this weight of existence

Too strong,
Too strong for you
Too strong,
Too strong for you
