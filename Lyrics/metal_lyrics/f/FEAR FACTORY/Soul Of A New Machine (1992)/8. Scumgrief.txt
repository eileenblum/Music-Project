Cry, cry, cry, cry

Wires around your arms
Like wires around your head
A crucifix of me
Above your bed

I've seen your wounds
That you can't hide
You bleed well
When I cry

Cry, cry, cry
Scumgrief, scumgrief
Scumgrief, scumgrief

Smell the rats of deviance
Coursing through your veins
Rotting faith in your self
Confined alone to decay

I've seen your wounds
That you can't hide
You bleed well
With the rat inside

Smell the rats of deviance
Coursing through your veins
Rotting faith in your self
Confined alone to decay

I've seen your wounds
That you can't hide
You bleed well
With the rat inside

Cry, cry, cry
Scumgrief, scumgrief
Scumgrief, scumgrief
Scumgrief
