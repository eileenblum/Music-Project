This lonely isolation
Follows me through my dreams
I wander around with doubt
So cold and incomplete
There is nothing here for comfort
No spark of hope I see
I breathe deep and fill my lungs
To silently release

An echo

This is more than a dream to me
I breathe deep and drown my lungs
And release silently
I gasp for breath to only hear
What's inside me

An echo
More than a dream to me
An echo of my scream

I gasp for breath to only hear

An echo
More than a dream to me
An echo of my scream
