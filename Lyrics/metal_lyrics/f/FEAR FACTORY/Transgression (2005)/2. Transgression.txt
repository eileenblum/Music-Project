One nation, One nation of gods
Divided by faith.
A nation is divided by faith

Witness, Deliberate, War, Of attrition
Witness, Deliberate, War, Of attrition

Judge me not, judge me less you be judged
Eyes are blind, blinded by violation.

I hate your contention
I hate your violation
I hate your corruption
I hate your life destruction

I am your ENEMY!

Witness, Deliberate, War, Of attrition
Kill my mind, my mind is the weapon
Words are banned, these words meant to enlighten

I hate your contention
I hate your violation
I hate your corruption
I hate your life Destruction

I am your, ENEMY!
I will resist, ENDLESSLY!
