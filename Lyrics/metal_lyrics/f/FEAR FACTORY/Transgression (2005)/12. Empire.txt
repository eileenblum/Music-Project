Faceless, worshipping eyes full of doubt
Crushing rock standards in the state of the church
Show us how to suffer and lead us to death
Contrition of condition in the empire
Tolerance isn't a critical face
Moral excess is the cross we bare
Show us all your reasons behind all your lies
Yours is not to question the empire
Look at this world
( Empire! Empire! )
Where we live
( Empire of war! )
How can we ever forgive?
( Empire of hate! Empire of lies! )
Millions of souls in famish decay
Social empathy is rare these days
Show us all the hungry despair in their eyes
Show us the reflection of the empire
Look at this world
( Empire! Empire! )
Where we live
( Empire of gods! )
How can we ever forgive?
( Empire of church! empire of faith! )
Yours is not to question why
Yours is but to do or die
Yours is not to question why
Yours is not to question why
Yours is but to do or die
Yours is not to question why
Yours is but to do or DIE... !!!
Look at this world
( Empire! Empire! )
Where we live
( Empire of world! )
How can we ever forgive?
( Empire of rape! Empire of jail! )
Look at this world
( Empire of war! Empire of states! )
Where we live
( Empire of lies! Empire of hate! )
How can we ever forgive?
( Empire of gods! Empire of church! )
( Empire of lies! Empire of faith!... )
