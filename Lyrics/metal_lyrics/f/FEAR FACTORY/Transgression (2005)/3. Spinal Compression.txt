Like the knife into my back, Cold hate within my spine
Freezing up my nerves, This slow death consumes my mind
Shock waves through my soul, Compounding my fears
This depression on my life, My dead weight through the years

I'm going to BREAK!

I've had all that I can take, Endurance wearing thin
Everything that's on my mind, Will crush my soul within
My feet sink into the ground, Embeds my roots of fate
Coursing through my blood vessels, Reality of hate

Crushed by this fate, Under this weight, Crushed by this fate
Under this weight, I'm going to break, because I've had all that I can
TAKE!

Stop this pressure, weighing down on me
Please! Stop this pressure, weighing down on me

Buried to my neck in waste, Debris of life itself
World spinning out of control, I feel like I'm in hell
Something's got to change, Something's got to give
Existential weight on mind, Is not my way to live

Crushed by this fate, Under this Weight, Crushed by this fate,
Under this weight, I'm going to break, because I've had all that I can
TAKE!

Stop this pressure, weighing down on me
Please! Stop this pressure, weighing down on me
