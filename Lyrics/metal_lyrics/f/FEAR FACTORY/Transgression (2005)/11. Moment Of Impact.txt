Falling through the sky, And I have lost all track of time
Every image of my life, Flashes before my eyes
Knowing the precise time, Of my own demise
Saved prayers of circumstance, have recently expired

I, Pray, In, Spite, My, Soul, My LIFE

Straining every muscle, For my contact with fate
I could never dream, My life would end this way
Cross my heart and hope to die, Fade to the black
Brace myself, the time is now, The moment of impact

I, Pray, In, Spite, My, Soul, My, Life
My cries, won't hide, I pray, In spite
My fears of impending doom that I'm about to DIE!

Brace for, The shock, And trauma
Brace myself for the impact

I can hardly breathe, I can hardly breathe
...Cause I am chocking out this deathly SCREAM!

Brace for, The shock, And trauma
Brace myself for the impact
