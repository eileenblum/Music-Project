Witness a blinding flash, Sudden bright light from a blast.
Pulsing radiation, moving through cracks under skin.
Feel the fire in the wind, Deadly kiss of scorching sands.

Not a prayer of hope, Or redemption in your eyes.
Hell exploded on this earth, To take all that's alive.
Standing at the face of death, Terror stealing your last breath.

Watch the firestorm, Incinerate you into ash!

All that you know burns away into dust
So many Lives
So many Innocent

Burn!

Every particle returns, To it's natural form
Ashes into ashes, Blown away just like the dust
Heaven burning in the sky, Hell is not the reason why.

Feel the firestorm, Melting your spirit into glass!

All that you know burns away into dust
So many Lives
So many Innocent

Burn!
