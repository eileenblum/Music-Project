An ever changing world, Ever changing me
Reveals new pathways, For my soul to see
A light so bright, In your eyes
Casting off shadows, That darken your mind

Shining brighter than the sun
Blinding every eye at once
Fire's burning inside me
Burning light of all to see
(To shine brighter, To shine brighter)

A storm will rage, Fade to end before the dawn
A star blazes bright, Before the end is come
A light so bright, In your life
Casting off shadows, enshrouding your eyes

Shining brighter than the sun
Blinding every eye at once
Fire's burning inside me
Burning light of all to see
(To shine brighter than the sun, To shine brighter than the sun)

Supernova!

An ever changing world, Ever changing me
Reveals new pathways, For my soul to see
Everlasting

Shining brighter than the sun
Blinding every eye at once
Fire's burning inside me
Burning light of all to see
(To shine brighter than the sun, To shine brighter than the sun)

Supernova!
