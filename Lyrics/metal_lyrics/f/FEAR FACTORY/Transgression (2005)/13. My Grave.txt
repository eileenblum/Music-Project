[Secret bonus track]

My Grave [x3]
Scream in pain
Die in flames [x3]
Lost in darkness
God forgotten
Run in fear so you can hide
In the dark
Run in fear so you can hide
Forever
Hoping beyond my grave
My grave [x3]
Running to hide
Closing your eyes
Run in fear so you can hide [x3]
Run in fear closing your eyes
Hoping beyond
Hoping I can see beyond my grave
My grave [x7]

[in background:]
Hoping... beyond... hoping I can see.. beyond my...

Beyond my grave
My grave [x7]
