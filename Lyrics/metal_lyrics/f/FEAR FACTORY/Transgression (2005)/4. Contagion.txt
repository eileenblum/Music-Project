A man held hostage, by this contagion
Alone, abandoned, in search of legion
Under pressure, under black skies
We must find the cure, before we die
I can see the bullets rip, inside the crossfire
My suicide run through, the razor wire

All must endure
We will not live forever

Terror awaits me, at every turn
Honor is stronger, we fight all at once
Hate spreads like wildfire, in foreign lands
Incurable pain is this, gun in my hand

All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
We will not live forever
All must endure
For the mercy of one.
