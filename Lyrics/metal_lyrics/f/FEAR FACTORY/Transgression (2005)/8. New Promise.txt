Understand that
I will keep safe from every scar that bleeds
I will keep you free from all that's hurting me
This I promise

I Promise!

One more time, This I swear
Trust in me, My faith is sincere

Love is stronger when the end is near
Then there will be nothing more to fear

I Promise!

Trust in these, Love, life, hands
You need me, To help you stand

I can release you, from your pain, dear
Then there will be nothing more to fear
I promise this, I promise this, I promise this

Love is stronger when the end is near
I can release you from your pain, dear

Understand

I Promise!
