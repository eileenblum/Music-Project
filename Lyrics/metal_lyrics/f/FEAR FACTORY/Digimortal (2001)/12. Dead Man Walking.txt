[bonus track]

All of you here that are secretly dead
Just lifeless shells, consumed and bled
Oblivious to reason and you are blind
Follow the trends to share a single mind

You are so blind to the lie

I can see into the void of you mind
Hiding behind eyes of black
A dead man I will find

Kneel to the savior who really cares less
His holy eyes fill you with fear and dread
Obey those rules from ancient history
Forgotten words that mean nothing to me

You are so blind to the lie

I can see into the void of you mind
Hiding behind eyes of black
A dead man I will find
