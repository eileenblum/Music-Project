after the smoke clears
and the flames subside 
(we have been forsaken...) 

a thousand eyes were upon me 
soulless, and without mind 
(we have been forsaken...) 

will there never be an end?

if i could be forgiven 
every breath would be a prayer
(we are not forgiven...) 

will there never be an end? 

i have tread, and spanned the horizon 
i've seen this world, the beauty in decay
i strike down the faceless and unknown 
i feel blessed, for i can see 
the stars look down on me... 

will there never be an end? 

as the stars look down on me...
