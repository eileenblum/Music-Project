Your Life no longer has any value
Let them tell you what your own life is worth
There is no compassion as life fades away
This self deliverance the choice you have made
Contemplate your last breath
As you see the face of death
Contemplate your last breath
Breath, slowly breath
Goodbye
The pain in your life I cannot perceive
Crimes of humanity I see and believe
Contemplate your last breath
As you see the face of death
Contemplate your last breath
Breath, slowly breath
Goodbye
Like the knife that cuts through me
Stabbing uncertainty
It bleeds my life I know
Draining my heart my soul...
Contemplate your last breath
Breath, slowly breath
Goodbye
Goodbye
