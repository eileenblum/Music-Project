All you are
I have made
All that I wanted
I gave to you
I have no sympathy
I show no mercy
All that I hated
I placed in you
I wait for the time
Your time to kill
All you are
I have made
The conflict is pure
The truth devised
The future secured
The enemy designed
Pure, hate, kill
All you are
I have made
