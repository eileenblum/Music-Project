Destroying lives of innocence, collateral dissonance
Malignant depravity
Faith based mob and their mentality
Bodies were falling, burning and screaming
Buildings collapsing, disintegrating
Hellfire scorching, blinding the sky
Descending like rain
You will believe this blood sacrifice
Life was the price for change
All to kill, dominate
All to kill, for control
A false flag conceals truth to sacrifice chosen few
Destruction, conspiracy,
An inside job done with efficiency
Bodies were falling, burning and screaming
Buildings collapsing, disintegrating
Hellfire scorching, blinding the sky
Descending like rain
You will believe this blood sacrifice
Life was the price for change
All to kill, dominate
All to kill, for control
Our fate lies in the hands of men
Their lies, our fate, our lives, the grave
A master plan of damnation
A controlled demolition
Hellfire scorching, blinding the sky
Descending like rain
You will believe this blood sacrifice
Life was the price for change
Our blood forever stained on the street
Blood can't be washed away
All to kill, dominate
All to kill, for control
