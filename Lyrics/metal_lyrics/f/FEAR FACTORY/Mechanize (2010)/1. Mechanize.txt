Slave to the industry, faceless in the machine
You do not realize you're dehumanized
You cannot survive, unless you comply
I built it to break it down
We become mechanized
Dawn of our extinction, the human affliction
Friction and the resistance, our sole existence
The future's distant, we can't break free
I built it to break it down
We become mechanized
All Lives are condemned
Thoughtless and automated, lifeless and sedated
You're integrated, your mind castrated
Humiliated, too late to escape
I built it to break it down
We become mechanized
