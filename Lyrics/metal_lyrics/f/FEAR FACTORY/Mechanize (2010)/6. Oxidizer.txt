The smallest part, a single spark
Can leave this world in ashes
The fire inside, burns my mind
And set to destroy the masses
Consuming tide, floods my mind
Filling my soul with rage
Just one spark in my heart
To damn this world flames
My burning fate seething with hate
To set this world a fire
All will burn, nothing spared
From my incineration
Decimate, to devastate
Path of annihilation
My burning fate seething with hate
To set this world a fire
Set this world on fire
Wake of the Oxidizer
