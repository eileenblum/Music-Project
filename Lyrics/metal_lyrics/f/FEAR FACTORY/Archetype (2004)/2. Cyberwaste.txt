Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
Fuck you

Speak your worthless point of view
A cog in the machine
Your damn words are straight up lies
Continue to deceive

Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of me
Nothing you say matters to us
Nothing you say matters to us
Fuck you

Sow your seeds of ignorance
You cyberparasite
Seems you'll, say most anything to stab
Me with your lies

You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of me

Reap what you sow
Your words are shit

You are a virus spreading disease
Your life is so sad spreading lies of me

Assume that you know my thoughts
(All I want to do is see)
Infect me with your disease
(Tapping away on the keys)
Change your face in front of me
(Safe behind the cyberscreen)
Wishing that you knew the truth
(All I know is what I read)

Nothing you say matters to us
