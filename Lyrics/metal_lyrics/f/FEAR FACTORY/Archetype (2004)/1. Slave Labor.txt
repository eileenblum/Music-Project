My chains are paper thin, and they're welded with ink
Sealed inside a legal trap, so tight blood don't leak
A contract with a devil, for a life of disdain
See me in the limelight, an indentured slave!

I blame myself

God, help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour this gas on me

God help me pour this gas on me [x4]

Chock another product for the mass to consume
The flocks of mindless sheep that have corporately groomed
Ignorance through apathy, like drones in the hive
A slave on the prayer wheel in conformed disguise

I blame myself

God, help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour this gas on me

I sold my soul [x11]

God, help me pour this gas on me
I need to drown in flames to be free
Help me pour this gas on me
Help me pour, this gas on me

God help me pour this gas on me [x4]
