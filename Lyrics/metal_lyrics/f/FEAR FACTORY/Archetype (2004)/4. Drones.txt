You waste away
A spinning cage
Rats blinded by the sun

You spend your days
Stuck in that race
And life has just begun

In paradise there's ill neglect
And lives are lost in full distress
The wage of sin is money spent
Your life undone full of regret

We are lost in the maze
Falling away

And now your life
Amounts to nothing
The fortune has a price

'Cause in the end
All humans die
A dead drone in the hive

In paradise there's ill neglect
And lives are lost in full distress
The weight of sin is memory spent
Your life undone full of regret

We are lost in the maze
Falling away

Falling away again... [x4]
(again)

Lost in the maze,
Falling away

Falling away again [x4]
