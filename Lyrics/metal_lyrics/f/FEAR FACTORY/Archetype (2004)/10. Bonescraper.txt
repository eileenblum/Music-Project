There is no future for us to suture
Your life ill fated, beat down and hated
Shot in the head, walking undead
Numb to the world, around your head
RIP my skin from my bones, I won't bleed
RIP my heart from my chest , I won't scream

Hide in the shadows, deep black, and hollow
Empty void of light cuts slean, like a knife
Damaged and torn, punctured by thorns
I've felt nothing since I was born
RIP my skin from my bones, I won't bleed
RIP my heart from my chest , I won't scream

My Flesh - You Flesh
You Eyes - My Sight
My Pain - Your Shame
We are the same...
RIP my skin from my bones, I won't bleed
RIP my heart from my chest , I won't scream
RIP my skin...
