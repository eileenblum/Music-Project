I see times pass by and fly
Night after night I see myself cry
Trying to reach you and to be near to you
To have a home in the world
I wish it doesn't hurt to call out your name

Can you tell me where I am
And which direction I go
'Cos sometimes I fell I'm lost in the void
Deep inside of me there's a heaven I know
But this time I fear the direction I go

Not always there but everywhere I ride
You are by my side 'cos noone can die
Who touched your life

Can you tell me where I am
And which direction I go
'Cos sometimes I fell I'm lost in the void
Deep inside of me there's a heaven I know
But this time I fear the direction I go
