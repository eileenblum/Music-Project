[Saviour:]
Walking through the desert of a strange land
Repulsive creatures at my side
Invisible dangers border my way
The horizon shows the mountains of freedom
I'm flying through the space of time
But I don't know if I will find my way

I search, search but cannot find the way out of the mist
I search, search but cannot find the end of my quest

[Wizard Queen &amp; Saviour:]
We search, search but cannot find the way out of the mist
We search, search but cannot find the end of our quest

[Saviour:]
I search for a place inside of me
A place I hope and expect to find
I'm sure it is in me but I don't know what it is

[Choirs:]
The island of dreams and hope
[Saviour:]
A place everybody carries inside
[Choirs:]
The island of dreams and hope
[Saviour:]
A place where we all, we all can be free

[Wizard Queen &amp; Saviour:]
Wishes and fears inside of me...

[Saviour:]
I see a bottomless pit
A neverending tunnel
A room without a door
And a blinding flash light

I climb up the mountains of wishes and fears
But the peak is hidden in the mist
I cannot see the aim of my search, it is so far away
I'm flying through space and time
But I don't know if I will find my way

[Wizard Queen &amp; Saviour:]
Where shall we go, I see a light it's faraway
What shall we do
Where is the end, it seems so far
But it is so near, look at yourself and see

[Saviour:]
I look inside myself and see a place I searched to reach
The powers inside of me are strong enough to go on

[Choirs:]
The island of dreams and hope
[Saviour:]
A place everybody carries inside
[Choirs:]
The island of dreams and hope
[Saviour:]
A place where we all, we all can be free

The island of dreams and hope
The island of dreams and hope
The island of dreams and hope
