[Saviour:]
In the darkness of the void there will be nothing but fear
Have to leave now but where to go
There is no light on my way
In the mirror of my soul reflecting eyes of the damned
They are believers of the unkown
Their tortured souls cry for help
for me to leave the temple again

I lead the armies of the lost ones to the gates
There we will stand when the final battle will take place
A last prayer to the Gods 'let this not be my end'
But now I see the phantom...

[Wizard Queen:]
Ohohohohoh...
Take this curse from me
That I can leave, that I can spread my wings again
Forever to be free

[Choirs:]
Take this curse from all
That I can leave, break the seal forever
Break it to be free again

[Saviour:]
Temple of fear, temple of fear got my soul...

In the darkness of the void thgere's nothing but fear
I have to leave now before the end is near

As I hold my prayer to the Gods 'let this not be my end'
But now I see the phantom of the lord
