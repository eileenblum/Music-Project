[Saviour:]
She is calling the black winds of the night

[Choirs:]
We're riding on through forests, her the saviour by our side

[Saviour:]
Her spirit is unseen but we know her time is near

[Choirs:]
In visions we are seeing that the King will disappear

[Saviour:]
She is the leader through the darkness of our lives

[Choirs:]
She is the keeper of love

[Saviour:]
Living in the circles of the Queen makes you survive
And when you die, she will be near

Now we are hearing the last call of the King
A ruler in the past, then the destroyer of the Queen
He had locked our souls within his mighty hands of steel
We're riding on to break his powers, break his magic seal

She is the leader...

[Choirs:]
We see her mighty shadow covering the moon
The wolves are howling, deepest night has come to bring her crown
She will take our souls but she'll be bringing us the light
Waving with her hand she wakes the fires in the sky

[Saviour:]
She is our leader, she is the keeper of love
Living in the circles of the Queen makes you survive
And when you die, she will be near
