[King:]
Straight out of hell I will come from below
I conquer the world, destroy all you've known
Fear is my friend and hate is my love
I torture your soul, there's no help from above
The desrt is mine, the earth my desire
Send deadly beams to set you on fire
Kill all you've got, destroy all your lives
Fill you with space and the whole human race

[Choirs:]
He is the lonely ruler and master of the world
He holds the dead of ages in his hands
Fear his name, fear his hate, fear his revenge
His mighty realm of steel is here and will never die

[King:]
Finally I know what lies beneath you
Manipulate you, so you believe too
Finding my way into your hiding places
Fumigate you but you think I'm not here

[Choirs:]
He is the lonely ruler and master of the world
He holds the dead of ages in his hands
Fear his name, fear his hate, fear his revenge
His mighty realm of steel is here and will never die

[King:]
I am here to rule the world enslave them all
None escape to freedom
I am the king of the Court and when I die I will return

[Choirs:]
He is here to rule the world enslaves us all
None escape to freedom
He is the king of the Court and when he dies he will return

[King:]
I ride to the skies above 'cos the black sun is my fate
There I have to seek for the sources of my hate
But no priest or demon's eye will help me, it's too late
There are my doubts and fears that force me to my knees
In every turn of being "me" I hunt my enemies
My evil heart is bleeding but there's nothing to give me what I need

[Wizard Queen:]
Remember your last day will come
You fallen angel of the sun
Break my chains before it will be done. Ahhh...

[Choirs:]
He is the lonely ruler and master of the world
He holds the dead of ages in his hands
Fear his name, fear his hate, fear his revenge
His mighty realm of steel is here and will never die

[King:]
I am here to rule the world enslave them all
None escape to freedom
I am the king of the Court and when I die I will return

[Choirs:]
He is here to rule the world enslaves us all
None escape to freedom
He is the king of the Court and when he dies he will return
We are here to rule the world enslave us all
None escape to freedom
We're the kings of the Court

[King:]
And when I die I will return
