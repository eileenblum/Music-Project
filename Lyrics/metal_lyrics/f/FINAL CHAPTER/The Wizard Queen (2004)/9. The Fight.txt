[King:]
Silent is the night, I'm full of raging delight
Awaiting the saviour tonight
Demons and priests are fighting at my side
They shall take the saviour alive
Riding through the sky
All my slaves are ready for the final fight
All those who do not know what it means
Shall come to see me rise

[Choirs:]
All alone in the place of the evil dome
He was taken to  to the throne of the faceless one
He shall come to save us from our disgrace
But now he's taken to this place from where noone returns

[King:]
After all he's there to face me, to face me eye to eye
No use to beg for mercy, there is only one who has to die

[Choirs:]
The saviour had no chance dusty
His brilliance betrayed by the ones he wants to free
Forever he is gone beyond the realms of death
And dawn he will never come back to the world

[Elf:]
If you will meet him on your way to the other side of our lives
Touch his hand to say goodbye

[Old man:]
And as the saviour died shattered by the might of the king
She cried out the tears and her tears were like tears of a mother
Who is crying for his fallen son
