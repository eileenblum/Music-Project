[Saviour:]
I was born into the world
I'm a child don't know what I will be when I'm old
Tears I have cried thousands of tears
But I know it is the only way to aswer the pain
Sometimes I think my loneliness is just an old friend
Met him in my old life before
Lovely old friend, lovely old friend who will come when you are gone
Who will be with me if not you

[Wizard Queen:]
I see the world look up to you
Take your hand, feel the life that is in you
Don't know who you are, don't know where you are going to
But you seem to be someone
who really loves the ones who cannot love
