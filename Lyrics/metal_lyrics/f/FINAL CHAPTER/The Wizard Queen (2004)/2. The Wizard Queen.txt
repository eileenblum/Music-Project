She's a woman
She got wisdom and magic
And she's never leaving the night
If you dare to look in her wild flashing eyes
You feel what it means to be free

She's riding the black wind
Controlling the wolves
Turning the night into fire
The dead and the living are under her spell
There is no escape from her call

'Cos She's a Wizard Queen
I'm forever damned in her claws
She's a Wizard Queen
Since she's taken me under control

For such a long time
I've been longing to ride
With a Queen of my dreams side by side
I saddled my horse
I polished my sword
To join with her armies of night

I'm laying my heart forever in your hands
I'm swearing my loly oath on steel
In drinking the blood you gave to me
I'm leaving the whole world behind

You're a Wizard Queen
I'm forever damned in her claws
You're a Wizard Queen
Since you are taken me under control

You're the one I need to be free
You are the one who knows what's inside me
You're the star that has been shining through my life
I live and fight for you
I live and die for you

She's riding the black wind
Controlling the wolves
Turning the night into fire
The dead and the living are under her spell
There is no escape from her call

'Cos She's a Wizard Queen
I'm forever damned in her claws
She's a Wizard Queen
Since she's taken me under control

Riding up to the sky
Fall like thunder and fire
Riding, riding and riding again
