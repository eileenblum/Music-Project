[Music : A.Gori, lyrics : A.Amadori]

I'm leaving it all behind
Say farewell to you all
I found the ultimate place to carry on
I have been climbing up the ladders of business, of success
Only to find them leaning on wrong walls
Now I'll tear down these walls, no more disguise
To my true Eden I'm gonna fly
It's a place where the sun always shines
Check this out: tropical paradise!
Wild as a caveman
On a desert island
Fresh fruits and raw fish
Are my only worries
Slave to the sweet caress of the trade winds I'll be
I will dive headlong into the seas
Spend the rest of my days
Gazing at horizons blaze
White-sand visions, never-ending waves
Ripple crystal clear onto the sand
Glistening beach where a cooling shade awaits
To carry away all trace of this old pain
Where the tranquil waters draw the eye
Changing colours with the dazzling light
Come and check this out it ain't no lie
Join me in tropical paradise
We will count sand grains as daylight dies
Blowing conches like "Lord of the flies"!
