[Music and lyrics: A.Gori]

Back to the World War II in the far East
Sent to an island of the Philippines
With just one assignment
Never surrender, guard this place
With your own life, if it's the case
For the Great Empire of the Rising Sun
I will not surrender
I'll be strong
Your leaflets are cheating me
My doom and my destiny
Belong only to a victory
Hidden in the mountains for almost 30 years
Companions died soon, but I shed no tears
Leaflets announcing that the war is over
But I, mistrust you all
Keep on fighting alone
I will not surrender
I'll be strong
Your leaflets are cheating me.
My doom and my destiny
Belong only to a victory
I will be loyal to my Great Empire
I will fight until I'm dead
Yes, this is my destiny
Hold out for the last victory
My memories forgotten
Survive without fun
Live day by day
Half human and half beast
My life compromised
Just wait for the end
Wake me from this nightmare
'cause there ain't no peace for this freak
I mistrust you all
Keep on fighting alone
I will not surrender
I'll be strong
Your leaflets are cheating me.
My doom and my destiny
Belong only to a victory
I will be loyal to my Great Empire
I will fight until I'm dead
Yes, this is my destiny
Hold out for the last victory
