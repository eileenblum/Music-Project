[Music: A.Gori, F.Caccamo, lyrics: A.Amadori]

A messenger has travelled through time
He has come to warn about their next strike
Armed and dangerous fanatics are attacking
Let us greet these guys as they deserve
As Paris lights go out
The show is taking place tonight
Bring a loaded gun in guitar case
The concert's just begun
We'll be waiting
Just behind the scene of Bataclan
Be there, stick to your guns
Fight for your freedom now
Save your people from the slaughter
We will be ready
To waste them all
We'll clean the whole place up
And end their holy war
Don't be late, tonight is the night
We need everyone to fight these fools back
A couple spring rolls and a couple beers, then a glass of rum
Hey there fucking bastards, here we come
Be there, stick to your guns
Fight for your freedom now
Save your people from the slaughter
We will be ready
To waste them all
We'll clean the whole place up
And end their holy war
As Paris lights shine bright
The show will soon begin tonight
While our gun lays in our guitar case
The party's just begun
We are waiting
Standing here outside the Carillon
Be there, stick to your guns
Fight for your freedom now
Save your people from the slaughter
We will be ready
To waste them all
We'll clean the whole place up
And end their holy war
