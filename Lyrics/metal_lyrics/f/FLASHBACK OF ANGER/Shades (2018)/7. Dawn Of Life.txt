[Music and lyrics: A.Gori]

I can't stop gazing at your mother
Can't stop dreaming of you
Grow inside that sweet cradle
Sleep safe and sound
I'm here for you
And always will be
What am I supposed to feel?
I still don't know
But I will always love you
Caressing your mother's belly
I can feel you move
Listening to your feeble heartbeat
I can steal the groove
This dawn of life enlightens me
And like a fire consumes my dreams
'Cause reality is now transcending my fantasies
I'll learn to embrace every moment with you
Love you to the depths of my soul
Every time you'll fall down I will teach you
How to get up stronger than before
You, reset my whole existence
You, the shining star that brightens my darkest hour
You, will fill every silence
And you, will be the sweetest music I've ever heard
I can't stop gazing at your mother
Can't stop dreaming of you
Grow inside that sweet cradle
Sleep safe and sound
Caressing your mother's belly
I can feel you move
Listening to your feeble heartbeat
I can steal the groove
I'll learn to embrace every moment with you
Love you to the depths of my soul.
Every time you'll fall down I will teach you
How to get up stronger than before
You, reset my whole existence
You, the shining star that brightens my darkest hour
You, will fill every silence
'Cause you, will be the sweetest music
You, the greatest gift of my life
You, the living miracle that reminds me to rejoice
And I'll be lost in your eyes
Wishing to lose myself in you forever and a day
