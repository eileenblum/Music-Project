[Music and lyrics: A.Gori]

Walking down this lonely road all alone
Emptiness please, fill my dark thoughts
Listen to my prayer, I'm here to atone
Whispers of leaves, how I can get through
I can't live with this weight on my shoulders
I'm a lost soul in search for forgiveness
I shed all my tears since you passed away
Now I'm going astray again
And when I walk this lonely road I feel the wind
I know you are there embracing me forever
But we will meet again in heaven
I will wait the final day with you in my heart
Watch over me from the blue sky
Please restore in me, the lost taste of life
Walking down this lonely road now I see
Mindfulness is setting me free
And when I walk this lonely road I feel the wind
I know you are there embracing me forever
But we will meet again in heaven
I will wait the final day with you in my heart
Watch over me from the blue sky
Please restore in me, the lost taste of life
