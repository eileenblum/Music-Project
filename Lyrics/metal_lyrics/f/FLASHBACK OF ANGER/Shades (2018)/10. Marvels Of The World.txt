[Music: A.Gori, F.Caccamo, lyrics: A.Gori]

I'll tell you a story of liberty
Dear cellmate hear begin
The memories of a Venetian merchant in the far east
Through the lands, then back from the sea
15 thousand miles, more than 20 years far from home
Learning that mysterious world.
Just fifteen, raised by an uncle and aunt
Then my father returned and a new journey began
Heading for Cathay, to the Kublai Khan
Spices, gems, treasures unfold
My thirst for knowledge
Spread across those lands unknown
And I'll disclose them all
Marco Polo, his travels changed forever history
He inspired future travellers
To unveil the marvels of the world
We started that journey to fulfill Kublai Khan's requests,
The oil of the lamp in Jerusalem.
At his court he wanted also a hundred Christians to learn all the Seven Arts
Hard to survive, but we reached Dadu
Spices, gems, treasures unfold
My thirst for knowledge
Spread across those lands unknown
And I'll disclose them all
Marco Polo, his travels changed forever history
He inspired future travellers
To unveil the marvels of the world
Spices, gems, treasures unfold
My thirst for knowledge
Spread across those lands unknown
And I'll disclose them all
Marco Polo, hai cambiato il corso della storia
Ispirazione per l'umanitÃ 
A raggiungere ogni meta
