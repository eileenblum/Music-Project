[Music: A.Gori, F.Caccamo, lyrics: A.Gori]

I have found the way
To travel through time and space
I have seen technology
Make mankind disappear
Set free this world from fear
Our morbid thirst for knowledge turned upon us.
Our descendants will destroy the world as we know it
And human being are destined to a relentless extinction
Oh, there's no appeal, no second chance,
Emptiness surrounds us
Fly with your mind beyond the edge of dreams
'Cause everything is so damn real
It's the failure of rationality
Let fantasy prevail over it
Wars, exodus,
Culture walls,
Can't avoid the end
We are condemned
So don't run waiting for your doom
Fly with your mind beyond the edge of dreams
'Cause everything is so damn real
It's the failure of rationality
Let fantasy prevail over it
Better find a way to stop this before
We lose everything we care 'bout.
Better break the spell that surrounds this Earth,
But when you feel lost don't stop to,
Fly with your mind beyond the edge of dreams
'Cause everything is so damn real
It's the failure of rationality
Et fantasy prevail over it
Stop this endless quest for immortality
'Cause future is so damn unclear.
Remember you create your own destiny
So plan ahead, don't live in fear
