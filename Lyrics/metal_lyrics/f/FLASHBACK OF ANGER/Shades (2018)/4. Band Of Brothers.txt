[Music: A.Gori, lyrics: A.Amadori]

Through good times and through bad times we have lived
They'd hit my face but you would bleed for me
All for one and one for all: it's always been the way
And those who dared mess with us would never get away with it
Remember that time your girl broke out and swore
At two A.M. some knocks on my door
An hour later the four of us were hanging at my place
Drinking shouting, laughs to tears
We'd wait for dawn, heading for the beach
Until the very end
A band of brothers shall remain
Until the very end
Until the sky falls on our heads
John's a top model while Jack's lost his teeth
Jay is CEO of a tall company
I went from hell to stars and back so many times, I won't count
But with every string I break I know for sure you'll be here by me
Until the very end
A band of brothers shall remain
Until the very end
Always will be
Through the years
We will stand together as one
Luck comes and goes but friendship lasts
Strong as a rock when a storm comes
Most things in life are bound to change
Spare me this one to remain same
All for one and one for all: the only rule we know
Don't you mess up with my bros or else I will come after you
Until the very end
A band of brothers we shall remain
Until the very end
Forever and a day
Until the very end
A band of brothers we shall remain
Until the very end
Until the sky falls on our heads
Always together we will stand
