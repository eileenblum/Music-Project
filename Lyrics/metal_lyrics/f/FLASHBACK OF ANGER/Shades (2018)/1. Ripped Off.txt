[Music and lyrics: A.Gori]

Thinking 'bout gaining more than you deserve
You put your money on the stock exchange
All you have to do is to wait and believe
Your swag will increase
The graphs go down and rise again
This roller coaster makes you feel seasick
Yelling and crying and praying in vain
Won't help you save the day
Mind the gap, you'll fall into disgrace
Take the rest of your pride and
Run away from the evil master plan
You're going to be another ripped off man
It's a virtual world war
Where mine becomes yours
But they don't have the right to steal your dreams
If you want to change your life
Aiming always higher
Be sure you'll scrape the bottom of your soul
It's business and it's fake, it's out of control
Castles built in the air taking your blood toll
See the rich are getting richer
The poor are getting poorer
The middle class won't grow
And so the story goes
Don't fool yourself again
You might end up homeless
Remember this wise rule:
Enjoy your stay in this fragile vice den called Earth,
It could be Heaven, it could be Hell.
Don't give up the fight to stay alive,
Or you will be meat for these vulturous men
It's a virtual world war
Where mine becomes yours
But they don't have the right to steal your dreams
If you want to change your life
Aiming always higher
Be sure you'll scrape the bottom of your soul
Kicked out from home 'cause you lost your control
You gamble your last cents on a slot machine.
You win a fortune but you cannot stop
You're a breeding ground for this senseless greed
Money won is a lot sweeter
Than money earned with your sweat
But remember this wise rule,
Or you will
Be another puppet at their command,
And you will be another ripped off man
It's a virtual world war
Where mine becomes yours
But they don't have the right to steal your dreams
If you want to change your life
Aiming always higher
Be sure you'll scrape the bottom of your soul
