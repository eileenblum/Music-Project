[Music: A.Gori, F.Caccamo, lyrics: A.Gori]

It's a mess
I just realized that
I'm not a man
For the society
I am a code
A fucking number has control
Of everything I see
War victims
Are just numbers
Casualties
Other numbers
For the live feed
But very soon some commercials will make you
Completely forget them
I don't want to see
Bloody news today
Night, embrace me
Make me feel like a child again
Come take me to the place where no one cry
And all fears become laughing tears
Save me now
Like the ants,
We move in fixed lines
Everywhere
How long should we wait for
Chip implants?
The few will use us like
Marionettes in their hands
My bank account
Marked as invalid
My credit card
Has expired
My ID number
Non-existent, very soon they will
Completely forget me
So, in the end it seems
That I'm free today
Night, cover my escape
From a fate worse than death
Come take me to the place where no one cry
And all fears become laughing tears
Make me disappear
Numb
The anger with your gentle moonlight
Spread
Carefreeness on this condemned man
Save me now
Let all memories fade away
Let me fall astray
Give a chance for my rebirth
Make me child again
In this restful sleep
Night, set me free
You know what I mean
Take me to the unseen
I don't want to see
Bloody news today
Night, embrace me
Make me feel like a child again
Come take me to the place where no one cry
And all fears become laughing tears
Make me disappear
Numb
The anger with your gentle moonlight
Spread
Carefreeness on this condemned man
Save me now
