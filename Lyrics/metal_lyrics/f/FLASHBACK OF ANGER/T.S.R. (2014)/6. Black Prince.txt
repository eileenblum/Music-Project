[The storyteller:]
Listen my friend,
Here is a tale that has to be told
Whatever the form

Back to a time
When France and England
Were both engaged in a great war

Then lived a man that outstood them allâ¦
Still breathing through your history booksâ¦.

Edwardâs his name
known as the Black Prince
The Prince of Wales, heâs the Kingâs first son

At only sixteen
He was being knighted
Serving his arm for the right to the Crown

His unbelievable skills at war burst out
In the Norman campaign he showed what heâs worth

He came there crawling in
Heâs a shimmering soul on the field
He is the Prince wearing black
Finest blade of his time

[King Edward III:]
âFrom up here my son, you see,
Weâre bound to notice the arrival of the enemy

God give us the strength to fight
To take back what is ours
We shall never fail!â

[The storyteller:]
Then the French were defeated
Many more battles he would win
Before through the years

As if it was already written that he would never be King
All this glory and might, it just seemed so unreal

Here heading up
Pouring blood for the glory of England
Prince wearing black
Bravest knight of his land

There standing tall
Heâs awaiting his time to the throne
He is the Prince wearing black
Finest blade of his time
