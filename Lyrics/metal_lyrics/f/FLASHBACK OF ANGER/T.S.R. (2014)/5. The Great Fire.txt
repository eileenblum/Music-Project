[Music: A. Gori / lyrics: A. Amadori]

It was a peaceful night
And the moon was full
We were all asleep

Yet something wasnât right
That September 2, 1666

A fire begun in the house and the shop of our King Charlesâs baker in Pudding lane
Sparks from the burning home they fell on hay in the yard of the Star Inn at Fish Street Hill

The spreading flames from the inn
Set light to St. Margaret
The holy House of our Lord was on fire

It spread in waves to a warehouse where
Oil, spirits, hemp and hay were stored

Eight a.m., some six hours later, more or less
The Great Fire was halfway across London Bridge

I woke up to screams and shouting everywhere
Men came here in Seething Lane to call for me

By the time I reached for the tower
Three hundred houses were on fire

I realized disaster threatened London so I hurried off to the Court in Whitehall
With buckets, axes, ladders, squirts and fire hooks, and water from the river we fought the blaze

Everyone gave his own best
We had to build some fire breaks
And there was no other way than to pull down houses

We prayed our god to grant us strength
When our supplies became too scarce

There was so little time for action
So much to do to save our town

As we all thought it was over
The Fire was still threatening Westminster

The Duke of York prevented the disaster by ordering the destruction, of the paper house
Within five days, the fire had ravaged London, and devastation lasted, for many years
