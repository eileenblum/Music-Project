[Music &amp; lyrics: A. Gori. Based on a letter by Francesco Masini]

Sometimes itâs hard to realize
That all come and go in a blink of an eye
So I leave my light, my power, my silence
My love, my heart, my ashes, me!

Take me away
Wherever you may roam just hold
My portrait inside your thoughts

Donât let me fade
Like the smoke of pinewood
Donât let go the memory of me and you

Tonight I am asking
To that child inside me
Soul of mine
Where have you been all this time?

I leave the thousand
Stars of my thoughts
My smile, my tears
Falling down like stones
I leave my universe, my music
My poems never written
My death, my last will

Take me away
Wherever you may roam just hold
My portrait inside your thoughts

Donât let me fade
Like the smoke of pinewood
Donât let go the memory of me and you
