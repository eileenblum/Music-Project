[Music: A. Gori, G. Cercato / lyrics: A. Amadori]

Donât know the reason why Iâm here
Or whyâs that gun here in my hand
Did I survive âcause they tell us to?
Or to see your face if I can get through?

In times of peace you dried my tears
These days Iâd give so much to feel
Even a bit of sadness here in me
To wake the man sleeping in the beast

Here I go
Play my part:
Seek and kill and then run

Nothing but
Flesh and bones
And corpses all around

All of my days just look the same
As I go shooting men from behind without shame
I hear your voice like an angelâs cry reaching hell

Would you recognize me, the child pulling your dress?
Would you still love me, if I told you how much I killed?
Would you still teach me what life is?
Would you take me back to where we left?

Want to escape
(No, you must stay!)
Maybe youâll see another day

Iâll get away
(Youâll go nowhere!)
Itâs all so hellish because

All of my dreams are just the same
I see all of my victims and

I go insane, still Iâve made it, Iâm here and Iâm alive
You taught me love ân Iâm a killer, you wouldnât be proud
Youâd tell me off if you knew it
I am a soldier, but still your son.

Here I go
Play my part:
Seek and kill and then run

Nothing but
skin and bones
and corpses all around

Take me Home!
Shoot me down!
Get me out of this mess!

No you wonât
Go back home
Until war is over!

Now
Iâm in the game
Iâll have to play
But I will see you once again
While Iâm away
Donât you forget

What I was once: the child pulling your dress
Will you still love me if I tell you about all the mess?
Will you still teach me what Life is?
Please take me back to where I belong
