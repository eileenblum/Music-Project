[Music: A. Gori / lyrics: A. Amadori]

You forget your dreams
You give up your pride
For that woman here youâd fuck up your life
One day you awake
What was your mistake?
She has gone, she just flew away

Did you buy the moon
To get to her room?
Were you searching for what you read in books?
Hey my friend, wake up
Itâs another slut
And sheâs born to tear your heart away

Yes my dear, you might spend some years
Giving her your best, hiding all your fears
See, sometimes, nightmares come alive
So first, use your hand, then hear my advice:

There is no thing sheâll ever say or do, that canât turn to pain
Itâs a disease that saves your life, they call it gynophobia

Took it so little for you to be possessed
Remember it will take her even less to turn her back
Just as you thought you were touching heaven
Thatâs when you hit the ground
Donât you think there will be justice: thereâs just one loser
But donât forget

How many tears are you gonna cry before you learn?
Iâve had my share, Iâve seen so much you wouldnât bear

Hey bitch stay away from me
Maybe just one night or two we can meet
Then go find some other fool
This time itâs my will and no other rule

I forgot my dreams
I gave up my pride
For a woman, once, I fucked up my life
But now Iâm awake,
No more bad mistakes
No attempts to my happiness

Catch the stars to reach for her heart
When youâve done it once, then youâll know them all
I despise, I wonât pay the price
I say use your hand, then hear my advice:

There is no thing sheâll ever say or do, that canât turn to pain
Itâs a disease that saves your life, they call it gynophobia

There is no âyesâ that you can still hear today, that canât turn to ânoâ
I might be nuts but I feel fine, I just caught this gynophobia.
