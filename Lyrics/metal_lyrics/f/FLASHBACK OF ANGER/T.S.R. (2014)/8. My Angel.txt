[Music &amp; lyrics: A. Gori]

It was a cold and misty winterâs night
The first date at that cinema
It was so hard to look you in the eyes

A few days after I took you to that place
We walked together, but not hand in hand

The stars above us, but nothing shined as bright as your eyes
I tried to speak, but those words donât come easy
I was shy, so were you, my feelings were trapped in me

A sudden strength in my heart, let me tell you that our feelings
So desperately held, could really become something more, like a never ending love

You are my life, I canât live without you
I just wanna kiss you forever and you can trust in me
When I say that we are ready to live our lives as one

Iâll do everything for you, âcause youâre the most precious thing in this world
When I look into your eyes, my Heart starts to beat
As fast as He can

I dreamt every night I could call you âmy girlâ
And you were there, giving me a chance
Lost in your grace, I swore Iâd never go away

I canât explain what happened to me
It was like a river flowing

Like it goes to the sea, so my feelings became an ocean of love
when we first kissed. Something grew in me
Somethinâ I had never felt before

You must be true to your heart, you must believe in me
my never ending dream, Iâll be always with you,
I didnât believe in Heaven, but now I do cause

Iâve found an Angel, you give me new life
I just wanna kiss you forever and you can trust in me
When I say that we are ready to live our lives as one

Iâll do everything for you, âcause youâre the most precious thing in this world
When I look into your eyes, my Heart starts to beat
As fast as He can
