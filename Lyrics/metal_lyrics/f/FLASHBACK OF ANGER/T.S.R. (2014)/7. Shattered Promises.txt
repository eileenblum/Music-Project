[Music: A. Gori / lyrics: A. Amadori]

Staring at this blank wall
No tears in our eyes
Here we are
Although I had never thought
This day could ever come

Moments spent together
Are all that remain now
But every time I try to catch them
The feelingâs gone!

Weâve grown together all the way
Although we were not the same
Through all these years we have kept trying so hard
To reach each otherâs minds

Now time has come for us to part
Weâll keep a space inside our heart
And for the rest of all thatâs been
Weâll let it scatter in the wind

How can I stand the flashbacks
Overwhelming my eyes?
Iâll wait for this silence
To just swallow them all

Ever since the first day
Weâd started our building
Perfection did not seem so far to us
A reign of love and trust

Now itâs clear: foundations donât hold any more
It hurts so bad now that we feel its weight
Crunching our chests

Weâre killing each other, canât call the cops
Thereâs no damn law for the broken hearts
Shattered promises
Buried light years away

How can I stand the flashbacks
Overwhelming my eyes?
Iâll wait for this silence
To just swallow them all

Silence surrounding our shameful souls
Tongues paralyzed holding bitter words
Shattered promises
Buried somewhere

We gaze at each other, as daylight dies
Our choice is made and weâll pay its price

How can I stand the flashbacks
Overwhelming my eyes?
Iâll wait for this silence
To just swallow them all
