[Music &amp; lyrics: A. Gori]

Look around, what do I see?
Nothing that relieves me
Itâs just hypocrisy
Surrounding me
World is selling pain and greed
But who is paying for this?
The underclass demands
Its stolen dignity
Leaders at the expense of poor
Unpunished crimes of fools
Weâre living on the razor-edge of a tragic doom
Hopes die last
And you will hear my voice
Weâre heading for a new dawn of freedom
These idle days are over
And we will stand together as one
Money, fame and glory
Shadows of your mind
Drain your soul and make you believe
They are the new gods.
Life is in every second
You live without worries
So donât waste your time
And be proud of yourself

You will rise up from the ashes
Of your lazy past
You will live in every breath
This is my vision
Happiness to fly and share
youâll find in what you have
Your love, your skills, your friends
Will save you from this hell
Donât try to reach out for golden treasures
Iâm here to say
Money, fame and glory
Shadows of your mind
Drain your soul and make you believe
They are the new gods.
Life is in every second
You live without worries
So donât waste your time
And be proud of yourself
