[Music: A. Gori, G. Lotti / lyrics: A. Gori]

Lost in a maze of sadness
I wonder if Iâm the only one
Who feels the daily pressure
To be always judged, for what I have done

I canât sleep safe and sound, (no more!)
And all I do is bound (to fail!)
Get me out of this hell
This paralyzing spell

I wanted to fly
Reach for the stars
But my desires were just a big lie

Now here on my own
I can see the world
Spinning around me, out of control

Locked in this cage of madness
I want to break out and renew my life
Leave all my joys and sorrows
Release the beast Iâm hiding inside

I lie awake, (Iâm in a fix!)
I see myself (lost in a mist!)
Iâm feeling so sinful
I wonât play by the rules

I wanted to fly
Reach for the stars
But my desires were just a big lie

Now here on my own
I can see the world
Spinning around me, out of control

Suffocated by this power play
Iâm a soldier of fortune, but not insane

What can I do?
Will I go the distance
And will I give up my pride?

Forgive me son
But now I am part of the crime
What is wrong and what is right
It doesnât belong to me anymore âcause Iâm a

Masked demon,  now I choose my path
be a deathbringer or just a man

Suffocated by this power play
Iâm a soldier of fortune, but not insane
Masked demon,  now I choose my path
be a deathbringer or just a man
