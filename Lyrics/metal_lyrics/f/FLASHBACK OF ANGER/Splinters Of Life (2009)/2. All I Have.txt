[Music: Alberto Amadori, Alessio Gori; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

Times are hard these days for a man to live his life
Pass each step and never look behind
Many dreams gone lost
no chance to spread your wings
Cause this world won't leave them be

Struggle through life
Fight for your rights
Don't ever change your mind
You must be the best
Don't take a rest 'til the day you die

Now all I ask
Leave me live life and get lost
All I need
Make my errors and be free
All I want
Be alone and I'll get along
All I have
Is this life I will never share

Just one night you sit there looking at the sky
Wonder why you never realised
All those dreams you had you left alone to die
They're the reason you're alive

So I won't stay
I'll run away
Build these old dreams again
This life is mine
And I am seeking it back tonight

Now all I ask
Leave me live life and get lost
All I need
Make my errors and be free
All I want
Be alone and I'll get along
All I have
Is this life I will never share

*******

Now all I ask
Leave me live life and get lost
All I need
Make my errors and be free
All I want
Be alone and I'll get along
All I have
Is this life I will never share
