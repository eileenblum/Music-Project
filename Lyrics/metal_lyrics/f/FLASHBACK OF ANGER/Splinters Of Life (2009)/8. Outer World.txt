[Music: Alessio Gori; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

Back to what I'd forgotten
Back to outer world
So many words unspoken
Stories left untold

Behind the wall
Now unfold
All those things
That I had never seen
Even though
They've been here
All along

Back to what I'd forgotten
Back to outer world
Sun shines and I grow older
(I) Ask for nothing more
