[Music:Alessio Gori; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

Walking slowly through the park
I should have known it from the start
That my love grows with every step

I see a whole world in her smile
See my future in her eyes
Still I would burn it out for her

My life makes sense when she's here around
I'd feel lost without her
When I'm sad she'll sink me in her sweet embrace

Time runs so fast
There's so many things that won't last
But our love will never die
'til the stars shine
There's one for every night
I heard them say we are two of a kind
