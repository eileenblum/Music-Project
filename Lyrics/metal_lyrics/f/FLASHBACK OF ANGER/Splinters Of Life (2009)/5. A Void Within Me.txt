[Music: Alessio Gori; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

You walked away, the night blew off your traces
But scars you left they didn't go away
Long years gone by I still cannot take
It had to be this way
In my dreams we're still...

There in the wind
Hand in hand as we walked up the hill,
In the night I saw love shine so bright from your eyes
Tell me why nothing's right since you're gone
There's a void within me

Your heart was mine and we would last forever
That night you're gone, you've thrown it all away
You left my life so cold without light
A picture black and white
Because you stopped time...

Right there on the hill
As we watched falling stars in the wind
Hand in hand we would sit there and wait for the dawn
Now I know nothing will ever fill
You're the void within me

***

There on the hill
As we watched falling stars in the wind
Hand in hand we would sit there and wait for the dawn
Now I know nothing will ever fill
You're the void within me

This bloody void has swallowed me, it's over
I leave this game, I never should have played...
