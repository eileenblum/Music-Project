[Music: Alessio Gori; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

Lightning strikes the black sky
Wild screams in the night
I ride through the plains
Looking for you again
End is near
Time to pay back is here
You won't escape from my
Flashback of Anger
Destroy you forever

Now that your time has come I can see
What a strange dream is life meant to be
When you got nothing more to survive
I'll kill you tonight

What you took from me
I'll have it back from you
Now I'm here again
Nothing to fear my friend
Death strikes fast
Just a revenge for the past
Victim of mighty
Flashback of Anger
Your game is over

Now that your time has come I can see
What a strange dream is life meant to be
When you got nothing more to survive
I'll  kill you tonight

Now that all is said and done
The enemy is gone
My hatred fades away
I'd live another day
If only you were here
To wipe away my tears
I'll see you in the sun
Revenge is done

****

Flashback of Anger
Flashback of Anger

Now that your time has come I can see
What a strange dream is life meant to be
You got nothing more to survive
I'll kill you tonight
