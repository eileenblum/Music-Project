[Music: Alessio Gori; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

There's no way out of this maze
I'm living for those days
I'm trapped in there
Compelled to play again
Those scenes when I could still call me man

I do have the power to play twice...

Madness
Searching deeper and deeper in those memories
I know all of my answers are here in me...

Knew this game was dangerous but could I ever know
Memories would come back to me just like an horror show
Someone wake me up and tell me that this isn't true
This ain't no more what I lived, what I knew

Help this nightmare seems so real
The picture becomes clear
A shadow in her eyes
That's how I realise
My love was all in vain
Creation of my brain
Illusions dug this void
My world destroyed

*****

Splinters of life hidden deep inside
Here in my mind they've been all the time
I've been so blind
Chasing stars in the sky
In the end I find
It was all a giant lie

*****

Hey, there must be some mistake
Where is my girl my angel?
This one here is different indeed
An evil creature with no love for me

I had never  seen her be so drastic
Telling me I am hopeless and tragic
Always laughing at me
What the hell is this?!

Knew this game was dangerous but could I ever know
Memories would come back to me just like an horror show
Someone wake me up and tell me that this isn't true
This ain't no more what I lived, what I knew

Help this nightmare seems so real
The picture becomes clear
A shadow in her eyes
That's how I realise
My love was all in vain
Creation of my brain
Illusions dug this void
My world's destroyed âcause

Now I'm back there once again
Too late to understand
A flash runs through my eyes
That's how I realise
Theodora's never been
A monster's all I see
Illusions dug this void
My world destroyed.
