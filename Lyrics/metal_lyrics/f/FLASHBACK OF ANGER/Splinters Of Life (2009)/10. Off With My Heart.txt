[Music: Alessio Gori; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

I wish I couldn't remember
The time when all was so bright
I don't believe there is another way I can live

Pain was the damn reward
For all the good I've done
My heart can love for real
Now hate is all he can feel

How could you fill my soul with my hate?
Is this what I deserved?
I'm sick and tired of fighting with myself
I want to end this hell

Time has come to fight for my life
I never thought I'd have to escape from myself one day
Still it's so hard not to think of what life could have been with her love
I beg someone please tear off this heart from me.

It's so easy when you think
To be human means to be weak

****

And as I cross the highway of life
Trying to find the answers inside my brainwashed mind
I know there's a long way to go
But someday I'll find my path back home

****

Run far away once again
Life's a game that we all have to play
Just as best as we can
Play this game today
And there's no right way

Time has come to fight for my life
I never thought I'd have to escape from myself one day
Still it's so hard not to think of what life could have been with her love
I beg someone please tear off this heart from me.
