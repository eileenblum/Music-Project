[Music: Alessio Gori, Giulio Cercato; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

Far too many times as life went by you thought it would be forever
Far too many lies they've built for you to make sure you feel better

When you feel so cool don't you believe you can keep off the fire
Don't you ever think the morning light can save you from your nightmare

So, never go playing with your soul
Never go searching for some more
Reasons to suffer from the past
Make sure He doesn't find you

I might well be crazy but who's got the right to tell?
Do you think your mind is sane because you're not afraid?

****

Oh no He's back, back for me!
I never will rest in peace
He often comes with the dusk
Sometimes He's blown by the sun

But even through my darkest street
Never He will  take over me
You gave me strength and I'll stand 'til the end

****

Come and have a look at life through my own eyes you won't believe it
Come and take a trip inside this head of mine you'll taste some hell

Can you hear this voice I hear, it's telling me I might be evil
So alone since I was born, why can't I be like other people?

(Blind) Wish I could close that door inside
Trap Him forever to my pride
If only I could fight my demons
I'd give my life just for this day
