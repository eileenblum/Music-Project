[Music: Alessio Gori; Lyrics: Alberto Amadori]

(I) thought I had found the reason
And  I  was faced to treason
Can there ever be some certainties?

Although my soul is bleeding
Now my eyes are seeing
That there ain't no point in nothing in the end

There is no truth, no lie, the only thing that's real is what you feel
Life in itself is nothing but a kind of strange illusion

****

All in all
In this endless fall
Had the chance to see
What's behind all this
Neither void

****

Just a second after
Something's gone forever
You won't ever catch it: don't look back!

If life begun from something
Can it end with nothing?
Guess there ain't no point in asking in the end

There is no truth, no lie, the only thing that's real is what you feel
Life in itself is nothing but a kind of strange illusion

There is no truth or lie when all that you can touch will vanish
Take all your fears away and make the best of this illusion
