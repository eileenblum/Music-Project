Just standing in the road
You used to dream about
But there's no window you can find
To stay alive
No door to knock on left
Yet wings of yours are clipped
You realize to make it real
You can't stand tall

They do not recognize you more
Empty glances

[Chorus:]
They look at you askance
The sun is shining on
The sun is burning so bright
And cares about you making blind

No faces fell to dust
But eyes are blurred forever
You do not have daylight to see
You sold your life
You can't afford your sight
You can't afford your dreaming
Try going to obey the will
You won't stand tall

[Chorus 2x]
