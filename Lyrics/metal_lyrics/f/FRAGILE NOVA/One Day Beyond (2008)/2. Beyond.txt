I'm passing by
Forever I've gone
Beyond the way I've cut
No one to cry
No one to forget
Yet your reflections hurt

I thought I'd be
A winner of fame
No one to learn who will
You live in mind
You're crashing my dream
You'll always be on time

[Chorus:]
Your mirror has been broken
Your shadows stand in line
Prosperity's been spoken
I'm going to reply
Being far away from future
Too long to reach the past
I'm stretching out my fingers
But can't see they last

Yeah! Your heart'll be always parted
Steps're heard again
How long I was awake while played?
While played the game. Yeah!
The reason why I'm here
Is hard to see so clear
I'm stretching out my arms, can't see...
Can't see they're lost!!!

It's time to get much stronger
It's time for me to realize
Cannot wait any longer
Let's look at demon's eyes

[Chorus]

Yeah! Your heart'll be always parted
Steps're heard again
How long I was awake while played?
While played the game. Yeah!
The reason why I'm here
Is hard to see so clear
I'm stretching out my arms, can't see...
Can't see they're...
