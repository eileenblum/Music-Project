"Bang, bang, bang! Let's go, go, go!"
You couldn't get to sleep out
Nineteen days gone without the sun
Did not have a wink of sleep all night
Got the authorization
You are to kill the infidels

[Chorus:]
You will be hero!
They call this a battle for freedom
They say it's up to them
They must be there
Their freedom's come by hot napalm
Promising happiness
Uninvited stainless steel
Bayonets!

"Bang, bang, bang! Let's go! Let's go, go, go!"
Riding caterpillars
Unhurried chirring M-16's
Propaganda chorus leads ahead
Look at the warm wet jungle
Enough for many thousand graves

[Chorus 2x]
