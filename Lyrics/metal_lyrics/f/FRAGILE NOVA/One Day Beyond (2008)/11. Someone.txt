You're setting out your chess
There's money that you change for lives
That promised, more or less
No one proposed this'd be so simple. Yeah!

[Chorus 1:]
Follow me
I will follow you
To see I am

You're choosing left or right
Who said it's not too dangerous?
Await a day or night
To say for sure your right's so crazy. Yeah!

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
While thinking being away
The house is in decay
While calling someone for solution

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
