Lost forever life came back
As it seemed to you
Your quality's in black
Keep quiet, do you?
You wonder life was wrong
Compare to ideal
Your quality's so long
Just to do a deal

[Chorus 1:]
No more the way to run away from self
That you see sometimes clear

[Chorus 2:]
You'll always be a loser ridiculous
There's something in the water
That dissolves your brainless life
(Your brainless life... loser)

Met so sudden death was cute
Was choosing others
Your quality's acute
For holy fathers
Ropes break under the strain
Nothing rains to soap 'em
Your quality is pain
Save it for your lamb

[Chorus 1]

You'll always be a loser ridiculous
There's something in the water
That dissolves your brainless life

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
