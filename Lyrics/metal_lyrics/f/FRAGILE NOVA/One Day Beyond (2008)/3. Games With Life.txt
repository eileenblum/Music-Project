My rigid matter of life
In the hands to rewrite
Artificial sight
I took delight disappears
Field of vision inside
Spirits die as I lie
Suffocation beside
Till I fly

[Chorus:]
Been carried out upon the ground
Where is the way I've found?
Hear the death playing the fife
Involved in games with life

My inspiration denied
Chemicals may decide
To reward me again
With bringing where calm prevails
Is there anyone able
To restoring the label
On my foot to reside
As I die

[Chorus 2x]
