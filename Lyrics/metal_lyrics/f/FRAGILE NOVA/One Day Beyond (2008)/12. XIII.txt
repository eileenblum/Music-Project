You are all alone while searching
For a bond, cosmic soul
What was in your life such a great you
Need my eyes, my life is in your dreams
One can betray
One's called with a breakdown
But anyway
Your part is thirteen

[Chorus:]
When I see you again
Still you have been waiting for
Some things unreal
You cannot arise
Yet your hopes fail
When I see you again
Still you have been looking for
The one to say
The word to erase
Number thirteen

You cannot afford retracing
Your own steps, planet move
The fear of a chance changing minds will
Trap your sense, will carry off reason
You can't believe
While trusting the future
Even unless
Your fate is thirteen

[Chorus 2x]
