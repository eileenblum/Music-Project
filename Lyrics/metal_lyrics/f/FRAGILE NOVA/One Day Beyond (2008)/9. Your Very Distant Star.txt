Wait! I'm going
The cup is drunk up
Watch! I'm dying
Your fate's on the map
Closer to exit
You have never been
Still you're roaming
Your knife has no edge at all

Wounds inflicted
Enormously hurt
Hands are seizing
Perhaps they cannot
As spirits or ravens
Look out from beside
Don't screw up your eyes now
Yet scavengers choose a side

[Chorus 1:]
You're searching for one
Could never be real
Are you to succeed
I'm looking for what
Must never appeal
To your distant star

[Chorus 2:]
Calling someone who's never been called
Waiting for one who's never come before

Sights attractive
Can't be recognized
Limbs infected
Until oversized
As long as my travel's
Inconspicuous
You can't live on if you
Won't understand why again

[Chorus 1]

You're searching for one
Could never be real
Who'll be to find out
I'm looking for what
Must never appeal
To your very distant star

[Chorus 2]
