I raise my hands
Like a javelin in a lightning storm
The hunger pounds like a drum to our heads
Heart started stoppin' so just shock me with an AED
A nicotine fix my heart-itch consumes me

Bring us into life
(I'm alive, I can feel, I can taste, for the first time)
Bring us into life
(I'm alive, I can feel, I can see, I don't feel dead)

No one gazes me and lives
No one lives until they die
Once alone but not again
I'm yours until the end
No one understands the weight that I bore
Closed my eyes and I tasted death for
Every orphan everywhere
And alcoholic millionaires

So can you look at me now, and to the people who once were?
We used to carry this guilt on our backs
Live by the sword and learn to smile with your throat
Blood on our hands, but can't you see that's over?

Bring us into life
(I'm alive, I can feel, I can taste, for the first time)
Bring us into life
(I'm alive, I can feel, I can see, I don't feel dead)

I've made countless attempts to postpone
My impending failure
So cut with your imminent glory
And break off the millstone around my neck

No one gazes me and lives
No one lives until they die
Once alone but not again
I'm yours until the end
No one understands the weight that I bore
Closed my eyes and I tasted death for
Every orphan everywhere
And alcoholic millionaires
I'm yours until the end

Now I can see you sunk your claws into the dirt
Shifting orbits, drinking oceans, lifting valleys to my feet
But I took to my boats and I tasted sunken paths
I wound myself into the low and called the waters to their shores
Again you fought to bring me home and lifted low to spire
Rebuked the seas for heeding me and drained them once again
I'll do anything to see, so as I die make it slow
I swear I'll leave this earth in a wide-eyed drunken stare

No one gazes me and lives
No one lives until they die
Once alone but not again
I'm yours until the end
No one understands the weight that I bore
Closed my eyes and I tasted death for
Every orphan everywhere
And alcoholic millionaires
