Seven years here, yeah you'd think we'd be dead
Seven years at the bottom digging wells, striking air
To endure (we endure!), is to conquer and destroy
I'll swing and drip with sweat until my fist connects

Man is immortal till his work's done
Shawshank till my heart stops
Tear drop. Capulet
Fully alive in my dagger death
The beast is loose the beast is free
steppin' on his head like an IED
Met the beast at the ocean
Now he's bleeding in the streets

When the air gets thin breathe again
Under blood!
To the west coast kids give my love
Under blood!
When the mob takes it all we know nothing but to rise
Keep a steady, steady stride
Good to live. Good to die

If you stomached your sword samurai, pull it out
If your skull leaks gin like a sink, sober up
Curtains up, it's a hundred million dollar brawl
It's not the dog in the fight
Crazy always beats strong

Tell the angels of the churches not to worry
I'm first in, in person, bustin' a verse of pure fury
Immersed in the Word, worthy to hold the seven stars in his hand
It's all part of the plan of Him who mans the martyr when you martyr the man

When the air gets thin breathe again
Under blood!
To the west coast kids give my love
Under blood!
When the mob takes it all we know nothing but to rise
Keep a steady steady stride
Good to live. Good to die
Every moment I live give it all
Under blood!
Gotta bury my fears, cut 'em off
Under blood!
When they split my stomach up and the pigs are at my guts
Got a Ghost by my side
Good to live. Good to die

We give it all

When the air gets thin breathe again
To the west coast kids give my love
When the air gets thin breathe again
Under blood!
To the west coast kids give my love
Under blood!
When the mob takes it all we know nothing but to rise
Keep a steady, steady stride
Good to live. Good to die
Every moment I live give it all
Under blood!
Gotta bury my fears, cut 'em off
Under blood!
When they split my stomach up and the pigs are at my guts
Got a Ghost by my side
Good to live. Good to die
