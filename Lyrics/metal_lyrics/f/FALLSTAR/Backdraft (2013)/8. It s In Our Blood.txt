Beyond the bridge of the gods I caught a glimpse
Under the poplar trees it's raining gold
And I'm warm
I see a pattern, a progressive decline
One day we're gonna see the death cycle unwind
All things mortal were swallowed by Light
All things mortal have been swallowed by the Light

I just watched you dance
Through the mist and overcast
I just watched you dance
And I heard the earth cry "Allah."

From the foundations of the earth...
My brothers and sisters
Your eyes were meant to seek the face of God
Your ears to hear Him in the wind

Your air blows fresh into our lungs
Is this belief or is this love?
All praise to the Giver
(You're in our blood)
I got my head in the river
(You're in our blood)
Once we have seen we can't forget
Our lives were lost and now we live
All praise to the Giver
I got my head in the river

So as I toss and I turn
In the womb of the world
I know my Father's voice
I wanna hear Him clearly
I saw a river
I saw it wrap around the world
With our heads inside the flow
And our feet touching the earth
So who are you?
Do your steps make the world turn?
Do you usher in the new world?
Or do you sing for yourself?

Break every dam
And let the water heal the arid places
Break every dam
Send seven spirits back to wander

Your air blows fresh into our lungs
Is this belief or is this love?
All praise to the Giver
(You're in our blood)
I got my head in the river
(You're in our blood)
Once we have seen we can't forget
Our lives were lost and now we live
All praise to the Giver
I got my head in the river
Your air blows fresh into our lungs
Is this belief or is this love?
All praise to the Giver
(You're in our blood)
I got my head in the river
(You're in our blood)
Once we have seen we can't forget
Our lives were lost and now we live
All praise to the Giver
I got my head in the river

So I am just a simple failure
But let my praises haunt these canyons
I want more than just the thought of You
I want it all, I wanna see
I want more than just the thought of You
I want it all, I wanna see your face
