They're burning malbec blood through a paper heart
Give 'em a glass connect or pull them out through their arms
Till all we see are forest fires in the eyes of our brothers
Walking alcoholic bottle bombs
We're terrorists till death
Malbec blood through a paper heart
Give 'em a glass connect or pull them out through their arms
Till all we see are forest fires in the eyes of our brothers
Walking alcoholic bottle bombs
We're terrorists till death
Malbec blood through a paper heart
Give 'em a glass connect or pull them out through their arms
Till all we see are forest fires in the eyes of our brothers
Walking alcoholic bottle bombs
We're terrorists till death
