Bear with us killers and our predator nations
Soft target the doctors with malaria patients
The click at the door is now a brick through the window
I can smell the fear and I can see the sky dissolve

The highway
The highway is calling
Artery flows away from the heartland

The highway
The highway is calling
Far from the lies
Free of the sepsis

Back to, back to the water I'm feeling
To the river is all that I know, it's all that I know

We're holding every motive captive to a bayonet blade
As those about to die we salute to the districts
When every knuckle has been primed for a shattered jaw
Better to stab a dull shiv than roar chainsaw without a chain

I won't rest
I won't rest
I won't rest until I find you
I won't rest until we're face to face

Oh, oh
Oh, no, we can't stop here
Oh, no, we gotta reach the shore

Back to, back to the water I'm feeling
To the river is all that I know, it's all that I know

Under water, under the air
To the river is all that I know, it's all that I know

Rain, rain,
Rain down the flood
Rain, rain,
Rain down the flood

Rain, rain,
Rain down the flood
Rain, rain,
Rain down the flood

Rain, rain,
Rain down the flood
Rain, rain,
Rain down the flood

Rain, rain,
Rain down the flood
Rain, rain,
Rain down the flood
Rain down the flood
Rain down the flood
Rain down the flood
Rain down the flood

Back to, back to the water I'm feeling
To the river is all that I know, it's all that I know

Under water, under the air
To the river is all that I know, it's all that I know
