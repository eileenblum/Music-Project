I drag like morphine
Dead weight, spit me out
Have you created what you cannot contain?
Embalmed, I lost my life
I felt it pull out my nose
But I feel a new heart and it's rattling my bones

"Rise. Kill. Eat.
Rise. Take my name."
Can you handle the taste?
It's a race

So if you see you know, you go
Losing so much blood that it's feeling like a drug
Feeling like a drug
I'm a living ghost, a soul
Never gonna rest till I finally reach my home
Finally reach my home

And with the passion of a capulet
I'm an arson, and I come in peace
Only if you give me the fire that I crave
It's on the tip of my tongue
He's every song I have sung
Traded a novocain mouth for a hurricane tongue
And now my heart is full
And these hands are strong
I left a dead, dead walk
Dead, dead walk

Does the road lead uphill all the way?
Yes! To the very end
Will the day's journey take the whole long day?
From morning to night my dear, dear friend

So if you see you know, you go
Losing so much blood that it's feeling like a drug
Feeling like a drug
I'm a living ghost, a soul
Never gonna rest till I finally reach my home
Finally reach my home

Can't stop or give in until my heart stops beating
We've finally reached the shore
We've come so far
Won't stop till we know who you are

Woke to riots eating up my home a blade in every hand
I join for blood, blood, blood
'Cause I have found no cause that turns my bones to build or fill my lungs
So I will move until I'm spilling red and set it all ablaze
I'm dealing with the fear of understanding every word
I'm hearing, "Blood, blood, blood."
We are the failures, the dreamers, the scum of the earth
I'll be a beggar till the day I die

(One, two, three) It's failure, failure, failure, rest
Failure, failure, failure, rest
Failure, failure, failure, rest
Failure, failure, failure, rest
We will not rest until we see the new world
We will not rest until we're good and dead
We will not rest until we see the new world
We will not rest until we're good and dead
