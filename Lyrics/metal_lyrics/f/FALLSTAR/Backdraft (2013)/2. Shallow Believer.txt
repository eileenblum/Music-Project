[feat. Matty Mullins of Memphis May Fire]I feel the spirit like a dragon pouring out my mouth
I let the words burst off my tongue and then be blessed 'um
Kingdom come, your will be done
Iconoclast grinds
Stained glass windows to powder

I'll steal
I'll kill
I'll bleed and travail
I'll always fail you, fail you,

We walk in grace
It's how we live
Though we can't understand
It's how we live

This is our prayer for the new world
And its midnight sons
Every shallow believer
Every prophet
Every seer

One nation to share a song with all of creation
One nation to put our trust and our hope in the blood of god

Opening my eyes to see my lust for justice
Opening my eyes to see addiction to conquest

I'll stand down willingly
I will avenge
I will repay

Can a man ever truly understand god's grace?

This is our prayer for the new world
And its midnight sons
Every shallow believer
Every prophet
Every seer

One nation to share a song with all of creation
One nation to put our trust and our hope in the blood of god

This weight is on my shoulders
"Come up to breathe my son"
Is there anyone left to save me?
You said, "Become,
Become like me."

You always tell me I'm a sight unseen
But you've never felt the love
Until you've been here with me
"I'm always alone"
Yeah, you utter these words
But I will alone be here
Not a sound unheard
Not a sound unheard

This is our prayer for the new world
And its midnight sons
Every shallow believer
Every prophet
Every seer

One nation to share a song with all of creation
One nation to put our trust and our hope in the blood of god
