Until my hollow bones are filled
I toss and turn at the mercy of the wind
Can you heal my soul?
Can you fix my bones?
I feel my outsides waste away
Can that spark inside be fanned into flame?
Can you heal my soul?
Can you find me air?

This is what, what it must mean to feel alive
The light has reached my eyes in the valley
Here it burns, but I don't burn away
My God if you have found me, let me see your face

It's not safe, but it's so good
Hey oh, turn me inside out 'cause I'm just a shell of a man
And maybe I still wonder
And maybe I still wonder how
I got this shadow that keeps pulling on me every single step that I take
It makes me prone to wander
So you can pull him underground

Where you lay, where you entered the gates for my sake
How ugly was your face in that moment?
But how beautiful you are to me always
You won't relent until you have it all
This is love that knows no ends
You have given your life to me and my friends

You won't hear his voice in the streets
A bruised reed he will not break

It's not safe, but it's so good
It's not safe, but it's so good
It's not safe, but it's all good

Hey oh, turn me inside out 'cause I'm just a shell of a man
And maybe I still wonder
And maybe I still wonder how
I got this shadow that keeps pulling on me every single step that I take
It makes me prone to wander
So you can pull him underground

With each passing wind the leaves twist and turn
Like forgotten souls in an unmarked world
Once was I lost, once was I found
Until the days mark my end I will love you
Until the King reveals his glorious thread
To a people lost in the wind, twisting and turning again

Hey oh, turn me inside out 'cause I'm just a shell of a man
And maybe I still wonder
And maybe I still wonder how
I got this shadow that keeps pulling on me every single step that I take
It makes me prone to wander
So you can pull him underground
Hey oh, turn me inside out 'cause I'm just a shell of a man
And maybe I still wonder
And maybe I still wonder how
I got this shadow that keeps pulling on me every single step that I take
It makes me prone to wander
So you can pull him underground
