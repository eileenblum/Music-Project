Breathe in.
I'm a miscarriage to the new world, and my mother she spits me out.
Outburn Hell by bare knuckle enterprise.
Birthright pride with the stride of a monster.
Don't expect a passive man to snuff a fire out.

We're given eyes to see.
We're given hands to keep the peace.
Ears to hear the cries of the afflicted.
Hands to exact peace.

I wanna see You come back for us.
It's never meant to be this way this violent wind just makes me sick.
Come back so we trust again.
"I will avenge."

So turn world, and let the war torn saints cling to the cornerstone.
Like our fathers before us, to live is Christ.
For us to die is gain.
Standing firm is much more powerful than payback, and sweeter than revenge.
A whisper in the breeze finds me.
Legends of the dead come back haunting me.
A whisper in the breeze.
Until the end of the world all saints navigate by salvation's song, through torrents of crimson, but we never fall.

So I go inside.
It's time.
To be with you my love is my only desire.
You are my sweetest song.
I'll rush to tear down any door, until the earth ends and after.
To let you in.
