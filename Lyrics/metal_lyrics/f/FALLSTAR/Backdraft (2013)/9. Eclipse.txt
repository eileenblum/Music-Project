Broken I look to my right
To the floor I am cut
My uncrowned Messiah lying in his blood
Sold for a kiss and two pockets of silver
Serving the sentence of bloodthirsty killers
Broken my God
Broken I walk
Piercing eclipse, solar flare my King blazes
Catalyst of a great nation
He raised us
Rising from bones and the wasteland he runs
To charge burning buildings and pull out his sons
Glory to my God
In glory I walk
