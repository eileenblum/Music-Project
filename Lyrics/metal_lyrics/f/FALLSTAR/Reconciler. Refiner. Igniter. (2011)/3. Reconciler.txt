I feel it in my heart of hearts
And it swallowed me
Like designer drugs and gasoline it moves me
This must be love

I think I'm waking up this time (with every breath)
My hands now move like you

You swallowed waves that kept me pushing backwards
You changed my name and made me in your likeness
My heart once was cold but now it's pumping fire

We killed God
And tried to find him
But there was no body to be found
I felt his spirit inside me
And now I'm looking like him

I think I'm waking up this time (with every breath)
My hands now move like you

You swallowed waves that kept me pushing backwards
You changed my name and made me in your likeness
My heart once was cold but now it's pumping fire

I... have...been...

Reconciled

My hands they lift to praise you
My body moves to please you
My hands wait for your words
You'll know us by our works

LOVE HAS SWALLOWED ME WHOLE.
