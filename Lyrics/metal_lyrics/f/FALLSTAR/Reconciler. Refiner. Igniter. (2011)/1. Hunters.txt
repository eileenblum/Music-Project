We give you violence
Circumstance means nothing when you're sleep walking
I'm locked inside this brutal war that I must win

Heaven advances forcefully
And violent men lay hold of it
Brothers brace yourselves, for your bodies will be torn
But I won't cut and chant, for an unburnt offering

Everything I've ever done I leave it all behind
While the skeptics and the critics jade their minds and loose their sight
I would give my life tonight, I will always
Search and scrape and hunt and fight 'cause salvation's my prize

Oh my God make me a killer
Oh Jesus help me to set aside my will

Increase so I decrease
Don't stop until I'm like you
Lest they think you're not a God or you're fast asleep
Lest they say that, I am not your son

Oh my God make me a killer
Oh Jesus help me to set aside my will

Everything I've ever done I leave it all behind
While the skeptics and the critics jade their minds and loose their sight
I would give my life tonight, I will always
