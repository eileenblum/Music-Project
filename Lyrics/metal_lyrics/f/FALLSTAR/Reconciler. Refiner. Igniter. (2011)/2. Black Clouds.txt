My God my God. I clench my teeth. Waiting for your grace to shine through these blackened clouds leanding teh way. Leading the way. And I will follow you. My God, my God shelter us. My God my God, I wear this world like a gash to the cehst and lines on my wrist. It bleeds me... I saw a man leave the city with the world on his shoulders. He looked me in the eyes and I knew he's not coming back. We march to our own funerals. I will lfollow you always. It bleeds me dry. I've been wearing my organs on the outside. I saw a man leave teh city with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He looked me in the eyes and I knew he's not coming back. Take what I am. Take my life. And you, I will follow.
