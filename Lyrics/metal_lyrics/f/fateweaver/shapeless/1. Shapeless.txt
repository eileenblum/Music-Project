"The truth is that every night, I feel the light embrace me
And sadly every night, I become more of a ghostâ¦"

A cursed city of ghostly lights,
Sentenced to relive its sins every night.
The streets are the stage and its people,
The ignorant 'vessels' of a drama,
Repeated time and time again.

Hate meets love and demons meet saints
In a haze of smoke,
Alcohol and altered perceptions.
There are only two constants in every story: the vanity,
Behind the actions of the 'human-like' puppets
Oblivious to the fact that the script is already set

They struggle to escape from their roles
Only to find themselves incarnating them
In the most pure and lyrical wayâ¦

"â¦and this ghost light,
The pale companion of every soul at night."

And each ray becomes a book,
Waiting to be read,
A testimony of the darkness
That befell our city.

Some say that if you watch closely,
You could see ghostlike figures take shape,
The souls of all who walked this stage
Since the First Dusk.
