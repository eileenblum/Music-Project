Plague-like, infectious to the core
The claws of the West imperium
Reach out to conquer
Destroy to expand and expand to destroy more
The vultures saw profit
And they carved a deep wound
In humanity's fate...

I hear...
The cries of pain and torment
As vanity preys on the weak
They are lurching from their graves
Filled with horror of the human race...

Starring at the sky, we are all alone
Every night we die, the same fraud
Fear belongs to thee, look into your misery
An explosion in your head
What would you expect, to find...

I hear...
The cries of pain and torment
As vanity preys on the weak
They are lurching from their graves
Filled with horror of the human race...
