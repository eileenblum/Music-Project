You want to see him burn
He'll be a light in your hate filled darkness
You want to watch him suffer
His pain will give meaning to your wretched life

A deep fear for life
A deeper disgust for your own soul
That is the mark you carry
The mark that turned you
Rotten from within

These days it's just so hard
To meet the man behind the mask
A trace of good
In their poisonous gaze

The taint that laid
Deeply unseen
The seed left to grow free
There you stand, my dark kin
Projection of all the hate within.

Scream for a thought
And laugh for this game
The nightmare that binds you
To this horror plane.

No
Your heart lays frozen
And your mind is shut
The flames of damnation
Rise
Misery and darkness
Crawl through your mind
You shall burn forever
(in) a dark place
You filled with your hate
