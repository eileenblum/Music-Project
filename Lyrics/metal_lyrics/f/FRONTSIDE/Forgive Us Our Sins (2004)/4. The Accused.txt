Passing the Seventh Gate of Hell
When the tears get dry I`ll tell you
All I know, all I know...
About the millions, victims of war
Prophet`s march has just begun
All I know, all I know...

Shattered body torn by standards
Blood exploding in the veins
Demon looking at my face
Non-existence kills the moments

All I know, all I know...
All I know, all I know...
All I know, all I know...
All I know, all I know...
You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty

Crystals of frozen blood
Will fall on marble
Sorrow off the sccused will spread across the land
Mourning is only the old man`s face
He is condemned, deserves the ice-cold grave

You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
you are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
You are guilty
