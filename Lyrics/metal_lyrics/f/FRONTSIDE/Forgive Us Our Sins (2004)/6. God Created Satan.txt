He is the cursed one-eternal liar
Devilish spell-he is unconscious
Blood for Satan-the song is god`s
Infernal torture-ignited cross

It`s not the hellish fire
This is endless despair

God created Satan

I sing the blasphemous song
Setting my glassy eyes on the throne
I shall do what I desire
The more I remember, the more I`m pretending

Dishonored by afflication
I order you to crawl in the mud
Keep your eyes and mouth shut
Don`t defend yourself, die, forget
