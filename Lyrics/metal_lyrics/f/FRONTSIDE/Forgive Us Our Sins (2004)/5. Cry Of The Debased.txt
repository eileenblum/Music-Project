Cry of the debased, frantically looking down
The grain of faith is nearly dying
All your failures falling into oblivion
Reject confession of soul and body

Come...come...come...

Go to Hell-there is no turning back
Go to Hell-there is no turning back
Go to Hell-there is no turning back
Go to Hell-until the end of time

Black knights emerging from the realm of chaos
Participating in godless ceremonies
Deadly queen annihilating last breath
We are dazzled by her magic

Come...come...come...

Go to Hell-there is no turning back
Go to Hell-there is no turning back
Go to Hell-there is no turning back
Go to Hell-until the end of time

Your anxiety discovers moments of greed in dreams
When you ask me about them
Delightful words, I`ll remember them

When you again start to live, start to play
Start to have everything that you can

Then again start to live, start to play
Start to have everything that you can...that you can
