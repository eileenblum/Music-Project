Dead men`s eternity
Recalling in your head

It`s rain, it`s bloody rain
Cleaning the faces of the walking to death
It`s rain, it`s boiling rain
Tripping the ones who are walking to death

Blinding my eyes, can`t see their curse
I stand too close to run and hide

Death infernal

I love the rain, it cleans all the dirt
From the ground ruled by the chaos
It drowns the scum and all the smallest guilts
Still raging chaos knocking at your door

Death infernal

You`ll be weeping, you`ll be begging, you`ll be kneeling

It`s rain, it`s bloody rain
Cleaning the faces of the walking to death
It`s rain, it`s boiling rain
Tripping the ones who are walking to death

Hundreds of victims lie around me
I slowly put out the candles of life

Death infernal

You`ll be weeping, you`ll be begging, you`ll be kneeling
