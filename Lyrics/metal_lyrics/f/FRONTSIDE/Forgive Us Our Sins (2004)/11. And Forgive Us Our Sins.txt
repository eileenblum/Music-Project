You put the whole world to see the finel test
Another town razed down to the ground
Convicts suffer in the steel cages
And the pilgrim absolving all of you

And forgive us our sins

Forgive
Forgive
Forgive us
Forgive

Forgive
Forgive
Forgive us
Forgive

Stench and destruction, devilization
Society collapsing, killing itself
Disintegratation, corruption and no balance
Screams of the honest brighten the darkness
