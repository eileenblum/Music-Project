Burn like me!
Burn!

Hatred is like the wine
Agression is the bread
We want to see your sweating body
I see the hearts still burning, still burning in our chests
Your eyes are seeking the revenge

Bloodstained body
Bloodstained body

So let us join his last supper
Take the chalice of his sins
So let us join the ceremony

Hatred is like the wine
Agression is like brad
And cut off heads are falling down
And now your heart is burning, burning stron in the chest
I wanna taste your fucking blood

I see...
Bloodstained body
Bloodstained body
Bloodstained body

So let us join his last supper
Take the chalice of his sins
So let us join the ceremony

The heaven`s pleasure-you will never find them
