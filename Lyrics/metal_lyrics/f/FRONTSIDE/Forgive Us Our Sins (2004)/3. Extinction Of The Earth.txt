War...war...war...
War...war...war...
War...war...war...

Dark and lousy heads of the pious blindmen
Reveal the picture of sick violence
The gods of mayhem never again together
Naverending warfare, neverending death

Bloody teardrops portend the future
Falling down the Holy Cross
Sword and shelter, the tribe won`t give in
The treshold of your purgatory

The end of time...
The end of time...
The end of time...

War...war...war...
War...war...war...
War...war...war...

This is the end of your brightness
Taken over by the shadows
That capture your deep and secret fears
I hear the sounds of the bell

Servant fall and kneel down in front of the devil`s throne
Don`t split your sins into pieces anymore
Machines of destiny control the evil presence
Pact with the Devil signed with your blood

The end of time...
The end of time...
The end of time...

Extinction of the Earth
Extinction of the Earth
Extinction of the Earth
Downfall
Extinction of the Earth
Extinction of the Earth
Extinction of the Earth
Creation
