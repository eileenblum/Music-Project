I...

I see the gaping wound in your shallow inside
Each night you pray for quick and painless death
Your soul is raped in the cell of awareness
You hide the truth and you know it`s wrong

Cursed!

You bow your head with fear and I can hear you weeping
I hear the howling-dark funeral march
And when all the voices become silent
The rope is waiting for your neck

Cursed!
