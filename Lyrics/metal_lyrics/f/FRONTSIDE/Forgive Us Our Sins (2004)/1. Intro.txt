You know me and whatever you think of me
You know that i wouldn`t lie to you
There are people among you who lost hope
I know you`re afraid-I understand this
I heard you many times saying this world has no future
Let the faith lead you
Because there will be nothing left on Judgement Day
One more time you can make your choice
Ask yourself whether you wanna die like animals
Like the forgotten ones
Like the cursed ones begging for mercy that will never be shown
Or maybe you are prepared to stand up and fight for your life
For an audience with your Creator
Just like all those convinced of their purified souls

Are you ready to take the communion?
