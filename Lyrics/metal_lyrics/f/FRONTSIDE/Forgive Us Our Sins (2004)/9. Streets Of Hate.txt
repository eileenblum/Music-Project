Every day down the street
I set my eyes on the same old walls
Turn my head as I hear the breaking glass
I love these places, their sound

This is my bloody red of the brickworks
With a contrast to the uniforms
Laughing at them I start to see
I`m not afraid of these words

I deeply feel secure and strong because I know
I`m not alone and I know where I belong
My only friend-neverending trouble
Cute chicks looking at the sky

I`m not afraid
I know where I belong

We are the family-me and the streets
I hold steel crowbar in my hand
Gotta fight for every single day

The street`s too beautiful to die in
Every second gate is nearly dying
Kids to whom football is their mother
Their time will come to take the gun to their hands
