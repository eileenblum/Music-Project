When I was young I use to believe there wasn't a difference between you and me but now the seperation doesn't seem so clear always searching for something that will never appear and every silver lining has a way of letting you down it penetrates and leaves you scarred this worlds at its end like building thats crumbling moving further to its collapse I can feel the fibers, like grains of sand passing through my finger tips and I think of my parents and how strong they used to be this world was too much and now addiction has them beat isn't it time for change, before its too late and this world turns another shade of gray? Your friends fall from grace and only three words come to mind but even that doesn't feel the same it's falling apart, it's about to break this world is ripping itsself to shreds, now as yourself what do we have left? (nothing)
