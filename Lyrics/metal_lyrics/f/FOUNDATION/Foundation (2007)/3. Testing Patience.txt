Why should I open my mouth when youll just pick apart what I say? You think you've got me figured out who I am, what I'm about well lets get this clear... just because I see a light in the dark doesnt mean Im blind to how hard life can be this is a grade school lesson you should have learned it only changes when we learn from our mistakes I can take a hit and keep moving can you do the same? Twenty years down and things don't seem to have changed why do we come together if all we do is fall apart? Tried to bridge a gap thats burning down, bring the matches bring the gasoline and I'll know for sure our ideas, our ideals, could never be the same this goes beyond seeing things differently we must be blind if can't see that this weighs more than gold and even though we're all standing in this room with our friends and friends of friends, it doesn't mean we're on the same page I'll say it I'm already stepping on toes I'll say it I've got no place to go Why should I open my mouth and waste my fucking breath? Because despite what I say, could you do the same?
