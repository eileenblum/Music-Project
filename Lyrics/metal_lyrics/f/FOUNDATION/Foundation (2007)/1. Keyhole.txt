No one said that this was going to be so easy that was just a lie I sang to myself it only gets harder with every passing day watch the sun rise through a window the size of a keyhole to a door that wont be opened a cross that's not mine is holding me back and those bleeding hearts have got me pinned to the ground this world was meant to keep us on our knees. Told to be grateful for what's been given but never given a chance that's all we wanted my mind is a weapon kept tucked away held back too long now my emotions have got the best of me feeling my heart beat like a drum my legs turned to concrete there's no place to run frustrations have got me by the front of my shirt... my mouth is the barrel to a gun I'll climb to my feet, and throw my arms in the air (fire away) The bullets say "I dare you" to go on with life this way you couldnt go another day I made my way out the key to the door was breaking it down
