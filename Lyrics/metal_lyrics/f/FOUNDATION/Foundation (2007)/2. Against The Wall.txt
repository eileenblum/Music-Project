Its always going to be this way somethings will never change the choices that we make and the decision that weve made too old to be naive too young to know anything and this burden is ours we'll be held accountable for everyone of these days our actions could build monuments to what we achieve but these days they bring nothing nothing but rain and everything we built gets washed away but all the promise we have is still here sitting there blank stare swallow the knot in your throat and I hope we can stop our selfish ways standing here clenched fist spitting words for you to hear and its only one question that I have to ask have you beaten the path or has the path beaten you searching for something real the joy and the sadness the truth for as ugly as it appears like the feelings you got when you lost someone you loved was it too much and when the skies clear out their words meant nothing when the storm is over is anyone here I gotta belive I gotta believe theres something than whats been given but its up to us to find it get it through your head I dont care how hard you swing that hammer sometimes it wont make a dent!
