When I was young I used to believe. There wasnât a difference between you and me. But now the separation seems so clear. You keep searching for answers - that will never appear. Every silver lining, has its way of letting you down. It penetrates and it leaves you scarred. This life, at its end - like a building thatâs crumbling. Moving further â towards collapse. I can feel the fibres, like grains of sand. Passing through â my fingertips. And I think of my parents and how strong they used to be. But this world was too much. These addictions have them beat. Isnât it time for change before itâs too fucking late. And this world turns another shade of grey. Your friends fall from grace. And only three words come to mind. But even that doesnât feel the same. When weâre falling apart. This is about to break. This world is ripping itself to shreds. Now ask yourself, what do we have left? NOTHING.
