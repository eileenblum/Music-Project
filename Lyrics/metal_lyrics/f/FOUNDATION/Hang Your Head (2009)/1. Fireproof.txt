Nothing - will break this faith. The choice - I have made. To stay - free from addictions. A story that repeats itself a hundred fold. I'm tired of telling. Seen the consequences played out in the past. Someone like you or me with insecurities, turns to the only thing they think will set them free. Instead bound by it. Lock and key. Now just another burning wreck. They're life goes down - down in flames. Nothing - would change their fate. The choice - they couldn't make. To say - enough is enough. This could have been you, and it could have been me. If I had a thousand words on a hundred pages. I couldn't tell you how much this really means. This is as personal as it gets. The war outside and within. This is as personal as it gets - this promise is my salvation. This is as personal as it gets.
