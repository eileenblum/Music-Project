Why canât I say no - temptations plague my heart. Like a steel-trap â Iâm caught can't turn away. How will I get up from these sheets and walk away. How many times can I pass through the fire, before I get burned alive? How can I hurt myself, more than anyone else. How can anyone help me If I canât help myself. Why canât I say no while guilt follows me. Like the shadows on the wall. Shame runs though me like a blade to the chest. This Fear keeps me from letting you in. So Iâll stand alone. Lost and alone. When itâs my actions to defend. And my heart the judge. Iâll find myself guilty. For the things - I have done. I am heartless.
