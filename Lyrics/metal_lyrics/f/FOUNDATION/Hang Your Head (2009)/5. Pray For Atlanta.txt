I need your answers â like a hole in my head. I know these stories are nothing more than myths. I feel the only truth is one we make for ourselves. I choose to respect this life â no concern for what comes next. You just waste every second you have left. I need your truth like a rope around my neck. Your promise of âloveâ I can not trust. Your âlight in the darkâ I refuse to see. Your fucking answers. This force fed guilt. These falsehoods. I donât need. Refuse to believe. I will not surrender, or bow my head in shame. I will not bend a single knee. To uphold your tradition. Tie the knot on the noose. Kick the chair from underneath. Load one in the chamber â point the barrel and FUCKING squeeze. I need your answers like a hole in my head. This spiritual suicide I will commit.
