Who threw up the white flag when the bodies grew to be too great? Felt the harsh grip of failure and sailed it high. What happened to the code of honor that we used to entrust? Ideas once carved in stone have now been turned to dust. Where is the sacred oath that we swore our allegiance to? Convictions cheapened by all the noise these boys make while dressed up like men. When is the pure disgust going to rear it's ugly head? Stirred by anyone and everything that tries to crumble what we've built. Why have I been so blind to the traitors of my faith? What has come to pass, now seems so obvious. How can I not grit my teeth or place my tongue firmly in my cheek when I say... That there is no more room here for the bastard thieves who steal hearts and disappear. No room for those who will come apart at the bayonet's gleam. So please show me someone who won't retreat, someone who's gonna stay frosty when the cannons and guns begin to erupt, someone as they are painted with guts and blood. Show me someone who will march forward when the smoke clears.
