Fucked hope, what can I do? I'm trying so hard to get through to you. But you donât wanna hear a single word of truth. But every lie swore as true falls like music to your ears. How can we live our lives so unaware? How can we love if we are so fucking scared? And my only regret is that Iâll play the same dreadful tune. You sing the same song your parents sang about their unflinching devotion to everything, everything sick and wrong with yesterday and today. They broke you down and stole everything, and you openly embraced that this life was not your very own. False hope is all they'll give to you, the best years is what they'll take from you , you were robbed how long will it be before you see? All the skinned knees you should have felt, a thousand ways to break free but you won't. So keep carrying your father's cross, and living your mother's dreams, never getting to express a voice you should have raised. You were never there for yourself. So now, I don't know whos to blame.
