Just shut the door when you choose to leave. I don't wanna feel any colder than I already do. No amount of wing is going to move this rock if you were looking for me to let you in thats a thought you can forget. I don't care what they say, the sun will shine another day. I've weathered too much, to walk away. I know it's not the worst thing to happen in my life. But now my fears are starting to pour down and me and now I don't know what to believe. Feels like I'm losing my mind, feels like i'm losing everything, feels like my body is a prison I can't escape. This is a saddness, that only loneliness can bestow. So pick up the pieces of your broken soul, weld them to your bones. My anger will flood the streets, while i'm standing knee deep. I can't remember the last time I felt the sun crash against my face. But I'll keep moving on, I will not drown. I'm not about to turn away but let me ask you: How long can you wait?
