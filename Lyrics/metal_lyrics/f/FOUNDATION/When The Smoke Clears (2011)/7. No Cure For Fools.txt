I pray that hand of yours gets cut right off from your wrist as you cast out your arm and turn down your thumb. It's so easy to pass out judgement when you take no risks. Don't need the approval of someone who spits poison every time they speak. Venom rolls off your tounge and between your teeth. But your words don't mean a thing to me. Because you have never loved anything and I mean anything more than yourself. And there is nothing, i said nothing, so righteous, noble, and good that your ego couldnt devour in the span of a hear beat. Hear the sound of your chest thump. I pray that hand of yours gets hacked right off from your wrist. Sliced through like a god damn hammer and I hope the pain drops you to your knees cause if you can't stand then you can't stomp on these dreams. I've seen your kind, and you're all the same.
