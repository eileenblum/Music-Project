Hanging on by a thread, I pull myself back up. Cause I'll be god damned if this is the rop from which I hang myself. In desperate times we live by desperate means. We put our faith, love, and sanity into anyone, even the unseen. As long as it will make us feel good, whole, and complete. We'll put our trust into anything, if it takes away this uncertainty. The problems go unfixed, the anger goes unchecked, the emptiness goes unfed. The devotion remains to what will undo us. In desperate times we live by desperate means. I can't blame you for doing the same. So heres the choice: The truth or the end of a rope. I've never seen someone so scared of death, so eager to lay down and die. The problems go unfixed, the anger goes unchecked, the eptiness goes unfed, the devotion remains to what will undo us. Get your rope. Devotion.
