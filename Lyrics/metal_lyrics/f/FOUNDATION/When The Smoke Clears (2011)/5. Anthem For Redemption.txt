Life served me a verdict with an open hand, full force across my face then walked away. Please don't leave me in this dark place cause i don't know how much how much longer i can fight back these tears or keep from driving my fists through the walls i swear are closing in. Ashamed of myself for the selfish things I say, the promises I break and the way I refuse to let anyone in. Please let me make amends, I'll do anything, anything, anything. Just don't leave me in this dark place. Begging, pleading, down on my knees asking for redemption. So dig in your nails as I push you away. Let me make amends for always keeping you at arms length, let me apologize for every wrong that I have yet to right you are the blood in my veins, my strength so please don't leave me in this dark place... Just give me one more chance.
