How long will it be before we're ready to set fire to this bridge? A guest now, in the home where i once lived, I'm on the outside looking in. Ask me to leave and Iâll fucking go, just say the words. Like the tide dragged by the moon, I'm at your mercy. How much longer can I bite my tongue before I sever it? Held out your hand when I needed it most, and I haven't stopped paying for it. Ask me to leave and I'll fucking go, just say the words. Like the tide dragged by the moon, I'm at your mercy. Ask me to leave and I'll go. The hefty price of your hospitality I can no longer afford. Don't want to argue anymore (so sick of slamming doors.) And tired of the words you wield like knives hoping to stab somewhere close to my heart- I'm at your mercy and I don't wanna be anymore. So ask me to leave and I'll fucking go. Just say the words.
