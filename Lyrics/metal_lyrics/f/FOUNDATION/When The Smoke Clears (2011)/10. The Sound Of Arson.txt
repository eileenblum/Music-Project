Despite all the spiteful things I say I still need this like the air I breathe. I still need this to prop up these tired bones, cause my youth is leaving. Never to be seen again, stripped from me by time and pressure. So still I bang the drum in a sound of declaration of war against the world that is dark and calculated like a killer in the shadows to remove me from this calculation. This is a war so many will never know, opposition to the world that is stark, raving, mad and cold. But i'm scared this anger won't last much longer... Despite all the bullshit I say I still need this to breath life into me. Stoke the ashes, spark the flame, feed the fire, burn down the lies, burn through the rhetoric, burn it all down to face the world like a roaring blaze, before these tears and war cries begin to turn silent. Burn down everything that stands in our way. So, bang the drum.
