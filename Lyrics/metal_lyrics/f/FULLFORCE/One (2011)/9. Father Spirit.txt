So filled with memories
Left his life when he was young
Suddenly you were not there
When he needed you most

A dream of what could be
Can you see from the spirit world?
Years have passed but still you're messed
Endless love to you, endless love

He remembers his restless mind
Lost track of time, completely lost
So many tears he never shed
Until that day, farewell to life, father

He was calling
He was screaming
Lost it all when his father left him
He was crying
He felt lonely
In memoriam of his father

For some years life felt so wrong
All the grief he couldnât bear
Later on he realized
He had to find the passion of life again

He remembers his restless mind
Lost track of time, completely lost
So many tears he never shed
Until that day, farewell to life, father

He was calling
He was screaming
Lost it all when his father left him
He was crying
He felt lonely
In memoriam of his father
