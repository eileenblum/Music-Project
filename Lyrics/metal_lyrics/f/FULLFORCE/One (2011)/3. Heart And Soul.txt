I am lost in my mind
Terrorized in this dark world
So much misery, the innocents are crying
Children are going through hell
Images haunting my dreams
Weapons and war and insanity
Children fighting for their right to survive
They fight for their cause

A burning desire
To bring down the hands that feed this evil
I can't let it go

Heart and soul
Crying out
Dreams of freedom seem unreal
Smiling faces, no more laughter
Fighting to live

Heart and soul
They believe
Child soldiers, sacrifice
Smiling faces, tears of pain
Fighting for human rights

Mothers crying for their loss
Praying to god for a miracle
There's no justice in this world anymore
A world where children can't be children

A burning desire
To bring down the hands that feed this evil
I can't let it go

Heart and soul
Crying out
Dreams of freedom seem unreal
Smiling faces, no more laughter
Fighting to live

Heart and soul
They believe
Child soldiers, sacrifice
Smiling faces, tears of pain
Fighting for human rights

Heart and soul
Crying out
Dreams of freedom seem unreal
Smiling faces, no more laughter
Fighting to live

Heart and soul
They believe
Child soldiers, sacrifice
Smiling faces, tears of pain
Fighting for human rights
