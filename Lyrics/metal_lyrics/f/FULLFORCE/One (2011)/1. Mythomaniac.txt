Darkness comes
You hear screams in the dark
Try to see, deny the fear
Hero of the night
Standing tall in your dreams
You fear no evil
So many lies that have men told
To empress your loved ones

The devil in disguise you seem to be
Reality is something you can't touch
No one knew you lied
A way to gain respect
(No one knew you were driven by lies)

Don't deny, liar
There's no reason to believe
Do not hide, face it
You can not go on like this anymore
Mythomaniac

Wasted lies
You have lost your pride
No one believes what you say
You've got no one to blame
Falling down, down the gutter
When regret fills your mind
No one feels sorry for you and your lies
You are left in the dark

The devil in disguise you seem to be
Reality is something you can't touch
No one knew you lied
A way to gain respect
(No one knew you were driven by lies)

Don't deny, liar
There's no reason to believe
Do not hide, face it
You can not go on like this

Don't deny, liar
There's no reason to believe
Do not hide, face it
You can not go on like this

Standing tall in your dreams, you fear no evil
There's no reason to believe

Don't deny, liar
There's no reason to believe
Do not hide, face it

Don't deny, liar
There's no reason to believe
Do not hide, face it
You can not go on like this

Don't deny, liar
There's no reason to believe
Do not hide, face it
You can not go on like this anymore
