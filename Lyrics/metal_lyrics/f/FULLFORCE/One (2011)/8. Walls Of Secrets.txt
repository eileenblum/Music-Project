Scratching the surface
Another world to see
Love's an illusion
So much anger within these walls

On the outside it seems like they are number one
Harmony seems so strong

Walls of secrets, misery
Endless crying, no remorse
Tears are falling, hatred flows
Seems like there's no way to get along

Dangerous actions
They are hiding it from the world
Seems like they're driven to face their needs of pain

On the outside it seems like they are number one
Harmony seems so strong

Walls of secrets, misery
Endless crying, no remorse
Tears are falling, hatred flows
Seems like there's no way to get along

World is falling, so much crying
Will it end?

On the outside it seems like they are number one
Harmony seems so strong
Rising fury in disguise
Public smiles are an act
They are hiding it well

Walls of secrets, misery
Endless crying, no remorse
Tears are falling, hatred flows
Seems like there's no way to get along

Walls of secrets...

Dangerous actions
They are hiding it from the world
Seems like they're driven to face their needs of pain

On the outside it seems like they are number one
Harmony seems so strong...walls of secrets...
