She is isolated
Hidden from our world
The lack of daylight makes her insane
She's locked inside a dungeon
No windows, no fresh air
Freedom is just an illusion to her

Stains of blood on the walls
Screams out loud, no one hears
There's no one who can rescue her
So many years in despair have twisted her mind
The world outside doesn't exist to her

Has no vision at all
Can't see a reason to live
Friends have lost all their hope
Of seeing her alive
She's a prisoner
Hidden from our world
A psychopath rules her life

Stains of blood on the walls
Screams out loud, no one hears
There's no one who can rescue her
So many years in despair have twisted her mind
The world outside doesn't exist to her

Screams out loud
No one hears
There's no one who can rescue her
She's suffering in silence

Stains of blood on the walls
Screams out loud, no one hears
There's no one who can rescue her
So many years in despair have twisted her mind
The world outside doesn't exist to her

Stains of blood on the walls
Screams out loud, no one hears
There's no one who can rescue her
So many years in despair have twisted her mind
The world outside doesn't exist to her
