It seems like heaven is falling down
Shades of grey dominate the sky
So tired, so boring

I can not stand this pouring rain
No energy, no inspiration
No sunlight, no action

There's a new day tomorrow
I dream about blue skies
I want cloudy, rainy days to disappear

Hiding inside my window
Tired of endless raining
No wonder depressions increase every day
We have to see the bright sides of life

All those rainy days that pass
Shouldnât affect my mood
Prevent it, it's a challenge

Use your imagination to find a way
To smile at the rain
Don't waste your time banning the grey

There's a new day tomorrow
I dream about blue skies
I want cloudy, rainy days to disappear

Hiding inside my window
Tired of endless raining
No wonder depressions increase every day
We have to see the bright sides of life

Hiding inside my window
Tired of endless raining
No wonder depressions increase every day
We have to see the bright sides of life

Now it's raining in my heart

Hiding inside my window
Tired of endless raining
No wonder depressions increase every day
We have to see the bright sides of life

Hiding inside my window
Tired of endless raining
No wonder depressions increase every day
We have to see the bright sides of life
