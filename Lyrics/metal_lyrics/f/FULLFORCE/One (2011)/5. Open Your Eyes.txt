Reaching out for more
Never satisfied
You can break down walls just to ensure
To be the first to know
You'll take the lion's share
Your ego only sees the profit you can take

No brothers and sisters
You've only got yourself
You're the center of the world

Now open your eyes
You can't go on like this
You have to realize
You have to change
The only passion you have is to believe in your way
You are the center of the world

The only thing you care about
Is to be the first in line
You never share a dime if you can't help it
Egocentric mentality
No one cares about you
You're all alone and there's no one to blame

It's your way or the highway
You can not compromise
That's the way you are

Now open your eyes
You can't go on like this
You have to realize
You have to change
The only passion you have is to believe in your way
You are the center of the world

No brothers and sisters
You've only got yourself
You're the center of the world

Now open your eyes
You can't go on like this
You have to realize
You have to change
The only passion you have is to believe in your way
You are the center of the world

Now open your eyes
You can't go on like this
You have to realize
You have to change
The only passion you have is to believe in your way
You are the center of the world
