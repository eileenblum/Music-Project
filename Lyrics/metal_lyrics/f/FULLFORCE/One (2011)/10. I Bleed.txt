I scream, I bleed
Within, empty
Senses shivers
My head, aching

All my dreams are fading
My world is falling
Wanna save what I'm about to lose
Can not stand this feeling

Do you remember what we had
Do you remember our love
I can not help you're in my heart
You are the only one

I close my eyes and see you
You saved my heart from the darkness
I can not help remembering
I call your name, no response

Crying when nobody sees me
Don't wanna show how weak I feel
Losing everything I lived for
Will I believe in love again

Silence surrounds me
Darkness approaching
No smile, agony
So grey, dying

No more dreams to follow
Drowning in sadness
Wanna find the passion
Can not stand this feeling

Do you remember our dreams
Do you remember our plans
You mean so much to me
You are the only one

I close my eyes and see you
You saved my heart from darkness
I can not help remembering

All my dreams are fading
My world is falling
I call your name, no response

Crying when nobody sees me
Don't wanna show how weak I feel
Losing everything I lived for
Will I believe in love again

Crying when nobody sees me
Don't wanna show how weak I feel
Losing everything I lived for
Will I believe in love again

I bleed
