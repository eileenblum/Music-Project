My dreams are lost and gone
I regret that I did lie
Intensions based on love
I sacrificed myself in the name of love
Now I'm falling down the drain

Someday you'll understand I had my reasons
I only wanted the best for you

You made me realize
You made me suffer my mistakes
Now I'm crying, filled with anger, love lost

I feel changes
Can't see tomorrow anymore
I cry in vain
I fear what the future holds for me

Sadness dominates
All black, oblivion, nothing left
Acting out of love
Always putting myself at stake

Never wanted this to end
Blaming me for more than I need
My senses shake inside
I know that I did wrong
Still I never wanted to hurt you
You were everything to me

Maybe you'll understand when it all has faded away
I'm living my own nightmare

I hope you'll realize and might forgive me
I am crying, filled with anger, love lost

I feel changes
Can't see tomorrow anymore
I cry in vain
I fear what the future holds for me

Sadness dominates
All black, oblivion, nothing left
Acting out of love
Always putting myself at stake

Someday you'll understand
I had my reasons
I only wanted the best for you
I hope you'll realize and might forgive me
Now I'm crying, filled with anger, love lost

I feel changes
Can't see tomorrow anymore
I cry in vain
I fear what the future holds for me

Sadness dominates
All black, oblivion, nothing left
Acting out of love
Always putting myself at stake
