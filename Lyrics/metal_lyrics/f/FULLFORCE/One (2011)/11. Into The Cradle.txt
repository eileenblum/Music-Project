I remember when she called my name
A new chapter in my life
I was lost in her eyes
She enchanted me

Erasing history
Never thought that I'd believe in love again
She carried my heart away
Into the cradle of love

It can't go wrong...

I see you, feel you, care for you
Our love is strong
Nothing's gonna make us part our ways
Our love grows stronger day by day

Never thought that love could be this strong
I have gone through a mental maze
I was rescued by love
Now I'm lost in time and space

Endless lonely nights
A life that I don't want to remember
It's not a part of me anymore
Because I found love

It can't go wrong...

I see you, feel you, care for you
Our love is strong
Nothing's gonna make us part our ways
Our love grows stronger day by day

Ooh, I feel you
My heart's beating for you, I'm drowning in your eyes
I remember when you called my name
A new chapter in my life

Nothing's gonna make us part our ways
Our love grows stronger day by day
I see you, feel you, care for you
Our love is strong
Our love grows stronger day by day
Nothing's gonna make us part our ways
Our love grows stronger day by day
