The midnight's mystery brings fear and silence
The endless sky is wrapped in riddles
So many questions with no answers
A small step for mankind
Entered our universe
Still we don't know what's beyond our galaxy
Sometime it feels like we should let it go

So many goals to reach
We have so much to achieve
We got ourselves to blame
Then we will hit the wall

Think twice or everything will fall down on you
Believe
What we don't know has no concern

No one will praise you for doing everything
Let your heart make your decisions
Don't overdo it, put limitations
Slow down fast or face the wall
Or you will regret
It's all a matter of fact everyone will love you
If your friends are true

So many goals to reach
We have so much to achieve
We got ourselves to blame
Then we will hit the wall

Think twice or everything will fall down on you
Believe
What we don't know has no concern
Rise and believe in yourself
Or everything will fall down on you
Believe
What we don't know has no concern

So many goals to reach
We have so much to achieve
We got ourselves to blame
Then we will hit the wall

Think twice or everything will fall down on you
Believe
What we don't know has no concern
Rise and believe in yourself
Or everything will fall down on you
Believe
What we don't know has no concern
