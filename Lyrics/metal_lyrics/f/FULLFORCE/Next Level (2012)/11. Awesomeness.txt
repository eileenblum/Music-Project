A lesson learned so well
Climbing up from the shadows to the light
Sees the future with a calming feel
Gaining strength

A decision has been made
Erase the past
Fight for a future based on love

Now I feel so much awesomeness
We will never be apart again
United we are so strong...we're alive

Too many tears have been shed
Determined to leave it all behind
Together we will reach the stars
Brand new goals

We're breaking new grounds
So much to gain
We go by the flow and smile at the world

Now I feel so much awesomeness
We will never be apart again
United we are so strong...we're alive
...cause we're alive

Now I feel awesomeness
We will never be apart again...united we are

Now I feel so much awesomeness
We will never be apart again
United we are so strong...we're alive
