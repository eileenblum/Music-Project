I know your world was fallinâ,
You were crying all night long.
The never ending feeling
You can hear the beats of your heath.
You coulnât stand feeling that lonley,
Thereâs no reason to give up.

You can see the smile in your dreams
The strongest thing of all
Is your love when you are united
The strongest thing of all.

Want every dreams to come true,
You wanna show all your love.
You couldnât stand on waiting
To me, to love again.
You couldnât stand feeling that lonley,
Thereâs no reason to give up.

You can see the smile in your dreams
The strongest thing of all
Is your love when you are united.
You will always try to keep your faith
The strongest thing of all
Is your love when you are united.

You can see the smile in your dreams
The strongest thing of all
Is your love when you are united.
You will always try to keep your faith
The strongest thing of all
Is your love when you are united. [2x]
