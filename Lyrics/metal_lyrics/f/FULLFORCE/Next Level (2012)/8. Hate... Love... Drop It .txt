It's a thin line between love and hate
Loosing respect saying words without any substance
There's nothing to gain when words collide
It always ends in regrets

Lies are easy to spread when hatred grows
Try to focus on the good sides

Hate, love (Love, hate now drop it)
Learn to show respect and focus on what made you fall in...
Love (Love, hate now drop it)
Devotion
All your love shouldnât be thrown away
Kill the hate!

Now let it go
Show some respect
Try to understand instead of drowning your love
None of you will win but end up in tears
It is so easy that love turns to hate

Lies are easy to spread when hatred grows
Try to focus on the good sides

Hate, love (Love, hate now drop it)
Learn to show respect and focus on what made you fall in...
Love (Love, hate now drop it)
Devotion
All your love shouldnât be thrown away
Kill the hate!
