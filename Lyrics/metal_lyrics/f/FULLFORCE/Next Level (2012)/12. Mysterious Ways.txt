So hard to say goodbye
Promises over and over
Still falling back to love
Passion comes and goes

Comes from behind
Slowly increasing
Suddenly everything explodes
Finding no words to say
Just swallowing what's thrown at you

You want this to end and live with a smile

Mysterious ways
Will not ever cry again, never
Trying so hard to understand
Give it up or heal the pain

It's hard to see it
When love has blinded you
You know there's passion
But it's so hard to keep it strong

You want this to end and live with a smile

Mysterious ways
Will not ever cry again, never
Trying so hard to understand
Give it up or heal the pain
Mysterious ways

Mysterious ways
Will not ever cry again, never
Trying so hard to understand
Give it up or heal the pain

Mysterious ways
Will not ever cry again, never
Trying so hard to understand
Give it up or heal the pain
