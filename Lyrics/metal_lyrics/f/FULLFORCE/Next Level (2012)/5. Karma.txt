So many answers to search for
Hunts me down and it can't let go
Why am I thinking the way I do
Things that are better not to know

Curiosity, obsession
The more I think, the more I dream
What will be said in my afterlife
What will be said when I am gone

Will you remember me
Will you remember me when I'm gone
Have I made a mark in history

Dark
So lost
Dark
In vain

Why am I questioning the future
I can not find all the answers
Will I turn into oblivion
A faded soul with no trace

What will be said when I am dead
What kind of stories will be told
What have I done to make my mark
Have I made an impact

Will you remember me
Will you remember me when I'm gone
Have I made a mark in history

How will I be remembered
Associated with love
Or will I be remembered as darkness

A black spot in eternity
A perpetual flame is dying
Live while you can, live life now

All these questions are haunting me
What did I share with the world
What will be my legacy in the afterlife

When I leave, will it be grand
Will man salute my goodbye
Will I become a legend or a human stain
