All these candle lights, the evening comes
All the friends have gathered
Together all night long
They sing by the fire making memories
So many laughs and stories and new ones to come

It seems like they turned back time

It's a night to remember
Been friends since they were kids
They celebrate their friendship
That goes way back in time

As time goes by dawn is closing in
It's kinda sad this evening is coming to an end

It seems like they turned back time

It's a night to remember
Been friends since they were kids
They celebrate their friendship
That goes way back in time

It's a night to remember
Been friends since they were kids
They celebrate their friendship
That goes way back in time
