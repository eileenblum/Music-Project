Outside my window it's freezing cold
Snowflakes falling down from the sky
I tend to lose it during winter times
Really can not stand the cold

In constant motion my mind is set
Always reaching out for more
I'm in a dreamworld made of fantasies
Living in a time of joy

I can not stand myself complaining
Change the course of life
I need to measure up my life

Cause better times will come
Complaints are in vain
Better times will come
Keep the faith

I see the sunlight it brings my mind to dreams
Searching for some inner peace
Watching the ocean during summertime
Is exactly what I want to do

In constant motion my mind is set
Always reaching out for more
I'm in a dreamworld made of fantasies
Living in a time of joy

I feel the wind blow...calling out for me

I can not stand myself complaining
Change the course of life
I need to measure up my life

Cause better times will come
Complaints are in vain
Better times will come
Keep the faith

Cause better times will come
Complaints are in vain
Better times will come
Keep the faith

Cause better times will come
Complaints are in vain
Better times will come
Keep the faith
