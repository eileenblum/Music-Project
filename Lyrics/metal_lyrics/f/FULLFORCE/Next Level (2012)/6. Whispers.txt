Screaming silence increases the fear
Senses strung tight, determined to burst
Night closes in on the one who can't take
Lifted by memories

The whisper grows stronger as the mind...
...as the mind takes a dive

Whispers pounding fear in my heart
Whispers pounding fear in my head
I have to save me from myself
Now I'm longing for freedom
I have to be set free

Dark room shaped like a dungeon
Locked in, restrained, madness appear behind
A pair of eyes like a liquid pouring
Sanity shivers

The whisper grows stronger as the mind...
...as the mind takes a dive

Whispers pounding fear in my heart
Whispers pounding fear in my head
I have to save me from myself
Now I'm longing for freedom

Whispers pounding fear in my heart
Whispers pounding fear in my head
I have to save me from myself
Now I'm longing for freedom
I have to be set free

Whispers pounding fear in my heart
Whispers pounding fear in my head
I have to save me from myself
Now I'm longing for freedom

Whispers pounding fear in my heart
Whispers pounding fear in my head
I have to save me from myself
Now I'm longing for freedom
I have to be set free
