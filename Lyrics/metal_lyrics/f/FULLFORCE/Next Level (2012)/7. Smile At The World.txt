In the darkest hour
Hope is the last thing that will leave you,
Every day you learn something new
Gaming on edge.
Wipe away the tears and move on,
Donât waste your strangth carrying on.

Itâs time to leave it all behind,
Embrace the future with open arms.
Smile at the world and I promice you
It will smile back at you.

Doesnât need to cry,
The past is fadeing like a shadow,
Youâll find yourself in a paradise if you let go.
Try to find your dreams, belive in yourself.
Wipe away the tears and move on,
Donât waste your strangth carrying on.

Itâs time to leave it all behind
Embrace the future with open arms
Smile at the world and I promice you
It will smile back at you (Ooohâ¦)
Smile at the world (Oooâ¦)
Smile at the world

Itâs time to leave it all behind
Embrace the future with open arms
Smile at the world and I promice you
It will smile back at you
Smile at the world
There is no need to cry

Itâs time to leave it all behind
Embrace the future with open arms
Smile at the world and I promice you
It will smile back at you [2x]
