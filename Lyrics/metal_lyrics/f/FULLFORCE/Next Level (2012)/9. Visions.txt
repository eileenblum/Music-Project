I've lived through the ages
I've seen centuries pass
Wisdom has been my knowledge
Our world will soon cease to be

Man won't hear my pleas
Redemption is gone
I can't deny my fear
But, no one hears...me

Ancient seers with visions
At the altars of doom
I've become a preacher
'Cause I've been shown what is to come

All is lost, there's no return
Regrets can't change the world no more
I want to speak to everyone
But no one marks my words
The end is closing in

No one hears my prophecy
People have changed, no belief
I can't convince them
Modern times; computerized

I've seen the future
Mankind will destroy itself
My dreams are broken
Present times shows my failure

Ancient seers with visions
Showed me the altars of doom
I've become a preacher
'Cause I've been shown what is to come

All is lost, there's no return
Regrets can't change the world no more
I want to speak to everyone
But no one marks my words
The end is closing in

Ancient seers with visions
At the altars of doom
I've become a preacher
'Cause I've been shown what is to come

All is lost, there's no return
Regrets can't change the world no more
I want to speak to everyone
But no one marks my words
The end is closing in
