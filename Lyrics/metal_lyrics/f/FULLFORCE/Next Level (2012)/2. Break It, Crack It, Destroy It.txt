You are feeling the anger
Growing inside of you for no reason
You hit your elbow
And your reaction showed no mercy

Your enemy is your inner self

Break it, crack it, destroy it...is the solution for you
You find it hard to take it slow

Living out your aggression
By smashing dead things to calm you down
Nothing close to perfection
It's only you and your way to react

Your enemy is your inner self

Break it, crack it, destroy it...is the solution for you
You find it hard to take it slow

You're aware of your madness
But never questioned your behaviour
When you're feeling the fury
You can not help yourself, out of control

Your enemy is your inner self

Break it, crack it, destroy it...is the solution for you
You find it hard to take it slow

Break it, crack it, destroy it...is the solution for you
You find it hard to take it slow

Break it, crack it, destroy it...is the solution for you
You find it hard to take it slow
