People lost their faith in their old sacred land
Blood has been spilled some call it sacrifice
This is a new beginning based on ancient rites
The innocent is crying, never wanted this

Land of broken dreams
Reaching out for hope and love
There's a miracle
Put your faith in your heart and believe
No more broken dreams

So many innocent lives are wasted cause of this
The men in armour tries to rule their world
The innocent is crying, never wanted this

Land of broken dreams
Reaching out for hope and love
There's a miracle
Put your faith in your heart and believe
No more broken dreams

The innocent is crying, never wanted this

Land of broken dreams
Reaching out for hope and love
There's a miracle
Put your faith in your heart and believe
No more broken dreams
