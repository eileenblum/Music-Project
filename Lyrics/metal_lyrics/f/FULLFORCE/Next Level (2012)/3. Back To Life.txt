I can hear the screams from restless men
Everyone raise their glass to hail the world

So many smiling faces now they're free
Surviving soldiers came home

They're back to life, there's no more guns
No more slaughter, no more pain
A life to love so much more to gain
Back to life
They are back to life

Seen a darkened world only misery
Mentally brutalized, trained to kill

They will never go back to war
Never see the blazing guns

They're back to life, there's no more guns
No more slaughter, no more pain
A life to love so much more to gain
Back to life
...more to gain

They're back to life, there's no more guns
No more slaughter, no more pain
A life to love so much more to gain
Back to life
They're back to life, there's no more guns
No more slaughter, no more pain
A life to love so much more to gain
Back to life
