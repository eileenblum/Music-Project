So soft in the wind
Whistling on my cheek
I hear the crowd shouting
And everything is fine

No fear, no more
I feel invincible
I won't ever be struck down
I'll crush anything

Making way through obstacles
Never looking back
The emotion hotter than ever
Luck is on our side

Too late now for any regrets
The sun is high in the sky
Pulling me out of my shame
No one's stronger than I

Running wild on the road and the streets
Life has hold us out her hand
The battle will soon be over
Sword on the crowd
And the time then come for light to break

Making way through pain
Never going back
The solution is us more than ever
Strength is on our side

No use now for any regrets
The haste rises as I
Tell myself to build my own fate
No one's faster than I

The weak is crying still
But we won't let us down
Leave me be
You've got to set yourself free

The fate is sinking
Only ours is made is stone
Don't stop me now
I feel alive
If you're surrendering
Give it up now

Running wild on the road and the streets
Life has hold us out her hand
The battle will soon be over
Sword on the crowd
And the time then come for light to break

No excuses anymore
The time has come to stand tall
No wavering, no remorse
The time has come for us
We are breaking the light
