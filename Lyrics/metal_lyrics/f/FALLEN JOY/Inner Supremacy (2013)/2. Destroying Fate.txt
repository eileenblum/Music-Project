Surrounded by all those flaws 
The flesh survives 
While the soul is rippen apart 
The heart explodes 
Disappearing, all your dreams 
Leaving place to suffering 
Hollow is the machine 
Get a grip

Fear... Nothing remains 
Now, stop the train before crashing 
The clock's been ticking 
Anywhere but not there, walk 
Get the keys of your life from its hands

Keep the eyes open away from the sun 
And destroy fate 
The faithful one will spit on the sinner 
But never make the fury fade away

The brain's been broken dead 
No use to cry by yourself 
Your hero's rotting in his grave 
While you call endlessly 
Release the hatred 
Don't keep it down in your head 
Fight back and stand in its way 
And fight to death

Fear... Nothing remains 
Now, stop the train before crashing 
The clock's been ticking 
Anywhere but not there, walk 
Get the keys of your life from its hands

Keep the eyes open away from the sun 
And destroy fate 
The faithful one will spit on the sinner 
But never make the fury fade away

-

Keep the eyes open away from the sun 
And destroy fate 
The faithful one will spit on the sinner 
But never make the fury fade away

Left in the ashes and embers 
Illusion burns 
Upon the cross of sacred truth 
Imagine what reality could be

The flesh survives 
While the soul is rippen apart 
The heart explodes 
Disappearing, all your dreams 
Leaving place to suffering 
Hollow is the machine 
Get a grip
