The taste of the mud I 
Swallow and walk on again 
The scent of burning flesh 
Nausea's consuming my reason 
No fear of not being up 
To drive back the enemy 
The thought of turning back 
Won't ever cross my devoted mind

I Must 
Protect what I care for and sacrifice 
Myself 
I won't be your slave anymore

Now, running through my veins 
The anger is mine 
No notion of defeat 
Let's just roll the dice 
Blood floating in the air 
My rage is divine 
I've got the urge to rip 
The monster I despise

My heart is hanged upon 
A seal of passionate hatred 
Dreams of peace and freedom 
Stay mere dreams if you don't fight on 
Taking lifes on and on 
The story's not ready to end 
Hunting down the parasites 
They didn't conceive this child would bite

I Must 
Protect my country and sacrify 
Myself 
I won't be your slave anymore

Now, running through my veins 
The anger is mine 
No notion of defeat 
Let's just roll the dice 
Blood floating in the air 
My rage is divine 
I've got the urge to rip 
The monster I despise
