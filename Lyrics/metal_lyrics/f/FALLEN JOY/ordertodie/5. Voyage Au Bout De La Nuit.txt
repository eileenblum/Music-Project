I feel this on my own
In the shade of the flag
I don't wanna be down
Screw that, I wanna be alive!

I don't wanna share this kind of fate
Carrying the hopes of everyone
Those who don't give even a shit
If I die I'll have to be proud

I don't get anyone
sending me into a dark path
I don't wanna be thrown 
into this fucking bloody mess!

I don't wanna share this kind of fate
Carrying the hopes of everyone
Those who don't give even a shit
If I die I'll have to be blind...

Where is the light?
How to get out?
What the hell is that?
Worthless is my life...

Something is gonna blow
Noises behind my back
I don't wanna be lost
I'm crawling out of the fight!

I don't wanna share this kind of fate
Carrying the hopes of everyone
Those who don't give even a shit
If I die I'll have to be blind!

The sun is coming for me
Disrupting factitious peace
Red clouds are reuniting
forming a blood piss
I'm clinging to anything
Bring me far away
To see there's no escape

The rain is pouring down on me
Not clear and pure, dirty
Of men's pure foolishness
Hatred instigated
This war's been calling for me
I wish I had been deaf
Making a way through darkness
The exit I'm perceiving now

Alors je suis tombÃ© malade, fiÃ©vreux,
rendu fou par la peur
La meilleure des choses Ã  faire 
quand on est dans ce monde
Câest dâen sortir, fou ou pas, peur ou pas
