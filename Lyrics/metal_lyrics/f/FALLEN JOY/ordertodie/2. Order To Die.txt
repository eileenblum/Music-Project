I'm thinking on my own
for decades
about the power I own. Won't ever trade
Worms piling up in my way, out of my sight!
I'll just have to give...

...the order to die!

I won't fix up the things
I messed up
Don't you dare try
to make me believe I care!

I'm thinking on my own
for decades
about the power I own. Won't ever trade
Worms piling up in my way. Out of my sight!
I'll just have to give
the order to die!

I feel that in my brain
something broke
Why is that in this place I feel so cold?
Time will be up someday, I just know...
it's gonna be my turn...

...to die!
