Born from nowhere
Searching for something
A reason to live
A reason to be a piece of you
Trust the nation
A sort of unity
God of the mass
Land is above all of you!

Your hand pointed at the sky
You dream of a better world
The skull on your chest
Proves your superiority
Thousands of black flags
Flap under  a crimson sky
The dark wave is coming
You are just a part of it!

Born from hate
Seeking something
A reason to kill
A reason to dominate the subhuman
Trust your guide
Honor and loyalty
God of the brave
Faith is above all of you!

Since hundreds of years, our country was
better good to receive these elements
Although they possess nothing else than
political and physical infectious diseases
What they possess today, they have it in a very
wide measure, gained at the cost of our less
cunning nation!

What they possess today...
These words of wisdom
Resound every days in my head
I will show no mercy on the battlefield!

Die for hate
Crying for something
Into your veins
The power flows!
Trust yourself
The time has come
You are your own god
You are above all of them!

Is anything more glorious
than dying for one's country?
Men disappear but heroes live forever!
