Gathering on the blue sea
The wind is whipping their faces
All the crew is craving for flesh
It will come anyway soon
In their eyes is no confusion
Not any kind of hesitation
Suddenly the table has turned
Tonight some cowards will burn

Devastate and kill all over
They will now face the furor
Rape and make them taste the pain
In the next they'll know they should reign!

Entertaining women and child
By making them eat their own eyes
Stealing jewels gold and pearls
Everyone under the gaze of the birds
The only fool that could defy
us have been brought to die
Emptying the ship and the bellies
Leaving behind nothing but pieces

In those places
The sky has been so dark
For the people living there
Surviving has to become a game
There are those who chases
Glory and vanity, despair
is what they'll find
together

The storm, the waves shaking our heads
Arms and legs with no sensation left
About honor we don't care
No mercy for the weak one's pain
Stench of decay down the steps
A fool believed our submission
would go on, eternal nightmare
In the next life they'll know how to reign!
