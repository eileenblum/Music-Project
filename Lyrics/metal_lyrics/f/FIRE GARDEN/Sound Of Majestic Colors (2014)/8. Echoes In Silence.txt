The ashes of my agony
Scattered in the sky
The echoes in the silence
Are tearing me inside

The clock is ticking quietly
While I am suffering inside
All the scenes play back to me
Like a movie in my mind

Save me, save me from this darkness, save me

I am hiding from the sun
I am drowning in the mire
I am falling from the sky
I am dying in this skin

I am waiting and pretending
Thinking of eternal bliss
I am hearing broken lullabies
Is it something that I missed

Save me, save me from this darkness, save me

I am hiding from the sun
I am dying in this skin

Echoes in silences are killing me
All these echoes in silences are killing me

The silence of the echoes are just tearing me inside
All the heartache and the pain tempting me to die

Tonight I am questioning this life
The answer like always is denied
Will it ever be defined
In the end this lullaby is entire
Good bye
