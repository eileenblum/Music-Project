You, lost in the shadows of life
Words, you said to me faded like night
You, pretended to stay by my side
And I, left here for fate to decide

You, misled my heart left it to die
You, deceived me with every lie
You, lay in wait poised to consume
And I, left to the mercy of you

Can't feel anymore I try to cry
Feel like I am paralyzed
Ashes of my soul are all thatâs left
As I am now forsaken
