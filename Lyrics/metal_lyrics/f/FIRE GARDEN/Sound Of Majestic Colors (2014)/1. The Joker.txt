Iâm the root of all evil
Iâm the madness storm
I will crush all of your dreams
And steal your heart so warm

It's my game, you're all invited
No terms, no rules you need
I'm the one who rolls the dice
To challenge who will bleed

Get ready to play my game
I 'll leave you all in tears
You'll never be the same
Cause I will make you go insane

Arrogant enough to kill anyone
Evil enough to let you just die
You're lucky if you catch my bluff
Fear is all I want in your life

Trust is something that I never know
Love has never gotten too close
The hate is bathing all over me
I think the devil's inside of me

Get ready to play my game
I 'll leave you all in tears
You'll never be the same
Cause I will make you go insane

Shadows grows inside my soul
My brain is numb, my body's cold in bed
All these thoughts and memories
Of childhood dreams and reveries are dead

The demon inside me
Just knows how to find me
I sold my life
I pay the price
It's clear

The anguish deep inside my soul
Of all the hurt that make me whole is here

Get ready to play my game
I 'll leave you all in tears
You'll never be the same
Cause I will make you go insane
