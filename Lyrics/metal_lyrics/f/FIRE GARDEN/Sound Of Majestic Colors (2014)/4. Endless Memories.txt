I see you there inside an empty bed.
Visions of you are dancing in my head
I remember days when you belonged to me.
Now thereâs nothing left of us that I can see
Turning the pages in my book of life
Bringing back those moments that I put aside
Yeah

Come with me, follow me
My endless memories
Day or night along the ride
My endless memories

All these clouds are beckoning
Every word I say
Drifting to my destiny
I try to fly away

I get the feeling coming from inside
Memories of you are clouding up my mind

Following my way into the aisles
With every step I hope to survive
Is there a lifeline I still canât decide
Should I live in this moment or let it all die

Come with me, follow me
My endless memories
Day or night along the ride
My endless memories
