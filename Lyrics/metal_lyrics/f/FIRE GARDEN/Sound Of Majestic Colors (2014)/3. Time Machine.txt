I am traveling through time
Leaving the past behind
Let me tell you what I see
Lucidly

I see darkness taking light
I see no end to this in sight
I feel the very air I breathe
Suffocating me

This life has lost its soul
This time has missed its goal

We managed an all-time low
Succeeded at failing so
Greed gave us an endless fall
In the end weâve lost it all

Fast forward to a place
Countless years beyond our time
The crimes our hands have wrought
Nonexistence it brought

I canât decide to leave or love
This world became a big confusion
Will the darkness ever end?
Can our humanity rescind?

We managed an all-time low
Succeeded at failing so
Greed gave us an endless fall
In the end weâve lost it all
[Spoken words]
