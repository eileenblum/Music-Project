Everyday life seems to be the same
Finding another reason to stay
I keep turning to the past
Feel Iâm moving in a maze
Keeping this burden inside of me

Can someone tell me the reason
Why my dreams keep fading away

I am trying to understand to ease my pain
I am trying to keep sane to burn again

Day by day I pretend to be brave
Lie to myself each and every day
Never facing the truth, I keep the voices to myself
This madness inside my head

Can someone tell me the reason
Why are my hopes breaking away

Now I break free from misery
I feel so much closer to heaven
Shedding my skin and Iâm leaving this shell
Strengthening myself to rise
like the sun once again

Can someone tell me the reason
Why I am falling from grace

I am trying to understand to ease my pain
I am trying to keep sane to burn again
