When you are looking for serenity
They take your desire

Fake the spirit and their sage
Killing in the name of God

They pledge your soul to them
They promise you a heaven in back

The real evil behind their face
Is really not visible to you

The hex halo over their head
Is really not visible to you

The deadly sin upon their soul
Is really not visible to you

The hateful person behind their face
Is really not visible to you

Affection turns to pain
When you donât realize
Their darkest desire
Fades you to black
