The silence in the air
And the darkness in the sight
The questions are raised
And the answers are hard to find
I am waiting like a stone
In this moonless cold night
and suffering the pain
I am hoping to survive

I am drowning in endless sorrow
Screaming in empty silence
I am stumbling over and over
Scarlet tears are shedding from

My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart

Waiting, fading, breaking from Inside
Falling, dying, killing Inside
Is this real or
Is this suicide?

I only came here
To seek redemption
I am awake now
And see the light

Give me your hand
And take me out of here
If only you can help me

Take me out of here
If only you can help me
Take me out of here
If only you can save me

I am drowning in endless sorrow
Screaming in empty silence
I am stumbling over and over
Scarlet tears are shedding from

My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart
I guess I am free now
