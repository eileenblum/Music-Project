Everyday I ask myself will I survive?
Precious moments of my past just fade to white
I am burning from inside

In this moment in the dark, I try to hide
Is time moving forward now, I canât decide
I am trying to find myself

It's hard to tell, it's hard to see
It's hard to take and believe
This last step can I pull it off?
Can I win this war?

[Spoken words]
No one can hear my voice
What I am feeling from inside
At this moment at this time
Hope one can realize
Millions of people looking at me
Shouting my name
This moment might not come again
In my life, in their lives
Guess I realize

The sun is coming down
I am fading in the dark
The grim tunnel surrounds me
I am drowning all inside

Now it's time to face it real
I am not scared to fail
Now it's time to seal the deal
I am not scared to fall
Oh yeah...

It's hard to tell, it's hard to see
It's hard to take and believe
This last step can I pull it off?
Can I win this war?
