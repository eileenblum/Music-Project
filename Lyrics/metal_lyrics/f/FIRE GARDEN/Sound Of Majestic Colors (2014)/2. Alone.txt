How to define, and reveal
But no-one understands and nobody cares
How to hide, pain in my soul
They never realize and they never know

I am alone

I am living, in spite
I am coming undone
I am broken into pieces
I am falling apart

Cold in my bed, with another sleepless night
I am trying to heal, better this way
Trying to hide, trying to cry
Too cowardly to live
I am afraid to die

I am alone
I am living, in spite
I am coming undone
I am broken into pieces
I am falling apart

I am alone
I am living, in spite
I am coming undone
I am broken into pieces
I am falling apart
