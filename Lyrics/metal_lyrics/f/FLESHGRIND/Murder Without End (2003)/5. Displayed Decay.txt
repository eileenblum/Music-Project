Your blood decorates
The walls of my mind
It's your soul I take
Your dread is now enshrined

As you lay there limp and fragile
I observe your every thought
Your mind is completely mangled
broken down you drift away
I cherish these manic moments
Skin so soft and deathly cold
How I envy you...
As your torment nears it's end

With trembling fear
You open your eyes to your demise
Watching you writhe, I realize
It's your suffering that I love
I can not deny!

You cannot defy me!

Watching your life, slip away
Your eyes roll back I start to hack
Display my decay!

Frozen, fearful stare
Tantalizes me
Drowning in depair
I wait patiently!

I will sit here waiting
For as long as it takes
To put you where I need you
Destroy your fucking life
Accept your fucking fate
You have surely earned it
So sit there and suffer
Atoning your ways...

With trembling fear
You open your eyes to your demise
Watching you rise, I realize
It's your suffering that I love
I can not deny!

You cannot defy me!

Watching as your life, slip away
You cant think back, your life turns black
Display my decay!
