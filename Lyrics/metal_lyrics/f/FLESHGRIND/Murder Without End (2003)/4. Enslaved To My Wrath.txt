I can see into your feeble mind
The weakness the lies within
Exploited subconsciousness

As we travel down into the darkness
That lies within you
You can see that I'm your only hope
Only light and salvation

Plead for me....plead for me to let you go!

Sorrow deepens, hatred building
Void of all that needs to be
Terror mounting, start the bleeding
As your mind adorns my wrath

You are now enslaved to my wrath
Forever in my grasp
Now you'll be enslaved to my wrath [2x]

Come into my world of pain
I am what you desire
Thousands before you have
Endured my infliction of suffering

My grasp holds you
Forever choking
Your overwhelming hunger
For punishment drives you
Time and time again!...Plead for me to let you go!

Sorrow deepens, hatred building
Void of all that needs to be
Terror mounting, start the bleeding
As your mind adorns my wrath

You are now enslaved to my wrath
Forever in my grasp
Now you'll be enslaved to my wrath [2x]

IÂ am always with you
Embedded in your soul
Your addiction to terror
Your desire for torture

You are now enslaved to my wrath
Forever in my grasp
Now you'll be enslaved to my wrath

I am always with you
Embedded in your soul
Your addiction to terror
Your desire for torture

You are now enslaved to my wrath
Forever in my grasp
Now you'll be enslaved!
