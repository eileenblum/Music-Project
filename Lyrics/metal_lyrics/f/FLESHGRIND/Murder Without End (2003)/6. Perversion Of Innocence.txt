Innocence in bliss
Young, naive, and fertile
Your sinlessness leads to my
Corrupting your purity
As I permeate your reality
Infecting your mind, cleaning my soul
Perverting your innocence
With my deviance!
Now you will see how it feels to be
Demoralized and brutalized
My impervious grasp is never ending
Absolute desecration
Let the lechery begin, acquaint you with sin
Its time to relinquish your chastity
Spread those lily white legs..
This might hurt a bit..This might hurt for fucking ever!
For fucking ever!
The pain runs through you
Collects in your mind
Pleasure of a different kind
You will fucking see
My ghastly art
Taking form
On your flesh, perversion of innocence..
Overwhelming guilt
About what you have done
Will it stop? Perpetual agony
Horrific, haunting thoughts
Consume your soul
As I crush your fucking will to live!
Excessive. blinding pain
Subdues my restraint
As you contemplate your lifes worth
The revulsion in your eyes
Sustains my rage
Look at me!
Satisfy my murderous greed!

My murderous greed!

The pain runs through you
Collects in your mind
Pleasure of a different kind
You will fucking see
My ghastly art
Taking form
On your flesh, perversion of innocence..
Let me hear you, be me for your fucking end
Let me see you, display your ecstacy in misery
Let me feel you, as you grasp for one last breath
Let me kill you, as if you were'nt already dead!
Perverting your innocence!
With my deviance!
