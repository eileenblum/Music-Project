From the womb of hell, most vilest of sadists
Without emotion, skillfull as a surgeon
Deep in the subconscious, dormant bestial seed
Extinction is what I breed!

Explosion of violence, claiming all lives around me,
Churning and whirling, inflicting fatality..
I was born to murder the world!

Adorned, in my victims blood
Wanton, disregard for human life
Puritan, cleanse the world of filth
Unholy, scenery of tyranny!

Explosion of violence, claiming all lives around me,
Churning and whirling, inflicting fatality..
I was born to murder the world!

Cruelly amusing, my suffering has eased
Though bloodlust cannot be appeased
A hardened heart that will not bend,
MURDER WITHOUT END!
