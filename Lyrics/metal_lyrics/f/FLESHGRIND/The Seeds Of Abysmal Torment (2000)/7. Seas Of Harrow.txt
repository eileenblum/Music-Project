I rejoice from the grief
Your incessant pain brings
Such gratification

As I reign sovereign over you!
Escape is unthinkable
Your pain is unbearable

Escape is unthinkable
Your pain is unbearable!
I don't sympathize as you are trapped
Within your own dimensions and grief

Within the abysmal waters where you drown
Within the seas of harrow!
Within the abysmal waters where you drown
Within the seas of harrow!

Within the abysmal waters where you drown
Within the seas of harrow!
Within the abysmal waters where you drown
Within the seas of harrow!

My dominance prevails as you beseech me for guidance
Through your amaranthine misery
You have been reduced to nothing
I am the father of pain, now proven through you!
