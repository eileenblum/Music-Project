Cursed into reality, a hopeless netherworld
Where your fear culminates, wretchedness prevails
Mastering your misery, call upon your agony!

Look to me for I am the one who dominates your soul
Look to me for I am the one, destroy your only hope
Mastering your misery, call upon your agony!

I will make you see the horror
Conjuring your every thought
Twisted rapture manifesting

Terrorizing your worthless being
Tearful, useless, imprecations
Illustrates your weakness

Decrepit being
Crawling, scratching
Fingers gripping

Where do you think you are going?
There's no escaping
From this dominion

You are now fucked!
Summoning all my hate
Choking you

Gasping for your last breath
I will not let you leave this existence
You have failed you fucking fool, this is forever!
