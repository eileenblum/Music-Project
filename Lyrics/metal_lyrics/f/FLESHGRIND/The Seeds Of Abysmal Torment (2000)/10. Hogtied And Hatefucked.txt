My face shapes a cruel smile
My tainted embrace, firmly around your throat
Breath coming quicker,

To the tune of your stifled cries
I bask in the soiled femininity
And the squeals of my stultified sow

Where pleasures and pain blend as one
My bonds, though macabre, have found warmth
The cold steel and iron on tender flesh

Restrained, yet erotic, I have you bound
Your pain arouses my senses
Your agony is my ecstasy!
Your shame, I leave its mark embedded in your flesh

It burns, it binds, my ropes caress your transient veneer
Precious little pig... slender and pale
So tempting a victim!

Sadistically, I probe your most inner moistness
Arouse my disgust!

Tainted, my member, with your filthy secretions
Arouse my delight!
With lust, I tremble at the sight of your writhing
Consumed by desire!

The redolence of your debauched, violated cunt
Consumes my desires!

Though sincere, those tears are futile
Ravished and deflorated
Though sincere, those tears are futile
Ravished and deflorated ...
Then left alone! [4xs]

When pleasure and pain blend as one
Then left alone!
Your agony is my ecstasy
Then left alone!
