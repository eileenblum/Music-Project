Unstoppable Killings
Driven by greed and power
A troop of desensitized soldiers

Built to abolish all
That challenge this obdurate machine
Emotionless murder

Audacious and indiscriminate
It's exorbitant capacity is immeasurable
Hundreds executed
These devils never lie quiescent

Fueled by their rage and desire for control
These devils never lie quiescent
Fueled by their rage and desire for control
DESIRE...FOR...CONTROL!!

Soldiers who terminate life
Jut as god promiscuously kills
Just as promiscuously as life itself kills
Just as I promise your time will come

That you will be killed! [2x]

Humanity left frightened
And surreptitous, covert, cloaked
In this underworld benighted

By plagues, and calamities
Quarrels, fatal confrontations
Devastating needs for imperium

Emotionless murder
Audacious and indiscriminate
It's exorbitant capacity is immeasurable

Hundreds executed
These devils never lie quiescent

Fueled by their rage and desire for control
These devils never lie quiescent
Fueled by their rage and desire for control!
DESIRE...FOR...CONTROL!! 

Soldiers who terminate life
Jut as god promiscuously kills
Jut as promiscuously as life itself kills
Just as I promise your time will come

That you will be killed! [2x]
