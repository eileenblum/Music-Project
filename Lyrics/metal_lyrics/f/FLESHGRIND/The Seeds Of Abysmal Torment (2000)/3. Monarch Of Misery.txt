Imploring the abstract
Needs undefined
Contemptible and devious
A corroded reality

Your everlasting fear, so stimulating
As you conform to the blackness of my thoughts

Imagine such lunacy
My lust is becoming climatic
As is the horror I see in your eyes

Monarch of misery
Imploring the abstract
Needs undefined

Contemptible and devious
A corroded reality
Your everlasting fear, so stimulating
As you conform to the blackness of your thoughts

Imagine such lunacy
My lust is becoming climatic
As is the horror I see in your eyes

Monarch of misery
Feel the treachery
In my misery!
