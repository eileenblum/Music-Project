I have the tenacity to take what is yours,
As you will forever persevere, you are mine!
Take what I give, my unceasing punishment

My fading of lives, drainer of desires
Watching your mind slowly demise
Bringing me pleaseure, this is my contentment

Consuming my sanity, raping your thoughts
Violating, incessantly, your bruised, tainted flesh!

Destroying your will, to lavish my own!
You feed from my hate, I leave you in sorrow
With thoughts of empathy you feel you deserve
Draining what is mine, fainting your fortitude
Your conscience realizes your inevitably nothing!
You feed from my hate, I leave you in sorrow
With thoughts of empathy you feel you deserve
Draining what is mine, fainting your fortitude

Destroying your will to lavish my own!
You're becoming desolate of your sources
A useless, monumental, misery

A portrait of what once was
As I strip you of all your worth
Beg me for your soul

I detest your empty carrion
As you wear your shroud of sadness

I will destroy your will!
Destroying your will, to lavish my own!

You feed from my hate, I leave you in sorrow
With toughts of empathy you feel you deserve
Draining what is mine, fainting your fortitude
Your conscience realizes your inevitably nothing!
You feed from my hate, I leave you in sorrow

With thoughts of empathy you feel you deserve
Draining what is mine, fainting your fortitude
Destroying your will to lavish my own!
