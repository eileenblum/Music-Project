I wil take your soul!!!
Come into my chamber of obscurity
Why don't you come with me

Where violence is pleasure and so sweet
Horrible certainty
Never mind the blood stained walls, the human bones

They're just a memory
The putrid stench of rotten flesh is sickening
A fragrance that I love

As I lure you into my chamber
Your skin turns a ghostly white
Submit now to my ghastly pleasures

or suffer the consequence
As I rape the life out of you
your life seems so worthless

Chamber of obscurity
Wretched and unthinkable
Torture and depravity

Chamber of obscurity
As you start to gasp for air, to plead for your life
You won't be living long

You start to bleed, you start to choke
the swelling starts
Beatings will never stop

As you lay in your own piss and feces
Vomit spews from your mouth
You feel like the lowest form of human life
a life that will soon be gone

As I lure you into my chamber
Your skin turns a ghostly white
Submit now to my ghastly pleasures
or suffer the consequence

As I rape the life out of you
your life seems so worthless

Chamber of obscurity
Wretched and unthinkable
Torture and depravity

Chamber of obscurity!
