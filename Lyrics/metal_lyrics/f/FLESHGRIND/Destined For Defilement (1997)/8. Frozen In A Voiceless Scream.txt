In your terror
Whipers in the somber night
Frozen in a voiceless scream
Reflections of your life are senseless

Hoping for a second chance
The dark wind calls your name
ever so gently
Imminent death is here

Cannot be accepted
Fearing your end, your life has expired
In your terror
Whispers in the somber night

Out of sight, You are
Frozen in a voiceless scream
In your last breath
The dark wind closes in
Your time has come

To leave this pathetic
world of shit, of shame
This life that you've chosen

To rebel against
to turn your back on
has repaid you
in full with your life

Dishonor of your family has left you
Frozen in a voiceless scream
