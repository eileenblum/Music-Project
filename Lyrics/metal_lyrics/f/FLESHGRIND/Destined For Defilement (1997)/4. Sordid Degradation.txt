Expressionless
Your limp now dead body
I have seen the death and horror

That makes me want to spew!
...Spew...

Writhing, contorting unleashing your soul
Your shrilling is music to my ears
Your terror in your eyes before you die
excites me

The illusion of you living is now gone
As you slowly slip away
My pleasure grows as you decay

As you think
Though of hopelessness
How much longer can this be

The hopelessness and agony
As you scream
Please God let me live
Screaming anguish never ending
Pleasure growing never dying

As you die
..Forgotten..
Memories and have been forgotten

You are no one just a passing victim
For my pleasures for my fornication
For your nightmares, for your satisfaction

Sordid Degradation!
