Deep in the rainforest of Brazil
A tribe of fornicators
The raping ceremony from long ago

To violate the newborn
Once the infant is out of the womb
The village starts to line up

The baby is raped everyday of his birth
Until the day of his death
The elder fuck the younger ones
the young ones rape the elder

Primitive perversions
Retarded children are being born
Abuse the mother after labor

All they do is rape and fuck
Orally... anally... incest...
Sodomoize the tribal chief

Anally invade the ugly wife
Pull her by the fucking hair
Jam a dick into her mouth

Listen to her gurgle cum
Like the fucking whore she is
Brutally raped by your best friend
Ambushed by behind, the bastard

What can you do its tradition?
Beat and gang raped by four others
Taking turns while they're laughing

But you know their days are coming
It's a lovely young girl's day
When the village takes their turn

They tie her to a wooden post
She starts to scream
She's knocked unconscious
and then probed with a fist

Starts to bleed profusely
From her tight little ass
Raping... fucking... it's tradition, can't escape it
Rape Culture
