The smell of burning cinder
The crackle and pop of human flesh
The screams of my victims

I hear as I fade into the dark
Sit around the corner
With success in my obession

As I admire my work of art
Molotovs, gasoline, or a match
Or through any technique

I know how to acheive
To work my work of wonder
To my pure delight!

I want to see it burn, I wanna see you burn
The more people I can burn, the better I feel
I want to see it burn, I want to see you burn!

Sometimes I see my victims
Choke on the dense smoke
But the ones I like best are

Burnt running flesh
See my victims running and rolling
Trying to put themsleves out

But I have them in my trap
Of death and fire
There is nowhere to run
There is nowhere to hide
There is no way out

Surrounded by fire, engulfed in flames
I want to see you burn alive!!
I want to see it burn, I wanna see you burn

The more people I burn, The better I feel
I want to see it burn, I want to see you burn!
I want to play a game of smoke and fire

I want to burn your house to fulfill my lust
My heart starts beating fast as I douse your house
I know in a few minutes my goal will be achieved

Burn your house to the ground!
Burn it down!!!!!
