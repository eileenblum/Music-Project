[Lyrics by Richard Medina, Music by Fall of Empyrean]

This life is so unfair
And the world
Just doesn't care
This hurt I have inside
Has nowhere left to hide

Release from this prison
There is truly no reason
To go on in this hell
Cleanse the earth of myself

Left with such distress
Each day a fucking mess
The happiness has died
My death I can't deny

I place a bag
Over my head
And tie a rope
Around my neck

The air grows thin
A solemn state
How great it feels
To suffocate
