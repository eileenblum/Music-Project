[Lyrics by Richard Medina, Music by Fall of Empyrean]

A great land
Once flourished with life
Once had shined so bright,
Grows dim

Humanity, denied their
Only right to life,
Has died

The earth, now just a shell
Of a world we once knew
Before it withered away

So peaceful yet bleak
The light and the warmth
Of the sun is gone
Left in space to decay

The stars have left the sky
So black, in the dark of night
The cold of an endless chill
The air is so still

The air is so still.
