[Lyrics by Richard Medina, Music by Fall of Empyrean]

The dawn breaks
From this peaceful sleep,
I awake
I breathe the air
Enjoy the beauty of life
Without despair

The joy I feel,
To be alive
Just seems to unreal
I make my way out
To face the world,
To start this day

But something seems so wrong
Where has everyone gone?
There are no signs of life
Did they all just die?
Why did they
Just leave me here
To live with this misery?

I look around
Is there one soul
Left to be found?
My growing fear is
That there really is
No one here

Whispers heard all around me
But speak not a word
It has to be
All in my head
Or is this all a dream?

The memory of the past
Continues to haunt me
Playing tricks with my mind
Only one cure
For this disease
Searching for the bitter end
There's no reason to go on
And end to life
Just seems right
To join the others
Who have died
A land so vast
Now desolate at last
