[Lyrics by Richard Medina, Music by Justin Burning]

The earth you see
Resembles me
A cold and dark disturbing place
A world of god turned to disgrace

A new day has come
The suffering begun
The beauty you once knew is gone
Disappearing with the birth of dawn

Cries, as the searing sun appears
Through your eyes and deep inside
Fear, of this excruciating pain
You run to hide and question why

[Chorus]
A prophet spoke of this pain
But you chose to just ignore
You turned away, betrayed
The feelings you had in your heart

The seeds of humanity will be defiled
Until the end of time, you see
The visions you cannot deny

The destructive light of dawn
Each day, grows so very strong

Why can't you accept the truth
Your souls have died and
Your God has too
Blasphemy, a new life for you
Still you pray and an end
You can't comprehend
The sights you see in front of you
The light that burns keeps haunting you

You could not describe
The horrors that you see here
An epic tragedy
Lives controlled by fear
Sure catastrophe

As the sun drifts closer
Scorching all on earth
They never will recover

[Repeat chorus]

Unrelenting, this heat you can't bear
Life is filled with torment and great despair
The end approaching with every new day
As you face extinction and cannot be saved

Where is your God now that nothing is left
He abandoned you and now
Laughs at your death
The sun is here and the earth is in flames
What was once the way is now dead in space
