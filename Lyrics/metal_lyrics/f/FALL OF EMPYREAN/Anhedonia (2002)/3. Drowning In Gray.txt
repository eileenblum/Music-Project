[Lyrics by Richard Medina, Music by Justin Burning]

I sit in my room
To contemplate
All the reasons why
Why am I here, why must I live
Through these grieving times
Overwhelmed by hurt
Deep inside my soul
A quick ending to this all
I lose my self-control

With the noose clutched in my hands
You can't understand
This blatant travesty
Has become part of me

Drifting through the seas of sorrow

Condemned to
Fade away from my life,
From the lies
I place the rope around my throat
And close my eyes
Falling down towards the ground
The choking sounds
Finally I will see the way

Though something went wrong
I am still alive
Trapped in misery
Forever, in agony

They find me hanging
From a tree
Bleeding, pleading
Please don't set me free
Releasing the rope
From around my swollen neck
They bring me down
Refusing to let me rest

Why didn't they leave
Me in my misery
For all the world to see
They must hate me

They place me in a room
No windows I could see
They think insanity
Is what ails me
They test me everyday
But can't see the way
Into my barren mind
To see what they could find

I fall into a state
They call it catatonia
So helpless,
They have left me there
Never to awake
But they have made
A great mistake

Drifting through an endless sea

Condemned to
Fade away from my life,
From the lies
A dormant sleep that won't last,
To their surprise
I will awake from this state, 
From this pain
Finally, they will see the way
