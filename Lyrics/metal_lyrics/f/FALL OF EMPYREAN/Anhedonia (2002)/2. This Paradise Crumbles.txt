[Lyrics by Richard Medina, Music by Justin Burning]

This life you lead
Seems to bring you
All the happiness you need
The ones you love
In your times of grief

The tears of joy
Stream from your eyes
From the peace that you feel
From the love inside

Through how could this last
For so very long
Then one day it turns
And it all goes wrong

[Chorus]
This happiness in your life
Has now turned to bitter strife
You wonder what went wrong inside
All you touch just seems to die
The beauty that you adored
Seems to be so ignored
By a God in which you believe
But has turned to deceit

Those you love slowly die in your arms
Their blood soaks your hands
And won't wash away

The skies turn gray
Rain storms to the ground
The air thick, so black
The walls come down

The disease spreads
It kills without a sound
This crumbling paradise
No more life to be found

[Repeat Chorus]

What was once such a peaceful land
Has quickly turned to waste
Its tears of blood that
Begin to flow down his beaten face
His mournful cries tells
Tales of the decades of his pain
He's lost his mind, descending downward, 
Drowning deep in gray
