[Lyrics by Richard Medina]
[Music by Cristobal Felix]

The light that burns within
Is the key to life
In all mankind
Though how will it last?
An answer that they
Could never find

A flame once strong
Flickers in the breeze
Life as we know will end
Freeing the earth of disease

They fall away
Like the leaves of a dying tree
The flame of life will come
To be but a dream
A faint glimmer of hope
Will still exist in time
But will fade away
With the dying light

The earth will uncreate
Handing man its own fate
With the fall of this race
The earth becomes
A peaceful place...
