[Lyrics by Richard Medina]
[Music by Justin Burning &amp; Cristobal Felix]

Why can't they
See the dark
Inside of me
Deep within me...

They expect me
To put on a smiling face
They want me happy
But I can't lie
As I wipe away the tears
That stream down my face

The beauty they see
In this atrocious world
Has forgotten me in this life
I enjoy the misery
That breeds inside me

Please tell me why...

Happiness is a cruel myth
It eludes me every time
Creating a void in my life
Even just the thought of love
Is fantasy in this day and age
Nowhere left for me to hide
From this self-inflicted rage

Sleep, my only escape
From this pain
As I live inside a dream
Or so it seems
A perfect world
That never will exist again
This torment deep inside
Won't end

My life in ruins, I can't pretend
Darkness shrouds my every move
My mind is all that's left to lose
Sinking further every day
How could I live this way?
Defeated in this futile war
I cannot take this anymore

The light of the world
Grows dim in my eyes
As they bleed
Promises of a good life
Turn to lies before me

Save me from myself
This just isn't right
The want, the fear, the pain...

I cry myself to sleep every night
I feel I've lost the fight
The hurt never leaves
From my life
I slowly die inside

Is there a cure for this disease?
Or will I die in misery?
The pleasure in my life is gone
How did I last this long?

There was a time I had seen
The beauty of mankind
And unbridled love
Now I feel the anguish
Trapped within my soul
As I give in
The end is here for me
In this lifetime
Welcoming my demise
