[Lyrics by Richard Medina]
[Music by Cristobal Felix &amp; Justin Burning]

I stand on the edge of life
Staring down
Into a sea of despair
Why did I even seem
To really care?

Reflecting on my life
And what it once was
Recalling the glory
The peace, the joy, the love

[Chorus:]
Was it all but a lie?
A promise of better times...

A gleam of hope
For my soul?
Or the loss of all control?
All alone
And left in thought
A battle that was never fought
In a world so unkind
As I slowly lose my mind...

A vision of me
Left without a cause
A sad display
And must be wrong

But continues to show
My life's defeat
Giving way
To this fucking misery

Sending me
Into a fit of rage
Bringing upon
The end of days
Killing me slow
Until it takes my life
Arteries cut with the blade
Of my knife

[Repeat Chorus]

The anger
That it makes me feel
Invokes a pain
So surreal
Now that I've lost it all
Into emptiness I fall
