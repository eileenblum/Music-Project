[Lyrics by Richard Medina &amp; Steven Henson]
[Music by Justin Burning]

How could I
Have been so blind?
Success was meant for
The chosen ones in life
Not for me
The lies to myself must end
No reason to believe

[Chorus:]
I knew that it was coming
But I did not prepare
The final rejection
Filled with utter grief

I could have been angry
Like I was in the past
But this time, I clutched
The grip of failure's hand

The tears that I've wept
Were never ones of joy
But streams of burning
For the chosen ones
How many times must I fail
While they succeed?

Take it all away
This hurt inside
It's killing me
I can't even try...
So plain to see
The victories in life
Are not meant for me
Just here to die

[Repeat Chorus]
