[Lyrics by Richard Medina, Music by Justin Burning]

The beauty of eternal darkness
Now spreads across this land
Changing our reality
The end of time has come for man

Barren wastelands
With nothing left alive
Withered vegetation
Where no light ever shines

Searing winds have scorched the earth
A new beginning is given birth
The water thickened and painted red
From all of those who have bled...

Cascading rivers of black
Flow with blood from the dead

Now the time has come
For us to reign
Misery is given life
Through everlasting pain
