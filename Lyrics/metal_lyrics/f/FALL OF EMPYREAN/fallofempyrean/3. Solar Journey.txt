[Lyrics by Richard Medina, Music by Justin Burning]

I stand alone now
In this ruined world
Desolation was caused
By futile wars
For those who fought
Are all dead and gone
Though constant battle
Has made me so very strong

As I take a look around
At this dying earth
There is nothing left for me
So what must occur
Dark revelations
Embrace my tortured mind
The solar journey
Is the only path I find

The time has come to leave this place
Drift alone in deep space
Journey towards the burning sun
Back to where it all begun

I board my vessel
And head for the stars
Through this cosmic trail
I will travel so far
Enjoy the serenity
Here alone in space

This solar journey will
Take me back in time
To defy the ways of God
And all mankind
Returning to the ways
Of everlasting pain
Where chaos is the law
And blood falls like rain

Now approaching the sun
It's burning my skin
Blistering flesh appears
Final descent into the flames
Finally the end is here
I couldn't imagine
That the pain I will feel
Is worse than before
Exploding within
This journey complete
As I pierce through the core

There in front of me is my destiny
To invade the world
Of the holy trinity
To bring it down is my master plan
As the war begins I make my final stand

The time has come to burn this place
Annihilate the human race
Showing them that I am the way
The world never thought
It would see the day

Now that I come to this journey's end
My mission is completed with their death
Returning to a place that I call home
To suffer forever all alone
