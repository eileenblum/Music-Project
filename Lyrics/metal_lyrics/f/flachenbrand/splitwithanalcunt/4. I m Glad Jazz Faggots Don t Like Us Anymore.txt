we just wanted to sound like shit
but you thought we were avant garde
you thought we went to art school
but we worked at gas stations

you thought we were cool
but you diden't know we hate you
you thought we were cool
fuck off all you fucking faggots

you diden't know we were a bunch of assholes
you thought we were liberal and arty
you tried to act wierd and pretend you were violent
when I whipped chairs at you, you can off and cried

you thought we were cool
but you diden't know we hate you
you thought we were cool
fuck off all you fucking faggots

once you realized we hate people like you
you finally stopped coming to our shows
now there's less faggots, less people with glasses
less know it all eggheads, no more jazz fags

you thought we were cool
but you diden't know we hate you
you thought we were cool
fuck off all you fucking faggots
