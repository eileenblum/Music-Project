Someone puts you up to it
When you're alone
I think those you believed in
And you loved, and for whom you wanted
To become the best and with those
You'd feel great and tranquilly.

You become older, years pass by
But think; don't leave the others behind,
Try to trust them,
Cause you felt so great with them

And where are they now? Have they betrayed you?
No, just you're the very person,
Who made the wrong choice.
You want to change everything.
It's unlikely to happen, but!

And what about love? Will you also replace it?
That's true! Time treats everything,
But the scars are not likely to heal.
There's so little love in you,
But give yourself one more chance,
Believe in yourself and in the others.
Is it unlikely? But!...
