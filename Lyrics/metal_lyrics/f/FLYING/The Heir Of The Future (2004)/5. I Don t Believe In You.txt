This night we are not together
The mist of another delight
And tomorrow well look for the date
Somebody'll be in nervous, somebody will cry.

Finding each other - passion burns us
But falsehood hides inside
If promises soon to burst
And it wont be place for love any more

Perceive your game - play faster in mine with you
What are you waiting from me?
- Oh, yes, defeat again
But I don't trust us. I don't trust myself
Tell me, how can I believe in you?

Everybody knows all about everyone, but they keep silent
And tomorrow our place will belong to them
Were young, we look for something, treading our feelings in mud
While betraying, we despise
