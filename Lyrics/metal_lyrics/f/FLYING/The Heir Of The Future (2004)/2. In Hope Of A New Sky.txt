When I'm standing on the edge of precipice
And sea is shaking down
With its strong waves against the coast
And somewhere far away the horizon is seen 
That horizon, where sea and sky are the same 
And strong northern wind
Is shaking me in the chest.
I take a look in the sky!
In a wonderful blue northern sky
Which beckons and calls my imagination
And also myself
Its white - grey clouds are following above me
Shaking my imagination and fantasies
With its beautiful and powerful forms
Sky is so deep blue above my head, that sometimes 
I think I see the silence of space
But as far my look is going to the north
As the sky becomes more and more blue
Its calls me!
All sounds, coming in my interior
Noise of waves and smell of sea
Cold but nice wind
Cry of birds, flying high above the sea
All voice of blue northern sky
Covers me with its blanket and takes me away,
Far away, for the limits of my consciousness 
And subconsciousness,
For the limits of my imagination and fantasies
It takes me to another world
Where I can't feel the reality Where I will see my bright blue sky forever!
