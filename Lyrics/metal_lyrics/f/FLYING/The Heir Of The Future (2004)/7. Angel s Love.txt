Only angel can love in such way
So devotedly, truly and easily.
Suffer from inflicted wounds,
Being grieved of injuries.

Your wish is to keep your feelings
In the insane burst you appeal to the light
And returning the hope
You recall yourself to life.

Your call of energy draws me
And leads to the lifepower.
It makes me believe in my strength,
It saves me from the gulf and disaster.

Only angel can love in such way,
Keeping the hope untouched.
But when you know your fate
Will you forgive me?
