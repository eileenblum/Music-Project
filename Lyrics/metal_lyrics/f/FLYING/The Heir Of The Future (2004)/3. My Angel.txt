How young are you but how can finely comprehend.
You feel me and know how to understand.
You reveal all my secret thoughts
And truth you tell me mine!

More often declaring your love to me,
For my reciprocal one you wait.
But you call it insincere and
Just a gesture of considerate attachment.

My faults and weaknesses you find out,
Reproach, kiss and forgive me,
When I start again to try
Be over others!

You love, you wait and try to help.
You keep worried but don't lose your heart.
You lead me with confidence
And safe me like an angel 

You call me to love and return to life!
