Burning all the limbs 
Wounding my pulsing heart 
Carving my soul that doesn't 
Belong to me as well as my heart

In you are my feelings 
My bright flash 
Whom I met 
On my lonely way

Now I'm not the one 
I used to be

I don't recognize myself 
In front of me there's only 
The fire that absorbed us 
Appealing to you who subdued me 
As I met the tempest carrying you 
How I attracted you dazzling feelings

And your flared up love

Before I saw you from afar
But now I'm in you
And the pleasure is great
Our world is for us
And the horizon we change
Is the display of our piercing,
Stormy and rainy feelings

Our embraces are eternal 
Our fire is never dying away 
Our hope is great, we're one 
Our war is inside us 
And no one will understand us

For our love is beyond the space
Where our life we create	
Exploding skies our feelings' display 
Our emotions are the hurricane 
When we're gone we will leave rain 
My delight is thunder your pleasure is flash 
Our passion's in everything!
