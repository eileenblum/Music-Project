Thoughts carrying into eternity 
A road leading into the distance 
Space inviting upwards
Anxiety tike on my way
A shadow dismal
Makes me return to the past
From which I'm longing to escape
But there's no sense in escape from myself

Will it last long if I find a new state? 
To return to what I've gone through silly 
To after myself may be

For everyone you're just 
One side of the coin 
But nobody sees the reverse 
And you're left in private with it

In collision with solitude 
Struggle or indifference 
In search of yourself 
Inside your own senses

The target that makes you live 
The meaning &amp; values of your deeds 
Who are you for others, 
Who are you for yourself?

And the wind anew, 
And the road once again 
And the brilliant stars 
On my night-time way 
Wonderful skies in the new space 
And there's sense for a while 
To escape from myself.
