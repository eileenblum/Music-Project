The fire of your feelings 
The light of my desires 
The flash of your hope 
The beam of your love 
So much bright and scorching

Only the angel of my dreams 
Can beam that way 
The angel of suffering, 
Of love and pride

You wait and hope for us to meet 
You are invited by your tender look 
And soft touch of your feelings 
You're afraid of your demon 
But you're attracted by him

He suffers greatly
His heart is broken, his soul is crushed
Like a shroud of dense mist on his way
His blind oblivion kills his flesh
On the bloody feasts and voluptuous pleasures

He escapes from his past 
He destroys his real world 
It's the thirst of irreparable

War with himself
The ray of light is his only salvation 
Your demon is dead without an angel 
The fire of love will warm his heart 
And will return him back to life.
