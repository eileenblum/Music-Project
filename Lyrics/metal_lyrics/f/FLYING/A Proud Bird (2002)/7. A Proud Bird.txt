Space inviting upwards
And feelings born by the will 
In energy have interlaced 
In breathing, even and free!

But the burst won't come, don't wait for 
The body amorphous? And sounds? 
Streams carrying upwards 
Once hands the wings are now.

You were longing for soaring like eternity 
Higher and higher fly for your life 
Scorn all the principles 
Dictated above

But is there an aim you head for?
You wanted it pure, but is it?
Are you certain in it giving all your strench
To the upwards inviting space?

If sure, then fly and break all the bars 
The call of your heart, it won't disappoint 
And the sky will accept a proud bird 
But the main thing for her is not to fall

But the proud bird doesn't hear the words 
That all that invites is not a good sign 
And the main aim for her is to merge 
With the space to which she aspires.
