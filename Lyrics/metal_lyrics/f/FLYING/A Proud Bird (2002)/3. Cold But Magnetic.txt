Moonlight through branches of the trees
Cold but magnetic

Inviting and putting me only guard 
The light of dreary solitude

But hardly everything is so faceless
The look of the moon like your reflection
The thoughts of the lonely heart
The grief and joy of your soul
The suffering of unrequited love

On your face the silent movement 
Of the cold light

Coldness penetrating into flaming heart 
Night embrace carrying you away 
Following the moon so taciturn 
Like you are in your solitude

All day long you have been waiting
For the moonlight approaching
To impart to it your story
To disclose your thoughts to it
To reveal your soul
To chill your heart

You are free in night time only
And concealed from alien sights
Confronting your reflection
Moon is the mirror of your consciousness
Into which you look any time

You want to understand yourself
You're grateful to dusk
You're hardly waiting for the dawn

Moonlight through your glance 
Cold heart inviting 
And putting you on your guard 
The loneliness of faceless night

But hardly...
