I said don't make me vote
I'd better cut my throat
There is no sense to lose my time in vain.
Those TV talking heads
Their speeches made of blades
They are sold out, I don't like second hand
I'd like to live my life
To have my only strife
There is no hell but policy we're in
Neurosis everywhere
But I don't really care
Unjustice rules but who hates it he wins
Invasion in mind
Free-thinking is left behind
Non-conformity
Only keeps us alive.
I broke my TV set
It makes me sociopath
My radio is on the way to hell
My internet is dead
And now I shake my head
Non-conformity only breaks the spell
Invasion in mind
Free-thinking is left behind
Non-conformity
Only keeps us alive.
