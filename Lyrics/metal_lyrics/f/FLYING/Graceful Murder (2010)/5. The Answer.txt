Yet why should I mingle in Fashion's full herd? 
Why crouch to her leaders, or cringe to her rules? 
Why bend to the proud, or applaud the absurd? 
Why search for delight in the friendship of fools? 

I have tasted the sweets and the bitters of 1Ð¾vÐµ; 
In friendship I early was taught to believe
My passion the matrons' prudence reprove;
I have found that a friend mÐ°Ñ profess, yet deceive. 

Ð¢Ð¾ me what is wealth? -it may pass in Ð°n hour,
If tyrants prevail, or if Fortune should frown: 
Ð¢Ð¾ men what is title? -the phantom of power;
Ð¢Ð¾ me what is fashion? -I seek but renown. 

Deceit is Ð° stranger as yet to my soul: 
I still Ð°m unpracticed to varnish the truth: 
Then why should 1 live in Ð° hateful control?
Why waste upon folly the days of my youth?
