Sand coasts. At nighttime sea
Sends ferocious scream into the skies.
It licks the starsland with giant waves,
With anger roars calling to the gods.

Stars look down with indifference
At this ordinary scene.
They just know, whim of Power
Costs nothing for Eternity

But the firmament unruffled stays
No matter has the rage of sea,
The whim of Power is the game
For that, whose name Eternity

Stars look down with indifference
At this ordinary scene.
They just know, whim of Power
Costs nothing for Eternity
