Having sown good generous seeds
Into the warm wet soil
How do you know you'll get the yield
Still not spoiled?
Without tender care and love
Nursing little sprout
Without taking weed away
Nothing came out!

I'll help you through the hurricane
Hush, my little child
Vermin is exterminated
Let the sun shine bright
You will grow up, day by day
Became healthy and strong
So when it's time for me to go away
I'm still reborn...

The first thing is to plant a tree
The second is a house to build
The most important is number three
This is your son you have to bring up

Built of solid stones
My house must be firm
A comfortable home
With happiness living in
My children will take this place
My children's childen too
So when it's time for me to go away
I'm still renew...

The first thing is to plant a tree
The second is a house to build
The most important is number three
This is your son you have to bring up
