In what is our difference?
Diverse variation of  written themes
We see everything differently 
But hÐ¾ÑÐµ to flow in harmony
All feelings til1thÐµ rest
And to unite truth with fiction

Diverse harmonies, polyphony 
Scream, heart-breaking scream!

Eternal theme, desire
Self-searching and the moment of finding
Hardly remain disillusions
Even if save everythingâ¦

âAdd handful of pain and tears of desperation,
A pound of hope, pinch of blind faith and self-immolation,
Some drops of love, some drops of joy, a bit of obsessionâ¦â
Do you feel the moment of creation?

We donât make any confession,
Just believe that we think right 
At the moment of spiritual creation,
Which, may be, remain in memory of years

Diverse harmonies, polyphony 
Scream, heart-breaking scream!

Eternal theme, desire
Self-searching and the moment of finding
Hardly remain disillusions
Even if save everythingâ¦

âAdd handful of pain and tears of desperation,
A pound of hope, pinch of blind faith and self-immolation,
Some drops of love, some drops of joy, a bit of obsessionâ¦â
Do you feel the moment of creation?
