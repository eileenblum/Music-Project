That, which is argued for centuries,
There, where answer is found,
All is the world, where a human doomed to death
Canât find himself
The whole universe being
Is the universe dust kept in centuries.
We donât notice how
We doom everything to ashes.

Foolâs tread has no borders
He erases them
He calls himself falsely
And boasts of the rightless right
What will we leave on the Earth?
- Trace of burning darkness,
Bones, keeping the secret,
Moment, when weâve doomed ourselves

And where no arguing will be
Where no answer will be found
There is a world, we didnât save
The non-existent world.
