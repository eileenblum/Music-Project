Youâre full of life hidden from menâs eyes
Concealing it under the mask of stormy waves
Youâd prefer to be forgotten by all of us
And may be to become in water slave

But you are mighty â out of control
So much determined on the Earth by you
For you to lead your simple ocean life
And even if you can â just wonât let you do

By you theyâre scared, youâre indomitable
You kill so elegant and gracefully
But still adored by many,
Who understand your soul and your essence.

But all friends are at the bottom
With tender silence you protect their sleeps
While alive to you they were devoted
And you just after crushing them could understand it.
