Lifting my hands to the clouds 
I take off the sinful earth and fly 
I'm carried by the wind so soft and clear 
And by the bright blue sky 
My flight is safe and fast, I have no fear 
The sim, it warms and gently blinds 
The touching tune 
Of freedom and of passion 
Is soaring in the space 
It cavers me with warmth 
And draws right to the edge 
The edge engulfing me 
With all its beauty 
But only there I am tranquill - 
And feel my lightness 
My breath is deep 
As if I don't exist 
I'm unified with space 
My bright blue skies, they call me
