I wanted to reach a certain goal 
Expossed many people including you 
And I can't run away from the shadow 
Which chases me 
My sins, my sufferings 
And given in the measure and deserve  
That whisper of the thoughts and desires 
Which carried you to me 
I demed in vain 
I've been captured by the power from without! 
Voluptuousness was all and wanted 
To get inside, to enjoy the thing 
The most wonderful for me 
Was something that my soul could not forget 
The passion and uncovered 
And the fire inflamed in you 
Leaned to me and burned 
But more important was for me 
The lovefire smitten 
I wanted to reach a certain goal 
Exposed many people including myself 
I ran away from the shadow 
Which still chases me
