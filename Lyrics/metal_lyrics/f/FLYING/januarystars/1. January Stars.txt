The masters of my faith 
I trust my thoughts 
Into your fargone light 
I am alone, for you are plenty 
I am alone in facing you 
You and your power 

My heart, it sinks and aches 
The given pain, it cuts 
It kills hypocrisy and lies 

The masters of my faith 
Open me your cards 
Show me the righteous way 
The way without vanity and hatred 
Light me the road 
And break the dankened veil of my thoughts 

Break the circle of me sufferings 
And of those who loves me 
Define my choice 
The masters of my faith
