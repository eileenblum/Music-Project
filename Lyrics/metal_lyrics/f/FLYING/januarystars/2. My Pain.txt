You need my pain 
And sight of suffering 
You want to get this feeling 
And you'll have what you are asking you 
I'll give it all to you like in a play 
And you will never understand the composition 

On the surface, there always were 
The tender feelings, those 
Which anyone could see 
But inside there stayed the thing 
Which you will here now 
'tis niether hatred, not blind fury 
Out the mean of what I feel 
With my since heart 

It seemed I could be used 
You thought that I could like 
Being suboned by you 
The worse of it is it you believe 
That I'm just angry like a snake 
'tis  not nevenge, like you could do 
It's my entine self 
And it's the shape which my soul takes 
When I just think of you 

I did not betray or wanted to destroy you 
I just want to bring a motto to your consciousness 
I am the master and the rulen of the play, 
And I want take this general defeat, like you could do 
I live, I suffer and I ache 
This pain is mine, the one you'll never get
