The chaos came: desires and passions 
Destroy my mind 
The strikes of heart and thoughts 
Can not get normal 
The innertion takes me 
To the lost points far away 
Once the feelings being so comfortable calm 
Become unruled and wild and pulsing 
The usual state of things 
Ceased to exist 
There stayed my pain 
The feeling of delight jealousy and passion 
I remain the same 
I do not change 
I play, manipulate and let the others 
Do with me the same, and then enoure 
I change surrounding and then 
Come back again. I find and lose 
The relaxation is found only 
In the unbridled passion 
In desire to dissolue or disappear 
But all in all the feeling now is  nealized 
The one I cannot understand 
It tries to conguen me and get me back 
And to restore all what was lost 
And that was just the decay of my soul 
The memories which are passionate and sweet 
Are mixed with everyday occurance 
Will I ever feel the other way? 
Please, present me with a gift 
Of the other state
