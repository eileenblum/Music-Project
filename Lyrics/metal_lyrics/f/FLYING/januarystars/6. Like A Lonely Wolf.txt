I rambled alone 
Just like a lonely wolf, 
The wood ahead of me 
And the mighty wind behind. 
The road I saw, 
It was so clear and real. 
I didn't want to lose it. 

And the thoughts 
Which didn't let me sleep or rest 
Flew faster than 
My real time itself 
And faster than the wind. 
They chose the space, the skies 
As their goal, 
And took all of my passions with them. 
They wished me to uncover a new way 
Which could have brought me happiness, 
And I could be conquered by no one. 
I could be free 
As if I ramble like a lonely wolf.
