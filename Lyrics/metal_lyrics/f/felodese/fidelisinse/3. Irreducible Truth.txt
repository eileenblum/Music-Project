Since the birth of humanity 
Man was always wondering 
About the purpose of life 
Giving credits of existence 
To the gods and their idols 
Faith is an easy way out 

Thoughts are spiraling 
Through the endless mind 
Irreducible truth 
Is shining in the dark 

Since the dawn of time 
Weâve been chasing the response 
To Man's design 
Infinite thirst of knowledge 
Is running in our veins 
A glow has been lighted in our hearts 

Thoughts are spiraling 
Through the endless mind Irreducible truth 
Is shining in the dark 

Lost in the fog of ignorance 
Asking why we exist 
Interrogating the stars 
There's so much we don't know 
Walking under a pale red sky 
Like we are wandering in the dark 

Thoughts are spiraling 
Through the endless mind 
Irreducible truth 
Is shining in the dark 

Thoughts are spiraling 
Through the endless mind 
Irreducible truth 
Is rising in our hearts
