You can see him at dawn 
Marching through the misty woods 
An ageless man with glacial breath 
Is here to take us all 
On a journey across the stars 
To behold the whole creation 
Giving us the chance 
To pursue the cycle of life 

Out from the dark 
The old man awaits us 
His eyes are cold as ice 
As he stares at us all 
From the million lives 
He has lived 
He's implacable 
His name is Death 

This life has come to an end 
Coming at the gates of another world 
Following the wanderer 
Doubt has no more reason to be 
As we are finding the final purpose 
We'll live on as stars 
To witness aeons of life 
And see the worlds collide 

Out from the dark 
The old man awaits us 
His eyes are cold as ice 
As he stares at us all 
From the million lives 
He has lived 
He's implacable 
His name is Death
