In The Dark Of The Night 
Follow my light 
See The Curtain Rise 
On The Cosmic Theater 

Let Me Guide You 
In the void of the stars 
Let Me Hear You 
From The Top Of The World 
In The Night 
I Rule The Sky 

In the Graveyard of stars 
I've witnessed the birth of man 
Master of constellations 
The Dark star rising 

Let Me Guide You 
In the void of the stars 
Let Me Hear You 
From The Top Of The World 
In The Night 
I Rule The Sky 

Let Me Guide You 
In the void of the stars 
Let Me Hear You 
From The Top Of The World 
I'm The One 
Who Fades At Dawn
