Rejected by the sun 
You fell into darkness 
Away from the light 
The sun burnt your eyes 

The Fall of man (shines like a comet) 
The Solar Fire (erupts in circles) 
Your fall ignites the sky, the pyres light up the night 
Sky-shattering fire devours the world 

The universe will never be enough 

Rejected by the sun 
You fell into darkness 
Away from the light 
The sun burnt your eyes 

The Fall of man (shines like a comet) 
The Solar Fire (erupts in circles) 
The human race stuck in ignorance 
is trying to approach the sun 

The knowledge of the sun-god will stay forbidden to mankind 

Rejected by the sun 
You fell into darkness 
Away from the light 
The sun burnt your eyes
