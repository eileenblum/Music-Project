Igneous stones of transmutation
Birth of the Kailash Mountain,
Crystal meditation, place of transformation

Where world's desire disappear

Thou hast a wish,
Supreme devotion
Born as a promise
The worship's sacrifice, sacrifice!

Self-immolation through tongues of fire
As response of humiliation and ire
The funeral pyre purifies thou dignity
Widow's ritual.
Cosmic cycles of creation and destruction

Trigger the Tandava's dance
Despite his violent cadence and seduction

Matter is demolished by His trident's lance
Thou hast just a wish,
Supreme devotion

Born as a promise
The worship's sacrifice

Self-immolation through tongues of fire
As response of humiliation and ire.
Thou hast just a wish,
Supreme devotion.
Self-immolation through tongues of fire
As response of humiliation.
