Tool or oblation
Incinerate and dominate
Devotion, knowledge and glory
A taste of power to unleash the fury
The scepter to subjugate
Or the royal mace to cultivate
The art of divine libation
Ignition of human ineptness
The egoâs death into the pyre
Denuded immaculate mind
Inherited candescence
Hidden and revealed existence

Settled in all mortal beings
Endorse wisdom and evolution
Agniâs dynasty
Settled in all mortal beings.
Agniâs dynasty.
The scepter to subjugate
Or the royal mace to cultivate
The art of divine libation
Perpetual ignition of human ineptness
A taste of power to unleash the fury.
