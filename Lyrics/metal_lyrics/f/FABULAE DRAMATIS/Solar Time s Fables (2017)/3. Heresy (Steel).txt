Dried-out field civilization money flow,
Lives not all matter,
Stagnation,
Cowards march.

Modern heresy, toothless
Schizophasic desire,
On the surface, around the corner,
War with the world with no chance of advance.

Petitions of modern courtesy rituals,

Information flood holds the ship of fools, Adrift,
Narcosis of local superiority,

Artificial circles,
Watchers refuse to take part

In the dance of the dead, they aren't mad.

Modern heresy, toothless
Schizophasic desire,
On the surface, around the corner,
War with the world with no chance of advance.

Conspiring fear, traumatized ignorance
Numbing desire to limit the world to the peasant's eyesight,

Tending the crops on his own,
Never raising the head, expect to protect
The shallow field,
Of vision.

Modern heresy, toothless
Schizophasic desire,
On the surface, around the corner,
War with the world with no chance of advance.
