Enter the tundra

The flood has come
To deluge mankind's throne

Spirits from the storm
Will destroy every stone

Praise the haze
To maintain peace
Avoid daze

Water, ah! Water ah!

Nail that grabs the trunk

Doesn't grow
Tobacco
To smoke the clouds (it)

Drops the water

Rainfall on the plateau (it)

Drops the water
To smoke the clouds

Tobacco
Doesn't grow
Nail that grabs the trunk

To smoke the clouds.

Exit the tundra

Every teardrop, every fountain

All beasts (on earth)
Emerge from rain

Praise the haze

To maintain peace

Avoid daze

The flood has come
To deluge mankind's throne

Spirits from the storm
Will destroy every stone
Of mankind's throne.

Water, ah! Water ah!

Praise the haze
Avoid daze
The flood has come
Spirits from the storm
Praise the haze
Avoid daze

Water, ah! Water ah!

The flood has come

Spirits from the storm
(it) Will destroy every stone

The flood has come
To deluge mankind's throne

Spirits from the storm
(it) Will destroy every stone.
