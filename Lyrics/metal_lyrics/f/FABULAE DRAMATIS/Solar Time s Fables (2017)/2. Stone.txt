Who conquers all its virtues
And has a hard skin surface
And lives in stagnationâ¦
Yet born from mineral
Conversion, transition

â¦Inspires alchemy
And forms the base of legends
The heart of the temple

(it) Lies down
In forests
(the) Sculptor's raw material
War's weapon artillery
Temple or prison
Idols and gods
Yet born from mineral
Conversion, transition
From raw stone to talisman
Gem to icon
To satisfy worship's faith
(it) Lies down
In forests
(the) Sculptor's raw material
Yet born from mineral
Conversion, transition
War's weapon artillery
Temple or prison
Idols, gods and enemies
Sculptor's material idols and gods.
