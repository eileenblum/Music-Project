Morning light,
Stuck in the fight
Attempting to handle the heavy eyelids,

That dream, left the hollow
Remained like a bullet.

Don't you remember when
You were a child of the rain,
Dancing in place
Where this city's grown,
So many threads
Led here, entangled
Into the barren.

Wake up once again,
From one dream to another,
A nightmare remorse within myself

A nightmare desert within yourself.

But you are still there,
On the edge, borderline,
Fuzzy notes blur out the remains

Of meaningful words,
Shallow harmonies
Martyr's soul

Relentless attempts to get away,
Embracing another love,

Begging for help,
Finding oneself in an empty bed

One hour before the end.

Wake up once again,
From one dream to another,
A nightmare remorse within myself
