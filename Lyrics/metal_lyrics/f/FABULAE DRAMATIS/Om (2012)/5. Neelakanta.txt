Hear the ancient battle!
a churned oceanâs invasion

a poisoned elixirâs egression

Lord of destruction
immersed in placid opium
dance to the rhythm of drums
oblivious of the world
Om Namah Shivaya

A poisoned elixir
overflows my throat
a destructive nectar
of deepest darkest notes

Dissolve to create!
death is a fact of birth
the Samsara turns
through consciousness

The intent of immortality
of devas and asuras
unveil the misery

Lord of destruction
immersed in placid opium
dance to the rhythm of drums.
