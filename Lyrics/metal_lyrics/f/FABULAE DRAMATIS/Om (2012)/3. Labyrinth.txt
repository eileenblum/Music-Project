Two hundred years, roaming the world
forgetting the way they told me
all the fairy tales are lies
still reaching for something
that never was mine

In a silent dream, I saw the world
it burned, I never thought we were so lost
Itâs a labyrinth

Why are you so cruel?
donât you see the transparency of these walls
it is a smile, a touch
throughout time, I wander
just as you do
and I watch you

Weâre living a lie!

Now,
no escape, and no way out

If you stride along these glassy walls
we belong here, no tide to turn

Unfold our wings, stride, walk
beneath the mirror walls
our hearts beat

And just like us, theyâll never find
the way to solve the labyrinth.
