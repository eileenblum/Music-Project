[Hun-HunahpÃº:]
Dost thou desire my ancient flesh
tasteless flavour of emptinessI saw the montainâs arise
and grew up nodes into life

[Ixquic:]
Kejeâ kâut xa u kâ ajol,
Kejeâ ri u chubâ
U kâaxaj
U kâ ojeâ ik
Kanurayij
We u kâajol ajaw,
we puch u kâajol naâol,
Aj uchaân
Kanurayij

[English translation:]

Thus merely his son,
like his saliva
His spittle
His essence
I do desire it
If his son lord,
If also his son sage,
Master of speech
I do desire it

[Narrator:]
In pernicious fury burns her fatherâs pride
death is the price of dishonour

[Hun-HunahpÃº:]
Lascivious fluid drop on thine hand
distilled substance of immaculate kind
Narrator sacred oils of hidden virtue
overwhelm thine chaste womb
a fallacious fruit as hart
shalt thou give as sacrifice!

[Hun-HunahpÃº:]
Lascivious fluid drop on thine hand
distilled substance of immaculate kind

[Narrator:]
Falaz efigie, fruto de grana
arde flamÃ­gero, inefable
corazÃ³n sangrante
brotando en savia invulnerable.

[English translation:]

Fallacious effigy, scarlet fruit
burns flaming, ineffable
bleeding heart
sprouting in invulnerable sap.
