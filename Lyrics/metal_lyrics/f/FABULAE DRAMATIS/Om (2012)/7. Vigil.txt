The haze of night
far moon rose
above the trees
no sleep for us
we need to rest
we need to find
the way to reach the clearing

I can not breathe
until this stops
within myself
Iâm fighting
to believe

This is not over
youÂ´re walking this fuzzy line
this is your vigil
hold on, âtill itâs time

- Are we lost
- in this fight?
- will we find the day?
- Thereâs no other way.
- Deception!
- Listen to me!

This is not over
youâre locked in uncertain line
this is your vigil
hold on, âtill itâs time.
