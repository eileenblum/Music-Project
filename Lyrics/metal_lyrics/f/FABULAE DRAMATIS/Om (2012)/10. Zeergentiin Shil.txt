[English translation:]
In the pasture of savage deer of downhill of âZeergentâ,
my big and small horses are bred together.
Please wait, my big horse, are you in a hurry to see your mate?
Please wait, my small horse, why are you in such a hurry?
Let me wait untill the snow melts and the deer of Taiga bells.
Let me wait untill the cuckoo and birds sing and the blue fog diminishes.
