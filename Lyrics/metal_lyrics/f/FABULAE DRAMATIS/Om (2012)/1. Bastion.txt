Fortress built with impetuousness
sepia walls against human dread
a place to protect the empire
the prison, the artifice of our battles

enormous fear sculptured
by the menâs insolence
supported by gods and time
Cronosâ eroded hand

an imposing dead creation
of unbreakable face shield
a petrified mantle made to
the measure of our weakness

drown in its perished density
preserving sublime stone

materialised arrogance
to move apart humankind
specified by colour and price
every culture loses its temperance

anthropocentric fablesâ¦

NoyÃ©e dans sa densitÃ© pÃ©rissante
prÃ©servant la pierre sublime
dans lâacte de sa terreur
elle prÃ©tend Ã¡ sâeffondrer

in the act of its terror
claims to collapse

â¦to rape innocent minds
a lullaby to soothe your pride
the sun turns around us
until the opposite is verified!
