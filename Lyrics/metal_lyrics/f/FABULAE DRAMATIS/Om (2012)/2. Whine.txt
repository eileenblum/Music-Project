Alack! Oh beautiful auld lang syne!
Ãsthete knight
Knight from the bosk
Where I bemuse to the trees
With my bemoaning.
I bethink the sounds of the swords
I could not save his life
Woe is me!

The waylayer fathomed his bosom
Perfidious man heâs in war.
He left to the inferno
My brave warlikeâ¦

âThe obscure of evil coverth my sword,
The enemy defeath me,
Oh! Walkirya come to meâ¦
Only in Walhalla will I rest in peaceâ.

He left.
