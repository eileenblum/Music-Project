Oh, mighty Lucifer
I breathe of thou breath
I am bound for all eternity
With my alliance to thee

My feelings become ecstatic
With the thought of rebirth
My destiny leads forth
Within the black flame of Satan

I face the altar of flesh
And present the sign of the horns

Oh, mighty Lucifer
I who art from thou seed
Breathing thou breath
Serving the darkness with might

Facing the altar of flesh
Ritual act of conveyance

Feelings of transformation
Enter into the realm of the dark
The chosen path
Is within the black flame of Satan
