As I leave my human shape and enter the zone of twilight
My body is dead but my soul will dwell

On my journey through the abyss I found seduction
Sathanas lord of hell became my goal of afterlife

My hearings of the unhearable
My knowledge of the unknowing
My feelings of the unfeelable

My views of the unseen gave me sight beyond sight
In my search of an eternal life and everlasting knowledge

On my quest for knowledge I found my destiny
A life in flames my soul will be

My hearings of the unhearable
My knowledge of the unknowing
My feelings of the unfeelable
