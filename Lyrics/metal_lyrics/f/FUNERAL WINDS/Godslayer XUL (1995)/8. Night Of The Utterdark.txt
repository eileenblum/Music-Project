On this night of utterdark
Jehova's choirs raise their hands an sing for me
They can't hurt me
Nor my total dedication to the utterdark

On this night of utterdark
Jehova's choirs raise their hands
And cry to their god
He can't hurt me
Nor my total dedication to the utterdark

As they sing their songs of praise
The fire of the burning pits shines in my eyes
As they sing their songs of lies
I feel the diabolic unity
The unity I have searched for so long
Dark brothers at last together

I feel the presence of my brothers
From times long past
Unity of wisdom, power and might
Give me visions from the shadowed realm
Give me the strength to see through the lies

"Oh, my dark brothers, at last we are together
Let us never forget our mission
To serve the utterdark!"
