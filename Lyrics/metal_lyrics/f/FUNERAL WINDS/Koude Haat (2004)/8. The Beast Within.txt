Burning desire awakens the beast within
Feel the diabolical blood raging through my veins

Cold sharpened blade cuts my skin
Pure blood flows under the full moon light

My last sacrifice on earth...

Carried by the winds of funeral
The ravens call my name
Eyes turn black as night
As the soul enters the world below

The void opens before me
I enter the land of sin
Reborn in full glory
Blessed with the powers from below
The beast within unleashed...

The beast within
