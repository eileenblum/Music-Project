I see black clouds devour the sun
No place for the light
In this powerful realm to come
This dawn will once more show our might

All our hearts are filled with Satanic pride
As we slay the enemy
Ancient forces again return
But this time eternal

For this is the dawn of the bestial bloodshed

Streams of blood, infernal massacre
The enemy defeated
Wastelands of crushed human bones
Our empire will last

(Our empire will last)

The heavenly powers have faded,
A world in darkness
It's us to whom the throne belongs
Eternal praise and victory
To the satanic elite

For this is the dawn of the bestial bloodshed
