From the depth of the earth
A dark shadow rose
Darkening day into night
Out of the abyss he rose
Behold the dark majesty
The mighty emperor
Of the Kingdom Dolorous

Underneath the grim face
Of the shadow lord
Came forth two mighty wings
Fashioned like a bat's,
Agitating them...
A majestic wind
Made its way out from him

All froze before those winds

Out of the frozen landscapes
The dark majesty
Towered from the ice,
Breathing a heavy fog

Embracing his earthly legions

All kneel down
For the lord of lords
Warriors of the fallen one,
Knights of the Morningstar
"Go with the fiery winds of death...

Take back what is mine
And therefore yours"
