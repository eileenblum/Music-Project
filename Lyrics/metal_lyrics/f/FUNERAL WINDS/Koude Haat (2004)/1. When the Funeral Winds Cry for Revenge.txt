Black clouds suffocate the dying sun
Darkness shall reign until the end of times
Chaos and warfare dominate the earth
When the funeral winds cry for revenge
Revenge...

Within the winds you can hear the warlords shriek
Screaming for revenge
Bringing death and terror over the mortals

Winds of fury, winds of old
Raging terror lies within
Winds of truth, winds of death
Mankind's destiny unfolds

In the dark clouds that make the light disappear
The shadows of the warlords can be seen
Announcing the end of human existence

When the funeral winds cry for revenge
The ancient ones scourge the earth
The end of all life

Winds of fury, winds of old
Raging terror lies within
Winds of truth, winds of death
Mankind's destiny unfolds
