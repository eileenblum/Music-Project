It lay hidden for ages
Covered with dust of old
The veil is taken away
And it can clearly be seen

Revelation...

The spirit of god is dead!

Seven churches
Burned to the ground

Mysteries of the kingdom of god
Unveiled...

We are the wicked
And we do understand
We are the wise ones
And denounce the dead spirit
With the wisdom of our master
We crush the Holy Ghost

The lake of fire
Will swallow the holy land
Heaven and earth
Pass away

Resurrection of the wicked
We shall rule again!
The wicked are the wise
Raised by the true father of men
