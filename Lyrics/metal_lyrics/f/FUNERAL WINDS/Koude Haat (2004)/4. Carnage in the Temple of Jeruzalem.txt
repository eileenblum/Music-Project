Desecration of the temple of Jerusalem
When our master moves in
The image of the beast is placed
Abomination of desolation...

"And for the overspreading of abominations
He shall make the temples desolate..."

When the Antichrist returns to life
Blood will flow from the temple steps
Painting the holy land red
Carnage in the temple of Jerusalem

Worship the abomination
Kneel for the image of the beast
Or your innards will decorate the temple floor

Carnage in the name of our master
Jerusalem will drown in holy blood
