No more pain, no more suffering, you only have to die.
No more fear, no more screams, just give me, just give me your life.

Nightmare! This is the life that you live for, you hear screams everywhere you go,
You have to suffer and you gotta know that this is the end.

Your skin is cold and white, but there's not weakness in your mind.
Reflections of insanity you'll only see in their dead eyes.

Gradually you'll fear how your breath leaves, and comes to me

Victims!! Crying!! That's your work man! Disease! Plagues!!
Do you know that you're death??

My life's your death, my life's your breath.
My life's your death, my life's your fucking breath.

No more pain, no more suffering, you only have to die
No more fear, no more screams, just give me your life.
No more pain, no more suffering, you only have to die
No more fear, no more screams

Your heart-beats feed my engine, a mechanism which cause shivers down your spine.

Now we are face to face, this is the end.
Now we are the same, this is the end

'Cause we are death!

I am the cancer, Iâm the disease, Iâm that bitch that never lets you scream.

All you know is my fucking name.
