I open the door to my final judgement they say what they say they say that is not fear
This is my last chance to survive this is my final judgement
This is the last fucking day vengeance is the only door

Take all the sentiments of a cold blooded cynic they say what they say they say that is not fear
This is my last chance to survive this is my final judgement this is the last fucking day
And now I can believe the situation in me and now I am bleeding from my fucking side
And now I strike you here I want to find you here I want to see you crying bitch
