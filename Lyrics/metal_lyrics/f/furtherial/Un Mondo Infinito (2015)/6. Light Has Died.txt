Disciples of a new cruel god
Blunted by the lust for blood
Ignoramus is led by a serpent
Insidious defiled the sun

She was the one who were sowing all the
Seeds of growing brighter minds
Has taken by the atrocious and blind
For raving hunger of the greed
Then the light has diedâ¦

Enlightened beauty with the lucid wisdom
Endless devotion to the sky and seas of lore

She was the one who were sowing all the
Seeds of growing brighter minds
Has taken by the atrocious and blind
For raving hunger of the greed

Then the light has died and withdrawn to the skiesâ¦

With the lust of power, the serpent daubed the source of light
With the lust for blood, disciples tortured and killed
In the name of god
The evil became Saintâ¦
The beauty is shatteredâ¦
She was the martyr and the one
To be rememebered

Being fallen apart
Was never an oblivion
Time wiped out the dust of vile
And greaten the memory of the pure
Curse you all who pretending as god
Curse you all! The following blind!

"The vile Galilean struck you and cursed you;
But in falling, you became even greater! And now, alas!
The spirit of Plato and the body of Aphrodite
Have withdrawn forever to the fair skies of Hellas"

[from the poem "Hypatie" by Leconte de Lisle]
