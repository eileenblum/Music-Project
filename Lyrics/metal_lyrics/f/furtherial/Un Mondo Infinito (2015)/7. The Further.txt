Waken in the arms of an angel, relieving the pain
That brought to us by vexing roads of fate
Struggled all through the life
Departed in anguish
Now, shining in the dark

Behold! The martyrs come
Glorious souls of an inglorious world
Behold! Their march has begun
Descanting in joy, their songâs unfurled

Embracing the final relief

Forced to leave, were tried to be erased
The ashes scattered by the wind
Unbreakable, indelible traces
The history they left behind

Behold! The wings have come by
Telling a tale to the fading lights
Behold as the wind is singing its lullaby
And taking away their spirits to the high

Welcoming bitter demise

Forced to leave, were tried to be erased
The ashes scattered by the wind
Unbreakable, indelible traces
The history they left behind

Weâre sailing our ships to further
To regain our lives in further

Welcoming bitter demise
Minds of future, the real afterlife.
Your undying soul, the trace you leave behind.
The ignorant, the fearful, in oblivion they'll rot.
The tide will wash the tyrant, the flow will prove you right

"History is full of people who out of fear, ignorance or lust for power; have destroyed treasures of immeasurable value which truly belong to all of us. We must not let it happen again."
[Carl Sagan]
