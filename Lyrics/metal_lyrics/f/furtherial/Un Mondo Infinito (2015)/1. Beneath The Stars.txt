Sight is not always related with seeing
Through the eyes of man
In time the soul wonders and searches the source
Beyond its shell
Like I searched mineâ¦
The earth I sheltered
Was not the only place in the universe
Soon I realized
And found the answer in my core
Infinity!

Your god is not the same as mine!

Sight is not always related with seeing
Through the eyes of man
My eyes saw the future, my soulâs flown
Beneath the stars
I found my path.

The truth is revealed, but corrupt has denied.

With insolence, impertinence..
Imprisoned me to repent.
Said my words without fear
Regardless, I stand tall

You fear me moreâ¦
When you charged me to my infernal demise

Beneath the stars, the heretic burns
Beneath the stars , he turns to ashes
Beneath the stars, a heretic borns
My heart holds no regret to my end

They feared me moreâ¦ When I took my first step to further...

âMaiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego accipiamâ
(Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than I receive it)
[Giordano Bruno]
