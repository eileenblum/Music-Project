Is it feasable for humankind to fly
Wondered and searched for all my finite life
As the volent creatures I desire
From the vault of heaven Iâll salute the sky
Fly high to the endless sky with your heart
Fly, all your wishes come to life and
Fly, when youâre ready to pay your price
As the wind sweeps your wings
The endeavor of mine was seen from the high
The souvereign and the other authorized
Threatened first, but then I was stood by
Persisted to make real this journey of mine
Fly high to the endless sky with your heart
Fly, all your wishes come to life and
Fly, when youâre ready to pay your price
As the wind sweeps your wings
As my feet touched the ground,
Iâm awakened from my most beautiful dream
Staring by a thousand malicous eyes
That thinking that I was a dangerous being
Torn apart from my beloved ones, my lands
Where my wishes were burgeoned
Exiledâ¦ Waited for my finite life to come to an endâ¦

âThat man is a man to be feared of; whatever he wishes for, would come true. That kind of men shouldnât be allowed to surviveâ
[Souvereign IV. Murad]
