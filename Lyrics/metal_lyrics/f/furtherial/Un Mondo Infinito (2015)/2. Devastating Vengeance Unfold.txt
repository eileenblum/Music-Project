Traitors and rapists, defilers of maids
Betrayed to the dead manâs will
Desacreted our homeland with scorn
Once where we lived in peace
Ä°nferiority, disguised in supremacy
Humiliated will, descend upon you!
My tears became flames, heart burnt to ashes
Loss of the beloved and treachery
I took my oath of retaliation
Once Iâm prepared, Iâll incinerate
Ä°nferiority, disguised in supremacy
Humiliated will, descend upon you!
Devastating vengeance unfold,
One day our legend will be told
Ä°nferiority, disguised in supremacy
Traitors and renegades will quake with fear
Devastating venfeance unfold
One day our legend will be told
When hundered and thousand walk to your land
Shaking to the ground with rage
Weâll show you the real hate
And prove that the less can destroy the great
Wings have come by, telling a tale
And told me that they will pay
But I must pay my price
When the time will come to an end
For me I will make myself rest
In the bleak arms of death
Swords have torn, the blaze ignited the core
At the end of my vow,
I cried out loud once more
Vengeance!

"To all warriors whom have the soul of Boadicea inside"
