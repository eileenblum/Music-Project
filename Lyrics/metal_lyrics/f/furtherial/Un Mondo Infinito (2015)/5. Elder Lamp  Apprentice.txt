Farewell to you, the master of wisdomâ¦
The wisest man Iâve ever known
Was an honor to be learning from you
The strongest teacher of virtue
Farewell to you the elder, the decent
Death was your only choice
You did make your stand, refused to repent
And took your own life with your own hand
âAll I know is that I know nothingâ
I'm the apprentice
Clanging words in callow minds
Sprouted seeds of morality
Taught and counselled the young to be wise
The reason why he was to blame
âAll I know is that I know nothingâ
I'm the apprentice
Hemlock in the bowl,
The elder to swallow
Hemlock in this bowl
Pledging our health, we follow

âAn unexamined life is not worth livingâ
[Socrates]
