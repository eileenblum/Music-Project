Flogged and beaten body in blood to intimidate
In display, a man who thought he was god
Crucified blasphemy excoriated, mutilated
Alive but the pain he felt none but in his heart
That heathen man, he was a light that wanted to shine on
Apprising people to their god indeed was closer
That heathen man, he was a light that wanted to brighten
Ä°gnorant hearts and clouded minds of devilish pride
Iâm the truth and the truthâs what Iâve seen inside
Reflection of the omnipresent
Iâm within God and the God's within me inside
And heâs the only omnipotent
Existence
Blasphemous, sacrilegous, profane, evil minded
What they called him, benighted ones and the cruel one
Enlightened santon he was and competent one
Words distorted on purpose by some authority
That heathen man, he was a light that wanted to shine on
Apprising people to their god indeed was closer
That heathen man, he was a light that wanted to brighten
Ä°gnorant hearts and clouded minds of devilish pride
Iâm the truth and the truthâs what Iâve seen inside
Reflection of the omnipresent
Iâm within God and the God's within me inside
And heâs the only omnipotent
Existence
Now his soulâs in peace in the end

âHell is not where we suffer, is where no one can hear us sufferâ
