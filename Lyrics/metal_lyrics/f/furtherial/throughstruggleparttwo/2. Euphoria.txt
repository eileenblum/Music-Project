Hope is the new torment of clouded minds
Mirages stray and blind your sight
Deluded thoughts of yours depending on
Surrounding euphoria

The more you run
The more you sink into the nothingness
Is it fair to live a lie
Within surrounding euphoria?

The more you run
The more you sink into the nothingness
The more you hide
The more you atone in the end

The more you run
The more you sink into the nothingness
The more you hide
The more you atone in the end

Try to retrieve your being
No more pretending
