Inhale the absence of light
Lungs are out of respiration
Complete lost of vision
And slowly fading in gloom
How can it be managed to break out
From the malice unbeknown?
Your endeavour is pointless
Swallowed by darkness at last
Inhale the absence of light
Be exposed to the consuming pestilence
Since I am yours and you're mine
We will feast upon your flesh
How can it be managed to break out
From the malice unbeknown?
I am your nemesis
I am your doom
The fall... You are blighted to the core,
Stepped inside of the obscure
You're the digger of your own grave
"Since I am yours... And you are mine..."
The fall... You are blighted to the core
Stepped inside of the obscure
You're the digger of your own grave
