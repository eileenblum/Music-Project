When the pain is accepted, it hurts no longer
As the struggles have drained your power
Will you keep your stand high?
The acceptance not always means that you gave up
Look straight in the eyes of anguish
Initiate your withstand
Refusing the failure, is not the state of denial
Recover, take over, expose inner mind
Ignite a decision, take a step out of dark
And gather, all power
The incursion begins
"No man can stand against me,
I'm the bringer of grief
The son of perdition I am,
I will make you dry-bleed!"
Take a hold of your life, stop living a lie
The wings of The One will embrace you
Take a hold of your life, stop living a lie
The stories I've told will heal you
So began the incursion...
Which one will prevail?
Will it be the stories
Or the destruction?
Take a hold of your life, stop living a lie
The wings of The One will embrace you
Take a hold your life, stop living a lie
The stories I've told will heal you
"The stories I've told will heal..."
