Darkened...
Burnt everywhere destroyed
My life has ruined
Everything lost
And I feel exhausted
Reflections...
Made me smile no more
I had no dreams
That made me feel better
Desperation...
Ruled and drained me away
I had one thing
I could do
I must born again
Lost in my sanity now I am too tired
Don't want to challenge, I can only vanish
Without a trace I'll escape from my grave
To live a new life with my newborn sunlight
Now come to me
Death's cold embrace give me warm hopes again
Break all my chains
Set me free, give me the strength
Erase old memories eternally
For them not to stand on my way
Open the locked doors wide
For me to pass by and find my way
With my newborn soul
Make me fucking born again!
