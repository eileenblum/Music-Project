Into the riot!
It was me, trapped in my underground world.
It was my men, attacking me with enormity and dirt.
Into the corridors I followâ¦
In the pathways Iâm killing everything in my way.
There were another fray in the corridor âKâ
My wife Syphry was dealing âThe Betray.â
Shadowâs Riot has begun with severity
The revolt was going on with obscurity
My world is collapsing and my kingdom falls
I am not giving in, rather getting intoâ¦
Into the riot!
Into the corridors I followâ¦
And feeling the hand of an angel lightens my way
When I reached onto the fray in the corridor âKâ
I have seen the faces of darkness in betray

My Riot has begun with severity
The revolt was going on with obscurity
My world is collapsing and my kingdom falls
I am not giving in, rather getting intoâ¦
I felt that she was killed
So I let you killing me so that I could see her againâ¦
