Now I have one thing to fulfill, too much to kill
Now a living monster I am
Price paid abomination
My demand's been done, and I have resurrected
I'm coming for your lives you betrayers
And I have more things to take
One by one I'll take you down and
More blood will flow
Terror has begun
I sworn for
Sworn for revenge
Back from the dead I've risen for my second chance to live
Living dead in an endless pain is ending with a gift
Walls are down beneath the earth, my soul's risen up
Will to live, live for blood
All I have wanted from god
One by..
Judge me, bring me back what has been taken from me
Forgive me, help me, give me chance to feed my hate
With taking back my life, I will take too much soul
And even if god wouldn't give I'll take my revenge
