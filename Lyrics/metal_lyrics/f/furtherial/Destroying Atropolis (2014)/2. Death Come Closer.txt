Enraged... Without having a strength
Deranged with fury, my eyes are burning flames
Became more brave, I'll rip the heart of the enemy
Hate in my veins, I won't be your loner slave
I defy you
Now I shout louder
No more fear of you
Death come closer
This is a war.
Death come closer
It's not myself that you can dominate
And if you can, my shape you terminate
Every single breath fills me with power and hate
I'm waiting to strike,
I'm ready, show me all your might
I defy you...
Down, I'm fallen, smashed to the ground
Down, it's over, all has ended, I'm down
