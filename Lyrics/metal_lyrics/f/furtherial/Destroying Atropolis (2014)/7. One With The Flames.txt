Grief hurt my soul
As it hurt my flesh, even more
Molded my abstracted pain
And turn me to a vengeance aliveâ¦
Now waitâ¦ And seeâ¦
Bring forth of my form of destruction
And spread all of my fire infernal
Fervent rage Iâm a form of creation
And breathe all of your torment eternal
Disaster unleashedâ¦
To the surface beneath
I am the one with the flames of hell
I am here to burn
I am the one with the flames of extinction
I come forward to ruin your world.
Facing all with the flames that surround me
Respiring dismay of igniting fear you see
Yet you obtain the pounding loathe inside
All life drains and deplete
Disaster unleashedâ¦
To the surface beneath
I am the one with the flames of hell
I am here to burn
I am the one with the flames of extinction
I come forward to ruin your world.
I burn and break but no relief I would find
Till I embrace my missing half again with love.
