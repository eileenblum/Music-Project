This embracing demise
Unglorious surrender of mine
With my fury inside I was lost but found by the Great Taler
My disgrace turned into fire with his hand
And the eyes of the dark has been gone
In vanity
A hope
Enlightened and brightened my sight
Defying hell again with the vengeance and loss
All the pain I bore
That burns inside my chest soon will be ended
Iâll crush my chains now
My fate reversed and
The beginning of the end begins
I faced the angel of death
I faced my hell
Dismissed my misery
Sneering âDeathâ awaiting
Teasing my shackles that unbroke
Pledged my soul once
Then clouded my sanity
Awakened by
The Taler who brought me my dreams
I asked nothing
But fulfill all the task of my grudge
Defying hell again with the vengeance and loss
All the pain I bore
That burns inside my chest soon will be ended
Iâll crush my chains now
My fate reversed and
The beginning of the end begins
I faced the angel of death
I faced my hell
Dismissed my misery
âLet me be the death itself youâll see,
The angel/ that kills/the creature, let me be!â
When angels kill, oblivious hands of God all you would see
When angels kill, dying is a gift that youâll be taken from me!
