I will free myself out, from this barren ground
And I will set forth to my journey now,
This place is not my home anymore

A leafless, naked tree I am
Standing on a place called nowhere
Encircled loneliness I'm condemned
Wasting inside out

This void cuts deep, the roots feel endless painâ¦

Were we the forest alive
And all the trees were tightly bound
Leaves have parched by ruthless sun
And the soil fed the roots no more

This void cuts deep, the pain is killing slowâ¦

I will free myself out, from this barren ground
And I will set forth to my journey now
This place is not my home anymore

As I feel the first touch of the sky
Out of the ground.
I let my roots become my feet now
