Now I'm on the verge of the woods I have conceived
Time to come to an end of searching
Trying to reach there at once to the hopes at horizon
Time to force all my staying power

(I knew) I was not mistaken
(I know) I'm about to reach
All the struggle I had is about to begone
Come nearer the dream
The closer I get the murkier scene I witness
Yet I refused to fail my venture
(This was) not the hurst I've expected
(And their) laughs polluted the sky
As my hopes fly like birds, I've watched them begone
Crestfallen dreams

Confronted by hubris of congenerous
Has pierced through my already shattered emotions
Laid down to the ground to unite the soil once more
And waited to perish but touched by fairy tales
