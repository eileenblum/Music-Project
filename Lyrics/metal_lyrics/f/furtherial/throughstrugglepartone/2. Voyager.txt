Startedâ¦
The hardest part I have achieved.
I'm moving forward and
I'm thinkingâ¦
The all that I had and how it's torn apart from me.
Hopingâ¦
To find my way all through the bleak and barren lands
I wonderâ¦
If I die trying, is there another world?
Flames took over
And gave us an eternal sorrow
But we know,
We'll meet again someday
Flames took over
And gave us an eternal sorrow
But we know,
We'll meet again someday
