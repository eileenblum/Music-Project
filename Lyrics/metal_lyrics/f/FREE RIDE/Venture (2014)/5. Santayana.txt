Fight for your life
Fight, fight, fight for perfection
Your life came into season
Fight, fight, fight for perfection
Fight, fight, life is the reason

I can never hide from what I am
But hide I must
Love and hate are bounded by a dam
Made out of trust, made out of trust

Forever and ever, fight for perfection
From evil break away
Forever and ever, find a star to light your way
Remember, never stray

Fight, fight, fight for perfection
Fight, fight, life is the reason

And I will never live a commoners life of pain
Filled with regret
Scars I bear are carved so deep down inside of my brain
I cannot forget, cannot forget

Forever and ever, fight for perfection
From evil break away
Forever and ever, find a star to light your way
Remember, never stray

Broken, without love
Spirit, it moves us

Future holds our memories, cause they will turn to past
Seize the day and grab it tightly, it might be your last
The world is not respectable, it's mortal and confused
Find your love and hold her tightly, let your starlight glow

The sky is vacant
It's a dark and endless void
So keep on fighting
Be the star that shines bright
