Thoughts of dying tear me apart
For I have never lived
Drowning in the sea of lies
In which I once believed
No more
Repression
This is not what you claim it to be
We are stuck in this endless loop
And the beat of the clock won't allow us to breathe

Break me down
Leave me empty-
Shallow minds and blackened hearts
What ever it takes
Burn my bridges
Tie my hands and let me drown

What ever it takes
This world will hold you back
Make you pull the weight again
And drag it to your grave

Into your grave

I have seen it all in my pointless life
Righteous people die in spite of being righteous
Wicked people go on living in spite of being wicked
Don't be too virtuous and don't be too wise

It keeps on pulling me under
Dragging me deeper below
There isn't much left of me and my spirit is broken
So I guess that your mission succeeds

We have been brought here to die
And to witness only constant decay
You are the ones to be blamed
Oh you're the ones to be blamed for it all

You're the ones to be blamed for it all
You motherfuckers

In circles
I'm moving
I can't break out of the loop
Escape from the routine

Break me down
Leave me empty-
Shallow minds and blackened hearts
What ever it takes
Burn my bridges
Tie my hands and let me drown

Let me drown again, Let me drown again
