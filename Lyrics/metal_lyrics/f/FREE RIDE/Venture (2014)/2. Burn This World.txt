War, Crusades
Patience is a virtue of
Gods and godless men
I see the fires, oh

I see the flames
Closing in now
The lies that you spread will now suffer from truth
All that you fathom, won't set you free

Cause I will spread my hands
And burn this world
I will take my chance
And start again
The fire will take you away

The fire will take you away
This I know

Oh, fucking burn
Liar

Death of all life, severed ties
You will return to
Dust, what you are, so fine

And from the sweat you will grow
From the sweat you will grow now
And all of the strain will bring new change

Closing in now
The greatness of love is so hard to conceive
All that you fathom
You won't believe

Cause I will spread my hands
And bless this world
I will breathe new life
And give you rain
Let all my children reign

Dull my senses,
Break my fences,
Transgress, pull through,
Find a way to make amends
A gift that's been given to few,
A gift that's been given to you
Because the skies are red,
The clock's slowly ticking away
In time of necessity be there by my side

At my crossroads

I can see a red sky
Dawn will bring eternal light
Mankind holds the one truth
Masterpiece of this world
