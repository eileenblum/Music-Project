Pain for every pleasure
Ending in decay
Folding under pressure
Better stand and pray
Don't you ever think that I will bend the knee 
Burn my sails and point me to the ragged sea

In the cold night - the shadows all around me 
No end in sight - horizons filled with dark clouds 
Su-ffo-ca-ted days filled with silent longing
Lone I have to roam
then I will 
Fall back I will fold today but I will win
Some Day I will leave this place with a smile upon my face

Smile upon my face 

In this game of faces
Try to find a man
Sane is found in traces
There is just no plan
It's time to take precaution Stand against the tide
They can take our lives but They can't take our pride

In the cold night - the shadows all around me 
No end in sight - horizons filled with dark clouds 
Su-ffo-ca-ted days filled with silent longing
Lone I have to 

Fall back I will fold today but I will win
Some Day I will leave this place with a smile upon my face
Now stand and pray

I suffer I've been left all alone 
From the dark I rise

There's pleasure
But pain is all you choose
Division- why are you breaking all the rules
The call that, the call that you receive
I need you, I need you to stay away from me
