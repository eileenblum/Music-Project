And so it ends,
Funeral, funeral pyre
More weight around my heart
Power, hold the sky
Hold it so it doesn't fall

Not today,
You won't be the one to take me down
Break my will to live

The likes of you can't bring me down
I walk with giants, not with men and sheep
Through life I realize, empty promises aren't hard to keep

Taken everything, taken everything

And then you find out
Your only ally
Became your foulest adversary
An act of treason
A lapse of reason
Now bear your sentence, everlasting

I made a vow, a code of honour
I will never bring shame to my name
I'll never bear the mark of Judas
We get to choose infamy or fame

The choice was yours
These are the last words,
These are the last words that I say

Taken everything
Away

Taken everything to pottersfield, a common grave

Fuck

And then you find out
Your only ally
Became your foulest adversary
An act of treason
A lapse of reason
Now bear your sentence, everlasting

And then you find out
Your only ally
Became your foulest adversary
An act of treason
A lapse of reason
Now bear your sentence, everlasting
