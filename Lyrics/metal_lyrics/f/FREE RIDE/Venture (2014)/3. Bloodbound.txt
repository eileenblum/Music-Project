Blood my dear,
It's boiling hot within my veins
Just so you know

Make a break
But everything I know in life
Is here right now

Pack your bags and venture
Go to the edge of the world
Memories fade to begin with
Another piece of me shatters alone

All my common problems
I had to resolve on my own
Some day I'll find a safe haven
Or a refuge that I'll call home

Cause I can take you there
And we can make it

And when you tear up my heart you will hear it
Stronger than ever before
And by the toll of the bells you will know that
It's time to settle the score
I know that some day in future
All of my claims I'll disown
Someday I may be a ruler
Never an heir to the throne

Never bear the crown,
The crown

Blood, pray for blood,
Sweet taste of copper drown the Sun
Blood, out for blood,
Beat of my heart will drown the sound
The flow of my blood

Fuck

Stay, cause I can feel
I'm alive in you
Cause I can take it,
Another night alone
But I can make it, we can make it, we can't stay here

And when you tear up my heart you will hear it
Stronger than ever before
And by the beat of my heart you will know that
It's time to settle the score
I know that some day in future
All of my claims I'll disown
Someday I may be a ruler
Never an heir to the throne

My heart with you lives
Bloodbound
