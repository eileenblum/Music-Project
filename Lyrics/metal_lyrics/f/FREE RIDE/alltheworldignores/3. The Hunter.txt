Morning crept upon the hills
Scents are running high
Another trophy for my wall
Your antlers will be mine
Royal crown with countless tines
Game is in it's prime
Two long days well worth the wait
Not a waist of time

Move against the wind
I am near you

Waiting for that special time till I see your face
Anchor point is always set, buttstock is in place
Manual is in my pouch, cather in the rye
I've got you in my iron sights, now it's time to die

Your lungs out of breath
As you're facing certain death
Take a life, child's play
Evil comes to take you away
Come here and taste the pain
All your cries, cried out in vain
Fall down, it's too late
Now it's time to feel my hate

Silent
Lethal
Going insane

Oh no, it's coming for me
Please God make it stop
Go, go away, please leave
Oh no, it's coming again
It's coming again

Silent
Lethal
Going insane
