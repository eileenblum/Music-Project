All the world ignores
Forgotten by mankind
They die alone

They get their oil through thought contol
The game is on did you see that goal
Just take your pills and get your thrills
Drink from the severs of Beverly Hills

What kind of a world we live in
When we desecrate our past
And everything we're given
We move from first to last

The goal is set and ready
But the path is slightly skewed
Sacrifice the many
For the interests of the few

The ink on the bills is drying
Waging all the wars
While people here are dying
All the world ignores

Forgotten by mankind
They die alone
They get their oil through thought contol
The game is on did you see that goal
Just take your pills and get your thrills
Drink from the severs of Beverly Hills

Find better deals on brand new wheels
As people kill for red cross meals
Ignore the poor, it's not your war
Change the channel, you've seen it all before

Scales of justice wither
Bodies are filled with flies
Chaos is where we slither
And it happens in front of us

We're all in this together
But our worlds are media shaped
Let's talk about the weather
As babies are getting raped

Emphasis on religion
Treat women like they're whores
While you're feeding us division
All the world ignores

Save me
Help me
Help me to see it through
Save me, save me
Save me from other people
Help me, help me to see it through

To see it through
Help me, oh help me to see

What kind of a world we live in
When we desecrate our past
And everything we're given
We move from first to last

We're all in this together
But our worlds are media shaped
Let's talk about the weather
As babies are getting raped

We can see but we are blind
These are scars of all mankind

Save me, Help me
Help me to see it through
Save me, save me
Save me from other people
Help me, help me to see it through

Join me, and close the door
The lion sleeps no more
And rise up, to fight your wars
It's time to mend your sores

ALL THE WORLD IGNORES!
