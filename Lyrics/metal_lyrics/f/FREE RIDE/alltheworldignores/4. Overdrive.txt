Moral decay making it's way through the blinded
Deprivation in it's purest form
Ready to slay, make us obey and accept it
eradication if we don't conform

All that was right is now cast aside and forgotten
Hell is rising and it smells like war
We shouldn't neglect, it's time to react and forsake it
Now it's enough of this fucking gore

So take control
Be the guide
Set free your soul
Let it fly

So take control
Be the guide
Charged by sublime-
Overdrive

And we will carry on
Till' death and long beyond
We'll sail to distant shores
And reach our goals

We won't give up the fight
Blackstars will now turn bright
And we shall pay the toll
We'll never fall

So take control
Be the guide
Set free your soul
Let it fly

So take control
Be the guide
Charged by sublime-
Overdrive

We won't give up the fight
Blackstars will now shine bright
All that was right now cast aside and forgotten
Hell is rising and it smells like war

So take control
Be the guide
Set free your soul
Let it fly

So take control
Be the guide
Charged by sublime-
Overdrive
