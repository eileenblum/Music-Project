Faith calling out your name somehow
Oh, your time has come, it's here and now

It only takes a spark to light up a fire
But nothing's flamable when you're stuck in myre
Things they have to change and though I am away
Trust me someday you will pay

Hear me
I only wanted to quietly be free
My voice is silent but I know you can hear me
The sword is beaten by some ink from a ballpen
Farewell the messenger of Seine

Faith calling out your name somehow
Oh, your time has come, it's here and now
Now,  lying here I feel the rain
Oh, will someone come to ease my pain

The weak they suffer, succumb and say Amen
This is a story of lovers and madmen
Who know there's more to life and know how to live it
You've got to push it to the limit

I am
I'm standing tall, not blinded by anger
Through all the years of remorse and the slander
My act was noble but it got out of my hands
You could never understand

You could not understand
What you have taken right from my hands

Faith calling out your name somehow
Oh, your time has come, it's here and now
Now,  lying here I feel the rain
Oh, will someone come to ease my pain

Fly too high and you will end up getting burned by the flame
At night I'm calling out your name
I am free, like the clouds that ride the magic of air
Scents of home, they run through your hair
