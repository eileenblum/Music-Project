Sun sets atop the pyramid
Red drenches blackened sky
Scream, the dawn approaches
All impure must die
Devour all you see
I am the chosen
Your blood flows in their veins
Time for you to claim them
Slice across the body 
Let the blood breath forth
Stain the stone crimson
The screams awaken her
Devour all you see
I am the chosen
Your blood flows in their veins
Time for you to claim them

Devour all you see
I am the chosen
Your blood flows in their veins
Time for you to claim them
