The wolves are coming
They taste our blood
With winters breath, they taste our fear
They're drawing closer, I take my stand
Ground shakes beneath the dying sky
No more mercy, fear your death
The final battle, our blades are drawn
Our gods are dying, the thunder cracks
On the boats, the giants come
The waves crash down on ancient shores
The horn sounds and the armies come
With my final breath I kill
My eyes burn with the dying sun
I stand with my hammer drawn
Watching, waiting for final strike
My attacks are swift and strong
Son of odin I will watch you die
No more mercy, fear your death
The final battle, our blades are drawn
Our gods are dying, the thunder cracks
On the boats, the giants come
The waves crash down on ancient shores
The horn sounds and the armies come
With my final breath I kill
My eyes burn with the dying sun
Vengeance twisted in the jaws of wolves
My eyes bleed, rage lunging forth
I take my stand, tighten my grasp
Mutilate your jaws, bath in your blood

No more mercy, fear your death
The final battle, our blades are drawn
Our gods are dying, the thunder cracks
On the boats, the giants come
The waves crash down on ancient shores
The horn sounds and the armies come
With my final breath I kill
My eyes burn with the dying sun
