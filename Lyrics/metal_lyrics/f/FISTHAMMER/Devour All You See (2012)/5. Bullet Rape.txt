Flesh, tears, limbs, break
Sight, aim, trigger, penetrate
Bullet raped
Taste of smoke and burning lead
Scream, crawl, trapped, hide
Search, fire, bleed, die
Bullet raped
Taste of smoke and burning lead
The bullets enter, penetrate flesh
Stare into my eyes, I take your breath

[Lead Svalgard]

Bullet raped, scream for mercy
Penetrate deeper, pray for an end
