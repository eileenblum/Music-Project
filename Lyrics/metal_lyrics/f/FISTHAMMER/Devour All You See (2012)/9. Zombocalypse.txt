World plagued by undead
Body count rises high
Humans turn into zombies
Blood runs dry
You hunger but there is no end
You try to taste but there is no flesh
Bite your arm then remove your head
Eat yourself until your dead
Streets are filled with corpses
Flesh removed from the bone
Not a single heartbeat heard
Humans died long ago
You hunger but there is no end
You try to taste but there is no flesh
Bite your arm then remove your head
Eat yourself until your dead
Your time has come
There is no turning back
Feed or hunger forever
Commit your final act
First you eat your leg
Then you eat your arm
Tear apart your chest
Then you eat your heart
