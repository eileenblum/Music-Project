Your men did fall
Now flag is raised high
A flood has come. Inundate your town
Down stream, up bank
Memorial plans rearranged
Sinking through pride. 
Beginning shape and color
Dam gives way to holy war
Salute unholy flag
Razorwaves, man to gore
Water swells the flesh, cuts relieve
the pressure of this funeral tide
Your hopes, your dreams
Caught in this norm unseen
Destruction reigns
Beginning shape and color
Dam gives way to holy war
Salute unholy flag
Razorwaves, man to gore
Consumed by the tide
Barbed wire shreds your hide
Flames jump forth
On raft and home alike
Caught under the loot
Brought on by suit
Your ways, convert them now

[Lead Welch]

Reach for your last breath
Under the crest 
Of razor waves
Steer, steer your raft
Your raft ashore
Retain your core
Elements converge
Where wrath meets scourge 
And destroy
