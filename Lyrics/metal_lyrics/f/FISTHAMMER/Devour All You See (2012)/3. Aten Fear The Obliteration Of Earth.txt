Piercing through the spacial realm
Black holes torn open in the void
We came here on ships of fire
We will burn you to the ground
First we raise to to the sky
Drain you of your life force
Warning to those below
Blood raining from the stars
Storm of fire, waves scorch the ground
The land will turn to glass
Your flesh will rot away
Your seed will be destroyed
Crying for its death
Life is a nightmare
Throw yourself into the flames
Another murderous escapade
Blood raining from the stars
Storm of fire, waves scorch the ground

[Lead Svalgard]

Blood raining from the stars
Storm of fire, waves scorch the ground
I am death
I am become destroyer of worlds
