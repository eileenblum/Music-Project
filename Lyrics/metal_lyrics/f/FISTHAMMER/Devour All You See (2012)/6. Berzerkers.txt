Where have these winds taken you
Better remove your eyes
Tear out destructive visions
Come out seeking why
Leave this land alone
Burn your fear instead
Smoke clouds spell confidence
Reap hope, reward your inner sense
Hope and pride succeed from lies
Live free or die
Create your will
Use your own skills
Deny their threats
And fight with your every breath
Flames like fear consume you
They are never full
When their through
Tear out their roots
And learn to fly
