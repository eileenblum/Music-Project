We paint blood on battle fields
The queens claw held up high
Ice, fire, kiss of death
Flames engulf the sky
Demon face your master for your time has come to die
Scream for mercy I stab your throat, no one will leave alive
Attack, our swords held high
Attack, blood rains from the sky
Sharpen the blade, the battle axe, set sail for frozen land
Sacred flame will meet it's match, she will die at my hand
We have fought your armies, your cavalry, your men
Bring forth your true form demon
Your reign of darkness ends
Attack, our swords held high
Attack, blood rains from the sky
Stand atop the castle walls, walk into the shrine
Flames engulf the sky tonight your time has come to die
Your pawn will try to slit her throat, but he will feel my blade
My wrath is relentless there is nowhere to hide
Attack, our swords held high
Attack, blood rains from the sky
