We have made you what you are
Soon the time will come
Taste sweetened by the years
You will know when you're done
We've been waiting for so long
No you're getting ripe
Scream there is no escape
Terror builds in your eyes
We've birthed perfection, waiting long
Let the feast begin tonight
Moistened flesh beyond your years
You can even tell it's right
The way the flame licks the skin
Time to take another bite
We only eat our young
When their time has come to die
We feast upon the harvest 
That they took from our lives
Harvest your flesh, Harvest your death
Harvest your flesh, Harvest your death
