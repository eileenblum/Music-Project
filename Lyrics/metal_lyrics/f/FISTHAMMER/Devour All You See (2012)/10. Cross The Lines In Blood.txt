Sacrifice, blood of the innocent
Taken from the young
Souls, searching for entry
A door open for one, blood forms a star
To unleash a god of death
Demon, sent to eath, a serpent of the crest
Lacerate, stand above the alter 
With your blade held high
Penetrate, The skull of the lamb
And the body will rise
Scream for mercy as the reign of light ends
She brings forth a new age releasing demon in the man
River of death flows, bringing souls to Satan's side
Army grows ever stronger, I will watch your god die
Lacerate, stand above the alter 
With your blade held high
Penetrate, The skull of the lamb
And the body will rise
