Take Me Away From This Life Of Misery
Grant Me Salvation In The Kingdom Of Thine
Allow Me The Wisdom Of Thy Years
Belief Is Strong-This Is The Time

(No More - Will I Suffer
No More - Will I Yearn
This Life - Is Now Over
In Darkness - I Shall Burn)

Sorrow Breaks My Body As I Slip Away
The Cataclysm Of Pain Rips Thru My Soul
Life Is What It Always Has Been
And Thru My Death I Take Control

[Chorus]

My Lifetime Before Me As I Leave This World
Transcending To A Dimension Aeons Old
One Last Breath Of This Pain-Filled Life
One Last Breath As I Slowly Die

[Chorus]

I Sit In Silence The End Is Near
And Thru It All I Have No Fear
I Sit In Silence The End Is Complete
The Pyre Of Death I Feel Its Heat
