My Life Is Changing Before Me &amp;..
Things I Felt I No Longer Feel
All My Beliefs Have Turned To Nothingness
All That Remains Is This Bleak Emptiness

No - What Has Happened To Me
Everything That I Was - Now I Can t Even See
As The Changes Destroy My Mind
Life Is Passing Before My Eyes

Things Weren't This Way, I Once Was Strong
But Now I'm Weak, Can't Carry On
Crushed By Everything That Made This
I Can No Longer Take This

No - What Has Happened To Me
Everything That I Was - Now I Can t Even See
As The Changes Destroy My Mind
Life Is Passing Before My Eyes

Alone In Anguish, Cast In Silence
Feelings Of Hatred, Masked Thru Violence
Frustrations Overwhelming-Endless Misery
Caged Emotions - Tears Apart Me

Look Beyond My Inner Self
Past My Soul Into Hell
See The Things That Made My Life
Feel The Pain As I Die

Quickly, My Life Did Change
Nevermore Shall I Feel Sane
Waiting, To End This Life
Waiting I Take This Knife

Quickly, My Life Is Fading
Nevermore Shall I Feel Pain
My Life Has Passed Before Me
An Ending That I Shall Not See
