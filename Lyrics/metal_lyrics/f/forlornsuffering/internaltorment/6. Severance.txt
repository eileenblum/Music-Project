Trapped Inside This Unknown Void Of Life I Now Find Myself
Drawn Across This Infinite Depth Of Pain My Life Can Never Be Saved

Suffer Through The Light Embrace The Darkness Feel The Burning Pain
Seep Through Your Life As It Tears Your Soul Apart
Know The End Will Soon Be With You
Now My Nightmare Is Your Reality

I Reach Across This Tomb
Blood Flows From This Wound
A World I Never Knew
A World Together We ll Go

Severed From My Mind My Consciousness Derives Its Last Embrace
Death Above It All I Now Await Its Final Release

Torn From Visions Unknown
In Darkness Dying Alone
Brought Back To Where I Belong
Death Embrace Me Once More

An Infinitude Of Pain Brought About By My Own Life
Twisting Out Of Consciousness Locked In This Tomb
And As I Wait For The Almighty One To Put An End To It All
My Soul Descends From This Womb

And In The Darkness I Find My Withered, Shattered Body Wasting Away
My Life, A Tragedy Was Nothing But Pain
I Pray That Consciousness Leaves Me Soon &amp; Releases Me From This Hell
For I Know The End Brings Nothingness And An End To The Pain

Nothing But Death Remains
A Final Release From The Pain
A Severing Twist From This Knife
An End To This Darkened Life

A Final Tragedy
Something You'll Never See
An Unknown Darkness Awaits
Taking Me From This Place
