We're the starving victim of the world you made for you,
your thirst of power's sucking all away!
Incrimination can't erase you,
no, not even justice can, nor impositions!

Slave!
Of their low blackmail,
in the abusive frame of hush overcoming our words
of repressed pain and intolerable hate!
Raped!
Forever and ever,
we're deranged by paying unmerciful rage,
son of their lust and abominable blame!

Now the time of slavery is coming to an end,
we'll burn the flesh of sanctity with hate!
You'll restrain no more, you'll repent for your inexcusable deeds!

We can't forgive the words of your deceit,
our pain bleeds through our scars!
We will dare you all to face the bloody fakes you made!

You will smell abysmal terror corroding your spirit deep inside,
with fury we will come to rip you all apart!
You will decay, in the day with no fate!

We will turn into executors of this rotten reign,
bleeding you dry until you breathe no more!
And if obscurity will outlast,
no, we'll not resign ourselves to this calvary!

Slave!
Of their low blackmail,
in the abusive frame of hush overcoming our words
of repressed pain and intolerable hate!
Raped!
Forever and ever,
we're deranged by paying unmerciful rage,
son of their lust and abominable blame!

While the earth is stained with blood of innocents and leeches,
A catastrophic truth that comes to life!
There is no end to pain and suffer,
no, no we cannot control this cyclical time!
But through the ages of oppression we will never end this fight,
this sacrifice on altars of human kind!
In this hopeless grave, through these burning scars,
disintegrate the vile!

We can't forgive the words of your deceit,
our pain bleeds through our scars!
We will dare you all to face the bloody fakes you made!
