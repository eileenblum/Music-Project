Annihilation of flesh
but not annihilation of lies
World is the victim of men
That for money will sell their own life
An acid rain bleeds from clouds
While our breath opens scars in the sky
Tar is new sand of today
Tomorrow the sun will never rise

Die, you deserve to die
You deserve to die in pain
Feel your slow decay
Feel the time that slowly ends

Mind corruption
Infection of men lost for deception
Oppressed
Trapped in a cage of words, religion, no
A cancer that devotes
The Knowledge thing of the ancient world

Flames around
A mourning veil of truth is falling down
Black snow
Venomous snow's corroding our
Skin, like dust
Upon the flesh is flying away from you
I see you naked in front of me alone
Die now

Feed the hate
With truths you never know and you'll be
Killed by hate
That will be back again to kill

Need to suffer
