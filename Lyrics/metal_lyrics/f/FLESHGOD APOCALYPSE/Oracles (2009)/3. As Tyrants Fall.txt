Fall

Hidden the truth for the masses
By the leaders of an unconscious sickness
Fenced in a paling of ignorance
By the shepherds with their unending falseness
Day by day become thing of past

Dominators rule the flesh with precepts made of lie
Confining the fool race in an eternal night
Despots set the seed of fake in feeble human mind
Inoculating superstition burns
While the oppressors rise

Dethrone them all
Destroy the kingdom of those tyrants
Taking the place they once had
New world of false promise will born
Under the name of brand new man
Rise above them
Build a new kingdom
Find a complete new dominion
Setting up the columns
For a temple of false new gods

Tyrants replaced by the tyrants as new leaders
Are just unconscious victims
Failing effort to refound a reign
By shepherds condemned by their own power
One by one they have to collapse

Never ending spires that hold them
Like a vortex deadly dance
Cyclic conjuration that deceives all
Slaves to their own nature dread

Paradox of entropy of failing reign of clay
