Plague of humanity, slavish victim of
All his dreadful deeds
Leperous cadavers, bodies tied with lash
Scorching through cinder's veins

I take back my flesh
My cage

Suffered shifting, crystallizing instinct
Taking back my corpse

Dust, I regain my dust
Ash, relieve my ash

How can I reach this new stamina walking in death
Trick of my nature ingrown, of my fate

Deliverance, all of my rage infects again vacuum flesh
Fallen from grace, infinite hate, dwelling again in my trap
Infernal curse, draining the blood, as I retrieve my carcass in pain
New lymph for my

Dust, I regain my dust
Ash, relieve my ash

My plague is my life

I celebrate this incestuous rite, opium destiny
Ash only ash that I bring to life, dust only dust I absorb
Newborn creature walks among the dead, falling castle of sand
Dread, lecherous this dichotomy, this godforsaken thanatos

Deliverance, all of my rage infects again vacuum flesh
Fallen from grace, infinite hate, dwelling again in my trap
Infernal curse, draining the blood, as I retrieve my carcass in pain
New lymph for my

My plague is my life
