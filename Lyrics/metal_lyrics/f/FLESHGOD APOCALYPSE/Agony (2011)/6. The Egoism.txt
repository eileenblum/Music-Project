Scream for the shame of your ego
To dominate it
Reflecting fear unsatisfied
To kill
Lost in the maze of a treason
Intoxicated
Destined to suffer from mental insanity

Dark is the dream of your demons
Revealing will to subjugate
They need to dominate the men
Crubs will remain on their own table
A solitary king

Forever craving hate
Your Reich has come
The masses are ablazed
As you despise their own innocence!
Victim
Forever they degrade
You need for more
Your kingdom is in flames
As you create their indifference!

They will fear your coming
The selfish dogma
There is no sharing in your life
You feel lost in the haze of oblivion
You're self addicted
Destined to twist all the rules of humanity

Minds are deranged for your sentence
Your domination is a perception of your deception
There is no one to sacrifice that's your oppression
Dust will remain on you
A misanthropic king

Forever craving hate
Your Reich has come
The masses are ablazed
As you despise their own innocence!
Victim
Forever they degrade
You need for more
Your kingdom is in flames
As you create their indifference!

Si vitam inspicias hominum, si denique mores, cum culpant alios: quia nemo sine crimine vivit

Discriminate to enfeeble
It's your intention
The pandemonium in your head
You set all of your goals for your reason
To rise your banners
Moved by the wind of a twisted obscenity

Thorned is the crown of your falseness
It's scraping your skin
As you will worship your own I
Obey!
Mud will be food for your hunger
That brings you under
A mandatory king

Forever craving hate
Your Reich has come
The masses are ablazed
As you despise their own innocence!
Victim
Forever they degrade
You need for more
Your kingdom is in flames
As you create their indifference!
