They step in the dark
Mystification is delight
You taste the fear of men who fight
Against who rape their minds
Enwrap them all now in your scary spires
Despise the fools until they die
Their blood stains their demise

You set your own rules in hate to set aside
The dreams of those too blind to see
To dominate fragile minds
And make the foolish ones imprisoned on the liar side
To kill the truth of those who tries
To stop the tide

You, mystificator
You, the one we despise
Falling egemony
You, the fallen empire!

Discete aut disce quam ubi non accusator, ibi non judex
Si vis pacem para bellum, cur qui tetigerit picem inquinabitur ab ea
Impares nascimur, pares morimur, ergo iustitiam quaerimus, rem omni auro
Cariorem cur pulvis sumus et in pulverem reverterimus

You drag them in hell
Dictating blinding fears to hide
The guilty deeds that fill your life
To desecrate the vile
You poured the rotten lies into your grail
You're burning bridges with yourself
You choke in deadly pain

You, mystificator
You, the one we despise
Falling egemony
You, the fallen empire!
