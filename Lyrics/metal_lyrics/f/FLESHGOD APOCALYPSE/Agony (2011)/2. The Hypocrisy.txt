Stand for your crusade against the light
Condemned before the attack that leads you to the final fight
Into the abyss, reduced to ashes
You serve the miserable scum
Enslaved forever in a devastating state of pain
To purify your behaviour
The poison in your veins is shining in dark reflections
You're  lost in the eyes of (the) one who's lost

Despite is led by your regrets
Shall all your inner demons rise
Doomed by remorse
The flags you wave are just a vexil of a fallen right
Are all your certainties decayed?
The time has come to face your torment now
Sentenced to crave for your life!

Enslaved
As you mislead us again
You're the one to blame
Forsake the shame of your decay!

Kill!
We kill!
Craving to kill now!
Kill!
We kill!
They will be damned!

Dreams in delirium, sacrificed
To preach the false instead of truth: a scary pantomime!
Outside you're golden, lead is your burden
Unveil the rot you have inside
The abominable one is screaming for his own demise
Shall our creepy glory rise
Behind a deadly masquerade losing salvation
You, with all your aims forever gone

Despite is led by your regrets
Shall all your inner demons rise
Doomed by remorse
The shining banner mystifies the rot you predicate
Are all your victims crucified?
A conscience pulled aside in torment now
Sentenced to crave for your life

Kill!
We kill!
Craving to kill now!
Kill!
We kill!
They will be damned!

We march through the deserts of sorrow
We witness your doom
Crushing the limbs of the one who defiled
Pain reciprocal, retribution
Infected entity
You're condemned to burn in this hell!

Enslaved
As you mislead us again
You're the one to blame
Forsake the shame of your decay!
