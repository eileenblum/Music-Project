Servants of tyrants and plutocracy
Victims of unending power
We will erase the despotical spreading pestilence
Stabbing who sits on the throne
Washing away all the precepts of righteousness
Dragging minions down to hell
Stubborn offensive  's coming now  to erase this painful slow decay
Crushing fortress of our  pain!

We rise  in this glorious fight
Kill!
This time
There will be no mercy for you

Kill!
We'll overthrow kings
Dethrone the kings!
There is no mercy for those who debate
Kill!
With great disdain we rise up from the ash  of our fate
Your empire will be falling down

Killed by demonic tortures, so provocative
Masses are trapped in dementia
Destined to starve for insanity  indomitable
We will reborn  in disdain
We'll overthrow the tyrannical overlords
Strangling those who debate
There is no mercy  striking now to smash this false supremacy
Prevaricators will die

Pain!
We march in this glorious fight
Kill!
This time
There will be no mercy for you

Kill!
We'll overthrow kings
Dethrone the kings
There is no mercy for those who debate
Kill!
With great disdain we rise up from the ash  of our fate
Your empire will be falling down

Quis habet fortius certamen quam qui nititur vincere seipsum?

Pain!
We march in this glorious fight
Kill!
This time
There will be no mercy for you

Kill!
We'll overthrow kings
Dethrone the kings!
There is no mercy for those who debate
Kill!
With great disdain we rise up from the ash  of our fate
Your empire will be falling down
