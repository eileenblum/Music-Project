Killing, stabbing, poisoning their souls
I masticate the flesh of those who cheated
Tasting, trapping, tearing, flesh of men in decay
Inflicting a neverending pain to those who wait for a wasted salvation
My godforsaken prey
I dominate the minds of those who lie to build their own satisfaction
Shall all your fears rise again!

Blood from the scars for another god
Crawling in agony!
Scream for the scars for another god
The guilt is the master of all

Blood from the scars for another
God that is going to drag you in bloody fangs

Die!
For your insanity
There is no light to save you from my darkness
Pay!
Once and for all
Your prayers will be vain
There is no god to bring you anywhere else

Die!
For your betrayal
You suffer for your sin
When all your flesh's becoming food for demons
Pay!
Forevermore
Your claims will not be heard
There will be blood in every moment for all times

Crushing, caging, their bloody limbs
I devastate the sons of my creation
Scorching, blasting, tempting , skin of insanity
Inflicting a misanthropic hate to those who starve in eternal damnation
My unforgiving wish
To subjugate the ones who lived in hate to perpetrate their deception
Shall all your fear rise again!

Blood from the scars for another god
Crawling in agony!
Scream for the scars for another god
The guilt is the master of all

Kill to condemn all the human race
Crawling in agony
Kill to destroy all its dreadful fakes
Despising destiny
