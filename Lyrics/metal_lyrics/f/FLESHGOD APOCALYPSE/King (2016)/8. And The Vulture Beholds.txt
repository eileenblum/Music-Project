Cast out, ignored
Disdained and scorned
Humiliated by those Iâll rise above
Like a vulture
I want for the lion to die
Natural right set by purity of blood
Ever longing the role Iâm entitled to
I will never renounce to that crown
For no reason at all

Time has come for me to reign
My throne I claim now
Oh father
Let your heart hear
Your firstborn words
I feel itâs time for me
To rule this world

Tired, fed up,
Sick of it all
Iâm surrounded by crooks and prostitutes
In this court
Leeches suck royal blood without a brake
Weaving in shadow to pursue their goals
Imperceptible revolt against the lord
Neverending conspiracy
Shame on this pharisaic court

I, amongst the lies
Screaming but silent
Thrown away while I conspire
For I will live no more in the shadows
And Iâll never surrender myself to this fate
In my disgrace bred by deceivers
I lift my head
With the heart in flames
Without fear I will satisfy my desire
Castigating the traitors as I overcome

Irate, furious,
Out of control
I will kill all these tamperers one by one
Destroying obstacles
Standing between me and my rise
Annihilating the aims of betrayers
Iâll extort what is mine with my own hands
Desecrating my ancestry line
To prevail on this land
