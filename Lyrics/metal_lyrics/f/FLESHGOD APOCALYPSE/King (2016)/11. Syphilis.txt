âMy beloved king
I compose this letter to you
In the sleepless nightmare hours of the night
Wandering through cold empty corridors
I can hear these walls
Screaming your magnificent name and
I can find no peaceâ

I have to protect my breed
No matter who I love, no matter how I feel
Itâs in my pure drops, itâs in my royal seed

My great love donât let me fall apart
Desire is killing me
Donât you let me drown in tears

Donât cry
You know itâs a hopeless wish
No future for us, but only bitter tears
Preserve your frail heart
From an unending bleed

âOh lord
How long shall I bear the burden
Of my tormenting silence
And live my life in the shadows
This is a frightful conflict, this is not life
Please, come and take me
Please, my love, pleaseâ

I will never come again
I forbid this love forever
As time has come to forget
And leave it to the past
So make the right choice to save us
Before itâs too late
Canât soil my blood for nothing
And waste my heritage
Canât blacken my name
And lose my purity
