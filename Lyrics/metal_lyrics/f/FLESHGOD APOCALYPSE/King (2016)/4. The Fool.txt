Die...of laughter in delight before a living dead
Victim into this masquerade, forgot who I am
This story is driving me mad
My life is hanging by a thread that is about to break
Suicidal tendencies burn inside the mind of this miserable man
Is it life? Is it death?
I don't give a shit
Still...
Is it life? Is it death?
When you fool yourself
Fucked

Bleed behind this painful mask I wear
I'm falling from a misleading grace
The life I dreamed is killing me

Stuck on the tightrope
Staring down to the void beneath
In imposed equilibrium
I stand swinging in my indecision
Uncompassionate result of a fearing existence
I don't care if my time has come
All I want is my liberation

Drunk, I make it through the night with spirits hand in hand
My soul must be anesthetized, I can't bear this pain
To my frustration engaged 
Just like to get laid with the worst enemy I've inside 
but I cannot change myself
No way to squeeze blood from the stone that I am
Is it life? Is it death?
Fuck!
Is it life? Is it death?
When you fool yourself
Why?

Bleed behind this painful mask I wear
I'm falling from a misleading grace
The life I dreamed is killing me
Bleed behind this painful mask I wear
I'm falling from a misleading grace
The life I dreamed is tearing me down
