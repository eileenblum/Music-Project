In this passing world
Thereâs no time to regret
Lifeâs too fast to fold
So why lie to yourself
âcause thereâs nothing more
âCanât you see my light?â
That what mirrors behold
âDonât speak, let me shine brightâ
You, my flower blown by the whispers of age
Beauty in the storm that relentlessly fades

Cold through the winter of life
Pulled down below into an ocean of lies
My withering rose

What a dreadful curse
Cast by nature on life
Nothing lasts forever
Canât turn back the hands of time
Like a grain of sand
Pray for me my Lord
In its hourglass awaits
âFor the burden I holdâ
For the very end when all torments decay
And the vanity will leave your heart in peace

âMy lady listen to your beloved King
I can see your eyes are now scared
And veiled by the mist of despair
Do not be conquered by your own fears
Donât let the illusion of perfection seduce you
Or you will be lost foreverâ

Desperate while my youth fades away
Sorrow is dragging my soul down
Thereâs no word you can say to save me
My love
