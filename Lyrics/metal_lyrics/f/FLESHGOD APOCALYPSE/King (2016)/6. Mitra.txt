Let the almighty come inside your pure heart
And wash away your fears
The holy spirit will fulfil you
In the shadows where ours sins are concealed
There is no pain and no bleed
No suffering at all in this godly night
You will be blessed by my seed as we pray together
âI and you as one
Kneel down before the holy godâ true believer
Kneel down before the holy god
Let me take your soul
Kneel down before the holy god true believer
As for a progeny to come weâll sacrifice it in the name of

Mitra, icon of our god
Mitra, a god of scum

I want to take you, I want to feel you
I need to have you until you need too

I want to take you, I want to feel you
I will possess you until Iâll kill you

Let the shepherd call the name of his land
And lead it back to the fold
Iâll be the sheepdog protecting you in the sunlight
And the wolf in the dark
Like virgin Mary conceived in miraculous deceit
On that holy night
You shall accept in your blooming flesh
My spiritual power
Key to paradise
Kneel down before the holy god true believer
Let me take your soul
True believer
As for a progeny to come weâll sacrifice it in the name of

Mitra, icon of our god
Mitra, a god of scum
Mitra, icon of our lord
Mitra, the lord of cum
