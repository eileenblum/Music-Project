Before you squander this treasure
Just let me hold it in my hands
I feel the weight of metal
I feel it's gravity again

At the side of this splendour
I just become insane

I, alone on the sly with my drug
Fill my veins with this gold dust
Astray, i feel alive again

Internal state of anger
A neverending disease
Can't feel ashamed of myself
Cannot be blamed for my greed
I'd do whatever it takes to satisfy my need

I, alone on the sly with my drug
Fill my veins with this gold dust
Astray, i feel alive again

Above the sky
Through diamonds and stars
In this place i belong
I relieve my heart
High on gold

Pervaded in pleasure
I let my greedy soul fly
In delirium i attain my obscene desires

I, alone on the sly with my drug
Fill my veins with this gold dust
Astray, i feel alive again
