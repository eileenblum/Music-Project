Carving my soul through the flesh
While this void is still breeding the sin
I'm torn apart by the vile executor
As we're torn apart as the executors kill
Concealed in seas of perdition
Where the mother eternity has drowned
In the shade of this black superstition
The King of bastard seed's destined to burn

Like the bridges of Athens
Time of oppression and decay!
My vengeance will burn
Injustice and sorrow!
Are scorching the land of the slaves

Son of the dark
Lord of the solitude
On the throne of his will
Derangement of a soul
The seed of fears
Born as a king of despair

Bless thee who'll find sacred weapons
That will lead him to victory
Dominating the leverage of reason
He rises killing the brigands of will

Sinis is waiting the vagabond
Lacerating the wisdom with the trees
Skiron's feeding the giant turtle
While Procrustes is ripping his limbs

Glimpses of glory appearing in my dreams
As I rest under this holy sky
Condemned! The land of the fathers
As I stand before the eternal demise

Under the stone lay the arms
While my fate is revealing to me
Looking up at the throne of my father
I'll follow the path that will lead to the sea
Cursed is the breed of my body
Thousands of drops that fall to the ground
Now I know for the sake of the deities
The king of coward seed's sentenced to burn
