I'm prevaricated, enslaved within my fears
Misplaced by sorrow and despair
Can't betray my seal
I must engage the reflection of Pasifae's guilt
The seed of Knossos dominates
This realm of desperate keens

Gates of terror
Shine before my shield
'Cause I'm born to become a hero
To defeat or be torn? Whatever!

I deliberate, to hush my inner screams
She rips the darkness of my thoughts
Can't deny this deal
I won't get lost through this maze
Holding hard this thread
For I will slay the shame of Crete
My path will lie ahead

God Poseidon
I emerge from seas of tears
And march towards my fears
The son of vengeance calls

Fall is the source of my victory
As there's no force without a fight
So let me stride on this path that will lead me to the end
Of a twisted life, that stands before my eyes

Now, next to the core
I see the longhorned shade
His smelling breath corrupts the air
He's growling with disdain
A vacillate when I see this abnormal being
But with your help I will be safe
I can find the strength to kill
