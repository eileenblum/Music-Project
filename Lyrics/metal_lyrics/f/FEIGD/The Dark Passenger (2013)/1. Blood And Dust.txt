Born in a world full of chaos and blood
Forged in the hands of the bearers of doom
Prepare yourself for this honour and...
Carry out the order of destruction

Charged with the command
Of this machinery of hate
Fueled with the anger of thousands
Prepared for the war task to eliminate

Arise young warrior, arise to your fate
You will never stop before your task is done
Light the war torch on fire
See the ashes as the only remains of this world

It's time to fulfill your born upon destiny 
You are a warrior of great power
Save this world from decay
Release the forces of liberation

March into war and defeat the enemy 
Destroy anything that opposes you
You are the judge and executioner

When your enemies lies dead before you
When everything is just blood and dust
When you sit on the triumphant throne 
We shall finally have peace
