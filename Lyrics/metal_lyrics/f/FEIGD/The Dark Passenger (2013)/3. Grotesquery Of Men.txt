In the world of men there is always evil
The purest intentions turn to dark ambition
Leading nations towards a deadly goal
Being such as world, world domination
As a shepard to the sheep
The sheep follows the shepard
Leading the blind into the new found light
Destruction is needed to rebuild
To rebuild a world in light of perfection

Purify the lost souls 
Show them the way to the light
Resist and you will die
There can be no other way
Create to destroy
Destroy to create
The grotesque nature of men
Shows itself in truest form

At the end of a bloody era
There is new found light in the darkness
Balance is about to restore itself 
A new day is rising
Time for redemption has come
