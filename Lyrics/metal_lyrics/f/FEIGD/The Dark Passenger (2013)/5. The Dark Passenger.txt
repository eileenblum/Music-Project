Darkness embraces the mind
Entertained by a morbid compulsion
The feeling of a inner power rise
A killing spree arising
A darkness that cannot be stopped
Breaking out of it's master's chains
The dark passenger emerge...

I am the voice in your mind
I am the glooming darkness
I am the rising power
I am the evil servant
I am the will to kill
I am the dark passenger...

As a shadow rising from the bursting flames
Uncontrollable forces taking over
Blood stains covering the earth
The hunger for blood diminishes
As the darkness is fed 
The dark passenger can rest in peace
