Born into a world dominated by war and hate
Hate revealed by the killing hands 
Martyrs by the hand of greed
Greed controlling the minds of dictators

Screams of death heard from the battlefield
Cruelty of the evil kind feel the bloodlust settle in 
Possessed by the hunt for human flesh 
Satisfaction achieved from the soon to be taken graves

Cities burned to the ground
Memory remains of what once was
Blasted from the face of the earth
Incinerated into oblivion...
