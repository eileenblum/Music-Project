We have created the ultimate computer
To solve all of earth's problems to save man from his future
But the programs we have spawned had gone the evil way 
And gained control of cyborg minds techno-sanity

Day and night, you had your fucking way you waged war with the skies
Your new-found powers have only given rise
The termination of humans it is man against machine
From out in space Satan cyborg screams 

Cybernetic energetic
Mutilating fear creating
Iconoclastic Polyplastic
All mechanic Pro-Satanic
Sample my machinery!

Your calculations must have been in error
Your atomic batteries cannot go on forever
Android-robot-cyborg-monsters all break down and cry
For psychotic computers have run out of time.
