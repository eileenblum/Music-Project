She fell downstairs and I heard her neck crack she went
I ran down quick I dropped to my knees but she is dead
I said, "oh no, god please do not die!"
I said, "wake up" as I started to cry
It was too late, he had taken up her soul
I will never let you go as I speak into her blank face
Push her in the closet just to keep your hair the same place
I feel so hot what the hell I would have my way and I am compelled 
As I attacked her cold and balmy flesh
She was rock hard

And so in time the months had passed away 
My poor baby's skin became a darkish colour grey
Her body became a massive stone her flesh had rotted to the bone
Although she is gone, my love will never die
She was rock hard

She will never know the way she makes me feel
As she is lying there as cold as steel 
It feels so good it goes straight to my brain 
Those tears come pouring out not unlike like the rain
She was rock hard
