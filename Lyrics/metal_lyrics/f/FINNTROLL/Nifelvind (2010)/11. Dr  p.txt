NÃ¤r svedjor brÃ¤nnes
Bliva min moderskalk av aska

Nifelvind, hÃ¶r mitt namn
Gyttjeblod, sÃ¤nk ditt huvud dÃ¤r jag vandra

Ur varje froskallla bittra
Onda dÃ¶dliga natt
Ur varje vÃ¥r dÃ¥ inget vÃ¤xte
DÃ¥ sÃ¤den aldrig steg

Nifelvind, hÃ¶r mitt namn
Gyttjeblod, sÃ¤nk ditt huvud dÃ¤r jag vandra

Vid varje offerblot
Fovande vid roten av varje galg
TÃ¤ndande gnistan i mÃ¶rdarens blick
Och sveket i dem som blodet sÃ¥lt

Nivelvind, hÃ¶r mitt namn
Gyttleblod, min vilja blevo din

Ur varje frostkalla, bittra
Onda dÃ¶dliga natt
Ur varje vÃ¥r dÃ¥ inget vÃ¤xte
DÃ¥ sÃ¤den aldrig steg

Nivelvind, hÃ¶r mitt namn
Gyttjeblod, sÃ¤nk ditt huvud dÃ¤r jag vandra

[English translation:]

[Manslaughter]

When the land burns
My ancient chalk is made of ashes

Wind of underworld, hear my name
Dirty Blood, sink your head to where I wander

From every freezing cold, hateful
Evil, deadly nights
From every spring when nothing grew
At that time seeds never rose

Wind of underworld, hear my name
Dirty Blood, sink your head to where I wander

With every blood sacrifice
Sleeping in the roots of every gallows
The lighting spark in the glance of a murderer
And deceit in those who sold the blood of others

Wind of underworld, hear my name
Dirty Blood, my desire became yours

From every freezing cold, hateful
Evil, deadly nights
From every spring when nothing grew
At that time seeds never rose

Wind of underworld, hear my name
Dirty Blood, sink your head to where I wander

All cultures have similarities in their myths and folklore.
Tales of bitter dead walking again, sagas of good and evil and songs of divine ascension.
Some fly upwards while others delve deep into the archaic undertones of being human.
These stories that in some form probably date back to the beginning of speech and song, are a fascinating lore that maybe defines our humanity but also our feelins of loss concerning our contacts to nature and the bestiality that lies within every human being.
This album is a celebration of those myths, some new some ageless.
Some true, some complete nonsense.
That is the nature of folklore.
Under every root and stone lays a story heard but untold.
