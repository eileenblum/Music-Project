En eld Ã¶ver vinterns himmel
Drakens svans en bister glÃ¶d
SÃ¥ fallit, brÃ¤nt
Korsat nordens skyar
FÃ¶rintelsens vak
FÃ¶rkolnad mark
DÃ¤r den red
Den brÃ¤nde fÃ¤, den brÃ¤nde trÃ¤d

BrÃ¤nda lik och fÃ¶rkolnat kÃ¶tt
Svart ligger jordar
Rykande, dÃ¶da
MÃ¤nniskans gÃ¥rdar
Den spy sin tjÃ¤ra
Eld, frÃ¤tande galla
KrÃ¤lar sig runt i drÃ¥pets lusta
En natt dÃ¥ riken falla

Ve draken, ormars orm
Ingen sett maken till gudars storm
Midvinterdraken

Ur vinters kyla dÃ¥ draken gled
Det mindes man i slÃ¤kters led
Den dÃ¶k i jorden, begravd dÃ¤r ner
I stÃ¥lets sjÃ¶, den allt nu ser

DÃ¥ den dÃ¶k, slukades av jordens andar
En gÃ¥va av stÃ¥l ur sjÃ¶n dÃ¥ steg

Ve draken, ormars orm
Ingen sett maken till gudars storm
Midvinterdraken

[English translation:]

[Mid-Winter Dragon]

A fire over winter's sky
Tail of the dragon a gloomy flame
That fell, burned
Crossed the northern skies
The wake of obliteration
Charred land
Where it rode
It burned the cattle, it burned the trees

Burnt cadavers and charred meat
The lands lay blackened
Smokey, dead
The areas of man
He spits his tar at
Fire, corrosive gall
Squirming in the pleasure of slaughtering
The night when the kingdom fell

O' dragon, serpent of serpents
Never has been seen such a godly storm
Mid-Winter Dragon

From the coldness of winter the dragon glided
It shall be remembered through family lines
It rose from the ground, had been buried there
In a lake of steel, that all see now

Then it rose, one swallowed by the spirits of the earth
A gift of steel from the lake climbed the sky

O' dragon, serpent of serpents
Never has been seen such a godly storm
Mid-Winter Dragon
