Det red en rÃ¶vare i snÃ¥rig skog
Han sÃ¥rad flydde, blÃ¶dande nog
Med knektar pÃ¥ jakt, hack i hÃ¤l
Ãver fornrÃ¶sÃ¥sen, den kÃ¤nde han vÃ¤l

DÃ¥ mÃ¶rkret tog en skepnad stor
De brakade i berget dÃ¤r jÃ¤ttar bor
Allting dÃ¥ skett enligt rÃ¶varens plan
Ãver Ã¥sen man rider bara om ban

JÃ¤tten bjÃ¶d, nÃ¤r han stigit ur sin kummel
PÃ¥ faslig dÃ¶d, de vÃ¤ckt ett forntidsvÃ¤sen
Marken lÃ¥g rÃ¶d, nÃ¤r gryningen nalkats
DÃ¤r mÃ¤nniskoson krossats av rÃ¶sets kung

DÃ¥ hÃ¶rde han skriken ur kneckters trut
PÃ¥ backen de mÃ¶tte ett lÃ¥ngsamt slut
Tjuven han rymde med blekvitt hÃ¥r
Men aldrig han mera till Ã¥sen gÃ¥r

I natten de mÃ¥ vandra som rÃ¶sens gastar
RÃ¶varens hingst nedfÃ¶r stigen hastar

JÃ¤tten bjÃ¶d, nÃ¤r han stigit ur sin kummel
PÃ¥ faslig dÃ¶d, de vÃ¤ckt ett forntidsvÃ¤sen
Marken lÃ¥g rÃ¶d, nÃ¤r gryningen nalkats
DÃ¤r mÃ¤nniskoson krossats av rÃ¶sets kung

Tjuven han rymde med blekvitt hÃ¥r
Men aldrig han mera till Ã¥sen gÃ¥r

[English translation:]

[King Of The Cairn]

A robber was riding in a scrubby forest
He fled wounded, bleeding surely
Pursued by rogues, cut in his heel
Across ancient cairns on the ridge, he knew the way well

Then the darkness took a large form
It crashed into the mountain where giants live
Everything went as the robber had planned
Across can only be ridden on the enbankmant

The giant commanded, as he arose from his cairn
A dreadful death, they had awakened an ancient being
The earth stood red as the dawn was approaching
Sons of men crushed by the king of the cairn

He heard a scream from the rogue's throat
On the hill they met a slow end
The thief ran away with snow-white hair
But never again he went to the ridge

In the night they will wander as the ghosts of the cairn
The robber's stallion hastes down the path

The giant commanded, as he arose from his cairn
A dreadful death, they had awakened an ancient being
The earth stood red as the dawn was approaching
Sons of men crushed by the king of the cairn

The thief ran away with snow-white hair
But never again he went to the ridge
