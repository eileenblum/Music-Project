MÃ¶rdaren han bodde i ett torp
Lynnet mÃ¶rk som fjÃ¤drar av korp
Butter och ensam med mord i sinnet
Ett dussin drÃ¥p, han njÃ¶t av minnet

Mord i minnet

Han vaktar, han spejar fÃ¶r sina lamm
Hatets ande i honom stigit fram
Vid vÃ¤gars kant, vid stigars fÃ¥ra
Fylld av slakten, tÃ¶rstig att sÃ¥ra

Under ovÃ¤der blott han slÃ¥ nu till
NÃ¤r allting Ã¤r stÃ¤ngt, han Ã¤ta vill
DÃ¥ fÃ¥ngar han mÃ¥ngens nÃ¤ra och kÃ¤ra
Deras kÃ¶tt till den mÃ¶rkes Ã¤ra, fÃ¶rtÃ¤ra!

Sina verktyg han putsat vÃ¤l
Med dessa han sticker ihjÃ¤l
Torka, vira, slita, riva
Han kan sin konst, han grina

Mord i minnet

Hans ben snart brinna i eldars hav
Hans straff, han veta, en hetaste grav
DÃ¤r han plÃ¥gas underjord
FÃ¶r sina dÃ¥d, fÃ¶r minnen av mord

[English translation:]

[Memories Of Murder]

The murderer, he lived in a croft
His mentality dark as feathers of a crow
Dour and alone with murder in his heart
A dozen slaughters, he enjoyed of the memory

Murder in mind

He guards, he spies on his lambs
The spirit of hatred grows in him
On the sides of roads, at the trenches of paths
Filled with massacre, thisrty to hurt

He strikes only during a storm
When everything is done, he will eat
There he catches the close and dear ones of many
Their flesh for the glory of the dark, devoured!

He cleaned his tools well
With them hangs them up
Dry, wind, tear, grate
He knows his tricks, he grins

Murder in mind

His leg shortly burns in the sea of flames
His penalty, he knows, the hottest tomb
There he is cursed under the ground
For his deeds, for memories of murder
