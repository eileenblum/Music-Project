[Music: Routa / Tundra / Trollhorn, Lyrics: Trollhorn]

Det var en vacker sommardag.
NÃ¤r man bedrev marknad.
Aamund och Kettil bestÃ¤mde sig
fÃ¶r att gÃ¥ och kolla ny kÃ¥por.

NÃ¤r de gick fÃ¶rbi skogen stor
hemska oljud hÃ¶rdes frÃ¥n busksnÃ¥r.
Trollen var ocksÃ¥ pÃ¥ vÃ¤g dit -
prÃ¤sternÃ¤ fick sig igen och fÃ¥glar sjÃ¶ng.

[English translation:]

Story Of The Market

It was a beautiful summer's day
When the Market was bustling
Aamund and Kettil decided
To go shop for new capes

When they passed the big forest
Horrible noises were heard from the brush
The trolls were also going to the market
And the priests were beaten and the birds sang
