Who are you?
Just try to answer this question,
before judging something or whoever.
Do you think I've never hit the ground?
Do you really think I need your opinion?
Your joyless life don't attracts me,
I will never be a programmed robot.

Come on, try to break the walls of my dreams.
You're stuck in a destructive scheme,
While I ride a butterfly of light across the countries.
You drive yourself to your bitter end,
While I drive to the core of History.
You'll never see what I see.

Stop trying to teach me Life,
When you haven't seemed to find yours,
We are just what we create.
We only live once,
So Just Define Your Priorities,
Define Your Priorities.

Oh please, look into the mirror,
We shared so much memories,
And all of this falls apart.

Oh don't worry, a stab in the back,
Is sweeter than what you've done.
You'll never feel what I feel.

We only Live Once.
