Why are you rising if it's for Collapse?
You may had think twice, before you rise up your fuckin' pride.
Symbol of Power or Giant target,
HyperPower is a double-edged knife.

Stars fall from the Spangled Banner.

Remember to watch your back.
You can't be NÂ°1, without making a few enemies.
Extermination for Peace, It's not an apology.
So watch your Stars falling from the Spangled Banner.

Elevate yourself to touch the sky,
Invade the World to show your idiocy.
Speak the words to make them believe:
Say all your prayers
Rise For A Better Collapse.

United Lies of America,
Self proclaimed King of Universe.
Conspiracy is a supremacy,
when responsibility is split.
War is a negligence,
To avenge your ignorant nation.

SAY YOUR PRAYERS

Elevate yourself to pierce the sky,
Invade the space to show your stupidity.
Cry the words to make them believe.
Say all your prayers
Rise For A Better Collapse.
