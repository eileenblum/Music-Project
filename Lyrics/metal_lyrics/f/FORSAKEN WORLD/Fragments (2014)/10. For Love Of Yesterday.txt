Existence is so fragile,
One single breath can destroy everything,
And I think we just took a too deep breath.
Nothing is eternal,
So how could we ever even think that our Earth was?
How can we believe that everything will be fine?

To see all these memories rot,
makes me fright to death
For the little time left.
We always thought that we had control,
but in reality we never ever thought,
that something could happen to us.

Watch,
The Flower that never grows.
The Sun that never shines.
The Bird that never sings.
The Wind that never blows.

Reality is so fictive.
The beauty of life made me realize how horrible is humanity.
I have the feeling that the supreme intelligence of my kind is Dying,
As if we regress while evolving.

What if tomorrow was just made of memories of Yesterday?
What if all was just a dream?

A Final tearing Tribute to,
everything that we broke under our delicate masquerade.

FOR LOVE OF YESTERDAY!
FOR PAST MISTAKES WE PAY.
FOR LOVE OF YESTERDAY!
FOR PAST MISTAKES WE PAY.
FOR LOVE OF YESTERDAY!
