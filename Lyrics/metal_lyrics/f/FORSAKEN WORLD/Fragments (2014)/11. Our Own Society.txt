Exhausted, we cannot walk anymore,
It seems that nothing is like before,
All the landscapes are uniform.
Every tree have the same dismal look
but the earth is still turning turning &amp; turning forever.
We will continue to watch this race,
which the number of laps remains unknown.

We are the last ones,
Condemned, we better try to get out,
Restart everything. In our misfortune,
We have this chance, we'll not let it go.
Universe have claimed his rights,
But not our minds.
Our Ideals as weapons,
We will shape our own fate,
in the ashes of our past.

We've walked a thousand miles,
Remembering what we were.
We're lost under this unlighted sun,
We understood the seed of our mistakes.
Let's repair all of our sins,
In Our Own Society.

Building something new,
to restore the remains of a Forgotten World,
coded as:
OOS 1.0
