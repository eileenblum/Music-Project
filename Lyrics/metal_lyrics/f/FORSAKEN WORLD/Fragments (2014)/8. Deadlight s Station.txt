The smoke of Life, turns
in the caves of my lungs.
Waiting on this dock of misery.
Wondering who's been here before me,
but maybe I don't care.

Maybe my train dropped me too late, or too early?
Lights are lighting bright,
as my memory slowly falls in a melancholic coma.
Peoples surround me, and it seems that no one cares
about what the world is destined to.

How things have come so bad?
When no one can tell what we really are.
Tonight my being will crash in the waves of unexplainable.

Like a puzzle, we try to solve the reasons of our existence.

But Life throws mine on the highway of disillusion.
Cement is blinding me in this city of disgust.
All of this empty faces, who were raised just to live
the life they choose for them.
What if no meteorite crashed on Earth 65 million years ago?
Do things would have turned like this?

I Always lived with an endless will to change it all,
to mark History with my dying hope.
But the more I walk,
the more human stupidity crushes my fate.

Tired of it all, I take my last journey,
The sun is awaiting me.

As I enter in my train, I take a look behind me...

I Will never Return.
