Hello,
I take you on a beautiful ride, Nowhere to hide
Your hands tied,
Let the knife gently slide into your velvet skin.
Don't cry little angel,
it's your destiny, my addiction.
Tear off your flesh, to tear out your heart.
Makes mine beat to death,
As it's shadow dancing around.

My desire growing inside, she's so pretty, emptiness in her gaze,
So I push, push, pushâ¦
The snake crawling in and out her delicious white corpse.
Seeds of life fulfill her eyes while I feel alive.
And then all stops, time floats in the air,
Silence cannot break the sweet sound of the red river,
flowing on the floor.

I take her on the last ride, Nowhere to be found,
And I dig, dig, digâ¦
To finally make her one with mother Earth,
As the soil covers her ivory carcass,
I cannot help to let a tear drop.
No one will never ever hear about her anymore,
She's now Eternal,

Game Over.
