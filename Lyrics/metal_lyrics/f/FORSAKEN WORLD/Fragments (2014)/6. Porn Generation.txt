Hey bitch,
show me your body from hair to toes,
It'll be forgotten in five minutes,
Play with my senses and give me your privacy.
Female body is used to sell any shit,
so don't fuck on us with your feminist bullshit.
Enjoy and cum in silence.

THIS is Our Porn Generation,
Nothing has changed since prehistory.
Breeding coded in our DNA,
Connected to the soul's pleasure.
Weakness of average people,
Profit of mighty advertiser.

Everywhere I watch,
I can stare at all these curves,
and false charming faces,
Male primary instinct at every corner.

There's nothing you can do,
Let it invades your TV,
newspapers, streets and even your computer.
You'll never stop, the unstoppable.

So take your best low-cost dress,
Get in your "fuck me" heels,
Make your fancy nail art,
and put on your whore makeup,
Cover you with the latest perfume,
Embody the media's feminine ideal,
Be ready to get on your knees.

Please
Don't be surprise of a teen,
fucking a forty-years-old.
It already reaches our child to the core.
