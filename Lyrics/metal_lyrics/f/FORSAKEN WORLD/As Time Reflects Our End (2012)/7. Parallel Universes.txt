Time is an entity so hard to understand,
The days pass and flow hour per hours.
What we do everyday dictates, what will happen tomorrow.
But things can turn out so differently,
Each little choices, each action, each step.

So many different lives that we can live,
But we'll ever know just only One.
I hope in Parallel Universes,
humans don't destroy the Earth.

Maybe in another Universe, I'm a good man.
Maybe you was never born.

So many different lives that we can live,
But we'll ever know just only One.
I hope in Parallel Universes, that you never knew Me.

Maybe in another Universe, I'm a Saint.
Maybe I'm already Dead.

I hope I died, so I can finally lay down in my dreams,
and never be frustrated anymore.
Peaceful and innocent,
Far from this blue land, I rewrites the History.

Time is an traitor entity,
The years pass and flow frustration by frustrations.
What we do everyday dictates what will happen in another Universe,
But you can never avoid the consequences.

So many different lives that we can live,
But we'll ever know just only One.
I hope in Parallel Universes, that I'm joyful.
