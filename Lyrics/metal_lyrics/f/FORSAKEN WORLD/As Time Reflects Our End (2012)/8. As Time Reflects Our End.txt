We have crossed all limit,
We have tried to understand.
Answers have already fell in the abyss of Our Stupidity.
This is not a desperate call to save the world,
It's just an affirmation, a taboo reality.

Cry or Scream, it's impossible to prevent natural disasters.
We're just a foreign body, Earth defends itself,
like your body with a virus.
(eating piece by piece your cells)

We have sell back Our Birthday Gift on Internet
We are the LD50 of the Earth
We are the St Anger throw out the Window
As Time Reflects Our End

We have killed our creator (not our creation)
We are the Blue Screen of Death of the Earth
We are the antifreeze of the Perfection Girl
As Time Reflects Our End

Mankind is a species like any other,
his legendary intellect is its greatest weakness.
Take a look through History: Just War, Murder and Lies.
is this a way to cherish our gift?
No you prefer think of your precious money or your satisfying comfort

We have sucked our resource for too long now
We are the cancer spreading over the pancreas
We are the bloop invading the space
As Time Reflects Our End

It's Over, I can hear the sound of the cracking earth's crust.
Our Misery Existence flashing before our eyes.
My soul cries the bullshit of the primates,
And the futility of our attempts to fix everything.
Time collapses on itself, and the debris reflect only the void.

it's time to pray, it's time to pay
it's time to say, it's time to yell:
As Time Reflects Our End
