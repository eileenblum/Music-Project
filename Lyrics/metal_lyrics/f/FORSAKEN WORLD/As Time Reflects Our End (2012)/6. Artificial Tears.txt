An empty face,
In the middle of the crowd,
I can't even express the desire to die,
A lifetime without joy, love, fear, anger or passion.
I would like just one day that a tear runs down my cheek.

Do you cry when somebody dies ?
Do you laughed when someone makes a joke ?
Do you love your family ?
Do you hate someone who hurts you ?

Are you afraid when you're alone ?
Are you in spite when someone deceived you ?
All those little things you don't even notice,
Are things that I would never know.

A Lifetime in front of empty thoughts,
Thinking of this or that, A pure and devoid vision of the world.
Every Heartbeat is a new step to deliverance.

Emotions are why we're human
So if I'm not human, what am I ?
Trapped in a body with no soul.
What is Existence if I can't Love.

Waiting a slow Death, who will comes without any Tears or Pain.
A reversed reality reflected in my eyes.
