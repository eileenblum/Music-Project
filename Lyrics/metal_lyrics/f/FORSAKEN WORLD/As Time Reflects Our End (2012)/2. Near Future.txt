The sky burns out in a single flame,
The seas cover the valleys in a single drop,
Deserts are freeze in a single snowflake,

You're stuck here, no escape, space is a dream,
watching the world's demise in your TV, superficial end.
Welcome in the Near Future,
every second is one more nail
in the coffin of humanity.

Are you too blind to see that the near future
knocks at your door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

Rain of Fire
Toxic snow, Piercing Wind
Deadly Tide
Sunlight goes Out
Out
Goodbye

Sunlight goes Out
Our Grace is Dead
