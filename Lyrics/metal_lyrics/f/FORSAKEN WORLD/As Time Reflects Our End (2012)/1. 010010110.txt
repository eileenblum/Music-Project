4 billions years for come to this,
From the water to the earth, from the fire to the air,
we walk on this borrowed land.
We have created some fantastic things, it's a great progress,
but a regression for what we had first.
Now computers dictates our lives.
Yesterday we made light without any fire, today we launch something in the space,
tomorrow we will teleport ourselves from a point to another?
Yesterday a Cold War (Thank You Petrov), today a revolution around the world,
tomorrow Nuclear Heads on sale in supermarkets?
All of this doesn't matter, because our countdown have begun since the first man put a foot on earth.
Someone says "Our History will be what we make of It"
So look at the History ... it tells everything
