It all begins with the global warming,
and your hypocrisy.
Corruption, Debts, Conspiracy.
Now peoples live in fear and doubt for the future,
it's time for Revolution.

We'll not let the Sun,
Burn your Skins.
We'll build walls,
Around your Faces.

We Forsake this World,
But you'll stay here,
Your shadows fades away,
Concrete will adhere to your tears,
Your lies have left a fear deep inside our Hearts.

This is what you get for have hiding the truth,
You're the worst face of humanity.
Fuckers, you've never wanted our welfare,
and left a big stab in our back.
Now this is your world, A Forsaken World.

The smallest action can lead to the greatest disaster.
Remember this, when you'll agonize in your pitch-black cell.

The smallest lie can lead to the greatest conspiracy.
Remember this, when you'll die in your pitch-black cell.
