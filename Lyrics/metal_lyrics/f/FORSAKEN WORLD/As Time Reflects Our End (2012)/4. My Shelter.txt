Since the beginning,
I saw my hopes fell into illusions,
And all your knives ready to pierce me.
Tied to a sinking ship, I forgot my humanity,
And walked alone without purpose.

All your negative acts put a fucking blackout in my existence.
And what's came out of this, is endless years of troubles.
Where I've met the Sun and danced with the Stars,
and made a dark galaxy my home.

I always tried so very hard, to be someone that I'm not,
but at the slightest scratch, I crawl back into My Shelter.

But I've fell in another feeling,
the most beautiful but the most destructive.
I discovered my true face, with bitterness as light.
My heart has been thrown into the lion's den,
Love is a game with no sense,
then, I'm always stand here,
and thinking "what's next?"

I shoring up My Shelter from years to years,
And bury the key in an ocean of poisoned thoughts.
I lock up inside all the rage,
Again and again your fucking words are bouncing
against the walls of My Shelter.
