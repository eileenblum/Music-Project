You brought me into this great unknown
A life of wonder with some room to grow
When you left, I faced this world alone
My cries for help met by a silent phone
I came, you went
What a fucking life well-spent
So go like before
It won't hurt me anymore

Don't call yourself a father because that's never what you've been
You're a lie, a fake, and a broken promise
The job of dad requires the responsibility of a man
And that's something you have none of
So don't call me when you need a hand
Because I'll remember when I didn't have one

[Chorus:]
Father, tell me where have you been?
Why did you throw me away? Father don't push me
Father don't push me away

When I am grown I know just what I'll do
I'll light the path and guide my childs' view
It's really not that hard, and not uncommon to
To be a man, to stick it through
To be a better fucking father than you

[Chorus]

Father I tell you, father I tell you...
Father I tell you

You're not my father, you never were
Blood only runs so deep
The death of you would be reality
'Cause in my mind you always were to me

[Chorus]
