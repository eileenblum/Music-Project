We all have times when we
Can't help but feel alone
Drowning in our sorrows
Caught in the undertow
Go, don't ever slow down
Go, and be reborn
Go, release your spirit
Free yourself and ride upon this storm

[Pre-chorus/chorus:]
It's never easy to let go
Of what you love
Even when the painful scars it's left behind
Are greater than all of the stars up above
So close your eyes tonight
And forget all the strife
Let your demons fade away
Time heals all so say
So long to yesterday
Some things are better left as memories

Stop feeling so lost
Find it in yourself to let it go
Don't dwell on insignificance
You get one life so make it one to show
Watch your problems crumble
Feel your worries fade
Just forgive and forget
Live life for today

[Pre-chorus/chorus]

Once you move on, don't ever look back
But let's raise a toast and a here's to the past

[Pre-chorus/chorus]
