Dear friends
Forgive me for what I'm about to do
It's for the best, so when it's over
Just remember
Just remember that I did it for you
I dug myself a hole and I just can't climb out
But given,
Given a gun and some time to myself
I know that I can relieve all this pain
I'll numb up my soul and quit being afraid
I'm falling
I'm falling off
I'm falling off so fucking hard

[Chorus:]
What a shame that it's come down to this
My world has grown dull and I can't find a fit
I've become a burden to myself and to you
It's gotten to the point where death is all I can choose

I've lost all hope in what lies ahead
I serve no purpose in the now
So what the fuck's the point of carrying on
When all I do is bring my loved ones down
Mom, I love you, this wasn't your fault
Sissy, I love you, shoot for the stars
Others, I love you, please stay strong
Friends, you are the reason that I made it this long

[Chorus]

I've given up on me
