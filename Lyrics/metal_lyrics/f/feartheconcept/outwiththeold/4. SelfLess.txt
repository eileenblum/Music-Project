Watch where you step
You never know who could be looking
Your life may mean nothing to you
But someone always sees
Someone always takes note
So live, just live
If not for yourself, then for those around you
Stray from the norm and brave this storm

Be someone's star
Be someone's savior
Be someone's light when they're stuck in the dark
You are the hero
You're the example
You are the one that the young will look up to
Hang on, hang on, hang on 'til the break of dawn
Hang on, hang on, we'll be home soon, it won't be long

What's it gonna take to make you realize this isn't about you
Taking the cowards way out is selfish
You may be someone's reason to live,
So not only are you giving up on yourself
But you're letting down the person you could've saved

You only get one life, and only one choice
You are only one person with only one voice,
But, if you can save just one soul
From being there, and that alone
It's your life, and your choice to make
Selfless or selfish, an oath to take

Remember, this life is a gift you've been given
No need for a thank you, just never forget it

Life's too short to play these fucking games

Selfless or selfish, an oath to take
Selfless or selfish, an oath to take
