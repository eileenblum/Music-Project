I have given up
On the faith I had in the ones around me
Did you hear me?
I have given up
On the hope that peace will ever come my way
Repeat what I say

I've turned the other cheek for the last time
You've bit the hand that feeds
All trust has been lost
I have felt this way too long

Done, I'm taking over the world
So get ready, 'cause it's about to go down
I said I'm done, I'm taking over the world
So get ready, 'cause it's about to go down

I've finally come to realize that nobody cares,
So I will take what I want and burn the rest to the ground
It's time to act on the fact that you can't hold me back
I'll leave my mark without ever even making a sound

I gave this world a chance, I really did
But now I've given up
I lost my motivation
So now I've decided to shake things up
To change my path of inspiration

Fuck them all
They never once gave a damn
Fuck them all
It was all a part of your master plan
Fuck them all

You always wanted me to conform
Well careful what you wish for
Cause now I'm as destructive as the rest of them
And if you think you're safe, think again
I'm coming for you
