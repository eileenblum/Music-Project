This time We'll fight back
This time We'll know
Implant hysteria
Who Really knows?

This time we'll kick back
This time we'll see
A bullent right
Between the eyes
Takes down the enemy

No use in hiding
No use to run
Finger on the switch
Blinded by the sun

Lock down
Shut down
Hang on
Condemned for life

No use in praying
No use to hope
The straps are tightening
Wrists burned with rope

Stand up and face it
Strand up and see
Carnaged bodies
Everywhere
No, just you and me

Lock down
Shut down
Hang on
Condemned for life

Cut the ropes
Break the line
Stand tall
Don't take the fall

Can't you see the daylight
From this cell
No more second chances
From this living hell
