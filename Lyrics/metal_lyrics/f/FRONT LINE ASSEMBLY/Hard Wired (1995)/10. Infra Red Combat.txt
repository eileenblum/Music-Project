A quiet moment
Fills the air
This tolldrum
Of our existence

The faith we lost
In time of fear
Mesmerized by
This resistance

No reason now
For Despair
This final message
Of persistence

We pray
We hold
Onto this dream
This evolution
Of persecution

The red in Their eyes
Constricts the flow
This frozen ground
Of true conviction

Shadows of men
Move through the earth
This human target
Of extinction

A final shot is
Solemnly heard
Who will get this
Final word

The earth covers
The shattered remains
Life and death
Are really the same

The pain you feel
Is not for real
The moments you spend
Wondering how it
Would end

In a time
In a place
In a State
Of honor and grace

In a breath
In a Death
In a sound
You'll be found
