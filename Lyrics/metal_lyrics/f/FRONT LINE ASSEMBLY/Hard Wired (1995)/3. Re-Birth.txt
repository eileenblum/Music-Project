A light
In the universe
Transmits
New Codes
Systematic predator
Now unfolds
Protectors
Of the universe
Eternalize by myth
New genetic mutations
Informs of monolith

Lifeless and fallen
Bodies lie still
Waiting for rebirth
To strike at will / to kill

Floating in a sea of bliss
Emerging mysteries
The epidemic copulates
Spreading the disease

Mechano-eroticism
Decadent Anarchy

The final solution is execution
Foreign intruder
A new persecutor

A vastness of scars
The earth
Illusions so decayed
So empty
And perverse
Not a sound is heard

Two ships collide in the night
Smoke fills the air
Lost in space
In a darkened void
No one seems to care
