Through waves
They shift
Below they hide
Corporate killers
Side by side

Process this signal
Final post
Global Defiance
No hope for most

Inform of liquid
Sliding through air
Tracking this existence
Killer hardware

As the sun burns out your eyes
A new world will now arise
Out of the ashes new life appears
A final conquest without any tears

Massive violence
The slaughter begins
Furture Collides
Nightmare begins

Lying faces
Bastards are cold
Self-annihilation
Growing old

This burning sensation
Won't last long
Eternal peace you must be strong
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
A metaphor will never trust
