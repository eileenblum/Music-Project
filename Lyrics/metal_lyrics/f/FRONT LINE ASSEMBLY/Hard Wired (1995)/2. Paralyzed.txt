Twisted Metal
Pierces your skin
Broken glass
Severs the limbs

Major impact
Smashes your head
Nightmare vision
In your Bed
Plasma surging
In your Veins
Mask the feeling
Crippling pain

Paralyzed
The moment is gone
Paralyzed
Now it won't be long

Pleasure or pain
Chain of desire
Pleasure or pain
We burn in the fire
Pleasure or pain
Final creation
Pleasure or pain
Final sedation

Burning sensation
Fills your face
Cosmetic disfigurement
Now takes place
