In silence they scream
How needless they suffer
Dying for the freedom
But someone has to pay

No one hears their agony
The torture and abuse
Simple human dignity
Is lost in the fuse

While the rest of the world
Smiles in all its horror
Crushing all of mankind
For profit, greed and glory

Will no one help those
Who believe in compassion?
This equality of life
Is just not a fashion

They hide in the shadows
The torture goes on
This permanent sadness
They have to be strong

They suffer in silence
The fighting goes on
This permanent sadness
They have to be strong

They won't be forgotten
One day they will rise
Eternal devotion
Their souls will fly high

This engraving cesspool
Which man has devoured
Is slowly getting to
The very last hour
In silence they scream
How needless they suffer
Dying for their freedom
Like Christ's last supper
