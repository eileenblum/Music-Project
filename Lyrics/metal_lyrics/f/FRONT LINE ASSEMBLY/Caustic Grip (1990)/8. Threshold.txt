Atmosphere is cold
Tension cuts like a knife
Hazed are the eyes
Reflecting shadows of the past

Nothing moves -
They all just stare.
Inner peace is gone
Tainted by time

Our great leaders
The leaders of man
They lied to us all
They tried to pretend.
They tightened the rope around your neck
Distorted all your views until the bitter end.

Carry the cross,
The cross of burden
Only memories remain
Looking for new life

The fear of the end
Lives in all of us
Heart and soul of man
Ravaged by greed

Heart and soul of man
Ravaged by greed
Denial and deception
Feed the sorrow

Divided as we fall
Break the solemn vow

Atmosphere is cold
Tension cuts like a knife
Hazed are the eyes
Reflecting shadows of the past
