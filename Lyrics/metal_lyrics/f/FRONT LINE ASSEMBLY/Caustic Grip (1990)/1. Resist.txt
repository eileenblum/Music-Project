"Kill for kicks"
"Bio-readouts are all in the green, looks like she's alive"

Resist, resist, resist...

"Killed your lovers"

Resist the command

Vicious warning
Deface - deface the ???

Fleeing from rejection,
You're fleeing from the lies
Nothing for the loser,
The hero always dies.

The look in your eye
The pressure, you kill with a knife
Toxins and games
You - you vow to win

Resist the command
Deface - deface the ???
And vow to win

"Kill for kicks"

Filth!

Excite! Excite!
What are we living for?
Excite! Excite!
We fade away

??
Menace of mine
We sellout
We fade away

"You're going down"

Escape from rejection,
Escape from the lies
Nothing for the loser,
The hero always dies.

The theme for protection,
Your scheme full of lies,
Nothing for the loser,
The hero always dies.

Resist the command!

"Killed your loved ones"

My ??? is burning
You want to die

"Bio-readouts are all in the green, looks like she's alive"

Resist the command!

??
The theme for your lies

"Kill for kicks"
"Bio-readouts are all in the green..."

Resist...
