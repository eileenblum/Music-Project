"We can't take prisoners - you know that."

Submissive ?? deviants
Rejecting all their casualties
Atrocities of mankind
Executed to extinction

If you analyze that ship of fools,
In the end you'll always lose
Your mental games are getting weak
They grow infected as you speak.

Burning skin that is not so real
Animate a conscious ideal
Dissolves into submission
Push the will of no recognition

Your face it cracks
You, you ?? on ??
The fossil shines
Shines right through
Take, take, take down the enemy.

If you analyze that ship of fools,
In the end you'll always lose
Your mental games are getting weak
They grow infected as you speak.

?? in the anarchy
You try to please the ??
Your shattered with self remorse
For better days or for worse.

"If he'd kept on beating on and holding
him down it'd be a different story"

Burning skin that is not so real
Animate a conscious ideal
Dissolves into submission
Push the will of no recognition

No recognition
Take down,
Take down the enemy.

Burning skin that is not so real
Animate a conscious ideal
Dissolves into submission
Push the will of no recognition
