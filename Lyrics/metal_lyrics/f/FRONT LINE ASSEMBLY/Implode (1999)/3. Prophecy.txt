Delusioned prayers fill the air
A hopeful soul is hard to see
Human cruelty frozen in time
A world so hard to feed

[Chorus:]
Nothing seems to matter
The rain begins to fall
Nothing to believe in
Even angels learn to fall

A trantic march into the sea
Being hunted to extinction
This human bond of frail mortality
A tarnished ground of true conviction
A teardrop falls behind closed walls
There's so much more of life to see
The closing of the door
The mind and so much more
A broken moment to believe

[Chorus x2]

Torment and anger
Runs through my veins
Leaving me cold inside
Surrender your feeling
Unfolding is the veil
Turning love to despair
This anger
A silent rage
This anger
A silent rate
