Only to see it's just a burn

[Pre-chorus 1:]
Spike the bass [x2]
In your face
Smell the dust [x2]
Grind the rust

[Pre-chorus 2:]
Mega dope
Mega beat

[Chorus:]
Mega dope
Mega beat
Mega fake
Mega cheap
Mega slave
Mega brave
Mega fine
Mega slime

Winding down that tarnished road
Truthful stories never told
The price they pay
The seconds of fame
This game we play
The ultimate way

[Pre-chorus 1]
[Pre-chorus 2]
[Chorus]

Broken promises
Fashionable hope
This big illusion
One big joke
Plastic people living the dream
Sell their soul to make the scene
