Nothing breaks
Winning is for those
Who take

[Chorus:]
Forever
Whenever
Tomorrow may never
Come
Forever
Whenever

Isn't life fun
Swimming in a world of creeps
A silhouette of the - Future looms
Distant dreams
Forbidden wounds
Creepy sound
In an eerie room
Burnt out light with elusive moons

[Chorus]

Now I lay my head
To sleep
Pray the Lord for
Me to keep
Distorted vision
Cloud my eyes
Even sleep can't
Hide the lies

[Chorus]
