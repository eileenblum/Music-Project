[Chorus]
City of mutants
Darker than night
Evil illusion
Guided by light
The friends you thought
They never were
Egos and icons
They just don't care
You hope to die quiet
Laying in bed
It's better than pointing
A gun to your head

[Chorus x2]

All cold and forgotten
You only feel pain
This quest for hope
Is a losing gain
Another dream crumbles
In front of your eyes
Your paranoid vision
Only sees spies

[Chorus]
