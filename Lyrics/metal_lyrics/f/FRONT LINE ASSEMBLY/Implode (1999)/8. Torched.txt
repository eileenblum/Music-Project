'Cause nothing will ever be the same
You burned it down
To the ground

[Chorus:]
But nothing has remained
The cause and effect
hat you reject
It all burns just thesame

Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire

[Chorus]

Lurking shadows
Become dissolved
Pyro fixation
Burns them all
Singeing hair
Smells like you care
Be glad that
You're not there
You strike a match
Close the hatch
You're totally insane
Another burn
Starts the yearn
Feelings always the same
You like it hot
And watch it rot
You love to play
The game

[Chorus]

Smoke is deep
Life is cheap
Smoke is deep
Life is cheap
