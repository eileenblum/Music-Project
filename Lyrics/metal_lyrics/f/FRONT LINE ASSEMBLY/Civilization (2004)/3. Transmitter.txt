A jaded generation
Dissolves the unknown
Neurotic deprivation
No one left to own
Sinking endlessly
Into infancy

Lets come together

Narcotic imbalance
The energy is strong
Resilient and defiant
This claustrophobic song
So cold is the water
Crouched into a ball
Like fragments of illusion
We all start to fall

Lets all come together
Lets all join hands
Lets all march together
Lets do the war dance

The universe
The stars
The planets
...
Civilization

Lets all come together
Lets all join hands
Lets all march together
Lets do the war dance

Let's come together
