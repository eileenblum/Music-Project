Psychosomatic
You're so dramatic
You seem to hang on every word I say
Psychosomatical
You're so fanatical
You crowd my life
And you won't go away

You breathe my air
You take my space
You make me hate
The human race

Can't fight the feeling
My mind is reeling
Eternal hate
That won't go away
A bitter ending
To no avail
Cheap exploitation
Is here to stay

Psychosomatical
You're so fanatical
You crowd my life
And you won't go away

In a world where no one wins
A chemical playground
Of lust and sin
Swallow the pill
Believe the lie
Unknown pleasures
We live to die

Psychosomatic
Learn to survive
