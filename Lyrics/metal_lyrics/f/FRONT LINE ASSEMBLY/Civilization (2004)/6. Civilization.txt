We fight we rule
The will to conquer
Symbols of oppression
Make borders obsolete

Eradicate exterminate
All species from the earth
In the name of progress
We call peace

These islands collapsing-
We burn, we rape, obliterate
Our conscience heavy
We take and take
These islands collapsing-
No turning back
The damage is done
You can't change life
Nowhere to run

... greed ... hate ... corruption ... bastards

These islands collapsing-
We burn, we rape, obliterate
Our conscience heavy
We take and take
These islands collapsing-
No turning back
The damage is done
You can't change life
Nowhere to run

"It's a transition, it's like having a passport to another life and for us to get into the afterlife"
