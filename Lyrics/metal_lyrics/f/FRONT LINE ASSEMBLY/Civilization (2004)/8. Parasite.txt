No matter what they say or do
The shit they write well it ain't true
Coloured eyes hypnotize
Go and sell some other lies
The losers and the hangers on
Want one thing and then they're gone
Smile at you
Shake your hand
Steal you money
Destroy your band

Work it out
Why don't you kill yourself
Work it out
Can't trust nobody else
Work it out
This evil never dies
Work it out
You're better than the rest

Trivialize the human condition
Loneliness is just a premonition
Visualize this weakened link
None of these losers ever think

Take them
Take them down hard
Show them no mercy
Oh yeah this life is hard

Work it out
Why don't you kill yourself
Work it out
Can't trust nobody else
Work it out
This evil never dies
Work it out
You're better than the rest

Work it out

Work it out
Why don't you kill yourself
Work it out
Can't trust nobody else
Work it out
This evil never dies
Work it out
You're better than the rest
