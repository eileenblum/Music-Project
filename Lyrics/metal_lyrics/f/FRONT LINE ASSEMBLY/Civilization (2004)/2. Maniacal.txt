We're gonna drop this song
Cause you don't belong
You don't fit the mold
So you've been told
You need to play our game
And just act the same
Cause we won't tolerate
Any other trait

Bang! I am maniacal
Bang! so defiable
Obliverate dominate
Self destruct and activate
Bang! I am political
Bang! so inequitable
The name of the game is to win all the way

Pinned down
To your chemical cross
Of hopeless faith
What a day what a loss
No one left
To tell this tale
Of all of us
Life for sale

The clouds start to rise
There is no surprise
We all start to burn
When will we learn
Who we are to be
Watch the enemy
In you sights you see
When will we be

Bang! I am maniacal
Bang! So defiable
Obliverate dominate selfdestruct and activate
Bang! I am political
Bang! So inequitable
The name of the game is to win all the way

Pinned down
To your chemical cross
Of hopeless faith
What a day what a loss
No one left
To tell this tale
Of all of us
Life for sale

No one left
To tell this tale
Of all of us
Life for sale

Bang! I am maniacal
Bang! So defiable
Obliverate dominate self destruct and activate
Bang! I am political
Bang! So inequitable
The name of the game is to win all the way

Pinned down
To your chemical cross
Of hopeless faith
What a day what a loss
No one left
To tell this tale
Of all of us
Life for sale
