Pushed to the edge
We drive, we drive a wedge
Of hate and fear
Don't shed a tear

No one to trust
This life, this life's a bust
This hand of greed
We need to feed

Can't stop the bleeding
These wounds aren't healing
Who wants to live
For another day
Skies are greying
Who is praying

Paralysis of self injection
Mortal coil
No protection
Disagree
Spinless sea
Hypocrisy
Will set you free
In the end
We all bend
No more time
To change your mind
Two by two
We'll march through
End the end
You'll die too

Can't stop the bleeding
These wounds aren't healing
Who wants to live
For another day
Skies are greying
Who is praying
