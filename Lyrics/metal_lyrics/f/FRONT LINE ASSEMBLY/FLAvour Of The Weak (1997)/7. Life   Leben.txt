Air is still
Chaotic thrill
Burns his will
Another kill

No control
Determined foe
Blackened hole
Stories told

Burning sun
He's having fun
Darkened mole
Desperate soul

Thrill-a
He's a chill-er
No creator
Manipulator
Degenerator
A people hater

Psychotic burnout
Douse the flame out
This persecutor
Weird intruder

Forgone conclusion
Sever illusion
Disturbed emotion
Greased with lotion

One to another
We are bought and sold
One to another
You lose control
