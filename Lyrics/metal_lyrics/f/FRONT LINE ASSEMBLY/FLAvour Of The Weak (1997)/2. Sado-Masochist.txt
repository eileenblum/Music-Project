Keeping your mind strong
Turn the bass on

Feed the fire
Let's get higher

Gotta get this
Thing down
Gotta get my lord up

Show no emotion
Drown in the ocean
Put a gun to your head
You took a hit
And rocked your head
And now you're dead

Anyhow
Anywhere
Anytime you lose it

Anytime anywhere you will lose it

Anyhow
Anywhere
Anyplace
Anytime
