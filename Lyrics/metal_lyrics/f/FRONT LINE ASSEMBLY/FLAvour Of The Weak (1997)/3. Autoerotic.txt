Understand with reason
Cause their ain't no way of pleasin'
Cause the thing that's in effect
Turns out to be respect

Also week in their minds
Also fake
Lies and lust and hate
In the end it's too late

All the tears that were wept
All the friendships that were swept
Was it worth it, was it swell
Only time and death will tell

After all is said and done
And we reached the final sum
Take your heart in your hand
And alone you will stand

Gotta get up
Gotta get down
Gotta put the fear
In the ground
