A fire burns
In your eye
You gasp, you suck
The line of life

Relentless
Relentless confusion
Day
Day after day

In the shadow
An angel cries
Hearts and minds
Torn by lies
Tormented conscience
Buried by weight
Innocence confused
By hate

Walking
Walking in silence

A ceremony
Of false ideals
The anguish and deceit

Hard reality
Begins to set in
A hostile state

"..inflicted heavy losses"
"There were no survivors"

A steadfast dream
Creates blindness
The wound inside
Runs deep

"There were no survivors"
