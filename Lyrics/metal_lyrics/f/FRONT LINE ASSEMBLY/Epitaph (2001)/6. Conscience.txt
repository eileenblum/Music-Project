Deep inside
My forgotten world
This restless soul
Washed away

Anticipate
For better days
A hopeless world
Slipping away

Blurs of serenity
Hate forever burns
Crucified from above
Despite it all we never learn

So fragile, so faint
So damaged, yet so stained

Underneath it all hurts
Despite the calm
It all went wrong

Disappear in an empty hole
A darkened void to fill a space

A raging storm
Churns below
Final moments
To erase
