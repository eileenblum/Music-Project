Breaking all those rules
You made for me
Running through all these mind fields
Set for me
Burning in the fire
You fueled for me
Laughing at all the anger
You've thrown my way

I know what's real
I want to feel
The full effect
These open wounds
Will never heal
There's no respect

The anger will fuel the fire
The flames get higher
Backlash

Breaking all these rules
You made for me
Running through all these mind fields
Set for me
Burning in the fire
You fueled for me
Laughing at all the anger
You've thrown my way

I know what's real
I want to feel
The full effect
These open wounds
Will never heal
There's no respect

The anger will fuel the fire
The anger
The flames get higher
