The filth, the greed, immoral needs
The shameless urge of consumption
A lustful motive against a fool
One's will by force to be ruled

Vengeance is mine now

Impulse to destroy
This anti matter
Contaminated with promise of belief

This catalyst
A tour de force
A smut peddler with no redemption
Immortal and unclean
Infected and obscene
Ill-defined objection

Swimming in a world of creeps
