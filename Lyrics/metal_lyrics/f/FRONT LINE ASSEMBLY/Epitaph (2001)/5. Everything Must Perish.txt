Through the smoke i see the trees
No one left for us to please
A perfect world where no one dies
Go to heaven with you lies

Wasted and confused
I walk around with a shortened fuse
A fire burns inside my head
Is this living or am i dead?
In my dreams i see the end
A perfect circle never bends
As time and hope erode our fears
I close my eyes for one last tear

Tomorrow may never come
Mountains clash in the sun
The freezing snow starts to melt
A quiet moment to myself
Reflecting somewhere in the past
I hope this feeling will always last
A paradise we stand alone
Forgotten king without a throne
A bird takes flight
Now out of sight
The sun catches its shadow

Above the air there is no despair
We are waiting for the moment

A darkened shadow hides my face
I hope i won't forget this place

This burning sky that we call home
In the end we stand alone
Come alive
Come alive
Breath
