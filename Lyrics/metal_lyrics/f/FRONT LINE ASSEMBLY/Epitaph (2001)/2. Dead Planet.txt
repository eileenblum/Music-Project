I haven't slept in four days
Something here just doesn't feel right
This eerie place keeps me up all nights
So tired now i'm losing my sight

A yellow sky
Turning blue
Dead planet

I look around and see no end
Signs of extinction appear everywhere
This place called earth
Is just a burning shell
An inner outer living hell

We have come so far
Just to lose it all
This winding road
We call life
So civilized within our frame of mind
Never having learned
To be kind

What is up with this hole i'm in
No one here can hear me tell
What is up with this place
Someone get me out of this scene
