Unearth the vile of anger
Inside surveillance begins
Abide the urge you want
To breathe from within
Exhume the will of saint
You cannot ever prevail

We pass away but want to stay
To be born again
(On this remembrance day)

Absolved from the lesson
We watch the living fall

Existence finds no shelter
Embodied from resolve
The army that you needed
To lead a certain way
Now, don't look behind you
Cause nothing's here to stay

Out cast from the shadows
Drawn within yourself
Where no one else can find you
Lost within yourself
And as your breath slips away
I have to say
Could it ever have been right
Banished to extinction
A prayer for us all

Transparent and demented
Waiting for night to call

Unearth the vile of anger
Inside surveillance begins
Abide the urge you want
To breathe from within
