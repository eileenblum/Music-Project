Enter this corridor of light
Envision the loss of your sight
Daydream when it all seems right
Hallucinate division of the perilous flight

Break, break, break it down
Push up, push up the tempo

Incarnate the shadow of your soul
Incision a spiritless life to hold
Pacify a tranquil state of need
Compromise fulfill this righteous seed
Impassive within our selves to lead
Suspicious contentious life of wealth and greed

Close your eyes
And you will see
This target
This emotion
This conspiracy

Travel though the stars
Universe so large
No answer here
Just fear
And buried dreams
