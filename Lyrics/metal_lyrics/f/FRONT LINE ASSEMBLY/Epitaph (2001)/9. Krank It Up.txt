The silence of your voice in me
Immortal severance
To be free
Cold skin breaking
Question burn
Are you falling
Will you ever learn

The flood begins
No one wins
You feel like drowning
In a sea of bliss
A fleeting moment
You chance is gone
Self-manifestation
Right from wrong

Find the target
Who's to blame
Pull the trigger
Then take aim
Psychotic warfare it's all in vein
The price you pay
For glory and fame

There's murder in your eyes
No one gets out alive
Somewhere a human cries
No one gets out alive

Casting shadows
Of our selves
Your body is trembling
Within itself
Stabbing statements
Feel the pain
Find the gun
Then take aim
(Who's to blame?)
