Protection from the cold
Isolation within to hold
Reflections of a long lost day
This universe a state of grace

When you rise
Above the clouds
When you see
A light of eternity

Remembrance not so kind
This storm leaves you blind

Answer you will never find
A dream you will never see
A hand for you to hold
A life forever grows old

The mirror of truth and time
Sadness when we fall
Wisdom you learn through time
Honesty within us all

When you rise
Above the clouds
When you see
A light of eternity

Remembrance not so kind
This storm leaves you blind
