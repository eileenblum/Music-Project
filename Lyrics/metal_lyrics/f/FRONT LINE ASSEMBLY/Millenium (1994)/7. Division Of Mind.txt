In Through The Out Door
Out to The West
This Fascist Nation
Never Rest

Fight Back [4X]

Rulers of Hatred
We Execute Pain
Not With Our Hands
But Others We Pay

Fight Back [4X]

No Mutual Surrender
Scent of Chud
With Infinite Spirit
We Never Give Up

Fight Back [4X]

[Chorus:]
The Alter of Truth Is for The Living
The Alter of Truth Is Unforgiving

A Network of Druglords
Rule This Land
This Democracy Will
Never Stand

Fight Back [4X]

[Chorus]

Division of Mind Is Strangulation
Division of Mind is Suffocation

The Tandem Mirror
Shatters in Two
Chaotic People
Invalidate You

Fight Back [4X]

Reprogrammed Vision
Dimension of Fright
Hollow Delusion
We All Lose Sight

Fight Back [4X]

Syringed Injection
Into Your Arm
Final Solution
Now Will Come

Fight Back [4X]

[Chorus]
