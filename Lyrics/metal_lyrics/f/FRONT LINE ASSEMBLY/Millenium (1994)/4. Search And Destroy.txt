A Mission from Hell Was Sent out Today
To Search and Destroy, and Blow Them All Away

Forbidding Is The Planet
No One Will Return
Their Lives Are Expendable
Through the Battle Turn

A Victory Must Be Won
All Is at Stake
As The Planet Burns There Is No Escape

[Chorus:]
As The Clouds Broke Through
The Blazing Sky, Up Above
The Aura of THe Moment
Invasion from Above

The Conflict Still Lay Up Ahead
Where Cowards Fear to Tread

Shocking Was The Value
Abandoned by Aversion
Deployed Were The Robots
Creating A Man Machine

[Chorus]
