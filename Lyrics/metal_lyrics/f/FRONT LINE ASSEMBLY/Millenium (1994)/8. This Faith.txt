Faces of a Thousand People

The Sickness in Their Mind Is Real

We Fight and Struggle to Survive

This Cultured Way of Suicide

This Faith Is Real
the Betrayal

[chorus]
As We Fall From The Sky
Our Lives Pass By
Emerging from This Vision
Life Is Stranger than Death

Abusive Statements form The Ranks

Intimidation Has Its Way.  The Sun Comes Up
Another Day
.....Just to Fade Away Again

The Strategies of Men Appear
.....World Destruction Now Is Here

This Faith Is Real the Betrayal

[Chorus Repeat]

Decades Gone By
.....Nothing Changed

Mankind Cruelty is Still The Same

Seeking Shelter From This Day

Tomorrow Victims Are Here to Stay

Another Lonely Night Appears

You Close Your Eyes with Hardened Tears

This Faith Is Real
The Betrayal

[Chorus Repeat]
Thw World As We Know Destroyed
