Voices I Hear
Impact Is Near
Switches Are On
It Won't Be Long

Distinguish The Sound
You Must Be Strong
Software Collides
On Both Sides

[Chorus]
Run For Your Lives
If You Want to Live
The Situation Is Imperative
As Cold As A Corpse
You Try to Hang On
Your Heart and Devotion
Will Soon Be Gone

Communicate Now
The Knowledge Is Here
No Limitations
New Generation

Attack Slow Rate
One by One
Designed to Destroy
All in One

Control The Machine
Break The Seam
Brainchild of Ours
Devoured by Hours

Now You're Strapped In
It's Your Turn to Win
Skin Stretches Thin
When You Begin

Seconds Go By
Now You Will Die

Machine Is Turned On

You Must Be Strong

Voices I Hear
Impact Is Near
Switches Are On It Won't Be Long

[Chorus X 2]

Distinguish The Sound
You Must Be Strong
Software Collides
On Both Sides

Communicate Now
Knowledge Is Here
Exterminate Fear
Within This Sphere

One by One We Will See New Horizons
To Set Them Free
Break The Seam
In The Stream
Brainchild of Ours
Devoured by Hours
