The sun goes down on a cloud collapsing in the air
There's no reprieve as they deceive
Shadows fall so be aware
As the night time descends on the earth
The darkest hour appears

Cameras turned on we're watching you
Surveillance creates a new point of view

A flash point shimmers in the air
Defiance resounds through the ground
Resistance from humanity
New hope can be found
Defying moments of serenity
We all live in fear
A wave of endless complacency as time draws near

Segregated lights of foreign eyes protrude though the walls
They wait, they listen for every sound
They all can be found
A symphony of paranoia reveals all flaws

Cameras turned on we're watching you
Surveillance creates a new point of view

A flash point shimmers in the air
Defiance resounds through the ground
Resistance from humanity
New hope can be found
Defying moments of serenity
We all live in fear
A wave of endless complacency as time draws near

Hiding in the moments
They are watching you
Darkened by the moments
It appears they wait for you.

The sun goes down on a cloud collapsing in the air
There's no reprieve as they deceive
Shadows fall so be aware

A flash point shimmers in the air
Defiance resounds through the ground
Resistance from humanity
New hope can be found
Defying moments of serenity
We all live in fear
A wave of endless complacency as time draws near

A flash point shimmers in the air
Defiance resounds through the ground
Resistance from humanity
New hope can be found
