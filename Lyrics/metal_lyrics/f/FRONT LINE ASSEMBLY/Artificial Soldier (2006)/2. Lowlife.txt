Hollywood is burning
Everything's turning red
Rich People squirming pumping out the lead
Seeing is believing everything is free
Endless lights of glory drowning in the sea

[Pre-chorus:]
Strange different faces tell different lies
Conquest of creation it only lasts a while

[Chorus:]
Lowlife
Let's get high
Lowlife
Let's Fly

City of the angels
Lifestyles of the dead
Plastic recreation degenerates your head
Morbid transformation
Hard to tell what's real?
Stem cell masturbation
Faces made of steel

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Lowlife
Let's get high
Lowlife
Let's Fly

Time to die
