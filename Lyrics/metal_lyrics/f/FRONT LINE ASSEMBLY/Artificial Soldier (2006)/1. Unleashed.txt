World domination new point of view
Hostile separation so what else is new?
Angry people everywhere fighting to be heard
Caustic fornication crippled rotting world.

High above the ground
You get a different point of view
Watching all the people succumb to a few
Fear and contamination rule with supremacy
Severed degradation feels so obscene

To Hell with humanity
The more I see the less I believe
Inundated with this hate I feel
Echoing sounds of despondency

Crashing the system
Programmed to receive
Mindless human idiots
Fall to their knees

World domination
Crashing the system
Crashing the system
