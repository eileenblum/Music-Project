Living giving
What can there be?
Give my life back to me
Defiance reliance
The third degree
Your world means nothing to me

Disconnect me from the living
Give my brain back to me
Disconnect my misgivings
There's no reason to believe
Anarchy for the masses
Crippling sense of urgency

Living giving
What can there be?
Give my life back to me

Slash my wrists with your malice
Let my blood run through your veins
Let there be no more illusions
Don't hold back bring on the pain

Disconnect me from your system
Let me be who I want to be
Give me back my inhibitions
Let me have me eyes to see
Give me back my chemical balance
Control my fear is the key
Let there be no separation
Let my body parts be

Living giving
What can there be?
Give my life back to me
Defiance reliance
The third degree
Your world means nothing to me

Disconnect me from the living
Give my brain back to me
Disconnect my misgivings
There's no reason to believe
