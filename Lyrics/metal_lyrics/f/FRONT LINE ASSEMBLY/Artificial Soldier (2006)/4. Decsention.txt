[Feat. Jared Slingerland]

Let my DNA run through your mind
Let my DNA destroy all mankind

Massive complications
Twisted degeneration
Desperate salvation
Massive complications

Give me shelter from above
Send two angels and a dove
As we hang on to despair
Tears of blood run from your eyes
As we cannot hide the lies
Breathing in this toxic air

Feel the anger in my eyes
Feel the sorrow from all your lies
Feel the anguish in my brain
Chemical mind fuck
This life in disdain

Massive complications
Twisted degeneration
Desperate salvation
Massive complications

Give me shelter from the pain
as this hate drives me insane
Seeking refuge from the rain
All in all we do believe as we try to conceive
In this glowing afterlife
Give me shelter from above
Send two angels and a dove
As we hang on to despair
Tears of blood run from your eyes
As we cannot hide the lies
Breathing in this toxic air

Massive complications
Twisted degeneration
Desperate salvation
Massive complications
