Today is the day when I hate everything
No foolish devotion and the pain that it brings
Today is the day when I am sick of it all
Broken and bruised
Decayed to the core

Underneath we stand too tall
But above we rise and fall
To our final destiny
May our hearts and our minds be free.

I tried to believe and be just like you
But lost all my faith
and now despise all of you
The farther I fall the less I can see
The wounds you created
and inflicted on me

Underneath we stand too tall
But above we rise and fall
To our final destiny
May our hearts and our minds be free.
After all comes tragedy
Forgotten lives no eyes to see

I tried to save a small part of me
But the layers of hate dismembered me
My damaged skin is wearing thin.

Underneath we stand too tall
But above we rise and fall
To our final destiny
May our hearts and our minds be free.
After all comes tragedy
Forgotten lives no eyes to see
So afraid to speak our minds
As we crawl through these times
