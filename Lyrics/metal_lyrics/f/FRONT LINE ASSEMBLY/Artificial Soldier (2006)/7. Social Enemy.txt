Join in the masses believe in what you think
This human generation creates the weakest link
No more point in trying when the end result is dying
Blow your load or self explode
I am bored with this living

As I corrode, As I implode

All alone (He's so desperate)
So disturbed
He's so borderline
So alone (So forgotten)
In this atrium of lies

Bizarre contamination
Bizarre annihilation
Suicide

In the wake of devastation
My brain defies isolation
In the face of adversity
Anti climatic hypocrisy
Lurid pacification
Rulers of this nation
A fourth world destination
Self immoral annihilation

As I corrode, As I implode

All alone (He's so desperate)
So disturbed
He's so borderline
So alone (So forgotten)
In this atrium of lies
