"They'll be bloodshed!"
"You're a cop"

Drop the bomb
The light burns bright
Set it on the ground
On the?
No more questions,
No more lies.
Something is happening,
Its on my face.

"They'll be bloodshed!"

???hesitate
Trembling hopes
???the things
Noone wins
Tell us what to do
Hold still
Dance through the light
Do what you will
Penetrate,
One more shot,
Noone left to kill.
In my head.

Tell us what to do
Hold still.
Face the light?
Nowhere left to live
Penetrate
One more shot
Noone left to kill
