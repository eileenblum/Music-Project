Big money, Big guns

"Yet (as) the threat of war is ever more remote"
"What is the moral challenge of our day?"

Corrupted - corrupt politicians
Who'll say anything
On their, on their way to the top
They'll stop - stop at nothing

Under the flag
The statue stands
Saluting in the air
Phones are tapped
The wires are out
Spies are everywhere.

Facing - to face no morals
Living - living in the past
Fool your minds with power

It's so sensuous
No more - no more words
No no no no more lies
I hide a certain kind of pride.
Jagged, jagged, jagged glass

A conspiracy appears on the floor,
The bell starts to ring.
Big Money, Big Guns,
Sexy, lovely thing.

"Yet the threat of war is ever more remote"

A conspiracy begins on the floor
The bell it starts to ring.
Big Money, Big Guns,
Sexy, lovely thing.
Everything you see.

Spies are everywhere.

"Yet the threat of war is ever more remote"
