The time has come to make a stand
No compromise in sight.
No more words it's time to act
The battle has begun.
The battle has begun.

I can't hold back the rage no more
My brain is on fire
No more words and no more lies
Take what you desire.
Take what you desire.

For long enough you've cheated yourself
And now it's time to act.
More power to society will only drag you down.
Just stand up for yourself
With both feet on the ground

Believe in what you try to do.
Don't let them bring you down,
More power to society will only drag you down
