Inside illusions
A breath of air
A shadow falls
But noone is there
A great big sound
No word is spoken
Discount contempt
Until the end

Until the end

Reflecting glimpses
The tension's there
Unspoken words
They fill the air
Subliminal flashes
Advanced warnings
They need time to reflect
False information

The conspiracy lingers
No death threat is there
Denial retractions
But who really cares
Subliminal flashes
Advance warnings
They need time to reflect
False information
Disinformation
A state of siege
The final turmoil
Aquiescence
Address the nation
With a platform of lies
Address the nation
