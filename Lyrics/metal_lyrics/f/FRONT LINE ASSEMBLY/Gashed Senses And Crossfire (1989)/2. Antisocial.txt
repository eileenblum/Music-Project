Get up, do what you want
Before, before its too late
Don't, don't worry yourself
Of others I don't think

Kick down the door
To hell for more
Severe injections - a lethal dose
Kick down the door
To hell with poverty
Clench your fist and shout at them all

Its just a lost cause
Clenched, clenched fisted shout
We're souls, souls in ignorance

Break, break all the windows
Shout deliverance
Break all the doors
innocent victim
Do what you want

Clench your fists!
