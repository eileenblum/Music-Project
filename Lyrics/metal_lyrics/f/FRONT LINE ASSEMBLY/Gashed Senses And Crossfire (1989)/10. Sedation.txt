Sweet, sweet sensation,
Across my back.
I will be following you,
No retreat
Turning back now.

At night time
Just to cross the trails
Flood control.
On that wall
Sealed between cracks.

Hide, hide the violence
He returns the gun
Retreat within yourself.
Retreat within yourself.
Switch the station
Across my back
???
And we turn them back

He is coming back
Hiding with no one else.
No chance to acquire
Retreat within yourself.
