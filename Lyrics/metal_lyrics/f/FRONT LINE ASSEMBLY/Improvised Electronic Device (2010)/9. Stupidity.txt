[feat. Al Jourgensen]Why the fuck you even think I care
I hope you all go away and die
The whole world needs to start all over
But that'll happen when pigs will fly

I'll kill all you motherfuckers

[Chorus:]
Stupidity
That's all I ever see
Stupidity
It's moral poverty

What the fuck is really going on
There's no governments just corporate greed
Everybody wants a bigger bomb
Lets blow 'em up
And start a new breed

I'll kill all you motherfuckers

[Chorus:]
Stupidity
That's all I ever see
Stupidity
It's moral poverty

I just look around at all these dumb motherfuckers
And all I want to do is go to a shopping mall and open fire
'Cuz that's what is required
That's what is required

[Chorus:]
Stupidity
That's all I ever see
Stupidity
It's moral poverty

Stupidity
We call it society
Stupidity
Go fuck yourself
