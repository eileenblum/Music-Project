No color on this face of death
No shadow falls on his last breath
What are we fighting for?

No more devotion in his eyes
No longing moments no more goodbyes 
What are we fighting for?

Too many lives in one place
Too many souls lay here to waste
What are we fighting for?

Send a signal from above
Is there life?
Is there love?
What do you see?

Is there hope?
Is there air?
No more despair
When will we be free?

The man I lived for all this life
Now dies in front of my own eyes
What are we fighting for?

The memories of a crippled fool
No legacy, but lifeâs so cruel
What are we fighting for?

Too many lives in one place
Too many souls lay here to waste
What are we fighting for?

Send a signal from above
Is there life?
Is there love?
What do you see?

Is there hope?
Is there air?
No more despair?
When will we be free?

Once I had this final plan
Now I donât know where I stand
What will be
Will be?

Drawn to this final line
As the blood runs through my mind
So much more to see

The memories all fade away
Of an afterlife...
