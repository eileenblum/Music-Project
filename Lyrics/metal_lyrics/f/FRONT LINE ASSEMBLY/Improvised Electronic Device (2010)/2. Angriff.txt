Rows and rows of crosses
standing in the sand
statues of the fallen
watching over this land
The tombs of unknown soldiers
lay tilted in decay
another year passes
on this remembrance day.

There's a hole in the sky
I've got blood running in my eye
I'm exposed to forged attrition
A battle cry for remission
The smoke filled air burns my hair
Filled with toxic nerve despair
There no way to get back
Another order to attack.

Kampfbereit in der Zeit [ready for combat in time]
Kammeraden dÃ¼rfen wir nicht vergessen [we must not forget our comrades]
Die Blumen liegen auf seinem KÃ¶rper [the flowers are laying on his body]
Das Requiem fÃ¼r den Letzten [a requiem for the last one]

Rows and rows of crosses
standing in the sand
statues of the fallen
watching over this land
The tombs of unknown soldiers
lay tilted in decay
another year passes
on this remembrance day.

The unforgiven run at night
aiming with their riffle sites

they give there all when there called
to save the masses and take the fall
it's sad but true, it never ends

the constant conflict without a mends
the final struggle from within
will end up with out misery

Kampfbereit in der Zeit [ready for combat in time]
Kammeraden dÃ¼rfen wir nicht vergessen [we must not forget our comrades]
Die Blumen liegen auf seinem KÃ¶rper [the flowers are laying on his body]
Das Requiem fÃ¼r den Letzten [a requiem for the last one]

The good, the bad, it's all sad
Nothing left but a body bag

There's a hole in the sky
I've got blood running in my eye

Kampfbereit in der Zeit [ready for combat in time]
Kammeraden dÃ¼rfen wir nicht vergessen [we must not forget our comrades]
Die Blumen liegen auf seinem KÃ¶rper [the flowers are laying on his body]
Das Requiem fÃ¼r den Letzten [a requiem for the last one]

Kampfbereit in der Zeit [ready for combat in time]

Die Blumen liegen auf seinem KÃ¶rper [the flowers are laying on his body]
Das Requiem fÃ¼r den Letzten [a requiem for the last one]

Kampfbereit [ready for combat]
Kampfbereit [ready for combat]
Kampfbereit [ready for combat]
