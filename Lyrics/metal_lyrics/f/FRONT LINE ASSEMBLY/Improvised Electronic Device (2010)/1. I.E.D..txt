No Future   No Life
No Sunshine  No Rights
No Possessions  No Sight
No Expression  FINAL FIGHT

The anger I feel,
rips through my veins,
this hate and delusion
drives me insane.

A world of confusion
Disdained for all things
Its hard to believe
Where dose it begin
Beg for mercy

Beg for mercy
Beg for strife
Beg for tomorrow
Beg for site

WAR, a call to arms
WAR, beat the drums
WAR, a call to arms
WAR, beat the drums

No Future   No Life
No Sunshine  No Rights
No Possessions  No Sight
No Expression  FINAL FIGHT
