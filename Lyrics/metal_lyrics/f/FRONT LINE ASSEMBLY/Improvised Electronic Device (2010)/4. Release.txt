Crawling through these
streets at night,
can't stand looking at the lights.
Voices ringing, in my head,
should I keep living, or playing dead.

As I watch this life disappear,
salvation is my only fear
underneath it all has to end,
echoing sounds of hell never end.

The endless void of slime and grief,
there's no sign of release.
As the heavens begin to fail,
in the sewers we all prevail.

There is no hope as we decay
our final memories start to fray.

As I watch this life disappear,
salvation is my only fear
underneath it all has to end,
echoing sounds of hell never end.

Release me from this burning halo
there is no lifeline in the darkest hour
and there is no saviour for absolute power.
