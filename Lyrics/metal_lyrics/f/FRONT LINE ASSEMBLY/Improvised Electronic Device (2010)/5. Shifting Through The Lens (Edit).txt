mindless human faith 
lays naked there to waste
neurotic choking eyeballs
fuels paranoid crazed cells
slide into darkness, slither down the shaft
slide into darkness, slither down the shaft of hell

movements mirror his subjects
shifting through the lens
dirty shadows dissipate
dissolve into myself
slide into darkness, slither down the shaft of hell

sterilize all contact points
inhale if you want to breathe
dirty poison oxygen, delivers shiva need
sterilize all contact points
inhale if you want to breathe

sterilize all contact points
inhale if you want to breathe
dirty poison oxygen, delivers shiva need
sterilize all contact points
inhale if you want to breathe

sterilize all contact points
inhale if you want to breathe
dirty poison oxygen, delivers shiva need
sterilize all contact points
inhale if you want to breathe

body parts bleached
amputated feelings
fluid core dismembered
dissolved into abyss
