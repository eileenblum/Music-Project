Burn,
burn all
the icons
burn,
burn all
the idols
burn,
burn all,
effigies.

Death,
death to democracy.
Hail,
hail to hypocrisy.

Laws of deception,
laws to control,
laws to crush,
people down below.
I don't want
your hate,
I don't want
your fate,
I don't want
your tears,
to penetrate.
Flowers lay
upon his grave.
I don't want
to be your
religious slave.
Yesterday's hero
is tomorrow's fool,
crowned by glory,
to be ridiculed.

Take,
take back the land,
make, make,
make a final stands.
Spread,
spread the disease.
Take,
take the
parliament please.

Laws of deception,
laws to control,
laws to crush,
people down below.
I don't want
your hate,
I don't want
your fate,
I don't want
your tears,
to penetrate.
Flowers lay
upon his grave.
I don't want
to be your
religious slave.
Yesterday's hero
is tomorrow's fool,
crowned by glory,
to be ridiculed.
