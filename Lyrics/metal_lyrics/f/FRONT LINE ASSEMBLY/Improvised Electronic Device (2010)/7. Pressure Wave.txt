One voice, one world,
it's time the masses are heard.
Severe attacks paralyzed flesh,
faint chance, public unrest.

Poison globe corpse decay,
no final message, pressure wave.
No fading signal, what's done is done.
Grap your weapons and start to run.

A torrent cloud
of massive gray,
rains down terror
of chemical pain.
This lifeless city,
dissolves in rust,
no life forms left,
what happened to us?

The future is now,
there's no way back,
internal bleeding,
generic crack despair
and sickness is
all we have,
no more illusion,
of fighting back.

One voice, one world,
it's time the masses are heard.
Severe attacks paralyzed flesh,
faint chance, public unrest.

A torrent cloud
of massive gray,
rains down terror
of chemical pain.
This lifeless city,
dissolves in rust,
no life forms left,
what happened to us?
