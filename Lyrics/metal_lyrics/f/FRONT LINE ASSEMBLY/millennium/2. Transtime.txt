Infected and rejected
The pressure gets to you

Disjointed and erected
Protection from the mutes

Wasted and exhausted
A new attitude

Restrained to the table
I.V.'s running through

[Chorus:]
This vision is alive
This will survive

Convulsion through the victim
The testing is new

Schizophrenic apprehension
The tension grips you

Agitation Isolation
The methods are crude

Execution Evolution
State power rules you

[Chorus]

Restitution Persecution
What else is new?

Termination of the nation
Its all up to you!
