You turn the page, you see the answers you are looking for. Losing hope, losing faith. Falling out of place, I will never understand what I've done wrong to be this way. 

They turn their backs, they leave me there, waiting silently for the end to come, where do I go from here, I'm lost and no where to be found, where do I go from here? 

I'm not coming back. Just you wait and see. You've fucked up for the last time, petty fuck straight from the start, just a mistake, you are the plague. 

You turn the page. Seek what you're looking for. You won't be around but I will be just fine.
