At night under the full moon
I evoke my ancestrals' strength
I carry with me the strength of a thousand spirits
I feel the southern winds touching my soul
Awakening my primitive instinct
Living in the nature and by the nature
Protected by Pagan Gods
Honoring a warrior's compromise

At night, riding through the forest
I see lights - I see the red fire
I see beautiful witches chanting songs
It's an important night - it's a Sabbat
Ancient spirits are evoked
At a night of respect and contemplation
Naked bodies fire and steel
Magic echoes through the nocturnal mist

[Lyric by MÃ¡rcio Tadeu Silva (2002)]
