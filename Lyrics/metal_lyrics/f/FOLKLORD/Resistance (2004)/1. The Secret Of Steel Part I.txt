The poor and cold village
Was devastated by obscure warriors
The symbol of vipers grappling
Under a black death sky
Desolation - blood on ice
The son sees
Father and mother die
The ashes were stopped, blood has turned to ice
Weapons of steel or of death

Winds and fire came from the sky
Giants hidden in chaos' obscurity
They have taken possession of the steel's riddle
The earth shaken and during the battle
The Gods forgot" the secrets of steel

Growing up and living like a slave
Under the son or snow, a painful life
Games of death - Slaves, but warriors
Killing to survive
Nothing else matter either life or death
Just a killer warrior
As a reward he was sent to the east
To learn the arts of war!

Learning the arts of war
Learning with Samurai warriors

The Kitai's poetry
The Suna's philosophy
The pleasure of the women"
The discipline of steel always remains!

The best in life is
"Destroy your enemies
Hear the women's scream"
The discipline of steel always remains!

A dream of freedom awakes"
Warrior, run to the freedom!

Living as a thief
Getting to know the civilization
Between the cult of the towers
The warrior steals the "Serpent's eye"
Tasting all the flesh's pleasure
Tasting all the wealth
"The result proves to the spirit
As much as to the biggest enemy"

The barbarian has so a mission
To save the young princess
For the king
Only the wish of vengeance lives on
Rage and hatred against Doom
Penetrating the cult of death
The barbarian is captured
And taken to death"
"Flesh is stronger than steel"
So says the tyrant - "Crucify him"

Days on the tree, crucified"
Flesh gives off the smell of death
Dying, after many days,
Salvation comes by a friend
Only power and magic can revive the steel Barbarian

Ancient symbols are tattooed on the warrior's skin
Lighting, black clouds, winds and spirits try to take him
The warrior that after many days close to death
Revives and is thirsty for vengeance!

"The one who does not kill us, makes us stronger" [Nietzsche]
