Under the Sunset, flows the blood on your sword!
Put away your armor, take hold of your soul, impale your enemies
Groans and screams, cries of death, agony and ecstasy
Women and children counting the bodies, victims of war

Clean your sword, red is the blood spilled in Hell

Go ahead, this is your way, your last steps
Dive deep, die in this river of tears and blood
Your soul now has another master, handing it over
The new father live in flames, no god - only Satan

Clean your sword, red is the blood spilled in Hell

In Hell lives your soul rests, paying your sins!

Innocents crying,
Feel the pain
Pain and death
Your sword
Remove the souls
Of sons of war!

Bastards, warriors, walking
To condemnation
No swords, no armors, no life
Until the eternity!

False and christians pray
To Hell you will go!

Clean your sword, red is the blood spilled in Hell

[Lyric by MÃ¡rcio Tadeu Silva (March 1998)]
