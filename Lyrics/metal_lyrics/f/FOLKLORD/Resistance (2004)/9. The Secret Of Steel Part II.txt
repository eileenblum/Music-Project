Rage and hatred in his heart - Thirsty for vengeance
The Barbarian has by his side a loyal Amazon
"Not even all the Gods can torn us apart
I would come back from the death to help you
From the depths of Hell to fight close to you!"

Paintings of war - The war of revenge
Through the obscure caves they go to the cult
The cult takes its course through the night
Orgies, naked bodies - The pleasures of the flesh
Pretty women and human flesh soup!

The princess is there by Thulsa Doom's feet
The warriors are ready to the steel battle
Steel in human flesh - killing all enemies
The princess is saved while chaos rules the night
The tyrant runs away, but sends his death arrow
That gets the warrior's partner that soon dies"

Revenge shall come!
You killed my father
Revenge shall come!
You killed my mother
You took out my father's sword"

Your blood will be shed!
You killed my wife
Your blood will be shed!
You will die and
I'll put an end to your empire!

Your body shall be burned
Where fire does not burn
At the top of the mountains
Until Valhalla"

A great ambush is prepared
Arrows, traps and weapons of death
The Barbarian so prays to his God
"You won't remember if we were good or bad
Why we fought or died
You admire the value, Crom
Then Give me a request, grant me revenge!
If you don't hear me, to Hell with you!"

The axe cuts the flesh - Desolation
Honored men fight with the strength of steel
Arrows, spears and swords,
Against the symbol of two vipers
The warriors cut their enemies
But Doom runs away riding to beyond
Triumphant the warrior raises his sword to the sky
He walks to revenge that is eminent

The tyrant is in his temple
With thousand of disciples
The Barbarian arrives
Like a savage shadow
And unmercifully kills!
Revenge is real!

All the lights have been turned off
The disciples disperse" it's the end of this cult
All the temple burns
The fire burns until the sun rises

Conan takes the daughter to king Osric
He went to west, fought feuds and wars
His name was honored and feared
He became king by his own hands!
