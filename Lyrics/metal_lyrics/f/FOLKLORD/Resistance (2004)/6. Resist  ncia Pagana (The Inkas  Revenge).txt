The Gods would come from the sea
A people waited for their arrival
Pacha Mama mother of this land
Salutes you with the strength of the Sun!
The ancient people respects
Sacrifices are made for thou
Our altar of sacrifices
Has become our shroud

One day damned invader came from the sea
And brought swords, diseases and tyranny

Taking advantage of their innocence
Bastards killed, stole and raped
A people was fooled
Wise and kings were dead
A new culture was imposed
With a cross in the hand
More tyrants arrived
Bastards lambs sons of jesus!

Filthy tyrants unworthy of respect
You have fooled strong warriors
With your religion imposed by priests
You have forgotten the God's fury
You have won a battle
But haven't won the Pagan Resistance
You have killed our heroes
But you haven't put out our memory!

Los Inkas son un pueblo fuerte y de valor
Sobre las montaÃ±as aparecieron los guerreros
La Resistencia Pagana esta viva
Â¡La antigua raza quiere venganza!
Muchos templos y noches de frio
Com la fuerza del Sol y de los Vientos
La sangre de los conquistadores va a caer
Â¡Los Inkas no temen a la muerte!

Â¡Los Inkas no temen a la muerte!

Monuments and impressive empire
The Inka warrior fought
He gave his blood for his culture

Machu Picchu sacred city
An empire that bloomed
The empire of the Sun

The empire of the Sun
And its cosmic forces
The richness of a people
Remains in the memory
Of those who still honour
Its culture and wisdom
And worship the ancient race
By the power of the Sun!

The worship of the supreme, the ancient Gods and the Nature
Remains with those who are still warriors
