- Hate in my soul
Please, come to me...
Enter my soul
I see the disgrace in my life!

I see the future
Tearing my heart
Only I know what I am saying.

Please, come to me...
Enter my life
I feel the Hate in my soul!

- Enter the forest (my sacrifice for you)
Penetrating the dark forest,
I hear the lonely children of the night's cry

In my deep walk
I follow your trail, Nocturnal princess
Your dark veil enchants me
For you the wolves cry
Your magic involve me,
And thus I feel the darkness...

...And KILL!

...And kill for you!
With my sword, I kill
Ancient, children and women
My sacrifice is an
Offering to you
Feel my heart beat in your grip...

- Agony and Death
My blood covers your soul
Your fire burns my flesh
It's my pleasure,
It's your pleasure!

- Deep melancholy
I hand over my life to you
I hand over my soul
Now die, how the time dies
I died for you...
My soul rests
In the shrubs of your heart
Where my tears
Form an ocean
Of sorrows and blood
Spilled for you...
I lived for you
I died for you...
My soul rests

My suffering is devoted to your beauty
(Tears and blood by)
...Princess of the night!
 Never forget those who hand over the
(Live my life and live yours)
...Life for you!

- Triumph
With my sword...
With my sword, I trample over those who under-estimate my power
With the powers of Hell...
With the powers of Hell, fill my soul with hate and rancor
Without either sentiment...
Without either sentiment, I trample over those who under-estimate my power!
Without either remorse...
Without either remorse, fill my soul with hate and rancor!
