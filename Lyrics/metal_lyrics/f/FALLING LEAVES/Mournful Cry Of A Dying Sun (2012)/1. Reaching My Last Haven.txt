Away from all the grace and blessing
Where darkness, despair reigns
Where hope, destroyed by pain

Here I will find myself
Where mourning stars will shine
My tormented soul

In waves of blood I'm drowning
It pulls me down to my graveyard
Clinging in the halo of my abused soul
Preparing me to the forthcoming nightmare
My nightmare

Reaching for my last haven
The realms of endless
My tormented soul

No more hope to fear
No more pain to endure

Adopt me oh ... land of Forsaken
Where demons lay down, in damnation
Time to close my eyes
Surrender myself to the world that made me
To the right place to rest
To the world that I made
