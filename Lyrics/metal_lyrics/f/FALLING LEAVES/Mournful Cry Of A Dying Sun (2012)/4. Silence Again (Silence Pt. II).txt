In the silence again
Watching you drifting away
Incomplete story we are

We are walking through different paths.
The paths saturated with sadness, with grief
Seeking, searching, bleeding
For the warmth of your fire

Silent as the moon floating alone
In the abandoned skies
Silent, as my cry as it blinds my eyes
Silent, as my heart
Every time you go you go away
