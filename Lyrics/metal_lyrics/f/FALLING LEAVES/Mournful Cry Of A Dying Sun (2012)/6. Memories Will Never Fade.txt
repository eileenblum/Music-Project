Smile again
Relieve my endless burden.
Hold me again... Ease my pain,
Hold me... Hold me tight again.

The memories still in my eyes
The memories that torn me inside
That tears me apart,
I cry for my past
I cry for you

Smile now... Make it all go away.
Hold me now... Until the rope rounds my neck.
Hold me now... Hold me tight.

The dark sight of sad memories
Never deserts me of breathing
Of living without you
I cry for my past
I cry for you
