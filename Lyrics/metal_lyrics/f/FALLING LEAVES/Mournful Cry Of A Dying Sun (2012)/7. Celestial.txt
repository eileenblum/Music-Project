Demented nights, with silvery stars
The moon enchanted by the reflex of your eyes
I can smell the silence of your fragrant breaths

Unleash the shyness of your marble skin
The frozen leaves drip frozen drops
Mixed with scent of your heavenly sweat
Rushes my heart to burn my chest
Purifies my thoughts to grasp your vagueness
The sun is rising, you are fading away

My beautiful spirit, my soul obsession
I belong to night, you between my arms
Your crimson lips are mine forever more
Demented nights, with silvery stars
The moon enchanted by the reflex of your eyes
I can smell the silence of your fragrant breaths

The sun is rising, you are fading away
Your crimson lips are mine forever more
