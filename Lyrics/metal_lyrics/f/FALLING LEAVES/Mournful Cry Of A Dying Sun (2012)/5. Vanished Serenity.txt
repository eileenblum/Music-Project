My life slips slowly away
In front of my eyes
I can only stare with my hands tied
Dying inside with no strenght left to stand

Moving backward to the place where I started
The sun will never rise upon us again
I know there will be no sun shining through
There will be no light, no hope

Moving backward to the place where I started
The sun will never rise upon us again
I know there will be no sun shining through
There will be no light, no hope
No one feels the pain I feel inside
No one sees the emptiness inside my eyes

No sun, no light, no hope...

This pain will last forever
Oh lord open my eyes
Or just let me close them
Here I don't belong
Been bleeding so long
In solitude I'm killing time
Serenity slipped away
I only cried for a brighter day
