Here I am deserted into my illness again.
And I'm drowning deep down, within the fade
Sinking down, paling under the hopeless rain
And forsaken searching for a peaceful shade

In solitude shouting for decades
Decades of gloom I buried
Buried inside my chest
In despair I wither and yet,
You're still far away

Instant memories flee, it drains with thee
Burning with hate, hate is all I feel
Dreadly blind, dead, but now I see
These scars I can't, I can't heal

In solitude shouting for decades
Decades of gloom I buried
Buried inside my chest
In despair I wither and yet
You're still far away

Here, I am deserted into my illness again
And I'm drowning deep down within the fade
Sinking down, paling under the hopeless rain
And forsaken searching for a peaceful shade
