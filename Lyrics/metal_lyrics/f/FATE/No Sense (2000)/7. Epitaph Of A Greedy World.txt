I hate this world where I was born
I loathe the knowledge pretension
The ethics and virtue mankind defends

The hypocrisy of human venture where
Altruism is pride on even when
Greed and selfishness are always used
Citizen full of your own importance
Leeches sucking up money and power
I'm fed up with you!
You shall die!
My fury is aimed at those who talk
About love and claim to feel it
This world is unable
To love anything

Blind again and again with its egocentricity
Humans sink into the sea of vile madness

As fast as it can, as fast as it wants
Lost between life and death
The only two realities of existence
Mankind has made its choice
Live in a rotten world, satisfy their greed
Die forgotten of all, without a grave
Too late for you, you're convict(ed)!
