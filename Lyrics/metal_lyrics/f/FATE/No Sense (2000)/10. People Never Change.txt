You can't go out the real human nature
You can't fight against the primary instincts
Don't pretend the opposite!
You're not different

[solo mr 8]

So easy to destroy, too tiring to build
Making the good is too expensive!
No lessons, no progressions
The story remains the same

Lazy human race!!!

Politics of money
Dictatorships of power
Maniacs of control
All over the world

The same mistakes
Full of lies!!!
The same wastes
Full of cries!!!

You're not better
You'll never change
You'll never be better
You won't change!

Silhouette without form
Discolored shadow
Paralysed strength
Gesture without movement

Poor human race!!!
