["Deux routes s'offraient r moi, et lr j'ai suivi celle ou on n'allait pas... Et j'ai compris toue la difference."]
[Robert Frost (1874-1963)]

Obsessed by what they see on TV
Drugged up with the fucking magazines
Idealism of beauty, imposed perfection
All this shit trusted by a retarded generation
"Be like that or be nothing!"

Can you feel the fatal destiny?
The shame of being yourself
The fright of being rejected
The dry taste of exclusion
Its cold breath in your flesh

Being different is often a hard price to pay
The despair of staying unloved forever
Chained by a thick loneliness
Unknown and nameless creatures
Lost in the dark marches of the nothingness

Despised by the fashion fanatics
You don't exist on that rotten earth
Nobody wants to know you
Your world is too ugly
For this lobotomized herd

The stupidity is out of limit
For whom the eye is the first judge
Of what they see
For those who don't know how
To think by themselves

Fuck you!!!
