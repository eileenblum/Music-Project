I don't support
This state of violence
I need to scream
Loud my convictions

I refuse it
Noise is my violence
I fight for peace
Words are my weapons

No solution
Kids play with with guns
No control
They shoot when they want (to)
Early warrior
Allowed to kill?

Life or death
Fucking game with no rules
U.S.A.
(In) God you trust (but) children die
