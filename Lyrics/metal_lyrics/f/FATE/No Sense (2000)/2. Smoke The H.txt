Sensi
Dives me
Into
Love and wisdom

No escape from this brutal reality

I want to get so high
Away from this sick world
Away from this chaos

Smoke shroud(s) my body
It's arousing my senses
Extending my consciousness
My perception of humans' perversion(s)

No more control
We need to smoke
Free the weed

Fume de la ganja, fume de la ganja!

KI-KE-PUI-KUK SMOKE! KI-KE-PUI-KUK SMOKE !
