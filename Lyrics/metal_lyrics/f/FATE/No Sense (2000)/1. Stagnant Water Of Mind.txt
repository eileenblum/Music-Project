Sleeping deep down behind your eyes
I'm the thing who mortifies the mind
Waking p a chaos you've never known
Saturate you with millions (of) insane thoughts

Listen to my voice
An immortal obsession
No more lucidity inside you
I consume your life

I fade your senses and take the control
I guide you through an ultimate carnage

Welcome to hell!

I hope you enjoy scattering bodies
Spewing blood and pieces of bone
Kill and kill again!!!

I'm inside each human being
Waiting (for) the best moment to appear
Make you reach the point of no return
But you don't care
Now I'm you...

...cause you're dead
