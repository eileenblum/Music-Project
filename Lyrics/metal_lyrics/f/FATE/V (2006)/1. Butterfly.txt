Break the silence, break the silence,
Break the silence, before the storm
For heaven's sake, hear me babe,
We got choices to make, we're caught in a thunderstorm
There's no going back once we start down that road,
Hear my song !

[Chorus]
Don't you say goodbye, butterfly, no, no !!
Don't spread you wings and fly, butterfly

Give me the strength to accept the things I cannot change,
Was a fool, didn't see it coming
Don't let the door hit you in the back on the way out,
Feel like the walls are closing in on you
Cause there's no going back once we start down that road,
Hear my song !

[Chorus]

Teardrops falling like rain,
I see your smile that hides the pain
We have nothig to loose and everything to gain,
So stay, so stay !!

For heaven's sake, hear me babe, we got choices to make,
We're caught in a thunderstorm
Give me the strength to accept the things I cannot change,
I was a fool, didn't see it coming
Oh oh oh, baby, baby, baby

Don't you say goodbye, butterfly
Don't spread you wings and fly, butterfly
Don't you say goodbye, butterfly
Don't spread you wings and fly, butterfly

In the silence, in the silence, in the silence,
In the silence, in the silence, in the silenceâ¦
