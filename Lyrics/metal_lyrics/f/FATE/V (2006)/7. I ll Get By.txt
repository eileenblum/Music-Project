I miss you big time, but I'll get by, yeah !

I remember when you kissed me, for the very first time
The way you touched me, and the things you said,
You were nature's grand design
Don't you know how much I love you ? I miss you big time
Still can't believe, you walked away,
And turned your back at me

Was it a dream or was it real ?

[Chorus]
Me-My-Self-I, I wonder why
Me-My-Self-I, I'll get by, year !

You set my heart on fire, yes you did
You locked me up and threw away the key,
And killed the flame in me
You were my true desire and you're gone
Still can't believe, you walked away,
And turned your back at me

Was it a dream or was it real ?

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

I miss you big time, but I'll get by,
I miss you big time, but I'll get by,
I miss you big time, but I'll get by.
