Memories won't die
Memories...
Memories won't die
Memories, memories won't die

There she stood in the doorway, I saw her wrinkled face
I saw the eyes of a statue, dead of emotion
I said : I'm sorry mamma, I should have called you first
But I was in the neighborhood, just passing through.

[Chorus #1]
You shocked me, mommy, don't waste your tears on me
You remind me of daddy, don't waste your tears !

[Chorus #2]
Now I know, it's time to go, it hurts me so,
To say goodbye, memories won't die
Now I know, it's time to go, it hurts me so,
To say goodbye, memories won't die, oh mamma !

It hurts like hell to see you, cause you look like shit
You look like the living dead and you should be in bed
She said : would you take out the garbage,
Cause I can hardly walk
I hold my breath, what a smell,
And watched her pour up a drink.

[Chorus #1]

Now I know, it's time to go, it hurts me so,
To say goodbye, memories won't die
Now I know, it's time to go, it hurts me so,
To say goodbye, memories won't die

[Chorus #2]

Now I know, it's time to go, it hurts me so,
To say goodbye, memories won't die
Now I know, it's time to go, it hurts me so,
To say goodbye, memories won't die
Now I know, it's time to go, it hurts me so,
To say goodbye, memories won't die, oh mamma !
