It's toxic

Sticks and stones will break my bones,
But words will never hurt me
But how can it be a cynic like you,
Always see the worst thing in me

[Chorus #1]
Freedom is never free,
And why do you hate what you see,
Your so blind, blind !

[Chorus #2]
Don't want your love, your toxic love,
I've had enough it's cold and hollow
Don't want your love, your toxic love, that's a hand one to swallow
Don't want your love, don't want your love, it's toxic !

If looks could kill I sure be dead,
There's no doubt about it
Black clouds hanging over your head,
And you don't know when to quit

[Chorus #1]

[Chorus #2]

[Chorus #1]

[Chorus #2]
