You got a face I can't resist, lips that need to be kissed
Crazy about the way you hug the pillow
Smell your long blond curly hair, it's fresh as the morning air
Everything about you makes me crazy
You got a beautiful innocent smile,
And luck of you is good as a mile
Everything about you makes me crazy

[Chorus]
You're my lady, you're my angel baby
Cause when I look into your big blue eyes, you make me crazy
Baby, in all respect a lady,
Cause when I look into your big blue eyes
You make me crazy, you're my baby !

I say I love the way you walk, I adore the way you talk
Babe, I just love the way you tease me
Murder in fist degree, your love is killing me
Everything about you makes me crazy
You're an angel from above, I'm desperate for you love
Everything about you makes me crazy

[Chorus]

A loving touch from you mean so much to me
Your so dear to me, you're my angel !!

[Chorus]
