Life is a miracle, life is so difficult
Life is so good to me, life is so cruel to me
Life is a mystery, I feel like life's pasing me by.

[Chorus]
Is this for real ? See the world falling apart
Is this for real ? Life drive a stake through my heart
But tell me why, I feel alone and so afraid,
Life is unreal, is this for real ? It all ends before it starts

Life is the air I breathe, life is the life I see
Life is the hate I feel, life is the love I feel
Life is a miracle, life starts and ends before you know it.

[Chorus]

I feel like life's passing me by,
And it all ends before it starts.

Life is a miracle, life is so wonderful
Life is a mystery, life's passing me by.

[Chorus]

Life is, life is a mystery.
