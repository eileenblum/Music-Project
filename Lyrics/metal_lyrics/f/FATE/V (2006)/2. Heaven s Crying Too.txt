Shape a child's mind and you shape the world
Cause children never fail, if they learn from your mistakes
You can beat them up, but no matter what,
A minute after they kiss you
But you will pay the price when the bill comes due,
Am I getting through to you !!

Eye in the sky.

[Chorus x2]
You hear your daddy, you hear your mammy's crying too
It's not your fault, they know, heaven's crying too.

You have no one to blame but yourself
And keep in mind that you can't change the past
The touch of your hand and your gentle voice,
Makes the world into a safe place
Cause a child without hope, is a lost child,
Am I getting through you !!

Eye in the sky.

[Chorus x2]

Heaven's crying too.

Shape a child's mind and you shape the world
Cause children never fail, if they learn from your mistakes.

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Heaven's crying too...
