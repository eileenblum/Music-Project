Is this for real ? How come I feel, like I'm dying in your arms
Where's the glow ? I do not know, all I see a dying flame, noooo !!

Caught in fire, hurts so bad, burning mad
Insane with desire, you drive me mad, it's hurt so bad

I say a home without love, is just a empty house,
So knock it down, just tear it down
An iron hand in a velvet glove,
Reach out for you, I swear it's true

[Chorus]
Don't want to wake up all alone,
No one else will do, and it's all because of you
Nobody loves you the way I do
Hold on to me, a love you won't find every day !!

Feel your fire, it's under my skin, I don't give in
Let me take you higher, love will win, let me in

I say a home without love, is just a empty house,
So knock it down, just tear it down
An iron hand in a velvet glove,
Reach out for you, I swear it's true

[Chorus]

Is this for real ? How come I feel, like I'm dying in your arms
Where's the glow ? I do not know, all I see a dying flame !

[Chorus]
