Remember spring back in seventy-three,
Didn't you forget to tell me something
Between the devil and the deep blue sea,
There was no place in your heart for me.

Ahhh, I was alone, so alone, all alone and I grew up in the shade
Ahhh, I was afraid, so afraid,
When I saw you adding fuel to the flames.

It brings a tear to my eye, how many silent tears must I cry, why ?
A memory that refuses to die,
And all the bad things to remember you by, why ?

[Chorus]
Burned child, burned child, me !

I still recall you how beat me up,
And the punches felt like I was hit by a truck
Always afraid, cry myself to sleep,
And what about all the promises you didn't keep.

Ahhh, I was alone, so alone, all alone and I grew up in the shade
Ahhh, I was afraid, so afraid,
When I saw you adding fuel to the flames.

It brings a tear to my eye, how many silent tears must I cry, why ?
A memory that refuses to die,
And all the bad things to remember you by, why ?

[Chorus x2]

I close my eyes, kiss my teddy bear goodnight... goodnight...
No, no, no, why ? Oh ,oh, oh, oh, no more !

It brings a tear to my eye, how many silent tears must I cry, why ?
A memory that refuses to die,
And all the bad things to remember you by, why ?

[Chorus x3]
