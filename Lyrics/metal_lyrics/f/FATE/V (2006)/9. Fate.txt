I see early signs of trouble, dark skies, all around you
Trust me, don't you be a afraid, I'm here, I'm just behind you
Fight back, the invisible evil, get back on the right track
Think straight, they test your skill,
Chill out, cause you're hard to kill,
Chill out, cause you're hard to kill !!!

[Chorus #1]
Hear me baby, hear me honey, hear me baby, hear me !

[Chorus #2]
You feel alone, all alone, left out in the cold
Just give me a sign and I will guide you through
Accept your fate, you can't see straight, left out in the cold
Cross the line and I will guide you through,
I'll guide you through !!!

[Chorus #1]

Set free the fighter inside you, show them who you really are
Mussel in, show no sign of weakness,
Knock them out cause you were born to win
Clench your fist, and they will beg of mercy,
Cause you've got, all what it takes
Get back where you belong now,
Cause you've got a superior intellect,
Cause you've got a superior intellect !!!

[Chorus #1]

[Chorus #2]

You feel alone, all alone, left out in the cold
Just give me a sign and I will guide you through
Accept your fate, you can't see straight, left out in the cold
Cross the line and I will guide you through !
