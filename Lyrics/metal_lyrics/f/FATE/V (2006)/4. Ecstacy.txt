I kiss you, hold you, want to !
I kiss you, feel you, hold you, need to,
Want to, love you, from the bottom of my heart !

[Chorus #1]
You give me, you give me, you give me, you give me love !
I want it, I want it, I want, I want it now !
I'm addicted to your love.

It's so dark I can't see, my hand in front of me
But I can feel and hear your heart beat
You're like a tuesday's child,
Full of grace, locked up in love's embrace
You always bring a smile to my face.

[Chorus #2]
I kiss you, feel you, hold you, need to,
Want to, love you, till death do us part
I kiss you, feel you, hold you, need to, want to, love you,
From the bottom of my heart.

[Chorus #1]

From the morning to the night, I'm working up an appetite
Cause I'm hungry and I hunger for you
Hold your body close to mine, the fruit is sweet
When it ripens on the wine
I'm so in love, you sent shivers up and down my spine.

[Chorus #2]

I kiss you, want to, I love you !
I kiss you, love you, I love you !

You give me, you give me, you give me, you give me love !
I want it, I want it, I want, I want it now !
