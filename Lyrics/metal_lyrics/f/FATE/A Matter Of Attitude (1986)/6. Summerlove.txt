Jenny where did you go
Where were you when I needed you so
Oh, oh Jenny my shining star
Maybe I took you a little too far
Like every summerlove it didn't last
And now all I can say is

She was my summerlove
My one and only
Like every summerlove
She left me lonely

Oh baby,  it broke my heart in two
This silly summer rendez vous
Remember I almost died
The night you kissed me and waved goodbye
Like every summerlove it didn't last
Now all I can say is

She was my summerlove
My one and only
Like every summerlove
She left me lonely

Now all I got is a photograph
Of our names in the sand
But I guess the tide washed it away
Our love slipped through our hands

She was my summerlove
My one and only
Like every summerlove
She left me lonely
She was my summerlove
My one and only
Like every summerlove
She left me lonely
She was my summerlove
My one and only
Like every summerlove
She left me lonely
