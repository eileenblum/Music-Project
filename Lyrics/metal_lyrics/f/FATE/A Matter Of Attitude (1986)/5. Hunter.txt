In the middle of the night
On spiked heels and pants so tight
On a dark and empty alley
On the way home to the kids
She works nine to five
But that won't keep them alive
When the sun goes down
And they're safe and sound
She goes hunting in the streets
Never knowing who she'll meet

She's a hunter, hunter at night
She goes hunting in the streets
Hunter, hunter at night
Hunter, hunter at night
She's the girl that you can meet
Hunter, hunter at night

She was young and threw the dice
Didn't mind to sacrifice
Her youth to a young well spoken man
Now she's paying the price
Through a mist of rain and tears
She hears voices in her ears
A different man for every hour
And a pain that won't disappear
Never knowing who'll be near

She's a hunter, hunter at night
Hunter, hunter at night
Hunter, hunter at night
She's the girl that you can meet
Hunter, hunter at night

(She's a) hunter, hunter at night
She goes hunting in the streets
Hunter, hunter at night
Hunter, hunter at night
She's the girl that you can meet
Hunter, hunter at night
Hunter, hunter at night
Hunter, hunter at night
She's the girl that you can meet
Hunter, hunter at night
