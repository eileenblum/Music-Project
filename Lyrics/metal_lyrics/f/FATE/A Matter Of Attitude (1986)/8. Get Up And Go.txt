Gino is a motorbike dude, babe
A real hot son of a bitch
Sing and dance and raise hell
All over the place
That's all he wanna do
He says I don't mind
'Cause I'm feeling fine
If you wanna hang tough
Give me a sign
No matter what they say
I'm gonna do it my way

I'm gonna get up and go (go)
I'm gonna get up and go
I'm gonna get up and go (go)
I'm gonna get up and go

Gino's got a hell of a woman
Hourglass body an' all
She's got long legs, big smile, beautiful eyes
He's got it covered well you might say
Hang on and I won't let go
'Cause my girlfriend says
She loves me so
No matter what they say
I'm gonna do it my way

I'm gonna get up and go (go)
I'm gonna get up and go
I'm gonna get up and go (go)
I'm gonna get up and go

Some say he's a rude dude
It's a matter of attitude
He says yes when some say no
He's gonna tell us when to get up and go
G-g-g-g-g-g-go!

No matter what they say
I'm gonna do it my own way

I'm gonna get up and go (go)
Get up and go
I'm gonna get up and go (go)
Get up and go

No matter what they say
Gonna do it my own way
Hang on if you wanna hang tough
Do you read me, I can't get enough
Can't let go, can't resist
