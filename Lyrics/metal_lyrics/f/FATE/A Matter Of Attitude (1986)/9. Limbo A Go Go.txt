Oh people, I ain't got anything
I will give you half
If you can solve this mystery
Money doesn't buy everything
I'm sure you must have heard
But what it doesn't I like to see
They tell me this, they tell me that
But as far as I can see
You won't get nothing here for free

Love is all I heard somebody say
But love and that alone won't make the pay
Looking rich and driving uptown
Won't make me float but I'll smile as I go down

I don't mind philosophy
From the back of a Cadillac
Made up two feet above the street
It's just that I don't have the wheels
To spin my mind around
I just want something to eat

Love is all I heard somebody say
But love and that alone won't make the pay
Looking rich and driving uptown
Won't make me float but I'll smile as I go down

Love is all I heard somebody say
Love is all I heard somebody say
But love and that alone won't make the pay
Looking rich and driving uptown
Won't make me float but I'll smile as I go down
Love is all I heard somebody say
But love and that alone won't make the pay
Looking rich and driving uptown
Won't make me float but I'll smile as I go down
