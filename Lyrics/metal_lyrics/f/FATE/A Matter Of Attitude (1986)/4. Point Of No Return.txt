There's a fire deep inside
As I race across the sky
A million light years maybe more
In a wink of an eye
Climbed a mountain so high
And I dived the deepest sea
When I think I'm in control
I lose the power in me
Yes indeed

Is it pain or is it thrills
Is it a demon in my soul
I see the fires of hell
But I never felt so cold
I broke the speed of sound
Flying up the Milky Way
Thought it was imagination
So I couldn't help but say
You got to let me know

Is it really love I'm feeling inside?
Then the page has turned
Is it really love that I just can't hide
I've crossed the point of no return

Feel the energy inside
Oh lord! It drove me wild
But like Samson with Delilah
I was just a child
Felt I had the universe
In the palm of my hand
Need a simple explanation
One that I can understand
You got to let me know

Is it really love I'm feeling inside?
Then the page has turned
Is it really love that I just can't hide
I've crossed the point of no return

I was looking in the mirror
Staring at myself
Searched beyond the vision
Found somebody else
You can only feel pleasure
If you've experienced pain
I don't know where I am
But here I go again
You got to let me know

Is it really love I'm feeling inside?
Then the page has turned
Is it really love that I just can't hide
I've crossed the point of no return
Is it really love I'm feeling inside?
Then the page has turned
Is it really love that I just can't hide
I've crossed the point of no return
