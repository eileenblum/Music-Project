Farrah remembers when she was in school
Wasn't the wisest kid but she had a secret tool
She did all her homework riding in a car
When things got tough she just let down her bra

She said take your time
Take a little of mine
'Cos you never know just what you might find
Right down the line
I'm gonna get what's mine
I'm gonna make you spend your last dime

So Farrah got out of school and it felt good
She said now it's time to head for Hollywood
With a talent like hers she just can't be denied
And signed a deal in a waterbed late one night

Take your time
Take a little of mine
'Cos you never know just what you might find
Right down the line
I'm gonna get what's mine
I'm gonna make you spend your last dime

Now that I'm a star it's time to find a man
Someone who appreciates and understands
That life is easy if you travel with the sun
You know, this time I might head for Washington

Take your time
Take a little of mine
'Cos you never know just what you might find
Right down the line
I'm gonna get what's mine
I'm gonna make you spend your last dime
Take your time
Take a little of mine
'Cos you never know just what you might find
Right down the line
I'm gonna get what's mine
I'm gonna make you spend
I'm gonna make you spend
