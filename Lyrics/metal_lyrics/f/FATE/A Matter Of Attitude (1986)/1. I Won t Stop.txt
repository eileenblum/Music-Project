Everybody are you ready to go
I'm all dressed up, it's a brand new show
I'm so hot tonight, a hundred above
I'm gonna sing the all night long
Erection blues to everyone
Ain't that tough, I can't get enough

I won't stop, I won't stop this time
I'm gonna get what I came for
I won't stop, I won't stop this time
I want all I can get

Rock 'n' roll was meant to be
Like one 'n' one adds up to three
It's in my blood, straight from my heart
Take me, take me, can't you see
I'm jumping up 'n' down on the MTV
Royal flush, baby, I hold the cards

I won't stop, I won't stop this time
I'm gonna get what I came for
I won't stop, I won't stop this time
Want all I can get

I'm only seventeen
I tell the magazines
Just take a look at me
I live your fantasy

I won't stop, I won't stop this time
I'm gonna get what I came for
I won't stop, I won't stop this time
Want all I can get

I'm only seventeen
I tell the magazines
Just take a look at me
I live your fantasy

I won't stop, I won't stop this time
I'm gonna get what I came for
I won't stop, I won't stop this time
Want all I can get
I won't stop, I won't stop this time
I'm gonna get what I came for
I won't stop, I won't stop this time
