I ain't got a dime
I'm always broke
But I got a feather in my hat
I'm a babbling swaggering mean old man
I'm the coolest cat
When I come swinging down the street
The chicks get hotter than as hell
I love women and wine
Got plenty of time
That's my game
You oughta do the same

Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it

I gotta tell everybody to do it
'Cause there really ain't nothing
Really ain't nothing to it

I'm not the new sensation
I grow my hair as I please
Really don't care too much about fashion
I've got pages on my knees
Not looking for anything
'Cos I got all I need
I love women and wine
Got plenty of time
That's my game
You oughta do the same

Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it

I gotta tell everybody to do it
'Cause there really ain't nothing
Really ain't nothing to it

Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it

I gotta tell everybody to do it
'Cause there really ain't nothing
Really ain't nothing to it

Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it

I gotta tell everybody to do it
'Cause there really ain't nothing
Really ain't nothing to it
There really ain't nothing
Really ain't nothing to it
There really ain't nothing
Really ain't nothing to it
