The smell of your body
Is still in the sheets
I look out the window
And watch you as you fade away
Into the streets
Words we have spoken
Still fill this room
They never fulfilled their mission
'Cause you left me much too soon

I can't stand losing you
I couldn't live without you
I'm begging you, don't break down
What took so long to build
I can't stand losing you
I couldn't live without you
I'm begging you, don't break down
What took so long to build

I cry out in anger
But what does it help
'Cause when I think of who's to blame
I can only think of myself
I still feel this passion
You don't seem to care
I try to ignore it but it's so clear
Our love vanished into the air

I can't stand losing you
I couldn't live without you
I'm begging you don't, break down
What took so long to build
I can't stand losing you
I couldn't live without you
I'm begging you, don't break down
What took so long to build

I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
Still I'm losing you

I sent you a letter
Got one in return
I couldn't believe just what I read
It seems you've finally learned
It said "baby forgive me
I've been such a fool
I want to come back and baby, this time
I'll stick to the rules"

I can't stand losing you
I couldn't live without you
I'm begging you, don't break down
What took so long to build
I can't stand losing you
I just couldn't live without you, girl
I'm begging you, don't break down
What took so long to build
I can't stand losing you
Couldn't live without you
Don't break down
I can't stand losing you
Couldn't live without you
Don't break down
