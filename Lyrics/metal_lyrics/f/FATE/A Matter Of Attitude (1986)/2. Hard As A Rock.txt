Now you see me
Now you don't
When I say I will
Baby, you know I won't
I bring you silver and
Turn it into dust
Gave you my heart
Baby, filled up with lust

I wanna give your life reason
But give you nothing else but hope

I rock hard, hard as a rock
I rock hard, hard as a rock

You think it's complicated
I think you're right
I say I'm yours forever
But I'm not home at night
Love and affection
I give it to you
I give it to the whole wide world
But still I stay true

I don't wanna see you crying
And I will make it up to you

I rock hard, hard as a rock
I rock hard, hard as a rock
I rock hard, hard as a rock
I rock hard, hard as a rock

Juvenile decay, baby
Is how it may appear
I'll bring it all together
I'm gonna make it clear

I got my cards on the table
And I will give all I got

'Cos I rock hard, hard as a rock
I rock hard, hard as a rock
I rock hard, hard as a rock
I rock hard, hard as a rock
