Housewife at thirty five
With a feeling she thought had died
She needs someone to talk to her
Two kids and a house to clean
But when it's done she changes the scene
The it's time to call the doctor
She wanna play catch me, catch me
If you can

I am, I am, I am her backdoor man (repeat)

Little girl who's just been wed
Lying all night alone in bed
When the man is off to pay the bills
You know doing the dishes may be fun
But then again in the long run
She needs someone to give her thrills
She wanna play catch me, catch me
If you can

I am, I am, I am her backdoor man (repeat)

Suzi is the queen of the prom
But her boyfriend, Quarterback Tom,
He doesn't know it but he's into guys
And when the tears have gone
She needs someone to turn her on
Then she picks up the phone and sighs
"I wanna play catch me, catch me
If you can"

I am, I am, I am her backdoor man (repeat)
