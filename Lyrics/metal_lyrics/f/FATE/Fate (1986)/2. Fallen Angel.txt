Little Lucy from out of town
She was such a pretty little girl
She said "Hey daddy, you know something
I'm gonna be somebody in this world
I'm gonna make a fortune
I'm gonna be your pride"
But now she walks the streets every night

All night long

It's just another fallen angel
Who won't be coming home again
It's just another fallen angel
In the night
Who won't be coming home again

Johnny's almost fifteen
Just got kicked out of class
Hanging out on a corner
Trying to sell his ass
He's working for the money
Trying to kill the pain
You'll never see him cry
But there's holes in his veins
He's out tonight

It's just another fallen angel
Who won't be coming home again
It's just another fallen angel
In the night
Who won't be coming home again

Fallen angel
Fallen angel
Fallen angel
