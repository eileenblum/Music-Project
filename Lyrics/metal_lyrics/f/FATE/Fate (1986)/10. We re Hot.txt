Sweet sweet mama
Here comes the sun
But that ain't gonna change a thing
'Cos I've got you in my sheets
And baby that's all I need
To make my rainy day
The radio is blasting
The blanket is too small
It's been like that for some time
But we don't care at all
I can see you're smiling
As I lie between your thighs
Light up a joint
Look into my eyes

We're hot so hot
I think we're so hot together
We're hot so hot
I think we're so hot together

Well, I used to go to school
To get my Ph.D
Studying all day
Drinking oriental tea
But then I met you at McDonald's
Baby you looked so good
You said "Do you wanna share a coke?"
Babe you knew I would
And now

We're hot so hot
I think we're so hot together
We're hot so hot
I think we're so hot together

Now we're fooling around
All over town

I took you to the movies
But you took me back again
You said you wanted to have a party
Then you showed me all your friends
Someone got me up
And someone got me down
I want all the way spinning
Round and round and now

We're hot so hot
I think we're so hot together
We're hot so hot
I think we're so hot together
