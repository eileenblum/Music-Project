It is the morning after
The final tragedy
Only few are left alive
To face the misery
The old men dropped the bomb
It's the same old song

Victory, no surrender
There's no turning back
Only victory
That really matters
When everything is lost

Well, we've got presidents
Older than Earth itself
And the games they play
Might send us all to hell
It's their final Jack
A bullet in your back

Victory, no surrender
There's no turning back
It's only victory
That really matters
When everything is lost

Will we make it? Huh
Like a snowball's chance in hell

Do you want someone to blame?
Or do you want the truth?
'Cos those who hold the guns
Ain't that really me and you?
That's what it's all about
Only one way out

Victory, no surrender
There's no turning back
It's only victory
That really matters
When everything is lost

Victory, no surrender
Victory, gotta give 'em all you've got
