I've got a bottle of wine
I wanna share it with my girlfriend
Tonight is the night that never ends

You see I've just got paid
I'm gonna spend it on a good time
I think you know what's on my mind

Some people say that I am crazy
But that don't really bother me
'Cos I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna rip it up

I'm gonna rock'n'roll
All over this town
There's gonna be some action
Before I settle down

There is a party tonight
And the drinks are all on me
I've got this feeling, gonna let it free

Some people say that I am crazy
But that don't really bother me
'Cos I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna rip it up
