Speeding up the engine
At the starting line
Fifteen cars waiting for the signs
The flag is up
Now the track is clear
I kick off in the first gear

Everybody race me
But no one's gonna pass me
They all try but I'm always on my own
In the danger zone

Pedal to the metal
And they're off my back
Round the curves
Nearly went off the track
Need a little fuel, "boys fill it up"
Gotta keep moving, I just can't stop

Everybody race me
But no one's gonna pass me
They all try but I'm always on my own
In the danger zone

Going out on the last lap
Still in the lead
Total concentration
From my head to my feet
I'm a daredevil baby and I'm living in sin
I race them all and I always win

Everybody race me
But no one's gonna pass me
They all try but I'm always on my own
In the danger zone

I need a little danger
Gimme gimme danger oh yeah
