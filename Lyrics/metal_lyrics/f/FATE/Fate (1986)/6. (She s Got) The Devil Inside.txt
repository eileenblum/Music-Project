Here's a story that I'd like to tell
About this woman who's got me under a spell
She makes me feel like I've never felt
I just gotta buy what she's gotta sell

It's not that I need it but then again
She smiles at me and calls me her friend
And even though she makes me a wreck
I won't stop until she breaks my neck

She's got the devil inside
She's got the devil inside her heart
She's got the devil inside
She's got the devil inside her heart

Her love is sweet, sweeter than honey
So sweet I hardly think about the money
Howling like a wolf crawling on the floor
I'm wild as a tiger but she cuts off my claws

This affair is a sick romance
But you got to play the fiddler if you wanna dance
Here I am with a bleeding heart
I hand her my soul, she tears it apart

She's got the devil inside
She's got the devil inside her heart
She's got the devil inside
She's got the devil inside her heart

Repeat chorus to fade
