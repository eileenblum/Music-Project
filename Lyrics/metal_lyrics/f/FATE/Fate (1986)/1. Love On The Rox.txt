Streetlight, every night
I'm waiting out for you
Anticipating, it's such a shame
'Cos every night I'm standing there in vain
Again and again

I wanna love you
I wanna be the one tonight
I wanna feel you
But you put our love on the rox

Out of touch, it's too much
Tried every trick in the book
I sent you flowers and stuff to make you glad
All the other guys says: "That girl make you look so bad"
Baby, ain't that sad?

I wanna love you
I wanna be the one tonight
I wanna feel you
But you put our love on the rox

Listen here, I'm talking to you
Our love used to be so good
I know I was a fool you know like once or twice
But that's all over, now it's time to break the ice
Baby, no more lies

I wanna love you
I wanna be the one tonight
I wanna feel you
But you put our love on the rox
