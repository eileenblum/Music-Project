There he comes, the rich man's son
In daddy's car with the radio on
He's got his eyes in the rearview mirror
he's got his eyes on you

I've noticed you are not yourself
It's like I'm talking to somebody else
Oh how I've been missing you
I don't know what to say or do

Don't walk away
Don't believe a word he says
He's an uptown boy
Baby, you're his downtown toy

Baby if I could only
Make you see that guy's a phony
My love is all that I can give
You thought it was all satin sheets

You winded up in his backseat
He left you standing
In the rain on the corner
But don't say I never warned you

Don't walk away
Don't believe a word he says
He's an uptown boy
Baby, you're his downtown toy
