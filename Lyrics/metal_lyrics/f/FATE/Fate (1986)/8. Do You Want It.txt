Honey, I've been watching you
And I know you know I have
I think you got what I need
And I ain't all that bad
They way you walk
They way you talk
I can tell you wanna play
And I've been standing in the bar all night
Now I'm drunk enough to say

Do you want it
Do you need it
Do you feel it
Feel it too

I'm dizzy, I'm so goddamn dizzy
I stumble cross the floor
But I get up just to see
You're walking out the door
Hey little girl, won't you give me a chance
You've got everything to gain
You won't be sorry when the morning comes
*cos then I go again

Do you want it
Do you need it
Do you feel it
Feel it too

Do you want it - come and get it girl
Do you want it - I'm all yours
Do you want it - Oh la la
Do you want it - Come and take it girl
