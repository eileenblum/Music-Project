I remember when I saw her for the first time
Little did I know
I used to sit in front of the TV-set
With a remote control and my video

A fantasy, you and me
She became so real on my TV-screen
I was hypnotized by her way to move
She was a dream come true, and a beauty-queen

You took your pride before your stardom
Now I know that I was wrong

One by One, you really made it
To the top, how does it feel?
One look can tell you what she's hiding
She denies, but she took 'em One by One

Somebody told me to stop dreaming
I was just a boy, so I didn't care
I bought the magazines, I read the interviews
About "Mother Earth's Pretties Millionaire"

Forever and ever
I would never give up, she was the one
But the rumours were true, she betrayed me
And her only excuse was "done is done"

You took your pride before your stardom
Now I know that I was wrong

One by One, you really made it
To the top, how does it feel?
One look can tell you what she's hiding
She denies, but she took 'em One by One

You took your pride before your stardom
Now I know that I was wrong

Now I know that I was wrong
A fantasy, you and me
She became so real on my TV-screen
I was hypnotized by her way to move
She was a dream come true, and a beauty-queen

You took your pride before your stardom
Now I know that I was wrong

One by One, you really made it
To the top, how does it feel?
One look can tell you what she's hiding
She denies, but she took 'em One by One

One by One
One by One
