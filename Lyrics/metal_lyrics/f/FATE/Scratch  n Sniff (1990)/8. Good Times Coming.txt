Something is wrong, girl, but you won't tell me
It's so hard to make it right
You've been hurt before, scars so deep
You cry yourself to sleep at night

You say you're not my kind of woman
How can you tell?
Hold on, your heart can not lie

'Cos I know that
Good times, good times are coming
Just keep on going
You say we never gonna make it
I'll prove you're wrong
Good times, good times coming
Why don't you trust me?
You say we're never gonna make it
You just got to hold on, gonna make it right

When you are lonely, you can not learn
By trying to forget
You gotta give it one more shot, girl
What you see is what you get

You say you're not my kind of woman
How can you tell?
Hold on, your heart can not lie

'Cos I know that
Good times, good times are coming
Just keep on going
You say we never gonna make it
I'll prove you're wrong
Good times, good times coming
Why don't you trust me?
You say we're never gonna make it
You just got to hold on, gotta make it right

You say you're not my kind of woman
How can you tell?
Hold on, your heart can not lie

'Cos I know that
Good times, good times are coming
Just keep on going
You say we never gonna make it
I'll prove you're wrong
Good times, good times coming
Why don't you trust me?
You say we're never gonna make it
You just got to hold on, gotta make it right
Got to hold on
Got to hold on
