She knows me and I know her
We've been colleagues for a while
I've been knocked out since the first time
That I saw her amazing style

Precision is her trademark
Every cut is so precise
She operates with passion
She's got hunger in her eyes

The way she cuts into a heart
It's so professional
It looks just like a way of art
And I'm in love

I was doing an autopsy
Nervous out in my fingertips
'Cos she sat there and observed me
With a big smile on her lips

"Go ahead and open him", she said
So I grabbed my scalpel
And started to cut into the dead
But there was nothing left

Angela
You stole my heart away
And then you stole my liver
I just can't take anymore
Angela
I won't survive another day
'Cos you make me shiver
And I can't find a cure
I'm a surgeon in love

She's a teaser and I know that
She's making a fool of me
But no matter if I try to ignore her
She's still a master of surgery

Just tell her what's your problem,
And she will solve it fast
So close your eyes and sleep now
And hopefully you'll last

She does her talking with her hands
And I would die to listen
So just relax, she understands
If you're scared to death

Angela
You stole my heart away
And then you stole my liver
I just can't take anymore
Angela
I won't survive another day
'Cos you make me shiver
And I can't find a cure
I'm a surgeon in love

I guess I failed but at least I tried
You can not buy her
She only cares of what's inside
But I won't give up

He won't give up
He won't give, he won't give up
He won't give up
He won't give, he won't give up
He won't give up
He won't give, he won't give up

Angela, Angela
You stole my heart away
And then you stole my liver
I just can't take anymore
Angela
I won't survive another day
'Cos you make me shiver
And I can't find a cure
I'm a surgeon in love
