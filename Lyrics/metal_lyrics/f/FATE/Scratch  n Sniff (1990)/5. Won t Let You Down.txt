We grew up together in the low part of town
Life wasn't easy, but living was free
When times were rough there was no one around
On our own, just you and me

Oh, still we carry on
Oh, no matter what; we'll stick together

We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna go what it takes together
'Til the day that I die, forever
I would never let you down

We kept us alive, took each day at a time
Close to the edge, a life on the loose
The will to survive led us closer to crime
Captured in life, no chance to choose

Oh, still we carry on
Oh, no matter what; we'll stick together

We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna go what it takes together
'Til the day that I die, forever
I would never let you down

I remember they tried to steal our dreams away
Telling us we would never get anywhere
But we had our pride and we did it our way
A taste of life and we didn't care

Oh, still we carry on
Oh, no matter what; we'll stick together

We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna go what it takes together
'Til the day that I die, forever
I would never let you down
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna go what it takes together
'Til the day that I die, forever
I would never let you down

Never let you down
Never let you down
Never let you down
