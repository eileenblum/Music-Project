I'm so tired but I can't go to bed
Memories of you, spinning around inside my head
They keep me up all night, waiting for the morning light
I can't go on like this, I'm a stranger to myself

Trapped in a corner, I can't hide anymore
I have to face the truth, it's never gonna be like it was before
I was wrong on you and you were wrong on me
I gotta keep on going, I've got to move on

Oh, my back's against the wall
Oh, I gotta have it all
I won't be another fool for your love, girl
You won't make me crawl
Oh, I gotta have it all

I've been fooling around much too long
There's nothing I can do anymore about the things that went so wrong
I have made mistakes, that God nobody's perfect
I learned a lesson, but you don't have to teach me another one

Trapped in a corner, I can't hide anymore
I have to face the truth, it's never gonna be like it was before
I was wrong on you and you were wrong on me
I gotta keep on going, I got to move on

Oh, my back's against the wall
Oh, I gotta have it all
I won't be another fool for your love, girl
You won't make me crawl
Oh, I gotta have it all

Trapped in a corner, I can't hide anymore
I have to face the truth, it's never gonna be like it was before
I was wrong on you and you were wrong on me
I gotta keep on going, I've got to move on

Oh, my back's against the wall
Oh, I gotta have it all
I won't be another fool for your love, girl
You won't make me crawl
Oh, I gotta have it all

Oh, my back's against the wall
Oh, I gotta have it all
I won't be another fool for your love, girl
You won't make me crawl
