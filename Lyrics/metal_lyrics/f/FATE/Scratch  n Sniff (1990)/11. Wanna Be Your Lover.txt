I've searched through day and nights
For someone just like you
I can't believe it's true, I'm standing here with you
My life has been a mess, but my luck has turned
Why don't I take some time and spend it with you
Oh, am I dreaming?
Yeah, I wanna be your lover

Hey Girl, don't you turn away, I've got something to say
You see I'm a man and you're a woman
Why don't you take my hand, I've got something for you
Take your time is not a crime, the name of the game is love

I wanna be your lover
I want you so, you set my soul on fire
Let's go undercover, I wanna be your lover
I'm excited

Hey Girl, turn around, look what I have found
A rose is perfect for a woman, yeah
You have the prettiest smile and face I've ever seen
Oh, you smell so good, oh, you make me wild

I wanna be your lover
I want you so, you set my soul on fire
Let's go undercover, I wanna be your lover
I'm excited

Don't turn your back on me, baby, can't you see
The way you move me feels so good
Let's spend the night together, and babe, I guarantee
I'll take you to a place you never been before
We got no time to waste, baby, hold me tight

Hey Babe, it feels so good, I'm getting on with you
May this feeling last forever
Oh, I want you to take my hane, and babe we'll fly away
We'll take a trip to Paradise, Baby, hold me tight

I wanna be your lover
I want you so, you set my soul on fire
Let's go undercover, I wanna be your lover
I'm excited
I wanna be your lover
I want you so, you set my soul on fire
Let's go undercover, I wanna be your lover
I'm excited
Excited
