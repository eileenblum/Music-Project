It's been love and hate, this life of mine
I've seen pleasure, I've seen pain
What was good and bad, I can't define
Still I'd do it all again

You need a heart of gold
To see what's right or wrong
When the rain feels cold
Keep searching for the blue sky
Don't tie me up anymore

Freedom, that's all I need
Don't ever try to put a chain on me
My freedom, I won't give in
I'll keep on searching till the end of the world

I have crossed the sea to find what I need
I've been waiting for so long
River deep and mountain high
What goes up must come down

You need a heart of gold
To see what's right or wrong
And when the rain feels cold
Keep searching for the blue sky
Don't tie me up anymore

Freedom, that's all I need
Don't ever try to put a chain on me
My freedom, I won't give in
I'll keep on searching till the end of the world

Freedom, that's all I need
Don't ever try to put a chain on me
My freedom, I won't give in
I'll keep on searching till the end of the world

All the friends I had, way back then
Grew up and settled down
Guess I'll never learn to compromise
Praise the Lord, I'm still unbound

Freedom
Don't ever try to put a chain on me
My freedom, I won't give in
I'll keep on, I'll keep on searching for

Freedom, I won't give in
Don't ever try to put a chain on me
My freedom, that's all I need
I'll keep on searching till the end of the world
