(now dig this)

I'm coming closer, and this time it's for real
Close your eyes now babe, and tell me what you feel
It must be love, it must be love

I'm going crazy, I can't get you out of my mind
Give me your hand now babe, seek and you will find
It must be love, it must be love

I wake up in the night to hear me calling out your name
I can't go on without your love or else I'll go insane
Else I'll go insane

Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you
Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you
Yes, I would, babe

When I see you moving, I just can't believe it's true
Look behind your shoulder 'cos I'm coming after you
It must be love, it must be love

You can call me crazy, you can call me mad
But I can't get enough, I need your love so bad
It must be love, it must be love

I wake up in the night to hear me calling out your name
I can't go on without your love or else I'll go insane
Else I'll go insane

Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you
Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you
Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you
Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you

Coming closer, and this time it's for real
Close your eyes now baby
And tell me what you feel
Must be love, must be love

I'll do anything for you
This is true, babe
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going crazy

Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you
Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything, anything for you
Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you
Walk on fire, fire
I'll do anything for you

This is true, babe
Anything
