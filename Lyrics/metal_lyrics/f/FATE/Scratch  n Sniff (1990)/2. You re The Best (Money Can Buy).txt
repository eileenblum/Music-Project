Your sale is falling and you got to change it
You're a businessman, what will you do?
Why don't you take my advice, make up a story
Run it on page one, who cares it it's true?

You are the best, the best that money can buy
You're the best that money can buy
Moneytalk everyday, make a fortune; sell a lie

Take a well known person and make a scandal
Turn his good reputation into dust
Prostitutes and cocaine, a selling combination
"A Man Of Sin, with uncontrollable lust"

You are the best, the best that money can buy
You're the best that money can buy
Moneytalk everyday, make a fortune; sell a lie

Another lie, another story
They print it all to sell an extra copy

You are the best, the best that money can buy
You're the best that money can buy
Moneytalk everyday, make a fortune; sell a lie
You are the best, the best that money can buy
You're the best that money can buy
Moneytalk everyday, make a fortune; sell a lie
