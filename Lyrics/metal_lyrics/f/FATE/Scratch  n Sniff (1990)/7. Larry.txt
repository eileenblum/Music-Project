[Music: Eklundh, Lyrics: Eklundh]

My name is Larry and I'm thirty-two
I'm so unhappy, I don't know what to do
I am the son of a businessman
I was born to be a part of his plan
Brought up to carry the family crown
I do my best, but my lips are brown

Middle class, I just can't, just can't take it
Efficiency is the name of my crime
Kissing ass, I've gotta, gotta make it
Borrowed money, borrowed time
Live my life under a microscope

I have to work for the rest of my life
I've got a car and a house and an expensive wife
I only bought the car to brag about the price
But I can't afford it; only used it twice

Live my life under a microscope
Oh, I would do anything for success
My son is gay and my wife is on dope
Oh, all I do is becoming a mess

Haven't fulfilled my father's dream
And now he doesn't love me anymore
I think I need a primal scream
But I live next door to my mother-in-law

Live my life under a microscope
Oh, I would do anything for success
My son is gay and my wife is on dope
Oh, all I do is becoming a mess

Middle class, I just can't, just can't take it
Efficiency is the name of my crime
Plastic cash. I gotta, gotta fake it
Borrowed money, borrowed time

Live my life under a microscope
Oh, I would do anything for success
My son is gay and my wife is on dope
Oh, all I do is becoming a mess

You're working like a galleyslave
You got to have a microwave
To keep your living standard high
And your neighbours satisfy
And don't forget to cut your lawn
Otherwise you'll be hang by dawn
Middle class, middle class
The words are tattooed no your ass
