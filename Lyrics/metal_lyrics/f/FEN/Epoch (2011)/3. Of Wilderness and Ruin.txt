Many have been those who walked before meBut few now remain on these blasted pathsWhere once we stood and gathered as oneFragmented now are those of the unbound We stood and watched as the sky turned to fireAnd the sacred hollows of old were sunderedEclipsed by the dawn of a new eraThere is nothing for me now above or below this Earth For what long ago was held to is no moreA hollow shell, a shattered conceitCondemning the memories of a thousand generationsTo the abyss of the forgotten My eyes shimmer as they fall upon the ruinsLoss scars my spiritMy vehemence carries on cold, death-charged windsIt burns through me, scars my veinsAnd wracks the remains of an already tormented spiritRage and despair entwineAnd a broken man surrenders I lay and stared as the soils turned to dustAnd the last of the stars diedEclipsed by the dusk of finalityThere is nothing
