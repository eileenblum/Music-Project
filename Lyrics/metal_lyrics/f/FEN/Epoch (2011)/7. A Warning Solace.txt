Nothing that breathed disturbs this enclaveAs the monolithic cosmic millstoneGrinds ever onwardsCrushing meaning beneath cold stone It is here that I lieAt one with the darknessWhere timelessness breeds tranquillityAnd the ravages of frailty thrashAgainst the wallsOf a reality long agoFractured and scattered And yet... so slowlyIt starts to slip away(draining, sinking)My strength weakensWith each shuddering breathWith the fading of the mistsAnd the dying howlsOf the withering wildernessWreathed in decay Solitude is torn awayMy cries pierce the silence like arrowsAs this refuge is rent asunderThe fragile fabric collapsesRealisation wracks the spiritAnd I stare into the glittering eyesOf yet more unbridled sufferanceRending me As this solace wanes, the wind grows colderThis once-verdant landscape now standsStooped and alien, stripped of spiritNothing remains to soothe a lamenting soul What was once mine is no moreRipped open and naked, I bleedBeneath the wanton iron skiesThat pour misery onto a hapless thrallMy nothingness exposed to all... (So little now still standsScorched earth and desolation and legacy of shameFor which I now pass judgement through the vesselsOf a new and forlorn Epoch)
