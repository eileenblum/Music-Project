The chaos of lifeCalling in the twisting veinsWhere lifeblood pumped and the children came to drinkNow blackened and dryThe husk of our existenceLies parched and cracked on this barren land Silence The stillness speaks of nothingFrom the blank slate horizon to the ceiling of the skyLife for lifeThe cacophony of the carnival forgottenOnly shadows and memoriesLingering in the hands of the earthCarried on the endless journey of the wind We call no moreTheir mouths are alive with selfish yieldWe have no tongue to speakDrained of beingOnce we sheltered in the hollow insideNow we are spectresGhosts of the floodSome day the rains will come againSo long we have waitedLost between planesNothing but the echo of a perpetual cryWe will dance in the gathering watersWhen breath shudders coldlyThrough the carcass of our essenceBringing out throats aliveDrowning stone and dustWe will call againCall to the eternal, empty skiesWe will call again
