Moving amongst the many pathways of the aetherThe silent one, the harbinger of woeThe oracle of sorrows yet to beThe unnamed foreshadowing Marauder! Like the carrion-crow that circles the charnel-fieldHe knows his moment is soon "Render ash Unto Them!" As the penumbral darkness lengthensAnd the layers of quintessence are piercedOn void-trails of scorn he descendsTo sow the seeds of this world's decay Crawling and cowledOracle of the End, the doom-sidhe Watching... WaitingWatching... Waiting Stands unmoving upon the blasted moorA sightless gaze that sweeps this realityGhost-white fingers bring blight to fleshAs whispering words strip lifeFrom the very landscape of menReaving the soul of the Earth
