We have stood for centuriesSentinels that frame the skyWe have felt the exhalationOf souls passed under us We have trembled in the cold windsThat lash the soils of deathWe have drawn upon the poisoned strengthOf earth steeped in sorrow Our limbs have twitched and quiveredTo the sound of myriad snapping necksOur roots remained anchored and unmovedTo the whispers of ending that clamour within All now is silent and stillYet resting not are the echoes of the lostAs twilight descends and the murders wheel to roostThe fallen rise again like mist To drape once more from our armsLike the rotting sails of a long-abandoned vesselThe scars of time have reaved their pain notAs the land sings its death-song again We have stood for centuriesSentinels that frame the skyWe have drawn upon the poisoned strengthOf earth steeped in sorrow A final threnody for a forlorn convoyThat wanders, lost, in this bleak labyrinthCondemned to the aether beyond timeA memorial pain unyielding that seeps into our souls
