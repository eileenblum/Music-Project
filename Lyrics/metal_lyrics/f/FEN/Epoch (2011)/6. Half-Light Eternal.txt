Illumination wavers in the strengthening grip of duskDarkness summoned something more than dreams and empty promisesEvery blade and bole turns towards the fading lightAnd all freeze to capture this moment in eternal clarity Around and around the centuries thunderRevolutions of earth and stone, oceans rise and fallThe waves of life flow high tide and beyondThis crystalline second still warm on the retina of remembrance Bruised and melancholy is the momentThat stains these skiesAsh will saturate the bones of our footsteps echoSandstorm future melts through the half-light tangleThe end retreats ever onwards, suspended in fireShadowed by ages, enthroned in foreverThis hour, this minute, this secondThis very second Every memory furrows through the folds of timeShadows aflame with resonance before your eyesNow branded by the sharpened nature of his night
