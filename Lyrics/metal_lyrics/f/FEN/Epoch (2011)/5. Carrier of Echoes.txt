Keening...A reflection of all that wasThe bell tolls...Throughout the perpetual passage of infinity I was born long agoMy form fashioned from the primordial rockStorm-winds seared the umbra and my verdant spiritThe essence of an era forged by the elements And millennia have passedFrail flesh teems with memoriesI watch with spectral eyesThe knowledge mine - and mine alone Ancient paths that sear the landscapeLey-lines scouring a wounded earthWhere long-forgotten shades now wanderBeneath the glare of the cold moon The very soils imbued with a sense of longingBeneath my tread teem myriad memoriesThe essence of so much now lostEntombed in within the catacombs of a history forever buried Yet I know not what lies aheadNo secrets unearthed from my time in the aether have INo keys to unlock the myriad entangled strands of what will beBehind me, a wake of unending despairAhead, a formless void as yet unscarredWaiting for the Echoes of the dead to come
