Let these waves take me away,
Let this tide pull me away.
Let these waves take me away,
Let this tide pull me away.

These ashen waters swallow the grey skies,
In this tumultuous churn I gasp and thrash,
Human driftwood torn and flung,
By the escalating currents of despair,
All encompassing bleakness.

I'm under this sea of sorrow,
I'm under these waves.
I'm under this sea of sorrow,
I'm under these waves.
Let these waves take me away,
Let this tide pull me away.
Let these waves take me away,
Let this tide pull me away.

The storm breaks, the grim expanse of the sky now reflects the maelstrom,
All pervading grief foaks into the chaos wrought atmosphere.
Shattered and tangled I am,
Wrenched to and fro before finally I am dragged,
Helpless and broken,
Beneath the waves.
Now my struggle ands,
I sink beneath the angry roar,
Surrendered to this unforgiving ocean.
And here, below the frenzy, drowning in solemn grace,
I am at peace.

I'm under this sea of sorrow,
I'm under these waves.
I'm under this sea of sorrow,
I'm under these waves.
Let these waves take me away,
Let this tide pull me away.
Let these waves take me away,
Let this tide pull me away.

This still iron-hued expanse of nothingness,
Echoes the forceful silence,
Permeates my soul,
I, the only stain on this perfect blank horizon,
Lost to colossal voids.
