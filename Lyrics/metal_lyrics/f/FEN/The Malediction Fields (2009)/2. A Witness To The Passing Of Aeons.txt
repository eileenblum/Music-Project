Uncoiling amongst the stars, my spirit-fight is endless,
I abandoned the prison of flesh millenia ago,
Parted my veins to shred the last veil,
Shrugged aside the chains that anchored me.

Left the shattered shell of my corporeal form to descend,
Into the blackness of this malicious earth,
And as my being merged with the very fabric of this withered planet
A new pathway was opened before me.
With each passing of the moon,
With each cycle of regeneration,

I felt a new strength bond with the very essence of my existence,
An amalgamation of the aether and the nameless emissions of the void,
Tethered to the flickering flame of my soul.

Ascension thus was born and beyond these mortals realms I foar,
Watching the stars collapse beneath the fury of the old ones.
The febrile breath of the universe,
Exhaled, Scattered, Dissipated,
Carried on the drifting, timeless winds,

I have watched civilisations rise and fall on this weakened planet,
I have seen the weakness of man cleansed by the rage of the cosmos,

Watched the skin of this decaying world scarified beyond recognition
Lifelessness if all that remains as my endless vision,
Watched the last light of reality gutter
And die.
