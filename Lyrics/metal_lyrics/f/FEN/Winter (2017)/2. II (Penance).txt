Time

That humiliating arbitrary adjudicator 
Your cruelty builds in an endless cycle of decrepitude
Skin slackens with each passing seconds 
Flesh weakens and softens 
Bones stiffen in agony
Dreams dissolve
Hopes slough
A blackened pulp of deepest despair
A mind enfeebled and afraid
Gazes back upon a path of waste and regret 
Gazes ahead only to t he cold and the empty 

All will fall
All will fail
All will fall 
All will fail

And so with each heavy, broken-backed step I inch closer to my reckoning
Sinews stiff, sloughing, sagging
Resonating with slow decay like catgut strings
Draped across a stave of rotting timber 

The cathedral looms... Tearing, oppressive, stentorian
Cries once echoed in the chapels of cold stone
Where cowled figures dripped with feverish piety 
And candles of reverence flickered in the torpid darkness of unanswered prayers 

Stoic monolith that bleeds black redemption 
Onyx shroud shed like skin
Penance driven into the maw of the soil
Stygian crust that chokes on the carcasses of the forgotten

There is no room here
Suffocation... Rejection...

A hopeless soul slithers in vapid vestibules 
Echoes 
Silhouettes 
Fading notions of what once breathed false proclamations 
Granite shaped by the echoes of supplication 
Myriad visages gaze in judgement 
A solemn phalanx stands as one 
One singular totem of accusation
Choral, somnolent striking the marrow 
Of a soul laced with corrosive regret 

Guilty - Pathetic - Cringing 
Crushed by stone
Withering within the inquisition cloisters 
The last shreds of waning hope thus scatter

I cannot see what lurks within these sepulchral shadows 
Emanating whispers of a thousand past condemnations 

One thousand past condemnations! 

Freezing hands reach - coiling, cloying

My name is but dust

And I flee again
