[Music: Pisano / Barton / Rossetti, Lyrics: Pisano]

The autumn night outshined the sun. Worlds collide, align above
The warmest smile a captive gaze. The semblance of the fallen age
Throughout years their fates long past. No melodies within the tones
No poetry in letters (breathe for you, die for you)

They say all things; in time will come to end
In absence of sound, the songs will play no more
As time comes undone, silent words will breathe
In stories never written, old heroes sometimes fall

Days turn to months and so to years. Many battles, many tears
Cutting petals from a rose. Wilted way so long ago
Souls entwined in endless love, first sign of conflict and they part
Endure the fire, face the storm. Wishing you were in my arms
Old memories etched to graves. Are chapters filled with pain
A satiable emotion. Will never be the same
A love once so alive, and now the fire dies
So here's the final hour. With this our last goodbye

They say all things; in time will come to end
In absence of sound, the songs will play no more
As time comes undone, silent words will breathe
In stories never written, old heroes sometimes fall
