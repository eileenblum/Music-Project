[Music: Pisano / Barton / Rossetti, Lyrics: Pisano]

"So many autumns
I cried myself to sleep
Search within for hope
Still yearning to believe"

"Divide begins inside
When faced reality
The world that never was
Exists within my dreams"

Desires once, we trust. Believed in
Universe, how we have come "salvation's lost"
Risen, above these glacial skies
Seek the wisdom we meant to achieve

Within control, our fate is lead from choice
And held our hearts "between us all"
To stand together, more somehow
Yet never seek a place, a paradise

Oh, within our own

[Chorus]
Closing these eyes don't fear believer
Not bound by past
No limits to confine you
Discover he's not finding reason
To heaven reached his arms
The path you stride, with stars shall guide

Our hero, what name do we give you?
Do we write these songs and tell these tells "tell these tales"
"I gather not pride, for what I have become"
"Nor have I forgotten. My life must done"

[Chorus]
