[Music: Pisano / Barton / Rossetti, Lyrics: Pisano]

How do you call yourself my brother, when it's me you have forsaken?
To see by truth, and for yourself. You kill for your own mind and sake
So now you're king? To take my queen. And still you strive, adore yourself
Believe in me, not what you see, these eyes you'll have to face once more

[Chorus]
Two forces against one in the elders shrine
(Forever destined, though not divine)
Failure at what we seek
White knight fantasy, against that who defies
(The demon rages, the angel dies)
Create, in me once more

Innocence gone resolve the measure. Abandoning what must be done
You'll writhe be me and fear the darkFace the demon you've made me become
Your skies are lost your fathers weep, as darkened forms take shape and shall descend
A fatal strike right through the heart. The rain shall wash away your sins my friend

[Chorus]
Two forces against one in the elders shrine
(Forever destined, though not divine)
Those who will possess the key
White knight fantasy, against that who defies
(Become the demon, angels die)
Create, in me once more

[Solo: Pisano / Rossetti / Khalilov / Rossetti]

The silver lining of your image. I am your serpent, I'm your king
I vowed myself, my humble keeper. In shame I extend my plea
In consequence and vengeance seeked. I've lost sight of, who I was
I've meant to kill, that which have killed. And it is now, what I've become

[Chorus x2]
