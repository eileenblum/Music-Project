[Music: Pisano / Barton / Rossetti, Lyrics: Pisano]

Carry on, confide with reason, behold creation watch the heavens fall
Torn, divide and conquer, guide us to the way.
Darker this obsession, takes its form in vain

Arose in sins lunatic motions, poisoned gifts and thus the spirit dies
Arose divine transcended fire lead away, give unto your fear

Breathe, a little stronger (little stronger)
Speak, a little softer (little softer)
Hold a little longer, silence once was gained

Always ever, dreaming of tomorrow, lost on consciousness of yesterday
Side by side we'll walk with demons, confined to changes as you're lead by fate
Crossing our perpetuations, as this mind becomes, divine light imitations

Realize, complete this circle
Self portrait we'll paint
Boldness, pride, obsession
Know not of this fate

Legacy defined by destiny.
Indescribable it bares high hope
Perceptive eyes praised upon beauty.
Behold my angel, our Eden burn

On the edge we'll seek the never (not getting stronger)
Falling for forever (spark ignites a flame)
Silence lamentations, miss my

[Chorus]
Angel.
Dreaming of tomorrow in the yesterday, walking side by side with demons.
Confined to chains that bind yourself to hate
Lost inside your soul

[Chorus x2]
Always ever, dreaming of my angel.
Lost on promises of yesterday
My angels gone I walk with demons.
Confined to changes as your lead by fate angel.
Dreaming of tomorrow in the yesterday, walking side by side with demons.
Confined to demons that you helped create
Watch my angel burn
Burn!
