[Music: Pisano / Barton / Rossetti, Lyrics: Pisano]

This portrait paints a thousand words, though I could not define
This life we lead, with love believed and dreams were meant to come
Though seasons change spring, summer, fall. And winter come to pass
If it wasn't me, then who it be to believe this would had last?

They say to me, all things must come to end
Alas my starry night, is fading from my hand
Pieces that were never in my dreams
This isn't what I thought; I still believe and always will
The stars upon I wished

True love. It has no happy ending (true love doesn't end)
To never lose the meaning. To never have regret
Live my life without you, all these memories
This nightmares never ending. The tears that hold no meaning, anymore...

To hope, to dream and still believe this may be a curse or gift
I've been taught to always dreams and so it comes to this
To me this wasn't anything to me she was it all
It's killing me, it's killing me to lose the one I loved
Time by time, we sometimes fall. And so we'll rise again
It took our memories burn to ash, for me to understand
I gave it up; I gave it all, even though I'm left with none
I'll always my morning star; she'll always be the one

True love. It has no happy ending (true love doesn't end)
To never lose the meaning. To never have regret
Live my life without you, all these memories
This nightmares never ending. The tears that hold no meaning, anymore...
ã
Consequence of living a fairytale. We always have to wake up,
Sometime. We always have to see it's just a dream
Live my life without you, all these memories
This nightmares never ending
The tears that hold no meaning, anymore...
