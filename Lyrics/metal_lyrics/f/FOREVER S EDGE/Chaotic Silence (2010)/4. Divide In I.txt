[Music: Pisano / Barton / Rossetti, Lyrics: Pisano]

Absence Silence inner calm, passive thought consistency
Alignment of the universe. Morning rise, souls release
Mind what once but unified. Kept together, tears apart.
Brother co-exists by brother. A new beginning, eternally

Whisperer a holy war. Genocide evoked religion
Cry me havoc, cry me fear. Equated hate compelled beside me
There is no credo and no cause. No order, code to confine me
Within illusion I hold time, I am the spirit.
I am the word

Divided mind shall stand together
Reflection of the soul
Alike yet worlds apart
The light transcends the darkness
And the balance holds forever
The two unite as one

The light will fail will fade away. This ignorance which makes you weaker
I am the anger dwelled inside, the missing key a puzzle piece.
I give the power, will to live. I keep the ether flame alive
Provide strength to face this ever treacherous, world of fear.

If only you could see the meaning. Your eyes would see the light
This inner flame it's burning deeper. Endless fire, burns inside
I offer you the chance so dearly, to let go these hateful feelings
A peaceful end, awakening, a second chance. Eternal peace

We can bend the will of nature, we can formulate our fates
Mirror without dimension. Present conviction, futures change
An endless grey, a soul perplexion. A shade of light not seen before
Our signs and stars in perfect harmony. We are alike, we are to be
Divided mind shall stand together (stand together)
Reflection of the soul
Alike yet worlds apart (worlds apart)
The light transcends the darkness
And the balance holds forever (it holds)
The two unite as one
