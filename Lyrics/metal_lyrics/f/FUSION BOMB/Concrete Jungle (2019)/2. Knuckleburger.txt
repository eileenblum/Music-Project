Another day, another shift to get through.
There are so many things in life I'd rather do.
Instead I'm stuck with flipping patties for a living
And hearing orders barked at me through the office door
From a man I cannot stand!

Everyday I regret applyin' for this dead end job
And wonder how it got this far, will this nightmare ever stop?
I'm sick of the grease and first degree burns!
How I wish to give my boss the sandwich he deserves!

Forced labor to pay for a college degree,
A worthless paper with no career guarantee.
And even though I've got this critter breathing down my neck,
I'm not allowed to vent 'cause he's the fucking guy
Who signs my monthly check!

All of a sudden this guy barged in and demanded food to be made.
The second I saw his disgusting face I knew he'd be the target for all of this build-up of hate!
He ordered a sandwich and some fries.
Instead, all he got was a Knuckleburger!

A punch right through the teeth!
The counter decked with his blood and canines,
I spurt out of the scene.
I'm damn sure I crossed a line.

The following day, I drag myself back to work.
I strut through the front door with this odious smirk.
As I predicted, this guy yells that never again will I earn a buck
And hands me the lay off papers, does he really think that I still give a fuck?

I grab his hair and just ram his face on the heating plate
And sear his greasy cheek, his fat ugly face I will incinerate!
I can't stop myself from going further!
He begs for mercy, but all he gets is a Knuckleburger!

Knuckleburger!
