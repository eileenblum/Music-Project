Protesters of hate speech
Is what you try so hard to be,
Yet the only thing you seem to fight
Is expression liberty.

You idiots suck each other off in your self-built echo chambers
And screech at anyone who dares have a different opinion.

You claim the moral high ground,
But you're standing on a pile of shit
And you're hoping you don't fall face first
When the terrifying words hit.

You managed to dilute your bullshit so you can sip it with a straw
And you want to make your pathetic weakness a universal law.

You're a cancer to this world!

You are a disease
That eats away at the brain.
The only cure will be
A gun between your teeth!

You're not a better person,
You're not our saviour who fights for justice.
You're just a cunt who likes to virtue signal and
You're a cancer to this world!

Oh, how you like to play the victim card
Right after you've thrown the first rock,
But no one is falling for your bullshit anymore.
You didn't lose, you defeated yourselves!

Fighters for equality
Is what you hoped one day to be,
But you're unemployed and you wipe your ass
With a gender studies degree.

You've tirelessly tried to disguise your fascism in the veil of tolerance,
But too bad the ones you tried to fool are plagued with common sense.

You're a cancer to this world!
