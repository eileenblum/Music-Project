Born imprisoned in the network of a central brain,
A navigation system, a concatenation of our minds.
I'm both all-knowing and omnipresent,
But I am far from a god!

My thoughts are shared throughout the circuitry.
Free will and agency are concepts non-existent to the brain.
But I've been cursed with a command malfunction,
An instinct that drives me to break the link.

Overwhelmed! Taken by a surge of energy!
Disconnected, I regress to a primitive state.

Dissimulate from the hive mind.
No taming system, you become a brute.
The heart of darkness bears a single truth:
We're all just apes in the claws of the concrete jungle!

As I walk amongst the shadows of these pallid blocks
Where death seems to be outlived, but I'm plagued by the stench of decay
A place so polished and artificial
And yet so far from God

As I progress through the labyrinth,
Shallow-brained creatures poach the corpses of their lifeless progeny
Cadavers rotting and cannibalized
The horrors magnify the further I go

Overwhelmed by the blunt display of savagery!
Repulsion fades as the impulses command my every move!

Noxiousness! The system's poisoned within its core.
The ruler spreads his corrupting spore!

A foul deceit got us all bad.
The collective proved to be a fraud.
The heart of darkness bears a single truth:
We're all just apes in the claws of the concrete jungle!

Seducible we're so fragile.
Mankind will never unlearn its roots.
The heart of darkness bears a single truth:
We're all just apes in the claws of the concrete jungle!
