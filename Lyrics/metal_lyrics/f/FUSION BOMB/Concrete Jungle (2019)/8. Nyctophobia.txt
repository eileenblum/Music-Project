Crushed by the mace I just swung at your face
Now your skull barely hangs by a thread.
That's what you get when you think that I'd let
You just tell me that I'm fucked in the head.

Years of abuse as a stupid excuse
To deduce that in fact I'm deranged,
But that's in the past 'cause this day was your last
Since your spine has now been rearranged.

No!
Please tell them I am sane!
I swear I'll serve my time for all those people I have slain!
No!
I swear I'm not insane!
Please don't send me back or they'll stick ice picks through my brain!

You won't turn me into your test rat!
I don't want my mind to fade to black!

Your bloodcurdling cries have now drowned out your lies
As I forcibly scoop out your eyes
And put you at rest with a knife through the chest,
But I'm still waiting for your demise.

All of a sudden you cough up some blood and
You scream that it's time for my pills.
As I turn around I am thrown to the ground
And held down by every single limb.

No!
Please tell me I am sane!
I don't want their poison filled syringes near my veins!
No!
I'm sure I'm not insane!
Please just get me out or they'll stick ice picks through my brain!

You can't turn me into your test rat!
I don't want my mind to fade to black!

No!
Or am I really sane?
I can see my victims, now I feel their horrid pain.
No!
I think I am insane
Did they just convince me? Were my struggles all in vain?

You have turned me into your test rat!
I don't want my mind to fade to black!

Thrown onto my death bed,
Tied down with leather belts, Iâm totally immobile!
Muscles twitching, Iâm having a seizure
As I wake up from the failed anesthesia!

Cold metal intrudes,
I can feel every pound of the hammer!
My conscience pulled out by the roots,
The hourglass has been shattered.

Fear of forced lobotomy,
Cast into the night, Nyctophobia!
