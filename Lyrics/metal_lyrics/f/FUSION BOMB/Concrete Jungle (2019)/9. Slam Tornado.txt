A fastidious plague is threatening our nation,
A bulg of posers festers in our midst.
The time has come to extirpate this infection,
Their heads will burst in our slamming pit.

Attention cadets, recruitment has begun.
Our objective: eradicate these runts.
Mission poser holocaust requires skill.
Thrash Metal Militia teaches you the drill.

Throw your fists around you, drag your friend into the pit!
The riff compels us to the slam tornado!
Show no mercy for the weak, tonight we beat them up!
The slam tornado rages on, the whirlwind never stops!

You'd better do your best 'cause there will be no tomorrow
This night will culminate in a bloodshed
Your appetite for violence has now turned to overload.
The blood of these hypocrites will stain the walls red.

If you hit the floor, you need to get up and thrash some more!
Fusion Bomb is teaching you: NO GLORY WITHOUT GORE!
Jab around your feet, aim for your partner, keep up the speed!
There's one rule to heed, never stop or you will die in this stampede!

Throw your fists around you, drag your friend into the pit!
The riff compels us to the slam tornado!
Show no mercy for the weak, tonight we beat them up!
The slam tornado rages on forever,
The whirlwind will never stop!

ENTER THE CYCLONE, don't jib the suck, every molecule of you wants to thrash!
NO! Resistance to the vortex, this giant human blender feasts on poser flesh!
Succumb to the maelstrom, in gravitational clutch, no way out no escape NO!
Prepare for the next blow, the only that you crave, your sole purpose in life
Is to dance the slam tornado!
