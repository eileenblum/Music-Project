Arms and legs he grew as soon as we left him alone.
Beer and booze he drank, his deadly anger then awoke.
A toxic stench he farted, a fart that leaves you with lung cancer

A town left with contamination, its fate is extermination.

To grow stronger he engulfed the abundant alcohol from the brewery.
To feed its stomach burning ashes, he smoked the tobacco factory.
Humankind is doomed! Why did he ever hit puberty?

No one will ever escape the
Teenage mutant ninja ashtray!

He will take us to his realm,
An infinite number of cigarettes we'll inhale.
For forgiveness you will pray,
But he's no god, he's the
Teenage mutant ninja ashtray!

In a sea of beer and ashes we are bound to suffocate.
Into our virgin mouths, his toxic seed he will ejaculate.
Humankind is doomed, he will take us all away!

No one will ever escape the
Teenage mutant ninja ashtray!
