It's when you wake up,
Dripping wet of your sweat,
That you're torn out of bed
By the pool in your ass crack.
Try to free yourself from the heat,
But the bed sheets stick like tar.

Standing up would be an easier act,
If only you weren't so fucking fat!
Every floor tile's smoldering your feet.

Reaching for the melting handle,
You hope your saviour is behind the window!

Skin starts cracking open, blisters burst,
You're bound to
Suffer through the blazing heat!

Burned alive,
In the green house of your bedroom.
Hyperthermia caught you in its
Grip of raging flames.
Far too late,
Now your bed is set ablaze,
Despite the early diagnose,
You failed to change your ways.

Body fluids boiling over,
You have fallen
Victim to the blazing heat!

Your limbs turn to ash right to the bone
As your skull and entrails just explode.
No more could your balls hold back their load.

Every wall now decorated
With your calcinated flesh.
You've been righteously cremated
Finally you've
Perished in the blazing heat!
