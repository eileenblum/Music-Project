Roaming with the team,
I hope I'll get to see some
Easy casualty!

Got you in my sight,
This is no even fight,
Vulcan cannon might!

Lock and load my gun,
You'd better start to run,
The fun has just begun!

Long story short,
Killing is my sport,
Hear howitzers roar!

Armed to the teeth,
Hover over the weak!

No scattered body parts,
No bloody mess to tidy up.
This is clean killing,
From afar I push the knob,
I dig up the floor
And plough their huts to dust,
Scorched earth I'm leaving,
As my next target waits to be concussed.

I practiced this in games,
It's basically the same,
I'll never know your name!

If you hit the ground,
I'll shoot another round,
Just 'cause I love the sound!

Compassionless,
I mow down all your nests,
Your families won't last.

Your sons I will abort,
Just one more kill I scored,
But do I feel remorse?

No scattered body parts,
No bloody mess to tidy up.
This is clean killing,
From afar I push the knob,
I dig up the floor
And plough their huts to dust,
Scorched earth I'm leaving,
As my next target waits to be concussed.

None escape the clutch of war,
Now it's over it's me that I abhor.
Through my vizor I saw them run.
Both their parents riddled gone reduced to none.

My gun in my hand,
What I've become I can't stand.
Put the barrel to my head,
I'll cure myself with a load of lead!
