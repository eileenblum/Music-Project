Safety has you trapped,
Yet the shackles of restraint that used to hold me back just snapped
And you've left the gate wide open!

The walls collapsed.
I will be your true foundation. Let your mind relapse
Into the abyss it struggled to escape!

Retribution,
The fangs of spite hold tight!
Parasite!

Embrace the rage,
Let out your feral scream!
I've left the cage, savage and wild I
Feed on the zest of scorn.
The ebon blood,
Will always flow upstream!
No well can quench this undying thirst, I
Cherish the zest of scorn.

Born in the lust for vengeance,
I expand in your demise.
Sworn to the cult of hatred,
You let off your poor disguise.

Muscles will contract,
Abandon the reticence that tethers you to common sense.
Submit to the surge of anger!

Rush of wrath,
I am your clenching fists you wish to stomp ahead.
Come on now, bury me in flesh!

Embrace the rage,
Let out your feral scream!
I've left the cage, savage and wild I
Feed on the zest of scorn.
The ebon blood,
Will always flow upstream!
No well can quench this undying thirst, I
Cherish the zest of scorn.

Now I dominate, your rationality inane, I am your fate.
Set free finally, accept the power bow down before my mastery.
Time to reclaim hate as a progressive force to you that is innate.
Come embrace the truth, your inner-self means living a tooth for a tooth.

Your inner beast makes you turn against all men,
It makes you swing your fist again and again.
Relentlessly you're lowering them,
On the mere conglomerate of flesh that once was called a human.
Forever on dominates the zest of scorn!
