Pray and call my name at night
Your master's time has come
The final day on earth is near
It's better start to run
Never peace of mind
Rotten deep inside
Distorted paths of human beign
Demoniac's work's begun.

Grace did not shine on you
A creature you despise
There is no time to change your fate
My feelings, cold as ice
All your blood I'll spill
I'm waiting for the kill
Accomplish your desire
When death's raging from the skies.

I don't need anyone 
My heart is black
I died to live in wrath
The incarnation all you dread.

Now my assault is over
Hell's the place you'll go
What started with a simple game
Turned into morbid shows
Wake up of your dreams
Your death I'll make complete
Destroy the cross of Jesus Christ
Impale the godless Pope.

I don't need anyone 
My heart is black
I died to live in wrath
The incarnation all you dread.
