Our father, which art in Hades
Unhallowed be thy name
The kingdom of darkness come
Thy will be done
In earth as it is in heaven and hell
Give us this day our daily blackest purest blood
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
And lead us into temptation
And deliver us to evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
Death and Mayhem, forever
Rest in pain.
