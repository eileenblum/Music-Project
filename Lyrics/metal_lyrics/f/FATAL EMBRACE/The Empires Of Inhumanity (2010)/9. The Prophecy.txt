Don't come to join with me
Don't summon priests of hell
You can't forgive me for I've sinned
I read the book of dead
Behind cathedral's walls
In ancient passages
Forbidden words of magic rings.

Baptized in sacred blood
The birth of jackal's son
The prince of Hades, throne of pains
I've seen the gates of fright
Unbroken seal of hell
And evil curse's  sorrounding
In my mind, I go insane.

Damned to live eternally
In baphomet's reality 
Domineering majesty
Terrible capacity
Demonical abnormity
Feeling insecurity
Pierce my soul.

Profanation of celestial light
Execration of the crucified
Desecration of the holy rites
Come, freeze my blood.

Dark are the secret scripts
Old prophecies of doom
Enchanting starlight's fading black
I'm waiting for the night
No time to beg for grace
I'm captured in my dreams
In conflgrations I'll be back.
