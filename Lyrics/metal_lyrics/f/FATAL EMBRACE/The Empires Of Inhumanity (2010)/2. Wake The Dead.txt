Penetrating forces
Menacingly decay
Obliteration all divine
Life's denied and razed
Impending resurrection
Hail the creature's only son
Foretold by dark prophetic witches 
Your judgement day has come.

Kill the innocence
Wake the dead
Black infinity
Final mystery of life.

Disapproving evil
Victims of hell's crimes
The desecration of your soul
And pleading for demise
You can't resist temptations
Enter the labyrinths of death
Most intensely aspiration
Feel everlasting grasp.

Kill the innocence
Wake the dead
Black infinity
Fills my head.

Massive powers deep from hell
Damned in pain
Unrelenting slaves of death
Perished in flames
Sinners rot in mortuaries
Every night
Oppressed angels, burnt and lost
Sacrifice your lives.

Darkness rips away the days of freedom
Senseless struggling to fight
Fading memories of confessions
Blinded by the light
Contemplate the cruel domination
Gruesome price to pay
Sucking all the blood from the bodies
Watch your corpses decay.

Kill the innocence
Rape my mind
Black infinity
Turn to die.
