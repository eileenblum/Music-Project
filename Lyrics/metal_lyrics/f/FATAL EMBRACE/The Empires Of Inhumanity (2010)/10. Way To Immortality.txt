Look behind the door
Feel the itch for more
Satisfy your curiosity
Please don't be afraid
You shall see your fate
Way to immortality
Beyond the human mind
Go and you can find
A place of hellish inferno
Demons are calling you
Free satanic brood
Fear the invincible unknown.

An old tradition
The curse of dead
Unleash the evil
You won't regret.

You're my sacrifice
Dark world shall arise
Ice and fire burn your skin
Poison through your veins
Hate destroyed your brain
Place of black sadistic sins
Come and follow me
Take my hand and see
Endless pain and agony
Nailes deep in your flesh
Feel your own distress
Death is your reality.

An old tradition 
In pools of blood
Unleash the evil
To kill your god.

Into the mirror, dark reflections of my life
I've seen the child of yesterday
With sorrow in his eyes
I've found the world of pain and raw brutality
I found the gates of suffering, to immortality
I close the door, a voice inside my brain
The time is right for my release
Black wizards call my name
I will return, but I not I say goodbye
The only way to live in peace
The only way to die.

Look behind the door
Feel the itch for more
Satisfy your curiosity
Please don't be afraid
You shall see your fate
Way to immortality
Blackness you will learn
Wait for my return
Devil's draining all your lives
God left me alone
Scary death unfolds
Wretched nightmares are realized.

An old tradition
The sky turns red
Unleash the evil
The dreams you dread.

Forever torment 
The night is young
Enslaved in malice
My work is done.
