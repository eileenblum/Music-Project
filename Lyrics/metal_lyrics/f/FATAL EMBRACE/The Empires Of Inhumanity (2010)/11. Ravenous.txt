Warlords of darkness have landed tonight
Worship the master of pain
Ravenous winged dictators from hell
A shuddering sadistic game
There is no morning, you'll never escape
Driven by unholy greed
Craving for torment, the pleasure to die
Spreading abhorrently seed.

Harlots of evil are rising from ground
Guiding your way of despair
Banished in madness, deliverance by death
Smell of your blood fills the air
Rot, rotting to the end of time
Procreation of the dead
Trapped into immortal rites
In hell.

Satan, our savior, lead us in your reich
Pray until the final day, await the antichrist.

Warlords of darkness have landed tonight
Straight from the temples of flames
Savage inhuman emperors returned
Shuddering sadistic games
Striken by forces of hellish command
Destroying all hope of rebirth
Betrayed and anguished by Lucifer's hate
The morbidly spell to preserve
Sadistic nights
You're crying for mercy, but there is no grace
Sadistic law
The pits of decay open wide
Eternal fights
Kingdom of Mayhem is spawning your fear
Eternal war
A power that keeps you alive.
