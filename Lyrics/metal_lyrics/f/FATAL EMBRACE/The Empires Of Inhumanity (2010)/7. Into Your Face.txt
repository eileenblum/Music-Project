Deep in your depression
Built in human scorn
There is no solution
Shattered and torn
Violent damnation
Fall into contempt
The meaning of existence
Your death is not the end.

Meet the devil on the other side
Nightmares crawling in your sleep tonight
Your life is over, and out of time
Close your eyes and we'll disappear
To the world of everlasting fear
Your hell is open
Death comes right into your face.

Uncontrolled desire
Trapped in mortal pain
Final destination
Your soul can not be saved
Murderous intentions
Dreams of agony
Hungry for the future
The place you will not see.

Meet the devil on the other side
Nightmares crawling in your sleep tonight
Your life is over, and out of time
Close your eyes and we'll disappear
To the world of everlasting fear
Your hell is open
Death comes right into your face.

Violent damnation
Fall into contempt
The meaning of existence
Your death is not the end
Finally
Paranoid 
Eternally
Cry
Killing all deceivers
Neverending maze
Suffering and sickness
Never seems to change
I'll not live forever
Death will set me free
Step into the unknown
You will remember me.

Meet the devil on the other side
Nightmares crawling in your sleep tonight
Your life is over, and out of time
Close your eyes and we'll disappear
To the world of everlasting fear
Your hell is open
Death comes right into your face.
