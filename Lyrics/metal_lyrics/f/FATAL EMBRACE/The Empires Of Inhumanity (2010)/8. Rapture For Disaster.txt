Demons break out of bleeding skies
Praise the savior, the almighty master
Residence of hate and nocturnal lust
Frenzied rapture for hell's disaster
Hear the trumpets of Armageddon
Toll the knells for the scum of mankind
Stamped by distress and lunatic pain
For certainty, to lose your fate.

Tainted blood
The underworld 
Infected brains
Obscurity remains.

Slaughtered victims, torn to pieces
Piles of guts, rotting hopeless sinners
Boiling of your blood, steaming festering flesh
Ripping corpses, a nasty dinner
Severed limbs, smashed bones and skulls
Blistering skin, pungent smell of madness
Angels, raped and hacked, in inverted bells
The horror lives, your God has fell.

Tainted blood
The underworld 
Infected brains
Obscurity remains.

Demons break out of bleeding skies
Praise the savior, the almighty master
Residence of hate and nocturnal lust
Frenzied rapture for hell's disaster
No disguise can hide the devil
Burning tempests, annihilation
Surrendered to your god, It's not your loss
Pure fascinating holocaust.

Tainted blood
The underworld 
Infected brains
Obscurity remains.
