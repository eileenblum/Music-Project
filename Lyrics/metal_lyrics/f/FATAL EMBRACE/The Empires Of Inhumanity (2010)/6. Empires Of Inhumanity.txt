Silence filled the dark with cold
A thousand years old lore
Legends of barbaric reign
Behind infernal glorious gates.

Where blood's flowing down
Across my universe
Where blood's flowing down
Where blood rains down
Where blood's flowing down
The devil's paradise
Where blood's flowing down
Where blood comes down.

Black winds turn life into death
Forever walk of pain
Lights of Hades are shinning bright
Bleesing me before I die.

Where blood's flowing down
Receive my sacrifice
Where blood's flowing down
Where blood rains down
Where blood's flowing down
From ancients crypts of hell
Where blood's flowing down
Where blood comes down.

Satan's curse, deep in ypur soul
Protected from distress
And your love will set me free
Empires of inhumanity.

Where blood's flowing down
On godforsaken ground
Where blood's flowing down
Where blood rains down
Where blood's flowing down
On shores of raging flames
Where blood's flowing down
Where blood comes down.

Midnight, the time has come
Knights of hell's domain
Spread your wings of great terrific fear
Heaven's fighting aimlessly 
Mankind, raped and slain
Desolation all around is near
Bewitched and possessed.

Master, Oh Lord of Death
The scepter of your grace
Send the creatures of eternal ban
Praise the beast of wickedness
Born in twilight haze
Doomed to put my life in devil's hand
I'm prepared to die.
