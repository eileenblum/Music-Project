Smashing through the walls of insanity
Blood will follow blood tonight
The expiration of human race
A force too strong to fight
Drifting into depths of your ignorance
Where all life will end in pain
To persecute the liberty
Your torment leads my way.

Don't trust me in the night
Your mind I'm holding tight
Accept the end is near
Now tremble in your fear
Fight for revenge 
You've gazed into the face of evil
Reborn into disgrace
The mystery of poisoned blackness
When blood from heaven rains
Retribution for the dead.

You'll not return, you can't stay alive
Death can never be explained
Eradication, the hell on earth
Extreme and unrestrained
Desolating troops of atrocity
Unrelenting forces arise
There is no faith, just demented lust
Dark pleasures in your eyes.

No one will hear your screams
No hoping for relief
Don't try to stop me now
Your soul I'm taking down.

Rise from the dead
You've gazed into the face of evil
Reborn onto this place
Supremacy of lords in Hades
Where angels lie decayed
On your way to hell and back.

Smashing through the walls of insanity
Blood will follow blood tonight
Immortal hate, I feel for you
A force too strong to fight
Desolating troops of atrocity
Unrelenting forces arise
Undying spite, too late to pray
The truth about your lies.

Your dying consciously
Lay down your dignity
Why should I take the blame
Beware my deadly chase.

Child of the damned 
To stare into the face of evil
Your wish is my command
The misery of poisoned blackness
Await the promised land
I have nothing to regret.
