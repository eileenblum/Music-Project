We leave a trail of agonizing death
Deliver us to evil, Satan's taking your breath
Reign of devastation will begin
You cannot save your lives, no way to win
Terrible assassins raze the light
Mayhem and brutality, the reason we fight
Incarnate the pervading sound of pain
From the depths of horrible domain.

Losing your control, all dressed in black
Pentagrams, inverted crosses, thrashing attack
Blasting Metal fills the air with blood
Demons sent the beast to rip your god
Clashing blades of axes, frightening storms
We don't need the fuckin' bastard with the crown of thorns
Nothing has the chance to break the spell
United Metal Maniacs from hell.

Run for your lives 
Bestial aggressions, the strongest survive
Tearing and murdering, when evil's born
Warfare
Run for your lives, haunting Metal tonight .

Haunting Metal, haunting Metal !

We share the same old legacy
We're bonded by our destiny
The cradle of the true underground
Blasphemic dark destructive sound.

Blessed are the warriors of death
Deliver us to evil, and you will never rest
Violence is growing in your eyes 
Infernally monstrosity arrives
Spirit of damnation fills your veins
Raising hands of wickedness, attraction remains
Nothing has the chance to break the spell
United Metal Maniacs from hell.

Run for your lives
Forces of evil, the devil arise
killing and banging, the lourder you scream
Hellhounds
Run for your lives, haunting Metal tonight.

Haunting Metal, haunting Metal.
