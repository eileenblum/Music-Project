Merciless, hail the powers of evil
Slowly, theyâre crawling in the night
Endless war, ripping mights of Hades
Beneath the smoke they rise
There is a giant kingdom
Where the lord of darkness waits
Donât forget, there is no tomorrow
Beyond the seven gates.

Can you feel the heat
Diabolic things across your way
God, you have to leave
Down below into the world of rage
Lost, beyond the bridge of death
Pain is real, all you feel
Lost in blackful emptiness
Lifeâs so far, fear the dark.

Taste the flesh and blood of the dead
Roasted in the crypts of hell
Terror strikes, meet the scum
You canât escape the masterâs spell
My mind is burnt, infinite horror
Spreading suffering through the land
The world you know, youâll never see
Tortured without end.

Curse my soul tonight
Only you remember screams of fear
All the dreams you dread
Holy water turns to bloody tears.

Lost beyond the bridge of death
Pain is real, blood and steel
Lost in blackful emptiness
Lifeâs so far, fear the dark.

Rot, bleed in endless pain
Creeping demons steal the light
Feel hate, destroying lust
Sadness turns the wheel of time.

You have to pay the devilâs guardian
Addicted for the purest blood
Before you cross the bridge of abyss
Deny the reign of God.

Lost, beyond the bridge of death
War and fright, fill the night
Lost in blackful emptiness
Lifeâs so far, fear the dark.

Beyond the Bridge of Death
