Eternally damnation
When the heavenâs painted black
Contracted by your life and blood
Malevolent attack
Convicted morbid soldiers
Satanâs knights will come
Infernal slaves of cruel desire
Beware and start to run.

Burning into fire
Holy sickness is what you pray
Tormented preaches kiss their cross
But they cannot steal away
Godforsaken victims
Blasted to the holes of death
Satanâs curse embrace your soul
And this day will be your last.

I have seen pure madness, trapped in hell
There is a land, where unleashed demons dwell
Sacrifice your blood, keep me insane
Grasping to believe this game.

Authorized to kill and rape
Terrible sadistic fate
Dominate for endless times
Storming in my mind.
