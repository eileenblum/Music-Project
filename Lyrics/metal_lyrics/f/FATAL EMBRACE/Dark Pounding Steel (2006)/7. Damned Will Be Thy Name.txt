Dark obsession in my mind
Voices of sadistic kind
Can you hear the scream in me
Shadows of insanity
Cannot leave this world alive
I was born to bring demise
Controlled by a sinful brain
Damned will be thy name.

Aggression, possession
The longing you to kill
Give me your life, a human life
The prophecy to fill.

Paranoid tendencies
Live and reign inside of me
Hungry for the smell of death
Twisted memories of past
I am here to terminate
My desire your life to take
Let me satisfy my drives
Feel pain as you die.

Aggression, possession
The longing you to kill
Give me your life, a human life
The prophecy to fill.

Aggression, possession
The longing you to kill
Give me your life, a human life
The prophecy to fill.
