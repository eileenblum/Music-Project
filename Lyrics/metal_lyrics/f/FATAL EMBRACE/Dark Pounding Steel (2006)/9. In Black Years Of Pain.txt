There is no existence
Coldness fills all your mind
Endure inhuman pressure
Creeping fear in your eyes
Voices speak predictions of pain
Emptinessâs ruling my brain
Holy words here never youâve found
No one escapes the underground.

Your soulâs walking restless
Damned to live, born to die
Death, come and free me
From the chains of my life
Running through the endless disgrace
Freezing blood will grow in my veins
I canât kill the evil inside
To be a slave of Satanâs might.

Twisting all dimensions
Now follow me to hell
Your concentration starts to break
Thereâs no way to repel
Trapped in violent hatred
Gripped by forces of your fear
Constructors of frustration
Will destroy you and appear.

Await the final hour
Until I know youâre mine
Insanity is all you get
And the day has lost the light
My resolution
Donât restart my breath
Afraid to walk the streets of blood
Where the victims fall in death.

No resurrection, no heal in sight
No satisfaction, no peace of mind
There is no choice and Iâm racing down
In heaven or in underground.

Break, fight, burn, cry
Set me free in black years of painâ¦
In black years of pain.
