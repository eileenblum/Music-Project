Weâre marching from dungeons of fire
A place where the blackness descends
Possessed by the wicked dark magical night
Destroying and raping again
Praise our lords of salvation
Blessing the majestic beast
Itâs time for the sound, iron demons fly free
To bring the massacre you need.

Welcome the warriors of darkness
A pleasure to see all the friends
Created by evil, bloodhunting begins
The devil is leading your hands
Living your life, keep the madness
Protectors of unbroken dreams
Weâll never betray or forget our roots
Now give us your metalized screams.

Dark, Dark Pounding Steel.

The night is over, the dark has gone
Warmasterâs legions, their work is done
The time will come of my return
See you in hell
Dark Pounding Steel.
