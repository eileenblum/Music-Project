What have you done, what have you made
You formed a nightmare of disaster and hate
Humanity has broken and lost
Destruction rules the time
Hypnotic words, the spike of distress
The incarnation of the radical death
Leave me alone, prepared to die
For you blasphemic assault.

Kill, destroy, decay
Assassination
Rape, attack, betray
Assassination
When tyrants lead the endless war
Tremendous senseless massacre
No human being has seen before
When the doomsday has returned.

I see the lights, fallen on earth
No way for me to live my rebirth
Their only pleasure, spreading the pain
The breeder of disease 
No one can help to keep us alive
I curse the day, when the slaughter arrived
Beware the time, when the killing goes on
And the blasphemic assault.

Kill, destroy, decay
Assassination
Rape, attack, betray
Assassination
When tyrants lead the endless war
Tremendous senseless massacre
No human being has seen before
When the doomsday has returned.

Cruelty
Killed the innocence of life
Deity
Fallen down into the night
Endlessly
Malicious demons shall arise
Flames burn my skin.

Follow the magic call
Here is no place for love
Deathâs glowing in my eyes
My pain to realize
There is no chance to pray
Disguise you own dismay
No freedom in my sight
Itâs time to say good bay.

Kill, destroy, decay
Assassination
Rape, attack, betray
Assassination
You will not survive
Assassination
Close your eyes and die
Assassination
