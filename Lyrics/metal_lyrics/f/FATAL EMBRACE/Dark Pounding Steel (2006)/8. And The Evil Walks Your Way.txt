You know Iâm coming back
Your soul it shall be mine
Prepare for my attack
I wear the devilish sign
And the evil walks your way.

I am your destination
Your hate inside
I have no name, you feel the same
Time after time
Your fear is my desire
Come, set me free
I have no face, reborn to raise
Out of the night.

No coracao do morte
Aspira a ultima vez
O corpo ja disolvendo
Confessa as pecas tu fez
(Spoken by Harris Johns).

Come through the gates of madness
Immortal ways
Onto your knees, all you can see
Death has arrived
Walk down the stairs of wicked
Blood guides your steps
Reborn to reign, eternal pain
Blinding your eyes.

Welcome to your hell
Youâre running through the night
Where hordes of torment dwell
And fires burning bright
I just exist your life to rape.

You know Iâm coming back
Your soul it shall be mine
Prepare for my attack
I wear the devilish sign
And the evil walks your way.

My pleasure is your pain
Come, satisfy my lust
Your agonyâs my fame
When you will burn to dust
Before you die youâll not awake.

The hell in which you live
A place of blackened hearts
Your life you have to give
The master of the dark
And the evil walks your way.

I am your destination
Your hate inside
I have no name, you feel the same
Time after time
Your fear is my desire
Come, set me free
And the evil walks your way.
