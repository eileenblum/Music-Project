The world is turning back
Timeâs standing still
And reaperâs demons riding down to kill
When ancient rites come true
Lifeâs far away
Donât pray for me
In agony Iâll wake
Die.

Whatâs gone through me and what has touched me
Whatâs growing deep inside
Feel oppressions, feeling sorrow
The guilt to be alive
Trying to find the delivering answer
Why the masterâs calling me
No screams for mercy, into the fires
Iâll meet my destiny.

My blood, my mind, my fate
Donât sacrifice my soul.

Ripping, breaking, devastating
My powers fade away
Deformation, mutilation
Transforming and decay
Constrained to die, repeat my last words
Sadistic games youâll see
No way to exit, the deals of suffering
Will made eternally.

He comes, to take, my life
Donât sacrifice my soul.

Oh God, help me, to survive
Donât sacrifice my soul.
