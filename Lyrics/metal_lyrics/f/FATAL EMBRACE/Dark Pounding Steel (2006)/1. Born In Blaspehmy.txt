Feel the power, hear the sound
Eyes of horror walking around
Our symbol stands for death
Hammerblows deform your neck
Hellish demons fill the night
Evil lightnings shinning so bright
You are dancing in the flames of hell
Black emperors ring the bell.

Bang your heads till you bleed
Pounding Metal dying in speed
In the sign of our pentagram
Magic darkness fought and won
Black immortal inverted cross
Crushing chaos, heaven is lost
We play for die hard Metalmaniacs
Satanic thrashing war attack.

Weâre born to live in blasphemy
Bonded by sins
Extreme Metal is our life.

Support and fight for the underground
Metal forces destroying your town
Diving crowd in violent front
Mayhemic  wildnessâs what you want
Moshing people, side by side
Banging legions, leather and spikes
We kill all posers, shit on trends
Love Hell Awaits and Darkness Descends.

Weâre born to live in blasphemy
Bonded by sins
Extreme Metal is our life.
