And now your life it subsides
Falls from beneath you
The moments of the past
Forget tomorrow it brings anew

See the love that you bring
Takes you to where, you're going on
Run, don't hide yourself
It's only fading moments
If you could see

It's for the taking my friend
The eternal end, it's for you
The past is overboard
Don't worry your soul, it's in never land

See the love that you bring
Takes you to where, you're going on
Run, don't hide yourself
It's only fading moments
If you could see

Darkness unfolds as stories
Are told of new beginnings
Things don't look so bright
The sun hits the eyes of the seedling

See the love that you bring
Takes you to where, you're going on
Run, don't hide yourself
It's only fading moments
If you could see

But who's to blame for it all
All of the questions unsolved
Capsized your voyage of dreams
They'll right you off as dead, never seen

See the love that you bring
Takes you to where, you're going on
Run, don't hide yourself
It's only fading moments
If you could see

See the love that you bring
Takes you to where, you're going on
Run, don't hide yourself
It's only fading moments
If you could see

And now your life it subsides
Falls from beneath you
The moments of the past
Forget tomorrow it brings anew
My friend
