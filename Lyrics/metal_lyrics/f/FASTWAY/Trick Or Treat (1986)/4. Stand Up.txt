I've got something to tell you
Something you can't deny
I've taken all that you've given
I've had it up to my eye

Can't feel the hunger
Feel that you can't go on now
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And now I feel it
Burnin' deep inside
I've got a lot of good reasons
Of the mysterious mind

Can't feel the hunger
Feel that you can't go on now
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far

Can't hold on, can't hold on
Gonna rock it up tonight
Let it roll now, let it go now
Let it loose tonight, whoa

Can't feel the hunger
Feel that you can't go on now
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Stand up and be counted
