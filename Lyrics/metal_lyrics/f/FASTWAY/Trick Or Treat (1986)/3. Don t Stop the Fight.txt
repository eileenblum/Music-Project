Emergency, emergency
Heat is on and burning me
Superstitions in my mind
Over and over losing time

Sometimes you feel so far away
Sometimes it gets so hard to say

Don't stop the fight - don't die now
Don't stop the fight - don't die now

The pressures keep on rising
Every night a crazy dream
I've been hurting, no one knows through it
All the pain still grows

Sometimes you feel so far away
Sometimes it gets so hard to say

Don't stop the fight - don't die now
Don't stop the fight - don't die now

He was a rotten boy, he never likes being kicked around (no good)
He was a foolish boy, don't ask me why
But he could steal your heart away

Sometimes you feel so far away
Sometimes it gets so hard to say

Don't stop the fight - don't die now
Don't stop the fight - don't die now
