Yeah!

You'd better run
It's a hurricane on fire
Nowhere to hide
Gonna hunt you through the night, yeah

You got it, I want it
Pretty soon he's gonna change his tune now
So keep knockin', keep rockin'
I got to, I got to hear you scream

I'm gonna get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you 'til the sparks fly
Get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you 'til the sparks fly

Trouble, like you've never had before
Gotta pull the trigger, gonna justify the score

You got it, I want it
Pretty soon he's gonna change his tune now
So keep knockin', keep rockin'
I got to, I got to hear you scream

I'm gonna get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you 'til the sparks fly
Get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you 'til the sparks fly
Shock you 'til the sparks fly, sparks fly

So keep knockin', keep rockin'
I got to, I got to hear you scream
I'm gonna get you, that's right now
Just watch me, ha

I'm gonna get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you 'til the sparks fly
Get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you 'til the sparks fly
