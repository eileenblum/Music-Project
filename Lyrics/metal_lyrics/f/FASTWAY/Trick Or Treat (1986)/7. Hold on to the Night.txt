Ow
He's got a style, got no soul
He's got everything that a man could want from rock 'n' roll
He's got love, all he needs
And he can grip you by the throat
And you know he's going to make you bleed

Taking off down the road, alright now
Every which way we will go

He's got a knife in your back
And you never know the turn but you know you're off the track
Steely eyes, cold and blue
Thought you cannot hide the way
But you know he's going to get to you

Taking off down the road, alright now
Every which way we will go
Hold on to the night
Hold on to the night
Come on down lad
Hold on to the night
In this crazy heat
There's a stranger on the road, yeah

Well, he's got a style, got no soul
He's got everything that a man could want from rock 'n' roll
He's got a knife in your back
And you never know the turn but you know you're off the track
Watch out!

Taking off down the road, alright now
Every which way we will go
Hold on to the night
Come on down lad
Hold on to the night [14x]
