Suddenly everything's alright
Everything is cool
Hey dudes I like your style
It's the way it should

Maybe you'll see
Someone's put a spell on me

Rock 'n' roll
Rockin' on a midnight
Steal your soul
Rock 'n' roll
Rockin' on a midnight
Take control

Knock, knock, knockin' for a sweet surprise
It's a trick or treat
See my face true up in the skies
If ever we should meet

Maybe you'll see
Someone's put a spell on me

Rock 'n' roll
Rockin' on a midnight
Steal your soul
Rock 'n' roll
Rockin' on a midnight
Take control

So let's rock
Rock, rock
Rock, rock

Rock 'n' roll
Rockin' on a midnight
Steal your soul
Rock 'n' roll
Rockin' on a midnight
Take control
Rock 'n' roll
Rockin' on a midnight
Steal your soul
Rock 'n' roll
Rockin' on a midnight
Take control

We're gonna rock it on down!
