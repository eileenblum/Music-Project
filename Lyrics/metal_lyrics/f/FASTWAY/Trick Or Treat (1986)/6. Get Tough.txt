In the eve of the night, get out a sight
You're on the run, but where to fight?
His stupid games shall be insane
The time is coming for dealing the same

Get tough!
This boy's had enough
It's time to get tough!
This boy's had enough

Deadly they are sleeping
He knows the meaning
You're living sights on bearling way
No hold the back
They're on your tracks
Now you're the one and steal the heal
'Cause anybody know what's going on
'Cause anybody care

Get tough!
This boy's had enough
It's time to get tough!
This boy's had enough

I'm deal a light
Stand up and fight
'Cause I'm a rock 'n' roller
I'll take what I need
Leaving some please
Hold on now
Hold on now, yeah

Get tough!
This boy's had enough
It's time to get tough!
This boy's had enough
