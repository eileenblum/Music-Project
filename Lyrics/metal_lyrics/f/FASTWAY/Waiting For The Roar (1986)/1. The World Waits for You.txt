Look around see it all
Small town boy looking for more
Is it all too far beyond the dream?

Yesterday was dead and gone
Will tomorrow shine at all?
You will go as far as you believe

The world waits for you
And I know so long as it's true
You can find your place inside yourself
The world waits for you
And I know so long as it's true
You can feel the fire inside you burn

Now you see the challenge rise
Victory holds the prize
Who will know the price you had to pay?
Face to face with eager eyes
Your only dream has now arrived
Now it's up to you to break away...

The world waits for you
And I know so long as it's true
You can find your place inside yourself
The world waits for you
And I know so long as it's true
You can feel the fire inside you burn

Take it all, take it away
We sacrifice to yesterday, win or loose
I've nothing to hide
I feel the fire still burning inside
Still burning inside of me

The world waits for you
And I know so long as it's true
You can find your place inside yourself
The world waits for you
And I know so long as it's true
You can feel the fire inside you burn
