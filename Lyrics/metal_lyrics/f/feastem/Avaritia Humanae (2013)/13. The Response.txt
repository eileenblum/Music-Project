In times of grief and crisis
Fools raping famished lands
Eyes turned skyward in terror
Their despair met with rejection

When your cries go unheard
And darkness falls
You will find you've been lied to
And you will find it on your knees

Engulfed by the great lie
Great campaign of corruption
Fanatic will to achieve
a world built on hypocrisy

When all hope has run dry
and darkness falls
You will find no response from the divine
and you will find this on your knees

Where will you be
What will you do
What's going to be
Your response
