The church separates man from God
Man must separate himself from the church
Separate the church from the state
Abandon ship before it's too late

Turn your backs on religious bullshit
Those who believe, they don't need it

Abandon the church
Release your chains
Step into the light
From the dark age

HerÃ¤tkÃ¤Ã¤!
