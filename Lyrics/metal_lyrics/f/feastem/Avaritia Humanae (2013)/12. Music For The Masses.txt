Everything built to meet
The lowest common denominator
"It's all the people need"
We are the vulgar fraction

The market and the media
Afraid to reveal the cornucopia
The diversity of sounds
lest they be abandoned
by their go(l)d and profit

You drain the soul from what we love
Produce bulk for drooling masses
This may not have the commercial appeal
But at least it has the heart
