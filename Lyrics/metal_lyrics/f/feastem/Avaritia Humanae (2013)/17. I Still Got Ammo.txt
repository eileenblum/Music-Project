Woke up ths morning
Grabbed my trusted gun
Been holed up for days in here
I guess I was left behind

The last of my kind
Trapped in a corner
Come on you bastards
I still got ammo

Supplies are running low
Starvation looming near
So I burst open the door
And welcome what's waiting

There they lurk
The undead in blue
They still think they run this show
But I still got ammo
