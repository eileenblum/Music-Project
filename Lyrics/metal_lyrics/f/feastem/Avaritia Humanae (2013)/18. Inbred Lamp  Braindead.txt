Somewhere behind God's back
Or in an upper class home
Raised among your own
The only way you know

Outside your own circle
Everyone's an enemy
Outside your frame of mind
Everyone deserves to die

Defend your territory
You're a goddamn hero
The voice of many
The blind shepherd

Defend your territory
You're a goddamn hero
Outside your frame of mind
Everyone deserves to die

Inbred
Braindead
