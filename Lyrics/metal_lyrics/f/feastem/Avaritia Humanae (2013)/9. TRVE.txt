Kicked around, you've lost direction
Found comfort in just another faction
Immerse yourself in nihility
It's just another form of apathy

A coward king wearing a fake harness
A true warrior, fearless and bold
I fail to see the point but I guess
I'm just too old, too cold

You preach of blind ideals
of faith unbreakable, so strong
It's in this rigid faith in your own words
where you go so very wrong

Close your eyes from reality
Bury your head where it's nice and dark
Grab your sword and fight back
In dreams we escape this world so stark

Satan!
