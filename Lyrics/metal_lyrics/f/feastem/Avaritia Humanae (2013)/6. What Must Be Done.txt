I only have hate in my mind
Enough spite for all mankind
Everywhere I look, everything I see
The world turning into an atrocity

I know what must be done
A full-scale killing spree
A higher state of mind
I shall set the world free

I'll strike with anything I can
or with my bare hands alone
Never has a man been this sane
I'm bringing redemption again
