A row of red brick houses
One after another
Fit to form, belong

Matching clothes and hairstyles
Identical cars and gardens
Fit to form, belong

Don't stand out from your neighbors
Five million flies can't be wrong
Fit to form, belong

Be born, get educated
Hate your work
Die with regret
