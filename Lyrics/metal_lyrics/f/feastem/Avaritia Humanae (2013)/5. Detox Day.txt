Cold sweat flows
Trembling hands
Afraid of people
Shadow of a man
The higher you get
The harder the fall
One more could be
The end of all

I have to stop
Before it's too late
Suffer the horror and pain
Of detox day

Midnight strikes
Can't hold back
Time to ease the pain
Another relapse
24 hours of suffering
Might be weeks
Until I try again
