[performed by Feastem]Our public playground 
Ruled by the strongest gang 
Authority by force 
Respect the hierarchy 
Respect the power of the few 
Join them or get beaten 
It's just child's play 
King of the hill 
It's just child's play 
No one to turn to 
They are the law and order 
Exercise violence by will 
No reason is needed 
For a show of power 
Keep them quiet and afraid
