[performed by Feastem]A world filled with suffering 
Tied hands, stifled minds 
The vice grip of guns and poison 
Brutal means to mass control 
Stripped of what 
Makes us human 
Hand in hand 
With death we march 
Bells of the end start sounding 
And we bow our heads 
To their hollow toll 
You can take it 
You can keep it 
I do not want it 
Your world depraved 
Stand up tall, fellow men 
Sabotage the great machine 
For we must let them know 
We will avenge our dead 
We will rise
