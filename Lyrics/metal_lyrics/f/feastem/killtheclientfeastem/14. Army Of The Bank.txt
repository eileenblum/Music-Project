[performed by Feastem]Army of the bank 
Bullets made of gold 
Shoots you silent when 
You throw rocks at the throne 
Human pesticide 
Sprayed everywhere to our ears 
Welfare suicide 
Plan to multiply all our fears 
Your blood signed on a sheet 
Plan to eradicate 
With sharp teeth 
Under the firelit sky 
The gold dust that we breathe
