[performed by Feastem]Uncontrolled bursts of rage 
An inner head transplant 
A headless roach can live 
for nine days but you can't 

As it grows ever higher 
The process to process gets harder 
The list never ends 
Only targets change 
The list never ends 
Face it again 

Head overloading, want it or not 
Individual limit is your burden 

Head is sore 
pain in the gut 
Again a new scandal 
again a new bargain 

The list is never finished
