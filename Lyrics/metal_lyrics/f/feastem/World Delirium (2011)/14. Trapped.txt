Physical form breaks down
Inner self explodes
In a tornado of soul shrapnel
Vibrating particles
Like glass in the wind
The universe pierces every nuclei
And the body melts away
Trapped in
Eternal
Singularity
Floating
Motionless
Into the
Ever-expanding
Total assimilation
Locked in every drop of air
In this loss of control
The soul finally rests
