Nicaea, fourth century
A pagan emperor compiles
A book of stories fit
To strengthen his empire
Twenty-first century Earth
The same story-book
Is taught as the only truth
To our children in schools
Control through fear
Mind games and shame
Justification for all atrocities
Done in God's name
Try this on for size
You weren't the first Earth-born
To look at the stars and ask
Where did all this come from
So many have had to die
It's sick what people will buy
Millions living by
The 1700-year-old lie
Lie!
Control through fear
Mind games and shame
Atrocities done in God's name
