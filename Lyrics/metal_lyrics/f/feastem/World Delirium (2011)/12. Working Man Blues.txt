Day in, day out
Working like a slave
Punching the clock
Shit-eating grin on his face
"There will be a day"
He said to himself
"That the tide will turn
And I'll be the one
Serving the coldest plates"
Hatred builds up inside
Fills his heart with rage
Set controls to annihilate
Time for revenge has arrived
"Little did I know"
He pondered as he raised his hand
"That it would begin like this"
But as his fist went down
Again and again
He knew for sure
How it was going to end
