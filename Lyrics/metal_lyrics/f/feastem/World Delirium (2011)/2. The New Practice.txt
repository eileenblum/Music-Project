Circle closing in
Mandatory repeat every year
Will I get my eviction notice
From all this that is us
This is the new practice
That everyone will face
This is the new practice
That everyone will face
That everyone will go through
Wrapped in my own
Wall-to-wall carpeting
Overwhelming head count
Waiting for the next
Random hit and run
For those close
For those real close
For those close
For those too close
