God's perfect creation
Almost a god yourself
You have the power to condemn
To send us all to Hell
We all know next to nothing
Yet you still know it all
The god of your own small world
Your way is the only way
Sins of the fathers
Cannot be undone
God's favorite child
Treading a bloodied path
Lost in the land of nothing
A world devoid of hope
Pray for remission
Justice will be done
There's always more points of view
It doesn't kill to try something new
Do what thou wilt to each his own
You fucking narrow-minded hypocrite whores!
We all know next to nothing
Still you know it all
The god of your own small world
God's perfect creation
