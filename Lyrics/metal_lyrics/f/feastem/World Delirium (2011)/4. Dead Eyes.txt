The cure and the disease
Feeding on each other
Fueling depression
Resistance is futile
Meaningless days
Pile upon each other
Always sinking deeper
Away from freedom
From the maelstrom of wasted time
Comes a thing with hungry eyes
He shows me
What I never want to be
Offering a way out
But his freedom is a lie
They are all its slaves
Robots with dead eyes
Capture din his chains
Fallen victim to his lies
