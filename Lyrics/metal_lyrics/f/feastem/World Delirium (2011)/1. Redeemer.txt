I am here to purge the Earth
My heart as cold as my soul is black
My hands as tools of cleansing
My hate is not blind
My hate never blind
I will wash the streets with blood
Rid the world of the greatest scum
I am here to cure the disease
No remorse, I am the redeemer
No remorse
I am disgusted again and again
By the filth spewed forth by mankind
Derailed and self-absorbed
The only way is down
