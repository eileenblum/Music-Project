Shudder and cringe
Standing along the line where
Gate fallows us
And I unfold
Gave in to his young greed
Fascinated by material
To the point where we
Don't hesitate to squeal
Cry out to the walls
Primed, brave bastards sluts who
Blind-folded infer
And judge me
Now is your chance to be raw!
Squeal!
