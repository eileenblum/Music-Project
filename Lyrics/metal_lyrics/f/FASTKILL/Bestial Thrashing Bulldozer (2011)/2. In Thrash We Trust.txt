Energy! - Devotion like a suicide
Aggression! - With my body and soul
Speed kills! - Faster than hell
Violence! - Kill or be killed

Chainsaw crunches like a killing machine
Bombardment with outrage
Battery that nobody can stop
Ripping vomit shreds raining blood

We don't care about you
We don't need fame
We do what we trust
No matter what

Blowing off your ears
Cutting your throats
Ripping your brains
Kill all posers

Possessed by evil speed
It's pleasure to kill
Make me feel the rage - In thrash!

Flesh roars for fight
Keep the faith
Take no prisoners - We trust!

Blowing off your ears
Cutting your throats
Ripping your brains
Kill all posers

Possessed by evil speed
It's pleasure to kill
Make me feel the rage - In thrash!

Flesh roars for fight
Keep the faith
Take no prisoners - We trust!

In thrash we trust!

Bang your head till the death
Or waste your life
Kamikaze stage diving
Sick as hell
