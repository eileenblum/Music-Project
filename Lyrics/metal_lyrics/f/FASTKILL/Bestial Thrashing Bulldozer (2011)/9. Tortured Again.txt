Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I want to scream
I hold my breath as I wish for death
Never hunger, never prosper, all is ruin

Push matter extreme
Ruled by insanity
The first time I've tasted blood
After the extreme torture

Terrible pain in their faces
Vicious expression of purest hate
Hollow you dig your own grave
You'll hear me laughing when I go

Push matter extreme
Ruled by insanity
The first time I've tasted blood
After the extreme torture

Death and destruction rule on this planet
You know life is valid for a limited time
You live with idea to die
This is not place of mercy

Deafening, painstaking - Tortured again!
Opposition, violation - Tortured again!
Termination, consolation - Tortured again!
Persecution, suspicion - Tortured again!
Terror, tension, life, death - Tortured again!
Hate, pain, nevermore - Tortured again!
Taken my arms, taken my legs - Tortured again!
I cannot live, I can die - Tortured again!

Deafening, painstaking - Tortured again!
Opposition, violation - Tortured again!
Termination, consolation - Tortured again!
Persecution, suspicion - Tortured again!
Terror, tension, life, death - Tortured again!
Hate, pain, nevermore - Tortured again!
Taken my arms, taken my legs - Tortured again!
I cannot live, I can die - Tortured again!

Tortured again!
Again!
