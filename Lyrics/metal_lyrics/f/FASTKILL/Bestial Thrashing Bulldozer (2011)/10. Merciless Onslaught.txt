Breaking up the cold night
Terrifying noise penetrating silent air
There's nowhere to run or escape
Once it has appeared

Frightening figure representing signs of doom
Spreading stench all around
There's no way to flee or hide
Once you're marked

It's clear that the end is near
There is no savior nor favor
Once you've confronted
This total devastation

Furious rage swallowing everything
Breaking all to total ruin
Nothing's left after it has passed
As if nothing ever existed

Wreck and ruin unleashed upon us
Victims piling up everywhere
This is the moment you wish
That you'd never been born

It is clear that the end is near
There is no savior nor favor
Once you've encountered
This bloody annihilation

Merciless onslaught
Blood surging from hell
Merciless onslaught

Look out!
The terror's coming for you without mercy

Fall apart!
Once it's cleared
There's nothing against this invasion

Merciless onslaught
Fatal strike from below
Merciless onslaught

Nothing can stop it once it's out
Nothing can protect you from this

It's clear that the end is near
There is no savior nor favor
Once you've confronted
This deadly aggression

Abyss of hell
Endless pain
Total death

[...]

Merciless, merciless onslaught!
