I've come from hell for killing in the night
I am a killing machine with hateful eyes

Evil blood inside me wants me to kill
Nobody can stop me - You all gonna die!

When I taste blood for the first time
Madness of the destruction is what I become

Toxic tormentor

The stench of death
I'm thirsty for fresh blood
I'll kill to the last man
It's too late to run
I'll give you pain and suffering
You've never had
I tear your flesh to shreds
Show you no mercy!

When I taste blood for the first time
Madness of the destruction is what I become

Die!

I'll chase you anywhere you go
Blood spills everywhere will flow
Brutal killings for pleasure
Beginning of endless torture

Stabbings with my sword
Painful screams in the darkness
I seek bestial pleasure
It's only way to satisfy my desire

I've come from hell for killing in the night
I am a killing machine with hateful eyes
Evil blood inside me wants me to kill
Nobody can stop me - You all gonna die!

When I taste blood for the first time
Madness of the destruction is what I become

Die!
