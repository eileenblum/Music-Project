Your agonizing screams are echoing in hell
Pain, torture, misery and no one to tell
Reality is dark, your lies you can't sell
Your days are numbered, you are burning in hell

The pain you feel is true, is real
It's there to stay your future is sealed
Fire will eat you so you better say your pray
Nothing is there to save you, you gonna die in pain

This pain is real
You can't ignore it
Die in the pentagram

Nailed to the cross in circle of hell
Destined to die in blood thirsty flames
Sacrificed for the fallen angels
This is the funeral for your death

The pain you feel is true, is real
It's there to stay your future is sealed
Fire will eat you so you better say your pray
Nothing is there to save you, you gonna die in pain

This pain is real
You can't ignore it
Die in the pentagram

Countdown to your execution
Dripping blood is feeding the harrowing flames
Go to hell with your rotting flesh shackled
The death ravens can't wait you to die

Countdown to your execution
Dripping blood is feeding the harrowing flames
Go to hell with your rotting flesh shackled
The death ravens can't wait you to die

This pain is real
You can't ignore it
Face the pain, take the pain
And die in the pentagram

This pain is real
You can't ignore it
Face the pain, take the pain
And die in the pentagram
