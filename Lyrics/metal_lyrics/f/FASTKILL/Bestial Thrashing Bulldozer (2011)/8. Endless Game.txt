[originally by Negarobo]Our life is like puppet show
We are living like marionette

A bright idea occurred her
She's the decider. The destinies.

Maybe we had to decide
Between obey and die
It was fated we should
Become her own puppets

No way! Too late!
But we don't know the facts
No way! (No way!) Too late! (Too late!)
But we don't know the facts
No way! (No way!) Too late! (Too late!)
But we don't know the facts
Endless game

We're playing the part of us
Birth, growth and love, in her way
We're playing the part of us
Birth, growth and love, in her way

Maybe we had to decide
Between obey and die
It was fated we should
Become her own puppets

No way! Too late!
But we don't know the facts
No way! (No way!) Too late! (Too late!)
But we don't know the facts
No way! (No way!) Too late! (Too late!)
But we don't know the facts

Our life is like puppet show
We are living in her game
