Massive crowds of people are waiting
Eager to see you die
Sun is going down, silence is spreading
Bells are tolling the time has come

Total darkness is upon us
Your existence will cease to exist
Meet your future, meet your fate
You'll be judged by guillotine blade

You're full of arrogance and deceptions
Everyone's sick of all your lies
This is the place where your body will stay
You won't live to see another day

Bloody slaughter
Guillotine attack

The final thirteen steps to death
There is no escape
Prolonged fear of suffering
Enough time to repent

Total darkness is upon us
Your existence will cease to exist
Meet your future, meet your fate
You'll be judged by guillotine blade

You're full of arrogance and deceptions
Everyone's sick of all your lies
This is the place where your body will stay
You won't live to see another day

Bloody slaughter
Guillotine attack
Endless torture
Guillotine attack

When I release this blade
It will cut your neck faster
Severing your head from your body
Your blood will spill all around

Your eyes will be watching crowd
As it's catching your falling head
This is the end of the reign of terror
Headless body can't tell lies

Massive crowds of people are waiting
Eager to see you die
Sun is going down, silence is spreading
Bells are tolling the time has come

Total darkness is upon us
Your existence will cease to exist
Meet your future, meet your fate
You'll be judged by guillotine blade

Bloody slaughter
Guillotine attack
Endless torture
Guillotine attack

Bloody slaughter
Endless torture
Guillotine attack

Attack!
