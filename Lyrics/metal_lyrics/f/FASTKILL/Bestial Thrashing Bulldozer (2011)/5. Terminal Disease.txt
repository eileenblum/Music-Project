No shape, no form, no brain, no mind
God's pleasure is my pain, an invisible force
The kingdom of salvation can't take me home
Curse the gods and virgin Mary's death
Abandoned by the gods, only death decides

Thrashed, beaten, sodomized
Don't need a reason Satan's come
Believer, messiah and any gods
Freedom is totally fake

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
Nothing can save us
Curse the gods, hate the gods
Messiah will never come
Find it so grim, so true, so real
So real

No shape, no form, no brain, no mind
Root of all my pain is hope for the gods
Justice is lost and sun is dark as coal
Lady justice has been thrashed
See our mother, put to death
See our mother die

Thrashed, beaten, sodomized
Don't need a reason Satan's come
Believer, messiah and any gods
Freedom is totally fake

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
Nothing can save us
Curse the gods, hate the gods
Messiah will never come
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Hate!
Religions and rituals are fake
No heaven will ever save it
God sent corrupt saints
Justice is terminal disease

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty is to blame
Put dignity to shame... dishonor
A mass hysteria, a megalomania
Reveal dementia... reveal

Thrashed, beaten, sodomized
Don't need a reason Satan's come
Believer, messiah and any gods
Freedom is totally fake

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
Nothing can save us
Curse the gods, hate the gods
Messiah will never come
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Hate!
Religions and rituals are fake
No heaven will ever save it
God sent corrupt saints
Justice is terminal disease

Hate!
Religions and rituals are fake
No heaven will ever save it

Justice is terminal disease

Disease!
