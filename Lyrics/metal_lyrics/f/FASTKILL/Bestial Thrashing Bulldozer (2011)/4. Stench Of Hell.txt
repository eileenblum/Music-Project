My mind set to kill
Life of pain, through trails your fate
Suffering the fear of pain
I was born for rotting

Die painful, die slowly
Body cold I pound away
Kill your mind, kill for pleasure
Kill for fun, kill for Satan

I will kill if you need
You left me in awake
Skull cut in two
This killing fascination

I will kill if you need
You left me in awake
Skull cut in two
Individual kill

Satan comes for your death
No way out, scatter, splatter
In the dark, bring the pain
Stench of hell, left your despair

Cold death awaits you now
Next time that you fall asleep
Pain, insane, eternally
You'll open your rotting casket

I will kill if you need
You left me in awake
Skull cut in two
This killing fascination

I will kill if you need
You left me in awake
Skull cut in two
Individual kill

It's time to kill
Total death
Smell of death
Bloody death
Killed by death

Screaming in pain
Die in pain
Endless pain
Kill again
Your life will end

It's time to kill
Total death
Smell of death
Bloody death
Killed by death

Screaming in pain
Die in pain
Endless pain
Kill again
Your life will end

Stench of hell
In the night
Kill after dead
Time to kill
Sodomized to cross
God torment
I will kill
Calling flesh

Stench of hell
In your fate
Kill after dead
Time for you
I cut your throat
Full of blood
Living hell, never back again

I killed the first to experiment
Ruptured flesh ripped through the neck
Feel the pain scream out for death
Torture chamber, hell brings eternal pain
Stench of hell
