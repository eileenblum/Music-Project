I shall redeem myself from the clutch that grasp at my inner self
Looking inside your future uncertain
The fear grows as a sickness uncured

Sickness! Uncertain of being back
Sickness! Time of insane
Sickness! Thatâs about to die
Sickness! A life of intercourse and lust

The tears in your eyes as red as blood
To suffer alone in disgrace
Rotting skinny corpse left alone
Dream of dissipation

A sudden inspiration a feeling so strong
Your life is not worth a day
Destroyed and defiled as on a proving ground
Infected pain, dead awaits

Creatures fucked by a greedy pat
The first time Iâve taste blood
Saw the rampant mainstream dying off
Remember the atrocities

Eat me: come on my taste to satisfy my fucking pride
Call me: do the cannibal for me, eat me, call me, hate me

Under the scale of secrecy
Nobody will come to know the truth
Impure with impeccability
Heinous deeds coming soon
