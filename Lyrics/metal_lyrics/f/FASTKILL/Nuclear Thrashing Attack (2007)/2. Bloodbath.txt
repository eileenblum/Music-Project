I've come to kill you
watch you die in pain
I'm possessed by death
worshiping evil
conceived to kill
living just to die
I feel the end has begun

My face shows no emotion

The mind of an animal behind human eyes
death on death makes the world go around
I'll kill till I die

Your blood spills everywhere
and it pours as rain
death and torture is my game
I'll just kill again

Bullet holes through flesh and bone

The face half-rotted off
human flesh feeding frenzy
destroy till there is no more
the darkness breeds violent sights
indiscriminate acts of mass murder
horrifying hell, terryfying death
in's you who's next to die

Bloodbath

Hallucination, annihilation
irresponsible atrocity
termination
this mortal life plunges
into the pandemonium
violation, destruction, execution
no way to survive
