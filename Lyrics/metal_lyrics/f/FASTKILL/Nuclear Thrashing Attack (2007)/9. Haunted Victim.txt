Twisted brain decays
Abstract world of pain
Anguished mind
Tortured after life
Submit to parasites
Thoughts drown in a mental haze
Extraction from reality
Feelings now devoured

Kill with hate
Kill with pain
Kill without sense

You can't see
You can't here
You are dead

Hunted victims
Out of lust
Splits open for all who have died
