A time is coming
All eyes shall see
To eliminate all future pain

Enter the ritual
Of life's desire
Revelation laid to rest

My life is evil
I bring your pain
Inject the venom
From inside
I watch you die
Flesh of death

You make us in your image
Or do we make you in ours
The quest for pure supremacy
Take your place begin the ceremony
I represent all that's righteous and holy

Hidden feelings suffocation
Mental surge excruciating
Life of pain and misery
Suffering the fear of pain
Choice of death, what will it be
The fatal conflict has been fought
Endless struggle, death is sought

Rancid martyr pillaged horror
Abdicate morbid fate
Malignant cancer, Necromancer
The sovereign one he is dead

Corpse of being rabid flesh
Sublimated virtues lie decayed
The fatal seed has been spawned
