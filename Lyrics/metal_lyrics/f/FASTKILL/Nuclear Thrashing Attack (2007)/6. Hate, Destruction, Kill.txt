You try to fly with broken wings
You take off high to avoid death
Corpse of the wicked
Widespread grief and terror

Give me a sign that you exist at the threeshold
I'm coming from behind delight in slaying

I saw your face in the crowd
Impressed so deep inside my heart
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Like a shadow of domination

We'll force you to be nice to each other
Kill you before you kill each other

"Somebody please come and help me"

Hate! I hate you all of you
Destruction! I promise you agony
Kill! Death is deliverance
Thirst for revenge
Hate, destruction, kill
