Fear me not but fear my hell
Man made me so I could kill
Eternal hate to men and world
Endless lust burned in my head
Kill with no regret
Piercing, impaling, no judgment
Eternal scream that slowly die
I need to hate in my brain

I eat the human flesh
Backing in your dying breath

One cryptic reason for kill
Cause for Iâm insane
Defile and desecrate humanity
Your life is godlessness

Iâll sell your life and preach your death
I breach your life
Within my world of hate
Corroding from inside
