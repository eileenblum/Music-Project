Mutilation, Incantation, Strangulation scared to die, to die
Desecration, suffocation, conformation, life ruled by fear, by fear

Feeling the hatred of those damned in hell
Eyes dripping blood, realization of death
Master of forces and powers of Satan
Bleeding fast, Poverty fall onto your fate

Die! Lose of vital signs 
Now sleeping drenched in blood, Waiting for death to unfold
Do you want to die? Drenched in blood!!

Instruction, domination, constitution, motive to kill, to kill 
Immolation, examination, isolation, peace of the dead, the dead

Die for the immortal one skin is turning black
Experience, mortality leaves you ripped and torn
Inside your carcass starts to melt
Pressure in your skull, inside your brain

Die! Lose of vital signs 
Now sleeping drenched in blood, Waiting for death to unfold
Do you want to die? Drenched in blood!!
