Ripping and crawling, it tears your apart
Lust and desire, all that i need

A time to kill
Sick lust fot skeletal flesh
Death's pointing at your head
No sense of crime in my mind

Malicious entity
Possessed with cruel notion
Putrefied will is mangling your flesh

Unconscious, kill after kill, no regret
Impulsive massacre has begun
I'm in pain, need to hate, and kill again
You will suffer to die

Use the need, losing control, to my hate, to my scorn
I'm the one to taste your death, stainde in blood

Desacrate and rape
Thrashing through the crimson mud
Immortal lust

I'll be dancing on your grave

Psychotic lust is fed
Inherited endless dead time
Becomes death's vile parade
Trust in only the pain i sense

To hate, with hata, i hate you, go die !!
