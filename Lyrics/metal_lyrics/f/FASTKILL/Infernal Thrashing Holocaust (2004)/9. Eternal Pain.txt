Death of emotion, birth of decay
Fear of the future, hope in the past
Mortal choice, burden of life
Asking myself; am I to die?

Maliciously tortured, ripped to shreds,
Innocent victims
Killed by death !
Frenzied thrashings, drenched in blood,
fleeting screams,
You've succumbed !

Death, aggression, terror from below
Rotting corpse, slowly rotting away
Fatality diseased, a victim of rancid decay
The fuse of life growing shorter

Started my games, you're lost without your miracle
Your life will end, unable to see sunrise
Remember your will before you come to this place
I'm here to cage your soul and make you learn yo obey
You'll adapt to a new existence and never return
Nothing is left for you now
One and only, eternal pain !!

I am here for the dead !
I will kill for my cause !
I am not of this earth !
Humans are easy prey, eternal pain of slavery !!
