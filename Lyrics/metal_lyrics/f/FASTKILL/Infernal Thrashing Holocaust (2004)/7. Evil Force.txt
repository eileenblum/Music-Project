Evil worship
Preaching and tempting
Confine you to a chamber
Deprived you of hope

Force Of Evil
Evil divine
Desire for drenched in blood
Darkened future

A world is full of blasphemy
Sacrificed for a dictator
A world never to be imagined
Too late to notice
Left to die !!

There exists a place of agony
A living corpse, with no one to confine
Lost in a world of pleasure
Now here comes the torture
Mutilation's a terrible sight
Whipped unmercifully and left to bleed

Evil ! Wickedness ! Inclemency !
Suffering ! Bleeding ! Livingh Hell !
