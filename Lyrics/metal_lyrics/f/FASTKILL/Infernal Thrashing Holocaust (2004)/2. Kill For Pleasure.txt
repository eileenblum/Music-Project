The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings the pleasure that I need
The rotting hides, rotting flesh
Innocent victims cry out in pain
Bloody corpses make me feel great
Ripping out your eyes, tearing off your face
All feeling's gone, nothing to say or do
Smell of death lurks around the place

Now you believe, your better off dead
But blood... an evil seed
Orgasmic pleasure, ready for anything
No direction got nowhere to go...
Kill for pleasure

Stop praying there's no saving
Slit your throat drink your blood
You feel your body start to sweat
The pleasure of watching you die
You turn around, run and run again
It's the only thing to do
Ritual hunt every night
Half eaten carcass stained red

I have a deal with Satan, contract signed in hell
Painful death's the bloody cost, Must you die!!

Say your prayers to God everyday
and you all will burn in hell
The lies they tell you won't come true
and in the end you simply die!

Satan comes to see that no one's saved
By my lord my god, master Lucifer
There is no life or birth
When the undead walk the Earth
Evil, Abuse, Violent torment
Black as the night he begins his fight
Glowing eye, he wears no disguise
Leaving black Earth in decay
