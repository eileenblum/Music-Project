Awaiting a messiah to save me from insanity
I see through the eyes, torture with brutality
Infernal darkness and pestilence,
mutilation has begun
Evil strikes with storming pain, bringer of death

Immates in holocaust. method of annihilation
Next god's sacrifice in the name of evil
Eternal morbid circle you don't realize
Senseless violence all around, a lesson in hates

People must die, destruction to all,
Embedding the terror, die in despair

Feel the hatreed, built up in me by your wishing hell
Feel the hatreed, in my veins the horror
Feel the hatreed, bestial force and lust
Feel the hatreed, possessed by eternal hate

Agony brings misery
Immortal beings left to die
Tortured into confession
The sorrow of this internal pain

Prince of darkness,
ruler of hell stands in front of me
Evil thoughts run through my brain
all signs point to my way
You feel, that you'll go insane
but still you have to meet
With death, in flames, tomorrow you're dead

Evil minds, bring evil ways,
horror is the price you pay
Immolation of the masses
blinded eyes asking why
Contamination seeds the ground,
death and mortis depriving life
Life, death, or eternity,
paranoia is no answer
