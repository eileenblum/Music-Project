Burn my eyes and try to blind me
Don't need a reason for the pain I'm feeling
I think I'm going insane
The more intense, the sense of ignorance

Hate, breeds hate!
The pain will never leave me it's scarred my brain
Stagnant state! Stench of hell!
No family, no funeral, no rosaries for...

Disillusion, desperation!
Agony, the final conflict, give birth to death
Human hell, I can't take!
In the end, I lay there breathless, six feet under

Brutal existence
Aggravation infinite greed necrosexuality
All that's left is hate!
All that's left is pain!

Nailed, to the cross!
My blood boils up, spread the hate
Raging shattered past!
The spirit of demise has conquered our minds again
