Rise up to the sky, over the trees
Filled with the dark strength
Blood blown by the winds, dormany for years
Brings forth the warlust

Spears sharpened with swords
Shields retain their power
Screams break through the air
Feeble ones cry to their god

Fall down to the ground
Cut through the throat
Crushed by the horses
Blast of the trumpets
Sentenced to death
Fight for your honor

Field blacked with red
Joined with the rain
Elixir of pure strength
Evoking the dark

Gray shadows walk the earth
Bodies lifted by the breeze

Stakes pierced with dead flesh
Burden of stench
Drifts into caverns of the woods
