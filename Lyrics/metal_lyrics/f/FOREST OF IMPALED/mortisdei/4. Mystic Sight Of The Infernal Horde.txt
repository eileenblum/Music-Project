Sabers cast upon the ground
Spears and maces drenched in blood
Fallen Herald of noble race
Infernal evening takes its toll

Hail the king
Vow of the knight
Unbroken oath towards the end
Dark masterdom channeled through the soul
Almighty force
Reached through thought but not attained
Driven to feast in the Maxe
Where life has no meaning

Colors of the mind pass
As a child turns to the light
Light reflects off my face
Among the leaves a figure appears
Eyes of white stare
Skin of the night
It chants "The Forest"

Follow in its animal footsteps
A cold wind flows through my hair
The weight of immense armor pulls towards the Earth
In awe and splendor I march forth
The light of the moon
Forms shadows on my sword
Intrigued I step into the forest
