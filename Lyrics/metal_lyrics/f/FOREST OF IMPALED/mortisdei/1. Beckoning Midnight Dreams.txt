Estranged by the stars
Mead of honey in hand
Dream into ancient wood, crackling with strength
My soul grows hungry, as flys encircle my eyes
The whore of my side, entices me with whispering words

Laughter enters, the depths of the woods
Stirring the dark unknown
Look into the trees, hear the leaves rustle
Among their beauty the goddess appears
Mystic face of centuries forlorn
The bears the nar of wisdom
Eyes of black, hair of amber
The dances to strip me of spirit

Shine the sword, it gleams with pretenatual power
The mighty swing, ready to cut through the heart of man
Strapping my leather harness
Blood rushes through hardening veins
Mist from my breath extends to the early morning fog
Cathedrals of smoke rise up to the sky
Men sing songs of warlike lust preparing for the dawn
