Nature passes through
Raise up the sun with thy arms
Time of eternal blackness
The might swordsman brings forth his work
Darkness falls, Sunlight returns
Famished by Spirits, I Declare my quest for war
Surrounded by fear

Tenabrarum, The Conuring of Night
Esotexic Form of the Pagans
Androgyn, Psychotic dance of the mind
Love of wandering in dark exstacy

Holy Androgyn
Nomad of the forest
Holy Androgyn
Enter thy mighty servant

Hear the boar of galloping horns
Feel the sound of clanking swords
The trance of the shadows

Awakened by the burn of the sun
The feeding of disgust, Given the nocturnal life
Conquering the light of the sun

Cryptic Unius Est Qeneralic Allerius
