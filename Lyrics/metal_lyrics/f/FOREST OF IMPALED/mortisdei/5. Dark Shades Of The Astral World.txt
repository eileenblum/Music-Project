Walk the path of sorrow
Cascades of whispers, dew of the ancient
Pass the gate of the astral world
Apocalyptic dreams, cursed for centuries

Hunt the lonely branches
Enchanted I wander upon the fog

Infernal spirit guides me through the dark
Haunting visions float on air
Yearning to enter the eclipse of the sun
Dive into the dismal abyss
Laid on thorns

The child vanishes into the nothingness
A still silence is heard
Voices speak on the toungue of the wind
Horrific images fill my mind

Shivering from fright
Sweat burns my eyes
Frozen with coldness
I stare upon the forest
