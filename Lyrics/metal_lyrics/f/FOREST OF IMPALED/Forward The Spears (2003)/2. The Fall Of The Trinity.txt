[Music: A. Adamus / Lyrics: M. Kolar]

See Belial, on the walls of Sodom!
Pale priestess veiled in Pestilence...
adorned by War!

Hear the forge of Moloch...
the screams of children rage!
Black weapons in agony made...
to end the shperds reign!
Agony!, Agony!

Vomit the Bastards blood...
Christ the King of lies!
I spit on the Prophets, behead Mohammed!
God of jews denied!

Burn!, Burn Jerusalem!
Burn Mecca, Burn Nazareth!
Unholy Fire!

Sodom and Gomorrha risen from ashes...
Golgotha stands triumphant.

The sweet daughters...
the daughters of Eve weeping!
Their wombs filled with...
...my Black Seed!

My seed! Blackest seed...
God falls... into Eternity!
Beneath sat Chaos, Sin on his right...
Death on his left!

An ancient Night...
spread over all the Heavens...
as we devour the stars...
the Angels weeping...
Eternally! ...Eternally!
