[Music: M. Trela / Lyrics: M. Kolar]

The Valkyries Weep for me...
above this battle*eld!
Once they sang of my deeds...
now they sing my lament!

Just out of their reach...
bleeding, I lie, waiting for death!
The warriors way, duty met!
miles from mercy...
bloodied and bent!

A cold wind blows...
The Hunter has risen...
The Deceiver runs with the wolves...
over the nations of men!

Thy Serpent comes!
His will be done on earth!
Blacken the heavens!
Devour all the remains!

Devour!

The dark one calls...
scream in our veins!
Our blood burns with rage...
to strike out as did Cain!

A cold wind blows...
The Hunter has risen...
The Deceiver runs with the wolves...
over the nations of men!

The Valkyries Weep for me...
Broken and Betrayed!
Once they sang of my deeds...
now they sing my lament!

Sons of Cain!
Sons of Cain!
