[Music: A. Adamus / Lyrics: M. Kolar]

Blood!
The Hand of Vengeance!
I rise among!
Dark Devourer!
Darkness walks again!
The hand of doom...
Rip at your throat!
I must kill you!
I have been envoked!

I am Soulless!
Dead inside!
Cold merciless butcher!
You cannot hide!
Death comes ripping!
I need your blood!
I must kill with hate!
See you suffer!

For your betrayal...
I consume your soul!
Prisoner of my lesh!
I return to hell!

For your betrayal...
I consume your soul!
Prisoner of my lesh!
I return to hell!
Hell!

I am Soulless!
Dead inside!
Still born assassin...
of hells design!
Carve out your heart!
Make of you a feast!
You are consumed!
My masters revenge complete!

To test the lesh...
to rip and tear...
open wounds speak to me...
in forgotten tongues!
Whispering secrets...
mysteries of blood and cum!
Lavished in moribund...
drenched you are undone!

Darkest passions...
the crack of bone...
the pulling of teeth...
licking of the meat!
Your cries are useless...
they fall upon deaf ears!
No begging will help you...
my heart is dead and cold!

For your betrayal...
I consume your soul!
Prisoner of my lesh!
I return to hell!
