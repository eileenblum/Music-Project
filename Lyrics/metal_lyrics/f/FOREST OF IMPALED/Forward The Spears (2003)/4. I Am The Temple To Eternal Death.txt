[Music: A. Adamus / Lyrics: M. Kolar, Intro: Kolar]

Dark Rivers of Hate Scream through these Veins...
My Shadow is Death Everlowing Punishment!

...Fall to me!
I am the Chaos God! All consuming!
Sweet everlasting Darkness...
low from me!
Never-ending hatred pouring...
from these veins!

I am the Alter... I am Sacri*ce...
I am the Gates Bleeding... I am the Temple to Eternal Death!

...Fall to me!
I am the Chaos God! All consuming!
Sweet everlasting Darkness...
low from me!
Never-ending hatred pouring...
from these veins!

Black Slave Drum Heart... Pumping Rage into in*nity...
My shadow in Death... a shroud of Everending Darkness!

Black Hell Fire Freezing!
Deep inside me never-ending!
Black Hole Heart Pumping Hatred!
Slice my Veins set It free!

Black Hell Fire Freezing!
Deep inside me never-ending!
Black Hole Heart Pumping Hatred!
Slice my Veins set It free!

...Fall to me!
I am the Chaos God! All consuming!
Sweet everlasting Darkness...
low from me!
Never-ending hatred pouring...
from these veins!

Dark Rivers of Hate Scream through these Veins...
My Shadow is Death Everloving Punishment!

I am the Alter... I am Sacri*ce...
I am the Gates Bleeding... I am the Temple to Eternal Death!
