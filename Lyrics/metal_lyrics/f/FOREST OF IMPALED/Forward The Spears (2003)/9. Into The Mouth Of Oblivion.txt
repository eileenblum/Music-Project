[Music: A. Adamus / Lyrics: M. Kolar]

The Hammer Falls!
Endless stormy skies...
days black as night!
Death rides on Dark Wings of Pestilence!

The Heaven tremble with roar of War!
The Earth groans, splits and shakes...
to Drink her children's gore...

Our lady of peace...
brought to her knees!
Left raped and bleeding!
Bathed in Sin!
True Death begins!
Praised be the Destroyers!

The Destroyers!

Our lady of peace...
brought to her knees!
Left raped and bleeding!
Bathed in Sin! True Death begins!
Praised be the Destroyers!
All Blood! All Fire!
All Death! The seals are broken.

Bloodied and broken the meek lift thine eyes...
from the ashes only the dead hear their cries;
"God why have you forsaken me?"

Lo...a Shadow of Horror...is risen!

Take me...I welcome oblivion!
I beg your most blessed... blessed suffering!

What Demon hath formed this void?
'tis I the prideful one!
I broke the seals!
A Shriek ran through Eternity...
like fear itself!
