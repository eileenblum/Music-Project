[Music: M. Trela, A. Adamus / Lyrics: A. Adamus]

Lumen Nature Passes through...
Rise up with thy Arms!
Time of Eternal Blackness!
Thy Mighty Swordsman bring forth his work!

Darkness Falls, Sunlight Returns!
Famished by Spirits, I Declare My Quest for War!
Surrounded by Fear!
Tenebrarum, the Conjuring of the Night!
Esoteric Form of Pagans!
Androgyn, Psych Dance of the Mind!
Love of Wandering in the Dark!

Holy Androgyn! Nomad of the Forest!
Holy Androgyn! Enter thy Mighty Servant!
...Servant!

Hear the Roar of Galloping Horses...
Feel the Sound of Clanking Swords
The Trance of the Shadows
Awakened by the Burn of the Sun...

The Feeling of Disgust! Given the Nocturnal Life...
Conquering the Light of the Sun!
Coruptio Unius Est Qeneratio Atterius!
