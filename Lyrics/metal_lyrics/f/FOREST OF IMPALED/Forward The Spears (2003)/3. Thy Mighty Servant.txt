[Music: M. Trela / Lyrics: M. Kolar]

Rise O'Mighty Cruel One...
Bloody and Bent!
Rise now Wretched and Unholy!
Unleash your foul Plagues!
We call to thee... Now Send thy Shade...
and Set free Thine WRATH!

O'Father of Darkness... I bow on my Knees!
Thy Mighty Servant awaits you...
Crowned in Swords!, Conqueror of all, in thy name!
I lay the Kingdom of man... at your feet!

Behold he Rises!
See he comes! I Hail to thee... Satan!
King of all the earth... and ruler of Hell!
We have waited to long!
Rise now... and take your place of Honor!
Dark angels, Price of Hell, We bow!

"Prophecy speaks!" "Thrice are you marked!"
"You are the weapon!" "My son!"

Behold he Rises!, See he comes!
I Hail to thee..., Satan!
King of all the earth... and ruler of Hell!
We have waited to long!
Rise now... and take your place of Honor!
Dark angels, Price of Hell, We bow!

Rise O'Mighty Cruel One...
Bloody and Bent!
Rise now Wretched and Unholy!
Unleash your foul Plagues!
We call to thee...
Now Send thy Shade...
and Set free Thrine Wrath!
