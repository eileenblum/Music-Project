Raise the banners of strength,
The iron fist of darkness,
Raise the banners of intelligence,
The inverted star of Satan.
Light the torches of truth,
And burn the teachings of slaves,
Forge the black spears
To pierce the heart of Christ.

War drums pound the air,
A thundering announcement,
Our declaration has been made,
And war is waged this day.

Join the march, the black crusades,
Instinctive order built by rage,
Hordes of darkness massing strong,
Poised to strike for one resolve.

War drums pound the air,
A thundering announcement,
Our declaration has been made,
And war is waged this day.
Kill them all!

The mauls of hate come crashing down,
With deafening blows on drums of war,
A prelude of the storm to come,
That will wash away the lambs of the holy son.
And the earth forever be shadowed in the shade of night.

All hail! Darkness!
We are lords of shadow!
All hail! Darkness!
We are the kings of night.
Burn them all!

Pyres of flesh are set to burn,
Hungry flames dance and churn,
We will never stop until you're all gone.

All hail! Darkness! Religion burns out acrid fumes
All hail! War! Destroy and take the throne!
Take the throne!

All hail! Darkness! Religion burns out acrid fumes,
All hail! War! Destroy and take the throne!
All hail! Darkness! Swing hard and cut them down,
All hail! War! Destroy and take the throne!
