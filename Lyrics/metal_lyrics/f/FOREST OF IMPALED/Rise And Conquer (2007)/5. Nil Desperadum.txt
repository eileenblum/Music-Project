Hate for hate and ruth for ruth,
Eye for eye and truth for tooth,
Scorn for scorn and smile for smile,
Love for love and guile for guile,

War for war and woe for woe,
Blood for blood and blow for blow,
I am the friend of all brave men
The foe to all cowards
What they are and have been,

Flesh for flesh and soul for soul.
Spirit for spirit and victory for the bold,

I call up high and daring,
I cast down despair,
Be dangerous even in defeat,
Be as a lion with clawed angry feet.

War for war and victory to the bold,
Live with honour and courage so told.
I am the friend of all brave men,
The foe to all cowards,
What they are and have been.

Be not afraid and show no fear,
Let it be said not all life is dear,
Live behind the veil,
Walk with a thundering scorn,
Be what you are, lest you be shorn.

Lest the dog slaves of the divine creepling be muzzled,
Enslavement is imminent.

Be not afraid and show no fear,
Let it be said not all life is dear,
Live behind the veil,
Walk with a thundering scorn,
Be what you are, lest you be shorn.
Let the shadows be born!
