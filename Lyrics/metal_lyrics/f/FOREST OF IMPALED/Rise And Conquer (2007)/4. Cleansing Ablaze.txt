Red tapestries blow eerily in the wind,
Amidst an inferno of scorched dead earth,
Our black winged sign looms ominous on high,
A brutal reminder of our rebirth.

The only sound is the burning of lies,
Mixed with the stench of a false world.

Our banner set, showing the sign,
Your once firm rule is now benign,
Pretentious leaders of subjugation,
Have succumbed to us, our blades rest firmly at their necks.

We have risen an army of the black,
Hell bent to cleanse our world of filth.
We'll fight savagely to no end,
Cleansing Ablaze.

History rewritten with the truth
Cleansing Ablaze.

Iconized heroes fallen to shame
Without their shield of God's name.
Cleansing ablaze, of the masses cult,
We'll stand proud on broken remains
Onward rolls our war machine.
