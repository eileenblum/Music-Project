[Miasma Cover]

Feel the pain creeps through my veins,
Close my eyes and see this face.
What's this feeling, which cannot be named?
Try to escape this deadly race.

Realize I know it, face abhorrent feelings,
Endeavour to name it, call it schizophrenia.
Voices give me orders, I just obey,
Went to a psychiatrist, he called it schizophrenia.

Wardens with straight-jackets, before I distinguish,
Force my hands on my back: "He's got schizophrenia.",
Put me in a cell. I don't know what that helps.
Scholars pass me by: "Another case of schizophrenia".

Sit in my cell, but I'm not alone,
They speak to me, try to persuade
Me that I shall get out of this hole,
But there's just one way to evade:
Kill myself and meet with them.
This promise seems to me like heaven.

"Come and follow us!"
