There comes a time when man must abandon all he holds dear,
And summon the honour of old and the strength to keep it.

This is a call to arms,
Ready yourself to die,
This is a call to war,
For thy blackest honour,

Throw down your laborious duties,
Break open your rusted shackles.

This is a call to arms,
This is a call for darkness,
This is a call to victory,
This is a call... this is a call to war.

It's time for natural law to be restored,
A time for strength, a time for honour,
For modern bloodlines are tainted,
With the foul stench of white light mortals,
Spoken from worm eaten texts.

Rotting by their own words,
Choking on their own words.

To war! Rise and Conquer!
Mother Darkness hail!

We are the vaccine,
For this sick infection,
This plague of faith and ruin
Now comes to an end.
Cold and miserable... it dies.

This is a call to arms,
This is a call for darkness,
This is a call to victory,
This is a call... this is a call to war!
