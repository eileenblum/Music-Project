You gave it all, all your fucking life. In your conscious acceptance of despair. You surrendered. You gave over, as a self-traitor, the few bits. The few parts that made me gain respect for you. Isn't it hard now, to crawl? In your own mess, smell the stench of your own disgust. Every living day, a battle, to embrace yourself. In the depths of your hostile frame, you are offering no resistance. Was it worth the betrayal of your only few strong beliefs? Your better times will never come; they've never been. You gave in all, all your fucking life in your conscious acceptance of despair. You surrendered.
