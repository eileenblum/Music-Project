I make social subtractions.
I cumulate the awkward, the occasions.
Equation, the lone soldier.
Unnamed, anonymous, faceless in the crowd.
And my passion for control, my love affair with steel.
In this unstable narrow circle drawn at the limit of my insecurity,
I have a space, secluded, where I stand in strength.
I have control and define all variables.
I play God.
My only kingdom, my lonely.
And this profound level of unworthiness has triggered my social disconnection.
My last physical presence.
My now absence.
