The atmosphere has just bent into dark.
In this deep silence, we share a loss, in a truthful sadness.
Fully aware that we arenât prepared for the desolation we foresee.
Our awkward presence, entrance.
And this immaculate building.
I canât belong in this impeccable mourning suite.
The discomfort we feel stresses the reason of our presence here.
And you rest.
You donât appear so peaceful.
I am trying to accept this variation of you within my glowing memories.
Adieu, dear friend.
Our profound respect to everything you are.
