Your broken mirror
Are your best feature
I watch my step
To not cut myself
Iâve made you dull
Dreamless nights
Have made you dull
Stick it back where it belongs
Lock it up
Inside you
Donât come home
Looking that way
Look at me
Iâm so old
Inside me
Iâm so tired
I see
Lifeless corps
Aging skin
Dying skin
Look at me
Iâm so old
Inside me
Iâm so tired
I see
(Iâm) falling apart
Piece by piece
Look at me
