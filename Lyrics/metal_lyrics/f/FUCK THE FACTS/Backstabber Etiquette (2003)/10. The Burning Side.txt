Left dead and gutted on the line
Useless to them
Theyâve moved on
Now theyâre searching for another victim
Donât dare believe, they lie like the rest of them
Theyâll watch you bleed, and lie like the rest of them
Donât dare believe they lie like the rest of them
Theyâll watch you die, and lie like the rest of them
Donât dare believe they lie like the rest of them
Hippies in love, living (in) BC
Picking some fruits, being happy
Heated their souls, praying (to) Jesus
Put all their faith
(In) Christianism
Her husband left, evangelists
They took her money, her family
Hooking people, selling a dream
And all her hopes
Fall behind
Without religion, now sheâs happy
Too late to see, ruined her family
My cousin's son, is a coke head
And his daughter
A real whore
