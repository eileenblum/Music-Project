Keep yourself shaking to that beat and set my dreams on fire. These bags are getting deeper, yet still I think I won't rest; I think I can't rest; at least not yet. Why not press your luck? Lived entire lifetimes in these deep recesses while marching onward with no clear goal in mind for far too long, so what's a little bit longer? Perhaps opportunities lost; or have they just begun? Indulge me; that's never stopped me before.
