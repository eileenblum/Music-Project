Buried alive. Feeding on broken dreams. Virgin, undone. An aging white page. And it eats you up. From the inside out. Eats you up. Inside out. Try to convince yourself this is for real. And the bitter taste in your mouth keeping you awake at night. It eats you up. From the inside out. Eats you up. Inside out
