The things I recall; you killing me twice. You embalmed my will to speak, all thatâs unsaid. Destroy the love and love my own death. My roadway, in ruins. You gave me something for which I never asked. How can I blame you? Surrounded by my needs, scared, alone. Free in a cage, Iâm home. How can I blame you? Theyâll have to drag me kicking and screaming to get me out of here. This is my tomb, these walls, this space. You embalmed my will to speak, all thatâs unsaid. Destroy the love. And when youâll ache, Iâll ache with you. If you fall, Iâll reach the ground beneath you. If you stop breathing, Iâll rest mine too. When tomorrow comes and brings hope for change, Iâll be there, but will you?
