Does that writing on the wall tell us itâs not true? Less time to decide, clocks are burning. Weâre now thrown together. There are few chances for a tomorrow. Weâre not holding on. The curse is short but binding. The curse never ends. Last chance, claim your dependence. Donât settle on what youâve become. What I see is you and what you are doing. What I see in you; all the damage that has been done. No one knows. Last chance to damn and shout with a gun in your mouth. The curse is growing stronger. The curse has taken over. The curse is going nowhere ever. Weâre lost in this, dead-end. The curse has knocked us down. Strengthened with our flaws. The curse is us, andd everything. Weâre lost in this, dead-end.
