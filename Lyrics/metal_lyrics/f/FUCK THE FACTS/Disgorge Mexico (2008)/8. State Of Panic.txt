A state of panic will be spread. As a sign of hope, I will be your shelter. I will be your salvation. Only your fear will prevail. I'll infiltrate your home with a warm whispered sound. The doors are now open, as are the ones of a whole country that bled on its beliefs. Out of my window, the glow, the warm, the red. A civil brothel, selling his people for its mercy. A moment of comfort for broken men. A moment of peace or final relief.
