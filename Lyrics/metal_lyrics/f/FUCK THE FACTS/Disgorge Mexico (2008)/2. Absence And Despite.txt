All my convictions turned to rust, washed away, from the second I met you. Staring at me, asking for shelter and I refused. Iâm not your own, absent and despite, if youâre troubled, Iâll never be there, come close. The last thing you should pursue: that strong desire to reach me. Why track me down? Iâm not the one to talk to. You need someone to grab your hand, or hug to say âI careâ. You need a shoulder to lie on. Well seek somewhere else, âcause I wonât be there for you. You are my burden, your weight will always be too much. Repelled by your sight, I close my eyes to your distress. Through the good times and the bad times, donât ever count on my support. It makes me feel good to see you sad. It makes me feel good. I want you quiet. Iâve never cared about your misery, your sad life that was calling for pity. Iâve always wished to see you lie, peacefully, quiet. Reunited for the last time, I sent you back, we werenât supposed to meet. I dug a hole in your backyard, pushed the dirt, created a space. I dug a hole in your backyard, pushed the dirt, created a space. I dug you a hole in your backyard. In response to a long scream. The echo, the remains, a place called home.
