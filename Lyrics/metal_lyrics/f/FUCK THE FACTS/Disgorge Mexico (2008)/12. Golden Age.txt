Lying in the streets of Berlin. Covered by the dust of fear and the remains of screams. Shinning in the single role of her career. Starring as a simple creature within the empire. The Golden age of motherhood. In the glamour of an obsessed nation. Giving up for the dreamed splendors, for a nice ending and for all power given to her smaller world.
