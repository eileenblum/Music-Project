Drawn back, unresigned, blacked out from all the abuse. The firewater, the rains is pouring out the window and it will testify. I fell the rain drops on me, I cannot sleep, I cannot rest. Eyes wide open, theyâre coming for me. All the noises timed, timed with my heart beats, makes it hard to focus. And this lucid conviction, this feeling, Iâm being watched. Itâs been too many nights. In the fainting light, I listen I hear the whispers. The voice enunciating my fate, shouting my irrelevant story, the plot and its ending in this endless flow. My limbs numbed, detached, I struggle to possess my own self. I ache and fear. The sound of the slow pace music, Iâm fighting for the last chances to sleep. Itâs been too many nights. The discomfort speech drilling my spine. High-pitch dissonance tearing in, feeding back.
