Destruction of life
Iâll let you know when weâll kill him
So they said, it should be soon
Let's leave him dead alone
Like a dead fool
We go now
Bring your knife,
All equipment, be ready,
To kill a man, for the first time
In your life, you're not a child
I was just like you
Youâre now afraid, of body bags
But if you first start squealing
It's your turn
Youâll bleed
Bleed
The orchestra of death
You're everyone in this world
Watch you're back
I'm not your friend
That's for real
Watch your acts or you will pay the price
Bleed your worth it
For the first time
In your life
You're someone,
Youâre my victim
Perpetrator no....
You fucked your chance
I don't need you
Did you a favour
Youâre not worth it
Perpetrator no....
Now you know
That Iâll kill you
No second chance
Gotta job to do
Perpetrator I shouldn't have followed you
