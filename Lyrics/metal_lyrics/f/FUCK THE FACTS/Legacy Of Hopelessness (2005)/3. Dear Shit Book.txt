No time for smiling
I'm trying to swallow

Last time you said it
Last time (you) meant it
Now, prove your point

Look me in the eye
(Don't tempt me)
Trying not to hide your smile
(Don't try)
Tell me it'll be fine
(Don't tempt me)
Neither one of us even knows

This time is the last time
The last time
Last time

Know that
I'm trying
To keep us
Apart
