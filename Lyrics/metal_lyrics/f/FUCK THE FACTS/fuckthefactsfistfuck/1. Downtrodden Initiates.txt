Into the endless nightmare.
A descent into these hollow confrontations that came so quickly undone.
If we are what we say, we'll never feel the need to argue.
But we'll never agree.
So, by all means, let the showdown commence.
We need it now, more than anything.
Browsing aimlessly. Looking for a more wholesome "us".
All we find, is the familiar sense of deflation.
