Vanished between the cracks and into darkness.
Degraded and taken for less than what it's worth.
Into the black.

Ants scattered aimless.
Roaches made way inside.
Late to the party.
Hit the brakes, hate yourself.

Usher out your soul in fury, goodnight.
Starts crimson, blackout slowly and with grace, toothless grin bruised without relent.
