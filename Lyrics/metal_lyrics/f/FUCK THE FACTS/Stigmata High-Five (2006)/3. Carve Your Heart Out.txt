Blacked out. Urge not to live. I used to have. A shade of my own. Life has consumed. What was mine. I struggle being significant. Almost unknown. A stranger to this face of the earth. Iâm waiting for you. Youâll realize what you just lost. Iâll steal. Your most precious memories, my delicacy fantasies. Iâll taste you, my delicacy fantasies. Iâll taste you. A taste of you. Iâm surrounding you. Your depression will be delightful. Looking for the open flame in your eyes. Iâll carve your heart out. Youâll realize what you just lost. Iâll steal. Your most precious memories. My delicacy fantasies. Iâll taste you. My delicacy fantasies. Iâll taste you. My delicacy fantasies. A severe hunger. Has slaved me. A meager sacrifice. To feed my wounds. A conquest. For pleasures. Has left me empty. Depraved. I raise. Depraved. Nothing to be found. A world to be drawn. A conquest. For pleasures. Has left me starved. Irrational. Iâll devour your hope. Iâll suck your faith. Iâll carve your heart out. Iâll taste you. To feed my wounds.
