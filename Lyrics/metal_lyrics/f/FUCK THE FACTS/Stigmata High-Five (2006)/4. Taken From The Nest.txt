Walk. No time. Take from the nest. Dressed in a white outline. Just to show you have your life. Lift your confidence. Your pathâs around your neck. Consume. He wants. What he wants. When he wants it. The cheapest cost. Would be worth enough. Itâs painted in his brotherâs blood. Working through the dark. Just to fill basic needs in life. A faceless shadow left. The ruin of my bare hands. The need. To advance in all. A black eye is needed. A cycle maintained. The sky was black. And the air growing. In her hand. Cold. Falling. On the ground. Her work. Printed with a picture. She once loved. He needs. What he believes. Is inescapable. Why? Eyeless sight. Why? Mindless acts. Walk. No time. Wise. Taken from the nest. Do you believe as human beings that weâve progressed? Youâre wrong. The sky was black. And the air growing. In her hand. Cold. Rush back home.
