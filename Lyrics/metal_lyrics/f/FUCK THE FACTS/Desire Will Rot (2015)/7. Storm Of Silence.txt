Voids have been filled with an echoing sound,
for the bitterness and rivals.
Life, love, for only so long.
Nothing shrouded, veils in bloom.
Surrounded by the melody of the good times to come.
The silence removes us from where we must belong.
Come screeching, to a full stop.
Saddened by monotony, we forgot the meaning of fun.
Stare long enough, it will stare back at you.
Old wisdom enchants only the ears of the few.
Something crashed through the window, the dawn.
The glass shattered in pieces was swept off the floor.
Our life into the trash, what good has it done?
Bitterness dies when you find something new.
The truth.
The silence, removed us.
