Late within the somber hours.
The hunt.
Iâve leaped into the odd dance.
I can smell their sweat;
see through their dark and vivid stares.
And the one prey, only to take.
Sing the words of your vanity.
Display your freedom,
like a cheap commodity.
Keep stepping on the trap;
gamble your life with the wolf pack.
You wonât have the final word.
Itâs so clear you canât see.
Your excessive pride made you mindless,
defenseless.
I can smell the fire, I can smell the burn.
Run sweet little prey, before your end comes.
