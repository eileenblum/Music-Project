Unrest, immersed in the black.
Home in the dark, in it I thrive.
An endless panic is all we know.
A profound restlessness.
Barn doors slammed shut.
The night has begun.
With it I am one.
No memory escapes me.
Not one, I never forgot.
Yet the days drag on.
Endless.
I'm waiting for a rush.
Filling my day full, hunting, killing all that I see.
The open scars on my face.
Not one tranquil second.
Deprived of it all, peace.
And still, I am in awe.
Of those who live softly in their caves of regret.
Upon carpet and cloth.
Failure comes quickly for those who wait.
Far too long suffering.
So bring forth the victims as the moon drenched sky.
Makes shadows collide.
On them I rely, on them I will feast.
With the winds blowing north.
With the dawn in the east.
