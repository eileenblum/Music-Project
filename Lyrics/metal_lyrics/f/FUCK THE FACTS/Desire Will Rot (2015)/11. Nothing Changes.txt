Brick pulverized.
The essence stripped.
Bowing down, they all looked away.
Jaded scripts.
Passed down to all.
The grandfathers' tale, the granddaughters ear.
Nothing changes cause nothingâs changed.
Uncompensated for lost time.
We're spreading the news.
Waist deep in the blue ribbon blues.
No relief from that which ails you.
Silenced childrenâs opened throats.
So wipe that dumb western look off your privileged mug.
Enshrined in a house of cards built by dipshits.
Describe yourself one last time.
Cause you're washed up, finished, done, you're through.
Like the jaded scripts we burnt.
When success became your fun.
That's how I knew you were done.
Nothing changes, because nothing's changed.
