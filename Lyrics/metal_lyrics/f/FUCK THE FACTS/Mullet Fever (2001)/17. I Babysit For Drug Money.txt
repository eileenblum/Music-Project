When I wasn't babysitting for my drug money, or selling my sister into prostitution, I could often be found reading copies of Martha Stewart's "Living" magazine. I appreciated the helpful "Home Tips" that she gave us, but soon I had realized that I was just falling victim to her neo-nazi political ideas. Then I started burning my copies of "Home" magazine. Now I just masturbate to pictures in "TV Guide". I wonder what's on tonight. It's probably reruns I bet.
