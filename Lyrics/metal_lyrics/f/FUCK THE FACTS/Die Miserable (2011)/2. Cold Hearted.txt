Masked under a well crafted, public image of politician, generation saviour. visionary or religious crusader, the lives, the memory thieves. their bags loaded with shattered rights and crushed dignities. their theory, well perfected, well tested. abominable researches were conducted in my own province, on simple citizens ready to try alternative cures, in hope to ease their depressive disorder. Oblivious to their involvement in the advancement of modern distortion techniques. ignorant of the level of physical violence of the treatments, and the abuse. violated of the right to reject, as now the so called war prisoners, the right to protest. an institutionalized human rights slaughter. Iâm ashamed. when choice of words give latitude over restrictions and impact over one destiny, the decisions of a small group of men destroys the lives of many. a haled legal word breach, bringing our brother to a bare low level. I canât believe that this is now, us. what we grew into as a civilization. sadistic and primitive like our early ancestors. who we are. cold hearted, hypocrite, scrooge, as no educated man before. a politician, generation saviour. visionary or religious crusader, the lives, the memory thieves. their bags loaded with shattered rights and crushed dignities. while in the country capital is spent on a war for safety. how can you justify your means when your inhabitant cannot afford to maintain and cure their own body. winter is slowly taking over. the leaves, fallen on the ground. seasons are passing, my reality getting colder. mistakes from the past forgotten, later refashioned. Iâll never be in a position to sympathise with such power misuse. how can you sleep at night?
