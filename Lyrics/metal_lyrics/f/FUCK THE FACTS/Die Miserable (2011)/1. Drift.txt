The nights, the traveled shared. the souvenir of you, in a distant past. made us closer. the creative spring, brought us closer. just like a brother. I never feared the threat of time. and I never guessed
that we would drift so far apart. your support, your presence, your ear, trough some of our darkest times. why didnât you reach me? when the burden of your sorrow was weighting you down? I neglected the alert given by your gentle retreat. how could I have slowed you down? when the events were only disguised under an excuse for a life becoming over busy. it seemed so natural, no reason to look for an under lying ground. why didnât you reach me? when you couldnât bare the discomfort, the lasting lightless thoughts. your everyday might not be what your heart screams for. did you sacrifice your dreams for others wellness? just like a brother, i never feared the threat of time. and I never guessed that we would drift so far apart. I canât conceive you point at me as a threat. I would be an obstruction in your pursuit of happiness, I would? around my modest table, an empty chair, waiting for you. I will remain patient, I will keep waiting.
