They spoke of the end
And when it would happen
It's that time again
This time it's for certain
Like lightning's swift hand
The end will come quickly
No time to prepare
Be sure you dig deeply

Have no fear
Now that the end is near
Have no fear

High order prevails
Now you and I suffer
The curtain's unveiled
No comfort can buffer
Just a push away
And we'll all be history
Darkness rules the day
All pain and misery

Life after death I doubt
All life now is forced out
Now is the time to cope with fear
Nothingness will exist here

Just a push away
And we will be history
Darkness rules the day
Consumed by death and misery

Have...no fear
