It was the birth of my darkside
Uncertainty in the air
Wanting to take a chance
Suppress my fear of the dare

I choose to live a life of pain
Refuse - instead I live insane

[Chorus:]
Darkside - the violence runs red 
The evil curse is everywhere
I'd rather be dead

Darkside - the violence runs red 
The evil curse is everywhere
I'd rather be:

Just what I needed
Something to change my life
It makes no difference
How I make up my mind

I choose to live a life of pain
Refuse - instead I live insane

[Chorus x2]

(Dark) Darkness finds its way inside me (Side)
(Dark) Don't think I will ever change (Side)
(Dark) Look outside it's growing darker (Side)
(Dark) A reflection of myself (Side)

(Dark) Darkness finds its way inside me (Side)
(Dark) Don't think I will ever change (Side)
(Dark) Look outside it's growing darker (Side)
(Dark) A reflection of myself (Side)

And now my heart's black
And that's the way it will stay
There's nothing better
There's no other way

I choose to live a life of pain
Refuse - instead I live insane

[Chorus x2]
