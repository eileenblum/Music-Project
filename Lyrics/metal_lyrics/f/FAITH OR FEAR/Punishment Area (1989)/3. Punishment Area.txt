Leaves of green do not exist
Just those condemned to death
Don't complain or shake your fist
Your life is up at best

[Spoken:]
Warning: You have just entered the punishment area. 
Here you will pay for all the anguish you have put others through
During your life here on earth.
There will be no hope and no relief
Only discomforts exists in Hell

[Chorus:]
You have just entered the Punishment Area
And I promise you will not come back
You cannot depend on me to take care of you
Life as you once knew has turned to:

Darkness fills up my soul
Please help me now, dear God
Free to be, but not to choose
No second chance. Too late

[Chorus]

Sin is a price that you must pay
It hears not what you have to say
You are trash. It throws you away
So if you have the deep desire
To spend your afterlife in fire
Do what you wish until you die

Sin is a price that you must pay
It hears not what you have to say
You are trash. It throws you away

[Chorus]
