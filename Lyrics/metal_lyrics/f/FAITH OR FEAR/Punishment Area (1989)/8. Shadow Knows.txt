Late at night, you hear the footsteps behind you
Is it just imagination, or the devil in disguise?
Deeper in the darkness, don't know what you're getting into
Could it be the apparition, of the fear before your eyes?

[Chorus:]
Black gates of hell, they burn in fire
Fear wraps its fingers around your neck
Your fight is worse than your desire
To watch the shadows disappear 

There in the dark, you're sure there's something lurking
You tell yourself it can't be, don't want to believe
Your fear starts running wild, your heart starts to thrash
Before it gets the best of you, your mind you must bring back

What evil lurks in minds of man?
The Shadow knows
What evil lurks in minds of man?
The Shadow knows
What evil lurks in minds of man?
The Shadow knows
What evil lurks in minds of man?
The Shadow knows
What evil lurks in minds of man?
Yeah, yes - The Shadow knows

Late at night, you hear the footsteps behind you
Is it just imagination, or the devil in disguise?
Deeper in the darkness, don't know what you're getting into
Could it be the apparition, of the fear before your eyes?

[Chorus x2]
