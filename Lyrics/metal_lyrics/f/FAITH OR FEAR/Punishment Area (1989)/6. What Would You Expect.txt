The government keeps spending
The country's always lending
Supplies out the ass so they can stab us in the back
The stock market falling, while the corporations are sawing
Employees out like deadwood so the profits can increase

Insurance rates increasing, cost of living shoot straights up
Crime is on the rise and the prisons just erupt
This racist shit still with us, war is surely far from gone
If the summit doesn't do it, we'll all be ash and bone

[Chorus:]
Corruption in the government
But what would you expect
Some things will never change
And on this you can surely bet
Tell me where we're heading to Hell
As time runs out, in a deadly battle we fight a losing bout

Another child's abducted, what is it with these nuts
Or a hostage used in blackmail, this push has come to shove
The rich keep getting richer and the poor they just die off
If we can't help each other, our time is surely lost

Insurance rates increasing, cost of living shoot straights up
Crime is on the rise and the prisons just erupt
This racist shit still with us, war is surely far from gone
If the summit doesn't do it, we'll all be ash and bone

[Chorus]

Destroy the ozone with chemicals
Our food and water get the same
You say you're gonna clean it up now
Your hypocrisy becomes so lame
