Yah!

Lots of things in life that I like but I hate you
Seems you only bitch and moan
When there's other things to do you waste my time
Why don't you leave me alone?
The world would be a better place if you were dead
Place the gun up to your head

[Chorus:]
You can't help the fact that you're so stupid
Every word you say is utter crap
Brainless, senseless, thoughtless common idiot
Why don't you just shut your trap?

Better stay away from me cause I'm not safe
Might reach out and grab your neck
Seems you just don't know, seems you don't understand
You had better take control
Watch your every move, you better watch your step
Someone buries you alive

[Chorus]

Brainless, senseless, thoughtless common idiot
Why don't you just shut your trap?
Right now!
