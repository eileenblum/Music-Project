He sees you coming and he knows what you've got
He'll take it all
He feels no guilt, he shows no mercy
When he hears the call
Draw his attention and his eyes
Out of his sockets
He zeroes in on the cash
That's in your back pockets

Ripoff has on thing in mind
He'll take off with your cash 
Behind your back, he'll rip you blind, as you will find
The ripoff is never kind

[Chorus:]
Ripoff - Has one thing in mind
Ripoff - Attacks from behind
Ripoff - One thing in mind
Ripoff - Rips you blind

Just when you think you know him well
You realize that you can't tell him apart
The ripoff takes on many forms
He strikes you down and never warns, a thief at heart
Take my advice or pay a heavy price for your ignorance
Pay close attention or you'll be flat broke, no coincidence

Ripoff has on thing in mind
He'll take off with your cash 
Behind your back, he'll rip you blind, as you will find
The ripoff is never kind

[Chorus]

You die!

With all the money the ripoff makes
The ripoff will do just what it takes
To see that you'll be fooled again
He'll rip you blind until the end
