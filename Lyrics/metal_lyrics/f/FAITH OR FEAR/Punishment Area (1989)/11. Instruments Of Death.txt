Welcome to your life of concentration
The killing has just begun
Another disposable creation
There is no place to run
Electrodes are attached around your body
Needles are injected in your skin
Disrupted life expectancy
No spirit, no soul, no sin

[Chorus:]
Instruments of death are cutting through your mind
Exposing a disease you thought was hard to find
No one ever said that life would be so kind
With instruments of death

As part of this routine examination
He'll force you to relax and to unwind
Slicing into your imagination
All positive emotions left behind
Behold - The deadly doctor's scalpel 
As it cuts into your brain
A victim of worthless anesthesia
You die in pain - no gain

[Chorus x2]
