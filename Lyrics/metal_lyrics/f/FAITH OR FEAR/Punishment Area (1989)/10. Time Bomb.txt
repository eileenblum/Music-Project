Demented individuals, children of remorse
Lashing out destruction, terror takes its course
Slay their mortal innocence, for they stand in the way
What cannot wait 'til tomorrow will be destroyed today

[Chorus:]
Time bomb, ticking in your face
Make a sudden move, and watch it blow apart the place 
Time bomb, deadly from the start
Believe that the intention is to blow this place apart

Spread the fear, upon other nations
Threatening, increasing frustrations
Acting out of cowardice, it's the only way they can
Explosives give them power, taking lives of other men

[Chorus]

Who will bear the cross
Careless sense of loss
All life crushed to dust
Killing fills their lust
Hatred clouds their eyes
Rancid death loud cries

Total annihilation, never ending death
Crushing helpless people, smothering last breaths
Taking lives not given, as if they had control
They're the ones who will decay in Hell's eternal hole
We're given equal power, which we should not abuse
Their self-destructive hatred shall cause the world to lose
