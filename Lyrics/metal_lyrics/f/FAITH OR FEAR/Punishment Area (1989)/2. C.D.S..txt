Deadly substance has you out of control
Just one more step and you're six feet in a hole
Cripples your body and destroys your head
C.D.S. will leave you maimed or dead

Play the game and lets see who wins
If you wanna play, you'll pay for your sins
Fuck around, and you'll soon be admitted
Take a chance and forever in Hell you're committed

[Chorus:]
C.D.S. You can't tell
Just one shot
Straight to Hell

Deadly substance has you out of control
Just one more step and you're six feet in a hole
Cripples your body and destroys your head
C.D.S. will leave you maimed or dead

Now's the time to make up your mind
Steer in the direction, that will help you to find
There is more, to life than substance abuse
Life is far too short, put what you have to use

[Chorus]

Just one shot and you're dead
Life and death will be served
You will face, all the sins you've committed

Just one shot and you're dead
Life and death will be served
Take a chance and you will
Pay with, your life, you'll die
