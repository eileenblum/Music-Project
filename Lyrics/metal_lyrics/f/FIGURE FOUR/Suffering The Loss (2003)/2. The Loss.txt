So long. Leave me memories. I'd rather think of better moments. I've come this far and realized things are never gonna change
unless you face. Just face it. Face and overcome what breaks you.

Would you steal my heart and turn it into stone? Kill my hope and make a mockery? Watch me form into a person that I always said
and always thought I'd never be. I thought I'd never be.

Is this worth it? Don't you live your whole life in questioning? Don't you live your whole life in suffering. Suffering the
loss. So cold. Inside my head I could hear your words. Though I'm a skeptic. All my life I've made myself reject it. Now I see
something. I'd give my everything just to taste the world. I'd give my everything just to taste the world. This world I see.
