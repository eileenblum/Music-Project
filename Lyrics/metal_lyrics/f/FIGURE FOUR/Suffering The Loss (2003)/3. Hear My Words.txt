I could scream the words, you'd never hear anything I say. See the sweat drip from your head. I see right through your nervous
smile. I see through you now. You don't wanna hear. Because you've known all the while. Keep it in the dark. You've known this
all the while.

Well I've seen it before, but I never really noticed till now. I know something's twisted.

And I could never quite understand why. I see through you know. You always knew the words. Will you ever understand?
