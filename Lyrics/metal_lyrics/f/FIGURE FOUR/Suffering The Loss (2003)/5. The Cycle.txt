It tastes so bitter sweet and I know everything it can do. Push and pull. You're taking me. Pushing me close to the edge. Solely
known for what is done. Break the cycle. Turn away. It tasted so bitter sweet, but I know everything it can do.

All the times I felt so cold. Did it ease the pain? My stomach left in knots and all I feel is pain. My head. A scattered mess.
My world's a scattered mess. Can I turn away? It tastes so bitter sweet but I know everything it can do.

I know I've seen what you can do, but I'll face this choice once again. There is nothing left to give away.

It tastes so bitter sweet and I know everything it can do. Push and pull. You're taking me. Pushing me close to the edge. All
the times I felt so cold. Will I ever break this hold? It tastes so bitter sweet but I know everything it can do.

I know, I've seen what you can do. But I'll face this choice once again.
