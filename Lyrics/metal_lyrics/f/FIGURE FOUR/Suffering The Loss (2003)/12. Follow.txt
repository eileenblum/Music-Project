Here I am. Again, I spoke too soon. Intentions made unclear. My words aren't coming out right. Caught up in a moment. That
moment flew right by. But it changed everything. Now there's a new direction to follow.

And time went on.

I had just one decision and it changed my world. I made just one decision and it changed everything.

It could be actions. It could be words. It could be thoughts. We never think of the small. The small things. Everything counts.
And still I find I don't stop. I'll make a choice without thought and I move along. Forward. Everything counts.

I could be the one who lives in fear. One who never takes the chance. Where would I be today? Living a life always scared of
consequence. Where would I be today? I think for me it's balance. I ask myself today...what would I change if I could?

Some things are unforgettable. Never fade away.

I had just one decision and it changed my world. I made just one decision and it changed everything.
