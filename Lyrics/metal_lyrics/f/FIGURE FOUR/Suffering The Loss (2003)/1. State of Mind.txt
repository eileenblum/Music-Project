I can't escape this state of mind. It always stays the same. I fail to believe because nothing ever works out how it should. I
try to believe your words but deep inside it eats me away. So I've learned. I've learned not to trust. It doesn't come so easily.
It doesn't come easy anymore.

So I've learned. Now I've learned

Every time you seem so confident, and every time you reassure me. Trust me now, and I wanna believe. Trust me now, and I still
wanna believe.

Now I take it on. Now I take too much on myself.

Every time you seem so confident, and every time you re-assure me. Trust me now, and I wanna believe. Trust me now, and I still
wanna believe. I still want to believe you. This state of mind holding me back.
