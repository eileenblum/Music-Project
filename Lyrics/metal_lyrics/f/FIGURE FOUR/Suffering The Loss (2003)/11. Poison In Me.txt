I can't tell day from night anymore. I think I'm lost. I remember a time when I could see, with you in my sight. I can't forget
it, but something's spreading in my head. How far can I go? Will it ever be too late?

All the pain inside. They put the poison in me. All the pain I saw. They put the poison in me. All the pain inside. They put the
poison in me. All the pain I caused. Poison in me.

I saw everything they did. Somehow it seemed true. I took in everything they gave somehow it seemed true.

How far can I go 'til it's too late? How far can I go. Til it's too late?

All the pain inside me. They put the poison in me. All the pain I saw. They put the poison in me. All the pain inside. They put
the poison in me. All the pain I caused. They put this poison in me.
