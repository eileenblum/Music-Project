I am the liar. I've sown the seed. I only came to hurt you. But I never let it show. I am trapped inside with no escape. This is
my faithless world. Here I feel like a king. My beauty skin deep. Just enough to keep you fooled. I've blurred the lines of right
and wrong. Reality.

Your weakness I see. Though weakness, it's in me. I've found an open door. Now I know your weakness. I finally see your
weakness. Don't take this.

This is not how it ends. Don't you fall to the lies. He'll steal everything you love. He'll kill your heart and mind. Fear of
those who believe. The name will strike him down. Realize and recognize. This is reality.

Don't try to pass off what you can't see. Sent out to destroy. Sent out to kill and deceive.

One thing still remains, you liar.
