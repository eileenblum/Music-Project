Where have we gone? What have we created ourselves. Indecision plagues our mind. Indecision. This is our world. And when a
stance is taken, it's always written off. No one wants to listen. It's always written off. I don't have all the answers, but I
have a few. Still I'm in constant battle. Honestly I can't just write this off.

Lost and cold. A generation lost and cold. Indecision. This is our world.

I know I'll see the day. The hour is in question. I wait for it to come, and there will be no more questions. The answer will be
clear. I know I'll see the day.
