There is nothing left but ashes on this ground. Sometimes it's hard to believe it's all gone. Never thought I'd fall like this.
All the work that we put in here. Here we stood so proud. Now it doesn't matter. It's all gone. Never thought I'd fall like this.

It burns.

The end began just when we thought we were invincible and there's no way I'm ever going back.

There's no way I'm going back to how it was back then. Too many times I tried living in the past. Too many times I tried and
failed. I tried and failed.
