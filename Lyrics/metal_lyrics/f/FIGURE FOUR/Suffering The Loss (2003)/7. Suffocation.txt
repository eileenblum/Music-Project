This suffocation is killing me. It's killing me. Suffocation. One breath is all I need for strength to set myself free. I think
I'm losing hope. I'm losing time. They always tell me, don't waste your time. Darkness surrounds. I promise to never...never
forget why

This is not your war.

I will never ever forget why I even try to take the little that I have, and turn it into something more. Something worth the
pain. I promise to never ever forget why. Because it means so much more to me than anyone can see.

I heard the stories told. They always held me back. Because doubt is in the best of us. The stories always set me back. So much
for stories told. They only held me back. Defeat could break the best of us. It's stories always set me back.

This suffocation killing me.

Suffocation, one breath is all I need to. One breath is all I need for strength to set myself free. Don't let me destroy myself.
