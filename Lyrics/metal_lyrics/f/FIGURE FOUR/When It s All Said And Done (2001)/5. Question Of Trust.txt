Redemption is something that's so hard to gain. What is friendship when the trust is lacking. Where if the line drawn. Too late
it's already been crossed. Can this be taken back. Is this the bitter end. Would you throw it all away. It hurts to even say I
forgive. This hate can burn what's left of you. Redemption is somthing that's so hard to gain. These wounds cut deep but to dwell
on them would be so worthless and all you'd find is bitterness. Can this be taken back. These wounds cut so deep.
