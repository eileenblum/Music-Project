Go cover up you track. Another lie goes around. Another lie spewed from your mouth. You took your shot at me but I gave it all I
had. In the end I'll rise above and you'll meet your destiny. This is your destiny. Everyday I face the world I feel you on my
back whispering another lie to throw me off my track. I learn from my mistakes and I know that I'm forgiven. My strength comes
from above.
