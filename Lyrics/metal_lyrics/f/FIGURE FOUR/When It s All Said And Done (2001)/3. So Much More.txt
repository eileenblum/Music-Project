Never did I claim to be what I'm not. Never did I try to tell you that I though you should be or think or act a certain way.
Still I stood by my beliefs. I'm just trying to be real in spite of everything that I must face. That's all I can be. It's who I
am. Myself. It's all I can be. So far we've come this far. And I know how we've come this far. Through thick and thin with all
our differences. This is what I call commitment. No room for tragedy so I'll tell you how it is so you'll know how I see things.
I'll speak my mind and I know you'll speak yours. But will you ever have a clue how much your opinion means to me.
