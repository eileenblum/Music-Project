These misconceptions have proved to be wrong. Is it a mistake to go against the grain. Do you make up your mind based on what
you can see. Here I stand. I'm guilty of the same crime. Judgment's not our right and not our role to decide. From just one look
and you've made up you mind. Now I will take the time to step out and make amends. These misconceptions have proved me wrong.
