Born into this life. Where's my direction. Given the freedom to make these choices for myself. I face deception and I face
temptation. I'll face theses things every single day until the time I leave this world behind. I don,t know the time I will go
and it's not for me decide. The things I thought never would happen to me. I just realize that it's not in my hands. Second
chances I can't exepct and I won't expect. When it's all said and done I will live. I could die toworrow so now I'll live for
today. I'll try to live my live so that I'll never wish I had a second chance.
