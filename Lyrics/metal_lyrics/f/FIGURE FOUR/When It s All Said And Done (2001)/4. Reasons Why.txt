My world was crashing down and I had lost all reason. I turned from side to side looking for excuses to blame you. I questioned
all this. Though out my reasons. Are you right or am I wrong. I want it all laid out. I want it all. Without a chance to expect a
thing. Without a voice you said it so clear. You made a mark that took me surprise. My world in pieces and I stood beside myself
when you put it all back. Put things in perspective. I finally see all of these things clear as day.
