Don't tell me you have bravery if you haven't felt this thing called fear. Now is the time to attack and I won't look back. I'll
fight this war. To face my fears. Where is the war. In my mind my flesh and in my soul. I fight the lies they put against me and
they're left exposed with their true colors in the light. Nothing you can say could take what's inside.
