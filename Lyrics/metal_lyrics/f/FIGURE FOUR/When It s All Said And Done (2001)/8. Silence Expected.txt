This wasn't something new but I couldn't let it go. All the times that you had fell into this trap you call home. Silence was so
necessary and it wouldn't break. So much hatred you've come to know. Always think of the past carried with you. How long will
this last. Some might say that things today are better than we don't see above the surface. Silence expected. It's all we know.
Is this silence so necessary. Will it ever break. Will you accept everything that you're told and just say. Leave it alone.
