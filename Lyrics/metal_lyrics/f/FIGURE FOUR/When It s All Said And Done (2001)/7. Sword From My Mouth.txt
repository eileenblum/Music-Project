Sword from my mouth. A tongue of fire. Watch what you say. Make sure it counts. To quick to talk and to judge. Now your hand's
held on your mouth. The walls keep getting thin and the rumor mill goes around. These words they are so strong but you don't
realize how much they mean. And they're said so constantly without a thought of ever looking out of for those around you. Shallow
words said without question.
