Tear down the walls you create when you claim to have an open mind. My message is what I believe in this lifeless world that we
now live in. How could I keep this freedom I have from you. Salvation. It is yours to embrace. I heard the words you said. We
don't belong. You try to shoves us out of this hardcore scene. It's yours. It's mine. We share the same stage. And I am here to
stay. I can see all to clear. Another day I'll be here. Now's the time to realize we are not the enemy. I am not of you but I'm
not you. I'm here for you. I'll be here beside you.
