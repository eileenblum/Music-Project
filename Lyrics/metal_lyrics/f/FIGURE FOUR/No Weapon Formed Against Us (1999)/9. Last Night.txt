Bragging about last night
But you don't even remember her name
Just a number, they're all the same
It's not a game that you play
Do you think of the hurt
Do you think of the consequences
All the lies that you said
It's not a game that you play
She'll be left there all alone
You said that you would never go
The piece of heart that she gave away
The piece of shit that you threw away
All alone
