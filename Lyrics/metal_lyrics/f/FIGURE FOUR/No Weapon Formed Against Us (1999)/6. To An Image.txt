Living up to an image
Easier said then done
Where it took him was nowhere
Always on the run
From the one who was knocking on his door
Take his weight off his back
Won't you take it away
Give up the pride you had
The security you never had
Not for me, but for yourself
Full circle, you turned around
Take this weight
