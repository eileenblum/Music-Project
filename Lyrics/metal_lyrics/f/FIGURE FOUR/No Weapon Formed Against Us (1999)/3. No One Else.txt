As I see their faith
I'm growing stronger with time
Some never had a chance
Their lives were taken away
Everything they had
They stood the true test of faith
And won't back down
I'll go from where they left off
And I will see it through
The media's lies can't cover the truth
Our lives, they are our sacrifice
Already died to self
I live for no one else
Where they left off
