Standing there, life going nowhere

I can't believe this
Wasting life, all this time
You can't see the truth I know
Call me ignorant, but I'm not alone
I have faith in God and won't quit
'til the seed is sown
I try to be a witness day by day
Sometimes, it's hard
With Christ's help I will spread the word
Holding back
I look into your eyes but
I can't see the fire
That you once possessed
That you once knew
Pride is why you're holding back
Torn behind heart and mind
A child lost, calling out
In this world far from home
