Threatened by the storm
Trying to take what's mine
Trying to drag me down
You won't succeed
With Christ on my side
I will overcome
I will identify in the Lord forever true
I will not walk away
I will not back away
Time and again
I will struggle in my life
You'll be by my side
Throughout the thick and thin
No weapon formed against
us will prosper
You can't take me out
You can try but you will see
I'll break through this wall
That tries to stop me
