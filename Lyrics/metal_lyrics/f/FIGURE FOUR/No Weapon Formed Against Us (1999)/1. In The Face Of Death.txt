You had all the fucking answers
How could one compare
Everything you told us
The things we all believed
Where we went wrong
Take all control and power
Leave the world in awe
Take in everything, word you breath out
Blinding all our eyes
Take this from me
So that I can see
As the world mocks me
I won't go their way
I'll stand my ground
And be a witness
I won't be controlled
By this worldly power
Taker of lives
I won't be controlled by this world
I won't be controlled
By this worldly power
In the face of death
I will hold close
My strength, my life
The one God
I won't deny
Don't be fooled by their works
Walk in the path of light
