I'd been locked down for years
I'd been locked, locked down
In a cage for years
Didn't know what free meant
Couldn't find the key
Massed off for guilt as pitting for myself
Where did that get me?
It got me not too far
I remember times I had
Didn't know myself
Or the one who set me free
The one who had the key
I could barely make out the face
That put life in this shell
I remember times I had
The days without my faith
All the answers that I thought were lost
Brought before my eyes when I asked
Answers when I ask
They lift me up
Answers I received
And you won't let my fall
Don't let me fall down
