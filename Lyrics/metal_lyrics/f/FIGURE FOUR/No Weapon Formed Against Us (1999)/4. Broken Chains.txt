I'm not saved by the things I do
I give my life to you now
Wash me in your blood
I accept you in my life
Broken chains
I am no longer strapped down
You'll never turn your back
All that time
Walked down the endless road
Always made no sense
Trying to make it on my own
Thought I could do it all alone
Just a man, don't know it all
I reached out and you
put out your hand
On that day you gave me life
On that day you made me new
And I won't forget your promise
Rejection is to spit in your face
Denying you by the world I say
I'm proud to say that I do believe
I want the world to know!
