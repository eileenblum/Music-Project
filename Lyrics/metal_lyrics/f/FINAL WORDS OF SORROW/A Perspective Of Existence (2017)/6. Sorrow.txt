We walked silent
Side by side
A starless sky
To remember
Can feel no warmth
Can feel no more
Lifeless eyes
Fixed to the void

In the sky my damnation
A burden of no relief
A rain that pierce
Through my skin

I find shelter in pain
Yet the truth of these scars
Mean nothing
As time delivers lethe

Can feel no warmth can feel no more
Lifeless eyes fixed to the void

A blood stain
A sovereign
This dusty room
A dive in vain

I am the seed of pain
Tears that will not dry
I am forlorn scar
A shadow from the past

A wet grave
Eternal bale
I am the pain
I am the rain.
