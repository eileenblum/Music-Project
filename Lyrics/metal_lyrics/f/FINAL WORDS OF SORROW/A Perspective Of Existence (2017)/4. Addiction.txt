Pierce
Right through my flesh
As I'm searching for purpose
In my vapid existence

A veil of darkness around my eyes
As shadows emerge to reject anything but you

Deep
(inside me)
Come
(I need to feel)
Bleed
(I offer to you)
Drain
(My every last drop)

Deeper, deeper, there is no end
You can't hold back anymore
The seed has grown, you can't understand
The harm will never be

Undone

To find a meaning
I turn to you
For as long as I live
You will never leave me

No regrets, no lies
There is no return
For I left myself behind
Giving me to you

...And I seek no forgiveness
For when I taste your essence
The stars fall asleep and time is no more
I'd only wish that the moment would last forever...

Craving, finding, piercing
Inject and take my mind
Away, absent, lost and
Longing for no return

Waking, panicked, weakened
The circle's starting over
Craving, finding, piercing
It's (too) late I'm close to the end
