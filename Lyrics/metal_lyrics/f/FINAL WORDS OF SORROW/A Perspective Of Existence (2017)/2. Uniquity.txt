Am I one of a kind?
(therefore) Am I alone?

Does anyone see
The things I see
(has misery clouded me?)
Is everyone blind
Or am I insane?
(Is my mind still intact?)

Has misery clouded
My thoughts
(does anyone see the things I see? Or)
Am I not yet
Lobotomized

A king of myself?
Enslaved by my mind?
I will never know

Accept such existence

Accept my bane

An egocentric view
A failure to comprehend
My insignificance
In this nonsensical

Vanity

Unwanted
Rejected
Rejector
Loved and hated by

None
