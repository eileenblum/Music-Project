The fetus cries
Forced into existence
The world admires
Infecting its drear disease

Denied
The choice
Of tranquility
And peace of mind

A scapegoat made of flesh
For a degenerate cunt
A curse cast
From an impotent bastard

Denied
The joy
The dignity
Of nothingness

Why am I
Sentenced to wither
For another's crime

Denied
The choice
Of tranquility
And peace of mind

The fetus cries
As it drowns in its blood

Why?
