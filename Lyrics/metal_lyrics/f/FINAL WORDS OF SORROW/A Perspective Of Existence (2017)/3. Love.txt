In you I see the sun
Raining light on me
In you I find myself
Trying to crawl out of the dark

Yet I drown in the thought of our love
The blade craves for my blood

A chill right down my spine
Every time we touch

Our names carved in the blade
Whose heart shall be torn?
I'd die for you, yet you stand still
Your beauty I can't stand

Look me in the eye
A mix of love and hate
While our bodies twist as one
The blade is pushed in your heart

...is pushed in your heart

We kiss for the last time
As your hands weaken

Touching the scars we put on ourselves
The blade cuts both ways
Both of our names written on it
Yet the grave fits only one

In you I see the moon
Pale and cold you are
In you I find pain
The one I was looking for

Yet I drown in the thought of our love
The blade craves for more blood..
