Staring upon the grave of my mind
Long after I killed
Everything dear to me
A desperate attempt to
Recreate my life

Locked in the past
I left my self blind
Driven backwards to the future
Remorseful abject and lost

Staring into the illusion of light

I strive
To no longer
Feel endless
Pain

I stare at the sun
Yet no warmth ever reaches my face
Still I give not heaven for lost
For I'm bound to the corpse of a rotten memory

Letters sent
But none has returned
I pray and pray
I rot in disdain

A dead end
So much to pretend
As I stand, a sigh
In front of you

Averting the absence light
Its memory haunts me still
Dreaming of planes where joy forever dwells
