I waited this for all my life
I lust for this, deep deep inside

I feel cold
Life at last it slips away
The greatest fear of 'em all
Life was not meant to be forever

My blood slowly moves
Through my veins
A bitter cold
Like all ends seem like
Light fades
Like curtains fall to sleep inside
A taste of metal
To dry my mouth
And die

Pain
Just leave me with the pain
The paradox of existence
The walls of emptiness

Darkness
I come to you
As the waves sink me deeper
A torrent of death

Life was not meant to be forever
I feel cold
Light fades
Darkness
I come to you

I know the meaning of this
And my last thoughts inside this damaged body
Give a spark at my hazy eyes
And manifest the glory of death

I am the seed that grows to the end
I am a tree that's cut to burn
I am a leaf floating on smoke
A shadow walking beyond time.

And in the moments of our agony
Who is the bravest?
Who is worthy of such a treasure?
Elysium for the sleepless souls

I am the seed that grows to the end
I am a tree that's cut to burn
I am a leaf floating on smoke
A shadow walking beyond time
