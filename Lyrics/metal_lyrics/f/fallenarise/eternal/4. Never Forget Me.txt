Tie my rope, I really don't care anymore;
I cannot feel it around my neck.

One crystal world; shattered, empty and cold;
Nothing embraces nothing.

I know it's hard, being my part;
To feel the same, to be my shape

I saw the shine, I walked the line; now I am empty.
And everything divine is changing; capturing, haunting my dreams.
I left my Fate, as you can see, before She abandoned me.
For all these things I'll always be, never forget me.

Sometimes it's better in the dark;
There you can see nothing,
But you can wish for anything.

I saw the shine, I walked the line; now I am empty.
And everything divine is changing; capturing, haunting my dreams.
I left my Fate, as you can see, before She abandoned me.
For all these things I'll always be, never forget me.
