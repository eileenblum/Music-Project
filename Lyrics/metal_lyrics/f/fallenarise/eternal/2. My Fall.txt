But something kills my dawn.
My hope is locked, you hold the key;
One passion costs a death.

For those about to feel;
Forever live in Hell.
Everytime a song is born,
I die once more.

Please take me with you and teach me to forget
All the years of emptiness.
My fall is my passion; this passion burned inside of me
But never lived.

I'll bring every star
To light up your loneliness.
Every single day,
A hope in finding you.

A hope in finding me,
Finding little child's dream
And make it all come true.

Please take me with you and teach me to forget
All the years of emptiness.
My fall is my passion; this passion burned inside of me
But never lived.

You'll find your hope in me,
I'll find my hope in you;
You'll never be alone.

If you cut me with your knife,
I'll bleed forever for you.
In my blood you'll find yourself;
In my verse the most of my desires.
