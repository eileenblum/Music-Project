One day I woke up from a sound,
I stood up fast, I looked around;
I saw my life turn to a dream.

You'll never sleep alone, my dear,
I am your nightmare and your fear;
At every step I'll be your shadow.

All hopes born under the bless of the Nightfall,
All hopes die when Daylight comes.

Heaven's away, far away,
Winter covers the blue.
If I had one wish, I'd wish to change them all.
Upon my skin I wait to feel one more time
Your fallen arise and a death
That I always longed for.

Forever you but never me,
Within my thoughts starting your dreams;
I want to sail back to my home.

A silent puppet in your show,
I was played but never heard;
I wish the curtains come close to me.

All hopes born under the bless of the Nightfall,
All hopes die when Daylight comes.

Heaven's away, far away,
Winter covers the blue.
If I had one wish, I'd wish to change them all.
Upon my skin I wait to feel one more time
Your fallen arise and a death
That I always longed for.
