Wakes up from the haunting dream;
Sent every night, as We deem.
Tears on his cheeks, blood on his hands;
Searing pain that never ends.

Hard though he tries, he can't recall
What resulted in his fall.
It was treason, murder, war;
Through his mind Erinyes soar.

Tried in vain to take it all back;
Relentless Furies attack.
Unyielding claws, they daily sip
The sanity I strive to keep.

Cannot erase your heinous deeds,
Endlessly reaping their very seeds.
We'll never leave you as you stand,
Until you perish by your hand.

Megare, Alecto, Tisiphone;
For your sins you shall atone.
We will take what's left inside
Your once cunning, glorious mind.

Erinyes won't leave you in peace,
Pious Death won't grant His kiss.
Three as one, three as a whole,
We have come to claim your soul.

Tried in vain to take it all back;
Relentless Furies attack.
Unyielding claws, they daily sip
The sanity I strive to keep.

Cannot erase your heinous deeds,
Endlessly reaping their very seeds.
We'll never leave you as you stand,
Until you perish by your hand.
