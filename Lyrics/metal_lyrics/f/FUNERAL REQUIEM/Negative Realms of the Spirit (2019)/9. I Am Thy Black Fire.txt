Death's desire conquers all human kind
Desolation and murder will triumph
In the nighttime burning dead bodies
As sweltering candles guiding the path,
When the night sky stains in deep black
And the filth and lewdness blast the cycle of life
Many wolves are thirsty of blood
And unleashed are seeking what they have lost

Oh!
I am thy fire
Coming from the shadows
Released from the abyss,
Bestial incarnation
Horned one desire
Sulphur and damnation
Have awaken the empire,
Sanctuaries of darkened gods
Cruelty driven far beyond
Altar of a broken past
Pest is spreading as you die,
Homage for a faked faith
Human kind's addiction
Rotting priests of Satan
Deadliest satisfaction!

Burned coffins assembling the twilight
Symbolism of lowest, end of human race
No more sunlight no more betrayals
Entering, embracing the seven gates of hell,
Mourning voices undivine almighty
Sacrifice the holy life of men
Drifting madness obscuring the mind
Satan's kingdom ending the divine.

Evil arises
From within
Darker ages
Hail the horns!

Eternal prophecy of darkness
Armageddon approaching the end of life
Pagan fire blasphemy enthroned
All the feelings drowning in the void.

Endless agony
Bless of pain
Under the moonlight

Burning soul.
