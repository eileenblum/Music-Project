Freezing wind is burning
As the day no longer rises
Flashing echoes rumbling in my mind
They're commanding me to kill,

As I look into the mirror
Blackened eyes of my soul
In the night of decaying self
I'm still waiting for death to come,

Covered in filthy curses
Dragged to undying despair
Emptiness is growing once more
I feel our end so close,

Ah!
I will leave sooner than late
Yeah!
Abysmal decrepit soul
Ah!
Do you feel the freezing cold
Yeah!
Abysmal decrepit soul

In the middle of the fog
I was raised on the cold
To the gospel of my death
I shall pray forever
I shall pray forever

We should die together!
