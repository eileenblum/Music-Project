Black spells, of the upcoming reign
Summoning the shadows through the grimoire
Open, the gates of hell
The entrance of evil covered in blood
Pentagram is burning for thy sacrifice
Drink from the unholy chalice the gore
The dagger will seal the black pact
For thy supremacy to rule the earth

Now the astral legions come
The worship of gods is fading away
Mistiness is growing from inside out
The gloom in the moonlight will show us the path

All hell break lose

Coming from the darkened glimmer
Feeding my desire
Human kind extinction
Death in napalm fire

Seeking in my dreams the stream of nightfall
Creation evocates the evil entities
Surrounding black candles stained in black fire
I call thy supreme black angel of death
Suffering and coldness presiding the world
The great whore unleashed the bestial rage
Forced to exist in the middle of decadence
I astral project the soul

Hallucinations at midnight
Starting to open the graves
Drink from the vessel the blood
Embracing the grace of hell!

Borderlines of evil
Seeking for the end

Now the astral legions come
The worship of gods is fading away
Mistiness is growing from inside out
The gloom in the moonlight will show us the path
Banned from heaven your essence ripped off
Enchanted by madness tear your soul apart
Now the rope is tied,
I refuse to live!
Suffering and coldness presiding the world
The great whore unleashed the bestial rage
Forced to exist in the middle of decadence
I astral project the soul

Astral dark dimensions!
