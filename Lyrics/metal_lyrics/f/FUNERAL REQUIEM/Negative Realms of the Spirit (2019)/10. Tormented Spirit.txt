Dead from the underworld
It comes to lead the hordes
Eradicating all living forms
And the Christian illusion,
Filthy life must fail
Suffocated by its own demise
Sanity is dying
Sinking its own core from inside out,

Demons ascending
From the deep abyss
Eternal black flame
Shall conquer all,
Decease of the faith
Unholy devotion
Mystified cult
Of Satan's realm,

Tormented spirit
Refusing to see the light
Meet the supremacy
At the altar of sacrifice
Malignant existence
Redemption of souls
Summoning the essence
Of the scorned hell spawn.

Haunted incarnation!

Ah!
Spectral revelation, a cursed spirit
Wandering the unknown dissonant paths
Trapped in this plane can't rest in peace

From the purgatory has been neglected!
