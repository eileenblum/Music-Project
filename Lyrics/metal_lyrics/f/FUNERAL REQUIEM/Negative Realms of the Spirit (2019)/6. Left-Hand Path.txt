Cosmic spell
Mortal's illusion
Dead's eyes mesmerized
Fall in the abyss,
Eternal fire
Suffocating the believers
Serpent's tongue
Guide me with your mercy,

I shall pass through the light
Towards the underworld
Infinite wrath of hell
Dawn of the satanic mass.

Demonic depth
A seed of evil.

The mind
Of the eternal one
Illumination
At the ritual
Processions of damnation
Invoking Baphomet

Tyranny's empire
Divide and conquer all
Satan's embodiment
And the demon's wrath
Hate and defiance
Revenge is in my veins
Sacrifice the Christians

All hail the Antichrist!
