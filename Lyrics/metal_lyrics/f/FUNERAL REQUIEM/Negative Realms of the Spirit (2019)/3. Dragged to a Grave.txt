So ill
So cold
The wraith
I am
Extinction flowing in my head,
My way
To draw
Myself
Away
An angel fallen from the sky.

My heart is blackened to the core,
Death has no mercy
From within
I die
Heaven's damnation
Exiled from light.

Dark endless lost soul
From a distant dimension I came
My spirit dead will remain,
Remembrance of funeral dimness
The smell of death in a rose
Mortal fear arises my hatred
Haunting whispers destroying the light.

Condemned and exiled forever from the divine grace,
I forgot the sensation of the air,
No light I see, no future to hope,

In the dark void of emptiness I forever fall!
