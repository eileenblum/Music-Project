The reaper is standing
Upon my grave
The silent forest whispers
Your haunted name
The worms of my perdition
Digging my tomb
An isolated spirit,
Forgotten soul

Dragged to the dark
Down the abyss
Inner pain is coming
To forever stay
In flames I rot
Moaning in vain
End of existence
I shall seek

The scythe of the reaper
Cutting my veins
A dream of suicide
And you're up there.

Between the storm
Killing my self
I must remain

In shores of death.
