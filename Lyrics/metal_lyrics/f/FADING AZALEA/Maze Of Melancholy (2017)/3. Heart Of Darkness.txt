We were all born worth respect and caring
Spend our lives deprived from it
The world is big, people tired of giving
Will die alone in the heart of darkness
Some want to be good
And however hard they try to open new doors
Everything remains the same
People giving the love that everyone's worth
Can speak the truth, growing wise
There's no need to make things bright
There's no need to fool anyone
No fight to hide their inner self
We were all born worth respect and caring
Spend our lives deprived from it
The world is big, people tired of giving
Will die alone in the heart of darkness
Some people don't know where they are
Acting like a spoiled child
Seeing people without seeing them
People stealing the respect due to their brothers
Stealing the truth, selling lies
To protect theirselves or to shield you
Lack of moral or empathy?
Lies never soothe the need for truth
Lies never fill the need for love

We were all born worth respect and caring
Spend our lives deprived from it
The world is big, people tired of giving
Will die alone in the heart of darkness
I know time steals my respect and caring
I'll spend my life deprived from it
The world is big, and I'm tired of giving
I'll die alone in the heart of darkness
