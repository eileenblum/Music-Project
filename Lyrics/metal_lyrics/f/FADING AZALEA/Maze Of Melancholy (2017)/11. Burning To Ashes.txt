Getting further from reality
Going deeper in the memory
Cause everything here is futility
I wander on a path I can't even see
I feel so guilty to stay without you
Failing to understand why I should live not you
Don't care how big the world is
I have made my choice to feel and see what I can't have anymore
Oh I can't find a reason to stay here alone
I live but I don't exist
When I see you in my dreams
My arms stretch out and stay empty
I am not in a world
I am in a void
Waiting for a sign
Of you, oh
I can't live but I can't leave
I can't breathe but I can feel
This blade in my heart
This void in my life (this void in my life)

Don't care how big the world is
I have made my choice to feel and see what I can't have anymore
Oh I can't find a reason to stay here alone
I live but I don't exist
When I see you in my dreams
My arms stretch out and stay empty
