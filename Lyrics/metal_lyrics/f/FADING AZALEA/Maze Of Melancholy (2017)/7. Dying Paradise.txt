I feel the rain pouring down on me
It's cleansing me inside.
But all around nothing seems to be cleansed
For all the smoke, acid, and corruption

Give me back the water's purity to resuscitate nature
Give me back the air's purity, the untouched white snow
That covered my garden, some centuries ago
We are leading ourselves to a life in chaos
Thinking too much to our dear busyness
Making choices that only serve ourselves
Closing our eyes, making up lies
Dying paradise
Take me back to the era of innocence
Before the flowers died, before the birds stopped singing
Don't follow the path of egocentrism and destruction
Even if everybody else does, come out of your shell
Open yourself to the world. Make it work
This is my prayer for a better world.
Where together will be the word
This is my wish for the beauty dying
Of the forest, the sea and the life
Make it work. Make it work.
We are leading ourselves to a life in chaos
Thinking too much to our dear busyness
Making choices that only serve ourselves
Closing our eyes, making up lies
Leading to a dying paradise
The price will be high to repay our mistakes
The fall will be far
Will we raise ourselves again?
