A burden took over my spirit
Awaking the pain that slept in the mist
While I was trying to forget
The pieces of the last wreck
My self-image has changed now
I'm not what I thought I was
I don't don't know what to do
I wish I could escape from myself
Run away, sleep, find a solution
Cannot stand that depression
Cannot bear the failure of my life
Cannot see another path
As I lay where I fell
I only feel that hell
And wait for the rain to wash my brain
And wait for the sunshine to warm my heart
My self-image has changed now
I am not what I thought I was
This is the fall of the mask
I see now what I really am
Is it what I really am?
Run away, sleep, find a solution
Cannot stand that depression
Cannot bear the failure of my life
Cannot see another path
As I lay where I fell
I only feel that hell
And wait for the rain to wash my brain
And wait for the sunshine to warm my heart
