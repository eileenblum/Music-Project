You, selfish, disgracious, pathetic, ignorant men
Do you think you are a king to dare
To treat and use people as your puppets
Now the time has come to pay
Watch your blood run
Dance on your grave
Send you to hell in the name of the victims
Of your impunity
Of your egocentrism
Of your prejudice
In the name of justice
The hell bells has rung
The hammer has stroke
The inflamed soulless corpse
Now sucks down in mud
One more mortal disease
From the world disappears
No gain for the sinners
No pain for the offers
