We all lost what we most loved
We all see our dreams fall
And every blink to the past
Will weight in our hearts
That's why every soul has its part of sadness
That tries to hide behind our smiles
That tries to come out sometimes
Only when it is allowed to
Each soul bears a part of darkness
Living in fear, indifference or hate
Each soul has its part of weakness
That leads us to mistake
A shadow behind the soul
It's the way learning goes
It's the way one grows
It's only by accepting errors
That we open ourselves to love
Grandeur lies in smallness, strength hides in weakness
Power hides in love, divinity lies in humanity
Each soul has its part of sadness
Each soul bears a part of darkness
Each soul has its part of weakness
There's a shadow hidden in each soul
Chaque Ã¢me porte une tristesse
Chaque Ã¢me a sa part de pÃ©nombre
Chaque Ã¢me a ses faiblesses
DerriÃ¨re chaque Ã¢me se cache une ombre
