Time to realize, what we have done wrong
Time to realize, together we're strong
Stop to fight and waste all your energy
On things that you should work on accepting
All the shallow words that I come to pass
Leave no shadow on my path
Wisdom is my reward, and when your time's turned
You'll understand your victory was just a fiction
Watch the sentencer that lives in your soul
Cause it will teach you what you need to know
About yourself and your intolerance
Time to accept that you are not perfect
All the shallow words that I come to pass
Leave no shadow on my path
Wisdom is my reward, and when your times has turned
You'll understand your victory was just a fiction
Time to realize what we have done wrong
Time to realize together we're strong
Time to realize you can free yourself
From the mind's chains and expectations
Time to realize, that we are all one
Time to realize, no one needs to lose
Time to realize that you have to choose
Between peace of mind, or might illusion
