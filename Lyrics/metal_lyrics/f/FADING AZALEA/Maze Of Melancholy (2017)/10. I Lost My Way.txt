I lost my way,
Fall into loneliness.
There's nothing to prevent me
Falling into darkness.

Open the door,
I wanna see the dawn of a new day,
I lost my way
Open the door,
I want to see the dawn of a new day,
I lost my way

How did I drift so far away?
Fall into oblivion.
How could I have prevented it all?
Fall into exclusion.
I lost my way

Open the door,
I wanna see the dawn of a new day,
I lost my way
Open the door,
I want to see the dawn of a new day,
I lost my way

Open the door,
I want to see
The dawn of a new day,
I lost my way
So far away
