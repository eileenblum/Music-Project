All alone, buried home
When dusk has fallen down
I cannot sleep, I cannot rest
My soul's gone restless
And all my daydreams
Turns to death dreams
And all I achieved
Erased in grief
Don't try to hide your inner scenes
Don't lie to make up sins
Let your soul shine in the light
You can't bury the past
You can only find life's meaning
By accepting weaknesses
Opened to love, nothing to prove
The time has come to move
The melody of the past years
Now hums inside my ears
When memories and fallen tears
Tore my heart like spears

Don't try to hide your inner scenes
Don't lie to make up sins
Let your soul shine in the light
You can't bury the past
You can only find life's meaning
By accepting weaknesses
Opened to love, nothing to prove
The time has come to move
