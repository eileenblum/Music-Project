Here I am again
Hello incertitude
Here I come again
The land of broken dreams
I'd like to say goodbye
To the things I can't accept
I'd like to see pass by
The broken half of me
Be reborn again
And free from this weight
Here I am again
Incomplete and dreaming
Of accepting my fate
Of accepting myself
For what I failed to do
For what I cannot be
Good enough for me.
I'd like to say good bye
To the things I cannot change
I'd like to see pass by
The injustice of life
Be reborn again
And free from all doubt
Here I am again
Incomplete and dreaming
Of accepting my fate
Of accepting myself
For what I failed to do
For what I cannot be
Good enough for me.
