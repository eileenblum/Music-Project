Here I go alone on colourless paths,
So long from where I belongâ¦
My sorrowful heart, mourning for its land
Is longing for something more
Than this routine life, as prey of falcons
Where freedom is just a word
Take me back, take me back
To the land of snow
Where palaces of ice
Look over the world
Take me back, take me back
To the isle of peace
Where I see the light
Where my mind is free
Where all hearts have learnt to love
Here I go, so lost on the path of grief
So long from where I belong
I need a compass to help me find myself
And find out where I am
I would need your wings to fly far away
Where I am meant to be 
My home is not home anymore
So let me fly away to where I belong,
Where I see the light
Where my mind is free
Where all hearts have learnt to love
