Inevitable consequence of decay portrayed before our eyes.
When everything tangible withers to dust. A universe sentenced to die.

We are the victims of ancient betrayal, bound by mortality.
Now the entire creation longs for release.
When will the robe of extinction be untied? We're facing our demise.

Behold the words once foretold of complete restoration.
The birth of the undying life, descending from the sky.
Redemption is nigh.

Creature of celestial realm, claim your territory. All is reborn under the sun, so take what is yours.

Inherit the new earth...

Behold the words once foretold of complete restoration.
The birth of the undying life, descending from the sky.
Redemption is nigh.
