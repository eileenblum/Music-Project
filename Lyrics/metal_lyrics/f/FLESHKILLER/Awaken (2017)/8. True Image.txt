True image. Sustainer of the universe. Mighty and powerful.

Every knee shall bow. Every tongue will confess: You are the Holy One.
All creation sing of the glory You bring. You are the Holy One.

True image. The boundless one, the first and last. King of eternity.
True image. The lover of my soul You are. Wonderful counsellor.

Living One. You hold the keys of death.
Royal blood. You shed for all mankind.
The Alpha. Before all things You were.
Omega. After all Youâll still reign.

You have given what I canât reciprocate.
Mercy enduring for that which I lack.
A grace surreal. Freedom sublime.

Son of Man, You emptied out Yourself.
Forever, Your throne engulfed in praise.

A grace surreal. Freedom sublime.
I look to the sky (look to the sky),
Your glory Iâll find.

Every knee shall bow. Every tongue will confess: You are the Holy One.
All creation sing of the glory You bring. You are the Holy One.
