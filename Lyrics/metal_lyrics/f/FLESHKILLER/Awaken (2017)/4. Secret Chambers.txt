Faith is evidence of things unseen.

A journey not by sight, in search of what is hoped for.
Moving with confidence, regardless of the tides.
Learning how to love. Strengthened from above.

The shaping of a soul, forging a prudent character.
Through all we cannot see, the deepest mystery.
A lesson for the just.

Wisdom is to trust.
Faith is evidence of things unseen.

The sword of the Spirit will lead the way.
The incarnated Logos will reside in the secret chambers of those who believe.

We hold fast to what we know is our hope.
The shield that extinguishes the flaming arrows of the evil one.

Learning how to love... Strengthened from above...

And so we walk by faith, with eyes fixed on the Perfector.
Through every stage of life we grow.

Faith is evidence of things unseen.
Faith is evidence of things unseen.
Faith is evidence of things unseen.
