Finite agents striving after the wind.
Seeking knowledge and finding nothing but sorrow.

The toil of thought crushing from within.
Insight comes from Him alone.

Understand the fear.
Take hold of the shield.
Guard the paths of holy justice.

Searching for the truth.
Unlearning what we knew.

Take away your heart's disguise.
Wisdom is calling.
Open up and realize: There's got to be... there's got to be a way.

Hear the voice thatâs crying in the stillness of the night.
Turn into the way that man must learn to love.

Take away your heart's disguise. Wisdom is calling.
Open up and realize: There's got to be... there's got to be a way.

The toil of thought crushing from within.
Embrace our hope from the Eternal One.

Greater than gold is the price of wisdom.
Greater than silver is the value of truth.

Take away your heart's disguise...
Open up and realize...

Take away your heart's disguise.
Wisdom is calling. Open up and realize:
There's got to be... there's got to be a way
