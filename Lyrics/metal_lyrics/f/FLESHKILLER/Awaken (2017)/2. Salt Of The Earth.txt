Love your enemies.
Bless the ones who curse you.
Pray for those who persecute the children of the Most High.

Unchain the prisoners of wicked injustice.
Break the yoke of the oppressed.
Bring the favor from above.

Salt of the earth...
Salt of the earth...

You are the carriers of light...

Swimming against the stream of conformity, to serve as an antidote to the toxic corruption of ethical deceit.

Sowing the seeds of alleviation.
Living the Word as true disciples of love.

Salt of the earth...

Not dictated by the archives of failure.
Nevermore to dwell upon the past that divided you.

Thirst for unity. Abide in the Son.
Grace will be your guide. Be not afraid.

You are the carriers of light...
You are the carriers of light...
