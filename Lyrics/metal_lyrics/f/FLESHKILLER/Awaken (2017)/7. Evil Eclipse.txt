Out in the night,
I will follow Your voice into the light.
Trapped in the absence of tranquility. Haunted by total darkness.
In a torn and depraved habitat.
There is nowhere to rest.

Existence,captured in a cloak of detachment.
Violence, chaos and disorder fills the earth.

Conducted by consuming fear, a fuel for hatred and pride. In a cold and cynical land, there is no compassion.

Existence, captured in a state of nothingness.
Evil eclipse, a merciless blackhole of detrimental lies.

Lost in the Devil's domain,
we bear the mark of Cain.

Save our souls...

Look up, behold the beacon of hope.
The ransom for lost souls. The true remission for sin.

Hear the voice of reason,
leading you into the light.

Wrapped in the presence of supremacy.
A portal for comfort and strength.
In the midst of all my enemies a table is prepared.

Out in the night, I will follow Your voice into the light.
