Close your eyes. Listen to the call of the empire.
Close your eyes. Listen to the call of the empire.

And the wind will blow wherever it may please, sweeping through the soul like an unrivalled peace.
And the heart will taste the fruit of liberty. Spiritual release. Free from the chains of death.
Enter a parallel kingdom.
Follow the knights of the perennial force. Return to the originator. Open the door to everlasting life.
Justice... Peace... Joy... abundantly.

Enter a different dominion. Answer the call of the empire.

Close your eyes. Listen to the call of the empire.
Close your eyes. Listen to the call of the empire.
Close your eyes. Listen to the call of the empire.
