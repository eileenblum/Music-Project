Moaning in a nightmare
Pain like a shattered tooth
Born of viral tendency, can't hear the storming boom of a fired gun
Smack-dab in the middle of shit
Bathing in the bowels of hell
Slipping in between the sheets with a happy, headed for a rush of orgasmic greed

Hardly in control
Reeling
Hot and cold
Viral tendency
Infectious memory

Falling in a cold mire
Living in a world unknown
Feral lies pawn the sins of even-trival, pain becomes your home

Writhing
Soaking head
Visions of the dead
Try to shake it off
Like there waiting for the sun

Rabid
Running with sodden legs
Wild, poisonous suffering
Contagion; die alone
Lover becomes a bone
Realize consciously oncoming insanity
Strumpet comes again and again
Synthetic copulation ends

Bringer of a gold mine
Bringer of a pile of dung
Every mind a bringer of an aberration of someone else's thought
Nightmares disappear in the dark by the light of day
Spirit of a shallow soul is reconnected with a confused, exhausted shell

Reminded of
