Bathe in the swill of life
Covered by the stench of the trail
Bitter is the one who won't feel change
Cauterize the wounds that the fathers left behind...

Because I can't believe the words of the chosen doesn't mean I won't be alright
Spirits rise and take to flight
Galvanize the darkness
Upon my soul render completion

Whole

Render my whole
