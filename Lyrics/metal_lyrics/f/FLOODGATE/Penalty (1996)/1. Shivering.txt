Shivering all night long
I've been shivering all night long
It's a sheer disaster
A real bastard
It's not even cold

Yet I fire it up somehow
Just as much as I'll allow
Pills accompany the leaf
Satisfy the call

It keeps me down
You keep me down
So keep it down

Hey
Come my way
I'll be damned if I'm refused
Those ain't the words that win me over in my mind

You've got the mystify-fly-by wonder juice
I got a ton of curiosity
And though it might just kill the cat
Satisfaction brings him back

It keeps me down
You keep me down
So keep it down

Shivering all night long
I've been shivering all night long
It's a sheer disaster
A real bastard
It's not even cold

Yet I fire it up somehow
Just as much as I'll allow
Filled above the shot-glass line
Satisfy the call

It keeps me down
You keep me down
So keep it down

It keeps me down
It keeps me down
Keeps me down
It keeps me down
