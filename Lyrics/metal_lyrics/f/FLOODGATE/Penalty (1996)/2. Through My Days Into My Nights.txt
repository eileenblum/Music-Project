Rise to the stars with a scar because I've paid my dues
Ain't got too much more to lose
I've got a soul to find before my mind can rest yet
Fall to my knees and praise the lucky

Ha lf-speed and lonely...
A shelter for the alone...
Wheels riding through my days into my nights, I curl up with no one

Feeling sometimes I've been bathed by the razor
Lost in a wild touch of illness - cold
I fly higher when I'm down
Restless are the souls that burn for more

Late at night I curl up with no one

You're so damn...
Believe - tonight you suffer
