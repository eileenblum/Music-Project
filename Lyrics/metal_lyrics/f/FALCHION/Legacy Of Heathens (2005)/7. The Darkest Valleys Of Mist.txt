Whole the land is soon in ruins
There is no remains of times
When the legions rode through the sky
Into the abyss I will dive
My fellows were exiled
From the land of the darkest side
I got the sense of power
It will bring me to the end

My soul belongs to the darkest valleys
I wash myself in the mist of vitality
In the valleys of eternal life
I will live and die

Let your horse ride through the sky
And bring yourself to the final battle

My soul belongs to the darkest valleys
I enchant myself with the magic spells
In the valleys of eternal life
I will live and die

Follow the shadows of the night
And find the immortal flame
