Once there was a warrior
Who has proudly fighted and conquered
Many times in his life he awaked from sleep
When he lost his left hand in his final battle
He fighted with only sword in the right hand

He was a sacred man of dwarves
He got powers from the march with the magical horn
He did a great trip with vikings
He found many wrecks and brought the treasures to the kings

His name reads in the walls of grottos
He'll never die in the tale of heathens
His sword was honoured by blood
His town praised his skills of fight
His ennemies respected him
He was a dangerous man in the ancient times
His wisdom is written in the chronicles
He won't stop living in the minds

He was a sacred man of dwarves
He got powers from the march with the magical horn
He did a great trip with vikings
He found many wrecks and brought the treasures to the kings
