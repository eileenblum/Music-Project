By building the bridge between two lands
They unite two folks to defender their people
By running their armies through the mighty valleys
They ride to the battle to spread the word

They show their anger to the ennemies
They stand till the death on the battlefield's ground

Blessed is their journey to the battlefield
They bring their weapons with honour
There is no escape from the holy battle
They retain their powers eternally

They show their anger to the ennemies
They stand till the death on the battlefield's ground

Light of the moon will be guarded their paths
Light of the sun will see their courage
Moon and sun unites their powers
They bring them to the final salvation

They show their anger to the ennemies
They stand till the death on the battlefield's ground
