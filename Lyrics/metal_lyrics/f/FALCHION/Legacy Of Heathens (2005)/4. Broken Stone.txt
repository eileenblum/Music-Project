The ancient tale told me
That ravens hold the broken stone
And knights of mighty valleys
Protect that sacred amulet

It's time to walks to the ravenrocks
And set the poison free
I want to now the secret
Lying deep inside the ravenrocks

Demonic whispers and silent spells
Calling a travelling man
Dying for a secret
I am thirsty of knowledge

The ravens fly around the wooden hall
I hide into the deepest rocks

Time has come to attack
And use the venomous magic
I rush from my hiding
And spell the curse

The ravens wings above me
Protect me from enemies arrows
I sense my strenght
And I drop the broken stone

The earthquake crushes the ravenrocks
And the new land start to grow
This was my conspiracy with ravens
And I'll fly like them

I scram alone in the lonley hall
Someone answered to my call
This is a mark of a new battle
Survivors have to fight eternally

I'm walking home and with honour I bear my sword
I'm ready to fight the next battle
Guardians of my folk are alway with us
I praise you, oh, I praise you
