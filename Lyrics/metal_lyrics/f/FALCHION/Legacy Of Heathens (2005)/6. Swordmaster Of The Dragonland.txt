Long time ago I travelled to the forest
Where dragons and dwarfs were used to live
Oh, what I saw
The creatures united in to my mind
I met a man who told me that you can be forced by dragons
If you take a mission of dragonlord
Yes, I took a mission of dragonlord

Dragonlord showed me valleys of the dragonland
He spelled his sword as the dragons lit it to the flame

Masters of wind, take a trip to the land of dwarves
Crush their palace and bless our dragons to the coming war

I had to kill the king of dwarves and run away the thunder
I tried, I used my magical skills

Thunder of dragonland striked
Into the sacred palace of the dwarflord
I ran, and stoled the keys of dwarves

Dragonlord showed me valleys of the dragonland
He spelled his sword as the dragons lit it to the flame
We crushed the dwarves as their treasures are mine
Thanks to magical sword of dragonlord's powers

Masters of wind, you took a trip to the land of dwarves
You crushed their palace and blessed our dragons to the war

Dragonlord showed me valleys of the dragonland
He spelled his sword as the dragons lit it to the flame
We crushed the dwarves as their treasures are mine
Thanks to magical sword of dragonlord's powers
