As I breath in the woods
I smell the blood of wolfs
I was born in the cradle of forest
I got my milk from the wolfs
And I dressed myself in the skin of bears
I ran free on the black rocks

Forest, show me your green leaves in the daylight
Forest, show me your black crown in the night

Never can a human rape these woods without a revenge of forest
The forest always answers with a merciless curse

Oh, let my fellows know that I am safe
Without the woods I must be dead
As I haven't be a human since forever

Forest, show me your green leaves in the daylight
Forest, show me your black crown in the night
