In the starlight, hallucinating
Knee-deep in a lake of fire
Radiated, mutated
Fade away to the darkness

Shattered dreams, twisted nightmares
All I hear is everlasting silence
A flash of bright light in the night
My mind got clearer, focusing thoughts

In the coming days I can see the new dawn of man
No more dead and gone, no more lost in the desert sand
In the distant skies, roaring storm cracks open the sky
We're rising from the shadows in the wasteland

I see patterns in darkened forms
All the colors are out of space
Visions unlike I've never seen or known
All fade away as I feel the shiver
