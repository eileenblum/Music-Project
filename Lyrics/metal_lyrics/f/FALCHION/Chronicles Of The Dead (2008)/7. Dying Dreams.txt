Lifetime of waiting, warm feeling of sunshine
Just wanting to wake up, inhale crisp clear air
Come in through an open window, the rays of the morning sun
I'd get up go outside, I'm home and I can feel it

Gone are my dreams, I'm not surviving
Alone I am hoping, all hopes I'm losing
Sickening thoughts of doom taking in
My dreams are dying, just gone, forever

See in the distance, the trees are green
Mother earth organic, its leaves are falling
A reward of a life of nothing but failure
Drown in ashes, death of a dream

After all, be proud of this life
You may feel blank but don't feel fear
Burning smoke of death reaches you
All that's left, a long lost world

Leave it to them to decide my fate
Temporary peace is over soon
The morning sun goes dark, disappears
It's cold again, I'm lost among the dead
