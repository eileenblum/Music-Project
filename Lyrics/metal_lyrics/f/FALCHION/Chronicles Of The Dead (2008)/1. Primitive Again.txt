All that I can see, is the blackened dust on the ground
Frosted remains of the world, I feel
Once bright and green was it all, that's told
How can this be true, I never wanted this for me

I don't feel for anything
I was just left in the cold
If ever had any hope
Now I feel just old

Now it's time for me to rebuild all my life
Forget all the dreams and hopes from distant past
Now it's time for me to stay on this long road
With a clenched fist I stand, no one will stand in my way

Reversal of the process, of turning into nothing
I will win this war, it's you who goes down in flames
Nothing else will I ever do, is to stay on this long road

I'll become war, and I don't care anymore

Now it's time for me to rebuild all my life
Forget all the dreams and hopes from distant past
Now it's time for me to stay alive and just carry on
Blood is rushing back
I will find my way
I didn't come this far
Just to turn around
