Our new world is taking shape
Gone is blue and green
All what's left from old now is white
But only as a false sign of hope

I try to get a grip
But I keep on slipping
Crushed in the void
Drowned under the frozen waters

Moving through space
Shifting their shape
Deafening deep silence

Floating above
Spiraling down
All shades of gray

I embrace the gray
For what other color would I know
A lifetime spent in the dark
Where nothing grows, nothing stays
