Now I'll stay and rest a while
Been going on for weeks
No destination

I won't stay for long
I only stay forever

In the kingdom of dust
Only sorrow I feel and see
In the cold barren emptiness
Keeping hopes up with my shotgun

Stormy winds of daytime
Sand in my eyes, blinded by the sun

Waiting for the stillness of the dark
When the wolves keep me company

The only light in the desert night
Is the moon in the sky
And the fire in my eyes

In the kingdom of dust
Nothing but agony I feel
In the cold barren emptiness
There's only the desert breeze
