Welcome to this funeral of Bestiality,
where fury is set free.
Well you forgot the Battle of hate,
in a world that frostwinds made in a grim sarcastic way.

[Chorus:]
When the time has come t you
and you enter your own grave
your soul is all alone.
well the war keeps raging on
in an elegantly way
and your memory lives on.

When you enter your own coffin
in a tragic, mystic way,
you light your cigarette.
You were from another time,
where terror came to life,
and funerals ruled the land.

[Repeat chorus.]
