Frostwinds comes lurking from the north.
Tragedy fury is set free.
Demonic minds, the sorrow is complete.
This has come for at black bestial funeral.

[Chorus:]
The sorrow is complete.
For a black bestial funeral.

Raging powers, the ceremony can begin.
Grotesque battles, the raven is released.
Frozen blood, forever in your veins.
Terrorized by a black bestial funeral.
