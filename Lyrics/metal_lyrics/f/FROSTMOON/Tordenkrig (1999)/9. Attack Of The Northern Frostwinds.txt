Behind the snow-covered mountains.
In the valley of mist,
grows the blackpowdered frostwinds
ready to burst, ready to attack.

Seconds before the winterstorm,
the power comes to me.
I rule over the northern frostwinds
controlling its journey, the frost-bitten anger.

[Chorus:]
This battle against the wicked weak.
Attacks the world of decay.

Hordes of demonic Power
attacks the world of decay.
This battle against the wicked weak.
Strengthen my soul,
the madness within me.

[Repeat chorus.]
