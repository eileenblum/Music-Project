Listen to me, watch me dying
consume your skin, scratch the dust covering
the hands...the skull...your teeth

Flesh drying out like melting snow
Consumed by death's overthrow
With teeth...and your eyes

When time consumes the flesh
When time consumes the surface of happiness
When time consumes your passions

Close your eyes, sniff death's splendour
Enjoy...the silence
Enjoy...the loss of emptiness

Get trapped in time, fate would be lost
With you..with everything

Teeth are starting chewing
Bones of human fears
Silence will prevail
Silence will overcome

Silence will overcome
