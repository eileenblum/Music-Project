By myself I ride
Days and nights
Alone in this dimension
I am searching the past

I will reach the land
Of forgotten witchcraft
The wind blows cold
I feel I am near

The sandstorm has stopped
Darkness is eating the sun
Winds of desolation 
Are blowing cold

The sandstorm has stopped
Time ate the walls
Here I've come
Back in the centuries

A nameless city I reched
In a subterranean desert
Ancient circles on the wall
Death built this stones of grief

Through the darkness, through the coffins
Demons re invoked
Now the sandstorms rise
I rule this world

Centuries came to a new life
Summoned by my call
Old eyes now see again
Old hate burns again

Cold winds cover
The Kingdom of pure evil
I drew the circle
I rule this world

Now I sit on the throne
Which has been covered
With dust and spiders
This dominion is mine

I rise my sword
The winds blow cold
I burn with them
My blasphemous creations
