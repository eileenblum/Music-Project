I used to look at the flames so often
I used to walk alone
My dreams are like windows, broken
Burnt and drowned in the dark

Once I was a dream myself
Once I was free
You burnt your code in me
Black as pitch

Look at the faces in the flames
Is your image there?
Knocking at hell's door
You've lost all your weakness

Spit your entrails around here
Fade your black wings
You are at home now, you are a part of me
Are you the one I should share my death with?
