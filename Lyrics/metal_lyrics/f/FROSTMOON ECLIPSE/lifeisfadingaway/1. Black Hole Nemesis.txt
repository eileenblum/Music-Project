I wish I was a stone
Through the endless centuries
I wish I was a throne
A black hole nemesis

I am a black point static
When life fades to black
A negative pole, magnetic
A locked door towards...nowhere

Freezing, dead and silent
Sinister as a storm
Injurious as your creed and beliefs
A vision through perversion and carnage

A world made of bones
We're going to become...
A world where lies
Are kneeling down...cold

I'm already quite old
Pretending to be younger
Names and faces
Are too distant from me...now

I need to be myself
I need to be alone
I need to be...
Dead...

What I really feel nobody cares
I don't need to live enough
Astonishing times of grief
Close to feel the end
