[originally by Bulldozer]I've been thrown down 
Into the fiery gulf, 
I'm still lying here 
In this furnace flamed 
I was a shinning angel 
Now a raging dog, 
(I've) lost the light of heaven 
And gained the ever burning hell 

Living is freedoom 
I don't need your light 
And scorning yout love 
I'm feeling all right 
Don't care what I do, 
I'm living the eternal fight 

Raised myself up 
From this burning lake of hell 
Gonna plan the best revenge 
Reach the earth, deceive the men 
Lust, pride, hate and sex 
Join these ways and live to win 
Bring out the fall of Adam (by) 
The tree of knowledge's mortal sin 

Look his mighty stature 
On each hand the flames, 
He's the great rebellious 
The prince of the Earth. 
On the right the demons 
On the left we stand 
That's really good place 
Yeah! We wil remain
