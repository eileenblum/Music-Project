A world of shadows
Crawling senseless and useless
Misunderstanding the meaning of life
I still feel the pulse of animals
The need to run away free

They keep you chained to destroy what once was you
Did you lose the will to run?
Did you lose the need to bite?

Breathing the senseless
To enjoy the real meaning
Chaos, violence and casualties
The only way to survive is
Dancing between the shadows over consciences

Looking at reality straight through the eyes
I wonât need light anymore
Cause I finally understand what I was looking for

Shedding blood for vehemence
To simply avoid the mere negligence
Now!

I canât understand why you decided to stay here
The reason is still unknown to me
Funny enough youâre now crying and hating yourself
You had the chance to change your life and you gave it your back
Words have never changed the world
Words will never turn you into a clandestine freedom
â¦between shadows

Get back the beast you forgot to be
