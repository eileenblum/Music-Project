I want you to know who I really am now
I need you to look inside this abyss
I beg you to go, never turn back anymore
I want you to know who I really am now
I painted this place â black as coal
I painted 1000 deaths on these walls of mine

On this path I followed, there has never been someone, rain fell in my dreams
On this way I travelled, I licked all these painful scars and hid them with hope
In this well below me, the end of all things is waiting for us
In this well Iâm drowning, canât you understand all the failure inside?

Breathing silence
Under cold ice

Nothing but another Autumn to creep on me, a darkness will come
Nothing but a skyline, too far to reach again and covered by clouds
And this time Iâm falling, this will be the last time I rise up again
I will lay my body down into this abyss and stare at the hollows

Breathing silence
Under cold ice

I painted this place â black as coal
I painted 1000 deaths on these walls of mine
I wanted this place to be as black as the night
I painted it all with each pain I could find

So many times I looked at you, as you said
But Iâve never seen you
I just look around, seeing no-one
I surrender, yes

Iâm from another world, and Iâm fine here
A world of silence and misunderstandings
In which you canât have a place

Because youâre nothing to me
Simply nothingâ¦
And so you came, so youâll go

So I found comfort within myself
Far from this comedy called life
Nothing but silence and blackness
This is the place I call my home
