Waves of black creeping on the streets
Under pale city lights
They crash against walls of concrete
And quietly flood over

My eyes behind this broken windowpane
Are empty and dead
As I wait each night for a darkness to come
And hide me away

From the hate of this world
From the sun of this world
From the life of this world
From the truth of this world

This black sea grows beneath me
Every second more
How long did I wait for this to come
To wash me away

I slowly fill my lungs, let the air come in
One last time
Got rid of all those memories, off of me
Let it all go

A bird stares at me, alone on a wire
Its wings reflect this black mire
Unable to fly away, too weak to fight
The coming darkness

From the hate of this world
From the sun of this world
From the life of this world
From the truth of this world

This black sea grows beneath me
Every second more
How long did I wait for this to come
To wash me away

I slowly fill my lungs, let the air come in
One last time
Got rid of all those memories, off of me
Let it all go

From the pain of this world
From the threat of this world
Too weak to fight
The coming darkness

Now it comes

Under pale city lights
Now it comes
