There are bleak corridors behind
This heavy wooden door
No light ever did touch these walls
Nor a voice ever did resound here.

There are staring empty faces
Hiding behind shadows of grey
The void of long gone expressions
Is forever standing still.

This is simply the triumph of Death

This is the triumph of Death
Absolute.
Ineffable.
Itâs the triumph of Death.

Symbols are forever banished there
Not a mark of human vanity is found
Can you see this is the grave of gods?
Where only fear of coming back to life
Remains.

This is what I dream when my eyes
Gaze wide open at night every time
Searching for the darkest corner
To devour me once and for all.

There are bleak corridors behind
This heavy wooden door
No light ever did touch these walls
No hope ever will.

This is the triumph of Death
Absolute.
Ineffable.
Itâs the triumph of Death.
