Like poor draws fading and dissolving with time
I should have been made in a better way.
Grasping and scratching the ground
Like looking for something that doesnât exist
Itâs not depending on me, but reality took its way
Iâm a part of the end, coming.
I still need to understand if it could simply be Salvation

Just a bit afraid of the pain, inevitable pain

Losing control? This is what I always needed
To be afraid? To rest in a better way?
Sometimes I look outside this cage called body
Flying over better places, where to be is insignificant

Do you really need wings to fly?

The end of everything
Something I desired for a long time
The end of nothing
Because I counted nothing on this earth

The end of everything
I feel both regret and absence
The end of nothing
Nothing at all counts to me

Nothing counts to me

Unbelievable distance, it seems like to step on an ocean
But itâs the result that counts
Maybe this is your most important match to win
Your adversary is widely known

Just a bit afraid of the pain, inevitable pain

Loosing control? This is what I always needed
To be afraid? To rest in a better way?
Sometimes I look outside this cage called body
Flying over better places, where to be is insignificant

Do you really need wings to fly?

The end of everything
Something I desired for a long time
The end of nothing
Because I counted nothing on this earth

The end of everything
I feel both regret and absence
The end of nothing
Nothing at all counts to me

Nothing counts to me

This long distance calling
The one way journey towards the unknown
Youâve always been curious to do it, no?
So take your things and start to walk
Even if your things are irrelevant
Step after step, looking at the abyss
Where the end stands silent waiting for you
Just you.
