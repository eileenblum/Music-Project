I owe you one, youâve been the right ring of the chain
Without you Iâd probably never started thinking to wake myself up
It could seem strange to drive to nowhere
Even if itâs the mind doing that
Travelling through the abyss of my thoughts
Exploring the grey clouds

Death is the only solution to everything
â¦of everything
Iâm upgrading, changing the skin, immolating
â¦of everything
Today Iâve got up earlier, thinking about yesterday
Will tomorrow be the same, now?
Peace doesnât exist in me, itâs just an obtuse vision of shame
Or an unnatural isolation
â¦of everything

To understand? To get things clean?
Hard, very hardâ¦ like to move a mountain
I am between the sky and the sea
Travelling on my own roads
Visiting my own places and cities
Talking with faces unknown
Full of stories that nobody need to hear
So death is still the only solution for a progressive unnatural isolationâ¦

Death is the only solution to everything
â¦of everything
Iâm upgrading, changing the skin, immolating
â¦of everything
Today Iâve got up earlier, thinking about yesterday
Will tomorrow be the same, now?
Peace doesnât exist in me, itâs just an obtuse vision of shame
Or an unnatural isolation
â¦of everything
