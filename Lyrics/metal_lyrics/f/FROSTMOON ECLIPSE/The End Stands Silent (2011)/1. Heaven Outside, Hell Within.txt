Afraid to think in a dangerous way
Afraid to think
The unchained arena of torment
Outside and deep within

Iâve been so far
From human minds
Recruiting the worst failures
Of mankind

Night...
Alone...
Think...
Death...

Iâm here to set all of that
To finally give you a try
Hopeless cancers
Deep through the night

Replacing faith with hope
Like acid it attacks and corrodes
I felt the stench of the deceased
Open wide

Admiring the cold embrace
Giving people a distorted image of yourself
What I want to give you
Is the last rejoice... last rejoice

Night...
Alone...
Think...
Death...

Iâm here to set all of that
To finally give you a try
Hopeless cancers
Deep through the night

Replacing faith with hope
Like acid it attacks and corrodes
I felt the stench of the deceased
Open wide

Heaven outside and hell within
All have been said I turned it to grim

Your demons never sleep
