[music Claudio '98; lyrics Gionata June'99]

Destructive as the flames of time
Anger from my infinite night
Like an armoured angel
Like a beast with the devil inside
I am thy war
In decay they fall

Regret and pain - deep as hell
Tormenting power - like a blowing spell
Forever I hear the way of splendour
Forever I mean it like a true tormentor
Rebellion and pride free to run
This is my blasphemy for the sun...
Regret and pain - deep as hell
Tormenting power - like a blowing spell

It's hard to follow...
In decay they fall ...fall
...forever fall

It's hard to follow
The enchant of torment
The will of perfection
Agony of my life

The light of thunder... in my eyes
The pain deep under... in disguise
Do you feel my pleasure? It's for you pain or life?
Feel my unholy dominion, this power will be shine
Forever I hear the way of splendour
Forever I mean it like a true tormentor...
Erected son... Of this earth
Spread the scorn you have forget
