[Music by Claudio, Lyrics by Gionata July 2000]

Above the infernal storm of death
I shall unleash upon mankind
You'll see everyone who dies
Slaughtered by time

In the abyss of no return
Where no light burns
Until the last life on earth
A fire shall be awoken!

Our symbols, cold, go insane and distort
Dark flames, like gold, burn the solitude of scorn

Gathering the dark of being
As a last way to escape
Depraved, defaced... Our instinct replaced...

Thousand weapons are in me... again
Head to head to fight this war again
Embracing and ravishing cold death.
Cold death...
Cold breath...  of cold death...
