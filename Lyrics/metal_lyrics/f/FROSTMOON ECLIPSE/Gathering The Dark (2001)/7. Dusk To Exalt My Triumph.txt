[Music and Lyrics by Claudio Febbruary 1997]

Dusk is mine and it has come with death and pain
All the blackness of these hills exalt my pride
I've carved my sword in the snow towards the sky

Gloomy howlings - wolves want me
Darkened wings - thousand bats hail me
To be their king - I'll slay
Snow-covered land - I've come to rule

Storming... grey castle old... for eternity my home
Ancient walls... no storm could defeat them

This is my first dusk since I died
Wiser, guided by the wolf am I
They are aware of the deep forest
They will forever be my faithful servant

I carve my sword in the snow towards the sky

Take me - castle awaits
Take me - blood is running
We'll light a fire - to hail the moon
We create fire - we'll burn the moon

Ancient am I
Mighty as never before
Enchant the moon
Destroy your soul

... and what was in the ancient past
What they burnt in forgotten days
...And every night will have its will
When the wintermoon arises ...High

My spirit drowns in the abyss of cold stones
Legions of werewolves hail my name
Triumphant, with a scythe in my hand
Laugh, seeing the abyss filled with angels... Dead

Many years passed but I was not aware
of the power that day by day was to recreate my spirit
on this domain, this forgotten domain
the mist will not allow any mortal being

... and what was in the ancient past
What they burnt in forgotten days
...And every night will have its will
When the wintermoon arises... High
