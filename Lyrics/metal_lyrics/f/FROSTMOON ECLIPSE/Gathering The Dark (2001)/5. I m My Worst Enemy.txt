[Music by Claudio; Lyrics by Gionata August 2000]

I refuse the whole life
Covered by silver plains...
I'm here beyond thy grief
Of the unbounded witness

Pierce me up! With painful blades...
You deserve... evil feelings in me...

I'm my worst enemy
I'm the confusion
I am your disgrace
Of blood, of bleeding hands...

Red as red wine
I feel your divine
Essence in blood
Upon the shelter of god...

Crimson colours of moonlight
Storming through the veil of time
Insanity reigns in my life
'Cause I've an enemy within.
Crimson colours of hate and dread
As a srange dream lurked in earth
Nailing the supreme essence... of the night
Could I have a nail more?
