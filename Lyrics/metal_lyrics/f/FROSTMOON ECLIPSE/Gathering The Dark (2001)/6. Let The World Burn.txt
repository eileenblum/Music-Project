[Music by Claudio, Lyrics By Gionata August 2000]

Let all life fade away
Hollow your heart by compassion
A serenade which sounds black
All around now sounds black

Let the world burn!
Leave this world without an end
Because madness has arrived
Riding the winds of times!

Rebellion runs divine
In the vein of a beast
Which today has my name
Rise up high my name!

Rebellion runs divine
In the vein of a beast
Which today has a dream
Rise up high his dream!

I've dreamt about desecration, pain and doom (doom)
The world of today covered by gloom (gloom)
Pain without sense and fire for remedy
Dark descended to cover the remains...
Dark still descends to cover your remains...

Let the world burn!
Leave this world without an end
Because madness has arrived
Riding the winds of time!

Let the world burn!
I wait the world praise my name!
