[Music by Claudio; Lyrics by Gionata February 2001]

Clandestine dark night
Red as blood filled out
Red as the oath with death
Red as chosen past

I knew the truth inside my veins
I saw their hatred spins twice in darkness
When my blades were risen high ...and high! ...and high!

I chose my path many years ago
When I first knew about death...
...and its grandeur

Just close a poisoned mouth

Where are your endless purities
You know what my life is made of
Crawling blades upon you
It's raining worms on mankind

Where life seems to be black
Thousand worms of impurity
Worms on mankind
