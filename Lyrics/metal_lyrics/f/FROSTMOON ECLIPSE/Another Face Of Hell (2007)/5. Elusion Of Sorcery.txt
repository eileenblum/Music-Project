[Music: Claudio, Lyrics: Gionata 2006]

Transcending into foreigners
A black scorpion full of poison
Shy water just wants to meet strong flames
Have you ever seen the night when the sun is high in the sky?

Illusion of a vision compromised
Elusion of a life that once was
The circumstances of a violent rapture
Dust to dust and flesh to rust
Have you ever seen the night when the sun is high in the sky?

Elusion of sorcery
Burning human dysentery
When water falls
Fire burns eternally

To see the truth compromised with lies
To condemn ourselves to this world of misery

A limb of fury instead of me
The joyous feeling of hatred
Making pulse deeper down the veins
Decrepitude has condemned to revitalise
Your curses are called emotions
Have you ever seen the night when the sun is high in the sky?
