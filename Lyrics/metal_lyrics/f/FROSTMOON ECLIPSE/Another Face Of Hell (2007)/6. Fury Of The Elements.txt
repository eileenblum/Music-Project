[Music: Claudio, Lyrics: Gionata 2006]

I was one with the stars
I was one with the earth
I'm cutting my flesh with mirrors
Cause I see blood reflecting twice on me

Scratching the flesh until bones come out
Dripping the blood colouring the ground
When rage becomes self destruction
This corner it's the best place I could die in

I am the abyss
A malignant erupted scar
That reminds the body a sad story

Every morning much more painful and cold
A bleak sign on your face
The severe chosen destiny of thoughts

I bleed from inside to the outside
Bleed just hunger and a will to change
I can't survive my mistakes
I'm holding on my vengeance blazing through

The world you knew is dancing with the abyss
