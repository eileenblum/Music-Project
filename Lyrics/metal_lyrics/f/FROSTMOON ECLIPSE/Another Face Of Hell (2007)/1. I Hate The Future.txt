[Music: Claudio, Lyrics: Gionata 2004]

Channelling the essence of pain
Going deeper through the abyss of desolation...
Everyone can come back from where I'm going to
Everyone can understand what is lurking down there
An age of misfortune
We left everything we had in this sad world behind

No love, no hate, no misunderstandings
The revelation has begun

I am the voice of the damned
An endless night I've become
Why should I think to the future?
Fate forgot me years and years ago.

No love, no hate, no misunderstandings
The revelation has begun

Don't give me answers I won't hear
Give me nothing at all
Time is something you should fear
It keeps an eye wide open on everything

Time shall tell the truth, time shall reveal the wrath
Irreverence, confusion and disgusting creeds
Wounds are getting larger and bleeding
Hate is growing out stronger day by day

Why should I think to the future?
Fate forgot me years and years ago.

Just one thing I'm sure of
Once I was different
Once everything was different
Now hate is devouring me deep inside
