[Music: Claudio, Lyrics: Gionata 2006]

A dish best served cold
I still have the smell of blood on my hands
God gave him life and I took it for myself
With the longest pain and turmoil

I didn't want to end him like this
I had more painful plans
Vengeance is the uncompromised essence
Of the creatures like me

He was looking at me, scared
He just wanted to understand, why
He wanted to live and let live, once
I took it all, just for me
