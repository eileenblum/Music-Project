[Music: Claudio, Lyrics: Gionata 2006]

Everything starts from the end
The bleeding symphony of chaos
A crack through the heart and the soul
There is no way out of here

This is just another face of hell
A place where answers become questions
The inversion of light and dark upon us
Reality modified its own existence
You won't recognise the places you once loved

This is just another face of hell
A place where strength is beaten down by fear
A sinister corner that sight can't touch
This is the face of the hell you fear
The dark memories of your nightmares

You can't escape from yourself
Your closed eyes will never be enough

I will eat your disinterest

The dark never sleeps, the dark will never stop
Praying your God won't be enough
