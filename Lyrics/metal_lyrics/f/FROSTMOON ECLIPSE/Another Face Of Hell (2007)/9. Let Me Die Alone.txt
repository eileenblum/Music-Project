[Music: Claudio, Lyrics: Gionata 2006]

A nature that calls on her arms
The vision of never-ending landscapes
The majesty of emptiness in your eyes
You are the right one that wither every day

As the wheels are drifting by
As the ravens cross the sky
I'll die in your eyes, every time more
Or maybe not...

If I could only make things twice
Repair the fool thickness of the past
Once you told me that I was born free
But I was never born
