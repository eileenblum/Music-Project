[Music: Claudio, Lyrics: Gionata 2006]

Intoxicated by the positive view of life
My body has already started to rust
I feel old and my will went by
I'm drowning within the eclipse

The instinct to decay
I'm drowning within the eclipse
I'm tired of being here and breath the air
I'm drowning within the eclipse
The longest and coldest journey has just begun
I'm drowning within the eclipse
The end of the story is now
I'm drowning within the eclipse

I thought I was in the morning but I still see the night on me
