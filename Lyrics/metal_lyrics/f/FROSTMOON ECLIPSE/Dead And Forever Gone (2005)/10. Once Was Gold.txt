[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Gionata]

I feel like on a train
That never stops
All colors are fading away

But if Iâm here again
There will be one reason
Even if Iâve never found it

Leave my head in troubling cold
Leave a smile in this shining gold
Turn yourself upside downâ¦
â¦cross your finger in gloom

Iâve never thought there was something worse
Than living with your own ghosts

â¦with your own ghosts

Why have I wondered for so long
Which of those nice places I couldnât reach at all
Maybe Iâve asked to see what the end shall be

â¦with your own ghosts

No reason to be afraid. Afraid of time.
Afraid of gold coming back to shine.
