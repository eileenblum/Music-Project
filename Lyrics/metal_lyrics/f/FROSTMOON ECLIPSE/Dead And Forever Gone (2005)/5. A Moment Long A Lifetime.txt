[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Gionata]

You can join me and remember the day
An endless momentâ¦ are you ready to stay?
Has someone ever called death a friend?
Someone never will

But youâre still on time to go away
Youâll have something better to do today
This is the price everyone should pay
The day will never riseâ¦. For me
