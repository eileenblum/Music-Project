[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Claudio]

Not the mountains, nor the sea
Are places for me to be
Memories hunting me
By the dark of this room

Alone or better dead
I donât feel anything
Alive is my worst part
The ceremony begins

Nothing on the ground
Blood is on the ground

Wasted time has passed
And Iâll soon be dead
By the dark of this room
A memory kills me (Yeah)
