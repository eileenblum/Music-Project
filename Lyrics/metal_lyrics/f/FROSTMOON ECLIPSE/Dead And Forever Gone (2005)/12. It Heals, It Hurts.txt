[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Claudio]

Who shall take my path
When Iâll be dead and gone?
Whoâs the one that calls
From a long time forlorn?

I bleed a lot today
And every drop is a year
So bored but I can feel
Why this must be so rude and real

I bleed a lot in this life
And every year is a year
Waiting for an end
But I know that she waits too
