[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Gionata]

Please donât tell me Iâm wrong
I donât care of what Iâve done
Itâs just a waste of time
Trying to understand my mind

Iâm on the way home now
Why should I feel so cold?
Give me the pity I never had
Go ten thousand miles ahead

Please donât tell me that you donât know
Whereâs the place I used to go
A cave  of never-ending pain
I need to stay with you again
