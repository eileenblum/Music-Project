[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Gionata / Claudio]

Thanks for understanding
Thanks for staying here with me
But Iâll be just alone
Itâs like youâre dead and gone

Blood and time are my deepest friends now
My journey is closer to the end
On and onâ¦
â¦my dreams have slowly faded away
The end is calling me by name

I called you twice
My hate went on and on
A perfect life canât face
This bloody blind road of mine
