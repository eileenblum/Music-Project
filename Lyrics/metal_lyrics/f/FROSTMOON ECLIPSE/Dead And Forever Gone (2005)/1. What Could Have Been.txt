[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Gionata / Claudio]

Today I got a knife
It seems to be alive
Donât tell me what I know
I just want to do so

The hills are black tonight
Those hills are the blackest ones

The air comes in cold
I like the smell of dead old trees
Maybe tomorrow Iâll be dead
So thereâs just one thing left to do

Youâre what I was looking for today
Those hills are the blackest ones tonight
Writing a messageâ¦
â¦to leave friends with a sweet goodbye
This is what I have to do

Now I know Iâm not alone
Even if I still feel so cold
But think to what could have been
I wish I had another lifeâ¦
