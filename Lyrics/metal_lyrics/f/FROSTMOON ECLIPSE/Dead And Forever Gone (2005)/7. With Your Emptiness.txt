[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Gionata]

Harvester of sorrow, my life turned to grey
The light of tomorrow is goneâ¦ definitely away

Hey, come here..
Donât let me tell you twice
I didnât want your fearâ¦
..but your useless happiness

Feel my presenceâ¦ try to pull it down
Hear my whispersâ¦ are calling you down
A sad story to rememberâ¦ my worst side of life

Take a look at the Sun
Donât look at me..
Donât look at anyoneâ¦
Is there someone able to look at it without feeling pain?
Maybe try it againâ¦

Harvester of sorrow, my life turned to grey
I feel the end is closer now butâ¦ I need another day

I need another day to get what I want
I want another life to scare everyone
â¦and let me feedâ¦ and let me go
Let me try another day of blood
