[Music: Claudio, Lyric: Gionata]

The industry of felicity
A chemistry set upon

Joylessâ¦
And soulless

A mind, your mindâ¦ the shores of your life
Betweenâ¦ oh in between you and your heartbeat

When instinct and grimness
Are the only solution
Total blackness and isolation
Just an act of compulsion
An empty and long journey
Deep unto meâ¦

The industry of felicity
A chemistry set upon
Your mind is my mindâ¦ I know youâre dying
Betweenâ¦ oh in between you and me.
Bizarre â¦my favorite solution
Deep unto meâ¦
