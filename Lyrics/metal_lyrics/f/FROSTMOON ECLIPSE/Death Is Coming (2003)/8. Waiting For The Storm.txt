[Gionata June â02]

Strangled - By the strength of your poison made man
Tortured - By the absence of air consumed by everybody else
Tormented - By an ancient plan of gaining space
Crucified - By the idea of man you canât understandâ¦.

â¦waiting for the storm

Itâs time to put an end
To love and happiness
Present is so cruel
A retribution of madness
Marching on the storm
Going ahead without piety
Freedom is hunting me
In this blackest cloudy sky

Leave your mortal life behind...
Drown yourself in a world... of nothingnessâ¦ entwined.

Possessed - By torments of past memories
Devoured - By an hunger of centuries ago
Explosion - Is the sound of chains broken
Infection - Is the living hate through my veins

I am what you canât control
I am fire in its purest form
I am built with the sound of anger
I am what you canât complain
I am water blue and drained
I am built with the spine of horror

â¦waiting for the storm

Disease in spiral downwards
What I felt in that moment in time
Marching upon an altar, made of flesh and bones
An abyss of fury, instead an age of reason
Iâm getting my freedom back, paying with your sunâ¦

Iâm getting my freedom backâ¦ Paying with your sunâ¦
