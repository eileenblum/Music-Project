[Gionata, November 2002]

Light... without traces of hope itâs standing above
A black tunnel... A maze of torment
Itâs time to put an end to this life... committing suicide...
Itâs better to come back to the sweet house of worms
Iâm going where all laments die, aside your light...
My world is almost dead as its purity
I am the truth you would never hear
Into the frozen dimension.. unto the eternal pain

Hatred for yourself... Pain is so sweet...
Sometimes I feel its warm heartbeat... on the razorâs rage

The world doesnât need you
The world wonât wait for you...
The world will show you obscenities
The world is just putrid scum

I was born to be an exception,
A pillar of disgust and hatred
In the deepest chambers of my mind...
What I am, people canât understand

It keeps me warm on dark cold nights
Traces of blood are crawling behind
In the deepest chambers of my mind...
â¦â¦where my ideas go blind
From my head to my spine...
Cutting the throats of disease and singing
The last rhyme... the last song so sweet
The last hymn to hail the beyond
Before drowning in a sea of blood...

...in a sea of blood...
