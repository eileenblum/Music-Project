[Gionata, October 2002]

Ancient hate and sorrow
Painted black
Unleashed from the dark past
Unleashed for... mankind.

Hear!
A voice from the deep dark night.
Black as the eyes of fear.
Black as the future of life.

(I hear the voice of the dead... I hear the sound of the end...
people are crying, people are dying... in a whirlwind of chaos
I feel the essence of the storm.... souls of children unborn
the entrance of the abyss... at the gates of Inferno)

Dark is the sound of the end,
closer to a solitary path through the lifeless and sleepless night
From now on all happiness must die.
Forever.
Forever as the end.

You have your eyes to see
The darkest season of humanity
Itâs just a matter of time...
Seconds, minutes, hours... no ...This is the end.

AH!
An eye wide open on everything.
An eye to surrender.
The future is Black.

AH!
Black as the deep dark night.
Black as the eyes of fear.
Black as the future of life.

(I heard the voice of the dead... I heard the sound of the end...
people was crying, people was dying... in a whirlwind of chaos
I felt the essence of the storm.... souls of children unborn
I heard your voice with the others... close to the gates of Inferno)
