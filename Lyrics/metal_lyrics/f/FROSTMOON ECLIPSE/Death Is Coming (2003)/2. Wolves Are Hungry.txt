[Gionata, August 2002]

Run, escape from your world
Made of realityâs scars
Proud to be still alive

Traces of blood are falling
Hear! The abyss is calling
Hear it well! Itâs your name.

Itâs time to pay your ticket
Itâs time to leave your life
They are coming

Wolves are still hungry
Corpses are still bleeding...
Ripped and eaten by
...the ravens of death and pain.

When rain falls, wolves gather
They find the light of day
They find the path to oblivion
Turning you from beast to prey

The voice is calling....
The voice is howling....
Hear it well, itâs your name
Death is coming...

Death is coming...
Death is coming...
Death is coming...
Wolves are hungry.

When rain falls, wolves gather
They find the light of day
They find the path to oblivion
Turning you from beast to prey

Eating the flesh
And grinding it to the bone
Ripping out of the body... the soul
The rage is coming forth

Wolves are still hungry
And corpses are bleeding too...
No one is laughing out loud...
...But the smiling death....
