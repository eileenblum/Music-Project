[Gionata, June 2002]

Fields of ruins
It looks like a desert
Winds stand silent
Hate breeds the earth
The world is in ruin!
Cover of blood.

Piles of bones
Rivers of skulls
The ground is now full
of deep red scars
The world is in ruin!
Cover of blood.

Blood red torment
Blood red storm
Blood red coloured I was born
The world is in ruin!
The world is... in ruin!

The world is in ruin
I march upon its death
Who called it home
Had to find a new one

The world is in ruin
No hope this feeble time
A march upon the shadows
A march upon... thy night

The world is in ruin
Palaces stand aflame
Mirrors are broken
Now the ground has my sign

The sign of Satan.
