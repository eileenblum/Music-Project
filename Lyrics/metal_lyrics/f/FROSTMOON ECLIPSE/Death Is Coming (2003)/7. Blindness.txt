[Gionata March 2000]

Negative times will come back... negative grows up inside
I am ready ...to be blind
Blind to the world Iâve seen... That I dislike
Shouldnât be something for me here. Sorry, itâs time to die.

Living filtering
The underworld
All your joyous emotions
Cast in the coldest stone

Nothing I feel, nothing I await
I have nothing positive to say
Endless reactions so endless pain
Death shall hit its target again..

Living filtering
The underworld
All your joyous emotions
Cast in the coldest stone
Trying to make more time
Present is unknown
Cut your flesh and spill your soul
This is your last dawnâ¦
