Never, never Iâll see the light
Because Iâm changing into a dark sigh
Forever, forever a scarlet lusting passion

Iâm into the nocturnal eternity, Iâm into a velvet insane dream
Would be done for an existence in darkness
Sadness all around here
My eyes will never see the fear
All around become tears
And I sold my flesh for...

Nocturnal eternity, nocturnal insanity
You are a cold embrace of a lusting splendour
My cold heart canât use your soul

Illusion of a dying eternity
Nocturnal as the rest of butchery
Bewitched in silence
And in silence are my remains...

Harmony in a unholy reign
Becomes a rapture of thousand flames
Now my body is dead...
And here you find my last eternal breath
