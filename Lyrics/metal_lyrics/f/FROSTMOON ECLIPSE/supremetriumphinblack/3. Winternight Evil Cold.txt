It was a long dark winter
The sun forgotten this land
Only a cold rain disturbed fog
When grew up stronger and stronger
The night were freezing as the purest ice

The blood red moon never-ending
A shining sceptre in the black sky
Winternight...

The woods were dark as never before
And the wolves were always howling there song of hunger
The village knew they soon will come
Many corpse were found dilaniated
The whole land was paralysed by frost and fear
It was a long and horrifying winter

The forest got his supreme revenge..
