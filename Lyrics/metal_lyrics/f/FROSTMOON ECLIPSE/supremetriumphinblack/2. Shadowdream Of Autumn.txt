In the night so silent I walk
Over uncoloured stones
Around the sky so dark I look me dying
My soul slowly remembers
The summer fall in light that brings the sky
The north wind leaves my skin
The darkness comes in silence...

Eternal, dying, divine
A constellation of beauty
Blinded for all
Into shadowdream of autumn

See me here
Wait with me for the sunlight
Kiss for me the sunâs mouth
From dawn to dusk 
The air is no more clean
The light in shaped forms
Graces and desires are hide
In this frost mourning

See with me
Wait with me

In the silence Iâd find the way of livings
Iâm like the winter which falls
You must remember the death inside
Iâm lost in woods too silent
Iâm waiting for the mortal gods of flesh
Embraced of blamed fools
The sentence is near
The sentence is near for you...
