[Music: Claudio, lyrics: Lorenzo. November 2010]

Another storm in the distance
The sky will soon grow dark around us
The treason of a morning serene
Swallowed by the longest night.

A feast for a soul to be released
A ghost in half light
To reclaim everything weâve ever been
Reset our thoughts, erase the emotion.

The great obscure dance
Over the graves of a dead future
Abdicate a journey never wanted
Never needed.

No.

There was a time I had desires
Useless visions from a shallow faith
But thatâs when at last everything was taken from me
And then the storm grew dark again

A feast for a soul to be released
A ghost in half light
To reclaim everything weâve ever been
Reset our thoughts, erase the emotion.

Reset our thoughts.
Erase the emotion.
