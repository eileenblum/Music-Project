[Music: Claudio, lyrics: Gionata. April 2009/August 2010]

To feel the pain deep inside my neck
A pain corroding life and joy
Corroding your will to keep your eyes open
Day by day

To wake up in the morning hating yourself
My life burnt fast and shining
I wish I was dead, this was my hope
But my passage on earth wonât be forgotten

A pain that keeps you breathless in the night
I know Iâm slowly fading away

Iâm devoured by loneliness
Iâm devoured by anger
Iâm devoured by hatred
And Iâm devoured by life
I am Devoured

One day I'll finally turn myself to bones, bones of stone
Cast in the solitary deserts of nothingness
The sun will slowly turn me to dust
So I can disappear at last

To wake up in the morning hating yourself
My life burnt fast and shining
I wish I was dead, this was my hope
But my passage on earth wonât be forgotten
â¦unlike the others around me
