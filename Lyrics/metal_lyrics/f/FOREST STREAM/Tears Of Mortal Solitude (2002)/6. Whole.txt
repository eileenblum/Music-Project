I know the word you've forgotten
And walks the roads you're frighten of
All my dreams were nonsense for you
I was broken by your emptiness
But now I dance with falling leaves whole again
And my laugh reaches the scarlet heaven
I leave you to dwell in your own created madness
Forever
And Winter Night embraces me to keep my visions clear
Wandering alone I'm free again in my destiny
And now I dance with falling snow whole again
I grieve of the Wisdom of Centuries you never will remember
Frozen minds... bred to be deaf to the ancient tunes...
