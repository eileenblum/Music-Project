A melody.
So charming beautiful and short
Picks wind to bind and sound so lonely
In the lowering sky among the clouds
The sky ships never knowing rest
My shadow, echo to remain... maybe...
In times no hands to join again
And paths will lay apart in sleep
So dreamless, filled with the ice wind
From somewhere, wouldn't like to know
Just smile and watch the storm advent...

I am mortal on this ruthless day
Crashed by its steal jaws being downtrodden to his own trace
Faceless but still having my will
Though watching this eternal rain
At the edge now
Just to make a step
Down the road I'm meant to be on

So you thought "I can't fly"
And that appears to be so easy

Leave me, I've chosen
I take this day
With all its hate and despair
So lifeless, gray and exitless
The last day among the lost days
In this hell where I am the only lie
Forever lie like you are
Waiting for the sunrise
The step to the endless night

...Night's getting colder
So the day to come
Too solemn in its grief
The brightest one...
