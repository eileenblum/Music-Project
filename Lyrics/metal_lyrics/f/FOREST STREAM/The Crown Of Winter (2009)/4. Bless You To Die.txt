Master am I of the dark side you have never been even close to
Oblivion I give to the hordes, watching the sun
Burning their eyes that can't see
I know I am the one you hate and fear
Fear of my black heaven calls
One day to leave... to live
"Maybe it's just the way to be?"
Humility! How I scorn you worms!

In shining masks they come well dressed
Light bows imply the impeccable taste
And smiled are their rotting faces...

Once in a dream that I have seen...
...Me... falling down, into thy blazing sea
So will you be forcing me to arise?

And they strike...

Visions

Orgy of vermin is bursting through the rotting flesh's agony
Thrilling delight for ubiquitous corpse devourers
Which are faithfully creeping around the abandoned throne
Whereto death is slowly descending to rule over chaos!
Burn! Hell is mine yours is the agony!
I bless you to die! Hated! You! All!
