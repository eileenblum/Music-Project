My fist, I thrust,
As fast as a bomb
You hit the ground,
You're buried underground.
It's the force, you force me.
You cause me to end your days on this Earth.

You can beg for second chances or fight the warriors way.
You can beg for second chances.

Do what you will for awhile...
The gods have given me a choice to take or end your life,
Or torture you to the end,
So then you scream out, out loud forgiveness.
âWill somebody save me?â
He's down on his knees again,
Figuring out, a way to con his death to get out.
This is his con, this is his choice,
This man.

You are so cold,
Yet you do it more,
Youâre not going to be happy
'Til you end up just getting in a trash bag.
So you cry out, then you cry wolf.
Youâre just scratching on the back of Armageddon.

We can see you're heading for your deathbed.
What if I was the one to cause that,
Or the other person that you con to believe in?
Here we go, he's starting over.
Oh my god I shouldâve done,
Listened to the man who wanted to spare my life.

What you shouldâve done was listen,
We should think before action,
You caused me to gut this fucking Earth.
To your God (to your god),
Your God has forgotten your name.
