I'll bring the fire to your stair.

Take you to a place where (we can)Â [4x]
I'll bring the fire, to your stair.Â [2x]
Cradle emotion right against the stairs,
Isnât just like I told you?
You let it build up and it will surely flood.
The blood will surely flood 'til you have nothing to walk on,
'cause you'll fall right through it.
Creating a space... that is hard to live in.

Emotion becomes the fire where the Devil lays his eggs.

Say what you want âcause you got it.
Hey, youâre the one with disease.
Say what you want all about it,
And you'll be crying on your knees.

These actions remind me so much of me and so much of then.
Don't be stale, just let go of the beaten and live.
