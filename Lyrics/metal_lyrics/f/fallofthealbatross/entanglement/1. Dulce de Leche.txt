As they sit on the backs of hard, hard workers
The workers start to slant and slack off.Â [2x]

So we fall into our own puddles, made of blood and sweat.
We feared this day that our tired eyes and tired mind would be tired of being a slave.
Wanting peace, we create, we need to get away to build tolerance.

There you go.
You bring crashing walls to the ground,
But we build ours now to put pressure on the womb.

We understand what youâre trying to say to me.

These arrowsÂ have carvings of all the words youâre trying to say to me.
Moving slowly, slow motion
Word for word I take into me.
I take into me...

And all the words youâre trying to say to me (these arrows)
It's coming in, it's coming in slowly.
(Have carvings of all the words youâre trying to say. Moving slowly, slow motion).
