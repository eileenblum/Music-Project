Moving away through the darkness,
And as I move, I see people pass away.
Shed your tears and say goodbye,
âcause I know these things donât matter.

What I feel,
Is nothing for either one of you.
My feelings are silent,Â your feelings are shame.
Take what you want from me, I kneel to no king.
Needing anything is putting too much weight on my shoulders.
Why?
I live a life of secluded wonders, so take what you want from me.

Surrounded by desire you place yourself to want.
So bleed the blood of hard work.
Slowly but surely you're a fake.
I'll just write a text message,
Just for you to get it through your head.Â 
Point, wink and send.Â [2x]

Did you get my,
Did you get my text message?Â [2x]
Did you... get my..... text?

Hey, today,
Oh, you take it all away,
You don't even care.
