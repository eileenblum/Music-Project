Wake up,
I open my eyes with the intention of doing nothing.
Put my hands outstretched,
Feet on the floor,
Plan my day to act,
To act like a fool. [2x]

Fool is what I am,
Who parties with the pastâs surprises as a present for today.
Missing out on knowledge and what I can be today,
Today he caught up with me.
What else is there for me to say?

Isnât it just like they say?
You see someone you do not want to see.
Oh, what a surprise! Oh... shit.
