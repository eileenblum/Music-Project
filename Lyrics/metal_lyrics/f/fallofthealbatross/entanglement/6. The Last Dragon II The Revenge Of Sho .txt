Don't be stale,
Just let go and just fucking live,
'cause what was that gun, that gun,
That gun will reach and bite you.
Don't be stale,
Just let go and just fucking live
'cause was that life, that life,
That life will reach and bite you.

I can say this over and over again.

You can do what you please,
Youâre the person in you.
You can end it if you want to,
Or can learn to breathe through.
Breathe through,
Breathe through this all if you want to.

Show me what you got.Â [2x]
Let go, [3x]
Swing and let go!

This is for soul.
Surrender yourself today.

Swing and let go.Â [4x]
