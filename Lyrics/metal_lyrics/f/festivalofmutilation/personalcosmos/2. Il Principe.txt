Crest fallen and sad
Falling from grace
Searching for the end 
I'm lost in my own land

Lament and regret
A repulsion of death
No more control 
War against all

Tempting power pulled me under
Blinded I still wonder
Why not take it all
Conquer them, kill them all

But no, I can't do that
Responsibility
Damnation of existence
Quite bad philosophy

In sea of flameless thoughts
Blindness is my crown
Wolves at the door
Howl forevermore

Hesitant and pale
I'll rot in jail
Pillory or rope
King is chopped in half

Chopped in half 
Il principe
