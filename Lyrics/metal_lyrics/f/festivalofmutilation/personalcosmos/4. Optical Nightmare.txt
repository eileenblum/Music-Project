The strength of morning sunlight
The strength of great night sky
This power is around me
No one can deny

The constant struggle for a moment 
of a great peace
You have stirred my faithful heart
So I can't be released

The strength of your blind faith
The strength of blissful heart
This power is against you
Against your ancient black art

Speak to me through the shadows
And dance in black circle
In moment of cursed struggle
I give up, the mind is weak

An optical nightmare
Unknown forms of life
A thousand demons stare
The product of my art

Become a magician
Try to break my spell
And optical nightmare
Forever disappears
