Life, construction of powerful mind
Existence is created
Law of attraction will change our lives
Beware of thoughts

Deny control, show the iron fist
Break free from the iron strings, defy the evil eye
Wisdom all around, in you and me
Reach the biggest point of existence and you will see

Dismiss your demons, be your own sovereign
You felt abandoned but it was the last time
A life in desolation, all evil you admire
Learn from the past and burn your own desire

A story made of fantasy
A veil of knowledge is removed
White dove spread its wings
Messenger of life is free
