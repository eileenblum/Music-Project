When everything is lost
It's always the end of the world
When the anxiety kicks in and I can't fight the fear that exists
Itâs easier just for me to resist
The only thing that I fear is living in me
Disconnect from the positives with distorted thinking
Breeding negativity with snake tongues, I canât breathe, itâs contagious
When everything is lost and it's all or nothing
I know what will happen
It never ends well
I'm becoming the victim, failing to the see a positive emotion
My thoughts are relentless, starving myself from pure restoration

Youâll never find your way out of here
Youâll always feel you're alone, when the dark consumes you
So, open up your mind and see clear
The pessimist of this world will die in fear
Iâll never find my way; Iâll always be alone
The dark consumes me

My mind is eating me alive

Whenever I try to succeed, it's like waves are crashing down on me
And I can't fight the fear that exist
Itâs easier just for me to resist
The only thing that I fear is living in me
