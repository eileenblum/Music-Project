[Bonus Track]Has it come to this?
Where a living hell is proclaimed bliss
I don't know how much more I can take
When will this earth break?

Hating and killing
Our blood flow is spilling
Fighting for nothing
The earth she is sinking

Everything is not fine
Why the hell are we alive?
Everything is not fine
This is how you will survive
If you really want a change then let's gather all our spades
And dig holes for your graves
Because you're always tongue in cheek playing victim on the seat
But you will never feel defeat

I know what you're searching for
Somebody else to do something about it
In this world that never sleeps
You're never around when it's happening
I know what you're hoping for
Somebody else to do something about it
In this world that never sleeps
You're never around when it's happening

Aren't you sick of all the bloodshed and drama?
We once loved each other
Now we'll all die as martyrs
I'm sick and tired of reading about this shit
So put a bomb on this planet and blow us all to bits

This is a war labeled
War atrocity

Drowned in filth

Line them up and shoot them down
Tell the people they're going to be silenced
Show this city there's justice in violence
Teach the world true meaning of violence

One shot
Two shots
Three shots
Until you hit the fucking ground

Choke on the truth
