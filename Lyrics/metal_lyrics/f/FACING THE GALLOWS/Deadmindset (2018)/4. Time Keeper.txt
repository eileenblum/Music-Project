[feat. Duncan Bentley]Death waits for no-one, he is in control
He takes what belongs to him, takes what he is owed

Death's eyes are hollow
Your life is at its end
Your skin will start to fold, soon your body will disintegrate
The way you see your own reflection is something you will soon forget
Why can't we all live forever?
No
Not even time can save you

We are getting older and it's only getting harder

It's the passing of an era that inflicts fear upon the mind
Don't let the thought of non-existence plague your life

Death is waiting, he's calling out our name
This blood-soaked payment, we've owed for the life we've lived
Death is waiting, he's calling out our name
This life's been jaded, we have no time to give

Go, because everything's at stake
Make sure your remaining days don't go to waste
There must be something you achieved, something you won't regret
If you were given one more shot, would you make the best of it?

We are getting older and it's only getting harder

The time keeper will take what he is owed â a life
The Reaper looms over a walking corpse
Worm food since the day you were born
Death is knocking at my door

When your time is up, and death comes for you, with his cold dead hands
Could you even try to run and hide, could you beg for your life?
If he offered you more grains of sand, would you pay the price in blood?
Would you slit somebody's fucking throat?
Would you betray the ones you love?
