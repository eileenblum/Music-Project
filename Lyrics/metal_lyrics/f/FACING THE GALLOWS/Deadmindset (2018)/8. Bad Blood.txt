I am a vessel of rage
I am burning up and I won't be contained
Building and building my temper starts to rise
Not even the kindest whisper could tell me otherwise

Fueling this fire
I've seen red
Everyone's my enemy
All calm is dead

My mouth is a weapon bound to enrage
Set to explode from a swallowed grenade

I'm up in arms
Gonna feel my wrath
Foaming at the mouth
I'm on a warpath
Death to all calm

With fury in these eyes
I'm burning under my skin
How can I escape from this?
Terrorized by anger
Am I losing my mind?
How can I escape?
I am a vessel of rage

It doesn't take much to crawl under my skin and fill me with hate
Where do I draw the line?

You won't like me on my bad days
I've reached my breaking point

You pushed me to the edge, watch how this avalanche falls
