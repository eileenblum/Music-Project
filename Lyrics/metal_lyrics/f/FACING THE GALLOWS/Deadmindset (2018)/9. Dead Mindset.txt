We have killed something that was great
Our biggest flaws were our own mistakes
If only we commit to what we have planned
'Cause changing the world needs a helping hand
Remove the blindfold from your eyes
And see the truth that fuels our demise
Exile the filth and deny them access
Show no mercy
Show no forgiveness

My mind is racing, and I can't seem to sleep
A constant motion and I'm battling to think
Can't you see this?
Don't you feel it?
I'm lying awake as this nightmare begins
All I wanted was a coming of an age where we could all feel safe and not live in fear
Instead the death roll will rise
We kill to survive, there's fury in these eyes
We've created our own prison

I'm sick of living in this hole
I'm sick to death of what I've been told
I'm lying to myself that I really care
When I know that everything that I love will fucking die here

Our minds aren't strong
And our word is weak

We rip our lungs screaming on top of mountains
These memories will not die
And they won't be forgotten
So, shout out to this world
Don't let it pass you by
You only get one go
Let sleeping hearts ignite
I've come to terms; we can't keep living this way
There will be a time when this world must change
Why can't you see that we all have closed minds?
Why can't you see that we are all going blind?

Look at what we've done
Look at what we've become
We're fucking monsters

Lurking in shadows within the corners of my eyes
Pushing and pulling me
Dragging me in
Into the depths of deception
Descending through time

Aren't you sick of being controlled?
Aren't you sick to death of what you've been told?
Quit lying to yourself that you really care
When you know that everything you love will die here
Our minds aren't strong
And our word is weak
We've butchered our planet

Look at what we've done
Look at what we've become
Erase your mind
We've butchered this planet
