As fire burns the sky the weak are crying out
Their wells are running dry and they've finally had enough
They can see the blood-stained hands of power
There will be war

The ones in need beg to no avail
The wealthy bathe in gold, drinking life from the pale
Who will you blame when all of this is drained?
There will be war

Destroyed our homes, withered our bones, lead us astray
Life is in ruins, they don't give a shit
We're rising up, growing strong, taking back what's ours
They don't belong, we won't stand for this

Dictators clawing their way in
Dictators your reign is at its end

This feeling starts to turn, and it builds up inside you
Just know who you are (and you're never alone)
So, breath in
Don't count your blessings
Illuminate your heart

They have the water and the oil, and they will prevail
We are the ones who suffer while they reap the spoils
We must dethrone and change the currents of the powers that control the world
There will be war
Retribution
There will be blood
Suffer
There will be devastation

Illuminate

Revolt against your leaders
Take it back
Rising in arms as we fight to our death
