I'm out on the town and about to get wrecked
With zero fucks and no regrets
I always said, we got nothing to lose
So just get on your feet and fucking move

I'm on top of the world, not giving a fuck not living a lie
It doesn't matter what people think 'cause I'm living for me now
No consequence, no compromise, got my drink in hand
Let's smash this party like the dollar fucks the rand

It's moments like these, that make the best memories
We own the night, we own the night
With friends like these, we'll burn this place to the ground
We own the night, we own the night

Sometimes you got to lose yourself
So make some noise
