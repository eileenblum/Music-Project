Grasping hold of the future placed into my hands
Holding tight the unveiling temperament of where naivety resides
Once a child and full of hope
I dreamt of worlds where I could cope
Now I walk this earth
A distant traveler
While my shadows try to slit my throat
They're coming for us all
Don't let them in
Don't let them inside
How I wished I had known
Make history to the past and become anew

I want to change how my life was planned from the start
I want to live
I want to learn
Instead I've fallen
I've failed
I'm out of luck

My heights are endless

I won't be bound
By the enemy that resides in me
I won't be ashamed
Of what has shaped my destiny
I won't be a slave
To my thoughts that try and bring me down
With my new resolution to conquer these demons
I will prevail

My heights are endless
The skies the limit

Now is my opportunity to rise
I will rise
