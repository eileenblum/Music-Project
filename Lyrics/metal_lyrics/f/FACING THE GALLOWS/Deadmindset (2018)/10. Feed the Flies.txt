I don't know what I was thinking that day when I gave part of me away
Investing and digesting all these false words
You told me what I wanted to hear
And just like the others I fell victim to these lies

There's a man with hollow eyes
Who wears a suit and tie
He likes to talk the talk and run his mouth regurgitating flies

Hunted
I was the sucker who took the bait
Helpless
From the traps that reeled me in

Liar
Deceiver
Betrayer
You're the one that roped me in

I'm calling you out
There's nowhere left to run
I can't believe you thought you'd get away with this unscathed
You'll know my pain
You'll always think you'll get more than what you're paying for
Don't be an easy target
A prisoner of their war
Hook, line and sinker
Sinking deeper into this cut-throat world

I don't know what I was thinking that day when I gave part of me away
You told me what I wanted to hear
And just like the others I was betrayed

Hatred
You are the one that I despise
I'm waiting
For the moment of your demise

Watch out for sirens
Don't get hooked on the line
There are sharks in these waters
They'll lure you and eat you alive

You blood sucking parasite
You're filth
And you're scum
Severed your anchor
I've cut your line
I've broken the chains

I've built a resistance to your kind
I'm no longer a slave to your white-collar crimes

Hunters
The wolf has now become the prey
Pariah
Bring your knife for the head of the snake

I've severed your anchor
I've cut your lines
I've reached the surface
You're dead to me
Cunt
