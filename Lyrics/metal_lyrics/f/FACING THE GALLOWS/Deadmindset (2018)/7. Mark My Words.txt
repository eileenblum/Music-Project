You cannot live with regret
If you're constantly beaten down by it
You can't take back what's been said and done
When the time has come, and the time has gone
You can't say sorry and that you care
If you never really were there
Memories torn asunder from personal vendetta's
Mark my words, they're in your head

We're so quick to judge but there's truth behind the curtain
We forget where we truly come from

When they're dead and gone and you can't move on and the guilt is all you are left with
When the moments missed will you reflect on this, as the embers burn through bridges
If only you could fix this, it wouldn't be this way, you wouldn't feel the same
If only you could fix this, but now that moments gone forever

Sometimes it's hard to comprehend when you've made bad choices, and said bad things
And I'm not proud of what I have done, but at least I've acknowledged and accepted that I was wrong
Trust me, you don't want to bury guilt
It will eat away like a cancer and you will have to live with it

The past has been tainted by the actions that were taken
We regret what we have done but we reap what have sowed

You cannot live with regret
If you're constantly beaten down by it
You're beaten

I've seen this
I've done this
You don't want this
