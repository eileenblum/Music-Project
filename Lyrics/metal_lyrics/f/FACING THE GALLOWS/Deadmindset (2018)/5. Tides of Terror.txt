Scared of this world
Scared of this home
Scared to death of what we all will become
Losing my sight
Losing my hope
Losing my grip on how I will cope

Like oceans approaching the shore
Another thought I can't control
Wild seas and restless weather
These tides of terror are drawing nearer
Sleepless nights from countless worry
Always terrified

I can't go on feeling this way
Got to keep my head above the water
I can't go on living this way
Got to cut loose before I go under

We bare scars on our hearts
The past won't leave us broken
We have the strength to carry on
See how far we've come
Look at that new horizon
We have the strength to carry on

Feeling of pain
Crushing of fear
Trembling of thoughts that I will disappear
When will this end?
How will I go?
Give me a reason to remain afloat

Like oceans approaching the shore
They're crashing in

We have come so far in this life
But there's always something waiting
To turn against us in the best of times
When will the tides change
When we can feel safe in our lives
Safe in our homes
Safe in this world
Let's build a better place that we don't fear
A place where we can survive

There's a need to remind ourselves
That there's still hope out there
Our lives can change for a better tomorrow
But we must change ourselves today
There's hope beyond these tides of terror
We can find our way
