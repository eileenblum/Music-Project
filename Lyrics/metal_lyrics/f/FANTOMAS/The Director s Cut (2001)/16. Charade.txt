When we play our charade
We were like children posing
Playing at games
Acting out names
Guessing the parts we play

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill
Lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still
I always will
Best on the bill
Charade
