I feel strong
The power is back
It's been gone for so long
Trust me, here I come 

Yeah, the scars in me
Came from what you wanted me to be
But still
I am what I am...

My life built on confusion
Hours spent alone in seclusion
I've come to claim what's mine
I am the one

"I am the armageddon man
It's written on a wall for a good time call"
Should I reveal the secrets in my mind?
Tell me, I wanna know 
Time to leave life behind
To close doors in my mind
The hatred
Makes my eyes blind...

My life built on confusion
Hours spent alone in seclusion
I've come to claim what's mine 
I am the one
