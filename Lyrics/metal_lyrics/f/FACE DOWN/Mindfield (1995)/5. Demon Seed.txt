There is a seed set to grow in my soul
That burns my heart but leaves my brain in control
Screams of pain and screams of fear
That lives inside my head 

So now in different shapes I come to you
Smile as I fill your head with words untrue
Addictive ways of pleasure I bring to thee
You are weak, thereby easy to victimize

Crack my whip
To project demons in your mind
Taking you down
To the forever black

Now it's my time to rise
Break you down and grind your soul
Fear and disgust cracks your face
I have reached my goal 
So now that I have entered your soul
I shall proceed to crush
Not because I want to or need to
Rather just because I can

Crack my whip...

The one with the mind on a higher level
Precious life, honed to perfection
Devious in heart, spawn of the dark
Born of demon seed 
The son of the one almighty
I will be there to control
Always doing what I please
Demon seed

Crack my whip...

Devious in heart
Spawn of the dark 
Demon seed
