Trying to run from what you are
Afraid of being alive
Hands shaking body aching
The abuse left a permanent scar
So now to get by you do whatever it takes
You need your reality to hit your veins again
Don't try to blame anyone
Your blame is self chosen

Don't come looking for sympathy
'Cause you won't get it from me
You're nothing but a burned out wreck
That solves problems with another hit 
The remedy in a bag
Served up on a spoon
Starts to serve it's purpose
To kill the pain!

Looking for the utopia you found the first time
Will you ever get there again
Increase the dose and soon you'll find out
Was it too much or just enough
The chemical satan has got you in his hell
Don't you think you're better off dead
Don't try to blame anyone
Your pain is self chosen

Don't come looking for sympathy
'Cause you won't get it from me
You're nothing but a burned out wreck
That solves problems with another hit 
The remedy in a bag
Served up on a spoon
Starts to serve it's purpose
To kill the pain!

I need to kill the pain, kill it again
Need to release my pain, kill myself again 
Traded your life for a fix

The remedy in a bag
Served up on a spoon
Starts to serve it's purpose
To kill the pain!

I need to
Release my pain
Help me to 
Kill the pain
