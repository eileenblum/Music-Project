Preacher man, judging you again
Telling you about your sins
He made himself god to say
Sinful life is not the way
Follow christ the lord of flies
In holy wars where people still die
So as god fills your hollow mind
I will st my own rules of life

Body of christ
Holy rage

"Thou shalt not sin" are the words of the weak
Do you really believe in turning the other cheek?!
As so many others, you've been deceived
By the false servants of hate and greed
If there is a will there is a way
I'll never be on my knees to pray
You're taught to believe in christian lies
Words that will destroy your lives

Body of christ
Holy rage

Amen 
They fool you
They rule you
And soon they'll also own you 

They fooled you
They ruled you
And now they also own you 

They fooled you
They ruled you
Who will now come to save you? 

They fooled you
They ruled you 

Amen
