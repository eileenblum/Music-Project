The things you tried to make me believe in
To live, give, love and forgive 

I'm trying... 

Never painless, emotional emptiness
I always keep raping myself this way
Just darkness, I'm building myself a mountain of grief
I'm left by myself
Noose of guilt around my neck
Will there be someone here to listen?

Self destructive, or call it what you want
Self deception, I do it time and time again

True denial, Am I suicidal?
As my pain mounts up
I really can't tell anymore
Now I am 
I'm left by myself
Fed up by thoughts
Will there be someone here to listen?

Self destructive, or call it what you want
Self deception, I do it time and time again

Can't put my life on hold
I need to catch my breath

Self destructive, or call it what you want
Self deception, I do it time and time again 
Halls of emptiness, filled up with my mistakes
Still rejected, all that's left is loneliness...

I'm left by myslef
Fed up by thoughts
There were no one here to listen 
Regret 

Forget
