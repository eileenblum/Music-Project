Here I stand alone
Abused by myself
Scenes of suicide
Like a solid wall of fear
Negativity overcomes
Positivity in me
Self pity, laughing
Screaming in my ears

The fuse is lit
The fuse that makes me explode

These questions I ask
Who gives and who takes?
If the answer is god, well
Who am I? His mistake?
An endless battle
Against depressive thoughts
Brief moments of victory
'Cause you know there is always more to come

The fuse is lit
The fuse that makes me explode

I am
Alone
Save me
Kill me

Save me
Sane me

Spent some time in myself to find out who I am
All I found was pain
Can I ever be saved?
Kill me please, set me free 
Save me
Kill me

The fuse is lit 
The fuse that makes me explode
