Worn out and nothing more to give
Who said that life was simple to live
The pain inside eats away at your pride
The price of friendship is sometimes high

But weak, in pain
Is where you want me to be
But still you are
The one who'll always lose 
I win, you lose

Crack some lies behind my back
The time has come to start paying back
So here I come you pathetic shit
It's time to choose where the fist will hit

But weak, in pain
Is where you want me to be
But still you are
The one who'll always lose 
I win, you lose

I called you a friend

I win, you lose
