God of make-believe 
In your world 
Nothing's what it seems
Master Of pre-judgement 
What do you really know 
about the things we do

We know who you are 
This time you've gone too far 
The scar runs too deep

Thanks for the inspiration 
To rise above you all
Second coming
Back with a vengeance 
Judgement day 
Cleansweep

Dreams spoiled by your greed 
When honey turns to mud
you can't succeed
You're laughing now 
But not for long 
Operation cleansweep 
has just begun

We know who you are 
This time you've gone too far 
The scar runs too deep

Thanks for the inspiration 
To rise above you all
Second coming
Back with a vengeance
Judgement day 
Cleansweep

Try me, try me...!
