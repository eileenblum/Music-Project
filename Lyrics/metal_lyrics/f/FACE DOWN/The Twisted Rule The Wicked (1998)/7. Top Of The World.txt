Born and raised under daddy's protective wings,
Sheltered from all the ugly things in life

But didn't daddy tell you, 
There are places where you don't belong,
Executive seats, 
In charge of my life, 
Music industry

And if he did, 
Why didn't you listen?
So you could have spared us 
the unpleasent experience
of ever meeting you.

Promises broken, 
Money never seen
Your pockets never deep enough,
Always crying for more

'Cos you're - Lying, Stealing, Cheating
Your not on top of the world

How could we ever fall for your shit, 
I guess you shouldn't believe, 
What you just can't see

If I had a penny for every lie
I would gladly pay just to watch you die
Top of the world
Lying, Stealing, Cheating, Fucking us over
If I had a penny for every lie
I would gladly pay just to watch you die
I want to watch you die!
Top of the world
