You want an answer, 
Well, What do you want to hear, 
That I think you're special

And that I really care? 
That's where you wrong, 
'Cos I'll never be, 
More than I expect from me!

The whole of me dedicated to your misery, 
You're a whore, I'm a hero

Don't chew more than you can swallow
Don't chew more than you can swallow
Don't chew more than you can swallow

I stand corrected, 
Sorry I made you feel that way, 
Small word of comfort, 
You're not the first

You try to be a match for me, 
Don't waste your breath, 
'Cos this is what you made me

The whole of me dedicated to your misery, 
You're a whore, I'm a hero

Don't chew more than you can swallow

What I want, And what I need, 
Is still something you can't bring me

Here's an answer to you question, 
My lies as true as yours

Maybe not the one you wanted, 
But the only one you'll get 

You'll never be a match for me, 
Don't waste your breath, 
'Cos this is what you made me

So how does it feel?
This I do belive, 
The lies that you concieve

What goes around comes around, 
And twice as much from me
