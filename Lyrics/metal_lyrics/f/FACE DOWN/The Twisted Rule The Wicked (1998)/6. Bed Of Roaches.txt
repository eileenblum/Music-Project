Night, 
Another night of the damned, 
Standing at the border to insanity land

Dance of the dead in the midnight hour, 
Touching your cold lips, 
Shivering of lust

Apathetic you stare, 
Into my infected soul, 
I close my eyes, 
Dream away, 
As I lose control

And now your mine forever, 
Forever you are mine, 
Now your mine forever 

Until the end, 
Until the end of time...

The love that you denied, 
Was the reason why you died

The love that you denied, 
Is the reason why, Why I die...

You're lying dead on your bed of roaches, 
Dead, Dead in everlasting sleep

You're lying dead on your bed of roaches, 
Dead, Dead only mine to keep
