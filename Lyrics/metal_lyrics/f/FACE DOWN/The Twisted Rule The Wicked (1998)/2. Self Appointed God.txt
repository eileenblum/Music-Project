A shattered soul born, 
From a loss of faith, 
Your empty mind filled, 
With the wrath of god

Now your broken heart, 
Will never heal your scars, 
But you'll be saved, 
From religious starvation

As I become your guiding star!
The twisted rule the wicked, 
A beginning with no end

The calm becomes the restless, 
As I am your
Self appointed god

Same order, new messiah, 
Define my name, 
Your my puppet my blind disciple

On your knees you'll pay, 
Obey the faith of the bleeding heart

And you'll find your way, 
to salvation through pain and fire

As I am your self appointed god!
The twisted rule the wicked, 
A beginning with no end

The calm becomes the restless, 
As I am your
Self appointed god

Same order, new messiah, 
Define my name, 
Your my puppet my blind disciple

On your knees you'll pay, 
Obey the faith of the bleeding heart

The twisted rule the wicked, 
A beginning with no end

The calm becomes the restless, 
As I am your
Self appointed god!
