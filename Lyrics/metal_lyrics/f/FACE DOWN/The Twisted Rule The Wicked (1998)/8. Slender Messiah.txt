He's building a mountain for you
You're so filled with your self, 
Never wrong always right

Always the winner in your own little world, 
Fantastic, Always on top

Well, The bigger the ego the harder the fall, 
Please man, are you for real

Your myths and your lies 
really makes my eyes bleed,
Delude your surroundings

Pretending to be something that you're not, 
You're only...

Deceiving your self
Hypocritical liar, 
To believe in your self 
you're a slender messiah

Take credit from others, 
Steal your ideas, 
Duplicate with no remorse

Try to see, 
The world isn't in orbid around you, 
Even when we have seen

The true nature of your scheme, 
you're still pretending 
you're something you're not
You're only...

Slender messiah 
the god when all else has failed
Building a mountain, 

By using small fragments of truth
The joke is on you!
