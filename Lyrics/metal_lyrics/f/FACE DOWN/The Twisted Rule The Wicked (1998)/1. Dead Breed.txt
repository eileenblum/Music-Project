Like a ship lost at sea, 
That's all we'll ever be, 
A suicidal breed, 
Shaped from this tainted life we live
So what can you tell me, 
That I don't already know, 
You're already my bottle of pills, 
And companion as I go

This ripped up soul, 
Will it ever change this life Iive, 
No never...

We're dying within, 
'Cos we're living it our own way, 
today, tomorrow
Tell me brother, 
Will you ever bleed for me?

No deposit, No return, 
Story of my life, 
My anger hides within, 
But will never cloud my eyes

Like a ship lost at sea, 
That's all we'll ever be, 
I've had enough of your world, 
There's nothing you can tell me

This ripped up soul, 
Will it ever change this life Iive, 
No never...

We're dying within, 
'Cos we're living it our own way, 
today, tomorrow
Tell me brother, 
Will you ever bleed for me?
Will you ever bleed for me, 
'Cos the only one who bleeds is me
Will you ever bleed for me? 
As I die!
