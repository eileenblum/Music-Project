I guess I am just...
Torn between life or silence, 
As the pain in my eyes becomes to clear

Destroyed! By the sounds so empty, 
Empty as the answer to my prayers

God! You're still robbing my cradle, 
Your crawings for my love erased my mind

I stand raped and lonely...
Embrace the moment, 
My life in your hands

Divine torment, 
As I feel the love I fear

You push me aside and mock my tears

Lifeless the passion, priceless the gain, 
Broken the heart, From a life insane

Guilt is the spike, 
The thorn in my eye, 
Corroding the chains to an abusive mind

Embrace the moment, 
My life in your hands

Divine torment, 
As I feel the love I fear

You push me aside and mock my tears
Guilt is the spike, 
The thorn in my eye...

With tired eyes I watch, 
Repeat itself, 
But the circle's incomplete

Serrated blade cuts the noisome vein, 
And I drain myself from pain

Embrace the moment, 
My life in your hands

Divine torment, 
As I feel the love I fear

You push me aside and mock my tears

Lifeless the passion, priceless the gain, 
Broken the heart, From a life insane

Guilt is the spike, 
The thorn in my eye, 
Corroding the chains to an abusive mind

And I become one with myself...
