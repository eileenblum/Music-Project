A befitting doom for a generation
A drug ridden culture of mass sedation
Failing to realize its own demise
Falling generation, caught by surprise
Identity crisis
My sanity's priceless
I don't fuckin' like this
Insanity
Poseur-isms and masochisms
Drive the youth to materialism
Falling under the corporate wheel
Crushed in its wake, left with nothing to feel

Diverted perceptions and urban decay
Millions of people are led astray
Not by force, but by their own will
No visible enemy, no men to kill

Our very desires fuel the death machine
We're drowned in smoke and by TV screens
Made to believe that this is the only way
We follow along until our dying day
Emotions thieved from another of their kind
A stolen identity, another man's mind
That which is felt is only felt to achieve
The status quo of what is 'cool' to perceive

Never take heed,
Never listen to warning
Until it's too late,
Then we start the mourning
Insanity
Insanity

Poseur-isms and masochisms
Drive the youth to materialism
Falling under the corporate wheel
Crushed in its wake, left with nothing to feel

Insanity
Insanity
Streets run red with the blood of the people
Self-inflicted, a pain that cripples
No-one else to blame except for ourselves
Recreating this personal hell
A befitting doom for a generation
A drug ridden culture of mass sedation
Failing to realize its own demise
Falling generation, caught by surprise

Identity crisis
My sanity's priceless
I don't fuckin' like this
Insanity
Poseur-isms and masochisms
Drive the youth to materialism
Falling under the corporate wheel
Crushed in its wake, left with nothing to feel

Insanity
Insanity
