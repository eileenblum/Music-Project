"All sins tend to be addictive
And the terminal point of addiction is always...
Damnation"
Filled with anguish, you feed on the weak
Seized up by the fear of yourself
Now scabbing the darkness for that quiet place
Where nothing really matters, no thoughts to erase
I am
The image of you
Lodged in there
Running high in your veins
Welcome to my hive
Where you can clear your twisted mind
Lay down by my side
Here you'll see we are two of a kind
Twisting your flesh and burning your skin
Like a virus I find my way in
Choking your last breath of unsoiled air
Look deep in your soul and you'll find me there
I am
The image of you
Lodged in there
Running high in your veins
Step into my hive
Here we're all equally worthless
Stay right by my side
One false step and you might get burned

Surrender me your mind
Now I control your life's desires
I won't betray our feeble kind
Come with me, let's bathe in that tempting fire
Piercing your skin
Push the needle in
I am
The image of you
Lodged in there
Running high in your veins
Welcome to my hive
Where you can clear your twisted mind
Lay down by my side
Here you'll see we are two of a kind
Piercing your skin
Push the needle in
Come with me,
Let's bathe in that tempting fire
