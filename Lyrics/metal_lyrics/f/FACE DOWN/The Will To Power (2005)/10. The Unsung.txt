High tides flood this tainted heart
As I walk tall my path cuts through the crowd
They stare at me, the mindless fools
They envy me, set free, nevermore to follow their rules
I
Sold my soul
Drained of love
I reside with the fallen angels

I
Found my place
Down here in the hole
My home, with the unforgiven
Down here I am
Don't pray for me
Save yourself
There were times when I was a liar
There were times when I did you harm
There's times when I feel regret
But they're far and few in-between
I
Sold my soul
Drained of love
I reside with the fallen angels

I
Found my place
Down here in the hole
My home, with the unforgiven
Down here I am
Don't pray for me
Save yourself
From the unsung
