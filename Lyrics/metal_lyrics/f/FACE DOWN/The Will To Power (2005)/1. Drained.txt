Trapped - inside this frozen heart
Lives in a fading breath of compassion
Destroyed - by my final deed
All beauty must die

Time to rid your mind of the vermin
Rid it of vermin like me
All you thought you achieved
Is crushed underneath my boot on your chest
I'm the last thing you'll see
Drained - a cut from the blade so sordid
Unpure
Drown - my filth is pulling you under
Hate - I'm bleeding you dry
I'm bleeding you dry
Brace yourself
This is far from over
If you fight, kick and scream
I'll only go slower

Drained - a cut from the blade so sordid
Unpure
Drown - my filth is pulling you under
Hate - I'm bleeding you dry
I'm bleeding you dry
Drained - a cut from the blade so sordid
Unpure
Drown - my filth is pulling you under
Hate - I'm bleeding you dry
I'm bleeding you dry
"When you look down at me
You'll see a fool
When you look up at me
You'll see your lord
When you look straight at me
You'll see yourself"
Now you're mine, a dog on a leash
Salvation at hand, but too far to reach
The sheer thought of it all is making you sick
A gun to your head, all you heard was.. click!

Taking my time to watch you squirm
Mercy is something that you earn
The sound of your body slamming the deck
Is outshined by the sound when I'm snapping your neck

Who will decide and who's to blame?
Place your bets in this high stakes game
There's millions of ways to enter
And only one way to leave

Drained
Unpure
Drown
Hate

Drained - a cut from the blade so sordid
Unpure
Drown - my filth is pulling you under
Hate - I'm bleeding you dry

I'm bleeding you dry
Die
