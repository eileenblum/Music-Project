You closed your eyes a cold November night
You my lovely light of life, no more shining bright
As the autumn rain turned to bitter snow
I stood outside the world, with nowhere to go
A thousand shades of grey
You erased my world that day
A thousand words to say
All lost in silence to fade away
Caring faces staring right at me
I can't stand their smothering empathy
Like maggots crawling upon rotten meat
A buffet of misery, all you can eat
A thousand shades of grey
You erased my world that day
A thousand words to say
All lost in silence to fade away
A thousand shades of grey
A million moments passed away
A billion pieces of my heart
Spreading like ashes forever dark
You are not alone - Your false sympathy makes me sick
You will get through - There's no happy end to this life of shit
You must be strong - As I put the rope around my neck
Time will heal - The colours leave this broken wreck
A thousand shades of grey
My trail of tears ends here today

A thousand shades of grey
You erased my world that day
A thousand words to say
All lost in silence to fade away

A thousand shades of grey
A million moments passed away
A billion pieces of my heart
Spreading like ashes forever dark
No love, no light
Just shades of grey
