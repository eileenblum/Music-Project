This shit ends now...
Spit it out, what's this all about
Why not say it straight to my face?
So what if you're right, I still sleep well at night
'Cos snakes like you deserve to die

Pick up the pace, I'm breathing down your neck
I bet you never thought it would come to this
I heard what you said - don't fucking lie to me
A message one can't fail to receive
Still lying through busted lips
Start praying you little shit
The end of life as I see fit
White clad walls where we can play
Revenge extracted the crimson way

Blood Tiles
Weeding out the weak with arterial spray
Blood Tiles
Your legend of lies now slipping away
Bring it on, step up to the plate
You better believe I'm ready for you
You act like a bitch, feeding lies and deceit
Here we go - come reap what you sowed

Why so surprised?
You know what you did
Did you really think I'd let it slip?
Suffer the consequence, pay the price
Your fate is now a roll of the dice
Still lying through busted lips
Start praying you little shit
The end of life as I see fit
White clad walls where we can play
Revenge extracted the crimson way

Blood Tiles
Weeding out the weak with arterial spray
Blood Tiles
Your legend of lies now slipping away
Let's go!

So there you lie - soiled and defiled
How does it feel now?
I'm guessing not the same?!

Fucking snap your neck
I'm coming for you
I'll watch you die
Blood Tiles
White clad walls where we can play
Blood Tiles
Revenge extracted the crimson way
Blood Tiles
Weeding out the weak with arterial spray
Blood Tiles
Your legend of lies now slipping away
