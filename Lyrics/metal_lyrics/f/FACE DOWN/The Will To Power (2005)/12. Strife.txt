Oh, you fucking cockroach
Who's to stand and who will fall
"Sticks and stones will break your..." - yeah right
Show me how fast you can crawl

Fight - come get your licks in
Brawl - you better start swinging in this free for all

Beeble prayers won't save you here
We've passed the point of no return
Bloody knuckles, broken bones
Only the dead have seen the end of war

Pain - stand your ground and grind your teeth
Grow - enter the sound of smashed human bone
I fear no man
I love no one
I won't pay for what I have done
Did I do it? - Yes!
Do I regret it? - No!
A broken man from a broken race
How's things in your ravished kingdom
You bitch about respect and recognition
But you haven't done shit to earn it

C'mon in - we'll go toe to toe and I'll fuck you up
Grow - enter the sound of smashed human bone

Oh, you fucking cockroach
Who's to stand and who will fall
Blood and tears now sting your eyes
Keep going don't you dare to stall

Defeat - you stood your ground but lost your teeth
Grow - only the dead have seen the end of war
I fear no man
I love no one
I won't pay for what I have done
Did I do it? - Yes!
Do I regret it? - No!
