Sever my lifeline...
All I have even piss can replace
I bide my time...
Hope's deformed in my life, my strife

I know how it ends but when did it start
I guess the blade holds all the answers
These crude clues to a secret unfold
Here's my life, now swallow it whole
Now swallow it whole
Now take a moment
Catch your breath
I'll make you choke on your plastic pride

Inherit my load,
Carry my stone
My life - my sacrifice
My sacrifice
Tell me - what do you see when you picture me
A blind stare in your own reflection
Words lose all meaning
As I fall into the pit that you dug for me

We love the smell and we adore the taste
Of compassion now thrown away as waste
The level of bitterness in my veins
Even if I end it now, it will stay the same
Will stay the same
Now take a moment
Catch your breath
I'll make you choke on your plastic pride

Inherit my load,
Carry my stone
My life - my sacrifice
My sacrifice

[Music: Carlsson, Lyrics: Aro]
