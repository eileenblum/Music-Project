Dusk falls outside my window
As I turn into the other me
In my sleep I leave myself
And become totally free
In this state of subconsciousness
It feels so wonderful to hate
I can't resist the tempting feeling
For the emotions to overtake
Oh God, I want to see you suffer
The pain you caused reversed on to you
Almost real, but still a dream
Without a sound, I can hear you scream
Every breath brings me further
Inside my vengeful mind
The trust I gave, you threw away
You killed my self esteem with a smile
I fight myself to forgive you
But I couldn't hate you more
Every night I see you die
No kiss goodnight, just goodbye
Oh God, I want to see you suffer
The pain you caused reversed on to you
You took it all, so I'll take your life
A dream of blood and a stabbing knife
With your blood and a piece of paper
I leave my legacy to mankind
These are my words of hatred
This is my book of blood
On every page I sealed your fate
In my diary of hate
Oh God, I want to see you suffer
The pain you caused reversed on to you
Almost real, but still a dream
Without a sound, I can hear you scream

Oh God, I want to see you suffer
The pain you caused reversed on to you
You took it all, so I'll take your life
A dream of blood and a stabbing knife
