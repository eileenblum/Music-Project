Side-tracked in your quest for redemption
All you got was a mouth full of cum
"The son of god" you say, well big fucking deal
I'll slay the angels that took you to their grace

Satan saves - Satan saves your soul

I watch you praying for the weak and hopeless
I ask you why? they're fucking lost and useless
You're only wasting your time, blind leading the blind
Name one who'll truly save your soul
Can't fail to miss
The foul stench of piss
And my hand on your head, pushing you down
As you're desperately gasping for air
Who am I?
Whats my name?
I am the beast you wish you could tame
I am the plague that's keeping you sick
I am the heretic
The son of god
What a fucking scam
Holy man?
A fucking deadbeat in a cloak
Now you bought it hook, line and sinker
Another pawn in the global hoax
Deep down within, we're all born of sin
Take heed as I enter your life
Who am I?
Whats my name?
I am the beast you wish you could tame
I am the plague that's keeping you sick
I am the heretic
