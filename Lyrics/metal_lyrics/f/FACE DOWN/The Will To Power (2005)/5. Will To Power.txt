"I hate all the fucking human race. I get a kick out of murdering people."

...Many believe that serial killers are insane,
but the most chilling fact is that they are invariably rational and calculating.
They know what they are doing is wrong but they simply do not care.
They are essentially without conscience...

...Multiple murders may involve the most extreme of violent behaviors,
including sadism, necrophilia, or cannibalism,
but this does not mean the killer is insane...

...The reality of the crime is never as perfect as the fantasy,
so serial murderers must kill again and again
in an almost futile attempt to live out their ultimate murderous desires...

A distorted social message
A covert killing spree
Thinning the conventional herd
To forever live on in infamy

You feel my detached hatred
As I become your god
I'll wipe your whole world out
I rip your loved ones limb from limb
I wish you all had one neck
And I had my hands on it
Born to lose, live to kill
Embrace the divinity
The power over life and death
My psychopathic will

You used to think that you were safe
How does that feel now?
Your useless life extinguished
You're now another worthless corpse
I wish you all had one neck
And I had my hands on it

You feel my detached hatred
As I become your god

I'll wipe your whole world out
As I rip your loved ones limb from limb
"I've been all around the world, and I've seen everything but hell,
and I guess I'll see that soon."

"I wish you all had one neck,
and that I had my hands on it."
