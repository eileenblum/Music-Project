War, war never changes.
Since the dawn of human kind destiny was signed by the universe.
The ceiling turned grey, then red, then black, then nothing.
Nothing upon us.
What remained was suffocating us.
But it was not as they were pretending; the end of the world, the end of the world.
It's their fault but who paid in full, who paid that price, was us.
Here no one ever enters, here no one ever leaves.
The noise outside is over, but flowers won't bloom ever again.
They say this is life.
But this is a jail, our own prison made of what brought us six feet under.
But I was not born to follow others dreams, I got mine.
I need to blind my corneas watching the sun filling the rotting firmament and breathe again.
I need to break the cycle, this chronosphere won't freeze my mind.
Release my synapses and erase this black and white.
I am reborn from ashes and fire in the skies, I must rejoin the Earth and embrace her forever.
Set us free from the deep end we will overcome.
Spiraling through existence, climbing walls of memories.
The summit looks radiant.
