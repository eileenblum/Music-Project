Voices, inner voices towards my mind.
Even an illusion may be haunted and afflicted by those irresolutions within me.
Watch my fate, my disgrace.
Fighting no one, fearing it all.
Gently falling from the hands of God.
Insomnia is taking me away from you, those sheets entangle my daily grind.
When lights fall and darkness borns my mind gets blind.
Half sleeping in Limbo.
Insomnia is taking me away from you, those sheets entangle my daily grind.
Voices, inner voices towards my mind.
Headed by those golden strings Iâm a mannequin living on the edge of this world.
To the edge of the world.
While I fall, I am dreaming to transcend the end.
