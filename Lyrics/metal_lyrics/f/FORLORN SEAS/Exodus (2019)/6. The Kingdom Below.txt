We, humans, are fragile
We, humans, are so weak

They refused the brighter star, while the night cradled the seeds of the roots growing beneath what death spared.
But it still exists through the tunnels of our sphere, hollow mindless brains, glorifying the endless void, still regretting what means to suffer.

While those lost souls clapper claw from the inside to evade from a prison made of flesh
Time goes on and the echoes of the past, devour slowly.

Bunch of bones, carrions wandering in the underworld.
The forgot-ten ones.
Hidden from our sights, desecrating the land we called-home.

We, inhumans, were fragile
We, inhumans, were so weak

Everlasting intervals in which I try to find myself.
I've forgotten what I was.
And my face stands no more.
May death save me.

May death, death save me.
Displace this torment ignore my blaring screams.
I'm the keeper of this venom's effect.
We earn to exist to feed the nightmares.
May death save us.

This is not, this is not what I'm meant to be.
Where I turn my eyes all I can see is silence.
All I want is to go backwards, when the flame burnt brighter.
'Cause I didn't belong to this reign guided by decay.
I'm not part of this.
Too many times the scythe spared me from demise.
I became a living end, what they call "the lost one".
Hunted as a prey, I miss it all, misgiving thoughts,
Searching for a reason to keep going on.

But

Spending whole time trying to blame ourselves
Will not change the reason why we're still here:
Leaving the past behind,
Resurgence is what we aim for.
