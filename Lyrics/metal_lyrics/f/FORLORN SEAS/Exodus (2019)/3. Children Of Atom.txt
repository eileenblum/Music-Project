"My friends, give your bodies to Atom. Release yourselves to his power, feel his glow and be divided."

Angels fall from grace through a veil of discord.
Joining hands with God doesn't mean you're spared for salvation.
We need war and worship the disease to gather everything.
Our king and lord consists of steel and sparks, leading us to the joy it holds inside.
That day will be our healing, our rebirth.
Now it's time to take part of the only truth.
We pray to sunder our lives for more.
Dismembering our souls to create new life from rust: a forgotten empire.
Their children, our father, concealing disorder.
