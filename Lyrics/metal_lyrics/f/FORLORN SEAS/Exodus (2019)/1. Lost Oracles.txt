I still feel the weight of this never-ending circle filling my days, this balance scares me and drives me insane. Nothing is changing, nothing is changing.
The realization of this state of mind is driving my life out of its rails.
I try to avoid the irreversible crack with my last ounce of strength, to break the circle.
I remain under the sunlight watching the dying light over the horizon.
This place is not my home but I can't find something better to gain something to live for.
All this beauty, will fade away, I foresee this through all this quiet.
Heavy living
Heavy breathing
I remain under the sunlight watching the dying light over the horizon.
This place is not my home but I can't find something better to breathe again.
Where is the rest of my joy? I lost it in this place.
All this beauty fades away, fades away.
Heavy breathing, living.
Foresee through all this quiet that the end is coming soon.
On her wings made of steel and fire, she's aiming at us.
We still feel the weight of this never-ending circle filling our days.
When all will crumble, we'll never be the same. Nothing is changing, nothing is changing, but will.
