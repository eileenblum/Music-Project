Stand aside as Inferno's flames get higher and higher.
We cannot waste a single drop to save our lives from this threat.
As smoke unfolds we hope to see thin slices of heaven
'Cause senses never fail to believers.
If only we could have knew that our guiding star was fading away.
Now it seems that we blind each others with the same source of light.
We need to fight radiation, the only common enemy, disenchant, realize,
The clock is ticking and we are the hands.
We are the hands.
The weight of the world is growing over our shoulders and makes our bones crushing slowly, locking all the safe ways.
Our throat is dry but all we need is driving the ship faster to a dead end.
Mayday, push our vessel over the edge, taming the waves of extermination.
When we'll taste the ocean inside of us; our burning corpses will reanimate.
A brilliant sun will greet our words in vain.
At the end of it all we'll find the answers,
Even deserted hearts may turn to water springs.
At the end of it all we'll find the answers,
The purpose of our journey and why it has begun.
