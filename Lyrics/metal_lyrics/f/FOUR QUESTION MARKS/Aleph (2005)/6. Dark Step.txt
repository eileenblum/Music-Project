Eyes of tears the throat,
Thight compressed, fear of becoming.
Tightened soul absurd, step by step.
Looking forward of. 
Indivisible, heart upset, inconstancy of life.

Oppressed,
Silent cold indistinct.
Madness,
Undecipherable.
Voice,
Sound of distress anguish.
Darkness,
Mind annihilation.

Endlessly, dedicate, tolerant,
Alienate. restless.
Unstable, disabled, unsettled,
Unable, confess.
Systematic anonymous,
Fictitious, figurine, dead shadow.

Commended secrets fall.
Eye-Less,
Increasing of distortion.
Breath. 
Cold. low, gone, scob.
Face-less,
Satisfying lost control.

Out of reach the light,
Declining. So fast.
Now silently darken.
Reality consumed,
Dreams shattered, denied.
Dark Step entrance of the night.
