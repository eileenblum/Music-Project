Dismembered one.
An unmasked soul face to face.
To meet the inside.

TruthfulL thoughts,
Burried under silent mask.
A convulsive amnesy.

Evicted voice.
To cover all, celled: endlessly
Forgotten, never lost, deep in the,

Mind wounds still never shut.
Wet eyes hidden in the heart.

Low,
So far inside.
Beyond tears, dreariness,
Forgetfullness,
So, fragility unscathed.
Now,
Eyes wide open.
Active memories, repression absurd.
Past in the present persistence.

Down.
Dismembered amnesy endlessly fragility,
memories persistence. Tears.
Sinking deep into infinite sadness,
So, Dark abysmal collapse, silently, Down.
Dismembered amnesy endlessly fragility,
memories persistence. Tears.
Sinking deep into infinite sadness,
So, Inner anguish a fear to be.
Alone.

Throat load meanless words absurd silent.
Broken existence broken silence.
Throat load meanless words absurd silent.
Frozen afflicted present fall down.

Dismembered amnesy endlessly fragility,
memories persistence. Tears.
Sinking, deep into infinite sadness,
So, Dark abysmal collapse, silently.
Fall down.
