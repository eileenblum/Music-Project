Suspended time,
Eyes full of night.
Out of control,
About to fall.
Frozen.
Movements becoming so hard.
Blood running wild.
Distortion of perception.
Darken.
Legs petrified,
Face denial.
Hands disabled,
Body dispersal.

Static collapse, fall.
Iflexible gesture,
Ineffectiv.
Weakening trial.
Intensity,
Fall down.

Dancing pictures,
Lethal failure.
Perfidious,
Polymorphous,
Stiffness.
Conscious hope of early death.
Terminal bliss.
Futile self-preservation.
Focus.
Steril struggle.
Hunched up structure,
To steadiness,
Restless Invasion.


Trouble,
Inner Implosion,
Moments of confusion,
Devastation.
Silent.
Crawling time fragment,
A full body deviance.
Incandescent.
Immobility,
To apoplexy
Static reality,
Catalepsy.
Stronger,
Pain of disorder.
Executive trigger,
Deliverer.

Bionic cage.
Cell, drain, dead, cold,
Flesh, sour, life's, end.
