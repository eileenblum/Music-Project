Tell me this, Now.
So tell me this...

Mistakes come through a lack of choice
I can't decide, is it really worth it?
Feeling alone, and by yourself
I cannot be the way you wanted me

Looking back can't you see nothing's changed,
Everything's been re-arranged disgraced
I can't take this, can't tell you that

See why I try,
You only see what you want to see
Why cant you be,
Here alone, and I know how it is!

Pressures building and now its time for
Decisions made and I find it so hard
To grasp the fact that I'm the one who is to blame
For all the mistakes that have come through lack of thought!

Looking back can't you see nothing's changed,
Everything's been re-arranged disgraced
I can't take this, can't tell you that

See why I try,
You only see what you want to see
Why cant you be,
Here alone, and I know how it is!

Seen what you've said before
Telling me time and time again, always seems
Life isn't changing but I am
To forget, seen what you've said before

Tell me this, now...
So tell this,
Tell me this NOW!
So tell me this! NOW!
So tell me this! NOW!
So tell me this! NOW!
So tell me this...
