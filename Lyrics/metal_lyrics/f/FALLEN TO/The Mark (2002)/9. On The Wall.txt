You left me here
Thinking you were indispensable
I face my fears
It only seems as if it's nothing more than mistakes
I've tried to be more than you and more
So help me find myself

[Chorus:]
It's gone away, yes
If it's not a lot, but
Seems so strange I
I can't forget you

I don't want to see your tears
I don't want to know what you've been told
Can't waste my time
Feeling alone
I'm sacrificing my own soul
Won't you let me be there?

[Chorus 2x]

[Bridge:]
Why can't you understand why I am this way?
And because of this
I cannot live
So no more

[Chorus 2x]
