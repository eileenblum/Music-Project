you told me I can't be this way
I proved you wrong again
I helped you see yourself for what you really are
I've made mistakes and now you pay for what you've done
but life is just a game, the prize is your death

look down into this blackened world
I cannot help myself
I've tried so hard to find but I'm the one to blame

and now you told me that I can't be this way
you told me I should try

the things I want to say and do
they can't understand what this means to me
this priceless misery

and now you told me that I can't be this way
you told me I should try
motherfucker!
and now you told me that I can't be this way
you told me I should try
