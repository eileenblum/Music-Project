The Crucifix immersed in piss
The Holy Virgin smeared in excrement
The body of Christ in disembowelment
The words of Christ mocked and twisted

The Son of God called a bastard
The Word of God torn to pieces
The House of God desecrated
When all is told, when itâs said and done

Iâd hate to be you!
