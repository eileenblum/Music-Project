Everyone who follows Satanâs evil schemes
Shall bring swift destruction on their heads
Exploiting their children with satanic lies
Harm for harm shall be destroyed and perish in their death
For My Lord did not spare the angels when they sinned
But He cast them straight to hell
Sodom and Gomorrah condemned
By burning them to ashes
Example of the sentence of the wicked

Throwing down in violence
With the serpent on fire
My Lord will execute
Judgment on all men
Many are those slain by My Lord

Hear the roar
Coming from the city
Tremble at His words
Hear the noise from the temple
Itâs the wrath
The sound of my Lord
Repaying all His enemies all that they deserve

Now go out
Look on the dead bodies
Those who rebelled against my Lord
Their worm will not die
Their fire wonât be quenched
So now they rot in executionâs fury

Throwing down in violence
With the serpent on fire
My Lord will execute
Judgment on all men
Many are those slain by My Lord

Children of the Serpent, Oh accursed brood!
Their souls delight in their abominations
I will choose harsh treatment for them
I will bring upon them what they dread
For when I called no one answered
When I spoke no one listened to me
Doing evil in my sight
They shall meet their end together

When you face my wrath
You will pray for death
It will not come
