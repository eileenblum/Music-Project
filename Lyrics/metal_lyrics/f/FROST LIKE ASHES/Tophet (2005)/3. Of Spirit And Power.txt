Before the dawn we gather we are drawn
Moving in cold state
With hearts of fire, of Spirit and of power
We enter sacred halls to quench a thirst so vast so great
In these hallowed halls
Is knowledge for the Called
Derived from the Source
Our concoctions lain before us
Seven feasts arranged in chorus
Bowed heads signal entry of the force

Shiloh, Shiloh
Glory of battles won
Shiloh, Shiloh
Victories to come
Shiloh, Shiloh
Praise for battles fought
Shiloh, Shiloh
Crowns adorn the Sought

Teaching our eyes to see beyond our minds
Behold the spiritual realms
Revealing the war and what the Spirit has in store
These ancient mysteries provide a way
Drinking of blood and tasting bitter hyssop
Enlightening the soul
Accept this sacrifice
Disemboweling whatâs inside
Laid in a watergrave and from this death we rise

Gannon, Chapman, Eckel
Standing proud to greet their sons
Upon seeing the destruction
To the enemy done
To the King they offer these Warriors of Blood

Drinking of blood and tasting bitter hyssop
Enlightening the soul
Accept this sacrifice
Disemboweling whatâs inside
Laid in a watergrave and from this death we rise
For before the dawn we gather, we are drawn
Moving in cold state
With hearts of fire, of Spirit and of power
We curse the darkness and destroy our enemies

Curses and Destruction
