I've seen the future... And you die

All faces wax pale...

Deep within the trembling begins
Trumpets sounding warning and war
Watching from a tower of sin
Over the mountain
Comes the Black Swarm
As the dawn spreading
His dark army comes raging
A day of gloom and darkness
Nothing at all can escape
They move as horses of war
Ears bleeding from the roar
And the sound of crackling fire
They leap from peak onto peak
They move with a blink of the eye
They scale the walls like locust
They crush through all defenses
They do not break their ranks

Tear and shred your hearts
For they are coming for you
They fly from the sky like hail
All faces wax pale...
What dread to be found
In grasp of an angry God
At the lifting of the veil
All faces wax pale...

Going on before them a raging fire consumes
Left in wake behind them a blazing fire burns
Lain in glory before them a virgin garden looms
Lain in waste behind them a raped and desolate urn
They rush into the city
Pitch black flood pouring over the walls
There is no refuge from them
Through each crevice they crawl
They enter through the windows as warriors drawn for battle
At the very sight of their shadows
The blood drains from every face

Tear and shred your hearts
For they are coming for you
They fly from the sky like hail
All faces wax pale...
What dread to be found
In grasp of an angry God
At the lifting of the veil
All faces wax pale...

Lord Sabaoth screams before His great army and mighty army
The Strong execute His Word
Who can endure it?
Open your spiritual eyes
Even now they come your way
You cannot stand against them
The hounds of Heaven seek your soul
No one and nothing at all can escape this force
They do not break their ranks
Who can endure it?
There is no refuge from them and you cannot stand against them
See, even now they come your way
The hounds of Heaven seek your soul
Seek your soul!
