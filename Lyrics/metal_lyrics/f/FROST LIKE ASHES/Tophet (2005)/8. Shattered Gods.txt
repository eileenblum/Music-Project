I am the War Club
The weapon for battle
I shatter nations
I destroy kingdoms
I shatter horse and rider
Chariot and driver
I shatter man and woman
I shatter boy and maiden

I come with a destroyer
And you will be shattered!
As in the days of Midianâs defeat
You will be shattered!
Stand with the gods of Marduk
And you will be shattered!
Devise your strategies
And you will be shattered!

Lift up the banner
Sound the trumpet
Prepare for battle
For I come like a locust swarm
You will become
A heap of ruins
A haunt for jackals
The object of horror and scorn

I come with a destroyer
And you will be shattered!
As in the days of Midianâs defeat
You will be shattered!
Stand with the gods of Marduk
And you will be shattered!
Devise your strategies
And you will be shattered!

By Azahel, by Sebat
By Adonijah, by Qoheleth
How broken and shattered
Is the hammer of the earth!
How broken and shattered
Is the hammer of the earth!

Baal and Anubis, Belial and Osiris
Molech and Lillith, Odin and Ounis
I will throw you away
Like a menstrual rag
You are nothing more
Than menstrual blood!

Like whirlwinds sweeping
The invader comes
From a land of terror
My way is a whirlwind and storm
Silent! You Madmen!
I pile your corpses
On the lifeless forms
Of your worthless gods!

I come with a destroyer
And you will be shattered!
As in the days of Midianâs defeat
You will be shattered!
Stand with the gods of Marduk
And you will be shattered!
Devise your strategies
And you will be shattered!
