This, My Prayer

Let me slit the throats of the sirens
Let me raze the walls of Troy
Let me grasp Mjollnir
Let me crush the head of Thor

Let me see the Golden Fleece
Hung rusted on its pole
Let me spill the blood of Elizabeth
And down her own throat pour

Grant me the strength
of the Wooden Stake
Grant me the strength
of Amulet Senoy

Let me violate Lillith
The whore of filth and dregs
Cast on her back, submissive
Craver of rancid sperm

Let me ascend the gates of Valhalla
Slay Valkyries and Einherjar
Drag Odin from its burning ruins
Again on the tree hang

Grant me the strength
of the Frostgiants
Grant me the strength
of Fenrir

Mocking Us
Fools to Us
Who's the Strong One now?
Bow to Us
Compared to Us
Shadows on the Sun

Let me be the crusher of Satan
Let me be the one
Who sees him bow his knee
To You, Lord of Sabaoth

Odin
One eyed drunken fool
Lillith
Demonic filthy whore
Set-Hen
Bound in eternal dark
Lucifer
I laugh as you're cast down!
Impotent!

Let me be the crusher of Satan
Let me be the one
Who sees him bow his knee
To You, Lord of Sabaoth

Let me be the Serpent of Sabaoth
Devouring the spineless Marduk
Baal is only wood and stone
His canting prophets gone

Let me cause the Baphomet's throne
To be a place for human waste
Let me castrate the Baphomet
In Phallustine disgraced

Grant me the strength
of the Lord of Host
Grant me the strength
of the Holy Ghost

Mocking Us
Fools to Us
Who's the Strong One now?
Bow to Us
Compared to Us
Shadows on the Sun"
