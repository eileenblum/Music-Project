The searing heat is fading
The fire that burned my skin
My blistered flesh is cooling
With the dying rays of Sun
Dying Sun

The howling winds bring comfort to my weary soul
And I close my eyes and welcome home
The Cold

The dawn of the season of death
Brings a grin to my parched lips
And now the very best of all
Nightfall

The moon in all its brilliance
Shimmers through the chrystalled sky
To illuminate this winterâs night
And smiles as nature dies
Nature dies

I hear the silence as it permeates the dark
Like a mournful funeral dirge thatâs nightly performed
Iâm reborn

âIf eternity were made of this cold winter wind
And if home is where I lie, forever here I remainâ

âIf eternity were made of this cold winter wind
And if itâs here I die, Iâll die satisfiedâ¦Iâll die satisfied
