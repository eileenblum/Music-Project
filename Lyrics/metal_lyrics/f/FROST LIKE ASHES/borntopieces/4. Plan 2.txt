[Saint Cover]

No mercy for the devil no mercy for the foe
The King shall wad him up Throw him away
Then cast him to the rocks of never ending scald
This shall all take place Sure as you hear me say
He will burn the damned He will burn the beast
On that white throne day All will hear the cry
The evil one will die forever shedding tears of pain
Let's give glory to the King
He conquered death and hell to set His children free
Let's give glory to the King
He cleansed us from our sins He tasted death for all to see
Disaster it controls the hardened hearts of men
Providing them with pride and despair But He's the
King of all that lives and that breathes
He's the Lord of Lords His judgments are all fair
On that final day He'll rise above the clouds
All will see His wounds and sigh
It's plain for all to see He is the risen King
He has the keys to death and hell Attached on to His side
He will burn the damned He will burn the beast
On that white throne day All will hear the cry
The evil one will die forever shedding tears of pain
Let's give glory to the King
He conquered death and hell to set His children free
Let's give glory to the King
He cleansed us from our sins He tasted death for all to see
Let's give glory to the King
Now the devil hands are tied and none of us will have to die
Let's give glory to the King
