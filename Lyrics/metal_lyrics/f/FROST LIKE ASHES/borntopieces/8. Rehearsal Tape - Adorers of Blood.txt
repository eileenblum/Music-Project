You are the Ancient One
The Ancient of Days
The end and the beginning
The object of my praise
Youâre the Morning Star
Youâre the Midnight Sun
I Am that I Am
Youâre the Victory won
Youâre Lord Sabaoth
Father, Son, mysterious Ghost
Nefarious tremble in fear
Of Your terrible host
You make the Moon blood
Turn the Sun to black
You have slain thousands
With a single Spirit

We are adorers of blood
The Blood spilt from Your veins
The Blood we drink in Eucharist
The Blood we bathe our bodies in
Blood-wrought Salvation

Youâre the Sacrifice of Blood
The Firstborn of the dead
Corpse fulfilled with sin
Word manifest to flesh
Slayer of serpents
Impending death of death
Castrator of sin
The bitter wine of Wrath
We are the possessed
Possession Aeternus
Your blood flows in our veins
We are The Victorious
Others charge You with murder
Others shake their fists at You
Others donât realize
Your Blood covers them too

We are adorers of blood
The blood spilt from your veins
The blood we drink in Eucharist
The blood we bathe our bodies in

On that same night
I will pass through and strike down every firstborn
I will bring judgment on all gods
The Blood will be a sign for you
When I see the Blood, I will pass over you
No destructive plague will touch you
When I strike

Bathe me in Your Blood
Baptize me in Fire
Pour your Spirit on me
Fill my cup higher and higher and higher and higher and higher!!
