I have immortal life through
The Blood of Jesus Christ, I
Was unleashed from the chains of sin and death
I will never die, no
Redeemed, life of freedom
Eternal salvation, seated in heavenly places

I am immortal
I live forever

How sweet it is
Not to fear death
And how sweet
To know â¦Truth

Now when you lay down to sleep
I pray the Lord your soul to keep
But if you should die before you wake

Go ahead and meet your death
Go ahead and feed the worms
Be content to vanish after your demise
But I will not follow you, no
Your way so pitifully mortal
Iâve been unleashed from this coil I leave this life Immortal!

I am immortal
I live forever
