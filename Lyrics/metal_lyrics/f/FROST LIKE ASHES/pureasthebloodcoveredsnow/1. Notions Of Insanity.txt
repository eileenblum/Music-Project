Thrown to the wolves and you relish the pain
Like a shriveled weed in a rotted bouquet
Glutted on death and you're thirsty again
And like a dog, you return to your vomit
Your place of sorrows and all of your torments
Has become your home and all of your best friends
To quench your addiction inject the drug that has filled you
And to fulfill your life turn to the one that will kill you
Mercy to you
Oh, pearls before swine
God is mythology
In your twisted mind
You're an open grave
A festering tomb
You live like an animal
And you'll die like on too
You're an accusing spirit; expose the dust in one's eye
While your empty sockets swarm with maggots inside
Diseases infests you, infections make you blind
Yet you lie in your cesspool swollen in pride
Scream of your rights, instincts and your freedoms
As you gaze through the bars of diseased addictions
Go ahead, serve your master-for I know him well
He'll throw you scraps from his table until you're devoured in Hell
To not believe in God
That does not mean
You believe in nothing, rather
You'll believe in anything
Thrown to the wolves and you relish the pain
Glutton of death and you hunger again
Your place of sorrows and all of your torments
Has become a razed fortress and your God-forsaken friends
