Bleak fucking emptiness
Black winter inside the head
Black doom prophecy
Of hate and misery

Fucked up, no control, rage
Isolated, bitter, bleeding hate

Reborn through addiction
Crawling into grave
Self-inflicted mind wounds
Scars that never heal

Fucked up, no control, rage
Isolated, bitter, bleeding hate

These scars that never heal
Are bleeding hate
