For there is a tomorrow
Convince yourself to hold on
Recover!
Your will, for it will be done

For the mourning in your heart
There is no cause
You're the one to blame
Abandon your disguise
Turn this life

Awake to reality
Pierce the surface
To rise and shine

Bring back
Bring back
All those peaceful times
Bring back
All those memories
You can swim unto the shore
This insecurity will be no more

For the mourning in your heart
There is no cause
You're the one to blame
Abandon your disguise
Turn this life

Awake to reality
Pierce the surface
To rise and shine

Take your heart
There is a way
Through this
Century of demise

Turn this life
And become
Who you always wanted to be
