It's an eclipse of failure
You build it up it falls down
No matter how hard you hold me
I will fall down

Forsaken, in a world of saints
I try to resist
It's an eclipse of failure
When you prevail

Due to your cold control
I was so lonely that night

Forsaken in a world of saints
I try to resist

All light is devoured by you
But I can feel the wind blowing
Throwing hopes in my face
In a world of greed

This is genocide
In abundance
Not to safe humanity at all
There are sick
Sick of you
And your endless lies

How cold are you
Grieving everything
Pariah wakes up
He, who finally hunts you down

You say
Hunt them down
Hunt them down
Hunt them down

Kill the heretics
Take their hopes and dreams
Take their everything
Kill the heretics
Take their hopes and dreams
Take their everything

All light is devoured by you
But I can feel the wind blowing
Throwing hopes in my face
In a world of greed
