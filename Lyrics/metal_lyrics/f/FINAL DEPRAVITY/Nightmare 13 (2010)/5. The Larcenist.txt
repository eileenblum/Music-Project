Now, will we reap what we seed
Will our priest help us to reach our dreams

Traitors, they take everything but there will be vengeance
Prayers, you search for truth in all those eyes full of lies

Your life and everything you love will be taken away
The larcenist, is your decay

Redemption is the only path you made me go through
Leaders, you have caused this eternal way, my long road of pain

My life and everything I loved, was taken away
The larcenist, was my decay

There will be vengeance
There is redemption
In your heart
(In your heart)
