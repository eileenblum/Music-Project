It begins to starve
Longing with greed
Ruin led by its hands
We will, we will fade to ashes

One more step
Til we reach the threshold of our death
Dreaming endlessly
Now, fear's taking over

Sky is blackened by their hordes
Spawned by our cruelty
There's no more time to change
We are at their mercy
