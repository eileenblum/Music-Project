Rerun it no more
Please end the mourning
Oh, turn this
To something normal
Beliefs are fading
At the sight of the very last seconds
Veins are tightening
End of the story

Burnt in martyrdom
Risen from the ashes
Downfall into nothing

Carrying weight of
A world with dismal sinners
It's common
Regular
That some people have
To break down in this warzone
We might fall, yeah
We might fall

Burnt in martyrdom
Risen from the ashes
Downfall into nothing
We all
Go overboard
