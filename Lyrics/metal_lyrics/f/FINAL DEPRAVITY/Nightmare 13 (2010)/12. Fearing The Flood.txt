It is seizing me and tears me down
In a sea of demise where I will drown
There is failure
And I am shouting for fire

And they said we were safe!

Trench my grave
It'll be forgotten
It'll be away washed away

This is a noview trail
And I wander slowly on it
The flood grabs me
And i am following

And they said we were safe!

Trench my grave
It'll be forgotten
It'll be away washed away

Oh
How deep I have sunk?
Truely I am praying now
I see those eyes
Letting me suffer
Suffer
Letting me suffer
Suffer

The rising tide
Will throw me down
