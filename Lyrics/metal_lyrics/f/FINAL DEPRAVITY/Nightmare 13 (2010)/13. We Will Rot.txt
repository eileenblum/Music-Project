Is this how far you'll go
There's nothing in my hands
But take a look in my eyes
There's something you
Can't take away
From me
Can't take it away from me!

'Cause we are brothers
We will rot

Senses are way too weak
Destroy the loveful sounds
This is my dream
It can not be erased

With every second I live
For my hearts in disgrace
If there's no hope for me
There's still a hope for us

'Cause we are brothers
We will rot

I will repent for what they've done
We will bring salvation to the heart of one

As we lay rotting on the streets
You took the easy way out
There is no responsibility that you could have for us
We are minds of people fleeing south
We are forgotten leaves of trees burning brightly

If they cut off your leg take mine
If they cut off your arm take mine
But protect your heart, cause a shot to it
Is a shot to mine

I will stand and receive this bullet
There is nothing that I can fear now
With this conspiracy
I was whole again
