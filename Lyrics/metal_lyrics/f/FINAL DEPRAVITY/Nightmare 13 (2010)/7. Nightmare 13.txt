Right!

Ride the back of the fallen Devil
Don't fall into the evil lies
My perception becomes scary
I lose my will to live
I will die when I do not obey
My honor fades away

Illusions, confusions
Depressions, dimensions
Nightmare 13
Illusions, confusions
Depressions, worlds collapsing
Nightmare 13

The horror goes on
I lose the game I played
For that child screaming apology
For me it is too late
I would enter the darkest tombs
For me safe and dead

Illusions, confusions
Depressions, dimensions
Nightmare 13
Illusions, confusions
Depressions, worlds collapsing
Nightmare 13

You only erase everything

Explode
The time has come to face all your inner fears
We're all raped by the human race

This is reality

Illusions, confusions
Depressions, dimensions
Nightmare 13
Illusions, confusions
Depressions, worlds collapsing
Nightmare 13

Nightmare 13
Please kill me now!

The day we revolt is today
We'll spill their blood for our rage
The day we revolt is today
