For my redemption, I release my fears
My beliefs flow down those evil rivers
Nothing to lose, but it gave me strength

Incomprehensible

For all of you who thought they were safe
You are completely wrong

We will witness a murder, of whom you were taught
Everybody pray for salvation

We are disparted, to the walls
Only through struggle we'll find peace
And the ignition of our hate, drives us to carry on

Incomprehensible

for all of you who thought they were safe
You are completely wrong

We will witness a murder, of whom you were taught
Everybody pray for salvation

Fuck!
All those lies senseless cries, your hurt
This relieving end comes now!
It will kill and torture
This is your disease and this will be your cure
