You let our children
Starve for your intent
Untold bloodshed, policy
Of retaliation
Triggering new menaces
We are subjects
Of those sick experiments

If you exact
Dissolution
We are taking our burden
With honor

Sitting back
Watching how it grabs a stream of down
Sitting back
Watching how it grabs a stream of down

Dismal
Is our future
We are waiting
For this veil of secrecy
To be pierced
Spirals of truth rupture the clouds
We can not hope
For these bullets to be spawned

If you exact
Dissolution
We are taking our burden
With honor

Sitting back
Watching how it grabs a stream of down
Sitting back
Watching how it grabs a stream of down

I'm aware of
Your control
But I'm revolting
Against your oath
This is to die for
And this I vow
I'll go on standing
On these ground of home

Sitting back
Watching how it grabs a stream of down
Sitting back
Watching how it grabs a stream of down
