Falling from heaven's skies
Our life runs out
Industrial hate destroys our grounds
You are climbing up your throne you rat
To see your genocide

"Assassinate!"

Burn the lies to the fucking ground
And annihilate those who drop bombs

I hear a pulse
That shouts your life to burn
It came of my home that's grieving
Thousands of brothers have died for you
Now it is your turn

Burn the lies, to the fucking ground
And annihilate, those who drop bombs

With every freedom speech
I'm screaming at your face, you are the source of your cries
And now I"m standing here, in the middle of nowhere
You were everything to be taken away

My nerves are numb
All I feel is hate
For all the things you done
I have to take your life

I cured all my wounds
Now everything is dead
I'm gonna take you down
Down to Hell!

She was the one to keep me alive, because of you
I know how it feels, when we die

There was no solution
There was no way out
Now we are standing on your grave!

"Prophets
Presidents
Pull us out"

"Prophets
Fathers"
Your sins are my foundation
