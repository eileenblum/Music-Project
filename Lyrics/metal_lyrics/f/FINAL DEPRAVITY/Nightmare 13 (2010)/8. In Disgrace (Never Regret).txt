One lonely father
Having sons to feed
He prays to our father
To give those boys just what they need

Cohesion
Of a family
Makes them wonder
For what they
Are living
But fuck it

And you are enchained
to watch your soul
Leaving the cyst
Watch the beast storm upon you

Smell the stench of morality

Cohesion
Of a family
Makes them wonder
For what they
Are living
But fuck it

And you are enchained
To watch your soul
Leaving the cyst
Watch the beast storm upon you

There is no comprehension
For the things you've done
In fact there was nothing
That'll help you overcome

And they will spawn the movement

Your family interferes
There is love in this verse
To abandon the curse

You are not in the place
To die in a slow pace
Watch them bleed
In disgrayayce

Never regret!
Never regrehehet!

Watch them bleed
In disgrace
