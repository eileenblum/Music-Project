I follow the leader, with every step I take
Open my ears to receive my orders
The air is sickening but I hold on
The world is heavy but I hold on

Vortex
Vortex (Come to me)
Vortex (Come rescue me)

This is unreal, a scorn of life
Seeing nothing, touching heartbeats
My reaper will guide my way
This vicinity is my decay

Vortex
Vortex (Come to me)
Vortex (Come rescue me)

With every minute my neck grows tighter
Please release this burden, ignite the fire

I'm sitting in death's shadow the reaper decides
I will take my last breath before I go down

This eternal flame, is crossing the wall
The seal is broken one more time
Now it is raining from the skies
But there was no

Vortex
Vortex (Come to me)
Vortex (Come rescue me)

This is eternal
This flame will rise
The Heaven we used to know
Is now a grave of Gods
