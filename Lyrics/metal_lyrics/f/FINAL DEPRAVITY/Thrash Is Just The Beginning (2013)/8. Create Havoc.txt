Look into their eyes
Don't care what they feel
Make no deal, don't compromise
Give them a sore
One that never heals
Too much time is lost

I don't know if it's right or wrong
I'm not quite sure but it must be done

You drove me to insanity
Now I skip morality
Society is a failure
Here comes some reality

The voice in my head
Keeps telling me stuff like that
Rip your skin, smash your face
Take your breath until you're dead

I don't know if it's right or wrong
I'm not quite sure but it must be done

You drove me to insanity
Now I skip morality
Society is a failure
Here comes some reality

Now the time has come
I know it's right not wrong
Now I feel it, it must be done
Soon you will be gone

You drove me to insanity
Now I skip morality
Society is a failure
Here comes some reality
