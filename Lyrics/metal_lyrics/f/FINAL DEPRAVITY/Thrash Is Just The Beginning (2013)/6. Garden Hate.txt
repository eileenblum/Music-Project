Expelled, erased, neutralized
By death we won't deny
Our misery fulfills
Fear eternally of the unknown
There's no dawn anymore

Life to death
Death to life
We're standing at the gates to
Garden hate

Seems like the way is endless
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
In nothing we can trust
At the gates to garden hate

From souls to our hearts
Till death do us part
Death came as a release

We're standing at the gates to
Garden hate

Seems like the way is endless
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
In nothing we can trust
At the gates to garden hate

Feels like we're falling
Into the path
Where gods tear us apart

Everything around here
Anything we've found
Except for fear

Life, fear, chaos, death
Misery's gate to nothingness

An endless way
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
In nothingness we trust
At the gates to garden hate
