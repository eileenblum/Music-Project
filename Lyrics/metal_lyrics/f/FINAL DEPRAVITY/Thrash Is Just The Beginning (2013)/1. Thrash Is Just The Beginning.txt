Nightmare - that's how it began
Long gone, now the crows are dead
Few stayed, most left
Broke the oath and vanished instead
New breed, meet your fear
That's what's going on in here
Nice try, worthless creeps
How you're feeling in the rear

Times have changed
So have we, rearranged all that was
Exploring what was then and is now
Thrash was just the beginning

Violence - we've been screaming for
Conquered shores never been before
Now we're back even more
All the power's been restored
Spill the blood, break them bones
Kill 'em all, turn new stones
So we go all the way
Never gone and here to stay

Times have changed
So have we, rearranged all that was
Exploring what is now and was then
Thrash is just the beginning
