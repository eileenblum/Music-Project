Dark times have come
Unholy storms and a lighting sky
The air we're breathing
Like rotten flesh
Grace is falling
Feathers are raining

The prediction
The fall of angels
The dark explores
The gift of heaven
And learn to fly above

Spirits will decay
The prediction's rise
Spirits come undone
The prediction's rise

Those who slumber in the surface
Will capture all at night
Those who sleep when it's dark
Will be no more when it's in broad daylight

The prediction
The fall of angels
The dark explores
The gift of heaven
And learn to fly above
And learn to fly above

Spirits will decay
The prediction's rise
Spirits come undone
The prediction's rise

Destination chaos
Gates of hell defrost
Daylight is dawning
Bloodmoon is shining
War drums sounding
Death is rising

So it shall be written
So it shall be done

Spirits will decay
The prediction's rise
Spirits come undone
The prediction's rise
Spirits will decay
Prediction's rise
