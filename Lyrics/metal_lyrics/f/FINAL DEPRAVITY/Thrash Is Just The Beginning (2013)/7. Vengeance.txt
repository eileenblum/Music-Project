Invasion inside human beings
To teach fear and inflict a loss
Hate to chase, wrath to kill
Souls to take and lives to rape
At the outbreak of the crisis
We fight

Vengeance
A storm of death
No rest, no mercy, no matter what
We'll depart from life

Vengeance can mean only one thing
Circles core collapse
A reason to be frightened
When you're ready for death
Raging like a primate
Showing no regrets
Suppressing a desire
To set everything ablaze
Giving shit on anything
Will dig your own grave

We fight

Vengeance
A storm of death
No rest, no mercy, no matter what
We'll depart from life

While structures falling
Paper pusher keep talking
About irrelevances
And being narrow-minded

Invasion can mean only one thing
Vengeance
Circles core collapse

Vengeance
Vengeance is near
Rise and fall
We fall into deep
Endless fear

We fight
We fall
We fight
We fall into vengeance
