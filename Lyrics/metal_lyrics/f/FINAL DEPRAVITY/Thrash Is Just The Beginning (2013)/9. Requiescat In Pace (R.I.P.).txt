Requiem aeternam done ei, domine
Et lux perpetua luceat ei
Requiescat in pace

Amen to the world
May the sun fall
And darkness rise
Mayhem to mankind
It's an end that
Everyone can feel

Mors certa, hora incorta
Contra vim mortis non est
Medicamen in hortis

Amen to the world
Sun is falling
Darkness is rising
Mayhem to mankind
So it was written
And now it's done

Mortem ante portas
Requiescat in pace
Mortem ante portas
Requiescat in pace
