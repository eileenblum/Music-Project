To go insane like patients
With their canine madness
Handcuffs, straight jackets
And a bunch of pills
You call your home just white room
Number 6 in Sesame Street
The truth, dementia
And ludo in between
Dementia

Take pain pills, be alive
Pain pills to survive
Pain pills your drive
You've reached the bottom
And still you fall

He's got the key to your brain
Doctor for the insane
Symptoms in your mind
Psychoanalyze
Doctor for the insane
Help us from falling

Chromatic Circles
Before my face
Whispering voices
In my head

Take pain pills, be alive
Pain pills to survive
Pain pills your drive
You've reached the bottom
And still you fall
He's got the key to your brain
Doctor for the insane
Symptoms in your mind
Psychoanalyze
Doctor for the insane
Help us from falling

He's got the power, lay down the law
He decides on someone's woe
If he cares about what you feel
Don't trust him
Better trust in pills
Trust your pill
Trust your pill
