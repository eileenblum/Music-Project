Beside myself with rage
In me an attic of hate
Outbreak! Demonstrate!
What society did create
Stereotyped thinking
A bit some people do well
Long hair, black clothes
Hey, you are Matrix and Moses

There's something
That slumbers within everyone
A virus of hatred created by fear
You can feel it coming, upcoming in you
Blinded by rage, inner creature bursts

This is a tale of woe
About wrath and fear
Our tale of woe
About fear and endless wrath

You feel like you're standing alone
New surroundings, being with each other
Your loss, what will the future bring
To unearth the inner creature

There's something
That slumbers within everyone
A virus of hatred created by fear
You can feel it coming, upcoming in you
Blinded by rage, inner creature bursts

This is a tale of woe
About wrath and fear
Our tale of woe
About fear and endless wrath

Someday we'll show our rage
The conclusion will be self-destruction
If making falls into disgrace
You'll see the world ablaze

A virus of hatred
A virus of hatred
A virus of hatred
Tale of woe
