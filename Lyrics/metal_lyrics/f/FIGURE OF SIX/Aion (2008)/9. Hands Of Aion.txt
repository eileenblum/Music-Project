There is no evolution through stillness 
We'll receive our reward by the 
Hands of aion 
Stuck inside the closing circle 
Waiting for a ney beginning 

Circle is closing vow 
Watching beyond the horizon 
Made us blind 
Shields are broken 

Society, equality 
Are nothing but empty words 
Democracy, evolution 
Are meaningless 

Shields are broken now 
Revealing rhe scared beast 
Too weak to run away 
From the closing circle 

Day and nighr, birth and death 
We thoughy we were untouchable 
Feeling safe insinde our castles 
Society,equality 
Are nothing but empty words 
Democracy, evolution 
Are meaningless
