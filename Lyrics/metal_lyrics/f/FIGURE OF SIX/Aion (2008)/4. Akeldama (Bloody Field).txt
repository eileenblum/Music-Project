Remember when you could breath 
The air if you can 
Recall when the rain came down 
Came down on earth 
Remember when the wind brought 
peaceful sounds if you can 
Recall when the rain came down 
Came down on earth 

Remember when all this was real 
The time when this was not a dream 

Lying on this bloody field 
Where people fought in the name of truth 
We have seen the behinning 
We'll see the end 

Forget about the sky 
Which cried his stars if you can 
Forget about our roots 
Our roots burned by the fire 
Forget about the ashes 
Brought by the wind if you can 
Forget about our roots 
Our roots burned by the fire 

We'll see the end
