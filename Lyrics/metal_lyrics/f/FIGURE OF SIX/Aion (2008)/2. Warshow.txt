The city is burning tonight 
Withit the faults of humanity 
Bright lightd in the sky 
Darkening our dignity 
The city is burning tonight 
With it the souls of the enemies 
It is something i don't care about 
I'Il watch it on tv 

And we still in our living tooms... 

This is the last day 
And then just memories 
The past that should have taught us 
This is the last day 
And then just memories 
The past will be our future 

Tell me how you feel 
Watching it on tv 
This time they are killing you 

Tell me gow you feel 
Watching it on tv 
This time they are killing you 

The city is burning tonight 
With it the faults of humanity 
Bright light in the sky 
Darkening out dignity 
And we still sit in our living rooms 
Watching on tv 
The same things happening on the streets
