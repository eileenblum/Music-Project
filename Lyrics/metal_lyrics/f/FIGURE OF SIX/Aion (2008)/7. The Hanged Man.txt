Rules have been written
Turn your mind off, let the people
 who asked you the questions
Find the right answers
trust them obey and pray
This is the way they avoid you
from thinking, deserve the place they
kept you in this world

Laugh at the hanged man
He will laugh at you
He's watching the world upside down
The only way to see things clearly

The hanged man will find a rope for you.
