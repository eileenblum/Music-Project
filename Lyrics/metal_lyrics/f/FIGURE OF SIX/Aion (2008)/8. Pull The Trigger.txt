The beginning of a new day
Waking up won't relieve the pain
of a night spent having nightmares
Light is pouring salt on your wounds

Is it so bad to have so much time to waste?
Is it so bad to feel sad about nothing?
Is it so bad to have so much time to waste?
Is it so bad to feel sad about nothing?

Pull the trigger
And walk out the stage
This play is over for you

Pull the trigger
And walk the path away
You won't feel empty anymore

Pull the trigger

You're so weak, getting this done is the
best thing you can do
You're so weak, leaving this world is the
best thing you can do.
