I fought for the ones who betrayed me 
To see them slither like snakes 
I melted my wings for your faith 
You can look up but you won't see me 
The core is now my place to be 
The sky has lost its morning star 

Judge me, don't ask the reason why 
Don't try to understand 
The orter side of the story 
Judge me, don't ask the reason why 
Don't try to understand 
The other side of the story 

I'll be stuck here for eternity 
To prevent the world from feeling hate 
Between nothing and infinity 
The one who has sworn love has betrayed you, 
Now you can be afraid of me 
The sky has found its morning star 

The morning star shines again 
Is guiding us to the end
