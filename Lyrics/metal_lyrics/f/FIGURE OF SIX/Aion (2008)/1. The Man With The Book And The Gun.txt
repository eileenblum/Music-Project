A long time ago 
A man with the book in his hand 
Walked the earth, keading a blind men army 
He turned freedom into dust 
With the blood of people 
He wrote its words 
Nothing could stop them 
The army of the fools, a bloody cross
To make you observe their rules 
No one could stop them 
His truth could not be fake 
A lovely mask to hide the angry snake 

With them or against them 
This was their creed 
It's what we believe 
Abook and a gun 
Won't let you disagree on what they say 

A long time ago 
A man wiyh the book in his hand 
Walked the earth, leading a blind men army 
He made people trust his words 
As they opposed his truth he killed them all 
A book and a gun won't let you 
A book and a gun disagree on what they say 

No one could stop them 
The marching of the fools 
Just blood and dust left 
Ready to eat the sky 
Nothing could stop them 
The army of the fools 
Just blood and dust left 
Ready to eat the earth
