Life is only pain and happiness 
Don't you know? This is how it goes 
Day aftez day she fells so alone 
She thinks "this can't happen to me" 

You keep on trying 
I've built this cage for you 
You keep on trying 
Your're wasting your time 

You always break me down 
You always make me feel this way 
This time you'Il see a side of me 
That you don't know 
I'Il run away this time 
You'Il never ever see my face 
This time you'Il see a side of me 
You always break me doown 
You always make me feel this way 
This time you'Il see a side of me... 

The day you get what you want 
The worst dat of your life 

Life is only pain and loneliness 
Don't you know? This is how it goes 
Day after day she feels so alone 
She thinks "this can't happen to me 

Ten years alone
