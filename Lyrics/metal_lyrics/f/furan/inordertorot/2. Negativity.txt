A lost outlet
defined by otherâs promises
itâs a sinner who leads your way
Among deserted fields
gain the courage to follow through
end the world in cold blood
Deceit
Betrayal
Inflame my heart with tales
of rebels who fought well
they gave their lives and failed
Depict the horizon
left by the gloomy arrival
of thousands of mad men
a new age of denial
The skies are falling
no prophecy foresaw the enraging desire
of underrated power
Untrodden empires
endowments from the idols
Shift into beings of light
set your boundaries on fire
Bring your devices of torture
Put your own head in the deadliest one
I doubt that anyone will ever care
so give up faith
Retrain from coming back for a rematch
the gates are closed and thereâs no way back
so welcome to the endless pit of souls
find your own spot and leave me alone
A ghost threshold
exposed to you as valid truth
subjugation of self control
Amidst no manâs land
extermination of cynic fools
inhumane conclusion

[Repeat verse]

Look into the eyes of fortune
the evolving circle fades into the night
reincarnation found its last stage
so give up faith

allow your demons to take over you
what doesnât kill you makes you stronger too
until you realize itâs better
to stop demanding what you cannot have

[Repeat chorus]
