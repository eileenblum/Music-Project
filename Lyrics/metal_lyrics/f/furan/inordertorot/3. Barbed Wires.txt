I donât want you to rectify me
The truth lies far beyond menâs wit
Itâs dark so you wonât get to see your own creation; Extermination
Itâs boundless, fearless, viciousâ¦
and itâs coming for you right now
Whatchaâ gonnaâ do?
Watch your own back
then realize that itâs never going to stop
Limited expression
Signs of neglectful discipline
You gave them one reason
to give it up and die alone
This is as far as you can go
My fate is false and youâre not real
The maze Iâm trapped in will reveal
the truth to what Iâm doing here
so take it or leave it
I donât need you to reach my goals
You werenât there when I lost my war
So Iâm prepared to walk through barbed wires on my way out
Donât try to run away from me
I donât care this was meant to be
Iâll find you just to prove you wrong
You cannot defeat me
You treated me like a simple toy
Whatâs right for me is wrong for you
With a smile on my face I cut through barbed wires on my way out

[Repeat chorus]
