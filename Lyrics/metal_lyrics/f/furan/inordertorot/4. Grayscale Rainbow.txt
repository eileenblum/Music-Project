[feat. Jennifer Boldt]Oh, Itâs the weird kind of thrill
a burning desire that must fade away
Oh, I found my own way
(now go back to the start again)
Oh, Now that winter is near
Iâll glance at the past and smile again
Oh, Youâll fall into to this game
over again
And live life alone
all hope is gone
affliction grows
tears carve like acid
heartbeats pump coal
ground into dust
now the trialâs lost
Now again
sweet downfall prevails
let the anguish leave marks on the sink
and fight for breath
damn the thoughts of a new world
theyâre like a feather in the sky vanishing in rue
Cursed memories, timeless stains of ink,
childish misconceptions, dust in the wind,
hearts shaped clouds, blurry silhouettes,
faceless individual, foreign to the coldâ¦
Breeze from the north, pushing from above,
journey of the mindless, words left untold,
false promises, treasures thrown away,
wisdom cries that in the end it wasnâtâ¦

Perfectâ¦ Perfectâ¦
It wasnât perfect after all
Perfectâ¦
(Thereâs a shadow that flies away)
Perfectâ¦
(Iâm the flower that blooms again)
It wasnât perfect after all
(Our redemption will come after midnight)
Oh, Itâs the end of a tale
shattered to pieces that cut through the skin
Oh, It hurts to be sane
(the piercing rain strikes again)
So long my unrecognized friend
Iâll linger through shadows to make sure youâre there
in death you will take a glimpse of my face
itâs never too late
As young time goes on
Innocence falls
and letters burn
frozen flames melting
on ghostly roads
Iâll turn back the clock
for the sour fruit lost all its meaning
And again
the roads will not intersect
because these are brighter days
and times have changed
some belong to the cold
others should remain far beyond

[Repeat verse]
[Repeat chorus]
