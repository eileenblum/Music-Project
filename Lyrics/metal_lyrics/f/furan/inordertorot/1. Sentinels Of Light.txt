Shame, guilt, anger, wrath

To cure yourself
To prove them wrong
Itâs an endless battle
In an obscure void

Failure
Humiliation guaranteed
Dropping your tears on the graves of your fathers
Washing your hands from inevitable guilt

Sinners
Rewarded for committing crimes
Lifeâs overrated
Youâll die one thousand times
Reality is nothing but a lie

Sentinels of light
Show me the way to freedom
Iâm not here to stay
Sentinels of light
Take my hand
Together
Weâll fade away

Doubt, grief, panic, woe

Mischievous reasoning
Unknown by some
Enjoyed by many
But left ignored

[Repeat verse]
[Repeat chorus]
