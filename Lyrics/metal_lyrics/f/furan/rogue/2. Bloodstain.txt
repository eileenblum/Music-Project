Suffer for the pain you cause, laughing at the ones like you
Watch them bleed and feel nothing, âtill you find yourself bleeding too

Nothing feels right. Your eyes glaze to gray
Walking without restriction for you is like walking in a maze

Time to sit back and watch the world turn its back on you

Cry alone and see that no one cares
When they asked for mercy you weren't there
Youâre complaining that the world's not fair
The mirror inflictor of the wounds you bare

Your every single problem, you blame it all on me
But what you canât see, is your lack of humility

Leaving my pride behind is not an option for me
Your self-respect decays as youâre eaten alive by shame

The hallway stretches in an infinite loop, as you run on a floor covered in boiling blood

Cockroaches crawling between your flesh and skin, portray a premonition of your inevitable end
