Degenerate, just degenerate

Free your life
Another sad sentiment becoming a part of my body
There is no future
I melt away

The noise feels like a drill in my eardrums
Fuck your shit, donât even wannaâ to be here
To hell with you

Iâm not your friend
My prison grew wings
Iâm not your friend
The sky lights my way
Iâm not your friend
No, never was
Iâm not your friend
And never will be

Iâm not looking for appreciation
Decomposition has been rewarding enough

[Repeat verse]
[Repeat chorus]

Iâm not your friend
Iâm not your friend
Walk alone now
Hear the stars weep

Iâll always be with you
Iâll always stand by your side
I wonât leave you alone
So I make sure youâre hurt and hopeless and suffer in misery
âtil you die
