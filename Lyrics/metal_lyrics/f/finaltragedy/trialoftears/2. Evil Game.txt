And when her heart strays away
She blinks at the light of day
When the truth is too hard to face
She's ready to fall from grace
Where is the girl that I used to know ?
I can't feel the love anymore

You know, and I know
Nothing can tear us apart
Just one more try
Life is no game and I won't load the dice

No, I won't resign this time
So she pleads guilty to her crime
She indulges in lies that her tears confess
Her feelings she can't repress
Meaningless words just to ease the pain
I swear I won't hurt you again

You know, and I know
Nothing can tear us apart
Just one more try
Life is no game and I won't load the dice

Girl your sweet lullabies won't allay my suspicion
You try to hypnotize me but you can't blur my vision
He can give no answer to unspoken words
She knows he can't blame her for secrets unheard
I don't want your body, I just want your soul
I've sold mine to the devil and I need yours to fill the hole

When the night takes me in her arms
My spirit flies to the place where dream and day night
An empty room with burning candles
Moving shadows on white sheets
She feels the bite of the candlelight on her naked skin
I wanna share your heat
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me
I taste your lips in an endless kiss
A delicious mix of desire and fear

You know, and I know
Our world is falling apart
No more last try
See you in hell girl you're no longer mine
