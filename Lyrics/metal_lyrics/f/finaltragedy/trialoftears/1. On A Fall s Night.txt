Ooh let me dive in your eyes
Ooh let me dive in your eyes

Now I know, I can see it all so clear
Please don't go, 'cause baby I need you near

Lights on, bright, I'm hidden down in the shade
I hear your voice raise
Emotion, I can feel my body heat
Turned on by your beat

You give me thrills
I wish time would come to a standstill
You give a smile
How I wish you'd never say goodbye

Devotion, I'm standing out in the rain
Calling out your name
Ignition, take me to the promised land
Reaching out for hands

On a fall's night I fell as surely as a leaf off a tree
I didn't realize at once
I guess I was too blind to see
I woke up the next day
You had snatched my soul away
I had your sound still in my ears
Although your face had disappeared

You give me thrills
I wish time would come to a standstill
You give a smile
How I wish you'd never say goodbye

Alone you dance in the middle of nothingness
If I could ...
A solitary waltz, let's spin together
We'll go round and round and round ...

Ooh let me dive in your eyes
Ooh let me dive in your eyes

I have never learned to swim in shallow waters
Every time I plunge into your gaze I drown
