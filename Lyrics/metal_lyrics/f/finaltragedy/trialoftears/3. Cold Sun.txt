I stare into the night
Can't see no light, forever gone
Why was I so blind ?
Maybe the sun was much too strong

Now I'm on my own, my heart of stone comes back to life
Death opens my eyes to past mistakes
Too late to learn

So many nights I waste in cries
My tortured soul can't find no rest
On a bed of nails my body lies
Let me begin my quest

I'll wait, no matter how long it takes
Embrace, you know there's no time to waste

Alone you rise, fading away in the night
I heard the call so many miles away from you
I'd go back in time for one last goodbye

I remember when we used to dance
The games we used to play out in the snow
I know I won't get another chance to let my feelings show, oh no
Oh no

When the music died, I realized the words were wrong
Though I try to rephrase, the song remains the same
I wonder how long

So many nights I waste in cries
My tortured soul can't find no rest
On a bed of nails my body lies
Let me begin my quest

I'll wait, no matter how long it takes
Embrace, you know there's no time to waste
