Bad dreams keep telling me it's all in vain
They say I'm just training my love for pain
You would never give me the key to your heart
And this wait would only tear my soul apart

Night dawns, I rise
Still my wandering spirit stays down
Bathed in my own lies
Never said forever bound

Even if my will dries out
The rain will bring it back to life
One embrace, erase my doubts
Only your touch can clear my sky
Share the emptiness
The wind of dreams that create reality I caress

Try and see the light
Stop fighting love, don't close your eyes
I'll wait another day
I trust that time will find a way

Come, surf with the alien on top of a wave
Dive and in our hearts the sea of love will rave

Swim in the sea bed, in the morning reach the shore
Hide under the sails till your body asks for more

Times change, love remains
How could the wind blow out the flame ?
No way to escape
Don't leave me lost inside the maze

Try and see the light
Stop fighting love, don't close your eyes
I'll wait another day
I trust that time will find a way

Shh, no more words
