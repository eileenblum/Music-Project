Deep into the woods I go to get my
frustrations out
Silence rule, and the powers within...

No need for cat eyes in the woods
Let the threes speak, as the wind caresses
their leaves

No words has been spoken, but answers
has been given..
I have made up my mind

The voices from the woods
For me they come out
Am I insane or is it me?
It's the voices from the woods

The voices from the woods
For me they come out
Am I insane or is it me?
It's the voices from the woods

The wicked part now rule supreme!
I have made up my mind in this moist cold
kingdom
In which I lie
