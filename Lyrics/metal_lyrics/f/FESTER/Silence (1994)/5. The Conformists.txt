Listen!
I speak!
I am me!
That will do!
I reign!

Loneliness
Pleasure and pain
Under my skin

Listen!
I speak!
I am me!
That will do!
I reign!

Loneliness
Pleasure and pain
Under my skin

I won't let others rulle my life
I do what I want!

Why do I have to love only one?
You can say what is moral, what is life..
Deceving the crap!
You're the conformists

I won't let others rule my life
I do what I want!
