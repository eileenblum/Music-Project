The raven screams!!!

The Raven
and it's mournful screams, can be compared 
with me
- When the raven is screaming I am 
screaming

The raven
The symbol of all the worlds grief, mark of
chaos
- When the raven is silent, I am silent

It's seldom one doesn't have complaints..
One is silent
Silent like the raven never is..

It's here somewhere..
Like thoughts of the beginning of the end
Silent is the raven

It's here somewhere..
Like thoughts of the beginning of the end
Silent is the raven

I Don't bother I don't care!
Changes..
Silent as the raven never is

The raven
Like me, use to scream but now silent
Cause I don't bother I don't care

Silent is the raven
The end
