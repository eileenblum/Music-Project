Growing Thirst!

Deep inside there's a feeling like a river
towards falls..
Deep inside you're warm like blood through
ice...

Deep inside there's chaos like a never 
ending battle
Deep inside a "what?" like a thick, vomiting
question mark

Growing thirst

Deep inside a lust
A denied lust that screams for attention

Deep inside you hope
Hope to get what you want

Deep inside there's a feeling like a river
towards falls..
Deep inside you're warm like blood through
ice...

It's the growing thirst that makes you
scream and scratch you hand and...

Like I said:

It's the growing thirst that makes you scratch 
you hand..

Like I said:

It's the growing thirst that makes you scratch 
you hand..
