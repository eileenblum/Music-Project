Life on earth - A hate
Life on earth - A hate

Life on earth - A hate, a lie, a natural cause
of death..
Time .. Time will tell,
But there's not an hour long enough

Life on earth - A hate
Life isn't always to late

FRUSTRATIONS' all I feel
My mind has turned, and my feelings are
like strange waves

FRUSTRATIONS!

Frustrations caused by hate
Frustrations caused by lies
'cause only I know, only I know the truth
Frustrations caused by hate
Frustrations caused by lies

You have never done like me!
You have never thought like me!
You turn your frustrations to joy,
You can't see that I can't

I have to get my frustrations out
You say do I ?!
I have to get my frustrations out
You say do I ?!

Life on earth - A hate
Life on earth - A hate

Life on earth - A hate, a lie, a natural cause
of death..
Time .. Time will tell,
But there's not an hour long enough

Die
