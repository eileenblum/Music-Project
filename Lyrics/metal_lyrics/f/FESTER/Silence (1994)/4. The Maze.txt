Cold
You're freezing
It's cold
Your will to live never shows

Your grin is pathetic

The shadows are climbing on the massive
green walls (in the labyrinth)
I do you like you did to me
I do you like you did to me
I do you ....like you did ....to me

In the maze you will pay
The circle is shut
In the maze you will pay
I got my revenge, right or wrong
You paid in the maze !!

Never, ever again
Never ever
Will you come to me

I will visit you
Ever, ever again, ever ever

Your biggest fault was to underestimate me.
