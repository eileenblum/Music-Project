Jeg skulle onske jeg ikke hadde folelser
Jeg skulle onske at jeg var meg og meg for
deg

Sa sorgelig, og plutselig gyldig:
"Vart" , for din dod

Jeg skulle onske du forsto meg mens du var,
Og at ikke jeg hadde hat som aldri far utspill

Nar noen dor ja..
Aldri mer..
Forbanna leit, men bra.
Hvorfor?

Fikk aldri vaere meg som meg,
Men ville gjore det bra

Jeg skulle onske jeg ikke hadde folelser nar
noen dor

[English translation:]

When Someone Dies

I wish I had no emotions
I wish I was me for me and not me for you
so sorrowful and suddenly so real
us before you died
I wish that you could've understood me
while you still were,
and that I didn't have hatred that never, never will come out
when someone dies, the end,
damn sad, but also good, why ?

could never be me like me,
but wanted to do good,
I wish I had no emotions
when someone dies...
