I will rise from ashes, rise from my grave
I will hunt you down and put you to an early grave

I'll hunt you down..
I'll hunt you down..

I'll make your nightmares come true
I'll make you wish that you were dead...

I'll hunt you down..
I'll hunt you down..

I will come into your room at night
I will make you feel the sence of fright
I will make you wish you were dead

I will blow the wind of death into your room at night
I will make noise, so you'll never find peace..
You will be a wreck. and I love it !
Feel the fright !!

You'll be crawling and begging to be put to sleep..
The only sleep I will allow you to have.
Is the one where
you wish you were awake

Your heart is pounding!
Your sweat is pouring!
And you ... You wake up screaming!

I'll hunt you down..
I'll hunt you down..

Your will to live will end
Long before I'm finished..
Your grim when you die : despair and fright

I'll hunt you down like this every night!
I will hunt you down
