Praising One Of The Twelve..
One of the "Dii Consentes"

A part of the Aventine Triad
Essentional in our funeral Rites

Standing on Aventine hill
Gathered to fulfill the rite..
Standing on Aventine hill
Performing the Rites of Ceres

Rites of Ceres
Rites of Ceres

In opposition to the ruling elite.
We kept sacred to honour her right

We are "Plepians" - self conscious men

May our crops grow great,
So we can feed our children, and fight our wars!

Rites of Ceres

May we love our loved ones.
So that others can die!

In the end, when life is lived
And only death is real;

We chant for you - Ceres!
