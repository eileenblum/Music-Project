I walk the 1000 steps with pride
My brothers has been given the same (honourful) gestures
for the 1000th time

The Black Tower
In the The Black Tower
The Black Tower

Scattered by weaping angels
The lambs are silent, as for a long time..
My black heart beats!

I have tied up the victim for the 100th time
Infernal screams riccochette the walls like a hammerpond.

The Black Tower
In the The Black Tower
The Black Tower

A pounding heart bleeds out in my hand
as 1000 times before
If darkness had a name, it's name would be mine..
You end your life in the Black tower

In the Black tower
The banner hangs high!
The heaven is darker than black.
as gratitude for my sacrifice !!

The Black Tower
A life given for my darkness.
in the Black Tower

I move down the 1000 steps in trance
My hell is one step nearer
A 1000 steps down a 1000 stairs
Down on the ground I fall on my knees and awaits the next...
In the black tower
