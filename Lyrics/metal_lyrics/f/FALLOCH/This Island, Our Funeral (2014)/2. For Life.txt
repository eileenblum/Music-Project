Standing on open ground
Where we call forth
A silent heir, a wasted prayer
Now that our calls echo across the night, in this fragile state
We've waited for too long

Holding torches over broken land
Hoping that we will find you 
Close by the sea
Where ships will call us home
And the tides carry our hope

Away from the shore, into this body
