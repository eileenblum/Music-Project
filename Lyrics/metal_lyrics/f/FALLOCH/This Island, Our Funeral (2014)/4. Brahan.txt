[These are the words printed in the booklet for this song, but they are not the actual lyrics.]Around the room a figure moves
Pausing at each bed and gazing intently
Conjuring and casting, peg and mallet in hand
Left on their foreheads is a mark of the hag

To drink from the well three drops must spill
Bound to the tree a string of lace and silk
Cross yourself and appease
Call forth the sea and let it fall

A dh-fhagas am Blar-dubh na thasach
'Dortadh fuil le iomadh sgian;
A's olaidh am fitheach a thri saitheachd 
De dh-fhuil nan Gaidheal, bho clach nam Fionn

Foolish pride without sense will put in place
The seed of the deer with the seed of the goat
White rooks out of the wood
The cunning dog will swallow the land

Burning skin, fire and tar
