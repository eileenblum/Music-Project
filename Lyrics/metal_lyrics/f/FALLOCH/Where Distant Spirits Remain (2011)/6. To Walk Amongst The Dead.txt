The stars fall asleep behind a tired sun
Memories from another world grasp my dying spirit
I see the faint glimmer of your face
Take my hand
Let me travel with you through twilight once again

In my slumber I still hear your distant cries
A cascade of embers fall from your weary eyes
Your glow still brings me warmth and hope
If you listen carefully
You can hear the quiet sound of a better world

I am the dead
And the dead walk alone
