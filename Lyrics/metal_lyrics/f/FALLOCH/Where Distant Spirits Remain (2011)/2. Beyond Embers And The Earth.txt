As I walk amongst these stones
Underneath the frozen sun
Shadows consume all of my hope
It's where I belong
As tears drop like falling snow
I wander into the unknown
Following the voice of the breeze
Cold and alone

Your soul is as deep as the sea
When you reach to the depths you'll be free
Close your eyes drift away silently
When reflections turn into deceit
And the carvings seem blurred and too bleak
Close your eyes  
Drift away  

My ghost is still wandering
Through the overgrown memories
I've trapped myself in
I'll follow the voice of the breeze
Down this old and empty path
Where distant spirits remain
