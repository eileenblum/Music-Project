In our hearts a flame was born
We felt its sacred warmth
It seemed like we had drifted outside life
And the longer that it stayed
We couldn't even tell
Our visions had become a diluted dream

If our souls could collide
And realign the shape of this realm
Would we erupt into life?
If our souls could stay awake
Would we still be lost in emptiness?

When the haze had finally gone
Serene skies haunted dawn
It seemed like we had drifted inside life
When you disappear into the stars
I'll follow you  
Where our dreams will last for eternity
