When I fade away
My sorrow will pierce the earth
Like a wound inflicted upon these roots
I'm a ghost
Searching for a truth I may never find

When I arise from this grave
The light will be my solace
I will scatter old ashes across this isolated land
Where memories are lost

I break free from these chains
But I still walk this world alone
I've painted the sunset my own shade of red
Will I ever feel its warmth again
