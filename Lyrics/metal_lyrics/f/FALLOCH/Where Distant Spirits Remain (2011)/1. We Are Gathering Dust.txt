Breathe in silence
We won't pray
Time can't heal us
We will wither and decay
When the sullen voices cry
Dust will settle
We're an echo of a past some deny

If your vision of truth
Is dressed up as a lie
Then what is the point of living and dying
Look outside these dark walls
And discover the light
That which is hidden beneath sorrow and scars

When the ocean takes us in
It will swallow the bitterness from within
When we're drowning
And losing hope
Fragile moments
Will save us from all of our sins
