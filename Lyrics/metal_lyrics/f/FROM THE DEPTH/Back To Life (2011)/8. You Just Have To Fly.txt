[Music: C. Battini, D. Castro, lyrics: C. Battini]

I don't need my eyes
To see everything; I want to close them
Try to dream again

I feel all the wonder around me
That is not what I want, is not here
Looking everywhere

I will soon be free
I don't want limits, I don't want chains
I will have no cage

Another world is born
I'll live it all and will be my creation
No one can stop me!

The faith lives inside your soul
The pain never let you alone
But you can avoid it
Have to try

Follow me over the sky
Where the darkness can't swallow your light
Open your wings.
Have to fly!

You won't look for answers or questions,
Now in this moment you just have to fly!
We'll save the future,
Mirror don't show you the truth for the lifetime
And everything comes back... Come back!
