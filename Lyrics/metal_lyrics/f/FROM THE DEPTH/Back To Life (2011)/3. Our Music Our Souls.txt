[Music: A. Karabelas, N. Solzi, R. Albanese, lyrics: A. Karabelas]

Sorrow, I don't need it now
I've got to face it and I do it loud!
Every moment at night I can see,
All the faces that scream to me!

Listen (to) my words, I'm not a liar,
My dreams are my truth.
For every man,
There is always a chance, to prove what I can do

Cause in a nameless world,
I just want to tell that I was born to keep a soul, made of will
From the depth!

You must watch us in the eyes,
All we want it's not hard to find
And we are not like you
That have an easy point of view
See the light that burns in our eyes,
And deep in our souls,
Cause our songs is now our life
And it's not the same for you

Cause in a nameless world,
I just want to tell that I was born to keep a soul made of will
From the depth!
