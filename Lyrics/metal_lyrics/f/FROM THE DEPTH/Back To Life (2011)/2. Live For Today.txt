[Music and lyrics: R. Albanese]

I look in the mirror and I am no longer the same
What have I done to feel this pain?
I've lived to the top and I burned the candle faster than all, faster than everything
Is this a nightmare? I want to wake up now and live again

I look in the mirror and I'm sure I understand
The time to change is forever forget
The life of the candle is near to see all his end, near to his end
I stop my life to recall what I've been for the last time

It's not in your brain
It's not a game
Your life screams your name!

Live for today, my son,
I gave you the life and you must not waste it crying for the past!
What you have lived is not coming back!
Run, run don't stop and leave all your shadows behind

Live for today, my son,
I gave you the life and you must not waste it crying for the past!
What you have lived is not coming back!
Run, run don't stop and leave all your shadows behind!
Remember my words, remember my love and I will live forever with you
