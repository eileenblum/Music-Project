[Music: A. Cattani, lyrics: A. Karabelas]

Bleeding your eyes for what you have seen
Maybe the sorrow arrives,
Now you should feel all your thoughts that runs out,
Sometimes you fall on the ground

Trying to steal, what you built in your journey
You must react, wash all your tears now!
Madness they call, what you made for survive,
They ignore all your life
Fight in your truth and don't be scared
You keep holding the flame

Fight and forget
All this kindness you've learned
You must react,
Scream to the breathless!

Fire: burn, winds are blowing
Choose your way!
Try to change what you have done, follow this way and be proud
Find the will to be the flame!

Now all your actions belong to the past
There is no reason to think, all you have lost is gone far away
Present knock at your door!

Fight and forget
All this kindness you've learned
You must react
Scream to the breathless!

Fire: burn, winds are blowing
Choose your way!
Try to change what you have done, follow this way and be proud
Find the will to be the flame!
