[Music: D. Castro, A. Cattani, A. Karabelas, R. Albanese, lyrics: A. Karabelas]

Hunting through oceans for something to find
Glory and treasures, I don't want to die
Lost in the dark I can't see the light
Truly forgiveness except for the blind

See...
I just want to open my eyes

Moving to coast to search for the grain
A grain of sun to slay the night
Outcast in life I've always been
And I feel like a blind that can't see

I...
I am turning back to life

Straight to the source I must go on with this try,
That I have choose with my soul I will not
Crawl back to you. Never!

Challenge the shadows that stand in the woods
Going to travels that brings solitude
Living in nature and fight for this source
I see all this men I watch in my hand

Hand, it gives me the strenght for this... straight to the source!

Straight to the source I must go on with this try,
That I have choose with my soul I will not
Crawl back to you. Never!
