[Music: A. Karabelas, D. Castro, A. Cattani, R. Albanese, lyrics: A. Karabelas, R. Albanese]

Again we are here, and we never forget, the words of the humans around me,
Never forget their truth above all, never forget everything I want

Open you heart and begin a new life... alone
Life is too short to make it fade away... where is your soul?
Changing your path, have you seen all this lies?... Again
You will find feelings that you should know

Cry every day, now I realize I've broke
All my integrity with everything I had!
Truth is I don't care, how long I've to fight,
Only one man can tell me who I am: it's me.

I hear all your voices, I search between them, I grab all the good from your reasons,
It's time to stop thinking, it's time to begin,
It's time to walk through my own way

Open you heart and begin a new life... alone
Life is too short to make it fade away... where is your soul?
Changing your path, have you seen all this lies?... Again
You will find feelings that you should know

Cry every day, now I realize I've broke
All my integrity with everything I had!
Truth is I don't care,how long I've to fight,
Only one man can tell me who I am: it's me!
