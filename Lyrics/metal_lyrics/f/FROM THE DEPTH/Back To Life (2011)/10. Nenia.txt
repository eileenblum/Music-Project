[Music: D. Castro, lyrics: A.Karabelas]

You walk near to me,
You scream what you tell, (I) believe in your voice,
Only sins rule your life, are you blind?
The beast that you hide,
Illusion for eyes,
Brings to your life
Joy that you need

Forever lost
In your pride

Friend, you must know
That those are like sand
No way for their souls
They're all condamned to die!
Without God in their lies
With no light

This journey of pain maybe is gone,
The time has come,
For me to go to my road,
I'm alone...

The light that shines, in my sky,
Can save all my hopes, dreams, and the truth
This thruth that I hold to go on this quest

Cry! But now it's late!
No time to tell!
No time to hide!

What you have done, is written here
In the book of life
No hope, no mercy for them

Only darkness for you...
