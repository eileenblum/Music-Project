[Music: D. Castro, R. Albanese, lyrics: A. Karabelas]

Crash in my life, it doesn't depends on me
But I am sure that never again, never again

To this old day I can still recall, all his words
That spreading the truth, learning the life

Nothing to you, nothing to me
Brings all the storm I need, cause I'm sure to see
Suggest to you, suggest to me
How, how this all begins
Craps and lies in vain
Tells, nothing to you

Changes to breath (it) doesn't depends on you,
Terror and doubts you're never alone,
Never alone

Don't waste your time, you can't always run,
Make them change, your way always run, where is your breath?

Nothing to you, nothing to me
Brings all the storm I need, cause I'm sure to see
Suggest to you, suggest to me
How, how this all begins
Craps and lies in vain
Tells, nothing to you
