[Music: D. Castro, R. Albanese, A. Karabelas, lyrics: A. Karabelas]

Living without regrets, is what I want from my life.
Giving a punch to the wall, is what she left me inside.

Waching the fog being more
Growing like in my heart, scene of a glory lost forever behind
She doesn't tell me the truth, another man was in her life
Stealing a part of my soul

Now I'm alone, thinking for what I should fight
Maybe the only thing was to write

Words from my heart, real experience of life
Now I'm sure I learned to live my life this time

Dropped in my mind, I will find my way
I never forget that the pain stands there
Burning my soul
In the shade, I can't excape, I just remember the day,
Lost away
After this defeat I'll wake up stronger, learning that problems are made to be solved
I can see this spring growing like, in my heart, part of a future indestructible

And now I'll find the will to procede and to face the challenge of the world maybe one day
I'll understand it more so now I have to live for my passions

Dropped in my mind, I will find my way
I never forget that the pain stands there
Burning my soul
In the shade, I can't excape, I just remember the day,
Lost away...
