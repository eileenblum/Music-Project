After 100 years of war
By the hammer and the sword
World falls down into disgrace
To run away from pain there is no way

We lost men and families
We can hear only scared screams
My clan suffers for cowardy
By honouring ancients we'll resist

The druid begins his rite
As the fire of bonfire goes on
I lost myself
I can see a world that I've never seen

In the magic ring we meet
They speak to me from the other side
I hear the breath of the infinity
Their girl give us invincibility

Father and son
Togheter again
To remember the days gone
In their land
Pain and fear are gone
Through the gates of time

Now I understand I'm not alone
Your goodwill give us welfare
I found myself into the lights
We'll help ourselves into these fights

And from the ashes and from the flames
The Souls of ancients show me the way
I hear their voice coming to me
We are honouring you great ancients

Father and son
Togheter again
To remember the days gone
In their land
Pain and fear are gone
Through the gates of time
