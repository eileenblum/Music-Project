Once my land was green and was strong,
Now we can't see our future no more,
Where the signs of the gods let the way
Now we are drifting away...

Once there stood our pround kinsmen
Strangers now are invading the land
Strangers now are already here
Want us to disappear

But now we are getting strong
We're coming back again
Coming back to conquer our land

Fight for our land
Fight even though death is at hand
Fight for our rivers and trees
They shall be ours for evermore

Sunrise it will be
When we come, when we come again
And the enemy will be gone, forevermore
Sunrise it will be
When the gods return again
Driving the enemy far away, forevermore

Now the enemy found death or has gone
The beliefs of the one god that destroyed the land
Never shall they return

Fight for our land
Fight even though death is at hand
Fight for our rivers and trees
They shall be ours for evermore
