Ravenson the battle field...
Just dark shadows in the dawn's light
Today many sword are going to be broken
The armies are ready to fight...

The grass is green
The trees are watching
Waiting to tell the story of the battle

Blue Faces, coils on their bodies
Romans' terror is here!
Nor armour, nor fear
Just torque, sword and faith!

Cathubodva
Ravens on the battle field
The girl in the black dress
Running in the battle!
Cathubodva

There's a land on fire
Full of fury and fear
Remains one last desire
To see this Land still free

Flags, on the battle field!
The wind seems to let your people's soul fly
The ladies in armour
Are riding their horses down the hill

10.000 bodies!
Are lying in the mud.
Blood mixes to Earth today
And fire will give its name to this field!

Cathubodva
Ravens on the battle field
The girl in the black dress
Running in the battle!
