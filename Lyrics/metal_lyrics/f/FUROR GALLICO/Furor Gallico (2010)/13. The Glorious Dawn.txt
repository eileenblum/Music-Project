The stars have showed me in the tides of time
Countless battles and brave warriors meeting theri fate
Wisdom of druids my people ask to me
The stars and the oak will show me our fate

A great warrior will come
To reunite all the gallic tribes
Victory for Brennon shall be
But mist is closing fast

Will this be the last battle?
Nevermore a roman land
Shall we disappear in the mist of time
And await for a new dawn?

We are not walking to the end of time
Time will come for our glorious dawn
