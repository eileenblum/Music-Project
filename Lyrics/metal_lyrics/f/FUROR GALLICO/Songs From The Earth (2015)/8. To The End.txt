Approaching the ultimate war
Between Eriu and human race
Time has run out
Choose your side

Have we forgot our roots?
Has the world abandoned us?
I will fight forever
To keep them alive

Are we destroying our land?
Consuming everything
A war that can't be won
An endless circle of mistakes

Hold back, remember
Try to find yourself
A war that can't be won
Everything we've done is here to see

Once I gave ou all my heart
But my soul you've torn apart
Listen to the scream inside
This is the voice of the Earth

It may be too late
When you'll finally understand
Through the ethereal mists of time
You are getting closer to the end
