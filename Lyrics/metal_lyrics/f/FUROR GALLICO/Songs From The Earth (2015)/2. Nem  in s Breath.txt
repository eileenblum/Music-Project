The mist is rising in the early morning
the three goddesses of the underworld
screaming upon us
surrounded by brothers
clung to my bagpipe
pride 's the only way to fight fear.

I am blowing drones breathing the bagpipe,
under my arm I called it breath of wisdom,
silence is broken and the shaking ground,
marching through the sound of infinity.
Blinded by poisons fury, is her action,
Nemain is rising in the sky.
Crying out loud her inhuman satisfaction
soaring over through dead bodies
I'm howling a dark anthem
bringing brothers to a clash
I'm bringing glory to my clan.
Restless, I'm blinded in oblivion,
twisted visions of an astral combination,
for my thirst of blood, is insatiable,
for the world as we know it is scattering.

I am blowing drones breathing the bagpipe,
under my arm I called it breath of wisdom,
silence is broken and the shaking ground,
marching through the sound of infinity.
Measuring the courage of whoever is dying,
my immortal soul feels the bites of the incoming winter,
as my eyes were the mirrors of the elder gods,
now reflecting impalpable desperation.
Blinded by poisons fury, is her action,
Neman is rising in the sky.
