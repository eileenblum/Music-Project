Majestic oak eternal light,
golden leaves that touch the skies,
roots as deep as the memory
of the earth.
You have seen men and soldiers,
passing under your shade.
Ages and blood, fire and ice,
but still you stand

Forever, breathing, the song of the earth,
wisdom in your shade I breathe.

As I lay amidst your leaves
my soul drifts away
to a timeless realm and space
primordial sense of life.

I am part of the whole,
and the whole I will return,
in every living thing I breathe,
singing the song of the earth.

Forever, breathing, the song of the earth,
Wisdom, in your shade I breathe.
