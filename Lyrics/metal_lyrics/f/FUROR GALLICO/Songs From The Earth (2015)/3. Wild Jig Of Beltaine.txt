Dancing to a fairy tune,
it will mesmerize you alive,
as you've never been before.
New life awaits, for those who join,
the wild jig of Beltaine.

Dancing, dancing round and round,
while golden leaves cover the ground,
we dance with the spirits,
and learn from their melodies.

Spinning round, you will fall,
in the timeless spiral we dwell.

Dancing to a fairy tune,
it will mesmerize you alive,
as you've never been before.
New life awaits, for those who join,
the wild jig of Beltaine.

We dance with the gods of the forest
No rest, no rest!
The ghost of time, soon will hide,
just leave all your worries behind.

Spinning round, you will fall,
in the timeless spiral we dwell.

Glimpse the world, that awaits from beyond,
and hear the voice of the fairies,
from us you will learn,
the songs of the earth,
forever endless inspiration.
