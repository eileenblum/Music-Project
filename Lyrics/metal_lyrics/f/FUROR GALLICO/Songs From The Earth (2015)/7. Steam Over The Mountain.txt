Cursed with eternal life
We breed life among the oaks
Guardians of both old and new
Silently we lurk

Yet another realm is gone
We disappear like shadows

And with us the ancestral life
Of our home the Forest

In waves of destruction
They pollute the Earth
Coming from beyond the Mountain
Headed to our sacred meadow

Steaming engines, heavy smoke
Earthquakes and water floods
And still they ask the reason why
Nature repels them

Is this a clash of Gods?
Or it's just insanity?

It's the hand that tears the veil
The hand of humanity

Steam over the mountain
As foreseen the end is coming
Vicious vapors under the oak shades
Still we fight for life

No sympathy nor empathy
With the entities of the Forest
The Lords of Steam reveal their dream:
A land made of Steel

So nature finally awakes
And reveals herself in glory
A barefoot dancer of the Forest
Dreadful and naked

Is this a clash of Gods?
Or it's just insanity?

It's the hand that tears the veil
The hand of humanity

Steam over the mountain
As foreseen the end is coming
Vicious vapors under the oak shades
Still we fight for life

"You have released your demons shaping a new world
Are thou alchemists or fools?
Yet I do not know
Curse you all for what have you done the Earth shall devour you"

And as she speaks the soil divides swallowing their monstrosity
