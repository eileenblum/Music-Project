Caught within this hysteria
Figures in mourning alive
Feeling the presence of a
Distant void
Agony and insanity, you wish
To rise

The uneasiness of the
Nocturnal wake
In the dark-the dismal
Sounds never die
Shadows of doom-there comes
The mourners cry
Heritage of wickedness-deny
Their pityful cry

Restrained of the truth
No need for the unreal
Follow me throught
My sadistic journey

"Time is the essence of fear,
Fear is the time itself"

Summoning the prophets of fear
The shadows cast your doom
Rising in the darkest of
Deceptions,
Dementia summons a cry to you
