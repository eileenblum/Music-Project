Abusive visions
Plague the subconscious
Mind
Reocurring catastrophe,
Reality not eminent

Seclusive mind religions
Trapping repulsive thoughts
Ripping valleys of fear,
Feeling distraught

Tearing at the skull
The visions burn throught
And rip
Convolutions of grey matter,
Ooze over sanity

Cry, rage in torment
Refuse to subside
Possesses my thoughts
In anguish I lie

Tearing at the skull
The visions burn throught
And rip
Convolutions of grey matter,
Ooze over sanity

Cry, rage in torment
Refuse to subside
Possesses my thoughts
In anguish I die....
