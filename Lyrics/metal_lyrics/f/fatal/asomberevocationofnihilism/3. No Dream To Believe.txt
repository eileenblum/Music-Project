On the urge of a dream
In an unknown sleep,
A mindless wanderer,
No decision in slumber deep.

Black figures in mourning,
Tears of blood portray life,
Awakened in death,
Watch the spirit rise.

Cold wind, ill depriving
Twist deception, uncompromising
Find within your mind,
Not within your heart
Unpreventing horror or a struggle
Too late

Now is the time to begin your
Journey
Memory display; future, past,
Present

Remember now
No escape for the weak mind
Only the strong
Are the special treated thoughts

Voices of the demanding
Call your mind
Wakening to escape
Vital signs of mystery

Scanning eyes-when the circle breaks
Back to sleep-no dream to believe
