From the pristine emerald seas of autumn sorrows
The giver of life weaves desolate tomorrows
We revere a kindred bond still bleeding
The histories of the hopeful
The ever-last, yet distant paths toward rapture,
A refuge from the baleful

[Chorus]
Sons of Charon - Thou art my kindred veil
Sons of Charon - Journeying beyond the rivers of death
Sons of Charon - Into the thresholds of the unseen
Sons of Charon - Thou art my kindred veil

Fragile petals, fragmented selves,
Deflowered by the gathering of unlight
A cacophony of wonderous lust meandering
In the blazing fires of darkness

Raven dusk wings cast their shadows
All over the triviality of being
An eventide dissolving the emptiness of a haunting consciousness
The fragrant beauty of the unknown
Still kindles the rancour of our rage
Forever brethren in supplication, thee we shall mourn

[Chorus]
Sons of Charon - Thou art my kindred veil
Sons of Charon - Journeying beyond the rivers of death
Sons of Charon - Into the thresholds of the unseen
Sons of Charon - Thou art my kindred veil
