Where has the fire of hope gone?
Why has the wisdom been forlorn?
Visionaries write their destiny
And ridicule their true belief

Let sacred angels fall again
Swear truce to doctrines that prevail
We hold the sceptre of your doom
On darkened skies crows still reigns

[Chorus]
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem

Deserted wastelands breed damnation's souls
Awakened from a deep complacent sleep
Eager the reanimate a kindred lost
And from their futile sacrilege
They have been redeemed

[Chorus]
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem
Seize the day...Carpe Diem

Where has the fire of hope gone?
Why has the wisdom been forlorn?
Seize the day...
Carpe Diem...
