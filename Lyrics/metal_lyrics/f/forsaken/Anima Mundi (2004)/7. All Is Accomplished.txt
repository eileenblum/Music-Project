A blackened darkness falls into the bliss of our heart
The bells of death shall toll, a caress of dolefulness stills our mind
Endlessly we shed our tears usurping a prophetic fate
With frailty we abscond our fears,
A never healing wound that plagues...plagues
Human existence shall vanish, corpses, the vision to see
The virtues of sanctity will perish, time for judgement day shall be
One fatal sign as the scriptures say
That in every unblemished land
Graveyards shall breed by misfortunes and
The dead shall follow that claim

[Chorus]
All is accomplished, everything is gone
When all is accomplished
The seeds of happiness are lost
Redeemed into madness, must innocence be guilty too?
A shroud stained with evil, woven by the hand of doom

Their souls plead for sanctuary, closed for years in this mortuary
Their cry turns to damnation, relentless is their frustration
Exiled from the final seal, in glory where the saved heal
In pandemonium the evil shall grieve, the torture will never cease
Think of the ones who have lost their sould, no testimony
Have no pity for my sinful woe, for I'm the one to be
Exempted from eternal life, forged in heresy
The depths of distress are shackled by the throes of misery

This is the end...
