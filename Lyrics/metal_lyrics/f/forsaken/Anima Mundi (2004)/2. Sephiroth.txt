These incensed eyes shall tell the eve
Of an unrepenting apocraphy
Parching my thirst in an enchanted wishing well
Veils of an unshed tear dissolved in chronicles of surreality
An insatiable swarm of fears they infinitely foretell

[Chorus]
Misery, my lustful concubine
She bleeds with profusion
Embodiment of a fallen deity's fears
Condemned to spiritual erosion

Runic sands of a soliloquy's hourglass
Conjure charms of the wise man's mantra
As I surge through the eyes of nefarious desires
The aegis of mortality melts in the frozen tundra

[Chorus]
Misery, my lustful concubine
She bleeds with profusion
Sanctuary for my wounds sublime
Born unto an altered state of ethereal seclusion

This oneness immemorial heals my rupture
In the triad of opposites I meet my sepulchre
Sephiroth, daughter of the vampire sun
I am one with the foregone leviathan
I am forsaken
