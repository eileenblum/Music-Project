Dews of serenity, sleep through plains of tranquility
Umbras engraved, in an embryonic stare
Rhymes of innocent melody wail in a silent harmony
Immersed all alone in the despondent air

A velvet lush stains this prosaic imagery
Candles of passion that kindle with delight
Erotic reminiscent sweat with fragrant obscurity
The scent of lust procreates a mystic rite

All love is lost, a forlorn ending
Predicaments betray the prophetic seers
Condescation of fate, a mirror of disparity
Valleys of sadness flood in Winter Tears

Legacies foretold to persist beyond mortality
Predicaments betray the prophetic seers
Portals of disgrace enshrined with ambiguity
Valleys of sadness flood in Winter Tears

Gazing through the shadows of this past life
Resting our shoulders on pillars of a fraternal hive
For this everlasting bond we shall cherish
In the wonders of winter's beauty we will perish.
