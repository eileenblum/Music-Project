I have lived the illusion of wisdom and tasted the joys of love
I have sailed seas of hedonism and travelled the path of mystic rites
Ride with me and learn the songs of the nameless Shaman
An Aenead through the dawn of the golden sun

[chorus:]
A celebration of existence,
The guiding light,
Vertigoes of tomorrow,
Embrace the molten night.
Drink the sweet splendour
The wine of youth
Vertigoes of yesterday
Lie to the truth

Saddened by tides of the sanctified pain
I lick the wounds of my crucified past
Shed the skin of your forgotten self
Join me, worship, the verbose deity

Repeat chorus.

Rubicons of rage holler inside me
Shades of grey laughter kiss the tears of my eyes
Stone faces in unseen places, whisper desert chants
On the serpent's wing I write songs of desire

Brazen fires quiescent in silence [x2]

The wombs of remembrance wither in flames
Moons of sorrow eclipsed by moments of mirth
Swallowed in darkness, clouded by the cleansing opiate
I feel the wonder, the maze of happiness

Brazen fires quiescent in silence [x2]

As I fly through the cavalcades of null emotion
Beneath this dream lies the emptiness of reality

[solo:Dan]

As I fly through the cavalcades of null emotion
Beneath this dream lies the emptiness of reality
