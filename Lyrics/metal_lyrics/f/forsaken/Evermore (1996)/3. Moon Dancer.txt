I walked across the timeless seas
I lie beside my lover's knees
Yet a hundred thousand words remain unspoken

You weave the secrets of the spider's web
I stare at the petals of the tears you shed
Must we share this hollowness, that remains unbroken?

I have felt the pains of this karmic wheel
In your desires,my hopes, you steal
In distant twilights, your touch, still I feel

Eternally I await your embrace
Hope is the sinner's fate
Everlasting, empty, alone

Moon Dancer take my hand
Let's count the grains of a thousand sands
Moon Dancer let's ride over the river bend
Moon Dancer glow in your beauty
Mourn the days of this dying soliloquy
Moon Dancer let's sing
The rites of the aquarian spring

Dance for me

Shall I ever lustre spectres of this radiant beauty?
To sleep in shadows that caress a solstice of passion
This is the paradise of the morning's enchantment
Where the tears in your eyes melt and the dawn asks for my hand

Taste the sweetness of my palm
It speaks the stories of a stolen charm
Believe what is forgiven
Eat the fruit which is forbidden

[solo:Sean,Dan]

Wear this mantel of satin gold
Dream those dreams that you can forever hold
Yet a hundred thousand words remain unspoken forever.
