The winter's rage howls vanity's dirge
Gravestone laurels whisper words of our nature's purge
Idle hopes of immortality
Broken by frigid arteries of senility

Now listen

A merciless greed vows to reach further
Psychotic hymns murmur secrets of inanimate rapture
In this existence you mourn life's tragedy
A monolith of grief, victim of deceit.

[chorus:]
I am the healer of this universal lie,
The cosmic architect ovary of the skies,
I am the healer I shall rid you of your pain,
Chaotic inertia a hypodermic for the insane.

[solo: Dan,Sean]

Earth, wind and fire, harvests of my desire
Lift your eyes beyond these pale shallow skies
Rise from the emptiness of the hollow seas
Do not fear the unicorn's path, share the creator's dream.

I am the one.[x3]

[Repeat chorus]
