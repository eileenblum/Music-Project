I have ravaged millenniums of cosmic consciousness
Hyper-realities of a spectral gravitational mass
Canticles of wisdom, an arcane lore of light
Raise your sword to the pentacle of power

Accede to the seduction of this pristine talisman
Sanctify your sins in the shrine of the gravels of the timeless sands
Oracles of equanimity, the gift of alchemy
I am the wizard's exile, a pariah in eternity.

[chorus:]
The spirit of man writhes in veneration,
Amulets contrived with blood order sacrifice and adulation,
What is your god?
The sage of coercion?
The sedition of belief,
Compromised by treason.
By treason.......

In your face motherfucker!

Drown your fears, pledge your soul, cross the Rubicon.
Where shall your condemned spirit hide? do you think it dies?
Or are these absurd lies? Obey ancient Solomon's writ

See the light, of this esoteric dawn
Have you the will to be free? Can't you see? Is it you or me?
Sunrise of my universal sight

Have you seen the earth's revelation?
The eyes of tomorrow wonder in exhilaration
Are you the one to withstand corporeal essence?
Believer - deceiver summon the consummate passion

[solos:Dan,Sean]

[Repeat chorus]

[solo:D.Magri]
