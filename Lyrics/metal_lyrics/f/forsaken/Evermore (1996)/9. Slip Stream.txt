A captive in the ravines of the streams of unconsciousness
The maze of illusion where dreams of light and darkness lie abreast
Imprinted in eternity echoing hopes of timeless years
I live tales of first love imprisoned in a circle of fears

Oh River God can you rid me from this dragon's kiss?
Measure for measure I do not deserve the sting of this pleasure
Oh River God can I hide behind the veils of my fate?
My pound of flesh is no reward for my deceitful treasure

Her whirlwind words, ride on crescent waves
Her lips of ice, shine like silver pale gold
Beyond my reach, she slips like a salmon's leap
She rhymes in lies, I have dealt my dice

[chorus 1:]
Life is just like a slipstream,
You know just what I mean,
Life is just like a slipstream,
Open your eyes far beyond your dreams

The stone cold face fades like molten wax
A new born light speaks the heat of delight
This is my gift, a worthy prize
I have hunted the horned hunter's disguise.

[chorus 2:]
Life is just like a slipstream,
With stories that gleam,
You all know their dark secrets,
Just reach and they can be seen.
