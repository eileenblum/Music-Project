Farewell to the Chimera of my fantasy
I have sealed the chapter of this servile apostasy
Blood of resurrection please shine upon me
Let me love again, let the ashes of cruel memories die and rest
Die and rest, please let me love again

Sweet, soft aphrodisiac smother this neophyte's sins
Tame, hallowed angel, reach out for the Argonaut's wings
You speak pendragon's splendour, a willow flower in a crimson tide
Ablaze with majesty, you sparkle in with winterwild, the winterwild, so wild

[solo:Dan]

Supersonic love groove

Come, come my friend there's no need to pretend
Today's beginning sees our sadness end
A Madrigal's ode, that yearns to adore
A Valerian vigil for the eve of ever more

My electric child, spectral woman

Welcome my friend listen to the breeze whisper
Orifice of the equinox of my ambrosia
A Madrigal's ode, that yearns to adore
A Valerian vigil for the eve of Evermore

Evermore

[solo:Sean]
