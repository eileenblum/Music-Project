Brother against brother
Sin crouches at the firstborn's door
The king of the Martyrs
The pearl of great price to be avenged sevenfold

Borne from primal desires
The adversary raises his kingdom
From the innocent's blood
Sprinkled over the dirt of the once fertile earth

Judge of souls seated at the throne of the divine light
The heavenly scribe by your side
Segregating the pure from the unrighteous
Exiling trespassers to the throes of scorn and spite

Bringer of perdition
The sun sets upon Cain's Wrath
Vanquished from the garden of delight
To wander in the land of Nod

Negating hierarchy
The Apostate raises his kingdom
Preying on the failings of man
Quelling his God-given

Judge of souls seated at the throne of the divine light
The heavenly scribe by your side
Segregating the pure from the unrighteous
Exiling trespassers to the throes of scorn and spite
