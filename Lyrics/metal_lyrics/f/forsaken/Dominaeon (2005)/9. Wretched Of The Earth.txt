We drink the wine of Babylon's fornication
A communion of shallow bigots
Ever blind to god's revelation
Our histories unfold trials of retribution

We shed your blood at Golgotha
Perched your crucifix high
We bring famine to the weak
Misery to the orphaned child

Seven angels seven plagues
Redeeming man seven vials sealing our fate
We call your name we wear your mark
We bow to your wrath king of saints

We are sin - we are the Iscariot
Sons of sloth and greed - we condemn the righteous harlot

We are betrayal - we are hate
We are the spear of Longinus - Our hands serve the throne of hecate

Seven angels seven plagues
Redeeming man seven vials sealing our fate
We call your name we wear your mark
We bow to your wrath king of saints

Seven angels, legions of locusts
Seven vials, her solemn daggers
Seven churches, seven plagues
