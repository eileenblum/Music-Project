Harvesting our collective nemesis
Epistemes of doubt on the father of time
He beacons the passage to salvation
The dominion of light

Perpetual metamorphosis
An implacable will
Night falls on interminable aeons of cataclysmic sin

He is the eye of the world
The all-foreseeing truth
Born to vanquish the age of despair

Tetragram of the absolute
Redeeming the cries of smothered histories
The long lost grail of humanity
The aeon of god
The abscondant god - Dominaeon

Confessing my renascent faith
Through the dark forgotten sun
Astral horizons exorcise the lore of the demigod's talisman.
