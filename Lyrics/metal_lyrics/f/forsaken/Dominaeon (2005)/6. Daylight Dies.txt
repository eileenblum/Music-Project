Coalescence of darkness and light
Eternal liege primordial seer
Transcending the parallels of being
Purging the usurper the primeval fear

Copious dawns of inertia
Clothe the naked sun
Razing the stillborn horizons
Cosmic atrophy undone

Ominous seasons herald the age of the unspeakable
Comatose dynasties cavort with the damnable

They are parched by the thirst of the temper
Gentiles fall, distraught shadows soar
From the chasm coveting the veil
Eternal night daylight dies

Disconcerting prophecies repel his slumber
An inconsolable deity resumes his despondent journey
Amidst the weeping earth
A bloody lifeless shroud seeks shelter in his palm
The nativity of humanity forever to ponder

Coalescence of darkness and light
Eternal liege primordial seer
Transcending the parallels of being
Purging the usurper the primeval fear

Copious dawns of inertia
Clothe the naked sun
Razing the stillborn horizons
Cosmic atrophy undone
