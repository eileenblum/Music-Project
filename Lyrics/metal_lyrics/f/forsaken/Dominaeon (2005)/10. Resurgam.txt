The zenith of yearning through hopefulness
Abstracting the burden of our grief
On this ascetic earth his word is made flesh
Vitiating the genesis of the apostate
Reclamation of the birthright of man
The pharisees of deception drown in their phlegm

Iridescent yet void apothems
Wilt in the amaranthine sun
Bequeathed from the incandescent cosmos
I rise again - Resurgam

Wreathes of mockery wither in the radiance of epistles of truth
Dogmas of tyranny lay silent petruous and mute

Once resplendent saturnalian temples cower in humility
The antediluvian sin fades in the quietude of his ascendancy

The zenith of yearning through hopefulness
Abstracting the burden of our grief
On this ascetic earth his word is made flesh

Redemption cascades through spiritual nihilism
The blood of the son unfolds and breathes
He is risen - Resurgam.
