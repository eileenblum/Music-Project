Nihil a quo omnia fiunt
Nothingness begets all things

Wandering vacuous souls haunt the farthest netherworlds
Of your subconsciousness
Raven faced spectres shrouding the dimness of an ever fading light

Ruptured by incessant streams of caustic sultry tears
The bastard sons of Iblis virgin succubi
Timelessly feasting on your fears
...Feasting on your fears

(Deus absconditus: Deus revelatus) inside the corridors of chaos
(Deus absconditus: Deus revelatus) he is revealed
(Deus absconditus: Deus revelatus) the voyaging aeon
(Deus absconditus: Deus revelatus) unknown and unseen

Black feathered wings embrace
The deepest recesses of your dreams
Autumn ashen leaves rest lifelessly
Across the craven pathways of your nephilem
Nothingness of the absolute divine
