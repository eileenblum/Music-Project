I will send him to you.
He shall glorify me
Because he shall receive of mine
And shall show it to you

Tears of a slender sadness
Descend from amorphous skies
Incarnation of the macrocosm
An immutable paradox to end all lies

Mercenaries of pre destiny
Contriving myths of the uber anthropos
Ogres of heresy
Eventide's tenebrous thanatos

Human and divine
Paraclete for the dispossessed
Kenosis

He is the suffrage of this consuming nadir
Purifying sanctifying the unchaste
Kenosis - the passage to rightful enthronement
Exegesis of the blessed veiled faith

Consoling the desolate
Merciful to the blind
Kenosis
