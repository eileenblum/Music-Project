I see through your eyes
Incarnation of insanity
A paralysis of human emotion
Realms of irreversality

An ethereal animation
Beyond the source of pain
Through cessation of life
Drowned in rivers of shame

A venture for redemption that dies in vain
Cries of ovation unleash your blame

You consummate an oath of misery
The path stretched by the fortitude of indignity
Now the penance for your guilt will show
Through the visions in thy shadow

Leave me... Deceive me

You lie naked persecuted
Beyond the scythe of death
Extreme unction, the beacon for your last breath
No sacred light to contour your way
The hollowness of faith fills the recesses of your prayer

A venture for redemption that dies in vain
Cries of ovation unleash your blame

A congregation bereaves the concealed answer
Prophecies on your corpse at the temple's altar
A burnt offering, a vestige that smoulders in haste
Through astral skies your soul still begs to elucidate
