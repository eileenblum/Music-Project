"Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace...
But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings.
And you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall.
Then you will trample down the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I do these things".
[Malachi 4:1.]
