Soaring from the carrion realm
Sundering the seal of Almadel
Betroth to the antinomy of divine might
Lucifuge Refocale; he who flees from the light

Ars goetia; hierarchy of damnation
Forging evanescent empires through lust
Ascended from the circle of conjuration
Devouring honour; defiling trust

Vanguards of the void; faceless wooden pawns
Saluting the creed of greed; killing the hand that feeds
Worshipping the cult of impulse; slaves to the serpent's will
Anthropogenesis; novo ordo nihil

Mangled realities spawn from the liar of the daemon whore
The insanity spirals to pristine hyperborean shores
Bleak and forlorn, the dusk moon glow fleetingly shades your woe
Chimeral gargoyles sneer at your failings; you can only reap what you sow

Bound to a cadaverous conscience
Eidolons cast to the otherworld
Chastising the wisdom of the ageless sage
Star fires doused by the mesmerising haze
