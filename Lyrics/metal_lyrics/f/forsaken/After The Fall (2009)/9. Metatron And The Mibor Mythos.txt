Reborn each dawn
Across the morning river dews
And myriad, ever-spring hues of Mibor
Riding the eye of the storm
The bringer of light (stealing the night)
Adversary to the avenging captor

Armored by the crowning faith
Into the womb of the damned, the iniquitous land
Sworn to shield the blood of the Saviour
A gladius of virtue clasped with pride

Lucifer dethroned, Satan writhes and cries
Ending the scourge of the serpent tempter

Rise Metatron Rise!
Receiver of souls
Your tears weighed by the transgressions of man

Awake blessed angel
Child of the fire mist
Forever in hell the legions of legematon shall burn

Reaching for the Sun
The seasons of renewal set sail
Over impervious, cruel winter seas
Bestowing hope to the sinners' pleas
