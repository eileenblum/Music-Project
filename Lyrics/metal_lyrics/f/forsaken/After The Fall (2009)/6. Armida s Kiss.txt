Deserted in oceans of absence
Where sirens laud wondrous ephemeral souls
We remain moored at the edge
Of the broken sands of time

Transcending the insidious calm
We steer toward the unwalled kingdom of Damear
As our final hour approaches
The hopelessness still draws ever so near

Enthralled by the haunting sighs of Armida
Star of the crescent sands
Our faith ebbs in the seducing beauty of her impassioned kiss

Frail and bare, our sanity abates
The essence of meaning escapes us
Our dreams sear and die
In the embrace of the hollow sun

Our solicitude prejudiced
Our hunger abounds
The days of pain still linger
The suffering does not subside

Piety and ebullience eclipsed
The bleakness abounds
Dystopia ruptures our hypnotic slumber
Where the doom is our only trusted companion and guide

Enchanted by the charms of the unknowable
We take refuge in the treacherous lure of her lips
