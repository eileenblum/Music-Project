Aidenn falls, chaos' son rises through the gate of eternal fire
He satiates our lust and nurtures our primeval desires
Inscribing our finality through spiritual cataclysm
Consecrating our vanity; binding us to gods of materialism

We spiral through the labyrinthine madness
Truth subsides in the nepenthe of false shamans

Anesthetized and subdued
Destined to an opaque reality
The righteous path obscured
We wage our atonement for a beguiling divinity

We spiral through the labyrinthine madness
Truth subsides in the nepenthe of false shamans
He rests on the ashes of a dying world
Azrael shadows the gaze of the fading sun
