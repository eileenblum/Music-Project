"He was despised and rejected by men... a man of sorrows"
[Isaiah 58:3]

Demiurge; Demigod of deception
Monarch of the apostate pantheon
Genealogy of betrayal
Procreator of damnation
Guardian of the nefarious legion

Transgressor; usurper
Begetting the seed of Cain
Harvesting the souls of the pure
Consorting and blinding the fallen will
Preying on the frailty of the vain

The misguided worship your sins
Parading idols and embracing dogmas of treason
Yet He has come for His forsaken kin
(Behold) the Rising Phoenix - the man of eternal sorrow

He rises above dying embers of battle ravaged lands
Man reborn from the womb of blood thirsty hands
The sword of justice falls on those who murder, maim and rape
Blood red skies mark the plains where the innocent die without dignity

The misguided worship your sins
Parading idols and embracing dogmas of treason
Yet He has come for His forsaken kin
The suffering servant - He is the forever-changing season
