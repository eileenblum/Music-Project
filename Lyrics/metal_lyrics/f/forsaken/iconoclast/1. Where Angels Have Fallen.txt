[lyrics: Albert Bell / Music: Forsaken]

Crimson tears summon me to the eclipse of my death
For the reckoning of my sins I shall pledge
A black veil of emotionless silence begs to clothe me
Through the halls of spiritual existence
I crawl on this journey

On wings of fire, the call of judgement rides
In the chalise of eternal void I seek to hide
Into the Infinite abyss of darkness I am to sleep
In mourning for the last straws of life, I weep

Desolate, I pray for the dawning sun
The throne of light remains concealed
Alone, tied in these chains of Solitude
I cannot Feel

[Chorus]
Where angels have fallen
My wailing soul is laid to rest
The tombstone is chosen
A cauldron for my new quest

What is this empty shell withered by the winter rains?
Not one drop of drying blood, nor the pleasure of pain
Beyond my grave I hear the dying fall
To their lifless souls I call
I wait for agonized centuries to no avail
An infernal sleep that revives my claim

In death, I died, where no white saviour came

Betrayed by the thousand year faith
Embalmed in this forbidden dream
Solitary I shudder in the chill of stillness
My body still yearns for its bloodstream

...And yet I call His name this last time

[Chorus]
Where angels have fallen
My wailing soul is laid to rest
The tombstone is chosen
A cauldron for my new quest
