[Lyrics: Albert Bell / Music: Forsaken]

This resurrected withering pain
Deafening my silence
A haunting re-visited
Weakening my resilience

Maelstroms of indignity
Forged in hate
Tribal steel
Carving your fate (carve your fate)

....Wither the Hour

Instinctual attrition
A path through the sublime
Caress your slumber
Savour the taste of the pilgrim's grime

Sacrificial Masque
Twilight of the virginal dawn
Blood enthroned
Anonymity, forever forlorn
(Blood enthroned)

[Chorus]
A vortex to impure
Slowly murdering my inner sanctum
Dreams so obscure
Brandishing the end of my Elysium

The wounds of my nemesis
A testimony to a lusting hunger
I awaken alone in the cusp of the untamed primal hunter
Ceremonies of impulse
Re-birth of a deafening humanity
This art of retribution
Reprisal for lost aeons of subtlety
Lost aeons of subtlety

[Chorus]
A vortex to impure
Slowly murdering my inner sanctum
Dreams so obscure
Brandishing the end of my Elysium
