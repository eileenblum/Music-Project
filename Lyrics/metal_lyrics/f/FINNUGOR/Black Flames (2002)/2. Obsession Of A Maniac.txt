A secret path beyond the crypt
Leads down into the deep
A murderer lives down there
A cannibal, perverse madman

He use to crawl out from his hole
When the full moon shines above the graveyard
He's possessed by a demon
He baths in blood, eats worms and bugs!

Nervous breakdown
Anger directs the fingers
What hold the bloody razor
And skinning your flesh to appease his hunger
He's dancing in the darkness and pays homage to black arts
He's holding ceremonies and disgusting rites

The dissection has just begun
A new victim who's innocent
Lying on the sacrificial altar
She's crying for her freedom
And tries to bite her straps off
But he slits her up, tearing out the insides
To wear them like an elegant cloth!

Nervous breakdown
Anger directs the fingers
What hold the bloody razor
And skinning your flesh to appease his hunger
He's dancing in the darkness and pays homage to black arts
He's holding ceremonies and disgusting rites

The demon in him
What never existed
Forces him to do everything
Its thirst is unquenchable
Fear makes it stronger
It lives inside the cruel slaughter
But this is just obsession of a maniac!
