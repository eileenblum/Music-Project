Time has stopped
Everything's so still
A frozen bird fell down
Of an old pine tree
Snow flakes cover my eyes
Cold wind blows my hair
Nightfall is fading the light
Of hope in my frozen heart
I'm sleeping on an icy field
Awaiting for the Reaper
On a day of an endless winter


Thanks to dreen1 for correcting tracks ## 9, 10 lyrics.
