Voices fell like the darkness
Drowned in the dying evening's eerie silence
Whispers of summer's affections
Disappeared into the falling shades of winter

...the noose is tied
...and the hangman smiles

I lost my way, my only way
I'm beyond the last goodbye
I lost my way, my only way
A dead season in a dead world

All hope is lost, faith deprived
Torn apart and shattered into the ground
No point in gathering what is left
No use breathing life into something that is dead

Time stands still in this surreal moment
That seems to last forever... And for me it will!

I lost my way, my only way
I'm beyond the last goodbye
I lost my way, my only way
A dead season in a dead world
