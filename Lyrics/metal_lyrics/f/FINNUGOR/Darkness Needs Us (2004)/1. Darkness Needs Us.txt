Dying culture on this cursed planet
Frozen, forgotten dreams of sadness
You're digging your grave of madness
Falling asleep to the nothingness

You've already killed your idols
You've nothing to do with faith anymore
The candle blew out at the end of the tunnel
Only fear remained in this cave of worms

Slimy bloody guts on the face
It looks like the former human race
Your mind became a hideaway of demons
False philosophical movements feeding the curse

Rotten flesh, sick yellow eyeholes
Impending doom is knocking on your door
This is disease, fiery pain, burried end
Grub-eaten universe, days of the dead

Our magic can heal and ease the pain
Our magic can kill and incite to hate
Even if only darkness remained for us
We rule it, we are one 'cause darkness needs us
