Falling into the abyss of subconsciousness
Traveling without moving, through the hollow emptiness
Deep dreams of bloody mystic seas
The wound in my mind which was only misery and disease
Transformed now into a gate
That leads to knowledge and sealed my fate

Pain is the solution!
Immortalized me for endless thousand years
Pain is the key!
To the door that leads to eternity

The roots of the force
Are growing under the blood-soaked ground
Everything seems wasting away
As I'm waking up and looking around

The burning eyes of cold truth
Are watching the prey, there's no more pray
Domination, freedom!
I rule the pain of eternal wisdom

Force of decay cannot rule on me anymore
Stronger than time or space, I face the storm
I saw the places that you've never seen
I heard the voices of the deepest realms
I felt the cosmic darkness deep within
What you've never dared to believe in
Pain is the kingdom of eternal wisdom
I am the Lord of the Darkest freedom!

Domination!
A secret of nature that never dies
Execution!
I'm the gate of fate: vengeace is mine
Magic solution!
The pain brings you sacrifice
Eternal wisdom!
I am the Lord of the Darkest freedom
