Rebirth from the ashes
Shadows above sleeping cities
Flying apparitions without bodies
Fear materialized into an army
There's no weapon against our malefic force
We came back with the nightfall

We enter the dreams by will and force
We steal the virgins, their screaming voice:
Broke the silence
Filled the darkness

Nothing remained, no chance or choice
Flow of blood and black fire-balls:
Flooded the streets
Burnt down the bridges

All the mortal knew their hope was gone
The prophecies warned them, this day will come
Emptiness in the hearts
Madness in the eyes

There's no gravity for us
There's no sanity for us
Breaking the elements of the Earth
We call to life and giving birth to something
What never existed
Without brain or a human body
A shapeless cloud
What was caughing death and bleedin black
It was called The End!
