Bloody massacre on the Night of Avargh
Ruinous dragons tore the flesh under the Moon
Lost safety in the tunnels of dwarfs
I tried to hide away from my impending doom

I was wearing a ring where a spirit dwelt within
On my dragon-scaled arm of unworldly forces
I stuck in the darkest, infinite tunnels of nothing
Hiding away from my fears and painful memories

S'almeynal the first battledragon!
I could use his power as a weapon
Wearing his soul in my ring
Locked inside on my scaly wrist

Asbar! the legendary place!
Where dragons wore the mask of human race
Was calling me with vicious, eerie mist
With anger I shook my reptile clawed fist

I will return and fight!
With the force of fire
With my Hand of Light
I'll kill out all desire!
I will punish and pay back!
You'll be revenged, you'll be dead!
Will punish and pay back!
You'll be revenged, you'll be dead!

With my hand of dragon gods and burning light
I'll tear out your bloody guts and pulsating heart!
Burning like a piece of wood:
This will be your salvation!
Cruel execution!
Wreaking my vengeance on you
This is my mission!
End of fornication!
