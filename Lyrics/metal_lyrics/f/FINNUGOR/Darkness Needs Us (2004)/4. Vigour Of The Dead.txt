They laughed when I cried
They smiled when I died
I failed with my grotesque lifestyle
My blood's feeding the worms now

My astral body is the essence
Touching dimensions without any sense
Time-traveller eternal life after death
Spectral moving, nothingcan ease my wrath

No grave, no gravity!
In the deep, I am depravity!
No soul, no sanity!
In my kingdom I am insanity!

Somewhere, up there
A voice is calling me to life
Someone is waiting for me there
She's pregnant, marked with a sign:

Of cruelty and coldness!
She bathes in a pool of blood
Suffering from waekness
She's dying when I come to life

I was once with the earth!
Under the sod I was one with the dungeon
I was dead but dreaming, I kept all the wisdom

Beware of my rebirth!
Dominion arrives even if I lost my kingdom
The vigour of the dead got back its freedom!

No grave, no gravity!
In the deep, I was depravity!
No soul, no sanity!
The vigour of the dead brings cruel insanity!
