In the heart of the woods, avoiding the daylight
Lurking beast was sneaking in the twilight
Whispering of the trees was flying with the wind
Agony of lost, crying children filled the fog with grief

I lost you on a night
I never see you smile
I'm hunting every night
With sword on my side

I'm running again
In the Forest of Bane
I don't feel the pain
I am not afraid

You were my destiny
My beloved sanity
I was your loverman
I will be your headsman

In the heart of the woods, avoiding the daylight
She was silently sneaking in the twilight
Whispering of the trees was flying with the wind
On her irresistible voice she was calling me softly

I found you on a night
I was terrified of your smile
I still knew who you were
I still remembered

I was running again
In the Forest of Bane
When I saw your face
I lost all my faith

You will be my destiny
It's cruesl insanity
I cannot hurt you with a sword
I'll be eaten by a werewolf
