You were there for me, when I needed some reality
Held my hand make me feel like a man
But it's all part of a bigger plan
A plan for me to lose my mind

Ooh but you turned your back
Just walked away and never looked back
Complete unravel of our intimate ties
You just kept walkin like you didn't even hear me cryin your name
Don't walk away

She can't hold it for ransom anymore
Didn't say a word just walked out the door
Stop wanting what you cannot get
You see there might be something better yet

When I met her first,
All I noticed was some curves in a shirt
I didn't notice what was in her mind
And now I'm running from it all of the time
Sooo it's good that she's gone
I should a never never held on so long
I don't think that she will ever be back
She just kept walkin like she couldn't even hear me call her name

She can't hold it for ransom anymore
Didn't say a word just walked out the door
Stop wanting what you cannot get
You see there might be something better yet
