It takes a long time
To come back from losing your mind
Take it from someone who really knows
Everytime you turn around
There's someone there to drag you down
And everytime you lose control
You knock yourself right back down in the hole

Every step is not the last that you'll ever take
Every mistake is not the last one you'll ever make
And when you need a helping hand
There's someone there to kick the sand in
When you need a real rescue there's no one
Coming to help you

I will walk through life with a rabbitâs foot hanging from my side
So I can thwart off bad luck in the direction of my stride
Good luck is my guide [x2]

It's been a long time since I have lost my mind
And I wish I really didn't know
And everytime I turn around I pick myself up from down
And when I need a helping hand there's someone there to help me stand
And everytime I lose control I climb right back out of the hole.

I will walk through life with a rabbitâs foot hanging from my side
So I can thwart off bad luck in the direction of my stride
Good luck is my guide [x2]
