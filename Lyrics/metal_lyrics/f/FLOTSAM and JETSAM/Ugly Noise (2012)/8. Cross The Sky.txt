As I lay here bleeding
My eyes are fixed on the sky
Hero down for a reason
It looks like my time to die

I never thought I'd be taken down
Flat on my back seeing stars
Gotta rethink my strategy
I hope it ain't my time

I gotta believe there's a soul to save
As I race across the sky
I gotta believe there is still some good
As I look you in the eye
There's gotta be someone worth fighting for
As I look at you and sigh
I gotta believe there's a soul to save
As I race across the sky
As I lay here bleeding
I wonder what will be next
Was I ever a hero?
I think it's my time to die

I can sure be taken down
The power of one frail voice
Gotta give up on strategy
I think it's my time to die

I gotta believe there's a soul to save
As I race across the sky
I gotta believe there is still some good
As I look you in the eye
