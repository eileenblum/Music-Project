Demons that never sleep, secrets that I keep
Water water everywhere but not enough to drink
Demons that never sleep, secrets that I keep
Water water everywhere but not enough to drink

Scorch everything in sight, scorch it all right
Burn it down in one night
Scorch everything in sight, torch it all night
Burn it down in one night
Burn it down

Revolution so far from here, as the days get longer
How can you not know, the waves burn in the melting snow

Demons that never sleep, secrets that I keep
Water water everywhere but not enough to drink
Demons that never sleep, secrets that I keep
Water water everywhere but not enough to drink
