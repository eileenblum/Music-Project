I believe there's a storm comin down, and we're all in over our heads
I believe that we'll all hit ground, and may even wind up dead
I believe in a chance to survive, no matter what the experts said
I can tell there's something goin down, I can feel it, I can feel it

I believe, I believe
I believe, but I don't know what

I believe that a chance to survive, depends on where you put your head
And I know there's something going wrong, I can Feel, I can feel, I can feel it

I believe, I believe
I believe, but I don't know what

I believe there's a safe way out, where no one has to get hurt
Like the hand of God comin down, and lifting you out by your shirt
I believe if we don't look out, we'll end up face in the dirt
I can see there's something goin on, I can feel, I can feel, I can see it,

I believe, I believe
I believe, but I don't know what
