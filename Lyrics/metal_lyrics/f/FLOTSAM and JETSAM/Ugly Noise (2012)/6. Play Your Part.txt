Their sad little eyes that make me wanna cry lacerates my heart
The way that the skin looks all sunken in, nauseates my emotions
The cry for help that makes me want to fix it all
The need for the cavalry to ride in and save the day
You can try to walk on by
You can turn your thoughts away
You can ride the wave of denial
And let them suffer another day
Cut through your heart until it pays
Donât play your part keep your own ways
You can try to walk on by
You can turn your thoughts away
You can ride the wave of denial
And let them suffer another day
I canât bleed anymore, I can only give so much till Iâm done
I canât let this go away, even though I could ride away in the sun
Under siege over looked seen as just another block in the road
Under siege over looked, reap and carry all that you can steal
