I chose to walk this path you sure can't take it from me
I follow my own footsteps that lead me to the door
Oh the price I've paid, just to keep my soul free
I veer off the beaten path, just to see what I can see

To be here, to have my mind
To be alive, to be free
Oh the price I've paid, just to keep my head straight
I may have missed out a little, but now I'm doing great

To be away, back in my mind
To be living, to be free
Oh the price I've paid, just to keep my soul free
I may have missed out a little, but now I'm fuckin free

Free To Be What I Want To Be
