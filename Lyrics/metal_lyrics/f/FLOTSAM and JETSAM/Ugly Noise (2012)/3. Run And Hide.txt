I feel alive, no regrets
I just can't take it any more
So I try to run and hide
From things I felt inside
Before it hits me in the throat

These things that happened to me
These things you want me to be
I realized that I was wrong

I'm still alive, take no bets
I just can't feel it any more
So I try to run and hide
From things I felt inside
Before it puts me to the floor

I can feel its fingers around my neck
Squeezing the life out of me
Why won't this all just go away
And let me be me
