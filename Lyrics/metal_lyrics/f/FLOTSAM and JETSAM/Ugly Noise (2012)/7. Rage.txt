I can't control my â RAGE
Violence and â RAGE
Addicted to the â RAGE
Feel my rage
Like waters I will â RAGE
Boiling to a â RAGE
Like a bull I â RAGE
Walk me thru the rage

There's a battle in my mind, anger hits me all the time
As I'm imprisoned in a cage, I can feel it turning to
I can't control my â RAGE
Violence and â RAGE
Addicted to my â RAGE
Feel my rage

There's a battle in my mind, anger hits me all the time
As I'm imprisoned in a cage, I can feel it turning to

Unrelenting â RAGE
Irritating â RAGE
Violence and brutal force will start a riot
RAGE â aggravate my
RAGE â complicate the
Rage â Rage violence and â RAGE

There's a battle in my mind, anger hits me all the time
As I'm imprisoned in my skin, I can feel it turning in to

RAGE â I can't control my
RAGE â Unrelenting
Aggravating, Complicating â RAGE
Violence and â RAGE
Addicted to my â RAGE
Boiling to a â RAGE
Rage rage rage
I'll give you my â RAGE
Walk me thru the â RAGE
Feel the wrath of my mother fuckin' God forsaken â RAGE
Nerves start wearing thin, that's when I begin
To call upon the RAGE, RAGE RAGE RAGE
