I got tools to mow down everybody, I got triggers waiting
I got plans to take out everybody; I know where they're hiding
I got sights set on a few that need to be addressed
When I run it thru my head it ends a bloody mess yea

Sick of all the people running up and down my back
Better to eliminate them than have a heart attack
Everybody on my case had better step aside
When I think I've had enough, you all better run and hide yea

I'm past the point of no return

I got tools to mow down everybody, I got triggers pulled
I've begun to take out everybody they're no longer hiding
I hit sights among a few no longer need addressed
When I run it thru my head it looks just like this
Sick of all the people running up and down my back
Better to eliminate them
