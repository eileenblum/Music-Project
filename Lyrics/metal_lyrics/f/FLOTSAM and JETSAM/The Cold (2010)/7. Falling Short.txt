Can you feel the drive?
Can you feel the push?
Does the blood start to boil
Subconscious making a fist
Every face a target
Every life a prize
Just the thought of pain
Keeps your anger alive

I can feel my heart
Breaking in pieces
Nothing but sorrow
Haunting inside
Loneliness killing me
Ever so slowly
Blade to my throat
And prepare to die

Is it worth my life?
Is it worth your life?
Is it worth wasting the time?
Can it be all so
Thought overtaking?
Can we just let it slip by?

Hands are shaking mouth is dry and
My heart breaking watching you die
Spinning backward falling short of
Pitching in to save your life

Bare to taste it
Bare to feel it
Bare to live
Grit your teeth
Grit your clench
Grit and bare
Feel the glory
Feel the pain
Feel the fade
Crawl to safety
Crawl on your knees
Fall to your death

Hands are shaking mouth is dry and
My heart breaking watching you die
Spinning backward falling short of
Pitching in to save your life

I have felt my heart
Crumble to pieces
Finally sorrow
Ventures outside
Loneliness walking
Away from its kill
Blade in my throat
I'm left to die

It's taken my life
It'll take your life
Taking it's sweet, sweet time
It's taking over
Over and over
Stealing and wasting our time

Hands are shaking mouth is dry and
My heart breaking watching you die
Spinning backward falling short of
Pitching in to save your life

I can feel my heart
Breaking in pieces
Nothing but sorrow
Empty inside

My heart is breaking
