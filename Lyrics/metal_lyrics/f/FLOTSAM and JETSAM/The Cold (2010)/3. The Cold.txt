It all comes down to this
How to hold on to life I once had with you
An addiction like this
The supply slips away without warning
Don't know how to survive
I still need you to fill all the voids inside

You're the blood inside
You're the beat of my soul
You're the breath inside
You're the thought that I hold
You're the blood inside
You're the beat of my soul

How should I keep time from ticking away
Stop tomorrow from coming
How can I hold the craving at bay
So better off when I didn't know
Coming at me so fast I can't run
Years of minutes of seconds of time
Put inside all I am, all I have
Pay the toll to hear what's on my mind

Where do I go from here
The sun doesn't rise where I am
Spring never rises from fall
And the nightingale doesn't sing

Where do I go from here
There is no yellow brick road
No reference for my dreams
And no warmth to hide the cold

The cold
The cold
The cold
The cold

What is left for the time that I have
What is forward for looking to
Every path that I take is washed out
Every star is burnt out to follow
Passing by me so fast motion slow
Years of minutes of seconds of time
Generations learning what I know
Pay the toll to hear what's on my mind

Where do I go from here
The sun doesn't rise where I am
Spring never rises from fall
And the nightingale doesn't sing

Where do I go from here
There is no yellow brick road
No reference for my dreams
And no warmth to hide the cold

The cold
The cold
The cold
The cold

The cold
The cold
The cold
The cold
