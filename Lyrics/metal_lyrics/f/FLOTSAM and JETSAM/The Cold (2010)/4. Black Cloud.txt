I've never screwed anyone
That didn't fuck me
And I don't climb the branch
Of another man's tree
I try not to talk
Behind the back
Never enter into thought
If you're Jew or black
Always pay what I owe
Owe what I pay
Doesn't matter if you're female
Muslim or gay
If you're cool to me
I'll be cool to you
And if you lie to me
I won't be straight with you
I never win the lottery
Never catch a break
When I get money back
You bet it's a mistake
When I gamble
I should just throw it away
I take another hit
But know I should've stayed
The green light goes
To start the race
But the helmet falls down
To cover my face
I spread my wings
And I'm ready to fly
And the wind and thunder clouds
Cover the sky

Why does all the crap come back on me?
When does the barrage of bad luck cease?
How long can the black cloud follow me?
How much of this can I take?
Why does all the crap come back on me?
When does the barrage of bad luck cease?
How long can the black cloud follow me?
How much of this can I take?

Why does the black cloud follow me?
Why does the black cloud follow me?
Black cloud follow

When I beat you
I was just returning serve
I climbed the ladder once
When I had nerve
Run for my life
But stop to tie my shoe
When I raped you
I was just taming the shrew
There's a paycheck in my name I see
But I've got no acceptable form of ID
There's a wall at the end
Of a broken path
Add two and two together
But beware of the math
There's a place on earth
Where I feel safe
But I've never been able
To find that place
When I'm high I think
I've got it figured out
Yet my performance is filled
With an aching doubt
There's a feel in the air
That I'm going to win
But the air up here
Is extremely thin
There's a storm cloud chasing me
Wherever I go
And the only people helping me
Keep telling me no
