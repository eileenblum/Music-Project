Well I can see by the look in your eye
That everything I'm telling you
Is passing you by
There's a side of me that you don't know
And if you listen close
I'll tell you what you want to hear
That I can see by the look in your eye
That I can see by the look in your eye

So I don't have to hear you cry
Stick a needle in my eye
So I don't have to see your tears
Scream until I couldn't hear
So I don't have to feel your pain
I bang my head till I'm insane
So I don't have to know the truth
I don't wanna know the real you

I know by the angle of your brow
That everything I'm telling you
Is confusing you now
I know where I really should be
Always guessing what's next
What's cool for me
There's a dream that I just can't see
There's a path of a way
To get where I wanna be
There's a drive in my soul
A pounding beat of rock and roll

I've got a secret life
An aching need an unlived dream
I've got a secret life
An unknown desire chasing me
I've got a secret life
An aching need an unlived dream
I need a secret life
A way to escape the one I live

So many things you don't know
That count on me to be the show
So many places you may go
Exist because I am
Action adventure in my mind
A job well done of a different kind
Lives depend on my every move
And death becomes my favorite groove

I don't know where I'm meant to be
But nowhere I've been seems right to me
I can tell when I'm in the right place
Strapped in my seat and ready to race
I can tell when I'm in the groove
Everything's a go and ready to move
And I really ain't been there yet
But I ain't done on that, you can bet

I've got a secret life
An aching need an unlived dream
I've got a secret life
An unknown desire chasing me
I've got a secret life
An aching need an unlived dream
I need a secret life
A way to escape the one I live

So many things you don't know
That count on me to be the show
So many places you may go
Exist because I am
Action adventure in my mind
A job well done of a different kind
Lives depend on my every move
And death becomes my favorite groove

So many things you don't know
That count on me to be the show
So many places you may go
Exist because I am
Action adventure in my mind
A job well done of a different kind
Lives depend on my every move
And death becomes my favorite groove

Secret life
