See the way you take my soul
Laugh at how you steal my pride
Crush the dreams that I once had
I'll take it all in stride
Give up everything I've worked for
Give you everything you want
Leave behind my friends and past
To watch you walk away

I did it all for you
I gave you more than I had to give
I gave it all to you
I keep on giving and you just take

Take what you want from me
And throw the rest away
See you standing proud
About the way you forced me down
Into the ground

Show me how to fear another
Teach me not to trust again
Always look over my shoulder
Live with what you took from me
No more can I close my eyes
I just see you walk away
I can't clear my head of you
I cry another day

I did it all for you
I gave you more than I had to give
I gave it all to you
I keep on giving and you just take

Take, take, take
Take what you want from me
And throw the rest away
See you standing proud
About the way you forced me down
Into the ground
Take what you need from me
And leave the rest behind
Take what you want
Take it and leave

Take what you want from me
And throw the rest away
See you standing proud
About the way you forced me down
Into the ground
