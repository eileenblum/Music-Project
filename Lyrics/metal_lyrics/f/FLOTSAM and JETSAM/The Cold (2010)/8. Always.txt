I see you comin'
From miles away
I see the crap that
You're spittin' out your face

I can see right through your shit
And about a pound ago
I had enough of it
And I love when you try to disguise
How much you despise
How much you despise me
Long ago I thought we were through
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can do
Still you kept me hangin' on
To amuse yourself
You can play the god

I see you
And you're in my mind
Always dead
Always dead each time

I see you leavin'
You're miles away
I see the crap that
You're leavin' in your trace

I can see right through your shit
And about a ton ago
I had enough of it
And I love when you try to disguise
How much you despise
How much you despise me
Long ago I thought we were through
There's nothing I can say
Nothing I wanna do
Still you kept me hangin' on
To amuse yourself
You have played the god

I see you
And you're in my mind
Always dead
Always dead each time

I can see right through your shit
And about a pound ago
I had enough of it
And I love when you try to disguise
How much you despise
How much you despise me
Long ago I thought we were through
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can do
Still you kept me hangin' on
To amuse yourself
You play the god

I see you
And you're in my mind
Always dead
Always dead each time
I see you
And you're in my mind
Always dead
Always dead each time
