Sometimes I feel like just ending it all
Every step a broken leg
Every floor breaks a fall
I can't only not see light
I can't find the tunnel
Life keeps giving me an uphill climb
Without a ladder or a rope
Without a prayer or a hope
I can't only not see light
I can't find the tunnel

I can't find my way
Don't know if I'll see tomorrow
Or the rest of today
I can't raise my head
Maybe I'm better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
I can't only not see light
I'm better off dead

Every time we try to step ahead
Step ahead
There's a force that holds us down
Holds us back, keeps us in
And I pray every day
That things will take a turn
That tomorrow brings me hope
That today will slip away
I can't only not see light
I can't close my eyes

I have lost my way
Don't know about tomorrow
Or the best of today
I won't raise my head
And so I'm better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
I can't only not see light
I'm better off dead

I can't only not see light
I'm better off dead

Sometimes I feel like I've ended it all
Every step a shooting pain
Every floor breaks a fall
I can't only not see light
I'm better off dead
Better off dead
Better off

So stick my body in the ground
And find a priest and gather round
And say a little prayer to god
Throw some flowers on the sod cause
I will never see light
And I'm better off dead
