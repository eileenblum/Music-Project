Words are spoken around a lie
A hundred needles in the eye
Hands and hearts in a fiery mess
Burning trust while still in the dress

Writing from the window signs
Seems to think that two are combined
Truth and loyality locked behind a door
Rather by a lying bitch
Than found to be whore

Caught red handed, knees are down
Weapon in hand, going to town
No back story, no where to run
Caught red handed, with a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
