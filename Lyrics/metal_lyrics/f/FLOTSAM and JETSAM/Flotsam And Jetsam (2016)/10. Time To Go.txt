I see the sunrise every mornin'
As I try to sleep my mind erasing
Still replacing what I'll never keep
The world is spinning even faster
Faster spinning speed
Ten million horse power
Powered by the rich and greed

See like dying people on the move
A daily grind no hope
Or dream of where to find
One of another kind
The skin I'm walking in belongs
To someone I don't know
I don't know where I'm going
But it's time to go

It's time to go
Unlock the chains around your feet
It's time to fly
Unlock the chains and spread your wings

I get the feeling there is something
That's about to start
I don't pretend to know it all
I barely know my part
We play the roll we pay the toll
We get what's coming back
You slap a face
A fist is surely comin' on attack
The lights are dimming

It's a trick to pull you down
And everything you think
Manipulates the sound
Everything is happening so fast
Can't keep control
I don't know where I'm going
But it's time to go

It's time to go
Unlock the chains around your soul
It's time to cry
Take down the blindfold from your eye

I can see the shit goin' around
I can see the shit goin' away
I can tell that everything is wonderful
As lond as I'm livin' your day
Frustration punch you in the eye
There's a line you just won't cross
I've been spun around so many times
I think I just got lost

It's time to go
Unlock the chains around your feet
It's time to cry
Take down the blindfold from your eye
