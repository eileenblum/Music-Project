Back in the time when the gods would tell
You what to do or you'll go to hell
The father cried and the angels fell
Constant reminder in the church's bell

The fear of ending being stuck right here
The same evil every year after year
In the present we can see it clear
One god, one being to fear

The punishment for religious crimes
A sleeping place for the rest of time
Bleed your soul 50 piercing blades
The iron maiden where you've been laid

An evil bishop in a chamber of hell
He says the demons hide so well
We'll have to bleed him from head to toe
It's the only way to really know

Disobey a priest or king
It's all upon yourself you bring
A bed of spites for eternity
Torture test your will to be

The punishment for religious crimes
A sleeping place for the rest of time
Bleed your soul 50 piercing blades
The iron maiden where you've been laid

Up right and leaning for the blood to flow
Drains you of life but slow
Involuntary screams of pain
The sound of blood like dripping rain

Disobey a priest or king
It's all upon yourself you bring
A bed of spites for eternity
Torture test your will to be

The punishment for religious crimes
A sleeping place for the rest of time
Bleed your soul 50 piercing blades
The iron maiden where you've been laid
