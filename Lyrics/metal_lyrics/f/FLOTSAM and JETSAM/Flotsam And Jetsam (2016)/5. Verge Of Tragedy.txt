The pressure building up in blood flow
The pushing right behind the eyes
Teeth chattering as if the snow blows
Emotions over flowing time

A stirring pot of plasmic chemicals
The nauseous feeling in the gut
Fingers are numb and hair is standing
The strongest urge to feel the cut

Right on the verge of tragedy
All senses feel intensity

There are no words to start the calming
There is no exercise of mind
Here's hoping it will let the course flow
And dissipate in ample time

Loss of control is very frightening
All thoughts to how to make this end
The wave of heat comes without timing
Irritating uninvited friend

Right on the verge of tragedy
All senses feel intensity

Cold sweat and everything goes silent
Black spos that cover everything
