From the book of Revelation
Seven seals hide the of time
A little lamb with seven horns and seven eyes
Apocalyptic document
Papyrus scroll sealed in war
Seven seals mark the suffering

The first four were the horsemen
Each with a mission in mind
Conquest, famine, death and war
The cries of the martyrs
For his word is fire
Run to and pro till the end of time

Seven trumpets roar, seven bowls of wrath
A seven headed beast, the seven seals of the scroll
Peels of thunder, lighting cracks, rumbling the sky

Fire from the altar, judgement is coming down
As the priest becomes executioner
The great storm from the throne of God
Turmoil and chaos bring
Seven angels start the trumpeting
