Fifty thousand volts of death
I can't move or take a breath
Inject venom, force feed pain
Total power he will gain
Ever ready poison flies
Breaks you down to comply
Pierce the skin with his command
Take you down with one hand

In the muscle in the skin
Into veins of blue again
Barbed intruder violater
Stinging your brain into place
Heavy metal forces jolting
Brings you to the floor
Freeze, alto, stop, tinghzi
Hit the ground hit the door

I feel the hand of thunder
Its power pulls you under
Its unforgiving grip of death
Electrocute my innocence

They say stop and you think run
Better than a smoking gun
Feel the power know the might
Flying wires take a bite
Flashing lights are in your eye
Feel like you're about to die
Try to run but muscles slow
Johnny law is now in tow

Recovery is rather quick
The memory of pain will stick
Feeling glad you didn't die
See the laughter in his eye
The only choice is stay or run
Officer with smoking gun
Feel the sting of power flow
Down the only way to go
