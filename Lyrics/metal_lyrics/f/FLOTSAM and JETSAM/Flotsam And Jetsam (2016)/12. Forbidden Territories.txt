Destiny so close at hand
The future it holds for man
Boundaries incase the lives
Of those who choose not to die
Confined to a world without end
The sentence of life now begins
Imprisoned to face the curse
Of perpetual hell on earth

Forbidden territories
Notorious, sovereign power
To control the underworld
Infamous city of old
Existence now at stake
Survival of the human race
Demands were made for amnesty
For all defected and diseased

Against time
Race through the night
Loosen the grip
Of the hold on his life for all
Why to exist
For in failure
They share his sentence that calls
For the end of humanity
Till the world is
Free of all
The pain and the sorrow
For one man's quest to see tomorrow

Annihilation
Must now take place
Contest all that stand in the way
Abduction
Which holds the key to life
We would like to believe
Destination as time expires
The wall that separates desires
Beyond the wall man's freedom lies
The answer to remain alive
