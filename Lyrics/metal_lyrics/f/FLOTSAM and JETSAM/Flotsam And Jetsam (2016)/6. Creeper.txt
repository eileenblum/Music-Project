In the heart of battle
You can see the steam rise
From the open wounds of the dead
The bodies carpet the whole hill side
A river flowing red

Hundreds of thousands of people
Spending lives just for me ya
All the suffering so I can be set free

Evil and his army out there
And I will hunt them all down
No chance at all they will survive
My friends and neighbors go there
With one vision in mind
To rid the world of another hypnotized

Ignorant interpretation
No love thy neighbor rule
Skew the writing
For the self serving view
Create your own new meanings
To justify your feelings
You wanna rape and kill
So Allah loves you

Kill for the kill
Call it God's will
Every death has a price
Kill for him and arise

They don't discriminate ya
Religious masturbator
Big plans for multiple kills
The evil takes the hand of
Every sweat, dirt, lovin freak
The big man has no mercy
For the weak

The torture and the screaming
This makes your Allah proud
So proud you hide behind a shroud
Doesn't matter where you hide
Pray and prepare to die
Your reign is ending
And it's time to go
