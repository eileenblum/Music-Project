There's a real thin line between
What's real and what's fantasy
Crawling slowly
Towards a breaking point for me
Falling faster down a hole
Bottom I can't see momentum gaining
As I'm picking up speed

There's a force that's forcing me down
There's a drive that's driving me away
There's a catch that catches me off guard
There's a point that I just don't get

The water's so clean I can see bottom
Through the hole in the boat
Pitch and bail
Till the end of our sunshine
Everything that I am dragged through
The muck and the grime
Don't count on me
Cause it's my fuk'n time

I don't wanna be the monkey wrench
That carries all the pain
Making this all feel so real
It almost carries it's own weight
