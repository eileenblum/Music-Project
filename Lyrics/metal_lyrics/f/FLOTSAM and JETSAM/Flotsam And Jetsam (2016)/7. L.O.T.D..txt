Long ago in another time
Somewhere near Gadera line
Demons in a man's place
Tombs of evil everywhere
Demoniacs imprisoned there
Begging, pleading to be spared

Banished, amidst forgotten posts
Legion's ranks filled
With the world's outcast
Deployed to desperate regions of sand
Prepare for attack
Awaiting the command

Evil men turned into swine
By the hand of him divine
Forgiveness in an altered state
Miracles are to believe
Pigs all running to the sea
Evil dying one by one
People in the town are saved
Ask him to leave anyway
Sails away at their request

Fear of what you cannot understand
Is forcing you to play a hand
That doesn't coincide whit what
Your heart feels deep inside
This man who saved you from evil
And his nasty friends
Is told to leave, banished out

Never to return again
The trumpets sound. The dragons free
One from the land, one from the sea
The anarchist, false prophets three
Unholy family pretending to be a king
Though history there has been
A gathering of evil men
Who all could be the anarchist
Pretending to be right
That guide you to a promise land
And rule you with an iron hand
And seduce you into loving him
And believing he is God

Long ago in another time
Somewhere near Gadera line
Demons in a man's place
Tombs of evil everywhere
Demoniacs imprisoned there
Begging, pleading to be spared
Evil men turned into swine
By the hand of child divine
Mercy held for demons sake
Miracles are to believe
Pigs all jumping in the sea
Demons dying one by one
