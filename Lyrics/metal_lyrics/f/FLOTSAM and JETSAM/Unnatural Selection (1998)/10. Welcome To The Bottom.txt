Lived to live through a lie
Lived and lied to buy some time
Hit the bottom ready to shine
On this tattooed cross we'll die

Alone to question, wonder why
Welcome to the bottom of your life

Here before me I can see
Here at the bottom I'll stay 
I just couldn't leave here anyway

Black insides a lovely mess
This masked deception I detest
Forgive me father I have sinned
All alone welcome to the bottom again

Your soul hangs upon the line
Existence dares to decline

Here before me I can't see
Here at the bottom I'll stay
I just couldn't leave here anyway
Light becomes my enemy
My home an early grave
And I still won't leave here anyway

Here before me I can't see
Here at the bottom I'll stay
I just couldn't leave here anyway
Light becomes my enemy
My home an early grave
And I still won't leave here anyway
