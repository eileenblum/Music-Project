Experiment for the government, I hear they're paying well
I needed the money, all I have is my courage to sell
Innoculations for the benefit of all mankind
A human guinea pig, I've laid my life on the line
I didn't plan on this misery, this drastic change
Organ donor before my death, what a foolish risk
Had suspicions when they hooked the needle to my wrist
Felt the sickness as the fluid gushed beneath my flesh
My peeling skin turns green, at least I can pay the rent

Masochistic nausea I can't chase away
Transforming my life is fading away
Blood cells mutating in unnatural ways
Hair is receding, my skin turns to scales
Genetic imbalance of self-induced hell

Distort the tissue to create the strain
Biological warfare is their f*&amp;$#*g game
I've paid the price the naive accessory
Cash mutated, I am no longer me

From the labs out to the streets the virus strays
Transforming my life is fading away
Blood cells mutating in unnatural ways
Hair is receding, my skin turns to scales
Genetic imbalance from self-induced hell
No immunization, no antidote to sell
Genetic imbalance from self-induced hell
