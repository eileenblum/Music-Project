They say that mental deficiency
Is wind in your mind
And if that's true
Then I'm brewing hurricanes all of the time

There are not too many places
I can speak my mind
There are not too many people
Who would give me the time
There are not too many answers I can find
So I just start running

And when I come into the picture
There ain't nothing else you see
Just fear, anger and jealousy
Cause you can't be
You don't wanna be me
Well I'm not quite right in the head
And if you fuck with me
You wind up dead
There is no weathervane
To tell when I'm coming down
If you feel the calm
You'd better just start running

There are not too many places
I can speak my mind
There are not too many people
Who would give me the time
There are not too many answers I can find
So I just start running

Whenever I see a storm coming down
Every time that lightning hits the ground
A blizzard in the summertime
Don't let the pressure fog your mind

There are not too many places
I can speak my mind
There are not too many people
Who would give me the time
There are not too many answers I can find
So I just start running

Whenever I see a storm coming down
Every time that lightning hits the ground
A blizzard in the summertime
Don't let the pressure fog your mind

There are not too many places
I can speak my mind
There are not too many people
Who would give me the time
There are not too many answers I can find
So I just start running
