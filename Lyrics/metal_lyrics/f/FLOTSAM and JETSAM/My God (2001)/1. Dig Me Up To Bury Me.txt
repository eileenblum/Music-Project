I'm digging way in deeper
Way faster than ever before
I'm dug in way in deeper
Way deeper than ever before
I'm flying, I'm sky highing
I'm in pain but I'm not dying
I'm digging way in deeper
Way deeper than ever before

Dig me up
Dig me up to bury me
Dig me up, dig me up
Dig me up
Dig me up to bury me
Dig me up

I'm beating my own best time
Way faster than ever before
I'm digging way in deeper
Way deeper than ever before
With my eyes open real wide
I'll dig me up a place to hide
Digging way in deeper
Way deeper than ever before

Dig me up
Dig me up to bury me
Dig me up, dig me up
Dig me up
Dig me up to bury me
Dig me up, dig me deeper

Money taking, bone breaking
No lending, extreme spending
Stock broker, pot smoker
Wife beater, dope dealer
My head's bleeding, my heart's frozen
Way down deeper than ever before
Way down deeper than ever before
Way down deeper than ever before

Dig me up
Dig me up one more time
Dig me up, dig me up

Dig me up
Dig me up to bury me
Dig me up, dig, dig
Dig me up
Dig me up to bury me
Dig me up, dig me up

Money taking, bone breaking
No lending, extreme spending
Stock broker, pot smoker
Wife beater, dope dealer
My head's bleeding, my heart's frozen
Way down deeper than ever before
Way down deeper than ever before
Way down deeper than ever
