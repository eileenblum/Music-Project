You'd better hope your only choice is to die
Being watched awfully close by the camera eye
The name that you use may not be yours
But the time that you serve will be
So you pull out a gun without stopping to think
And now the tips of your fingers are all covered with ink
And now you know there's never gonna be a time
When you're not being watched by the camera eye

Always watching you
Knowing what you do
Always watching you
Camera eye
Always watching you
Knowing what you do
Always watching you
Camera eye

I hope you need that shirt real fuckin bad
The fifty dollar skirt with the trim in plaid
Cause everyone knows, everyone can see
That you think everything's yours for free
But the old lady next to you is not a shopper
A fifty year old undercover male cop
You try to give your spiel, try to run with a lie
But you've just been busted by the camera eye

Always watching you
Knowing what you do
Always watching you
Camera eye
Always watching you
Knowing what you do
Always watching you
Camera eye

Maybe once, maybe twice, maybe you'll be caught
They slap you on the wrist hoping you'll be taught
But the fact of the matter is you're a thief
And you got no morals and you got no beliefs
You're an addict, you're a druggie
You're a drunk and a boozer
To sum it all up you're a big fuckin loser
And now you know there's never gonna be a time
When you're not being watched by the camera eye

Always watching you
Knowing what you do
Always watching you
Camera eye
Always watching you
Knowing what you do
Always watching you
Camera eye
