I see you now
I see you clear
I've touched your heart
I've scarred your soul
As I go dancing through your mind

Learn to dance

No way

You think you're invisible
You think you've won
You felt your heart
Skip in the middle of a beat
As I go dancing through your mind

Learn to dance
No way

You feel me deep inside your soul
As I go dancing through your mind
You know some things you shouldn't know
As I go dancing through your mind
You feel the end is coming near
As I go dancing through your mind
You're living in a constant fear
Of me just dancing through your mind
