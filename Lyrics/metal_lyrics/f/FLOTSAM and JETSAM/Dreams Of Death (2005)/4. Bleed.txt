Knowledge alone is not what's consuming me
No one at home - even when I'm not asleep
Demons are chasing me
Knowing that I can't run
Teasing and taunting me
Round in my mind
Knowledge alone is not what's consuming
Bleed the mind
Drain to see what's inside
What will you find
Something you can't explain
Bleed the mind
Empty the thoughts from there
Asleep inside
Brain activity - rare
Demons are chasing me
Knowing that I can't run
Teasing and taunting me
Round in my mind
Bleed the mind
Until the head is turned
Search the soul - can't find morality
No one at home - lost deep inside my sleep
Search the soul - look past the hollow stare
Find my soul
Demons are chasing me
Knowing that I can't run
Teasing and taunting me
Round in my mind
Bleed the mind
Until the head is
Until the head is turned
