Waking from another nightmare
Itâs so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell
I can - see whatâs happening
I know - almost everything
I can tell - when Iâm imagining
Why canât I - remember anything?
Waking from another nightmare
Itâs so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell
Iâm told - Iâm a psycopath
????? - Iâll be in a paper ?????
Killing - somehow clears my mind
Willing - to do a little more each time
Waking from another nightmare
Itâs so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell
Never knowing if Iâm really in reality
Never can tell if I am still asleep
Never knowing if Iâm really in reality
Never can tell if I am still asleep
Never knowing if I need to - blame
Never to feel remorse or - shame
I never can remember what I do
I can't stop coming after you
Waking from another nightmare
Itâs so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell
Waking from another nightmare
Itâs so hard to tell
Dreams are turning real and there's a blood bath
Straight to hell
