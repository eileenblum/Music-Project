If you come to close
While I'm sleeping
Or host of a nightmare
Don't feed me the blame
You're there every night in my head
Right in my sight as I cut the skin
And lead you to shame
As we hold and make love
I slip on a glove
So I won't stain my hands
As I take you away
When I focus my brain
I see you in vain
I see you bathing in red
And I can't believe
Your killer is me
And I hit my knees
And start to cry
I keep running and hiding and crying
And falling and trying to get away
Screaming and yelling and calling for help
As you die in my arms once again
As I wake in a sweat
Thank God it hasn't happened yet
And I run to you
But you got to close
When I focus my brain
I see you in pain
I see you bathing in red
And I can't believe
Your killer is me
And I hit my knees
And start to cry
I keep running and hiding and crying
And falling and trying to get away
Screaming and yelling and calling for help
As you die in my arms once again
I keep running and hiding and crying
And falling and trying to get away
Screaming and yelling and calling for help
As your running and hiding
And trying to get away
Screaming and yelling and calling for help
As you die in my arms once again
