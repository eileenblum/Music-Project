I can see the writing in the sky
I can tell when someone's going to die
I can see the end is flying
I can tell when death is near
Parapsychic Paranoid
Parapsychic Paranoid
Parapsychic Paranoid
Parapsychic Paranoid
When I see things how I know when death will come
How can I be sure it's not just me?
Do I see a future or just a memory?
Do I see a future or just a memory?
It's a curse
It's a drug
A way of life a walk of shame
It's a torture
It's insane
And as I'm insane You're all dead
Parapsychic Paranoid
Parapsychic Paranoid
Parapsychic Paranoid
Parapsychic Paranoid
When I see things how I know when death will come
How can I be sure it's not just me?
Do I see a future or just a memory?
Do I see a future or just a memory?
