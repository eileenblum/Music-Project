Iâll bring back the light to you
Youâve been hiding for too long
Behind this fucking mask
It seems like its out of control
The shadows are taking over you
Take what you need and get away
When you look in the mirror
Tell me what do you see?
Youâre fucking different

Take away all of your tears
Take away all of your fears
Even when the night comes
The sun will rise again

Take away all of your tears
Take away all of your fears
Even when the night comes
The sun will rise again
The sun will rise again
Yeah, the sun will rise again

[Chorus:]
Iâll fight the night if you want me to
Iâll hold you close if you need me to
Just take my hand and leave this place
With me tonight

No matter how much you push me away
Youâll never see me giving up
I wonât leave you
No matter how much you push me away
I'll never fall down on my knees
I wonât leave you
Iâll never leave you
Iâll never leave you

[Chorus:]
Iâll fight the night if you want me to
Iâll hold you close if you need me to
Just take my hand and leave this place
With me tonight

[Solo]

When the night is gone
And the war has been won
Now itâs time to go
And hold your head down low
When the night is gone
And the war has been won
Now itâs time to go
And hold your head down low
When the night is gone
And the war has been won
Now itâs time to go
And hold your head down low
