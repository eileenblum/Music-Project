I know it's hard sometimes
but days come and they go
try to keep your eyes open
even in the darkest night
just a little spark
will guide your way
you can be anything you want
just break free from these chains

we all have to fight it every day
don't take your wings to fly away
face the truth and live again
stay with me and listen

[Chorus:]
this time you wont give up hope
just remember every tear you dropped
youâll never get rid of me as long as I'm alive
there is still light for us to find

the weight of the world is laying on your shoulders
youâll carry it as long as you exist
we all have to deal with this
you are not alone

we all have to fight it every day
don't take your wings to fly away
face the truth and live again
just fucking listen

[Chorus:]
this time you wont give up hope
just remember every tear you dropped
youâll never get rid of me as long as I'm alive
there is still light for us to find

your time has come
even after everything youâll never fall
donât fear the future light your past
become a legend, cause every day could be your last

just close your eyes and become the dream you were aiming for
you said you, you were ready to die
but tonight
you will stay alive
