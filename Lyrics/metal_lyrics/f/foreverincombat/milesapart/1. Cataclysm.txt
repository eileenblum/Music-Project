The sky is burning
The clouds turned into flames
I'm buried under the ashes
The water's rising
And the world is shaking
The world is shaking to the fucking ground

The earth will never be the same again
Our breed is dying every second
Apocalypse
Apocalypse

I will survive [3x]

From the top of the world
I will watch the stars falling down
I might be the chosen one
But I don't want to wear this fucking crown

I don't want to wear this crown

It's getting colder now in here
I'm feeling like I'm nearly dead
And I suppress all my tears

I'm made of glass
So I can't break here through the walls
So now I'm crashing through

The water's rising
There's no mercy for me
I tried to escape a thousand times
And I see the end of world is coming now

I am not afraid of what will happen next
I am not afraid
Dead

I will survive [4x]

It's getting colder now in here
I'm feeling like I'm nearly dead
And I suppress all my tears

I'm made of glass
So I can't break here through the walls
So now I'm crashing through

This is just happening because of you
This is not real
It's just in my fucking head

Apocalypse
