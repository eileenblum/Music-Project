As bowed heads sway to dissonant hymns sung in suffering
An endless stream of hearts lain bare, for all to see, stripped of the weight of living. Sacrifice over disarray - Consume the equilibrium

A howling geist beckons,
Guiding the weighted journey into the unknown
Flames lick violent winds whom shepherd the seed of discord
"Breath deep the aethyr" - I inhale all your vanity, all your wickedness, your worthless fucking ego!
As my lungs fill with your burning lies stained in deceit
I am your sacrifice, your kingdom, your spiritual asshole
And nothing remains; but a husk ravaged by every utterance of word bled with poison. "Belief; The death of reason..." - A union of words consumed by your chains

A silence drew slowly as I swallow the crawling shadows of eternity
Buried, and buried again, deep beneath the shades of night
And with each and every fear intact... Relentless, I suffer you all...
