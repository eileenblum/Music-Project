Seething nothingness...
Unspeakable words choked and stretched within the veils of infinity
A whisper, adorned in horror and silenced beguile
Imprisoned by shards of broken light
Coil and pierce the murk of my heart
Fleeting abysmal void, scarlet souls astray in ravenous oblivion
Yet carried in the graceful arms of a thousand burning stars

Encoffined...
Each word bound in unearthly, dissonant grace
Each soaring toll falls dreaded and virulent
All stained in the clasp of dreaded malign
And dancing in impenetrable cacophony

Cast upon the pale soil of the earth
Beneath pages of pale grey stone
Who lifts the sin of living?
There is only one god, only one true redeemer
And all men know his gift...
And life, Exhales it's last breath - As the earth inhales all death...
