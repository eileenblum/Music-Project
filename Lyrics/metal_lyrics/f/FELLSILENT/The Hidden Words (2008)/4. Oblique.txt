Take this bad attention
Eliminate, broken thoughts and crossed 
Intentions
Eliminate negativity.
This audition,
Will sever the ties between the strong and the weak.
Make the right choice and your failures oblique.
Loss-less, faultless,
Perfection is what, we'll achieve
Its not too late to find safety,
All we gotta do is focus on our dreams.
Run from your last, broken shield,
Seize this chance, for rapture.
Taste your breath, smoke filled lungs
Burning rooms with your body.
These roads will last a lifetime,
With your hopes in ruins,
Its not too late to find yourself,
New life intention.
The pulse of life is fading,
Smoke filled and hazy,
We will strive on,
Forwards in motion.
We wont die,
Without fighting for life,
Lost life, found fear,
Your intentions will surface and ruin.
Prepare yourself, next stepÂ
You've outdone yourself again,
Disolusion grows bigger with every step,
Understand that the path-is-yours,
Don't accept this if the flaws are your-own-mistakes
Take it back all again its not the way we want to be,
Its about making the most of what we have
Its not the way we like to do things here,
Taking back what we said in the past is part of life,
Its about finding fault in ourselves, and fixing them.
Because these are our problems,
Over and over and over and over and over,
Standards drop while, your plans fail,
We're goin down, theres no hope, For us now so, 
SAVE US.
With the hands of god wrapped round your neck,
You will drop down to your knees,
Just because,
I've become the sun,
Blinded by my light
Now I'm fucking sick
Cast it away then invite your final pawns of 
Revolt
Open lies that erupt fake smiles
You're blinded by my light
These roads will last a lifetime,
With your hopes in ruins,
Its not too late to find yourself,
New life intention.
The pulse of life is fading,
Smoke filled and hazy,
We will strive on,
Forwards in motion.
Take this bad attention
Eliminate, broken thoughts and crossed intentions
Eliminate negativity.
This audition,
Will sever the ties between the strong and the weak.
Make the right choice and your failures oblique.
As I fall into the centre,
Dodging crossfire, I remember why I'm here
Visions vague and faded,
Fallen host to us, the simple minded.
Weaken your hold, Disguard your soul! Take heed, control.
Fear nothing but your hatred,
Cast it all away. Left open minded,
Weaken your hold, Disguard your soul! Take heed, control
