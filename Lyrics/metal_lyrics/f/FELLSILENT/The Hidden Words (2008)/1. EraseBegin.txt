Don't act as if you don't know it.
Former life was insane.
Cast your mind back five years when moral thoughts were in frame.

All those years were in vane.
Cast down the shame.
Take away your decision.
Cast down the shame.

Fuck this ovation and your lies.
This fucking life's not for me.
Stop this.

Don't think you cross paths with your back turned to the darker side of the truth.
Stop thinking we can't see through your shit.

How's he going to say this, how's she going to take this.
I don't want to know about your pretense lost amongst your defense.
Time is going to pierce through your outer shell.

Show your lesser self, I won't wait to watch this unfold.
You wanted lust now all you got is her tears.

Its simple.
Don't ever lose sight of your true light.
Indecisive control freak and I can't take this kind of treatment.
Its not like I'm here for you in truth.
We are the poor without your honesty, our life means no more than this shit.

Focus your thoughts on your mission.
Be sure that your path way will always be clear in your mind.
Focus your thoughts on your mission.
Distract us from the realm of realism.

Your falling deeper. Your dreams are unheard.
I'll guide you, don't spread yourself too thin, grow taller.

Knowledge is your freedom.
From nothing take this into your mind.
This is life, forget all of what you know.
Now it's our time to reload.

Cross yourself for the price that you'll pay.
Divide the ties between your lies and this advice, that we advise has not worked.
So well for us so good luck and goodbye.

Its simple: don't ever fuck around.
Erase; begin.
