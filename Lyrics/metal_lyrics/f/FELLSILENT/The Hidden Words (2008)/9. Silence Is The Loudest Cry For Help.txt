To my friends who follow me, I warn you
The feel of a rebellion will distort your...
Views of integrity, your cold touch distrusts me
Take not my cold heart as your soul will find that
Rebellion has defaced it

Your eternal pit is my creation
Ascending onto your
Feared internal cry
Hear me, or hear nothing
I'll tell you how to fall from merciful hands
Rise up in spite of me
Tell you stories can't believe
Abandoned nothing to save you
All you should think are thoughts to enable me to hold your wrists

Forget all
Save yourselves
Freedoms not what you're used to
Your desires are distorting your dream
Your evil is not supposed to be
Take a page from my
Book of hidden words

To my friends who follow me, I warn you
The feel of a rebellion will distort your...
Views of integrity, your cold touch distrusts me
Take not my cold heart as your soul will find that

Close your eyes and feel undone
Close your fists and take a turn
Don't dwell on my feelings
Brandish my wrists and see
Close your eyes and tremble
Onto your knees
Take this chance to follow
My hidden words

Silence is the loudest cry for help
And just this once say...
Nothing, no-one can hold back
Merciful hands won't save us
