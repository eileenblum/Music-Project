Reveal to me,
Mortality,
This is the key,
Reality,
Gaze upon your horizon.
Immortal guidance required for sanity,
Happiness and defeat of oppression,
Burst out the cage,
That's holding,
Your mind out of place,
Life's lost again,
Your sanctuary is not the same.

Ignorant Truth,
Wont find you,
Gaze upon my oppression,
How strange your mind?

Your mind is open,
With burning ease,
This is a gift to our minds,
In this social tease.
Grasp my fallen treasure,
Roll it to your needs,
It's a gift to my imperishable,
Roll it to your needs and,

Magnify the cause,
Of veiled remorse.
There is no peace to be,
Lifeless desires are,
All our needs will be,
Place your cravings,
Immerse in the image,
Our dreams are falling to you.

Be not content with parodies,
Fear not the cycle Hypocrisy,
Conceal the vision eternally
I have become your needs.

Ignorant Truth,
Wont find you,
Gaze upon my oppression,
How strange your mind.

Burst out the cage,
That's holding,
Your mind out of place,
Life's lost again,
Your sanctuary is not the same!

Done it again,
A second, attempt,
To derive, life from our blood.
It's
Happened again,
Your life plan, fuck it,
Just burning, it all away
