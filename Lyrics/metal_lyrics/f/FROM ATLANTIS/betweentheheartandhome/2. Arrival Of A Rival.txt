Could this be just a memory
What have we done to
To deserve this
To deserve this

Could this be just the way we are
Or is this something else
Something we can't control
Anymore, anymore

Is this a sign
Of whats to become
To ask what caused this

When misery begins
This is what we're all afraid of
In the eye of the storm
When misery beings
This is what we're all afraid of
In the eye of the storm

To take us home
As if we were weightless
Swept us all away
As if we were nothing

Oh!

When misery begins
This is what we're all afraid of
In the eye of the storm
When misery begins
This is what we're all afraid of
In the eye of the storm
