Don't you dare tell me who I am
Or what I need to be
This is what I'm destined for
There's no saving you from me
Don't you dare think that you're
The only girl for me
This is not what we planned
You'll never be just what I need

So tell me dear what are your fears
Is it the dark that hides inside
Or is it the emptiness that resides inside your eyes

Move
This will be over
We can't go on

This will be over
We can't go on
Don't say forever
I won't be here for long
I won't be here for long
I won't be here for long

I'll never be the one
Who takes you by the hand
The one who guides you through
Who guides you to the end
I'll never be the one
Who takes you by the hand
The one who guides you through
Who guides you to the end

This will be over
We can't go on
Don't say forever
I won't be here for long
I won't be here for long
I won't be here for long

This will be over
We can't go on
Don't say forever
I won't be here for long
I won't be here for long

This will be over
We can't go on
Don't say forever
I won't be here for long
I won't be here for long
I won't be here for long
