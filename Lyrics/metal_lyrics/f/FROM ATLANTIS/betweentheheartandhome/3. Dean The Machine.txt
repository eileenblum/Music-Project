[feat. Landon Tewers of The Plot In You]

I'll never let you down

Pleading just give me one last chance
And you won't ever be looking back
Will I redeem myself
In the eyes of the rest

This whole world looks on
As they fall to their knee's
Their hearts will go on
Not knowing what they need

This life is yours to change
Become the savior that we need
This life is yours to change
Become the savior that we need
The savior that we need
The savior that we need

I will show them kindness
That was never shown to me
Brotherhood
