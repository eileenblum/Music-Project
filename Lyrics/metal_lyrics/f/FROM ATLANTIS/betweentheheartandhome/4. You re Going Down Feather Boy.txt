Push aside
Everything in your way
Don't let the past
Consume you

I'm not the only one
Everyone else can see
Your eyes are covered
And it's all because of me
I'm not the only one
Everyone else can see
Your eyes are covered
And it's all because of me

I am everything
Light in this world
You bring the dark
To my doorstep
Watch as I close this door
That you thought would be open
Watch as I close this door
That you thought would be open

All this time
Everything I've done
Was for you
Always for you
All this time
Everything I've done
Was for you
Always for you
All this time
Everything I've done
Was for you
Always for you
All this time
Everything I've done
Was for you
Always for you

I'm not the only one
Everyone else can see
Your eyes are covered
And it's all because of me
I'm not the only one
Everyone else can see
Your eyes are covered
And it's all because of me
I'm not the only one
Everyone else can see
Your eyes are covered
And it's all because of me

I'm not the only one

You've held me victim here
Once before
You only know how to live a life of lies
I'm falling in love without you
So let me go
Just let me go
