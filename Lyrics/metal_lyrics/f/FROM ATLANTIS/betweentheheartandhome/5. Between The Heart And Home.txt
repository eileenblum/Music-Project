My time is coming
And I can't help but wonder
My life without you
Just take my hand
I'll take you there

Take me away
I'm staying the same
This wasn't my time here
This wasn't my time
Take me away
I'm staying the same
(Staying the same)
This wasn't my time here
This wasn't my time

Your voice is taking me in
And I can't breathe
It's killing me
It's eating me alive
I've been away so long
I can't remember your face
I've been away too long
I've been away too long

Take me away
I'm staying the same
This wasn't my time here
This wasn't my time
Take me away
I'm staying the same
(Staying the same)
This wasn't my time here
This wasn't my time

I'm staying the same
Just take me away
This wasn't my time here
(This wasn't my time)
I'm staying the same
Just take me away
This wasn't my time here

I'm coming home
I'm finally where I belong
I'm coming home
