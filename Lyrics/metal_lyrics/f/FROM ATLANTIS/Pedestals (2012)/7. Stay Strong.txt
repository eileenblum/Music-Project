Were all just another line waiting to be crossed.
This misery and failure is always chasing me.
Just keep it up,
You got your heart in the right place,
And Iâd hate to see you down.
You canât break what has already been broken
My dreams will take me away
Iâm bigger then this, Iâm stronger then before.
Because Thereâs so much to live for.
I close my eyes and watch this whole world go away.
I force myself to wake up everyday.
You canât get me further down.
Can i turn these thoughts into actions?
Iâll turn this page, and find the future as a new chapter.
Tell me weâll be free.
I guess i should of held myself back.
Leave while youre ahead.
Translated our words with more depth.
I wont live to find meaning in you.
Well get past this, just take me home
I know things will get better
I need my life to go back to how it was then
Iâm trying to stay strong and get past this
But itâs so damn hardÂ 
Itâs so hard to stay strong
These days where I think it will get better,
But things always seem, they always seem to stay the same.
Iâm bigger then this, Iâm stronger then before.
Because Thereâs so much to live for.
I close my eyes and watch this whole world go away.
I force myself to wake up everyday.
You canât get me further down.
