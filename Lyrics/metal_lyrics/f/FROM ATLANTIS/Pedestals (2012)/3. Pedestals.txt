Overthought, and meaningless.
Youâve destroyed everything I thought was sacred.
Burn them, and sell whats left of them
Nothing is worth this,
and I hope you realize what youâve done.
You have stolen every bit of this.
Hold this in, youâre destroying this world.
I swear this is all on me.
and one day youâll see.
These pedestals you make,
they are no figure to be praised.
You put value in the wrong,
I cant bare these changes.
When will you pay for this?
Trade your heart for fame.
Trade your mind for a piece of heaven.
I put this too far away from me
Trade your mind for a piece of heaven,
Trade that heart for fame.
I cant bare to see these changes you put yourself through.
You put value in the wrong,
I cant bare these changes.
When will you pay for this?
Trade your heart for fame.
Trade your mind for a piece of heaven.
These pedestals, they are no figure to be praised.
There is no hope for this.
Pray for me.
I have found honor in the lowest of places.
Hold this in, youre destroying this world.
I swear this is all on me.
I will never see this light.
I sent myself here.
Itâs still prettyhard for me to understand how you can put your beliefs to such shame.
It gets harder to realize.
where we stand, I can never see the light.
One day youâll see these pedestals,
They are no figures to be praised.
Trade your mind for a piece of heaven,
Trade that heart for fame.
I cant bare to see these changes you put yourself through.
And I need to learn to walk away when things get down.
You get your head wrapped around all the wrong values.
I can feel your grip failing.
These voices are falling short.
Selling every part of me.
Everything we know is ending.
This world is dying.f
