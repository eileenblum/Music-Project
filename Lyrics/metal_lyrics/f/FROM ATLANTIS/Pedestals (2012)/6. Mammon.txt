Everything you knew is dead,
Dont hide yourself.
Waiting for your words.
I will take myself back.
I will take it all.
You call it memories,
I call it haunting.
Crawl your way out of this mess,
The mess that youâve created on your own.
I am not your god,
I am not here for you.
Cleansed my hands of all these crimes.
Falling back to the worthless cries.
Waiting for demons to take what is mine.
We are not the same.
Youâre so temping with those pretty words.
That body is a trap to your false intentions.
Such gentle lips for a dirty trick.
What have I become?
Never forgive.
You wont forget this.
I wont forget.
I will always remember.
Shelter yourself with a fake life,
Burning in your own hell.
Iâd rather die in this hole.
Iâd rather die alone
You call it memories,
I call it haunting.
Crawl your way out of this mess,
The mess that youâve created on your own.
I am not your god,
I am not here for you.
Cleansed my hands of all these crimes.
Falling back to the worthless cries.
Youâre so temping with those pretty words.
That body is a trap to your false intentions.
Such gentle lips for a dirty trick.
What have I become?
I keep thinking of my morals.
This isnât what I believe in,
Still I have so much regret.
Close the fucking door,
Close your mind.
I am searching for whats left of me.
This fear is spreading fast.
Donât try to follow me,
I am just a shot in the dark.
Is there something left for me?
We wonât find ourselves.
Never forgive.
You wont forget this.
I wont forget.
I will always remember.
Shelter yourself with a fake life,
Burning in your own hell.
Iâd rather die in this hole.
Iâd rather die alone
