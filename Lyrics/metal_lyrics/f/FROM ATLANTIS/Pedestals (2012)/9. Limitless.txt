Iâve never been so close to the bottom before
I never have held this for so long
But every time I lift my head up something always seem to bring,
Something always seems to bring it down
What do you expect from, a man with nothing left
I gave you everything but I guess it wasnât enough
You wanted attention over love and affection
I thought you were and it and I realized youâre not
You were the farthest from perfectionÂ 
I wish that I could learn to forgive you
We never really slowed it down before
Look at what we had, what we built
You threw it all and brushed it right off
I donât like it at bottom theres no room for forgivness now
I gave you everything but I guess it wasnât enough
You wanted attention over love and affection
I thought you were and it and I realized youâre not
You were the farthest from perfectionÂ 
I wish that I could learn to forgive you
What do you expect from, a man with nothing left
I wish that I could forgive you
