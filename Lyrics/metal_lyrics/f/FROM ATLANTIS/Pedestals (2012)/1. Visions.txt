This will not die.
I know where you stand.
I am not alone.
Iâve found the positions that you left us all in.
These traits arenât settling now.
Overwhelming by the second.
Passing by the day.
What do you stand for?
In the end, I have to know.
Iâm at my wits end, just bits away.
I will never see this world the same,
Iâm blinded by everything
You sent me to a place that I never knew.
And for once, itâs all that Iâm asking
For the time being, Iâll ask myself where I stand.
(I will never see this world the same,
After all I know)
Iâm starting to lose myself.
I swear, Iâve lost my mind
Is it worth building up to know Iâll just break you down.
I must be confusing this for something else.
These thoughts will haunt for years.
This is all too familiar.
This is all too fucking familiar.
Now Iâm questioning my motives.
Iâm swearing Iâve never sold myself like this.
Let downs and Delusions.
Passing by the day.
What do you stand for?
In the end, I have to know.
Iâm at my wits end, just bits away.
I will never see this world the same,
Iâm blinded by everything
You sent me to a place that I never knew.
And for once, itâs all that Iâm asking
For the time being, Iâll ask myself where I stand.
(I will never see this world the same, after all I know)
Iâm starting to lose myself.
I swear, Iâve lost my mind
Is it worth building up to know Iâll just break you down.
Theres no such thing as second chances,
So keep those hopes up high,
And your shame down low.
Stop making it harder to see.
I am not what I thought.
And nothing is what I thought it was.
Out into a fucked vision of nothing.
