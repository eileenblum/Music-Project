Washed up and serving life.Â 
Selling our youth line by line.
These nights are looming over my shoulder,
They wonât quit,
They wont quit until I am theirs.
Itâs the end, I can feel it in my veins.
Sending me back to a daze.
Claiming this is all a mistake.
Heaven denied my cries for help.
On our own until the grave, the soldier of misfortune.
Casted to the shadow of death.
Destroy every last hope.
It no longer lingers with me.
If I could do anything with these times,
I would make myself better.
I appologize for this.
Iâm starting to sink fast to the bottom, and lose all control again.
You can only go so far along with just getting by.
Itâs the end, I can feel it in my veins sending me back through time, to fall into this empty place.
I will need some good intentions
This poison will end me, yet iâm just fine.
Itâs not just a bite, itâs a death sentence.
Found a home in yourself.
Sheltered from the world.
Washed up and serving life.Â 
Selling our youth line by line.
These nights are looming over my shoulder,
They wonât quit,
They wonât quit until I am theirs.
Youâve trusted your senses.
They have failed you.
You have failed us.
Feed yourself to this pain you know.
Youâve done this all yourself,
Released by a skeleton key.
Dying off one by one.
Sealed by themselves.
We are left with this.
The path we lead is cursed.
The illusions we see are blurred.
Iâm starting to sink fast to the bottom,
And lose all control again.
You can only go so far along with just getting by.
Itâs the end, I can feel it in my veins
Sending me back through time to fall into this empty place.
I will need some good intentions.
