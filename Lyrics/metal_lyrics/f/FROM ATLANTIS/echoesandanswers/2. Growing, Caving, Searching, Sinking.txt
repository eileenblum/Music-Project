[feat. Ryan Neff of Miss May I]

[Intro:]
Winds in a room without a window.

[Verse:]
Sleep is ever fleeting.
My dreams are everlasting, i wake as the sun sleeps.
And I become alive (become alive)
Stuck to the confines of my mind (of my mind)

[Chorus (Ryan Neff):]
(Don't try to be something you're not)
Don't try to be something you're not!
With everything you had you should have fought.

[Verse 2:]
Never allowing a glimpse of light,
I found a reason for waking tonight,
And only time will tell!

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge (Ryan Neff lines 1 and 3):]
Find yourself and come back to reality! [x4]

[Verse 3 / Break:]
Gone and never again will it be the same,
Growing in a room with a low ceiling.
Caving the walls of my mind,
Searching for a way to stay the same.
Always Sinking, until I've reached the bottom!
