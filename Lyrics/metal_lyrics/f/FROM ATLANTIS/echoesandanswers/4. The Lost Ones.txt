[featuring Landon Tewers of The Plot In You]There's no need to bear my cross, but bear in mind
I've been restless for days, and there's no signs of slowing down
You're doing such a damn good job
Of keeping me awake at night
Cross my heart - hope to survive

I've been trying to accept myself
But the weight of the world keeps me restless at night
I keep praying that things turn around for me
I'm praying I don't lose myself

[Landon Tewers]
This bottle keeps me alive until I meet my end
This bottle keeps me alive until I meet my end

My knees are growing weak, yet our feet keep moving,

[Landon Tewers]
Pick up the pace now

Our hearts will beat as one but will we ever really come to our senses

Ill let it drag me down
So be it
Ill let it drag me to hell

[Landon Tewers]
I'm haunted by the thoughts of what I could have been

I've been trying to accept myself
But the weight of the world keeps me restless at night
I keep praying that things turn around for me
I'm praying I don't lose myself

My body's withering, my bones have turned to dust
With sunken eyes like ships we are the lost ones

Thanks to fezzng for sending track #4 lyrics.
