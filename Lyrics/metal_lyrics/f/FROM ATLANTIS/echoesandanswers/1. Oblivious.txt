[Intro:]
They won't know what it's like this time,
To feel a life so full of light,
Fading away in the wake of night.

[Verse 1:]
It's your time to shine, get on your feet.
Let the waves crash over your body,
Absorbing your everything,
But you'll never belong up above!

[Pre-Chorus:]
We'll break the surface, back to the world we know!
We'll break the surface, and you'll reap what you sew!

[Chorus:]
They won't know what it's like this time,
To feel a life so full of light,
Fading away in the wake of night.
They won't know how it feels to live,
Carrying a knife in hand,
Searching for a back to bury it.

[Verse 2:]
They won't know how it feels to live.
Is this the life you asked for?
Ask yourself, is this the life you wanted?
You don't know the things I've done,
You don't know the places I've been.
So judge me not, lest ye be judged.
You always learn and retain,
knowledge from others as you grow.

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Breakdown:]
You don't know me, you won't forget my name!
You won't forget my name!

[Chorus]
