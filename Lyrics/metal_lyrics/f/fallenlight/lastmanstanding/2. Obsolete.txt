Buried by time and dust i am
Hated forsaken for all time
Obsolete
Old and rusty
Obsolete
Simple and ugly
Damned in any life i am
Not to serve nor to please
Raised as risen dead i am
Walk the earth with the absence of light
I'll set my throne higher

Men who stand last:
Abenz: Amateur riff compiler, bass, rotten vocal on track 2.
MOTF: Monotonous drumming, vocal hell on track 1.

Recorded, mixed and mastered (as fast as possible) September 2010 at Avila studio Jogjakarta.
All done by Mr. Wisnu Jahat.
Words &amp; (he)artwork maimed and slaughtered by MOTF.
