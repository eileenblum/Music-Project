Millions of bastards live around us
Coward fears and weakness worldwide
Don't you think is there a hope?

Make distinctions, clear diferences
What's the hell just reading this lyrics?
Make then facts, clear and kill!!

Just sdee that:
No guts, No glory
No guts, No glory
No guts, No glory

I am really fucked to smell your fucked braveness
I am really fucked to heard the weak's word
I am really feed up to see your vulgarity
I am really bored to wait you come to face me

Can we face the indolence?
Can we opress these loser faces?
Why to live this subquality life?
Because they are fucking our way
That fucked shit
They always need the hipocrisy

If you doubt
Just come and see my throne
Honor prevails
Some heads must gonna roll
You must know
I'am the deserved king
One more target
Give me the conquering

Dont you know I'am inconquereable!
Dont you know I'am inconquereable!

If you doubt
Just come...

Dont you know...
Dont you know...
