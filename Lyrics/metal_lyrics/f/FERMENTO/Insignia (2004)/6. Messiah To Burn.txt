It was all poverty
Was not heat around
When dignity is expensive
Masses always need a messiah
Do you need some crimes?
To feel you like a god?
Despise the loosers
High-powered cleaning

We come to fight
To use long knives
And when there is no light
Anyone can jump to fire

March! March! March! March! March!
March! March! March! March! March!
They will pay our pain
To see the world so fake
Somebody fighted for a nation
Someone will fight for the blood

Was a race cleaning?
Was a wotan revenge?
Was a demon cumming
Over the wordl ass?

Wake up!

Every dogged is always ready to make a war
Every dogged is always ready to make a war
Every dogged is always ready to make a war
Every dogged is always ready to make a war

Bleed, bleed, bleed!
Bleed, bleed, bleed!
Bleed, bleed, bleed! Bleed, bleed, bleed!

When the power rises
Nobody can't stop the rifle

Bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed
Bleed, bleed, bleed
