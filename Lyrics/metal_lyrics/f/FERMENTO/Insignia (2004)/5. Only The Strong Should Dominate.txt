What's the meaning of life?
What's the meaning of life without my demons?
I feel the blood
I feel lava thought my eyes!
Is he really come?
The lord of bullets is really inside me!
Is he empty of souls?
The voice of the fake will be closed

Closed!!!

Nights, days, what's the time?
Something anonimous and expecting
I have been rewarded by my blood
Thousand demons screaming thought my skin!

There are so many races
Infraraces from infrasouls
If you dont feel the fire...
The fire from a hunger soul!

I see the light from thousand stars
I hit the cross that the men have to pray
I smell the burning wings from the skys
I am closed to my wings misanthropy

Come to the ninght
Where forest are so dark
Forget other
Inventions
We must believe
In our cruelty
Remember the invasions
