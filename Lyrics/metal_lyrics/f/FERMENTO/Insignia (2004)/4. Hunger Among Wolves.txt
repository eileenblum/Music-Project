From the night i can feel myselve reborning
just ask to that high moon who always reigned
Distorsionate visions from my soul, unconquerable
you, my flesh and possession, incandescent

Who can be the wolf?
Like a fucking saviour?
Is that really a fact?
I am my owm Messiah!

Own Messiahh!  Own Messiahh! Own Messiahh!

It's the hunger among wolves
that eats my own guts
It's the hunger among wolves
That find perdition or glory
It's the hunger among wolves
That crucify the weak!

Crucify! Crucify! Crucify!
The fake Messiahs!

I devote my own desire
I need preys to humilliate them
Put the masses in the right boxes
We are not all the fucking same!

Can we judgue that fucked scum?
(They are) Devoid!
Then we must be closed as fuck
(They are) Divided!

Burn down their world!
Burn down their world!
Built up our throne!!!
Burn down their world!
[x2]

What you think will change these days?
If they think you should suicide?
Stupid people live with us
Burn their flesh to make our light.

What i see?
For what the night was made for?
For what the night was made for?
For Burn!!

I feed up
Millions of sheeps
A full revenge
And rule the world!

At the latest hours
of the night
When the mortals sleep
warm and hide

World, world, down!

I am still the revengefull wolf
Do you remember that real song?
During these ages Iï¿½m still don't forgett
Like always. I'am in my love throne
To rise it and harden.
