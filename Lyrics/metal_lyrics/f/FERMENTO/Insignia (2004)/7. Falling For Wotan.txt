Night of red thunders
Latest days of the front
The bullets were my nails
The knife was my hope

There were thousand heads falling for Wotan
Was the arch of the triumph a dream in our heads?
You can't spit fire to stop the tigers
The drumming of the evil is gonna persist

Let me be cruel
Let me be cruel
Let me be cruel
Let me be cruel

It's a must for a warrior
Invade!

It's a call for the lone wold
Invade!
It's a need for the battle
Invade!
It's a must a warrior
Invade!

Fight for the honour!
Fight for the honour!
Fight for the honour!
Fight for the honour!

It's a must for a warrior
Invade!
It's a call form the lone wold
Invade!

Millions of bombs crushed to burst our balls
All effort is nothing to stop the dogs
Still I remember the tanks across
The fire was the song of our souls

Savege winds of mayhem
Dry blood for the angels
Every ceremony
Have it's price to pay

Living to get the iron cross
Too many infernos were to lived
From the hottest to the frost
Is it all fine to get our goal?

It's the dream, the cream, a blast of ferocity
Delight to fight, the battle of dreams
Icons of ardour, some flesh were gone
Chosen by the gods, to be their son
It's the dream, the cream, a blast of ferocity
Delight to fight, the battle of dreams
Icons of ardour, some flesh were gone

Returned to darkness
Returned to darkness

It's the force that lives in me
Give me all to make ny feast
Is this one the pure land?
Naice them fear our reality

It's the force that lives in me
Give me all to make ny feast
Is this one the pure land?
Naice them fear our reality

Come!
