We came from
The conquerors
We shall cross
The flames that always burns!

Just like in oblivion
Smashing the bones
Spit the weak
Cross of violence
Cross of violence

Yes, we will make them pay
We will make to do what we only we can do
Yes we will make them to feel pain
It's the mean that a real man must do

You can't join us
We are Insignia!
Nobody can defeat us
We are Insignia!

Everyday, Everyday, Everyday
Every, Every Everyday!

Will we make then the ritual?
And prove our bravery
Will you join to the ritual?
To smell this burned world

In the fire
From my soul
Just reconquer
For your guts!

Kill them
Fuck them
Mute them
All screaming
[x2]

Show we all
All the ways
[x2]

We need the fucking battle
We live the fucing warlust
