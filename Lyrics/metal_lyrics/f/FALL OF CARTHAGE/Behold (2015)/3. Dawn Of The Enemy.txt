Let the fucking games begin
Bring the foes right in
We're ready for the dawn of the enemy
Choose your weapon well
Or go straight to hell
This is your last chance, use it now

And then again...

You keep hiding from the call
You ignore the deamons calling
They set sail beneath the stars
Just in time to see you falling

You and me alone
The smell of boiling chrome
Unleash the beast inside yourself

Trust yourself and you will find
Your way to peace within

You kept hiding from the call
You ignored the demons calling
Trust yourself, believe in life
And everything will fall into its place

They set sail beneath the stars
Just in time to see you falling
You will see it's worth the fight
The darkest days are numbered

Let the fucking race begin
Bring the foes right in
We're ready for the dawn of the enemy
