This is for your body, this is for your mind
We'll collect the honey
Then everything here blows into nothing
We control your body, we control your mind
We'll fuck up your party
And everything just blows into nothingness

Necessitarianism

Here is to your daddy, here is to your mom
Bottoms up to your granny, tell everyone we came for the bluffing

We are the ones you looked for
Elevate a cabaret, we won't let you get astray
We're fueled with wrong decisions
Get 'em in the bag until they call the authorities
Witness the things we truly came here to do
When everything is torn to pieces we're through

Oh, we could really use a bottle or two

We're on it

Necessitarianism

The damage is done

We control your body, we control your mind
We'll collect your honey
And everything here blows into nothing
