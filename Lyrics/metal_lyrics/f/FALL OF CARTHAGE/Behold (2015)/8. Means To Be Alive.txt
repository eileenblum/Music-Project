What have, what have we come to
What have, what have we done

Now we are counting mistakes and each others flaws
Instead of supporting and lift what we're dreaming of
We wake up to gray days and paint black what is so bright
We're dying slowly just like...

Just like somebody in our dreams
Condemns the sorrow and dulls all the extremes
Just like somebody in our dreams
Takes our hand to follow and remember what it means

Oh, what it means to be alive, create a world of joy and harmony
Apart from what is pulling you and me
Down and underneath, down and underneath
This sore and bitter fainting reality

What have we done...

The diggin' inside won't succeed, the diggin' inside won't succeed
The diggin' inside will result in more depression
The diggin' inside won't succeed, the diggin' inside won't succeed
The diggin' inside will result in even more suffering

Just like somebody in our dreams
Condemns the sorrow and dulls all the extremes
Suffering
Just like somebody in our dreams
Takes our hand to follow and remember what it means
What it means

Remember what it means to be alive...
