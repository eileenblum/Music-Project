13 years later well-known demons beat me down the same
I dwell on die-hard disbelief and hide beyond the lie I have become

Because of all the fucking therapies that made it worse
And all the pills and meds that fixed nothing
Lost within the memories of days long dead
Dead but sleepless, sleepless since you're gone

As I see all the pretty flowers (that) decorate your grave
And when I'm talking to your brother 'bout the good old days
I can't hold back the steady grief, this recurring pain
Life is not bad, I must admit, but it's just not the same

Destructive thoughts, the ages win
I'm giving up, I'm giving in
Left with myself, this shit's devouring
And power-draining

Sick of the echoes inside
Recall memories twist and rewind, 'bove all
Leave them behind
Slowly dispatching the soul now
Spitting and throwing up gall
Loss predefined

One day we will meet again and talk it all over
Until then I will just try and hang in there, what else can I do

Sick of the echoes inside, that's all
Memories twist and rewind, let go
Leave them behind
Slowly dispatching the soul
In this personal war, spitting and throwing up gall
Loss predefined

(get things straight)

As I see all the pretty flowers (that) decorate your grave
And when I'm talking to your brother 'bout the good old days
I can't hold back the steady grief, this recurring pain
Life is not bad, I must admit, but it's just not the same
