Pain, disgust, degeneration

What you see?
A stranger backing out, leaving humanity blind
A crack whore soon to fall, breathe no more
This stranger left the course to walk without remorse

Oh, what's left?
A self-righteous life, amends for the wrong sense
Prevent from a first-hand-degeneration of skin and bones
And mind and everything, I'm done

What I'll be?
A winner breaking out leaving society stunned
A top-dog biting deep, see me score
This stranger left the course and brought the boat ashore

Oh, this self-righteous life will break me

Not gonna take this, no more
Degeneration
Can't it be forgotten now?
Degeneration
No room for doubtful chances
Degeneration
No more wasted days, wasted life
Degeneration
Caught in my thoughts
Degeneration
After all the years of suffocation
Degeneration
