Becoming more than nothing

Is it so? Is this everything life is offering?
Is it true? Is this happening?
Really happening?

If this is all then I'm considering
I'm becoming more and finally stop bothering

Becoming more than nothing

We're built to self-destruct and function for the profit of a
Misleading industry, we drop with no surprise
We're skilled to plan and manage over-complex situations
Yet our intentions to enhance are kept denied

We're drilled to swallow all the bullshit that they serve us daily
We're burning out unless we're fired, one by one

Oh, this ain't life, this is robbery
This isn't worth all the bothering, no

Exploring new horizons
Becoming more than nothing

Been down there one too many times
This warning is honestly serious
The morning we won't wake up breathing
There will be no last chance to start again

More than nothing
