Sit back, switch on, the comprehension is strong
The curtain fell, the confrontation's pounding, truth surrounding
Born free and open, criminal identities now (in)
A world torn for rage and something more malicious

Behold, betrayal
Allow yourself to disavow

Minute after minute there's endless gore
Can't take it anymore
Humiliation, the military
Religion-guided, far from rational
War, you're signing in
Kin extinction, this is operation descent
Doomed, doomed you'll go down
With the enemy's soul in its domination and it's on

Unless you...
Drop tradition, terminate
Drop religion, liberate
Your life is not, religion, tradition, fake

Shot dead, drop dead
(the throwback of a nation)
You're dead, shot dead
(dictation)
Shot dead, drop dead
(foul obligation)
You're dead, shot dead

Shot dead, drop dead
(mother earth, devastation)
You're dead, shot dead
Shot dead, drop dead
(limp generation)
You're dead, shot dead

Here you are right by yourself, realizing this one life you have
Embrace it, embrace yourself and live
