You suffer, such a stray
Scored again, one more fault
The night's gone to sleep, vale of tears
A strong impulse as you keep searching

Just hangin' in there again
Hangover, hang with seven jacks, a menace to myself
(something) balls have gone wild
Tankin' up since 1990, as I been (fucking it up)

Searching for something, searching
Something, searching

There should be no indifference, no fuckin' compromise
A menace to myself, I need to regain my life

Stop

Can't stop to pull the plug on me

I tried to do without for a hundred nights in a row now
Still tired and unhappy, nothing has changed

We suffer, such a stray
Scored again, one more fault
The day's gone to sleep, vale of tears
A strong impulse as we keep searching

Something

Just hangin' in there again
Hangover, hang with seven jacks, a menace to myself
Gonna toss more
Tankin' up since 1990, as I been searching for something

Searching

Unconscious, unstable
Hopelessly breathing my last breath
I'm leaving to regain my life
