All the centuries and all the memories
Of all the families on all the cemeteries

What is your source of inspiration?
What is your secret to find love within?

Lost generation, a million dreamers before you and me
Have taken their knowledge and wisdom to their graves
They're holding it forever to be lost
They've not done well

Time we're given on earth, wasted and forbidden wealth
So precious it needs some privilege
Some more true attention now, for the sake of our children's lives

What is your source of inspiration?
What is your secret to find love within?

With a minimum of self-esteem
It's so ravelling, challenging, discouraging
Questioning everything, start accepting
No one's unfailing

Imperfection
Born with it, deal with this imperfection (now)

Imperfection
There's nothing wrong with imperfection

And when you're buried with your dreams and secrets
Then you will take them all the way, no recreation
And when you're buried with your dreams and secrets
You'll keep them forever with your talents and fears

All the centuries
All the families
All the centuries
All the memories gone
