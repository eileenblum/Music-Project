Consciousness, reflection, consideration
Words we all have long condemned
And with the everyday over-stimulation we're exposed to
Our eyes became blind to the beauty and the concealed

We need to rely and focus upon the small things...
Upon the small things...
To make the large things count

Supplication and faith
Won't prevent from the greed dividing us all
Sadly this much is true
We are called upon to recollect and burn the riches down

Don't dance with the witches which ain't switchin' on, no
Burn the riches down, turn the fire on, bring the harvest home son Recollect yourself and clear your name
Before this world goes up in flames

Drop all the doubt, chop all strings
Rely upon the small things
Drop all the doubt, chop all strings
Build upon the small things

Upon the small things

Atop of the wastings, not much left here
Upon the small things, grow some value

Upon the small things

Consciousness, reflection and consideration
Words we all have long condemned
Upon the small things
