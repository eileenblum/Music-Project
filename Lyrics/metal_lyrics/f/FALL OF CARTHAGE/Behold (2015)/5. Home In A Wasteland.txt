Dishonor, rush and mocking will unmask the denier
On to deliver the secrets to the wind and fire

All the years we grew around it
Holding onto what we've founded
Shallow ground and draining quicksand
We're feeling at home in a wasteland

Destiny was lost and found here
With a melody so resounding

Hateful thoughts outspoken
This record is broken
With a melody so resounding
Complication abounding

Disregarding this retarding
But in fact we were crumbling long before
We can't fight it, just divide into none
Nothing's gonna be fine like before again

(no more disgrace, no more false hope)

Disintegration

Hold on
Enough is enough
When you're left to crawl with wounded knees
Enough is enough

Stop the hurting
Enough is enough
When you're left to freeze with a burning heart
Enough is enough

Enough is enough
Stop it
Enough is enough
