Trouble has been meant to be.
There's a guarantee for tragedy.
Harder than it used to be.
Oh, when you're only having
Less than nothing.

Put it down and
Turn it over and
It's (still) not enough yet.
Drowning all your worries in liquor
Only makes you sicker
Yeah-eeh-yeah

They don't listen to your story man
And they don't want your company.
They cover up their wicked plan
To take your everything, they're honestly dollarhungry.
Dollarhungry.
Uh.

They don't listen to your story man
And they don't want your company.

Harder than it used to be.
But at least there is a guarantee
For every single dollar slippin'
Through the hole in your pocket
When you seemed to lock it down.

They don't listen to your story man
And they don't want your company.
Cover up their wicked plan
To take your everything, they're honestly dollarhungry.

Dollarhungry.
