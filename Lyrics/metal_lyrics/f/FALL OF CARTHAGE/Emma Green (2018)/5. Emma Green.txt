Her name was Emma,
And well, nobody cared when she left,
No one noticed, no one was there,
No one noticed.

She was still a child
When her daddy dragged her down the stairways
To darkness.

At first she smiled
Shy and excited
And then he pulled down his pants.

No one cared - no one noticed,
No one cared - no one noticed.

Mama was upstairs watching "Leave it to Beaver"
What a brilliant deceiver.
Did she just see blood run down the holy cross?
Unaware of her greatest loss.

If you could see all the hooks and chains,
The sperm and blood stains.
Daddy and his friends left their marks
On a twelve year old,
It's so unbelievable.

She died young,
She died too young.

Emma, Emma.

No one cared - no one noticed.
No one cared - no one noticed.

She was just a teen
When some puppy found her lying face down in the green.
Not in this town you might think
But it just happens everywhere, believe me.

She died young,
She died too young.
No one was there to sing her to sleep
She died young
She died too young
No one was there for her,
No, no one noticed.

Tja...
Remember her
That late September when she left us
Lying on the green over broken glass.
The sun went down
For the last time.

No one cared,
No one noticed.
No one cared,
No one noticed.
Emma you died too young
Emma you died too young
Emma you died too young
Emma you died too young
Emma you died too young
Emma you died too young
Emma you died too young
