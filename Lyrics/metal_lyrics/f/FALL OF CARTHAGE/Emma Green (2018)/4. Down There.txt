Down there,
Down there,
Down there.

Remember when your dad made you feel life so painfully?
Your mom hid so anxiously.

Remember when the state fucked you oh so terribly?
Your counsel failed shamelessly.

Remember when your friend died so hopelessly?
The cops failed so miserably.

Remember when your last letter to your granny said
I miss you, yours faithfully.

Yours faithfully.
