Signs of corruption
Signs of corruption
Signs of corruption
Signs of theft.

See this system,
A dropped hand grenade.
A volcano,
A rabid rattlesnake.

Deny the truth,
Deny all the facts,
They'll be all withheld and banned.
Bow down to the demigod,
They bow down to you,
Down to you.

No, seriously,
You're a fucking scavenger,
Hiding from the public
So your deeds won't be revealed.
Looking away in the right moment,
Spreading lies like it ain't a thing.
Man, fuck you!
There needs to be justice.

Signs of corruption
Signs of corruption
Signs of corruption
Signs of theft.

Hear and listen,
Don't just catch that grenade.
That tornado,
That rabid rattlesnake.

S'there anyone good?
Anyone to stand strong?
When all cash has been gambled
And all hope has been gone.

Deny the truth,
Deny all,
Deny the truth,
Deny all,
Deny!
