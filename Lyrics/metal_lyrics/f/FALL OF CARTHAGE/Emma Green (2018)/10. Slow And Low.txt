[originally by Beastie Boys]Let it flow, let yourself go,
Slow and low that is the tempo.
Let it flow, let yourself go,
Slow and low that is the tempo.

It's never old school, all brand new,
So everybody catch the bugaloo flu.
Not like a fever not like a cold.
All the beats are clear the rhymes are bold.
Don't see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music? First things first.
First of all get off the wall,
It's time to party so have a ball.
We slowed it on down so get the hell up.
Like a volcano I'll erupt.
We got determination, bass and highs
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet.

So let it flow - let yourself go,
Slow and low - that is the tempo.
Let it flow - let yourself go,
Slow and low - that is the tempo.
It's the tempo.

I do not sing but I make a Def song.
You could live your whole life and I hope you live long.
On the Gong Show we won't get gonged,
We're FOC not Cheech and Chong.
Strong as an ox fresh out the box.
The crowd is so live they're coming in flocks.
And when we go on the crowd goes off
It's all music, genres suck!

It's the tempo.
Strong as an ox!
