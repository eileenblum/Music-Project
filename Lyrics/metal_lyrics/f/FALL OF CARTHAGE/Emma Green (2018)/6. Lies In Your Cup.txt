Reconsider,
Equalize,
Human nature.
Vote for life.

Hate is here to stay,
Truth is meant to die.
We'd better start to think and worry.

Unreason winning.
Unpacified.
I'm talking bout the lives of our children.

You make me shake my head in disbelief,
You make me raise my fist in anger.

They drop the lies,
The lies in your cup.
This ain't no medicine.
It only feeds your rage and
Anger.

They drop the lies,
The lies in your cup.
You sip their fairy tales.
Unless you use your rage and anger
Anger.

That anger. Anger.

Go.

You make me shake my head in disbelief.

Reconsider,
Equalize.
Human nature.
Vote for life.

Dear folks,
We're having a serious topic, you know.
Calm down and don't panic.

Downfall,
The downfall of everything.
Seems so near,
Downfall.

See what happened in Hamburg in July 2017.
The streets were burning.
G20-protesters burning cars of poor and unconcerned people.
Meaning to fight capitalism.
Breaking into an apple store, stealing iPhones and whatever.
Making selfies in front of the devastating mess.
Man, this looked like a fuckin' civil war,
Police telling people to stay at home.
Where's this leading to?
They were throwing flagstones onto the police from rooftops.
What the fuck?
And yet media is only showing and reporting one side of the story.
Is there another? Is this true? I'm worried.

This is so wrong,
This is so perfectly wrong.
And nothing but wrong.
