Does it really hurt you?
Does it bother you
More than me?
More than ever?

Does it really hurt?
Does it really bother you
More than ever?

There's no more lie to deny.
Well, game over, good-bye.
No guilty conscience after all.
It belongs to the past.

Don't you say my name,
It will dissolve in echoes.
Maybe a memory slips through
But you will shake it off and
And make it all right.

All compliments bounce off
And probably die.
No soul-stirring glancing the after-life.

Does it really hurt you ?
Does it bother you
More than me?
More than ever?

Is that you?
Turning your back on me in silence?
He he, wait.
We've only just started
And now you gon' quit like it's a fuckin' side job?
He he, you're a bad girl ain't ya?
Ain't you a bitch?
Surprise is
You're not gon' get away with it.
I swear I'll break that motherfuckas' neck
Right in front of you eyes.
I'll stick some of that shiny little scalpels
Right inside his black heart.
Ain't no fucking sunshine you know?
Give it up, give it up,
It's useless.

I see you suffer in pain and it's priceless!

Damn, for real though.
Can you feel my love now, can you?
Oh, you guys shivering?
I spit on you!
Bleh.
It's priceless
To see you cry!
It's priceless
It's priceless
It's priceless
It's priceless
It's priceless
It's priceless
It's priceless
It's priceless

Does it really hurt you?
Does it bother you?
More than me?
More than ever?

Does it really hurt?
Does it really bother you
More than ever?
More than ever?
