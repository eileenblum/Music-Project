They decide what you see
They decide what you know
Fake-news is the new shit
And you're running after it.

They decide what you think.
They decide what you believe.
Fictional bullshit.
And you're asking for it.

They decide what you see.
Decide what you know.
Decide what you believe.

They decide what you know.
Decide what you believe.
Subliminally or explicitly.

They gotta be kidding to put someone like him in this position.
Childish man with a bad hairdo and a dangerous mission.
Racist president.
Fake ass government.

Take time, think first, act wisely or shit gets worse.
Think fast, take them down.
All life's endangered
By this fake, fake ass government.

Can it get any worse?
He's a threat in the first place.
Tiny-hands and the alt-right.
And you're falling victim tonight.

Damn, will you ever wake up?
Will you see what the fuck
He's doing to not only your country but the
Whole fuckin' world.

They decide what you see.
Decide what you know.
Decide what you believe.

They gotta be kidding to put someone like him in this position.
Childish man with a bad hairdo and a dangerous mission.
Racist president.
Fake ass government.

Fuck the alt-right.
Fuck the alt-right.
Fuck the AFD.
