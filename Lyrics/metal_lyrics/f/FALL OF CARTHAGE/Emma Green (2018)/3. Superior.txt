Quit!
Preconception.
I for one give a shit.

What if I don't care, know-it-all?
Bout you and your close-minded view,
You feel ...

We don't fit into your fucked up stereotype,
We're not fulfilling your expectations
Of a young band surfacing,
What if we don't want to? (hey!)
What if we don't want to?
"Why not simply do deathcore, black metal or grind?" (hey, hey)
What if we don't care? But you're...

Shove your goddamn review
Up your ass (go)
On and on it goes, go
On and on, go
On and on it goes.
On and on.

Your truth (is) the whole truth - and nothing but the truth?
Your truth (is) the whole truth - and nothing but the truth?

Preconception,
All of us give a fuck.
What if we don't care, know-it-all?
About your empty words.

However, we're just happy doing our thing.
Does it really have to fit into something?
Who cares about your 5-star ratings?
Fuck trends invented,
Fuck your genres.
Media creates its heroes,
A world of fake and weirdos.
Why do you even take time to write it all?
Why don't you quit?

Superior mind.
