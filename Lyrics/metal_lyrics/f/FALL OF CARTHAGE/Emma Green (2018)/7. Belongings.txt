Taxes are my demise,
My downfall is simple.
Who could ever pay it all?
Not me, nor you, and that's the point..

Mass consumption,
So unreal.
Imbalance of wealth,

Half my income,
Half your tip
At a dinner with your yourself.

Take all my belongings.
Take all my money.
Take all my savings.

Take all my savings.

I spend my money on food and oil
To heat the children's rooms (yeah).
You spend your wealth on your cars
And your wife's next surgery.

Take all my belongings.
Take all my money.
Take all my savings.
Take em.

Mass consumption,
Burn the bills.
Imbalance of wealth,

Mass corruption,
No big deal.
So unreal.

Take all my belongings.
Take all my money.
Take all my savings.
Take all my savings.

Mass consumption,
Burn the bills.
Burn, burn.

Mass consumption,
Burn the bills.

My belongings,
Uah.
