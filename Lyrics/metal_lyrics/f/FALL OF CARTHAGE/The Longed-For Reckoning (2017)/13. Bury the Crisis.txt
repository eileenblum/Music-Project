Pondering silence for hours
Question the value of life
No matter what they say you believe
And you follow
I know you don't know
And you don't seem to care
It might be useless already but it's time to bury the crisis

Halfway from madness
Six steps from grace
You owe me all these fuckin' days

I lose my nerve 12 times a day
I'm a ticking time bomb
Hellbent on harmony and love
But anyway

I am out
This world is fucked
And so am I hereafter

All you haters out there comprehend
We need more light and laughter

So long, so long, so long
Short on cash for so long
Short on time for so long
Keep your bad news the day is mine
Bury the crisis

I am out
This world is fucked
And so am I hereafter

All you haters out there comprehend
We need more light and laughter

Bury the crisis
So long, so long, so long
Short on cash for so long
Short on time for so long
Keep your bad news the day is mine
Bury the crisis

Bury the crisis, bury the crisis
Crisis, crisis, crisis
Bury
