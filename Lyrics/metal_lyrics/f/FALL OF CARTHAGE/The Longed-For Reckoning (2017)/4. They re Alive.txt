They're alive, this ain't over, right?

Have we sent the corpses to hell, downwind or anywhere far away?

There is this ever-growing fear I'm trying to keep from moving in
I cannot see, I cannot hide, don't wanna lose again

There's no relief in sight, no soothing

All of us have have ended up in a fight we thought we'd never win
This is the time we're bringing in the longed-for reckoning

The answer is inside, you knew it

Destined to go through the barricades, to hell and back again
The blood, the rage, the well-known pain, I will not lose again

No, no, no

There's no relief in sight, you knew it

They're there, this ain't over, right?
They're alive, this ain't over, right?

There's no relief in sight, no soothing

All of us have ended up in a fight we thought we'd never win
This is the time we're bringing in the longed-for reckoning

The answer is inside, you knew it

I cannot quit
I can't resign
I will not lose again
I will not lose

They're alive, this ain't over, right?
Fight on
