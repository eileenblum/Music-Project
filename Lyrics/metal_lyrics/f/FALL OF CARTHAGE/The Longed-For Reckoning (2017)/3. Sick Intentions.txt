This torment, elusive wrath. Resistance, smothering
That discontent and abusiveness. The same victims, no, not again
What is done is done, is not alright - not again
But I am not the one to blame this time - not again
No excuse for the abuse - not again. Not again

Another lesson learned, for all the tables have been turned in vengeance

This growing relentlessness. A vicious ambitiousness
We're hiding ourselves from this potential aggressiveness

What is done is done, is not alright - not again
But I am not the one to blame this time - not again
No excuse for the abuse - not again. Not again. No

I am not the one. I'm not the one to raise my fuckin' fist to call attention
I am not the one. I'm not the one to raise my fuckin fist
It's not my fault - not again
It's not my fault - won't do it again - not again
I am not the one

Another lesson learned, for all the tables have been turned in vengeance

Sick intentions. Sick intentions. Sick intentions

I am not the one. I won't raise my fist
I am not the one. I won't raise my fist

All the nights you fell asleep bleeding and scarred
Huh... it's not my fault or is it?
Sometimes you need a little lesson to get things straight, right?

It's gonna be okay, baby, just don't provoke me again
Do what I say and everything's fine

Stop staring into that mirror
It's not my fault
Not my fault
Not my fault
Or is it?
