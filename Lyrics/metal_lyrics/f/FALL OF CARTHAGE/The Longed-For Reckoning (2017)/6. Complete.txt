Breathe in, breathe out, slowly

You should see the world through my eyes

Give it a chance now, make me complete
Hand me a gun or a life I believe in

Oh, I will wait if you ask me to
But I won't if you damn me
God, if you'd only see through my eyes

You should see through my eyes

Oh I will wait if you ask me to, but I won't if you damn me
God, you should see the world through my eyes
