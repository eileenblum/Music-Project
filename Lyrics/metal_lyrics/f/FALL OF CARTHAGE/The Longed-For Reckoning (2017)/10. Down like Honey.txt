Life with a broken backbone
Hard as it gets
Playing the role of a sad wimp
I'm done with that

Deliver me from well-known evil
So I can live as good as I can

Make a guess
Take a look
What the fuck
Whadda you got
What do you have
In the end?

Oh can you see the sun pours down like, down like
Say can you see the sun pour down like honey

Make a guess
Take a look
What the fuck
Whadda you got
What do you have
In the end?

Life with a broken backbone
Hard as it gets

Playing the role of a sad wimp
I'm done with that

Deliver me from well-known evil
So I can live as good as I can
