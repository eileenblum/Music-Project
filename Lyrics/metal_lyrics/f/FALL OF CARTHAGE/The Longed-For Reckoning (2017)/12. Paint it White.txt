Respect is gone
You can fool your stupid clients but you won't play games with my kin
Respect is gone

You - you're one of them
You're faking a smile when we meet so you don't have to be real
You - fuckin' bastard, quit counting on me when you bleed for my word is the last seal

You feel more love for the dollar than you feel for your friends
You feel more love for the dollar than you feel for your friends

I learned the hard way who's a friend and who is not
I learned the hard way how people treat their own flesh and blood

Foul
Paint it white - paint it, your blackened soul
Paint it white - come on, try to hide it
Paint it white - but you will never regret, your soul is too low
Paint it white

Paint it white - your rotting heart and soul
Paint it white - hiding your black tooth
Paint it white - it still shines through
Paint it white

Let's be real this time
I fuckin hate you
You better stay away
You... you ruined our friendship
I don't wanna see you again

And in this case you know respect isn't meant to owned

I learned the hard way who's a friend and who is not
I learned the hard way how people treat their own flesh and blood

Respect is gone
Respect is gone

Foul
Paint it white - paint it, your blackened soul
Paint it white - come on, try to hide it
Paint it white - but you will never regret, your soul is too low
Paint it white

Paint it white - your rotting heart and soul
Paint it white - hiding your black tooth
Paint it white - it still shines through
Paint it white

You won't play your games with my kin
