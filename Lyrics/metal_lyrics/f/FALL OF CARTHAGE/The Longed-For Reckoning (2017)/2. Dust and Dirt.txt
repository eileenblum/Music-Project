Given a year or two in the prison of your own mind
How do you find a way out and keep away from growing blind?
Dropping a tear or two on this aging skin of mine
How come our souls outmeasure the scales of space and time?

Among the memories the motherfuckin' phantasies arise and prevail

Whatever happened to your resolutions?
You'll find them buried in a mountain of dust and dirt, you will

Wallpapers of horror, rotten and torn
Right on the inside of my head
I need to get rid of the patterns
Peel them off, peel them off

After a beer or two filthy ornaments look nice
Damn, they keep reflecting inside of my head
Every night, every day, any time, anywhere
And so on
And so on
And with that there'll be damage when nothing is done
Let's tear it down now

Among the memories the motherfuckin phantasies arise and prevail

Among the memories the motherfuckin phantasies arise and prevail

Wallpapers of horror
Pasted inside my head
I need to get fuckin' rid of this sticky shit for good
It's disgusting

Wallpapers of horror
Rotten and torn
Right on the inside of my head
I need to get rid of the patterns
Peel them off, peel them off
