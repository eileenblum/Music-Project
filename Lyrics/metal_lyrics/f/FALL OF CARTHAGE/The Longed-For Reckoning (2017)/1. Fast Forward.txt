Count the many things I've fucked up
How many things I've come to miss
I, I felt so fuckin' worthless but I've done nothing I regret

I'm sick of this shit for more than a lifetime now

Fast forward
Fast forward
I'm sick of your blablabla
(wanna wake up)

Did you really care? Nothing that I've done has made you stay
Even though it felt sufficient. No offense but in this case "nothing" means everything
And that's sort of indifferent

Fast forward
Bring your shit up, I'm so impatient
Fast forward, all right
Fast forward, pause, play, sort of indifferent
Fast forward, ah

It's always been bugging me night and day

'Cause I'll bring it back, vitality and all that
This is all 'cause I can't tell right from wrong
I am so impatient. Pause, play, fast forward
God damn right!

Fast forward, right
Fast forward, right

I'm sick of this shit for more than a lifetime now
It's always been bugging me, night and day and all I could do is ignore you
You should stop the shit
I'm waiting for relief on what I am craving for

Pause, play, fast forward
