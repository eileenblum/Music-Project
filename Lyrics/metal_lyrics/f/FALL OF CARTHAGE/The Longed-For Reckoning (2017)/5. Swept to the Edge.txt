You'll break. Take all the empty words that you spoke, you never meant motherfucker go burn that lie down
You'll break. Take all the promises you made, lost with our future. You burned it down
With every breath, with every step you take, more or less you'll break
You'll break. Take all the empty words that you spoke, you never meant motherfucker go burn that lie down
You'll break. Take all the promises you made, lost with our future. You burned it down

Swing the battle axe, swing it again, feel the burden, the weight on your shoulders grow
Live for the gain, die being haunted by all the lives you sold

Can you, will you, would you, should you, could you really shake them off your mind?
Can you, will you, would you, should you, could you really axe those staying on their grind?

For all the promises and all the hands you shake you'll break

Swing the battle axe, swing it again, feel the burden, the weight on your shoulders grow
Live for the gain, die being haunted by all the lives you sold

Can you, will you, would you, should you, could you really shake them off your mind?
Can you, will you, would you, should you, could you really axe those staying on their grind?

Take all the empty words that you spoke, you never meant motherfucker go burn that lie down
Take all the promises you made, fucked with our future. You burned it down

With all the lies you shape we'll be swept to the edge
No no no

Fuck this game 'cause this pay isn't worth the pain
This one thing we're taught: our time has come
With that odd system with that we're sought out, time has come

The golden crown you're flaunting everyday will be swept to the edge
With every breath, with every step you take, more and more you'll break
The crown you're sporting everyday will break

Fuck you!
