With every step I'm moving forward it shows, this ain't no progress, this is a growing burden
As we're throwing every bond against the wall, like the immiscible retain their sole state
Another bone of contention at the hand of a lie
Or it's the scorn you can not deny?
I'll be silent now

Always incapable. And that is so illogical
And for the soul to save, it all melts in our eyes

For a second I was fine, I was fine
For a second I was fine
One thing's certain: I'll unwind
For a second I was fine
One thing's certain: I'll unwind

Another bone of contention at the hand of a lie
Or it's the scorn you can not deny?
I'll be silent now

Always incapable. And that is so illogical
And for the soul to save, it all melts in our eyes

For a second I was fine
For a second I was fine
One thing's certain: I'll unwind
For a second I was fine
One thing's certain: I'll unwind
