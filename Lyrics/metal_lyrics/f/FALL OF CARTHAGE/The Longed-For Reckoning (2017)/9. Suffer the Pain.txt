Tap the sin
Hold the sentiment
Burning the disarray
Cut the stem
Before teen turns to man
Conjure up a hurricane

You strangle those you breathe the life into
No matter the cost nor the size

Coexistence, the impossible dream yet I can't drop the thought

Soften the pain, bitch
Hey, what's up will you suffer the pain, bitch
Will you soften or suffer the pain, bitch
Will you soften or suffer the pain for me
Step the fuck out my face

Soften the pain, whore
Will you suffer or soften the pain, whore
Will you suffer or soften the pain, whore
Will you suffer or soften the pain, the pain

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Distance within
Old and withering
Burnt into disarray
Unfocusing
Time to choose your fate
The minor or the sovereign

Get out, get outta my...
Step back, step outta my...
The pain

Suffer the pain
Soften, will you suffer the pain for me
Soften, soften
Will you soften the pain, the pain
Soften the pain
