Never will he conquer the urge to take, to kill
Never will you get to submerge, you'll surrender
Theodore is serving some pain, he's coming, he's here
Bringing giant rusty knifes and his brain disorder

Bringing rusty knifes with him and all that he is leaving is
Dirty sheets and a blood soaked sky

Blood soaked sky
Your time has come
He's by your side now
And all that he wants
Is attention and being the one they look up to and
Return to. Return to the life that he's always wanted to live
In his dreams
And it happened he's damned to
Slay you 'cause his brain tells him to

'Cause his brain tells him so

Taking regardless
Killing regardless
'Cause his brain tells him

"Make your mother proud and kill!"

He takes the life you run from
Black December
You'll add to his collection
Black December

He's bringing darkness for some
Black December
Alleged innocent pale white scum
Black December
Say good bye

Never will he conquer the urge to take, to kill
Never will you get to submerge you will surrender

You best not tease him 'cause he's ruthless
Don't trust his blue eyes they've deceived so many
So many
