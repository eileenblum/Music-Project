It's a turning point. It's a turning point
The love. The sacrifice, all in vain
The mind, the soul, the heart, the pain
The mind, the soul, the heart, the pain

How do you sleep at night?
Put your head to rest, pretending we're alright

But no, this is simply the worst thing that happened to me
And so (I) lay the cards on the table, shuffle and deal them
For a new life
A new life - a new life
My new life

The love, the sacrifice, in vain
The mind, the soul, the heart, the pain
The love, the sacrifice, in vain

Where do you sleep tonight?
Rolling in the deep
As if it was alright

Hey, do you really mean to go?
I'm losing almost everything
But no
This is probably the best thing that happened to me
And so I bury the old me and arise for a better
A new life. A new life. A new life. My new life
My new life

The mind, the soul, the heart, the pain
The love, the sacrifice, in vain
The love, the sacrifice, in vain

It's a turning point, change is long overdue
Take the chance to save yourself. It's up to you
I trust in you!

I trust in you
It's a turning point
Take the chance to save yourself
Change is long overdue
It's a turning point
I trust in you!
