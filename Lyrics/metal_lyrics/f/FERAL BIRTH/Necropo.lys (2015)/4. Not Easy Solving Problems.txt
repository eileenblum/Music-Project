[Music:Vestramater; words: Morelli]

Ain't it easy for you
To leave me now?
Was it worth to fuck it all
With him?
Where have I been at?
Guess you should of known
Better than to keep asking me
All along with you
All along with him
All our nights have faded away...
Who's going to retort that

Cigarette smoke won't hide you from the truth
I'm going away
He's staring at me while you're blowing him in the booth
I'll leave you behind
Problems be problems when there's a solution
But you'll pull the wool I've got no resolution

Ain't it easy for him
To work it out?
Was it worth to fuck it all upâ
What?
What have I been up?
Guess you should of known
Better than to walk out on me
All along with me
All night long with him
All my days have faded away...
Who's going to deny that

Cigarette smoke will not shield me from you
I'm going away
You're screwing your face up at us from the tube
I'll leave you behind
Business be business when brought to conclusion
But you'll pull the wool you got sick of reclusion

C'mon!
"Don't you tell me
You are happy
If I'm happy
Ain't that way!
Don't you ask me
What it cost me
To be happy
Once again

At my back: hacked, racked, and sacked
Solving problems won't be solving, anyway...

Ain't it easier now?
Ain't it better now?
Ain't it worthier now
For us to
Keep on telling lies?
Guess we should of known
Better than to go break the chains
All alone with me
All alone with him
All my hope's been fading away...
Who's going to defy the

Truth behind Ray-Ban you wear to protect
I'm going away
Your eyes from the sun, that it may not detect
I'll leave you behind
Proofs got to be proofs, only I'm too confounded
So please kill me now, lest I live on to find out

Cigarette smoke failed to just hide the two
I'm going away
Of us from ourselves, either we're green or blue
I'll leave you behind...
Problems be problems when there's a solution
I see I've been lacking in male resolution
Problems be problems when, fuck, you can solve 'em
I'm going away
Still we'll pull the wool it is not us: it's them
I'll take you with me...
Three on fours? Two for one? You and weâ whole and part?
Will we ever learn we two can't stand apart?

Ain't it easy now?
