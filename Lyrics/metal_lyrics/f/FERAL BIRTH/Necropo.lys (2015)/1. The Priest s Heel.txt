[Music: Morelli/Peterlin; words: Ferrarese/Vestramater]

Sin after sin, fist after fist
My mind is blinded in alcoholic mist.
Breakin' the laws,wearing these rings
Wandering churches and clerical voyeurism

She's spankin' her butt..
Laying on my thigh..
She's whipping my back..
And we're necking meanwhile..

Guilty pleasures of 
An high heeled priest

Dual pretending,greedy perversions
Twice as exiting,lustful possessions
Boredom evading,painful obsessions
Facing my void against my faith

She's screaming again..
And she's moaning aside..
Avenging my pain..
Their pride in the mud..

Guilty pleasures of 
An high heeled priest

Greedy perversions..
Painful obsessions..
Lustful possessions..
Please rape my...

Disease!

Asepticâ¦ emotion
Blood-bedewedâ¦ intentions
Primevalâ¦ dimensions
Ravenous... as the beast!

Once I believed
So proud of myself
Hiding in shadows
I envied the arch-fiend

Guilty pleasures
Of an high heeled priest

Sin after sin, cunt after cunt
My cock is moisted in alcoholic mist
Breaking the laws,wearing these chains
Wandering shrines and clerical fetish

Staring the mirror
Zeus's eye upon us
Feasting with Meanads
In laocoontic entanglement 

Guilty pleasures of 
An high heeled priest

Once I believed.
So proud of myself.
Hiding in shadows.
I envied the arch-fiend.

Ravenous as the... 

...beast!

High-heeled priest!
