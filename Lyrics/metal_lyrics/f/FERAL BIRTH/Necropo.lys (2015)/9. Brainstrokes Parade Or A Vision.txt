[Music: Peterlin/Morelli; words: Morelli) ]

Take me to the seventh level, get me higher
Some time soon
We'll be bound to severânever!âthirst and hunger
This monsoon
Ain't unlike a one-way ticket to a snow-blind hell
A path to beat, the beat of wrath, a disenchanted spell
Take me to the next dimension, push the pedal
We be two
Our time is soon to comeâalas!âthe world will have been
Gone, too
No sooner have we loved than we are doomed to fall and part
But as soon as twain stars collide the womb of life begets one heart!

Plaster
Molten alabaster
Searing frost hereafter
...the tragedy of our race
Menstrual
Feral-born a vestal
Body-soul grand nuptials
...a marriage falls in place
Caster
Meltdown fireblaster
Freezing heat thereafter
...the lineage bears her face
Festal
Coitus-borne, material
Unworldly and supernal

We'd parted for too long a time; through time I crossed vast
Midnight lands wherein shadows dogging me would cut thy figure
Ne'er could they succeed in cheating me; nor did I ever yield
To them haunting succubiâfie!âcraving for the sword I wield
The heat, the sweat, the blood, the tearsâthe fear of being
One with the world: I'd curl and hide; in wait I lied, but at one
Joint point out of the deepest blue, accrued, I stumbled on a spot
The coordinates of which matched with the boundaries of my lot

Plaster
Molten alabaster
Searing frost hereafter
...the tragedy of our race
Menstrual
Feral-born a vestal
Body-soul grand nuptials
...a marriage falls in place
Caster
Meltdown fireblaster
Freezing heat thereafter
...the lineage bears her face
Festal
Coitus-borne, material
Unworldly and supernal

We took to through six levels, rebel lovers
Time and non-time
And though non-places were our place, we built it out of our prime
The one-way track was such only because we'd been two since
The very first time we had crossed each otherâprincess at her prince!
"Achtung! Till the seventh heaven, fools or rulers be warned!
The rules and bonds that made us slavesâbold stave?âthey were our own..."
So much have we been throughâout!âwe are now cast-offs in love
As Adam-naked as in bed, in trance but consciously above!

Conundrums warp my mind
A labyrinth of times
Floor drums corrupt my ears
A maze wound-up in fears

Our brain and heart unite
When day and dream collide
We left this world in seizure
From love and white-stained azure

Nexus
Plexus
Sexual daze
Mythical
Waxing lyrical
To get lost in such Haze
Dolores
Flores
Sensual grace
Aerial
Imperial

â¦a slight thrill in her face.
