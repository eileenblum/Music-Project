[Music: Peterlin/Morelli; words: Vestramater]

I am watching you dance
I am watching you bend
I feel you,I bite you
But I'm far away from here.

Fast forward
A sense of urgency
To purge this sense
of impurity

Oh, but!
Human needs deserve
filthy human methods
and hypocrisy

I wish that all could
come to an end soon
I feel sorry but
I'll spread you as a wet bloom!

I am watching you dance
I am watching you bend
I feel you,I bite you
But I'm far away from here.

Lying and lying
Just to see you screaming 
and crying

"Fill my void!"
She said
I deny and regret!
"Come,ravish this womb!"
will you feel better?

I just wish that you could
drown and drown soon
This is a gloomy swamp
I come and join in that pool!

I am watching you bend
I am watching you come
I feel you,but watch me: 
I am far away from here!

"There's
No deepest fantasy
But..."

I am watching you bend
I am watching you come
I feel you,but watch me: 
I only wish she was here..
Instead of you!
