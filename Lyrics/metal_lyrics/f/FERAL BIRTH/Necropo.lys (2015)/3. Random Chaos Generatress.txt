"Ah!â
Ah-ah!
Pop!â
Pop-up!
Sex!â
Sex-sex!
Pain!â
Pain-pain!"

Come o'er, down to my place
Show me to a better world
Come o'er, take my hand now
Come above unto me, girl
Let us be making love
Anon the room will burn in flames
And the fire will consume us
But the ash shall bear our names

Come o'er, lover, soulmate
Show me to a better place
For the secrets held beyond this life
Are written in thy face

Get-A-Way. Give way. Away
Give vent to a sexual dirge
Slay all my loversâMiss Tress, princess
Random Chaos Generatress
Tear-A-Way. Betray. Ban-Ray
Raise us a sexual surge
Erase my hopeâI just can't cope
Spearhead my war's distress!

"Spearhead my soul's distress..."

Come o'er, hover, turn the screw
Release the bats and swerve
Come o'er, kiss my lips now
Stay with me forevermore
Let us be making love
Anew the world will go primaeval
And the bare land will engorge us
But the bones shall bear our novel

Come o'er, lover, soulmate
Let us side with mating swans
That the very twilight o' this age
Will be our virgin dawn

Get-A-Way. Give way. Away
Give vent to a sexual dirge
Slay all my loversâMiss Tress, princess
Random Chaos Generatress
Tear-A-Way. Betray. Ban-Ray
Raise us a sexual surge
Erase my hopeâI just can't cope
Spearhead my war's distress!

"Spearhead my soul's distress..."

"Ah!â
Ah-ah!
Pop!â
Pop-up!
Sex!â
Sex-sex!
Pain!â
PAin-pain!"

GeT-a-way. Give way. Away
Give vent to a sexual dirge
Slay all my loversâMiss Tress, princess
Random Chaos Generatress
Tear-A-Way. Betray. Ban-Ray
Raise us a sexual surge
Erase my hopeâI just can't cope
Spearhead my war's distress!

Get-a-way. Give way. Away
Give vent to a sexual dirge
Slay all my loversâMiss Tress, princess
Random Chaos Generatress
Tear-A-Way. Betray. Ban-Ray
Raise us a sexual surge
Erase my hopeâI just can't cope
Spearhead my soul's distress!

Eradicate the rotten root of my very uselessness
Spay my long-dried and fruitless seed
Arouse my yearning, thirst, and creed
Make me fertile, and worthwhile
On and on.
