[Music: Peterlin/Morelli; words: Morelli]

As dreams are not unlike sea waves
So love ain't whom one might believe
Them vanishing at dawn, him leaving no trace
Except the spot for which we grieve
Are weâthe dreamers, the loversâfor real?
Are dreams and love things o' this earth?
Is there a point in setting the seal
When a dream cracks under and love chides stillbirth?

I need a killer application

As fell sea waves gather white foam
So blinding faith may well deceive
What use is it to wail and moan
When we had better stand tall and live?

I yearn for killer applications

Go!

"...a Ghost in Translation is peering through the fog
As we, like wolves, venture sober in the woods
Excitement stirs our thick black hairs
So pure, ne'er did life smell this good
The city's not too far away
We stay on point amidst the mist
Our teeth are ready for the prey
We won't be needing to insist

"This way!"
A voice from near-behind
Leaves us no choice but to turn around
A daze... A haze... A reverie...
Wide silver gates onto a new playground..."

Dreams be for lovers, love be for dreamers
But is it grief the price to pay?
We'll slaughter the gossip to feed the rumour
And never stop craving, anyway!

Dreams are the key to
Lovers nation

As we are not unlike sea waves
So life is more than one might think
What secrets held beyond the grave?
What is the greatest o' great things?

Love is the killer application.

The killer application!
