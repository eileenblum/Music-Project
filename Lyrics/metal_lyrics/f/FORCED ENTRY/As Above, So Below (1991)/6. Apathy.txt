They speak in tongues
But I fear unmistakeable wrongs
Wtiness dulness
Full &amp; complete
Madness elite
Told that it's calm
But world shrieks alarm
Struggle to wake
Generation of lack
Embracing the slack
Apathy won't shake

APATHY

You could care less
Possessions caress
Caring for self
Wallow in wealth
Starving your own
Fields go unsewn
Issues unaddressed
Minds dispossessed

APATHY

Confusion an excuse
Waking hours few
Disown fellow men
Put down in pen
Actionless stalemate
Multitudes disgrace
Believe in limitation
Drawn to expiration

APATHY!
