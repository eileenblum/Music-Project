Staring blankly in reclusion
Heaving crippled sigh, disillusioned
I saw the look inside your eyes
Tried to smile with dignity
Filled my head with useless lies
Incapable of humanity

I'd look up to you
With pride &amp; respect
Then turn away reflecting pain
Breeding contempt
I hear you laughing in your head
When you are right &amp; I am wrong
Degradation never ceased
I've suffered so long...

What have I done
To deserve this?
It doesn't matter
For society will pay
