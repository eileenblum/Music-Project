Soaking in need
Fear mighty &amp; strong
Tensions weights heavy
Precious safety, I long
Alone in a sea of fear
Unextinguishable feeling arise
Unable to repel, there can be no,
Compromise

Reluctant reality - smashes illusion
Awaken true vision of insanity
Strain to break free of
Adrenaline shakes
Forcing yourself to lie in wait

Soaking in need
Fear lying in your chest
Driven without mercy
Burning without rest
Alone in oceans deep
Unextinguishable feeling rise
Unable to repel, there can be no,
Compromise

Afloat in dark clutch
Mists licking your skin
Bullet wound speaks
Wound aching within
Hear myriapod creep
As entrapment burrows deep
Panic singing reason
To sleep!

Never see me
Lunacy feeds me
Time won't leave me
Alone!

Sneaking into your mind
The call of the bird
Starving for home
Enemy gunfire is heard

Never see me
Futility needs me
Time won't leave me
Alone...
