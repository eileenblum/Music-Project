Damp &amp; without light
Deep &amp; unaccessible
Malevolent, without sight
Mighty &amp; dependable

Thunder rolls, opens up the sky
Clouds cracking, bleed
Tears falling - seems to cry
Head of thunder, seething,
See my smile, voices roaring
In the night, dark marches
Single file, see me smile
I am doom, I'm doom

I walk alone
Stalk this land of frozen wastes
Deliverance, calling numbers
Sunlight's kindness I forsake

Thunder rolls, opening up the sky
Clouds cracking, bleed
Tears falling - seems to cry
Head of thunder, seething,
See my smile, voices roaring
In the night, dark marches
Single file, see me smile
I am doom, I'm doom

I crawl across the scape
Ending life's debates
Spurning all that comes with the dawn
Unearthly to the core
Born of winter's flame
Encompassing all &amp; more
Thunderhead is my name!
My name!

[Repeat chorus]

I'm doom...
