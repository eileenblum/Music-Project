As the candle in the window
I too remember the flame
And I sit thinking that I'll follow
And things will be the same
The same...

As of yesterday
I have been forsaken
And anger crawls through me
When someday never comes

Better days have visited
Stealing my life as thieves
Taking what was wanted
Please don't die in memory

Longing for my past
But no closer to my dreams
Forgiveness at last
Clearly there, but never seen...

As of yesterday, I have been forsaken
And anger crawls through me
When someday never comes
As of yesterday, everything is lost
Remorse slithers through me
When someday never comes
