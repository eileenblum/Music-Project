One billion miles plus ten
I race towards my goal
Searching through seasons
Ability strains my reasons

Unknown oceans stretch
To horizons strained by grief

A sound a sight a movement
I fight!
Entering behind, into, &amp; upon
Paradox's plane, newest dimension

They seek to suck the breath
From my dying lungs
But requiring much more than one
Failure is their calling

Worlds unfold in vision
Can't pound me into submission
When I whisper your name
Fear will steal you soul

They seek to suck the breath
From impoverished lungs
Requiring much more than one
Failure is their calling

Immensity's reborn truths
Realized in sleepless death
Tells story insignificantly
Small, of one, who tried
To change it all

They seek to suck the breath
From my dying lungs
But requiring much more than one
Failure is their calling!
