I wish I may wish I might
Kick your fucking ass tonight
When i prove you wrong
You'll call me a dick

Embarrassed you, you know i'm right
I love to see you cringe, then lie
Everbody stops and stares
To look at us
But we don't care

[Chorus:]
'cause we're a bunch of dicks
We tell it like it is
I know it makes you pissed
'cause we're a bunch of dicks

Fuck off or I'll kill you

I wish I may I might
Kick your fucking ass tonight
When I prove you wrong
You'll call me a dick
I told you once, I told you twice
You should've taken my advice
Said the chick's a nasty slut
If you don't like it kiss my butt

[Chorus]

Fuck off or I'll kill you
