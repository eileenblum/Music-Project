Touch now, what only I can feel
Teach you, a lesson in the surreal
Quivering fit of violent lust
Never shamed to crack
The epidermal crust

Bloodless recoil spits
Elation making fists

Lost but never isolated
Alone &amp; never violated
Mind in chaos unsedated
Brain awash in welcome hatred

Nerves a symphony
Coaxed to mutiny
Subconscience the receiver
The bone crackin' fever
Absorbing power rest
Alive &amp; loveless
Evil rides my back
Ecstatic, hear them crack

Elected, octracized, ejected
Subjected, &amp; rejected
Fever upon me tonight
Caring for nothing in sight

Hammer swinging hits
Cranium shattered splits

[Repeat pre-chorus &amp; chorus]

Waves of punishment
Swept by tides of pain
All this springs afroth
Walk my shores free of cost

Escapable only now
My vastness calling
Cries, "Le me hear you whisper"
"Crush me" "Kill Me"
Fly...

[Repeat pre-chorus &amp; chorus]
