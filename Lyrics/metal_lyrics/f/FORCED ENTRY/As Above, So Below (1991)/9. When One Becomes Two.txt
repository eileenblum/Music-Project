Releasing my hold
To sink into depths untold
Anxiety rising fresh
To strike me stiff with stress

Thoughts of another
Take me places I can't discover
What the hell has past?
Random circumstance - relapse

Hurling through
What time? What place? What self?
Driven into
No clues to find, no help
Can't control you
When one becomes two

Thrown into revision
Brain pan itches with
Memory of decision
Murders I commit
His conscience does
Omit! Omit!

Actions of another
Destroying me I can't recover
Nesting inside of me
Nemisis of tranquility

Hurling through
What time? What place? What self?
Driven into
No clues to find, no help
Can't control you
When one becomes two

Murderous intent
My fould &amp; bloated twin
Goddamn this half life
It's standing up rising again
Mesmerize
Hypnotize
Rectify
I against I

Actions of another
Destroying me I can't recover
Nesting inside of me
Nemesis of tranquility

[Repeat chorus]

I'm frightened indecisive
Growing desperation is why
I'm seething life receeding
Destructive path trying to claim me
