Nightmare strikes
With drunken fist
Blood trickles
From father's kiss
Brandish love
As a plastic toy
See, he loves
His little boy

First they cry
Then they hate
Then they kill
Then they rape

[CHORUS:]
The patterns change
But the cycle won't break
Kaleidoscope spinning it's webs of fate
Beat this child he'll beat his own
Kaleidoscope grips with powers unknown

Twisting mind
Plays awful tricks
Mother whips
When she has no fix
Guilty of birth he shares the pain
Slowly drowning but he stays
Falling tears, breaking heart
Suicide becomes his start

[CHORUS]

Endless mistrust
Sick with disgust
Confusion bursts as flood
Sick with neglect
Loves reject
Bedrooms splatter blood
Violent fits, shattered wrists
Gifts of the game
Terror rips, kaleidoscope grips
With strong arms of pain
