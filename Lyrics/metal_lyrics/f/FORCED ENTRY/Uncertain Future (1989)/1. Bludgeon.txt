Emotion boiling over rip us from our rest
Frustration &amp; contempt but hate is the best
Stumble &amp; fall, we've set the trap
Relentless pushing on
Forced Entry at your back!

[CHORUS:]
Gripping firm
Tool of revenge
This is to be
Deception's end
Helping me
Crushing life &amp; breaking bone
And growing stronger than you know
Bludgeon psyches
Bludgeon spikes
Beaten senseless, bludgeon strikes

Breaking your back, retaliate
Raging full force, to exterminate

[CHORUS]

Bashing, smashing, forcing our way

We shatter the walls of the taken
For granted exposing cowards in this
Naked truth, velocity gaining speed
We're crunching the slack
Unrelenting pushing on
Forced entry at your back!

[CHORUS]

Forcing our -- way!
