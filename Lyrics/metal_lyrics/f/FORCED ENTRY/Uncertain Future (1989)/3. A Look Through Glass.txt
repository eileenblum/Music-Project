Skeletal forests stand alone
Watching poisoned river flow
Acid rains bathe our hell
Burns our flesh &amp; fill our well

Fluorocarbons fallen heavens
Concrete jungles useless barren
Corruption rampant thing built must fall
The day I was born I saw through it all

[CHORUS:]
We made our bed
And in it we'll sleep
Layed to rest
But no one sees
To serve ourselves
To save belief
We cry in shame
But no one sees

Broken glass reflects our world destroyed
To live or die, no longer a choice
Look through the glass
With your sinking heart
Your window-pains screaming
You had your part

No longer a choice

Wastelands writhe ultraviolet light
Ozone extinction nothing left
Smokestacks whisper forgotten words
Never forget that this is our world

[CHORUS]

Broken glass reflects a world destroyed
To live or die, no longer a choice
Asphalt insults are our gifts to thee
We cry in shame but no one sees
