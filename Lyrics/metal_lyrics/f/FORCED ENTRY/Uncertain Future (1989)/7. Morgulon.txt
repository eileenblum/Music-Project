Slaughtered, unmercifully
Torn apart, left to die
Resurrected, painfully
Deliverance, immortalized

Undead, alive at last
Freed from the grasp of the ancient gods
Flag of death, flies at half-mast
Out of the past comes the dead

Stagnant earth, chemical wastes
Chaos ruling, it never waits
Mutant cells, join as one
Lethal minds spell destruction

[CHORUS:]
Undead, alive at last
Freed from the grasp of the ancient gods
Flag of death, flies at half-mast
Out of the past comes the dead
Undead, prepare for war
Ten million ghosts rising from their ancient tombs
To seek revenge, is all that's left
Now on Morgulon, it's planet death

Superimposed animation
Vicious ghouls running free
Tearing limbs, amputation
Stumps spurting blood profusely

[CHORUS]

Death, planet death
