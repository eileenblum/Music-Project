Eight-eyed horror
Scaled to the waist
Lives in desolation
Long forgotten place

Re-entering the world
To a time changed scape
Hibernation disturbed
By the cycles of eight

Loosed on society
Drawn by his need
Descending to the village
At last it's time to feed

[CHORUS:]
He's a walking death
He lives on pain
Sub human creature, remember his name
Eighty thousand years
He slumbered in shame
Now he claims his throne, the Octoclops reigns

Moving through the villages
Clearing one by one
Thriving when he finds them
Nothing when he's done

Blessing all of them
With slow &amp; painful deaths
Living on the violence
Growing larger yet

Enslaving all humanity
To ensure his food supply
Ruler of all mankind
Master with eight-eyes

[CHORUS]
