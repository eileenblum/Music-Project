Bred conditioned serve for good
Give but not receive
Slipping on life's stepping stones
Blindly they shall be
Following the evil
Emanating from within
Locking doors behind them
Never to be let back in

Follow
Them in darkness
Cancerous regret
Fools
Cowardice reigns
Pay your final debt

Extraction of their values
Poisoning their minds
Desecration of religion
Evil thoughts unwind
Finally now they realize
How ignorant they were
But it's too late, so pay the price
In lakes of fire they burn

Follow
Them in darkness
Cancerous regret
Fools
Cowardice reigns
Exhale your final breath

Pagan rituals ended
Revelation proves it's fate
For they hear the final verdict
Cast unto the realms of hate
Falling now the black prophets
See torture &amp; demise
Suffering pain for endless years
Until the death of time

Unrest they find
