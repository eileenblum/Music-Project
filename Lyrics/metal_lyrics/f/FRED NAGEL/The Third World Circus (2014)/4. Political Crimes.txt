I will gladly state
I will gladly not vote for the state
You might think it's crime
But I don't want my hands covered in slime

But I have no voice
I'm not even given any choice
These politics
These politicians live just like rats

So what If I cast my cross into the pit
what makes a difference, the cross or the culprit?
Give me a nation where it works
Democracy, that is, it is the greatest hoax

ANC is king
The victory song that no-one else will sing
Two thirds majority
Honestly, what change will my vote bring?

Well, so what If I cast my cross into the pit?
I mean, what makes a difference, the cross or the culprit?
Give me one nation where it works
This so-called democracy. I mean, it is the greatest of hoaxes.
Hoaxes... is that even a word? Whatever, that's not even the point!
The point that I'm trying to make is that I don't believe any more
in democracy than I believe in the Moon landings
...or Bigfoot
...or second chances in relationships

Sure, I don't agree with where we are
And where the power lies could be the cause of our demise
Indoctrination, propaganda, lies
Leave the public brainwashed through their suffering
Political crimes

I regret to say
We may not see the change we dearly crave
But sitting on the fence
is far worse of a national offence
