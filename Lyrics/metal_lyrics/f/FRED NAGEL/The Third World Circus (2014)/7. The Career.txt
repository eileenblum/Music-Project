"South Africa's policy of black economic empowerment (BEE)
is not simply a moral initiative to redress the wrongs of the past.
It is a pragmatic growth strategy that aims to realise the country's
full economic potential while helping to bring the black majority into the economic mainstream."

"No economy can grow by excluding any part of its people,
and an economy that is not growing cannot integrate all of its citizens in a meaningful way"

"Through its BEE policy, the government aims to achieve the following objectives:
Empower more black people to own and manage enterprises. Enterprises are regarded
as black-owned if 51% of the enterprise is owned by black people,
and black people have substantial management control of the business."

So, i got this fancy new job ne!
sitting in a chair and blowing bubbles in the air.
My boss he's a really really really nice man
He gave me lots of guidance for our newest business plan.

"Find us an investor, oh the plan is so defiant.
But of course we will make sure that he is BEE compliant."
If our plans work out, this man will pump us full of cash.
Then we laugh and dance and eat and drink and spend it on our ass.

So thank you, F.W. de Klerk! And thank you to everyone who shot him in the back
B and a double E, the alternate spelling for the word Democracy
And Thank you, Hendrik Verwoerd, Without you this country wouldn't be where it should
If it hadn't been for you, I'd still be living in Soweto.

They took away our country, our homeland and our pride
And built it full of roads on which my BMW rides
Now it's time to take back all the riches we have lost
from these post-apartheid children who got turned down for my job post.

Freedom, equality and justice shall reside
within this new certificate, my modern assegai
You have an opinion that you'd like me to consider?
Silly minority, I'm busy, got an email to reply.
