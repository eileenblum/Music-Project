Brothers, so here we sit
A collection of colours each with its own wit
Lashing out at the other
With words his throat must be slit

Oh, we are so blind
I can't believe how we struggle to find a compromise
Find a way to let the strain of Man unwind
Afloat on a wind-still lake
No current to pull us
Independent beings aware that we should join ranks
But instead we choose to swim away from the banks.

Trying to flee is futile
Your mark has been made and your gravestone is carved
Abandon this land that's so fertile?
You coward, you fool, your soul will be starved

Can you please tell me why do we hate each other?
And can you tell me why it is so Goddamn hard
to call each other brother?

Look at our beautiful country
A powerful symbol of might
Now see how our people are raping
each other and the land in the night
Can we not slow down
And love our neighbour as asked from heaven far above
So we sit with our heads in the past
Appreciate the land so vast

So I'll ask again:
Can you please tell me why do we hate each other?
And can you tell me why it is so Goddamn hard
to call each other brother?

Realize that all we needed is compassion for each other
A timeless connection like the love that you see between brothers?
