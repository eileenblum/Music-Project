Sun on the windowpane
Slowly eating away
How I wished you'd stay, I miss you every day
But now I bellow, Why'd you gone astray?

Alone I walk in this field
Where friends had lived and by law, we had a shield
My love, my dear, a piece of me has died
And my feet burn on the roadside

'Cause I look to the days of laughter
Fueled by heavy beer
Sitting round the Weber,
The smell of leather in the air

But now it seems the time has died of age
I'm sorry that we had to part this way,
My Beauty, Mercedes Benz.

E63 AMG

You carried me to work
Because then of course you were a company perk
When it rained and you got dirty,
I would wash you!
Eish nee, Jabulani sal hom vir jou was.

I kept you oiled and your belly fed,
I remember the time you had a broken leg
That bliksem Frank, yes the Hi-Q Man,
He doesn't know a thing about you

Without you I cannot fall asleep
on your perfectly clad German leather backseat
My life must end, I've never felt so on-end
Now that you're away because some man stole my pay

So when all is said and done, a new day will have to come
Before the setting of the sun, I'll buy myself a better one.
