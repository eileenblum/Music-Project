They told me the free water isn't safe to drink
And sold me some new ones in bottles that blink
A bottle that's made in a factory of plastic
That pollutes all of the free drinking water that washes down my sink

The night skyline seems to be on fire
Burning our coal to take our kind higher
We are diurnal beings but yet
This is the goal to which we aspire

Can't you see this great error of logic?
To purify ourselves we make the drinking water toxic
The driving by lorry, the pumping, the taxes
The refrigeration in malls fueled by assets
Now tell me, is that ValprÃ© still healthy?

I seriously hate E-tolls
The financial strain is taking its toll
The Belgians are taking our money away
Our president bathes all his guilt away
In money that he stole from the country he leads
to disarray

Can't you see this great error of logic?
To account for the land's debt you rob the public
Gantries that hang over freeways like gallows
Unwilling citizens' lifeblood it swallows
Now tell me, is the system still wealthy?
