Build in me, O LORD!
and once again grant me Light,
to fill this human void,
Yes, chasten me with Sight!
I speak wounds, and my blood is a tune of Death,
and my word shall devour flesh.

I slayed the lion to become him, I am HUNGER!
Anti-flesh nimbusl...
I crush my eyes, to gain the sight of a god.

My heart is fixed, O LORD,
and my veins are prepared,
to receive thy venom, to channel thy glare.
Mad with the overflow,
I open my chest, and my word shall devour flesh.

The earth trembled and was silent, shook and stood still.

Anti-flesh nimbus...
I choke the human within, to gain the will of a god.

Maranatha is an Aramaic phrase occurring only once in the New Testament and also in the Didache which is part of the Apostolic Fathers collection.
It is transliterated into Greek letters rather than translated, and is found at the end of Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor 16:22) as a farewell.
"If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha."
The word 'Maranatha' translates to "O Lord, come!", however if separated into 'Maran atha', it becomes a credal declaration of "Our Lord has come."
