And I took my staff,
even beauty,
and cut it asunder...
Have you been into the fire?

Carved in stone or pissed in snow, the day will come!
The day will come!
A clean prayer from an unclean tongue,
there is no life here - only different ways to die,
moth-eaten vows of hollow pride,
skin for skin, yea, skin for skin.
The wine of Sodom, Gomorrah's fields, come
spill now forth the poison of dragons in the name of God.

Chasm from chasm, Armageddon, Armageddon, Armageddon,
A thousand angel jubilation, and upon this rock I will build my church

...And the sun of falsehood shall shine with trust,
from the depths of Satan in the name of God.

O sweetest wormwood,
o glorious gall,
yes sweet is the fruit that grows from the tree of bitterness.
The gall and the wormwood,
the wormwood and the gall,
a velvet kiss and a thousand knives of salt in thy cunt

And I took the sword and brandished it twice...
Have you fed the mother of death?

A clean prayer from an unclean tongue,
this Guilt was old when the world was young,
still shall innocence be my sign,
O LORD, why hast thou not forsaken me?
...And the sun of falsehood shall shine with trust,
from the depths of Satan in the name of God

Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Drink now his blood, and kill in his name.
Let us pray,
let us pray and prepare our snares for the promised day,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Eat now his flesh, and inject the venom into his name.
A perfect wound from a perfect blade,
the perfect deceit in a perfect world at the perfect day
