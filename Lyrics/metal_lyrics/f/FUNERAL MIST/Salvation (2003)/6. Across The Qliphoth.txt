Across the qlipha burst and break
Descend into formation ye inverted
Creack and shatter what lieth ye ahead
Pour forth as blind madness to bind the flesh

Piece by piece, come ye forth
Ye angels of ecstasy/demons of revelation
To unmask the innermost face of the world unuttered
To reveal the harloty of JHVH

Across the qliphoth, seek ever higher
Ascend from formation, ye wicked
Sweep and swirl through all seven planes
And enter the highest triade

Piece by piece, come thou forth
Thou slithering worm of duality, divine whore
For said thou not; "I am the Alpha and the Omega"?
And are these not the words of a passionate serpent?

Through the crust, penetrate
Swarm ye as insects into the all-mind
And inspire its sun to shine upon a day, when God and Judas are united

I am thy Anubis, open for thy rebirth in flesh
So uphold firmly through me the renewal of all in one quint
Pentamaximus... The holiest of morals, ye pestilence of existence
Summon for the binding of all... to kill the self of God

Across the qliphoth, incarnate
Manifest into being, ye blessed
Corrupt and scatter what lieth ye ahead
Pour forth to unite us with death
Denepo-re eb ot reven... delaes si elcric ehT

Through the crust, penetrate
Swarm ye as insects into the all-mind
And inspire its sun to shine upon a day, when God and Judas are united...
And together crucified
