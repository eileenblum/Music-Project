Appear! O catastrophe god
For thee only shall I breathe again
Thou beast and angel, intimate foe of all
Forgive me not for I have sinned
Angel of adversity, burden of the world
For thee only shall I drink from myself
Thou pride and anger, demon and god
Forgive me not for I am life... Dirt!

Cleanse me now, bind the flesh,
So that I can receive thy punishment with dignity, with dignity
Make use of me! Make use of this flame,
So that I can receive thy ineffable splendour with dignity, with dignity

Breathing wounds
Living worship

Observe! O catastrophe god
For thee only shall I spare this flesh
Infected tongue of the faceless
Forgive my judge for he is clean
Anti-soul, anti-soul
Receiver's sight reversed and reborn
Anti-flesh, anti-flesh

Imbue me now, let the spirit take form,
So that I can receive thy punishment with dignity, with dignity
Make use of me! Make use of this flame,
So that I can receive thy ineffable splendour with dignity, with dignity
