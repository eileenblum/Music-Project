Qui tollis peccata mundi
Agnus Dei, Son of man
See me not for your eyes are pain
Do not force me to stab you again
For I envy every wound on your corpse
Verily, verily I say unto thee
A million images won't be enough
For I know where you hide your soul
Agnus Dei
Crucifixus etiam pro nobis, sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est
Qui carni quondam contegi dignatus es pro perditis,
Cujus latus perforatum unda fluxit sanguine
Agnus Dei, Prince of peace
Yet shall war be the echo of your love
Just like war shall be the echo of mine
And together shall we make the utmost balance
Verily, verily I say unto thee
In those day shall men seek death, and shall not find it;
And shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them
Agnus Dei
