Panic, hysteria, infernally raging chaos
Salvation through destruction
Cold black sun of hope

Darkness
Your star lies cold
Blindness
Blood and ash, be my crystal
Helpless
Massdeath pole to pole

Imprecation of this predicted curse
Blessed be man, global crem/salv -ation
Genesis, genesis, dawn of dawns
Genesis, genesis, dagger of flames
The altar must never turn cold
Flesh to cinders, womb of ashes
Come fire, come and close the circle,
Holy inferno, dawn of dawns
Sun of death

And the lord hung the rainbow as a sign,
It won't be water bur fire THIS time
Harmagedon, the thousand face revealed
Cold black sun of hope

Darkness
Blindness
Helpless

Famine and plague be my steps
To join my spells in this final war
Suicide, warfare be my tongue
Come fire, devour through me
Sun of death
Angel, angel... impeccant God of clean
Purify these fields shane
Purify, purify
Purity comes when death is all
