In the name of the Lord,
I come against you â carried forth by the wind of your fall
Behold and ponder;
Hell is made anew â the brimstone comes alive

Come and greet the judgment â in which you shall dissolve
Bow and give thanks for we have pillaged God â and made his vengeance our own

In the name of the Lord,
I come against you â high on the sweet irony of the cross
Behold and ponder;
You will have no peace â no restless and rootless fall

Come now, greet the downfall â of your revered free will
Bow and give thanks for we have built on death â and made her hunger our home

In the name of the Lord,
I come against you â carried forth by the wind of your fall
Accept now the flame
In which you shall be cleansed

Behold and ponder;
Hell is made anew
See now, the brimstone of my psalms come alive
Accept now the faith in which you shall devolve

Come and greet the judgment â in which you shall dissolve
Bow and give thanks for we have pillaged â and made his vengeance our own
