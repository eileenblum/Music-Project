And as our song one last time shall rise
So shall the dead â So shall the dead

From all that's dwelling below the skies
Let the false heaven's praise arise
False salvation loud proclaim and shout for the joy of the false god's name
Blessed be the song of the fraud and the sham
Blessed be the foul masquerade of the lamb
Hosanna! Behold the rise of an army of well-dressed anti-Christs

And as the one torch at last shall burn
So shall the flesh â So shall the tenets of the flesh
So shall the doctne of the womb
So shall the gospel of the birth
So shall the promise of the Lord
And as the first voice in war shall drown
So shall the last â so shall the despair of the last

And as his word now shall come alive
So shall the dead â so shall the dead

For all that's dwelling below the skies
That blind destruction that in us thrives
Holy water upon the young and holy poison under the tongue
Cherish the ashes, revere the dust
Embrace the vows of the jewel wasp
Hosanna, Stolen gospelshine â Hosanna to the false divine

And as the one law at last shall fall
So shall the flesh â so shall the tenets of the flesh
So shall the doctrine of the womb
So shall the gospel of the birth
So shall the promise of the Lord
So shall the blessings of the damned
And as our psalms one last time shall roar
So shall our doom â So shall the trumpets of our doom
