In golden flames, the old self is burning
Worlds tremble as my cup overflows
Former deserts flooded with spirit
Come! Bask now in the glow of the rebirth

Six hours of falling forever
Through the loops of the refiner's void
A furnace of spiritual plenum
Cruel wheel of unrelenting ego death

I give in to the void â lest we be trapped in here forever
Lest we be â within the without

Observing myself from the left wall
Each candle a waterfall of gold
The blue room vibrates to gain power
No past, no future, only now

Sudden metamorphosis burst forth
Waves of latent divinity released
The remnants of the lower self lie shattered
The one-ness of God splintered and dispersed

We travel inwards...

North and South collide with a thunder
East and West have merged with up and down
Time itself has long lost its meaning
All hail the new sacrament!

I give in to the void
Lest we be trapped in here forever

Most of the face appears missing
No surface has ever been dry
Hands of cold reach for my soul
No past, no future, only now

I give in to the void lest we be trapped in here forever
Lest we be stuck in the banishment â we soar within the without
I give in to the void lest we be trapped in here forever
The spirit of the new sacrament has built in us a tomb
