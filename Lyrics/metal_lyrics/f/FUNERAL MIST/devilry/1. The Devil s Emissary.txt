Havoc - the holy madness must be gone
It's been growing far too strong strong of not
Armageddon must arrive
So every trace of your faith will die

To wipe out the god of mercy
The Devil's Emissary

Sons of light
In torture you must die
You know my vision, so you know why
For what you call disaster, is the art of our lord

To mock the god of mercy
The Devil's Emissary

I'll make you beg for a quick death
I'll make you scream like a child
And I won't stop until the only thing that's left of you
Is the echoes of your cries

Complete annihilation of the holy fabrication sent from hell by pure atrocity as the Devil's Emissary

To wipe out the god of mercy
The Devil's Emissary

Now follow to where demons reign
Follow and your hate shall be shared and glorified
Follow and feel the black flame of Satan
Fill your empty soul with the strength that you thought you had
