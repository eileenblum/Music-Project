Like risen from the nothingness
Clouds of demonic mist â freezing cold
Dismal black and filled with purest hate
Eternal shadow â eternal grief â endless destruction
The funeral mist

Pure darkness will appear
Death lies in the air
The mist will block the sun
It all has just begun

See the blackness fill the sky â never to disappear
Come forth oh mighty darkness â come forth eternal night
Behold the silent storm of evil drown your sacred light
Born of evil â born of wrath
In the funeral mist

Pure darkness will appear
Death lies in the air
The mist will block the sun
It all has just begun

Like risen from the nothingness
Clouds of demonic mist â freezing cold
Dismal black and filled with purest hate
Eternal shadow â eternal grief â endless destruction
The funeral mist

Pure darkness will appear
Death lies in the air
The mist will block the sun
It all has just begun
