Temped into the darkness the moaning night
The nightside phantom is calling
With its sighs, I can't resist the drowning it is too strong
I must unite with the black shine where the phantom dwells

A wind of purest evil licks my skin
And took me beyond all light and into the nocturnal
Embraced by the shades of night
Engulfed by the demonic tranquility of darkness
Distant whispers echoes in the halls of night
As the nightside phantom calls me into the nightside realm

Temped into the darkness the moaning night
The nightside phantom is calling
With its sighs, I can't resist the drowning it is too strong
I must unite with the black shine where the phantom dwells
