Lord of malice â the god supreme
Bless those happy fools with misery

Unchaining the beast
Horny witches feast
Fiends gather
Eternal ecstasy

The treasure was found
...but the treasure was not gold, nor pearls or lustrous stones
But the true light that you so obstinately call darkness

Demonic majesty â we summon thee
Emerge from your hellish torture-pit

Prince of darkness â the god supreme
Bless those holy dogs with agony

Unchaining the beast
Horny witches feast
Fiends gather
Eternal ecstasy

Lord of malice â the god supreme
Bless those happy fools with misery
Prince of darkness â the god supreme
Bless those holy dogs with agony
