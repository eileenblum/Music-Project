I've made up my mind,
I'll fight for it till I die,
Mark my fucking words.
I have no place in structured space,
I won't go unheard.
All doubt thrown aside,
The mess I've made behind these eyes.
These years won't go to waste,
Lets show them what we're made of.

We're simply at the start of it,
Don't you try to silence this,
Can't you see that we are not dead yet.
I'm in control, fate seems to lose it's hold,
This path is mine and mine alone,
The choices are made, the lines are crossed,
I CAN'T TURN BACK!

Yeah!

Gotta give me something, even if I'm only the one that you all love to hate.
Gotta give me something, even if I'm only the one that you all seem to hate.
SEEM TO HATE.

Like a disease that has no cure,
Or a needle hitting bone,
The addiction spreads and it's left me only wanting more.
Once you've got a taste of it,
It stitches to your soul.
This is more a life style then a simple goal.
Failure's not an option,
But even if we do,
At least my final solace is I actually saw it through.
The weeks are long,
The days go fast,
Don't you think you've won.
It's far from over, look in my eyes,
It's only just begun.

GO!

This is the prologue to a story that's just begun,
Lets raise a glass and hope the the epilogue can't be found.

So, we've started the fires,
They burn brighter then ever.
As night turns to day,
The dancing dead live another day.

Oh, don't think that this will conclude it all.
