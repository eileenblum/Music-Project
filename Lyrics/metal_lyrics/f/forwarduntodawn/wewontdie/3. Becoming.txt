I bet you didn't expect to wind up in your own mess.
I've been waiting patiently, don't try to run,
It'll be over soon, then I'll be gone.

You shouldn't look so scared,
You're to blame for what I have become.
Don't you see?
I've been hunting you since day one.
I've seen what you've done.
For each case that went unclosed,
I'll make you pay in your blood,
Or lack there of.
It's been so long since I've seen the sun.

Terrified of what my dreams have become,
Push far past my limits, I have been on, been on a path, one with no
return.
I have been up for endless nights.
I have been hellbent on your destruction,
You think it's over, but it's only begun, I will make sure you are forgotten,
I can't drink this away.

Trust me when I say I found a way to end your days.

This is not a test, this is not an empty threat,
I have been watching, waiting, for you.
Ever since that night I saw your face,
When you took a bite out of my life,
You should have killed me too.

I have devised the perfect plan for your demise,
This is the perfect plan.

I can't begin to describe the feeling I have inside,
To know that you're barely alive,
Hanging on by a thread.
I can't begging to describe the feeling I have inside,
To know that you're barely alive,
Hanging on by a thread.

There's nothing left to say,
This is the ending,
THIS IS THE END.
