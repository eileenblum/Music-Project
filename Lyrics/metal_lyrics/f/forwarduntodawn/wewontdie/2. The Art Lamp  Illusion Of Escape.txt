This is not a story,
This is not a play by play,
It's not a dramatization,
(JUST SOMETHING I HAVE TO)
Something I have to say,
Why'd I dig my own grave?
Why'd you just watch me stray?
(WATCH ME STRAY RIGHT OFF THE)
Off the plank, off the pier,
Knees weak from shallow fears,
Knee deep in all my fears,
(BUT I CANNOT LOSE MY)
Lose myself inside this place,
Lose myself in anyway,
I'm my worst enemy.
(MY OWN WORST ENEMY)

Pull me from my mind,
Raise up, just don't leave me behind.

This town has got it's ways,
Of trying to make you stay,
It won't have you get away.

NO.

It's not hard to see the curse of this place,
You stay and decay.
Gotta slip away.

Move on to a better place,
Just leave without a trace.

Once it's in your blood, the disease will remain,
You can fight temptation.
Only the strong escape.

All the time I have lost, (MY THOUGHTS BETRAY ME.)
But, I'll keep the scars, (BECAUSE THEY REMIND ME) the best is yet to
come.
For some, hope has died (SO LONG AGO.)
Now the sands of time (WASH. THEM AWAY.)
I can't believe this is where I'm from.

Now.
Is.
My.
Time.

I'm about to let loose on this place.
Run all you want no one is safe.
I lived in the shadows but now I wake.
The life that we lives breathes insanity.
