Waking in sweat from nightmares, constant feverish dreams.
I scream but they go unheard.
No one can save me now,
I'm a victim of my own mind.

Black turns to grey before my bloodshot eyes,
(I'm trapped within this vicious circle).
No one can save me now,
I'm chained down, there's no escape

From here, the keys been lost so long ago.
No one can save me now,
I can hear their footsteps getting closer.

It's not hard to tell what they want,
I can hear them laughing from every window.

FUCK.

There's no telling how long this will last,
It's hard to tell if it's all real.
The air can't seem to reach my lungs,
Creeping panic is all I feel.

My bones seem to constrict into one.

I need someone to just wake me up.
