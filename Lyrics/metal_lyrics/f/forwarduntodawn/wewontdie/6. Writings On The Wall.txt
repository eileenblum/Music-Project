Don't tell me what to be,
I have a reason for the things I scream.
There's a story to tell,
And a time bomb ticking, my ticket to hell.
The words I bring to the songs you sing,
They help me condemn my sins.
My hands are bloodied from a timeless past,
These endless conflicts can never last.
Time isn't on my side,
If it was then I wouldn't fear a last good-bye.
The dark doesn't frightens me,
It's more so the unknowing, the uncertainty.
For all I've lost, for all I've gained,
The only thing it's done is kept me healthily insane.
We know that the end is in sight,
But sometimes it's fear that gives the push to fight.

I've done all I could to run, but my case leaves me closer then ever.
So take this eulogy as my final script in the chapter of the UNFORGIVING.
SING THESE SONGS WITH ME, EVEN AFTER MY TIME HAS PAST OVER,
AND REMEMBER THE LESSONS WE HAVE LEARNED.

I've done all I could to run, but my case leaves me closer then ever.
So take this eulogy as my final script in the chapter of the unforgiving.
Sing these songs with me, even after my time has past over,
And remember the lessons we've learned here on after.

If you live life to the fullest and follow your dreams,
The devil cannot hold you and god has no reign.
Human ignorance is common play it seems,
Just open your eyes and smile through the pain.

Then you'll see;

Freedom is in the mind of whom it possess.
