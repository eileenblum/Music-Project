[mÃºsica: CÃ©sar / Fractalia, letra y adaptaciÃ³n: Maly]

The light blinds me
In the other side of the tunnel
There's not cold nor heat
Just a strange feeling

Without resignation I move away
Of the door that some time...
Lodged my life
Following a road that I

I did not know
The door that some time
Retained my happiness
Putting out the last breath

I walk very slowly
And the shadows stop me
Cry out help me!
Entreating the redemption

By their burn souls
Will they arrive at the light?
Make me return
Return me
I miss the suffering
Return me there

The shadows are strange things
On the road
Those shapes are weird things
In that open hole
