Crime and punishment, it's like a game
And if there's no judgement, everything is legal
It's so easy to kill

The main, is to break the line
Now you can play with the human fates
Another life is placed one's stake
Blind heat is in the blood

Greed of gain, it is your aim
Hell is in your head
You really think it's natural selection
The strongest is staying alive

But it's your ugly game
And the rules was created by you
People all around are the puppets
They are fulcrum

Then you damage another life
Your conscience is silent, it's no more
But in the furious pace of your game
You have forgotten, you are not the Lord

You are the toy in another hands
And your fate is simply directed by someone else.
It's so easy to kill.
