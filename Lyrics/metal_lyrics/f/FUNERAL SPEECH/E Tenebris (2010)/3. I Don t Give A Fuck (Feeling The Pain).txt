I don't give a fuck,
What you think about me
I'm what I'm,
Nothing make it stop

Feeling the pain,
Trying to gain
Strength comes to an end,
Can't understand
You' re not my friend

Born to do my best
Now I'm your pest
Living like a blessed
The wages is the death

Feeling the pain,
Trying to gain
Strength comes to an end,
Can't understand
Where do I wend?

Stop starring at my face
I'm in a big disgrace
The problems is my cage
I'll vent on you my rage

Feeling the pain,
Trying to gain
Strength comes to an end,
Can't understand
Fucking dead end
