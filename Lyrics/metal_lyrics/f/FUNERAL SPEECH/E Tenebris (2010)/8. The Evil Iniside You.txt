The devil inside you,
He always speaks to you:
Human begins,
They are all your enemies.

No more trust,
It will turn you into dust.
Kill your own, kill your devil!

The devil makes you lie,
Your friends says you goodbye
You are so lonely now,
He simply brings you down

Pray mother-fucker pray-he says,
Kill mother-fucker kill-you will

You have to make a change
Inside your goddamn brain
Stop him to speak to you
Try to realize the truth

No more voices in your head
Do your best and no regret
