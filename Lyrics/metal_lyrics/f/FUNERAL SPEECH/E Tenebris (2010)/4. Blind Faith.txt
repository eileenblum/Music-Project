May be, my dream is life, and my life is dream?
Who will say to me, where is reality, and where is illusion?

I want-I do not receive.
I do not want-and I receive.
May be god it is a devil,
And the devil it's the god?

I'm god who has been turned into a devil.
I'm devil who has been turned into a god.

Is it clear for you? I'm the human one!
I'm magic of life.
I'm life of the worlds.

I'm the human of the earth,
As the flower growing in a beautiful garden.
I'll raise from the dead
And I'll know my name
'Cause death has no limits.
