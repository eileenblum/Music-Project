The blood on the hands
Mors everyday
Perfect conscience
System decays

Making blind people minds
Staring through his eyes
Poverty in mass
Growing like a grass

Cause of senseless wars
Regression is the course

New dictator borns
Speaking senseless words
Implant a point of view
All victims are like you

Using faith like a weapon
Inventing excuse to kill
Pulling the trigger of the warfare
Hands tainted in blood
