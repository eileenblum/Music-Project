I've been a slave
I've languished in the dungeon long
Vicious thoughts sized my soul
Mutilated and wrathful
I've been a slave
I longed to be free

It was my passionate dream
It was immense happiness
That I couldn't reach

And suddenly in the fit of temper
I rushed forward filled with malice

My iron fetters tore all at once
I set my self free from the darkness

I've been a slave
I lived and died in slavery
Now my miserable soul has become free
And I can't hear the chase of noise
And like a breeze I'm flying
In the space
