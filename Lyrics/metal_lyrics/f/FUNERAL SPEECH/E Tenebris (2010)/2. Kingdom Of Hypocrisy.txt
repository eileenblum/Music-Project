A kingdom of hypocrisy
Nobody wants to get there
But it's hard to escape
From the demon

Everyone gets there his own way
Being a flower or a stone

Watching the screen
Or reading a paper
You see his spiteful look
The king is a doll of malice
His stomach is full of human life

Just find the way out of the maze
Break the puzzle

Pretend you tear a piece of you
And give it to him
Take everything you like
And fuck him off
