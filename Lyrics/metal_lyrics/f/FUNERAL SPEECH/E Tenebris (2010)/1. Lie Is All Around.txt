Lie is all around. Back off. Get lost.
Fucking lie, fuck off
Shut up, stop lying.
Got the weapon-got the war.

The law made up by evil
If you are smart you will find
Where is truth and where is lie.

Lie, lie is all around
Ulterior intention.
Lucifer in the kingdom.
Promises and words for the fools.

You are blind and faithful
And going to defend the kingdom.

Try to hide and think.
Protect your home
Not the kingdom and the king
Who will take your life away
And make a dead hero.
