Safe in your bed when sleep overcomes you
Do you yearn for insensibility?
Seeking a refuge amidst the chaos
Consciously escaping reality

Do you resurface from a dark daydream?
Choking on someone elseâs stifled scream

Does the apprehension come from outside
Or does the dread come from in your own mind?
Looking at the world through anotherâs eyes
Tantalizingly familiar, mesmerized

Do you wake as screams shatter the silence?
Held captive to nightmares of things to come
Chilled to the bone, shaken to the core
Wishing for the solace of oblivion

Do you awaken from a reverie?
Remembering something youâve never seen

Does the apprehension come from outside
Or does the dread come from in your own mind?
Looking at the world through anotherâs eyes
Tantalizingly familiar, mesmerized

When you fall asleep do you lose control?
Revisit places youâve not been before
Do you cry for no apparent reason?
Do you sense that something is wrong?

Do you not see the other rising?
As it takes over everything

Does the apprehension come from outside
Or does the dread come from in your own mind?
Looking at the world through anotherâs eyes
Tantalizingly familiar, mesmerized

Touch, taste, sound, smell and something else
Somewhat outrÃ© but recognizable
On the brink of sight, drawn to the edge of night
Following a sylph into the unknown
