[a. Daughter of Silence]

Abraded spirit left on edge
Afflicted to relieve ennui
Abandoned to the elements
Ravaged

Daughter of silence

Bound in silver strands since nascence
Each year forging another link in the chain of life
Some stay pure while others
Become tarnished over time

Tempest inside a cracked vessel
Token of a shattered visage
Telic rage in hidden vestige
Awakened

Daughter of silence

Bound in silver strands since nascence
Each year forging another link in the chain of life
Some stay pure while others
Become tarnished over time

Innocence reclaimed removes the human stain
Of entities ingrained all purity profaned

Daughter of silence

Bound in silver strands since nascence
Each year forging another link in the chain of life
Some stay pure while others
Become tarnished over time

She hears your words
Knows them for lies
So she remains selectively silent

[b. Daughter of Denial]

Fear at freedomâs last threshold
Fever visions of tomorrows
False bright dreams of transformation
Untenable

Somewhere inside a quiet strength resides
Quiescently awaiting a spark of life long denied

Pushed beyond the point of breaking
Pressed in lightless places blind
Palpable terror becoming
Unbearable

Somewhere inside a quiet strength resides
Quiescently awaiting a spark of life long denied

Innocence reclaimed removes the human stain
Of entities ingrained all purity profaned

Daughter of denial
Daughter of denial

Watching shadows on the wall shift
Waiting for footfalls on the stairs
Wanting to fade away somehow
Untouchable

Somewhere inside a quiet strength resides
Quiescently awaiting a spark of life long denied

She hears your words
Knows them for lies
Yet she remains selectively silent

Daughter of denial

[c. Mother of Deception]

[Instrumental]

[d. Father of Condemnation]

Drawn in then drawn down
Where light canât burn away the tarnish
Burn it away
Tattered shards of spirit self
Binding her to nothingness
Fading into shadow
Cursed among the damned

Aftermath in afterimage
When evil stirs within secure wallâs confines
Sorrows cast shadows unbroken
More than meets a blind eye

Innocence reclaimed removes the human stain
Of entities ingrained all purity profaned

Afterthoughtâs aftereffect
When fear responds again recurs hell refined
Lost soul left hallow and made then
Withered ghost denied

Drawn in then drawn down
Where light canât burn away the tarnish
Burn it away
Tattered shards of spirit self
Binding her to nothingness
Fading into shadow
Cursed among the damned

One hand to hold her down
Disassociate
But none to keep her here
Disconnect
Shackled to empty spaces
A vessel of anger

Innocence reclaimed removes the human stain
Of entities ingrained all purity profaned

Drawn in then drawn down
Where light canât burn away the tarnish
Burn it away
Tattered shards of spirit self
Binding her to nothingness
Fading into shadow
Cursed among the damned

She hears your words
Knows them for lies
Yet she remains selectively silent
