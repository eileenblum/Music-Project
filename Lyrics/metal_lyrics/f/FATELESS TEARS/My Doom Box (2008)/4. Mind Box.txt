Pain has chipped the mortar away
My prison bars are ready to give way
I choose to stay inside a self-made cocoon
More nurturing than suffering these mortal wounds

Afraid of a life too empty to abide
I pray I forgive me

A whole reduced to human husk
I feed my own damnation
Captive in terror, hostage to mistrust
I feed my own damnation
I pray you leave me where I lay

Dropping my guard, my mind unlocks
Something has breached these mental blocks
Keeping me prisoner to my past
Forswearing escape, I hold fast

Afraid of a life too empty to abide
I pray I forgive me

A whole reduced to human husk
I feed my own damnation
Captive in terror, hostage to mistrust
I feed my own damnation
I pray you leave me where I lay

Out of desperation
There is no hesitation
Only resignation

Echoes of evocation
No silent convocation
For my own damnation

Afraid of a life too empty to abide
I pray I forgive me

A whole reduced to human husk
I feed my own damnation
Captive in terror, hostage to mistrust
I feed my own damnation
I pray you leave me where I lay

Seeing myself forever inside
I feed my own damnation
Wherein my darkest secrets bide
I feed my own damnation
I pray you leave me where I lay
