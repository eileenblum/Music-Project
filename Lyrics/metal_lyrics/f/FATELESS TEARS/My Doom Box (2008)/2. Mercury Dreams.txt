Beneath it all, something furtive
Restless, pensive, tempted
Here lingers what is most dreaded

Under quicksilver skies
The forming undesired
Eyes for the ages gone
Liquid pools of pain

Behind a mind turned delusive
Doubtless ortive corrupted
False reality created

Under quicksilver skies
The forming undesired
Eyes for the ages made
Liquid pools of pain

Tattered shards of a psyche shattered
Life continues in the moments after
Malign phantasmal forms created by
Rends within a broken mind

Under quicksilver skies
The forming undesired
Eyes for the ages gone
Liquid pools of molten pain

Before a darkness adductive
Helpless, destive, disrupted
Drawn to depths by time undaunted

Under quicksilver skies
The forming undesired
Eyes for the ages gone
Molten pools of pain

A twisted soul trapped within a tortured mind
Tattered shards of a psyche shattered
Disquiet rends a broken mind
