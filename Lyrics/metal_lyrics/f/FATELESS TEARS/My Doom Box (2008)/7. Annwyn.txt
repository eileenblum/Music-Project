Where forever beauty sleeps return

Annwyn

May to you a gentle breeze convey
All that time would not permit me say

Annwyn
Annwyn

If only words without answer
Could fill the enormity of never

Candles oâer dark waters set out to sea
Drifting towards Annwyn at tideâs last turning

Taken by slumber to dreams of you
Has left me broken more than new

Annwyn
