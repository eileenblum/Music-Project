[a. Captor]

[Instrumental]

[b. Captive]

The truth of the unwanted is
None will return for the deathbed blessing
Given by benefactors of pain
Those who will find the silence deafening

Weâre born into this world alone
As children of fear we find
The unknown cages us

Did they never stop to wonder?
What would become of their own flesh and blood?
Could they not see what resonates returns
The knowledge inherent to bone?

Apologies are not handouts
Nor is love and unbreakable bond
The unfortunate are the unprepared
Betrayed when a straightforward seeming world strays

Weâre born into this world alone
As children of fear we find
The unknown cages us

May the dying learn as weâre born knowing
To fear the unknown and the unseen
Did they our suffering devise
Were we denied for being children?
Born outside their design?

Did they never stop to wonder?
What would become of their own flesh and blood?
Could they not see what resonates returns
The knowledge inherent to bone?

Left wretched are those least desired
From the onset when opened are our eyes
As children of fear we find
The unknown cages us
Cages us
