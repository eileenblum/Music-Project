Inert embers flare
Disquieting omens
Inimical portends
My psyche beware

Here no breath of life
Nor near end in sight
Released to the night
My endarkened self

Harrowed evermore
Descent to despair
As yet unaware
My then blackened soul

Here no breath of life
Nor near end in sight
Released to the night
My endarkened self

Tangled thoughts reflect
Some unknown nature
A desperate creature
This tortured aspect

Tangled thoughts reflect
Some unknown nature
A desperate creature
This tortured aspect

Here no breath of life
Nor near end in sight
Released to the night
My endarkened self

Innocence unbound
Dark dream reified
Midnightâs chosen bride
My revenant found

Where no breath of life
The endarkened dwell
Where no breath of life
The endarkened dwell
