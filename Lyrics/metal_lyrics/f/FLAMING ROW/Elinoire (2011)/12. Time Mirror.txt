[Destiny:] You hear the dished smashing at the kitchen floor

[Death:] Her fear is really justified, squarely

[Destiny:] Covert beneath your blanket in the nursery

[Death:] She's frightened of his blatant voice
Sweet sweet child

[Rage:] The bane of his life
Road to perdition

[Spirit/Past/Conscience/Liberty:] This is the day
The story is spinning round
Wait for the turning point

[Death:] You won't commit a crime to what your appetite

[Adam:] Shut up I won't apologize my conduct

[Death:] Are you a faintheart playing with her dignity?

[Adam:] What the hell are you talking 'bout
So, get off my back

[Elinoire:] Devil in disguise
I'm a part of you
So treat my with respect
As cold as ice
You get lost in the maze
This is the worst disgrace of life

[Conscience:] Anger or love
Confronting me
Which will I choose
Anger or love
Confronting me
Is there a turning point?

[Time:] He's getting tired, in front of the TV-Screen

[Destiny:] The breaking news make him wide awake
He can't believe his eyes

[Spirit/Past/Conscience/Liberty:] This is the day
The story is spinning round

[Rage:] Road to perdition

[Spirit/Past/Conscience/Liberty:] Fall in disgrace
Beware of the truth, keep your vow
And wait for the turning point

[Time:] Most recent findings of the investigation were announced

[Destiny:] Will it be true or is it just a joke, god only will know

[Time:] Repress your memories you're longing for intelligence

[Rage:] Come face the truth
You're just a part of this game

[Sax Solo: Marek Arnold]

[Elinoire:] Devil in disguise
I'm a part of you
So treat me with respect
As cold as ice
You get lost in the maze
This is the worst disgrace of life

[Elinoire:] Devil in disguise ......
As cold as ice .....

[Conscience/Liberty:] Devil in disguise .....
As cold as ice .....

[Spirit/Past:] Devil in disguise
She's a part of you
So treat her with respect
As cold as ice
You get lost in the maze
This is the worst disgrace of life
