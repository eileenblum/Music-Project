[Adam:] My innermost's
benumbed with pain, my
pain. Oh in silence and
reclusion I retry to sleep

[Conscience:] He'd braved it
hard but he could not
hold this

[Saxophone Solo: Marek Arnold]

[Adam:] Get up for roaming,
searching the time,
searching time
Seems that it gloats on her
picture 'til it fades to gray.
Scattered to the 4 winds
None can change

[Adam:]
I'm standing it hard,
wish I could be so...

[Destiny:] Far from disgrace
he wants to go back in time

[Conscience:] After that night he laid his promise down

[Destiny/Season/Spirit:]
Can't fall asleep his fault is turning his mind, burning inside

[Guitar Solo: Martin Schnella]

[Destiny:] Clouds are passing in silence, hour for hour,
[Season:] Hour for ...

[Destiny:] Staring straight
through the window, you're still aiming for...
But you can't grab through

[Season:] So tight and obscure

[Conscience:] Oh he beams with joy
I wish he could be so...

[Destiny:] Far from disgrace he wants to go back in time

[Conscience:] After that night he laid his promise down

[Destiny/Season/Spirit:]
Can't fall asleep his fault is turning his mind, burning inside

[Guitar solo: Ali Neander]

[Conscience:] Just follow your heart
You'll find your way just follow your heart Elinoire
