[Part I: Confession]

[Lea:] I remember every day
I meant no harm
Love at the first sight
Sheltered by his hand

I was young and just a child
My heart so strong
The taste of a new life
More than words can say
And I prayed

[Lea:] Forbode a happy ending

[Conscience:] For her life

[Lea:] He promised me the moon all day and night
Foreshadowing, I did not disavow

[Liberty/Conscience/Spirit:] She did not disavow

[Past:] Was it right or was it wrong?
She did not care!
Selfish and blindfold
She left him out in the rain

After many years ago
By a fluke
He became her fortune
A simper on his face
Without grace

[Past:] Forbode no happy ending

[Conscience:] For her life

[Past:] She didn't see the red light glowing bright
The helping hand was there, beyond the light

[Lea:] He followed every footstep

[Liberty/ Conscience:] That she went

[Lea:] He knew about my lige and our plans
And finally he had his field day

[Part II: A Broken Man]

[Zac:] In my heart
Was nothing more than emptiness
Crestfallen by the words she said
Oh Christ what has she done?
Painful eyes

All my dreams were blown away
The chain around my neck was close-drawn
In one fell swoop

[Destiny:] Left alone
In his lonely world
he was captured in his feelings
Built a wall around his mind

So he fell asleep
To start his only dream
Then he lost his confidence in everyone and everything

[Forgiveness:] What will become of a broken man?
Has he ever overcome?
She didn't give a damn
Day after day
And night after night
He followed every breath, each step

[Father:] I was aware
That I made such a big mistake
To keep that secret by myself
But son, what should I do Believe!
Met my own destiny
But I could not keep my hands off them
My eagerness was stronger than my will

[Forgiveness:] What will become of a broken man?
Has he ever overcome?
She didn't give a damn
Day after day
And night after night
He followed every breath. And!

[Part III: Flaming Row]

[Rage:] Go!
[Spirit/Destiny:] Flaming!
[Rage:] Row!
[Spirit/Destiny:] Flaming!
[Rage:] Show!
[Spirit/Destiny:] Breaking through his imaginary wall
[Rage:] Fear!
[Spirit/Destiny:] Surrounding!
[Rage:] Near!
[Spirit/Destiny:] Pounding!
[Rage:] Hear!
[Liberty/Conscience:] Breaking!
[Spirit/Destiny:] Distress yourself
Accept your fate
Attend to it, don't hesitate
Ignore your fear, recall
back in time again
Now take this life
Be satisfied
This job is done, sense of delight
[Rage:] Your job is done my friend!!

[Part IV: On the run]

[Guitar Solo: Gerrit Schwerthelm]
[Keyboard solo: Marek Arnold]

[Zac:] Still I am on the run
So afraid and alone
I stay the course, uninjured
I a close the the cone

I deserve disgrace
But will win the race

On my own

[Death:] Be a man
Have a try
See me falling from the sky
Still I lodge my claim
Until the sun will rise

[Conscience:] The sun!
[Liberty:] Sun!
[Liberty/Conscience:] Will rise

[Death:] Fear my force
No remorse
The full rigor of my own law
I will satisfy my task today
So take your chance
But you can't run away

[Guitar Solo: Martin Schnella]

[Destiny:] Try to hide from your fate
You can never escape
I make sure, unsecured you'll belong to the late
At the crack of dawn
I'll live up my own name
Beware!

[Death:] Be a man
Have a try
See me falling from the sky
Still I lodge my claim
Until the sun will rise

[Conscience:] The sun!
[Liberty:] Sun!
[Liberty/Conscience:] Will rise

[Death:] Fear my force
No remorse
The full rigor of my own law
I will satisfy my task today
So take your chance
But you can't run away

[Part V: A World Of Make Believe]

[Liberty:] Can you hear the calling?
[Conscience:] Can you hear the calling?

[Love:] We, will always be bound forever
Full of love
And faith surrounds our minds
We can carry on in this way
Our souls will fall asleep
A world of make believe

[Spirit/Destiny:]
Adam fell asleep
And never woke up from this evil dream
It started with Elinoire
That little moment's how it all began
Silently he stares
Without a word at the naked walls
Surrounding him day by day
The time is fading
can't you see the dawn
