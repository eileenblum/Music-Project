[Guitar Solo: Brendt Allman]

[Zac:]
My camouflage's uncovered now
I have to act without delay
The only witness, Adam's dad
This addle cove did
not keep still

[Father:]
I let the cat
out of the bad
I cannot bare this shame
I took the bait in my vision
Far beyond the pale,
Into the jail

[Time:]
Over the years
You'll unearth the truth
Reversal of fortune has come

[Elinoire:] Out of the dark and into the light

[Death:] I annihilate the whole damn tribe

[Zac:] You dismissed all my warnings
You whimp, what made you think?

[Father:] Oh, I kept this secret much too long
My conscience's now been salved at last

[Death:] All hell broke loose, when suddenly
A girl began to scream
One single shot that hit the mark
Two birds with just one stone
Beyond belief

[Destiny / Spirit:] He shot them both
An evil blunder

[Time:]
Over the years
You'll unearth the truth
Reversal of fortune has come

[Elinoire:] Out of the dark and into the light

[Death:] I annihilate the whole damn tribe

[Guitar Solo: Martin Schnella]

[Past / Spirit:]
Enter the gate and satisfy yourself
Turn the wheel of fortune
He took the bait - had sworn an oath
But he broke his promise, Oh

[Guitar Solo: Andreas Schock]
[Guitar Solo: Martin Schnella]

[Time:]
Over the years
You'll unearth the truth
Reversal of fortune as come

[Spirit:] Another great

[Destiny / Spirit:] Burden of life

[Elinoire:] Out of the dark and into the light

[Death:] I annihilate the whole damn tribe
