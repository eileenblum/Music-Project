[Lea:]
I never told what I've ever known before
I kept it under my head
Just a pie in the sky
I distress my self
I feel the time has come to decide
Save my soul

[Lea:]
My dear I will confess my sins today
[Conscience:]
Today
[Lea:]
I choose to pray and go astray
[Conscience:]
Today
[Lea:]
Oh shall I follow you this day, please tell
[Conscience:] Your love forever
[Lea:]
I settle down and count to ten
[Conscience:] Again
[Lea:]	To pave the way, to be born again
[Conscience:] Again
[Lea:] Today I'll yield my love to you my child
[Zac:] Now do you remember me? I feel no sympathy for your helplessness
[Conscience:] Powerless impossible to change the past.
