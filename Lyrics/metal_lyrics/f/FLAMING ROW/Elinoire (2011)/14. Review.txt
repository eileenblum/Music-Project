[Past:] Once upon a time
She belonged to another heart
She was a child and unaware
But he was already a mature man
Her parents were against their love
But she didn't give a damn
That night she fell into his arms
And in the right moment he used his chance

Regardless of the consequences
They gave their fancy full scope
Some weeks went by, they became aware

The whole thing went out of control

For fear for her parents she aborted it
So she sealed her own destiny
As he become aware, no future, no gravidity
His love turned into animosity

[Time:] Take care before

[Destiny:] The circle is closed

[Time:] The time has changed and takes it's curse

[Father:] I must confess..
Oh, what a shame

[Guitar Solo: Martin Schnella]

[Destiny:] I carry on in my way
He didn't understand
They broke away from themself
But he couldn't accept his fate

[Lea:] Oh, he followed all my footsteps
And overstepped the mark
He was not able to suppress
This outlawed desire
He accompanied those people
Became a part of this crime
Together with this same age man
He actualized the plans

[Time:] Take care before

[Destiny:] The circle is closed

[Time:] The time has changed and takes it's curse

[Father:] I must confess...
Oh what a shame

[Sax Solo: Mark Arnold]

[Guitar Solo: Martin Schnella]

[Past:] Regardless of the consequences
They gave their fancy full scope

[Conscience:] Some weeks went by and they became aware
The whole thing went out of control
