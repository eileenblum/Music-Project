She took your only love, this parasite
Grabbed for her soul, you know
The result of your love

Now you have to realize, decide, no compromise
Lea died, you know
She's the gift of your love and your fate

Am I alone, what am I in for
Can you forgive me
Relieve me of this burden now

Slipping straight into a cage
You are captured in yourself
So baneful and ashamed
Flee from your perdition

Rage inside, roll the dice, compromise
Way of life, jack the knife, war of rage

You are the one, cold but wonderful
Searching for answers, he's blinded by rage
He laid the blame on you, Elinoire
So innocent and sweet, the rage of despair

For those who yearn, for my mistake
I'm so concerned, I cannot escape
The pillow in your hand, resolve your fear
Just be a man, let go
Please think twice, use your mind

Just what I have to claim
Inject poison straight into her veins, behold
She's your own flesh and blood, don't be blind

What have I done, I am not guilty
Please let me know how I can blow my pain away

Still you're captured in the cage
Break the walls, a ray of hope
Ignore the screams of rage
He tried to misled you

Rage inside, roll the dice, compromise
Way of life, jack the knife, war of rage

You are the one, cold but wonderful
Searching for answers, he's blinded by rage
He laid the blame on you, Elinoire
So innocent and sweet, the rage of despair

Devil in her soul, the devil takes control
Out of control, I can't revoke for the bitter
I can't decide, I blew my mind for the ripper

Act like a man, you have to complain
It won't be the same, you cannot revoke
A leap of faith, I cannot forsake
The devil he takes control of my mind

Out of control, I can't revoke for the bitter
I can't decide, I blew my mind for the ripper

Please let me know, I feel so sorry
Wounded by the fate's will
Occupy the moral high ground

Have you ever been aware
That you're captured in your rage
You plead for my advice, flee from your corruption

Rage inside, roll the dice, compromise
Way of life, jack of knife, war of rage

You are the one, cold but wonderful
Searching for answers, he's blinded by rage
He laid the blame on you, Elinoire
So innocent and sweet, rage of despair

So what may come, will he understand
She passed away, but she would never allow
He laid the blame on you, Elinoire
So innocent and sweet

Rage of despair, rage of despair
Rage of despair, rage of despair
