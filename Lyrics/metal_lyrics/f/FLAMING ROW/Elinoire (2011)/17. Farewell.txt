[Past:] Silence beats noises, inducted by life
And dust blew over, in memoriam
Till the end of time
Hi voice so silent, he's so ashamed
Low eyes are closed now
He won't forgive himself of what he did

[Spirit/Love:] Tears are just burning in your eyes
So painful again
Your fathers words, are vanished into thin air
(He) grabs for his soul
(He) rocks him to sleep
Behold!

[Elinoire:] I take to the skies, leave all my burdens behind

[Spirit:] Leave all your burdens behind

[Elinoire:] I crave for your warmth, encounter of mother and child

[Spirit:] Encounter of mother and child

[Elinoire:] You did not deserve

[Destiny:] You did not deserve

[Elinoire:] The fate of my birth

[Elinoire / Spirit:] Behold!
