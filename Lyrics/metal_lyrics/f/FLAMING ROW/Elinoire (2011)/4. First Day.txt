[Time:]
One warm summer day
in the garden of unison
once upon...
Two young faithful humans
Lived in peace and harmony
So in love

[Conscience:]
So he was just a man
In the prime of his life
A hard working man
their energy

[Spirit:]
Two young faithful
humans lived in peace
(they) invested all
Make believe
What a lucky man he was

[Destiny:]
And she was just a girl
So beautiful and treasured
Her eyes were filled,
Her eyes were filled
with stars

[Rage:]
Summer day...
Just a man in his prime...
Faithful people...
Just a girl, stars were
sparkling in her eyes

[Destiny:]
Invited all the relatives

[Time:]
To advertise a new born age
I pull the strings all over it,
you know

[Destiny:]
With your thoughts -
Always present
I'm forever on your side,
at all the time

[Love:]
Oh, forlorn hope
Watching all over you

[Destiny:]
It is time don't lose the way
Beware, don't fool about,
Don't you hear, your father
cries for you...

[Father:]
Come on son!
Don't keep us
suspense, again
Have a heart!
What has come over you?

[Destiny:]
Invited all the relatives.

[Time:]
To advertise a new born age
I pull the stings all over it,
You know.

[Spirit:]
So he was just a man
And she was just a girl

[Destiny:]
Within your thoughts -
always present
I'm forever on your
side at all the time

[Spirit/Destiny/Rage/Time/Love/Death:]
We've ever been on your
side the whole time, we
have ever been
We've ever been on your
side the whole time, we
have ever been
We've ever been on your
side the whole time, we
have ever been
We've ever been on
your side the whole
time, we have
ever been

[Rage:]
Elinoire's Tale!
