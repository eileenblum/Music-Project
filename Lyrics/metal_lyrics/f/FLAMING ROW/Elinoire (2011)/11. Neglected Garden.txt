Now I reach out for the garden you once loved
Feel my bitter breath, I'll execute my craft
I take fading things, oh that is my desire
Without conscience, without grave
Won't earn a penny to my name

Mist discovered from the valley down below
Oh, I can't feel your pain
I will, I will lodge my claim until the sun will rise
Beware 'cause it's my turn, and I will gear up for the show

Time and tide wait for no man, do you see
When the last grain of sand in the hourglass decays
If you don't change, my hope will die
Save your soul just remember, activate your mind

Like the last grain of hope in a desperate game of life
Leave behind this inane life, back to life again
But he remains, and he fills up his glass of wine
