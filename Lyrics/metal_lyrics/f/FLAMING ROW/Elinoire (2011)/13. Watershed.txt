[Past:]
Rage! Hate! Pain!
See for yourself
Rage! Hate! Pain!
See yourself

[Love/Spirit:]
Open your
mind. For the unpredict-
able change
All that you feel is
Anger and pain
Feeling betrayed
and forlorn

After a while
Nothings stays like
it has been before
Still disavow
Remember the days
Where all has begun
