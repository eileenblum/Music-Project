[Conscience:]
I've lined the gathering
Did I ever mention it before
I predict the story's end
Wait until hell freezes over

[Lea:]
My desire
We're so in love
In my heart

[Conscience:]
In their hearts

[Destiny:]
What will happen?
This game will change
up their lives
To come undone

[Lea:]
Exciting to keep them on
tenderhooks so long
In unsuspecting eyes reflects
candle light

[Lea/Spirit/Destiny:]
Let's start the dance
while the fireflies
are skipping in the sky
High so high

[Spirit/Destiny:]
Intoxicate the air

[Lea/Spirit/Destiny:]
This night has even
started to glow
until the morning
sun will grow
Why oh why

[Adam:]
From the bottom of my
heart bottom of my soul
We will never drift apart,
we are going with the flow
Have a nice day and let
the party begin
What we would like to say is
that something's on its way

[Destiny:]
What will happen?
This game will change
up their lives
To come undone

[Lea:]
Exciting to keep them on
tenderhooks so long
In unsuspecting eyes reflects
candle light

[Adam/Spirit/Destiny:]
Let's start the dance
while the fireflies
are skipping in the sky
High so high

[Spirit/Destiny:]
Intoxicate the air

[Adam/Spirit/Destiny:]
This night has even
started to glow
until the morning
sun will grow
Why oh why

[Guitar Solo: Martin Schnella]

[Destiny 2x:]
I've lined the gathering
Did I ever mention it before
(I) Predict the story's end
Wait until hell freezes over

[Lea/Spirit/Destiny:]
Let's start the dance while
the fireflies
are skipping in the sky
High so high

[Destiny:]
Intoxicate the air

[Lea/Spirit/Destiny:]
This night has even
started to glow
until the morning
sun will grow
Why oh why

[Spirit/Destiny 2x:]
I've lined the gathering
(I) Predict the story's end
