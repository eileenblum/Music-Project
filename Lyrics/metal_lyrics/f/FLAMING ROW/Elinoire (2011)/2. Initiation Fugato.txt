[Spirit:]
He is just a man
He's in the prime of life
For every day
Owns a fancy car
But a down to earth man
A treasured friend
Relieving tension when he

Sits in his garden
Listen's to the birds
and trees
Enjoy the silence
The busy bees
Their simple life
Captures him into a dream

Loved by his mum
And his dad
They are so proud
He is their only son
A lovely childhood
all the time
What he prayed for
Found his way of life
So untouchable
Hope, peace and luck
Perfect and smart
Just wanna find out
What life will bring for the
next procedure

[Destiny:]
She is just a girl
So beautiful and treasured
Eyes fulfilled with stars
She reminds him of
perfect clouds
Fairy tales on her way to
Pride and joy
But it's not easy to get

Quick a promotion
Each day in the lawyer's
firm. For every hour
The paper batch
Seems to be im-
Possible, for to complete
After the long working
day, Time to relax
Leisure activities
Athletic pretty angel
eye. For a long time

[Conscience:]
Cyrus, Adam's
dad. He is on a
friendly term with
All the alliance
Cracking jokes, he's
one of the kind
Brainpower his trademark
A helpful guy
Technical gifted but a-
Bit of a bad dog
Takes eternal 'till he gets
To a conclusion
There is no harm
'cause he's a depend-
able and honest man

[Season:]
Both, will have a child
The little wonder starts to move the arms and legs
Call her Elinoire what it means
Nobody should know.
It's a mystery the relatives would be put (off)

[Spirit/Destiny/Conscience/Season:]
Open your mind
For the unpredictable
change. Night after night
Touching he skin
He shelters the unborn life

[Season:]
Time after time
Nothing stays like it
has been before
He's not aware
Losing his love
Feeling of guilt deep
inside Elinoire's tale

[Spirit:]
Lea, what went wrong?
Have you lost your
will to live?
Anything went wrong, you
decided to pass away
There is no way out
Giving your life for
your own child,
meaning of love stands
for your pride
(You) carried your secret
For many weeks,
many months
Weeping just privily, oh
Rest in Elinoire's tale

[Conscience:]
Fate has no influence
new life is born
no love for his child
She's responsible
Rabidness is powerful
Is there anybody
who knows
How to take care of
oneself when he
Rests in Elinoire's tale
