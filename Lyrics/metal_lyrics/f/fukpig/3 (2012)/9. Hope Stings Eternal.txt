Destruction of my best-laid plans
The end of the noose is in my hand
Hope stings eternal

Hope stings eternally

All that I had has been denied
Forever in apology the story of my life
Hope stings eternal

The end result is agony
I hate my fucking self
Betrothed to disappointment
In sickness and ill health
