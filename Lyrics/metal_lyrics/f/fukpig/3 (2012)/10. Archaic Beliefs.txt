A lack of respect ingrained from birth
Developing into violence

Archaic beliefs
With no place in the modern world
A lack of education breeding aggression

Have your thought about fighting for love?
Is violence your only expression?

Bullshit macho posturing
Ill-informed and insecure

Archaic beliefs
With no place in the modern world
A lack of education breeding aggression

No regrets for the shit you spew
Led into hatred by blindness
A lack of respect ingrained from birth
Developing into violence

Archaic beliefs
With no place in the modern world
A lack of education breeding aggression

Have you thought about fighting for love?
Is violence your only expression?
Archaic beliefs with no place
In the modern world
