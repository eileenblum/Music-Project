The end of the world is upon us
Rain down apocalypse

Screaming at the sky
For the death of everything

If the final judgement is coming
We all deserve to burn

Screaming at the sky
For the death of everything

Screaming at the sky
For the death of everything
Leave it all behind
Cause there's fuck all worth keeping
Screaming at the sky
For the death of everything
Let it all fucking burn
Cause this world is weakening

Wipe out the snakes and the lizards
Watch the wolves burn in the fire
