With celebrity our only idols
Strive for a life you'll never achieve
Buy or be denied the chance of a perfect life

Unattainable ideals are all that you can see
Refuse, resist, reject all this shit
Don't let them dictate your own being

Martyr yourself to the adverts
Strive for a life you'll never achieve
When the role models for our children
Are all braindead morons
Strive for a life you'll never achieve

Unattainable ideals throughout society
