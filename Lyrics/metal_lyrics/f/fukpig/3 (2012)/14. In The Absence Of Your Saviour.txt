In the absence of your saviour
Who will you turn to now?
Just a million wandering sheep

In the absence of your saviour
Who will you turn to now?

In a world without religion
Who will you turn to now?
Nothing without your cross to bear

With noone there to keep you scared
Who will you turn to now?
Would your life just lose all meaning
With noone to whom you'd bow

In the absence of your saviour
Nowhere left to run
I've said it before and I'll say it again
Fuck you and fuck our son

In the absence of your saviour
Who will you turn to now?
Total death of god
