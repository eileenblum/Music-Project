Good morning, a new day of freedom
Get up, get those 9-5 shackles on
With a painted smile, you wander free
Oblivious to the robot you've become

Calculated tyranny - death to the new world order!
A cabal of villainry will forever pull the strings

Our voices insignificant and drowned out by the screams
Of a million dying dreams

Their evil secreted through every industry
Their roots laid deep over a century

Your freedom is a fable that they've led you to believe
As they watch your every move
While the master pulls the strings

We can't go on living
Freedom is bullshit
With Bilderberg nudges and masonic fucking winks
They're plotting the end of us all
