Just a mass of lowdown fucking hacks
Unethical methods to report your "facts"
Hacking into phones, scavaging through bins
Living oblivious to your immoral sins

Spying on the innocent and the weak
Just to get your story of the week
How very apt that to get to the sleaze
You're in the fucking rubbish
On your hands and knees

Hack away you fucking hacks
Your ghoulish practices
Will never fucking last

But its a sign of the times we live in
Society obsessed with reading stories
Of celebrity cunts and slags
Filled to the redtop of your favourite rag
