So armaggeddon is coming
Let's give it a fucking kiss
Just a world full of cunts, liars and scumbags
No reason to exist

If the time has come to end
The timings fucking right
Delight, delight in the dying of the light

Mother nature cries and weeps
Could it be her revenge?
As she looks on at what we've done
A justified end
