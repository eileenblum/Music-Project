With the streets on fire
And the cities ablaze
The scum is rising
The rats come out to play

We don't need to burn any buildings
We don't need to loot any shops
Just alcohol and necropunk
Is good enough for us

Yes we know that the country is fucked up
But we'll show it through different means

We don't need to burn any buildings
We don't need to loot any shops
Just alcohol and necropunk
And we'll have a fucking doss
