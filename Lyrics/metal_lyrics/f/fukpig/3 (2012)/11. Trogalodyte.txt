A trogalodyte fucking throwback
With the charm of a fucking slug

You're just a fucking neanderthal
When all is said and done
Did you stop evolving at the point
That you got your thumbs?

Doused in blood and vomit
Just a violent unevolved cunt

So do you really think that
The human race has reached its peak
And we've done all that it's possible to do
There's a constant evolution of the mind and the soul
But it's wasted on the likes of you
