The cycle of oppression
Has started up again

Who the fuck asked for you?
To rule over this nation
Where no one asked you to

The leaders that no one asked for
Democracy reset

Breaking all of your promises
Just to slither into power
With breathtaking arrogance
They take their handmade thrones
With the class of a common whore

A coalition of dead-eyed robots
Democracy reset
