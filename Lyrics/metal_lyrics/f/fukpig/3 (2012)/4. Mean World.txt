Terror 24-7, 42 inches wide
Global destruction in high definition
Conditioned to fear

It's scary out there
Don't leave your home
Just sit on your couch and purchase alone
Don't answer the door
Don't answer the phone
In case you develop views of your own
Don't answer the door
Don't answer the phone
Just sit on your couch and purchase alone
It's scary out there
Don't leave your home
Trapped inside a mean world

Output controlled and modified
Enraptured eyes mesmerised
The cathode rays massage your soul
Just a means for global control
Conditioned to fear

A rotten reflection of the world
Unblinking propaganda machine
Just a self chosen captive
Within these four walls
And you don't ever want to break free

Terror 24-7, 42 inches wide
The cathode rays massage your soul
Just a means for global control
Conditioned to fear
