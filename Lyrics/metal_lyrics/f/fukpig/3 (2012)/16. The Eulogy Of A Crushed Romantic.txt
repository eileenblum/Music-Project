This fucking rock, populated
By self-obsessed cunts
Nothing left to live for
Nothing left for me
Wishing the world was a better place
A place it'll never be

This fucking rock
Riddled with liars and whores
Selfish egomaniacs
I've nothing in common with you

Fuck this fucking rock
I'm here by accident
Just like the rest of you
Blow this fucker up
I won't miss a single one of you

Are these the words of
A hopeless cynic or the eulogy
Of a crushed romantic?

Misery â Music
Drunk â Vocals
