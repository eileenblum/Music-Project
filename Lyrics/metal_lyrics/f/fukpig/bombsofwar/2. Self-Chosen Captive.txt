Safe from a world of harm
In your seat so far away
Can't see further than the end of your nose
To sit &amp; watch is what you've chose
Insular species - self-chosen captive
Within your four walls
TV set your only shield
Gives you everything you need
Never with a thing to say
No feelings anyway
Numb to the outside world
