Stealing wonder from eyes of innocents
To satisfy your sickening lust
Taking the life of a family's angels
Reducing the young to a life of sick shame
How can the victims ever recover?
When every coving touch makes them shudder
We must purge this filth from our streets
What kind of world can allow this evil
To happen almost every day?
