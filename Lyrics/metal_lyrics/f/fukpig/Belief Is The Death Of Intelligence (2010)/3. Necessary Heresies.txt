Chewing on fucking gravel
With a boot in the back of my skull

Will somebody help me?
Will nobody save me?
Stabbed in the back
With the end of your fucking hook

Just a drooling mouthful
Of dead fucking rats

What we did to you
What we put you through
The games we made you play
All necessary heresies
To get where we are today
