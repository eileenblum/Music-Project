Pathetic, ridiculous
Not a thought to be found
Not enough IQ
To go around

Dawn of the dumb

Gormless, ludicrous
Just a virus in shoes
Claiming independence
Being told what to choose

Dawn of the dumb

You'd take a faceful of cum everyday
If you were told it was good for your health
And when you find that last braincell of yours
Use it to kill yourself
