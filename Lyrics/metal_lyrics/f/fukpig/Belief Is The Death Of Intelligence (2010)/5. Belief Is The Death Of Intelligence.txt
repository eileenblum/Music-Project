Acceptable mass thought control
Your web entwined around us all
A nation begs for sedation
Base your life on works of fiction

I won't bow down to anyone
Fuck you and fuck your son

Mass processed blind reverence
How dare you try to think for yourself
The blood shed in this name
Your God would hang his head in shame

How many deaths in your defence?
Belief is the death of intelligence
