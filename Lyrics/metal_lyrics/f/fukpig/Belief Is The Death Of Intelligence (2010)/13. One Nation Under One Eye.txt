They're all in this together
And still you think you're safe

Our leaders conspire
They lead us to die
One nation under one eye

I'm sick of being lied to
And I won't take it anymore!

Our leaders conspire
They lead us to die
Leading our rights to the slaughter
Fuck your evil new world order
