In a world where everyone's to blame
As the rich line their pockets with your pain

The jaws are open wide
Increasing with your screams
All fall upon your knees
To feed the greed machine

The putrid stench sticks inside your throat
The devils in suits cast the final vote

Waiting to pounce and steal your dreams
Just wolves with cunts clothing
