Want a picture of the future?
The boot is stomping down
Crowd control with a baton
Under surveillance lens

The media points its active volume down on our cries
Using our young as a front for martial law
Right before your eyes

Just the opening they needed
Send in the heavy guns
Our pleas fall on deaf ears
The foot is stomping down

Just one of a thousand ways,
To steal your dignity
Just one of a thousand ways,
To steal your liberty
