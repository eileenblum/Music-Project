A mans soul divided into two
World left in ruins
Black and white dimensions

Running from reflections
Questions with no answers
Uncontrolled mind
Chaos runs wild
Drawn closer to death
Eulogy imprinted on dead hearts

Burning into ashes

Fear the cause of failure
Weakness suffocates the will
Dare to be led by fools
In the plagued maze

Burning into ashes

Scars build on scars
In this cursed life
All of my
Scars build on scars
In this cursed life

Dumbfounded by fake smiles
I'm bleeding the truth
Unrelenting pain
World of misery
Drawn closer to hell
Terrified of what remains

Scars build on scars
In this cursed life
All of my
Shattered dreams
Fall upon
Silent screams
Left upon
Useless beings
What is this we are seeing?

Purgatory
