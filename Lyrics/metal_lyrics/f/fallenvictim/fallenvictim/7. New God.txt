Cross the line for eternal sin
I am the evil that lives within
Your fucking head give me your soul
I'll give new life give all control
Do what you want do as you please
Don't live this life of misery
They'll preach to you such vicious lies
Renounce the book it's your demise

I am the one put trust in me
They lead a life of bigotry
If you confide I'll bring you truth
Endless pleasures, all for you
The holy cross is not our choice
For all the times we've heard the voice
Impelling you, the holy man
Door to door with book in hand

I am new god

These pages cannot be our guide
Leave them on the other side
Follow me defy your role
I'll give new life give all control
Do what you want do as you please
Don't lead this life of misery
They have preached such vicious lies
Renounce the book and join our side

I am new god
