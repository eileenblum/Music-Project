Move into darkness
Look upon dead eyes
Time stands still
For tormented cries

The goodnight prayer
Catches the nightmare
Forsake all faith
Heaven is not out there

For sacrificial suicide
The book forsees your sick demise
Living through obscurity
This life will be the death of me

Faith, such an empty feeling
That brings me to my knees
Reality
Eats away at me

There's no escape from this
The choice to hate is made
It welcomes me to the sin

For sacrificial suicide
The book forsees your sick demise
Living through obscurity
This life will be the death of me

Souls ablaze
Pure dismay
Lead astray
Eternal hate

Ostracize
Hollow cries
I despise
Your world of lies
