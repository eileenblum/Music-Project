Awake to this nightmare
Blind Leading the Blind
Grab wings of despair
Downfall of mankind

To cast our shadows
Worlds will collide
Days of reckoning
Death is sublime

Murdering race
Nations disgrace
Find new faith
Find new hate
Spill the blood
Start the fight
War is born
Forever Mourn

Fallen state of mind
Now fade away
Can't kill myself
Gain through dismay
Feed the death cult
Rape and pillage
Bloodsoaked and torn
Killing the unborn

Murdering race
Nations disgrace
Find new faith
Find new hate
Spill the blood
Start the fight
War is born
Forever Mourn

The death of man is inequity
Lifeless soulless, pain, suffer...
The fall of mankind

Find new faith
Find new hate
Find new faith
Find new hate
