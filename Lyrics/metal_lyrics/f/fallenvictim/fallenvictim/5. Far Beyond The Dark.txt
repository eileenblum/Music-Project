Advancing through the stages of decay, the pieces rot
No longer hope for preservation
It seems the earth has had its fucking way with me
Leaving only fraying threads of contention

Decomposing flesh
I'm falling apart between intentions and realism

Not feeling day or night
Numb and deadened to the light
The cost payed by the distant

Another wave approaches steadily, looming over
This endless cycle wears me thin
These burdens stripped away all that I am today
A spirit beaten to waste

Decomposing flesh
I'm falling apart between intentions and realism

Not feeling day or night
Numb and deadened to the light
The cost payed by the distant

What's Impossible to breach
What's completely out of reach
No longer a mystery

A nightmare realized and lived out
Until the moment of insufferable pain
Lapsing far beyond the dark
To a place where none remain
A minute passed is a century
No identity, hope or reason to be
Eternity spent locked in a void affords a chance to rot again
