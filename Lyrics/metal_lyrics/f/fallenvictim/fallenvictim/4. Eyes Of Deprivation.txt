Broke the hand that feeds me
To starve myself for the truth
Unwrap my wound
To bring this pain to the surface

Sinking to abrasion
Grinding down the skin
The blood can hit the floor now
That I have peered within

Deprivation
Through eyes of
Deprivation
Life is defined

Closed off the air around me
Quick trip to the bottom line
I've now gone beyond this world agreed upon
I see
The people
Through eyes of deprivation

Somewhere along the way were some bones to break
Shattered like comfort in the wake of this pain
In vision I've aquired as a gift for being curious
Diversions of our lives becoming achromic

Deprivation
Through eyes of
Deprivation
Through eyes of
Deprivation
Through eyes of
Deprivation
Life is defined
