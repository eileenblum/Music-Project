Transported miles from my home
Replicate things that you know
Half life automation on repeat
As a voice came on the fifty foot high screen

No reaction
And no sign
There's no time
To rectify
Anxiety reducer
No one else around
Anxiety reducer
You'll never touch the ground

So called human fiber recognized
A struggle, willing blow from inside
Calculate your footsteps second lifetime
Reborn on the day everything has died

No reaction
And no sign
There's no time
To rectify
Anxiety reducer
No one else around
Anxiety reducer
You'll never touch the ground
