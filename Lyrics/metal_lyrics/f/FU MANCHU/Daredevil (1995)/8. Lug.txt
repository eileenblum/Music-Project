this rooster tail
aint layin' no eggs
I aint got enough
to fill it with unless
not quite as high
as an elephants eye

Dust city alright
Ranchero 7.... 5

How High?
Like a thrillride [x2]

three in the tree
or four on the floor
who loves ya baby
worth its weight in gold
no daily driver
haul ride and rack
sending heavy smokescreen
out of a supertrap

How High?
Like a thrillride [x2]

Long arm trying to hold the line
Backwoods burnin it just fine
