Up on the blocks
cause Ive been hearin' it knock I said..
over and over again

And in my hand,
got oil straight from the pan

Pullin' to the right.. be workin all night
I said, Over and over again

feeling just fine
five for a dime
feeling just fine

five for a dime [5 balls for a dime -- in 70's pinball]

and there he goes.. yea only daredevil knows
gotta wired to a higher sound
way above the ground

'round the next turn im shue Ill burn
im lost and found

feeling just fine
five for a dime
feeling just fine
five for a dime
