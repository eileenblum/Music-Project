I drove a duster.. to the edge of the world
Like nothing from nowhere.. tank ridin' full
Its a deep sea sound.. passin' right by
Cause I was drivin'... one more time

Lets see which one I can get
Still the best one I seen yet..

I only see.. what I want to see
I only hear.. what I want to hear
A barracuda let down..super shift it high
Cause I was flashin' ....one more time

Lets see which one I can get
Still the best one I seen yet..
