Stickin to the road.. like glue to your fingers
Sheet metal mold, in the shape of tommorow
Its been a long time... and Im right
Sandblast the rest and borrow

Feet dont fail me now..
I need more.. show me how

Every night at sunrise.. bright lights shinnin in my eyes
I gotta leave cause theres no way to go
And outside lined in a row

Feet dont fail me now..
I need more.. show me how

If I could.. I would
And I know.. I should
