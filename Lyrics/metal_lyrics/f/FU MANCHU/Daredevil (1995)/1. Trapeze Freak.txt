Workin' on a rusted out '65
Startliner got a quarter to nine
Glue foot - yeah he's stuck on the floor
That's all there is
There ain't no more

Daredevil takin' too much time
SnakeRiver blastin' rocket ride
To the sky said a friend of mine
With some help and my extra wides..

Headin' 90 on a 13
Hey man do you know what I mean?
Silver streak runnin' down my side
In the bushes - better hide!

Super cruiser [x2]

Catalogue got a sell on 9
I dont know, take five
Flat tire, and a busted hose
Where she stops know one knows ..

Super cruiser [x2]
