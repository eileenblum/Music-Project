Three in the front, got three in the back
side by side headin' down to the track
kentucky green from a hand to hand
what do you mean you dont understand?
(hey scott.. I dont understand)

Under a mountain came a shining light
been shaking for days and night
Spinning faster reaching out my hand
What do you mean you don't understand?

All I see
a bright green [x2]
