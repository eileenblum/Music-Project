Super Cassanova
He's on the road again
Eye'n the sheep honey
won't you be my friend?

Sign up ahead ..it read
Stop and start again

[Chorus:]
Here she comes
I see her comin'
Right on
Engines humming
Eatin' Dust
and double clutchin

cement peelin' and im feelin'
road hoggin it
foots itchin and im missin'
gotta run again
with a head of gold, im told..
rubber leggin it

[Chorus x2]
