Twenty miles off the ground
Flyin' faster than the speed of sound
maybe catch ya next time around

I'm settin' my eye
chromoly shes startin to shine
Last time I got quite a surprise

I must be dreamin'
I don't know what I'm seein'
And nobody's buyin'
Man am I tryin' [x2]

Tackin' miles to the end of time
I know this whole road is mine
Leavin' tracks for the rest at night

so far.. this ride is nothing new..
Ive tried to befor what can I do?
Let me know before the ride is through

I must be dreamin'
I don't know what I'm seein'
And nobody's buyin'
Man am I tryin'
