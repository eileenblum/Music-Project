Sedate it ain't acid forging the road 
Im Chasin' worlds a million miles to go 
Someone done ya evil-know 

a so long   
a so long 
a so long 

Straight ride from the face on moon 
I know what this means.. but how 'bout you? 
From a passin' said they'll be there soon *yea (Scott adds "yea" in the live show) 

a so long 
a so long 
a so long 

Ten miles of  fucked-up road 
Solar burnin' things have turned to stone 
Ready for the next time they show
