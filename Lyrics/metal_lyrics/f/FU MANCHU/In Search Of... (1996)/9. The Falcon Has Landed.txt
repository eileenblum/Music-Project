Well I dropped twenty-five 
And I lost mine 
Countin' down  or head straight to the sky 

I seen-side 
There in no time 
Soarin'-high 
A star shoutin' nine 

The falcon has landed..it's shinin' and sanded 
The falcon, it's grounded..that right where..I found it. 

The first of its kind 
In our space and time 
Waitin' out side 
The second ride 

I see inside 
There in no time 
Soarin'-high 
A star shoutin' nine 

The falcon has landed..it's shinin' and sanded 
The falcon, it's grounded..that right where..I found it 

On a hell bent journey to the center of the earth (the earth the earth the earth) 
Twin can freaks, payin' what it's worth (its worth its worth its worth) 
Haulin' and crawlin, changers on it's way  (its way its way its way) 
Mars attack risin', now it's too late  (too late too late too late) 

Well I dropped twenty-five 
And I lost mine 
Countin' down-headin' straight to the sky 

I seen inside 
There in no time 
Soarin'-high 
A star shoutin' nine
