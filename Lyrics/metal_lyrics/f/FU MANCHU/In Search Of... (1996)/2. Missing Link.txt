Crushing down the top of a motoring so 
watch the road fold 
Eighteen hell wheeler cryin' out for more 
everybody knows.. 
Center divide everything to the right 
before I go.. 
Hand full of nothing from inside 
ready roll! 

Up from the floor a moment or more 
Did I win a sure bet, I wanted to get 
Stand lazy remote four 

What can I say thing are goin' my way.. accelerate!! 
Let it run so I can get up and go-wheel pullin more 
See yourself risin' on a screen that's shown.. I live for 
Clear as night for the 100th time-breakin all 

Up from the floor a moment or more 
Did I win a sure bet, I wanted to get 
Stand lazy remote four
