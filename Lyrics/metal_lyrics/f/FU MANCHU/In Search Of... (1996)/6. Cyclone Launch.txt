Left in the dust to sit down 
How do you I get this heap out of here 
A sharp cut on a dust row 
Im Looking down it's now quite clear 
Overloadin 
a full hand 
Wire-fry a belt blown drive 
Haymaker a quick turn 
Holy-roller say goodbye 

I knew you'd seen it my way 
Ain't got anymore today 

Forever gone is a skyride 
Circle the world.. it's a long time 
Eliminate all highway 
I got me a course in mind 
Burn like a mule throw 
Watch a nova come alive 
Sun burnin' a hole down 
Hand movin' sink with time 

I knew you'd seen it my way 
Ain't got anymore today
