I've got a pair rollin' from my hand
I'm diggin' deep getting on as planned

I've got this number runnin' through my head
Say the word tell me where and when
I move in motion i can see it clear
Just get in and drive me out of here

I've got a pair rollin' from my head
I'm diggin' deep getting on as planned

I swear I got a lever hooked to the right
Hell on wheels since the start of time
Last word heard and I've got mine
Hung on the wall swinging mechanized

Come and gone blast away the sight
Melted down, all right
Back seat driver seein' through my eyes
Up from the ground
That's right
[repeat]
