Knock-down loaded 
Asphalt rollin' 
Can you do me one better 
With a magnified header 

I feel nothin'-I feel it all the time 
I feel nothin'-doin' just fine 

Ya knew all along 
Pushed out of that arm 
One-hundred and fifty 
Will do you no wrong 

I feel nothin'-I feel it all the time 
I feel nothin'-doin' just fine 

For the longest time 
Been ridin' so slow 
Gear grindin' I didn't know 

Lend me and you are
I can see so far
