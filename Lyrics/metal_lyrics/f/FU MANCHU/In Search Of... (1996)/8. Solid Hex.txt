Runnin' a motor live-shoot through in time 
Hustle a fortune give-straighten the side 
Chort movin all-burnin' in mind 
Well past the start-I'm given' up this time 

I know...right on time 
I know...checkin' the line 
I know...right on time 
I know... 

Sit there in hiber sound-spacin' a fall 
Burnin' a handle thin-don't mind at all 
Believe I seen it now-leavin with more 
With all of them wrong-still givin' ya for 

I know...right on time 
I know...checkin' the line 
I know...right on time 
I know...
