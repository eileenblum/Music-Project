I've got a full board on a frame in the yard 
Ive got a half grown, and I ain't going far 
With a hurst shift...gettin' me into four 
And a hand full-I'll be needin' more 

Of a super sea 
a super sea
a super sea is what I need 

Straight off the line...Im better every time 
Pulled a left lane...supercharged it fine 
Took a fourth try...to a star at right 
Pushed a button for...a ride into the sky 

I've got a full board on a frame in the yard 
Ive got a half grown, and I ain't going far 
With a hurst shift...gettin' me into four 
And a hand full-I'll be needin' more
