Ridin' high 
Seein' far beyond this time 
Speed demon rollin'.. to the tune of ninety-five 
Through another mountain ...barracuda on my side 
I heard this story told 
'Bout a half a million time 

Eight feet wide 
Burnin' a path half it's size 
Gone without a trace 
Surveying all mankind 
Full-speed ahead 
I Hear it start to grind 
Never heard a sound 
Like it in my life 

Im movin' in a freak show [Or... "Im living in a freak show"]
I sink down low 
Got a rail ridin' 
Im King of the road!!!
