This is what you needed babe how too 
This is what you need.. 

Keep right had so 
Slo-motion roll 
Seein' for yourself 
Layin' low o' well 
Split the road in two 
Still more to do 
It's goin' on and on 
It's goin' on and on 

This is what you needed babe how too 
This is what you need.. 

I heard the sound 
Goin' round 
I Transfixed mine 
a more every time 
Hands ten and four 
Got to get more 
Easy -ridin' down 
Final highway bound 
This is what you needed babe how too 
This is what you need..

Thanks to eyesee7 for correcting track #1 lyrics.
