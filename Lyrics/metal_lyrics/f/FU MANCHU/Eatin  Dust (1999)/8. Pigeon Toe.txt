2 wheels a rollin'
Locates the deal
Suddenly awoken
Scrapin the wheel

Lost out and over
Short length of ride
Everyone is certain
Everything is all right

Wrong place and the right time
Ride high and low
Left for good
We'll never know

Can you see by the tracks left
Dust settles slow
So we all bow down
PIGEON TOE!

First few were a get down
Fast times and all
So out of nowhere
They began to haul

Rollin through the flatlands
End of day
It too bolts upright
Or so they say

Through many dirt rides
A blown 4-O-2
Chrome shinnin mighty
We already knew

Can you see by the tracks left
Dust settles slow
So we all bow down..
PIGEON TOE
