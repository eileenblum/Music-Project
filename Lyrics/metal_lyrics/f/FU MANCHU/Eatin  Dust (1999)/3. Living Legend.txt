Ride taken its toll
Non believers gather for
On a slow motion high road
Off course they go
Lord of the motor rise
Static shinnin televised
Hundred years back again
Hundred more till the end

Like I told you before
From the middle of the world

We heard the word and were gone
Legend read be warned
Quick arrival from above
Foot down not enough
Torn through the edge of some
Starting where it begun
Overburn rushin to.. on foot make it through
