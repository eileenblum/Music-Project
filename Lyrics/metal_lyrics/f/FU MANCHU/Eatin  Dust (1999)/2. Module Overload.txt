Right by a satellite... we went out of control
A hundred feet... in front of me
Back up we go
A weeks like a time spent.. leaving it alone
Ya cant get there from here... I heard em say
Up from where we were
And I'm sure.. been there before

Cutting through the field... like a sea
Head beneath it all
Hands off the wheels... start the ride
Heading to the wall
Hypnotize... from the light
Nothing like we seen
Can you show us the way... light the fee
Holdin what we need
And I'm sure.. been there before

Straight down... straight down
We'll drive it right... into the ground
It's a module overload
