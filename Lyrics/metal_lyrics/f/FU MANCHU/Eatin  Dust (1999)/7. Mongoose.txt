Look inside.. the day started right
A back road in a dirt town lives.. all time
Slowly turns.. signals high.. what happens next
All time

The mongoose flies

Removed from the times
Event for the eyes
Mid day they gathered one by one
All time

The story lies behind.. the mongoose flies on by
Out on the street they ride.. the mongoose flies on by
