The road demon sees... spinnin last.. four speeds
Convoy says lets roll!
Innerstate... time to go!
King of the mountain screams... pedal down.. seven three
Driver rolled his eyes... search light... they shine

Land controller
All seer.. All knower
Dual freak lies... headfirst downside
Its overblown.. by now.. they know
5 miles to go... in 20 years.. they'll show

Engines die down...
Slow paced.. low ground
Crowd gathers near... what they saw.. what they hear
Had a job to do.. right side.. straight through
The light starts to rise.. some left.. hell of a ride
