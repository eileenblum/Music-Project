The motor burns it slow
Gas-hog flyin' on its own
I could tell by the glow
The sign says Dead End
We saw it up ahead
It took all day to get this far
No turnin' back my friend

[Chorus: x2]
Breathing Fire
Oh No Still got a way to go

East bound Oh-high- Oh
Late model GTO
Sun sets as I close my eyes
All systems go!

We never thought this day would end
Night closes in
We hear the all familiar sound
No turnin' back my friend

[Chorus x2]
