The wise man, he tells me my future
i know why, he says this I've seen it too.
Time flies, I stand still yeah he knew
Slow moving, ride past me they go through

Come through!

All eyes, fixed there right through me
My head down eyes focussed I can't see
Everyone says take it slow
I'll be going in alone

These are the things, I need to know
Last word, last time, been written in stone
These are the things, I need to know
Last word, last time, been written in stone

I reach for the one thing, I see three
The wise man he told me I break free

Everyone says take it slow
I'll be going in alone

These are the things, I need to know
Last word, last time, been written in stone
These are the things, I need to know
Last word, last time, been written in stone

All this time, right before my eyes
The wise man was wrong
It was all a lie (it was all a lie!)

These are the things (these are the things)
I need to know (I need to know)
Last word last time (last word last time)
Been written in stone (been written in stone)
These are the things (these are the things)
I need to know (I need to know)
Last word last time (last word last time)
Been written in stone (been written in stone)
