You turn off your mind
Now you can see
I slowly move around
They're staring right at me
I look far and wide as they ride(?) me two's and three's
I try ro signal someone to make them believe

End of the line
For the last time
But still i try to -
Make them believe
Everything I see
Make them believe
Everything I need to be
Make them believe
Everything I see
Make them believe
Make them believe

I fail but i try
See what there is to see
Our reaper will damn
Crowling up our knees
I hear a familiar sound
It now makes sense to me
The last chance i get to make them believe

End of the line
For the last time
But still i try to -
Make them believe
Everything I see
Make them believe
Everything I need to be
Make them believe
Everything I see
Make them believe
Make them believe

End of the light
End of the light
End of the light
End of the light

End of the line
For the last time
But still i try to -
Make them believe
Everything I see
Make them believe
Everything I need to be
Make them believe
Everything I see
Make them believe
Make them believe
