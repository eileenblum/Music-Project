Voice calls me yet again
I pray the sound never ends
Noise ringing in my head
Telling to go where and when

Action is fast and loud
Slowly rising from the ground
My hands reaching for air
Can bearly hear a sound

Voice calls me yet agian
I pray the sound never ends
Noise ringing in my head
Telling to go where and when

The light it blinds my eyes
It's far and it's deep and wide
The light it burns my mind
I swear I'll be all right

The light further outside
I think I missed all mine
I try and try and try
Changing before my eyes

The light it blinds my eyes
It's far and it's deep and wide
The light it burns my mind
I swear I'll be all right, right.

Voice calls me yet agian
I pray the sound never ends
Noise ringing in my head
Telling to go where and when

The light it blinds my eyes
It's far and it's deep and wide
The light it burns my mind
I swear I'll be all right

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
