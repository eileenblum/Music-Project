well I have seen your face
I heard you call my name
I know it's hard to believe
just wait until you see
well I send you right back
I know what you're talking about
identical marks with me
we follow them all the way

I hang on
we've been moving for so long

so after we refuel
chase just like you do
so many towns we pass
destination here at last

I hang on
we've been moving for so long

back and forth again
seamless signs from wind
steel hot on our trail
tried to outrun but failed

I hang on
we've been moving for so long
