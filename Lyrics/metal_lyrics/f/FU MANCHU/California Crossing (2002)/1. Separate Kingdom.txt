I see right to,
my seperate kingdom,
I lead you to,
your certain freedom,
Ill be there soon,
where i have seen them,
Im on my way,
to my seperate kingdom

First time in years,
facing something for your worst fear,
mothership so high,
so what for the knees we rise

Round and down,
and round we go,
to this place i do not know,
A sudden turn,
and quick to learn,
of our future

I see right to,
my seperate kingdom
I lead you to,
your certain freedom

Scrabbed in alone,
being waiting for years to go,
better keep from the side,
or bit to the world unknown

(Twice)Round and down,
and round we go,
to this place i do not know,
A sudden turn,
and quick to learn,
of our future,
Around and down,
and round we go,
The time is place to land of known,
miles to past,
here at last,
in our future

I see right to,
my seperate kingdom,
I lead you to,
your certain freedom,
Ill be there soon,
where i have seen them,
Im on my way,
to my seperate kingdom
