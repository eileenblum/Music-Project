Twenty years or more
We had a plan
To build the finest street ride
In the whole damn land
Some dip down for keys
Some cheater slicks
Metal bars and a holley
Just for kicks

Happenin' since the dawn of time
Big block will shut you down, off the line
In California... there is no stopping
In California... the California Crossing

We didn't know
Couldn't foresee
Cold blooded snake
Building up heat

Tries to fly but it's no use
Cobra's got the bird, and it's loose
In California... there is no stopping
In California... the California Crossing

Inbetween runs
Through oil and smoke
Thought to myself
Did we ever choke?

Happenin' since the dawn of time
Big block will shut you down, off the line
Tries to fly but it's no use, it's no use!
There is no stopping
California... the California crossing
In California... there is no stopping
In California... the California crossing
