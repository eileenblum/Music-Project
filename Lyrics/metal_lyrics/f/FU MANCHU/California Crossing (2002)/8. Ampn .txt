Tried my hardest to search for the weakness
I planned for years but now I see so clear
I seen the line of a thousand points to light
Impossible you say, and I know it's my time

And here's where we get up and go
Ampin' ought-ta know
The further we dig that whole
Ampin' ought-ta know

Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know

So wake up there friend, we've heard it all before
And on their way is what we're waiting for

And here's where we get up and go
Ampin' ought-ta know
The further we dig that whole
Ampin' ought-ta know

Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know

At first I thought this ride was so slow
Sounds an easy problem we know
Take down where we started to glow
And we blow it on the way back home

Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know
Ought-ta know
Ampin' ought-ta know
Ampin' ought-ta know
Ampin' ought-ta know
