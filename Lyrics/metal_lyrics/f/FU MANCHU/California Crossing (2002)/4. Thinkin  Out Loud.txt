A day unlike I have seen,
No sound, no smell,
Know what I mean?
Now I'll see what today will bring.

Earth opens wide,
Swallows me whole.
I slide to where I do not know,
The end of life as I've known.

[Chorus:]
Cus I've been..
Searching for something,
Down here,
Thinking out loud.
Wating for nothing,
My mind's been
Thinking out loud.

I end up where I began,
Or is this part of the plan?
I slowly turn my head around..

[Chorus x2]

I walk alone,
The town is dry.
I recall [profit/prophet from/filled?] the sky
Earth opened wide, swallowed me whole,
So on and on I go...

[Chorus x2]
