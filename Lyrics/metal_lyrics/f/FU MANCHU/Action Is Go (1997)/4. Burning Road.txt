Circle the world
And Fly by night
I had a hunch
Why did they try..?
42 days long
Turbines had fried
Impossible
Genius says alright! [or "Gene has said alright..."]

[Chorus:]
Burning Road
Seen more than they  know
Burnin' road
On and on they roll

Center space has gone
Keepin' a straight line
El Camino soars
Disappeared from sight
Big block made news
Try to analyze
The pressure crew
Genius says alright!

[Chorus]

Waiting for
Close at hand
I think you're right
Now what's your plan
A few hours passed
Now lost sight
Ask me again
Genius says alright!

[Chorus]
