Awhile down's been left in the dust 
All through the town 
A' Several years since we seen them near 
It's the dying sound! 
Divide the time on another ride 
Forget the sign... 
I do believe when they say shift down 
Guardrail to the right 

Been 15 times .. I never holded the line 
A fever speed on them .. startin over again
