Half moon closer to arriving through
More than a week ago...
Bet ya can't ride the highway of size
Follow that take it too
In the valley of nine... landed right
Nothing left to do
Knee'n deep in the ground... understand
Yea we'll drive it through

No trace found
Unknown machine
No trace found
They cleared everything!

Formation sighted by two...outside the range we've known
Since then I been to where...from the horizon its shown
Slight collision repairs the seam...loss fuel at me
Engine running on 20 years, nothing like it seems!

[Chorus]

and ive seen it with my eyes
gonna be there one more time
smoke dust up from the side
burned into my mind
and i see em with my eye
