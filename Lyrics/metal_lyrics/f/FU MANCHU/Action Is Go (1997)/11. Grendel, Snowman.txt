Casts his shadow miles across the sun
Keepin' them in sight when they run
All of a sudden we hear the 4 send
Trackin' 50 feet above my head

[Chorus]
Like we seen it so... there it goes [x2]

Beam in grip - for years
never found... we here
taking giant strides upright
no remains, they die

[Chorus]
un-iden-ti-fied [repeated till end]
