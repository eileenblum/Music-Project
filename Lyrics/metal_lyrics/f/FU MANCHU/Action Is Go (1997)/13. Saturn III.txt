Spacemen destroy...mega asteroids
Certain time and place
Floatin' out to space
4 billion years to cross
Universe so vast
For several days they tried
This will never last

[Chorus]
Saturn 3 takes hold...losing all control

In the second stage...life returns for now
The huge ship has climbed...they'll make it somehow
Reducin' their speed..the message passed
What are they up against
Time to release the hatch!

The silence group strikes
Something has appeared
Recheck a report
Just as we feared..
A closer visit planned
Way beyond our reach
When the smoke has cleared
Gather for the speech..
