You obey the rules and you play the fool
As the others benefit
Walls close in as we begin
Alone is where you'll sit

Another place, another time
Heard it all before
Laugh out loud, the ones around
Time to even the score

I pray for the day someone takes this away
And I say so long, so long, again and again

I pray for the day someone takes this away
And I say so long, I say so long, again and again

Stay inside, count the times
Doors open wide
I think you'll see what the others mean
Others disagree

Taking less as you regret
The ties severed clean
Hands extend, nearing the end
Exactly what it means

I pray for the day someone takes this away
And I say so long, I say so long, again and again

I pray for the day someone takes this away
And I say so long, I say so long, again and again

Take it away [repeat]
