Built on a huge fort - that much I know
Maybe a good deal - hard to find
Location unknown - again this time

[Chorus:]
Keepin' the road clear
Hang at the back
Old Miss River
We see at last
Invisible
Has seen it fall
And 10 times over
That ain't all

Eliminate - and move on through
Learn from the master - like we knew
Early morning hour - time drew close
Over the top - that much we know

[Chorus]

Again they roll on and on
Hotdoggin' [x4]
