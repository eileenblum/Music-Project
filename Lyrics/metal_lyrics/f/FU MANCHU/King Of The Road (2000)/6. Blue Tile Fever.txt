Takin' the next run
Rollin' right by
Takin' the last one

[Chorus: x2]
So look the other way That's what we heard 'em say
Blue Til.e Fever [x2]

It's brand new-like I told you
No one's seen - the things that they do
Hear the words - and know what they know
The crowd splits - wherever they go

It's all brand new - just like I told you [x2]

A grind back at the far end
Signs posted for all of you
Things were alright just when
Now here's what we're gonna do

[Chorus]
