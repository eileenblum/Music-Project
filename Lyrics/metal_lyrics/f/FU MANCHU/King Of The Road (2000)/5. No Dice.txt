No time-like now---Straight down
Mountainside---They went-they tried
Overload-2 down---I know
Bright green light---I seen-full flight

[Chorus:]
No shoes-No shirt-No dice

I might know---Full view--we're told
Sounds allright/High fly---Down 9
Strange machine/This time---It climbs
I know where---Southbound-they said

[Chorus x4]
