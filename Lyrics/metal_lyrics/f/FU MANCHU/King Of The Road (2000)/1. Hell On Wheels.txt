Cut yourself off from the pack
Flat out against the freaks
There's nothin' they won't try
Hot head - heavy foot they meet
It's been so many days
And we tried every way
We knew of a Masterplan
So put the keys in my hand

In my hand [x2]

At a time when you would think
All of a sudden it hits the streets
As they're swappin' the big block
Slow-motion - time has stopped
El Camaro never dies
Look closely you'll know why
Outrun 'em you know we can
So put the keys in my hand In my hand

[Chorus:]
hell on wheels is no big deal
Road burnin' all across the land
Hell On Wheels is no big deal

Takin' 'em out of the Masterplan
An idea whose time has come
A land ride for everyone
Been like this for years on end
We'll let you know where and when
As he splits the road in two
Underdrive we never knew
Ourun 'em you know we can
So put the keys in my hand

In my hand

[Chorus]

In my hand [x8]
