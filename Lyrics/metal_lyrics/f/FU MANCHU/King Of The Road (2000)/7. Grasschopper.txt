Days we roll
20 years - all 4 gears
Wherever they go
They go

Back for more
They know what's in store
The chrome it screams - whatever the speed
Wherever they go
They go

[Chorus:]
Flat out for days gone by
No one knows how and why
Lawless it seems - on by'they scream

Clear the Road

There's no reason why
Stoppin' them don't even try
Lawless it seems - on by they scream

Clear the Road

Side by side
In pairs they ride
Across the road - makin' it known
Wherever they go
They go

[Chorus]
