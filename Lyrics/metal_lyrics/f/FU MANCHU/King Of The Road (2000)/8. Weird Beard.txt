Hundreds - thousands - millions
will appear
He struggles to signal
so says the weird beard
And he rides around
For a chance to see it all
Uncertain and unknowing
We're sure he will fall
So he quickly takes the high road to where is not know
He will return
Down a slide to his throne

[Chorus:]
And he says - he says
Weird Beard

5 mile - 6 mile - 7 mile
wide
As he sped toward the mountain
An easy place to hide
