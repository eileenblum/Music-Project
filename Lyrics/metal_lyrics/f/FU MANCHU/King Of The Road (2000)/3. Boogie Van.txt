Break - One Nine
Got your boots on
Gearjammer set
Boogey Van so far
How do you read me?
Three's and Eight's high
Some kind of joyride
Double-nickel right by
In here - everything I need
Style - built for speed
Mother Trucker runnin' low
Four wheels - overflow
Others passin' by
Still movin' down the line
So say~ the written word
Two down - now the Third
The greatest thing I've seen
Do y'all know what I mean?
Meeting Twenty was the plan
Me and my Boogey Van

Like most - Chevys coast to coast
People start to ride
Dream machine burnin' wides
Layin' a furious yard It smokes awful far
Highback chair is low
Rollin' faster off they go
Tires roll flare to flare
Custom shine everywhere
One-fifty I don't care
Half-way cross the land
Me and my Boogey Van
Movin' on down the line
Here we go one more time
