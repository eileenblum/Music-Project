Took my Superbird
Down to the track
Saw a Camaro
Pull in the stacks
Flag went down
Hear the rubber burn
Lucky shift
Got me in the turn

Must have been ridin
With lady luck
Flipping his wig
His gears are stuck
The Camaro..
so far behind
I'm out of gear
Coasting to the line!

SOLID!

Foot off the gas
A man alive
I shoved it down in
To overdrive
I pulled away
I'm feeling fine
Superbird screaming
Anytime
