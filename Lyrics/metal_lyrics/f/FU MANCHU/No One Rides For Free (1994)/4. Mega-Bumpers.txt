Oh mona sue what can you do?
sharing it around
swinging like Issac from a ship to shore
ladies coming down
way more than I've ever seen
you know what i mean?
more than a pound to go around
bringing them to their knees

Over my head through my back
five car lengths is where your at

Throwing snake eyes from a hand in the back
white knuckling round
captain light foot dancing up a storm
coming back for more
Bobby driving a round a round
a race is going down
sudden flash across the night
outta sight

Over my head through my back
five car lengths is where your at

Hitting the road I see you all the way back
Hey I seen you around
Shiny blue camaro sitting in my path
chumps going down
