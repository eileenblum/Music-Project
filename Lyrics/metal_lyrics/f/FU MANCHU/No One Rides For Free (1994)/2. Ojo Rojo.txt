She wanted nothing! and I delivered!
drawing aces.. down the river
my car.. I could give her
shine that, back down the river
man of leisure 'round town
dull nova, primed and brown
smoke's coming out of the back
wish I had.. my Cadillac
I revved it up.. hundred and one..
KANSAS CITY.. HERE I COME!
The meter said one ninety five
HEY LADIES! WANT A RIDE?
WANT A RIDE?
WANT A RIDE?
