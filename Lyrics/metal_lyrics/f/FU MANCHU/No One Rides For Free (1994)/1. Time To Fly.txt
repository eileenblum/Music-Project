hidden behind my Chevy's walls
-every time
that's where Ill be.. that's where I'm at
I'm doing fine
and did you know? that's where Ill go
-I'm getting mine-

its time to fly
its time to fly

Anodized and gettin' wider
-Streamlined-

its time to fly
buh bye
I'm gone
blink of an eye

Its a roomy is what they tell me
-Dynamite-
Got a tear drop and a diamond
a cats eye

its time to fly
its time to fly

Half a one..
six of the other
-that's right-
Its time to fly
bye-bye
well I'm gone
blink of an eye eye
