[Refrain:]
Life's the same
Movin' in stereo
Life's the same
except for my shoes
Life's the same
You're shakin' like trembelo
Life's the same
It's all insane

It's so easy to blow up your problems
It's so easy to play up your breakdown
It's so easy to plop through a window
It's so easy to fool with the sound

[Guitar sequence]

It's so tough to get up
It's so tough
It's so tough to live up
It's so tough - but you

[Refrain]

You
