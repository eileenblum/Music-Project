those things I see
they pass me by
Been hung out to dry
those things you say
those things you try

been hung out to dry
one more time
one more time
one more time
been hung out to dry
one more time
one more time
one more time
been hung out to dry

you choose your side
as you cross the line
been hung out to dry
you quickly leave
the door swings wide

been hung out to dry
one more time
one more time
one more time
been hung out to dry
one more time
one more time
one more time
been hung out to dry

you say yourself
you like to hear the sound of no one else
you say yourself
you like to hear the sound of no one else
you say yourself
you like to hear the sound of no one else
been hung out to dry
been hung out to dry
been hung out to dry
