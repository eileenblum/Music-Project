Stay where you are,
and you'll be like the others.
Last time you said,
what you want and you suffered.
Read what they write,
time will tell they discovered.
Fear in their eyes,
taken down one another.

-Let Me Out-
Everything I've told you
Everything I Say
-Let Me Out-
Back in the time when,
I Remember those days
-Let Me Out-

Who will trust when you hear
you've got nothing
New way of life and you feel
you've got something
Find another way as you look
over your shoulder
Once you understand no turning
back, it's all over

-Let Me Out-
Everything I've told you
Everything I Say
-Let Me Out-
Back in the time when,
I Remember those days
-Let Me Out-

Let Me Out!
Let Me Out!
Let Me Out!
Let Me Out, Now!
Let Me Out, Now!
Let Me Out, Now!
Let Me Out, Now!
