A sucker is born every minute or two
All the fingers in the womb will be pointed right at you (at you)
Another number runner takes a place and the other side frowns
You hit the deck as its goin down

So...
Shake it loose, i try tellin you
Shake it loose, you'll be back real soon
Shake it loose, i try tellin you
Shake it loose

A new day dawning means another chance to hurry thru
All the time in the world is never enough for you (for you)
It all adds up to another blank face in the crowd
You hit the deck as its goin down

So...
Shake it loose, i try tellin you
Shake it loose, you'll be back real soon
Shake it loose, i try tellin you
Shake it loose

Shake it loose
Shake it loose
Shake it loose

Shake it loose (shake it loose, shake it loose)
Shake it loose (shake it loose, shake it loose)

Shake
It
Loose
Shake
It
Loose
