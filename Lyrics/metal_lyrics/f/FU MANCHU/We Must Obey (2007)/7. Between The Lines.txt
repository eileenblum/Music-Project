Take your time - you're way too slow
Push it back, your self control
All by yourself, you change your mind
As you will read between the lines

The lies, lies

So far down, you're trapped inside

The lies, lies

[Refrain:]
Close your hand so tight
Can't believe your eyes
Close your hand so tight
As you read between the lines

Move your feet, they pass you by
Hesitate and fall behind

Lies, lies

Save me please, yeah, one more time

The lies, lies

[Refrain]

The lies [x9]
