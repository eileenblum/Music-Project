Satisfied, Out Of Time
Hides In The Back Of Your Mind
You Will Stand, As They Command
Again For The Rest Of Your Life

We Must Obey!
Never Heard A Sound
We Must Obey!
Show Us A Better Way
Tear It Down Again
(We Must Obey!)
Those They Couldn't Save
(We Must Obey!)
Tell Them What I Thought
(We Must Obey!)
We Must Obey!

Locked Inside, Race Through Time
Slowly Realize
Without A Trace, You Take Your Place
At The End Of The Line

We Must Obey!
Never Heard A Sound
We Must Obey!
Show Us A Better Way
Tear It Down Again
(We Must Obey!)
Those They Couldn't Save
(We Must Obey!)
Tell Them What I Thought
(We Must Obey!)
We Must Obey!

Times Rollin' On
Times Rollin' On
Times Rollin' On
Times Rollin' On
(We Must Obey!)
Times Rollin' On
(We Must Obey!)
Times Rollin' On
(We Must Obey!)
Times Rollin' On
(We Must Obey!)
Times Rollin' On
(We Must Obey!)
