I've Been Stuck In The Middle Of It All
Seen Your Face Everywhere I've Gone

I Knew It All Along
I Knew It All Along
I Knew It All Along

Told Myself Problem Solved
End Of The Day Either Right Or Wrong

I Knew It All Along

Watch As You Fall, I'm Taking It All
Never Believe, I Knew It All Along
I Said (All Along)
I Said (All Along)
No One Around To Blame It On
Never Believe I Knew It All Along
I Said (All Along)

I Knew It All Along
I Knew It All Along

Before I End All The Rights You've Wronged
One Thing Left That Will Always Be On

I Knew It All Along

Watch As You Fall, I'm Taking It All
Never Believe, I Knew It All Along
I Said (All Along)
I Said (All Along)
No One Around To Blame It On
Never Believe I Knew It All Along
I Said

Watch As You Fall, I'm Taking It All
Never Believe, I Knew It All Along

Watch As You Fall, I'm Taking It All
Never Believe, I Knew It All Along
