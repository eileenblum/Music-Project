Born to be suppressed Our Fate seems to be sealed
We Work for high society All Day we slave away
We won't accept our destiny And we'll fight for our right
Let's go to your suppressed Let's all follow in the call

Surely, the day will come All power will then be broken
Freedom the eternal cry Will echo high in the sky

Freedom is the cry For all slaves to fight
The Tyrants are called To account for brutal power
Freedom is the essence Of a human life
Come on ' let's be liberated From our chains of slavery

We had been enslaved Since the day of our birth
The time has run out For all Tyrants on this earth
