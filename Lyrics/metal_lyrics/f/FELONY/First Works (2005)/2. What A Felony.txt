Once he comes to you With a friendly smile
Promises joy and everything you want
He is going to try to win your confidence
All you have to do  to sail through the clouds Is to try

He will say to you Feel yourself great and strong
Say no to all temptations no no no

What a felony - Hear the warning of your mind
What a felony It's the last help of this kind

If you take these drugs There's no way to return
The addiction begins You feel the awful pain
All kind of drugs Will never be a key
To open the gate To a better world

What a felony You think it's the easiest way you know
What a felony The addiction is something you can't control
What a felony - you'll fight against the time
What a felony You can't control your mind

Drugs are crime for all mankind
