I don't say I've got the truth - I've just never seen any proof
I have neither been down in hell- Nor seen all the angels as well

I don't want to walk in others shoes - Or play your kind of blues

I want to live my life free -  day by day
I want to live my life free - goin' my way
I want to live my life free - day by day
I want to live my life free

To your opinion I pay respect - But my own I'll never neglect
I always make my own rules - Never follow the other fools

I'm not your puppet on strings -  always fly with my own wings

You try to engage my individuality - Better work on your personality
Can't keep me under your control - 'Cause I won't fit in any role
