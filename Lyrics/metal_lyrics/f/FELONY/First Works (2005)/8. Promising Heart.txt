I really can't believe Someone's changed my life
A pleasant feeling deep inside It happens to me
I really can't believe Someone's touched my heart
It is something else A feeling so strong

Promising heart Burning soul
Between joy and pain I'm losing control

I really can't believe - Really can't believe
Someone's returning love - Returning love
You are the light in the night - Light in the night
That I was looking for looking for
