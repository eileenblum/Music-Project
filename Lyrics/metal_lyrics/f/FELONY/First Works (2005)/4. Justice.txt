I'm standing before the high court It seems like a nightmare to me
Being accused of a crime I'm not guilty can't they see

They reproach me with a murder offence My memories aren't so clear
I can't remember last dark night And I don't know how I got here

Innocent in a prison cell - Life is like a living hell

Justice where've you gone - There's nothing you can do
When the hammer of the judge - Finally falls on you

The judge face looks so grim I've got no chance at all
Nobody there to help me now No one hears my desperate call

The jury passed the verdict Twenty years of my life
I can't believe what I hear All that remains for me is to pray

With rage and vengeance inside I go Just one thing on my mind
If I will ever get out of here The betrayer will pay for his lies
