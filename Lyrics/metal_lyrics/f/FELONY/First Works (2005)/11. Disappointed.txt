I fall in love - just love for you This feeling could last forever
I am alone and fantasize I won't accept "never"
You're disappointed recently You've hurted and you're in misery
You have tried to make me clear That I was kind, don't depend on me

You don't care what's on my mind You can't feel my pain inside
Are frankness and honesty Just empty words of infirmity

Disappointed  from this unfair game
Disappointed  the looser calls my name
Disappointed in a human way
Disappointed not use to pray
my efforts- all in vain remain my pain

Distrust and hate are in your heart Is there not a place for me
You say less moved: "It's not your fault" That's not even a cold conform
You've turned me down, no explanation Why do you give me no chance at all
Don't you feel a guilty conscience You get me high, and let me fall

It leaves you cold what's on my mind You won't feel my doubts inside
Are frankness and honesty Just empty words of infirmity
