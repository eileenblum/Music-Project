Present time decays so fast It's tomorrow we're heading for
No one thinks about the past No place for misery and war
Technology's evolution grows Uncertain power is yet to come
Mankinds future no one knows All human values seem to be gone

Welcome to cyberspace - No request for a feeling
The birth of another race - Progress the only meaning at all

I'm mourning for all the children Had they ever a real life
The sign of warning will not be seen The future threatens us like a knife
I fear the approach of the unknown Just listen to the news every day
No turning back the cancer's grown In the end there's a high price to pay

Present time decays so fast Uncertain power is yet to come
Nobody thinking about the past All human values seem to be gone
