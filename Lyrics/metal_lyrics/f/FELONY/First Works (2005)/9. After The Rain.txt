There's no sunshine anymore - Dark clouds cover your sky
There's not much hope left - You ask yourself why
Thunder and rain all around - Life has its stormy seasons too
Many things have gone wrong - There's no reason for you

After the rain - The sun will shine again
After the rain - There will be no more pain

But don't give up even now - There are better times to come
You must stand all the rain - Still many things are left undone
Forget about all that's bad - The rain will wash it soon away
Just do not let it get you down - And you will remain

The sun is breaking through the clouds - The rays will keep you warm
All that fears have gone away - Left behind you in the storm
