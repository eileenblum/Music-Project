Spring turns to summer so fast Summer so fast to fall
Soon another year's passed by Just a few memories to recall

When winter knocks on the door And autumn mist covers the land
The smile leaves on people's face Like traces in the fine sand

On life's end

I stand out of doors Snow falls on me And I stretch out my arms
'Bout to catch the flakes with my hands
(But) their thawing shows how time flies

I don't fear the ending of my life Because it's been filled with joy
And when the moment is near I will leave without fear

I remember a time when we were young and bold
But at some point everything's growing old
