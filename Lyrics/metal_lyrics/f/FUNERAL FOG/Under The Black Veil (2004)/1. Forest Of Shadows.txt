Gazing in the forest of shadows
Where the spirits of the undead come to life
Inside the forest of Bewitchment
Wonders of darkness summon me

I enter the shadowy forest
Where vampiric spirts of the night
Wait for my blood

Forest of Shadows
Come to life
Forest of shadows
Awake from your slumber

My mortal body falls onto the cold ground
My soul fades away

Forest of Shadows
Come to life
Forest of shadows
Awake from your slumber

My mortal body falls onto the cold ground
My soul fades away

Gazing into the forest of shadows
Where the spirits of the undead come to life
Inside the forest of Bewitchment
Wonders of darkness summon me

Forest of Shadows
Forest of Shadows
