Deep inside the Carpathian Forest
In the Funeral Fogs
Of Transylvania
Legions of the undead
Hunger for blood

Transylvanian Bloodlust
The blood is the life

There they awake
From their slumber
Moonlight reflecting onto their pale faces
As their dead eyes gaze
Into the twilight

Transylvanian Bloodlust
The blood is the life

The quest for blood begins
As they descend onto their victims
Like a silent fog
The crimson blood flows into their veins
As mortal bodies are left for dead

Transylvanian Bloodlust
The blood is the life
Transylvanian Bloodlust
The blood is the life
