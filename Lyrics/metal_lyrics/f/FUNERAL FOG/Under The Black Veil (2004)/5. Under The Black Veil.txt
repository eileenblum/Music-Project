Centuries ago in the Slavic lands
Lived a countess in her sadistic castle
Where she dwelled
She preyed upon virgin servants
For their blood

There inside the cold dungeons
Where she drank blood
From her victims
To keep herself
Beautifully immortal

Blood countess so beautiful
Drink the blood
Be
Immortal

Many souls have passed
Through the castle
Where their fates had ended
Tortured bodies
Lie beneath the floors

Blood countess so beautiful
Drink the blood
Be
Immortal

Nameless mass graves in a dead forest
Under the black veil
Is the dark secret of the blood countess
Those who served her
Shall never return

Blood countess so beautiful
Drink the blood
Be
Immortal
