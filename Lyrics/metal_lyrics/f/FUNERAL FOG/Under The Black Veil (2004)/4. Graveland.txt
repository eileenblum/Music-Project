As I journey upon the footpath
Entering graveland
Somber whispers from sentient spirits
Beckon me
Past the ancient graves
The archaic tongues are bewildering

Arcane mists rise upon the ground
Enshrouding me with fear
Lurching forward and suffocating
Voices from aeons past are near
Eternal spirits command me
Through the dark forest
Mystical ghosts are calling my name

Frozen with fear I stand forlorn
Whispering enchanted voices
Channeling through my mind
My fate was forseen ages ago
...Destiny is forever dead

Graveland... Forever dead...
