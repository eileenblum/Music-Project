Under this freezing moon
I call upon the Immortal legion to rise
From the underworld in the circle of blood
I summon the lords of chaos
To unleash their destruction onto mankind

Rise from the abyss rise
Rise from the abyss rise
From this immortal summonings
I call upon you

Drink from this chalice
I sacrifice for you this crimson blood
Come forth rulers of the night
Awake from the undead realms
Come forth and feed
Upon the mortal blood

Rise from the abyss rise
Rise from the abyss rise
From this immortal summonings
I call upon you

Come forth legions of the undead
I embrace your darkness
Come forth I summon you

Rise from the abyss rise...
