The Fold it keeps us in line
A method passed down through time
We learn the way from the start
And every drone does their part 

[chorus]
IT'S TIME 
IT'S TIME 

JUST ONE MORE CHANCE TO TAKE IT BACK
JUST ONE MORE CHANCE
JUST ONE MORE CHANCE TO TAKE IT BACK
JUST ONE MORE CHANCE

The puppets blind to the strings 
Are the easiest to control
A gluttony of choices
All leading to a single goal

[chorus]

This peace is a dull facade
We're pacified 
But only for so long
The key to our salvation
The end of this endless Occupation

So what happens next?
The thrill of revolt wears off
Just remember it's never too late
To become what you hate

[chorus]
