The old man stared at me
A worn look in his eyes
He'd seen and done it all before

He said "There's nothing new
In what you're going through
Another day another war

The world is meant to change
But people never do
They always forget yesterday

They'll never know the price
The men who sacrificed
To get us where we are today

[chorus]
AND NOW I'M MARCHING
IN THE PARADE OF THE FORGOTTEN
OUR FACES OUR STORIES
HAVE MELDED INTO ONE

And when you see me now
You see me broken down
My stories fall on thankless ears

Existing day to day
Slowly wasting away
Wandering through my final years

When I was young it seemed
I could do anything
I fought beside the finest men

I saw so many die
While luck kept me alive
I often wish I'd gone with them"

[chorus]

Before I grow old
I would end it all
Better to die young
Than live too long

AND NOW I'M MARCHING
IN THE PARADE OF THE FORGOTTEN
OUR BANNERS OUR GLORIES
HAVE FADED IN THE SUN
