We've heard the tales
Of the days that last forever
But the setting sun
Tells a story of its own

We like to think 
That our heroes live forever
But we find they're made of
Flesh and blood and bone

[chorus]
AS SOON AS YOU LET GO
AS SOON AS YOU BELIEVE
YOU FIND YOURSELF DEFENSELESS
TAKEN AND DECEIVED

We'd like to think
That this ship will sail forever
But the blowing wind
Can just as quickly die

We like to think
We can keep it all together
As it disintegrates
Right before our eyes

[chorus]
