You take me in I'll take you down
With the smile of a clown
Arrange the pieces all in line
I'm closing in on what is mine

[chorus]
I PUT THE PLANS INTO MOTION
I AM THE WORST OF MY KIND
I'M STAYING ONE STEP AHEAD
I AM THE MASTERMIND

No one can know my obsession
I strike again, and again, and again
I've found the answers over time
Life's one big joke and I'm the punch line

[chorus]

This pale skin holds a million scars
Who decides when the joke has gone too far?

And so they put me here to sleep
Where I am just another freak
They say to change my "evil" ways
But I'll get out again some day

[chorus]
