Some had no choice but to fight
Our lives were over
The moment we saw our number on the screen

While others signed their lives away
For their fathers and their country
And fear of how they would be seen

So gather all your strength
Summon up the blood
Now we will find out
What we're really made of

Right now

Took us apart piece by piece
Put us back together
With cold steel in our hands and in our hearts

Dropped us down in a pit of hell
A million shades of green
And on all sides the killing starts

[chorus]
IN THESE DAYS OF DESTRUCTION
WE ALL BECOME THE MONSTERS
THAT WE FEARED IN CHILDHOOD DREAMS
IN THESE DAYS OF DESTRUCTION
THE FIRST LESSON WE LEARN
IS THAT NO ONE'S HANDS ARE CLEAN

And the letters you wrote
I had to burn them all
The boy you knew
Couldn't read them at all

I lost him along the line
Between here and there
I've searched all over
And can't find him anywhere

We can't be blamed for what we've done
Politics and morals
As foreign now as any luxury

And what's left can never come home
Forever searching
To find our lost humanity

[chorus]
