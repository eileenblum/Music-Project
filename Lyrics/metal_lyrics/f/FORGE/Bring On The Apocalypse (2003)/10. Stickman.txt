The Stickman breaks the ice
Brings all cold feelings forward
A shifting sacrifice
A little more to carry homeward

The little crimes slip by
Liquid loyalties re-incise
And reaching for the feed
They unearth a hidden greed

[chorus]
WHO DECIDES RIGHT AND WRONG? 
WHO DECIDES WHAT SHOULD BE SAID? 
I THINK I'LL NEVER SEE THE PATH AGAIN

A fearless choice of words
Sitting safe a world away
Traffic is a blur
And every coward has his say

Chameleons test the air
Oceans swell and overflow
But the Stickman's everywhere
Eras come and eras go

[chorus]

Those who remain true
Will cut a path of their own
Constant in the slew
Weather judgments and missiles thrown

Constant in the slew
Weather judgments and missiles thrown
Constant in the slew:
To forge ahead and set the tone

[chorus]
