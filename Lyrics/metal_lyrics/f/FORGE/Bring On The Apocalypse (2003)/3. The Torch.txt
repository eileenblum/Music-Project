Before we start this
We've got a moment
Let's go over this
One more time

You take the left side
I've got the right
Keep your head low
And sights in line

[chorus]
THE TIME HAS COME FOR A FIRST STEP
WE'VE COVERED MILES 
BUT OUR JOURNEY'S JUST BEGUN
REMEMBER EVERYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED
PICK UP THE TORCH AND RUN 
INTO THE NIGHT IT BURNS

If we survive this
Don't relax yet
We've won the battle
Not the war

Keep your guns ready
And stay on guard
Your greatest moments
Are in store

[chorus]
