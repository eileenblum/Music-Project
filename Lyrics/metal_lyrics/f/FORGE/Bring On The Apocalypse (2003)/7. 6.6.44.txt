The last moments of peace
Of calm: of clear vision
The fear is with us all
And death is coming closer

The barrier removes itself
And there we stand exposed to view
And then it all becomes too real
As the death comes ripping through

I hear the voices all around
I hear the screams of dying men
Voices fall silent now
Never to speak again

[chorus]
ONCE MORE
UNTO THE BREACH
DEAR FRIENDS
ONCE MORE

I climb out of the red
Engulfed by a constant roar
I see no enemy
A seemingly invisible force

Tears through all that surrounds me
Cuts us down one by one
I pull myself together
I force myself to run

[chorus]

Silent now: time slows down:
Only for a moment: I look around
Nothing makes sense: only for a moment
Frozen with fear: only for a moment

Now moving towards the source
I've got to kill the source
Reaching for the ultimate goal
Just trying to stay alive

Once more unto the breach dear friends
This is not the beginning or the end
And the battle rages on
Even with so many gone

[chorus]
