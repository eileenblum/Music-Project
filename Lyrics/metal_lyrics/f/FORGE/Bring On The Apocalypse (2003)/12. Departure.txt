Here it comes
It's coming right on time
There's very little room left
So get in line

It'll be a short trip
But none will leave unchanged
It'll show you places
You thought were out of range

[chorus]
AND I KNOW WHERE THIS VESSEL'S HEADED
I KNOW THE DISTANCE SPANNED
AND I KNOW WHERE THIS JOURNEY ENDS
RIGHT BACK WHERE IT BEGAN

Some may not make it
They can exit at any time
On this trip there will be no stopping
There will be no wasted time

With so much left to see
We've go to keep this pace
We've so much ground to cover
On this trip through space

[chorus]

And all the while you slept
Awaken only to realize, we never left

[chorus]
