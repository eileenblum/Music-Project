You checked the right side
Forgot about the left
You checked behind you
Forgot about in front

You didn't see it coming
You were already dead
There was no way
You could have prepared

Spinning its web it lies in wait
In the blink of an eye it's too late
And the ones who thought they could handle it all
They're the first to fall

NEVER UNDERESTIMATE YOUR ENEMY
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP YOUR HEAD
IN ONE SWIFT MOTION IT COULD HAPPEN SO FAST
YOU MAY NOT EVEN KNOW YOU ARE ALREADY DEAD

You checked the right side
Forgot about the left
You checked behind you
Forgot about in front

You didn't see it coming
You were already dead
There was no way
You could have prepared

The dragons stir deep in their hive
Sniffing the air they come alive
Each step you take could be your last
Just pray that it happens fast

[chorus]

Don't go down that hall
You may not like what you find
Don't open that door
You may not like what's inside

[chorus]

And everything you've done
And every fight you've won
And everything you've seen: it won't mean a thing
Because you can't track it
Can't stop it
Can't escape it
Can't outgun it
Can't fathom where it is: 
But look behind you
Cause there it is
