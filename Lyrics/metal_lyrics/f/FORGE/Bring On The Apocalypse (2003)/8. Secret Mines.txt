Venture down to the Secret Mines
Where the forgotten children toil
Just under the surface of freedom
Underneath the frozen soil 
Become one of us
Become one of us
Become one of us
Become one of us

My brothers and I were born here
And this is where we shall die
Having never known the Sun's warmth
Having never seen the sky

[chorus]
VENTURE DOWN TO THE SECRET MINES
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE SECRET MINES?
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE SECRET MINES?
YOU BELONG IN THE SECRET MINES

Time means nothing here
Light means nothing here
All that matters is the Grand Work
Nothing escapes for long

You've lived the life of a free man
With many years to roam
But just like every drifter
You must return to home

Become one of us
Become one of us
Become one of us
You are one of us

[chorus]
