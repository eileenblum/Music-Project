Pï¿½mrok, czerï¿½, szary ï¿½piew,
Spï¿½ywa dzieï¿½, krï¿½ï¿½y krew.
Blady ï¿½wit, w pï¿½ucach mgï¿½a,
Ziemi kwiat ï¿½ ï¿½mierci znak.

Gdy pchniï¿½ty czas okrï¿½gi zaczï¿½ï¿½ toczyï¿½,
Kiedy oddech sï¿½aby z wiatrem porwaï¿½,
A o otwartï¿½ dï¿½oï¿½ uderzyï¿½ nie ï¿½miaï¿½
Byï¿½o tak, jak chciaï¿½, w blasku dnia.

Dzieï¿½ wtedy nie wstaï¿½...
To noc go tam uniosï¿½a
Gï¿½ï¿½biej w ï¿½yciu zmoczona,
Intensywniej ï¿½mierdzï¿½ca...

On czarny,
Tchnieniem kaï¿½dym kolejnym
Przenikaï¿½ okrï¿½gu krwi wstï¿½gi,

Ona czarna
Bielï¿½ ciepï¿½ï¿½ wybraï¿½a ï¿½ycie w jednym i ï¿½mierï¿½...

Pï¿½ynie czas, wilgoï¿½ trwa,
ï¿½ycia blask cicho gra.
Tyle lat, siebie wrak,
Ziemi kwiat ï¿½ ï¿½mierci znak
