Pï¿½aty skï¿½ry od ciaï¿½a swego odrywam. Rzucam.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Idzie zima.

Ostatnie krople deszczu milczeniem ï¿½yï¿½a oplata.
Czerwieï¿½. Idzie zima.

Koï¿½ci me zï¿½amane ciskam. I wiatrem taï¿½czï¿½.
Biel. Idzie zima.

Bladoï¿½ï¿½ twarzy mojej w biel siï¿½ zmienia.
Czerï¿½. Idzie zima.

Przed ciszï¿½ wiecznï¿½ spokoju chwila.
Idzie martwa polska zima!
