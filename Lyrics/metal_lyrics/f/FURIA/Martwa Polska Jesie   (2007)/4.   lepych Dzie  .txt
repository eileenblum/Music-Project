Ciaï¿½a ich goï¿½ymi rï¿½kami otworzyï¿½,
Dï¿½onie i ramiona w ich wnï¿½trza utopiï¿½,
Tï¿½tniï¿½ce ï¿½ywot sieci z nich wyszarpaï¿½
I prawoï¿½ci tych zawiï¿½oï¿½ï¿½ rwaniem rozplï¿½taï¿½.

Ciaï¿½a ich zï¿½amane caï¿½ï¿½ siï¿½ï¿½ rzuciï¿½
I twarze w ziemiï¿½ jaï¿½owï¿½ posadziï¿½,
A ï¿½linï¿½ od ksiï¿½g wiecznych ï¿½ï¿½tï¿½ ich ochrzciï¿½,
Jï¿½ z morzem ich krwi w nowy ï¿½wiat zmieniï¿½.

Morzem nieskoï¿½czonym do nikï¿½d pï¿½ynï¿½ï¿½,
Gï¿½ï¿½d trupem wciï¿½ï¿½ nowym, ï¿½wieï¿½ym zastï¿½powaï¿½
Kroplï¿½ szarï¿½ szaleï¿½stwem pï¿½ynï¿½cï¿½ poiï¿½
I ze wzgardï¿½ sï¿½oï¿½cem nieskuszonï¿½ konaï¿½!
