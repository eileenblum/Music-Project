We were sent to this world
Now we see all the action
The man in hate's lair, commanding us
His statement to share

Nation free!
We're fighting for democracy
Salvation / all we deserve
We don't need tyranny
Let's walk through our land of Eden

We were tortured and enslaved
For their cruel satisfaction
A bird flyin' in the air
Killing us, our children not spare

Nation free!
We're fighting for democracy
Salvation / all we deserve
We don't need tyranny
Let's walk through our land of Eden
