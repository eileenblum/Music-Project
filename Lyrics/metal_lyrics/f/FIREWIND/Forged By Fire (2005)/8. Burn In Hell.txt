Leader of the "master race"
Tried to capture the world
A psychic with nightmares
Couldn't state his prophecies

They killed in the name of god
Dead bodies on the fields!
Screaming!

He lost the war, with hate inside
For sure he'll burn in hell
Killing innocence was holy sin
For sure he'll burn in hell

Genocide in the state
With an emotion of hate
We call him Antichrist!
Who is against what is right

They killed in the name of god
Dead bodies on the fields!
Screaming!
