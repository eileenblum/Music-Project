A volunteer,onto this field
No guarantee, death will yield
A conflict has started to conquer us all
Rise above, or mankind will fall

The bullet's red rain
Thou shall not kill
War, earth's bloody stain

Memories of our childhood days
Drowns me witnessing youth today
Boundaries of our motherland
No longer there, no longer there

Nuclear weapons against a blessed kingdom
Demolish the histories
Concrete jungles they've built are insecure
Will the machines claim again?

The bullet's red rain
Thou shall not kill
War, earth's bloody stain

Memories of our childhood days
Drowns me witnessing youth today
Boundaries of our motherland
No longer there, no longer there
