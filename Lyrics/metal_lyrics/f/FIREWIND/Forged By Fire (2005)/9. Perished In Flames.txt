What brings this anger? To kill us and lie
Now we have hunger, our children will die
And they anchor, our strength to the ground
And will this banker, steal without sound

They fought a battle, to erase our race
They promised death, in a fiery place

In the middle of the night, the sirens calling
In the middle of the night, perished in flames

Now we are in danger, we can't survive
Locked with strangers, they're gonna burn us alive

In the middle of the night, the sirens calling
In the middle of the night, perished in flames
In the middle of the night, the masses praying
In the middle of the night, the ashes in air

Can't understand the hatred that's been unleashed on us
Our daily bread, been canceled by the press
A crown of stolen diamonds, won't last forever
Our spirit never dies and you'll pay the price
