Father help me, I have sinned
For the love once I knew now is lost
Father I know I cannot win
It's something that will dearly cost

I am a stranger for this world
I am a stranger from now and on

Feelings crushed with no return
The wounds are just too deep to heal
Feelings that I will always yearn
The shame and the weakness reveal

I am a stranger, I gotta be strong
Cause I know...

I am a hero in this new world
I'll go through my pain and not return
I am a hero in this new world
You will be a lie one day
If I survive!

Teacher taught, a special guide
What's right instead of wrong
The preacher said, son leave it behind
It isn't the place you belong

I am a stranger, I gotta be strong
Cause I know...
