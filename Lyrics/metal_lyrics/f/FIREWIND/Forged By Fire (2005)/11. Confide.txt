[Verse 1]
It seems its over
When the ground is gone
The night is silent
Now i stand alone
When we are together
You make me feel alive
Bound forever
You're love feels right

[Pre-Chorus]
One more night comes to an end
One more fight for my friend
No more regrets.

[Chorus:]
Feels like I've known you for so long
My heart is blank without you
Tonight together
They're not alone
Just in you, I Confide

[Verse 2]
It isn't over
When you are gone
A destination still lies ahead
In silver moonlight
Our love is awake
Please forgive me
And don't walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
One more night comes to an end
One more fight for my friend
No more regrets.

[Chorus:]
Feels like I've known you for so long
My heart is blank without you
Tonight together
They're not alone
Just in you, I Confide

[Solo]

[Chorus x2]
Feels like I've known you for so long
My heart is blank without you
Tonight together
They're not alone
Just in you, I Confide
