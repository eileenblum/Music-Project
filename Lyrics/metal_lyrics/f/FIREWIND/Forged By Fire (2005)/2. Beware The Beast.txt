Over the mountains, across horizons
A vicious mist from the dawn
The bloody fountains, overflowing
A shadow appears from the spawn

Gothic voices howling in the wind
When darkness surrounds the land

Beware the beast, he is the devil
Who grabs your hand and leads you in
Beware the beast, he is in revel
He guides you to fire

Thunder striking, the earth is shaking
A silver dagger glows
Blood is boiling, courage loosing
Panic begins to grow

Gothic voices howling in the wind
When darkness surrounds the land

Beware the beast, he is the devil
Who grabs your hand and leads you in
Beware the beast, he is in revel
He guides you to fire

Beware the beast, he is evil
He bleeds your heart faithlessly
Beware the beast, he is in revel
He guides you to fire
