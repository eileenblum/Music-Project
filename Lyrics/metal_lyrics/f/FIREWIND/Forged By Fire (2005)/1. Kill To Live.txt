Leader of us all, conquers every shore
He's the king of fire
He was fearless and strong
Always standing tall
He will make you crawl
You cannot deny it
He is still the mastermind

His demise, a misery for his community
He battled, through the land and paid his dues

Kill to live!
He was forged by fire
Kill to live!
Trooper, your brave and genius
Spirit never dies

Enemies will fall
Blood upon the floor
Burning on the pyre
No quarter taken this day
Tearing down the wall
The carnage will sprawl
You can't crusade
He'll destroy mankind
