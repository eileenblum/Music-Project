The darkest side of your life
Can't understand the secret, how you survive
A crystal ball, by your side
A frightful future, now you describe

Higher above
A ball of fire about to fall

Can't escape, from tomorrow
A hopeless time rising
Can't escape, from tomorrow
Will we arrive

The finest days of our lives
There'll be no longer days for us to be alive
The final chapter has been read
The time has come to realize
