Times are tough, so you're heard
Has it ever been easy at all
Money rules, it's so absurd
The lack thereof will speed your fall

Work and slave, to the bone
Where's the sense in living this way
Greed and waste, they pour it on
You're not to question the game they play

Are we, debating, if a crime should occu
Here is, the reasoning should we ever the score
All is well, at the end of the day
If you're still alive
Bang your drum, play it hard, celebrate
You have survived

Bang your
Bang your angry drum
Bang it hard, hard!

More or less, mostly more
You're left waiting and nothings there
Fair is fair, in love and war
But you're alone and no one cares

Are we, debating, if a crime should occu
Here is, the reasoning should we ever the score

All is well, at the end of the day
If you're still alive
Bang your drum, play it hard, celebrate
You have survived

Do we dare, are we scared
To the charge of affairs
Roll the dice, pay the price
To cower is the real crime
