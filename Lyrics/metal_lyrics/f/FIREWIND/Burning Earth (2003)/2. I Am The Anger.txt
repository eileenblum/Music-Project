I've marched to wars, with a vicious rage
I've counted thousands dead from righteous plague
I am history, from all you know
I am the future, that you will sow

I've been to hell, I've touched the sun
I've seen heavens fall, I am the one

I am the power, who blacks the night
I am the anger, for all your fights
I am the power, who parts the seas
I am the savoir, for all your needs

I was at the birth, of the longest day
I was there at the death, of the wisest sage
Over and over now it'll be the same
Mankind's on the path, to the final shame

I've been to hell, I've touched the sun
I've seen heavens fall, I am the one

I am the power, who blacks the night
I am the anger, for all your fights
I am the power, who parts the seas
I am the savoir, for all your needs

I am the power
I blacken the night

I am the power, who blacks the night
I am the anger, for all your fights
I am the power, who parts the seas
I am the savoir, for all your needs

I am the power, I blackened the night
I am the anger, who causes your fights
I am the power, who plants the seeds
I am the savoir, for your dark deeds
