Falling down is a child's next move
Learning how not to fall is life's pursuit

And the conflict grows

All we need is a guiding host
Time the thief steals away
Dreams and hopes

For a virtuous world

God and evil, stalks all the young
Pray your choice is, kingdom come

Impulsive the youth, it drive them to prove they know what's better
But you know the truth, the wisdom is proof it comes much later

And the conflict is grows
Never comes to a close

When you were young
Did you learn from the tales you heard
Where you impressed
As to take them to heart
When you were young
Did you feel as did everyone
You stand as immortal

When you were grown
Did you learn from the tales you heard
Nothing appears as it did as when young
Where you are grown
And you know that it all was wrong
You stand there as mortal
You are now a mortal
You are now a mortal

Falling down, is a pain that's earned
Knowing now, it was all lessons learned

For a virtuous world

God and evil, stalks all the young
Pray your choice is, kingdom come

Good or evil, claims everyone
No more chances, for now you're gone

Immortal lives young, the conflict goes on
Mortals they learn, the conflict goes on
Immortal lives young
