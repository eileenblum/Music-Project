I have never known
A lover of my own
So many times I've tried and yet love eludes me
Where have I gone wrong, it's the same old song
Wasting time away, I'm so tired of brooding

I'm here, I'm here waiting for you
Seems like always waiting for you
Who are you that never shows
Keeper of my very soul
I've cried a trial of many tears
Mourning the journey through the years
No once can tell just how I feel
Once again I'm waiting still

Where's the secret hid
So many others find
So many broken dreams yet I'm still dreaming
I'll keep searching on
Until I find the one
Somewhere out there is a love
That needs me

I've been searching for so long
Waiting for my soul one

I'm here, I'm here waiting for you
Seems like always waiting for you
I'm here!
