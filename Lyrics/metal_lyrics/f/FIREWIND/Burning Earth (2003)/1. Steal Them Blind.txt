Live for now, seize the moment
Break away, from rules and confines
Leave the bounds, of moral constraints
Reap rewards, and take all you find

Ride on into the night
Fade to black and hide

Take your time, all is ripe
Choose your crime, steal them blind

Feel no guilt, ignore your conscience
Greed will rule, as food for your sustenance
Elevate, your standart of living
Waste it all. There's a more for the taking

Ride on into the night
Fade to black and hide

Take your time, all is ripe
Choose your crime, steal them blind

Play it cool, I get away with everything
A done deal, a guaranteed sure thing

Take your time, all is ripe
Choose your crime, steal them blind

Take what you find, and
Steal them blind
