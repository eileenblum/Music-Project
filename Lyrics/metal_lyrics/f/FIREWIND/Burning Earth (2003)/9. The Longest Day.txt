Take my hand now, I will lead you far away
From our homeland, to a place we shall not stay
But for moments, until your crying fades
And the haunting, of all those who paid

Hold your mother's memory
She was always there for you, but now she's gone

The longest day will it ever end
How long can men behave this way
The longest day has taken our loves
How long can wars remain

The morning sun rose, as it did like yesterday
A day like others, until the bombs fell our way
My son and wife died and left our small hometown in flames
There was no reason, to be hit by death's reign

Hold your mother's memory
She was always there for you
But now she's gone

The longest day will it ever end
How long can men behave this way
The longest day has taken our loves
How long can wars remain

I hold your hand
As you took your lasr breath
I could not save you
Nor my son from death

The longest day will it ever end
How long can men behave this way
The longest day has taken our loves
How long can wars remain

The longest day will it ever end
How long can men behave this way
The longest day has ruined our lives
Why do the wars remain
