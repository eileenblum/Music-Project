There is an answer to it all
We must embrace or we will destroy all we are

I was reeling from the news today
Crying out was a world in pain
Here and now it seems somehow we broke the vow
To be our Brother's keeper

This world can be a lonely, lonely place
It doesn't have to be your only fate

Same old story for another day
Nothing changing and there's hell to pay
Here and now it seems somehow we broke the vow
To be our Brother's keeper

This world can be a lonely, lonely place
It doesn't have to be your only fate
Open up to reveal your spirit face
Forgive forget and live for love's embrace

I am not alone, in feeling we've been wrong
Wasting the gifts of our lives
Say that you'll agree, it's up to you and me
We hold the key to survive

This world can be a lonely, lonely place
It doesn't have to be your only fate
Open up to reveal your spirit face
Forgive forget and live for love's embrace
