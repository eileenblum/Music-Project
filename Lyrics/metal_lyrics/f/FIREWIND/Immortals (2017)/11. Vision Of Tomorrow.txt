Faces of hate in the distance,
Turning peace into resistance
So much to lose but no thing to choose so far
All could be gone in instant
The enemy will be persistent
What shall we do? Theyâre coming for you again

Brothers, can you heed our warning?

We are waiting for the dawn
Carry on, and be strong
For a vision of tomorrow
Undivided canât be wrong
Carry on, and be strong
For a vision of tomorrow

Despite our common misfortune
No need to create this contortion
Itâs time to accept that itâs all for the best right now
And when the upheaval has ended,
The meaning will be comprehended
In the blink of an eye, they steal any freedom away

Tell me, can you heed our warning?

We are waiting for the dawn
Carry on, and be strong
For a vision of tomorrow
Undivided canât be wrong
Carry on, and be strong
For a vision of tomorrow

Donât turn your back to us, itâs much too late
Because the walls are tumbling us down
Thereâs no escaping, the world theyâre shaping
Look away, look away, look awayâ¦
