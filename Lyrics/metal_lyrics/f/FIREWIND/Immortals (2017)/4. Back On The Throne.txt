He has always been defiant
And he's gotta take control
No sympathy or kindness
In hos blackened empty soul

His legions set the pace
Marching onward to the west
So he looms behind the silence
Let all his minions do their best

They're shooting straight for the heart
And wanna tear us apart
They're gonna cut to the bone
It's gonna take some time to put you back on the throne
On the throne
Back on the throne
On the throne

Sailing right into destruction
Then defeated by his foe
Gotta find a way to fall back
But there's nowhere left to go

The trumpets sound "retreat"
But it just too late for some
And the man behind the failure
Soon will greet his "kingdom come"

They're shooting straight for the heart
And wanna tear us apart
They're gonna cut to the bone
It's gonna take some time to put you back on the throne
On the throne
On the throne
On the throne

Back on the throne
On the throne

Straight for the heart
They tear us apart
They cut to the bone
It's gonna take some time to put you back on the throne
