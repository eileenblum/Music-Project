Rage and fire in me
Turns a boy (in)to a soldier
There's no wrong or right in the fight 
For we do as we are told

Years went by and and I became
A king to lead this land to fame
Deep inside I feel the power 
When it's over, it's over

And the fear inside us
Will never divide us all
For united we'll never fall

[Chorus:]
We will never know the future
We will only know the past
For an instant there'll be sorrow in their eyes

There'll be no one to surrender
And our numbers (are) fading fast
Victory will not rewind the hands of time

In the southern sea
Vicious strikes on the water
No bridge left to cross
We'll destroy everything you leave behind

All in my head and out of my mind
I'm keeping the faith with forces allied
If there's a chance I'll make someone pay the price
But the war's not over

And the fear inside us
Will never divide us all
For united well never fall

[Chorus:]
We will never know the future
We will only know the past
For an instant there'll be sorrow in their eyes

There'll be no one to surrender
And our numbers (are) fading fast
Victory will not rewind the hands of time

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
We will never know the future
We will only know the past
For an instant there'll be sorrow in their eyes

There'll be no one to surrender
And our numbers (are) fading fast
Victory will not rewind the hands of time

Hands of time
Victory
