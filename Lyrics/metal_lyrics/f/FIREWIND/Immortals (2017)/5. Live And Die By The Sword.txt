When your days are shaded and nights have faded
And the still of death fills the air â
Your bade is true and your conscious too,
Why do these thoughts enter your mind?
Thereâs a warm wind blowing and the fire is glowing
Itâs my choice to live and die by the sword

The cowards have all vanished, they retreat in deep despair
For the enemy is more than just a beast inside the lair
They will never find their Savior, so oblivious to their crime
For the paradox of evil leads them through the night
They will rise, in the final hour

We live and die fighting by the sword
To prove that virtue is its own reward
We live and die fighting by the sword
Thereâs no surrender, the order will be restored

An ambush from the mountains, they attack us from behind
The alliance has been broken, there is no more mastermind
We secure our last position, with our shields and with our swords
Nut our numbers and no match against their mighty hordes,
So they rise, and we seal our fateâ¦

We live and die fighting by the sword
To prove that virtue is its own reward
We live and die fighting by the sword
Thereâs no surrender, the order will be destroyed!

A genocide, a mortal fate
Release the hounds and feed the hate,
And even in defeat, we will survive â so we

We live and die fighting by the sword
To prove that virtue is its own reward
We live and die fighting by the sword
Thereâs no surrender, the order will be restored
