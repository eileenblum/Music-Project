The Reaper's calling for empathy
The Reaper's riding alone
Illusion has not overtaken me
The answer is soon to be known

We defy
This word reforms in silence
We defy
We strive to ignore the violence
We defy
In time we'll defeat any tyrant
We defy
We're only waiting for the "call"

Allegiance was never a part of us
No union - neither friend, nor foe
Destruction will never devour us
United, we're forging home

We defy
This word reforms in silence
We defy
We strive to ignore the violence
We defy
In time we'll defeat any tyrant
We defy
We're only waiting for the "call"
