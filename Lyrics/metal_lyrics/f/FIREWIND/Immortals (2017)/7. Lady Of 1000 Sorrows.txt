She lives her days just one by one
Decrypting thoughts inside her mind
No right, no wrong, no in-between
She tells all that she knows
So the truth can be exposed

She's a lady of a thousand sorrows
Breaks into trance before my eyes
She's a lady of a thousand sorrows
Tell me how, tell me where, tell me why?
Let me know my fortune

Her word are spoken with a gentle tongue
Declares the doom to unfold
And all t do is to move on
Are you the forgotten son
And are you the chosen one?

She's a lady of a thousand sorrows
Breaks into trance before my eyes
She's a lady of a thousand sorrows
Tell me how, tell me where, tell me why?

...Blackened clouds hanging over me
Should I face the danger to become immortal?
Strapped in iron, roaming endlessly
I will challenge Xerxes and become immortal...
