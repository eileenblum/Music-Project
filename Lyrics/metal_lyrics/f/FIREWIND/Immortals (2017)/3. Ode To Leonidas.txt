âI, Leonidas,
Son of the lion
Keeper of the gates of fire
To all the noble souls of this land
If you spill your blood with me
I shall tend to your wounds
If you thirst from battle
Then I shall give you my cup
If you follow me
I shall lead you to Sparta
Under the stars of the gods themselves
Together we shall rid this world of the Persian beast
And to you, thy enemy of this land
I say: molon labe, molon labeâ¦
Come and take itâ

Iâll dominate you, and sacrifice too
My army will destroy your plans
No competition, or indecision
Youâre coming to your end â
And my warâs begun

Those mortals canât defend you
A suicide rendezvous
Iâll have you running like a child â away
Itâs not so complicated
300 terminated
No choice to choose, youâre on my own.
Whoâs gonna save you?

They know the consequences
Endure the pain
The blood they try to save
Will be only split in vain

No sleep â for Leonidas
Got to rise against Immortals and the
Kingdom of the East
No sleep â for Leonidas
From a deadlock to distraction
Will there be satisfaction when theyâre gone?

Under the pass awaits you
Our flanks of pride and virtue
Your missile shadows will not bound this cause
Like us there are no others
A troop of warrior brothers
Even in battle we defend our dead

They know the consequences
Endure the pain
The blood they try to save
Will be only split in vain

No sleep â for Leonidas
Got to rise against Immortals and the
Kingdom of the East
No sleep â for Leonidas
From a deadlock to distraction
Will there be satisfaction when theyâre gone?
