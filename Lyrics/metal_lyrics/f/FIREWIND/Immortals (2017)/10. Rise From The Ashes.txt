Still waiting, for nothing
Live a lie in total isolation
So jaded, deflated
From living life all alone
Such wasted time

So many questions still
In the minds of all the people
Should our regimes combine
Whoâs the master of the throne?

Rise from the ashes, renew the devotion
For the challengers soon will submit to the ocean
Rise from the ashes, stop drowning in sorrow
To be sure that tomorrow will come,
Rise above again!

Can you hear them? So desperateâ¦
So many words spoken, no oneâs listening
We want it, and we need it
But all our fear seem to guide us to nowhere

All those twisted minds
That will try to take our freedom
Will then soon run and hide
For itâs time to take control

Rise from the ashes, renew the devotion
For the challengers soon will submit to the ocean
Rise from the ashes, stop drowning in sorrow
To be sure that tomorrow will come,
Rise above!

Rise above again!
Oh oh oh, rise above the ashes
For your freedom, rise above again.
