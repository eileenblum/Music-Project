No agreements, or common grounds
Just fallen empires, with broken crowns
The streets are vacant, no life to be found.
But what's the point to rule, when there's no one left around?

The tyranny of freedom, the choices all at hand
Are left to be decided by the wealthy and the grand
This reign of evil must soon be taken down

Justice soon will be done
All forsaken must believe

Warriors and saints defending honor
Fighting for the equity of man
These warriors I follow with a blind faith
Deep into the trenches of the final battle

Risen from the ashes, a man of mortal soul
Has taken it upon himself to defend the young and old
Their cries for guidance will not be overheard

Warriors and saints defending honor
Fighting for the equity of man
These warriors I follow with a blind faith
Deep into the trenches of the final battle
