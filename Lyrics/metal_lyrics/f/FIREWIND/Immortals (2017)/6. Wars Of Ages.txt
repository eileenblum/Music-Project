Itâs about that time, gotta stake your claim
And do what youâve gotta do, get right into their face
But the game is changing, who could ever know
What is going on right now? Whereâd the cowards go?

Wars of ages, turn the pages
Run away, admit defeat

The fire and winds wonât bring down Salamis
A thousand ships canât save you
Your forces rise to bring down Salamis
But no oneâs going to hear those feeble cries

Put your best man in, let him show him the way
You canât stop now, thereâs too much at stake
Now the tides are changing, on the dark blue sea
Take your men and regroup now, find your destiny

Wars of ages, turn the pages
Run away, admit defeat

The fire and winds wonât bring down Salamis
A thousand ships canât save you
Your forces rise to bring down Salamis
But no oneâs going to hear those feeble cries
