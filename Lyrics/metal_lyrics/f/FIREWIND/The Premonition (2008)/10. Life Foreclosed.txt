[Music: Gus G., Lyrics: David T. Chastain]

Dark clouds, on the horizon
Black thoughts, within your mind
Deep within, the cold and darkness
You know it's our time

The world goes on without you
The evil survives
The world bleeds more day by day
No one even tries

Life foreclosed and payment is due
It's the end for me and you
Blood and destruction,Anger's seduction
The earth screams her last cries

We are the destroyers of life
We are the bringers of pain
We are the last ones alive
We know that it's true
Yes, we know that it's true

Endless war, a trait of man
Endless hate, is all we understand
Endless poor, hold out their hands
Endless greed, just turned and ran

And the world looks on
in anguish
At life's suicide

Life foreclosed
Life foreclosed
Life foreclosed
