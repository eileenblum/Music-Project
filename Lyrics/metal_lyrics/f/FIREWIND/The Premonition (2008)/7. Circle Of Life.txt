[Music: Gus G., Lyrics: Mark Cross, Apollo Papathanasio]

Tears of rage
Have fallen of my face
I cannot hide
My dreams keep holding me tight

To be alive
Is the gift and goal of mankind?
Creative minds
So brave but hard to find

Show no fear, (keep) your head up high
Time goes by and arrows fly

Have I lost my mind?
The truth now shows that I was blind
It made me change my mind
It's the circle of life

Tears of a coward, tears of shame
I found my way, to win this game

Do your best, just stay awake
What you got no one can take

Have I lost my mind?
The truth now shows that I was blind
It made me change my mind
It's the circle of life
