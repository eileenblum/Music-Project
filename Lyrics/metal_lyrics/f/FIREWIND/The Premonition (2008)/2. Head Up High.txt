[Music: Gus G., Bob Katsionis, Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio, Gus G.]

You're a dreamer and you live in a world
Of lies full of sinners
You will never understand
You're a great deceiver a result of a system
That's fake and always holds you
Are you really in command?

This is the time to change and make things right
This is the time to make it on your own

You'll never be yourself,
Don't ever lose your pride
Just find out who you are
You keep your head up high

You're not a believer you just go with the flow
Never an achiever
You will suffer in the end
You thing you're a winner but this game you play
Will make you burn in fire
Smile and wake up dead

You're not forever so you're aiming higher
You stumble in every step you take

You'll never be yourself,
Don't ever lose your pride
Just find out who you are
You keep your head up high
