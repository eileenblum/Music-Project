[Music: Gus G., Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio, Gus G., Mark Cross]

Break me, cut me in two
The pain is curving deeper, but I will get through
Don't save me, I've heard it all before
I'm picking up the pieces that I spread all over you

We just obey the silent code
I'm sick and tired
We're floating in an endless flood

And I'll cry for you
And I'll smile for you
I can do what you want
I can be who you want me to be
Won't you set me free?

Hit me, I'm sick of it all
It won't make any difference cause it's not in my control
Steer me, I can't do a thing
I'll follow your direction, and I will obey the call

We just obey the silent code
I'm sick and tired
It's an endless flood

And I'll cry for you
And I'll smile for you
I can do what you want
I can be who you want me to be
Won't you set me free?

I can compromise,
But you must realize that one day
I will break free
