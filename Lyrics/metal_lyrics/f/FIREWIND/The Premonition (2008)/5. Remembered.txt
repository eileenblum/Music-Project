[Music: Gus G., Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio, Niclas Engelin]

All my fears are gone since I don't know when
But the path I chose has made me strong

Demons of the past are here
They push for revolution
Trying to manipulate my brain
I found my own solution

I won't crawl for you again
I will never go insane

Do the things you want to do and let your spirit guide you through
In a life worth being remembered
Don't look back you won't regret, forgive, forget and never hate
Isn't it how you want to be remembered?

Through the darkest days don't let anxiety
Embrace your soul just stay awake

Demons tried to tear me down
Start the revelations
My barricades are made of steel
I faced my situations

Do the things you want to do and let your spirit guide you through
In a life worth being remembered
Don't look back you won't regret, forgive, forget and never hate
Isn't it how you want to be remembered?
