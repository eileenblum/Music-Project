[Music: Bob Katsionis, Gus G., Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio]

I can remember when I was really blinded by the light
Then everything was black
I fell down wounded
Didn't have the strength to wake my spirit
Couldn't keep my head up high

So much at stake in here, can't turn wine into water

I fall into despair
In one life, in one minute
Everything will change your spirit

No one seems to care
Angels forgive me, there is no return

Had to surrender slowing down my life, it wasn't easy
Trying to rest my bones
But I'm still haunted
By a thousand ghosts, and still I'm drowning
Flashes of the past

So much at stake in here, can't turn wine into water

I fall into despair
In one life, in one minute
Everything will change your spirit

No one seems to care
Angels forgive me, forgive me
I close my eyes
