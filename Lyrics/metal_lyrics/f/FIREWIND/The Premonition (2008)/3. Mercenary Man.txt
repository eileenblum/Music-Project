[Music: Apollo Papathanasio, Gus G., Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio]

Mama take a look at your boy
Face a man without a soul
He is standing in the doorway
I'll be gone, before the night is over
I have to go, I have to run to the border

Lost my way I run in desperation
Lost the words I lost communication

All I see is death beneath my window
All I need is to heal my broken mind
I will catch my own wounded shadow
Just before we leave it all behind

Mama keep the faith it's alright
Your boy's a mercenary man
A soldier made of steel
A shotgun rings; the wind is calling my name
Fields of gold beneath a blood red sky

Lost my way I run in desperation
Lost the words I lost communication

All I see is death beneath my window
All I need is to heal my broken mind
I will catch my own wounded shadow
Just before we leave it all behind

Just before we leave it all behind
