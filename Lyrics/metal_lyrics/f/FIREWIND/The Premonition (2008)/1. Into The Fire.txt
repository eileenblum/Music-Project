[Music: Gus G., Bob Katsionis, Lyrics: Gus G., Apollo Papathanasio]

Here we are again, martyrs of the revolution
The countdown of the human pain
Nothing left to burn, witnessing the prosecution
Killing ourselves time and again

Save me! Don't let them take my life from me
Help me! My fears become reality

Into the fire
No need to pray for me
Into the fire
My tears are black so set me free

Hellfire burns again, angels of this constitution
The day of reckoning we'll learn
We're marching to the end, to the final execution
This blackest day, there's no return

Save me! Don't let them take my life from me
Help me! Eternal pain is what I feel

Into the fire
No need to pray for me
Into the fire
My tears are black so set me free
