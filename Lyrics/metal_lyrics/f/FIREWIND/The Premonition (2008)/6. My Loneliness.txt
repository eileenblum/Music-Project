[Music: Gus G., Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio]

My loneliness makes you feel insecure
My loneliness will never let you find a cure
My loneliness has no directions for me and you
My loneliness speaks no truth of what you do
Listen to what I say

Turn me in
You're going crazy and I can't stand to feel your tears over me
Turn me in
It's not a crime to feel the way that I do, again and again

My loneliness does not lead you to my core
My loneliness always tell you to ignore
My loneliness, a waste of time if there's no trust
My loneliness is turning everything to dust
Listen to what I say

Turn me in
You're going crazy and I can't stand to feel your tears over me
Turn me in
It's not a crime to feel the way that I do, again and again

No one can save us from this pain
I wish that I could stop the rain
These dark gray skies are closing in

Oh
You're going crazy and I can't stand to feel your tears over me
Turn me in
It's not a crime to feel the way that I do, again and again
