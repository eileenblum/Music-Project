[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

You follow religion
You have to believe
You don't ask for reason
Cause you're just so naive
But what they don't tell you
Is that they're in control
They give out a little
Then take your body and soul

Confusion, delusion, you feel there's no solution
Desire, on fire, don't you think it's time to believe

Why can't you see it's the sign of times
Blind leading the blind, into the ark of lies

The new world uprising
To take out the rats
They run but they can't hide
From the furious wrath
Their unholy mission
Is to sweep up the trash
The days of defiance
Revolt of the mass

Confusion, delusion, you feel there's no solution
Desire, on fire, don't you think it's time to believe

Why can't you see it's the sign of times
Blind leading the blind, into the ark of lies

Why can't you see it's the sign of times
Blind leading the blind, into the ark of lies

Blind leading the blind
Blind leading the blind

Why can't you see it's the sign of times
Blind leading the blind, into the ark of lies

Why can't you see it's the sign of times
Blind leading the blind, into the ark of lies
