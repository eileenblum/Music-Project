[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

Fly away. Fly with broken wings my angel
Never stay leave the cold leave the sorrow
Hold on (hold on) even if your world's colliding
Dream on (dream on) no one can take your breath you're winding

And I know when you're free, you will see
All is gone, when you're drifting away
Take your time everything will be fine
On your own till the end of the day

Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh from the day that you begun

When all is said and done

Drift away you feel you don't belong to someone
Never pray don't trust a false messiah
Keep on even when your world is burning
Carry on days of defiance you are yearning

And I know when you're free, you will see
All is gone, when you're drifting away
Take your time everything will be fine
On your own till the end of the day

Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh you've only just begun
Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh, don't stay just hit and run

Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh you've only just begun
Oh, oh, when all is said and done
Oh, oh, don't stay just hit and run

When all is said and done
Hold on, dream on, carry on
