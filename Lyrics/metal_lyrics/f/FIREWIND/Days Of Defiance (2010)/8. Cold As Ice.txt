[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

I'm going out to war
I have to face the pain
We're damaged people and we suffer from our own reign
Trapped in my own domain
I wonder who's to blame
We can't pay the prize for this kind of paradise

I'm going out to war
Don't wanna live in vain
I have to meet my enemy
I've had in my dreams
I've lost my empathy
I crashed my harmony
We'll never see the day if we don't role the very dice

I send you my life
I send you my soul
Enlighten me again
I'm awake

I feel cold as ice, I am hypnotized
Always turn away
We are cold as ice in a big device
We'll drown in our own clay
I feel cold as ice, I am paralyzed
Always turn away
We are cold as ice in a big device
Why did we go astray

I walk across the end
And lose my clarity
We're lost children
And we're diving in the blackest sea
Who do we think we are?
Just a grain of sand
But so much power
In this tiny little human hand

I send you my life
I send you my soul
Enlighten me again
I'm awake

I feel cold as ice, I am hypnotized
Always turn away
We are cold as ice in a big device
We'll drown in our own clay
I feel cold as ice, I am paralyzed
Always turn away
We are cold as ice in a big device
Why did we go astray

I'm cold as ice
I'm cold as ice
I'm cold as

I feel cold as ice, I am hypnotized
Always turn away
We are cold as ice in a big device
We'll drown in our own clay
I feel cold as ice, I am paralyzed
Always turn away
We are cold as ice in a big device
Why did we go astray

I'm cold as ice
I'm cold as ice
I'm cold as
I'm cold as ice
