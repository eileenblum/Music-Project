[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

What would you do?
If someone put a gun to your head
What if someone says?
Kill or in seconds you'll be dead

Would you leave your moral constraints?
Killing all the fools
A bitter sweet vengeance
You break away from rules
You'll disappear in darkness
When all you see is black
Be a broken hero
You're never coming back

Here is your world. Here is your world
You will kill in the name of love
A brand new world, and days of great suffering
Can you kill in the name of love

How will you react?
If someone stabbed your best friend in the back
What will be the price?
Is there justice overriding love, no, no

Would you break away from confines?
To kill the greatest fool
Something's taken over
Searching for a tool
You'll disappear in darkness
When all you see is black
Be a broken hero
Or a walking wounded man

Here is your world. Here is your world
You will kill in the name of love
A brand new world, and days of great suffering
Can you kill in the name of love

Kill in the name of love
When the blood is rising
Kill in the name of love
All you see is black
Kill in the name of love
Need to think about it
Kill in the name of love
Or be a blinded fool with anger

Hold on can't wait 'till tomorrow
Someone will kill in the name of love
Hold on can you take the sorrow
Can you kill in the name of love

Here is your world. Here is your world
You will kill in the name of love
A brand new world, and days of great suffering
Are you the one who will kill in the name of love

Kill in the name of love
Kill in the name of love
