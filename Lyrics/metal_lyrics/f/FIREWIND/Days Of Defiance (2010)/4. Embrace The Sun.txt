Step outside this spinning wheel and you'll see its turning
All the shadows now will disappear and you're burning
You can't change the world, but you can change yourself
Slowly turning dust into a shape

Embrace the sun, you won't get hurt
Don't be afraid, is it so hard to understand?
Embrace the sun, embrace the sun
Inhale the air, there's nothing wrong
Just breathe, caress the flame of life and you'll be strong
Embrace the sun, embrace the sun

At the end of the sea you will find there is no horizon
And don't fantasize but your fortune is here for a reason
You can't change the world, but you can change yourself
Try to turn the dust into a shape

Embrace the sun,you won't get hurt
Don't be afraid, is it so hard to understand?
Embrace the sun, embrace the sun
Inhale the air, there's nothing wrong

Just breathe, caress the flame of life and you'll be strong
Embrace the sun,embrace the sun

Face your life and stop pretending
Now you're caught in the eye of the world
Now it's time for an ending

You won't get hurt
Don't be afraid, is it so hard to understand?
Embrace the sun, embrace the sun
Inhale the air, there's nothing wrong
Just breathe, caress the flame of life and you'll be strong
Embrace the sun, embrace the sun

Don't be afraid
You won't get hurt
Don't be afraid
