[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

There are things I should have said
And there are things I shouldn't have
What I kept inside
Has only hurt my pride
This is my only regret

Falling down
Face the demon now
Break the spell

Oh Chariot, I'm made of sun and stars
Oh Chariot, blow up my iron bars
Oh Chariot, black wheels will burn the ground
Oh Chariot, I hear this magic sound

Maybe I am better off alone
And go my own way
Maybe I don't  know what I want
But I don't care what they say

Falling down
Face the demon now
Break the spell

Oh Chariot, I'm made of sun and stars
Oh Chariot, blow up my iron bars
Oh Chariot, black wheels will burn the ground
Oh Chariot, I hear this magic sound

Oh Chariot, I'm made of sun and stars
Oh Chariot, blow up my iron bars
Oh Chariot, black wheels will burn the ground
Oh Chariot, I hear this magic sound

Oh Chariot,
Falling down
Break the spell
Oh Chariot,
Bring me the universe
Oh Chariot,
Falling down
Break the spell
Oh Chariot,
My belief will not be cursed
