[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

Now that all my dreams come true
They seem a frozen false reality
And though my hopes have not all gone
It's you to bring me out of all this vanity

But I'm still here to break the ice
I'll never give up the fight

Yearning to remember
That my dream can be reality
Yearning to remember
So I can live another day

Stop this moment and believe
I'm not afraid to show you who I am
I know I'm a passenger of life
I seize the day I try so hard to understand

But I'm still here to break the ice
I'll never give up the fight

Yearning to remember
That my dream can be reality
Yearning to remember
So I can live another day

Yearning to remember

But I'm still here to break the ice
I'll never give up the fight

Yearning to remember
That my dream can be reality
Yearning to remember
So I can live another day

Yearning to remember
