[Bonus Track]They call you wild rose
I hold you but you're not there
Face pale like snow
It's more that I can bear

A cold wind is blowing
I feel so cold I'm stumbling blind
I can't hear you breathing
I'm lost without you

YOU'RE LIKE THE SUN THAT SHINES ON ME
HOW CAN I EVER BE FREE ?

YOU'RE LIKE THE SUN A SPARK IN MY LIFE
TELL ME WHY WILD ROSE OF MINE

They call you wild rose
So close but so far away
Heaven only knows
The eyes that never betray

I can't hear your breathing; feel a cold breeze
Now I am falling, I'm lost without you

YOU'RE LIKE THE SUN THAT SHINES ON ME
HOW CAN I EVER BE FREE ?

YOU'RE LIKE THE SUN A SPARK IN MY LIFE
TELL ME WHY WILD ROSE OF MINE

It burns within me, lost in emptiness
The world is spinning around me, spinning around me

If I could turn back the time again - I'd never leave you
If I could turn back the time again - To give you reason
If I could turn back the time again - Turn the time again
