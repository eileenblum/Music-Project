[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

Eyes are open wide
You're dying slowly
Lost in space and time
You're feeling lonely
Shadows moving fast
Cluster around you
Whispers in your head
You're left in confusion

It's breaking my heart
To see you walking through the night
It's breaking my heart
To see you fall, no one in sight
It's breaking my heart
You fell, you're giving up the fight
It's breaking my heart
When you can't see what's wrong or right

Walls of shame you see
You're tired and frozen
You ripped yourself apart
You feel like dreaming
You walk on broken glass
There's no reaction
A strange erratic breeze
No introspection

It's breaking my heart
To see you walking through the night
It's breaking my heart
To see you fall and no one in sight
It's breaking my heart
You fell, you're giving up the fight
It's breaking my heart
When you can't see what's wrong or right

So hard to console

It's breaking my heart
To see you walking through the night
It's breaking my heart
To see you fall, no one in sight
It's breaking my heart
You fell, you're giving up the fight
It's breaking my heart
When you can't see what's wrong or right

Don't wanna see you fall from grace
Don't wanna see you fall from an empty space
I've lost the best thing that I had in life
Lay your head on my shoulder tonight
