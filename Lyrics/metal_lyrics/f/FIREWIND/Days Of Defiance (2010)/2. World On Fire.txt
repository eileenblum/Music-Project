[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

Recreation a man's design
Then destruction to resign
Hear the prayers. Feel the truth
Holy Ghost

Dislocation spirits fall
Suffocation we need control
Were all the same through different life
Holy land

Oh, future is calling us

And I, I'll set the world on fire
I will rise through the wind
And I, I'll set the world on fire
Worlds colliding in me

Set the world on fire
Set the world on fire

Deprivation end this void
Explanation need to avoid
With just one voice, and just an act
We take their place

Oh, future is calling us

And I, I'll set the world on fire
I will rise through the wind
And I, I'll set the world on fire
Worlds colliding in me

Set the world on fire
Set the world on fire
Set the world on fire
Set the world on fire

And I, I'll set the world on fire
I will rise through the wind
And I, I'll set the world on fire
Worlds colliding in me

Set the world on fire
