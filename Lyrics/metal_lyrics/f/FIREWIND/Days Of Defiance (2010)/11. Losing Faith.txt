[Gus G. - Apollo Papathanasio - Petros Christo - Bob Katsionis - Michael EhrÃ©]

I wear the scars on my dirty face
Just because of you
I wear the mist in my darkest day
I can feel the tears from the sun

I feel a rush in my veins
I won't crawl I will breathe

I'm losing faith in you
Whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself
These days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you
What you have become
In these days of no trust
Days of no trust

I can't ignore, our faith's bleeding fast
Who will work things out?
Provide yourself from these greedy lies
I can touch my anger from within

I feel a rush in my veins
I won't crawl I will breathe

I'm losing faith in you
Whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself
These days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you
What you have become
In these days of no trust

Forever is so far away
We need to see a brand new day
Endless spinning carries on
The unforgiving will be gone
Into eternity
Eternity, eternity

I'm losing faith in you
Whatever you might say
I can't stand to lose myself
These days of no trust
I'm losing faith in you
What you have become
In these days of no trust
