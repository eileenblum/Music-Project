Gazing at the stars
We're flying over million restless souls
A dream that keeps me alive
We're always reaching higher for the skies

Oh we're million miles away
We're far away from home
We're million miles away
Oh we're million miles away
We're heading for the dawn
we're million miles away

We turned the bends
We're crossing all the oceans
For desire and for pain
We come and go, we feel
We're heading for new places that's insane

Oh we're million miles away
Our spirit never dies
We're million miles away
Oh we're million miles away
Our keeper never lies
we're million miles away

Oh we're million miles away
We're far away from home
We're million miles away
Oh we're million miles away
We're heading for the dawn
we're million miles away
