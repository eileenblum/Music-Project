[Music: Bob Katsionis - Lyrics: Gus G., Apollo Papathanasio]

How do you think we can survive?
No angels by your side
This is no dream, it's here and now

How can we make it through the night?
This demon we must fight
Visions of hell within my mind

But we must carry on
Carry on...

Till the end of time â we will stand
Till the end of time â oh, we lost the spark
Till the end of time â searching in the dark
Spirits of the wind â my death command

Time is not a friend of mine
Today the sun won't shine
Just a boundless grey fills the sky

Why? No matter how I try
The beast just won't die
Is it worth fighting for?

But we must carry on
Carry on...

Till the end of time â we will stand
Till the end of time â oh, we lost the spark
Till the end of time â searching in the dark
Spirits of the wind â my death command
