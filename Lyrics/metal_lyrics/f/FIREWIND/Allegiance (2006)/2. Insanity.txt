[Music: Gus G., Bob Katsionis - Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio, Gus G.]

Inside of me â there are no feelings
Can't you see â that it's killing me?
You've built a shield â you've burned your bridges
Marking me â as your enemy

Now release me â beware the beast
Desire is my way of life

I will follow you wherever you go from here
Don't save me...

One... I am the one
Watching your secret dreams turn to insanity
One... one ancient life
Will make you fall from grace into eternity

Please release me â from these chains
I feel trapped in a mysterious sin
Things within me â gonna blind you out
I'm heading out for blood

I will follow you wherever you go from here
Don't save me...

One... I am the one
Watching your secret dreams turn to insanity
One... one ancient life
Will make you fall from grace into eternity
