[Music: Gus G. - Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio]

Be yourself tonight don't stress yourself to death
Don't try to fight the time
Synchronize your health
Don't think you'll lose it all
It all comes back to you
So get your soul alive
Things will go on through

Don't hide behind a dark and empty soul
Don't lie to yourself no more

Everything is you
But you're falling to pieces
Let me get you through
I'm falling down with you
Everything is lost
I help you through the darkness
Let me lead you to a place that's calm for you

Like stormy weather
You're moving with no goal
Feeling kind of strange
Feel you want to growl

Don't hide behind a dark and empty soul
Don't lie to yourself no more

Everything is you
But you're falling to pieces
Let me get you through
I'm falling down with you
Everything is lost
I help you through the darkness
Let me lead you to a place that's calm for you
