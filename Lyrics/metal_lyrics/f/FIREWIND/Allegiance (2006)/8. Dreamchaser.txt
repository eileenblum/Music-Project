[Music &amp; Lyrics: Mark Cross]

There comes the time
When the past is forgotten
Times have changed and it's all for real
Mind your anger
A lesson taught here
Just take a look around and do what you feel

Sense your mind
Can you name it as a color
Red for danger
White for sight
It could be true
You're looking for another
Where you're at boy
It just ain't right

Sigh
Feel the temptation
High
No aggravation, no lie
Take the path
Walk the line

Be a
Dream chaser
Sheer racer
Steam raiser
Be a dream chaser

Head out to fly...

Hey, are you just another face in the crowd
With nothing to give
All you do is hang around?
Don't you want a new toy
A new sensation?
Just give in the play
The price you have to pay

Be a
Dream chaser
Sheer racer
Steam raiser
Dream chaser
