[Music: Gus G., Bob Katsionis - Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio, Mark Cross]

I hear voices screaming, haunted by demons
This willful crime has done it's last crime

I see my dirty face smiling through the tears
Silent voices telling me to treason

All my tears, all my tears turn into rage, into rage
Now all that's tuned my fears
All my fears turned into strength
It built my strength

Breaking â breaking the silence
Hiding â I'm tired of hiding
I know â I'll make my way out of this mess

Breaking â breaking the silence
Fighting â I will die fighting
I know â my courage will last forever

My heart is aching, my love is fading
So tired of living in fear

Oh, there's nowhere to run
My shade has taken all my pride
Need to step out, can't rely on other prayers

All my tears, all my tears turn into rage, into rage
Now all that's tuned my fears
All my fears turned into strength
I don't want to fall

Breaking â breaking the silence
Hiding â I'm tired of hiding
I know â I'll make my way out of this mess

Breaking â breaking the silence
Fighting â I will die fighting
I know â my courage will last forever
