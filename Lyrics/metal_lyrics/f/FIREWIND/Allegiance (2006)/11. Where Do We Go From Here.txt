[Music: Apollo Papathanasio, Gus G. - Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio]

I didn't know that I could feel this way
Now that you are gone
Not even in my wildest dreams
Imagine that a part of me was gone

Everywhere that I go
I only think of you
No matter how I try to concentrate
I can't forget you
Where do we go?
How could we fly?
What are we searching for in dreams?

Where do we go from here now
The beginning is the end?
Where do we go from here now
When nothing feels the same?

My needs for you are hard to leave behind
I know that I swore
You broke the rules, said you'd never leave
My heart stopped beating when you closed the door

Where do we go?
How could we fly?
What are we searching for?

Where do we go from here now
The beginning is the end?
Where do we go from here now
When nothing feels the same?
Where do we go from here now
The beginning is the end?
Where do we go from here now
My broken heart you could only mend?
