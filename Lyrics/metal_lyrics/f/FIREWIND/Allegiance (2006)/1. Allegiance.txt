[Music: Gus G - Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio, Mark Cross]

They feed you lies, they bring you pain
Your life, sucked from your veins
Clever disguise, falling from grace
And now the sinners marching on

Inside my mind
Warlike thoughts are taking over me

See our generation torn, our burning hearts
No more praises in the hall
We're all about to fall
Empty memories are shattering our dreams
Can you recall?

Pledge your allegiance!
Pledge your allegiance!

You hate them â yet you won't betray
The wars you fight ain't yours!
The path of no return you take
Until you lose control

Inside my mind
Warlike thoughts are taking over me

See our generation torn, our burning hearts
No more praises in the hall
We're all about to fall
Empty memories are shattering our dreams
Can you recall?
