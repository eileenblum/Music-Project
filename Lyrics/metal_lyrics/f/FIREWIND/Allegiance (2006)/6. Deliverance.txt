[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gus G.]

Streets full of madness
And I don't know where to turn
Driving me insane I have to get away
The one-eyed leads the blind to decay

Can't keep away...

A moment seems an eternity
A lifetime lived in a dream
Over and again but you know the end
Do you have the same dream like me?

And my spirit is free
I'm more than what you can see
I will make you believe

Can't keep away...

Through endless fields of fire
I've walked among the dead
Forced of greed, taking the lead
Our souls are hanging by a thread

And my spirit is free
I'm more than what you can see
I will make you believe

And my spirit, rides the breeze...
