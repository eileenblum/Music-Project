[Music: Gus G. - Lyrics: Gus G., Apollo Papathanasio]

The more I know, the more I hear
It only makes me think
Uncertain is our time, and dear
And what is to remain?

You walked through fire
You carried your own cross
And you can't deny it
The sickness has no cause
In my darkest and sleepless nights
I want you to stand by my side
In the coldest of all times
I want you to be the light

The essence of it all
It's to live your life
Cause right before the storm
A new hope will arise

You have to face it
The battle for you life has just begun
Oh, there's no denying
Still fighting through the shadows of your soul
So I'm starting to lose my own faith
Feels like no one's around
Confusion is dazing my life
I have to conquer my fears

The essence of it all
It's to live your life
Cause right before the storm
A new hope will arise
