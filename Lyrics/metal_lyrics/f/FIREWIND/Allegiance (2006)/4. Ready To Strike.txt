[Music: Gus G., Bob Katsionis - Lyrics: Apollo Papathanasio]

Tell me the story about last night
Tell me that you won't give up the fight
Tell me that you believe
Do the thing you want to do
Tell me you'll keep these wings up high
Tell me what you won't stay there and cry
Tell me that all hell will break loose
Tell me there is no good excuse

No one can stop this time machine
It keeps on rollin' till the dawn
If you want to join this dark engine

We're ready to strike
We're ready to strike across the oceans
In the dead of the night

Tell me you'll keep this faith alive
Tell me that you won't stay there and sigh
Tell me you'll turn this place upside down
I tell you that no one messes me around
Tell me the story about last night
Tell me that you won't give up the fight
Tell me that you believe
Do the thing you want to do

No one can stop this time machine
It keeps on rollin' till the dawn
If you want to join this dark engine

We're ready to strike
We're ready to strike across the oceans
In the dead of the night

Just like a fragile weather you're trembling in the wind
Your fear is closing in you stay there till you bleed
With no tear you will sail across the oceans
Like a storm coming out through the darkness

We're ready to strike
We're ready to strike across the oceans
In the dead of the night
