Didn't mean to cause you trouble.
Didn't mean to cause you pain.
I never though this could turn out this way,
Maybe I am a big mistake.

Didn't mean to say these words.
Didn't mean to hurt your pride.
We are looking far some inspiration,
I never found it in your heart.

Walking on the edge of a dream.
Cant you see that I am real?
Pretend that it's for ever!
Walking to the edge of the world,
We belong in our dream,
For a while you feel the silence.

Only looking for forgiveness
And when the ship is sinking fast
I only looking for a sign that tells me
Where I can walk through this endless field.

Walking on the edge of a dream.
Cant you see that I am real?
Pretend that it's for ever.
Walking to the edge of the world,
We belong in our dream,
For a while you feel the silence.
Waiting for the weight of the world
In a place so cold!
If tomorrow never comes
Hold my hand one last time, one last call
If tomorrow never comes!

Tomorrow never comes...
