I'm watching the mountains
So high in their prime
Like all of our brothers
Defenders of time
I stand by the river
So innocent, divine
Thinking there are no heroes
Only vengeance and crimes

Can't we see we are, 
Can't we feel we are
Can't we try all as one
Bonded flesh, bonded blood,
bonded life in one sound

There will be no more heroes
Only a violent sky
There will be no more sinners
You could ask yourself why

No heroes, no sinners No heroes
Among killing fields
No values no names
Is there peace in the twilight?
Is there an end to theses games?

Can't we see we are, 
Can't we feel we are
Can't we try all as one
Bonded flesh, bonded blood,
bonded life in one sound

There will be no more heroes
Only a violent sky
There will be no more sinners
You could ask yourself why
Will we ever change?
What do you want in exchange?
Will we ever change?
No heroes - no sinners -No heroes - No
