You've got a one way ticket to hell,
To give you pain
The things that you wan't to forget,
They still remain

(You won't have your change
You won't have your change)

Remind me before I forget,
You wash your sins away
But if you could do it again,
You would refrain

What about the life?
(Life!)
What about those who died in vain?
What about the fight?
(The fight!)
For we are few against many!

There's only a much you can do,
To avoid your fate
And when you hear the crack of doom you will know,
There's no escape

What about life?
(Life!)
What about those who died in vain?
What about the fight?
(The fight!)
What about the need to fee for gain?
What about hate?
(Hate!)
Leaving all behind
In the fight,
You must do what is right...

'Cause we are few against many...

What about life?
(What about life!?)
What about those who died in vain?
What about the fight?
(Just win the fight!)
What about the need to fee for gain?
What about hate?
Leaving all behind
In the fight,
You must do what is right

(You won't have your change
You won't have your change)
You must win the fight,
You must do what is right!
You must win the fight,
You must do what is right.
