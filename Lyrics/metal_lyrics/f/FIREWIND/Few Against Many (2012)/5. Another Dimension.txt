Never felt - alive for one day
Then you might know how it feels
Misty days-the sun never shines
For the ones who are too blind to see

The greatest gift
Is the power within
The river flows
Inside your veins

When everything falls apart
You're looking for something
There's no beginning there's no end
Find another dimension

Don't you wait for this moment to come
Your heart is solid like stone
Are you ready? Take the chance
Revolution in silence

The greatest gift
is the power within
The river flows
Inside your veins

When everything falls apart
You're looking for something
There's no beginning, there's no end
To Find another dimension

When everything falls apart
You're looking for something
There's no beginning there's no end
Find another dimension
