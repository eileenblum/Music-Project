(We need to see our vision-we can make it come true
Living out our creation, no more sins to pay)

We need to see our vision, we can make it come true
Living out our creation, no more sins to pay
We are carried away, like a leaf in a rainstorm
We're all alone -all alone
How can we be strong?

We all see with clarity
One breath to feel as one

Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
Time to make a move we're the ones that will go on
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
The undying fire, takes you higher

We need a new direction to conquer and divide
We will be the navigators sworn to a great divine
Dont let it slip away, dont let it slip away
A desolation on and on, on and on
We know that we are strong

We all see with clarity
One breath to feel as one

Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
Time to make a move we're the ones that will go on
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
The undying fire takes you higher

There are no miracles the process is long
Raise your hands we can't -be- wrong

We all see with clarity
One breath to feel as one

Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
Time to make a move we're the ones that will go on
Fate is in our hands we need to carry on
The undying fire takes you higher

Raise - your - hands - fate is in our hands
Raise - your - hands - need to carry on
Raise - your - hands - don't let it slip away.
