Communication breakdown, fall on your knees
Overloaded system blood will now freeze
My generators working hard, overheats
Twenty tons of hardware, flooding the streets

You're glorious, you didn't fool me with mysteries
You've lost your pride, but you keep on singing same old song again, yeah

Don't wanna wait till tomorrow for a reaction of time
Sophisticated people, we're all burning inside
It's time to burn all the bridges and tear down the walls
In the end you are freedom, can you hear the calls?

You could dance the night away
Sons of bitches will betray
Forget tomorrow - today you have to pray

You're glorious, you didn't fool me with mysteries
You've lost your pride but you keep on singing same old song again, yeah 
You're glorious violators of histories
Get off my back 'cause you still keep singing same old song again, yeah
