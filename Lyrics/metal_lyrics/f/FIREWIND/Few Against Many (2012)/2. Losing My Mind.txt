Happiness dying slowly - Take life for what it is.
Every ordinary morning - This fucking pain you have to ease.

You can't find peace by avoiding life, I won't hand my head.
I won't breakdown.

When you have no remorse, things will turn around.
How does it feel when you're creeping on the ground?
How does it feel when you're creeping?

Yeah! I'm losing my mind!
Yeah! I'm losing my mind!

Deal with all your demons and play your cards so goddamn right.
Keep your sanity and vision, you'll loose it all if you just hide!

And the devil may care and feel no shame
When you fall to despair things will stay the same!
How does it feel when you're creeping?

Yeah! I'm losing my mind!
Yeah! I'm losing my mind!
Well, I am hungry for life!

I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am!
I just wanna get rid of this burden before I'm gone
Forever gone!

Yeah! I'm losing my mind
am I counting my days?
Yeah! I'm losing my mind!
That's just the way it goes.
Yeah! I'm losing my mind!
I am hungry for life!
