Î¤hey took it all - Wanted more from me
My Resistance, it's all I need!
Painted faces, Defective Swine.
No accusations - it's a free ride.

We are the WALL OF SOUND.
YEAH YEAH YEAH We'll reach the highest ground.
Carve your name on the thickest stone,
It'll remind them of who you are.

In the maze of imagination,
Can you feel my wall of sound?
In the maze of imagination
Can you feel my wall of sound?
Waving flags - one spoken voice
Elusive conflict - Revolution time
No detour - for hypocrites
Prepare the battle - face to face

Carve your name on the thickest stone.
It'll remind them of who you are!

In the maze of imagination,
Can you feel my wall of sound?
In the Maze of imagination,
Can you feel my wall of osund?
WALL OF SOUND (we are the wall of sound)
Wall of SOUND!

In the maze of imagination,
We unite in a sonic bound
In the Maze of your imagination,
Can you feel my wall of osund?
WALL OF SOUND (we are the wall of sound)
Wall of SOUND!
