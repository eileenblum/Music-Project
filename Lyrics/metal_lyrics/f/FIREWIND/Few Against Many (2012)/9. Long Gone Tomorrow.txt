All my engines burning
A journey starts to the underworld
No sympathy for the prayer
Cause I've been burned, like this before

You're wrong, I'm right
God knows I tried

I will be long gone tomorrow
And you will never ask me why
A shining star will hide my sorrow
But still my universe will die

I enter a new cosmos
In vortex I now disappear
I have no desire
To hear the song birds sing again

You're wrong, I'm right
God knows I tried

I will be long gone tomorrow
And you will never ask me why
A shining star will hide my sorrow
But still my universe will die
