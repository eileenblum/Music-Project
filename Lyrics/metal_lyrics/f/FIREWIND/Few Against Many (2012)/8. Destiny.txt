One touch, one breath
I'm drowning in your sweet confusion
I won't let go as long as
you will show your passion
One path, one step, the road
leads you out to nowhere
No fear, it's clear, I'll be there for you

I never knew that I could feel this way
Out of the blue memories remain
See your destiny here it comes
You're reaching for tomorrow
Leave your misery, seize the day
It will make you stronger
We can run away

Come alone and forget your sorrow
Oh it's your destiny
I see the signs but I stand still
Can't leave you, behind
Because you mean so much to me
You never knew that you could feel this way
Out of the blue memories remain

See your destiny, here it comes
You're reaching for tomorrow
Leave your misery, seize the day
It will make you stronger
We can run away come alone
And forget your sorrow
Oh! It's your destiny
