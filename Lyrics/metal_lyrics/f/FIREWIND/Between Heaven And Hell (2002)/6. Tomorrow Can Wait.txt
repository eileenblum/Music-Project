I've always had the power in me
Never lost control of will
Broken promises and lies
Too many pass before my eyes
All I ever wanted was you
But you left me now we're through

Hoping, waiting as time passes by
Searching for answers as my spirit dies
I am afraid, to wait another day
Tomorrow can wait, today I must be saved

My belief in love is gone
The heart and flesh and blood is stone

Tomorrow can wait
