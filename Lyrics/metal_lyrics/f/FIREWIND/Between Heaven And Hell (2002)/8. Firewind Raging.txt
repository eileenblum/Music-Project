They fear us, they cheer us
Dark mercenaries all
They need us, they feed us
Their silver and their gold
For there's no one to save them
From losing their lives in this world of wars

Firewind Raging

Their kingdom, their freedom
Hanging on their words
Black shadows, blood battles
Dying by the sword
For there's no one to save them
From losing their lives in this world of wars

Fear of death, the loss, the loathing
Tears of life, the cause, the loving
