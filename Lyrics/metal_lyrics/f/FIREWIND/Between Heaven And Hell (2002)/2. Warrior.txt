Born of blood, mysterious, fire and steel their loves
Land and kin, is everything, their only god is war

Hear of the ages when war was the world
An honor to die by the sword

Eons pass, the tales are told
Battlefields have all grown cold
Elders sing of warriors, hail to the glory of
Spirits soar to (the) most on high
The nether world their bodies lie
Legends on the warriors, hail to the glory of

Honor bound, too profound, the soldier's unbroken code
Kings and queens, castle keep, sacred ground they hold

Warriors of old, their glories be told
Warriors of old, hail to the glory of

Their glories be told, warriors of old
