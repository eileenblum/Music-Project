Practice what you preach, you can't win
I claim victory
We're not meant to be, can't you see
You are history

All is said and done - destination forever
Never to return - destination forever

When all is said and done, everything
Will come back to you
Seven deadly sins, tempted me
Now they've turned to you

Destination forever - destination forever
