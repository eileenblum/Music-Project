Does man rule by his will
To choose how he lives
Are forces behind him
Pushing him still
Confusion - it's so clear
Illusion - here and there

Raven, hawk and the dove
Soar looking down from above
Evil, war and love
Which will alight on this world

A world full of conflict
Time patiently waits
Emotions directing
The choices he makes
Confusion - it's so clear
Illusion - here and there

Forces of the universe, taking aim
Spirit's eye, from on high, man is game
