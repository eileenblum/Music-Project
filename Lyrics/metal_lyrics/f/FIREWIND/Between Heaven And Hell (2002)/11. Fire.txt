In the aftermath, everything will clear
But the ones who stand, have no fear
Can you feel the fire, that burns inside
Can't live without it, it's something I can't deny

Living my life in fire, burning in sweet desire
Want to get higher and higher, I don't mind the consequences
Living my life in fire, burning in sweet desire
Want to get higher and higher, I want to live forevermore

Burning fire, in my soul, flames grow higher
More and more

We're running out of time, is there an answer
Only the fire, remains, forever it burns
My desire, it burns inside of me
I can't live without it, it's something I just can't hide
