Who am I, where have I come from
In this time, have I been before
Who is she, in this goddess form
Love divine, soul and flesh restored

In the infinite expanse of time
There are spirits we can't deny

Fire and ice, hand in hand creating life
Man and wife, the ancients have foretold
Still a spark, is struck by whose device
No one knows, how love immortal grows

Oh! I have seen, so many things, not through my eyes
What have I done, to be so born, of ancient lore
Oh! She has been everything, my soul desired
Love conquers all, our spirits are forever more
