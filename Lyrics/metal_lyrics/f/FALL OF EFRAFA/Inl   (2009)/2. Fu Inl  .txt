My brother be,
calm amongst withered grain.
Come join me,
from life's ebb we shall refrain.
Your failing eyes half blindly
stare and glimpse this fevered face,
valediction.
You marked this earth with calloused hands,
broke bread amongst your kin.
Another haggard conquered pawn,
a discarded volunteer.
A husk with an idea of life,
with eyes burning like fire,
valediction.

Cast aside these earthly woes,
you wove this tapestry of battles.
I'll pay you pittance for your days,
yet loosen all your shackles.
I am the seer in the dark,
the vagabond of yore,
valediction.
I am the sum of all your parts,
and proprietor of all.
A miasma,
the conclusion,
blackmonger of InlÃ©,
valediction.

Synapses fray,
my form now vivid,
as torpor sets and blood grows tepid.
With every ounce of flesh now offered,
I hold your corpse within my coffers.
Knitted cells now split asunder,
stand alongside me brother.
Take your place amongst my Owsla,
we march at dawn now and forever.
Cross your palms and acquiesce,
take a bow as they ascend.
Scent these grounds with your presence,
ring the change of days now done.
