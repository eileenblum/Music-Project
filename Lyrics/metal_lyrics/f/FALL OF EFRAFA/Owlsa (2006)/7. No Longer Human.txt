Beneath this skin;
I am not human
I shed this flesh
In the name of shame
I shed this species
In the name of respect
For every life
We have taken from this earth
We are all butchers; plague bearers
The separation of man and beast

Butchers
We are worth nothing
We are owed nothing
We have learnt nothing
The dawn of man bore
witness to this end
silent faces turn callously away
In these eyes; sentience is rife
A cry; a smile - emotion we deny

Liars
We are worth nothing
We are owed nothing
We have learnt nothing
Born unto the hands of man
Divide in death their skin and bone
Throats slit bodies fall numb
This atrocity must come undone

A vegan species forced flesh into its maw
Suffocated on the blood of the dead and wanted more
Eyes outgrew stomachs, bloated with greed
Carnivore only in name, without the need
human kind is a hypocrisy,
compassion quashed with unhealthy need
tell yourself you can stomach their death
your words cast out on their dying breath
and all I can say is that I am sorry for what we have done
