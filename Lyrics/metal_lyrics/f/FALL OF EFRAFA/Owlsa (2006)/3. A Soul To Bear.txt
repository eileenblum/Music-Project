Man built god;
dragged himself upon a pedestal
kicked dirt in the faces of all other life
Crowned himself as deity

What animal separates this ape from that?
The human animal; ignored and loathed by louse and lion

Revel in our glory, in every brother is quarry
Butcher every life, until our land is stained and dead

From our towers we cry "every man shall bear a soul,
a right that no other beast shall bear"

and in the shadows the dogs shook their heads
"shame upon those apes, pride comes before a fall"

[explanation:]

It is obvious to me now that religion was the wedge that drove the human animal away from the rest of the natural world. humanity has a superiority complex, and we can blame religion for this. Religion dictates that animals do not have souls, and therefor only serve two purposes to us - slaves and food. As an atheist, the idea of a soul is a naive explanation for our consciousness, All life is conscious. No life on this planet, or anywhere in the universe for that matter,  holds more significance than any other. The universe is a complex yet totally random event - and the outcome of evolution and chance on this planet was man - a subspecies of ape, who took the reigns for the last 45,000 years. And what have we done with that time? raped this world, enslaved each other, butchered countless lives in the name of civilization? intelligent animals that wield our dominance like monsters. We must all  begin to understand that all life is equal, and to kill and eat other life when we no longer need to, (where we understand that we can draw all the nutrients we need from plants) - is cruel and unnecessary, and that man made gods do not offer pardons.
