Fell down upon the realm of man

On a scorned mound
We erect another monolith
Buckled under its own ego
Another pillar of content
Another milestone of man

Pity the weak
We cry out in laughter
As trees are felled
How the mighty have fallen
We mock the roots

Parasitic ape;
Spills his black blood
Blotting out the sun
Wither to sallow flesh

Saplings writhe where man is idle
An imperfect genocide

Erected upon weakened ground
Finally gave way

Toppled down. Toppled down

[Explanation:]

we are a flash in the pan in relation to the longevity of life on this planet. when we murder countless lives and tear down countless trees, we feel we control everything. In our arrogance, we are simply pulling our end closer. When the last homo sapien dies, the world will not die with us. We are not a chosen race by some make believe god. We are the first, and hopefully last species to have evolved to the point where we deserve extinction. We are also a species that has the power to change this outcome.
