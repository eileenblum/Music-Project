Give us this day! 
Our daily dead! 
Curse the sun for this sight 

Lay strewn upon the ground, can we not offer humility? 
Breath hungry, life lost, faith starved, 
Can we not offer humility? 

Digger dig deep, feel for sights and sounds 
Press your ear against the earth, upon the ground 

Runner, ride out, against the turning tide 
The sun beats down upon the land set aside 

Foreboding fates will not cease 
Laying my death before me 
Arrows split against my hide 
I am everyone, everyone in these eyes 
I will witness the fall of efrafa 
I will witness, witness the fall 

Give us this day! 
Our daily dead! 
Can we not offer humility?
