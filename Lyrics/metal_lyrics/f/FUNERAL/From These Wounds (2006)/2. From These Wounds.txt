In our cruel history's aftergloom
Mankind's treason brought it's children doom
The thin texture between wrong and right
Mostly broken by those who saw the light
Up to this day the lie remains
To rid the world from it's finer strains
Through pills and acid that alter our brains
A utopia they seek to gain
The fundamental laws of our universe
As they are taught us by our greatest curse
And they are so right those who administer the truth
When their truth is controlled with poison to the youth
Up to this day the lie remains
To rid the world from it's finer strains
Through pills and acid that destroy our brains
A utopia they seek to gain
To save our world from the ones thought insane
Truly the work of the self-proclaimed sane
Evolution has come far enough
Our psychopathic future is set, just learn to be tough
What is the value of intellect and brains
If it is only used to hold your rivals in chains
The human race imprisoned to it's end
The tyrant of religion and science will never bend

[Lyrics by F. Forsmo]
