[bonus track]
[Words: F. Forsmo]

A dying world in a dying universe
A starving poet singing on the last verse

I was a fool to fall for your charm
I was deluded into loving a scam
Lured into misery by laughter and smiles
Another tragedy brought forth by her lies

I should have known that I was standing in your way
I was only an obstacle to be controlled
Now I live in shards on minimal social pay
Another life sacrificed for her goals

The cold air of the winter night is freezing my skin
Without her treason where would I have been?

When you were in need I took you into my arms
Giving you shelter, food and warmth
Now that I stand on the shores that you once stood
I see your house of wealth painted in blood

I should have known that I was standing in your way
I was only an obstacle to be controlled
Now I live in shards on minimal social pay
Another life sacrificed for her goals
In altruistic foolishness I helped you on your way
The purest form of stupidity is love
The greatest ugliness is the beauty that leads you astray
Now I only live to soon die alone
