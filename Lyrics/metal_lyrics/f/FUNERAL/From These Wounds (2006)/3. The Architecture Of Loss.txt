A few days have passed since I heard the word
There is not much time left for me in this world
I try to be strong so I put on this mask
Yet the burden of death is a heavy task
About to lose my everything
Cancellation of my future dreams
So I have written my testament
My desire to live it screams
I received my death sentence
From a friendly man in white
The being that is my essence
Soon to fade into the night
When you go out of town do you ever think of me
The poison you put in your veins might make you share my fate
I am so scared that I am shaking all day long
Answer to the great mystery, most likely I'll be gone
The doctors are kind but unable to help
As the panic grows I reflect on the self
Will I remain beyond or will I be reborn
For what is not longer should never be mourned
As darkness and light collide I finally understand
Atheism and faith unite as nature lets go of my mind
As I let go to never ever again be here
Passing into the heavenly void, never again to be scared

[Lyrics by F. Forsmo]
