Here I lie
Awaiting to die
No cigarettes
No drinks after eight
Here I lie
Medication cut down
To preserve my breath
To postpone my death
Understand
This is the waiting room of Hell
How did I
Become so old
Why didn't I
Prepare my soul
The forces of nature
Also forced me to mature
This thing called welfare
Is a joke in this nightmare
The lights are shut
The doors are locked
I am tied to my bed
Only waiting to be dead
The youngsters are rude
Contemptful to see me nude
What they see if of course
What will soon be a corpse
As my foggy mind reaches out to it's ancestors
It is given no reply but it's childhood fear of trolls
And I wait, I wait, I wait to reach the gate
As my role is fulfilled I gladly embrace the end of my fate
Daddy won't you please take me home
