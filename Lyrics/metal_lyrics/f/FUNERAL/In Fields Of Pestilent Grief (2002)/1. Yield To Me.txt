I kneel to you
I bow to you faithfully
I bid you long farewell
but spit out my name, you will
come yield to me
I yield to you

You lay as though dead
I did dance for the devil
but judge me not for
into the midst of the fire I suffer now

Scorching pain burning me
for my repentance, my deceive
an orgy full of spite
gliding all through your heart
whatever the sin is
I love you yet
