Time to depart and breaking the seal
Pour red wine and the softest of lips
Oh, wish me well and I go

Tower your strength, an ascendance to hell
Cut me deep with your ignorance
and leave me be

I scorn my pityful self
do not cherish my mistakes

Your fury rules
at hand within when light will dawn
and sun will fade
Darker than the darkest night
what burning lust you radiate

Carry me, into the fields
In roses lay,
Souls are now eternal sealed

From my cup, you quenched your thirst,
I'm bathing in misery, you gave your first
