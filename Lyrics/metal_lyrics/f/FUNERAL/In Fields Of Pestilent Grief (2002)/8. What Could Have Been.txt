Bringer of rain,
mother of heaven's tears
'least you hide my own, least you hide
I swear you touched my heart
A thousand aeons worth
of hopelessness...
Leaves me freezing
Where you once burnt, where you once burnt

More like two lost children
seeking shelter in each others
Nothing unpure,
to regret,
'tis all we share now
Averting eyes and stone silence
chases not the winter night,
but summons storms

Why all the distance now?
We were close,
and our souls touched
If only for this very moment
warmth was in our hands
