See the sun you left
dawning into the black sea into me
In my heart, this painful sea
a sea of spite, all that is inside
-set me free!

For evermore, bathing in your might
Flowing down my own streams of pityness

Can anyone save me from myself
Somebody hear me, somebody heal me

If you feel in your heart
You will know that my pride is all I have
If you look in this heart
you will know all that's left is but disgrace

I must be all forgiven
For I know not my sins

Do not wear this weary veil around you
to drag yourself down
For you are my own self, nothing else
but the true tempter
