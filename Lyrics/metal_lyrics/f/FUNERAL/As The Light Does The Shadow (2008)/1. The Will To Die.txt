All the ways to crush a soul
Dressed naked, raped by heartless ghouls
Slowly I left the livings sphere
Into a world based on fear

The will to die
The desire to be
The desire to fly
The will to be free

Once more did I wave good-bye
They all knew that I was gonna die
A life lived based on futile hopes
Death would untie my ropes

Trapped in this net of lies
Missing the light in those eyes
On the day that I lost my soul
Did I finally reach my goal

My demons, they were mocking my soul
In hell you will know it was your own fault
Before hell's throne I did find my way
To the ghouls my soul was easy pray
