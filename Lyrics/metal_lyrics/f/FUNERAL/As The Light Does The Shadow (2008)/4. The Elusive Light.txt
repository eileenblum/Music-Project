We have gathered to honour thoseWho so early passed out of timeFlock together to preserve some warmthLast children of mankind So many have died for a causeA cause without reasonSo few dared to take a standAgainst the prevailing treason What science gaveScience did take backAll religions enslaveWe walk in our own tracks We are killing the sunTo prove that there is none We have gathered for a last farewellTo the essence of life itselfSing together on this final verseLast children of the universe They all suffered pain so that our time would gainThe knowledge and wisdom to avoid itBut we had to know for ourselves how it goesImpatiently causing our own ending The said don't touch, but we had to learnHow it feels like to burnIt was shining so bright, the ultimate lightIt blinded us all into darkness
