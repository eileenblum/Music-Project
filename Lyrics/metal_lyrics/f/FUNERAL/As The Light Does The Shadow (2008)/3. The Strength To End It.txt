Please excuse me if I do repulse thee
I have still not found the strength to end it
So I silently withdraw from your society
To await for life to release its grip on me

So many souls condemned to live isolated and alone
Human warmth is swiftly dying in your perfect world

Marvel at the beauty of your empire
Our suicides will not convince you otherwise
The architects behind your luxury
Shall be the first to fall with your decline

Still you force this to survive
Though all it wishes is to die
It can never exist among you
Truth can never become untrue

So excuse me if I do repulse thee
I have finally found a way to end it
I will silently withdraw from your society
To await for lie to release its grip on me

So many souls rejected for the essence of their thoughts
Pearls cast before swines ensures that Hades keeps her warmth
