I surrender my heart to thee
I bow my soul in misery
Take my hand where I stand alone
Guide me safe on my way back home

Take my heart and eat it warm
Filled with wisdom to mankind forlorn

I bow before your earth-born son
Guiding me with claws and horns
And I praise the messenger
Your time on earth has now come

The fallen one has given birth
Praise the morning son
He now walks the earth
Release my soul and let me be
Your hand on earth in victory

Fallen one
