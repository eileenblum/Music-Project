A leper seated on the corner of a street in the new world
Crying sorely, as he was destined for so much more
Nobody helps him, they are busy reaching for the sun
No more love or care, the leper is the last one

He was the strongest, he was determined to help the weak
He caught what he fought, the hatred of a world gone sick
Condemned for an imperfect world, the path to hell in sight
The bringer of light was blamed for the darkness of the night

To count towards infinity within borders of finitude
A lesser perfection, to obey is to break the rules
Through quantum steps the path to hell is eternally trod

It is time to break the seal of empathy
What was true has become a lie
Gravity will set you free
Unleash upon the world your true misery

Invite them to your labyrinth
Make them pay for their sins
Dare them step through the door
Into the lair of the minotaur

The cornerstone of their playground will soon be gone
Their punishment is to become what they have done
