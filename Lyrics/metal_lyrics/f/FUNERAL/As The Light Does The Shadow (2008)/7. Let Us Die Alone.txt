Holocaust, freedom lostThe price we pay, for living our wayObey the norm, conform or be gone Please just let us die aloneWe are soon going homeWe are not fit to live among youPrejudice makes itself trueA self fulfilling prophecyWhen your point of view became ideologyWe are no longer of utilityIn our new order for societyOnly those who comply shall passInto your new utopias black mass Please supply us with the means to dieWe are unworthy to exist by your sideSince we became to ill for slaveryOnly a burden to society The morning bell, another day in hellA master-plan, to those who understandSo many in pain, still their hands remain clean We are sorry for opposing youBut our last virtue is the truthYou are the servants of the ruling classSafe when bowing to their liesInfected with sympathyWe pose a threat to your realityWe are no longer welcome in your livesSo please provide us with the means to dieWe are the symptoms of dystopiaOur extinction shall bring forth your paradise
