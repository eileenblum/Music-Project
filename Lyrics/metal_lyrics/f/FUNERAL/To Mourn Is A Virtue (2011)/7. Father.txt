Behind an old piano,
Desperately out of tune.
When she played it alone
At christmas
I felt warm and safe
Then...
Even if it sounded morbid
And she would cry

In a room that lay in ruins,
a monument of failure,
reminder of pains,
of tasks embarked upon.
... but lonelt is a man
whose greatest enemy
is himself.

There I cried,
curled up beyond
life and it's tortures.
Felt thir hut.
Things they had repressed.

"FATHER" [4x]

My beloved brother.
I wish I could take your tears,
And save your heart from drowning.
Still every now and then.

I wanted to embrace you
Comfort you,
Protect you
And keep you warm.

It was so cold
you were so cold,
and wounerable.

It would not be right.
You are my father.
And besides they are all there

... watching.

Oh if you would lift your hands
only once more
open your eyes...
yell or kick!
I dare you.
Please...

In a room that lay in ruins,
a monument of failure,
reminder of pains,
of tasks embarked upon.
... but lonelt is a man
whose greatest enemy
is himself.
