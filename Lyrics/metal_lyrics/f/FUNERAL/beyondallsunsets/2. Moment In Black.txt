She lays there dressed in silk.
So pale, so cold.

Your door has opened for all to see.
The pitiness that we suffer.
Guided (to) where no man returns
... or ever will, (it is) eternity.

A spokesman of God
Gives the beauty away.

You door has been opened for all to see.
The pitiness that we suffer.
Guided (to) where no man returns,
... or ever will, (it is) eternity.

A brief moment in black,
Is that all...?
