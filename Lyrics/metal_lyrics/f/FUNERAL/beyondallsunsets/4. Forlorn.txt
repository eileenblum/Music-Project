Tears in my eyes
Tortured and twisted
The emotions of mine

Pain and decay
All of the kind
Surrounds mankind
Until they die

The soul will be
Into new flesh (borned)
Never have I
Questioned eternal life

If I can't have this
I want nothing
No God can hold me
They will all abandon me

I will be
Released from all
Darkness and pain.
