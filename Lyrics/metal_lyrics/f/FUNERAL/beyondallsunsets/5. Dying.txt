Peek through wall of sadness
Behold what you adore.
Cities of happiness
Decompose to black rot.

With tones of Ariels voice
I mourn the bitter end

Tro ei pÃ¥ hjertets lyst
FÃ¸lg meg til evig sorg

Vik du ornament svart
Depress turns to agress
Sjels fred tungt adventes
Doom at which I curse you

Please save me from myself
Life holds no joy but you
In a doomed and adoring way
We are dying together as one.
