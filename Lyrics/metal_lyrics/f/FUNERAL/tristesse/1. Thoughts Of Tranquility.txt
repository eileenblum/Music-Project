This terrible writhe
I rot away
Oh, hear my prayer
My soul is trying to slip away

I...I die
Pray for my soul
All hope is gone

Agony, please set me free
Remove this pain from me
Let me be
Oh, my god

Eternity now awaits
Going towards him
I am embracing god
My soul is free, I have peace

Once... once again I sense the gaiety
The gaiety of flowers on green meadows
