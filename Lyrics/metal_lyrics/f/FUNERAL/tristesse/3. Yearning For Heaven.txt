First came the wings, then came peace
An angel sweetly embracing me
As the clouds continued to thicken
As far as eyes could see

Farewell, I loved you ever
Forever
Now flights of angels sung me to rest

As the trees shed their leaves
Salvation's final, arrival
(was) bringing delight upon me
I ascended to thee
Finally, I find myself entwined
In bitterness and sweet bliss

Raining tears
Lay me in the earth
And from my flesh may voilets spring
Silently within myself I weep in sorrow
For the beloved whom I have, lost
So many times, way too many
My soul darkens
I can not love anymore
In fear of losing you
Forever
