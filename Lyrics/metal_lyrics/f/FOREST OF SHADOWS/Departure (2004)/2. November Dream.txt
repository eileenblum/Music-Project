amidst a forest of shadows
swept in thorns and songs of farewell
i felt an echo of a glorious time
gently whispering my name
as if knowing of my demise
as if guiding me away
from the torments of my loss
towards that which i seek
one final glimpse of her smile

and so i followed and arrived
at the shore of a silent lake
where i beheld a starlit silhouette
of somehow familiar features
it was her, my love and life
staring into the night
and awaiting my advent

i called out her name
and she unfolded her funeral face
with eyes of radiant sorrow
that pierced my blissful stare

a moment of joy turned to dust
as she spoke her final sigh
and left me shattered and alone
amidst a forest of shadows
swept in thorns and songs of farewell
