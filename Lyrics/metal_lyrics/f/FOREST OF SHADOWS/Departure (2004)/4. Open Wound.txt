i saw the flowers die
grand beauty turn to dust
under wings of cold white death
winter came into my sleep
i had left myself once again
covered with grey despair
my fallen memories lay bleak and bare
untold misery had awaken

come, enlight my dream
with your forever smile
linger here awhile
and be with me in my sleep
come, return the sun
for it is growing dark
and i am bleeding dry
from this open wound

i wear the face of a dying wish
seeking beyond the gate of my delusion
where she is dancing with the dead
clad in a shroud of eternal peace

come, enlight my dream
let your moon arise
save me from the fruit
fed with sorrows dew
come, return from dust
be with me for one last time
save me from myself
or i will be dead by dawn

i saw the flowers die
and nothing felt the same
under wings of cold white death
weary hours brought the end
