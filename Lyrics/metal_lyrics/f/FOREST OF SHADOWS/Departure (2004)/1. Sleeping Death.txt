bleak silver streams
the light of many a star
born from thrones in dark heaven
and swept in the suns demise
bleak silver streams
the radiance of eternity
paint the meadows in dismal shades
as sleeping death seep thru the clouds

i stand motionless and
marvel with empty eyes
like a portrait of bliss forsaken
wearing the colors of loss
i stand motionless
like a grieving graveyard statue
and i drape my face with my bare hands
as sleeping death seeps thru the clouds

i felt a dying embrace
a soft breeze of weary winds
singing silent lamentations
a prologue to a tragedy untold
clad in the cold breath of october
the stars fall from their thrones
and my last gleam of hope fade away

in this crestfall orchard
where the final chapter lies written
dressed in a robe of shattered dreams
as the flower withers
in this crestfallen orchard
where fallen leaves lies dying
i kneel down in solitude
as sleeping death seeps thru the clouds

i stare into the forever night
and i travel beyond the fallen stars
i sink into oblivions twilight dream
where my sleeping beauty
lies sleeping with the dead
