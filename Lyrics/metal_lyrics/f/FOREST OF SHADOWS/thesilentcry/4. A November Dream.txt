Obscured by night
A forest of Shadows
The silence of birds bringing peace
The whispering night it calls my name
And so I follow the path of unknown
In solitude I wonder about
Flakes of snow falling from the sky
By the frozen lake she awaits my arrival
That weeping angel of endless sorrow
Under the starlit sky
My eyes embraced by her beauty
Aware of my presence 
She arise from her slumber
I meet her crystal eyes
A sad smile I behold
As she melts into the everlasting night
