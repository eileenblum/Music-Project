In the fields of green
Her silhouette towards the sky
Under the dying sun
I see her die

In the fields of green
An arrow of death
A dying beauty breathing
Her last breath

In the fields of green
Under the dying sun
I cry out
In grief for my beloved one

A symbol of life and hope she was to me
Now pain and suffering is all I can see
An act of vengeance for the deeds I've done
Why must she pay with a life now gone

I lay down beside her and gaze into the sky
Eyes filled with tears why must she die

In the fields of green
Under the dying sun
I cry out
In grief for my beloved one
