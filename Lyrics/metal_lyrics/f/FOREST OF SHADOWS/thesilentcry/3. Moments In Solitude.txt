Embraced by darkness my abandoned soul
Screams within my mind I see
But darkness drowning in my misery
Take me away to lands beyond this bleeding earth
Thoose moments in solitude where my mind flies away
Into the realm among the clouds where I rule my own life
A kingdom for myself
A place without fear and with no need for your gods
Where I find eternal piece within my soul
The realm among the clouds 
Where I wander in my moments of solitude
But still I am falling through endless skies
Skies of darkness obscured by reality
That shrouds my life with hatred and lies
