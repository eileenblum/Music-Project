Awakened this dying season
Such a beauty to behold
Oh autumn hath arrived
A tragedy painted dead
Fallen am I
Without thee I am lost
In a region of doleful shades
I am withering away

I dwell in the shadows of life
A dismal stage of mind
I'm in pain
Oh sun I hate thy beams
Leave me here to sleep and dream
In the midst of falling leaves
In a garden of endless grief
I yearn for thee my precious one
Beneath the pale grey sky I dream of your embrace
How I wish I had you near
In this oh so dolorous life where dreams turn to dusts
I have lost all my hope
Of lasting pain and unpresent bliss this soul of mine
How I welcome thee eternal sleep

Silent advents of white death
I feel so cold

Silent advents of white death
I feel so cold
Crystallized tears falling still
Oh autumn hath died
Enshrouded am I in thy mist of endless gloom
Enthralled am I by thy beauty
How I wish
How I wish...

In the midst of falling snow
In a garden of endless grief
My forlorn soul of misery
Where peace and rest can never dwell, hope never comes
I see no point in going on
Still I dream but now I know I dream of a lie
So I close my eyes and I sigh
A life of shattered dreams I can no longer bear
I enter thee eternal sleep...
