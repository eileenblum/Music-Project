So silent it seemed this tragic vision painted before my eyes
Amidst falling leaves I had found my beloved bloodstained and pale
Falling into the forever so silent
Aware of my presence she turned towards me her agonizing stare
One last breath and she whispered
Everything dies before my tearfilled eyes
Dead and silent, a golden leaf of autumn
Falling before my tearfilled eyes
This withering beauty
This eternal autumn
So silent
So silent
