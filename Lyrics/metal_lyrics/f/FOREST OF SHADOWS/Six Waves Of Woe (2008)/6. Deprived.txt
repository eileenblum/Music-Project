[Lyrics written by Niclas Frohagen 2005]

Once there was a smile
Filled with radiant bliss
Breathing summers pride
In the midst of a beautiful life
Oh, how it danced upon her face
Painting nothing but perfection
Her eyes stared into tomorrow
As fragile wings spread wide open

Through gardens of deceit
Where delusive pleasures grow
She followed a sweet perfume
Into the depths of a twilight dream
There in sunny beams he did appear
With poisoned flowers for his prey
Like a divinity for blind worship
He smiled and reached out his hand

With visions of grand beauty
And words of promised lands
Her mind was slowly intoxicated
By a yearning for that glorious light
Sleepwalking she entered the delusion
Sleepwalking she entered his golden cage
And wings of liberty fell dead
As she awoke from her slumber

Once there was a smile
But now it's dead and gone
Buried beneath a lifeless mask
That hides the wreckage that is her
Another angel fallen from grace
Deprived of all that once was
Unable to see her own tomorrow
And destined to fade away
