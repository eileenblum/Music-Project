[Lyrics written by Niclas Frohagen 2006]

And so, another day unfolds
Another day dressed in black
Ready to pull me further down
Down the spiral of my decay
I'm lost in a growing hell
A darkness I can't bear
My hours are gone
My days are dead

Oh, please turn on the light
And give me comfort for a while
One last moment of peace
A chance to breathe
Grant me some golden beams
And let them dance upon my face
Silence my bitter words
And let me smile

And so, the colors fade away
No longer are they mine
Only black and blue to paint
The world that burnt my eyes
And nailed me to my cross
I'm at their mercy now
Helpless and exhausted
To be devoured

Oh, please turn on the light
And tell me this is not the end
I'm not ready yet
For departure
I know it's just in vain
To think that things can be undone
But all I'm asking for
Is an escape

Oh, please turn on the light
And tell me it was just a dream
Let me awake somewhere else
Somewhere far away
Once I reached out my hands
And they opened up my veins
Once I reached out my hands
To the pernicious
