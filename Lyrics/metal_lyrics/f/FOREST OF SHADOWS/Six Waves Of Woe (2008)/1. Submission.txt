[Lyrics written by Niclas Frohagen 2007]

There, in the radiance of deceit
A broken body and a shattered mind
Screaming without making a sound
So weak and weary from its defeat
Forever detached from a world of dreams
Left staring into bottomless perdition
Deep down where lasting torments await
Draped in unquestionable delusion

There, in the radiance of deceit
Facing final submission
