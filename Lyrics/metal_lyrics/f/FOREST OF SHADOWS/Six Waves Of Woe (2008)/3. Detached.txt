[Lyrics written by Niclas Frohagen 2007]

I felt the world turn away
Without saying why
To leave me trembling among
The thorns of the waste
To be swallowed by myself
and the darkness that is me
All I asked for was a dream to live
Or a final farewell

Please tell me why I can't be there
And have to seek shelter in isolation
Please tell me why I choose to escape
And leave the world that could be mine

I don't know when
I don't know how
But somehow I lost it
The will to see beyond
I am stuck with the shadows
Of my own destruction
And I sink with the wreckage
Of my broken dream

Save me...
Save me...

Please tell me why I can't be there
To welcome another beautiful day
To taste the sweet honey of life
And smile upon all that was granted to me
Please tell me why I choose isolation
And detach myself from the ones I love
It seems like I really lost it
And now the world lost me
