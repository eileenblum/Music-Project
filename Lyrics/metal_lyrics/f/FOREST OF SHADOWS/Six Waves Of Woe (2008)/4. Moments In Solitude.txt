Embraced by shadows
Feels like I'm dead to this world
This withering grey existence
A paradise for a sleepwalking kind

Suppressed screams echo inside
They carve at my fragile state
I'm plagued by my own pathetic misery
A creation of a diverted mind

These moments in solitude
Makes me wanting to escape
Far, far away from here
To where I rule my own life
A kingdom for myself
A place without fear
And with no need of your gods
That's where I find eternal peace
Somewhere among nowhere
That's where I linger
In my moments in solitude
Seeking comfort beyond my grasp
But it's all an empty vision
And I'm still here

Falling through skies of darkness
That shrouds my life with hatred and lies

I never wanted to feel sorry for myself
But I can't seem to find another way out
