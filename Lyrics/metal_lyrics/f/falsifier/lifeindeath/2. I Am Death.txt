I am death
My eyes are dead
My soul is rotten
Take me away
I must be forgotten

I'd rather be dead than shift into
The void you call existence
I can't seem to shake this off
My mind's a fucking prison

I am death

I am the reaper
I've been stealing souls
Death waits for you
It's out of your control

My eyes are dead
My soul is rotten
Take me away
I must be forgotten

Your dead mind
Will be your demise

Vulture you speak
Words of poison
I am the reaper
It has been chosen

You speak of death
But you've seen
Nothing yet
I am the reaper
I will make you
Pray for death

Fuck

You speak of death
But you've seen nothing yet
I am the reaper
I will make you pray for death
