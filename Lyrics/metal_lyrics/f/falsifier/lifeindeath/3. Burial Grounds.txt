my mind is a burial ground
a place where memories go to drown
thoughts suffocate underneath the soil
until the end of time six feet below
home sweet hell, in my mind
home sweet hell, where everything dies
my heart is as cold as the grave
bring me to the end of days
close my coffin door
I don't want to feel anymore
I want my final breath
so take the life from my eyes
and the let ground swallow me whole
watch me bleed as I wither away
this is a burial ground
I want the line of insanity now
watch me burn, watch me rot
blood and earth
life in death
