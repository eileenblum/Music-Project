Place two coins upon your eyes
Lay you to rest
In a bed made of pine
I reject all faith in humanity
I have no remorse and no sympathy
Hell bent on self destruction
Your life has become nothing
This hate inside my heart
Burns through the fear that flows in my veins
I hope you've made your peace
You've dug your grave, now rot in it
I've lost my mind
Close your eyes
Lay you to rest
In a bed made of pine
You play the victim every time
Sooner or later your life will be mine
I will consume you
Death will flow through you
