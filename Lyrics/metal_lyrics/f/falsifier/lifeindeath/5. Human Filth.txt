Set me free.
Tear my heart from my chest .
All hope is lost, we're all fucked at best.
Bludgeoned to death by the promise of salvation.

We're all worthless human filth.

We're all lying to ourselves.

We've been misled into thinking, that things could be anything less than fraudulent.
I've lost all faith in a world that turned it's back on me.
Why did I think that things could be different?
We live behind the veil of contentment.

My heart no longer beats for this world.
Set me free.

Death is our only source of salvation.

[Quote Richard Ramirez AKA "The Night Stalker":]
"PEOPLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE ARE BRAINWASHED AND PROGRAMMED LIKE A COMPUTER AT BEING NOTHING MORE THAN PUPPETS. THIS NATION, THIS COUNTRY IS FOUNDED IN VIOLENCE. VIOLENT DELIGHTS TEND TO HAVE VIOLENT ENDS. MADNESS IS SOMETHING RARE IN INDIVIDUALS BUT IN GROUPS, IT IS THE
RULE. KILLING IS KILLING, WHETHER DONE FOR DUTY, PROFIT OR FUN. MEN MURDER THEMSELVES IN THIS ENVIRONMENT."
"Do you admit to being evil, Richard?"
"WE ARE ALL EVIL IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER, ARE WE NOT?"
"I'm asking you."
"Ha ha, YES I AM EVIL."

The human race is a plague on the earth.
No one can be saved we're all doomed from birth.
The human race is a plague on the earth.
No one can be saved we're all doomed from birth.
