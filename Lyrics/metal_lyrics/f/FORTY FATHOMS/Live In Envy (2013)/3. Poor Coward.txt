23 with nothing worthy to say
I spit it out in the worst of ways
23 with nothing worthy to say
I spit it out
I spit it out
I'm the worst fucking thing

You see I'm just sick of getting older
As time goes on my insides grow colder
There's no cure in sight
So try as you might
I don't see myself coming out of this one

[2x]
Don't sing along
You don't want to feel how I fell

Not a single one of you
Should put this in your head
'Cause it'll make you feel
Better off dead
You're better off dead
Can't you feel the hands of father time
Reaching for your neck
Reaching for your neck

All my life is now is just a pool of regret
Who am I?

Am I myself when you're around me?
When you speak I just turn away
It's so much further than I can see
And now I live in envy

23 with nothing worthy to say, to say
I spit it out in the worst of ways
I'm the worst fucking thing

Like clockwork the tortured days
The hours, the minutes, they all stay the same
Try to move forward but my mind is a mess
I'm a coward.
How much will I pay to remove this mask from my goddamn face?

It's hard to find the motivation when there's no inspiration
There's no fucking inspiration
Give me a reason
Give me a sign
Give me a reason, a reason why

[2x]
Am I myself when you're around me?
When you speak I just turn away
It's so much further than I can see
And now I live in envy

(live in envy)

The only thing lying underneath is a man who's afraid to live
Is a man who's afraid to live?

[2x]
I've been sinking but I thought
We had already sunk

I just can't go any deeper, any deeper
I can't go sinking
I am a sunken ship
Take, take what you want from me
