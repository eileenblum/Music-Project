They all want a piece of my heart

I didn't ask for this
No way, no how
I'm sick, I'm sick and I can't deal with it
Did I pull my chest open for you to grab?
Or did you rip it out my back for all your friends to have?

Can you tell me how it got so out of hand?
It feels like I'm going off the deep end again
Can you tell me how it got so out of hand?
It feels like I'm going off the deep end again

I've fell and I've felt
But god damn I feel like hell

I'll pay my debts and I won't come back to see you
Yeah, then I'll live in regret
So I gave everything up for what?
Because from what I can see
Are the people that call me a friend
Well they mean nothing to me

They all want a piece of my heart
Fuck

Should I keep lying to myself?
I keep on doing it to everybody else
Its a new kind of misery
My life went down as theirs rose up
I fill this emptiness with booze and sluts.

My life went down as theirs rose up
I fill this emptiness with booze and sluts.

I've fell and I've felt
But god damn I feel like hell

I'll pay my debts and I won't come back to see you
Yeah, then I'll live in regret
So I gave everything up for what?
Because from what I can see
Are the people that call me a friend
Well they mean nothing to me

I used to know what colors I bled
But all I know now is how to play dead
Play dead
But all I know now is how to play dead

I've fell and I've felt
But god damn I feel like hell
