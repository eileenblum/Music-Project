[feat. Justin Miller and David Jones]let's set this place on fire

did I choose this life or did it choose me?
but after sleepless nights
I can't come up with much of
anything worth speaking of again
even though you try and pretend
I know whats going on inside your head

I just need for this to come out right
I feel so irresponsible, selfish and unpredictable
I'll let you fire the blanks while I bite the bullet

we've been here before
it seems like everyday's the same old story
another song , another morning
amongst low light I hear no warning
just one more line to go
the past few weeks have left us bitter and cold

our hearts are forever black

I can see a break in the light at the end
there's no turning your back on tonight
and no ones going to love this more than us no one
all these little thing's I got I fought and fought
i fought and fought so hard to get what I want
I'll belt about it I'll bleed it all out

i was gonna stop, I was going to give up
but the bigger picture says there's still more left
hoarse throat from the nights of pouring out my should
and the hours adding up to an unreadable goal
I can't sleep all i can do is think but it pains me so much
to hear my worn voice speak
