ruh
im awake but i will never become weak
break free from acoma(beef beef barbacoa)
laid in silence for how many weeks?
a moment to decide how they had known
im back and im coming for you
im not an advocate of violence
but this time its necessary 

you should be ashamed, now you know whos to blame
my name is revenge, dont wait for me ill be waiting for you
(ill be here waiting for you)
my name is revenge, dont wait for me ill be waiting for you
(this time well make sure you are through)

stay at home, the docks arent safe tonight
thats right were taking it back

when i fight( i fight alone)
and your "family" is fucking gone
this will be permanent so dont expect another breath
youve planted yourself into something i love
now i have pulled you out, burned you down

[chorus]

and one by one two by two ill be the death of you
