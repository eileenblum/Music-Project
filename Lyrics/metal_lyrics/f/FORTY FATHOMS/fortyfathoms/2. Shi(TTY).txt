I can see right through you, quit being so fucking loud
in a place where this bond shall not be broken 
youve left him all alone (abandoned) 
he wont live with out you
he couldnt keep himself entertained
so ive decided i could care less

if i end up under ground, its no problem to me ill get up claim my victory
im taking over this town i didnt come here for this but ill do what needs to be done
what have i become?
my gun makes a beautiful sound when she collapses your lungs

keep on telling yourself that three to one are odds youd bet on

so tell me what did you expect?
im hoping not a bullet in your neck
keep on telling yourself that three to one are odds youd bet on
you wont wake up

ill dirty up the ground with your insides
ill make a mess of what youve become

[pre chorus]
[chorus]

its time to find out 
if the image you reflect 
can stand on this battleground
