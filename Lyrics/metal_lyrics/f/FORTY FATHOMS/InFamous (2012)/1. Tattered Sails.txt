We killed the captain, we sunk the ship(we sunk the ship)
threw your men overboard looked south and proclaimed this is it
so we push forward on and on to keep our hands upon the throne

there was an empty nest in sight, the timing couldnt have been more right
with a flick of my wrist things fell in place, rose from the mist to end this chase
so silently we crept youll be the only one who's left
be prepared for a ship wreck
be prepared for a ship wreck
so beware because were not turning back

[chorus]

with such ease in such a little time, we showed the world we are ready 
to cross the line
any last words before this dark ocean devours your soul?

no last words will be said and you wont be saved
so say goodnight and say hello to your salty grave

[chorus]
