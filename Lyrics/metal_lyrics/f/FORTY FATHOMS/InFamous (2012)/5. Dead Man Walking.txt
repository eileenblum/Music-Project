YEAH! eerrah! 

Were holding on to the untouchable or so it seems(or so it seems)
when we lay our heads down to dream this what we, this is what we see

dont look now were not the same
you let our trust slip away
we wont forget yesterday
youre the one youre the one to blame
are we nothing more 
than a scene to your dance floor
we will prevail and proclaim 
you are the one to blame

LOOK AT ME NOW!

well im a bitter man but i can still tell you whos in the wrong
so what the fuck is your problem
i cant wait to turn my back on everyone 
because theres no more room at the top

[chorus]

you may be smiling now 
well ive got a feeling this is it
the next time you come around 
you better take what you can get (take what you can get)

so go ahead 
take your prisioners [x2]

[chorus]

betrayal is our new best friend
you did it once and youll do it again
betrayal is our new best friend
i see you falling, youre a dead man walking

youre a dead man walking [x4]
betrayal is our new best friend
dead man walking [x2]
