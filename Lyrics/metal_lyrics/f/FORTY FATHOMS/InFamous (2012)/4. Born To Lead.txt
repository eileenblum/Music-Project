My disgust in humanity grows stronger everyday
i have to reason to believe there are debts you need to repay
stronger everyday give you strength, give you reason to betray

we must be held to a higher standard 
only we can save them all
there is a key, there is a key 
only few can hold

how is it not obvious, were the hand to take
the hand to trust

looks like your surrounded(and dont be looking that still)
you should have know by now (when its time to kill)
wed end up here some how

it began to consume me, this is sickening
only moments before i witness your failure
we called upon strength from below
the time is now, empty your soul

this word will wake you from your dreams
and leave you in our nightmare
so let this story play on
this is a violation of all means

My disgust in humanity grows stronger everyday
i have to reason to believe there are debts you need to repay
stronger everyday, we go stronger everyday

[chorus]

i wont stay humble this time, this is your life on the line
so begin to understand and embrace the failure of this crime

born to lead
