stand aside and let the big boys 
do what we came here for
til they are screaming more, more
we tried and tried, so keep your fists up high

we didnt ask for your opinion and i sure as hell dont appreciate
the way you stand, just to intimidate
i wish it was in our hands
just to decimate

we all know that this is war
so we will sail away, while the weather turns
we hope for a better day

ill sing a song about how the world is yours
but not here not anywhere, so get the fuck out

youve heard it all before this town is a fucking grave yard

[chorus]

my friend this isnt how it was supposed to be

can you survive, without violence? 
so watch the hunters become the hunted
we never wanted this but this battle cant be won

we all know....
