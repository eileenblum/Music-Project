Silence in the mist that surrounds this place
I've been torn away from this empty life
Blood upon the walls to mark my name for death
Bury me not in hallowed grounds and in solitude let me die

Remember not my name
Let never a flower adorn my grave

My grave to be
Lies over the hill
Far from the cemetery
Forgotten by all
Buried dense
In thistle and brush
None shall come to weep

Remember not my name
Let never a flower adorn my grave
