I have leeched the souls of kings
And rendered down withered gods
And captured universal light
I steal your lifeforce to channel my magic

I conjure all that I have stolen
Into one violent charge
One apocalyptic burst
Sent as a plague to the cursed earth

The great eye of the cosmos
Has focused upon me
A grandiose fate
For one as I, no longer mortal
I have sapped the powers of God
Leaving naught but a hollow drone
Placed have I a fire therein
To burn away any trace of power
