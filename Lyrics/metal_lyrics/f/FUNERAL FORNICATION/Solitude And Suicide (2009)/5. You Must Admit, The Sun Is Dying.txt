The sun rises so slowly these days
The nights are growing longer
Such wicked signs are out of season
The light is so very weak

Darker days ahead

Although it's not like you to say
You must admit, the sun is dying

No more romantic dawns
No more dreamy dusks
Only years of darkness
Humanity's bleakest age

A planet plunged into absolute zero
A global freezing beyond all imagination
Everyone will die in darkness
Everyone will freeze to death

Although it's not like you to say
You must admit, the sun is dying
