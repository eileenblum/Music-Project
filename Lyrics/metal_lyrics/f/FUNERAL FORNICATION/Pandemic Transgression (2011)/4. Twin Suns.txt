O`Night Mother
Who prowls the skies
Nebular and tentacled
Spreads wide her gape
To birth twin suns
And deformed, the other blind

Truest gemini
Akashic and volatile
Born of a great divide
The two that should not be

And by their deeds unleashed
The great smouldering sea

And fire fills the sky
Burning the path to heavens
Flames rend and tear
All the world asunder
To cleanse the disease
O`Night Mother
