Man becomes his god, before the last grows cold
Shimmering in golden light, dead amongst all false idols

Behold the head of abandon
Eyes that stare and tell of revolt
Against the choirs of eternal servitude
And light the way to freedom
Through the studded gateway to morning stars

Flooding the depths of hope with blood as we march with haste to ancient lands
Stalking our sigil, a goat`s head lament, into the soil as a thorn with flesh

Embrace undoing
Creation reversed
So spake the oracle of demise
Anti-divine enthrallment
And the world dares to scorn

For aeons man has dreamt of the stars
And aspired to reach those gods of the night

Cosmic light has all but waned
On this night, like no other before
We are drawing down the stars
And the world bares the scorn
