Cold now are the stars that once burned with cosmic fire
Dying are the worlds that once waged war on each other
And the skies are torn asunder with celestial claws of death
Raining sorrow upon the worshipers of the cults of the sun

Amassing in the shadows are the reapers of the light
Who defy all cosmic law in hope to bring eternal nightfall
They are the spectral heralds of a glacial inquisition
Soon the dead will follow and sweep all worlds into darkness

No one has the right to exist

The myriad of worlds will fall into blackness
Scattered into atoms from astral bombardment
Sky-fire blazing relentless from above
Crashing down into the realms of the cults of the sun
The eye of the universe opens wide, aware
Glowing, ever watchful of the aeon of destruction
All is cast away into blackened formless voids
Dark forgotten prophecies eternally fulfilled

No one has the right to exist
