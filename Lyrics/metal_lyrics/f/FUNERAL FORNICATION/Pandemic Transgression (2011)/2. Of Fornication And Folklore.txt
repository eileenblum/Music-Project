Dark blood makes up our ancestry
The sands of time bury the windswept halls of history
And through the cunt of malice
Births a disease called humanity

O'venemous primate
Pray to thy father, thy shepherd
Guiding the hand into putrid conformity
You were lost before you began

Deaf and blind
In the land of pain
Beyond the valley of the shadow of death
Screaming into silence

A plague awoken
From fiery embers

Once beyond the scope of memory
Insane and drawn to lustful deeds
This beast was spewed from foul womb
To fornicate and feed
