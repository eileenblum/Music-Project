Darkness welcomes, though offers no release
In eclipse, consumed, I am forsaken

Love subsides, am I alive
The fading light once burned so bright

Crimean shade, murksome and loathing
From sluggish abyss, no honor bestowed

No longer can I fight the rogue
inside my heart

I am becoming
Unto night thy light is drawn
Lo, the darkest road unfolds
To the dark I now belong
There's a rogue inside my heart
With bright and blazing eyes
Staring down the bleak horizon

I am the liar
Actor with many masks
My role is self-destruction
My world fades to black

The darkest road unfolds
