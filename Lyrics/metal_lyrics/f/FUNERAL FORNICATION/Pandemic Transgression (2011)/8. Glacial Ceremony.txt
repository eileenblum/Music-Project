Snow-capped regions, shrouded legions
A flame that burns of purest blue
Moved into the light that shadow rejected
Opaque and still
The lurker`s burning eyes, lidless

The hunter stalks the tracks
His carrion prey
A mere reflection of himself
The beast itself
Was never really living at all

We none of us as we appear
In a polar dusk
The rotting of the day
We were never really living at all

Lone, the hunter starts a fire
Offering carrion to winter gods
The flames reflect upon his eyes
The man is not as he appears

The hunter sheds his mortal husk
To become the raging beast
Whose hour has come at last
And leers at the cold stars above, seething
