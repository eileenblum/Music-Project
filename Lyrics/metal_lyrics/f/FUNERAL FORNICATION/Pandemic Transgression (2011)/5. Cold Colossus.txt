I lay down cold, frozen
On a monolithic slab
Of unparalleled hatred
Withered, my form absorbs the odium
I merge with steel, I burn with anger
And become the sentient beast
With a heart of ice beneath (the surface)

My soul is cased in glass
Stowed away in an icy chamber
Hidden deep within me
A relic of my former self
Void of blood
This empty being

I've transcended, awoken
And become self-aware
My eyes are blazing
With eternal fire
Farewell to the flesh
Cleansed in flames
And now grown cold
frozen
