Iscariot wings
Spanning beyond the gaze of Christ
Carrion feast
A carcass glazed in ticks and lice
Virgin Mary
Mother burdened with unborn babe
Spread her legs
My knife shall penetrate her cave

Vaginal blood tastes like fear
All inhibitions disappear
Break down the doors of mother church
Holy daughters will feel the pain
Burned up inside from my taint
This is really going to hurt

The taste of sisters suits my palette
Becoming the Nunrapist
The ruin of angels, virginity gone
Becoming the Nunrapist
Incantations to provoke their lust
Becoming the Nunrapist
Leave them to drown in blood and cum
Becoming the Nunrapist

Her chastity knows no bounds
Break the seal!!!!

I throw the feces of Epicures upon the holy cross
In mocking howls of ecstasy, brutalizing God
Virgin lips and glancing eyes, fear, anticipate
Breaking hymen left and right with rage I violate

The taste of sisters suits my palette
Becoming the Nunrapist
