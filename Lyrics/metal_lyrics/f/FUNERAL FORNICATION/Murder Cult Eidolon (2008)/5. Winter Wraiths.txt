Summoner of evils
Crossing dark seals
From the depths of darkness, winter wraiths
Arise from the pages of legends

Dark gods of ice
Winterspirits, black coven
From the snowswept hall of ages, winter wraiths
As one with the timeless frost

Warrior of men
Proud and gallant
Riding from the northern mountains, sword in hand
Lone to seek the terror

Steel and spirit
Clash in battle
From the ghostly strikes fresh blood will flow
Screams drowned by the wind

Far beyond the caves
And silent arctic waves
Where the wind haunts a solstice, winter wraiths
Shrieking rage in the night

Summoner of evils
Crossing dark seals
From the depths of darkness, winter wraiths
Arise from the pages of legends
