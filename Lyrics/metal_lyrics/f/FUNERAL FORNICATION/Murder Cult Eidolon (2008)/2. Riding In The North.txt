Riding in the north
Bareback on a stygian horse
Nordic icy winds
A colder winter now begins
Up above
Grim foreboding skies
Oceans grow violent with their tides
Bloodied waters rise

Beaten lands of driven snow
A barren glacial plateau
Abysmal souls in the dark
Riding in the north

Realms of frigid ice
The home of sacrifice
The torches guide our way
To the throne of decay
From down below
Violent dragonbirths
The wraiths start to rise
Beasts spring up from the earth

Beaten lands of driven snow
A barren glacial plateau
Abysmal souls in the dark
Riding in the north

Riding in the north
Riding in the north
Riding in the north
Riding in the north
