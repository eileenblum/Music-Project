Evil plague
Sores and boils
A sign of the coming times
Raining blood
Thick as mire
Pouring from darkened skies

Riders four
Ascend with wrath
None shall be spared in the wake
Decades of darkness
Seas turn to acid
Prepare for a nuclear ice age

Armageddon arrives
Armageddon arrives
Armageddon arrives
Armageddon arrives

Locusts swarm
And decimate crops
Everyone will starve
Bodies will wither
And perish from blight
The end of all life

Devastation
Hells breaking loose
All is anarchy
Nothing left
In the world of the living
Apocalypse has come

Armageddon arrives
Armageddon arrives
Armageddon arrives
Armageddon arrives
