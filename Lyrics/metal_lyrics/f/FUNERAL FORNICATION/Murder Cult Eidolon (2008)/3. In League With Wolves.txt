Cold soul
In league with wolves

Refuge
In the snow
In heat with wolves

Call of the wild
Beckoning me
Living in woods and dreary caves
Call of the wolf
Spewing from me
Down on all fours to howl at the moon

Falling upon
Weary travelers
Nothing to eat for several moons
Salivating
Eager for blood
Feasting with my wolfen kin

Eyes gleam
In league with wolves

Wolfchild
Far from home
Raised by wolves

Full moon
In league with wolves

The thrill
Of the hunt
I am a wolf

Bark at the moon
Bark at the moon
Bark at the moon
Bark at the moon
