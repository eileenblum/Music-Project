I can see right threw your eye's when your hands begin to shake
I can see your sorrow I can see your pain
I wanna show you something real I think you made a big mistake
I know you fear tomorrow when you have to face your shame

[Chorus:]
And now the sun is going down and there's nothing I can do
With this whole life you wasted away
There were so many days that you wasted away
Don't let the sun go down on me don't burn these bridge's any more
I'm in your shadow and I'm scared that you wont let me in

We are the story of the world a broken generation
We are the story of the world a written revelation

You were never satisfied everything you touched withered away
You deserve your sorrow you deserve your pain
You kill your children in the silence to glorify your own desires
You've broken promises you never intended to keep

[Chorus]

Is this your picture perfect
Is this your picture perfect world
Is this your picture perfect
Is this your picture perfect
We are the story of the world a broken generation
We are the story of the world a written revelation
