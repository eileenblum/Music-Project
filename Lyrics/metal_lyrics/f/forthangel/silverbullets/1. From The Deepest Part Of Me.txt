Run away from everything from all the things we shared
just don't forget to read my letter
don't forget that we were happy we both made our mistakes
but we always found our way
don't give up on us now
from the deepest part of me

[Chorus:]
I said hey
if you wanna bring me down
just go ahead cuz I'm not sure theres a better part of me
I said hey
if you wanna leave me now
just think it over cuz I don't wanna make the same mistake's

You burned me
let me hear you tell me that you loved me
come on let me hear your voice
I watched you burn our love right to the
ground I hope your happy now that I'm gone
why'd you throw it away

[Chorus]

You ripped this whole thing appart I said
you ripped this whole thing appart
from the deepest part of me

[Chorus]
