Behind everything white light
fills the sky and it covers there eye's
They're controlled by this white light
they obey they submit they believe
Do you wonder why

[Chorus:]
Do you wonder why everything's wasting away
why does this feel like a nightmare
Do you wonder why everything's falling apart why doesn't anyone hear me
Please save me from this light
Do you know what it feels like
to be scared for your own life

Behind everything white light
fills the sky on this beautiful night
and they pray for there own lives
while there brothers and sisters grow weak

We will bring down these white lights
if it takes to the end of this life

[Chorus]

We sing tonight our voices rise
the sound we make the earth will shake
