When the wicked come with the rising sun
they follow me
they constantly keep me
awake at night under a moon lit sky
they hunt for me
drove by the scent of my blood
they've taken away everything that I've loved

[Chorus:]
I'm taking it back
I'm so sick of waiting as of right now I'm taking
my life back I want my life back
I'm so sick of waiting while the enemy's taking
my life away my life away
I will no longer wait with this gun in my hand
and I'll split you open
with my silver bullets

When my shadow falls on your prison wall
remember me
cuz I'm gonna keep you awake at night
and like a storm wind rising I'll come for you
drove by affliction and pain
it keeps me awake so I'm ready for war

[Chorus:]
I'm taking it back
I'm so sick of waiting as of right now I'm taking
my life back I want my life back
I'm so sick of waiting while the enemy's taking
my life away my life away
I will no longer wait with this gun in my hand
I'm so sick of wasting my life away
there's so many years I will never get back
with this gun in my hand I will no longer wait
for these giants to fall
and I'll split you open
with my silver bullets
