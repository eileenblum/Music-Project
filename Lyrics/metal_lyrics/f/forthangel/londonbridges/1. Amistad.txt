You can't stop me
I won't give up
you can't stop me

What would you believe if I told ya
of all the people that would just love to see me fall
would it make them happy if I just gave up
if it's any consequence
I'm not doing this for them

When my dreams are drifting farther away
am I strong enough to follow through
until the end

[chorus]
Sing with me this song
I'm not gonna rest until I'm done
cause one day I will hold my head up high
and show the whole world I never gave up and that's why I'm not giving up

You can't stop me
I won't give up

Would you call me a hypocrite if I told ya
there are some days I could just burn this whole world down
how can you judge what I've done with my life
cause I'm not like you
how could you judge my life
when I've given everything
how could you judge what I've done with my life
cause I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I'm not like you

When people say you're not enough
you'll never make it anywhere
just close your eyes and sing this song
Just close your eyes and sing

[chorus]
If you sing this song you'll feel much better
the hope in your heart will last forever
I'm not giving up
If you live for God and hope for heaven
the choices you make will last forever
Don't ever give up
don't ever give up

this is for all you haters out there
We'll here's a scream for you
RAW
