This is war
I won't die without a fight
war
I'll never run I'll never hide
sworn
with every breath that's left in me
I will never except defeat

My life has been an endless inglorious
war
over good and the evil I
fear
will accompany me to the end of time
when my enemies block out the sun

To the birds in the sky I am weak
to the ones that don't know they can't see
to the birds in the sky

[chorus]
Wake me up
well before the morning comes
I may have to give my life today
and I can see a perfect storm is already on it's way
and I pray for the souls of a world at

war
I won't die without a fight
war
I'll never run I'll never hide
sworn
with every breath that's left in me
I will never except defeat

Whoa... [repeating]

Oh my God
My eyes have seen a perfect and wonderful
piece
of what could have been possible
charged
of loosing purpose oh what have we done
what have we done

[chorus]
Wake me up
well before the morning comes
I may have to give my life today
and I can see a perfect storm is already on it's way
and I pray for the souls of a world at war

Oh my God
hold me close
in this fight
I need you more
