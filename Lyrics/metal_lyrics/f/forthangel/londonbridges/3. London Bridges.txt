Standing right here on the edge of a beautiful moment that's barely begun
I won't close my eyes cause if I do this could all disappear
If I do this could all disappear

I'll never close my eyes
if I do I might loose everything
I felt the weight of it all
but now I can finally breath

[chorus]
I'm standing right here
right here on the edge
of a beautiful life
I'm so happy that I
I'm standing right here
right next to you
will you catch me
will you catch me if I
fall down
if I fall down
I know you won't let me fall

for the sake of it all
Making my way through this world once again
the scars laid upon me remind me of when
the darkness was rising and I felt all alone
just remember that we all fall down
ya we all fall down
Don't let this world in
it will tear you apart

[chorus]
I'm standing right here
right here on the edge
of a beautiful life
I'm standing right here
right next to you
will you catch me
will you catch me when I
fall down
oh when I fall down
when I fall down
I know you won't let me fall

Wipe out my eyes
they're burning
please heal me inside
I'm hurting

Fighting off hate I'm at war once again
when I wake up tomorrow will it all disappear
The darkness is rising and I feel all alone
sometimes we all fall down
ya we all fall down

A part of me is broken down
but I'm not scared cause I know
this song I sing I'll scream out loud
I'll shout it from the mountain tops

I
LIVE
for this beautiful life
I
LIVE
for this beautiful life

[chorus]
I'm standing right here
right here on the edge
of a beautiful life
I'm standing right here
right next to you
will you catch me
will catch me if I fall down

we all fall down
sometimes we all fall
in the end we all fall down
sometimes we all fall
in the end we all fall down
