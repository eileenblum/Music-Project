I'm not breathing but I'm still alive
I should have took my own advise
and not given you everything
why'd you have to have everything
You took it all
I'm sleeping but I'm still awake
there's only so much I can take
how could you just leave me here alone
You just walked away
I'm sorry that I'm angry
and that I was never enough for you
I just can't believe your gone

[chorus]
This is my life and I've had my problems
out of all of my mistakes you're the biggest one
This is my life and I've had my problems
out of all of my mistakes
You hurt the most
I closed my eyes and you walked away
how do you sleep

I'm living but I'm dead inside
still searching for the reasons why
I use to think you we're an angel
I use to think our love was stable
but I was so wrong
You've given but you've taken more
you left me nothing
I don't need your love
Your sorry but I'm broken
you took it all

[chorus]
This is my life and I've had my problems
out of all of my mistakes you're the biggest one
This is my life and I've had my problems
out of all of my mistakes
You hurt the most
I closed my eyes and you walked away
how do you sleep

I turned around and you walked away
I turned around and you walked away
I never thought you'd be the one to leave me standing here alone
