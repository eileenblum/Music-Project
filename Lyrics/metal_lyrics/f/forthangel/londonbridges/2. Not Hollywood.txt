Iâm not here cause someone told me
one day I could be a star
If I just write songs that everybody likes Iâd make my way to Hollywood
Iâm not here for your opinion
I didnât come to make you smile
I donât doubt that your intentions differ from what Iâve been told
before I lay my heart on paper
you canât buy my words they're not for sale

[chorus]
Will you remember me
when you donât see my face on a magazine
Will you remember me when Iâm gone
cause Iâm not Hollywood O'whoa o'whoa
cause I'm not Hollywood O'whoa o'whoa

Iâm not here cause someone gave me
A million dollars and a brand new car
I show scars and pieces of this life Iâve lived and the things Iâve done
I'm not here to tell your story
I'll never sing your songs
Iâm not here so you can make me into something
that Iâve never been
before I lay my heart on paper
you canât buy my soul it's not for sale

[chorus]
Will you remember me
when you donât see my face on a magazine
Will you remember me when Iâm gone
cause Iâm not Hollywood

When my life's just a memory
will anything Iâve given matter at all
Will you catch me when I fall
cause Iâm not Hollywood

[chorus]
Will you remember me
when you donât see my face on a magazine
Will you remember me when Iâm gone
cause Iâm not Hollywood

When my life's just a memory
will anything Iâve given matter at all
Will you catch me when I fall
cause Iâm not Hollywood O'whoa o'whoa
cause I'm not Hollywood O'whoa o'whoa
cause I'm not Hollywood
