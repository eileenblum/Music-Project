Taste this blood that has pooled around me
The last of me
The eyes of the righteous search my lifeless form
Expecting to witness a change to fit this society
To engage in acts of the majority
I stay bound to what I know
Knowledge you see as evil
My acceptance is quickly fading as your hatred fills my heart
A heart once pure, now soiled with your ignorance
This mind will stay open to all there is to offer
Your relentlessness pushes me further away
My patience has dissolved into rage as I grow weary of your promises
Set on the next life yet you ignore the misery you have created in this life
Question all that has been taught
Consider it a lie until you have given it a thought
