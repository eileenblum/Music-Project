It seems your world is misplaced
And the sadness I see from your body tears a hole in me
Is there an answer?
It seems so unclear
I only hope for the best
What is it you're thinking?
I wish there was a way for me to counteract with your thoughts
Understand, realize - Make comfort with your mind's eye
I know so much is going on, but it won't escape your eyes
I only hope for the best
My heart breaks to see the look in your eyes
I need this thorn to leave my side
I wish there was something I could do
I only wish the best for you
My love is always there for you - Stay strong
I realize this problem is unavoidable
My actions have no impact
Time is not healing the wounds - Their tears are painful
What did you do to deserve this anguish, nothing.
I wish I could make a change
I wish the power were in my hands
I stand by your side
