No excuses for the pain you revealed to the purity of innocence
The tear of red pours from the eye of the helpless
Your infliction of dominance has stabbed through her delicate heart
Her beauty has faded inside
Mutilation of her purity
You drowned her life in the blood of your lustfull sickness
Your right to live is gone
Pure life has been cast into total darkness of your hatred
Her eyes seek the death of you
Her heart is stabbed with this shard of glass sliced from you
