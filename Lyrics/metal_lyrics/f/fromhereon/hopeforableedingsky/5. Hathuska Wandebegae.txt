Raped from their land
White lies shot through the veins of the oppressed
Their eyes sewn shut as you form them into your machines for profit
Their blood soaked families suffer for your industrialized greed
Your lies will be told for your industrialized greed
For your American dream
Even after your lies unfold in front of me
I see the blood on your hands that formed this robbery
That left the screams unheard
I hate your American dream
You hold this so dear to you
You have glazed our eyes over - No one saw a thing
Have you finally accomplished this American dream?
This American dream of lies
