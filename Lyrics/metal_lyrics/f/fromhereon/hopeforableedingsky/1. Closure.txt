Memories of you fade from my mind
Disappear as I close my eyes
Wishing I could shed a tear, but I feel nothing
Words so meaningless
Hindsight has lead me astray once again
Look at the face of a stranger that was once a friend
Drowned in regret
Your face I will soon forget
Existence fading, tongue thick with lies
Speak and I hear nothing
Promises so easy, quickly dismissed
Past disappears - Present unfolds - Future Beckons
At this point seperate
Extinguish all hope to reconcilliate
Your face has forever changed
It will never be the same
