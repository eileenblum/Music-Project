Sickened by this apathy
The problems sit in front of our eyes, but we do not see
We turn our backs to where the solutions lie
Destroy all that gives us life
Left it for dead, we will soon follow
No future, no tomorrow
Mankind's natural regression toward self-destruction
The sky bleeds as the wound becomes infected
The end of a world neglected
Sift through the ashes
Ignored the signs (cries)
Stripped away all that gives us our basic needs
We have already planted the seeds of destruction
Suffocate us for the price of corporation's greed
