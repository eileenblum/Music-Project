Heaven used to be on Earth
Once all beauty was
Burnt Down to ashes
The Sun went down
(We believe) it's still shining somewhere
But not for them!
Not warming their hearts (anymore)

In the land of dreams they suffer
Drenched to the skin
By the rain of tears
They slowly fall into oblivion

Not given even poor substitute for hope
How long would it take?
Will we ever wake up from this indecision?
Or will we let their hearts petrify?

So many suns sank under their hands, In their eyes ...
Silence is their executioner
Our indifference means everything
