Disguised faces of the past
Forsaken particles of history
So many crimes upon righteousness
None of them get ever punishment
Years of neglecting

But no longer shall we stay calm
The company of storms will enlighten our way
Once awakened no longer blindfolded

They thought it could be so easy
To erase so many years of deceiving relatives
How could it be?
Free Judas among betrayed?
But we won't stop
Until their guilt is revealed

The sands of hourglass pouring down
Counting their lies, multiplying sins

The body next door more than once poisoned
The son of your own more than once renounced
