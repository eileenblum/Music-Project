Over the years we've learned what misery means
This lesson will be the last we have
Let's count those years and never forget

If we've been left out in the rain for so long
Did it washed away all the memories we should have kept
About hollow days we once had to share
About days before we left our place

Defeat is a word we never knew
Now it's carved deep in our hearts
So deep that we can't see the truth behind

If we forget the past, we are doomed to repeat it
Over and over, over and over again

Still so many unanswered questions left
But so strong is our determination
That we will move on and we will find home
No matter how far it is and how long we've been fumbling in the dark

Within each vein it flows
And we will survive
Walk million endless nights
Trample under the stars
Just to catch a glimpse of light

We still believe that each step brings us closer to a place called home longed for so long, for so long

I'm trying not think that we could loose everything
I'm trying to believe that we could reach eternity
Trying not think we could loose it all
Trying to believe we could gain much more
