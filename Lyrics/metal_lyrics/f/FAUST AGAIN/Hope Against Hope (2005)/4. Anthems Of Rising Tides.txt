What is close and what is far
Whether you're in or whether you're out
What you care or don't give a fuck
You won't miss a thing

Shred your fears down
Bury your guilt down
Cry yourself out, try yourself out
Forget shit and leave (it) behind

You set aside fall down into another dimension
Wise up think twice don't black out this is not time to hang up
I want you to say that there is no time to push away
All that is yours what you care and what you love foremost

Life lies not between hope and fear
It's flash, it's blood, it's what you taste, what you see!

A tear for swallowed passion
And a smile for cheated faith

Satisfaction is still so far
But has to be found!
Each time you try to stop it it's getting back and you choke on it

Who chained you up? Why?
This is your time!

Each time you try to stop it it's getting back and you choke on it
Each time you try to stop it it's getting back on you

What makes you feel your life is not real
Why would you stop to breathe and cry
You've been sucked out, pulled down, dried out
Time to break out, take a course and fly out

Who told you to stop? why?
This is your time!

It's not going to stop!
This life is an eternal trap
