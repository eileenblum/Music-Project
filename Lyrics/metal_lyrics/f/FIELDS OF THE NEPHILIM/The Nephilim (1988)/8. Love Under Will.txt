I need to be alone tonight
Smother me or suffer
Lay down I'll die tonight
Smother me or suffer
When I'm gone wait here
Discover all of life's surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good smile

If you pass through my soul tonight
Gather all his troubles
Tomorrow's long with eternal night
Gather for tomorrow
When I'm gone wait here
Discover all of earth's surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good smile

Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good the earth is good
Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good the earth is good

Lay down lay down lay down for me
Lay down lay down lay down with me
When I'm gone wait here
Discover all of life's surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good bye

hey embrace me someone's gonna suffer
Lay lay lay it on lay lay lay it on me
Someone hey embrace me someone's gonna suffer
Sweet dreams my angel at last good bye
Sweet dreams
