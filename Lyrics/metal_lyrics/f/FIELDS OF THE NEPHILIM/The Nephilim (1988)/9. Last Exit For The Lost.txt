Would you pay life's pleasures to see me
Does it hurt for I want you to remain
I run your hair through in another decade
Summerland holds me in sumerian haze

Pain in places where the lovers mourn
Arranging the play things up and down the hall

Forever remain for every day
My honour remains
Forever remain

Between the spaces along the wall
Appearing faces that disappear at dawn
We're getting closer I can see the door
Closer and closer Kthulhu calls

Forever remain
Forever remain

You'll seek it it'll take a while
You'll seek this if it's a thousand miles
Take what fate brings eternal and desire
I'll change those faces then I take their smile

We're getting close to you I can see the door
Closer and closer or is it there at all

Forever remain
Forever remain

This could be my last regress
Last exit for the lost
This could be my last regress
Last exit for the lost
This could be my last regress
Precious for the lost
