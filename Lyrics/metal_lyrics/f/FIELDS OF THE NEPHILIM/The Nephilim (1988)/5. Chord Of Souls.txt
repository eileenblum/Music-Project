the preacher says to all his men
I hear godly laughter
can it be the end
well I'm on fire when he's so cold
I hear godly laughter
let it be the end
let it be the end

well I hate your conscience
let's skip this world
I hate your gods people who breed on earth
over to the other side
I'm caught stepping out
come over to the other side
save your brothers now

let it be the end
eyes eyes eyes eyes
honest men these worthy men
in all my dreams
I hear godly laughter unleash your souls the faceless knows
I'm disclosed it's not a god I'm after

let it be the end
let it be the end
let it be the end
believers chord of souls
let it be the end
let it be the end
let it be the end between us chord of souls
eyes eyes eyes eyes

and I hate your country
and I hate your world
I hate your Gods people who breed on earth
over to the other side
I'm caught stepping out
over to the other side
I'm gonna recreate a religious experience
to tear my fucking heart out

the end believers
let it be the end
the end between us
lord of souls
the end believers
let it be the end
let it be the end between us chord of souls
let it end
let it end
let it end
eyes eyes eyes eyes no
