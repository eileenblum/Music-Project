we must suffer
to free our pain
can you help us
to find our way
you're here to stay
stay here in paradise
I'd end this moment
to be with you
through morphic oceans
I'd lay here with you
only to stay
stay here in paradise
only to stay son
lonely from this maelstrom
free are you
from this maelstrom
to be with you
