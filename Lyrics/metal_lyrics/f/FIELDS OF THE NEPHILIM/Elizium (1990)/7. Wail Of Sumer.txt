you can see the earth
we're high here
we're climbing over sumertown
you can kiss the air
we're gliding
follow me for sumerland
no sound life no essence
we lay entranged in our curious ways
memories lay beside us
but I'm seeing through an age
who I am
through sumerland
lead me taken from god
forgivers sent in to the dark to play
from life here I lead them
taken away from where they layed
getting old together
to breathe myself free
I'll stay
we're high here
forever
no tomorrow no today
through sumerland lead me
