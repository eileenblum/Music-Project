Love of my life, God grant the years
Confirm the chrism - rose to rood!
Anointing loves, asperging tears
In sanctifying solitude!
That holds my heaven and holds my hell.

Yes today life that I knew
So sick of all the people
A blind moon over to the window
Where the night has become elizium
For the sleepless souls
And our days to come
You stand with dalila
May be I'll just pass-away
Or may be I'll stay
But I feel alive with you
And I feel some kind of heaven
When I feel deep inside her
I feel some kind of heaven
Hear me
Give me some kind of heaven

Such lights she gives as guide my barque;
That holds my heaven and holds my hell.
Love of my life
Man is so infinitely small
Man is so infinitely great!
