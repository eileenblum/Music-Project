Well he talks in confusion
and he faults your point of view
You talk about his apparition
and he talks
hear him laughing at you
Contamination and radiation
Let it crawl while the city sleeps
Your turn to lay for bait for a while
Now you're melting through your burning fields
and all my people say oh
Stop!

When he talks
connected scars reopen
A thousand fingers
reach out for you
We don't feel no contamination
We don't feel no contamination
We don't feel no contamination
We don't feel no contamination
Oh keep talking
You're a hunter I'm a wolf
Yeah keep talking
I'm the preacher you're a fool
Contamination and radiation
Let it crawl while the city sleeps
Your turn to lay for bait for a while
Now you're melting through your burning fields
That's when my people say oh
We don't feel no contamination
Radiation, contamination
Radiation, contamination
Radiation, contamination
Radiation
