He rides on the crest of a wave
his anger running out
he acts as if the same way
as I ride across town to town
I forgive you follow me
I forgive you follow me
I forgive you follow me
I'll forgive you
I'll forgive you
I've seen the hardest men fall
I've seen them crawl
secrets I know where noone can find them
behind the darkened door
I can feel what she wants me to be
I can see the movements she'll make
'cause
I can see
I can see
I can see
I can see
I can see
I can see
I've seen harder men fall
I've seen them crawl
secrets I know where noone can find them
behind the darkened door
darkened door
darkened door
darkened door
I forgive you follow me
I forgive you follow me
I forgive you follow me
I'll forgive...
I've seen harder men fall
I've seen them crawl
secrets I know where noone can find them
behind the darkened door
the darkened door
the darkened door
the darkened door
