Tempted white eyes
Blinded by the night
Hollow like the towers
On the inside
Laura's a machine
She's burning insane
Laura's a machine

For a menace in disguise
Behold this night
The four walls are furnished
Now she's alive
No one ever helped poor Laura
No one ever helped poor Laura

She's rabid in ecstasy
She's rabid in ecstasy
She's rabid in ecstasy
She's rabid in ecstasy

She's on the line to cut it all
She's on the line to drop and fall
She's on the line to cut it all
She's on the line
Line to fall

People laughing an awful sight
People leave Laura this is her night
Laura have you seen it
Laura can you say
Laura can you see

From the light of the Catherine wheel
She spins from above
Haunted by these times
My European love

No one ever helped poor Laura
No one ever helped poor Laura

She's rabid in ecstasy
She's rabid in ecstasy
She's rabid in ecstasy
She's rabid in ecstasy

She's on the line to cut it all
She's on the line to drop and fall
She's on the line to cut it all
She's on the line
Line to fall

Laura

Laura
