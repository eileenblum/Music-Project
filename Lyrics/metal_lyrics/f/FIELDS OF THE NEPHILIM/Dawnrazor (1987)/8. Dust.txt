Lord, I wanna watch it rain
I got a heat since love, as she breaks
Dust, we fade the scene
Gotta reason in peace, now explain

Feelings go on and on
Killing, it's all man-made
The rhythm of life is all too strong, so we burn it

Come down, right upon the train
In a swirling pool of blood and brains
Well that's fate, my mind is made
Be a woman a child, a child's masquerade

Feelings go on and on
Killing, it's all man-made
The rhythm of life is all too strong, so we burn it
The western heroes

Blood, I've walk the high wire
I had to walk real high to see today
Dust, fade without a name
When I finish my war, I'll fade the scene
Feelings go on and on
Killing, it's all man-made
The rhythm of life is all too strong, so we burn it
The western heroes

I walk the high wire
