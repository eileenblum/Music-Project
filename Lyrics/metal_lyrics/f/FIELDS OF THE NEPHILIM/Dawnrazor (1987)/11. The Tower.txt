She lifts the flowers from the window box
Summers flowers now winter flocks
She lifts her veil to the morning rain
Hides her eyes from the sun again

A thousand years shimmer on her face
Cut inside she redreams the tast
She knocks her flowers from the window side
They fall to the ground they fall to the ground

Hide away from the raging sun
You hide your love from the fire beyond

See the woman in an ancient form
She's tangled in the bushes tall
Cowering down with head in hands
She cries out loud she cries out loud
Seems so cold it seems so cold tonight
Seems so cold seems so cold tonight

Hide away from the raging sun
You hide your love from the fire beyond
