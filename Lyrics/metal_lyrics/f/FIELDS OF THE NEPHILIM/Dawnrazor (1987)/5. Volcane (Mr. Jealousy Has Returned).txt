Mr. Jealousy has returned
Yearning, yearning
Mr. Jealousy has returned to reality
All secured by humanity
You're living in danger
Mr. Jealousy has returned your hurting me
Can't you see?
Our love is in danger
Living inside her this love volcane
Now burn inside her this love volcane
Living inside her this love volcane
Now burn inside her this love volcane
Mr. Jealousy has returned
Mr. Jealousy has returned
Living inside her
Now burn inside her
Volcane...
Walk on...
Volcane, Volcane, Volcane
Yearning...
