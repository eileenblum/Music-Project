Pain, we are transforming
With your daughters underground
Pain, we look like sisters
Caught up in a landslide
Falling down

Too far you can't feel it
Too far you can't reach it
Too far

Reanimator
Reanimator now

Reanimator
Reanimator now

Pain, entranced by fire
Your world stinks
Your world stinks of you

Pain
The world's unwired
Your mind burns
Your mind burns on through
Too far you can't feel it
Too far you can't reach it
Too far
Too far
Reanimator
Reanimator now
Reanimator
Reanimator now
