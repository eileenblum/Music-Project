All great plains of the Earth
Are now lightened by fire
Now gather on the wrecked land
From these horsemen in iron

This is fear
You've all turned up
Now the atmosphere
Is thicker than blood

From Gehenna to here
A release of sin
It's become our lair
We
The Nephilim

Room full of people
Now scarred and distressed
The time's now happened
And the captured in a mess
The girl in the shawl
Crashes to the floor
Crying, "Open the gates
To the Devils' hordes."

See the woman thrive
In the blood from Heaven
Burn in banished fire
Like a scene called Hell
See the bloody fire
To you is forsaken
Burn this banished fire
Burn
Burn Hell

Centered by the arts
Most brutally
People are scarred
By cruelty
Oh

When malevolence falls
And what about ours
This message is clear
Now open up the ground

See the woman thrive
In the blood from Heaven
Burn in banished fire
Like a scene called Hell
See the bloody fire
To you is forsaken
Burn this banished fire
Burn
Burn Hell

Burn Hell
Burn Hell
