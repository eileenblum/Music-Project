The war is passed
Now she tells him again
You should fetch the plans
The(?), the(?) you see

Leeway

Like the sun over the closing door
Whispered Caroline, walks down the steps
So feel the pain, feel the pain
The Heathen, the Heathen
Like the Heathen, the Heathen

From the crowd "Come Children of the Called"
And in the sect, they hurry around the closing door

So feel the pain, feel the pain
The Heathen, the Heathen
Like the Heathen, the Heathen

The Heathen...

Like the Heathen
Like the Heathen
God look out for the Heathen
The Heathen...

One more nightmare calling
Across the farthest fields
The night skies are dawning
Takes this much as you

Trees come down
Fall...

There's a girl in a green dress
She's got eyes like fire and lips so tame
She's huddled by the girl who's crying in the red dress
Hunger for life in this dying dying age
