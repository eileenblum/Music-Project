Moon is rising
A million years to me
Soon be quieter
A passing tear from me
Sing the same
Lie here with me
Dreams a dream
They all drop dead asleep

Shining higher
A foolish tune
A cry from the top of the spire
Wear a prayer, drops and crumbles
Crumbles
Crumbles
Yes crumbles

Darkcell is among you
Darkcell is in my room
Darkcell with the mortal freak
Darkcell let me speak
Darkcell tomorrow bloom
Darkcell is in my room
Darkcell with the mortal freak
Darkcell let me speak to you...

Let me out
Let me
Let me out...
