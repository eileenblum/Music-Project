(Wake me up)
(Weâre here)
(Shekinah)
[Then I saw a new Heaven]
(Light)
(Rise)
(You evolve in my time)
[For the first Heaven and the first Earth have passed away]
(From this moment on you are born*)
[Then I saw a new Heaven]
Yeah, We are Fallen
Like the mourning sun
We are waking up
Yeah, We are Fallen
Like the mourning sun
It's just begun
This old world will pass away
This is the dawn of our new day
We didnât fall from Heaven
We didnât fall for you
Rise!
Yeah, We are Fallen
Like the mourning sun
We're waking up
Yeah, We are Fallen
Like the mourning sun
The mourning sun
(We're here)
Like the morning sun
The morning sun
Iâm alive
(Shekinah)
{Don't you see, I'm never* away}
{I'll be watching over you now}
(Why won't she move?)
{????? I think of you ???}
(Why? ???)
Wake up
Melt
Melt
(wake up)
Yeah, We are fallen
Like the mourning sun
Yeah, We are fallen
Like the mourning sun
Weâve fallen like rain
Iâve been waiting for the day
And the light has made*
I will rise again
And our wings will unfold
And be painted like gold
And I saved my soul
Iâm alive again
(morning son)
I will rise again
(like the morning sun)
We will rise again
(like the morning sun)
[Then I saw a new heaven and a new Earth,
The first Heaven and the first Earth have passed away]
{I've been sent to pray* over you}
(????)
