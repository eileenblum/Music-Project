(86 degrees)
(86 degrees)
(Yes today)
All Evil it has come from here
the Camphor gets no warmer
Ye Nacoaler*, our Crucified Creator
Down* count to zero burning cold now
I'll be there for the rest of my life
Tomorrow
Xiberia
Xiberia
Xiberia
I want to breath
But out of you
Malaria messiah
Burning in the weather
Skin crumbles
skin my life
Xiberia, Xiberia
Xiberia, Xiberia
Xiberia, Xiberia
Heart, heart, heart
We're in the warm*
You're in ????
Higher, higher, higher
Reliving*
No feeling no motion
Yet still alive
(You can see the doorway towards your betrayer)
(86 degrees below)
86 degrees and below
(Heartbeat increases)
(Unleash yourself*)
You're still alive
86 degrees and below
Frozen for the new day
Meriah
Seasons in the Ice cage
We're on fire
Xiberia
Xiberia
(???)
Xiberia
Xiberia
