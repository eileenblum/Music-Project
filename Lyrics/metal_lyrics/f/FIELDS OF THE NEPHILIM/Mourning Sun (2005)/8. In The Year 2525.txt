[Bonus track]

(In The Year 2525)
(3535)
(4545)
(5555)
in the year 2525
if man is still alive
if woman can survive
they may find...
(In The Year 2525)
(3535)
(4545)
(5555)
in the year 3535
ain't gonna need to tell the truth tell no lies
everything you think do and say
is in the pill you took today
in the year 4545
ain't gonna need your teeth won't need your eyes
you won't find a thing to chew
nobody is gonna look at you
(In The Year 2525)
(3535)
(4545)
(5555)
in the year 5555
your arms are hanging limp at your sides
your legs got nothing to do
'Cos some machine is doing that for you
in the year 6565
ain't gonna need no husband won't need no wife
you'll pick your son pick you pick your daughter too
from the bottom of a long glass tube
(In The Year 2525)
(3535)
(4545)
(5555)
in the year 7510
if God's a-comin' he ought to make it by then
maybe he'll look around and say
"I guess it's time for the Judgement Day"
in the year 8510
God is gonna shake his mighty head
he'll either say "I'm pleased where man has been"
or tear it down and start again
in the year 9595
I'm wondering if man's gonna be alive
he's taken everything this earth can give
and he ain't put back nothing...
(now it's been 10,000 years)
(man has cried a billion tears)
(for what he never knew)
(now man's reign is through)
(but through the eternal night)
(the blinding starlight)
(so very far away)
(maybe it's only yesterday...)
(In The Year 2525)
(3535)
(4545)
(5555)
in the year 2525
if man is still alive
he's taken everything this world can give
and that'll be soon
(???)
(???)
(end of the road)
[For the first Heaven and the first Earth have passed away]
[???]
[so far from hell]
(so far from hell)
(it's all fading)
(the light)
(the warm safe)
(warm soul)
(we cannot show)
(the warmth to our soul)
(for we will burn)
(before we're free)
You cannot live through this
Like death is our warm kiss
We changed the chance
Ruled the dance
your blood is on our lips
and we can't go further
and no further now
no it ain't much further
Ain't much further now
(???)
(???)
