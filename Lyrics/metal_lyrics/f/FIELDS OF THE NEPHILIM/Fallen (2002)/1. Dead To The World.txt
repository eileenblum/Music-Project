rejected by you
for what we believe
this world is a lie
and you can not see
the truth that we speak
you dont want to hear
you live for your world
and you dont really care

chained to the
chained to the
chained to the world

weve been there before
a slave to this world
we followed the lies
and the truth we ignored
our chains have been broken
and we see what for
now we have freedom
cuz were dead to this world

dead to the
dead to the
dead to the world

dead to the world
not slaves
dead to the world
God were living for
not slaves anymore
dead to the world
dont be satan's whore

i'm alive cuz i have died to
this world
i'll survive the end of time
with my Lord
