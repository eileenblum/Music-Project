The moon is brighter
the more you're near to me
soon be quieter
A passing tear from me
Sing the same
lie here with me
again today
your trapped here-
I see you.
Shining higher,
I feel it's dim
there's a cry from the top of the spire
from where a bell drops and crumbles,
crumbles...
crumbles...
yes, it crumbles.
Darkcell,
is among you
Darkcell,
this is my room
Darkcell,
with a martal freak
Darkcell,
let me speak...
Darkcell,
tomorrow bloom
Darkcell,
this is my room
Darkcell,
with a mortal freak
Darkcell,
let me speak to you.
Let me out
let, let me
let me out
let me out
let me, let me out
