You cannot shelf, my words to yourself,
or any emotions of how I have felt.
I know this game; words donât mean what they mean.
Cannot believe this obscenity.

Anticipate as we instigate, as lies connect, and we intercept.
You canât break me., Canât break this clear intellect.

Put yourself in check bitch.

Belligerent., With straight ignorance
With No thoughts to reminisce
Fuck this, cuz Iâm so god damn sick of it.

Your logic doesnât seem to fit.
Can you see under this fallacy?
Remembering memories, Losing your sanity
Ending on tragedy.

Thatâs fine, but that ainât me.
The human race is losing it. Times have changed.
Not a single ounce of pride in this society.
Blinded by the lies they talk with their tongues.
Speaking in hypocrisy.

He who is not courageous enough to take risks,
will accomplish nothing in life.

You canât break me.
Canât break this clear intellect.
This routine of not being me, when you talk and
no one knows what you mean.
Quit being played, all feels the same.

I just want my music to help turn a page, Feel my rage.
An author not stirred.
These egotistical tendencies are not your remedy
this poison leaves you blinder than Hennessey
Always the same, runninâ the game.

Living in moments of shame.
In booth or on stage, dues gettingâ paid,
started out on that minimum wage.
This routine of not being me,
when you talk no one knows what you mean.
Quit being played. All feels the same.

I just want my music to help turn a page.
