[intro]
All I know began to change.
These reflections have no directions.
Falling to the floor, I thought I would get up.
After all this time.
Iâm not giving up. I thought I would learn to move forward. 
Iâm beginning to feel the blood from the war.
What else do I have to show? 
Donât let your mind bring you down.

[verse]
The pain it will remain, if you keep your mind the same.
How can you be happy? When youâre always in shame.
Where did you think youâd go?
When your mind is in a dark hole.
The weight of your worries will take its toll.
Listen to the sounds, from your heart and from your mind.

[chorus]
Falling to the floor, I thought I would get up.
After all this time.

[breakdown]
Why does everything feel empty?
If you change nothing, nothing will change.

[interlude]
I'm not afraid to hurt anymore.

[bridge]
Just remember, the voices inside your head.
May lead your start or be your end.
Iâm not afraid to hurt anymore.
Iâve felt this way too many times before.

[chorus]
All I know began to change.
These reflections have no directions.
Falling to the floor, I thought I would get up.
After all this time.

[verse]
The pain it will remain, if you keep your mind the same.
How can you be happy? When youâre always in shame.

[pre outro]
Donât let your mind bring you down.
Inhale, exhale, and listen to the sounds.
Go where you wonât be found.

[outro]
Feel the rhythm of your heart pound.
Just let hope fall through the clouds.
Please let it shine.
