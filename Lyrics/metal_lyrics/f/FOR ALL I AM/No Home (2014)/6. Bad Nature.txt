We have no time,
along with not too many options left to choose.
What else do we have to lose?
Donât talk. Just Act. Just show.
Donât promise. Just prove.
The more we speak our words become hollow.
Our actions are never created, because we just follow.
Our hearts remain so broken and weâve become so alone.

We want out of this, out of this mess we live in.
We need our dreams to feel more vivid.
They say we feel so lost, when we feel this way.

Why wait for something we can do today?
Do we truly feel content? Living this way?

We want out of this, out of this mess we live in.
We need our dreams to feel more vivid.
They say we feel so lost, when we feel this way.
