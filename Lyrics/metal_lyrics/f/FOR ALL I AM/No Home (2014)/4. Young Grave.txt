Always keep your head up
With this life that you go through
When its down youâll miss what could be right in front of you
Why wait for something that you can do today?
You are the only person standing in your way.
Donât let it become this way.

Write a song. Thatâll change your life one day.
Where the harmful words of other people dim away.
Sing it to the audience.
Give the world a little sense.
To the truth of what you feel
Only try to speak whatâs real
As we are surrounded by everyone in pain.

We are all in a state of suffer
And were just trying to breathe
But weâre all so scared as everyone tries to sheathe our chests.

Write a song. Thatâll change your life one day.
Where the harmful words of other people dim away.
Sing it to the audience.
Give the world a little sense.
To the truth of what we feel
Only try to speak whatâs real
As we are surrounded, by everyone in pain.

Trying to dig us in our graves, and lay us to rest?

I know how it feels. To be at war
with a world that never loved me.
That never fucking loved me
Sadly, this is our reality.

Just believe in yourself.
And have faith in your abilities.
Donât let people bring you down.
Regressing your capabilities.
