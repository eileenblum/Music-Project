As I begin to drift away
The demons dance and they're here to stay
The demons dance and they're here to stay
Consumed by my own mind with no self-control
I'm losing it
I'm losing it

Black blood is pouring inside of me
I made a plea with the devil
And now we're in harmony
I'm knee deep in my own dark thoughts
I've emerged from a world of dark

I now call my home

I stared straight into my eyes
Telling myself that I'm scared to die, scared to die, always scared to die
All this time I thought I was learning how to live
Telling myself that I'm scared to die

But death is the only thing
I'm not familiar with
God held my hand
And the devil waited for me to fall

Losing my mind with no self-control
He has my soul

Why don't I pry your fucking mouth from your face
Every word you say puts me in these haunting days
You tried to crack my ribs
Stomp on my heart
But as you can see
I've been soulless from the start

No soul [4x]

I stared straight into my eyes
Telling myself that I'm scared to die, scared to die, always scared to die
All this time I thought I was learning how to live
Telling myself that I'm scared to die

Everything hurts but I stil tend to smile
I hold everything inside
Holding on to vile feelings
Incinerating my hope away

I'm fucking losing it [4x]
Fuck
