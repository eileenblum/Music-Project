We've been swallowed alive
Been devoured from the inside (inside)
We can't escape this place.
The world's fire will turn into spark at this pace.

I speak so loud
But none of you can hear me.
I've tried so hard.
But none of you can see me.

[Chorus:]
If happiness truly comes from feeling alive.
Then why does every day feel just like I have died.
In this place, I'm digging my own grave.
My heart stops as I start to break away.
I break away from all these thoughts so filled with pain.

All these thoughts so filled with pain.

At this point.
I'm all out of bitter tears to shed.
This is what I feared.

What is real when I'm numb to my pain?

[Chorus]

Life is a lie, death is our debt
Someone please help me out alive.
Life is a lie, death is our debt.
My end is near.

[Chorus]

All these thoughts so filled with pain.
All these thoughts so filled with pain.
