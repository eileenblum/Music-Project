Today, I do not have a heart.
Yesterday, my soul was ripped a part.
Tomorrow, I hope this wonât restart.
No one should feel content this way.
While I lay here, my pain is here to stay (Here to stay)
Iâm so sick of feeling this way.

Just like the bullet leaves the gun.
Just like the cancer in our veins.
The truth it hurts,
the truth it hurts so much and lies wonât ease your pain.

My hope begins to stray away.
My vision of this life is a haze.
Life is a haze

They say happily ever after.
Does that mean we stay happy forever?

I used to know where I came from.
Now theyâre memories that feel so numb.

I am the one to blame.
Why canât things go my way?

Consume me. Iâm ready.

While I lay here, my pain is here to stay. (Here to stay)
Iâm so sick of feeling this way. (Feeling this way)

Just like the bullet the bullet leaves the gun.
Just like the cancer in our veins.
The truth it hurts,
the truth it hurts so much and lies wonât ease your pain.

My hope begins to stray away
My vision of this life is a haze.
Life is a haze.
