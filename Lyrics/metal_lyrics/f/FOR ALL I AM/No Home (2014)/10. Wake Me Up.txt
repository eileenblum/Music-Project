When is this over? Iâm just ready to start, but time is getting slower.
Iâm beginning to fall apart.
I want something more than this, empty faith and my heart begins to race.
When I fathom that I have a fate, with the ability to create. I want my dreams, my hopes.
Sadly stuck with, no dreams;
No hope;
I want something more than this, empty faith.
My heart begins to race. When I fathom that, I have a fate.

All the seconds turn to minutes and the hours turn to days. Iâm going insane.
Will I ever leave this place? Wake me up, from this daze. All the seconds turn to minutes.
Iâm growing so sick of this.

A lion, does not concern itself with the opinion of sheep. Bleed sheep.
Why the fuck would I listen to you? After all that you put me through?
I want something more than this, empty faith and my heart begins to race.
When I fathom that I have a fate, with the ability to create.
I want my dreams, my hopes. Sadly stuck with,
No dreams; no hope.

The moonbeams, holding the foundation to my dreams
