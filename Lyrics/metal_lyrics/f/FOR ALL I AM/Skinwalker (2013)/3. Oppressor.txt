You can't stop us now
Reap what you sow

You think you're so tough?
You pushed, you shoved
Made my life so rough
Enough is enough
Wake up, open your eyes and see
The hate that flows inside me

My bones were once made of glass
Every day I used to break
Now they're all made of steel
Built from when I would feel broken

So throw your punches at me
And I'll hit back in return
I see the fear in your eyes
Some people never learn (never learn)
The tables can turn
Wake up, open your eyes and see

Karma's a motherfucker
You did this to yourself
Have you had enough?
You did this to yourself
Have you had enough?

I'm not a victim of your insecurities
Do not pour that on me
There's no remose for the weak
I've said it once, I won't say it twice
Stand up for yourself
Take back your life

Your mind and heart have been free all along, all along

My bones were once made of glass
Every day I used to break
Now they're all made of steel
Built from when I would feel broken
My bones were once made of glass
Every day I used to break
Now they're all made of steel
Built from when I would feel broken

Leave your past behind, don't look back
You can only move forward in time
Free from the chains that hold you down
There is nothing that can stop us now

Free yourself from walking in their footsteps
Your mind and your heart have been free all along

There is nothing that can stop us now
