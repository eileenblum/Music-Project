Oh!
From the very start
Was it really all for the music?
From the very start
This was your dream and now you'll lose it
All these bad intentions
I can't erase the thought that we've been through this all before
How can you not give back
When they gave you their all?

This used to be about passion, what happened?
Tell me what the fuck happened!
This used to be about passion
Did sincerity go out of fashion?

So sleep with the lights on 'cause they'll find you
Oh, they'll find you
It's not safe to stay in the bed when you lay
The wolves are at the door

They built you an empire and you just threw it away
But everyone's got a price
There's a price on your head
This is the price you pay

Deceiveers and thieves
Intoxicated with greed
Deceivers and thieves
Where is your dignity?
Fake smiles, you're nothing without them
We see through you, we see through you
Don't you recognize that face in the mirror
Your life is a lie, can we be any clearer?

This used to be about passion, what happened?
Tell me what the fuck happened!
This used to be about passion, what happened?
Did sincerity go out of fashion?

So sleep with the lights on
'Cause they'll find you
Oh, they'll find you
It's not safe to stay in the bed where you lay
The wolves are at the door

They're hunting you down
This is the price you pay
They're hunting you down
This is the price you pay
(This is the price you pay)

Enjoy the company of guilt (company of guilt)
When will you learn your lesson?
Don't burn the bridges they so carefully built
Don't take advantage of their obsessions

So sleep with the lights on
'Cause they'll find you
Oh, they'll find you
It's not safe to stay in the bed where you lay
The wolves are at the door
