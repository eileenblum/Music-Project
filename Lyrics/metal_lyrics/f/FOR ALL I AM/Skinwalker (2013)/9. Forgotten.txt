Can we address the situation for a second?
It seems we've let the pressure get the best of us again
I feel the rush in my feet
Oh the anxiety
So vulnerable that even I can see

We've let a ghost into our home
The strangers we call our friends
Are always the first to cast their stones
So hard to break out from a scene that drags you down again
So simpleminded
No need to pretend
That anyone would ever give a fuck about where you wind up
In the end

Forgotten
Will they remember you
When the lights go out
Forgotten
Will they be there for you
When your time runs out

Don't feed me these fucking lies
Drag my name in the mud for the last time
How I despise your kind
It's such a disgrace to sell your soul in such a shameful way
Hollow words, hollow thoughts
They will never break me
Hollow words, hollow thoughts
They will never break me

Oh, so simpleminded
No need to pretend
That anyone would ever give a fuck about where you wind up
In the end

Forgotten
Will they remember you
When the lights go out
Forgotten
Will they be there for you
When your time runs out

I see no escape
I see the brightness of stars wither away
Oh, you could've been so much more
But it's the path you take
That will lead you to this early grave

We will all forget you
We will all forget you
We will all forget you
We will all forget you
We will all forget you
We will all forget you...
