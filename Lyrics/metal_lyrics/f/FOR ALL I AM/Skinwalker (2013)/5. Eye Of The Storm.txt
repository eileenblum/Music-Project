Your cries of white
Don't match the black of your eyes
Oh, and the fire you ignite
Won't burn away the lies
'Cause the storm is threatening
To wash it all away!

Don't swear to me
That you're as sharp as the blade that can cut through the bullshit
You're not what you pretend to be
Just a mountain of lies waiting to crash into the sea

And I won't be there to pick up the pieces
Can you feel the gravity of your words
Gather on your back now
These crooked lies on crooked spines are weighing down
Can you feel the gravity?
And it hurts to learn your precious words
Are worthless as they burn away

Burn away!
All choked up
Learn to bite your tongue
Burn away!
Inhale the smoke
Black heart, black lungs

And it hurts to learn your precious words
Are worthless as they burn away
Away
Away
Away
Your cries of white won't match the black of your eyes
The storm is approaching the shore

Drowning away
I hope you never see the sun again

When the flood begins to pull you under
You can swear to the rain that you'll change
It won't save you now
Can you feel the gravity of your words
Gather on your back now
These crooked lies on crooked spines are weighing down
Can you feel the gravity?
And it hurts to learn your precious words
Are worthless as they burn away

From the bottom of my black heart
I hope you never see the sun again
From the bottom of my black heart
I hope you never see the sun again
From the bottom of my black heart
I hope you never see the sun again
