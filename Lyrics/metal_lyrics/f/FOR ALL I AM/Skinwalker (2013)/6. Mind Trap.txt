Here we are at the bottom, can we rise again?
Will we ever escape this place?
A new low, slipping further into the cracks
Deep down I wish I could take it all back
Oh, I've done it now
I wish the cold would break
I need the sun's embrace
But it set so long ago
Will it ever rise again?

When the stars fall down on me
I realize that the little things are meaningless
And they're the reasons why we lie to ourselves
When the skies crash down on me
I realize that I've lost my inspiration
Now it's clear it's the fear inside
That's brought this nightmare to life

It's never easy it seems
Am I the only one who battles these monsters,
Underneath the surface
Why do they pull at me?
They scream the same dark words
With their sick dark mninds
There is a place in hell reserved for your kind
There is a place in hell reserved for their kind

So let go
Of all the hooks you've embedded in me
Breathe in the cold air
Let it chill to your bones
I wish I was there in your time of distress
'Cause I'm a mess on my own
And how it hurts to hate
Everything I've grown to hold so near
But I'll find strength when it all collapses
I promise you, dear

When the stars fall down on me
I realize that the little things are meaningless
And they're the reasons why we lie to ourselves
When the skies crash down on me
I realize that I've lost my inspiration
Now it's clear it's the fear inside
That's brought this nightmare to life

Is this the hand that fate has dealt us?
Worse and worse, day by day
Here we are at the bottom, can we rise again?
Will we ever escape this place?

There's no escape!
Oh!
There is only suffering
When will I find my peace?
No one can save me
Nightmares brought to life
Save me from myself
Nightmares brought to life
Save me from myself

Breathe in the cold air
Let it chill to your bones
I wish I was there in your time of distress
'Cause I'm a mess on my own
And how it hurts to hate
Everything I've grown to hold so near
But I'll find strength when it all collapses
I promise you, dear
