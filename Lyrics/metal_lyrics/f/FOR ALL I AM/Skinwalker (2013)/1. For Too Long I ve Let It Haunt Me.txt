Open your eyes to the dawning skyline
Pure air holds new beginnings
Seize the moment, bravery shows
You can make it on your own

Dead clocks have spun today
I realized my negative traits
Perfect imperfections
Good sight on my direction
Time to pick up the pace
When will you learn from your mistakes

Don't feed the sadness inside
Lift up your chin
Hold up your pride
Some days you'll feel alive
Other days you'll feel like you've died
One foot in front of the other
All the signs point straight ahead
I know it seems every day gets tougher, but the hurt is worth it
You're stronger in the end

I constantly see the devil inside me
He says that misery loves company, but I'll break free
I've constantly been surounded by tragedy
For too long I've let it haunt me, so I'll break free
(I'll break free)

Open your eyes to the dawning skyline
Pure air holds new beginnings
Seize the moment, bravery shows
You can make it on your own

Cast out the doubt inside your heart
Reverse the curse
This can be worse
Cast out the doubt inside your heart
Reverse the curse
This can be worse

I won't let them take me!
Hush your fear
The demons are approaching near
Hush your fear
The path has now become so clear

I know it seems every day gets tougher, but the hurt is worth it
You'll be stronger in the end

I constantly see the devil inside me
He says that misery loves company, but I'll break free
I've constantly been surounded by tragedy
For too long I've let it haunt me, so I'll break free
(I'll break free)

Open your eyes to the dawning skyline
Pure air holds new beginnings
Seize the moment, bravery shows
You can make it on your own
