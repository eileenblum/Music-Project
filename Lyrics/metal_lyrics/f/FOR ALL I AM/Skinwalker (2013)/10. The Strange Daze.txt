It's not your fault that I lost today
I only blame the choices that I made
It's not your fault that I lost today
I should have listened to what you had to say
They granted hope that I didn't have
Stripping my courage that I wanted to bad
Losing hope becomes so easy when no one's behind you at all
Long distance in front of you
Between thoughts you said you'll go through
You'll be ok
Do what you have to do

The journey of thousands of miles
Begins with a single step
Don't give it up
Begin to make changes in yourself
There is no one there but you,
Can't you tell?
Don't give it up
I know everything seems so strange
There's nothing normal in this day of age
Live loud

They granted hope that I didn't have
Stripping my courage that I wanted to bad
Losing hope becomes so easy when no one's behind you at all

I'm stuck in a room floating with my reflections
Spinning around in different directions
I'll scream this with my one last breath (one last breath)
The ones who care
Are the ones who listen

My heart has been ripped from my chest (from my chest)
I cannot feel or have intent (have intent)
My heart has been ripped from my chest
I'll let time heal me and I'll do the rest
Oh!

The journey of thousands of miles
Begins with a single step
Don't be afraid to live your life till the end
Be afraid that it will never begin
Don't give it up
Begin to make changes in yourself
There is no one there but you,
Can't you tell?
Don't give it up
I know everything seems so strange
There's nothing normal in this day of age

Of all the tongues that speak my name
Your smile speaks them louder
Your smile speaks them louder
Of all the tongues that speak my name
Your smile speaks them louder
Your smile speaks them louder

Just 'cause you see it
Fade in the final hour
It doesn't mean it
Never was at all
Just 'cause you see it
Fade in the final hour
Well it doesn't mean it
Was ever meant to fall
Just 'cause you see it
Fade in the final hour
It doesn't mean it
Never was at all
Just 'cause you see it
Fade in the final hour
Well it doesn't mean it
Was ever meant to fall...
