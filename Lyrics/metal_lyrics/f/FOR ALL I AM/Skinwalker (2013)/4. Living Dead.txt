Collapse dead again
Another night we'd like to forget
So sorry for your pain
But it's the choice you made
Know you will never be my downfall

Out like a light sleep so peacefully
Feels so familiar no need to panic
A coward's life lies with the easy route out
Lay low in the arms of the charmers
A false caress of care
You know it all too well
But I know there's a way out

When all is lost I'll be the guiding light
The tides can turn I see hope in sight
I will never let them pull you under

When all is lost I'll be the guiding light
There's a horizon still shining bright
Don't let the charmers pull you under
I will never let them pull you under

A drifter's eye sifting through the static
Where do you call home when you feel alone?
A fractured mind scarred and scared to die
Oh brother help me find my place in time

I see the weakness your guilt is my crutch
Don't be the victim you can save yourself
I'm by your side but I will not stand by
And watch you let yourself die

You know it all too well but I know there's a way out
When all is lost I'll be the guiding light
The tides can turn I see hope in sight
I will never let them pull you under

When all is lost I'll be the guiding light
There's a horizon still shining bright
Don't let the charmers pull you under
I will never let them pull you under

The drifter's eye sifting through the static
Where do you call home when you feel alone?
A fractured mind scarred and scared to die
Oh brother help me find my place in time

When all is lost...
When all is lost...

Save yourself
Don't be the victim
You can save yourself
Don't be the victim
You can save yourself
