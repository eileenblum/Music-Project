I'm out of breath, nothing's left inside my chest
We're out of time
And if I could rewind it, I wouldn't mind it
Because a life of regret is not worth living anyway

We only get one shot
Let's take a chance, give it our all
And one for nothing (one for nothing)
We're only young once
Let's make mistakes, make some noise
And make history

You can't hold us back
Raise hell! Raise hell!
I feel alive, the chance of a lifetime
Raise hell! Raise hell!
So alive you can't hold us back

This is the time to attack
Don't count me out or you can count your doubts
And I've seen the space between dreams and reality
And I won't go back
A world so empty
Do you see purpose in complacency or do you feel your failure

I'm out of breath, nothing's left inside my chest
We're out of time
And if I could rewind it, I wouldn't mind it
Because a life of regret is not worth living anyway

We'll make history, we'll make history
I'm wandering through the space in between dreams and reality
It's tearing my mind apart at the seams
A struggle with what I believe

I'm at war, covered in blood and sweat
I'm at war, with a demon inside my head
I'm at war, with a lifetime of regret
But I'll fight back, this is my time to attack
Fight back!
This is your time to attack

Show no love for the enemy
Just animosity for the respect they lack
Erase the past mistakes that'll break me
Break through the walls that haunt me back

I'm out of breath, nothing's left inside my chest
We're out of time
And if I could rewind it, I wouldn't mind it
Because a life of regret is not worth living anyway

Learn from yesterday, live for today
There's hope for tomorrow
The dawn of a new day
Learn from yesterday, live for today
There's hope for tomorrow
The dawn of a new day
We'll make history
