Have I been awake
Consciously designing ways
To get me to a better place
Or was I in a daze?
And weeks slip away and then repeat
If it's so, then wake me up
Wake me up

Have I walked along
The path I swore I'd walk upon
Or have I somehow led myself astray
Or was I in a daze?
And weeks fade away with memories
Before I'm old with nothing left to love
Wake me up
And pull me from
The fog that's keeping me numb
Wake me up
'Cause I've become
Comfortable with feeling nothing
Waste away and vanish in the flood

Have I been awake
Consciously designing ways
To get me to a better place
Or was I in a daze?

Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
