Now that you're resting in the sky.
I wish we had our goodbyes.
The sun shined like another day
You had no voice, cold, nothing to say.

I wish it was a nightmare that had no means.
Wishing everything wasn't what it seemed.
I know that this world, may seem so dark.
The ones that you loved, seemed to just tear you apart.

We were the ones to blame, but these times will not be the same.
We were the ones to blame, this life can not be exchanged.
I just wish that you would've stayed.
Now that you're gone.
These are now the empty days.

What went wrong?
Why did you have to go this way? 
I know the world may seem so dark, 
And the ones that you loved, seemed to tear us apart.

They seem to tear us apart.
But we can get through this.
Our memories are my remedies.

Why did you go this way?
I just wish that you would've stayed.
It will never be the same.
Will never be the same again.
Will never be the same.

I'll always be there right by your side.
