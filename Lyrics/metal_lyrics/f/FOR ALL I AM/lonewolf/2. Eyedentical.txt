I'm not allowed to
Speak a word
Your existence is a hidden disease
Flies like a bird
And it stands so tall.

What do I earn? When does this paranoia turn? What do I earn? What do I earn? [x2]

Our feelings don't exist in our hearts.
And our minds will feel like they died so long ago.
Our feelings can no longer exist in our hearts anymore.
And they died so long ago
They died so long ago [x2]
I look harder in every way.
I will never see you.
I will always see you.

AND OUR MINDS THEY DIED SO LONG AGO

Our feelings can no longer exist in our hearts anymore.
I wish I could destroy you [x5]
