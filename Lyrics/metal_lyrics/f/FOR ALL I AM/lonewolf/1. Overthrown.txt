The day you threw your heart straight at me.
My mind was gone.
Not so dark, that I could not see.
I beg the sun.

I will never remember, the days you put me to shame.
The days that we remember are the days you played your games.
Friends, is what you want.
We're just not the same.
What do you want?
Just get out of my face.

[Chorus:]
I will never be the same again.
Don't let this go, Iâm holding on.
The days that we felt the same.
What was once so close, has become so far away.

You clenched your fist, and carried the blame.
My mind was ready for a war that screamed my name.
I stood my ground because you had nothing to show.

You've gone insane, Just please go away.
You've lost your mind and soul, you're the same.

Flying planes around me, My mindâs here for war.
Flying planes around me.
My war

Our days are wasted away.
