I hope you're ready to embrace.
Because you can't hear a sound that I make.
I'll never be the one to tell you that.
Pity looks you in the face.
I hope you're ready to embrace.
Because you can't hear a sound that I make (That I make )
I know nothing but your ignorance 
I don't even think you know me.

[Chorus:]
You were my friend since day one.
When the days were all about fun.
As life begins to make us part, you act like you were blind from the start.
I will be the one to see you break.
You tore me up with the insult and lies.
I hope a day comes where you realize
That this is a part of my life. ( Real life )

I guess one day we'll find out whose to stay , or whose to fly ? ( or whose to fly ? )
And when your walls begin to crumble
I'll be the one to step back
And you've begun to dig your own holes
There's no way back out

Youâve dug your holes and you can't get out
