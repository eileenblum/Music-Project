Just she had a way,
when they found a dead-end.
Just they try to say,
when there is no way.

In you they can't trust,
when your advices were lies.
In things they can't touch,
keeping close till their death

Should they just forget,
keeping close till their farewell?
Should they feel the fear,
when their chance is far away?
Just they could give up
when the pressure came up

They burn, gasoline.
They cry, tragedy,
when their old heaven is dead
They feel, gasoline.
They trust...
Memories...
Where's their heaven now?
Just see her eyes...
When their freedom died
