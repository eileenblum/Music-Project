In 1817, a courting couple
by the sea.
He promised her
he would return.
While the time won the battle.
His lips caressed her skin,
when tomorrow
they'll say good bye.
She closed her sweet eyes,
but he wasn't there.
I
n 1817, that sea,
which united us,
separated us.

In 1870, an old woman
cried at the beach.
She was waiting
for that sea,
returned her lover
once again.
The children shouted crazy
at her.
She wore a wedding dress,
when she threw herself
into the water.

The legend tells that night,
people saw two lovers
dancing at the sea between
foam and coral
