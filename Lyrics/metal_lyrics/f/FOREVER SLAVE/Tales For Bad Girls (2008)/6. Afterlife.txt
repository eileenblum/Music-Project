No more blame,
if everyday promises died again.
No more prays,

if everyday our game's the same.
I need your warm close to me
I wanna dream to night as well
Should we have chosen, once again,
another final?
You need my hand close to you.
You wanna listen my silence again.
Should we have chosen our losing dreams
or another fantasy?

Oh oh ooh ooh oh oh
Waiting the time of our end.

Don't miss my words,
if daylight is getting close.
Don't take my love,
if everyday you must go

Don't miss the voice
We will be close
Don't be ashamed
or we will be lost
