The breeze of her freedom
(She loved by mistake)
Kissing her dreams
He took her wisdom
She loved him in the afterlife
And he took her life
She loved by mistake, and now she must die.

Kristin AIDS, in a bed spends her time
Kristin's eyes swallow her last sweet tears
Nobody cares her ( in her sorrow )
Alone, she cries ( in the dark )
Kristin AIDS, she dreamt of escaping

She felt her life
She loved by mistake,
and now she must die
She lost her friends
She loved by mistake,
and now she must die

The things she lost in a dream
which left her, alone
She loved by mistake,
and now she must die
In her funeral. Only two girls asked:
who was she? Nobody knew the answer.
Don't try to find her
