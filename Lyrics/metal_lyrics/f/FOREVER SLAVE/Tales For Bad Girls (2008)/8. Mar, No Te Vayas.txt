The end of a song.
You want to make ( your last effort )
Leaves fall off
you go for that street,
Without knowing your way.

Before she dies,
she gave a box
with her last kiss.
He lost his dreams
he would keep it.
He wanted that kiss

Mar, come back to me I can't live
it doesn't make sense
Mar, I wrote something
for you our last night
before you die
Mar, I want to die
I can't live
I miss your voice

You feel alone,
you are strong,
but there's nothing wrong.
They don't understand
you wear dark clothes
or die for her.
He feels so empty
when he looks at her grave
The rain blurs his tears.
She was so far from him
There were many things
that he never said to her
He opened the box
and she gave her last kiss.

Mar, come back to me I can't live
it doesn't make sense
Mar, I wrote something
for you our last night
before you die
Mar, no te vayas
vuelve conmigo
Te pido que no te vayas
Mar, vuelve a mi
quiero morir
LlorÃ© en su tumba
