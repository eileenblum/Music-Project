Do you need to be yourself?
Don't you want to understand it?
Did you round your story out
by yourself?
At Night the phone rings ( I listened )
a sweet voice whispers his name
His face changes and he goes out
he follows a dream
While I'm on my own

And I expected to go on

Our Story
I remember it in my dreams
(I'm a dreamer)
I missed someone
There was no one
I can't understand it

At school I seek your glance
(I get it)
Without you the world is different
I thought about a new life
or my suicide
There's no solution
