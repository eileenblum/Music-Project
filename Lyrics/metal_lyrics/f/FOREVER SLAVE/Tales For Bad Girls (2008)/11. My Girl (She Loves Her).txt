Summer is at an end
The sorrow was
in their hearts
Thousands of promises
When they were separated

Time is too slow
When you're not close to me
We'll never forget,
my love, that summer

My girl. You're my girl
Too late, it's too late
When I'll be able to look
at those eyes

I said, as we said
Too late, It's too late
I'm looking forward to
feeling your lips

I don't believe you
I want you to explain me
I need to know everything

I don't believe you
I want you to explain me
I need to know everything

I go for a walk
And I see her all the time
Some friends told me that
they saw her with a girl

We were two souls
And we loved each other
But you forgot your promises
