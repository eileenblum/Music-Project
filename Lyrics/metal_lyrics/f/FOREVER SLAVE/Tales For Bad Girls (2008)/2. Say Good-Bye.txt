From your dark side to the eternity
There's only a way
And it's close to you
Choose your cards
And play your aces
It's not a guessing game.

Say goodbye,
When your bones become dust
And your soul doesn't find a reason for lust.

Say goodbye,
When your body's plenty of bugs
And you know what is the meaning of distrust.
From the other side to our absurdities
"From your dark side to our absurdities
There's only a word
I'm not near you"
Try Understanding
Why you never said to her
You lost this guessing game.
Now I watch the life from my tomb
You sometimes, cry on my grave.
Keep on pretending that is all right
my life is destroyed again.

From your dark side to the eternity
There's only a way
And it's close to you
Choose your cards
And play your aces
It's not a guessing game.
