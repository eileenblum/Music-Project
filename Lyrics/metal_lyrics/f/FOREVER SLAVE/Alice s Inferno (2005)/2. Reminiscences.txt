And obedient to Commands
Thine eyes impose on me
Caressed by thine scathing hands
I fall, one more, for thee
In storm and in darkness
I found delight... sentenced

Slave Forever
Entralled by the dew of blood
That comes out with every lash

Slave Forever
I drown in this torture flood
In this secret stash

I vanish out of sight,
Into nothingness...
I shall be fhy slave forever
