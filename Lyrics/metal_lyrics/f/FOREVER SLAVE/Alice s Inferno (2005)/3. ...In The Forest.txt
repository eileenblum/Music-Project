Your dark kingdom come
Nymphs protect this world
Over the stormwood waits
The light is far,
The rain doesn't stop
My solitude is near

Nymphs start to sing to me
They whisper to me my name

Don't stop, Alice, this symphony!
Don't tell my name nevermore

Maybe you leave for this long way
There is a way to a second Hell
