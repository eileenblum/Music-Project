You'll never feel
my blood again
For you this means
the end of all
your sorrows

Your eternal life,
the end of your tears
and when the sunrise
starts to appear ,
you will be gone
When daylight dies,
velvet night will be my guardian
to shelter my immortal soul

[Death's souls:]
Erzebet sits close to her
she starts to lick her breasts
Then lust and blood
begin to become one
With whispers of death

[Countess:]
When lust and blood
begin to become one
With whispers of death
fire will burn her soul out

[Ophelia:]
Lilith's daughter,
you can't steal my soul

[Priest:]
She loves Satan...With whispers
of death...She mentions his name

[She enjoys the rippling of blood and sings:]
Hail Satan
