[Music:P.Lund/T.WÃ¤ppling,Lyrics:T.WÃ¤ppling]

They came on a cold winters night 
When the land was dressed in snow and ice
Through a frozen landscape with snowcovered trees
On horses as black as the darkest of night

Ride with the wind,children of the night

But something was different the stars didn't shine
A long time had passed since they left their land
Once so beautiful now such barren and cold
"God why didn't you see"

They had been gone for so many years
Now the landscape was dead and the birds didn't sing
They looked at the sky once so alive
Children of the stars,daughters of the moon

Blood must flow to pay this crime
The hunt will go on 'til the end of time
Ride with the wind o,children of the night
Judgementday has come

They came on a cold winters night 
When the land was dressed in snow and ice
Through a frozen landscape with snowcovered trees
On horses as black as the darkest of night

Ride with the wind,children of the night

But something was different the stars didn't shine
A long time had passed since they left their land
Once so beautiful now such barren and cold
"God why didn't you see"

They had been gone for so many years
Now the landscape was dead and the birds didn't sing
They looked at the sky once so alive
Children of the stars,daughters of the moon

[Solo:P.Lund]

Blood must flow to pay this crime
The hunt will go on 'til the end of time
Ride with the wind o,children of the night
Judgementday has come

They had been gone for so many years
Now the landscape was dead and the birds didn't sing

Blood must flow to pay this crime
The hunt will go on 'til the end of time
Ride with the wind o,children of the night
Judgementday has come
Blood must flow to pay this crime
The hunt will go on 'til the end of time
Ride with the wind o,children of the night
Judgementday has come
