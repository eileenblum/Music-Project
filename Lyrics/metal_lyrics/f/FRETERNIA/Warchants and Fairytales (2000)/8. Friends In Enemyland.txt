[Music:P.Lund/T.WÃ¤ppling,Lyrics:T.WÃ¤ppling]

From the bottom of a river,a ring was brought to our world
A beautiful thing the masterring,invisible it lets you 
through
The shadows call his name,in greed he killed his friend
But things are easily lost and found by another hand
There riddles bought him time,to escape the horrible depths
Now several years have passed,the ring has caused a war

In darkness they move,into deepest woods
Two friends in enemyland
On mountain high,through valley low
To destroy the masterring
In darkness they move,into deepest woods
Two friends in enemyland
On mountain high,through valley low
To destroy the masterring

All alone on their way to Mordor,home of the shadows,where 
no light reach

Two friends in enemyland,behind the enemylines
They know not of the danger ahead or where this adventure 
will end
The shadows call his name,in greed he killed his friend
Two friends so far from home,to destroy the masterring
They do not know which way to go or what stranger to trust
He cannot bear the shame,now in darkness he dwells

In darkness they move,into deepest woods
Two friends in enemyland
On mountain high,through valley low
To destroy the masterring
In darkness they move,into deepest woods
Two friends in enemyland
On mountain high,through valley low
To destroy the masterring

Alone in the night on a narrow path,the eyes of the night 
shine red
He pray for someone to show him a sign
With darkness ahead and evil behind,on a mission to save 
the world
Alone in the night he whisper.......I must be strong

[Solo:P.Lund]

In darkness they move,into deepest woods
Two friends in enemyland
On mountain high,through valley low
To destroy the masterring
In darkness they move,into deepest woods
Two friends in enemyland
On mountain high,through valley low
To destroy the masterring
