[Music:P.Lund/T.WÃ¤ppling,Lyrics:T.WÃ¤ppling]

There is a place between the trees
Where beauty rules through peace
Here people live in harmony
With nature and its beings

A landscape such beautiful
A handful have seen
Wonderful songs do tell of this place
Where freedom calls

This is the border to where tales often begin
And I am the guardian in the woods of the elvenking

There lives a tribe in deepest woods
In the crowns of the trees they sing
O,so proud that they never will die
And the story may go on

A people such beautiful
A handful have seen
Wonderful songs do tell of them
The tribe of the elvenking

This is the border to where tales often begin
And I am the guardian in the woods of the elvenking

I hear songs from the crowns of the trees
That says-Don't be afraid
Step out of the shadows and enter our world
Set your mind free,release your heart

Here everyone's free what you see is for real
The trees are our homes the sky is our roof
You're the chosen one to guard our land
Its borders stretches endlessly wide

[Solo:P.Lund]

This is the border to where tales often begin
And I am the guardian in the woods of the elvenking
This is the border to where tales often begin
And I am the guardian in the woods of the elvenking
