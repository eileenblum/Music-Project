[Music:P.Lund,Lyrics:T.WÃ¤ppling]

In every heart a burning desire
a vision of dreams to come true
As the colours take shape,a picture appear
and it touches your mind and soul

We know what we are,but not what to be
We all are standing tall
We are loud and proud 'cause we live out the dream
Or else the flame might die

Reach for the skies it will open for you
aim for the stars and you'll land on the clouds
Your dream is alive and this vision's for real
This castle is yours and it's magic for sure

In every heart a burning desire
a vision of dreams to come true
As the colours take shape,a picture appear
and it touches your mind and soul
Reach for the skies it will open for you
aim for the stars and you'll land on the clouds
Your dream is alive and this vision's for real
This castle is yours and it's magic for sure

We know what we are,but not what to be
We all are standing tall
We are loud and proud 'cause we live out the dream
Or else the flame might die

[Solo:P.Lund]

Don't let it fade,the glow you keep inside
The dreams and desires that burn within
Just spread your wings and fly
Open your eyes let your senses flow free
Breathe in the air and sail the skies
The taste of victory
