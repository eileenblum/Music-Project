[Music:P.Lund,Lyrics:T.WÃ¤ppling]

A beautiful land so mighty and proud
A new time will come a king has been born
As the years have passed and the boy grown strong
It's finally time to enter his throne

And so the legend told
That in this land blood will flow
And the king will loose his crown
To the dark and evil one

The shadows have reached across our borders
Now brother and sister stand up and fight
The legions of darkness have come to our land
The darklord is here to steal our crown

[Solo:P.Lund]

And so the legend told
That in this land blood will flow
And the king will loose his crown
To the dark and evil one

The war of the crown
Where time stand still
A land in peace
Will now go to war
The war of the crown
Where time stand still
A land in peace
Will now go to war

The shadows have reached across our borders
Now brother and sister stand up and fight
The legions of darkness have come to our land
The darklord is here to steal our crown

The war of the crown
Where time stand still
A land in peace
Will now go to war
The war of the crown
Where time stand still
A land in peace
Will now go to war
