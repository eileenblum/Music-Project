[Music:T.WÃ¤ppling/P.Lund,Lyrics:T.WÃ¤ppling]

Ocean deep,she sail to tame the raging sea
A beauty of iron and wood across the waves so noble and 
proud
But she wear the deadly mark,the kiss of death that bring 
you down
When the moonlight kiss the surface in the calm before the 
storm

She sail so proud-across the seven seas
As dark as the night-her mind is set to kill

She sail with pride
With wind in her sails
Through dark deep oceans
Starlit nights
With glory and might
Winds blow so strong
And it whispers in her ear
"Mistress of the deep black sea,
I'll take you where you wish"

Distant echoes closing in,soon the battle will begin
To flee is the only way to escape her deadly fire
The sound of thundering guns,break the silence of the night
With fire in her eyes,she hunt the enemies on the run

To distant shores-with fire and steel
A godess of war-a deadly charming beast

[Solo:P.Lund]

She sail with pride
With wind in her sails
Through dark deep oceans
Starlit nights
With glory and might
Winds blow so strong
And it whispers in her ear
"Mistress of the deep black sea,
I'll take you where you wish"

Ocean deep,she sail to tame the raging sea
A beauty of iron and wood across the waves so noble and 
proud
But she wear the deadly mark,the kiss of death that bring 
you down
When the moonlight kiss the surface in the calm before the 
storm

She sail so proud-across the seven seas
As dark as the night-her mind is set to kill
