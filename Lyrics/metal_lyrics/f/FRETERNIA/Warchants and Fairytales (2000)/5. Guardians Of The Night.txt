[Music:T.WÃ¤ppling/P.Lund,Lyrics:T.WÃ¤ppling]

We all are one united we stand today and forever our 
hearts are made of steel
Come take our hands,we'll show you a land
Where in the sky the dragons fly,so strong,so proud,so free

Gods of war o,bless us with might
Into the night we ride
On the back of my horse,holding tight to my steel
The shadows seems so unreal

Into the night with glory we ride
Awaiting the right time to strike
For the king and the crown we defend our land
We're the guardians of the night
Into the night with glory we ride
Awaiting the right time to strike
For the king and the crown we defend our land
We're the guardians of the night

We all are one united we stand, 
our hearts are made of steel
Come take our hands we'll show you 
a land where in the sky the dragons fly
We're warriors of steel with power and might
In armour of gold we stand up and fight
For the king and the crown,we defend our land

We all are one united we stand today and forever our 
hearts are made of steel
Come take our hands,we'll show you a land
Where in the sky the dragons fly,so strong,so proud,so free

[Solo:P.Lund]

Gods of war o,bless us with might
Into the night we ride
On the back of my horse,holding tight to my steel
The shadows seems so unreal

Into the night with glory we ride
Awaiting the right time to strike
For the king and the crown we defend our land
We're the guardians of the night
Into the night with glory we ride
Awaiting the right time to strike
For the king and the crown we defend our land
We're the guardians of the night
