[Music:Freternia,Lyrics:T.WÃ¤ppling]

The moon arise and dragons fly so proud
sometimes you see them
Fly so high with fire in their eyes
spreading their wings
They fly under starlit skies
throughout foreign lands
And the stars do shine
on a misty night

On wings of steel across the sky
and stars are sailing by
Friend of raven,born of fire
Sworn enemy of man

In elvenland on mountain high
they dwell in shelter of darkness
'Cause daylight burn the skin on their wings
at night the hunt begins
To search for gold and treasures of ancient empires
lord of the skies
The harvester,the almighty one
a god of smoke and fire

On wings of steel across the sky
and stars are sailing by
Friend of raven,born of fire
Sworn enemy of man

They fly under bloodred skies
and sail upon the winds
At night the hunt begins
And when the morning comes
The mountains call their name
'til darkness falls again

[Solo:P.Lund]

On wings of steel across the sky
and stars are sailing by
Friend of raven,born of fire
Sworn enemy of man
On wings of steel across the sky
and stars are sailing by
Friend of raven,born of fire
Sworn enemy of man
