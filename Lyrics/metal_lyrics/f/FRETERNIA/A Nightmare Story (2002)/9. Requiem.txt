[Music: Johansson/Freternia]
[Lyrics: Humppi/Wappling]

As darkness falls upon these lands, my heart &amp; soul is embraced
So cold as my glow slowly fades I can hear them singing my name once again
They are singing for me...

I spread my wings and fly into the unknown now I can see the light
And through the misty night where shadowcreatures dance I'm soaring high 
above
High above...

Reaching out for my friends one last time
Time to say goodbye heading for my afterlife
Leaving all the darkness behind
Time to say goodbye heading for my paradise

In this moment of death I am wondering why
Betrayed by the only one I thought was my friend
If I were the chosen then how come I failed
The stories they told was it just lies
It all seems so clear as two turns to one

My darkest fear has taken shape and turned into a heartless creature filled 
with hate
He entered the gate so long ago when evil got created, once again they will 
unite and turn to one

Reaching out for my friends one last time
Time to say goodbye heading for my afterlife
Leaving all the darkness behind
Time to say goodbye heading for my paradise

I spread my wings and fly into the unknown now I can see the light
And through the misty night where shadowcreatures dance I'm soaring high 
above

He spreads his wings and flies into the unknown towards the light
And through the clearest sky where eagles learn to fly he's soaring high 
above
He spreads his wings and flies into the unknown towards the light
And through the clearest sky where eagles learn to fly he's soaring high 
above
