[Music: Wappling/Freternia]
[Lyrics: Humppi/Wappling]

The dream keeps coming back
So clear but still confused
And It really makes no sense
Somebody tries to tell
About a world of dreams
And the gate that leads to this

The answer is hidden,exploring the maze of my mind
Finding my way, so frightened of what I might find
Now, the gate is open wide

Voices cry, beware you may not find the way out
You enter the world of Grimbor the great
"You will find that dreams might be so real you can die
This is the work of Grimbor the great"

This place so strange, fading lights
I cannnot tell if it's day or night
No signs of life, I'm all alone
But something here reminds me of home

It feels like I've been here before

Lost inside a world of dreams
Visions of the reality
How could this be it makes no sense
I am here but am I awake?

This place so strange to me
Feels like someone's watching me
My dream is becoming reality
Could I be the one, am I strong enough
To face the truth of my destiny?

The answer is hidden,exploring the maze of my mind
Finding my way, so frightened of what I might find
Now, the gate is open wide

Voices cry, beware you may not find the way out
You enter the world of Grimbor the great
"You will find that dreams might be so real you can die
This is the work of Grimbor the great"

Voices cry, beware you may not find the way out
You enter the world of Grimbor the great
"You will find that dreams might be so real you can die
This is the work of Grimbor the great"
