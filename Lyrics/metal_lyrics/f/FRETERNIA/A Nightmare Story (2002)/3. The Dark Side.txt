[Lyrics: Wappling]

I can see her now the smile upon her face
The shadows disappear as if they fear for their lives

You must follow me now - I will guide you on your way
I will follow your steps - Wherever you may go

Underneath a clouded sky we fly I'm so alive
Then I hear their voices once again they sing to me

Please don't go don't follow her voice
Inside your mind dwells the treasure you seek, that only you can reach

We get nearer but where are we really going?
The emptiness covers my sight
I can feel it the darkness slowly growing
The prescence of evil around

She's so beautiful her innocence and pride
As I stare into her darkblue eyes I'm slowly dying

She's a demon in disguise - Let the mirror tell you why
Do not enter the gate - The mirror speaks the truth

Underneath a clouded sky we fly I'm so alive
Then I hear their voices once again they sing to me

Please don't go don't follow her voice
Inside your mind dwells the treasure you seek, that only you can reach

I can see it now the grin upon his face
The shadows closing up there's no way out I'm gonna die

You must follow me now - I will guide you on your way
Do not enter the gate - The mirror speaks the truth

Underneath a clouded sky we fly I'm so alive
Then I hear their voices once again they sing to me

Welcome
This is where chaos begins
This is the Dark Side
One step and the madness reveals

Please don't go don't follow her voice
Inside your mind dwells the treasure you seek, that only you can reach
Please don't go don't follow her voice
Inside your mind dwells the treasure you seek, that only you can reach
