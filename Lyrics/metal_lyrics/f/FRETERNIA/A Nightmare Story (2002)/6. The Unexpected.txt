[Lyrics: Humppi/Wappling]

Don't be afraid I will guide you
I've faced the darkness before
Nobody knows what secrets I keep
I've seen before what you are about to meet

I crossed the river of hate I've felt the anger I've felt the pain
I have faced the darkness before once I thought I would never fail
You and me we are the same two of a kind destined to save
You have no choice you must go on where I have failed you must be strong

Fire a burning desire lives inside your heart
Higher it's taking you higher high above the clouds

Feel the fever of the evil as it's rising up tonight
Advices I can give will help you with the final fight
Over all the ages and places I've seen it took far to long to believe
Please remeber this world is paradise made for your dreams

So as the Darkness getting closer do you know the way to make it weak
Is your mind set up for the final fight.
I will stand by your side until it will time to fight
Search your mind and find your strenght the steel inside you was forged by 
the..

Fire a burning desire lives inside your heart
Higher it's taking you higher high above the clouds

Nobody knows who I am and what I seen
Noone can feel the things that I have felt across the time
Now beware for unexpected moves
In the final battle there will be no rules

I crossed the river of hate I've felt the anger I've felt the pain
I have faced the darkness before once I thought I would never fail
You and me we are the same two of a kind destined to save
You have no choice you must go on where I have failed you must be strong

Fire a burning desire lives inside your heart
Higher it's taking you higher high above the clouds
Fire a burning desire lives inside your heart
Higher it's taking you higher high above the clouds
