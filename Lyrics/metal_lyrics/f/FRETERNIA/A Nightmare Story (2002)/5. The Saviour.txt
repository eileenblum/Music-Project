[Lyrics: Wappling]

Another day is dawning the storm is drawing near
All that's left to face my myself, I must be insane
I can hear the echo of their laughters in my head
Now it's time to face the real me will I stand the test

The chosen one, the saviour for all
But can I save myself
Lost my belief in reality
Will this ever end

The wind has changed direction and skies are turning grey
Will this be the end of this world soon we all will know
I`m the chosen one to lead this people through this war
We march to fight the nightmare armies to stand or fall

The chosen one, the saviour for all
But can I save myself
Lost in my dream for eternity?
Only time can tell

"Time to fight it's time to survive
This is the only way out, it's a battle of minds"
Now my time has come my journey home begins
Defeat the evil one and the gate will open once again

It will open for you
It's the only way...
Remember you're...

...The chosen one, the saviour for all
Even for yourself
Lost in this dream for eternity?
Only you can save
The chosen one, a saviour for all
But can I save myself
Lost in my dream for eternity?
Only time can tell
