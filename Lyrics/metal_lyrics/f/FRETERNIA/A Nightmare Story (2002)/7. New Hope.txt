[Lyrics: Humppi]

The madness never seem to end
The sunset never looks the same again
The Evil one awaits to attack when the darkness falls
Maybe I am their saviour after all

Far away from light the shadowdancers smile
The legend of a hero will it come true

See our savior enter the darkness with no fear
See him disapear so far away from light
He is on the way to face the evil once again
This is his time a new hope in his mind

Seems like the end is near will the darkness dissapear
Thousands of dreams to fulfill awaiting the moment of truth

Something is watching
Living in darkness
Sence his cold eyes
Somewhere in the deep black woods

Cold dark memories from a distant time
A life in the real world is not meant for his kind

Possesing the knowledge of what he should do to find his way to the 
heartless ones
Spirits and souls from an ancient time protecting his mind revealing the 
lies
Where does it end will it be revealed for him to know
As time goes by the evil spirit will grow strong

Far away in the distant dream
A world is preparing to see

See our savior enter the darkness with no fear
See him dissapear so far away from light
He is on the way to face the evil once again
This is his time a new hope in his mind

Darkness around echoes of pain a wasteland of evil made shattered dreams
Noone makes sence a world full of lies the wisdom is gone I can not go on
Legend fortold of a man to be strong to destroy all the evil with one single 
punch
With a heart made of stone it could not go wrong but how often does 
fairytales come true?

Far away from light the shadowdancers smile
The legend of a hero will it come true

See our savior enter the darkness with no fear
See him dissapear so far away from light
He is on the way to face the evil once again
This is his time a new hope in his mind
The eldars fire burns of hope
Like a storm of wisdom they're watching the show
Grimbors treasure it all is on stake
The Final hour now the end is getting near
