[Lyrics: Wappling]

Let me out of this madness I'm loosing my will to live
I need sombody to tell me how to be strong and to carry on

Come with us to our land, a safe place to be
Come with us, just follow your heart and you'll live

Leave all fear behind you now
We are heading for Paradise

Here's no need for sorrow, here's no place for tears
We reign the night and we do as you wish
If you're afraid of darkness, this is the place to be
We are the Shadowdancers and we reign this world

Will you help me fulfill this mission that lies ahead
Can evil be defeated and is there any chance to survive?

Come with us to our land, a safe place to be
Come with us, just follow your heart and you'll live

Leave all fear behind you now
We are heading for Paradise

Here's no need for sorrow, here's no place for tears
We reign the night and we do as you wish
If you're afraid of darkness, this is the place to be
We are the Shadowdancers and we reign this world

Come with us to our land, a safe place to be
Come with us, just follow your heart and you'll live

Leave all fear behind you now
We are heading for Paradise

Here's no need for sorrow, here's no place for tears
We reign the night and we do as you wish
If you're afraid of darkness, this is the place to be
We are the Shadowdancers and we reign this world
