[Lyrics: Humppi]

Standing in this shadowland
Not knowing where to go
A movement in this ancient world
A voice that whispers bright

Come with me follow my signs
I'll show you a beautiful thing
It will give you its power so find it now
And you will see almost everything

Find the mirror and the truth you'll see
It is time - time for you to belive
In your faith no more doubts
The hero has arrived

Finding the way the voices they call
My journey is long and hard
The hidden treasure i must find
I hear a voice that cries

Come with me follow my signs
I'll show you a beautiful thing
It will give you its power so find it now
And you will see almost everything

Find the mirror and the truth you'll see
It is time - time for you to belive
In your faith no more doubts
The hero has arrived

Now I feel its prescence so real
Before my eyes a portal appears
A portal to a sacred place
Where evil can't enter and fill it with hate

Entering the portal to fullfill my fate
They guarded the mirror since dawning of time
Up in the air an almighty shine
It drops in my hands the mirror is mine

Come with me follow my signs
I'll show you a beautiful thing
It will give you its power so find it now
And you will see almost everything

Find the mirror and the truth you'll see
It is time - time for you to belive
In your faith no more doubts
The hero has arrived

Find the mirror / Have the mirror it's finally mine
It is time / The evil faces cannot hide
In your faith / The long lost tales they will come true
The hero has arrived
