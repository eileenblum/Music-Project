I feel a strange desire
When I gaze at the sky
I want to rule with fire
Until the day, day I'll die - The day I'll die

Riding the wings of light
Dreaming dreams and holding tight
Let the music take you high
Can you hear our battle cry ?

Metal will rise - Metal survives - Metal !
Hold your ground and feel the sound
Steel avengers - Metal headbangers
Raise your fist - Be sure, we exist
Metal warriors ! In hell we are kings !

We won't let you down
We will fight at your sfde
We will make the sound
And fight for our precious pride

Metal will rise - Metal survives - Metal !
Hold your ground and feel the sound
Steel avengers - Metal headbangers
Raise your fist - Be sure, we exist
Metal warriors ! In hell we are kings !

Metal will rise - Metal survives - Metal !
Hold your ground and feel the sound
Steel avengers - Metal headbangers
Raise your fist - Be sure, we exist
Metal warriors ! In hell we are kings !
