Scientific genius, long lost in time
Dreaming in eternity, learning how to fly
Functions of the body, aand things no one has seen
Knowledge of everything, that was his dream

No one believed him, they say he was a dreamer
Never a hero, but no one can deny
Mysterious, he opened all the doors
Of secrets we never imagined
Victorious, to solve the mysteries
Of secrets-unknown, the smile of the one
Mona Lisa

Designing weapons for war he abhorred
Led by science - And not by the lord
Nature and anatomy, that's what he paints
Mesmerized by that smile
What's behind that face ?

No one believed him, they say he was a dreamer
Never a hero, but no one can deny
Mysterious, he opened all the doors
Of secrets we never imagined
Victorious, to solve the mysteries
Of secrets-unknown, the smile of the one
Mona Lisa
