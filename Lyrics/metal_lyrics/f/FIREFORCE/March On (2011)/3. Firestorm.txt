Flying - Weâre on our way
With our deadly gear
Seeking - For hostile fighters
Trying to stop us here

Knowing - Women and children
Are hiding there below
Waiting - To see our explosions
Hell, what a show

Flares are showing up
We're on our way... And we will run...

Firestorm !
To the firestorm
Bombing their homes with fear in our eyes
Firestorm !
The agony - of this hit city
Can be felt right up here
Burned to death - or suffocated
No one can live down there

Flares are showing up
We're on our way... And we will run...

Firestorm !
To the firestorm
Bombing their homes with fear in our eyes
Firestorm !

We seem - To fly for hours
Over a sheet of fire
Bombers - No strategic
"Aiming point required"

Fire ! - To the firestorm !
