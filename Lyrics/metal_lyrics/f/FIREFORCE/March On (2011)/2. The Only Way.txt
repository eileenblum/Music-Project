No way to escape this fate
No one wants to see the truth
Never will be saved from this hell
Screaming in the night
Darkness kills the light
Nobody believes what I tell

Hiding in a shell of hate
Raised on drugs and crime
Crying in myself it's better to die
Somewhere is a better place
But it's not meant for me
Why can't you hear my cries ?

The evil makes me dwell
And is sending me to hell
I try - I try to...
Escape the voices in my head
You rape, the spirit of my life
The pain... The evil's coming back
Escape... Vou send me back to black... Again...

Practice what you preach
Open your eyes for this atrocities
Don't let it happen to me
After all I'm just a child
Shelter me and hold me tight
Falling down and set me free...

The evil makes me dwell
And is sending me to hell
I try - I try to...
Escape the voices in my head
You rape, the spirit of my life
The pain... The evil's coming back
Escape... You send me back to black !

Escape the voices in my head
You rape, the spirit of my life
The pain... The evil's coming back
Escape... You send me back to black... Again...
