We are fighting for freedom and count
Here in Flanders bloody fields
Full of anger our battlecry sounds
Servants holding our shields

Out of arrows retreat to the lines
Between brooks and moors
French knights are going to charge
Endless sounds of war

The wall doesn't break up - Flemish hold the line
French army declines
The bodies of the slaughtered - lying all around
Golden spurs are found

Freedom - Flanders is free
Freedom - Invaders will flee
Freedom - The lion roars
Freedom - Out in the war

Merciless pounding on knights and men
Who are stuck in the line
"Goejendags" doing their job
Holding our banner high

The wall doesn't break up - Flemish hold the line
French army declines
The bodies of the slaughtered - Lying all around
Golden spurs are found

Freedom - Flanders is free
Freedom - Invaders will flee
Freedom - The lion roars
Freedom - Out in the war

Closely packed, eight rows deep
We are killing the knights
"Viaendren de leeuw"
Unite and we will survive - Hail !

Freedom - Flanders is free
Freedom - Invaders will flee
Freedom - The lion roars
Freedom - Out in the war
Freedom - The lion roars
