I was born to Isis
Ready to rule - Behold !
More a king than my brother
That's what my mother told

Osiris, my father, was murdered by Seth
Envy had burned his soul
Hacking his body to bits with hate
Ruling the kingdom his fate

Horus - Justice should triumph
Horus - Give him his throne
Horus - Lord of the Earth
Horus - Give him your death

The council of gods gave power to me
Seth lost his crown
Fight for my right - ready to strike
Trying to bring me down

Isis was there by my side
Still I've lost my eyes
Hathor, losing my hand
Summon my seed - Seth lies !

Horus - Justice should triumph
Horus - Give him his throne
Horus - Lord of the Earth
Horus - Give him your death

Please, let reason prevail
Eighty years of war
Winning battles a thousand times
I can take it no more

The battle goes on, here on the Nile
Sinking ships of stone
Osiris ! The gods agreed
Give him his throne !

Horus - Justice should triumph
Horus - Give him his throne
Horus - Lord of the Earth
Horus - Give him your death
