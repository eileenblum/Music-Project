Achieving his war-aims, invading France
Edward was ready to fight
Men-at-arms, spearmen and archers
Fighting the armoured knights

Strongly defensive positions they hold
Defended by ditches and pits
The English archers strike down the French
Every arrow hits

Fly arrow, fly through the sky - And kill
Fly arrow, right through the sky - And take a life

Waving banners, chivalry rides
Plated armour will rise
The Englishmen stood still
And watched the nobles cry

Fly arrow, fly through the sky - And kill
Fly arrow, right through the sky - And take a life

Twelve thousand lying dead
Crushed by longbowmen
Prisoners and wounded knights
They're falling one by one

Fly arrow, fly through the sky - And kill
Fly arrow, right through the sky - And take a life
Fly arrow, fly through the sky - And kill
Fly arrow, fly through the sky - And kill
Fly - Kill / Kill - Through the sky
