Bangin' and screaming
You know the meaning,
Metal is in our minds
Here on the stage
Playing with rage,
Only the true survive

Waves of power
Steel every hour, if you don't like it
What the hell !
A real Metal man
You know that I am,
Are you ready to - Wreck your neck ?

Born to play Metal!
Born to play Metal!

Fighting for years
Too much tears,
Believing in what we do
Metal 'till death
That's what you'll get,
All our dreams will come true

Thanks to you all
We'll rise and wonât fall,
This a true Metal story
Raise your beers,
Hail and cheers,
We drink to your Metal glory

Born to play Metal!
Born to play Metal!

Hear us cry !
Come on our Metal ride !
Our destiny
Standing by your side!

Bangin' and screaming
You know the meaning,
Metal is in our minds
Here on the stage
Playing with rage,
Only the true survive

Thundering sounds
Pounding the grounds,
Flashes of light in your brain
Hard as a rock
We'll never stop, let's go insane

Born to play Metal !
Born to play Metal !

Metal !
Born to play...
I am...
Are you... ?
Metal !
