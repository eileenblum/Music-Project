Merciless behaviour to those who rise
No one will survive
Overrun by the legions pillaging the land
Retaliate or be enslaved - live your life

Beat back the legions, the evil one
And Rome must fall
If we surrender, wife's and kids will die
No more freedom - We'll rise

Annihilation
Be killed or live as a slave
Annihilation
You better die as a brave

Facing the enemy, unify !
Victorious or die
Engaging the Romans - We fight !
No more treaties - Waging war
