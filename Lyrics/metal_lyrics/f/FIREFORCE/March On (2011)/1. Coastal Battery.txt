Me and my commanders are staring at the sea
Waiting for my enemy - We're fighting to be free
In our concrete shelters, safe for their guns
We are the warriors, we are the Reich's sons

In the misty morning - Their ships arrive
Atlantic Wall - Ready to survive

Coastal Battery
Fire ! Fire !
Coastal Battery
Coastal Battery
Fire ! Fire !
Coastal Battery
No retreat! No defeat!

We are aiming and hold them at the beach
Our shells are howling when the target's reached
The shield of Europe will hold and never break
Fire at will, our freedom is at stake

In the misty morning - Their ships arrive
Atlantic Wall - Ready to survive

Coastal Battery
Fire ! Fire !
Coastal Battery
Coastal Battery
Fire ! Fire !
Coastal Battery
No retreat! No defeat!

Fire - Fire !
