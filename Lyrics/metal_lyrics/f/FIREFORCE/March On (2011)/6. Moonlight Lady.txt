Dark moon is rising high
Time has come to bid the past goodbye
Face a new bom year
Nature survives without fears

Worship the sun and the midnight sky
The moon is full and you feel alive
Lonely lady of the night
Look deep in your mind

Witching hour is near
Why do people live in fear ?

Hare moon of April waxes full
Time to dance the round
In your heart you feel the love
Nature's power all around

Witching hour is near
Why do people live in fear ?

Under the silver moon... You dance the rites
Seek harmony... Balance the light
Cast the circle... Blood moon arrives
Ask understanding... For what lives and who dies...

Witching hour is near
Why do people live in fear ?
