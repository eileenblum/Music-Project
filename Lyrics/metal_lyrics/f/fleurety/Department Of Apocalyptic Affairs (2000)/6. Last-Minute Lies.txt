vexed with wires and curled up like snakes 
we all without aim stumbled and staggered 
through the craters and pools 
that were oh so characteristic 
of the landscape on which 
we to our surprise discovered facial features. 

once I was given a bottle filled with sparkling anxiety. 
it did not quench my thirst. 
it became an unbecoming addiction. 
(and in an 
abbreviated manner one could say that in 
accordance to tradition we exhibit our 
addictions in the display window to 
affront possible bypassers and to arouse 
aggression and inertia.) 

someone cast himself into self-portrayal vainly 
hoping the result would accentuate the featurelessness of his face 
disappointed he swam in the low-budget luxuries that devour 
with omnivorous appetite would you lie for me I had a rusty nail 
hammered through my temple and I'm not sure if 
what I felt was pain let me introduce you to my friend the pain in-exile 
let me spray you with last-minute lies the screens oh so cleverly designed to banish 
boredom brought reports of an accident in the shooting gallery if 
I were a killer you would not have lived to know at the ends of one's arms 
there are instruments of destruction confusingly similar to hands the imperative 
of the evening is sever would you die for me would you spy for me thank you 
I've had enough now let me evaporate and join a less tedious cloud the delicacies 
that scorched the palate and made the tongue swell 

fresh from the machinery of the filth-factory: 
a malfunctioning device: COGITO. 
upon seeing it one shrieks, 
with jealousy intoxicated 
and with the almost 
theatrical obscenery appalled-angered. 
the crumbling the crumpling the collapsing 
mild and sour and misplaced 
as were the cherub's smiles. 
pornography has brought us 
where technology couldn't.
