he's got a whip-scarred centerfold 
in the trunk of his car 
pocket full of spices 
to go with the sore 
it's he who's got 
the crania and the remnants 
what would he have done 
if suffocation wasn't portable 
pages of the memory 
torn out disappeared 
as did the severed limbs 

buckshots conflagrated the arteries 
in a 210 bpm cardiac march 
a carcass of alcohol enraptures 
in a 60/40 combustion/evaporation
