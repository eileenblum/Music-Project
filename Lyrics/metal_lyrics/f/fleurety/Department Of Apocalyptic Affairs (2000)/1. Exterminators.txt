the meal reveals its identity 
the erotic turns erroneous 
insomniahours fevered with springtime 
magnetises even the bloodinshoe beauties 
an amusementbox invaccination 
the superb turns superflous 
and egoeccentric pencilcramps 
tornadoeye of undeserved attention 

department of apocalyptic affairs 
furnished with electric chairs 

the faked generosity of one instant 
the phallic turns fallacious 
blistered bindfoldeye curses 
the constant melvining of one's metabolism 
obscene obsession correct relief 
the call-girl turns carnivorous 
relentlessly spinning the litany 
we are born to be exterminators
