arrest me I talk in riddles 
I cause stress and muscular cramps 
nervous exaggeration after the toxictonic
telepathically broadcasts an appearance of one's own
one's been given a doppelganger 
who unlike oneself doesn't fake enthusiasms 

the shallshock of one instant 
and the indiscretionnovice unzips his fly 
he'll never know what hit him 
I know the detectives found 
the fingerprint of the universe
