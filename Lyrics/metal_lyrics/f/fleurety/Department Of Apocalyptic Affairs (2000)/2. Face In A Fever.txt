met up with my friend 
the sexist in exile 
on a tight leash 
he keeps the vermin 
that gave me the creeps 
together 'till the end 
us and whatever's addictive 
in a pair of tight jeans 
the gossamer latex that separated two bodies 

what we've got here 
is a face in a fever 
from the mouth comes the virus 
nothing's made cleaner

i've seen the one-track mind 
however just in profile 
he keeps a shocking feast 
leads his women to anxieties and sweets 
he is the iguana man 
always this repulsive 
always accompanied by screams 
he spits the virus at the one who sleeps 

what we've got here 
is a face in a fever 
From the mouth comes the virus 
nothing's made cleaner
