as in the fairytales the eerietales 
the scarytales the oh so weary tales 
there is a place where the outdated sweethearts go as in becoming one 
with the vicious whirlwind 
as in couldn't have cared less as in courting the barbwire smile as in where will 
that grinnygrin be when you're waltzing about in stenchdrench 
as in how could you be so careless as in watching 
the spleenscreen 
the snowscreen there's snow on my screen 
and it's the story of a lifetime as in there is a carnage 
where the dead darlings go as in i wouldn't i don't wanna' 
as in I'm not there as in another sphere 
as in not being a victim not a superstar 
as in as if
