the pain is neverending all the dreams have been 
deflowered the once lethal weapons are corroding 
quickly perfectly circular little men are dancing 
through the past the future is being touched by 
serpent fingers the streams float on countless choirs 
cry fadelessly a puzzle without pieces this fight is 
not against time it is against timelessness withering 
weeds have defeated the malformed lilies at dawn it 
all continues anew
