underneath the skin 
a glittering ocean 
the waves and the pulsating soil 
a spine bent into perverse angles 
projected on a screen 
a charming grimace 
i shot my thoughts at you 
dreading the recoil's impact 
the unrest of one instant and the amphorae were pulverized 
projected on a screen 
the imaginary silhouettes 
i plunged into the fountain's crystalline waters 
without dreading the clash with the surface 
you stole from me my riches and my tremors 
projected on a screen 
an anaemic body 
i threw the explosive caresses 
back at the smileress 
and they 
bounced
