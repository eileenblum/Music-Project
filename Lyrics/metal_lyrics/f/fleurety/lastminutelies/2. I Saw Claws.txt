blur sores that breed and crawl around on one's chest 
cracks and stains in a pattern 
of geometric impossibilities the ashes and the razors that 
tore one's hallucinations 
to shreds the clatter and the clamour melliflous as the 
nightingales' song 
oh where have I been where have I bled 
lungs filled with sulphur thrown open the doors that led to 
emptiness burned into 
the retina an image of the gossamer textiles that separated 
two bodies fantasies 
of sleep ricochets within a parralellogram 
oh where have I been where have I bled 
the art of contradiction 
of contraction of contortion of contusion of confusion of  
conclusion
