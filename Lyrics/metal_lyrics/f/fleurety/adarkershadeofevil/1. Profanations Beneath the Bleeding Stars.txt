I see in the horizon a land unknown to me
By the name of darkness
It appears in my mind
Captured by earthly existence
As I desperately long to get there
The woman in the sun
The woman above the moon
She tries to prevent me
But she will not stop me
Dragon show me your strength
Sky shrivels
Every star thrown to earth
Enter the gate
Burn the woman
And together we will burn the child
I stand in the forest
Guided by the dragon
Guided by the moon
The path I follow is covered in darkness
But blindly I follow
As I search for the place
Of my final breath
One day it will be found
And my body will rot
Under the light
Of another bleeding candle
And my spirit will forever dwell
Underneath the bleeding stars

About having no sense of direction.
Everything emerges from everywhere in a whirl of everyness.
No sense of anything, but that of continuity. One event follows another.
What is the connection between one event and the event immediatly following it?
Does the latter cuase the former?
For no reason, silence.
For no reason, sound.
And so the seasons pass by.
Christmas presents and venereal diseases
Distributed randomly over the world's population.
A voice that shatters glass such that
The sound of shattering glass is louder than the sound of the voice.
The voice is non-existent in space.
Like the cries of a bird that does not exist.

I stand in the forest
Guided by the dragon
Guided by the moon
From nowhere in nothing
Emerge the bleeding stars.
