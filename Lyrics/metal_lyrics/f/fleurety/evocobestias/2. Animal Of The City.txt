I made it myself
The animal of the city
While waiting for technology
Partially accomplished

I rode my car off the cliff
Contemplating the difference between &lt; and &lt;
Asking: What does this &lt; mean?
And, really, what does it mean to not give a fuck?

The person is not really interesting
But, really, I am a tolerant man
And it's getting darker, gloomier
We have our own brand of democracy around here

Today is a good day for dissecting God
We have a newly elected pirate
We're breaking the law
And we don't tolerate any fucking around
