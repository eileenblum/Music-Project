Black is the night
Cold is the wind
Cash in my pocket
This is my life

I summon the beasts
I give them instructions
You're looking for help
I have the solution

Performing surgery on your delusions
While the orchestra breathes overkill
You can't destroy the brains of those who have none
Strangled by the umbilical cord of morality

Kill in the streets
Death in the gallows
No job is too dirty
No price is too high

When everybody who ever lived is reborn
When human embarrassment is extinct
When planet earth is crucified
When the demons of hell rule the mafia
When mere existence damages beyond repair
When all is explanation and nothing else

I once again summon the beasts
