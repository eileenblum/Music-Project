The blade I wield slithers 
Like a serpent in my hand 
Yet bites not my enemy 
Ascending in spirals 
Cleanse me with the lustre of thine eyes 
The sand in the hour glass burns at both ends 
Maiden your name is desire 
Curse not yourselves, lest you will 
Not hear the disgustingly euphonious voices 
Let me sleep through this insomnia 
Kiss me with your crudely crafted spears
