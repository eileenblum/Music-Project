Violence covers the whole world
silicons are everything that matters anymore
morale corrupted, easily forgotten
and people keep waiting for more, always for more

And more, more, more!

Entertain!
We are the ones without a name
we are the ones without a shame
we are a product of industry
The clowns own industry

Macabre and comedy, is there difference?
sex sells and money rules all over the world
fists explain, tongues hurt
And clowns keep waiting for more, always for more

This world is getting raped again
and time goes in the hourglas
this world is burning again
and clowns only sit back
