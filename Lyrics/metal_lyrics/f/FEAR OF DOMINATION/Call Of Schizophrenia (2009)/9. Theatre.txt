I find my face from the dirt again
and see the audience cry
the show is over now
so be quiet right now

Everybody is a fucking whore
everybody plays a fucking role

We thank you now
when you kick us on the ground
and the blood comes out
we thank you now
when you kick us on the ground
and the god falls down
I never thought this was real
and everything I deared
was this theatre
and all the things I deared
and all the things I feared
was in this theatre

I raise my face from the dirt again
and see the audience smile
they need more still
so be quiet right now, gimme more!
