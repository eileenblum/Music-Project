I see all the faces, all the ugly faces
I'd like to kill them all, but not still hurt them all
I want to feel the knife inside, oh god dont hurt me now
what should I do when the voices tell me to lie

Time's running out, system's falling down
Time has run out, system will crash down

I'm lost in my room
Cant find my way out
it's all just a same
should I cry, should I smile
it's a schizophrenia, just a schizophrenia
voices in my head, cant make them stop
it's a schizophrenia, just a schizophrenia
who should I believe inside my mind?

I am waiting for something
waiting for the clarity
hope strangels to survive
war is our everyday life
but as time passes by
battle is lost, against time
what the hell should I do, when the voices tell me to die

Now all have been seen
all is said and done to me
nothing gives the satisfaction...
now the knife is inside, wounds are open wide
I open my head for you, so look inside

So here I am
here I make my final stand
in this world full of lies
so here I am
here where it all began
now I think I understand
there's nothing in here, nothing to hold near
so be right here
