Puppets of society
controlled, no souls
dominated by fear
ruled by few

Robots of society
numbered, no will
dominated by war
treated as a dog

What is real anymore?

When do we dare to say no?
FEAR OF DOMINATION!
Instruments of governments
TOYS OF MASTERS!

Living in a world of lies
things not to be told
what is real anymore
