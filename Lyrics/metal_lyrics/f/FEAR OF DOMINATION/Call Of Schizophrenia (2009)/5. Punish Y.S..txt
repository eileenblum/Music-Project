This ends here, lets face it
you've done it wrong, now embrace it
feel the pain, feel the shame
now we must die for our sins
I like to be right here, I love to see you here
Come here my dear, lets do it now
I love to be insane

Blood comes out, lets drink it
Lets taste the sin, so tastly
feel the pain, see the shame
now we must bring it all down
I like to be right here, I love to see you here
hit me please, will you do it now?
I like to be insane

PUNISH YOURSELF!
Clean it all off
PUNISH YOURSELF!
Give the body what it deserves
PUNISH YOURSELF!
Bring it all down
PUNISH YOURSELF!

See the stains, you made them
I must them clean them, so dirty
see the stain, feel the blame
I must clean them anyway
I like to be right here, I love to see you here
Come to me, lets face the sins
I love to be insane!

You want to see them falling
we want to see them crawling
you want to see them lying
we want to see them dying
so come here, enjoy the fear
when the time draws so near
it's time to go, but I want to show
the little secrets in my head

So dirty, dirty...
