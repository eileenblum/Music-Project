Talk, talk, talk, talk
Countless words yet still nothing more than curse
is talk all you do in your life?
I think I'm allergic to the lines your mouth spills
And to all the fucked up truth

White sheets for the dead
bullets for the living

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Only sexual control and domination
we are animals, we are the perfect people

Human is just an animal, with animal instincts
animal acts like a human, is like a human, lives like a man
so tell me who could be me
I want to find the inner me
I would like to be somebody
we are evolutions mistake

Suck, suck, suck, suck
Baby I'm not done, so gimme more
I want to feel to be somebody
we are the ugly ones, the ones who bring the filth to this world
the mistake in evolution

Lick, lick, lick, lick
You should wipe your own ass
That's not my work to do
I think I'm amused of the beauty of the world
It's fragile like ice
