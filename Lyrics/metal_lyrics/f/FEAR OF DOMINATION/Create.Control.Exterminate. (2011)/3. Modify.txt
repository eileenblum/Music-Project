Time to let them see
Time to let them see what you can be
So let me in...

Now it's time to see what they will say
Time to let them eat and devour their shame
All these frail limbs in my shell
I want to cut loose
And modify myself

Too many things and so little time
Too many pleasures to suck dry
For the sake of truth
They will see the news
And they will
And they will
Tell us the truth

Our life is just a comedy
That we want to call tragedy

Purify
We'll cleanse your mind
Modify
Time to make things right
Now they will see
What's really in me
We created something beautiful
So beautiful

Listen
They are screaming
They are calling for you
See them
They are rising
They are coming for you

So many victims
So many burned
So much pain
This really hurts
So you see them now
They are crawling tonight
They are silent
As always before

Look at me...
