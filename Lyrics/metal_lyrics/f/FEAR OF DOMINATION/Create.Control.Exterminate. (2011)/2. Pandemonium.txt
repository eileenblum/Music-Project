WHAT'S WRONG IN HERE
WE FEAST ON OTHERS MISERY
ALL HAIL IN THE NAME OF THE FLESH
IT'S LIKE ANIMAL INSTINCT

WHY... THEY ARE EATING US ALIVE
BUT WE DONT FEEL THE BITES
WE DEVOURED OUR OWN
PARADISE...

WHAT DO YOU FEAR?
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
WHAT DO YOU LOSE?
GIVE YOURSELF TO THE FEAR
PANDEMONIUM
WHAT DO YOU FEAR?
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
WE ARENT HUMANS
WORLD IS IN...
PANDEMONIUM

WHAT IS MY PLACE
DONT YOU KNOW IT YET?
WHO IS MY PREY?
ARE YOU HUNGRY AGAIN?
IS IT WRONG TO FEED
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?
TO MAKE MY HUNGER...
GO AWAY

LIFE EATS LIFE
WEAK DESERVES TO DIE
SO VIOLENT BUT YET SO
BEAUTIFUL...
