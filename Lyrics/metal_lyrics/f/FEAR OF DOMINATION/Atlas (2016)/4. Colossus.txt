here I stand tall my skin is pure gold
and it lights the lives of you petty men
I'm greater than a man I'm second to gods
And nothing can ever bring me down

the day of Colossus

even with all my fame
even with all my fortune
from inside I'm only vile and sham
and the dawn I hope I brought
took us only to our dishonorable graves

as the time passes by
people come and go
only I stay here
proudly as I should
yet in the end
I stand alone
a king without a throne

we wonder we wander
we are but searching for the light
eyes up in the horizon
we wander we wonder
if any hope is left in sight
eyes up in the horizon

as the new dawn rises âmy face like stone
emotions are a luxury I never owned
have to stay strong
lead the way/Weak shall perish
nothing can hurt me â I'm immortal
I'll be standing here forever more
I know I'm lying to myself
under the surface
illness grows feeding itself â from my fears

as the time passes by
people come and go
only I stay here
proudly as I should
yet in the end
I stand alone
a king without a throne

we wonder we wander
we are but searching for the light
eyes up in the horizon
we wander we wonder
if any hope is left in sight
eyes up in the horizon

as the dawn comes â again the red sun rises
but this time I won't be greeting my old friend
as my dead figure crumbles down
let the light lead me home

when all face (all face)
when all face down
[4x]

we wonder we wander
we are but searching for the light
eyes up in the horizon
we wander we wonder
if any hope is left in sight
eyes up in the horizon
[2x]
