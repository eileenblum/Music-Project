today seems to be a good day
today I show you the way
in this dark place we breed
but now it's time to proceed

now I am reclaiming my throne

I am the Alpha and the Omega
the first and the last
the beginning and the end
will you ever deny that

I am the beginning of the divine touch
I will lead the chaos astray
I am the end of everything
I will light the darkness away

now I am at my throne

I'll get rid of flesh ân bones
and rise again as the messiah
it's a reincarnation
my soul will ascend to a higher place
and get my life back to trace
will he bring the salvation
I will turn your bones to dust
and I will make the metal rust
children scream damnation
you will burn in divine light
and still you'll claim that
I am kind I am the saviour,
I am and you can never deny that

there will be nowhere to run
you shall all go with a boom
there will be nowhere to run
you shall all go with a boom

you all go boom
you all go boom
you all shall go go with a boom

MÃ¡ttÃ¡rÃ¡djÃ¡t mis leat dovle

Eai du vuoitte vaÅ¡Ã¡laÄÄat jos
