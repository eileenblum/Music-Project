ultimation
sensation
climax driven hyperventilation
my creation
devastation
my sick sick sick sick
manifestation

all the things I see down here
corrode my eyes
and make me fear
call it a mutiny
that sets us free
are you coming with me

D.I.Y. stands for
Do It Yourself

I have to do it myself
I have to do it myself
don't you think that
the decision is mine
destructive personality

wont you let me do it myself
wont you let me do it myself
the decision is mine
from here to eternity
my life
my will
and final this will be
my end
my definite end
from here to eternity
this is my last option
this is my last resort
and the final transmission
from here to eternity

from here to eternity

passion driven determination
force it in without lubrication
plant the seeds
intimation
can't see through the lust
of devastation

in the morning
the sun won't rise
it will be a lifeless time

only nightmares
only losses
countless voices
scream help me
try to reach me
try to love me
try to give me
a reason to stay
for what
that I must ask
for what
I can't understand
for what
should I really stand
hah, I think I have a better plan

D.I.Y. stands for
Do It Yourself

I have to do it myself
I have to do it myself
don't you think that
the decision is mine
destructive personality

wont you let me do it myself
wont you let me do it myself
the decision is mine
from here to eternity
my life
my will
and final this will be
my end
my definite end
from here to eternity
this is my last option
this is my last resort
and the final transmission
from here to eternity

my life
my will
and final this will be
my end
my definite end
from here to eternity
this is my last option
this is my last resort
and the final transmission
from here to eternity
