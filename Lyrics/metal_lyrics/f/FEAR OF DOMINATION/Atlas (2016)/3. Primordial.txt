I'm so fed up
so so fed up
every day every night
life is fucked up

so many rules
so many fools
so so so often disgraced by you
I've lost my way in too many ways
what really is me
what makes me frail
too many times I've lost the truth
the history is made today

forget the new
forget the you
I want to be more than the few
release the primeval
the ancient side of you
primordial
overcome the walls inside of you
and let your prime instincts
take hold of you

feel the dark passenger
take the reins
don't look back
let it out
and take control

so I have made my final choice
I took the turn from fake to real
we all are going to die tonight
so better make the best of this life

still I have no doubts about this
unleash the animal within
rage hate fight mate
that's all I need to feel something

forget the new
forget the you
I want to be more than the few
release the primeval
the ancient side of you
primordial
overcome the walls inside of you
and let your prime instincts
take hold of you

rage hate fight mate
feel the rage feel the hate
Engage the fight it's time to mate

(there are
for us no instincts
we no longer need the term in psychology
everything we have been in the habit of
calling an instinct today
is a result, largely,
of training
belonging to man's learned behavior)

forget the new
forget the you
I want to be more than the few
release the primeval
the ancient side of you
primordial
overcome the walls inside of you
and let your prime instincts
take hold of you
