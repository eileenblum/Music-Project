too many times
so many lies
half-way there and
finally I give up the fight
tired to see you drown
you are face down
in your own sadness

I'm powerless yet
trying to reach you
for reasons unknown
which one will be the real victim

remains to be seen

how many times
I must save
I must save
I must save
I must save you from drowning
where lies the dignity
when you give your face to the pain

she begs for more
suck it
suck it
suck it
suck it ân take it all in
every moment of
pleasure you give me
is just pulling me down under with you

here I find myself
standing next to your flame
and waiting for the rain

divided
and I can feel it through your eyes
devoted
too many dreams are left behind
dictated
all the pain that has been done
deserted
so much misery it burns
divided
and I can feel it in your eyes
devoted
all the agony inside
dictated
too many words are left untold
deserted
you never leave me alone

this morning I woke up
next to the Misery
that cold bitch
was lying beside me
sucking all the life out of me
enjoy it

invite the Agony
not again
not again
not again
not again
your crazy sister
who seems to be also
craving for me

here I find myself
standing next to your flame
and waiting for the rain

divided
and I can feel it through your eyes
devoted
too many dreams are left behind
dictated
all the pain that has been done
deserted
so much misery it burns
divided
and I can feel it in your eyes
devoted
all the agony inside
dictated
too many words are left untold
deserted
you never leave me alone
