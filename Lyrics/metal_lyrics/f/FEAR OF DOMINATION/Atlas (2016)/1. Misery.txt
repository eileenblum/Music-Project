she's there
so innocent
standing alone
smiling or crying
and things that
should've been known
all the time
all the pain
all the joy
she dwells so deep
that she will drown
forcing herself into
the deep end of the pool

365 days of pain can't go
without a trace
but she knows better
and won't leave a mark
for me to follow
I can't see
I can't hear
but I can smell
she is rotting from inside
slowly but surely
the Misery walks along the path

and I can feel it through your eyes
too many dreams are left behind
all the pain that has been done
so much misery it burns

and I can feel it in your eyes
all the agony inside
too many words are left untold
you never leave me alone
