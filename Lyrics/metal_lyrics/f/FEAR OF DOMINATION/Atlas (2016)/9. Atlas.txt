have to get up
have to keep walking
the burden grows
withering me
yet one falls âcause of me
will is strong
mind is weak

have to get up
have to keep walking
I sense the flaw
devouring me
listen
it breathes
the death walks along with me
the death walks along with me
(along with me)

as I carry the weight of the world
the burden meant for me
in my dreams I've lost you all
one by one have buried you all

witness me
atlas
witness me
[2x]

this is the song
for the fallen ones
this is the song
for the forgotten ones
now sing the song
of the mighty Atlas being crushed
under the weight of this world

again one is lost
the one is lost
taken away
away from me
how many more still have to go
until my end finally comes

as I carry the weight of the world
the burden meant for me
in my dreams I've lost you all
one by one have buried you
[2x]

witness me
atlas
witness me
[2x]
