it's just you and me in this cage
beauty and the beast in our grand parade
that makes us whole and born again
but nothing comes without a sacrifice
no smiles without bloody cries
we cannot run this out, no
so we choose to fight

let me be the sacrifice we need
we both know this is how it should be
we both know this must be done
so please end this game my love

(el toro motherfucker!) [2x]

you say I'm crazy but I am fine
it's moments like these that prove I'm right
no one tells me what I can do
I'm a man
I'm a bull
I'm a motherfucking beast
let them see what we have become
see the blood
see the pain
everything they've been waiting for
our crimes were a total fucking mystery
that still stain our history
and so we found ourselves
standing here
at the battlefield that
some might call love

let me be the sacrifice we need
we both know this is how it should be
we both know this must be done
so please end this game my love
my last assault is here
the red curtain evades
and the audience yells
olÃ©!
these words have meant something
I must be more than nothing
anything you say
everything we were
must be worth something
[2x]

end this nowâ¦
