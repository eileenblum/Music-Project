look around
the world is dying outside
gaze through your window
what do you find?

fear lurks âround every corner
it's all that you know
are you ready to be
a crucial part of the show

'Cause look at us
we're something more
crazy motherfuckers
from darkness we were born
what can you do
run, cover and hide
to own this shit you call life

chaos is sanctuary
chaos breeds life

we see the world
the world gone down
witness the light
the light worn out
we party like the world is ending
the carnival apocalypse ascending
ours is the gift
the gift of lust
deeds meet desires
from dawn âtil dusk
we party like there's no tomorrow
so follow us and leave your sorrow

your naked body caressed by our tongues
our thirst for your innocence thrives

we take what we want
we use what we need
you make our hunger increase
your flesh is like a disease

slaughter, daughter
all night, all day
slaughter, daughter
all work, no play

we see the world
the world gone down
witness the light
the light worn out
we party like the world is ending
the carnival apocalypse ascending
ours is the gift
the gift of lust
deeds meet desires
from dawn âtil dusk
we party like there's no tomorrow
so follow us and leave your sorrow
[2x]

chaos is sanctuary
chaos breeds life
