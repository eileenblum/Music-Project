welcome to the wasteland
that is my life
I wonder how the world will
taste today when everything looks grey
I can't go back there again
there I see faces of my children
and messages written on walls
with their blood
when the treat rushes into my veins
lift me up in the sky
the warm and lovely adrenaline
the trusted friend of mine
however it comes with a price
more is always more
and satisfaction is what I need
as I express myself
victims are always left behind
if I'm killing time
it is time that I really need

so is it wrong to feel alive
what means to be free
when I enter the killing fields
and let adrenaline take over me
I take my dose to feel alive
you'll see what I mean
when the colours return to me
is this what I really need

sometimes murder
and sometimes whores
sometimes happy
but mostly I just need more
give me tension
give me gore
give a bit of lust and serve instincts raw
I'm the lord of lies lying on the cold floor
dry dust fills my mouth
lets double the dose
always looking for new ways to feel

let the mystery ride heal me

so is it wrong to feel alive
what means to be free
when I enter the killing fields
and let adrenaline take over me
I take my dose to feel alive
you'll see what I mean
when the colours return to me
is this what I really need

once again colours are
vanishing from my life
dust swallows everything I touch
like some dark Midas
I venture forth
laying waste around me

then I

kill âem slay âem fuck âem
use them in every way
break âem shake âem take âem
whatever gives me my fix
lay âem flay âem nail âem
dominating everything
kick âem wreck âem fool âem
steal their colours away

so is it wrong to feel alive
what means to be free
when I enter the killing fields

and let adrenaline take over me
so is it wrong to feel alive
what means to be free
when I enter the killing fields
and let adrenaline take over me
I take my dose to feel alive
you'll see what I mean
when the colours return to me
is this what I really need
