It speaks to me
In golden tongues
Willing to give itself to me
If Iâm ready to pay the price

Waking up something hidden
Something primitive
Something scary
Or maybe even real
Waking up something hidden
Something primitive
Something scary
I fear it is real

But the cake was a lie
All way long
The will is being ripped
By a nightmare
Feel how it drains the life away
Everythingâs shared as long as it
Just comes from me

Youâre a parasite in me
You live because of me
Youâre a parasite in me
You live and breathe from me

Canât get away from it
Canât turn away from it
Next you find yourself letting it in
And without hesitation it will poison your will

The claws stick hard and roots grow deep
It promises to give all your dreams
Next to nothing you will be
Just a host until you decease

Youâre a parasite in me
You live because of me
Youâre a parasite in me
You live and breathe from me
What will become and what will be
Left of me when the story ends
What will become and what will be
Left to tell by the morning light
