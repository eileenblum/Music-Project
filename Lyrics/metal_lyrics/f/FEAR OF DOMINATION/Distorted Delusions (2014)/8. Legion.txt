Who are you?
Who am I?
Is everybody here just to die?
I gave you a purpose
I made you grow
So when youâre ripe
The harvest follows

Little bit this
Little bit that
Here, made a cocktail
From your fat
Drink it now
All bottoms up
The time has come to
Feed out hunger
To feed our hunger

My name is legion for we are many
We are each a nation
And you are just the prey
So begins the harvest
We wonât leave you anything
We are the strongest
You are the prey

So who made you?
Who is god?
Pitiful names to justify
I gave you a life
So I can take one too
Youâre the cattle and
That means food
Little bit this
And little bit that
And some pepper for your fat
The oven is ready
The dinner is served
The guests are waiting for the dessert
