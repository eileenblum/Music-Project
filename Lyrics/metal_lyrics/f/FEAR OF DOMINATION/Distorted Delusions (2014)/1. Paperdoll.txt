Have a little faith in me
At least make it easier for me
Just for me
From paper Iâll build your carcass
But scissors will always beat that
How much more I must give
To get all of you

I killed the sun
Watched as it came down
The light bleeds out
Right to my feet

You are my star
I take your light
Torn down paperdoll
I take your crown
And make you bow
Torn down paperdoll

We could be more
I would give it all
I turn you real
And get my pretty new doll

Better not to reach for the sun
It will surely burn
Better to make you behave
The way I meant you to do

You are my star
I take your light
Torn down paperdoll
I take your crown
And make you bow
Torn down paperdoll

I cut you
I love you
I cut you
I love you

You are my star
I take your light
Torn down paperdoll
I take your crown
And make you bow
Torn down paperdoll
Youâre mine now
Canât sign out
Let me see that ass of yours now
Torn down paperdoll
I use you
And cut you
Do what I ever want to
Torn down paperdoll
