We lead your life
Tell what is right
Youâre machine to use
Your will is the thing to fool

Donât you brea the fucking rules!

When thereâs no hope
Needle brings the dope
Thereâs no free will
That we always kill
There are no dreams
Just perverted scenes
Inject drugs and plant new genes

In the cradle of your skullâ¦

Through the needle we came
And to the brain we went
Here we build our nest
From here we spread the plague
When you say itâs not enough
More hardware will be brought
We have built what is you
We always see things through

We will sing the song of madness for you
We pull the strings in you

I am the pain
And I am the fear
The two true commandments that control you
Our implanted voice was never your choice
How about a robotic limb
An invisible brand new will
You wanna kill kill kill killâ¦
