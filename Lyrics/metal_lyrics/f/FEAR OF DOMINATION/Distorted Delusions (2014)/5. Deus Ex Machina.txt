Who says the rules
Who is the emperor
Turning his thumb down

Never surrender
The things behind the curtain
The god from machine
The random encounter
Never gave up to solution
We saw the truth
Still they are closing in
Closing in for a kill

All becomes compromised
We are stuck in this situation of ours
Until machines awake
I see what are the stakes

Expect the unexpected
Deus ex machina
Mess up the life perfected
Deus ex machina
It is divine influence
Making its move in this show called life
That no one ever wanted to come
Deus ex machina

Tear us apart
Itâs like ill will
That no one ever wants
With no sense or meaning
Or any good reason
The gods make their move
Towards the happy ending

Expect the unexpected
Deus ex machina
Mess up the life perfected
Deus ex machina
It is divine influence
Making its move in this show called life
That no one ever wanted to come
Deus ex machina
