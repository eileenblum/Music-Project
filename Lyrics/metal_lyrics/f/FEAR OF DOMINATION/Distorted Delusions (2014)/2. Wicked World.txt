Itâs a wicked world

I want you to feel it
I want you to bring it
Listen to me this song is about you

Sell people and the profit is good
More drugs and all is good
Shoot some to make me good
Suffer and I am god

Mass destruction
The art of violence
Few are laughing
Others are crying

Take it
Fake it
Make it
Break it

Are you ready?

Itâs a wicked world
Enjoy the show
What the fuck is wrong?!
Everything is!
Everybody ready to go

We are something that you are not
We are something that you will be
We are something that you wonât have
Because you are waste of time

I went so far
I went so deep
Never wanted to be part of this

Willing to wait for salvation
Apetite for decimation
Before the godâs decreation
Enjoy the suffering

We break youâ¦ We break youâ¦ We break you
