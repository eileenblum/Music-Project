As soon as you are born
We will teach you how to make war
We will beat you to become more
The soul will bend furthermore

Arbeit macht frei und
Du bist das Schwein
Itâs not the end of the world
But you can see it from here

I will break you
I will beat you
When you give up
You wonât feel love

Control, terror and violence
The things that create obedience
Chaos, lust and gluttony
The holy trinity of mutiny
How human is forced to recreate

If there is a god
He will have to ask for my forgiveness
I donât think
I just do
And they tell me what I need to say

Arbeit macht frei und
Du bist das Schwein
Itâs not the end of the world
But you can see it from here

Control, terror and violence
The things that create obedience
Chaos, lust and gluttony
The holy trinity of mutiny
How human is forced to recreate
When I will fall down
They just pick the next one from the line
They wonât run out of time
First they want to greet you
Then they will just beat you
It was pleasure to meet you
