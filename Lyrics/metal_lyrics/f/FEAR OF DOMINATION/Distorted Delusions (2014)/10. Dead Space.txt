Why am I so stuck in here
Lost in space and time
Keep running away from it
The unknown enemy

Still at the point of no return
Bypass the rational thinking
No reason
No conclusion
Or even beginning

This is the new beginning

It is so silent
Dead in here
In space no one can hear you scream
Are you willing to die
Just for me
Make your mark on eternity

Monsters have taken over my head
Somehow Iâm still alive
Mind is drifting away
Floating in dead space
Trying to escape
Make up for the mistake
I have madeâ¦

It is so silent
Dead in here
In space no one can hear you scream
Are you willing to die
Just for me
Make your mark on eternity

Eyes up to the stars
The salvation awaits
Foreign objects in this world
Continue the malfunction

All the slimy things in my mind
All the things inside
Maybe this one is for someone else
Still the filthy things in my life
All the filth inside
This must be for someone else
