I have a dream and purpose
Iâm here to lead and conquer
Lesser minds gather around
Build my monument to the ground

Must create a reason for my nation
Holy book of new obligation
I will make us mean something
For the better of our kind

You want to see what I can be?
Everybody come and follow me!

I am the chosen one
The one to bring us the new dawn
I do what I want because
I know what is best for you
I will rise and shine

You shall lead
And bring us to
The greater brighter dawn
We shall obey
And do whatever you will say

On the dead my empire rises
No one will ask about the prices
Youâre not fired, slaves are sold
Ultin you drop down cold
Opposition falls with machine gun fire
Mortality might go higher
Millions dead and still counting
No one will ever question me

I am the chosen one
The one to bring us the new dawn
I do what I want because I know what is best for you
I will rise and shine

You shall lead
And bring us to
The greater brighter dawn
We shall obey
And do whatever you will say

You just enslaved and
Brought us only destruction
But we wonât bend down
We want your head for this
Now your time has come
And we are coming for you
You will come down
The greatest dictator
