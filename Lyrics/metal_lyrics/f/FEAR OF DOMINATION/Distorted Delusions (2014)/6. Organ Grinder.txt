Thereâs a creature that no one knows
Bedtime story that shouldâve been told
It steals the children and takes âem away
To the nice birthday party full of despair

Hush little child donât dare to cry
The party is about to start
So you better smile
Iâll bake the cake from your flesh and your mind
Which pretty notes shall my organ grind

1â¦2â¦3â¦4â¦
Daddyâs knocking at your door
5â¦6â¦7â¦8â¦
You better not hesitate
1â¦2â¦3â¦4â¦
He is gonna get some more
5â¦6â¦7â¦8â¦
Wait and it will be too late

Soon the last tear falls
The sun grows dark
The way homeâs lost
Forever
Still I hear his laughter in my ears
Never-ending fears have a hold on me

Now takes those clothes off you
And close that door behind you
Before I put you in the cake
I better have a little taste
Now hereâs a little toy for the princess
The doll brings you closer to madness
Iâm a fun one
A dirty dirty old man
And I do just what a man can

Soon the last tear falls
The sun grows dark
The way homeâs lost
Forever
Still I hear his laughter in my ears
Never-ending fears have a hold on me

Now thereâs a party no one knows
Only the one who has found the doll
The ceremony ends
Some cake we will eat
Itâs tasty
Itâs moist
And itâs made of your meat

Soon the last tear falls
The sun grows dark
The way homeâs lost
Forever
Still I hear his laughter in my ears
Never-ending fears have a hold on me
