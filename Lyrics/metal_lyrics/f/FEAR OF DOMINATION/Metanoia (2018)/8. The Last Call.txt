Take a step to the unknown, fall down on the cold floor
Face down and it gets hard to get up although I try
To push myself, my chains will drag you down
I feel so powerless, I start to shiver stumble in my own
Feel like a child, reaching for something that is not there
I refuse to give up, won't let my life waste away

Now you've seen the last time that I crawl
No final act, curtain call
Your common crime it won't be yours
But will be mine
I'm not afraid to lose it all
To watch my life crash burn and fall
Breathe it all in for the last time

Set free your insanity
It's the sleeping monster that awaits
To be revealed
Familiar poison, taste of yesterday
Taste of defeat, the dreams that I gave away
Slowly blinding, taking your breath away
This is the last of the times I'm giving in
My name is the last thing that you'll ever know
On the grave that you almost forgot
Well, I did not
So now shut up or I will smash your face
Your pretty face all over the place
When all I see is red that colours my pain
Fills my mouth with vile tongue
Far too long you have stood in my way
I fell no remorse to let you slip away
Standing on the edge
Choices are in my hands
There's no turning back
This is the, this is the end
