You walk in the room
Where shadows creep on the walls
You find yourself alone and hurt
And there you see me shivering
Hiding in the corner
Body bare and naked
As the cold concrete floor
Waiting for the end to come
This is he day when it will start
Never deny the mistakes I made
And with no fear I will face'em
Waiting for the end to come
Question yourself, this place ain't fun
My body is spent and mind is gone
Will is bleeding out from the heart
Let me hear your voice
Whisper silently those words to me

Let me disappear from here
This place is just too cold
Don't search for me
I don't want to be found
A day will come
When you will find
Your meaningful lie for your life

Waiting for the end to come
Another day and still no sun
I did what needed to be done
Still you stare like mindless ones
Waiting for the end to come
Close my eyes and come undone
Nothing what I used to be
But regret won't travel with me
I want to hear those words again
Tell me now did you do your purpose
Played your role and made your move
Your little time and little minds
Can't even see the truth
Your work here meant nothing
Your existence meant nothing
So lie to yourself day after day
And unleash your judgement on me
