Mould the minds
Lack of control
Give the shape to this reality
In this gravity, am I real enough for you?
Mould the minds, still no control
Ignite the fire inside, without blasphemy
Can you feel this within you? Mould the minds
And regain the control
Release the beast that you just want to burn
And let yourself to be undone
Play with all the senses, deceive them
Be the monster or disaster

Now we'll resolve with fear or else
Take control of me
It has taken over everything
We float between dimensions
Powerless to change the pretensions
Seen to much of this fallacy

Mould the minds, my lack of control
Welcome to this state unknown
With the power of our memories
Power of memories, the monster â monster
In me â in you, illusion and the reason to break
Free, play with all the senses, deceive them
Be the monster or disaster
We float between dimensions
Give me a reason to leave this place
