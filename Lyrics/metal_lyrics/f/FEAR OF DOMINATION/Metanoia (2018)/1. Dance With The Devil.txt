Spread them wide open for me
I want to see what lurks in there
Give it all to me
To get all of me
Give some for you
It's still for me
What goes around
Also comes around
And what goes in
Comes also out
I smell the fear
Mixed up with tears
But it's your stench that disgusts me
Tear it all off now
Just make it hard
Make it last all night
I hope you still have lust left for me

Don't try to hide
No need to cry
I'll love this lust until I die
Let me see you smiling
Take my hand
Dance with the devil
Don't tell your mom
Don't tell your dad
You'll get something they never had
And finish this off

Let's keep it simple between us
Hush hush, what's the rush?
When skin turns to blue
You'll realise it's all about you
Let me touch those curves
Would you do it for me
We have reached the goal
The climax, the end
I'll make you beg
If I let you stay
Have some lust for me
Even though you keep running from me
I know this is the real love
This is the real thing
This is the real love, love, love
