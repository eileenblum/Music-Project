What would you say
If I unfold my life like a book to you
Which words would be spoken out loud
Or the ones you fear and bury to the ground
I will give you pain and roots
Show the beautiful truth
So tell me do you fear me now
Or still want to be at my side

Don't leave me alone now
I hold you just a little while
Don't leave me alone now
But now it's time to say goodbye
Now write on my skin
This frail moment
Our life with a single word
Don't you ever
Show it to me
Make sure that no one ever finds it

Show me the hope and the pure will to do
And how to believe in something new
The thing that I can't be to you
I build my fortress on dignity and strength
But my throne is quiet and empty
I'm longing for you
We are breathing dust
Inside this house of shame
