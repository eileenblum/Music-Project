Perfection to imperfection
We shed this bitter tear
Let it devour our children
As your mistakes create my happiness

Tore these remaining limbs
Eat the flesh, all of it
Make gluttony our middle name
Your lovely filth becomes our bed

We love to make love
And make you feel the beauty
We love to make love, just let it show
We love to make love, nothing sick at all
We love to make love, it's just so beautiful

We dance beneath the scarlet rain
This makes us sick and beautiful
Eat the flesh to fill your emptiness
To become sick and beautiful
Behold the beautiful vile lie
Try to be sick and beautiful
Like a stain our creation
We make it sick and beautiful

Let the blood paint the walls
Prettiest color of 'em all
Call us shallow or call us whores
We end it to condemn our flaws
Your failure becomes our blessing
While you whisper in disbelief
All stains must be removed
With the pristine mind we make our move
We fuck under your despises
Spit on the beliefs of your innocence
Like thousand knives we'll pierce your mind
And we will not run out of time
