Yet again I find you asking hwy
The reason behind that violent smile
You are disturbing something really dark
If you look at me, what do you see
Another painting left just to be
A twisted sequence, distorted delusion
Can't rest until my work is done
Still you want to stay

Stay now with me
It's all right here
It's the end of the world as we know it
Stay
As I show it to you
The face of pain
Forever in nowhere
It's alright there
As I show it you
The face of pain

Paint your final touch on me
Colour the demons of your own
Smile is all that you know
Your mind is a ticking time bomb
The canvas is torn, pain is born
Why don't you let me be
Some things are better left alone
And not to be told, still you want me to stay
Show it to me, show it to me
The way it used to be, give it to me
And breathe the air with me
Still I feel what I am told to feel
Pain stays with me, forever in nowhere
It's alright there, as I show it you
The face of pain
