Loose the chains holding me
I have the freedom to fly
Still I find myself
Bound tightly to the ground
To the wall, to my will
To the lies I despise
Stuck in the trenches at the war zone of my mind
I preserve sanity
Made of fragile glass
Search my way through the maze
How long will I last?
Made my plans for tomorrow
Still I'm stuck in yesterday

Obsession
To leave the past behind
Make a sacrifice
For a new dawn to rise
Break the barriers
To finally realise what you can become
Don't deny my rights
And claim what is mine
I will draw the line
It's not my demise
I'll make my way
So don't you dare to wear me down
Obsession
Just leave the past behind
Make a sacrifice
For a new brighter light
Break the barriers
To finally realise what you have become

Remember times when breathing was easy
Now it's like the whole world is holding me back
Let me through, time for you
To get out of my way
In the mindless wars left unsolved

A demonic insanity turns reality into a haze
Feed the madness of this world
It is not just a phase
In this progression of obsession
And the need for oppression
Are you ready to make a change?
