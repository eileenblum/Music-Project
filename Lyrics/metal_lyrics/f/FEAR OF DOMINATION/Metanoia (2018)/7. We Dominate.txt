We are the light
The truth that never dies â don't let it die
The righteous 'cause, the beacon that
Lights up the fucking sky
Give the reason for tomorrow
Let the blood boil under your skin
Trust the venom leads to a better place
You are the voice, the unspoken truth
The thing we need
And together

We dominate, the world is yours
We dominate, stand up straight, stand up tall
We dominate, make them scream out your name
Forever, together, start all over again
We dominate, and I am yours
We dominate, take my all, make me your whore
We dominate, I wanna scream out your name
Forever, gets better, just to be sensational

We ride the night, we make you rise
We are the closest thing to the gods
Your little mind affection
Offers a little redemption
Now you see the true tomorrow
See the flavours, all the colours
Trust the will that runs in your veins
Forever â gets better â it's now or never never
Forever â gets better â we burn the sky together
Just be sensational
