Songbird give me a sad song to sing
Before I rip out every feather until my hearts starts to ring
I've relined my stars leaving my scars with envy
I'm nothing but a man running with words that are empty
Catch a songbird clip its wings
Throw it in a cage watch it rage and sing
Songs of sorrow sounds of lust don't trust in the words of tomorrow already convoluted enough
While the illusion of love and freedom is to precious to touch
Caught in a clutch mad at the world thinking it owes us this much
So I said
Songbird give me a sad song to sing
Before I rip out every feather until my hearts starts to ring
Salvage the coast for ivory and gold
Silver and bones as we seek out giants and ghost
And all we're left with is an echo, 
And all we're left with is a bitterness to let go.
While the illusion of love and freedom is to precious to touch
Caught in a clutch mad at the world thinking it owes us this much
I hear the echoes; they're calling me home
My love
While the illusion of love and freedom is to precious to touch
Caught in a clutch mad at the world thinking it owes you this much
This world's trash its plaques it's broken
We're the disease that blanked the ocean
So how can you say everything is all right as the sea turns to black 
It's just a matter of time
As we watch this world decay

Acid tongue filter the waste
Its so much easier sleeping believe we're safe
And its so much easier coasting with the waves.
So enough of this world more of the girls and the size of their waist
So its safe to say my faith is laced in grey, safe to say my faith is laced in grey
Not from this world, but from us as people. 
We are bred to be disarmed by a certain type of evil.

Ring the alarm and it sounds so beautiful, truth only speaks whens its convenient or suitable.

This world's trash its plaques it's broken
We're the fucking disease that blanked the ocean
How can you say everything is all right as the sea turns to black it's just a matter of time

Songbird give me a sad song to sing
Before I rip out every feather until my hearts starts to ring
