By the look on your face I can tell youâre afraid
By the look on your face you believe itâs too late
Take a look around no ones asking to be saved
In this words weâre born to only two types of shades
So, what lengths would you seek out the color?
Would you lie? Would you cheat?
Would you watch your own suffer?
Only to discover that fame is not everything
And to dance with the devil is such a hard dance to sing.
You say that youâre sorry and that what I thought
But really youâre only sorry at the fact you got caught
They told you everything that you wanted to hear
They lied they seduced you until they purchased your fears
Now the only way to rest is to pay with your tears
Because the sound of you crying is like music their ears

So validate my vanity with illusive thoughts of flattery
As we fabricate a reality, with magazines and celebrity lies
Materialistic thought up lives
Whoâs pregnant? Who Engaged?
Slim your self up you could have been saved
Thereâs a storm in the addict and its full of static  
Whoâs pregnant? Who Engaged?
Slim your self up you could have been saved
Weâre all slaves! Weâre all slaves!
To a industry thatâs built off of image and fakes

I think youâre beautiful just the way you are.
Every flaw every scare
Every battle fought and lost
I think weâre so quick to dismiss the difference 
Wearing badges of recognition just to impress our princess and princes
So I stand for the misfits
For the ones who donât give a shit
Because the truth isnât for the privileged

Youâre all plastic recycled and packaged 
Youâre all plastic yea youâre all plastic    
Youâre all plastic recycled and packaged 
Nothing but puppets with hands up their Asses
Youâre just plastic yea youâre just plastic
Recycled and packaged yea youâre just plastic
 Youâre just vultures ripping at a culture 
That we built to encage our own monsters
