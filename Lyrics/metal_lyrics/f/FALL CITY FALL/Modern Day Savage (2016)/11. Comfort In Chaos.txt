I want to split the world, with the weight of the words that are sung
I want to strike fear in your faith, with the jaded tip of my tongue.
I want to ask, for the gift clarity but Iâm afraid, itâs too much.
So Iâll grind my teeth repeatedly, till I spit out nothing but dust.

Your perception is broken; as a result Iâve sharpened my speech.
So Iâll speak, So Iâll speak!
Until they take the earth beneath my feet 
Until they take the earth beneath me.

Thereâs a war in the streets, are you really going to sit there in silence,
Breathe the violence

All of our lives, weâve been bred by design
Carefully coloring inside the lines.
I awoke and all I saw, was everyone was still a sleep
Congratulations you did exactly what you been told.
Itâs funny how you look, when you fit the exact fucking mold.

I donât blame you, for not wanting to live this way
Hold you head high, with decisions that youâve made

But thereâs a line in the sand thatâs been crossed over again

Thereâs a war in the streets, thereâs a war in our homes,
As weâre tranquilized by lies, and we criticize our own,
Your apathy is the enemy, and its really staring to define us.
As crooked and wired, as crooks and liars, trying to piss out our own fires.
