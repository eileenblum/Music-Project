I donât want your money; I just want your love and art.
I donât want your money; I just want your heart. 
This is a protest against you racists and fascists,
Your ignorant youâre full of shit, youâre just a fucking savage.
This is a protest against religion and its text.
The ignorance you influence and so strongly protect.
Say that Iâm wrong; say Iâve gone to far.
Only when these words have started a war. 

This is a protest! This is a protest!
I hope you know what youâre are fighting for and I hope its fucking worth it
I will not stand down.

This is a protest! This is a protest!
I hope you know what youâre are fighting for and I hope its fucking worth it
I will not stand down.

The tides are always high when youâre drowning in your weakness.
People living in privet lives, they believe that theyâre privileged
But theyâre victim masked behind a theory and a thesis. 
If they new oh god if they new
Well they would be falling into pieces.
Itâs a sobering thought soaked in cloth drenched in whiskey or scotch.
They assume its true if they heard it on the news, is why I keep my doors all locked

We are not the enemy you speak of.
Weâre not the enemy and this is not the end. 
In this world theyâre fears youâll never flee from.
Weâre not the enemy and this is not the end

Not the end, not the end when weâre standing at the edge
Can you look me in the eye and lie about your intent disguised and full of resent 
For the people youâve condemned 
So cut the strings on puppets that only just play and pretend. 

We are not the enemy you speak of.
Weâre not the enemy and this is not the end. 
In this world theyâre fears youâll never flee from.
Weâre not the enemy and this is not the end
