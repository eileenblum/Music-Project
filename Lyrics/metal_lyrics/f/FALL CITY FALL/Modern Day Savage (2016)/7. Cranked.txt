She lost her self-control along time ago
On the forth floor of room 404, in only god knows where.
Doesn't remember what city she's in, who's she with or when
But swears she's with a couple of friends
That's where it all started, a industry built off the broken hearted 
Blames a boy she use to love,
No matters if he's sorry well it will never be enough
She doesn't want to forgive him
She wants to convince him he's the reason why her life isn't worth living 
So she's looking for a reason to leave, 
I guess bad weather cheap scenery would be good enough for me
So she's running away
Turns her memories into enemies but likes it that way
Doctor I'm asking for a friend of a friend

Prescriptions close to empty would you fill it again
Would you mind doubling it up, last time I don't think I got a buzz?
What happened to solving problems the old fashion way
A bit of Jack and Jerry full of gasoline
Fuck popping pills over the counter
Feeling sorry for our selves watching house wives of Atlanta
Can't help being a victim of the screen
Can't help with all of your insecurities 
Cant help when you wish it wasn't me, really sorry baby think you're being a bit of a drama queen.

There are kids with addiction prescriptions to riddlen 
So you put them in room to sit in
Swore to their parents that they're different 
So they take away their play
Said he was better off that way
Now it's harder for him to get straight As 
Then it would be to get straight grade cocaine
I don't think that's he's got anxiety, bi polar of "HDHD"
I think he's bored just looking for a friend
Or maybe he's just looing for love and attention
I think you should spend more time with your son
Instead of ridicule him for all the things he's done
Of course they want to convince you he's depressed 
Other wise they wouldn't be credible for a billion dollars business 

Both my parents suffered from addiction
My father offed him self
My mother tried to suppress it
Cage the animal comes back twice as aggressive 
Tell me know how the pills taste for breakfast

Can't help being a victim of the screen
Can't help with all of your insecurities 
Cant help when you wish it wasn't me, really sorry baby think you're being a bit of a drama queen.

I never said depression didn't exist, there's just got to be a better way then feeding pills to our kids
Cage the animal comes back twice as aggressive
Tell me now how the pills feel for breakfast
Both my parents suffered from addiction
Father offed him self
Mother tried to suppress it
Cage the animal comes back twice as aggressive 
Tell me know how the pills feel for breakfast
