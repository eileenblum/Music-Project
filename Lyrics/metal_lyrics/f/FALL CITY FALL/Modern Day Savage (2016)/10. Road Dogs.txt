Built a bed of nails, sheets stitched in vain
If you had it your way, thatâs where youâd have me lay.

Not one for slander, not looking for a laugh.
Would it make you feel better if you hurt me in theâ¦
Act like I give a shit, just to make you feel your worth.
This is where we say good-bye, Iâm not woeful of your words
the waters off, powers cut
Father the rot and lower your trust,
Sacrifice is no longer enough,
You walk the straight line; Iâll take the curve.

Pleasure to grab your attention; Iâll make it brief if I can
Don't look so discouraged by the feel of my rough hands
Don't let me keep you waiting if you got places to be.
I caught your restless eyes, they sang curiously to me.
Iâm a wanderer by trade, a hypocrite in my down time,
restless in my travels and Oh god, restless in my mind.

There's no sleep in my bed, Yea, its gathered dust since then.
Iâm a prisoner a prisoner, to every mile, every road.
Iâm in love with the fight thatâs how the story goes.

So if the last of my courtesy has already up and flown, itâs for
Mother doesn't remember my face. Her little man was far out grown.
The lady isn't going to like this one; she hates the thought of alone.
Not because she'll miss me much, she just got so use to the monotone

Thereâs no sleep in my bed, yea its gathered dust since then.
A prisoner, a prisoner to every mile to ever road
Iâm a lover of the fight thatâs how the story goes.
So Iâm over it, we're done here. Iâd pack my bags if there were time,
But Iâm afraid if we donât take off now Iâll probably change my mind.
So letâs torch the place and keep moving, oh god don't dare to look back.
The feeling seems soothing now but the glory fades oh far to fast.

I can see the crows gaining on the tale lights, and my patience peaked at last exit.
Either way they followed us all night, or is it my conscious eating me for breakfast
So hold me, as if Iâll never leave again
Because once the morning comes my friend 
Iâm gone again at six AM.
