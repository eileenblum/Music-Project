As long as the empire stands we will remain a commodity
Pawn the brave, week they trade 
Looked at as statistics and property
And Iâm desperate to find the truth in all this
Something more then just reason
But all I seem to be left with is jaded thoughts of faith and feeling
And Iâm feeling weâre feeding on their trash like rats in a trap
So if the truth is bleeding out then whys it look so fucking black?
Kill the horse thatâs holding you back
Buy your whores before your reputation cracks
Lie through your teeth when the chips are all stacked
No one knows the difference, so fuck the facts

I got the disease if you got the means
Why create a cure when we can inflate the need
Give them something they can cough and wheeze
Theyâll be begging, begging, begging to breath
If the truth is bleeding out whys it look so black
I got a feeling weâre rats in a trap
Money is a hoax with the promise of hope
Holding on to the noose at the edge of the bankers rope

Ask the blind man he saw it all
Heard the signs yea he watched the world fall [2x]

God bless this country we live in, cant feed our poor
But we send our people to die in our debts
In their death theyâre worth so much more
Preach peace endorse the war, freedom is nothing but bought in a store bred to believe we could be so much more
But the scales are tipped, thereâs less rich then poor
But we cater in the rich and fuck the poor

I got the disease if you got the means
Why create a cure when we can inflate the need
Give them something they can cough and wheeze
Theyâll be begging, begging, begging to breath
If the truth is bleeding out whys it look so black
I got a feeling weâre rats in a trap
Money is a hoax with the promise of hope
Holding on to the noose at the edge of the bankers rope

Banker beggars
The built the chamber is loaded with failures
Banker beggars
If moneys the new god, well then burn the savor

The built the chamber is loaded with falsified anchors
And all that weâve built is resentment for our failures
So drain my bones of marrow
Put plaster in lungs
The days of prophets and pharos
Have become cut throats and bugs. 

Banker beggars [4x]
If moneys the new god, well then burn the savor
