You got something to say
You got something to prove
Speak from the heart what you're willing to loose
Words are weapons violence shatters the tongue
Lets us love and let us be loved.

Keep your politics out of the music
Save your bullshit its all pollution
We might as well send her off for an execution
I've got the solution fight the illusion [2x]

Business suits thinks we're all just stupid
Try to group us in a mass confusion
I've got the solution fight the illusion
They take the music to exploit and abuse it
With advertisements and then mass-produce it
So I've refused to give these airwaves back
Because the safety of it all is falling fast

Paint my morals alive in color with beauty that's never been seen
The bad out weighs the good these days
I'm looking for reasons to leave 
We could live for so much more.

Keep your politics out of the music
Save your bullshit its all pollution
We might as well send her off for an execution
I've got the solution fight the illusion [2x]

You got something to say
You got something to prove
Speak from the heart what you're willing to loose
Words are weapons violence shatters the tongue
Lets us love and let us be loved.
