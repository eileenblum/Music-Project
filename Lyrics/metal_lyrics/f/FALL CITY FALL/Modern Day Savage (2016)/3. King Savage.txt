Look at this stuff, its all just shit.
Pile up more stuff, still looks like shit.
Glorified trash itâs all odds and ends.
You can burry us in it, when were all fucking dead.

Victims of lust by corruption and greed,
This is the outcome of malice we breathe.
Manipulated love with trinkets and things
Rusted out wings and gloried wet dreams.

Fly towards the sun Icarus
Fly towards the sun
Show them weâll question everything
No matter the fate, no matter the outcome

This place smells like the decay of rotting men
And Iâm afraid at the pace weâre going
 It wont be to long, until weâre forgotten instead
The crows, the crows will carry us bone by bone.
Selfish fuck, happily medicated helpless us.
Youâre a snake youâre a bug.
Trying buying out of this one.
Weâre running off a false sense of identity

Money talks it says weâre all bastards
But who gives a fuck if we make a buck faster
Live like a king, live like a brute
Pull the life straight from its roots
Eat the rich the heart and all their stomach is lined with gold
We create such self-entitled heroes when we offer them pedestals

So as if by design the moon and the stars
Will reline and remind us how small we are
And though we will stand in awe
We cannot let the beauty escape from out lips
As weâre drawn to each other and kiss in eclipse 
No we cannot admit we were wrong
No we cannot admit we were wrong
As we fucked her till her love was gone
Weâll expire

Money talks says weâre all bastards
 Who gives a fuck if we make a buck faster?
Live like a king, live like a brute
Pull the life straight from its roots
Eat the rich the heart and all their stomach is lined with gold
We create such reckless heroes when we offer them pedestals

Savage bastards, savage bastards 
Liars and fucking cheats 
Bastardâs hereâs your fucking receipt
So roll that back you fuck
