Iâve grown to fond of the stars to be fearful of the night.
Galileo said it, I believe it, and itâs how I live my life.
Death has my respect we are known to be great friends
And Iâm sure itâs not to long until I see that motherfucker again
Iâve gazed into his eyes, heâs been watching since I was born.
 And Iâm sure its not to long until heâs knocking at my door
Iâll great him with a smile, offer him a smoke
And our last laugh will be such a harmonizing note
The words that he spoke set shivers down my spine
He said dear son, youâre running out of time
But you can take my place? You can walk my path?
You can be the face, the fear, the footstep behind the mask.
But Iâm a holy man, living in unholy world.
So tell me why its such sin baby to be loving you loving you, loving you girl
So go back to the shadows. Go back to the shadows
Go back to the shadows; to the gallows where you came is where your heart should be
So if Iâm going to hell, well ill meet you there
If itâs true what they say no ones pure can be spared or saved
First rounds on me, first rounds on me, first rounds on me
I admire you for being so god dam brave
So fuck love itâs the least of my worries, Iâm growing weary digging these graves trying to keep these secrets burred
But whatâs the hurry, If there was something find they would have found it by now.
But I got so use to them hanging around, I couldnât recognize them anyhow.
Iâm not a saint I never claimed to be. Made mistakes that would make your heart, your arties freeze seize in disbelief that I keep the disease for company
If Iâm already a damned man, what the fuck do you want from me?
Iâm coming home. Iâm coming home.
If itâs true what they say no ones pure can be spared or saved
Iâm coming home. Iâm coming home. Iâm coming home
I admire you for being so god dam brave
Iâm coming home. Iâm coming home First rounds on me
I admire you for being so god dam brave
