I live in the weak and the wounded
Itâs not our mind but thereâs that is broken 
The most dangerous part is never knowing when the wicked comes out
And when it does there better be no more doubts.

I know that Iâm crazy I know that Iâm a freak
But there is still a few that stand by the words that we speak
So I wont speak for me, Iâll speak for them
For the ones society so easily condemns 
For every race, straight or gay, anyone whose been called a fake
Lets try not living just for today
Youâre waiting on the second coming and when it fucking does
Well Youâll be forgotten just like the rest of us
So youâve seen the face of god
I want to know what it looks like
did he look like a bitter man does he look like he could hold some spite.
Would he forgive me for everything Iâve done
Well I donât think so because I deny his holy and his son

I live in the weak and the wounded
Itâs not ours minds but thereâs that is broken 
The most dangerous part is never knowing when the wicked comes out
And when it does there better be no more doubts.
