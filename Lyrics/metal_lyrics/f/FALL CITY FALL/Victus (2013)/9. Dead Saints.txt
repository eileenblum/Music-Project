Dead men walking, dead saints watching. don't you ever try to fucking stop me. dead saints lie. dead saints rise. and you say its okay ill be fine sink back into my skin time after time this time ill make it alive, before you crawl back inside and fuck with my mind. Despite what you think your lust is not thicker than blood. if you believe that it is I took the liberty to load your gun, point it at yourself because there is no point to run. maybe not today but soon vengeance will come. You said that this was best you did what you thought was right my guess is that just helps you sleep at night, and if you are to die before you wake, say hello to my father for me because its hell you will face.
