Now I don't know if this is something to be concerned
of, but I've got these ideas of murder.
I keep hearing these voices in my head and I keep checking
for monsters under my bed.
Cause they said, they said I was pure,
they said I was cured. But unsure,
If I would use this gift or abuse it.

so I decided to bury the evidence.
when I awoke it was evident,
this was a message, yes but this was not heaven sent.
And I spent my days and my dreams and I've spent my
nights awake figuring out what it means.
when I awoke things weren't the same,
I hear something dark its calling my name.
