I've been bruised and broken bodied.
To the broken hearted that means nothing at all.
Well I'll surrender to you now if it means I'll feel
the slightest bit of something.
cause I've been running for some time.
From many crimes, many men would not do.
To tell you the truth well I ain't got no excuse.
you'll only see me smiling when I'm hanging from that
noose. So walk through. if I'm a monster you're the
same just a preacher in disguise.
Your words are corrupt can make me think otherwise,
you use your trusted words to put people in a bind
take my advice; think with you own damn mind.
don't talk to me about thievery and munity when you
single us out and you steal our beliefs.
try to seize try to police the world but we cant.
as long as we think we can its an on going dance.
I've been bruised and broken bodied to the broken hearted
that means nothing at all well ill surrender to you
now if it means ill feel the slightest bit of something.
I'm only here to prove you wrong in my death.
even though well never know you assume you know best
you think I've been poisoned think I've got problems
because I'm not trying to neglect starve or solve them
cause I've been bruised and broken bodied to the broken
hearted that means nothing at all well ill surrender
to you now if it means ill feel the slightest bit of
something. I'm not afraid of my own inner demons,
they kept me company when no one else would I've got
reasons to believe they're just misunderstood,
understand, this separates the good from the bad,
its not the man who makes the story,
its his story that makes the man.
I'm not in the business of doing people favours,
I'm not the one to run when I'm face to face with my
maker between you and I it was not suicide it was murder
if you're the one to give her the gun if you're the one to encourage her!
