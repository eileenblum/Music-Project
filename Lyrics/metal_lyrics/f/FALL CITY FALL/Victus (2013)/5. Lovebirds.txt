Walk away
You mask your face, hide behind your faith
No saints, no saints, just slaves
Just criminals you are all the same
You're all to blame
And I could strike you down
But I'll just call you out
You preach a truth, a lie, a love so divine
You say we're children of God but you're no son of mine
No you're no son of mine

How can we love with venom running through our blood?
How can we be loved for the things that we have done?
And when we speak, we speak into tongues
To swallow your speech is to poison the words in the verses that are sung
And you're wrong, there's sh*t all written in the stars
Choke on your words, I will sit here and starve
Drink to cure the thirst, die for the cause
You say everything in your silence in your pause
Oh god, isn't the truth raw?
But I'd rather know that than believe love that was so goddamn false

Heartless fiend
You say you love but true motives speak
So listen to these words while your world decays
And you will hear no doubts believe when I say that:
We're all slaves living in a brainwashed age
Plant in us the lies that you seed
You think you reap what you sew?
I'll spit it back in your face and watch the sh*t grow
Over and over and over we go
Over and over and over we go

Cowardice your mark the face of the ignorant
You can hide behind the cross
I'll live for my sins
