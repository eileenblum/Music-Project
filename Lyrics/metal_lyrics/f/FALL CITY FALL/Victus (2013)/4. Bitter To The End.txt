so here we stand toe to toe.
Like I said before It's time to face for ghost what
makes you think time would make a difference?
Now that you're here I think It's best for you to listen.
I don't think you want to hear the things I've got
to say, but if its the last things I do ill make you
listen any ways stop standing staring in awe,
I will spit in your face and still back you will crawl.
Back you will crawl. So convinced there's no way out,
broken promise that you've made.
so convinced there's no way out no roses or footsteps
will fall on your grave. I don't think you want to
hear the things I've got to say but if its the last
things I do ill make sure you listen anyway.
stop standing staring in awe,
if you can look me in the face and prove I am wrong
then Ill kill thy poet and cut the tongues from these
songs I'm not afraid I'm not afraid but if I ever stood
face to face I wouldn't know what to say,
hands start to shake, blood starts to race, I'm not afraid not afraid.

what makes you think time would make a fucking difference,
what makes you think standing here I would fucking
listen. If I ever stood face to face I wouldn't know
what to say I'm not afraid I'm not afraid.
