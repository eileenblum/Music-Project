How naive it would be to think that we could just walk away and leave
Well Im not going anywhere âtill i watch you fucking bleed.
Iâve heard people say they believe the devil could be saved,
Even if that was true i donât think it would be in your case.

Because your lips taste of poison,
Your smile is so corrosive
and Iâm shock, Iâm appalled I was the only one who noticed.
Stay focused, stay focused
So much bigger than you and I
This is a matter of path that we strive.

And if you try, you decide to get in our way
Well I should not be held responsible
for the decision that youâve made.
Suffer I may, the consequences
Oh yes, I will sleep easy, sleep restless
When youâre six deep and not fucking breathing.

and I know that you know that this song is about you
âCause when you hear it, it sends chills all around you
and Iâm sorry for using such harsh fucking words
But after all, itâs not even close to what you deserve

Iâm not afraid of my own inner demons
They kept me company when no one else would.
Iâve got reason to believe theyâre just misunderstood.

If I could take it all back
If I could re-write the book
Well I donât know if I could
For iâm a coward, a crook
Death stains the walls in the air
I feel the presence is near
Deep in the pits of my stomach
Itâs the worst that Iâve feared

Iâm on my knees and Iâm pleading
but the answerâs not there.
So I am forced to march onward
With these burdens i bear.
I am sorry for the hell that I have put you through
I donât deserve to gain forgiveness for the things that you were forced to lose.
