Are we all fools, just wasting time? Trapped by them
Their shallows minds, lets control take our lives, or are we all just wasting time?
Why are we? Why are we waiting? Why are we all just wasting time? So come what may I donât know if I could, prepare for the truth, to be misunderstood.
Weâre not the same, not the same. Youâre only in it for your personal gain
So come what may, I donât know that I could.
So tell me, whatâs your inspiration? Was it all in good fashion? Was it lost in translation? I canât tell with the fragments of bombshell casings
Youâre adding injury to insult to our aspirations; youâre adding injury to insult to our aspirations. No need to waste your breath I think its past your time so give it a rest, give it a rest, give it a rest, give it a fucking rest.

So come what may I donât know if I could. Listen to what they say I donât think that I should.  Iâve been pacing back and forth back and forth, youâre always looking to reflect what its worth on what its worth and whatâs worse, youâve emerged yourself so far into their purse, or the preeminence that it doesnât seem to fucking hurt. So I donât want to hear the resonance of your words. Iâm afraid precious prophets will be unheard, botch, lost, faded. Distorted by your chorusâs so jaded, so jaded. Youâre a fake, a fake, you wallow while you sleep smile when youâre awake; to think thereâs influence in the words that you speak. Makes my knees week. Knees week. Your imagine is fatigued your imagine can be broken your imagine is fatigued your imagine can be broken. I stand behind every god dam word that I have spoken.
