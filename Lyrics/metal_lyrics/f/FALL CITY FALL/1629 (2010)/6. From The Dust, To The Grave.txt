I never thought that it would ever come down to this
Will you come and take this pain from me or have you come to set me free?
And I was hoping you would be the one who came to save me
Will you run and turn your back on me or have you come to be the one who sets me free?

So this is it 
The world has finally won, it's finally brought me to my knees
How could I forget that it's the fear that they seek
And they feast on the weak
And they beg and they scream for a chance of relief
For one moment of speech.

Look at me, I'm not the man I used to be
Look in my eyes, what do you see? 
Comfort in familiar surroundings
Look at me, I'm not the man I used to be
If these walls could talk maybe you'd see
I'm not the man I used to be.
So bury your head with thoughts of regret 
And you'll never expect water rising higher, making circles around your neck
And they feast on the weak
And they beg and they scream for a chance of relief 
For one moment of speech
Will you take this pain from me? Will you take everything?
Do you really think you're ready for what's ahead?

I never thought that it would ever come down to this
Set me free! Set me free!
And I was hoping you would be the one who came to save me
Will you run and turn your back on me or have you come to be the one who sets me free?

I got these vampires leaving the city streets scarred
For as long as I remember never seen no stars 
And like trapped behind bars never seemed so hard 
To simply let out and be what's within our hearts
And I tried so damn hard to find the words to describe how I feel inside 
So for the last time my last regret 
My last words, my breath
Follows me to the gallows beneath.
