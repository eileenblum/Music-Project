With my pale eyes i behold the sky,
full of deathâ¦

Disgrace the bastard son of god!

The night descents to the shadowlands,
And on the wings of evil we ride, destroying the weak,
breeding pain and misery.

Life, my only enemy, is finally withering away.
I have found the wisdom of Satan, and my peace in death
