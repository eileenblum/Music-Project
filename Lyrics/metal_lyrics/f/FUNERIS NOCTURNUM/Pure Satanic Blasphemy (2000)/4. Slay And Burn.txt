I have raised from the hellfire, i am the tormentor.
In nomine satanas.
Everlasting torment it will be,
to everyone who does not kneel in front of Lucifer.

I will burn you at the stakes, where is your christ now?
I will pierce your holy flesh, your christ can't help you now.
I'm the raper of your jesus fucking christ!
I summon the darkness, and the army of Satan.
Unleash the demons, and the war will begin.
I have no doubt that who will win, the child of god cries his pain,
and finally, the cross will be inverted.

I am the raer of your jesus fucking christ!

I will burn you at the stakes, where is your christ now?
I will pierce your holy flesh, your christ can't help you now.
I'm the raper of your jesus fucking christ!
I summon the darkness, and the army of Satan.
Unleash the demons, and the war will begin.
I have no doubt that who will win.
The child of god cries his pain, gloria satanas!

Unleash the demons, and the war will begin.
WE WILL WIN!
