Hearken to me, 
for i am fucking you precious guardian angels!

Dreadful and disgusting, the concrete form of your innermost fears.
I am everything you try to deny, a beast that is fully alive.

From the ethereal oceans i arise,
as the deadliest of all plagues i contribute to your demise.
Beware my presence!
I am both, the hammer of Satan, 
and the nails that are driven through your faith.

My blasphemous words are the salt in his (christ) wounds,
but my deeds of hatred are what made them bleed again.

I serve my master and obly his commands.
I invert all the "beauty" shaped by divine hands.
Me essence is of the sinful steams of hell.
I spit at the grace from which i once fell.

Indeed, i am the wayâ¦but to what direction?
Follow me and i will throw you down to the agonies.
Slaves you were and slaves you will always be,
sodomized by Satan from this moment to eternity.

"I am both, the hammer of Satan,
and the nails that are driven through your chest".
