you forget that i remember when we got drunk,
when we got dumped, who you loved and who you fucked
but thats just growing up
stolen glances and fucked up chances
i feel so removed from my youth
i never moved on i just gave up
we spend year to year
wasting our lives from pier to pier
were not growing up
were just growing
squeeze blood from all the stones on the beach
and put this part of our lives to peace
while the sea swallows the sun whole
lets forget this place was ever our home
i never moved on i just gave up
we spend year to year
wasting our lives from pier to pier
were not growing up
were just growing
i found myself at the bottom of these bottles,
dwelling on the past and what i have become,
theres no future here and i have to leave,
these streets, these streets, these streets
offer nothing to me
but I'm still searching for a way out
i could follow this coast into a shallow grave
