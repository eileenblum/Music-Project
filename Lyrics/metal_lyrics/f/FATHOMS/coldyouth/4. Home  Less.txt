standing next to what I used to call home
the windows look so much brighter from the outside
like tinted eyes holding everything behind
I'm leaving everything behind.
regrets, resentment, repetition
more than you'll ever know
regrets, resentment, repetition
and thats a feeling close to home
so many times I've dragged myself back here
from fights, through addiction
and you've never had a fucking clue
I've had to learn the hard way
and raise myself into the man I am today
you dealt me selfish when I needed selfless
you dealt me selfish when I needed selfless
one foot in front of the other
with more than a chip on my shoulder
they say blood this thicker than water,
but ill be drinking something stronger tonight.
I'm sick and tired of coming back to this place,
I'm turning my back and washing my hands,
of you and this fucking house
I'll burn you to the ground
it was that day I promised
to keep my heart separate from you
the only thing that connect us is the
second name I was born into
