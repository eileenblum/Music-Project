ill stand with my head held high,
and never regret as years go by,
until you sweep me out like an ocean,
and I'm gone with the tide.
i can't tell the difference between the breeze
and the air that you breathe through your teeth,
but your words are like hurricanes,
and I'm gone with the wind.

take this disgust from my lungs
or show me how its done
please take this detest from my chest
take this disgust from my lungs
or show me how its done
replace it with what you think is best

i haven't breathed in weeks
and i haven't slept in years
here i am again
pushing forwards towards dead ends

take this disgust from my lungs
or show me how its done
please take this detest from my chest
take this disgust from my lungs
or show me how its done
replace it with what you think is best

have we lost our pride?
have we lost our dignity?
its these thoughts inside they're fucking killing me
have we lost our pride?
have we lost our dignity?
its these thoughts inside they're fucking killing me

ill be a better man
ill be the best man i can be
have faith in me
just stay with me

ill be the best man i can be
