I used to have so much to say,
I got lost in my words and your letters,
and nothing could say it better than,
you stand for everything that I'm against
and I've learned the hard way theres no such thing as love,
you trick your mind to trick your soul,
live together, die alone
this isn't death from above,
this is death from the ground up
I've watched, I've waited
I've lost, I've created
I've seen, I've conquered
I've been, I'm nothing
and I've learned the hard way theres no such thing as love,
you trick your mind to trick your soul,
live together die alone
its these deep set thoughts in my head,
that every word i speak will be forgotten in the end
you've had so much time to reinvent,
that I don't know where your beginning ends
I hear we all die with secrets
