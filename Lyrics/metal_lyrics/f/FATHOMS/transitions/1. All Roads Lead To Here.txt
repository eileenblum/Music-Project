Pass me the telescope, your all i see
i cant look in any other direction.
Looking at the future through glass eyes,
im fucking loosing it.
Im holding on to you like a fucking hand grenade,
all roads lead to here and i cant believe its come to this.

Brace for impact

Now all i see is,
Her face. Your name.
I cant breathe, how can i go on when you
drew the map, how can i go further now?

Now when you try and look for me x marks the spot,
try and find me,
and when i look at you i see a skull and cross.

Im so fucking lost, and you were my compass
how can i go on, when you drew the map
try and find me, x marks the spot.
