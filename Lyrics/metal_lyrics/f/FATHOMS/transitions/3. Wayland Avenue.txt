Three years down the line and im in the same place,
Three years down,
empty bottles and empty promises
- what i'd give to be back when everything was still so simple.

So far away from all of this.

I can't be in this place anymore,
and these are the things I
kept
to
myself.
I exhale the past like a knife through the heart,
and now im holding every breath i take.

The days go on, the nights grow longer.

But still im surrounded with,
a fucking emptiness.
I gave up on myself, too many times,
watched the world pass, and got left behind.

But I cant go back in time.

I'd still take your hand
and im holding onto a part of me thats gone.

I walk with a cloud above my head,
and move forward with a hole in my chest.

The days go on, the nights grow longer.
