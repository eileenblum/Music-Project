Every fight, the sleepless nights,
bloodshot eyes &amp; blackened lungs.
You never knew right from wrong.

Always asking if i remember,
how the fuck could i forget?

Your burnt out words, barely breathing.
Your out in the open,
With hidden meaning.

You leave me fucking speechless.

Standing on broken legs to start again,
I remember when I needed you to hold me together.
But all that you could do,
was stand on your own two feet,
now this is all thats left of me.

Every hour, ever day, every month,
another unwritten chapter,
forgotten in a book,
of empty pages.
And if this is fate,
and we were meant to meet,
i'll choose my own destiny.

Your twisted tongue punch the words through the cracks,
and bruise your teeth.

Every hour, ever day, every month,
another unwritten chapter,
forgotten in a book,
of empty pages.
And if this is fate,
and we were meant to meet,
i'll choose my own destiny.

I'm only human,
but god i tried.
I tried to make this right,
This ends tonight.
