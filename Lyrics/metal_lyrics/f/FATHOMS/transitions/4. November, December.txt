What we once had has fallen, who are you to me?
Who you are now stands for nothing, who are you to me?

I look into your eyes, and I see your forked tongue
you never regretted any fucking mistake,
go eat a dick bitch.

You kept putting words in my mouth, I kept spitting them out.

Cracked ribs and broken thoughts, all thats left of who i was.

I saw your true colours, and i was blinded,
now tell me, can you see the light?

I've had too much time to myself, letting go of my own intentions.
This city holds the memories, and i never want to walk these streets again.
