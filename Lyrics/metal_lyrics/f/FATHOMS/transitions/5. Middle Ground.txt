[feat. Chad Ruhlig Of Legend]Memories stuck to your mirror, could never hold us together,
i want you to explain yourself now
but if you sweat it out im sure that we'll both drown.

Time and time again,
I've looked through your eyes,
Seen the mistakes, the lifeless routine,
And watched you look back with guilt.

It's been so long since then, but that doesn't change a thing,
motherfucker.
The lies, the regret and everything you still expect from me.
This will be the biggest mistake of your fucking life.
So tell me, how's this for regrets?

And i Know that you think these streets are paved with gold,
But baby, i can see the cracks.

I wont go back to hell.
I wont go back to hell.

But would you still meet me there, under these clouds?
Because everytime it rains i hear you calling me,
and everytime i see the sun i pray for dusk.

[Chad Ruhlig - Legend:]

The days and months have blurred together and i cant remember the last time i saw your smile.

Keep running your fucking mouth,
Keep talking shit about me,
These walls are thin, and i can hear the hissing.

Time and time again,
I've looked through your eyes,
Seen the mistakes, the lifeless routine,
And watched you look back with guilt.

I'm standing on the edge of your whole fucking world,
and it would be weightless without me.
