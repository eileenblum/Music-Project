Remember when we were kings?
We ruled this land, sailing the seas,
we owned the night - vowed never to sleep.
I made a promise to return to my queen.
And none of you motherfuckers, could ever touch this crown.

Hit the fucking deck.

Thoughts i cant even put into words,
memories of every night, every face and every girl
places i'll never go to, people ill never see again.

These dreams we once had weren't built to last forever.

White knuckles on clenched fists, this is my memory of you.
