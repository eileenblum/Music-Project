pacing the room that never seemed so long until now
watching you struggle as you hold on for your way out
and as you took your last breath
I wonder the thoughts that circled your head
and as you took your last breath
I wonder the thoughts that circled your head


I get caught up on
all the times we never spent
and I canât help but think
is there life before death?


no matter how high the moon
or how deep the sea
I would endure it all
to bring you back to me

if you were here now youâd show me how
to find my way out
if you were here now youâd show me how
to find my way out
your blood and mine flows through the same line
you were a part of me that I always hoped that I could be

everything's said and done
I know youâve been and gone

you were a part of me that I always hoped that I could be
