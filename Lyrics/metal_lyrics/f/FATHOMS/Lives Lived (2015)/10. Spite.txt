I am the constant that has been placed here
and I've been watching this sunset for years
Despite the ruins this world remains unchanged,
I know the minutes pass but the memories stay the same
I live in fear
I can't find my release

youâre twisting tongues and turning me insane
Trying to swim back into your veins
and I would bring plague and floods
just to be the boiling in your blood

your like a fist to the face
a gunshot to the chest
I can't keep trying to erase
because this is all I have left

I'm a broken down shell
I'm a wreck I'm a mess
but I'm still twice the man that I was back then

KICK IT

youâre twisting tongues and turning me insane
Trying to swim back into your veins
and I would bring plague and floods
just To be the boiling in your blood
and I can feel it heating up
reaching the melting point but I won't stop
time keeps ticking as I rot
I used to care so much and now I couldn't give a fuck

This is a secret you'll never keep
I'll tell you a place we'll never meet
Your a song that's on repeat
I was stuck in your loop tapping my feet
It took a while to realise life keeps on ticking
And I don't want to miss a fucking beat
