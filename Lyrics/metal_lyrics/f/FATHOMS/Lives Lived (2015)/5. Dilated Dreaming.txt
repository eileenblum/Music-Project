my world is lost
I cant recall my past
in a flash I'm so far removed
from anything that came before
can you remember me
can you remember me
where do I begin
and where the fuck will this end

I just don't recognise myself anymore
this isn't the person I remember
I got so lost in trying to forget
and you think that you know me best
I'm not myself anymore
and you think that you know me best
I'm not myself anymore

I just don't recognise myself anymore
this isn't the person I remember
this isn't who I want to be

I sometimes lye awake wondering
how you sleep at night
I'll be day dreaming while you lay sleeping
of how I'm a mess all dressed up
don't tell me who the fuck I should be
I may be lost but I'm not forgotten
don't tell me who the fuck I should be
I'll never turn my back

wake me up from what I've become
wake me up from what I've become
you live and learn
wake me up from what I've become
I'm living but I'm not learning
wake me up from what I've become

growing up and feeling no love
do you ever hate this person that you've become
am I condemned to be free,
a man is what he wills himself to be.
I tried to find myself in the bigger picture,
 but I still need time

I sometimes lye awake wondering
how you sleep at night
I'll be day dreaming while you lay sleeping
of how I'm a mess all dressed up
don't tell me who the fuck I should be
I may be lost but I'm not forgotten
don't tell me who the fuck I should be
I'll never turn my back

my head spirals and circles
like tornadoes and whirlpools
I could never desert you
my head spirals and circles
like tornadoes and whirlpools
I could never desert you
I don't deserve this
dead men tell no tales but I'm still talking
and I wear these scars like a crutch but I'm still walking
maybe I've just been over thinking
maybe I've just been over thinking
maybe I've just been over thinking
maybe I've just been over thinking
