Just because your breathing it doesn't mean your living
I know your talking but your not speaking your mind
and although your walking we're not moving forward
so you can look at the clock but I'll make the most of my time

I'll keep telling everyone I'm fine
watch as the mistakes of my life align
how can I feel anything
when I love and hate at the same time

whats the difference between closing your eyes and being blind
is sleeping dreaming
is fucking loving
I'm fucking hating what I'm becoming
My heads revolves around these thoughts like a planet to the sun
is sleeping dreaming
is fucking loving
I'm fucking hating what I'm becoming

Drowning in an hourglass
I could go against the grain
do it again, do it again
I can turn my whole world upside down
but time always catches up with me

whats the difference between closing your eyes and being blind
is sleeping dreaming
is fucking loving
I'm fucking hating what I'm becoming
My heads revolves around these thoughts like a planet to the sun
is sleeping dreaming
is fucking loving
I'm fucking hating what I'm becoming

There's just so many places I wanna
be with so many people I wanna
see everything, share all of this
And be infinite.

can you imagine
just for a second
that everything is how it was meant to be,
how this was meant to be
