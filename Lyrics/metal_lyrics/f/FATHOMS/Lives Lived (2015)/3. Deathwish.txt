I know if there's a hell
I've made it for myself
I know if there's a hell
I've made it for myself

DEATHWISH
drink up throw down
middle fingers up lets get another round
DEATHWISH
till the rooms spinning
or my life's finished
I'm singing
DEATHWISH
drink up throw down
middle fingers up lets get another round
DEATHWISH
fuck the world
die slow

I'm drowning my demons with nothing to believe in
on these streets I can feel myself sinking
Every night drinking until I can't feel
this will be the death of me

It's just something I can't help
But It makes me feel myself.
It's just something I can't help
But It makes me feel myself.

DEATHWISH
drink up throw down
middle fingers up lets get another round
DEATHWISH
till the rooms spinning
or my life's finished
I'm singing
DEATHWISH
drink up throw down
middle fingers up lets get another round
DEATHWISH
fuck the world
slow

save me, from myself

The Ghosts of our past never go away
So I'll drink your spirit straight
I cant walk, I cant talk, I cant think,
I'll stare at my feet while you pour me drink
my head spins as I go insane
lets "cheers" our best years down the drain

The Ghosts of our past
never go away
So I'll drink your spirit straight

I know if there's a hell
I've made it for myself
