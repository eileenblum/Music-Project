tonight we just don't give a fuck
so lets get another round
we come up just like the sun
and we go down when the night is done

a night I wont remember
with people I can't forget

as we hit the fucking streets
I'm homesick for a place I've never been
I swear I'll never sleep

I've found a short term solution
to a long standing problem
so if I drink and get high
while the world passes me by
I can still see the sky shine
when I close my eyes
forget about this life and try to find
a way to keep me blind

as we hit the fucking streets
I'm homesick for a place I've never been
and the
debauchery
is catching up with me

when you can't look after yourself
how the fuck can anyone else?

step by step
I feel my feet loose their grip
on the streets that I grew up in
day by day
I feel myself fade away
what meant so much to me has changed
breath by breath
I feel the air leave my chest
and all I have to look back on is regret
