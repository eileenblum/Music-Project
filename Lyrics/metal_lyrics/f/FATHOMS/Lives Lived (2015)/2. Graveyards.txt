Iâm trying to see things clearly
when Iâve never got a clear head
so tired of skeletons in closets
and its become too routine if Iâm honest

Where does your loyalty lie?
You need to get your priorities right
Life ainât about starting fights or taking sides
so cut the shit or just keep breaking ties

THIS PLACE IS SO DEAD
ITâS LIKE A GRAVEYARD THE WAY YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH
AND NOW YOUâRE CHOKING
ON ALL THE THINGS YOU NEVER SAID

You took all that was left of me and turned it into what I swore I'd never be
We live in parallels and your so fucking dead to me

you trust the corruption
Iâll rely on my senses
we've lost our direction in need of redemption
I've seen what lies beneath the surface

THIS PLACE IS SO DEAD
ITâS LIKE A GRAVEYARD THE WAY YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH
AND NOW YOUR CHOKING
ON ALL THE THINGS YOU NEVER SAID

death is certain
life is not
instead of living to die letâs live this life just to be alive
is my time wasted?
is my life fated?

keep looking forwards and moving backwards
I know exactly where this is going

so don't stab me in the back and ask me why Iâm bleeding

THIS PLACE IS SO DEAD
ITâS LIKE A GRAVEYARD THE WAY YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH
AND NOW YOUR CHOKING
ON ALL THE THINGS YOU NEVER SAID

THIS PLACE IS FUCKING DEAD
