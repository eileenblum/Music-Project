your delusions are beyond me, can you see the suffering?
your blind in your insight whats wrong and what is right,
if you were on the front line would you stand up and fight

paint your perfect picture of the world
and I'll paint myself out,
turn your head,
blind your eyes,
shrug it off your shoulders,
you fucking cowards

the moneys in the medicine
not the fucking cure
while the most ignorant
are finding peace in war

I feel the weight
of the world
and I know I can't hold on
much longer
I'm collapsing
(its too much/this is wrong/till collapse/I can't fix this)
we could sail this ship alone
and still have mutinies
so step up, step up, step up
step up for what you believe

YOUR HEAVEN
MY HELL
YOUR GOD
MY DEVIL

DIE YOUNG AND SUFFER

fuck the powers,
fuck the leaders,
fuck the ignorant,
if you feel how I feel,
you are not alone
fuck the powers,
fuck the leaders,
fuck the ignorant,
you know this is wrong

I feel the weight
of the world
and I know I can't hold on
much longer
I'm collapsing
(its too much/this is wrong/till collapse/I can't fix this)
we could sail this ship alone
and still have mutinies
so step up, step up, step up
step up for what you believe

this isn't where I need to be
can you see the suffering

no backing down, this is the end.
