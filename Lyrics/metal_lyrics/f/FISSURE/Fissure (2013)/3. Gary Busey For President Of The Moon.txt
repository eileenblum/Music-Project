Are you living for yourself
Or are you trying your hardest
To fulfill everyoneâs ridiculous expectations?

Who gives two shits about how much your shit stinks?

Subliminal whispers up in the sky
The clouds are talking to you
Lifeless drone programmed to obey
Bend over &amp; say
"Yes sir, may I have another?"
