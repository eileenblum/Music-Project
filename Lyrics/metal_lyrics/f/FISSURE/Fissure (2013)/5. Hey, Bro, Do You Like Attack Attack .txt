Smiles have long gone
Life has become this stale
Used up film reel, ready to burn
Burn
See if I care

I can't stand
Same painted faces
Chipping away with time
Save your lifeless stares
For when you're dead

The redundancy has drained every single drop of my essence
You'll see a smile on my face when you see me fly or die
