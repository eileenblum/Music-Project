Sentenced to silence, blamed for all sins
Reaching to darkness, burning my skin
Saved by no one, forgotten instead
One sacred angel, one sold to the hell

Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall

Burning in fever, holy I become
My religion is fire, endless I become
Devils and angels, the pit and the cloud
My ashes and dust, feeding the cursed ground

Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall

Walk with me, burn with me
Into this lake of thousand flames
Let yourself to drink my pain
Swallow it up and be empty again

Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall
