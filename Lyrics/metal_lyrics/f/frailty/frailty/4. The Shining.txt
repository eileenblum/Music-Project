The devil outside and sorrow enters my home
Waiting so silent and black hours pass
Tearing my mind from my dying soul

They come, they go and kill
The wretched shades after the rain
In this world a dying stare
I canât help you to your grave
No one calling my name
Filthy man designed for blame
Reborn once again from the dust
To strive once more for the lust

The devil outside and emptiness rise
Waiting so silent to my demise
Licking my wounds and caressing me

They come, they go and kill
The wretched shades after the rain
In this world a dying stare
I canât help you to your grave

Daggers like teeth bites my body
Savaged by their anger and hatred
Scorned by the world to the end

Lock away the silent cry
See the light so deep inside
Whore and liar dressed in blight
Eyes are closed mouth cannot sighâ¦
