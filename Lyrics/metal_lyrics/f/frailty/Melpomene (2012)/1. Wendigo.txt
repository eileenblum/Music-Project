Running in this ice storm
Feet has had no rest since the start
He will feed on human flesh
Teeth grin with blood
Rot, pain, gore, death

This is the dreadful night
Grave spiritâs possessed body
Wendigo wailing in the voice of the wind
Your soul will be swept away

Doom lurks behind those trees
Snow will cover the dead body
Arise from the shadows, the skeletal form
In this winter, the hunger is forever

Snow will cover my sins
Red as blood, my own blood
Voice in the wind calls our doom
I see the dead eyes burning me

This is the sad and painful truth
Grave hungerâs possessed body
Will become demonic and foul
Grim human nature, our sins red as the blood

We are the Hell, weâll be the Death
Weâll be the Death!
We are the Hell, weâll be the Death, weâll be the Death,
The Hell itself!!!
