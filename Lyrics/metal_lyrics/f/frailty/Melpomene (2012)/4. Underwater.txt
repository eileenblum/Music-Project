His eyes, his hands
Upwards to distant sky
Coldness is eternal
Darkness is not a blessing
Pressure he endures
Underwater, away from sight
Without his children
His name is effigy to them

His thoughts above the liquid
To the wretched shore where they live
Cast him in, the darkness calls his name
Forget the time when he was something else
Than stone...

The will to live
Arise anew and be
The deep is pulsing
Echoes silent, agonizing
Darkness may be a blessing
Coldness his dearest friend
His children equal scum
His name is strange to them
