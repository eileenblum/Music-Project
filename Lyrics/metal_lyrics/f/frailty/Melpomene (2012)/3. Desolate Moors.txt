The shadow of tonightâs insomnia
Takes me to the lonely land
Of desolate moors and silence

Away from the city lights
Forgotten the whoresâ thirsty lips
Beyond the walls of glass and concrete
To much more deeper senses

Primeval and dark, unrecalled silence
Unified with memories from a bleak childhood
I came here to die, at least in my thoughts
Seeking the silence to a motionless state
The wind is the weeper above my fallen body
Cold smell of decay portraits the face of the night
Dressed in the far away echoes of memories

My song burns out upon this dark landscape
Silence
Silence is everything
Silence
She is everything
