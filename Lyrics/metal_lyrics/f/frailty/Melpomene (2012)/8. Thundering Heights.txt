Towards where
The gods and eagles dare
Away from this curse
Of infinite pain
The thundering heights,
Above the mankindâs creation
Cold Olympus
In mortal visions of desperation

Breastfed with bloody milk to make them heroes
Raised to make a stand for something

Remember how you were down
Amid the ignorant crowd

Oh, the solemn majesty
Of high mountains
Dreams rush to your
Powerful silence
We kneel and we die
We are all ashamed...
Knowing our hidden weakness

(Struggles brought to naught by the higher hand
Close your eyes repent and bleed)

Remember how you were down
Amid the ignorant crowd

I would kill my brother
Just to get higher above them
I would betray my father
Just to see that the stars are mine
Nothing is sacred when we climb up
The mountain of these earthly treasures
Flesh and gold, swords and pride
Commit your soul to the fire

Remember how you were down
Amid the ignorant crowd!
