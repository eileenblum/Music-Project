Enter the doomed halls
Of eternal damnation
Where your nothingness
Meets its end
Dreadful chambers of agony
Putrefied mass to cover your body
Sorrow is like a tender mother to care
When all is lost, this sadness remains...

Majesty in this end of yours
Embrace the destiny of martyrdom
Madness is carried within the streams of life
To rule your thoughts with an iron whip
Enchained in unmerciful coldness
Crying for the loved ones who are gone
Mystery of eternal sleep of nightmares
Is carried away with the flow of the rivers
To the gray oceans polluted with tears
