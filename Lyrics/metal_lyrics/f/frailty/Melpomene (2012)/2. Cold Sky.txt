Awaken under the sky
Clear sky, but so cold

Where the sky grows
The angels mourn
Their hearts are torn
Cold sky, my empty home

Faces, lost and empty shapes
You among the bitter lies
Our time is passing by
Beneath the cold grey sky

The rotting begins from inside
The light of your life,
The depths of your eyes
Unhide the horrible truth divine
We are lost to each other
Taken away by this night
