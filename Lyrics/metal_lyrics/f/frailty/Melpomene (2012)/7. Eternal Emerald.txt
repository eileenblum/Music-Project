Sing the ageless song
Brake the chains of reason
The sword in your hand
Will guide you through

Christened by blood
The life-giving sparkle wonât fade
The eternal emerald shines
Old fairy tales return from the dust

Decay and the rust wonât break the heart
You will never die in my dreams
If something is truly forever
Itâs the fire between us

Sing the ageless song
Brake the chains of reason
The sword in your hand
Will guide you through
The night is feral
The trees seem alive
Howling of nightmares
Dead shadows you must fight

Enthralled by your eyes
This sorrow is mine
All this pain is mine
Cry for me when the winds come
The storms never die
The storms never die

I wept for my loss of this moment
The magical chalice lies broken
Grieve over light that is stolen
The kingdom of dreams has fallen

Christened by blood
The life-giving sparkle wonât fade
The eternal emerald shines
Old fairy tells return from the dust

Decay and the rust wonât break the heart
You will never die in my dreams
If something is truly forever
Itâs the fire between us
