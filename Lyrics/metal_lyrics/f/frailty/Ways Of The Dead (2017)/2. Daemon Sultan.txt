The Cosmos is burning - black radiance scorching 
The Void swirling â feverish madness dancing 
The Blind God is piping â evil from the blistering mouth 
Carve your eyes out â the idiots are rejoicing now 

The music unholy â drums beating faster 
The rhythmic destruction â insane reconstruction 
The Cosmos is trembling and the souls enter madness 
Unspeakable terror in the center of the creation 

My own thoughts are not safe anymore 
Of what I have read and what I have seen 
In old wicked texts and the scrolls of wisdom 
Above the stars in the oceans of the infinity 

In the kingdom of the Daemon Sultan 
Dance along the idiots! 

My own thoughts are not safe anymore 
For I have seen and felt the insanity of it all 
The endless piping from the flute of the Idiot God 
Echoes through Cosmos and the vast deserts of mind
