The night fires are blazing in distance 
And murmuring echoes dance upon sands 
I know your presence, sweet love of my youth 
But now your eyes are lifeless and coldâ¦ 

I can remember now how we embraced 
The love and the lust of our young age 
Torn away by betrayal and torture 
The sympathy lost, engulfed by all evils 

So black as its creatorâs heart 
Only the corpses are left behind by its venom 
Not of this world, the creature of malice 
The scorpionâs gift, the death from the desert 

This is my gift to the love of my youth 
I will rejoice in mournersâ laments 
The night has come, and I watch from the shadows 
How they embalm your corpse in the honeyâ¦ 

And who can count 
The stars 
Above her tomb?
