Oh, Egypt! Great was the power of your pharaohs 
Still stronger the power of your dark wizards! 

Only the madmen enters in tombs of wizards 
Where dreadful silence keeps their secrets 
The air is thickened with terrible anger 
Potent relics guarded by curses 

Three black gifts 
Fear, hunger, madness 
Through pain and sorrow 
Brought me great wisdom 

Oh, desert moon! You witnessed the burials 
Guide me by your light to find what I seek! 

Only the madmen enters in tombs of wizards 
Where mind is challenged by terror 
The essence of darkness overcomes soul 
Make haste and leave before itâs too late! 

I am the madman, who enters the tombs 
Embraced by fear, but hungry for secrets 
In the trails of the serpents I make my way in 
To find my destiny or my damnation! 

Three black gifts 
Fear, hunger, madness 
Through pain and sorrow 
Brought me great wisdom
