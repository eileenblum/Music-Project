IÓ, Shub-Nigurrath! 
She of countless sins... 
Her fertile womb dripping in blackened seeds 
In beauty she descends to fool the mortal man 
With torment she ascends to take all life with her 

In dreams of lust she visits us from dark 
She beastly kisses to adorn the chosen one 
The evil spawns inside of her cursed womb 
Damned be her name, as damned is this night 

In darkest wombs of earth, from her the evils rise 
Fear her silent nightly shades, for they bring pain 
When light are naught and your mouthâs mute 
In terror you embrace her with nothing more to loseâ¦
