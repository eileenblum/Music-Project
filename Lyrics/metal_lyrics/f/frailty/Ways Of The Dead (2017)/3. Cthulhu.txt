Sleep broken by whispers 
Whispers haunting dreams 
Dark dreams exhausting 
The weak and fragile sanity 

Away across the tides 
Your cursed tomb awaits 
Dead but never gone 
Calling through my sleep 

Whispers in silence 
Visions of madness 
Signs of power 
In wait of rising 

That day is coming 
Dark depths will shatter 
The stars will crumble 
From all your might 

Demonical apocalypse 
Tyrant's sleeping wrath awakened 
The high priest of the Old Ones 
The wolf to rule the sheep 

Who will stand in the way? 
Cities of men will fall to dust 
New hymns will be sung 
By unhuman tongues 

Whispers calling away 
Cold and dark whispers 
To unknown places 
To unknown madness
