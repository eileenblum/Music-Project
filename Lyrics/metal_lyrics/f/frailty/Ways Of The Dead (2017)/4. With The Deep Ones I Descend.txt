Father Dagon! Murky oceans calling 
In darkest abyss thy spawn will prosper! 
Slithering and immortal 
Haunting the depths of madness 

Fathoms deep below the oceanâs crushing waves 
In coral castles the blasphemy ignites 
I am enchanted by the ancient magic of the waters 
With the Deep ones I descend! 

Father, your cult is growing stronger every day 
With savage rites of worship and of sacrifice 
To gain the wealth they give their daughters 
Unite the races through undying breed 

Fathoms deep below the oceanâs crushing waves 
In coral castles the blasphemy ignites 
I am enchanted by the ancient magic of the waters 
With the Deep ones I descend! 

Father, murky oceans calling! 
Deep below the crushing waves 
To your madness I descend! 

The murky depths are calling me to leave the land behind 
To Father Dagon, to his coral throne of power! 
I am enchanted by the ancient madness of the waters 
With the Deep Ones I descend! 

The madness reigns! 
The Abyss claims you! 
The Water is your grave! 
This is the end!
