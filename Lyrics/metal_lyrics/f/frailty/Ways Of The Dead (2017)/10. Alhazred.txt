Pain is greater teacher of men 
Than delights and peaceful life 
Call to the wind, to the heralds of despair 
To bring you truth, and solemn end 

I have suffered the fate of rejection 
Endured in torment and starvation 
I know the Old Ones and their dark ways 
My verses burn with revelations 

I have walked the endless sands 
In the presence of the Crawling Chaos 
And I have lost all I had in this life 
The ghouls and vultures bare the witness 

Soul torn apart by primal fears 
Is the key to the path of the sages 
One must learn the lessons well 
The mad infinity is waiting always 

I have ventured beyond the dreams 
And I have tasted things forbidden 
I have heard a thousand souls cry out 
In the wings of flies upon the carrion 

The destiny has many ways to hurt 
And plenty still to grant rewards 
And who can tell what is to come 
Strange eons passing to oblivionâ¦ 

Donât close your eyes at night 
Let fear and madness guide you 
Embrace the truth of solitude 
Devour everythingâ¦
