Protected by the night I do my work 
Safe by the seals of power and colossal wealth 
Slaves will drag the bodies to the cellar 
The knowledge of the dead I shall obtain! 

Dead flesh returns to life again 
In rituals of arcane wisdom 
There is no death that shall withstand 
The arts of grave I can command 

Boil the mummies in the kettle 
Extract the salts essential 
Raise the body, use the torture 
Gain the wisdom, dump the corpse 

Dead flesh returns to life again 
In rituals of arcane wisdom 
There is no death that shall withstand 
The arts of grave I can command 

Damascus â the jewel of the desert 
Scholarsâ work guarded by its walls 
Within the nights of studies 
Melancholy of the emptiness 
Holds me in her loving arms 

Damascus â the jewel of the desert 
Scholarsâ work guarded by its walls 
Within the nights of studies 
Melancholy of the emptiness 
Holds me, holds me, holds meâ¦
