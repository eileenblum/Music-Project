The ancient road leads me onward 
To the ruins of the great Babylon 
Terror lives where once kings reveled in splendor 
In the darkness hides the unholy thing 

With leather wings and screaming seven human heads 
The night sky plagued by the spawn of Shub-Nigurrath! 
The eater of the flesh and souls, forever cursed by men 
The fear you bring can blind the weak, unknowing of your secret! 

The Elder Sign protects me; the wrath of stars is in my hand 
The monster's anger kept at bay, its evil weak against my wisdom 
Come forth Balaka, the ancient wizard, let your mouth speak 
Of untold secrets and hidden places beyond the space and time 

Upon the monster's back I must fly away 
To distant mountains beyond this world 

The Umal root, that brings the life 
Your healing power I now gather 
To raise the body from the death itself 
Restore the mind from deepest madness! 

Great secrets are revealed to those 
Who cast away the fear 
Who dare to seek old Babylon 
And face its beast in darkness!
