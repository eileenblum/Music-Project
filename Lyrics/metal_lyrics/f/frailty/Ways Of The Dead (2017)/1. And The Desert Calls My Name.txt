And the desert calls my name 
Empty but feared by many 
Godlike in the waste I am 
Cherish this forever 

Loneliness is my kingdom 
Emptiness is my seat of kings 
My dreaming is my escape 
My wisdom drinks from fear 

And the night haunts my soul 
Filled with reverence and terror 
The souls of dead encircle me 
As I slowly pass awayâ¦ 
Death is closing my weary eyes 
Sweet is her touch when we are alone 
Together as lovers counting the hours 
Of final tenderness before the dawn 

And the desert calls my name 
In deadly silence I take my throne 
Cherish this leaving foreverâ¦ 
As I never did
