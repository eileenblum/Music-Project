I know your pain
Like no one else does
Iâll stay with you
Until your silence comes

Wind talks in the grass
Beneath our feet
Above our heads
In the weeping trees

Iâll stay with you
On this day we lost
We paid the price
That we feared most

Gone is the joy
Into the Stygian void
The sky bleeding the rain
The soil shutters in pain

I know you all
Like no one else does
So it makes it easy
To kiss last goodbye
Kill you in sadness
But still keeping the smileâ¦
