Natureâs own heart.
Behold, the true redemption!
Days passing by, resting alone.
Sweet light and a perfect summer to die.
Her love is a thorn. In my own heart.
And the heat flows like a stream...
To drink her up.
To know her deep.
Watching her.
Wanting her.
Taking her body.
Sweet light and a perfect summer to die...
