Bleak sculptures in the twilight of the fall
Beyond beauty are the visions of mine
Dark is the majestic crown of autumn fade
Such a strange song weeps in my mind

Glory of past days when we ruled
A thousand battles did we won by sword
My brothers lay down in death
Tarnished their armor, souls forgotten by time
By timeâ¦

Recall who I was
Damnation we gained
In the season of fall
Desolation I reap

Fade to salvation, inside is the pain
No hope for future, night takes the day
