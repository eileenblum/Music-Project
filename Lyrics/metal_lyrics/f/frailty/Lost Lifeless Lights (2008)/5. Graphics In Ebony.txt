She takes me down. Crushing, burning
Never released. Destiny fading
Her mind is darkened. Bleakness, forgiveness
Enchantingâ¦.

For your fall. Insane, black hearted
So far away. Desolate, mesmerized
Sleep to be free. Atrocity, savagery
In her heart

To the silent gloom
I give up my hope
Lunatic eyes
Stare at me
Count the restless dreams
Spent drinking the poison
Misery takes me
Over againâ¦

Home far away, lights forgotten
For hours I have been breathing
The tranquility of the dark forest
I have never seen it before
And I go deeper in the shadows
Searching for her horrors
Insanity that brought me to my knees

And there she was
Pure evil substance
Black like the raven
Slimy and cold

Bright graphics in ebony
Her eyes burning with fever
All the horrors Iâve known
All brought my doom

To the silent gloom
I give up my hope
Lunatic eyes
Stare at me
Count the restless dreams
Spent drinking the poison
Misery takes me
Over againâ¦
