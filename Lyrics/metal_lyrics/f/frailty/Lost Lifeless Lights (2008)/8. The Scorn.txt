Take my eyes
I cannot watch myself
In this tomb of pain
Farewell, my love

Hurting mind, blackened heart
I am a vessel of hate itself
Fallen god, mindless herd
Searing flames ascend
Destructionâ¦ of wisdom
Flowers wither beneath our feet
As we die the slow death
Entwinedâ¦ forever

Take my eyes
I cannot watch myself
In this tomb of pain
Farewell, my love

Stay with me, donât let me go
Itâs cold and dark, say you wonât leave
Stars will fall, we will die
Not a tear will be shed for usâ¦
