Ariadne, sweet angel of mine
The light of the stars hides in your eyes
Ariadne, sweet angel of mine
Will your death be mine?

Bleeding for you, as you cry for me
Silent your waters are rest here with me
Crestfallen are your nightfall eyes
Celestial tears like the stars in the night
Autumnal darkness of sin and of woe
Kissing the frailty of your dreams
Emptiness and the passionate soul
Godâs heavy hand to bring your sleep

Ariadne, sweet angel of mine
Secrets and horrors hides in your mind
Ariadne, sweet angel of mine
Let your death be mine

Ariadne, dark angel of mine
Let your darkness be mine
Ariadne, dark angel of mine
Will in our death we be entwined?
