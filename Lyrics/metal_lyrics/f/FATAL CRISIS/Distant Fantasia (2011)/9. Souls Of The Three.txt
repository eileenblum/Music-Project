[Anthony Driverson &amp; Aleksey Alexx777 Yevseyev]

Iâm a steppe eagle
Iâm hovering over the land
Looking for the prey so evil
That it dared to come to my territoryâ¦
Donât step on my sand!

I see everythingâ¦

As a father of a family
I must feed and protect my off springs
Today Iâm the master of these cliffs!
And still I donât know my destinyâ¦
But Iâll face it! In reality and dreams.

[Refrain:]
Proudly spreading the wings
They shot up in the skies
Souls of the three are kings
United in eternal rise
Though they are different
Wild, singing and of prey
They are due to guard the Skies together
Until their last feather
Touches the ground on the Doomsday.

Iâm a raven, Iâm a herald
Many creatures fear me
But not everyone knows
I bring not only bad news to theeâ¦

I know everything

(The raven cries
The raven beats the air with its wings)
He brings water of life from the edge of the world
(The raven cries
The raven beats the air with its wings)
The wise bird brings the heroes to life.

[Refrain:]
Proudly spreading the wings
They shot up in the skies
Souls of the three are kings
United in eternal rise
Though they are different
Wild, singing and of prey
They are due to guard the Skies together
Until their last feather
Touches the ground on the Doomsday.

Iâm a swift-winged hawk
Slicing through the air
I have my prey to stalk
Beware of me, beware

I hear everythingâ¦

My hymn of victory
Is a melodic whistle
Which is carried by the echo,
Making my enemies tremble
And making my friends respect me more

[Refrain:]
Proudly spreading the wings
They shot up in the skies
Souls of the three are kings
United in eternal rise
Though they are different
Wild, singing and of prey
They are due to guard the Skies together
Until their last feather
Touches the ground on the Doomsday.

La-lae-lae
La-lae-lae

[Coda:]
We are bird people
Thatâs our divine appearance
The souls got wings!
We begin our magic tour

Bird people!
Three souls got wings!
