[Aleksey Alexx777 Yevseyev]

You were not born a hero,
But you can do wonders
(You were not born a hero)
When danger shows its claws...
You will become the Beast of war...

Iâve never (never) known war
Iâve never (never) known rage
But now Iâll settle score
I want to break my cage
Iâve never (never) known death
Iâve never (never) carried steel
But now dogâs my crest
And burning rage I feel

Be brave, or be dead,
Be sane or be mad
Be strong, and be helpful to those in need
Be faithful, be proud
Stay out of black cloud
And you will succeed

[Refrain:]
The steel is rusty, the steel is old
The edge of blade is blunt
My angerâs rising, my heart is cold
Hellâs fire in my eyes.
Iâll clear rust and polish sword
Until itâs extra-clean
Iâll raise it and defend my world
Iâm stronger then I seem

My dreams were very good
To walk, to talk, to kiss
I'll throw away my flute
The burning flesh in breeze

Iâve lost my kids today
Assaulted many times
Oh, Ares, seal my fate
Iâll take revenge for crimes

[Refrain:]
The steel is rusty, the steel is old
The edge of blade is blunt
My angerâs rising, my heart is cold
Hellâs fire in my eyes.
Iâll clear rust and polish sword
Until itâs extra-clean
Iâll raise it and defend my world
Iâm stronger then I seem

The polished sword of mine
Will catch the rays of Sun
Iâm cursed by fight divine
But I will have my fun

You were not born a hero,
But you can do wonders
When danger shows its claws...
You will become the Beast of war...
Beast of war...

Be brave, or be dead,
Be sane or be mad
Be strong, and be helpful to those in need
Be faithful, be proud
Dont have any doubts
Take pay for their deeds

[Refrain:]
The steel is rusty, the steel is old
The edge of blade is blunt
My angerâs rising, my heart is cold
Hellâs fire in my eyes.
Iâll clear rust and polish sword
Until itâs extra-clean
Iâll raise it and defend my world
Iâm stronger then I seem
