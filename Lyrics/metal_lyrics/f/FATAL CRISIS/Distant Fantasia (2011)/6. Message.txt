[A. Driverson, R. Aminova]

When the God is willing to talk to someone
He'll make the Chosen One feel he is.
But not everybody's able to hear him
And understand his message.

But the Divine knows
Who's the worthiest from the millions
And he'll let him know in the sleep.
The signs which are impossible for an average man to see...

The colours of dreams haven't faded away yet,
And the Chosen One was ready.
Was ready to go where he was called to -
To the country of eternal sands.

[Refrain:]
Golden dust and time!
Wild beauty attracts the adventurers.
Golden dust and time!
Wind whispers about the thousand miles of loneliness.

The magic of the desert burned by sun influences the fates and changes all people!
(Too hot to live
Too vast to give)

The Chosen One's heart shows the way.
And he follows it without hesitating.
Neither talismans nor amulets,
But belief often saved his life.

But suddenly the Chosen One felt
The presence of evil.
The daemon bloodsucker was trying to take
All the life away from him.

(Sahara! Sahara! Sahara! Sahara!...)
Its embraces are broad
But they suffocate.
They dry brains,
Erase memory,
Distort reality
And let evil into soul.

Will the Chosen one manage to reach his aim?..

[Refrain:]
Golden dust and time!
Wild beauty attracts the adventurers.
Golden dust and time!
Wind whispers about the thousand miles of loneliness.

The magic of the desert burned by sun influences the fates and changes all people!
(Too hot to live
Too vast to give)

(Sahara! Sahara! Sahara! Sahara!...)

The dunes didn't reject the guest
Who entered their hearts.
But the ghosts of desert are inexorable...

The majEstic tomb appeared before the Chosen One's eyes.
It was the end of his way.

He can brake the ancient lock.
But what are the doubts?..
The messenger of God mustn't be afraid!
What if he sets the monster free?..

With his eyes closed, with prayer on his lips
He opens the entrance of the tomb.
...And the prisoners go out cold, exhausted,
(Bestially betrayed)
Calling the Chosen One to be their Saviour.

[Refrain:]
Golden dust and time!
Wild beauty attracts the adventurers.
Golden dust and time!
Wind whispers about the thousand miles of loneliness.

The magic of the desert burned by sun influences the fates and changes all people!
(Too hot to live
Too vast to give)
