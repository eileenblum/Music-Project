[A. Driverson, R. Aminova]

I'm inside the burning room
Surrounded with fire from all sides.
Here dreams and hopes are burnt down,
And life works turn into smoke.

Some day love ruled in the room
Destroyed by infernal powers.
Emotions prevailed over the mind
And human flaws couldn't be restrained.

But I can still feel here the spirit of honour,
Innocence,
Purity...
I can feel it on flames
Like the touch of reality.

This room is still alive...
It talks to me
Telling its sad story.
And I listen to it
As I'm an Angel, the Keeper of their memory.

I'm an Angel, the Keeper of their memory...

They will never be forgotten!
