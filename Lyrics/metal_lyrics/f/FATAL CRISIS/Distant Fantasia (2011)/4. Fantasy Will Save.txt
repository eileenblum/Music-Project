[A. Driverson, R. Aminova]

Now and again I'm carried away by something
From the present time,
From the vanity of the world...
Some power,
Which I can't control.
Is it worth to resist it?
Or is it worth to drift?..

I see the other world, the other images,
I hear lively voices.
Love and happiness are reigning around me...
Will I have it all in the real life?

I can change
Every situation,
Any people.
(I can change myself!)
Here I can be the hero
Or just a free man.
The lifebrush is in my hands!..

Beautiful for the sake of the beautiful!
Good for the sake of the good!

The ocean of broken dreams
Is raging in me.
Here in this place
It escaped from the inside
Bringing many good ideas.
And I'm the creator of them!

[Refrain:]
Fantasy will save from the injuries of the real world.
(From the cruelty, the heartlessness, the hate)
Fantasy will save from the injuries of the real world.
(From the cruelty, the heartlessness, the hate)
Till I'm alive,
Till I think,
Till I create,
Till I laugh,
I feel myself protected,
Owning this gift!
(Fantasy will save me)

What makes the present as it is?
Thoughts,
Feelings,
Emotions...

What can make the present better for the mankind?
Thoughts,
Feelings,
Emotions...

There's nothing constant,
Nothing...
Just the time.
There's no way back,
I can't anticipate things.

But in my imagination
Thereâs not a single epoch,
Not a single time!..
I imagine people of the past
And of the future,
I imagine them living
And how they can live
Imagine something they did
Or can do...
I imagine them
To learn how to change
My present!

[Refrain:]
Fantasy will save from the injuries of the real world.
(From the cruelty, the heartlessness, the hate)
Fantasy will save from the injuries of the real world.
(From the cruelty, the heartlessness, the hate)
Till I'm alive,
Till I think,
Till I create,
Till I laugh,
I feel myself protected,
Owning this gift!

Every time
Coming back to severe reality,
I see
How I improved it.

Thereâs no impossibility!
Thereâs unwillingness.

I open the new doors
To the unexplored
To the inscrutable.
I'm looking for someone to help me,
Help me become one of them!

The master of my life!..

Clear energy binds us.
Dreamer and Creator...

Purpose, wish and faith
Make me act
I'm in the land of my dreams,
Which I revive again, again, again and again...

[Refrain:]
Fantasy will save from the injuries of the real world.
(From the cruelty, the heartlessness, the hate)
Fantasy will save from the injuries of the real world.
(From the cruelty, the heartlessness, the hate)
Till I'm alive,
Till I think,
Till I create,
Till I laugh,
I feel myself protected,
Owning this gift!
(Fantasy will save me)
