[A. Driverson, R. Aminova]

Like a plague
Lord's conquest hit the land.
Like a scourge...

Fire spread across the settlements
And ancient towns.
Any life was terminated,
Any property was taken away...

His possessions was growing up,
But it wasn't enough.
His greed was insatiable.

One day the soothsayer prophecied him the awful decease
And enraged Lord ordered to put him to death.
But from then, the seeds of doubt were planted.
Undecayable will rot,
Immortal will die...

[Refrain:]
Victories and defeats!
Chains of morality
Never burden down the heartless strategist.
Victories and defeats!
His code of honour
Is written in blood of the guiltless victims.
Victories and defeats!

Many successful campaigns
Were followed by number of failures.
But the callous-tempered Lord
Didn't lay down his arms.

His army was growing and advancing onwards.
They were called "Hells Punishers".
They were feared and claimed for not being humans
Cause for every fallen three came on his place.

Soldiers were inebriated by Lord's promises
They were trained in ferocity and bloodthirstiness.

But every madness someday meets its end.
And the Lord knew it...

[Refrain:]
Victories and defeats!
Chains of morality
Never burden down the heartless strategist.
Victories and defeats!
His code of honour
Is written in blood of the guiltless victims.
Victories and defeats!

Time passes by
And the Lord is overwhelmed by bad premonitions.
The verge is trembling in his hand,
His own thoughts don't belong to him anymore.

He stopped letting anyone to come near
Afraid of assassination
Afraid of being poisoned
And he turned from the host into hostage of own palace.

He was losing control...
He was losing control...
His servants disobeyed him,
His orders were not fulfilled.

And when they bursted into tyrant's room
The Lord weeped.
The Lord weeped.
And then he heard the voice of young man:

"My father, soothsayer laid down his life
For the sake of your belief in his words
And he turned the course of events.
Your strength - your belief - has become your grave
Now prey!"

Undecayable will rot,
Immortal will die.

[Refrain:]
Victories and defeats!
Chains of morality
Never burden down the heartless strategist.
Victories and defeats!
His code of honour
Is written in blood of the guiltless victims.
Victories and defeats!
