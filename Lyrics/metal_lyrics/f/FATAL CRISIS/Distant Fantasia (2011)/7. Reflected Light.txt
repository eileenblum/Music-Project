[Astral Moristar]

I was looking in the mirror
But I've seen there not my face
I've seen there a beauty maiden --
Nightborn flower of the waste

Many eyes in life I've seen
They were bright, like the sunrise
But the flame in crystal river
Flowing swiftly in her eyes

[Refrain:]
Through the mirror
To the place I've seen
To hold her hand in mine
It's all I've ever dreamed

So many years are gone away
So many times I tried
To reach her, but beetwen us
This false and mirrored light

Sweetest pain and darkest evil
Than I felt deep in my heart
It's hard to breath, the air is killing
And broken soul is far apart

Many eyes in life I've seen
They were bright, like the sunrise
But the flame in crystal river
Flowing swiftly in her eyes

[Refrain:]
Through the mirror
To the place I've seen
To hold her hand in mine
It's all I ever dreamed

So many years are gone away
So many times I tried
To reach her, but beetwen us
This false and mirrored light

I told her that I fÐµll in love
That I can't live without her
And my voice riched to the sky
But only whispering she heard

[Refrain:]
Through the mirror
To the place I've seen
To hold her hand in mine
It's all I ever dreamed

So many years are gone away
So many times I tried
To reach her, but beetwen us
This false and mirrored light
