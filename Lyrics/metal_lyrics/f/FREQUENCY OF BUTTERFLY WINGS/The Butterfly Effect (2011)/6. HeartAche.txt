I'm sitting down on a chair
tall walls surround me
i feel i'm blind, it seems i'm deaf
i tried to scream but no one hears

there is no light, where is the sun?
nobody's alive, people cry can't you hear?
i won't pay attention
to this pain in my heart

i can't breath anymore
darkness swallowed me i'm sure
a rush of blood falls from my eyes
i won't birth anymore
