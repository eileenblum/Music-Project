Inside me
i feel a magical liquid
warm and jumper
crimson and dirty
it's captive me
and make me alive
it's hold me on ground
the human gravity

like a balloon piercing
i become light without it
like a rocket goes up
i feel i can fly

i can see the last drop
everything fading to dark
feel i'm deaf feel i'm blind
there is nothing in my frozen mind

is this the end?
don't punish me again!
