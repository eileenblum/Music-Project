I'm a lonely vocal
alone from inside
i'm who i am
i have nothing to pretend
the way that i go
seems i'm just fellow of myself
i can't stay till someone come with me
i will go maybe i would find a friend

i feel the power though sorrow surround me
but you're swallowed in ordinary
everyone who stay
will be corrupt
