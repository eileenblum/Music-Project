Greenland surrounded by mist
sad clouds are crying
suddenly the winds is scream
wolves are ululating

black shadows are carrying the lanterns
glow worms are everywhere
i heard an elf whisper
come fly as a bird

i won't be lost in the days
i won't waste by spiral time
i won't get losing my dreams
i just wanna be myself

cool wind pated my body
green leafs covered my hands
little dew kissed my lips
time to have wet dream

twilight melted by trees
i wanna sleep under the moon
i can count the little stars
that's all
my mind is free
