Look at the sun, over the sea
Down again with a sad melody
Let it shine, in your eyes
Donât let your dreams slowly die
Look at the clouds, across the moon
Enjoy of, this glorious doom
Let it echo, in your mind
You are not a lie, donât let it die

I Burn in flames, again and again
I'm blinded by the Light, Dazzle again

Look up at the sky, full of stars
Tolerance the pain in your heart
Smash the crown of your god
Believe in yourself, belief your mind
Dazzle again, she is like a sun
Its her light that made you blind
You lost your sight you lost your mind
You Burn in flames, again and again

I Burn in flames, again and again
I'm blinded by the Light, Dazzle again

Is that you? Hanged on the tree
Is that you? Hanged on your dreams
Is it truth? You fall on your knees
Is it truth? You canât breath

She says a word,
And I say a word
Autumn is deepening.
