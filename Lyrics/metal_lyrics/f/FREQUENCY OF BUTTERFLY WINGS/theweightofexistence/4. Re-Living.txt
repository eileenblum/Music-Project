I watched you falling, toward the sky
You watched me drowning, into the light
I know I have nothing to clear up my soul and make it bright
And you're still shining, no doubt you asleep in the arms of sun

I'm the sun
I'm the sun
I'm the sun
I'll keep you warm

The frozen trees as frozen as my rhymes
I wipe your tears in the coldest winter of all time
Fly in the upwind is what we need to complete our crime
I know they're lying you didn't leave me you're always in my mind

I'm the sun
I'm the sun
I'm the sun
I'll keep you warm

Winter said you're not far away, I feel you
For ever I will be waiting here, for you
Cause I wont break my promises, I hope to
I remember now I remember your smile, I miss you
In my dreams I'm just living in my dreams, with you
Re-living is the only thing, that I can do
Fly away, I wanna fly away, to find you
Though I'm gasping for sorrows, but I will do
