The cold winter wind is blowing to my face
Everything is audible in silence
I painted a bird with my blood
I feel this pain a lot

Fog in horizon
Equal to my ruin
Winter snow falls
Equal to my ruin

I had lump in my throat
The words are heavy to say
I'm closing my eyes to see the dark side
But all I see is there is no god

Crows are flying
Equal to my ruin
No mercy
Equal to my ruin
I'm calling you
Only the echo of my voice
I conceiving you
Only memories
You're fading away
