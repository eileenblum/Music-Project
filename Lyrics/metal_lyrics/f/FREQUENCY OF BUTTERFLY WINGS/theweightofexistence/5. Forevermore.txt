stars, twilight
I feel paralyzed
Fear, tears
Am I mesmerized?

Here is my eyes, take them, and make me blind
Here I am, in darkside, just close your eyes and watch the sun

Stars, falls from sky
I am numb
let me know, if you go
What will happen to our sun

Here is my eyes, take them, and make me blind
Here I am, in darkside, just close your eyes and watch the sun

The earth will be torn apart
As you leave me
The sky gonna be cracked
As you leave me
The earth will be torn apart
As I leave you
Sky gonna be cracked
As I leave you
