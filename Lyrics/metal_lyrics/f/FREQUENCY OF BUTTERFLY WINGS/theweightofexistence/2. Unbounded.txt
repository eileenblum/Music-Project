And there was nothing but the sound of birds
And the sky full of emptiness
I will wander in the streets again
I will calm down by the screaming
And there was nothing but a few birds flying
I could feel the power in our eyes
It was brighter than sun
This is not the end
Its not the end of our beginning

Come, fly as far as we are
Come and close your eyes to see

We will be lighter than snow
We will be purer than water
Come see the stars
let's hold the wind
Who will believe where we came from?
We feel the power deep inside
This is who we are
See the difference between us and them

Come, fly as far as we are
Come and close your eyes to see
