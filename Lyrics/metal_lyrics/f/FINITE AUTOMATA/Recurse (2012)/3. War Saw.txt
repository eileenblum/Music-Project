fear this potential problem
a mangled war perpetuates
the power at the hands
of a rusted blade
a severed arm waves
in silence

the unremorseful tongue
of a guiltless political demagogue
minces meat with dialogues
for a rhetoric of greed
as policy states
with an eager pace
to pay one's self
at any rate

fear envisioned
impoverished traditions
fueled by the crimes
of a vile provision

the machine gun fires
the only light
exaggerated justice
for a wicked right

to pay one's self
the ravaged wealth
does battle truly stimulate
a country's health?
