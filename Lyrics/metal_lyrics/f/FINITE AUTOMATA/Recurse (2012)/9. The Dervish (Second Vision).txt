scrape the furnace
fate unnoticed
one nationâs crime
rocket scrape
lost last vision
unrequited state of being
left unseen
the weapon trembling
six feet underground
a city sits in wait
eradicate to the last gleaming
flares trace and satiates
the arms race
phosphorus rains

a blinding light that's glaring from the right
upon wives screaming
a blinding light that's glaring from the right

the holocaust
relies upon
a five sided polygon
