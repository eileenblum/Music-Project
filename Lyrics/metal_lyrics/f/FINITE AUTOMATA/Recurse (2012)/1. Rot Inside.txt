Quiver my attraction crawls
Ever closer against the wall
A flirt death ego writhes inside
Playing games with suicide

Feared retort a confidence
Game vilify a heartfelt vain
Makeup dressed with nostril stained
Your affluence is a backward strain

Stray the dog who never cares

In a filthy spied i watch
And know you'll never wear
Gauging a reaction
To a two faced hollow stare
Staging my distraction
In recursion to your place
Lying in the sheet so safe
That loves a fevered ego race

Forward played in course
No remorse
Clashing my recourse

Stray the dog who never cares

Culture shock a severed ghost
To aggravate what suffers most
