bright purest faith
stand at the gates
writing the writ
so full of hate
a high altered visionary saint
with intentional humility
a lullaby of blasphemy

(eyes of god)

cause and effect
infest with no regrets
guilt well placed
within deceitful dialect
high altered visionary
sanctify replaced
with master race
mask disgrace
with godâs embrace

lies filth in eyes
writhes the jagged lines
point dismissed
you'll terrorize
rise filth in eyes
writhes the jagged lines
they'll burn and turn
the tree limb urn
