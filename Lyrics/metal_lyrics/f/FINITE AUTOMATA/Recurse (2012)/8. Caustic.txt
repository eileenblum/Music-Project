filth that paints a mirror buried
those eyes twist to turn
ashes burn still burn with guilt
overturning all thatâs built

feverish grin the introvert
strung out spreads the dirt

caustic tears
crave ways to curse
drips the dregs
scraped from above

fuel my torment
fuel my shame

dripping dregs
scraped from above
