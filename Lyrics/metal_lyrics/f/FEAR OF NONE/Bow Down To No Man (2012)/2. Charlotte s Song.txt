I want to fall into your arms
I pray to see your face again
A time long gone
I try to carry on

I try to carry on

I lay numb within these halls
Suffocating from these thoughts
In emptiness I scream your name
Waiting to hear your voice again

Let me be the light that guides your way
Here are two tokens for the ferry ride
To carry you safely to the after life

I stand lost within these walls
Trapped inside these incessant thoughts
And in vain I scream your name
Waiting to hear your voice again

Let me be the light that guides your way
Here are two tokens for the ferry ride
To carry you safely to the after life

For you I scream your name
For you I scream your name

Lay your head down
Iâll pray for you
I want to fall into your arms
I pray to see your face again
A time long gone
I try to carry on
I try to carry on

I will carry on
