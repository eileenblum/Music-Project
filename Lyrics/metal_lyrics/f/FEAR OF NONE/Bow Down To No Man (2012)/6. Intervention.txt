Your fears are ripping us apart
The secrets to a broken heart
I have laid my life before you
Promising my heart
While you have pulled away
Fearing from the start

Why live a life of silence
Try and break the contradictions
I walk from the question
Are you afraid

We are less when weâre apart
Every nerve touched by flame
We should not be the victims of our scattered fears
We are shaped by these pressures
Whether we resist or not

Why live a life of silence
Try and break the contradictions
I walk from the question
Are you afraid
Why live a life of silence
Try and break the contradictions
I walk from the question
Are you afraid

Hold on itâll be ok
Take my hand Iâll take you away
Hold on itâll be ok
Take my hand Iâll take you away

There is always a way out
If you can recognize it
Must I walk this tightrope in your silence

Hold on itâll be ok
Take my hand Iâll take you away
Hold on itâll be ok
Take my hand Iâll take you away

Donât fall away I wonât leave you behind
Weâll fly away sailing towards the sky
We can run away leaving this place behind
Donât fall away stay by my side

Hold on itâll be ok
Take my hand Iâll take you away
Hold on itâll be ok
Take my hand Iâll take you away
Hold on itâll be ok
Take my hand Iâll take you away
Hold on itâll be ok
Take my hand Iâll take you away
