I have seen your face like glass
Broken in waves
Reflections of the past
Ripples in time fade away
And thereâs nothing left to search for
And thereâs nothing left to hold
Except empty memories
Distorted in my mind

And all I see is you
Falling back through time
Being swept aside being left behind

And all that you were was lost
Silenced in pain
Yet here I remain
Tortured lost in the wake
And thereâs nothing left to search for
And thereâs nothing left to hold
Except empty memories
Distorted over time

And all I see is you
Falling back through time
Being swept aside being left behind
And all I see is you
Falling back through time
Being swept aside being left behind

And Iâll hold a candle for you
To see through the dark
To find your way back
When you are lost
And Iâll hold a candle for you
To see through the dark
To find your way back
When you are lost

And all I see is you
Falling back through time
Being swept aside being left behind
And all I see is you
Falling back through time
Being swept aside being left behind

Being swept aside being left behind
