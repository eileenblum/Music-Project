Your mask so perfect
Underneath youâre broken and scarred
Your world so fractured
Under the guise of your word

So take a look in the mirror
And see behind the facade
A life is not worth living
Unless you see who you are

And with your mask youâre wearing a lie
Suffering in your own silence
And with your mask youâre wearing a lie
Suffering in your own silence

When all your life is shattered
Behind the mask that you wear
Your disguise is perfection
Your life is filled with despair

Whatâs there left to live for
When all your hope is gone
Whatâs the use of faking when youâre sinking
You must push on

And with your mask youâre wearing a lie
Suffering in your own silence
And with your mask youâre wearing a lie
Suffering in your own silence

Behind the mask that you wear
Your life is filled with despair

Fake lifeless
Fake faceless
Fake lifeless
Fake faceless

And with your mask youâre wearing a lie
Suffering in your own silence
And with your mask youâre wearing a lie
Suffering in your own silence

Your mask so perfect
Underneath youâre broken and scarred
When all your life is shattered
Behind the mask that you are

Fake lifeless
Fake faceless
