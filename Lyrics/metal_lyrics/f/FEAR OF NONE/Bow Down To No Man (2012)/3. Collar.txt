You will never break me down
Iâll never give in to submission
I will not fall
Nor will I surrender
This is where I stand my ground
I will not suffer from oppression
I will not fall
Nor will I surrender

Your fleeting ways of life
Acts as collar that restraining us all
Holds us back chokes the world

You will never break me down
Iâll never give in to submission
I will not fall
Nor will I surrender
This is where I stand my ground
I will not suffer from oppression
I will not fall
Nor will I surrender

Your righteousness consumes us all
Acts as a prison that enslaves the world
Locks us up behind your walls

You will never break me down
Iâll never give in to submission
I will not fall
Nor will I surrender
This is where I stand my ground
I will not suffer from oppression
I will not fall
Nor will I surrender

You will never break me down
You will never break me down

So open up your eyes
It is time to take a stand to rise up
And take the collar off
To bring the fascists and tyrants down

You will never break me down
Iâll never give in to submission
I will not fall
Nor will I surrender
This is where I stand my ground
I will not suffer from oppression
I will not fall
Nor will I surrender

You will never break me down
You will never break me down
