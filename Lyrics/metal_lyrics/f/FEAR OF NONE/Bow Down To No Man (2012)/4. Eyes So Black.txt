This is not a plea for forgiveness
But a promise to erase you from my memory
This is not a question but an answer
With these words Iâll free myself from you forever

With eyes so black
This is the last time
This is the last time
I lay myself before you
This is the last time

And this time I will hold to my pride
I wonât turn back
To look into the eyes that blinded me
With all your lies youâve tried
Tried to tear me down
Time and time again all youâve done is strive
Strive to pull me down with those eyes
With eyes so black

And you have fallen so far
From what we were
And you have fallen so far
From what we were

This is not a plea for forgiveness
But a promise to erase you from my memory
Time and time again all youâve done is strive
Strive to pull me down with those eyes
With eyes so black

With eyes so black
This is the last time
This is the last time
I lay myself before you
This is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
