I have seen you on your knees
Falling much too deep
Your tears turn red
From your mistakes
Now all the ones you need
Have left you on your knees
And we all fall
From your mistakes

All the pain you suffer
The torment in your eyes
This is just another moment
This is just another
Another time for you to cry
What a wasted life
Your life in ruins

I have seen you on your knees
Falling much too deep
Your tears turn red
From your mistakes
Now all the ones you need
Have left you on your knees
And we all fall
From your mistakes

All the pain you suffer
The torment in your eyes
This is just another moment
This is just another
Another time for you to cry
What a wasted life
Your life in ruins

Your life in, your life in ruins
Your life in, your life in ruins
Your life in, your life in ruins
Your life in, your life in ruins

I have seen you on your knees
Falling much too deep
Your tears turn red
From your mistakes
Now all the ones you need
Have left you on your knees
And we all fall
From your mistakes

All the pain you suffer
The torment in your eyes
This is just another moment
This is just another
Another time for you to cry
What a wasted life
Your life in ruins

I have seen you on your knees
Falling much too deep
Your tears turn red
From your mistakes
Your life in ruins
I have seen you on your knees
Falling much too deep
Your tears turn red
From your mistakes
Your life in ruins
