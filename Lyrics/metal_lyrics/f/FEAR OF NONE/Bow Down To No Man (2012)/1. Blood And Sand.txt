I have heard the masses scream
As blood hits the sand
Honor and glory thrust upon us
With death in our hands
I have heard the masses scream
As blood hits the sand
Honor and glory thrust upon us
With death in our hands

This is a life built by broken men
An empire of greed forged upon these sands
This is a game created to survive
An age of tyrants built on broken lives

And as we walk into this arena
We will walk tall with out heads held high
We will march to our futures
And find ourselves once more
And even if we fall
It will not be with heads hung low
For on this day
We will see the blood of many
And in that blood we will find ourselves once more

I have heard the masses scream
As blood hits the sand
Honor and glory thrust upon us
With death in our hands
I have heard the masses scream
As blood hits the sand
Honor and glory thrust upon us
With death in our hands

And as we walk into this arena
We will walk tall with out heads held high
We will march to our futures
And find ourselves once more
And even if we fall
It will not be with heads hung low
For on this day
We will see the blood of many
And in that blood we will find ourselves once more

I have heard the masses scream
As blood hits the sand
Honor and glory thrust upon us
With death in our hands
I have heard the masses scream
As blood hits the sand
Honor and glory thrust upon us
With death in our hands
