Take this burden off my chest
Cause it ties me down to you
Ties me down to all your lies
All the lies youâve ever spilled
And these wounds are so deep
They always seem to bleed, rot, pain

So take these cuts and my wounds
Cause they hold me down to you
Holds me down to all the pain
All the memories of you
And these wounds you left me with
They always remind me of you

I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed
I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed
I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed

Take this burden off my chest
Cause it ties me down to you
Ties me down to all your lies
All the lies youâve ever spilled
And these wounds are so deep
They always seem to bleed

I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed
I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed
I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed

I can feel these cuts draining me
And I can feel you haunting still
And I can feel my life leaving me

Run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, runaway

I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed
I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed
I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed
I will heal these wounds
Even if the scars still bleed
