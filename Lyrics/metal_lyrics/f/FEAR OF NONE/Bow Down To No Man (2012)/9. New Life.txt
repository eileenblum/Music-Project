Oh
I break down in crisis
Struggling to breathe
Broken in the darkness
It washes over me
In this darkness I have seen the plague
That is your disease
In silence I stumble
With the nightmare soon to be

And I feel it now
And I feel it now
And I feel it now
And I feel it breathe new life in me

Is this a woken dream
I feel it cover me
I slowly find my way
In the nightmare soon to be
For all my sins the burdens Iâve worn

In this place Iâm reborn
I stumble no more
Iâm broken no more

And I feel it now
And I feel it now
And I feel it now
And I feel it breathe new life in me

Feel it
Breathe new life in me

Breathe new life in me

And I feel it now
And I feel it now
And I feel it now
And I feel it breathe new life in me

Feel it
Breathe new life in me
