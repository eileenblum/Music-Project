This time worst than the last, the last
Blistering flesh from acidic words
Brought you down a peg, a peg
Embrace the poison
The voices in my head
Your words are tormenting
Theyâre sickening, theyâre sickening
Looking for escape, you wonât escape

Into the fray
Iâll embrace my fate
Embrace my fate, embrace the pain
Soul suffering
I wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid

Tempers flare, flare
The loss of innocence
Praying for your silence, your silence
Lost in my despair
Fear not the consequence, consequence
Embrace the circumstance, circumstance
Fuck what you heard Iâm thinning the herd
Holding no regrets

Into the fray
Iâll embrace my fate
Embrace my fate, embrace the pain
Soul suffering
I wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid
Into the fray
Iâll embrace my fate
Embrace my fate, embrace the pain
Soul suffering
I wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid
Iâm not afraid
Iâm not afraid

Into the fold I walk alone
The dark my home, into the fold
Into the fold I walk alone
The dark my home, into the fold
Into the fold I walk alone

Into the fray
Iâll embrace my fate
Embrace my fate, embrace the pain
Soul suffering
I wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid
Into the fray
Iâll embrace my fate
Embrace my fate, embrace the pain
Soul suffering
I wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid
Into the fray
Iâll embrace my fate
Embrace my fate, embrace the pain
Soul suffering
I wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid, wonât be afraid
Iâm not afraid
Iâm not afraid
