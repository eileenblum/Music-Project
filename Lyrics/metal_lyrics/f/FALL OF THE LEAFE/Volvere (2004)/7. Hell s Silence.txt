Came the black
Named white
Came the dark
Named light
Came the captors
Named liberators
Came the wrongs
Named rights
The bills and power
The poisons of printing press
The guns and clubs
Justice and jails
And above all, the frenzy of using all above.

There is a strange silence
When rifles are placed in hands
When steel is resisted
By grey weak walls of
Ghosts fed only by fear.
