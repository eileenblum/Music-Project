Looking at your face is like staring into a void.
I brought you back.
You show me your face.
Children laugh and play.
In chains you drag your
feet to the marketplace.
You smile like a child.
You are not deceived.
You had dreams before.

The sun rises in a pillar of flame.
You hide in a fortress of sadness.
I never knew you.
Your shoulders bend for a statue in living rock.
Operculum of silver, the sculptor signs his name.
Sun devours moon with relish.
I am a scent on the sighing breeze, an ever-rising laugh like bells.

Caught in the sphere of your umbra, the sun sets like a wound of scarlet.
Do not let these words confuse you.
You are looking for a message you left behind.
Staring at the horizon.
My heart is filled with fever.
Your diplomacy beats down on me and promises rain.
It has been a long time since I felt a fear of life.
You promised to share the alchemy of your gaze with me.
It burns through your ozone and I dissolve.
