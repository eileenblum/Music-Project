It is possible to simulate a falling.
Just find a slope with a low friction surface.

Add gravity and voila.
Down you go, although according to the tag, death or serious injury may occur in the process.
No such tags exist on the daily programme.
Defence programme.

Pre-emptive search for enemies.

Our precious community is out there tonight to look for potential hazards.
Looking out the window, it would seem that one just whizzed round the corner.

Don't walk until green.
Don't show weakness, which is pure evil.
Otherwise, death or serious injury may occur.
