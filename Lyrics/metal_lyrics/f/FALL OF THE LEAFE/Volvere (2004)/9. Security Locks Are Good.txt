After this punishment, are we all certain that speech is for the good?
Just listen up while this thin, thin silence brings down our spirits with a smiling grin.
Are we all certain that the mood is set low enough now?
Do not speak--hush, when it seems not all song and dance.

Right now, not that many things make a difference.
Cats, dogs, children and their toys, nothing.

Are we really lucky to just stand by here and watch?
Would we actually make noise if we were warm?
I can hardly believe so.
All the bollocks flow down on us like wet snow.

I have said it before and I will say it again.
We could stand up and shout.
But only when their backs are turned at us.
We could speak our minds.
But only when the tape is not rolling.

Idiot question, but are we all certain that our lives are safe enough in the arms of these saviors?
Yeah.
We have seen the cat gold at the end of this rainbow.
No walls are thick enough, except theirs, of course.
Open a door, walk the streets and cherish the dynamics of the Exclusion City.
