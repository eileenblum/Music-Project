Awkward in the corner of a waiting room, right next to the old magazines.
Uneasy, like a fish pulled up against the light.
Black day, curiously attractive white light.
Just as comfortable as watching well-oiled axis of rail cars ride by above.
Maybe there is something outside the window, maybe not.
Not.
Ask the lady again for no particular reason.

Hurting like a bitch and wearing a shit excuse for clothes.
These stains are definitely staying.
Suddenly a voice:
"Snap out of it.
No blood, can't hurt.
Go home."
