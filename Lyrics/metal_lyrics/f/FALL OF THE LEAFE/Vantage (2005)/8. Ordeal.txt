Your screaming soul, how you have tried to touch me
Enfolded like a desert wind
Hot dry dust in the flower
Push me away
Sink down to the bottom with me
Your glare to cover me

Hold this memory, this passes by
All my sight and sound, all that I passed by
Every tear shed, another day passed
Every drop of rain a flower daid
We stare out of a portal into a desert
The colour of a rose at sunset
Shivering in the heat
Our minds wander across the sand

A fountain in the courtyard
Turn away as love fades in the shades of sun - drenched sienna
You say the sun will rise to burn you away
Time decayed in my veins here
I am done, dry in the dust
Centuries of ancient longing
Time and again I loved you when you crushed me
Don't turn away
An image of you, prone on my doorstep, is deep in my heart

Watch closely and live
One with the sand that passes us by
Call out my name
Lie silent in darkness
Reach out you hand, feel the teeth of fear
My death
I stand in stone
You want nothing more
Stand here in stone
