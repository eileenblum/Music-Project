Eyes open
The news pried open the locks of my awareness
I have no secrets
Well, unless one could call my ability to break moments into pieces one
All it takes is a one, maybe two wrongly selected words
I am meant a receiver, a filler of silences at best

Receiver, on this day
Not of wrath but deepest ignorance
As a servant of guilt, so heavy it will sicken to a cancer
You refused to breathe as if air was the devil's kiss
You refused all light as it had come with the end

I watch the news
Regularly
And I imagine how entire nations compare to me
How badly placed bombs can do harm in the same way as my words
Well, just keep in mind the scale of things, OK
How I have no nerve to reach in, and crack the really difficult problems
Apart from getting mad at them, maybe
Yeah, if I had a shotgun, I would be interested using it for solving some
problems
See if they'd come back
Ha

Receiver, on this day
Not a far cry from madness
As a host for guilt, so heavy it will sicken to a cancer
You refused to breathe as if air was the devil's kiss
You refused all light as it had come with the end

Guilt
It is all over the air like a scent having come with the light as it were the
god that had come to lick us back to it's darkness
Which it has plenty
