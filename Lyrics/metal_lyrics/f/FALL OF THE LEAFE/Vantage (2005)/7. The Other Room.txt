I have
I have something to tell you

The way went cold long before we played our quiet afternoon music

The sky melts under the weight of no more words

When before you I stand
Murdered by illusion, betrayed by fear and outdone by the light

I despair the disgust I feel
You smile on me and then laugh
When I see it broken I am broken as well

Leaves fall
We turn to rust when I see you from the other room
Your deceptions nine hours later
