Within my mind I long to see
Your cold city under a sky of schist

Sunset of an age
Chains of micropore gradient
Your face from love to disarray
Your city is as still as a bottom of a pond
Your laughter tears across me and I am gone

My sleep is breaking down
Who are you again
It's been predetermined how much of drainage we'll have to swallow before we'll be allowed some air
Don't worry, I'll be there to push you back under again

Slowly through the years I'm not getting anywhere
How many times did I love you when you crushed me?
How many times?
I'll be in your dreams...
Until death
