We watched it over lunch
Caffeine for the tired eyes
Warm smoke for the nerves
Some well-wrapped sweets
And oh mercy how sour they were
We read it in the paper while having warm bread
Five olives and a spoonful of something thought sweet
And of mercy how bitter it was

Glassy eyes, chrome nerves and an issue to address
Glassy eyes, chrome nerves
The news just said it nice

Admit to your jailors that it's too much
And be tied ever tighter
Stand like this, still in a closet full of kicks on an angry chair
Arrested twice and shot
