Lie and wait
There's no way out from the lands of the lost
Lie still in quiet and the morning is working to bring a day of fear (to the sons of war )

Sit and listen
To the other side (of border) where words so same are told
And the morning can only bring them another day of fear
They are blessed by the same god
Where the morning is working to reveal what last night's smoke and holds back

As for the few who hold the will and means
How do they speak
What are the words they say to make mothers and fathers turn loved ones into a
mass of sleepwalkers droning by over the line
Too far over the line

The morning can only bring them another day of fear
and they are blessed by the same god if such even exists here
While the morning is working to reveal what last night's smoke holds back

And look at all this torn city has denied
These sons of war, so threatened and lied
Where solitude, even in the masses, can then wish it, to take a man by the
blind god, and toss his own wrong-doings back at his face
A song breaks out in the cold

Mother war
Hear our windless breathing
Mother war
Soothing cries with fear
Mother war
Our tears drained by loss
Mother war
Far over the line
