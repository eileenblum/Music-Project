Nothing less than the sound of footsteps 
condensing into a shape. 
Sneaking into the murky urban café³ of crispy mornings. 
Realized it was a mirror after hours of work. They are filth. 
And also easily lost in the labyrinth of the theory of their 
own art - this easily percepted. Within the 4 years 
of rain it became my own microscopic Macondo. It all meant little, if 
nothing  What is the frase I look for... Chaotic Dementh. 
Ah yes indeed. Been there before, fair lady? A Copper medal I won 
at the chill-kill that day: Putrid Run, Salt... Torment, 
Thirst. Two fierce feasting parties wishing me warmly welcome in 
the aftermath of their own cold war. Neo-colonialistic freaks, 
says I. Tempers increase to hatred and vanish - in cataleptic 
disorders. An apparatus of something, don t really know what, 
remnant of the good that succumbed in man once? The absolute 
legion of oddity. Now guess what in the world machina mimesis is?
