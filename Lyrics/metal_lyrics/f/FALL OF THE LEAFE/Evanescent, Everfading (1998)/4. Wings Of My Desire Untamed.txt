In despair I behold! Now I condemn my fate
From the mist of a melancholy space
I stretch forth with my carnal claws
Never to return, never to repent, never to bewail again!

Guarded by the luster of the fears
Shuddering with cold, woven with tears
I draw near to mark the stars with her name
I extend the wings of my desire untamed

How do I lust to see her hazel eyes again
As deep as the oceans of infinity
How do I crave for her touch in consuming pain
As I bleed the drops of my avidity

For her I would walk unto the halls of Mars
And for her I would rot in the caverns of Thanatos
Beneath my Mother Earth, with my Brother the Astral sorrow
I would die forever alone, decayed and old

Veiled in robes of the Everfall
Shrouded in foam of the shallow waves
In silence she departs into wanton realms
And leaves my heart self-betrayed

To no avail do my cries echo
Betrayed by the lust of centuries
To no avail do my lays allude
Shivering I glide into...

She, like a white dove escapes from my grasp
Yet with the swift wings of my desire she falls prey
With bloody kisses of fervent disease she dies with me
I enthrone her in mine crystal realm of cold

Guarded by the phantoms of fear
Shuddering in cold, woven with tears
I draw near to capture her frail frame
I extend the wings of my desire untamed

Blood doth flow as our carnal desires unite
In the non-illumination of benighted existence
Alike the profane want within our depraved hearts
Pulsating vile fire, crimson in thirst
