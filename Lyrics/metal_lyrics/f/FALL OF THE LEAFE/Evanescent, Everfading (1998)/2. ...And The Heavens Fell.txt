The terminal fate of All-Realm draws nigh
Past and present Aeons come together
As swirling shapes of mordant beauty
Fathomless are the extends of thine!

At the Hesperus of the Universe
When the unfolding of time is at hand
The heavens fall upon the hordes of light
And Fire sweeps across the land

Chaos, ruling supreme; infiltrator of starlight
Disorder - in an ardent dance of mortiferous lust

One frozen darkness overflowed from the sky
In ardour depraved, in fervour defiled
Fallen stars strike the earth in hails -
in sparks of uncreation and undoing
The threefold spheres corrode
Like the newborn ornaments in the snow
Reflections in astral sculptures
Galaxies implode... the heavens fall!

Sorrowbirds in thunder blazing
Spectral visions at the end embracing
The Skyflames were upon us
...And the heavens fell
