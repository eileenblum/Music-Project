[Reflections Of The Wanderer/The Passing Of The Newborn God]

I am come into these celestial lands; the dreaded journey is at an end
Time has passed, ages gone and lost,
and the wandered returns to his home within the dead sky,
to behold as, at the starlit dawn, Lucifer, the morning star,
welcomes the Moon and Sun to return

The night is passed and I am as the last shadows to dwell
underneath the foliage of the mighty Oaks and the boughs of the Elms of old

Evanescent, Everfading are my lays and all that I have achieved
And how could blind eyes see the grandeur, deaf ears hearken the sound?
To such senses does my life ring unto and all the waves I leave behind
Wearied I am, with all hope long departed, all zest long gone

Where could I go ere I fade?
Wither could the starborne paths ever take me that I would find more,
to find nothingness, the true existence of All
Alike my Goddess, one with pain and sorrow,
one with joy and ardour, hands joined in a union of strangers,
we walk onwards, yet our horizon is bleak, sundered and bloody

Evanescent, Everfading are the autumntide colours that bleed upon us
Like a wailing wind the maidens of Fall awaken from their sleep
And the night remembers I walked on the shore
of the flaming sea and dreamt upon the sands of burning sorrow
Soon they are gone, with only show to usher us into the sleep
of the eternal Winternight that is yet to come

O Winterwind, will you caress me?
Your somber songs are like dreams that pass oh so swiftly,
dead dreams, the hollow sky

I am one with the thousand sagas of the crimson age,
I am one with the songs of the whirling, now dying season,
I am Evanescent, Everfading.
