Hearken as the winds of the Sky Realm blow
As the silken tears of the sky still bleed
The feathers of the frozen Stormbird fall
Into my heart like winterchill and snow

Let the freezing Fire return once more!
Let the soothing Serpent of blazing cold
ever-on radiate the Colours
Of this our shimmering season and manifest the omnifarious twilight
Wherein the dead silence prevails...

These frail beams of icy moonlight
Failing to warm the brilliant night
And swiftly... do the shadows arise
The grim brooding darkness of winterdusk

Journeys... yielding into the failing stars
of grandeur that are one with the puissance
of fierce tranquillity and the raging sorrowlust...
Journeys...
misty faceless figures speak of soothe within the spheres
Of these waning worlds that hold the ember of last hope...

Yet the space-time draws nigh
For the Aeonfrost to set in
And as all the words were spoken
One graceful Nocturne arose
Through the heavens above
And beyond the stars of the lustful firmament
That is the Sky Realm
And all that lies within its unyielding borders...

We come to the outermost reaches of these worlds
At the farthest verges of the manifold Universe
Where the crystal surges of Cold and Silence withstand
Where the eternal Winternight whispers her lullabies...

For the true Terminus is Father-Winter
The primal dwelling of Aeonfrost
That shall conquer all that burns
Therein all that still lingers will be lost

Within the Silence of the everfrozen Winternight...
Within the starlit domes of this everflaming sight!

...the skies are fading with our bleakness of heart
into the starblack ages yet to come...
and the empty spaces beyond the reach of starlight
conquer all life with their songs of oblivion

Let the freezing Fire return yet again!
Let the slithering Serpent of lustrous dark ever-on radiate the Blackness
Of these cold winter winds of the terminal nightfall of the doomed Universe
And the eventide leaves fall within!
