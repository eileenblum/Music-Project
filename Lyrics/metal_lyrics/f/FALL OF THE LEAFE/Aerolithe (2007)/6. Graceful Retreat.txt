Is there some mistake?
Something out of control?
No next step to take.
How can it all be met?
With any kind of grace, that is.

Retire down
In a graceful retreat
Down the morning
Never asking
Head of to coffee

Wives and deep indifference.
In which it's good to come out and forget.
The gone breaths.  The ghosts of special lies told.
To gain control and forget.

All in life that's looked free or
random, is now under control.
