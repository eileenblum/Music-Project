Having a bitch of time trying to remember.
A simple maneuver.
No other objective but to drive them away.  Outside.
But a small accident there and oops.  It will click and close
behind you.  All the twists, all the turns, all that led to here.
Greet the autumn cold.
Pale as some cleric of death you would imagine.  Inside,
the party goes on.
Just as soon as the window garments have been quenched
of flames.  Accidents happen, in every serious operation.
