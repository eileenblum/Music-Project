Not at all so far from losing all
that good innocence and turning into 
one of them.  Like the guy about a halfway
to the ground.  Still consumed by some 
need he cannot name or put a finger on.
But there are still some strange dynamics
to it.  Some highs and lows to bending just
too much.

In a room full of dust
All shapes clouded inside
Room full of dust
As some far reach of the sun
With just a bit of it teasing, looking in.
Around some corners
Around, in the deep inside
That will soften to a beautiful promise.

You can see some ghosts of workers moving about 
still.  Flowing, heaving to and fro.
Here at the far reaches of the sun.
