Try and disagree with reality.  This one simple
night that is dissected to pieces by a silly dream.  Machine
stalling.  Storm passing.  Man walking. Determined to see
which will bend - him or the world around.  Convinced that
reality will admit being wrong.

Have faith
In eyes of suspicion
Have faith
The world will come out and confess.

In all good faith, could you have thought
Of the man who would never
Never seek his life.
Never violate the rule.
But lay down the chill of the desert
Into this riverside town
No value in its name.
All in good faith
