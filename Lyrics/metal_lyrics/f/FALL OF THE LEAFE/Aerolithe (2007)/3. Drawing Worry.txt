The day might disturb your sleep as you
Carry on into the low, low mist.  Past
whatever was burned away.
Pass entire groups of words while at
it.  Bring her back and close your eyes a
bit tighter.  You don't want to see the
wrecks of men while there, although
they still frequent your sleep like
whatever rebellious little trespassers.
Visit your dreams for what?  To be
swallowed by the same surrounding walls
as you are - silly.

But it's their eyes, the ones that flee
every straight question.  The ones that draw
worry in small circles around you.
