First world down first - bound to fall...

Your self-destructive society,
a life full of  misery.
Poverty and corruption
Attempt to kill.

Religious leaders lead astray,
Drawing thousands straight to hell.
Your turn to god won't help you now
As all else failed.

Can't you respect my voice?
Give me an answer.

First world down first - bound to fall...

Driven by forces from the past,
Injustice never stops to last.
The cruel facade pushed aside.
Unjust order still remains.

A systematic warfare,
We kill without a weapon.
Through economic slavery
Their blood is on our hands.

Brother against brother
Age of inhumanity.
In a world in chains
No-one is ever free.

First world down first!
First world down first - bound to fall
First world down first - bound to fall
First world down first!
