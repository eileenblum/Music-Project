This is my anthem for all thoseâ¦
This is my anthem for all those,
Who aren't jaded, whose love won't fade.

To all those disillusioned, fake and insincere.
Nobody cares about you cause we're still here.
No matter who's giving up or selling out,
Their pointless apathy can't reach me now.

My life, I do remember.
My choice, why I am here.

No matter who's giving up or selling out,
Their pointless apathy can't reach me now.

Integrity - instead of appearance
Integrity - I still carry on.

My life, I do remember.
My choice, why I am here.

This is my anthem for all those who lost hope.
This is my anthem for all those left behind.
This is my anthem for all those who lost faith.
This is my anthem, my life, my way, my choice.
