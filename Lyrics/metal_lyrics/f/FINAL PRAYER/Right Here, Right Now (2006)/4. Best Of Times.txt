Live everyday like it is the last,
I know you've heard it all.
My p.m.a. is built to last,
keeps me from going insane.

Right here, right now - best of times,
...before my life runs out.

No matter what's coming your way,
The trick is always the same:
Never give up, never give in.
Get back on your feet.

Yes I do face bullshit everyday
and I've been stabbed in the back.
Reality slapped me in the face,
pushed me over the edge.

Right here, right now - best of times,
...before my life runs out.

No matter what's coming your way,
The trick is always the same:
Never give up, never give in.
Get back on your feet.
