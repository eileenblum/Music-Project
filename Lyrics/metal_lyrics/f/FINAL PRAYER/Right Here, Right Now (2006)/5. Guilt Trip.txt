We are your stepping stone,
The barrier right in your way.
We'll push ourselves over the edge.
We won't die in vain.

This fucking worldâs too cold.
There's nothing left to hold.

Rise above - in these times
Rise above - time to rise

We are your final prayer,
Your coffins' last nail.
We are the endless guilt-trip,
That will make you fail.

This fucking worldâs too cold.
There's nothing left to hold.

Rise above - in these times
Rise above - time to rise
