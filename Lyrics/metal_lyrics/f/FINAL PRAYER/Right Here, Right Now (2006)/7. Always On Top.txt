So much in love with this, that we discovered years ago.
I couldn't care less 'bout those who turned their backs.
No more, no more, no more of this.
No more, no more, Always on top.

The Wild At Heart or SO36,
in the park or in front of Core Tex.
Down in the pit or up on stage,
always on top.

Berlin or Stuttgart, weâre all the same.
Home is where the mosh is at.
Always on top.

So much in love with this, in love.
So much in love with this, that we discovered years ago.
I couldn't care less 'bout those who turned their backs.
No more, no more, no more of this.
No more, no more, no more of this.

Back in the van, out for next shows.
Traffic jams and cops, we don't care at all.
More stories to tell, our mums will be shocked.
Nothing can stop us, weâre always on top.
