The streets are plastered with their propaganda
Of beautiful puppets âtaking careâ,
On the path of exploitation.
Millions awake in shame each day,
In fucking shame each day.

Broken mirror - Won't let them take away.
Broken mirror - Iâm more than just my body.

A war waged upon us all, against our dignity.
Still beautiful puppets are âtaking careâ,
On the path of exploitation.
Millions awake in shame each day,
In fucking shame each day.

Broken mirror - Won't let them take away.
Broken mirror - Iâm more than just my body.

Force-fed lies of the perfect body,
For which millions suffer and die for.
I'm more than just my body.
I still got heart and soul.
