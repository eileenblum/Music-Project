Rip my heart out, burn my flesh and drink my tears.
All of this only fuels my fire.
Tie my hands, shut my mouth and blind my eyes.
Every attempt to silence me only makes me stronger.

All of this fuels my fire.
It only makes me stronger.

Can't take my heart, can't sell my soul.
Holding on to my anger forever.
I know I'm not in this alone.
I know I'm not. We all are tied together.

Empower my soul to be free.
Empower.
