A little boy came across the street.
Eyes full of fear, his mind filled with hate.
He asked a man "where do the soldiers stay",
'cause daddy told him "blow them all away".

"Five blocks down &amp; you'll be there my son",
Seconds later and the deed was done.
Fuck your beliefs, fuck the way you act.
For sending your kids to death, I got no respect.

Humanity lies in ruins.
Kingdom of heaven turned to hell.
Justice failed again.
Your world is dead...

Soldier boy far away from home
Shot in the back and left alone.
He gave his life for hypocrisy.
For oil and greed and his country.

One by one you bury your dead
Covered with lies, shame and regret.
Fuck your country, fuck the way you act.
For sending your kids to death, I got no respect.
