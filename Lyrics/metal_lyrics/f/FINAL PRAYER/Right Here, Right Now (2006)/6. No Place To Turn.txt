The wake-up call of this modern world.
Thousands of smashed bodies and suicide bomb blasts.
But still the truth is right in front, in front of us.
We pretend to be awake with our eyes wide shut.

No place to turn, no place to hide.
Another war, another lie.

Quest for revenge led to a new crusade.
Another holy war which both sides will never win.
So let this be our call to arms.
So let this be our fucking call to arms.

The wake-up call of this modern world.
Thousands of smashed bodies and suicide bomb blasts.
But still the truth is right in front, in front of us.
We pretend to be awake with our eyes wide shut.

No place to turn, no place to hide.
Another war, another lie.

But still the very truth is here, in front of us.
We pretend to be awake, our eyes wide shut.
