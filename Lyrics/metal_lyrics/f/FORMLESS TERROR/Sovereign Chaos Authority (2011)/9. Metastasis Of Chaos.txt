Creation squallâs before the sword of chaos supremacy
Infested by obscure forms of incestuous impurity
Gnawed from within, devoured and defiled from outside
Scorched manifest of our victorious ascension!!

We are the firstborn of unrest..!!
Continuously devouring the patterns of space

We exist in nothing yet dispute all
Instruments of Choronzon â¦The merciless tyrants will!!

We oppress the, flourishing of life!!
Primordial eminence, of scorn full fanaticism
CHAOS METASTASIS!!!!

Boundaryless is the source of our scornÂ 
Usurper entity â¦pale effigy of assimilation
Sovereign chaos beastsâ¦descendants of the chaos star!!

All hail the collapse of graceÂ 
All rise!!! To great the scorn bearer
The bringer of Choronzonâs Wrath
Conceiver of the firstborn of unrest!
