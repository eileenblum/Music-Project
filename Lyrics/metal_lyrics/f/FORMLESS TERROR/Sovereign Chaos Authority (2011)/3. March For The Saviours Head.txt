Malignant and merciless order of absolute hatred
Brood of obscure origin
Devourers of the guardians of sanctityÂ 
Harness the Flock for slaughter
Let the grotesque ones sharpen their swordsÂ 
As havoc embraceâs the deceased

Maggots burn in the eternal fire
Fools beholdâ¦the fire scorches does not cleanse
Mark of treason shines in the eyes of god
Burn!! Betrayers of the order of the covenant
Against your eyeâs we send the fiend of the eyeâs
For your breath myriad serpents
Bearers of the eternal havoc!!

I command desecration of the flesh
Demonization of all Dead
I restore the curse of the covenant
May nothing dwell beyond myâ¦.KNOWLEDGE!!!

I summon the abyss to disperseÂ 
Each atom a torn in godâs sight
I call forth the stygian hordes of reprisal
To march for the dead saviourâs head

I command desecration of the flesh
