Just a little, little bit of war.
A little little undeserved, I feel the disgrace.
Here I behold the fear inside us we can't stop the time.
So unprepared for us.
We stand our ground, hoping for the only thing we want.

Injust!
Why not battle now!
Why not battle now!
Battle now!

Permission, power, Prussian war. 
We can feel an order is an order, order is an order. 
An obligation is an obligation, we will solve it in the battle.
We stand our ground hoping for the only thing we want

Injust!
Why not battle now!
Why not battle now!
Battle now!

Cold-blooded, his eyes are watching.
Our luck is damned, so is the time.
Cold-blooded, the Prussian leader.
Stand your ground, with a reason.

Let's go!

Cold-blooded, his eyes are watching.
Our luck is damned, so is the time.
Cold-blooded, the Prussian leader.
Stand your ground, with a reason.
