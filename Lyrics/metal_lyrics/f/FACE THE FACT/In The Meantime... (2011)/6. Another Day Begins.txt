Another Day Begins, awoken by black aurora,
calling me to wait until darkness cloaked my eyes.
Darkness cloaked my eyes.
Standing at the edge of no faith, waiting for the shadows kiss.
Looking at the stars to see my waste of life.

As I was blinded, the stars flew by.
I seek salvation which I couldn't reach.
Which I couldn't reach.

Standing at the edge of no faith, waiting for the shadows kiss.
Looking at the stars to see my waste of life.

Finally a cry of freedom, saved from this embarrassment.
The darkness is pierced. Now the real days can start.
The real days can start.
Standing at the bridge of no faith, waiting for the shadows kiss.
Looking at the stars to see my waste of life.
