Three cars in front of the door.
Big house and a limousine.

They don't care
They don't share
They're fucking selfish
I don't eat
I don't sleep
Because I live on the streets
I know this isn't right
But this shortage calls for a fight.

Three cars in front of the door.
Big house and a limousine.

They don't care
They don't share
There fucking selfish
I don't eat
I don't sleep
Because I live on the streets

All you see is greed
Why you see, nothing but deceit?
Not a coin for me, not a coin for me

Greed, one of the seven deadly sins
Thou shall not steal, someone said in past times.
If a man can't control his greed, and gets caught,
he shall surely pay either by coin or blood.
Desire leads to coveting, coveting leads to theft.
Theft ruins the society we live in, and confines trust for its people
What would it be like without this mistrust?

Greed!
Why you see nothing but deceit
Why you see nothing but the greed
Not a coin for me, not a coin for me

Why you see, nothing but deceit?
Not a coin for me, not a coin for me
