Scared, creating fear, the best way to gain the people's trust.
Lies, telling shit, the same old trick used before.
Misleading, going on, exactly like they planned it.
Debriefing, happily, bathing in the blood money

Let's dance.

Bombs exploding, a fire burns.
Death is taking his toll.
Hundreds of casualties and a black goat to blame.
The government wins again. Again!

Scared, creating fear, the best way to gain the people's trust.
War, they want war, feelings to cold as ice.
Misleading, going on, exactly like they planned it.
Debriefing, happily, bathing in the blood money

Let's dance.

Bombs exploding, a fire burns.
Death is taking his toll.
Hundreds of casualties and a black goat to blame.
The government wins again.

Bombs exploding, a fire burns.
Death is taking his toll.
Hundreds of casualties and a black goat to blame.
The government wins again. Again!

They win again! Again!
Over and over again!
