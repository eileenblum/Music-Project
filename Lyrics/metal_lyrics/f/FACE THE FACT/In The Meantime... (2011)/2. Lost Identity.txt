We walked through this world.
Who controls your life here?
Your life in the controlling hands of a being no one knows.

Where is your life now?

Not here and when disconnected, you can see the truth.
When disconnected, you know who you are.
You're just a number, dwelling in their world.
Feeling like a powerless drone.
Change it now!

All seeing eyes are watching over you.
Forever in the grips of the unknown.
The unknown!

Not here and when disconnected, you can see the truth.
When disconnected, you know who you are.
You're just a number, dwelling in their world.
Feeling like a powerless drone.
Change it now!

Fuck this shit and
Lost identity.
We aren't free, we aren't free.
Lost identity.
Can feel the loss inside of me.
Lost Identity.

Not here and when disconnected, you can see the truth.
When disconnected, you know who you are.
You're just a number, dwelling in their world.
Feeling like a powerless drone.

Change now!
