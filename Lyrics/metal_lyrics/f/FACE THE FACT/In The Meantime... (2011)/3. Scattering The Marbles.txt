Men in grey coats.
Everywhere my eyes can see.
They Wander
EnjoyingÂ theÂ authority.

InÂ theÂ classroom,
people are taken.
She withÂ theÂ yellow star,
will be next?

March, take, gone.
March, take, starve
March, take, kill.
March, take, bury.
We won't forget,
this disrespect.

Another empty spot inÂ theÂ classroom.
She was so pretty and harmless.
Another empty spot inÂ theÂ classroom.
She scattered herÂ marblesÂ yesterday.
Pray!

Men are taking them,
like an everyday act.
Fleeing, is no option.

InÂ theÂ classroom,
people are taken.
She withÂ theÂ yellow star,
will be next?

March, take, gone.
March, take, starve
March, take, kill.
March, take, bury.
We won't forget,
this disrespect.

Another empty spot inÂ theÂ classroom.
She was so pretty and harmless.
Another empty spot inÂ theÂ classroom.
She scattered herÂ marblesÂ yesterday.
Pray!

We won't forget!
