[Halford]

Would I lie to you man
I'm your only friend
Always on your side
Till the bitter end

Vicious, vicious
Fucker, fucker

Vicious, vicious
Fucker, fucker

Let me plan you future
I know what does you good
One more step back further
What's a little blood

Vicious, vicious
Fucker, fucker

Vicious, vicious
Fucker, fucker

I'm all heart and sincere
Trusts my middle name
You can walk on water
You drown I'll take the blame

Vicious, vicious
Fucker, fucker

Vicious, vicious
Fucker, fucker
