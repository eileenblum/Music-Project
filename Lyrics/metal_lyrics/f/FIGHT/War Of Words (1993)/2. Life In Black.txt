[Halford]

Life in black

You never were there for me
No never at all
You never took care of me
You just watched me fall

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black

I placed all my faith in you
I needed you here
Christ knows what I've got to do
To rid me of fear

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black

You took me for everything
As long as I live
While There's still one breath in you
I'll never forgive

Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
Life in black
