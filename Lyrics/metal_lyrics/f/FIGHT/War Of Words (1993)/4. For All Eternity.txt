[Halford]

How can I begin to tell
Emotions can't be shared
You'd walk away than show me that you cared

Building walls around yourself
Letting no one through
You couldn't see my hands reach out to you

For All Eternity
For All Eternity
The past keeps haunting me

When I drew inside myself
I did that to survive
The only way to keep myself alive

One day you will realize
How this all began
You didn't see the child become a man

For All Eternity
For All Eternity
The past keeps haunting me

Look back in time
And fell the pain
It's yours and mine
No more again

Look back in time
And fell the pain
It's yours and mine
No more again

For All Eternity
For All Eternity
The past keeps haunting me

For All Eternity
For All Eternity
The past keeps haunting me
For All Eternity
