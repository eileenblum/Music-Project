[Halford]

The devil walked with me
He looked me in the eye
Said once I was all trouble
For the world

Then I saw the light
And now I fell the joy
Believe me now
For I bring you the world

Jesus, Jesus saves

Took me to this home
Showed me all his sin
Said this is how I used
To spend my days

Misery in hell
Master of my world
Now I've mended all my evil ways
