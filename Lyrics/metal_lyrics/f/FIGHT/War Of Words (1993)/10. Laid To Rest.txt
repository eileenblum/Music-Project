[Halford]

You never gave me what I craved for
You never took me with desire
Now I'm hanging by a wire

Laid to rest
Laid to rest

You left me waiting in your darkness
Full of fear and full of pain
I shall never be the same

Laid to rest
Laid to rest

So I'm praying with devotion
You'll still take me for a ride
Let me fill you full of pride

Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
