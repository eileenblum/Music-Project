[Halford]

See a word of suffering
Money sucking greed
Watch the human gluttony
All these mouths to feed

Contortion, contortion in my head
Contortion, All I see is red

Rape the earth of everything
Shoot it through the brain
Man remains the carnivore
Selfish and insane

Contortion, contortion in my head
Contortion, All I see is red

Money sucking greed
All these mouths to feed
Shoot it through the brain
Selfish and insane

Money sucking greed
All these mouths to feed
Shoot it through the brain
Selfish and insane

Contortion, contortion in my head
Contortion, All I see is red

Live to take and take to live
Don't put nothing back
Bleed the system never give
Hung to dry and crack

Contortion, contortion in my head
Contortion, All I see is red
Contortion, contortion in my head
Contortion, All I see is red
