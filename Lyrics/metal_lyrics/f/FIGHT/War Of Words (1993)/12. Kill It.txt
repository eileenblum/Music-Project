[Halford]

Trangress your fake religion
Sick ideology
Debased TV communion
Apology?

Contempious self indulgence
Outsides a living hell
Excessive words can't enter
This padded cell

Kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it

Infernal thoughts invading
My inhumanity
Provoked by godly judgement
Wait till I'm free

Assult the shinning icon
My temples severd head
The lambs satanic beating
Incestious bred

Kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it

Our father screams in heaven
Wounded and wire tied
Imploring for extinction
We're crucified

Accused by burning angels
Unconcious in a cage
I eat the holy bible
I am the plague

Kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it
Kill it
Kill it
Kill it
