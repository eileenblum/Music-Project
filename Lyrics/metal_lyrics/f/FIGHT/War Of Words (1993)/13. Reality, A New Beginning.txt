[Halford]

This time when I'm leaving
Who cares where I'll go
I'll walk with the sunset
Out there no one knows

Reality, a new beginning

In my imagination
I'm searching for my dream
Finding something better
More than what I've been

Reality, a new beginning

Reality, a new beginning

New day, new tomorrow
I'm not living in the past
I'm changing the illusion
I'm set free, free at last

Reality, a new beginning
