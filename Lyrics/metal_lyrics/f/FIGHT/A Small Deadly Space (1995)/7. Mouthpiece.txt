[Halford/Chaussee]

When did you,
Last look at
At where you are?

Did, did you,
Ever think,
You'd get this far?

Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!
Declined

Have, have you,
Realized,
Just where you're from?

Will the choice,
Be, be right,
By what you've done?

Transgressive!
Ingrained
Submissive!
Enchained
Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!
Declined

What about,
The point of,
Of no return?

Whilling time,
On bridges,
That, that you burned.

Obsessor!
Low Mind
Confessor!
Declined
Transgressive!
Ingrained
Submissive!
Enchained
