[Halford/Tilse]

If I could find a place
To leave this world behind.
Somewhere in time and space
Where i could ease my mind.
I'd take you there;
Where we could be alone.

No one can find this place;
The secret will be ours.
With no more pain to face;
We'll live amongst the stars.
In solitude, and we can wonder free.

Alone, at last just you and me.

Our island universe;
A world unto its own.
Forgetting all the worst of times,
They're gone,
You know we are as one
To make a life of peace.

Escape, into eternal sleep...
