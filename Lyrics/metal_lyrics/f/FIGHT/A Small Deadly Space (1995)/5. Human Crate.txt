[Halford/Tilse]

There's a man without a home,
With a girl who has no name.
There's a face in every town,
Underneath we're all the same.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on.

When the man felt down and low,
The girl was by his side.
And they walked a broken road,
With a hope that never died.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on.

If the man should find a home,
Then the girl would take his name.
But they need their open road,
For their journey is the same.

Wonder,
She has come and gone.
He is always moving on
