[Halford/Tilse/Travis]

Mind's eye in darkness,
See how they run.

Fools search for nothing,
Stare at the sun.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

Talk to the madmen,
Fill them with lies.
Now pay the piper,
As honesty dies.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

Never,
Never
Blood on their hands
Never
Into quicksand.

What's left to dream for,
This endless line.

Ladders to nowhere;
Blind lead the blind.

See how they run
There's none for me
I, stand with you

Stare at the sun
We take them in
And, we turn the screw

See how they run
Stare at the sun

Fill them with lies;
As honesty dies.

Never,
Never
Blood on their hands
Never
Into quicksand
