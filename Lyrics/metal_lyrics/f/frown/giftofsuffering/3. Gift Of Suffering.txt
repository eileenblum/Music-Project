For lies
You remember my name
For pain
I stayed so insane
My mind was so blind
That pain was always so cruel
It soiled my faith and scratched my feelings
And i fell down into the entrails of hate
Something inside of me has left
Now i'm healing my soul and that's a gift of my suffering
That pain cames so suddenly
I thought about you every day
A night without you was suffering
Was i a devil for you?
