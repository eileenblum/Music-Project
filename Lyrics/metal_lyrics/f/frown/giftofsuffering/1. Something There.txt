Don't let yourself live
Where time stands still
Where everything has lost
It's sense somewhere on
On the brink of despair
The days remained the same
And i found the need
To live fight with hategame
Living between the start
And the end
So my anger
Disappeared there
I found myself 
In the ultimate lies
I was searching
For illusion
Of life here
I wanted to change
Something inside of me
Like a blind man's power
Bound by his stick
Living a hole helpless one
It seemed i wanted to kill the man
Forced to live without hate and love
