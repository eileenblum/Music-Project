One day far in my thoughts
I'll step over the window of life
And leave for long way
One day this intense pain
I'll grip my palm deep in you
I can't hear your crying 
I can't see your face
A soul that needs a pray
I can see you inside there
Please open my palm
Which is closed
Our lives are winged
You'll be looking for me
Far away is my only shape
You are praying for my soul
I'm here forever please forgive me
I need you to believe me
Spread my wings
I haven't died
Please open my palm
