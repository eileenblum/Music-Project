Welcome to this hole
Listen to my words
I'm an old man waiting to die
My own conscious philosopher
A long time ago
I killed god and love
Renounced my own son
I was hating life and world too
Humiliating people making a mock of the ill
I hated everything under the sun
Killed my brother
I'm living slave
I learnt the anger and hate
Now i'm the old man waiting to die
I'm hateman...
Sad denied ill
I suffer for all i've done
No hope for better
I'm hateman
I've been living in the hole 60 years
In my life's depression
