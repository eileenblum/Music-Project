Voice 
You hear this cry
Last word which i understand
She dies for your love
She comes from this earth
Comes back from beyond
Sand and dust around
With your faith in your eyes
Emptiness all around
She feels darkness
Peace and silence
The flames burn
In my empty soul
Goddamn pain
On my own
She disappeared
In black cold night
She said
Take me away
And remember
We shall meet again
