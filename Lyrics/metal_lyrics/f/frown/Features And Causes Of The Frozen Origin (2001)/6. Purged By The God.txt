In a christmas eve
In a darkest hour
Under the sign of death
She concepted
At a loss and temptations
In a swoon of pleasure
She devoted
She didn't find confort
In her love, in her life
In a sin of shame
She begs for forgivness
She heals the pain by wine
You won't heal 
The pain and loss by wine
And therefore she sacrificed to god
