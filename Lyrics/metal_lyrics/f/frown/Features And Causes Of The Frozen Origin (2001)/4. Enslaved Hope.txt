They are all
Here as one
Looking for
Something
Like raindrops
From the trees
Slowly subsiding
That cold evening
It's like a death
Whispering 
Fall asleep
Rain 
But not 
Like then 
They are all
As one
I'm naivelly wait
I'm naively hope
When hope
Subsides from me
I'm turning letters
Of the past
They're all as one
Coming like a nightmare
