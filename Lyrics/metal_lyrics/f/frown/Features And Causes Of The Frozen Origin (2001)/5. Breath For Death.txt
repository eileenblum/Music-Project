Like in a shallow grave
My faith is situated
I hope that my misses
Can hear my breathing
The nights with the glass
On window pane
The voice like a wind
Unnatural look
I'm trying not to freeze
In a snow
To love and to be loved
It's like a fate
Circle without symbol
Neverending suffering
Trachery for a soul
Like a verdict of death
