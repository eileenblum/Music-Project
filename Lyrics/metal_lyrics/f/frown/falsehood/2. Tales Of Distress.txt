I believe in your love and i beat my head against the wall
You are all that god hasn't created yet trust my heart
If you don't trust my words feel it's beating till it doesn't stop
I can't neither don't want to forget our love
I dejected myself into one point
The fragment of that second
Was just mistake
Because of this i cry inside today
The fall the mistake which i'll never forget
I beat my head against the wall
It destroys me it strips my skin off
Remembering your words in my head
You got me on the top out from within
That is so disgasting
I beat my head against the wall
