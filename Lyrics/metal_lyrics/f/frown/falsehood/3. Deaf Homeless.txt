More and more you speak one thing
Deaf man waits a replay
Your reward,your little rate
He needs so much again
He wants deny yourself
I understand your words
I believe in your real thing
He's no conceited
He's no conception
Degradation around
More and more you see real world 
Deaf homeless waits in the street
Your freedom faith for all
He don't live from love
He want's deny no lies
Better as all
He needs much more
He waits in rain 
Your freedom for all
Freedom
Your faith for all
