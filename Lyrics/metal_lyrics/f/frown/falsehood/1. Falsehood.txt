I was asking myself
But i couldn't answer
I was searching for the truth
In myself i found just the lie awaken
My mind was wandering between
Good and wrong
I felt the faith
Just in myself
I know i failed
I felt the faith just in myself
I know i failed but i didn't wanna pain
The secret consists in deepness of my soul
My mind was wandering between
Good and wrong...
