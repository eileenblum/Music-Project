He lost his way in his sad fate
He felt the things in the fate
Lose the essence more and more
He coudn't stop desire
He coudn't be without
And stayed like myself
They said he looked for the face he lost
He's hidden from the other people
His shaking hands needed a help
He's waiting every day
Looking for what he needed
On my own...
There were hate and no fate at the start
Only man who lived this knew
What he was feeling
Joy was hidden in the subconscions
On my own...
No
