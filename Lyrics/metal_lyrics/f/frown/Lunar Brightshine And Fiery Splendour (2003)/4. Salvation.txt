She's like a vamp
She'd like to be satisfied
He's like a Christ
A god who loves her

Now she's gonna cry

Tears are falling on his hands
When the stone shades her soul
Severe winds bending red firs
She prays on his grave

She's gonna cry
She wants to die

Salvation...

Salvation filled lovely heart
The secrets and desires
A lily tortured by temptation
One watching the moonlapse
