Freezing October midnight
Icy outbreak of the eclipse

I'm waking up at the age
Of the forest under dim light
Shy wind is undressing the trees
Like waif unlike ghost
Shilly I look into her bedroom
She's a torch she's a well
And I'm a flame

Turris fortis mihi deus
Hot night
Shrill she was bursting
Into laugh
Witness luna

Moon is witness as the wind blows
The flame is shivering
This phenomenon is created by a magic
'Till the storm begins for the last time

She's a well and I'm the water
The moon is showing through the branches
The strange glamour has a dangerous spell
She's a torch and I'm the flame

Oh, she knows my love is everything
'Till grave she knows that story
