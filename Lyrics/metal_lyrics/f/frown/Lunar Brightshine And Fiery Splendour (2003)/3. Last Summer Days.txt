The sun is burning a window panes
And I'm losing the way in delusion
O' sweet summer no chance to focus
In the smoky room I'm searching for a bottle
That's not my day

Life for me is a suffering
Pain is knocking on the door
I can't sleep-damn caffeine
Night follows day - I'm rotting

Sunset comes slow needles smelling everywhere
Filled with the haze I'm waiting for the rain
O' sweet summer I'm unable to sin
In the smoky room I'm searching for bottle
It's not time of mine

Last summer days
Are coming to soon
I know that this symptom
Slowly fades away
A' my sweating bottle
Lover at first sight

Summer, summer
Last summer days
I'm entering to hell
Mind breaks down
I hate myself
And I'm falling into faintness
That's not my day
