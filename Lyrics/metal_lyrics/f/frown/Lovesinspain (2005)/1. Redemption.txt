I'D LIKE TO LOVE YOU EVERY DAY
SINGING SONGS FOR YOU MY GIRL
I'D LIKE TO TOUCH YOU EVERY NIGHT
PLANTING BLOOMS FOR YOU MY LOVE
PAIN INSIDE YOUÂ´VE NEVER KNOWN
WE WILL TRY TO FIND OUR LOVE
KEEPING MOURNING FOR THE LAST TIME
TOGETHER TILL THE END OF LIFE
OH PLEASE YOU
REDEMPTION FOR MY SOUL
MY BROKEN HEART BURNS FOR YOU
OH GLORY
STILL I MISS TO TOUCH
IT HOLDS ME IN MY DESIRE
I'D LIKE TO LOVE YOU MORE THAN TREES
THE TREES THAT NEED THE GROUND
BREATHING THE AIR TOGETHER WITH YOU
FOR YOU AND ONLY YOU
LOVING YOU IN WICKED FLAMES
AND HOPE THAT WE DON'T BURN AWAY
CHASING FOR YOU IN THE HOPE
IN HOPE THAT I WILL NEVER CRY
