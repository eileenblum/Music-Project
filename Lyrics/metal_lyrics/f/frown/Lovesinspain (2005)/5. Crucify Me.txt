IN THE RUINS OF THE CHAPEL
WE ARE MEETING NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
BAPTIZED BY FIRE AND WINE
WE ARE GIVING OUR BODIES TO DELIGHT
WE DONÂ´T CARE OF THE CROSS OVER US
ITâS AN EXPERIENCE OF DEAD BELIEF
AND YOUâRE CLAWING MY WHITE SKIN
BY A PLEASURE OF SCREAM
CRUCIFY ME
IN THIS EROTIC GAME
LIBERATE ME
FROM YOUR SAVIORâS PAIN
IN THE RUINS OF THE CASTLE
WE ARE WALKING NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
BAPTIZED BY DARK AND LIGHT
WE ARE GIVING OUR BODIES TO DELIGHT
LOOKING ON THE CROSS OVER US
ITâS AN EXPERIENCE OF DEAD BELIEF
AND IâM CLAWING YOUR WHITE SKIN
BY A PLEASURE OF SCREAM
