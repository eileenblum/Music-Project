CAN YOU SHOW ME AS THE NIGHT CANâT SEE THE DAWN
CAN YOU SHOW ME LIKE THE MOON CANâT SEE THE SUN
IN THE SPELL OF RAIN I CAN SEE THE RAINBOW
AFTER THE LOVE STAYED ONLY SHADE
THAT IS ALL WHAT PURSUES MY FATE
SO PLEASE LISTEN TO MY PAINFUL SOUL
OH MY DARLING GIVE BACK OUR LOVE
ON THE LIGHT OF DAY IS FALLING NIGHT
PROFOUND MISTY STAYED THE CLOUDS
IN MY MIND IâM LOSING HEART
IâM DEAD INSIDE
I LOSE YOU IN DARK I CANâT FIND
DEEP IN MY HEART STAYED RESCUEING CRY
SO PLEASE LISTEN TO MY PAINFUL SOUL
OH MY DARLING GIVE BACK OUR LOVE
