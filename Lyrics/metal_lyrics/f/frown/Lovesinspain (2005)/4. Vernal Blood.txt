SILVERY MOONBEAMS â ITâS A TIME FOR MOONSET
AND HER PALLID FACE â IS CONFUSED
HER BODYâS ENDLESS SPLENDOUR
AT THE MIRY GROUND â SHEâS HURRYING ON THE TRYST
UNDER THE STARâS GLARE â COVERING NIGHT A DEADLY MIST
HER BODYâS ENDLESS SPLENDOUR
WHY YOU RUN AWAY NOW
I WANT TO FIND MY LIFE AGAIN
WHERE I RUN AWAY NOW
I WANT TO FIND MY DELIGHT
Â´COS THE COLD IS FREEZING TOUCH
AND DARK BLOOD FROM HER LIPS
TEARS MY HEART
