SHE WAS RUNNING THROUGH MY VEINS
WAS TAKING MY LIFE AND THE REASON TO LOVE
PLEASE FATE BRING THE LOVING GIRL
AND BREAK THIS MAGIC CROSS
WHICH IS PRESSING AT MY HEART
WANNA BE PAIN OF MY HEART
WANNA BE PAIN OF MY SOUL
WANNA BE PAIN OF MY LIFE
A DARKEST STREAM OF MY EVILPAIN
SHE WAS CARESSED BY MY HANDS
WAKENED BY MOON, MADE ASLEEP BY LOVE
PLEASE PAIN LEAVE MY TEARFUL HEART
AND GIVE ME THE REST
WHICH I NEED FOR MY LIFE
CRUELTY OF THE FROST IS STRONGER THAN THE LOSS
BETTER TO LIVE THE LIFE TODAY
LIKE DYING FOR YOUR PAIN
