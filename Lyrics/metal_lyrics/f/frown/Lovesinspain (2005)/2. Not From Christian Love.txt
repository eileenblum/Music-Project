GLOOM AROUND ME
HEARTSTRINGS ARE FORSAKING ME
I MISS HER EVERY SACRED NIGHT
ON A GRAVE WHERE THE WILD SHRUB GROWS
I AM SAD FOR THE DEATH OF SUN
PALE MOON IS COVERING A DEEP GLOOMY WOOD
RISING FUME IS CHANGING TO A BLACK
STORM
AND FREEZING TEARS OF THE LAST NIGHT
CRUELLY FALLING ON THE FRAGILE ICE
TOGETHER WITH MY HEARTRENDING COLD
OH BABY SHE'S SO DEAD, SHE DOESNÂ´T KNOW DELIGHT
DON'T LOVE ME FOR YOUR PAIN,SHE PRETENDS AGAIN
