ARE YOU THINKING THAT YOU ARE
LIVING YOUR LIFE
LIKE A VAMP
STILL WAITING FOR DEATH
COSâ LOVE YOU CANâT FIND
OUR LIVES ARE RELIANT
TO ETERNAL ABJECTION
ARE WE WAITING FOR THE TIME
WHICH HAS TO COME
WHICH HAS TO COME
MAYBE THIS LOVE
WILL NEVER BE DONE
AND WE SHALL BE AS ONE
LET THE FATE TO RUN
TRY THE PAIN TO KILL
LIVE FOR YOURSELF
LET THE FATE TO RUN
TRY THE PAIN TO KILL
DIE FOR YOUR LOVE
