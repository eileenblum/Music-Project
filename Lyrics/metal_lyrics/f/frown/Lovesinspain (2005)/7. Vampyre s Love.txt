THE CUP OF WINE
ON FRESHLY GRAVE
DIE AWAY NOW
THE TEMPLEÂ´S BELLS
YOU ENTWINE ME
AROUND MY NECK
CROAKING CROWS
CRUCIFIX FALLS FROM GRACE
LIKE THE WHISPER OF THE SOULS
IN THE CRYING RED BLOOD FLOWS
THAT HEARTBEAT STRIKES A WALL
LIKE THE STAKES BURN THE MOONGLOW
FRIGHTENED CROWS FLYING SLOW
BY THE GRAVE MY HEARTWIND BLOWS
CUP OF WINE ON FRESHLY GRAVE
DIE AWAY THE TEMPLES
BELLS IN MY HEART
I AM SACRED FOR LOVE
FUNERAL FROM DISGRACE
UNDERGROUND TWO DAMNED
VAMPS FULL OF CRY
ALIVE FOR DEEP LOVE
DARKDAYS
BY DARK RIVER SIDES
AND A DEAD RIVER TRUNK
STAYED HOLEY BOAT
SO OFTEN FULL OF
LOVELY VOTES
WAS DROWING BETWEEN THE ROCKS
DARKDAYS COMING DARKNESS
LOVE SINS PAIN NO CRIMES
DEATH WILL BE OUR BRIDE
BY A DARK RIVER MOOR
AND A DEAD RIVER PATH
SURROUNDED BY FOG
SO OFTEN FULL OFâ¦
BEING WITH DEAD
SOMETIMES GO DOWN IN VOID
ALL THIS STIGMAS AND MEMORIES
WITH THE SPLEENS 
SHADES OF LOVEPAINS RUN
ALL THIS LOVING EMOTIONS
ON ONEÂ´S MEMORY THE HARD SORROW LEAVES
