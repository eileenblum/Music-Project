DARK DIMENSIONS BE MY FATE
HIDE IN COLD ALL THE NIGHT
JUST LITTLE LIGHT FROM OTHER SIDE
LIFE IS ONLY A CARRYING OF LAMP
HOPELESS TREADS A GROWING LOVE
I AM SEEING FLAMES
PAIN OF YOU IS FALLING
SO WHY YOU ARE CALLING
LIFE IS ONLY TRANCE
DAILY COMING DANCE
STREAM OF BLOOD INSIDE
SO WHY YOU TRY ME NOW
BLACK VISIONS BE YOUR DEATH
HIDE IN DARK ALL THE TIME
JUST LITTLE TOUCH FROM YOUR SIDE
LIFE IS ONLY A CARRYING OF SIGHT
LOYALTY WAITS FOR TRUSTING LOVE
WE ARE SHADING FLAMES
PAIN OF US IS GROWING
SO WHY WE ARE FALLING
