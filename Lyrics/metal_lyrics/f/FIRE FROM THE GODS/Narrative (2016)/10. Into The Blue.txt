I see the water rushing in. Wash me away

I'm sick of lying and telling myself that it's all good, it's gonna work out. Living in doubt. Running away from the truth just to accommodate you. What can I do? Tell me why I should deny who I am, and wear a disguise
Unfortunately we built our house on sand, and the tide is coming in. This is the end

I might let go, I'm not feeling this anymore. Caught in the undertow, I can't take this anymore. I might move on, I might move on. Just let go. I'm not feeling this anymore

How many mistakes, how many days till we find out how much we can take? Again and again I play back what was said in the back of my head. But that's in the past, and like life gone, yeah you know it's dead. All of this effort for nothing just to hold tight on to something dying in my hands, reeling from losing again

Another wave crashes in. This is the end

I might let go, I'm not feeling this anymore. Caught in the undertow, I can't take this anymore. I might move on, I might move on. Just let go. I'm not feeling this anymore

Take a good look around, the walls are caving in. Take a good look around, we're drowning

I see the water rushing in. Wash me away

I might let go, I'm not feeling this anymore. Caught in the undertow, I can't take this anymore. I might move on, I might move on. Just let go. I'm not feeling this anymore
