We've played this game before, but it never seems to change. We die, it still remains the same. A hidden hand in the dark, and no one seems to know how far down the rabbit hole goes

You don't ask any questions, you don't even care. You just fall in line, swallow the pill and follow
Are we all blind? Why can't we see? I can't believe we all just follow the leader. How can we evolve if we live in the shadow? I can't believe we all still follow the leader

We haven't learned a thing. We still play along. I fear the worst is yet to come, and it all falls apart right before our eyes. Too scared to read between the lines. Bury our heads in the sand. Turn our back on the inevitable end. We just fall in line, swallow the pill and follow

Are we all blind? Why can't we see? I can't believe we all just follow the leader. How can we evolve if we live in the shadow? I can't believe we all still follow the leader

Will you play the game, will you follow? Will you play the game, will you follow the leader? I'd rather be dead and buried than give in. I'd rather be dead and buried, than give up my soul. I'd rather be dead. I'd rather be and dead than give in

Are we all blind? Why can't we see? I can't believe we all just follow the leader. How can we evolve if we live in the shadow? I can't believe we all still follow the leader. Will you follow?
