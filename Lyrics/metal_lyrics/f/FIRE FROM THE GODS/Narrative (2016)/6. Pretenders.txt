It's time to go all out
Heed these words coming out my mouth
I've held back for too long
I've been feinin' to get this off my chest
And say this out loud
False messenger, false prophet
You never suffered a day in your life
You know you need to stop it
You look good as a clone, man
Live your own life and don't pretend
You don't know what it's like
To get beat down and shit on by life
I've seen it all before
Yes blood, I've been through war
Straight facts, no lies
The truth is in my hungry eyes

Let me tell you it's not easy
You better believe me
This is real
Well I know, well I know it's hard sometimes
You better believe me
Cause this is real
Now this one goes out to the people who struggle through
The ones that fight the odds and break the mold
And put it all on the line just for survival
Cause you know what it's like
You've been through the same fight
You know what it is to face the end
But for all of you that try to pretend
You don't know what it's like
To get beat down and shit on by life
I've seen it all before
Yes blood, I've been through war
Straight facts, no lies
The truth is in my hungry eyes
Let me tell you, it's not easy

You better believe me
This is real
Well I know, well I know it's hard sometimes
You better believe me
Cause this is real
Sing it with me if you know it's real
Sing it with me if you feel it too
You better believe me
Cause this is real

With our backs against the wall, we stand tall
With our backs against the wall, we stand tall
We will stand tall
With our backs against the wall, we stand tall
We will stand tall

Fucking hell, I've heard it over and over again
How you've been through the struggle
How you've been through the war
But we know that's a lie my friend
Fall back with the hate that you're spewing
Forgive him father, cause' he doesn't know what he's doing
Life's about survival, and we're survivors
So don't act like you're the only one

Let me tell you it's not easy
You better believe me
This is real
Well I know, well I know it's hard sometimes
You better believe me
Cause this is real
Sing it with me if you know it's real
If you've been there, been through the pain
Been through the hell, you know it's real
Sing it with me if you feel it too
You better believe me cause this is real
