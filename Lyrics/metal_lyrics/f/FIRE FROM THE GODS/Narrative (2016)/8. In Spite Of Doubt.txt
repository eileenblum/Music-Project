How many shots can you take at me before I give you the reaction you're looking for? How many times do you think you can push and pull and put me through the back and forth? Glory hallelujah. I've finally seen the light. Oh thank the heavens. I'm making a mess of this. Glory hallelujah. What's the moral of the story? I'm losing balance. The ground is shaking

I've fallen. I've crossed the edge. I'm fading deeper and deeper, losing perception
In case you missed the point, or been left in doubt, allow me to reiterate what I'm about. The hard times have shaped and molded me, turned me inside out. No matter what, I'll survive with the strength of I and I

Who's next? I'm gonna step into the ring. Bad boy selector. I've come to compete. Don't get it twisted. From time to time we all fall, but never mistake that for weakness. Must refocus, find my motivation. A momentary lack of concentration. Sadly they underestimate. I sit back and wait, let my strength incubate

I've fallen. I've crossed the edge. I'm fading deeper and deeper, losing perception. Inside paralyzed, reaching for the outside. Inside I will find a way to carry on and survive

I know what it takes to be me. You might underestimate but you don't hold no weight

I've fallen. I've crossed the edge. Now I'm fading deeper and deeper, losing perception. Inside paralyzed, reaching for the outside. Inside I will find a way to carry on and survive
