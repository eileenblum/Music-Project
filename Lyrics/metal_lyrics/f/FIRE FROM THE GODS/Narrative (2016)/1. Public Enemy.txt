What do you see when you look at me? Am I the byproduct of tragedy? One of the many of a lost generation, born in the ruins of a broken nation. Politics are parlor tricks. Hate and fear sold in different languages. How long will it take for you to realize that weâve had enough, and weâre over it

You can beat me, lie to me, disrespect me, see how long itâll take me to break and fall apart, as if I ainât got the heart to carry on this fight. Weâve seen the darkest nights. Damned me from the start when you label me public enemy number one. Thatâs alright, âcause Iâll take you all on
You can beat me, lie to me, disrespect me as far as you can see, you will never break me. Beat me, lie to me, disrespect me. Overseer, overseer, overseer. Am I not the future? Am I not the one to carry on the legacy? Why is the verdict out before you even heard me speak?

Well, Iâm not torn. Youâre torn. God tell me how long we can go on like this, so unfocused on the bigger picture. United we rise, divided we die, and youâre so obsessed with our demise. The epitome of tyranny, you turned your back against me. If this is war, you canât win it. You will never break my spirit. You can beat up on my body, but youâll never see me break and fall apart, as if I ainât got the heart to carry on this fight. Weâve seen the darkest nights. Damned me from the start when you label me public enemy number one

Hey, hey, are you listening?

Hey, hey, can you hear me?

It goes on and on, it goes on and on. Survival of the fittest when the hate is so strong. Unity, rebellion is the armor that I don, to combat the agenda. Brick walls for the barrier, build fear and hysteria. Drop bombs in my area. The gun is superior. This is the revolt coming live through your speaker. Canât stop, wonât stop. You will never see us break and fall apart, as if I ainât got the heart to carry on this fight. Weâve seen the darkest nights. Damned me from the start, when you label me public enemy number one
