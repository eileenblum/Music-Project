Where did we go? How could we stray so far away? Delusional, tell me that weâre not the ones to blame. I suggest you walk this lonely road to find redemption and become a hero. Resolution, donât watch the eyes. Never mind the words

A million miles away, it seems that I donât belong in this place. Is there another way? I find myself closer to a satellite
Begin drifting, mind body and soul become one. Defy the laws of gravity. Stare at the sun, challenging all reality. The glass door to my soul is shattering. The bridges to my past are collapsing. I feel new energy. This is my quickening. Transcending to a new dimension

A million miles away, it seems that I donât belong in this place. Is there another way? I find myself closer to a satellite

Float away
