Forward motion is the only option. I'm pushing hard, but the current is stronger. My heart has carried me as far I think I can go, and I could drown if I stop or I falter. The sea is full of sharks as far as the eye can see, and they can't wait for the chance to devour me. They smell the blood and they begin to circle. I gotta do my best to stay afloat. Life isn't easy like I thought it would be. I could tell you lies just to make it better

This is nothing like they show on TV, so if you want the truth just come with me. Forget everything, reject the lie you've been sold. Forget everything, reject the lie, reject the diversion
Donny told me I would make a million. I heard the force was strong with this one. I put my head down and drank the poison, but it turned out to be a pack of lies. They've always lied to me in front of my face. They told me I would make it. Join the rat race. Life isn't easy like I thought it would be. I could tell you lies just to make it better. This is nothing like they show on TV, so if you want the truth just come with me. Forget everything, reject the lie you've been sold. Forget everything, reject the lie, reject the diversion

I'm trying as hard as I can, and if I stop now I will end up a dead man. I'm trying as hard as I can, can't stop now, if I do I'm a dead man. I'm not used to that complacency like you are. That life you live, it ain't me we're not on par. No need to shine, I just grind, and I get mine
