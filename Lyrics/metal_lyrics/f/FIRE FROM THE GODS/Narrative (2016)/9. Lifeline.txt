Here comes doubt again saying I'm not good enough. Look at all the things that you've done wrong for so long. I built my own personal hell, searched the world for answers and found nothing. Oh well. It was on me to conquer the fear that was killing me and find the fighter inside

This is the only thing that keeps me breathing. I traded my pain and ignorance, when all hope is lost I live again
Have you seen the edge, have you ever walked the ledge? I have stared into the depths, there was nothing staring back at me but my body, lifeless. Caught somewhere between heaven and hell, of the stories I could tell, I'd rather not, but oh well here it is. Here's to me and the person I used to be. Now here comes my past again to devour me

You're not an individual, you're a mindless, selfish, indulgent animal. You're all alone, broken without a soul, left with nothing to call your own

This is the only thing that keeps me breathing. I traded my pain and ignorance, when all hope is lost I live again

I remember those days of pain when I was on my knees, pleading to the heavens for a god to come rescue me. Pray to thin air, it was just as I feared, my prayers fell on deaf ears. It took some time, but I woke up and found a lifeline screaming, "Wake up and open your eyes!" (bring me back to life)

This is the only thing that keeps me breathing. I traded my pain and ignorance, when all hope is lost I live again
