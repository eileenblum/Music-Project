[Music: Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Erik Nilsson]

Didn't you get tired of your own lies?
Didnât your weakness consume you from within?
You should know that this betrayal, that disguise of love
Gave me the powers beyond my own understanding
Fairy tales about happy endings, angels and black tears
I took you under my wings, I gave birth to what you are
Anger, sorrow, pain, and hatred became my best friends
Triumph and vengeance became my very will to live
Now I breathe as If every day is my last
Now I fight so my will can be done
Actually, how could I believe you
Why didn't my heart beat faster at the time
Like everyone else, believes was all that I had
Believes that you destroyed with your so-called love for me
HATE INJECTION
I BREATH THE DUST OF YOUR LIES
HATE INJECTION
FORCED TO FEED UPON THE ASHES OF YOUR MEMORY
(Buried alive)
Burned by the flames of injustice
But from the ashes I rose like a phoenix
Stronger than ever, rebuilding my life
Creating the new me, fighting against my damaged memories
Buried alive, burned by the flames of injustice
But from the ashes I rose like a phoenix x2

Now I breathe as If every day were my last
Now I fight for my will to be done
HATE INJECTION
I INHALE THE DUST OF YOUR LIES
HATE INJECTION
FORCED TO FEED UPON THE ASHES OF YOUR MEMORY
HATE INJECTION
CLOAKING MY SORROW WITH REASONS OF HATRED
HATE INJECTION
TO SLOWLY REBUILD MY LIFE IN EXILE
Give me my hate injection
