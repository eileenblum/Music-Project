[Music: Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Erik Nilsson]

Listen to the words
I'm screaming in your face
Look when I tear apart
The lies that you told
When I dropkick your smile
Into the concrete
When I rip out the darkness you fed my heart

Emptiness - the silent truth
Perseverance - inhale victory
Ferocity - let our blood boil
Vengeance - bring them their end
WHEN YOU BROUGHT ME DOWN TO THIS REALITY,
TO FACE THE TRUTH YOU KEPT FROM ME
IMPALE THE PAIN OF YOUR CREATION,
FUCK YOUR IGNORANCE LEAVE ME DEAD
Never ending hatred
That pushes me further on
That takes me to the edge
Emptiness - the silent truth
Perseverance - inhale victory
Ferocity - let our blood boil
Vengeance - bring them their end

WHEN YOU BROUGHT ME DOWN TO THIS REALITY,
TO FACE THE TRUTH YOU KEPT FROM ME
IMPALE THE PAIN OF YOUR CREATION,
FUCK YOUR IGNORANCE LEAVE ME DEAD
