[Music: Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Jimmy âJudasâ Persson]

As I lay myself to rest, painting up a pretty picture
Schematics of my life.. Total failure....

Don't even know where to begin, remembering all those lies
Living beside my shadow and looking through its eyes

I'm frightened
Embracing depression as my life is passing by
Feeling so lost. Is this real, or just another nightmare?
NO ONE CAN EVER SEE ALL THE SCARS INSIDE
MY EXTERIOR MADE UP SELF IS ALL A LIE
PROTECTING WHATâS STILL LEFT INSIDE OF ME
AS IâM BREAKING APART I CHOOSE WHO I WANT TO BE

Breaking down my inner walls and then thereâs no return
My life is filled with corrupt memories
Scars on my arms, Scars in my soul
Iâm beyond all repair

Embracing depression as my shadow is passing by
I'm still so lost. Am I dead or alive?

NO ONE CAN EVER SEE ALL THE SCARS INSIDE
MY EXTERIOR MADE UP SELF IS ALL A LIE
PROTECTING WHATâS STILL LEFT INSIDE OF ME
AS IâM BREAKING APART I CHOOSE WHO I WANT TO BE

NO ONE CAN EVER SEE ALL THE SCARS INSIDE
MY EXTERIOR MADE UP SELF IS ALL A LIE
PROTECTING WHATâS STILL LEFT INSIDE OF ME
AS IâM BREAKING APART I CHOOSE WHO I WANT TO BE
NO ONE CAN EVER SEE ALL THE SCARS INSIDE
I LONG FOR A BETTER PURPOSE, A REASON TO SMILE
PROTECTING WHATâS STILL LEFT INSIDE OF ME
AS IâM LEAVING MYSELF, SALVATION IS NEAR
