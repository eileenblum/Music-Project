[Music: Johan AldgÃ¥rd &amp; Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Erik Nilsson]

Why do my eyes sparkle?
With a desire no man shall feel
Was I created so different?
Like a lonely rose in the garden of Eve

My wounds will never heal as good as yours
My scars tell stories that you'll never understand
MARKED BY THOSE AROUND ME
MY NEEDS WILL NEVER BE FREE
IN MY WORLD, SO CLOSE TO PERFECTION
BLACK MIRRORâS REFLECTION

Itâs such a strong force within
A power beyond any promises made
Whispering voices that tells me
That my demons are here to stay
My wounds never heal as good as yours
My scars tells stories that you'll never understand

MARKED BY THOSE AROUND ME
MY NEEDS WILL NEVER BE FREE
IN MY WORLD, SO CLOSE TO PERFECTION
BLACK MIRRORâS REFLECTION

How can I see myself in you
When you change everything else
A horizon that splits this world apart
That thin line between sleep and awake
