[Music: Johan AldgÃ¥rd &amp; Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Erik Nilsson]

Marked by society, paying the cost of judgment
Didn't they hear, when a wolf told lies?
Can't they see him smiling innocently
Where the servants vision ends, the blind and deaf have to act
Strike upon the corrupted
Forced him to the white light

YOU STOLE MY MOST PRECIOUS THING
STAMPED ON HER, FORCED HER TO INSANITY
I MADE YOU ANSWER FOR YOUR SINS
I BROUGHT JUDGMENT UPON YOU

Bringer of sorrow, bringer of pain
An ambassador of mental destruction
You brought vengeance on yourself
I'll tell you everything, before I end you
Everything went black before her eyes
Her world fall apart, leaving her to you
Extending an hour to an eternity
A never ending night of tears and panic

I canât believe that my life has come to an end

Can some please reach out, and take my hand

YOU STOLE MY MOST PRECIOUS THING
STAMPED ON HER, FORCED HER TO INSANITY
I MADE YOU ANSWER FOR YOUR SINS
I BROUGHT JUDGMENT UPON YOU
Driven by hatred acting on orders from my heart
A second of silence ended your black art
