[Music: Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Erik Nilsson]

Make your stand
A feeling of independence
An un-scattered mind
No more endless nights in pain
Push forward, worthless bastards
Think, a destiny of your own
A personal meaning, finding a purpose
Avoid becoming a hollow peon
Stand as One
Assemble the legions within
Stand as one
See beyond the fallen
BLIND
DUE TO THE GHOSTS AROUND
FIND
YOURSELF WALKING BESIDE ME
You spend millions of hours
Breathing our air, devour our hope
Can't you leave us alone?
Can't you see that we're superior?
This world was made for us
Stop stealing our tears and our joy
Evolve to that within your dreams
Rise up and fly away
Assemble the legions within
Stand as one
See beyond the fallen

BLIND
DUE TO THE GHOSTS AROUND
FIND
YOURSELF WALKING BESIDE ME
TRY TO LIVE AMONG THE STARS, SMILING ON YOUR WAY TO THE COFFIN
THERE IS MORE TO THIS LIFE THAN THE DRESSED UP SHELLS IN FRONT OF YOU
