[Music: Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Joakim Strandberg Nilsson]

Killing time by losing faith
Instead of figuring out how to make a change
Giving it a try when it's too late
Got no one else to blame but themselves

They keep collecting things they do not need
Still rejecting emptiness without any dreams
Cheating creatures, betrayers to the bone
Secret meetings, meaningless unless theyÂ´re pure

Who are they to decide what's wrong?
Too much effort in making the right calls
Living in constant fear
Burning bridges and finding another wall

Sick and tired of the life they call their own
Never, ever gonna take a shot and let it go
So many believe, they did never have a choice
All over all, the slaughtering upon their soul

They keep collecting things they do not need
Still rejecting emptiness without any dreams
Cheating creatures, betrayers to the bone
Secret meetings, meaningless unless theyÂ´re pure

Who are they to decide what's wrong?
Too much effort in making the right calls
Living in constant fear just to lose it all
Burning bridges and finding another wall

Who are they to decide what's wrong?
Too much effort in making the right calls
Living in constant fear
Burning bridges and finding another wall
