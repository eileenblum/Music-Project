[Music: Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Erik Nilsson]

Reflect back over time
Do you wish for weakness again
Reflect into your mind
Scattered dreams lost forever
It feels like Iâm trapped
Within my own imagination
How come, that what I seek
Is lost into eternity

Is lost into eternity!!!
HOW CAN I
REMEMBER LAST TIME, REMEMBER THE FALL
A VISION OF SAFETY
REMEMBER THE PAIN, REMEMBER THIS FIGHT

Reflect back over time
Do you wish for need again
Reflect into your mind
Silent lies all around
I traded my strength, my solitude
For something more, something different
Now Iâm like everyone else
Trapped within fear of loneliness

HOW CAN I
REMEMBER LAST TIME, REMEMBER THE FALL
A VISION OF SAFETY
REMEMBER THE PAIN, REMEMBER THIS FIGHT

Marching down a lost road
Carry banners with empty symbols
A trapped mass, longing for an order

LIBERATED INTO THE WIND
FORESEE THE NEXT TIME, REJECT THE FALL
CLOSING MY EYES, IGNORING THE NORMS
FOR NOW THE TIME HAS COME TO FIGHT ONCE MORE
