[Music: Jimmy âJudasâ Persson, Lyrics: Joakim Strandberg Nilsson]

Caught in a subconscious state of mind
Always aware of moments that won't ever occur
Will I ever meet her again? (again)
Even if I would it could never ever be the same

So many years ago
No one ever saw it coming
Fading memories somewhere in the back of my mind
Are they lost forever?

DO YOU REMEMBER HER? ARE YOU DENYING THAT YOU STILL CARE?
I CANâT STAND THE THOUGHT OF HER EYES, SHE BROUGHT ME INTO PIECES

So many signs I wouldn't believe
Neglecting what I should have felt was real
Will I ever dare to dream again? (again?)
A persisting fear off ending up in a nightmare

So many years ago
I just can't recall the feeling
Now all I see is a pitch-black blur of pain
Tormenting me, whilst I am asleep!

DO YOU REMEMBER HER? ARE YOU DENYING THAT YOU STILL CARE?
I CANâT STAND THE THOUGHT OF HER EYES, SHE BROUGH ME INTO PIECES

I remember every single time
I remember how she let me down
I can't push this shit aside
I know she's gone forever

I remember every single time
I remember how I was so blind
I won't let it tear me down
But I can't deny I do still care

DO YOU REMEMBER HER? ARE YOU DENYING THAT YOU STILL CARE?
I CANâT STAND THE THOUGHT OF HER EYES, SHE BROUGH ME INTO PIECES

I remember every single time
I remember why she let me down
I won't ever win this fight
I can't escape from her eyes
