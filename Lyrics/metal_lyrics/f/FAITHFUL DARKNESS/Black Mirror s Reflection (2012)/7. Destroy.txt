[Music: Johan AldgÃ¥rd, Lyrics: Joakim Strandberg Nilsson]

A leap from a bridge
Never certain where it ends
Feeling the loss of power
Sense the inevitable

A sensation of ageing inside
When you think you have control
You are already lost

WIDE AWAKE AND AWARE OF REALITY
BREATHING THE FEELING OF BEING SO MUCH MORE
AND ALL THIS TIME I KNOW
WEâRE MORE THAN PUPPETS
IN THIS GODFORSAKEN SHOW

Deciding fate
Obeying others
So much left to learn

Don't, for a second, believe you have control
When everybody knows there's so much left to destroy
Destroy, there's so much left

WIDE AWAKE AND AWARE OF REALITY
BREATHING THE FEELING OF BEING SO MUCH MORE
AND ALL THIS TIME I KNOW
WEâRE MORE THAN PUPPETS
IN THIS GODFORSAKEN SHOW

I, I don't wanna see you face any more
Get out of my way or end up on the floor
I promise you won't even stand a chance
I won't ever let you be the one
The one who tries to change my life
This will never last

WIDE AWAKE AND AWARE OF REALITY
BREATHING THE FEELING OF BEING SO MUCH MORE
AND ALL THIS TIME I KNOW
WEâRE MORE THAN PUPPETS
IN THIS GODFORSAKEN SHOW
