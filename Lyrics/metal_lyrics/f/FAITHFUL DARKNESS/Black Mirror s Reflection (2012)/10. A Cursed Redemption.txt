[Music: Jimmy Persson, Lyrics: Erik Nilsson]

Pretentious bastard
Spreading empty promises all around
Donât care what you mark, what damage you do

Itâs not just about getting a profit
Our behavior reflects your private intentions
So stand up and refuse to take your bow

Why do we step aside?

From day to night we feed the strong
Without ever feeling that we belong
I guess itâs time to search for a light
Suggestions are either green or white

In your chaotic world
Declaring war, spreading disease
Promoting plagues of cursed honesty

Humanity is already lost
Our sense of purpose gone with the winds
Left to root in a world of the undying

From day to night we feed the strong
Without ever feeling that we belong
I guess itâs time to search for a light
Suggestions are either green or white

Go!
Even though you might think
Power is the bigger picture
Gain prosperity through modesty
