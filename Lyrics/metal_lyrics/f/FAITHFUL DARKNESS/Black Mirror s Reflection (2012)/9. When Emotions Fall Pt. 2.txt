[Music: Joakim Strandberg Nilsson, Lyrics: Joakim Strandberg Nilsson]

A fragile mind, frightened of what he is
And what he will become, someone full of lies
Convinced that the truth had to be set aside
To keep his precious calm

Causing agony beyond redemption
When the fatal mistakes are revealed
No way out, no return
A lesson learned

A second chance
He askes himself why?

One more time, trying all over again
Fells like a rerun of a fading emotion
Will it be different, can I ever change who I am
Another pitfall, when emotions fall

Enlighten by the complex structure of guilt and regret
(Whispers, whispers)
Is there still time to make things right
Is there another way to live?

Floating in darkness
It's time to face reality
(I can't)

One more time, trying all over again
Feels like a rerun of a fading emotion
Will it be different, can I ever change who I am
Another pitfall, when emotions fall
