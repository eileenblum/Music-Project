In a world where everything
Is controlled by numbers
There weâll strike the hardest
Weâll question your irrelevant authority

You think that suit will save you
That bills are equal bulletproof
Sentenced to pull your own switch
First a scream, then one last twitch

We are the witness
We stood by and watched
As your need consumed us all
Watch your precious empire fall

Pulverized 
Into oblivion
A new world decorated 
In dust and flames

The survival game just stared
Iâll feast upon you soon
Your statement will be heard
Every pathetic, lying last word

That suit didnât save you
Neither could bills buy you safety
We drank to the revolution
Ridding ourselves of your constitution

We are the witness
We stood by and watched
As your need consumed us all
Watch your precious empire fall

We are the witness
We stood by and watched
Retribution is finally at hand
Brothers, carry out the last command
