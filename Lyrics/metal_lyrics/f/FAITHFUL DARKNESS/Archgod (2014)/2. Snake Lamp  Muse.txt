Oh darling, wonât you please come closer
Have a second look at me
Gaze upon your masterpiece
Here I stand, weakened and demoralized
Ready to carve a scar into you

I know it was intentionally, you see
Repentance just isnât you
But my question remains
Did you ever even care?   

Indeed, some admiration beneath my mutation
I donât have your talents, coping with that balance
Both snake and muse, a seductive animosity 
You! A catatonic monstrosity

I have become surrounded 
A captive entwined 
By your indifference
A slave deprived of his chains 

Our mutual understanding gone in statistics
Your disguised betrayal reeks self-satisfaction    
Well, itâs time baby, time for retaliation
Some harmless flame-infused flirtation

Serenading watching you burn
Torn and ablaze

I have become surrounded 
A captive entwined 
By your indifference
A slave deprived of his chains 

Surrounded 
And entwined 
By indifference
Deprived of my chains 
Of my chains
