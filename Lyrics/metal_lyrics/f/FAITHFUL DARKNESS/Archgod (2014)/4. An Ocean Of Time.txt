So you placed me here
Without thinking twice about
Adding more hate to the world
Canât you see, Iâm a hater
And wouldnât hesitate
To choke you with a halo

When I start to feel
That a storm
Is coming
That righteousness is at hand
The world is a hangout for sinners
A nest for nocturnal beginners

Do not despair, thereâs an ocean of time
As physical beings, we are disposable 

Isnât it pathetic?
That I might just be
Your only true friend
The one with all the answers
Thereâs no glorious revolution
Nor that last tango
No pretty lights for you
No dÃ©jÃ  vu

When I start to feel
That a new dawn
Is clearing the sky
That righteousness had its way
We baptized the world in gasoline
And blessed it with a burning match

Perceptual values is all we were given
To match the emptiness, I was driven
To give all I had, assuming the worst
Nothing remains, ash quenched my thirst
Expecting to fail, shut up and inhale
Like the rest of mankind you will bail
Iâm just trying teaching you to sees the present
So fill up your glass, consent and prevent

Do not despair, thereâs an ocean of time
As physical beings, we are disposable 
The breaths of life are numbered
Our days were meant to end 
The cycleâs calling for us
Calling our return

CALLING OUR RETURN
