Worthless enemy
Depicting my strengths
My wrath defeated you, 
The proud faceless shadow

Stand up, you weakling
Prepare to beat me down  
I want our dance to end
I need you to judge me

Make me fall slowly
Project your dislike towards my actions 
Let me hit the concrete 
Allow it to eco as lies tells the truth

Spineless blame
Please, raise your voice
Claim your moral rights
And punish the sin 

How can I apologize
When I canât feel sorry
Denying me my only chance of repentance 

Rise, bow and bleed
Deprive my regret 

Make me fall slowly
Project your dislike towards my actions 
Let me hit the concrete 
Allow it to eco as lies tells the truth

Forget it all, the shame and sorrow  
Thereâs nothing to repair
My affections, they were never real 
And neither was my grief
