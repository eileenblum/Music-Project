Donât try to excuse your behaviour
By falling in line, obeying command
When did we sacrifice
To become a part of the machinery 

Be one before

Rule as your own 
Superior to any clone

Letâs take a stand
Against the elite
Becoming the one
To set our own guidelines  

Donât set the limits
When youâre shaping a horizon
Live like youâre free
Perspectives beyond to be
