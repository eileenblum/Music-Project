What if I told you?
That tomorrow will mark
The dawn of a new era

What if I told you?
That weâll be a part of it
As long as we intend to live

Rise, brothers of mine
Feast upon a realm 
Rise, rebuild
A nation made from empathy
Cause weâre one
And one shall rule

So letâs decide on a set of principles
Every man shall be judged
And by judgement shall he live 
So letâs forge this code in stone

Rise, brothers of mine
Feast upon a realm 
Rise, rebuild
A nation made from empathy
Cause weâre one
And one shall rule

Rise, brothers of mine
Feast upon a realm 
Rise, realize 
The end of our empires 
We should be one
And one shall rule
