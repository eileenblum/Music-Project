This ainât gonna be a false display of complaints
This is my fury 
Overwhelming the sane, raging, violent, vehement 
WE ARE NO SAINTS 
A final psychotic chapter, sanctified by me
So brothers, salute the free

Marked by the guilt
Condemned by the weak
Thereâs time been spilt
Rise, shine and bespeak  

Here we stand
With the world in our hand
Ready to command
The only life weâll ever have   
Archgods    

How often donât we neglect the certainty of joy
We pride ourselves with absence 
An endless thirst, a hunt for the sinnerâs wine  
Breathe the lust of millions
Arenât we kings of our existence
Rulers bred to be slaves

Here we stand
With the world in our hand
Ready to command
The only life weâll ever have   

Here we stand
With the world in our hand
Ready to command
As archgods, 
We are archgods! 

Weak, broken
Succumb to filth
Beaten, pathetic
Spoiled by guilt 

Here we stand
With the world in our hand
Ready to command
The only life weâll ever have   

Here we stand
With the world in our hand
Ready to command
As archgods, 
We are archgods!
