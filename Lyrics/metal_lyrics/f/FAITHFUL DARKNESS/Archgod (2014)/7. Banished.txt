You canât be very proud
Regarding that your actions failed
The holy race is extinct 
You were the first to be nailed

The earth is swarmed with sins
Neglected and left alone
We wonât pay your price through skins
Watch us from your heavenly throne

Thereâs strength within our race
Our bloody banners are held high
This world is ours to reclaim
And your paradise for us to rename

I sealed your fate with hate 
Exiled from the heart of man
Banished in shame
A broken piece in the human plan

You preached using tainted words
We wouldnât listen, wouldnât be fooled
This planet is a battlefield
Weâve armed ourselves, we wonât be ruled

I sealed your fate with hate 
Exiled from the heart of man
Banished in shame
A broken piece in the human plan
