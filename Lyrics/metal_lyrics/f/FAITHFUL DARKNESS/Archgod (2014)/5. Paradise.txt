Decimate
Pretentious words
Ritualized 
Paradise

Would you be so kind?
You see, our actions, they are entwined in delicate dance
So please, take a seat beside me
And watch your precious Eden vanish in flames
Ritualized transparent paradise justifying the
Relinquishments of fate

Thereâs nobody else to blame
We watched as the world was set ablaze
And when itâs passed, the final storm
From ruins weâll be reborn 

Equal progression towards extinction
No more formulated, fabricated distinction
We are the spawn, descendants of the dark
Marching â an army without a mark

Genetically composed failing machines
And this is beauty, because we are one
No gods will sever us or blame our virtues
A soulless mass capable of brilliance 

Thereâs nobody else to blame
We watched as the world was set ablaze
And when itâs passed, the final storm
From ruins weâll be reborn 

A ritualized 
Transparent paradise 
Justifying the
Relinquishments of fate

Thereâs nobody else to blame
We watched as the world was set ablaze
And when itâs passed, the final storm
From ruins weâll be reborn
