I might have blamed you unfairly
Compelling thoughts of resentment
The stars we collected did never shine
Nothing more than partial contentment   

Well, it might be time to face the music
To admit my faults and reject my pride 
This separation was never your creation 
Neither was it you who poisoned my view

Let my senses fade out
Beyond fear and doubt
A place where stars burn, to go and die  
With closed eyes I try - Beneath a black sky

A fallen king, whoâs lost his crown 
In his doings I see sorrow
A self-inflicted starvation campaign
To cleans and return back to zero

I witness
An empty desperate man 

Let my senses fade out
Beyond fear and doubt
A place where stars burn, to go and die  
With closed eyes I try - Beneath a black sky

I might have blamed you unfairly

Let my senses fade out
Beyond fear and doubt
A place where stars burn, to go and die  
With closed eyes I try - Beneath a black sky
