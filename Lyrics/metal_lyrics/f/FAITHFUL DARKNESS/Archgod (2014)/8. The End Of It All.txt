When the black snow falls
It dresses the world
In a new burial gown 
The winds of man are vanished
Our civilized codes are banished
Where were you in all this?
Enjoying your tranquilizing bliss? 

We all stood accused
But judgement day never came
Nor were our iniquities convicted
We didnât walk hand-in-hand
Neither stood we proud or united 
When the horizon flatlined the world
We didnât stand proud or united 
We saw the horizon flatline our world

And then there was silenceâ¦
No songs of sorrow were sangâ¦

And then there was silenceâ¦
No songs of sorrow were sangâ¦
And then there was silenceâ¦
No bravery to echo across the centuries

We all stood accused
Charged with moral obligations
Designed for the purpose to control
Keep us from revolting, strike and evolve 
Weâre all equals, just flesh and bones
Bi-products, experience the final tones
A symphony of stillness, coloured with dust
The soundtrack to the deeds of our lust   

And then there was silenceâ¦
No songs of sorrow were sangâ¦
And then there was silenceâ¦
No bravery to echo across the centuries
And then there was silenceâ¦
Only a whisper, the last breath of mankind
And then there was silenceâ¦ 
We were all born to die
