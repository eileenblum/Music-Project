How can a piece of paper
Dictate my existence 
Why is necessary assistance
A quantitative decision 

Is it impossible to see 
Beyond the norms of man and society. 
Denied by the
Corrupted Collective

I reached out, I raised my voice
Enabling my escape
From the darkest inch inside 
As I drown the voice astride 

Considered lucrative dream-machines 
Worthless shells, shaped by artificial means 
Incompetent mind-shifting drones
Labeled and archived, express-packaged clones

Is it impossible to see 
Beyond the norms of man and society. 
Denied by the

I canât change my part to play
In the symphony of life
A demanding extra 
A pretty case with nothing inside 

Is it impossible to see 
Beyond the norms of man and society. 
Denied by the
