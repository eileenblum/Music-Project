Your expectations have
taken us too far
Iâm stumbling in shadows
Iâm going to fall apart
You force me to kill and
you force me to die
But my last thoughts
you can't make me deny

You can take my life away,
but you canât take my dreams

My dreams

No one can stop us
we keep ourselves alive
Tell me you need me
donât tell me no lies
Make me your hero
make me the one
Our last journey has finally begun
From heaven to hell

The worm of your lies
they bring me to hell
Our story of misery
the last one Iâll tell
My mind and my heart
are going different ways
I shall remember you until
the end of my days

You can take my life away,
but you canât take my dreams

My dreams

No one can stop us
we keep ourselves alive
Tell me you need me
donât tell me no lies
Make me your hero
make me the one
Our last journey has finally begun
From heaven to hell
