What now, where am i now
I'm blind
I can't see the truth in my dreams
Am i crying
No more sweet happy endings
Your scream, a last cry for help

1, 2 - he's coming for you
3, 4 - better lock your door
5, 6 - grab a crucifix
7, 8 - better stay up late
9, 10 - never sleep again

Stay awake

His face, each and every night
Your nightmare
The children are playing
Singing the rythmes
For you

Smiling, laughing,
Screaming, crying
No one can help
Them from their fear
Don't lie dowm
Don't hug your pillow
Don't close your eyes

1, 2 - he's coming for you
3, 4 - better lock your door
5, 6 - grab a crucifix
7, 8 - better stay up late
9, 10 - never sleep again

Stay awake

1, 2 - he's coming for you
3, 4 - better lock your door
5, 6 - grab a crucifix
7, 8 - better stay up late
9, 10 - never sleep again
