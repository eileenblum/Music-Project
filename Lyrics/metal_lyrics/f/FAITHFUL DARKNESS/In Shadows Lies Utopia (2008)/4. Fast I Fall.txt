âDie, Die, Die, Die!â

I want to fucking die
Want to scream
Need to get it out
by bleeding and screaming
Throw stuff around me
Have to break it all
Get it out of my system
No more misery

Fast I fall
I will never hit the ground
Try to fight the ghosts
within my mind

The labyrinth never ends
Just another stop, âfuck!â
Iâll cut myself wide open and let it run down my wrists
Let my hands hide me
I donât want to be
a pathetic loser - asshole
Release me from my prison

Fast I fall
I will never hit the ground
Try to fight the ghosts within my mind

Fast I fall
I will never hit the ground
Try to fight the ghosts within my mind
