By my hand you shall die
I am your end, the last light
Thereâs no heaven
thereâs no hell
Just a second in pure silence

Hear me now when
I am screaming
Donât deny when
you canât see me

You have no life to spare
No one can escape reality
Youâll be a name in stone
No can escape reality

One step closer, come forward
You canât escape
your apocalypse
Thereâs no escape
thereâs no paradise
Just a second in pure
silence

Hear me now when
I am screaming
Don Â´t deny when
you canât see me

You have no life to spare
No one can escape reality
Youâll be a name in stone
No can escape reality

No one can escape...

You have no life to spare
No one can escape reality
Youâll be a name in stone
No can escape reality
