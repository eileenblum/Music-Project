Who are you now and
what is your purpose
Your unfaithful dreams
are spinning around in circles
Your twisted visions
are filled with all your hate
Destroyed and buried
and gone with your lost fate

Donât run away
From your dreams
âCause now itâs time to
open your eyes

So believe in what you see
Thereâs no denial as you
open your eyes
So believe in what you see
Thereâs no denial as you
open your eyes
So believe

The warriors in my mind
they have no guidance
They are left without a clue
of knowing what to do
Unfaithful dreams
are spinning around in circles
Destroyed, then buried
Itâs time to face reality

Donât run away
From your dreams
âCause now itâs time to
open your eyes

So believe in what you see
Thereâs no denial as you
open your eyes
So believe in what you see
Thereâs no denial as you
open your eyes
So believe

Donât run away
From your dreams
âCause now itâs time to
open your eyes

So believe in what you see
Thereâs no denial as you
open your eyes
So believe in what you see
Thereâs no denial as you
open your eyes
So believe
