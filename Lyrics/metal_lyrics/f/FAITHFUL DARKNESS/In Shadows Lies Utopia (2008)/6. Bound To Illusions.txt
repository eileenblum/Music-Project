Iâm screaming for your help
- can anyone hear me
Why am I speechless
my words are empty
Life is my altar
death is my release
I cannot help it
what I have become

I see your sweet shadow
Oh God, Iâm bound to illusions

So many sacrifices Iâve made
I donât belong to myself
Have cost me many wounds
my back is bleeding
The razors are cutting deeper
Iâm out of blood
Every inch is tearing me apart
I smell flesh

I see your sweet shadow
Oh God, Iâm bound to illusions
A helping hand
- the last escape
What I have created
forever gone

I see your sweet shadow
Oh God, Iâm bound to illusions
A helping hand
- the last escape
What I have created
forever gone
