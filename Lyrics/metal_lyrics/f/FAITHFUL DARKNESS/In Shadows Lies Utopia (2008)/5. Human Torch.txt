You see me, donât ignore me
feel my pain
My wounds are bleeding
because of the main conflict
All this life to be myself
Every time ending up
hearing the bells

A pile of failing, it was a waste
The scars on my arms filled with their taste of blood
Theyâre are always laughing
spit in my face
I guess they are right
- Iâm a fucking disgrace

Hit me, slap me, take my fucking life
Screaming for a hand
bring me the knife
I donât wanna live, never ever
End it, this misery - forever

Raise my hand, donât fall asleep
Lay the path to guide
the human torch
Let the flames wake you up
Lay the path to guide
the human torch

Oh please, oh my god
I canât walk that way
I must stand tall when I face death
I have to swim back
through my tears
I have to be strong
to break down my fears

Put your pieces back together
Try to live, forever

Raise my hand, donât fall asleep
Lay the path to guide
the human torch
Let the flames wake you up
Lay the path to guide
the human torch
