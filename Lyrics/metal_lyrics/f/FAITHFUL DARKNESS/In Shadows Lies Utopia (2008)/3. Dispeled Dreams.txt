A mindless talking creature
Look how they treat her
Can walk, eat, but not be
An illusion, nothing to see
Shadows feeding on my mind
I can not see, why am I blind
Seven different voices
Seven unspoken prayers

Free from pain - feeding insanity

Now Iâm crying for the answer
For the key to unlock my heart
I canât hide from me
Our precious lives

We live under supervision
We are seven weak slaves
We are seven weaker queens
Iâm swimming for fun and joy
Iâm walking endless miles for peace
Iâm scratching to be untouched
Iâm screaming to be left alone

Free from pain - feeding insanity

Now Iâm crying for the answer
For the key to unlock my heart
I canât hide from me
A prisoner in my own chains
Forged by God and Iâm their slave
Each minute is a lifetime
But can I feel immortality

Free from pain
I cannot hide
Feeding insanity
crying for answers
Free from pain
I cannot hide
Feeding insanity
I'm a prisoner

Now Iâm crying for the answer
For the key to unlock my heart
I canât hide from me
A prisoner in my own chains
Forged by God and Iâm their slave
Each minute is a lifetime
But can I feel immortality
