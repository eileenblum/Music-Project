âStorm of thoughts begins to
blow in my head
Behind the thunder lies
the tail of the dead
But there is a life
far from the exile
Try that wonderful thing
for a whileâ

The thoughts within your mind
will kill you from the inside

Fields of yesterday
where we lay our sorrow
Fields of yesterday
let the new seed grow
Tomorrow a new day will shine
Donât let the clouds bring you down
Let your life embrace the light
You donât have to live on
Fields of yesterday

When the end of days will arrive
You must have lived once to survive
Thoughts behind the eyes
the truth behind the lies
Bind them to your reality

Fields of yesterday
where we lay our sorrow
Fields of yesterday
let the new seed grow
Tomorrow a new day will shine
Donât let the clouds
bring you down
Let your life embrace the light
You donât have to live on

No one will guide you in the dark

Fields of yesterday
where we lay our sorrow
Fields of yesterday
Let the new seed grow
Tomorrow a new day will shine
Donât let the clouds
bring you down
Let your life embrace the light
You donât have to live on
Fields of yesterday
