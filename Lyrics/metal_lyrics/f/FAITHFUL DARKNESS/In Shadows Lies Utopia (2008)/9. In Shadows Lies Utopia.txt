Painting up an illusion the way
I want it to be
Creating my own paradise
- the only place where I
feel complete
Manipulated and forgotten
only remembered by my shadow
Reborn in a new dimension
Iâve found my safe haven

Never awake, never asleep
Lost in the shadow, so deep

Iâm the messenger
server of silence
Live in our world
Perfect harmony we
found in shadows
Found in shadows
A life in the ultimate sin
Walls of Utopia
Behind the walls of Utopia

Canât you scream after me
lost beneath my fleshâs request
Forever unable to see the truth
live in a shadow of a so called life
Forced to live like a ghost
a piece of flesh doing nothing
Killing myself very slowly
- dying is my way of life

Never awake, never asleep
Lost in the shadow, so deep

Iâm the messenger...

DIE
Live in our world
Perfect harmony
Found in shadows
Life is yours
Walls of utopia

Iâm the messenger...
