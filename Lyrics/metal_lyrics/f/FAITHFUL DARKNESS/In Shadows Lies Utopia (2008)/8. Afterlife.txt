I canât believe what Iâve heard
My passion has taken the final step
Over and over, I want to do the same
Join her in the next dimension

Peace, Sleep, Loneliness
Iâm drowning in pain
in her eyes I saw âcome to meâ
Temptation containing the afterlife
The bitter truth is my only salvation

I leave my life behind me now
Escaping the truth of
being left behind
Farewell, goodbye, Iâm dying tonight
Your lovely smile
will be my last sight

Peace, Sleep, Loneliness
Iâm drowning in pain
in her eyes I saw âcome to meâ
Temptation containing
the afterlife
The bitter truth
is my only salvation
Follow
Your smile into the unknown
Iâm screaming
Canât you hear my voice

Peace, Sleep, Loneliness
Iâm drowning in pain
in her eyes I saw âcome to meâ
Temptation containing
the afterlife
The bitter truth
is my only salvation
Follow
Your smile into the unknown
Iâm screaming
Canât you hear my voice
