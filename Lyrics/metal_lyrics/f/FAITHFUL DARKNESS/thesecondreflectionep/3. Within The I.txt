Did you Spin the wheel
Betting everything
You ever had
Spending everyday
As a piece of stone
Never born
Never able to die

Can I see because youâre there?
Do I feel when I touch your hair?

Through this dreams, I live my life
Millions of screams wonât wake me up
Breathing this emptiness
Born without eyes, longing for my demise

No more thoughts
Let me lose it all
The price I have to pay
To be human
Searching for answers to all those questions
Why are we here, why we are here?

Can I see when no oneâs there?
Do I feel when I press the trigger?

Through this dreams, I live my life
Millions of screams wonât wake me up
Breathing this emptiness
Born with no eyes, longing for my demise

Through this dreams, I live my life
Banished from this so call humanity
Breathing this emptiness
Born without life, longing for its expiration
