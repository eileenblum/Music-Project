When the blind stands before you
Only there and then will the realization
Of our civilisation become clear

So when the mute starts to preach
We sinners will listen
And the deaf will hear our confessions

The irony of the senses is that they only make us weaker
That real strength is beyond the rich mans wealth

Ignite the final inferno
Let tomorrows flames erase mankind
Tear down the banners of our race
A new Utopia enshrined

Marching towards oblivion
Praying for your brothers fall
The final chance is lost
Our salvation is inevitable
What we call weakness Is a treasure forgone

When the mute starts to preach
We sinners will listen
And the deaf will hear our confessions

Ignite the final inferno
Let tomorrows flames erase mankind
Tear down the banners of our race
A new Utopia enshrined
