[2 Peter 2: 1-22, 1 Corinthians 3: 10-23]

A false array
A false charade
That's how you challenge me
Vial word pay
The hammer tames
Clay lips of blasphemy
You walk the line 
Exploit mankind 
With greed and fallacy
All heresy
Condemn yourself
For all eternity

Hell [3x]

To tempt these flames I am insane
Idolatry
[8x]

Bring forth the lame
The sick and lame
Those seeking to be freed
Feel not their pain
Just what you'll gain
The filthy wads of green
Beginning of time
The ashes rise
From once great cities
Man unspared
And angels glum
With death's reality

Hell [3x]

To tempt these flames I am insane
Idolatry
[8x]

My enemy breeds inside of me, my enemy
My enemy creeps inside of me, my enemy
My enemy inside of me,
My enemy inside of me

I know your name
With pride you place 
Yourself as the king
Harm has been done
Unto the one
Who places faith in thee
Son of Beor
The man was scorned
By a speechless beast
So too with you
The accursed brood
Smiling on TV

Hell [3x]

To tempt these flames I am insane
Idolatry
[8x]
