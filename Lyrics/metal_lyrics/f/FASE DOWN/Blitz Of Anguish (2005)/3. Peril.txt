[Ezekiel 28 1-19, Isaiah 14: 12-23, Luke 10: 13-20, Revelation 20: 1-3]

Lucifer, unholy adversary
Anointed guardian cherubim
Once ordained, holy mount of God
You walked among the fiery stones
Blameless, turned to wickedness
A trade you filled with violence
Sinning, disgraced mount of God
I expelled you from the fiery stones

Untold Peril

Heart proud, account of your beauty
Your corrupted wisdom from splendor
Cast down, (were) you unto the earth
I made you a spectacle before the kings

Untold Peril

All you've shown me, is you cannot beat me
Through the murk below me, you vanished back into hell
[2x]

By sins and dishonest trades
You have desecrated your sanctuaries
How you have fallen from the heavens
O' morning star and son of (the) dawn

You said, I will ascend to heaven
I will rise above the stars of God
I will, sit enthroned (on the) mount (of) assembly
The utmost heights (of) the sacred mount(ain)

Untold Peril

Student not above his teacher
Nor a servant above his master
Beelzebub, prince of Baal a mockery
May kill the body but not the soul

Untold Peril

All you've shown me, is you cannot beat me
Through the murk below me, you vanished back into hell
[6x]
