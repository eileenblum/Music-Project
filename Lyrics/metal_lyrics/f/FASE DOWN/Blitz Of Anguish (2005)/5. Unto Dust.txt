[Psalms 90: 1-17, 2 Peter 3: 10-18, Matthew 24: 1-51]

Return unto dust
O' sons of every harem
One thousand years go by
Fleeting moment

Corporeal man is swept away
Sleep of death the body withers
Consumed by your anger
Terrifying indignation
Iniquities before you
Secret sins brought to light

All days pass away
Vultures descend
Upon the carcass
Who comprehends your power
Wrath due its dread

Corporeal man is swept away
Sleep of death the body withers
Consumed by your anger
Terrifying indignation
Iniquities before you
Secret sins brought to light

Relent Lord our God
Compassion
On your servants
Grant us unfailing love
Your mercy's hand

Corporeal man is swept away
Sleep of death the body withers
Consumed by your anger
Terrifying indignation
Iniquities before you
Secret sins brought to light
