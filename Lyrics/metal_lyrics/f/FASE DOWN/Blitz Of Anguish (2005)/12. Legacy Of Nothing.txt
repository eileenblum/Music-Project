[1 Timothy 4: 1-16, 2 Timothy: 3, 1-9, Hebrews 10: 19-39, Philippians 3: 1-21]

Legacy of nothing
Crumbling this society
Watch you beating, torching
My religion for 'tolerance'

I can see
Futile
Society
You try in vain
Struggling
You try but you cannot bring me down
To silence me

Your sensibilities 
Are as jaundiced as your passion
For progressive drivel
Where my beliefs don't matter

I can see
Futile
Society
You try in vain
Struggling
You try but you cannot bring me down
To silence me

Cry
That my beliefs assault your liberty
Fail
To see your hypocrisy
Live
With your proud sense of entitlement
Marriage of distorted ideals

Live... Die... Burn

Adultery is rising
Worship of incensed vulgarity
Prisoner to culture
Distortion of direction, blind

I can see
Futile
Society
You try in vain
Struggling
You try but you cannot bring me down
To silence me

Play the sympathy card
To your quivering audience
They bow to your prodding
I will lie down no more

I can see
Futile
Society
You try in vain
Struggling
You try but you cannot bring me down
To silence me

Cry
That my beliefs assault your liberty
Fail
To see your hypocrisy
Live
With your proud sense of entitlement
Marriage of distorted ideals

Live... Die... Burn

Victim now the master
While we're quietly loathing
Gutted and impaled, watch
As Rome falls down again
