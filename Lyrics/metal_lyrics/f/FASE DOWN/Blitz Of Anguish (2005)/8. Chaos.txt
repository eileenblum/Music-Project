[Genesis 1: 1-31, 2 Peter 3: 1-18, Jude 1: 17-23]

Heaven and earth
All forms taking shape
In his hand
Spirit moving across the vastness
Of the land
Commanding light among the darkness
Sun illuminate
The majesty of the first day

Supreme authority
Vigor cannot be swayed
O' God the sovereignty
Ruler of nations

Water and sky
Division of eve and morn
Earth to raise
Vegetation in every form
Expanse of day
Giving way unto night
All was good
Paving way for all life

Supreme authority
Vigor cannot be swayed
O' God the sovereignty
Ruler of nations

All living creatures roam the earth
With man to learn in His image
Global submission

Oh, why can't you see, through all His majesty
Hand of authority, life given to me, for all eternity
Yet we still believe, all of these things to be, improbability

Perfection was, born of chaos
Born of chaos, born of chaos
