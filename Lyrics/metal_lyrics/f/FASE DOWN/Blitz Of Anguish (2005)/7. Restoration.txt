[Matthew 11: 28-30, 1 Peter 1: 3-12, Psalms 28: 1-9 James 5: 7-11]

Worthless access I only get in the way
Futile, hopeless, profound markings of me
Once a bastion of all ambition and dreams
Look at me now
Tried once and failed, and again just to get kicked in the teeth
Trampled and killed, all of my dignity

What more can I do
I'm all but spent
When will this morbid chapter
End
When will it
End

There is hope in me
There is hope in me
There is life in me
[x2]

Another day, another jam, another obstruction in the way
Blitz of anguish, why this burden on me?
With my closed eyes: a blurred but strong memory
"Never give up"
As I move on awakened to the reality
Although I fall, I bend but do not break
Even in time, will all decks stacked against me
I find freedom

What more can I do
I'm all but spent
When will this morbid chapter
End
When will it
End

There is hope in me
There is hope in me
There is life in me
[x2]

There is hope in me
There is hope in me
There is life in me
[x2]

End
When will it
End

As I recede
My God restores
In times of need
Pulls me ashore
