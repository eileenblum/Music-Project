Bring forth the stones, you hypocrites. Self righteous dogs. Outside so clean, but so dark, and so wrong.

Lies. Mind is evil. Lies. Desire is evil. Lies. There is nothing wrong with the way we live. [2x]

Keep your secrets, darkest days. Fruitless deeds. Outside the light. Makes visible, unspoken things.

Lies. Mind is evil. Lies. Desire is evil. Lies. There is nothing wrong with the way we live. [2x]

Lies destroy. Lies tarnish. Lies rape and lies burn. [2x]
