It is for Freedom That Christ has set us free, so then let us not be burdened by the yoke of slavery. Mark my words, it is not wise to be circumcised, to be justified by the law that we must abide. Yeah, alienated from Christ we have fallen away from grace, but faith eagerly awaits the spirit of righteousness we hope to face. For Christ neither circumcised nor the others have any value. What counts is faith expressing itself through love and truth.

We Were Running the good race, what kept us from the truth? Persuasion of the dark one. For the Lord we take no other view.

The one who brings confusion will pay the penalty whoever he may be, but all the while, while I preach the law do you still persecute me? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished by the law. For those who agitate go the whole way and emasculate yourselves. You my brothers the appointed were called to rise up and be free, but do not use your freedom to indulge in sin and betray. Rather serve one another and lift each up in love. The entire law is written as this: To love your neighbor as yourself.

We Were Running the good race, what kept us from the truth? Persuasion of the dark one. For the Lord we take no other view.

I will live by the spirit [4x].
I Live by the spirit [4x].
Spirit [4x].
