As a child you were born, safe from despair
A guardian angel will lead you to care
Return to the light, the innocent world
Salvation is near, for Freedom we call
As a trooper you fight
As a hero you'll die
For an army for Freedom,
Courageous in mind
When forces of evil
In darkness collide
Give us hope, give us the pride
Bring us back to the light
Where the spirit is high
It's our journey into wonderland
Over and over again
We'll never stop we all run
Far away, not alone
To the place where the eagles fly
On wings we're riding high
Until the time will come
Anywhere, anyone
Where the rays of eternal life
Are shining to the sun
See the smile of the devil
The grimace of hell
His finger of evil is leading the spell
Hear the voice of an angel
He's calling for you
Away from the darkness, it's blazing in your soul
Where the spirit is high
For ever and ever again
We'll never stop we all run
Far away, not alone
To the place where the eagles fly
On wings we're riding high
Until the time will come
Anywhere, anyone
Where the rays of eternal life
Are shining to the sun
Bring us back to the light any time
Where the spirit is high, so divine
It's our journey into wonderland
For ever and ever again
We'll never stop we all run
Far away, not alone
To the place where the eagles fly
On wings we're riding high
Until the time will come
Anywhere, anyone
Where the rays of eternal life
Are shining to the sun
Until the time will come
Anywhere, anyone
Where the rays of eternal life
Are shining to the sun
We'll never stop we all run
