Follow the breath, the spirit of life
In Africa, Africa
Dance off the devil, dance for the light
In Africa, Africa
High up on the planes, on top of the hills
In Africa, Africa
You're close to heaven, to spirits in the sky
In Africa, Africa
Let's dance off the devil
Let's dance for the moon and the rain
Let's dance off the devil
The spirit in the sky
Take in the Voodoo for body &amp; soul
In Africa, Africa
The sound of nature is calling for you
In Africa, Africa
They answer your prayers, the voices from on high
In Africa, Africa
Spirit for the spirits makes you happy don't cry
In Africa, Africa
Let's dance off the devil
Let's dance for the moon and the rain
Let's dance off the devil
The spirit in the sky
Don't dance with the devil
Dance for the sun and the light
Dance off the devil
The spirit in the sky
The spirit in the sky
