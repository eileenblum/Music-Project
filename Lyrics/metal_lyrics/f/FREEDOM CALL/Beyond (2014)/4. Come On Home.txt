When the night comes up in town
You don't know you're up or down
Oh, no hysteria. Get up, have a perfect time
Let's sing a metal song
- Metal Song -
Let's scream for a heavy sound
- Heavy Sound -
Oh, with Euphoria
Get up, have a glorious night
And we'll dance... Bang your head or die!
Coming home, Come on Home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
Coming home, Come on Home
to the place we are longing for
Until the end of time
And we'll dance...

Shout out for friends and buddies,
let swing all ladies goodies
Oh, no hysteria
Get up, have a hellish night
Let's play a Metal song
- Metal song -
Let's shout for a Heavy sound
- Heavy Sound-
Oh, with euphoria
Take off for a crazy flight
And we'll dance... Bang your head or die!
Coming home, Come on Home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
Coming home, Come on Home
to the place we are longing for
Until the end of time
Comin' home, Come on Home
Comin' home, Come on Home
Comin' home, Come on Home
Comin' home, Come on Home
Comin' home
Coming home, Come on Home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
Coming home, Come on Home to the place we are
longing for until the end of time
