Stand tall and believe in the light of the day
When shadows appear and ghosts walk the land

A sacred unit, defenders of the realm
We are the ones to serve and die
Wary at nightfall, we all bound to an oath
And for the king we'll give our lives
When the darkness was driven to the after world
The freedom will return once again
Stand tall and believe in the light of the day
When shadows appear and ghosts walk the land
Will I rise or deny, when the curtain will fall
And brave men still hold out together as one
We trust in the power
And the light from up above
With amour and sword we will ride on
When the darkness was driven to the after world
The freedom will return once again
Stand tall and believe in the light of the day
When shadows appear and ghosts walk the land
Will I rise or deny, when the curtain will fall
And brave men still hold out together as one
For honour and pride, as heroes we'll die
As ghosts in the sky, as ghosts in the sky
Ghosts in the sky, ghosts in the sky
And the freedom will return once again

Stand tall and believe in the light of the day
When shadows appear and ghosts walk the land
Will I rise or deny, when the curtain will fall
And brave men still hold out together as one
Stand tall as ghosts in the sky
Stand tall as ghosts in the sky
Ghosts in the sky
Ghosts in the sky
