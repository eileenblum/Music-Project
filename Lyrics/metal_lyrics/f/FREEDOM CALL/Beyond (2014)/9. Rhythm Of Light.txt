In the Rhythm of Light
I got the rhythm, charged by fantasy
I got the Power of the World
I grabbed the universe
In a twilight galaxy
I'm gonna be the master of the light
In the rhythm of my heart
The rhythm of my soul
In the rhythm of the light
In the Rhythm of Light
My head is moving, my Metal faith in mind
I'm gonna cast out the demon's spell

In the rhythm of my heart
The rhythm of my soul
In the rhythm of the light
In the Rhythm of Light
In the Rhythm of time
You gonna dream forever
Fight for your vision of life
You gonna stay together
In the Rhythm of Light

Can you feel the energy, breaking out of me
Big Bang - Unchain the bonds of gravity
In the rhythm of my heart
The rhythm of my soul
In the Rhythm of Light
In the Rhythm of time
You gonna dream forever
Fight for your vision of life
You gonna stay together
In the rhythm of time
Forever fight for your vision of life
There is no reason to get rid of endless dreams
The golden answer is infinity in mind
In the Rhythm of Light
In the Rhythm of time
You gonna dream forever
Fight for your vision of life
You gonna stay together
In the Rhythm of Time
You gonna dream forever
Fight for your vision of Life
You gonna stay together
We gonna dream and fight
We gonna stay tonight
We gonna dream and fight forever
We gonna stay tonight together
For the vision of life
