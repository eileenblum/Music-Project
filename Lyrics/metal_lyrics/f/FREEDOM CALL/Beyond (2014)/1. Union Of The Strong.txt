Jump and Carry on
Ride on for a Union of the Strong
Raise your hands, hail for everyone
Jump and Carry on
Raise your hands, hail for everyone
You're gonna be the master of the night
You're gonna be the last one who will die before
The time will change for everyone
It's time for us to fly away
far to heaven's gate
And a shining starlight leads our way
Saves us from despair
The Kingdom Come. Raise the crown
Come with us...
Jump and Carry on
Ride on for a Union of the Strong
Raise your hands, hail for everyone
Calling for the master of our fate
Calling his number or create a sign
which leads us to eternity
It's time for us to ride away
high up to heaven's gate
And a shining starlight leads our way
Saves us from despair
The Kingdom Come. Raise the crown
Come with us...
