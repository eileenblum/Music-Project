In the name of Power and Glory
A circle of the strong
We're writing a new story
We are one, we are
The union of the light
Heading for tomorrow
Will be our Perfect Day
No fear and no more sorrow
We are one, we are
An alliance full of pride
Ohho, here we are
Together in Eternity
Forever staying with us
Come, Follow your Heart
Let's stand up awaiting the end of the dark
Staying with us, Follow your Heart
We trust eternally
Let's sing the tunes of centuries
And leave the past behind
Where heroes fighting agony
We are one, we are
Warriors of the light
Ohho, here we are
Together in harmony
Forever staying with us
Come, Follow your Heart
Let's stand up awaiting the end of the dark
Staying with us, Follow your Heart
Let's stand up awaiting the end of the dark
In peace eternally
Forever staying with us
Until the time has come
Forever staying with us
Until the time has come
Forever staying with us
Forever staying with us
Come, Follow your Heart
Let's stand up awaiting the end of the dark
Staying with us, Follow your Heart
Let's stand up awaiting the end of the dark
We trust eternally
Forever staying with us
Come, Follow your Heart
Let's stand up awaiting the end of the dark
Staying with us, Follow your Heart
Let's stand up awaiting the end of the dark
