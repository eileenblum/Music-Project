We are the Knights of Taragon
We are the riders of the storm
We are fighting for our deliverance
Brave at heart we stand
Let the warriors keep their faith
To decide what's sin, what's saint
Let them march through time and space so far
'til innocence remains
Ride on high, never fear that the darkness comes closer
Raise the sign, it's shining bright like the eternal flame
Wherever you're walking
Wherever you go
Take the stairs to the starlight
In the calm of the storm
Every minute, every day
Every second we kneel and pray
To find the place where the rainbow rises
Our paradise
For the fight we raise our steel
Before the battle we gonna kneel
We gonna cross the land to paradise
In the name of harmony
Let the soldier's creed get strong
To decide what's right, what's wrong
Let them fly on high to a better place
To mankind's pleasure drone
Ride on high, never fear that the darkness comes closer
Raise the sign, it's shining bright like the eternal flame
Wherever you're walking
Wherever you go
Take the stairs to the starlight
In the calm of the storm
Every minute, every day
Every second we kneel and pray
To find the place where the rainbow rises
Our paradise
In ancient times, when silence reigned
Over wasted fields
The dark will leave the barren lands
And free our destiny
We are one until the end of time
When all our spirits call
Save our lives give it all
Tear down your wicked walls
Wherever you're walking
Wherever you go
Take the stairs to the starlight
In the calm of the storm
Every minute, every day
Every second we kneel and pray
To find the place where the rainbow rises
Our paradise
