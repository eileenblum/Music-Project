Imaginations come in separate ways
Once dark, deep buried in a bygone life
Fear the emptiness in heaven
But love is blessed divine
Where demons try to take your soul at any time
Where hell will cross the heaven
Where angels fly beyond
Am I in Heaven or Hell
With the spirit and spell
Take me higher and higher away
Beyond the sun and the dark,
the flame and the spark
Take me higher and higher again
A dream world of desire, lost in a lake of tears
But the river of illusion runs and never dries
Where hell will cross the heaven
Where angels fly beyond
Am I in Heaven or Hell
With the spirit and spell
Take me higher and higher away
Beyond the sun and the dark,
the flame and the spark
Take me higher and higher again
The time will come for everyone
The eternal flame, the endless light
Will rise again, will keep the light
Am I in Heaven or Hell
With the spirit and spell
Take me higher and higher away
Beyond the sun and the dark,
the flame and the spark
Take me higher and higher again
