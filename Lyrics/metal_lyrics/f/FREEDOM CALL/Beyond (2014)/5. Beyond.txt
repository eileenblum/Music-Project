Where is the hand that leads us
Passing the darkness by
Who is the one who shows
The dragon child to fly
Where can we find the land
Where the rainbow can touch the sky
Who is the one who knows
What's right and what's wrong
Who knows... who knows
time will tell
Beyond
Beyond
Beyond - the World in your Mind
Beyond - in the Land with the Eyes of the World
Long forgotten all alone
The beauty of this land not known
Wait for the time to come
Enlighten our minds
Fighting for the inner flame
Searching for you, called your name
Know how to use the key
My mind can reach the sky
Out of time and out of space
We can find our home
We are living in another world
For Glory - Glory
We turn around and face our destiny
Beyond - the Glory of Mind
Beyond - the Land with the Eyes of the World
Beyond - the Sign of our Time
Beyond - the land with the eyes of the world
An ancient wisdom from inside
Turning out, shining bright
Shows your Elysium, right before your eyes
A castle built by rays of sun
A million minds, but always one
There's no more loneliness, no more fear inside
Creating life has always been
A story of two sides
To live your life just to survive
For Glory - Glory
We turn around and change our destiny
Beyond - the Glory of Mind
Beyond - the Land with the Eyes of the World
Beyond - the Sign of our Time
Beyond - the land with the eyes of the world
In silence we were waiting
Until the wall was fallen
From darkness, into the light

A union, to follow
The light replaces shadow
Salvation for our kind
From now until eternity
The world is safe from pain
To free your mind is our destiny
Beyond - the Glory of Mind
Beyond - the Land with the Eyes of the World
Beyond - the sign of our time
Beyond
So take the hand that guides you
Passing the darkness by
It is the hand that shows
The dragon child to fly
Then you will see the land where
The rainbow can touch the sky
And now you finally know
What's right and what's wrong
Who knows, if we'll keep our light
Who knows, if we'll keep out the night
Beyond - the Glory of Mind
Beyond - the Land with the Eyes of the World
Beyond - the Sign of our Time
Beyond - the Land with the Eyes of the World
Beyond - the Glory of Mind
Beyond - the Land with the Eyes of the World
Beyond - the Sign of our Time
Beyond
