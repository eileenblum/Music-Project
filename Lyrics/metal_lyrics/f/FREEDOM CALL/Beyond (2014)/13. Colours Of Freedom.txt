Keep the faith, keep the flame
Although dark horizons come to bring us pain
Feel the air, feel the breeze
It's just a matter of time, a matter of trust we believe
See a land far beyond
Under the darkened skies, lost in foreign hands
We will never forget, we will never regret
We never complained what ever we had
Open your eyes, no reason to cry
We'll find our way, to find our way of life
Under the Colours of Freedom
Break the seal of all our sins
We'll never forget, we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our Kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave, we'll always believe
In this glorious sign
Mysterious lights, victorious signs
Are spinning around, are dazing our paralysed minds
Turning the tide, turning the time
Out of the dark ride into the light
Open your mind, no reason to cry
To find your way, to find our way of life
Under the Colours of Freedom
Break the seal of all our sins
We'll never forget, we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our Kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave, we'll always believe
In the almighty sign
It's just a matter of time
Or just a matter of faith
We never forget, we never regret
Raise the flag of the light
The colours of Freedom you'll get
We'll never forget, we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our Kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave, we'll always believe
In this glorious sign
Under the Colours of Freedom
Break the seal of all our sins
We'll never forget, we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our Kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave, we'll always believe
In this glorious sign
