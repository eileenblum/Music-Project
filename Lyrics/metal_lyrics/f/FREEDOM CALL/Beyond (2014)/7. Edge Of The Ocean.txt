I remember, I still can see
All the waves are breaking over me
Remember everything, when times are passing by
Where the ocean flows to burning skies
A sailors heart still cries
And the storm calls my name
Ride with the wind to the Edge of the Ocean
Sail away to the ends of the world
I've been to a paradise
A world of ice
To the holy coast of gold
The wind still carries my soul
In the distance, where my heart lies
Forever the unknown ahead
I'm free under the sky when a coastline disappears
A new quest begins, another day will rise
I will fight until I die
Ride with the wind to the Edge of the Ocean
Sail away to the ends of the world
I've been to a paradise
A world of ice
To the holy coast of gold
The wind still carries my soul
Through the unknown, no land in sight
Covered by darkness, sea creatures arise
I'm on the prowl with a sword in my hands
O Lord, forgive me, this could be the end
... and I have no fear
I have no fear
Ride with the wind to the Edge of the Ocean
Sail away to the ends of the world
I've been to a paradise
A world of ice
To the holy coast of gold
The wind still carries my soul
