In a Land and a time where angels fly
In a Land of our destiny
Where the rainbow leads through heaven's eyes
You are Beyond Eternity
In a Land and a time where angels fly
In a Land of our destiny
Where the rainbow leads through heaven's eyes
You are Beyond Eternity
Every road leads up to Eden
'cause we are wanderers of the light
We are marching and we'll never stop
Never turn back, stand and fight
Hear the piper of the seven seas
He is playing on the shore
You can hear his echoes everywhere
High above the endless hills
Sing ho, sing hey. On this glorious day
Sing ho, sing hey. For a Glory day
In a Land and a time where angels fly
In a Land of our destiny
Where the rainbow leads through heaven's eyes
You are Beyond Eternity
On the stairway to Eternity
The step to the promised land
You have to climb up high eternally
Come on, join us 'til the end
Sing ho, sing hey. On this glorious day
Sing ho, sing hey. For a Glory day
In a Land and a time where angels fly
In a Land of our destiny
Where the rainbow leads through heaven's eyes
You are Beyond Eternity
In a Land and a time where angels fly
In a Land of our destiny
Where the rainbow leads through heaven's eyes
You are Beyond Eternity

You are Beyond Eternity
Where the rainbow leads through heaven's eyes
You are Beyond Eternity
In a Land and a time where angels fly
You are Beyond Eternity
You are Beyond Eternity
Where the rainbow leads through heaven's eyes
You are Beyond Eternity
