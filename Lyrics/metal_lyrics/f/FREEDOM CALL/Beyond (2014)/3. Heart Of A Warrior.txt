When you fight out there alone,
For a king upon his throne
And the realm is drowned in shadows
And you'll keep the flame of hope
Crawling through the night, we will overcome
A lightning strikes into the ground,
The battle has begun
With the Heart of a Warrior we fight, Ohooo
With the Heart of a Warrior we stand as one unite
With the Heart of a Warrior we fight
Together marching through the night
For the kingdom we hold our flags high
I can see the battlefields far beyond the hills
And the enemy proceeds to the place of their defeat
With pride we hold on till the end,
men with burning hearts
Our spirit's will go with the wind, if we ever fall
With the Heart of a Warrior we fight, Ohooo
With the Heart of a Warrior we stand as one unite
With the Heart of a Warrior we fight
Together marching through the night
For the kingdom we hold our flags high
Warrior, Warrior
With a Heart of a Warrior, Ohoo
With a Heart of a Warrior, Ohoo
With a Heart of a Warrior
