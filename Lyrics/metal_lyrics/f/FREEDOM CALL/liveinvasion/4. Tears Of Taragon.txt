There's dust in the air
On a winter morning
I hear the call of the wild
There's wind in my hair
In dreams I'm longing
To see the world like a child

All my deeds I will repent
But all my faith will never end

Fallen Angels, flying high in the sky
Fallen Angels, rescue me again

There's ice on the land
On clouds I'm walking
My face can touch the sky
The sign in my hand
All my cries for freedom
Die away in the night

All my deeds I will repent
But all my faith will never end
