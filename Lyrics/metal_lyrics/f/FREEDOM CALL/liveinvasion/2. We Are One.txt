We search a golden land
So far away from home
We ride until the end
Into the eye of the storm

Glory forever, eternity endeavour
Shades of darkness, for all the fallen heroes

Fly over seven seas
Go where rainbows rise
Our destination anywhere
Find eternal life

Glory forever, eternity endeavour
Sons of heaven, guardians of our life

We are one, until the end of time
On the run we ride
The glorious unite

Silence in the Valleys fall
Where all the spirits call
Save our lives, give it all
and light up all our souls

Glory forever, eternity endeavour
Signs of heaven, symphony of light

Run - and never die
Gone - no wonder why
Take our souls far away

Time - is passing by
Blind - forever night
We will rise again
