[originally by Wishful Thinking]

There's a shadow of man at Hiroshima
Where he passed the moon
In a wonderland at Hiroshima
Beneath the august moon
And the world remember his face
Remember the place was here
Fly the metal bird to Hiroshima
And the way a load
Speak a magic word to Hiroshima
Let the sky explode
And the world remember his name
Remember the flame was Hiroshima
