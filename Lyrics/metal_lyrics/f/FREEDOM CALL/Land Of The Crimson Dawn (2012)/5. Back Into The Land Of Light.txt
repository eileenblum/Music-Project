We are back
We are back
Into the glorious land of light

In the distance there's a light
Leads us through the misty night

Until the end we believed there's something golden

The glory day has begun, we're on our way, we're on the run
To the place, to the promised land of deliverance

Back to the light

See the tears in my eyes, reflecting new life
Heard all my cries, oh I will be there
We're longing for the time we're going back

Back to the land of light
Where the angels of tomorrow are sending ot a sign of victory

We climb the stairs up, we're coming home
To the source of life, to our peasure dome
The reason to believe, the answer to everything

More than ever, when worlds collide
Overwhelmed and full of pride
Opens the gate to heaven, divine, oasis and paradise

Back to the light

See the tears in my eyes, reflecting new life
Heard all my desperate cries, oh I will be there
We're longing for the time we're going back

Back to the Land of Light
Where the angels of tomorrow are sending out a sign of victory
Back to the Land of Light
Where the legionary eagle has landed as the eternal sign

We are back
We are back
Back to the light

Goin' back, to the land of light
Where the angels of tomorrow are sending out a sign of victory
Back to the land of light
Where the legionary eagle has landed as the eternal sign
