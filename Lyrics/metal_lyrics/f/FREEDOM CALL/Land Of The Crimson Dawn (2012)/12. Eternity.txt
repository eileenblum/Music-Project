I, I'm on my way back, there's no regret
There's no appreciation
I, I lost all my faith, it's killing the blaze
Erases the flame of glory

Wait, we wait for a sign, longing for life
It's time to ride, we're riding the sky
There's no need to cry

Flying free like and eagle
On the way to eternity
No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain

I, I fell of the track, dropped of the edge
by a slam of my self damnation
I, I'm taking the blame, but memories remain
Raising the lust for living

Wait, we wait for a sign, longing for life
It's time to ride, we're riding the sky
There's no need to cry

Flying free like and eagle
On the way to eternity
No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody's gonna get a flame inside
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody's gonna get a flame inside

Flying free like and eagle
On the way to eternity
No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain

Flying free like and eagle
Spread your wings and glide away
Live your dream, live forever
United in harmony
