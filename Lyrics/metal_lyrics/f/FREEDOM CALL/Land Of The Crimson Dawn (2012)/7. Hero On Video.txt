Hero on video
The hero on video

It smells like revolution
But you've never gone astray
Through an endless persecution, of heroes on video

Hear the squeak hinge down on the back door
Knock, knock! Who comes around?
Come and go, go
Come we go, we'll never surrender

Goodbye, bad times
Bang Bang for a good time
Goodbye, bad time
Bang Bang for a big time

Bang Bang for a big time

Bang Bang, who is the bad boy
Band Bang, who's gonna get the gun
Big time, who is the hero
The hero on video

On the final destination
you can touch the devils hand
No mercy, no salvation, for heroes on video

Shut them more, as higher is the score
In the everlasting game
Come and go, go
Come we go, we'll never surrender

Goodbye, bad times
Bang Bang for a good time
Goodbye, bad time
Bang Bang for a big time

Bang Bang, who is the bad boy
Band Bang, who's gonna get the gun
Big time, who is the hero
The hero on video

Bang Bang, who is the bad boy
Band Bang, who's gonna get the gun
Big time, who is the hero
The hero on video

Hero on video

Bang Bang, who is the bad boy
Band Bang, who's gonna get the gun
Big time, who is the hero
The hero on video

Bang Bang
