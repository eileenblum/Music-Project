A contest of our lost illusions,
troopers side by side
recruited for the cyber war craft
A game you're playing all the night

Never surrender don't cry, try to survive
You've always been a gambler in life
Charge your power, never hide

Imagine the victory is near
ardent we fight - to get a second life

Any time, anywhere in a virtual universe
Sometimes, somewhere,
space legends are marching on

Don't be afraid of strangers,
it's just a fictious scene
A battlefield of bits and bytes
Enemies on screen

Imagine the victory is near
ardent we fight - to get a second life

Any time, anywhere in a virtual universe
Sometimes, somewhere, space legends, space legends
Any time, anywhere, a strange and crazy world
Sometime, somewhere
space legends will be marching on

Reaching for honour by catching the ever highest score
Life in cyber galaxy,
Fast and furious tear down the wall of the universe
The final cyber call

Any time, anywhere in a virtual universe
Sometimes, somewhere, space legends, space legends
Any time, anywhere, a strange and crazy world
Sometime, somewhere
space legends will be marching on
