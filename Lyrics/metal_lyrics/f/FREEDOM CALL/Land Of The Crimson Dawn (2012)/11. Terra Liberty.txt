Another night another unholy breed
Another soul is twisting in agony
A widow's praying to the gods of salvation again
Welcome into the heart of darkness, my son

We are rising to a challenge
And at nightfall it begins
Relieve her of her majesty
And be the chosen one

See the sign, the cosmic energy
Leads your way, along the path of fame
Shades disappear, a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign, holy prophecy
free the world, terra liberty
Beyond all the fear, hearts will be strong
for the terra liberty

The crystal mountains reflect your silhouette
may your courage break the spell of the damned

In the tower, she is lost
Trapped in a cage of stone
Relieve her of her majesty
and be the chosen one

See the sign, the cosmic energy
Leads your way, along the path of fame
Shades disappear, a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign, holy prophecy
free the world, terra liberty
Beyond all the fear, hearts will be strong
for the terra liberty

And when the night comes
I can feel the wind so cold
The battle has begun
and I can hear the screams of war
for terra liberty

See the sign, the cosmic energy
Leads your way, along the path of fame
Shades disappear, a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign, holy prophecy
free the world, terra liberty
Beyond all the fear, hearts will be strong
for the terra liberty
