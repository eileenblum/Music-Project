Sometimes it seems you're invisible
What's right, what's wrong, not a discriminable
You act as a part in a digital masquerade, masquerade

Shoot them down with your gun, that's not criminal
Crash your car, how bizarre, you're not responsible
On the screen you're a gangster in a magical opera, opera

Hello, Hello, you gonna be the star in this dimension you are
You are, you are
Hello, Hello, a man in the mirror, a mirror bizarre

There is a sun in the dark
A touch of evil comes apart
All your tears, all your fears
In the end the game restarts

See the sun in the night
A big sin city light
Feel the power of the universe inside
But the game of life collides

Hush, hush, don't be shy, how cynical
No ID on the PC, so practical
You're the man in the spot of this digital masquerade, masquerade

No way back to reality, too sensible
Caught in the act, no respect, so tragical
This is the end of this magical opera, opera

There is a sun in the dark
A touch of evil comes apart
All your tears, all your fears
In the end the game restarts

See the sun in the night
A big sin city light
Feel the power of the universe inside
But the game of life collides

But the game of life collides
But the game of life collides
But the game of life collides

There is a sun in the dark
A touch of evil comes apart
All your tears, all your fears
In the end the game restarts

See the sun in the night
A big sin city light
Feel the power of the universe inside
But the game of life collides
