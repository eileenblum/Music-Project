Heavy metal screams

High speed drum attack

You can shout it out loud

Faster than the speed of light
A symphony on air

Progressive &amp; alternative
Nu metal and a little punk
On the radio, rockin' radio

The frequency's the secret
The secrets of sound
If you're cranking up your speakers
You can shout it out loud
