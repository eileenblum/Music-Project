Mindful and hones the young boy, there is nothing to complain
Sheltered and cared for in his life, the innocence remains

On the screen he's playing along
Doesn't know what's right or wrong
On the edge to the dark danger zone

He turns on the start to obsession

The evil casts a spell inside
Doesn't know what's wrong or right
Like Doctor Jekyll or else Mr. Hide

War craft, game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes, the endless dream remains

Immersed into dungeons and dragons, awake and aware
Addicted and scared to surrender, enslaved by a private chair

The evil casts a spell inside
Doesn't know what's wrong or right
Ain't Doctor Jekyll nor even Mr. Hide

War craft, game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes, the endless dream remains

War craft, dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes, the endless dream remains
Once again 

Once again, the frantic thrill remains

War craft, game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes, the endless dream remains

Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends

Annihilate the racketeers
Close your eyes, the endless dream remains
