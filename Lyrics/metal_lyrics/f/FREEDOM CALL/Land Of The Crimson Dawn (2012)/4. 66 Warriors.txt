Warrior oh warrior
Warrior oh warrior
Warrior oh warrior, 66 are warriors
Warrior oh warrior, heavy metal warrior

Warrior oh warrior, where hearts may never bleed
Warrior oh warrior, you're the guardian of my soul and destiny

Unter the could of night, a beast arises
Spreads out his claws, beneath the darkened skies, darkened skies

Blown up by hordes of evil, we smell the dust
Their blades reflecting fear, oh, no grace for us

Warriors marching on, from the light to bring us salvation
Carry on, keep the eternal light

Warrior oh warrior, 66 are warriors
Warrior oh warrior, heavy metal warrior

Warrior oh warrior, where hearts may never bleed
Warrior oh warrior, you're always standing tall and brave

Spelled by a demon curse, dare devils dance
To all the brave and all courageous ones, courageous ones

Another victory, another winning game
For dreams and fantasy, oh, the hall of fame

Warriors marching on, from the light to bring us salvation
Carry on, keep the eternal light

Warrior oh warrior, where hearts may never bleed
Warrior oh warrior, you're the guardian of my soul
Warrior oh warrior, where tears are never falling
Warrior oh warrior, warrior oh warrior

Warrior oh warrior, 66 are warriors
Warrior oh warrior, heavy metal warrior
Warrior, warrior, heavy metal warrior
Warrior, warrior, heavy metal warrior
Warrior, warrior, heavy metal warrior
Warrior, warrior, heavy metal warrior
Warrior, warrior, heavy metal warrior
Warrior, warrior, 66 are warriors

Warrior oh warrior, where hearts may never bleed
Warrior oh warrior, you're the guardian of my soul
Warrior oh warrior, where tears are never falling
Warrior oh warrior, warrior oh warrior
