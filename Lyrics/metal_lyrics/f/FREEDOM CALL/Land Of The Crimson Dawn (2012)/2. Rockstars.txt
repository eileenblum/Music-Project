I wanna be a rock star
I put my black leather tights on
Up for a motorbike ride
Motor, motorbike ride, motorcycle ride

I'm gonna be a rebel
Born to be in the spotlight
Hooked on a six string fight
Six, six string fight, in a guitar hero night

Hangingin a dream of illusions
Filled with emotions of fame

Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels

Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels

In the rhythm of a back beat
I shred my crazy guitar
Like a heavy metal star
Heavy, heavy metal star, like a heavy metal star

My exes are getting bloodshot
By the battle of the rock gods
I'm a guitar hero nerd
Guitar, guitar hero nerd,
but the best you've ever heard

Caught in a dream of illusions
Welcomne in the hall of fame

Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels

Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels

Give all you power and hold on tight
there is no silence on the way
Together riding to an endless time
forever flying to the sky

To be a rock star, in a freak show, loaded with steel
Be a rider, a fighter
Like a wannabe V.I.P.

We are rock stars
in a freak show
loaded with steel
We are riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels

Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels
