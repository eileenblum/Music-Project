Once it begins
creatures arise
Whispering your name

A foreign power
New age of thorns
Invaders come to attack

It's time to follow your inner call
with your brothers, side by side

Welcome to the age of fire,
where the phoenix flies high
back to the realm of glory,
beyond gates of light
New time has begun, when defenders unite
Hold your lance up high and stay alive

A new day awakes
The fire bird wheels high up in the sky

Up high, up high, high up in the sky

The curtain will fall - a clash of the worlds
we'll face the unholy might

The might, the might, we'll face unholy might

Brave we stand our misery
Carry home our victory

Welcome to the age of fire,
where the phoenix flies high
back to the realm of glory,
beyond gates of light
New time has begun, when defenders unite
Hold your lance up high and stay alive

The rebellion is growing so strong
We're holding on, until we're all gone
We cross the forest and climb over hills
to bring back hope for left ones at home
For left ones at home

Welcome to the age of fire,
where the phoenix flies high
back to the realm of glory,
beyond gates of light
New time has begun, when defenders unite
Hold your lance up high and stay alive
