High over the rainbow, over seven seas
Far away, see the sign, see the light in the sky

In the valley of kingdom
After the battle we won
Hear the silence of courageous souls
Resting forever

All the warriors are marching
'n riding on and on
For freedom they're longing for
Until the day their time will come

High and higher let's ride

Let's ride up high, high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away, far away
See the sign, see the sign
The light in the sky

Let's fly up high, high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away, far away
See the light, see the light
The shine in the night

In the line of fire
They keep their steel up high
Under the rays of the blazing sun
Controlled by an electric eye

At the end of the ocean
Over the top of the hills
Where the rivers of destiny
Flow in the lake of eternity

High and higher let's fly

Let's ride up high, high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away, far away
See the sign, see the sign
The light in the sky

Let's fly up high, high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away, far away
See the light, see the light
The shine in the night

Let's ride on the rainbow, over seven seas
For freedom they're longing for until the day their time will come

At the end of the ocean, over the top of the hills
Where the rivers of destiny flow in the lake of eternity
