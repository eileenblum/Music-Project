Can't wait for the time, to come together
No sleep at night, say now or never

Say, now... now we're ready to rock

The place where we are, is we're longing forever
Thousand miles on the road, on the boat or wherever

Now... now we're coming to town

To have a good time all together

Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
And tonight, for a happy metal party
Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
For a happy metal party

The crowd sounds great, the curtain falls
The band on the stage tonight is Freedom Call

Are you ready... are you ready to rock

The crew works off their ass for us
For the drums and the bass and the two guitars

Are you ready... we're coming to town

To have a good time all together

Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
And tonight, for a happy metal party
Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
And tonight, for a happy metal party
Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
For a happy metal party

Happy, happy metal party

Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
And tonight, for a happy metal party

Callers singing...
Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
And tonight, for a happy metal party

Callers partying!!
Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
And tonight, for a happy metal party
Oh, the time has come, for power &amp; glory
For a happy metal party
