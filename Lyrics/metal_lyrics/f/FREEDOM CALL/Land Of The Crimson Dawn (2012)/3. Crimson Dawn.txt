Time has come, we'll never rest
At the end of the battle we fight
No more tears, no more pain
Glory for us all

See the burning horizon, flames in the night
Oh, they rise up high

We're crossing the landscape on our way to the light
Oh, for the battle we fight

Now it's time to release our souls from all disease
A Kingdom will come, a keeper of the crown

A call for rebellion, scream for revenge
Oh, for freedom we stand

Hymns of redemption, we're singing along
A hail to the band of the strong

Now it's time to release our souls from all disease
See the sign we believe, carry on, carry on eternally
A kingdom will come, far beyond,
We are guardians of the crown

We are the ones, we are the ones
We are wanderers on the run
We carry on, we marching on
To the calley of the crimson dawn
So glorious we're standing strong
Together we keep up the sign
We are the ones, we are the ones
We are wanderers, wanderers on the run

We are an army of brave ones, with steel in our hand
Oh, for freedom we stand

By fire and sword, through the heat of the night
Oh, for the battle we fight

We are the ones, we are the ones
We are wanderers on the run
We carry on, we marching on
To the calley of the crimson dawn
So glorious we're standing strong
Together we keep up the sign
We are the ones, we are the ones
We are wanderers, wanderers on the run

We are the lost ones in the emptiness of life
No fear in darkness, not scared of loneliness
High up the mountaints, across the barren fields
We're on our way to the promised land

I am the keeper of the dawn, I'm deadlocked insane
The evil, the black, a monster inside, a factory of pain
Get away, get away let out my soul
Keep away, keep away, tear down the wall
Deliverance of evil, a dark adaption to a factory of pain

While the shades of the crimson dawn
Still hide the power of light
Breaks the sign of our victory
The seals to paradise

We are the ones, we are the ones
We are wanderers on the run
We carry on, we marching on
To the calley of the crimson dawn
So glorious we're standing strong
Together we keep up the sign
We are the ones, we are the ones
We are wanderers, wanderers on the run
