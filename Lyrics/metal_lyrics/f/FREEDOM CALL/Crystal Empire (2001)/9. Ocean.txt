The time has come
And the spell, has broken forever
It's time, I'm longing for home again

And I fly, from the eye of the storm I come
I see that shine, whereever I roam the land
I'm Alive, alive I'm riding back to the sun

Distant places, different traces far away from here
Distant places, different traces so far away

Over the mountains, over seven seas
I'm diving into an ocean
Gliding with the stream
Over the mountains, high over seven seas
I'm flying on emotions
Soaring on the breeze

A cry, the sound of my tragedy
Hear the sigh, with relief in my heart again
Peace in my mind, and I'm riding on the wind
Tell me why, tell me why I have tears in my eyes
