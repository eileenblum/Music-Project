My world around me
Lies down so cold and bare
I'm a stranger in this emptiness
Close to deep despair
Where are the sun rays
That light my barren soul
Hear my silent cry

At the end of the sunset
The night is closing in
I'm praying to the queen of the moon
Send me an angel
On my way through the sea of tears
Be the path of my destiny
And if the quest lasts forever
Out there in the void
I'll bring the eyes of creation
Back to my world

I'm your master, master of the night
Evil Pastor, devil in disguise
Save us, Save us, guardian of the light
Save us, Save us, lead us home tonight
I'm the master, master of the night
An evil laughter, death personified
Save us, Save us, be our guiding light
Save us, Save us, bring us back to paradise

Will my quest last forever?
Out there in the world
I'm searching the eyes of the world
And I pray for salvation
I can hear the children cry
I will bring back paradise
Back to my world

Until your quest is finally over
I'm waiting in the night
And in the end your soul will be my price
I' ll take you far away from timem, straight into my world
You will stay forever more, here in chains

Through my chrystal I see, my tears
I see human life, a world in harmony
Hear the children crying, so clear
Calling from the Sky
