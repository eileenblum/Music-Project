Who wants to live forever
Here in a world of shame
Living under pressure
Hearts are filled with pain

It's time
Time to break free
Time for a journey through dimensions
A neverending ride
Rays of hope from somewhere
Come from deep inside

Over and over I'm lost in bad dreams
And into the void I stare

Rise up to heaven, where eden lies
A lost asylum, somewhere beyond
Rise up forever, out of the dark
Pain and sorrow, left in the past

I'll carry on to safe my life
I'll ride on the wings of storm
I'm still alive, Free inside
My heart and soul reborn

Over and over I'm counting my tears
I' m alone with all my fears
Over and over I'm lost in bad dreams
And I' m counting all my tears
