Lost in the shadows
Where the claws of evil are waiting
Shades of treason
In a land of coldness - Forever

I'm the one who defends the world
One step closer to the end
I'm the one who prevents the curse
One step closer to the end

When I come to my land of fantasy
Where I fly on wings of harmony
All my passions inflame
When I come to my land of fantasy
Fly away from the shades of misery
Hope and passion remain

Back into reality
I'm facing greed and hate
In touch with danger all the time
It's hiding everywhere
Searching for a mystery
Somewhere in the night
A journey to my history
I'm standing up to fight

Fighting for honour
I'm praying for survival
I'm facing the end of the world

Fathers in heaven
Are steering my future
And telling me tales from the past

Almighty kingdom
I'll never surrender
That fires of passion remain
