We' re lost on the run
Without any fears we are gliding
Into the sun
Ready to follow the call of fame

We aren't the ones to die
Far from home we are strangers
We aren't the ones who cry
We are lost in the universe

Riding on the wings of time
Glorious, sartorious
Wandering the rest of life

Glorious, victorious

Lead us to wonderland
Take us all over the seas
It lies there in heavens hand
We follow our destiny

On through the night
Into the distance we're flying
Ready to fight for a world that's never dying
