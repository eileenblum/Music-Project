Together we march in time
Forever for the kingdom
Farewell to everyone
Brothers we are wild on the run

Riding high the final Race
We' ve never done before
Challenging our destiny
Brothers we are wild on the run

We carry on to make our way
Make our dreams come true
Gliding into another day
The world is our home

Welcome to the dome of pleasure
Welcome to the hall of fame
Farewell to everyone
Farewell again

Fly to survive, right to the sky
Believe in the spell of the dawning day
Fly to survive, right to the sky
High on the wings of insanity

Living in our wonderland
We never had before
We return to fantasy
Touch the heavens door
