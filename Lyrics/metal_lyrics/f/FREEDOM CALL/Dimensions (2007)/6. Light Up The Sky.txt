I stand alone in silence
I'm facing up to my fate
Oh, the time is right
I hear a voice so tenderly
Whispering to me
Oh - will my star rise?

I've been waiting for a sign, so long
Am I the one who falls from grace?
Am I the one to die?

Touch me, light up the sky
Be my oasis, be my paradise
Free me, enlighten my life
Release me forever, send me a sign

I move around in circles
I've lost my destined way
Oh - come and help me now
Turn me loose, break up the ice
Free me from this spell
Oh - come and save me

I've been waiting for a sign, so long
Am I the one who falls from grace?
Am I the one to die?

Touch me, light up the sky
Be my oasis, be my paradise
Free me, enlighten my life
Release me forever, send me a sign

When the time has come the angels fall from grace
We're believing in the sign the master sends
We're believing in the sign he sends
Hear the whisper, in the distance
Echoes die away this night

All the fallen angels drowning in their tears tonight
I'm calling for the wiseman telling me what's wrong or right
We're believing in the sign he sent
Touch me, light up the sky
Be my oasis, be my paradise
Free me, enlighten my life
Release me forever, send me a sign
