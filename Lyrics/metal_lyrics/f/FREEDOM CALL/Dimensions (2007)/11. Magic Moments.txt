With a smile on my face
I take a look in the mirror
A heavenly grace
Everything I'm doing, I'm doing it my way

Like a bird on a tree
I'm always taking it easy
And I like what I see
I feel close to heaven, close to paradise

On my way to a better life
I left behind all the darkened skies
Do you know how I feel?

Like birds I will fly through the universe
I'm gliding so silent and free
I'm searching the light of eternity
Another dimension to see

With a smile on my face
I'm still riding that highway
With pleasure and joy
I'm running free forever, kiss the world goodbye

On my way to a better life
I left behind all the darkened skies
Do you know how I feel?

Like birds I will fly through the universe
I'm gliding so silent and free
I'm searching the light of eternity
Another dimension to see

Hey man, I don't care about my destiny at all
The beauty of life is no mystery to me
Do you know what I mean?
