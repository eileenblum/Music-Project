Like a dream that fades away
My memories of sunshine days
When all the skies are turning grey
And then the nightmare starts again

The spell of the blackened sun, no time to wonder
The end is closing in, let the dance begin
The blackened sun and now we wonder
The time is running by, keep this in your mind!

The voice of reason dies away
How many more preachers do we obey?
Why do we rape our paradise?
Why do we waste this grand design?

The spell of the blackened sun, no time to wonder
The end is closing in, let the dance begin
The blackened sun and now we wonder
The time is running by, keep this in your mind!
