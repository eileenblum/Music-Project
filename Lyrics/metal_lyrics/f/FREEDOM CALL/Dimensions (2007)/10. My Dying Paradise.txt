A distant noise, a silent stream
I'm standing all alone
Surrounded by the empty space
We're roaming through the galaxies

We're pioneers, we search for land
We ride the universe
Will we find survival there?
To create a better world

I see a light, a sign of hope
A virgin paradise
I will call for you, my destiny
To set my spirit free

We are the children of a dying paradise
Come and follow us to the glorious land
We're on our journey to a kingdom far beyond
You will follow us, the way to heaven's end

A tender voice, a silent dream
An unknown mystery
My memories are haunting me
A flash of past and history

I can't foretell, I can't foresee
No one knows what's there
Happiness or tragedy
Time will tell and we will see

I see a light, a sign of hope
A virgin paradise
I call for you, my destiny
To set my spirit free

We are the children of a dying paradise
Come and follow us to the glorious land
We're on our journey to a kingdom far beyond
You will follow us, the way to heaven's end

Here I stand alone, there's silence everywhere
Neon lights throw moving shadows on the wall
A lonely dreamer, in my memories I recall
No one hears my silent cry

A distant world, a mystery
Far beyond the skies
I will call for you, my destiny
To end this misery

We are the children of a dying paradise
Come and follow us to the glorious land
We're on our journey to a kingdom far beyond
You will follow us, the way to heaven's end

[Additional verses:]

Screams of pain and agony
Rend the silent air
A flash of past and history
All I feel is a deep despair

Pain is my reality
I'm suffering alone
My memories are haunting me
Revelation, prophecy
