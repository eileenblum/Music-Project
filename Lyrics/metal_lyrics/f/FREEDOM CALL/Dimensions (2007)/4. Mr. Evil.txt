I don't wanna play this game once more
How could I ever think his game is fair?
I lost my soul the night before
Dealing with the master of despair

Can you hear his tender serenade?
A symphony, sounding through the night

Hey Mr. Evil, lord of the night
Hey Mr. Evil, demon in white

I don't want to be the fool once more
How could I ever think that I can win
No one there to save me from the fall
Cos he will never let me out again

On and on we danced the night away
Face to face, closer to the end

Hey Mr. Evil, lord of the night
Hey Mr. Evil, demon in white

Hey little dreamer
Time to wake up
This guy is not what he pretends to be
He's the devil

Hey Mr. Evil, lord of the night
Hey Mr. Evil, demon in white
