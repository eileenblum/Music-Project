Young Hearts call for rebellion
Time for revenge is near
We overcome our fears
We're screaming to show our emotions
Cry out our anger and pain
The world has gone insane

It's time, to raise our banners high
We're challenging our fate
And our star will rise

United alliance, once and for all
Raise your hands and hail - Freedom Call
Raise your voice, break the silence
A hymn for us all, we are Freedom Call
Metal is our religion
Our music is louder than hell?
All Metal rebels yell
Together we're forging a union
Nothing can hold us back
A crowd of maniacs

It's time, to raise our banners high
We're challenging our fate
And our star will rise

United alliance, once and for all
Raise your hands and hail - Freedom Call
Raise your voice, break the silence
A hymn for us all, we are Freedom Call
It's time for us - a song for freedom
It's time for you - to raise your voice

Is it real or a fake, is it all a mistake?
Is this a really strange illusion?

Is it true or a lie, is it just alibi?
We end up in a big confusion

The time is right, the time is right

United alliance, once and for all
Raise your hands and hail - Freedom Call
Raise your voice, break the silence
A hymn for us all, we are Freedom Call
