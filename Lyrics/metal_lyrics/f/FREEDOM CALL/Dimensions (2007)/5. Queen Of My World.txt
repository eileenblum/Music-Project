She never leaves me when I'm lonely
She's always there to dry my tears
Another night of strange illusions
She's at my side to rescue me

Ride on - balance of power - shine on
God given,obsession
I'm driven, by passion
Temptation, forever

She is the queen of my world
The dream of my nights and days
Source of my fantasies
She is the queen of my world
The dream of my nights and days
Source of my fantasies
She's like fire and ice

She always leads me into temptation
Another flash of fantasy

Ride on - balance of power - shine on
God given,obsession
I'm driven, by passion
Temptation, forever

She is the queen of my world
The dream of my nights and days
Source of my fantasies
She is the queen of my world
The dream of my nights and days
Source of my fantasies
She's like fire and ice

A dangerous desire, fever's running through my veins
She's feeding on the fire and she's driving me insane

I die for you, I cry for you
Ease my pain and release my soul
