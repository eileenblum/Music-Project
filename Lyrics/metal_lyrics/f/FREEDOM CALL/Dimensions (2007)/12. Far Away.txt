The fever's flowing through my veins
The sound is driving me insane
I'm gonna live my life, cos I'm not born to die
I like it, you like, we like it

Far, far, far away
Party time all night and day
Far, far, far away
On the road, no time to stay
Far from home

I'm only living for today
Entertaining is my way
I'm gonna take you to my rockin' paradise
I like it, you like it, we like it

Far, far, far away
Party time all night and day
Far, far, far away
On the road, no time to stay
Far from home

Far away from home I feel the touch of paradise
Far away from home the world is mine

Every night we play this game
Sing with us and call our name
I like it, you like it, we like it

Far, far, far away
Party time all night and day
Far, far, far away
On the road, no time to stay
Far from home
