I'm the one caught in a moment
The moment I have changed my destiny
If yesterday could be undone.....
All I want is turning back the time

Can you hear me calling?
Can you hear my cry?

Sometimes, our love is just a lie
Now I'm walking alone,
There's only empty space

There's no one else who takes the blame
No one's there who shares my inner shame
I'm longing for the afterlife
The stairway to eternal paradise

No one hears me calling
No one hears my cry

Sometimes our love is just a lie
Now I'm walking alone
There's only empty space

This love lasts forever
This love was sent from heaven
This love lasts forever
No more words of endeavour
