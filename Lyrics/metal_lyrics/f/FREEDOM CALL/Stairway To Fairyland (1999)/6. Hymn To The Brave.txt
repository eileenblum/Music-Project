The battle is over - silence reigns the land
Darkness surrounds us - death is what remains
A symphony of rage is gone - dust lies on holy ground
Raise your ashes to the wind -
you' re the chosen ones

Warm winds whisper - tales about these times
Immortal forever - give back their souls to the light
Stand up you fighters raise your head
And brave these stormy times
Pray the lord with all your faith
You' re the chosen ones

Brothers forever
Brave at heart together we fight
Holy in heaven
Will we march through space and time
Brothers forever
Brave at heart together we fight
Holy in heaven
We will ever hear their cry
