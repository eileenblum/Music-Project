I'm standing here in silence all alone
Can't decide between what's right and what is wrong
For just another day
My tears cry out the pain deep inside
For just another day - inside
For just another day

They touched the plains of Eden
They have seen, what no one saw before
Sky forces, ride horses
When you're calling me forever
I will leave and suffer here no more
Sky forces, ride horses

The time has come to fly away from home
For just another day - inside

Take a ride away
The world has gone astray
Fly on wings of hope
Reach for better day

When the journey lasts forever
We'll be riding on and on
Cause we're standing strong together
So far away from home
So come on, come on, ... now
Another day
Fear no distance, no resistance

Strong they ride
Guardians of my soul
Sky forces, ride horses
In dreams remain our visions
They will come and sands are running low
Sky forces, ride horses

Take a ride away
The world has gone astray
Fly on wings of hope
Reach for better days

When the journey lasts forever
We'll be riding on and on
Cause we're standing strong together
So far away from home
So come on, ... now
Another day

And we fly away
The world has gone astray
Fly on wings of hope
Reach for glory days
When the journey lasts forever
We'll be riding on and on
Cause we're standing strong together
So far away from home
So come on, now
Another day
