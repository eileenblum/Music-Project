Sounds of revolution, calling everywhere
It' s time, to leave the past behind
Roaming through the shadows
Crossing seven seas
Deep inside, the inner flame is alive

Running for an odyssey, far away
Hiding from our shame
To the gate of no return
Running faster, running high
A million miles away
We believe in destiny

Never stop for anything, never walk alone
Sleepwalking on endless seas,
misery and thorns
Star rise and lead me home
Powerful kingdom of happiness

Challenging the fortune, a fascination rises
Deep inside, with clarity in mind
Creeping through the emptiness
Dangerous - try to hold us back
And break the stairway down

Never stop for anything, never walk alone
In our dreams and fantasies - and my dreams are
fading
Bound to be reborn - light in the darkness
Star rise and lead me home
Powerful kingdom of happiness

Over the rainbow we' re touching the sky
Ride into distance we' ll find our way
Over the rainbow we fly to survive
Glide on illusions of better days

Demon shadows, master of sorrow
Try to catch our soul
Salvation is on the way

Never stop for anything, never walk alone
Keep our faith in prophecy -
my dreams are fading
The power of the crown - hold the crown
Star rise and lead me home
Powerful kingdom of happiness
