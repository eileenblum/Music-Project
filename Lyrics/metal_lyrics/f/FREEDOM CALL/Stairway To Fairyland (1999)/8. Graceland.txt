In a time of loneliness
Years gone by
Time of sadness
Tried to survive

We saw a land so glorious
Far beyond the sun
Let us ride away, and we're

Touching this sky tonight
Dreams have fallen, voices calling
And together we will spread our wings and fly
darkness falling, heroes calling
Forever for the love - forever for the flame inside
Hope has fallen, winds are calling

Once upon a time the world was in distress
But now we live in peace united - till the end

Forever in a land of grace and glory
My soul is free of pain
And the children tell us stories
That harmony remains
Forever in a land of grace and glory

My heart will live again
And the children tell us stories
That happiness remains

Watching the sky, the light
Stranger's walking, creatures talking
And return to the sun, escape from the night
Darkness falling, shadows crawling
Oh you pray to you're god and you pray
for eternal life
Times are turning, planets burning
