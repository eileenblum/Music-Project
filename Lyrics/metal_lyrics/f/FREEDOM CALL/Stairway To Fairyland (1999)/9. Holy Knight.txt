In times of war we fight
Where spirits of vengeance collide
Paralyzed fear deep inside
Voices calling "raise your head and hail"
One step in mind, two for the fight
Across the fields of pain we march
Glory to the land

Holy knight, guiding light
Give us hope and feel our desire
No more fear, no more pain
Save us, the human race, freedom

We stand up awaiting the dawn
By daylight, the kingdom is born
Our fortune is to bury wars
Love and peace for all
One step in mind, two for the fight
A world in rage falls in decline
Leave it all behind

Hear the forces calling
We will raise our heads up high
Feels the forces roaring
They will ride across the sky

Is it our reality
To live a life in agony
Everything that we have done
Burned the place where we belong

Calling, calling, raise your head
Crying, crying, raise your head

Fall from grace, take us home
Face to face, pray till the end of time
