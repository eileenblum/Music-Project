Tonight - before the day begins another game
It's time for us to break away from shame
All these false illusions everywhere
In dreams we' re loosing our despair
We have to search for new horizons

Curios - Voices talk to us
Telling tales too us
Let us fly

All the roads that lead to nowhere
In circles we run around
Madness we have found
And we' re running
out of clarity
All these things that seem to be
We have turn away this nightmare

Furious - Freedom calls for us
Rising more in us
For our life

When tears are falling - strangers calling
They will take us somewhere far from time
When tears are falling - strangers calling
See the sun will rise for us again

So I close my eyes to ease the pain
I realize that I' m not insane
And will fly away forever

Glorious - Pain has has gone from us
Peace for all of us
In our minds
