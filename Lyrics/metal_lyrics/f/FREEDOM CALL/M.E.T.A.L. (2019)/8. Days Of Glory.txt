An ancient machine, the world's never seen
A blinding light
The soil liquefies, I am mystified
A gate in sight

Something from past in time beyond a world we know
Slowly draws me to the unknown

I am
Flying to eternity
A guardian of time
Days of glory will reveal again
Bound dimensions leading me
A history renewed
And the darkness will never rise again
Freedom calls

A traveler in time, a soldier of life
Haunting the rogue
Future and past are fusing at last
Signs of hope

A storm was banished and origins been preserved
Infinity is on my side

I am
Flying to eternity
A guardian of time
Days of glory will reveal again
Bound dimensions leading me
A history renewed
And the darkness will never rise again
Freedom calls

I am
Flying to eternity
A guardian of time
Days of glory will reveal again
Bound dimensions leading me
A history renewed
And the darkness will never rise again
