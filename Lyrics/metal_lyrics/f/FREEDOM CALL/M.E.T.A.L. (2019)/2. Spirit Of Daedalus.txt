On the isle of the king
Built a maze for the beast
Once to serve, but fallen in disgrace

Across the boundaries
Driven by the will to flee
Summon the gods to lead the final way

Once in a paradise, of heroes, kings and hope
The fate was sealed as the betrayal had been done

Wings in the sky flying so high
Beyond the world
We are brave to the bone
Riding the storm
Reunion in freedom
Stay among the sun I yell
His feather robe in flames... he fell too young
But it awaits
The afterlife

From the highest cliff we fall
Obey your inner call
The moment's right to face your destiny

The power of the wind
Will carry us away
Its time to leave the coastline far behind

Once in a paradise, of tales and ancient lords
Brave men re-challenge fate and legends come to life

Wings in the sky flying so high
Beyond the world
We are brave to the bone
Riding the storm
Reunion in freedom
Stay among the sun I yell
His feather robe in flames... he fell too young
But it awaits
The afterlife

Wings in the sky flying so high
Beyond the world
We are brave to the bone
Riding the storm
Reunion in freedom
Stay among the sun I yell
His feather robe in flames... he fell too young
But it awaits...
