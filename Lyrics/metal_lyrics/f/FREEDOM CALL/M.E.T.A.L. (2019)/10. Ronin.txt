Abandoned and lost I am riding on
Towards the kingdom of the sun
Forgotten, redeemer
Insurgent, believer
Loyal and brave one Kingdoms son
Searching another glorious dawn
Rebellion, defender
I'll never surrender

A wandering spirit worn by the wind
Rise to be born once again

Master, fighter, valiant rider
Hero of a magic land
Kings, empires, drowned in fire
Fate of a courageous man
With honour and glory
So I will die
Until the end I'll carry on

I follow the path I once did chose
A world in between of right and wrong
Forgotten, redeemer
Insurgent, believer
Salvation I'll seek another day
If there is no master to lead my way
Rebellion, defender
I'll never surrender

A wandering spirit caught in the void
Rise from beyond to carry on

Master, fighter, valiant rider
Hero of a magic land
Kings, empires, drowned in fire
Fate of a courageous man
With honour and glory
So I will die
Until the end I'll carry on

Master, fighter, valiant rider
Hero of a magic land
Kings, empires, drowned in fire
Fate of a courageous man
With honour and glory
So I will die
