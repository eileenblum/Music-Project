Play The Ace of the Unicorn

Dive into our universe
Fly over seven seas to paradise
Under the spell of the unicorn
Take my hand, come follow me
Signs show the final steps to fairyland
Into the Land of the Warriors

We're still believing in the sign of a new kingdom
And we're receiving all the hope of destiny

Play The Ace of the Unicorn

Did you take the stairs to the fairyland?
Did you ride the rainbow to the end?
Have you ever been far from beyond?
Play The Ace of the Unicorn

Take me to another world
Take down the ghost inside of lonely hearts
Under the spell of the Unicorn

We're still believing in the sign of a new kingdom
And we're receiving all the hope of destiny
