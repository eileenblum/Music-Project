Hear my cry, lost in fear
Thousand miles from home my real world disappears
Feel the wind in my hair
Feel the breeze and smell the air
Free my mind, free my soul

The sound of the waves you can hear it
I look at the skies you can see
Take me to that magic place and fly

Sail away, sail away
Through thunder and lightning, hooray!
Sail away, sail away
Over seas of darkness away
Sail, sail away
Beyond all space and time
Welcome to a world divine

Lost in time, lost in space
Alone amid the waves
To survive, to believe

In visions that come to deceive me
With fear in my heart, hear my sigh
I will never, now and forever die

Sail away, sail away
Through thunder and lightning, hooray!
Sail away, sail away
Over seas of darkness away
Sail, sail away
Beyond all space and time
Welcome to a world divine
Welcome to a world divine

Sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away
Sail, sail away
Welcome to a world divine

Sail away
Through thunder and lightning, hooray!
Sail away, sail away
Over seas of darkness away
Sail, sail away
Beyond all space and time
Welcome to a world divine
