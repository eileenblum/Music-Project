Now it's time to get the answers
For a million things to know
The moment of creation far away

And it's time to get the answers
Our minds just need to know
On a night the guardians denied

When the darkest dreams are closer
And the end of days are coming from below
When the clouds of fate are leaving
And destiny comes back to paradise

Come and fly with us
High over the rainbow
Riding on wings of our time
Come and fly with us
Right over the rainbow
Wearing the rings of our kind
The march of the time

It's time to find the reason
For a million ways to go
In a time where sadness seems to grow

When the darkest dreams are closer
And the end of days are coming from below
When the clouds of fate are leaving
And destiny comes back to paradise

Come and fly with us
High over the rainbow
Riding on wings of our time
Come and fly with us
Right over the rainbow
Wearing the rings of our kind
The march of the time
The march of the time

Come and fly with us
High over the rainbow
Riding on wings of our time
Come and fly with us
Right over the rainbow
Wearing the rings of our kind
The march of the time
