Take away the darkness from your heart

Don't stop believing, I'm going back for sure
Angels shine the right way to our Wonderland
And don't forget the reason on the quest we are
A sign will show the stairway to the end of mountains high

We're living in world beyond the horizon
All the way to heaven divine
Forever and ever
We are living in a World of Glory

One step into Wonderland
Take away all sorrow and pain
In Wonderland
An island divine
Take away the darkness from your heart

We're heading for Eden. A love that's so secure
A star will lead our journey to the end of mountains high

We are living in world beyond the horizon
All the way to heaven divine
Forever and ever
We are living in a Wonderland

One step into Wonderland
Take away all sorrow and pain
In Wonderland
An island divine
Take away the darkness from your heart
One step into Wonderland
Wonderland

We are living in world beyond the horizon
All the way to heaven divine
Forever and ever
We are living in a World of Glory

One step into Wonderland
Take away all sorrow and pain
In Wonderland
An island divine
Take away the darkness from your heart
