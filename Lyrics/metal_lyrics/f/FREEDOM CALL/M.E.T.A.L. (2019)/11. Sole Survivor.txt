Lonely ways, an unknown land
Lost in the dark and the rain
In a garden full of dreams at night
In sadness a caress will remain

If you're a King of the World and the Universe
Of Earth, Wind and Fire
A god of cosmic thunder storms
A Kingdom in the Sky

You are King, you're the light
The last Sole Suvivor
And forever back for good
You are the one, the knight
The only one survivor
Will you ever win that fight?

If scars of the living, grind inside
They heal by the light of the day
Over wind-tossed hills we ride
To reach the mysterious place

If you're a King of the World and the Universe
Of Earth, Wind and Fire
A God of cosmic thunder storms
A Kingdom in the Sky

You are King, you're the light
The last Sole Survivor
And forever back for good
You are the one, the knight
The only one survivor
Will you ever win that fight?

You are King, you're the light
The last Sole Survivor
And forever back for good
You are the one, the knight
The only one survivor
Will you ever win that fight?
