[EP Version]

When it's night on earth
I'm longing for the days
All the tears in my heart, driving me insane
Running free, breaking from our chains away
And smell the wine of paradise
Agony is the price we have to pay
Suffering in pain
Enthroned the darkness spreads it's claws
Tries to catch you now and evil calls
Tears for all my memories fade away
Coldness falls on usMy dreams are turning grey
Take our hands and break down the walls of hate - hopeles
Come and save us from our deadly fate
Kingdom - save us

And then the kingdom will come
Spread our wings to the sun
To a dreamworld we fly
See a shine in the sky
And then the kingdom will come
Take a ferry to the sun
In the name of the crown
We'll never go down

When the kingdom forces are calling
Then the hell will haunt us nevermore
And the world will remain in silence
The sun will shine forervermore
