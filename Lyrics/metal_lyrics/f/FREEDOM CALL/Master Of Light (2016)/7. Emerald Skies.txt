[Music and words: Bay]

When the days close in
And shadows drown the land
Where the shore of the ocean recedes 
To melancholic spaces

It was the darkness that swallowed the beauty of day
The darkness comes closer
All visions and dreams left away
Hand in hand we can find our (way) back home

Let's fly high over the rainbow
And along to the emerald skies
Let's find the key of salvation
You're receiving an answer to life

See the glance of dawn
A flaming romance
And the shades of the ardent sun
Leave sentimental graces

And the darkness comes closer
It was the sadness that darkened the glory of day
And the darkness comes closer
All visions and dreams will come true
Hand in hand we can find our (way) back home

[2x]
Let's fly high over the rainbow
And along to the emerald skies
Let's find the key of salvation
You're receiving an answer to life

Let's fly to the end of the rainbow
On our quest for eternal life 
Tap at the door to a place called salvation
And you'll find the right way to go
