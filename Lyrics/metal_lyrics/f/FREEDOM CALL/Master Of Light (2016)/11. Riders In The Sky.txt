[Music and words: Rettkowitz]

I can see the worlds decline
All turned to dust
Our home is a fading light

Poisonous haze covers what's left behind
Terminus, end of days

The saving above
Is waiting for us
Between all the stars
A new realm is yours

Riders in the sky across the universe
We've already reached the point of no return
Riders in the sky through space and time
To rise again beyond the horizon line

We chase the black holes
And ride on solar flares
Scanning that darkness day by day

To find a new-born world
In the outer space
To give us life,
To give us faith

We dive into the void
To find another world
We'll safeguard our future
To ascend once again

Riders in the sky across the universe
We've already reached the point of no return
Riders in the sky through space and time
To rise again beyond the horizon line

Surrounded by cosmic and deadly radiation
We hold on in a vacuum, we fight until the wire
Imprisoned by coldness, waiting for our salvation
Discovered star clusters, into the unknown we dive
Darkness... is falling

Riders in the sky across the universe
We've already reached the point of no return
Riders in the sky through space and time
To rise again beyond the horizon line
Beyond the horizon line
Horizon line
