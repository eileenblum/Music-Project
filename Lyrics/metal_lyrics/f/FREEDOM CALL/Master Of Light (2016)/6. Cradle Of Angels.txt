[Music: Bay, words: Bay/Ali]

While revealing the secrets of living
And of memories gone by
Rivers of sadness are draining
Like tears that I cried

Where moments of yesterday
Are touched by a final embrace
A ghost of a smile is whispering gently goodbye

In the cradle of the angels
A place where all dreams come true

Chase away the cold breeze of the demon
The spell of the devil inside
The ghost from the past is whispering softly
Goodbye

In the cradle of the angels
An island where wishes come true

In the cradle of the angels
Upwards to the stars
Swaying to heaven
Cradle of angels
Where the spell of your heart
Is returning forever innocent and free

Encased by the shine of tomorrow
New life is born in my mind
And rays of the sun are melting the frozen hearts away

In the cradle of the angels
An island where wishes come true

In the cradle of the angels
Upwards to the stars
Swaying to heaven
Cradle of angels
Where the spell of your heart
Is returning forever innocent and free

In the cradle of the angels
Upwards to the stars
Swaying to heaven
Cradle of angels
Where the spell of your heart
Is returning forever

In the cradle of the angels
Upwards to the stars
Chasing the rainbows
Cradle of angels
Where the spell of your heart
Is returning forever, innocent and free
