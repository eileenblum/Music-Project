[Music: Bay, words: Bay/Ali]

Welcome to a land out of time and space
Welcome to our world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go
Your heart will lead you home

Welcome to a land out of time and space
Welcome to our world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go
You'll never walk alone

An alliance of stout warriors
Glorious, notorious
Men of honor defend the light
Back to back and sanctified
At midnight we can hear their call
On the stroke we stand up tall
Over the hills you hear from far away
A hymn declares it's judgment day

Heed the sound of revolution
It guides is home to paradise

Welcome to a land out of time and space
Welcome to our world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go
You'll never walk alone
Welcome to all and anyone
Together we're one
From where do you come and where do you go
Your heart will lead you home

For all the ones who crave the promised land
Their souls get out of devil's hand
On wings of angels fly along
Find your place in the world beyond

Heed the sound of revolution
It guides is home to paradise

Come and follow is, we enter the gate
Your  mind is the golden key
Ride with is on wings of fate
On the wind of empathy
Follow is to the garden of eternal life
The harvest of light has come tonight

Oh, never walk alone
Oh, to a world beyond

Welcome to a land out of time and space
Welcome to our world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go
You'll never walk alone
Welcome to all and anyone
Together we're one
From where do you come and where do you go
Your heart will lead you home

Oh, never walk alone
Oh, to a world beyond
Oh, we will lead you home
To a world beyond
