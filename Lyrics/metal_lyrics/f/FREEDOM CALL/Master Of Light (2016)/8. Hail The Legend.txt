[Music and words: Rettkowitz]

We're on the way to a holy land
Our soul is bound by an ancient right of ban
To be redeemed we have to die
We're living only once to glorify

Our force awakens by the rise of the moon
Born of fire we'll live and die by the sword

Armageddon lies ahead
And god the righteous lead is on our way

A legend lives on, a legion of light
Like brothers we walk side by side
Hail the crown, a kingdom will come
We are legion, we are one

The troops endeavor on, the will to survive
Reinforce the alliance, hold on side by side

And soon we'll take our final breath
With burning hearts we'll hold out 'til the end

A legend lives on, a legion of light
Like brothers we walk side by side
Hail the crown, a kingdom will come
We are legion, we are one

Hope is the last thing to die
We'll carry on the flame
And bring back the light...
We bring back the light...

[2x]
A legend lives on, a legion of light
Like brothers we walk side by side
Hail the crown, a kingdom will come
We are legion, we are one
