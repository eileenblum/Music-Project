[Music: Bay, words: Bay/Ali]

Metal is for everyone 
Stronger than the law
A band of steel eternally
A union of the strong
The sound is made from steel
Bound for pride and victory
The law of right and wrong.

Welcome to our metal wonderland
We're all as one unite
Hear Vikings, dragons, wise-man say
â¦raise your hands up high

Return to the valley of kings and dragons 
Hear the warriors calling
Open the gate to our magic dreamland
Follow the sign
Follow the flame of victory

Metal is for everyone 
Stronger than the law
A band of steel eternally
A union of the strong
Metal is for everyone
The sound is made from steel
Bound for pride and victory
The law of right and wrong.
Cause metal is for everyone.

"All for one and one for all"
Words of fame and glory
A heavy metal history
The holy book of power
Dive into in a world of queens and heroes
At the end of the rainbow
Under the spell of the magic starlight
Follow the sign

Metal is for everyone
Stronger than the law
A band of steel eternally
A union of the strong
Metal is for everyone
The sound is made from steel
Bound for pride and victory 
The law of right and wrong

Metal, metal, metal is for everyone
Metal, metal, metal is the law

Metal is for everyone
Stronger than the law
A band of steel eternally
A union of the strong
Metal is for everyone
The sound is made from steel
Bound for pride and victory 
The law of right and wrong
Metal is for everyone
Stronger than the law
A band of steel eternally
A union of the strong
Cause metal is for everyone.
