[Music and words: Bay]

Here and now, I'm mystified 
What is wrong, what is right 
When the blind lead the blind 
On the edge of creation 

In despair from a clash of emotions 
In a world full of anxious fear 
Send us hope 
Bring us salvation 

Can you hear 
The hammer of the Gods in the distance 
Tossed through the universe beyond 
Can you feel 
The strong arm of the law and existence 
They're leading our way 
Let's follow the hammer of the Gods 

When my mind is going insane 
Tell me whose to blame 
It's a beast, it's a priest 
Is it matter of madness? 

Don't dare to rely on illusions 
Believe in a maze of thoughts 
Lead us the way to our redemption 

Can you hear 
The hammer of the Gods in the distance 
Tossed through the universe beyond 
Can you feel 
The strong arm of the law and existence 
They're leading our way 
Let's follow the hammer of the Gods

When a force is rising, through the night 
For a battle, standing tall for the fight 
When hope's ascending, no fear inside 
For salvation, standing tall to heaven on high

Can you hear 
The hammer of the Gods in the distance 
Tossed through the universe beyond 
Can you feel 
The strong arm of the law and existence 
They're leading our way 
Forever and ever
Let's follow the hammer of the Gods
