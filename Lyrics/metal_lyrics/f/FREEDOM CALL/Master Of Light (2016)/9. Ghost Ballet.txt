At the end of a misty night
A rain of flashing lights
Drops from the universe light up the skies

They cast a spell over the land
Can you feel the calm
A sign from the universe, a rising sun

Together we are riding
To a cosmic paradise
A journey through the ages
To an endless time

Let's dance beyond the rainbow
Jump and fly
Beyond the horizon
Into a deep blue sky
Let's dance beyond the rainbow
Jump and fly
Oh, dance with us, the ballet out of sight

A glimpse at passing days
But everlasting ways
Shines from the universe all in a blaze

Empathetic dreams and epic poems
Lines of sweet romance
The unique sound of words, a ballet's dance

Together we are riding
To a cosmic paradise
A journey through the ages
To an endless time

Let's dance beyond the rainbow
Jump and fly
Beyond the horizon
Into a deep blue sky
Let's dance beyond the rainbow
Jump and fly
Oh, dance with us, the ballet out of sight
