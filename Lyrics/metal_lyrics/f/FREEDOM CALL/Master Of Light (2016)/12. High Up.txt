[Music and words: Bay]

High up, high up, 
We're riding on high
Way over yonder to the infinity sky
High up, high up, 
We're living it up
Forever and ever
And we never will stop

We're on the road far away from our home
To the place of our friends we'll go
Hello, hello, for a happy night

We keep the light in you eyes shining on
Electrified love and more
Get it on, get up for a happy night

High up, high up, 
We're riding on high
Way over yonder to the infinity sky
High up, high up, 
We're living it up
Forever and ever
And we never will stop

Never mind you're up for and burning
Make me feel that the wheels keep turning
Hello, hello, for a happy night

We're gonna set the world on fire
Nothing more than a heart's desire
Get it on, get up for a happy night

High up, high up, 
We're riding on high
Way over yonder to the infinity sky
High up, high up, 
We're living it up
Forever and ever
And we never will stop

Live, live your life, live your dream,
Live it free, just live it up
Live it up, just live it up
Get, get it on, get it up
Get it going and never stop
Never stop, we'll never stop

High up, high up, 
We're riding on high
Way over yonder to the infinity sky
High up, high up, 
We're living it up
Forever and ever
And we never will stop

Prologue

Once upon a time

Life was given a sibling -- "Beyond" who carried the treasure of the love to life within.
But Beyond was long forgotten... until it was rediscovered and welcomed as a precious jewel by the warriors of light.
From that moment forth, the warriors used "Beyond" as their sword of light and have continued to spread their inner wisdom of this long-forgotten beauty.
And so proliferated a wide-spread union of the strong.

But the hands of fate interfered...
After the gods of creation decided to turn away and let nature take its course, the hands of fate let darkness arise again.
Everywhere, in every part of the vast universe, they spread loneliness, sorrow and the sad cloak of blackness.
They challenged the fighters of the good -- the brave warriors of light -- an consequently the light itself.

The war began and the forces united to fight against the evil.
The union of the strong fought against the vicious shades in the world beyond.
But soon the unbalance of strength between right and wrong became apparent and the resurrection of the gods of creation was sealed.
They sent their strongest weapon; a power made of steel, the law of right and wrong, the saviour of us all.
High up in the emerald skies a hymn of revolution was answered and the tunes of war were calling for the -- master of light.
