[Music and words: Rettkowitz]

I've come to this place long ago
Observing the change of the world
An endless stream of time lies ahead
I've seen all the empires fall
After sending their troops into war
The battle cries will never die
Until then the world will deny

I've seen the poor dying ...it's tragic
I've seen the world burn ...it's frantic
I fear the evil will return

Kings rise and fall
For nothing at all
Born in the ocean of time
Beneath light and dark
I will ride the storm
Until all mankind will be free

A traitor's knife stabbed in your back
But no one will come to regret
A blind man's crown relays to next of kin
The craving for power by force
Until the last hero is gone
This sacrifice goes on and on
Until then the world will deny

Lack of consideration ...it's tragic
To subdue the world ...it's frantic
Erase all the rules and carry on

Kings rise and fall
For nothing at all
Born in the ocean of time
Beneath light and dark
I will ride the storm
Until all mankind will be free

They call me the lord
Or a demon from below
Downfall justified on my behalf
Mankind suffocated by its own lies

Kings rise and fall
For nothing at all
Born in the ocean of time
Beneath light and dark
I will ride the storm
Until all mankind will be free
