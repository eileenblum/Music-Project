When the moon is rising
With a silver shining light
He's waking up the angels 
of the night

And they turn the key 
to heaven
Open up the gates to life
Teach me right from wrong

Enlight me, take me, 
where lifes last eternally
Far beyond the open sky

Flying high, on wings of eternity
See their shine through 
the eyes of the world
Flying high, away from reality
See their shine through 
the eyes of the world

I'm drowning in illusions
Every day and every night
When I'm dancing with 
the demons of my life

Mankind endangered
On a path of no return
World has gone astray

Time has come for my glory ride
A heavenly kingdom devine
