Life on the line
I'm searching for answers my friend
I can't define
The pain I feel within my mind

I'm raising the sign
Here on the edge of the world
With tears in my eyes
And scars on my soul

When the morning star is rising
My fate is drawing near
Welcome to the other side
Just tell me why I'm here

Far beyond, a light in the distance
There's an island of dreams come true
Far beyond, the voice of salvation
Is calling for you

In the shades of the night
I'm searching the secrets of life
What I will find
Is a garden of lies

I'm crying out forever
For the price I have to pay
I will find myself in darkness
When the sun has passed away

Far beyond, a light in the distance
There's an island of dreams come true
Far beyond, the voice of salvation
Is calling for you
Follow us, away from the madness
Where do we go from here
Come across, away from your sadness
Destiny's near
