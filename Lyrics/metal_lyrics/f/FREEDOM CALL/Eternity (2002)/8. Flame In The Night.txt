I call your name
and I wonder why
I should die to be free

Will I ever get a chance to try
Turning back the wheels of time
Back to the dawn of my days

Send me a sign and reopen the gate
Send me back home and release me from pain

And my star will shine like a flame in the night
My power and glory will rise forever
Like a flame in the night
Remeber the journey never ends

Fall from grace
Time to die
Is this the end of my days

Tell me fathers in the sky
Tell me why you damned my life
Why don't you end up my war

[Prechorus]

[Chorus]

Hope forevermore, crying nevermore
A lonely heart inside
I will set the score, end my inner war
That's burning up my mind
Hope forevermore, sailing distant shores
A lonely heart inside
I will set the score, rising from below
A raging war in mind
