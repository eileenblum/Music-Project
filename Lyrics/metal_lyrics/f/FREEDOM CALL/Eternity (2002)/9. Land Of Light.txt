I'm diving through an empty space
Where shadows flashing around
An angels voice, so close so far
I'm reaching holy ground
A broken heart, beats deep inside
A silent lake of tears

And I cry, you can see the tears
In my eyes, like pouring rain
The hand on my heart
I'm leaving the night

To the land of the light
The garden of life
Remeber the golden times

An ancient time, forgotten land
I've never seen before
Unholy spell, a land of ice
An everlasting war

And I fly to the far horizon
So high to the

Land of the Light
The garden of life
Remeber the golden times

And I cry, you can see the tears 
in my eyes
You can see them burning
The hand on my heart
I'm leaving the night
