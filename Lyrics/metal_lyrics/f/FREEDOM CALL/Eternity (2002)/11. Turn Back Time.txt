This is a song of sadness, rhymes of pain
The sounds of my tragedy out in the rain
I made my way and left you alone
I have denied you to be on my own

But while the years are passing by
The flame is still burning inside
I still remember you and I
Our love, it will never die

If I could turn back time
To ease my desire
I always remember
The sadness I've seen in your eyes

I call for the master,
I'm calling his name
Mysterious laughter,
tortures my brain
Stories of sadness, stories of pain
I'm telling my tales to the wind
and the rain

All the dreams I had in my mind
I was doing whatever I like
I still remember you and I
Our love, it will never die

Turn back time
To ease my desire
I always remember
The tears I've seen in your eyes
If I could turn back time
And relieve my desire
It hurts me forever
That I lost the love of my life
