Here I'm standing 
in the pouring rain
All alone I feel a silent pain
The dust of love it made me blind
no way to see
Can you see my bleeding heart
Can you heal my heart

We shared a life, a world of lies
You are gone, no reason to cry

When I believed, in you and me
In all your words
of love and harmony
When our love began,
I gave you my hand
There's still my bleeding heart

Once beyond reality
By fascination blinded eyes I never saw
Your burning lies, are gone it's over now
My memories are haunting me,
a tragedy, a misery

One day you will learn to see 
The love of life, how it is meant to be

[Chorus]

So I'm flying free forever
And I'll try again
Forever, and ever
Again
