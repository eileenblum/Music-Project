When life begins
We are young and free from sins
Under skies of love
We are thriving on and on
But as the years gone by
On the stage of life
With blinded eyes
We believe in lies

Back to the ages of power
It's time for us to learn
Cause one day it's far too late
Too late for a return
And we'll arise from the cower
From the day on we have learned
It's high time to break the spell
That's chaining up the world

We glorify
All our endless crimes
In a high degree
Will we ever see the signs
We will prevail
We will never fail
But we pay for all
We're the last to fall

Time for return is here
We overcome our fear
Will we ever see our agony?
Will we ever try?

Unleashed the beast is raging on
Dark angel with serpent's tongue
Beware that the ending has begun
