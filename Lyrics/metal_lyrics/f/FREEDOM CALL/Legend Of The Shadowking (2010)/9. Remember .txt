We are done and our hope is gone
We can hear the madman's laughter
Now we run, it cannot be undone
And now the deadly wave grows faster

Don't stop believing
Don't stop to walk
Keep on believing in the signs of fate

Somewhere, somehow
We find the key to the sense of the world
Somewhere, somehow
When we remember the first days of mankind again

We have failed, we sell off the world
No one knows, what's coming after
Now we yearn, and we get what we earn
And now the end will come with bluster

Don't stop believing
Don't stop to walk
Keep on believing in the signs of fate

Somewhere, somehow
We find the key to the sense of the world
Somewhere, somehow
When we remember the first days of mankind again
