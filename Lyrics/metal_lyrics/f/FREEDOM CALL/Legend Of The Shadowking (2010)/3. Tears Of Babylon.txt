A stairway to the gods in heaven â out in the dust
A sign of hope for our redemption â forever lost

1000 dreamers, trust in the prophecies
Born in their fantasies

Babylon, Babylon
1000 nights in my world of dreams
1000 years in my memories

Outlawed by the revelations â calling you a shame
Accused of lust and fornication â you're the one to blame
