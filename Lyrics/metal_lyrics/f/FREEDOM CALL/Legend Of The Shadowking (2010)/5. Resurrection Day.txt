Died in the past, swore to return
His spirit is free
He received what he earned
Survived all the times in the underworld
The tyrant is crowned
The oath fulfills tonight

In the past I lived, as a king I died
I built the tower to the universe
And my time will come, my resurrection day
I come back to free the world again

Back to the earth, back to the earth, I'm coming
I will return, I will return, I'm longing
Kingdom come!

On and on - I will free the world
I'm gonna bring back the light
And one day we'll be unity
Stand strong ! â I'll fight for our rights

Once I ruled the land, at the river banks
I built the temples of the ancient gods
I will never stop, I will never rest
Until I, until I find my peace at last

Back to the earth, back to the earth, I'm coming
I will return, I will return, I'm longing
Kingdom come!

On and on - I will free the world
I'm gonna bring back the light
And one day we'll be unity
Stand strong ! â I'll fight for our rights

Back to the earth, back to the earth
Time for rebirth, time for rebirth
Rescue the world, rescue the world
The flame of the kingdom still burns

The king returns
He's born to rule
He takes revenge
To free his mind
