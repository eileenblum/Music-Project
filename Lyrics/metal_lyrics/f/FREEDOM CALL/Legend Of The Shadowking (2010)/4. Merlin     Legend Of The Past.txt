From the isle of Avalon a virgin came
Oh she sealed his fate forever
He faced the hand of destiny, she was alone
Oh she sealed his fate forever

Run for your life
The empress is here, torture and fear
Run for your life
The beast has appeared, the end is near

Merlin, son of a fallen angel
Merlin, a legend of the past
Foretold the story of two dragons
Fighting for the land
His name will live forever

He was too wise he couldn't see, he felt for lies
Oh, the legend's gone forever
Then he was cursed no turning back, no way out
Oh, the legend's gone forever

Teacher of kings and wizard of (his) time â he's magic
A genius man he was one of a kind
Betrayed and deceived by the love of (his) life - so tragic
She was casting a spell and controlled his mind

Run for your life
The empress is here, torture and fear
Run for your life
The beast has appeared, the end is near

Merlin, son of a fallen angel
Merlin, a legend of the past
Foretold the story of two dragons
Fighting for the land
His name will live forever
