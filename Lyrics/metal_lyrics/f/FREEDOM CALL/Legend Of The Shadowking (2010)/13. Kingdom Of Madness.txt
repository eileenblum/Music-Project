And I'm riding through the mountains
Through the winter nights, break for no one
On my way into the unknown
I take a ride, the one-way train to Eden
Exit paradise

On the quest for my salvation
I'm always on the run, no surrender
And I'm running free forever
My journey ends at the gate of heaven
Exit paradise

A kingdom of madness, a heart full of sadness
My last sacrifice
A kingdom of madness, I'm drowning in sadness
My lost paradise

Now the end is coming closer
I'm diving to be free, I surrender
And I'm running with the devil
I don't care, I'm heading for the next world
Exit paradise

A kingdom of madness, a heart full of sadness
My last sacrifice
A kingdom of madness, I'm drowning in sadness
My lost paradise

A kingdom of madness, a heart full of sadness
A kingdom of madness, a heart full of sadness
