I'm the biggest, I'm the best
I'm better than the rest
I'm bad, I'm worst, I rule
I'm better than the rest

I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I'm tough not faint
I'm smart, I'm rough so cool
I'm better than the rest

A perfect, a perfect day

Welcome to a perfect day, a perfect place to be
All the best that life can give, is not good enough for me
Welcome to a perfect time, a perfect unity
The best is only good enough, good enough for me

I'm sexy, I'm hot
I'm right on the spot
I'm clever, however, I'm cool
I'm better than the rest

I'm a rebel, a rocker
A bloody motherfucker
I'm hard as a rock, so rude
I'm better than the rest

A perfect, a perfect day

Welcome to a perfect day, a perfect place to be
All the best that life can give, is not good enough for me
Welcome to a perfect time, a perfect unity
The best is only good enough, good enough for me

Welcome, welcome to the joy of life
