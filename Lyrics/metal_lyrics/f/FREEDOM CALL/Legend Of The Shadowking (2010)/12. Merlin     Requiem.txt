I'll be there, out of infinity
I'll be there, when your alone in darkness
Whenever you are falling
I'll be there, when you need my wisdom
I'll be there, in your eternal dreams at
Anytime â anywhere

Merlin, son of a fallen angel
Merlin, a legend of the past
Foretold the story of two dragons
Fighting for the land
His name/fame will live forever

I'll be there, in eternal darkness
I'll be there when teardrops falling
When darkest shadows crawling
I am the air, I'm the breeze of freedom
I'll be there, when hope is gone forever
Anytime â Anywhere

Merlin, son of a fallen angel
Merlin, a legend of the past
Foretold the story of two dragons
Fighting for the land
His name/fame will live forever
