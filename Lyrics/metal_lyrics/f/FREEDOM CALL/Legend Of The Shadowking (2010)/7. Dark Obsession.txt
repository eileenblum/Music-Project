My secret dreamworld, it falls apart
A silent sorrow gets hold, is touching my heart
My inspiration, your genius art
Our strange relation has lost all it's charm

Love and passion are dead and gone
You've been my idol, the chosen one
Can I be free when I'm living on?

In the still of the night
Dark obsession inside
It's the way to my last paradise
In the still of the night
My Dark obsession ignites
My oasis, my paradise

Always faithful, beyond all time
A strong desire was burning inside
My love is endless, it never dies
You gave a meaning to my curious life
You have denied me, you turned away

In the still of the night
Dark obsession inside
It's the way to my last paradise
In the still of the night
My Dark obsession ignites
My oasis, my paradise

In the still of the night
Dark obsession inside
In the still of the night
Dark obsession inside
In the still of the night
Dark obsession ignites

The time has come to take me home
Show me the way and lead me home
