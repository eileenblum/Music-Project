Hear - the queen of the universe
Real - can you feel the breeze of life, tonight

Have you ever been, out in the skies
Have you ever seen, the beacon in the night

She's my starlight, she lasts forever
Silver starlight, she holds me in her arms

Here - oasis of harmony
Real - once she only was a dream, the light

Have you ever been, out in the skies
Have you ever seen, the beacon in the night

She's my starlight, she lasts forever
Silver starlight, she holds me in her arms
Hold me in your arms

She - is made for eternity
Clear - clear like the source of life, my life
