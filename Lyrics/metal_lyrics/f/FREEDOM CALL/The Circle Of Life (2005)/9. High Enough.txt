Alone I walk the road to nowhere land
I lost my dreams and hope for better days
I'll be there to see my paradise
One day I'll see it rise

The sky is your kingdom
Oh lord of the air
A shade of hope, who takes away despair

Show me your freedom
And save me from pain
I believe in you, believe in you
Here, I'm crying in the rain

Sometimes, somewhere, somehow
Wings of glory
They will take me

Higher to the open sky
Higher and higher he flies
Gliding with the warm wind stream
High up in the skies I'm free

On warm winds he's rising
He's unbound and free
Bird of prey - to seal my destiny
Guardian of creation
Guardian of mine
I believe in you, believe in you
You, are running out of time

Sometimes, somewhere, somehow
Wings of glory
They will take me

[chorus]
