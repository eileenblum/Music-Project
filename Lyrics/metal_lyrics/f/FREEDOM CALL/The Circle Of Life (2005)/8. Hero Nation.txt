Remember the times
When we were young and wild
The beautiful times
Under blue blue skies

Now the years have gone by
And we realized
Creation's divine
We're the last to die

Holy father; can you hear us
Is it the end of global freedom
All the children, now and ever
Will they ever have a future
What if we try, to open the eyes
For a better world tomorrow

One world, for all the nations, one chance for God's creation
One sky, for all the children, one light for hope and freedom

A lost paradise
Under the darkenend skies
You can see in my eyes
All the tears I cried

Holy father; can you hear us
Is it the end of global freedom
All the children, now and ever
Will they ever have a future
What if we try, to open the eyes
For a better world tomorrow

One world, for all the nations, one chance for God's creation
One sky, for all the children, one light for hope and freedom
Arise from deep damnation, survive discrimination
Alive - a big sensation, we are the hero nation
