On the road to victory
Is it real or fantasy
I hear the call of fame
It's for all the world to see
When I go down in history

A flame for our freedom
Enlightens the sky
The sign of the rings never dies

The eternal flame
Come to the hall of fame
The eternal flame
Strong as the call of fame
The eternal flame

A flame for our freedom
Enlightens the sky
The sign of the rings never dies

[chorus]

Flame of destiny, sign of liberty
Forever, forever - shine
Forever, forever - shine
