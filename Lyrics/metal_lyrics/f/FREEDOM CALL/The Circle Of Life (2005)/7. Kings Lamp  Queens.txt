A gleaming fascination, burning deep inside
When it comes into my mind
The crown's my destination, a doubtful paradise
Oh, the forced my sacrifice

Holiest one, the crown is divine
I am designed to obey and to smile

Kings and queens
Eagles without wings
Dancing in the limelight, the dance of fools begins
Kings and queens
Saints and sins
Fairytales and stories, in rainbow magazines

I"m a shining incarnation of the royal kind
Always in the public eye
Chained in isolation, until the day I die
Oh, I sacrificed my life

Holiest one, the crown is divine
I am designed to obey and to smile

[chorus]

Master; master; royal buster; chaos king and trouble queen
Master; master; married a monster; wrangles with his destiny
Faster; faster into disaster - God shave the Queen (eh kloar!)
