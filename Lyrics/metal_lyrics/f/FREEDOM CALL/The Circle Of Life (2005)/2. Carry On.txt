Carry on, carry on
The chanting has begun
A hymn of fame and glory - forever
And ride on, ride on
In union we are strong
A symphony for freedom and glory

We are strangers in a strange land
We are born as renegades
And show the world what they should see
When we are standing at the crossroads
Revolution is our way
We're breaking down the walls of hate

[chorus]

We are guardians of the future
Defenders of our faith
And we are bound for victory
When our hearts call for rebellion
We're raising our hands up to the sky
And tell the world to turn away from darkness

[chorus]
