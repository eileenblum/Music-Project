Resurrection energy inside
Something that I can't define
Mystery - I leave my fears behind
Something that seems so divine
Over and over again

Intoxication's running through my veins
Confusion - I'm going insane
Fever waves are smashing up my brain
Illusions and madness remain
Over and over again

The rhythm of life - a river of life
On my way to paradise
The rhythm of life - a river of life
The one that keeps us all alive

A fascination penetrates my mind
Hungry - I'm longing for life
Time for me to spread my wings and fly
Hungry - I try to survive
Over and over I try

[chorus]
