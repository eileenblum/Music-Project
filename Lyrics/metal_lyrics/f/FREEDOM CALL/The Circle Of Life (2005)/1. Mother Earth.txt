Destiny's child, aeons away from the sun
Island of life, out of the dust she has come

Be aware of the dream we live in
Realize that the chance is given
My life, my love
In the hand of destiny

Mother Earth - The voice of the universe
Mother Earth - Oasis of life
Mother Earth - The flame of universe
Your tears of pain rain down on the world

Shine in the night, a diamond in blue, she's the one
Symbol of light, the reign of the fool shad begun

Be aware of the world we're sharing
Realize that the times are changing
My love, my life
You can seal my destiny

[chorus]

Highest time that the world is learning
Keep in mind that the big wheel's turning
My love, my life
You're the only one for me

[chorus]
