[Taime Downe / Greg Steele]

Shake it, don't break it, baby
You gotta let you hair hang down
I eat my dinner right out of a garbage can
I got my clothes from the lost and found
You gotta roll with the punches, spin like a top
I don't have much but I've got a lot of personality
And that's all that counts
When my ship rolls in, I'll be ready, oh yeah
And I'll be strutting my stuff through the high class part of town
When my ship rolls in, I'll be ready
Dazed and kinda lazy
I was bailing out my boat with one hand
Moving closer and closer to the green silver coast
I wasn't happy 'til my feet hit the sand
You gotta eat right through the bone, gotta chip away the stone
I got rocks in my head and my pants
You're a land lover baby, and I'm your supply and demand
When my ship rolls in, I'll be ready, oh yeah
And I'll be strutting my stuff through the high class part of town
When my ship rolls in, I'll be ready
Shaking it
Driving real fast in my limousine
I got two girls in the back, it's the American dream
There's so much money but so little time
It seems like yesterday I didn't have a dime (not a dime)
Got me a mansion and a swimming pool, living this luxury is totally cool
It's a long way from the bottom and a short drop from the top
Now that my ship's come in I ain't gonna stop
