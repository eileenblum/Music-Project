[Taime Downe / Brent Muscat]

Sun's coming up in the West
I've got my pearl and my steel
And Bernie takes a look at Stacy
Says "boy, is this for real"
The heat is coming down and I'm not laughing
I pulled my trigger, I'm blasting for action
I jumped into the saddle, I'm not walking
I'm sick of this town and all it's talking
This city has no heart
No no no no no heart
It's got a mouth that keeps a running
And baby it won't stop
No, it won't stop
This city has no heart
It's got a mouth that keeps a running
And baby it won't stop
Face it, this place is a mess
It's got a hole in the ceiling
The rain comes and washes away
All the hope and the feeling
And Jackie's feeling numb, face down on the table
Greg is popping bubble gum, making love to Betty Grable
Walking up and down the streets of blood fashion
I've had it up to here with this so called attraction
This city has no heart
No no no no no heart
It's got a mouth that keeps a running
And baby it won't stop
No, it won't stop
This city has no heart
It's got a mouth that keeps a running
And baby it won't stop
I said hey, this city has no heart
Gypsy junkie baby, you're sitting in the sun
And there's no use trying, but you did it again, oh no
