[Taime Downe / Greg Steele]

Living in L.A. is so much fun
Boy you is ugly and your girlfriend weighs a ton
We were sitting in our car in a traffic jam
And the tourist starts screaming "Ain't you that guy in Wham?"
Wake me up before you go go, baby
No we won't shut up, we're just Babylon and on
Babylon on, Babylon and on
Shut up
Met a hoochie-koochie named Dizzy Cowabunga
I said "Shut your face and take off what you got under"
Went outside, said "your place, not mine
Cause my granny's on the couch and she smells like she might die"
No we won't shut up, we're just Babylon and on
Babylon on, Babylon and on
Shut up
Partying in Bel-Air with Buffy and Biffy
Some homeboy says "Hey guys, you want some sniffy"
On the table was some punch and we put in Spanish fly
Biffy's with dog Spot and Buffy's on my thigh
