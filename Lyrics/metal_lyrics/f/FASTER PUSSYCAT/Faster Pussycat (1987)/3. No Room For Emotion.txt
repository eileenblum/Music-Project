[Taime Downe / Brent Muscat]

I'm not really too sure 'bout this conversation
There's been a lot of talk but nothing said
And don't you understand my French
What do I have to do to make a reservation
Just to talk to you and explain
That all you ever do is complain
I got no, I got no room for emotion, yeah
It's like a cloud dripping radiation right on my head
I got no, I got no room for emotion
Now I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation
You take my heart, flush it down the drain
I'm easy baby, it's such a shame
Now I've had it up to here with all your aggravation
That you put on me, such a crime
Baby, you're just wasting my time
