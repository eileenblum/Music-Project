[Taime Downe]

I'm not seeing it , baby
I gotta hear what you say, say it
Come on, say it, come on
You got me walking right on broken glass
And when I start to bleed
Is when you start to feed
Leaking through to the basement of my soul
I've been on fire before, but I never felt so cold
Standing on the edge (shooting you down)
And I'm looking down (shooting you down)
And I try my hardest just to shoot you down
I'm laughing like a clown (shooting you down)
I'm tracking you down (shooting you down)
And I try my hardest just to shoot you down
Cadillac woman, your makeup
Is starting to roll down your white walls
Come on, stop it, come on
You're killing all the flowers of romance
The ones deep in me
That were never diseased, no
Peaking through the window of my home
Now I'm with so many people, but I've never felt so all alone, no
Standing on the edge (shooting you down)
And I'm looking down (shooting you down)
And I try my hardest just to shoot you down
I'm laughing like a clown (shooting you down)
I'm tracking you down (shooting you down)
And I try my hardest just to shoot you down
You better watch out, baby
There's a whole lot of shooting going on
And if I ever catch you
Gonna crack your backside down, right
