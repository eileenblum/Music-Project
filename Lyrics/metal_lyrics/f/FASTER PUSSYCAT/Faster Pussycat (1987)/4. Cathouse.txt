[Taime Downe]

Let's go down 'cross the tracks
Where a pussy ain't no feline
Rev up my Chevy
I'm gonna pay to play
With a licketty-split, I like that taste
I push ahead and I fall behind
And such a good, good time
We just wanna stay
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
And had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
Now I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right 'bout now
Let's go to the house
Where business is a pleasure
Perversion is an aversion
That don't go away
I'm a hard, hard act to swallow
And she's my buried treasure
It'll be a long, long time
Before I'm on my way
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
And had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
Now I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right 'bout now
I won't get a moving
Gas up my Chevy, headed down the way
Saying just get, get me back, get me back, I say
