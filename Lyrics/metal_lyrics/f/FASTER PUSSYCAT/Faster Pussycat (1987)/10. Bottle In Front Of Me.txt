[Taime Downe / Brent Muscat]

Juicing it up 'til I can't see what's in front of me
Can you help me make it up the stairs
So I can hit the sack and maybe get some sleep
A bottle in front of me is like a frontal lobotomy
One more swig will alter my psychology
My mornings are pure misery, ice pack on my head
It's another Bloody Mary morning
And I'm feeling pretty sore, wish I was dead
A bottle in front of me is like a frontal lobotomy
One more swig will alter my psychology
Drowning all my sorrows in my gin
I wish that I just knew where I had been last night
Last call for alcohol, it's the ending of my night
Bought me a case of Tylenol just to make me feel all right
Yeah, I said "Hey Riki, wanna take me down to the store
To buy another bottle" I said
A bottle in front of me is like a frontal lobotomy
One more swig will alter my mentology
Got a bottle in front of me
Like a frontal lobotomy
