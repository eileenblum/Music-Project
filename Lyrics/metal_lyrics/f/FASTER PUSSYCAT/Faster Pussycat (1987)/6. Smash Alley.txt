[Taime Downe / Brent Muscat]

Hanging out with junior on the street
Catching new diseases once a week
Infecting everyone we meet
Our life is just one big trick or treat
Molested and arrested in Smash Alley
Captain Friendly locked me in his cage
He said boys, you'd better behave
She's only fourteen, in the seventh grade
If her daddy only knew he'd be screaming in his grave
Molested and arrested in Smash Alley
Lipstick junkies and runaways in Smash Alley
Say goodbye to your mama if you're gonna hang out in Smash Alley
You see, Missy just made it out on parole
She's huddled in the gutter and she's shivering with cold
She's so high strung I'm on the tip of her tongue
Kneeling in the alley all covered with scum
Molested and arrested in Smash Alley
Lipstick junkies and runaways in Smash Alley
Say goodbye to your mama if you're gonna hang out in Smash Alley
High heels and switch blades in Smash Alley
Say adios to your mama if you're gonna hang out in Smash Alley
