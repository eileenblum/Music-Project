Shame up till today I was doing fine
In the mailbox was a letter
From a girl I left behind
And now she's back in town to stay
Well long time ago she took my sanity
Came all the way to Memphis
To live next door to me
Besides the pain it's driving me insane
There's no way I can make her understand
And I found out why it's hidden behind her pants
She's got my name, she's got my name
Tattoed on the back side of her frame
There ain't no way you'll get your ring on me
Diggin in my garbage for a piece of me
All she found were some dirty rubbers
And a beat up pair of jeans
Mentally she's not all there
What should I do or where should I go
Should I find a little cabin in Boise Idaho
And hibernate till that strange lame dame goes away

There's no way I can make her understand
And I found out why it's hidden behind her pants
She's got my name, she's got my name
Tattoed on the back side of her frame
There ain't no way you'll get your ring on me
There's no way I can make her understand
And I found out why it's hidden behind her pants
She's got my name, she's got my name
Tattoed on the back side of her frame
There ain't no way you'll get your ring on me
