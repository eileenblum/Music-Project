Don't really know
How much longer I can stick around
Cause my bags are collecting dust
And my ceiling's coming down
Kissed the gutter on Bourbon Street
Louisiana give me New Orleans
It's time to change the locks oh baby
On my back door
I'm east coast bound I'm stuck in
Chinatown for the night
I'm gonna walk, run
Whatever it takes I'm leaving
I'm gonna walk, run
Whatever it takes I'm gone
Trucks loaded up and ready to go
The stage coach is leaving town
My snakeskin boots are tough enough
For that dusty Texas ground
San Antonio get ready for me
The Houston honeys are a luxury
It's time to change the locks oh baby
On my back door
I'm east coast bound I'm stuck in
Chinatown for the night
I'm gonna walk, run
Whatever it takes I'm leaving
I'm gonna walk, run
Whatever it takes I'm gone
It's time to change the locks oh baby
On my back door
I'm east coast bound I'm stuck in
Chinatown for the night
I'm gonna walk, run
Whatever it takes I'm leaving
I'm gonna walk, run
Whatever it takes I'm gone
It's time to change the locks oh baby
On my back door
I'm east coast bound I'm stuck in
Chinatown for the night
I'm gonna walk, run
Whatever it takes I'm leaving
I'm gonna walk, run
Whatever it takes I'm gone
