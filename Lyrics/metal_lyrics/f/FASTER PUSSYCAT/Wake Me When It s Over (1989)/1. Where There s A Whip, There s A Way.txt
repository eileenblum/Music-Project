Nobody knows how to tie the simple knots that I know
Getting weak in the knees and your bruises are beginning to show
The only way she knows how to take it is blow by blow
Strapped to the rack with a slap on the ass should make her eyes glow
I ain't no boy of bondage, you can use it, you can use it
I'm a loose lip talking jockey with a whip &amp; track to prove it
I'm the dehumanizing master
You better start your talking, cause I get what I go after
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
The devil in she likes the sweet beating dreams everyday
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
When it's time to leave the baby I'll let you know
I've got you buckled to the floorboards
Got you screaming like a pooch on a leash to let you go
She grinds her leather like Liberace rhines a stone
She rides just like a pony gonna sign that filly up for the rodeo
I ain't no boy of bondage, you can use it, you can use it
I'm a loose lip talking jockey with a whip &amp; track to prove it
I'm the dehumanizing master
You better start your talking, cause I get what I go after
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
The devil in she likes the sweet beating dreams everyday
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
Nobody knows how to tie the simple knots that I know
Getting weak in the knees and your bruises are beginning to show
The only way she knows how to take it is blow by blow
Strapped to the rack with a slap on the ass should make her eyes glow
I ain't no boy of bondage, you can use it, you can use it
I'm a loose lip talking jockey with a whip &amp; track to prove it
I'm the dehumanizing master
You better start your talking, cause I get what I go after
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
The devil in she likes the sweet beating dreams everyday
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
