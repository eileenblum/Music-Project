My money's gone my tank is empty
This dope-filled life has got the best of me
Wait this can't be right
But it's all written in black &amp; white (black &amp; white)
I've been looking for the clown
That's brought me up and dragged me down
I've hocked my life and all my things
For a beat up pair of broken wings
That won't fly
Ain't no way around it
There ain't no way around it
My crutch is gone my baby left me
Took what I had to Tampa Bay
Forget, No! I'll have my time
Meanwhile I'm spaced out of my mind
I've been looking for the clown
That's brought me up and dragged me down
I've hocked my life and all my things
For a beat up pair of broken wings
That won't fly
Ain't no way around it
There ain't no way around it
My crutch is gone my baby left me
Took what I had to Tampa Bay
Forget, No! I'll have my time
Meanwhile I'm spaced out of my mind
I've been looking for the clown
That's brought me up and dragged me down
I've hocked my life and all my things
For a beat up pair of broken wings
That won't fly
Ain't no way around it
There ain't no way around it
