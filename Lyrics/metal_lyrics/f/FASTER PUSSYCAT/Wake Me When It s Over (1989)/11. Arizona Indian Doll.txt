She's got high top moccasins
And shines in the sun
Does her rain dance for me
And I'm wet when she's done
Got to be the last of a long lost tribe
I got my bow &amp; arrow now I'm ready to fly
Ain't no bright lights shining
Ain't no bad moon rising at all
Ya got me rolling through the tumbleweed
This wild child's all I need
Well I got her
And she's all mine
There ain't nothing like
A little midnight stroll
And make a little love
Where the buffalo roam
I ain't no Geronimo
But I had a good time
I walk her to her tee pee
And I kissed her goodnight
Ain't no bright lights shining
Ain't no bad moon rising at all
Ya got me rolling through the tumbleweed
This wild child's all I need
Well I got her
And she's all mine
Arizona, Indian doll
