I'm your door to door lover
I'm your cyclone pacifier
I'm your cheap trick honey
And my baby's my bionic liar
I don't bleed cause the gasoline
That flows right through my veins
I'm a motor at heart
And if I don't start
I get pissed off just the same
Your high heeled river of love
Is drippin down your thighs
It seems like my lover's
Finally satisfied
Blow my whistle, rock me little dove
Rock my missile, blow me little dove
She's a super sex junkie for money
Sometimes she does it for fame
She prefers cash to a hot seat on the dating game
I'd like to seize ya, I'd like to please ya
By customizing your frame
With the oil of lover, that some keep in a glove
But I just let it spray
Your high heeled river of love
Is drippin down your thighs
It seems like my lover's
Finally satisfied
Blow my whistle, rock me little dove
Rock my missile, blow me little dove
Your high heeled river of love
Is drippin down your thighs
It seems like my lover's
Finally satisfied
Blow my whistle, rock me little dove
Rock my missile, blow me little dove
