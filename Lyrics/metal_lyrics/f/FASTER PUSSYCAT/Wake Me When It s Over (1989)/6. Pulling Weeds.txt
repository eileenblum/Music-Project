Maria's crying and I don't understand
It takes two to tango
Three to make me really mad
But things ain't that bad
Call me super dad
Suzy's had it up to here with their master plan
Of some cronies' testimony that sounds just like the Ku Klux Klan
If things get that bad
There's plenty of room in Japan
Don't need girls or little boys
They'd only have broken toys
They'd only throw them all away
There's pain down below
Pull my, pull my weeds (don't give a funk)
There's pain down below
Pulling weeds (don't give a funk)

An unwanted baby Jonny boy
Daddy was a dirty beggar mamma's a whore
With a life like that
How can he win the war
Don't need girls or little boys
They'd only have broken toys
They'd only throw them all away
There's pain down below
Pull my, pull my weeds (don't give a funk)
There's pain down below
Pull my, pull my weeds (don't give a funk)
