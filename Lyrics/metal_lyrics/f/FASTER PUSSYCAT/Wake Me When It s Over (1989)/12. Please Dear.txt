[Bonus track]
[Taime Downe / Brent Muscat]

Please, all I wanted was a change
Lisa, I never wanted you to go that far away
Then you had to go
And leave me sitting all alone
Oh baby, how I miss you so
And I'm so damn tired of thinking
She wiped the tears away
A lifetime away
And laid a goodbye on me
At night I can still hear you saying
Hang on to me, baby
Hang on to me
It ain't easy
Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
So we can go on forever
Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
Lisa, every time I turn around I see your face
Please give me a sign that says you're o.k.
Will you let me know
That you'll me at the door
And take me everywhere you go
Up in the sky when I buy my ticket
I have a hard time sleeping
You're ringing your bell
Reminds me of all the times of playing
At night I can still hear you saying
Hang on to me, baby
Hang on to me
It ain't easy
Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
So we can go on forever
Please dear
Could you save a seat in nirvana for me
I never wanted to say goodbye
I always wondered why
It's another sleepless night
Are you really, are you all right
You're so far away
Oh, I miss your face
