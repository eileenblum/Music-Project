Bitten by the bed bug she slipped in the slime
Said I remember everything was fine
Had the boys wrapped around her finger back in her prime
She used to play the violin thinking everything divine

How long must you play
With your pins and needles
The wrong prick will take you away
Like it or not
This old maid lives in wonderland
This old maid seems to sink even deeper in her own quicksand

Always digging for gold always in the wrong place
A brown nose and a dirty smile you better wash it off your face
Junk is your religion it's the only thing that makes you pray
You used to look like Marilyn now you look through window pain

How long must you play
With your pins and needles
The wrong prick will take you away
Believe it or not
This old maid lives in wonderland
This old maid seems to sink even deeper in her own quicksand
This old maid lives in wonderland
This old maid dances with the leeches, they're walking hand in hand
