You got the right pronunciation
But you got the meaning all wrong
It's my, my first edition
Revise it if you like
But just remember it's a young man's book of bones
There's more to me than the words I read
It's language new to you
If you open your eyes instead of your legs
I wouldn't have to spell it out for you
She just loves me for my
Big dictionary
She wants my vocabulary
Complete from A to Z
She just loves me for my
Big dictionary
Mary, Mary's quite contrary
Thesaurus girl you ever seen
Can you ride my composition
It's a tongue and cheek religion
That will lift your body up
Maybe it's my superstition
You don't love me for my rhyme
Well you know that's just my luck

She just loves me for my
Big dictionary
She wants my vocabulary
Complete from A to Z

When she puts her hands on my
Big dictionary
I reach sanctuary
Thesaurus girl you ever seen
Hey there sunflower
If I was to let your fingers do the walking
Through my fellow pages
Would you know what they mean
(Oh yes I would, I know I would and between them I'll read)
