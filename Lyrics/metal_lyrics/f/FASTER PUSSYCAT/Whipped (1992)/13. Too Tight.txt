[Japanese bonus track]

It's not safe, can't you understand
Your puppy love noose got my balls in hand
And it ain't easy being me
I don't understand myself
It's not the season for a sweetheart relation
It's out of my hands when the feeling leaves the station
Really I don't need this house of pain
You squeeze me 'til there's no reply
And I'm all out of breath
I drowned in your river
And pulled out your sliver
I'm sleeping with the dogs again
It's just too tight
Your grip on my, on my heart yeah
It's just too tight
It's just a strangulation
It just ain't right
Loosen your noose, this ain't hangman
This ain't right
It squeezes the daylights out of me
It's too tight
Down around the corner at Rosco's kitchen
You're giving me the runs with all your bitching
You're a fool child, a fool to fall for me
Maybe someday I'll get my house in the meadow
Put a bun in the oven, throw away my stiletto
Really I don't know just where or when
You squeeze me 'til there's no reply
And I'm all out of breath
I drowned in your river
And pulled out your sliver
I'm sleeping with the dogs again
It's just too tight
Your grip on my, on my heart yeah
It's just too tight
It's just a strangulation
It just ain't right
Loosen your noose, this ain't hangman
This ain't right
It squeezes the daylights out of me
It's too tight
Maybe I'm dumb, yeah maybe I'm stupid
But I say shoot that stupid ass Cupid
If he knocks, knocks on my door again
