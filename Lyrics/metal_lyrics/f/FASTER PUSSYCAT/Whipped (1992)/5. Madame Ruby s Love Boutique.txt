Loose lips and poker chips
If you're gonna talk speakeasy to me
Trash Can Louie knows the secret word
For a shiney dime he will give it to me
They pay the fuzz, rub the judge
And grease the local D.A.
It's down at the end of lonely street
Where Ruby's little doves give it away
And behind the two way mirrors
Cheap and nasty, nasty girls with threads that disappear
Madam Ruby's love boutique
A sex shop Mon Cheri
What this boy calls fun, others call obscene
Madam Ruby's love boutique
With cheeks as smooth as crepes de chine
At Madam Ruby's love boutique
A snap on diva from across the room
Blows a little kiss to me
You can smell the magic of that bone dragon
Singing her hits over to me
Then up the stairs and down the hall
To love room number five
Put your token in her vibrating box
And watch Sady come, come alive
And behind the two way mirrors
Cheap and nasty, nasty girls with threads that disappear
