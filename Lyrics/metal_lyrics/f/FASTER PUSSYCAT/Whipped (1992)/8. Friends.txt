Who said that money was everything
Well that's a crock, you know what I'm saying
When the well runs dry
Say goodbye to fair weather friends
If I need a hug
And feel like crawling under a rug
If I fell on my face
I know that you'd be there to help me up

Cause it's you, only you that makes me strong
Cause there ain't nobody, no
Gonna make me live my life alone
A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
I hope my friend will always be there while I grow old

Lovers they come and go
Like ships to a dock, a bunch of heartbreakers they are
They blind you with their innocence
And tie your heart in knots
If I need some hope
And I feel like I'm at the end of my rope
You make that funny face
You're always there to cheer me up

Cause it's you, only you that will take me along
Cause there ain't nobody, no
I'd rather have to help me sing a song
A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
Won't steal my money
Won't rob my home or take my honey
I hope my friend will always be there while I grow old

Won't think it's funny
And stand up for me, while others call me a dummy
A friend will always be there when I grow
A friend will always be there when I grow
A friend will always be there when I grow old
