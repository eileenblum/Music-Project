A booty-booty
Well here's a story about a floppy romp
All in all it seemed so fun
You got a rotten bladder and fat can knees
That's why she wears plastic sheets
Her butt, it drags along the street
Now there are no room for me
She had the face of a pony if she went on a diet
Come on fat bitch, do us truly
Nice girl
She tried to sit on me
Nice girl
She's way too fat for me
Nice girl
That someone dents her teeth
Nice girl
She tried to squeeze the shakes out of me
Loose booty
Loose booty
Big old lady had a woobly ol' butt
You thought that was big, you should've seen her gut
Well the bird was a psychic, she waddled
She's so big, she's got her own zip code
That lady can house a family of four
Give me a chimichanga please se
