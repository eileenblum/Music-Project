I left the evergreen combat zone
For a taste of a better life for me
The star dog left the mother bone
For a jewel he'd never find or see
You may have hated me, I don't know
But I loved the way you played your role
You couldn't stop to kick the jive
It left your kin with salty eyes

Hey Mr. Lovedog
You will always be
The one back home that could of had it all
Hey Mr. Lovedog
You never really knew me
God bless your velvet gifted soul
Makes no sense at all
Now you're the holy roller
With the hub cap diamond star halo
This is goodbye to captain Hi-top
Hope your pearl jam
Can keep it strong

They may have hated me, I don't know
But I loved the way you played your role
You couldn't stop to kick the jive
It left your kin with salty eyes

Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where we stop I think nobody knows (nobody knows)
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where we stop I think nobody knows (nobody knows)
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where we stop I think nobody knows (nobody knows)

You may have liked me, I don't know
But I loved the way you played your role
You couldn't stop to kick the jive
It kicked you up to the sky
