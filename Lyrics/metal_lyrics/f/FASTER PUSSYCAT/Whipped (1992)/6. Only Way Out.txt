What could I have done to make you hit so hard
And your cigarette is not the only thing that left a scar
You make me feel like painting the bathroom red
I better leave before I'm brain dead
It's the only way out
It's the way out of here
It's the only way out
It's the way out of here
Well it's the only way, well it's the only way out
Momma says you're not supposed to touch me there
Oh be a good little girl and give daddy your Teddy bear
Now she's on the corner selling lemonade
Papa selling pictures of her in the cage
There are some things that you can never ignore
There's so much sick folk in this world we adore
