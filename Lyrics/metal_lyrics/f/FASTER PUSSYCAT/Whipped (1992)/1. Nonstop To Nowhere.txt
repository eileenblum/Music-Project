I'm on the lame train, I got a first class ticket
On the nonstop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own

It's five o'clock in the morning
And I can't fall asleep again
Times are changing and moving fast
Way too fast for me
Seems like only yesterday
I was skipping school and stealing gasoline
I've been talking, I guess you can call it talking a white lie

One minute I'm on the top of the world
And the next thing you know

Sometimes I just sit and daydream
And I just slip away from here
If only I had a crystal ball
Or could invent a time machine
I'd go into the future and take a good look around
And what life has in store for me
I've been walking, I guess you can call it walking a thin line

One minute I'm on the top of the world
And the next thing you know

I'm on the lame train, I got a first class ticket
On the non-stop to nowhere
Where it takes me I don't know
I guess the tracks you lay are your own

It's like a chain gang
I know the exit but my problems
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Nonstop to nowhere
I don't believe the preachers
They're just sticking out their hands
I don't believe the government
And who in the hell's this Uncle Sam
Mr. conductor will you help me off this train
Well I believe I'm on the wrong one
And it's taking me down the drain
