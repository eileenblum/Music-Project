Livin' in L.A. is so much a fight
Boy you is ugly and your girlfriend weighs a ton
We was sittin' in our car in a traffic jam
And some tourist started screamin', "Hey, ain't you that guy in Wham?"
No We won't shut up We're just babblin' on and on
Babylon Babblin' on and on Shut up PPPUSSYCAT Shut up
Man That hoochie-koochie made me dizzy Cowabunga
I said shut your face and take off what you got under
Went outside Said your place Not mine
Toss her panties on the couch and she smells like she might die
No We won't shut up We're just babblin' on and on
Babylon Babblin' on and on

[Solo]

Caught in a Bel-Air with Buffy and Biffy
Some homeboy says "Hey guys Want some sniffy?"
On the trigger was a punch and we put a Spanish Fly
Biffy's without spot And Buffy's on my thigh
No We won't shut up We're just babblin' on and on
Babylon Babblin' on and on
PPPPUSSYCAT Shut up PPPPUSSYCAT Shut up
PPPPUSSYCAT Shut up Shut up PPPPUSSYCAT Shut up
