Painted a perfect picture
And busted my frame
With all this cheap ass talking
You need an oxygen tank
If you're gonna do it, do it right
Got to catch the flow, got to hit em low
I get high between the thighs
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Someone's always watching me
Turn on the news and hear what I'm gonna do
Before it ever happens to me
With a slip of the tongue
I'm in deep shit
I'm so bad off I can taste it
Bury myself with a slip of the tongue
Lick it to the left and take it up
Then lick to the right
My baby likes my Model-T, I'm parkin it tonight
Gotta watch what I do
Gotta watch what I say
There's alway one fucked up damn bum
That gets in my way
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Someone's always watching me
Turn on the news and hear what I'm gonna do
Before it ever happens to me
With a slip of the tongue
I'm in deep shit
I'm so bad off I can taste it
Bury myself with a slip of the tongue
I got a psychopathic love
That fits like a glove
My baby bucks like a bronco
When I start to shove
Get your, get your, get your feet up to your ears
Slam it home and take me to Rome
And watch me disappear

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Someone's always watching me
Turn on the news and hear what I'm gonna do
Before it ever happens to me
With a slip of the tongue
I'm in deep shit
I'm so bad off I can taste it
Bury myself with a slip of the tongue
