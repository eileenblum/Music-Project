Baby, baby why won't you let me be
You're a major pain in the ass, I do need the hassle can't ya see
Please I need some piece of mind
That I was hoping I could find
But you just kept a buggin
Till I was crawling under the rug and baby
Stressing, jump back baby back away
Get off my back you monkey
Ya got my nerves jumping like a junkie today
Poison ivy ya come creeping up right behind me
You make me itch baby you're so unkind
Poison ivy you're like poison ivy
You make me itch and I'm out of calamine
So this is how you get your kicks
Licking up everything after me
Baby don't pet my dog and certainly don't mess with my birds or my bees
Jesus I got a peeping Tom
And I was hoping she was gone
But she just kept a knocking
Till I was crawling under a rock and baby
Stressing, jump back baby back away
Get off my back you monkey
Ya got my nerves jumping like a junkie today
Poison ivy ya come creeping up right behind me
You make me itch baby you're so unkind
Poison ivy you're like poison ivy
You make me itch and I'm out of calamine
Poison ivy ya come creeping up right behind me
You make me itch baby you're so unkind
Poison ivy you're like poison ivy
You make me itch and I'm out of calamine
