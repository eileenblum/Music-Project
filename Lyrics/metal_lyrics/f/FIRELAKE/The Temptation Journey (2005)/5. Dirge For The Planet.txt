Miraculous crystal
Given by stars
I can foresee the future
In fabulous glass
Lie spilt on the caves
Mock scribbled on us
Earth's doom day is close

[Refrain:]
Dancing on the ashes of the world
I behold the stars
Heavy gale is blowing to my face
Rising up the dust
Barren lands are desperate to blossom
Dark stars strive to shine
I still remember the blue ocean
In this dying world

The seas overdumped
The rivers are dead
All planet's cities turned a deserted land
Annihilation declares its day
Life slowly
Utters me 'remain'
