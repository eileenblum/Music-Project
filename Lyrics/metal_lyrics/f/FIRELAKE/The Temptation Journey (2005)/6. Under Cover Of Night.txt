Under cover of night we go
Blind children of fate
To be last to fight
Makes us horribly late
Divine sunshine of the moon
Embraces with remembrance
Making no trace of despair
We shall petrify descendants

No trace of despair

Don't you ever feel like I do
Don't you ever kill like I
Don't you ever feel like I
Don't you ever love like I

Kill and mutilate
These are words that I hate
Kill and rip
These are words that I...
I hate
