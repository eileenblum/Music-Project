Shelter,
Ancient Gods, give us shelter
From the dark paths we crawl on
Paradigm of peace in temple
Encrypted in the sky of scorn

[Refrain:]
Hear the wind howling through
These gorgeous divine gates
Look into your soul
Ruined with hate

Carrying a torch of hope
We descend further into dungeons
Hungry pair of eyes looks as we grope
Lurking behind carved columns

Hear that rustle, hear that growl?
- Surrender, you humans, no chance for you both
Who are you, a demon or local ghoul?
- Consider me master of your soul!!!

Run my friend, run for your life,
Or give up your soul to rejoice the beast

Chased by flamed tounges of fury
Spite-covered claws
We dash out of the haunted temple
Towards the changing laws
Of Destiny
