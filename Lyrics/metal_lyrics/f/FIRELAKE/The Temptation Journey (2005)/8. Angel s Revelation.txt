Falling from the deep blue sky onto sinful earth
Dying angel uttered his final words
Snow-white feathers stained with red holy blood
Feeble wings folded, head tilled downwards

Down there on the shores of Firelake
Minions of demons are joined by hordes of undead
Versus them armies of white angels advance
Winged horses pull chariots of crusaders
And the fight begins...

Though my heart is bleeding
Stubbed by evil force
How good it is to die
Fighting for the truth
