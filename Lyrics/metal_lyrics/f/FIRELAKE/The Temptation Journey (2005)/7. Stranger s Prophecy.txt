Dolorous stranger came to me
Telling that all the world is fake
Clad in shabby clothes
He spoke with his smooth and low voice
Of distant planets and distant souls
Of near Judgement Day
And close end
He told me of eternal life
Which's on razor's edge with death
He told me of eternal fight between two colours
Black and white

That's true I know he was right
But it takes time to find the answer
And no one is forced to make his own choice
Of either side the good one or the darkness

I testify my willingness to live
And serve the truth as long as I am given
I take my time and I'm here to be
The human being for the world I live in
