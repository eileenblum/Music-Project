Poor child
cool steel on bone
fold or follow
abdicate through dire force

[chorus]
poor child
where have all your friends gone?
little child
how does it feel to be alone?

done deal, proves unsure..
loss of guidance
brings smiles of comfort forward
escape harsh words by breaking their teeth
14 years of broken ribs and broken dreams
but is he satisfied?
his burden was chosen as the vessel broke in their eyes

[chorus]

cannot take this anymore
were broken
(why i feel alone)
with closed eyes
(why i feel alone)
and were born
(why i feel alone)
to die, why

[chorusx2]
