As we enter a new millenium the thing is said to come
which is known as armageddon
the global filtration
a mass annihilation
an ingnorance extinction
those chosen to survive already know the answers to obtain bliss
now is our turn to see through the corners of jesus's eyes
spectrum seen fourteen grey
breathe in the night and breath out the day
a fall breaking the scars
bleed down the voice of the sun god ra
we were never blind, our eyes were closed

[chorus A]
a blow to the earths core
descend from life
ascend to light
time breeds down

[chorus B]
wretched fall...wretched fall...
earth
wretched fall...wretched fall...
sky
wretched fall...wretched fall...
self

a growing burn
inbreed the lost
i'm standing ripe
i'm what silence speaks
i'm the son of light
heaven and earth shall join
but not through the second coming of christ
through science, biology
mathematics and astrology
these answers will be attained
eternal life will be released from its vile
where it lies somewhere in the middle east
next to a vial obtaining infinite death
those grey will see
spectrum seen fourteen grey
breathe in the night and breath out the day
a fall breaking the scars
bleed down the voice of the sun god ra

[chorus B]

breaking points no longer exist
lines of intrigue erase
a will set to dominate my mind
exist without the eye of peace
the giza plateaus shed me light
i can see...
i've realized whats my fate
a soul defines me
it is set to dominate

[chorus A]

[chorus B]
