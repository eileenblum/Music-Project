lay down, lay down, lay down, lay down
and burn.........
try it now, try it now, try it now, try it now
it wont hurt.....
lie down breathe in the fire
watch your lungs start to burn
let me know if it hurts
graphic thought, our tears are soaking together
shall i lead her into the beautiful?
try it now, try it now, try it now, try it now
it wont hurt.....
lie down breath in the fire
watch your lungs start to burn
let me know if it hurts
graphic thought, our tears are soaking together
shall i lead her into the future?
another cure, our lifeblood combined with caltrate
shall i see her into the beautiful?
here we're sold on bloodshot eyes, a pigment prize
from the earth
ill stay here and stand strong, its been too long
graphic thought, our tears are soaking together
shall i see her into the beautiful?
another cure, our lifeblood combined with caltrate
shall i lead her into the beautiful?...
