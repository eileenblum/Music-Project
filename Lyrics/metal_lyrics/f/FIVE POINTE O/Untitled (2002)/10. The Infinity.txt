learn to give up fear
(then youll) learn to be a friend
several secrets of life
wont be learned til you die..
birth, work, breath
smile, awaken, observe
elope, breed
look into my eyes and belive in me
nurture, divorce
suffer, cry
acknowledge existance
discover, die
look into my eyes and believe in me
cleanse yourself of guilt
unlearn jealousy
universal vehicle
voice of infinite freedom
look into my life and bleed for me
birth work breathe
nurture cry
acknowledge existance
discover, die
look into my life and bleed for me
soon our host will grow ill from age
and the homes of today will be tomorrows tomb
bleed for me
