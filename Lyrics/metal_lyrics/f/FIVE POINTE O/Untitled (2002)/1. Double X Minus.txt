Day by day my brain keeps telling me to 'let go'
move on, but my heart it seems my heart it seem to disagree
(wait for the end of tomorrow)
were slow in thought
and ill slowly learn
to tell her bye
i'll slowly learn who i am
(wait for the end of tomorrow)
when im gone will i be unknown
(no need to beg or borrow)
somethings wrong
why this lack of rationale?
once steady heartbeat is speeding up for me
shattered betwen two forms
mind and body
the skin and the spirit
must re-attach, got to get me back
together..
(wait for the end of tomorrow)
were slow in thought
and ill slowly learn
to tell her bye
lay down and realize that your weakening mental
is for real
(wait for the end of tomorrow)
lay down a realize that your bleeding wrists
are for real
(no need to beg or borrow)
for real......
cock back the hammer and boom!
(no sorrow tomorrow last day of our lives)
(no sorrow tomorrow last day of our lives)
just one chance
were slow in thought
and ill slowly learn
to tell her bye
bye bye bye
