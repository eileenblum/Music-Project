Gears and fuels will let time progress with me
without meaning life kept on passing me by
up to speed life seems to move smoothly
gears and fuels will let time progress with me
without meaning life kept on passing me by
placenta state of sequential form
welcome blueprint days and lives with open arms
I.D. blank without a purpose in sight
just a job
identity holes
full of frustration
why try
to get by
whats your meaning in life?
whys there reason for time?
ive seen skins floor plans
this opened my eyes
shops been closed
conclusive through pay offs
wall streets sold

[chorus]
we're whole again
pull for me
be opened

crawl for what counts
look at this place
its a global monopoly crawl for what counts
estranging me
because i see where i want to be
crawl for what counts
look at this place its a global monopoly
crawl for what counts
why dont you open your mind

[chorus]

reach out for what you believe in
to reach out
reach for the skies
