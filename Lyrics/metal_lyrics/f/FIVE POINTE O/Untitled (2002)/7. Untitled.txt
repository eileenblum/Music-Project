I've seen apart of me
i've seen this side through third eye contact sight
i've seen apart of me
i've seen this side through third eye contact sight
a self esteem has seen starvation self esteem in need of a dream for nourishment
a soul thats content
when i look up in the sky
and i see it open, break down and cry
feel this feeling deep inside, feel this feeling deep inside
feel the feeling deep inside from the memories youve left behind
feel the feeling deep inside
feel the feeling!

[chorus]
if all goes as planned
i will save you the trouble of going out of your way
theyve come to take me away to a far off place
see you again some day

points been proven words unspoken
i've made it a point to prove
risk your facts then your fiction is reality, reality
i've made it a point to prove
risk your facts then your fiction is reality
start your numbers back to zero
in plain view, there is no truth, just what you can see
your broken reality
feel the feeling deep inside from the memories youve left behind
feel the feeling one more time, feel the feeling one more time
feel the feeling one more time from the memories thats left behind of you
im through with you!

[chorus]

think without thought
and let time devour itself
in the meantime just close your eyes
exhale false form and grow
as this brainchild just slowly dies
seven seals
serving great purpose to pulse
piece in the puzzle to
open
within
a world thats always beneath

[chorus]

show us silence found
let us say it out loud
think without thought and hear this sound
every little thing you are
controlled chaos
they know what you are they know why youre breathing
let them out!
