I feel these wings are spreading
cant wait 'til the day that we can fly away
angel look in the sky
its still trying to reach us
i've made nothing to something
gripped gold 'til gravels redemption
reach up
but will this
bring me bright skies
a soul set to be shattered grows
ignorance of the brain can overshadow
let go of thought and feel where your brain cant go..
how does it feel
does it seem real to be on the wrong side
how does it feel
does it seem real
to be on the wrong side
a mind trained to be hollow knows
(vibrations start to show)
now thoughts have cleared and feelings takes control
(the knowledge of the soul)
let go of skin and realize theres so much more
how does it feel
does it seem real to be on the wrong side
how does it feel
does it seem real
to be on the wrong side
how does it feel
does it seem real to be on the wrong side
how does it feel
does it seem real
to be on the wrong side
bring me bright skies
now ive seen what stings
now it is my time to shine
shine on with me
bring truth to family
heres one thing
cant tear it away from me
its everything to me
its all i can be
this family i'll bleed
this family i need
without these new i could not breathe
how does it feel
does it seem real to be on the wrong side
how does it feel
does it seem real
to be on the wrong side
how does it feel
does it seem real to be on the wrong side
how does it feel
does it seem real
to be on the wrong side
