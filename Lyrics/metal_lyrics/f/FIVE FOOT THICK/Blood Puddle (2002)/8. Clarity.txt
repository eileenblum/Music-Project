What would you say
If I said that you're weak, if I told you to leave.
I'll be okay
Better off on my own you can leave me alone.
It's all the same
Changed in front of my eyes now I'm saying goodbye.
Nothing to gain
Had all I can take so now I'm walking away.

I should've walked away.

It took so long
To let you fucking know that you're the next to go
Just what went wrong
So when is too much just not enough
No holding on
I believed the lies and didn't cut the ties
Now that I'm gone
Fuckin begged me to stay I couldn't walk away

I should've walked away.

Your reality self invention
Early on still I should have known
Thought that I might be the exception
Fooled my self to believe but I'm just wrong

Same old mistake
You think I'd fuckin learn you play with fire you burn
Make my escape
So sick of this still the same old shit
Why must I be
Drawn in again I said this was the end
Please set me free
Knowing when I stayed I shoulda walked away

I should've walked away.

Your reality self invention
Early on still I should have known
Thought that I might be the exception
Fooled my self to believe but I'm just wrong

I should've walked away.
