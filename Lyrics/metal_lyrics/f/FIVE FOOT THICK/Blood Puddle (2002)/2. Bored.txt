Stuck doin time in this dead end life
I got a 50/50 chance just to make it
out alive and if I do they say I won't
amount to anything, too much time on my
hands and they've taken everything

Idol mind mind generate and plot destructive
plans boiling point overload all a boy can
stand misunderstood and never got the
benefit of the doubt fuck it all thats it
I'm sick of it

I'm not the epit-emy of all thats wrong
with the world you see look in the mirror
and you might be just be shocked to see
the face starin back it might look a bit
look a bit like me

I think it's safe to say
bored as
they've taken it all away
bored as
can't fuckin' take no more
bored as
I'm about to lose control

Stop and understand it's time to break
the stereotype quit lookin for cheap
answers and beleivin' all the hype
I didn't ask to be here no I was stuck
with it but I'm not about to leave so
fuckin deal with it

I'm not the epit-emy of all thats wrong
with the world you see look in the mirror
and you might be just be shocked to see
the face starin back it might look a bit
look a bit like me

I think it's safe to say
bored as
they've taken it all away
bored as
can't fuckin' take no more
bored as
I'm about to lose control

Bored as hell [x4]

Tell me what did you expect how'd you
think we'd react we had to put up a fight
we feel it's our god damn right you had
to know we'd rebel be there when the
system fell burn it to the fuckin ground
raise your fist up and don't back down

Bored as hell [x4]

I think it's safe to say
bored as hell
they've taken it all away
bored as hell
can't fuckin' take no more
bored as hell
I'm about to lose control

Bored as hell [x4]
Can't you fuckin understand we're just
bored as hell!
