Put on, another plot that went wrong
Took the easy way out and said so long
Turned out fucked now what to do
outta guns can't run thinking I'm through
gotta get free because they're trying
to get me, Words overheard now I'm
stuck in the backseat clever motehrfucker
got my 7th 3rd strike killin my time
doin 20 to life

Live fast die young
the only way ta play
wouldn't have it
couldn't have it any other way

never make it out of this alive
never say never say never to my self
So what who cares, never meant to survive
Paybacks a bitch now you're gonna feel
the wrath

Kicked down the door everybody on the
floor one step ahead as we snuck out the
back door, cloaked in the night now we on
the attack keep a low profile trying to
stay alive while the oppisition all rolled
out quick loadin up their weapons reaching
for the next clip time is on our side until
we see the light of day make no mistakes and
we all get away

Live fast die young
the only way ta play
wouldn't have it
couldn't have it any other way

never make it out of this alive
never say never say never to my self
So what who cares, never meant to survive
Paybacks a bitch now you're gonna feel
the wrath

when the clock struck 12 yeah we all ducked out [x4]

Situation got just a little out of hand took
as much heat as we thought we could stand
Stepped out the back just in the knick of time
had to act quick with our lives on the line
bullets all around 1/2 my crew hit the ground
runnin like hell before I get shot down, firestarter
motherfucker die young live fast get away quick
with a bag full of cash

Found ourselves on the wrong side of the law
pushed in a corner with my face againt the wall
either side you're on it all ends the same
so if I'm going down then I'm going down in flames

when the clock struck 12 yeah we all ducked out [x2]

never make it out of this alive
never say never say never to my self
So what who cares, never meant to survive
Paybacks a bitch now you're gonna feel
the wrath
