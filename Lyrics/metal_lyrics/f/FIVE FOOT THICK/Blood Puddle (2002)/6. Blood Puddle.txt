See me I'm still here
Laughin' at you through the fence
Think I'd just go away
Well now not a fucking Chance
I exist to annoy you
make your life a living hell
Thought you could rid me
Try but you will only fail

You should have killed me when you had
the motherfuckin chance, it doesn't matter
doesn't really make a difference I'm
out for blood you'd better find a fuckin
place to hide cause when I'm done you're
gonna be the one who's gonna die

This is unreal
how'd you take me for a fool
soon this over
Time to make my final move
You've gotta admit it
Knowin all you have to lose
I'm playing the game now
and changin every fucking rule

So what the fuck man couldn't do it
your way thats alright cause I'd
rather do it my way when it's all
said and done you're gonna know
that I have won cause you know I
did it my way

You should have killed me when you had
the motherfuckin chance, it doesn't matter
doesn't really make a difference I'm
out for blood you'd better find a fuckin
place to hide cause when I'm done you're
gonna be the one who's gonna die

Vowing for vegence
living is the best revenge
you've got a new problem
tell me where's your fucking friends
pulling no punches
this is coming to a head
do this my own way
bring it to a bitter end

You should have killed me when you had
the motherfuckin chance, it doesn't matter
doesn't really make a difference I'm
out for blood you'd better find a fuckin
place to hide cause when I'm done you're
gonna be the one who's gonna die

You see comin man you better walk the other way
I didn't start it but I'll probably get the
fuckin blame you can't hide me you won't bind me
you'll never beat me you'll never fight me

My frustration it seems they've got the best
of me Will I live to see another fuckin day [x4]
NO!
