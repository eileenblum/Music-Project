Coward, now what you see is what you
get, a fucking liar, you fucking liar
you wanted sympathy I'll give you apathy
couldn't be upfront you made a fool of me

Played me for a friend straight faced til the
end gave my trust respect and in return you
shoved a knife in my back

Anger, is all thats left inside of me your
reflection, pure deception, truth and
conseguence you don't get push come to shove
you're full of shit

Played me for a friend straight faced til the
end gave my trust respect and in return you
shoved a knife in my back

Betrayed - thats what I get for trusting you
Sucked in - not the first to but the lies
Remorse - emotions you have never felt
Traitor - you only reap what you soe

Grow up, I think it's time you act your age
not adolecent be independent you wanna hang
a lie around my neck and leave eyes wide
open who the fuck did you deceive

Played me for a friend straight faced til the
end gave my trust respect and in return you
shoved a knife in my back
