No I don't fear it [x4]
I don't fear it I just don't wanna hear it
Constanly pissed but you can't break my spirit
And you're a fake motherfucker you know nothing about me
Down deep, so cheap, don't want you around me

You live your life just like there's no end in sight
You won't pass the chance to take on a fight
You wanna tear me down and belittle me
A hollow attempt to build your own self-esteem

Screams!

Unfounded fucking hostility
I'm so pissed off that you better look away from me
You got it all wrong, but this won't take long
Victimized you're a lie open up your fucking eyes

You live your life just like there's no end in sight
You won't pass the chance to take on a fight
You wanna tear me down and belittle me
A holow atempt to build your own self-esteem

So back the fuck offa me [x4]

If it's a fight that you want then get the fuck on it
Quit looking at me like I'm you next target
You got a problem you got a beef, but you're coming up short
Man you're coming up weak
You talk so much without saying nothing
You sound like one more idle threat
Your thoughts your taunts your words don't touch me
Trash talk take a walk better yet just kill yourself

Why don't you kill yourself [x4] ?

Can't ignore your self destruction
Hands tied eyes blind stoic reluctant
The part of you that was right just got wrong
Fuck the rest pound your chest smile while you kill yourself
