So you hate me don't imitate me
Who you talking about
FUCKED UP WAY OF LIFE
I got your ego so what's your deal
You keep comin around
IT'S BULLSHIT
You got your own thing go get your brass ring
Just shut your fucking mouth
I DON'T ENVY YOU MAN
You'd better lay low, find a safe hole
It's time to get the fuck out
DISCUST

If what I feel is so fucking unreal
Then I could never explain to some people
Take a look through someone else's eyes
Would you see, would you think, would you choose to be
Blind, deaf, and mute unaware of this life
Self imposed ignorance sounds real nice
You got a problem that I wish you'd admit
Cause you're turning into one insufferable prick

What did you fuckin' think
I'd just give in
Sinking underneath
Your intentions
Spit your anger, take your vengeance
Pull apart bullshit resentment

You're getting stale nice betrayal
Now who's the fuckin man
FUCKED UP WAY OF LIFE
Staring forward make your move jerk
You just turned and ran
IT'S BULLSHIT
Go raise your voice up keep makin noise son
I've got a brand new plan
I DON'T ENVY YOU MAN
Losing your grip running your lips
You lost your fucking chance
DISCUST

Quite simply some people don't
Deserve to live and breathe they take up space
You're just one such a fucking case
I wouldn't take your place for the world
Chaotically spun out of control
Back from where you've come the hole you dug
Forced to play the fool once again
I don't envy you

What did you fuckin' think
I'd just give in
Sinking underneath
Your intentions
Spit your anger, take your vengeance
Pull apart bullshit resentment

What the fuck ya think about that
Would you like a better look at my bat [x3]

So you hate me don't imitate me
Who you talking about
FUCKED UP WAY OF LIFE
I got your ego so what's your deal
You keep comin around
IT'S BULLSHIT
You got your own thing go get your brass ring
Just shut your fucking mouth
I DON'T ENVY YOU MAN
You'd better lay low, find a safe hole
It's time to get the fuck out
DISCUST

Coward, sucker, motherfucker, see it, need it
Getting close enough to feel it
Own it, hold it can't control it, petty get me
I don't envy you
