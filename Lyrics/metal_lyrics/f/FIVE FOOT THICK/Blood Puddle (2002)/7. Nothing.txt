Dead inside eyes as cold as ice
this pain with in I can't deny
this time emotion pourin over
anger hate joy and bliss and at
times it don't compare to this
and I don't know which way to turn
I lost my way will I never learn?

They say it's best to have loved and
to have lost than never to have truly loved
at all, to try to fail to reach to
touch the sun and fall, to win the
fight but lose the war, overwelmed
I gasp for breath I'm drowning in my
own restraints my frustrations clouds
my mind, I'll walk away leave it behind

My mind is made and there's nothing
you can say [x4]

What you see, what you see it's not
really me a mere shell of what I once
was, an empty shell of what I once was [x2]

They say it's best to have loved and
lost than never to have truly loved
at all, to try to fail or reach to
touch the sun and fall, to win the
fight but lose the war, overwelmed
gasp for breath I'm drowning in my
own restraints my frustrations clouds
my mind, I'll walk away leave it behind

My mind is made and there's nothing
you can say [x4]

They say it's best to loved and lost
regardless of the final cost
I've given all I have to give and in
the end tell me is it all worth it?

I can't take it will I make it through
this before it fuckin kills me, this is
hopeless I have to stop this before I
reach the point of no return, I can't
feel it I feel numb now embrace the
pain and find the strength to pull
through it before I lose it
I have nothing I am nothing

My mind is made and there's nothing
you can say [x4]

Look what I've done, Just look what I've done [x3]
