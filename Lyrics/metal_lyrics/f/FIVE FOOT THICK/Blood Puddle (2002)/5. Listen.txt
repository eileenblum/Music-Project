What the fuck do they know? [x8]

I know it's like this but that Don't it has to be
You think I'll sit and take this verbal blasfeme?
well my friend you've pegged me dead wrong
Hide your face in print but I can't bite my tongue

You'd like to think you got me all figured out
Think you know me beyond the shadow of a doubt
Call me out though I said I'm not your enemy
I'll tell you again you haven't heard the last of me
You hear these words but you miss where I'm coming from
Whats said is said and we all know whats done is done
Sit back and judge what I feel, think, do and say
Thats quite a trick when you don't even know me

You don't know me so don't judge me
I never asked you for your opinion
Still you question my incentive
And got the balls to say I've got nothing to say
Why don't you shut up and listen [x4]
bastard

Shut the fuck up and listen to this
and say this one more time and when I'm done
you can qoute this fucking line "I don't give a fuck
about you or what you have to say" and thats truth
But I know when it's over you'll be sittin' satisfied
I got pissed so you got your fucking rise
We're getting close to your 14:59 how's it feel?
don't explain you're out of time

I'm sure you'll get a shot to sound off, make all the
noise you want it's just talk It doesn't matter now
Hell I forgot your name you'll come and go and
come and went so whats to say

You don't know me so don't judge me
I never asked you for your opinion
Still you question my incentive
I've got the balls to say I've got nothing to say
Why don't you shut up and listen [x4]
bastard

Well now it's sad it had to come to this
just who the hell do you think you are,
defacing me to make a name for you
had better watch your fucking back my friend

I have heard enough from clones like you
with your bitter take on the world I would
say it's you who has nothing worth a shit to say
Just set the record straight
