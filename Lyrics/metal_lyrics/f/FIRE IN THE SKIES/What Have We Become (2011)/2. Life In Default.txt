Sit and listen as you try to catch me out of line. Always ask the questions that are hidden in plain sight. I can't help that your under minded way of life is not mine. We will take the road less traveled if it means the right way. Your take on salvation is nothing like it seems. The power of words. Caught in the middle of a war within myself. What we pretend is often what we become. I'm sorry that your way of life is not mine.
