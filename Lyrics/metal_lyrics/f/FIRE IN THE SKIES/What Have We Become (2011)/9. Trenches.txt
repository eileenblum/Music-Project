We're going nowhere. Surprise as it all comes to life. Consciousness is merely a point of view. Get up out of the trenches. You're burning out. All eyes are now upon you as you fade from memory. How do you sleep at night now that you're alone? You can tell me you love me, but how can you mean it? If you truly love me then let me go. Tomorrow is just a breath away, and as long as were being honest, I'm holding up these shaking walls but I know I'm not alone.
