Kill me quickly. So sick of all the pressure. It's night and day living life beyond shadows. Everything is so silent when speaking loses its meaning. Even silence can speak in volumes.The lack of sound can move you. It can't right a wrong. In the end, it's never what you worry about that kills you. Meaning of nothing. Meaning of something. The one that pulls the trigger. There is something in the air tonight. Has it been a minute? Has it been a month?

Beyond shadows, we're at a standstill.
