I've seen the signs, coming back like the words you say. You know forgiveness is the one thing I can never do. This is the last time I let the blame fall on me. To return back to the beginning. Something's wrong. There's nothing left to remind me. I've fallen down. A change of tide will pick me up. I know the ebb and flow of life seems far too much to ponder. It's no surprise, that the lack of change has left us where we stand. This time, this is the real thing. No chance, it's going nowhere. This time you'll be left alone. My heart is broken but still beating. My lungs are crushed but I'm still breathing. I'll find the strength, it's deep inside of me. You will never break me. Rewind, I'm reliving the same moment. It's no surprise that the lack of change has left us where we stand.
