It's been disconnected for far too long.
Is this life a shallow grave?
It's not what you're saying, it's just what you're trying to say.
Let's let these ravens bring us home.
This is the weight of the world that we dream alive.
Put words to pages where the truth aligns.
Leading us to our departure.
Bring us home, wake me up.
Standing on the edge, arms to the sky.
Who says we aren't already free?
It's not what you're saying, it's just what you're trying to say.
Let's let these vultures pick our bones.
Is this life worth living?
It just seems so contradicting.
There is nothing constant except change.
I am awake.
Let's let these vultures pick our bones.
This is the weight of the world that we create.
Let's pick our stitches and we'll bleed again.
This is the weight of the world that we dream alive.
Put words to pages where the truth aligns.
Leading us to our departure.
