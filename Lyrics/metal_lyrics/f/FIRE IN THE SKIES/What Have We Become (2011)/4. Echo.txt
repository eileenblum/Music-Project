We'll go wherever it takes us. No drive's too long. We love what we do, and we do it for you. Wake up in a bus with all my friends. You wouldn't believe the times we've had. It's not set in stone, but it's who we are. Oh damn. If it doesn't work out, sure it was a good run. Sooner or later we'll all come home to you. Looking to the skies signaling the way to go to bring us home. Bring us home. We can make this road take us where we need to go. To bring us home to you.
