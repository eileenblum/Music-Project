Oh God this can't be happening. Is this the end? This is the end! A conscious perception, a right of passage. Believe in me, because I always believed in you. We know those who sleep in the dust of the earth will rise again, will die again. Chasing the stars, we've lost our way. As the end begins, the dead will walk the earth. Death is a blessing that everyone will bear. The wicked will burn, we all burn. It's like a nightmare, this is the rapture.There is no light at the end of this nightmare.There is no escape from this living hell.You can't wake up if you are not asleep. You can't wake up, you can't wake up.
