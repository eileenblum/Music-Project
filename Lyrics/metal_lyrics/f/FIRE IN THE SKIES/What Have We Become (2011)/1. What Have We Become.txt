Take it back. Would anything be so different? Wrapped in your blanket of ignorance. Tried and tested, our patience is wearing thin. How can you be so sure that we are the ones that are the sinners? What have we become? I'll stand here waiting for you to bury me. So lost, so tired were done pretending for you. Who points the finger? Who draws the line? Where does it all begin? Why can't there be two right answers? There has to be more to it than that. You can't lead me to believe that I'm alone. I stand strong with those behind me.
