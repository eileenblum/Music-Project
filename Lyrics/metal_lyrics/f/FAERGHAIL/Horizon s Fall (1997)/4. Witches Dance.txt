A black cloath of forbidden wisdom
To ride the night in fullmoonâs celebration
The wind has stopped itâs whisper-like humming
Itâs calm before the storm

Forest so vast and beautiful its shades
Witnessing the dance of those once human
Now just bleak of before been
Shall they become what theyâve foreseen

Why do they gather to that macabre dance?
Around the darkened bonfires glance
Witches danceâ¦

âOh, streaming winds, give me thine strength
give me thine mighty storms
I am the queen whom the light shall dreadâ¦
Enchantress from the heathen northâ

Again itâs the time of the summoning
A woman is granted with ravenwings
To fly through the skies so bright
And to land where the seas throw their might

Paths that lead to the darkest woods
See them cast their mourning spells
For those not knowing what is grace
Shall not die with witchesâ embrace
