Oh, how I grieve your graven kiss
âIn duskâs fading lightâ
Slowly I wither in my growing loneliness
Like a flower in the summerâs dawn
Where is the beauty of your soft, pale skin
As I drown in the shadows of past

Slowly drifting away from you
Screams of anguish in emptiness
As I mourn my loss of life

Oh, how I grieveâ¦

âWatching as the snow falls downâ
And the shadows as they dance on the walls
âAt last, weâre together as oneâ
My funeralâ¦ has begun

Alone I have lived, alone I will die
With youâ¦ my lifeâ¦
Forgottenâ¦
Without youâ¦
