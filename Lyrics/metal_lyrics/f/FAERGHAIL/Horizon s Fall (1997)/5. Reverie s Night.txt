Look and mesmerize what shall be
And what has been
Over the night and far to the sea
Those stars that heard they scream

On that morning he wanted to feel
That day was written in prophecies

By that day the sunâ¦
Gave birth to its beloved child
The moon thatâs now goneâ¦
The whispers of the elder ones

Look and mesmerize what shall be
And what has been
Longing to shadows, longing for seas
To stars I want to scream

Look and mesmerize what shall be
And what is yet to see
Over the night and far to the sea
Those stars that heard they scream

That evening the skies started to weep
That reveriesâ night of eternal sleep
