So black her hair and pale her skin
With a deadly kiss so pure, so grim
A thousand tears of ice to weep
Have men of betrayal, now asleep

For years have passed and years will be
Touched is she with a gentle hand
Mother of seasons for you to see
By the veil of the mightiest, scarlet and grand

Kuuletko hÃ¤nen huutavan tuskaista huutoaan
Kuuletko hÃ¤nen huutavan lÃ¤pi lumen, alta maan

âFor my veil is eternal...â

By the veil of her is covered the path
Seasons shall come but the veil wonât fall
Those who ride the winds of her wrath
Hear the beloved frosmaidenâs call

âSee the shimmer from the frozen gardens
and feel the breeze from the snow covered shores
for I am the lady of the northâ
