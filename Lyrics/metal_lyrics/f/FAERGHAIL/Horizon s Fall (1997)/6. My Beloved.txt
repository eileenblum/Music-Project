Her skin is soft as wind
Pale like my palms of sin
And her eyes like dark blue seas
Stare me with icy dreams
In my dreams
âWe shall beâ
In my dreams
âIn the worlds beneathâ

And the nightfall is for my bride
Mistress of dawn, embraced by night
Shimmery meadows before the dusk
Beyond the shadows, they will turn to dust

Her skinâ¦

Timeless is our lovelorn night
Secrets of caressing might
Are not held by the blinding light

Forever in our eyes, we see the dying lies
Of the truth of the past,
to days to come will they last?

Fading to dreams, there is something that calls
Her divergent love in those shady halls
For there Iâll return, for there I will yearn
Willing to where the rays of light will not turn
Her spellbinding eyes take my breath
In forbidden paradise for her I have bled
For her lost I will shed tears unseen
Bereaved I will be to see what is planned for me

Her skin is soft as wind
Soft like the swanâs white wings
And her voice makes the weathers fall
Oh, hear the beauty of her song
Storms have torn
âBut we stand tallâ
Storms have torn
âIn those shady hallsâ
