Every day is another rain
A dance between pleasure and pain
And every night is another death
A disturbing dream of hate and regret

Shadows are dancing without a shape
Through the vast lands of murder and rape
Sorrow frozen in eyes of the dying
Deafening silence, no laughter, no crying

Do you know the thing you are after?
Is that sound a song of joy of madman's laughter?
Just tortured soul drowned in sadness
Hunters of night driven by madness

One day i looked at the sun but it burned my eyes
I searched deep in my soul and found a lifetime of lies
These rooms are empty and the house is burning
Through floating soul in flames i'm yearning

Just a blank thoughtless decision
Just empty black eyed vision
A last tender farewell kiss.
Then cut myself, ignorance is bliss
