Over gardens of time towards the frozen shore
You'll find a place where angels dwell no more
A kingdom once stronger than all
Land so glorious and mighty destined to fall

Burned to ashes thrones set alight
With their bloodstained wrath they bear the night

As starfire blazed and rumbled down
Kingdom weeped and king with no crown
They gazed to the future ending up with the past
Standing no chance but built to last

A nightly sky in an evening shade
The land of dreams under the blade
Curse was cast to end the trail
Price paid with blood... Faerghail

Summon the strength gained through pain
Enter the battlefield where heroes where slain
They fall to rise again...
Price paid with blood... Faerghail

Now rise up and reign supreme
It's time to stand and fulfill the dream
They fall to rise again...
Price paid with blood... Faerghail

Like thunderroar raging, spread the wings wide
Like burning eyes gazing, battle begins
Choose your side
Price paid with blood... Faerghail

See the sky that bathes in red
Remember us and dreams we shared
A hymn to this land under oppression
Will they rise again, time shall tell
The story didn't end when they fell
An ode to the beings in hate and depression

A nightly sky in an evening shade
The land of dreams under the blade
Curse was cast to end the trail
Price paid with blood... Faerghail

Summon the strength gained through pain
Enter the battlefield where heroes where slain
They fall to rise again...
Price paid with blood... Faerghail

Now rise up and reign supreme
It's time to stand and fulfill the dream
They fall to rise again...
Price paid with blood... Faerghail

Like thunderroar raging, spread the wings wide
Like burning eyes gazing, batlle begins
Choose your side
Price paid with blood... Faerghail
