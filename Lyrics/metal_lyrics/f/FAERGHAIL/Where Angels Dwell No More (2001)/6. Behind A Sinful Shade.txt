It tears you inside like a razorblade
Hiding behind a sinful shade
Revealing the secrets you wanted to hide
The darkest of nights when something died
Hunt you down, shall drive you insane
Meet your maker at the end of the lane

The fears you possess shall never fade
Reminding you of the errors in life that you've made
Lay down to rest and listen those cries
Of pain and anguish when somebody dies

It tore you down made you end your life
It didn't give you strength but it gave you strife
Now come with me I will take you down
I'm the lord of lies you shall get no crown
Dream the dreams visions so dread
Cause you'll never wake up only end up dead
