Skin so cold as the october sun
A murderess veiled in black
Her dance like the flaring flames
Once enchanted me with her embrace
Forevermore and never to fade
Her quest to burn in a fiery shade
She was the spawn of evil within
With divine grace a martyr of sin

See that silhuette where the towers aloft tall
See her there where horizons' fall
No tears shall be shed for her death
For to the memory of those dreams we shared
And when the autumn reaped near
Her gardens bloomed in a crystal flare
How shall weep the ones of little faith
They shall feel the wrath of my deathmask's hate

Only nighttime cold grant her life
Benighted the days for the devil's bride
Her beauty in death never unseen
Hollow illusions of before been

See that silhouette where the towers aloft tall
See her there where horizons' fall
No tears shall be shed for her death
For to the memory of those dreams we shared
And when the autumn reaped near
Her gardens bloomed in a crystal flare
How shall weep the ones of little faith
They shall feel the wrath of my deathmask's hate

In oblivion I crave for my torchlit shadow
The last torment for this grieving world below
Gone forever flown away with the ravens
Crushed the inner rose by fear and anger

Skin so could as the october sun
A murderess veiled in black
Her dance like the flaring flames
Once enchanted me with her embrace
Forevermore and never to fade
Her quest to burn in a fiery shade
She was the spawn of evil within
With divine grace a martyr of sin

See that silhuette where the towers aloft tall
See her there where horizons' fall
No tears shall be shed for her death
For to the memory of those dreams we shared
And when the autumn reaped near
Her gardens bloomed in a crystal flare
How shall weep the ones of little faith...
