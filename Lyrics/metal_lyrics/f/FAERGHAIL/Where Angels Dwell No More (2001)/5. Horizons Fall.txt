A distant sound of war raging on
When sun has set beyond the golden horizon
A thousand times thousand painful cries
Why god we are victims of your betrayal and lies
Across the plains with torches in hand
To defend with pride their fatherland
Through forests over rivers and deserted fields
Protected by armour, with swords and shields

Fallen have thrones and glorious kings
No time to fly on the triumphant wings
Now castles lie empty, raptured the walls
Gather the troops, fatherland calls

A distant sound of war raging on

Protected by armour, with swords and shields

No time to fly on the triumphant wings
Now castles lie empty, raptured the walls
Gather the troops, fatherland calls

"Please take my life so that I can see
What makes a man my enemy
To die in battle a warrior's pride
Feel the wind as we shall ride
Side by side..."

The light has faded, my eyes can't see
My time has come, in dark they call me
Battle has ended, with that came silence
For what we fought with blades, with violence

"Please take my life so that I can see
What makes a man my enemy
To die in battle a warrior's pride
Feel the wind as we shall ride. Side by side...
