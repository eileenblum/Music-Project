Through the land we rage like thunder
With swords of steel we come we conquer
Caring not shall we rise or fall
Pure in hearts as we follow his call

Our fate...
The kingdom by the wolfen gate
Strife for blood...
Awaiting the rise of new god
Gaze to the sky...
Masked as death and sworn to die
Strife for blood...
Awaiting the rise of new god

Born of evil, we reign for the throne
Following the sign once cast in stone

Our fate...
The kingdom by the wolfen gate
Strife for blood...
Awaiting the rise of new god
Gaze to the sky...
Masked as death and sworn to die
Strife for blood...
Awaiting the rise of new god

Comes morningrise to destroy those lying
Sun sets high upon the dead and those dying
Our souls forlorn to flame and burning fire
We act as beasts of our haunting desire

Battlelust scourge us inherited by death
We face our enemy and blood runs red

Through the land we rage like thunder
With swords of steel we come we conquer
Caring not shall we rise or fall
Pure in hearts as we follow his call

Our fate...
The kingdom by the wolfen gate
Strife for blood...
Awaiting the rise of new god
Gaze to the sky...
Masked as death and sworn to die
Strife for blood...
Awaiting the rise of new god

Born of evil, we reign for the throne
Following the sign once cast in stone

Comes morningrise to destroy those lying
Sun sets high upon the dead and those dying
Our souls forlorn to flame and burning fire
We act as beasts of our haunting desire
