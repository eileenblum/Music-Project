Oh, how move the shadows like years passing by
As one stands alone whom time left behind
For years ago this dweller of night
Held hunger of blood and death inside
Oh, how move the shadows like years passing by
As one stands alone whom time left behind
Battles raged and wars were won
The one knowing not of the battle to come

Fear him not he comes by death
"come with me I'll steal your breath"
The bringer of havoc, filled with scythe
"Baptized in blood I'm the lord of the night"
He fights for no reason
"I slaughter my enemies for pure aggression"
Fear him not he comes by death
"come with me I'll steal your breath"

Full of pride, bloodlust and hate
Not knowing what had been decided by fate
He met the countess, a tempress indeed
Spawn of the vicious nightly breed
She stole his heart and tamed his rage
Once a warrior, now locked in cage
He became a servant with no interest in war
All for one evil deceiving whore

As years went by and seasons changed
Feeling fire in his soul that was left unchained
The bringer of havoc, filled with scythe
"Baptized in blood I'm the lord of the night"
Now he fights for a reason
"My revenge is endless, it shall mark the seasons"
Fear him not he comes by death
"come with me I'll steal your breath"

As years went by and seasons changed
Feeling fire in his soul that was unchained
Once again he fought like a man
Showed to his enemies the son of a warrior clan
He led the troops from victory to victory
Forcing the countess to her somber destiny
As time passed the warrior aged
Gone was the flame which in his soul once raged

I've counted the days and the end is near
I'll leave with pleasure for I possess no fear
Now hear how silent is my scream
And fading like a dream
I depart this world and return I will never
Those clouds of mist shall be my throne forever...
Forever...
