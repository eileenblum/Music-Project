At night you dream of its cutting edge
Awake to see as your blood runs red
Living to die, life flowing out of your vein

At night you dream of its cutting edge
Awake to see as your blood runs red
A suicidal mind as you dwell in your pain

Look in the mirror, what does it portray
"To exit this world is all I crave"
Come forth and step out from the shade
When the knife meets the flesh
and you become one with the blade

Look in the mirror, what does it portray
"To exit this world is all I crave"
Come forth and step out from the shade
When the knife meets the flesh
and you become one with the blade

At night you dream of its cutting edge
Awake to see as your blood runs red
Living to die, life flowing out of your vein

At night you dream of is cutting edge
Awake to see as your blood runs red
A suicidal mind as you dwell in your pain
