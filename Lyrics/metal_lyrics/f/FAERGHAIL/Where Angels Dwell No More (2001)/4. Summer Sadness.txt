Living nighttime, a girl in the dark
Child in misery a child with a sorrowheart
Like whispering words
Summer sadness called her blood
Where all cold and dark unite
She was there, cold gave her life
All alone
Summer sadness in her eyes

Couldn't take the warmth and the rays of light
Against the days she always tried to fight
Warm season's curse
Summer sadness took her life
Now all cold, pale and blue
She found the strength to do the final move
Far away
Summer sadness brought her through
