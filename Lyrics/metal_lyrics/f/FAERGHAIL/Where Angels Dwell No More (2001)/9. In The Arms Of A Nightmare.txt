Wardrum pounded and signed the hordes
Battalions gathered and prayed their lords
The war started and lasted years
Pain was there but they hided their tears
Death in the woods and bombs in the air
It slaughtered the innocence that once was there
They fought like beasts and many of them fell
Ceased to exist in the frontline hell
They stopped showing their emotions, those dulging eyes
Left only the fear of death from the skies

See a dying soul in that distant flare
And the child inside has been left alone to die
Look closer to see he doesn't care
For they came here to battle and not to cry

From cradle to grave shall thee march in vain
Your fate is never to see what's in the end of this lane
Only light you see is your machinegun fire
"To let the reaper get me is my only desire"
"Come with me and I'll take you there
I shall lead you away to another nightmare"
A blinding light and a voice from the sky
"Abandon him for his kingdom is a lie
Follow the light and I'll set you free
Ride on my wings, put your faith in me"
"My mission is not completed I aim to kill
A task of death I shall fulfill"

You've chosen the path that takes you down
Where slaves are kings and the other way around

See a dying man lying there
Sleeping in the arms of a nightmare
Look closer he's a victim of fate
Judged by his personal killing rate
