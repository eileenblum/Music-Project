At night and every day
I wonder what her mind could tell
We play our own forbidden game
I'm a hunter and she is my prey

At night and every day
I wonder what her mind could tell
We play our own forbidden game
I'm a hunter and she is my prey

Never to be tamed, told the look in her eye
Now under my spell, a silver moon child

We bring the heat to the cold sleepless nights again
And our bodies on fire, flames burning higher
Where fantasies take the form of real life

We bring the heat to the cold sleepless nights again
And our bodies on fire, flames burning higher
Where fantasies take the form of real life

Now we pass the day
Night fulfills the air
Dark and yet fine
We go high and fall and never end

Never to be tamed, always been so wild
Now under my spell, a silver moon child

And we are one sin
The strongest will
One sin
The strongest will
