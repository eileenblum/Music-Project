What kind of witness is this?
What are we teaching our kids?
When the cross and your flag stand side by side
Name of God on your lips as you watch them die
You veil your violence in Christian rhetoric
Pick up the sword and you will surely die by it
Not by our hand but from the hate thatâs inside you
Don't pretend your war is what Jesus would do

We will not hate you
But we won't comply
We will stand between you and
Those you want to die
You can try and break us
But we will wear you down
With our capacity to suffer

Your Christian nation is a myth
Your violence will perish with it
Don't mistake our non-violence for weakness
You will have to go through us to get to the helpless
Give up now and join the winning side
Cause to love our enemies were willing to die
We will turn the other cheek
Till you see it's you that is weak

We will not hate you
But we won't comply
We will stand between you and
Those you want to die
You can try and break us
But we will wear you down
With our capacity to suffer
