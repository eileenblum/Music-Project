Told a thousand times to get realistic
Too positive, too optimistic
When you get older this will make you tired
Give up all the things you desired
The real world will make you see this is futile, just let it go
Settle in for a sterile life, giving up in the status quo
But I've got bad news cause I won't be slowing down
Relentless living, until I receive that faithful crown
So take a step back and watch me prove you wrong
Cause my passion and convictions are just that strong
I live this life cause I know it's right
Call me what you want, I'm gritty, grimy and full of light.
I'm not chasing after status or security
Focused only on what, God says I need
Seek first the kingdom and let the rest pass away
Keep my eyes dead set focused on that goal every day
IF GROWING OLD MEANS, GIVING UP
THAN I'll STAY YOUNG FOREVER
