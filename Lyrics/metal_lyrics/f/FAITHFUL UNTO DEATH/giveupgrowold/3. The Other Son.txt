We watched it side by side
Cloud over the temple and fire at night
Saw waters part before our eyes
Cried as food fell from the skies
Can you remember those days? 
Can you remember those days? 
We knew who we were and who our maker was
Our eyes focused hard on keeping His laws
We heard the promise of a land our own
Trusted that He would grow the seeds he'd sown
Can you remember those days? 
Can you remember those days? 

[Chorus:]
But you demanded your inheritance
And left with your eyes set on better things
Now I wish that you would come back home
So we could sit for eternity and truly know
Who we are again. 

After all we've seen
I find it hard to understand
How you could just walk away
Is there something I could have done?
Said more, said less, said anything at all? 
What can I do to bring the exiled home? 
All I have left is fear. 
Sometimes it seems helpless but I know I've got to do, whatever I can
So I'll keep living in a way that makes you question
Cause I know that somewhere deep inside of you
Is a part that hears the still small voice of truth
I long for the day we see you walking up that road
I promise I won't be that other son
I'll be running out to meet you
I'll be running out to meet you
