Heard enough songs to know how it goes
Get in, get bored, head for where greener grass grows
There's no commitment so it's not legitimate
Nothing left to stop you from jumping ship
We live in a world where they say nothing lasts
And you won't say different if you look at my past
But I've finally learned to do it right
Cause that word has no meaning, if it's not for life
Get over those fairy tale romances
Cause real love is about second chances
It's making that choice every day
To live for someone else in every way

[Chorus:]
If I could speak in tongues of angels
If I could move mountains with my faith
If I gave everything I have, away
I would still have nothing
I would still die empty
So when I say that word I want to mean it
Spend my whole life just trying to prove it

It's one thing to say that little word
But will you stick around when life get's hard? 
I've fallen in love with a love devoid of feeling
Learned love as a verb, as choice unwavering
Its self-sacrifice in a cross bearing sort of way
Putting on the character of Christ everyday
