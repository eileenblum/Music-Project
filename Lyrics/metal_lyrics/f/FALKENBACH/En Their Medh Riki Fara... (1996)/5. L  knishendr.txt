[Icelandic]

Heill dagr.
Heilir dags synir.
Heil nÃ³tt ok nift.
ÃreiÃ°um augum
lÃ­tiÃ° okkr Ã¾inig
ok gefiÃ° sitjÃ¶ndum sigr.
Heilir Ã¦sir.
Heilar Ã¡synjur.
Heil sjÃ¡ in fjÃ¶lnÃ½ta fold.
MÃ¡l ok mannvit
gefiÃ° okkr mÃ¦rum tveim
ok lÃ¦knishendr, meÃ°an lifum.

[English translation:]

"Hail, day!
Hail, sons of day!
And night and her daughter now!
Look on us here
with loving eyes,
That waiting we victory win.
"Hail to the gods!
Ye goddesses, hail,
And all the generous earth!
Give to us wisdom
and goodly speech,
And healing hands, life-long.
