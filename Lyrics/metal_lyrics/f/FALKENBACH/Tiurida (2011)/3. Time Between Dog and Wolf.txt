flocks of birds for sake the barren landsi'm following suit with idle heart and empty handshowever strong a rock, time and tide will grind it downto sand and the ground wears its burial gown with gloom-ridden eyes and shrouded in griefi shoulder my past to find my final reliefeach winter ploughed deeper furrows in my facethe next one is sure to leave its terminal trace... terminal trace whomever i owe my life to, it's time now to pay backyet all i have to offer is this battered human wrecki gave more than i had but i'm still willing to give morei swear this oath to me and i swear it with a roar salvation awaits but simple i mindas for me i can fight, i leave nothing behindtrapped in the time between dog and wolfi am trapped in the time between dog and wolf... between dog and wolf
