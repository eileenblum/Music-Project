a first weary glance at a ruby horizon,the last glittering stars now passing from view.the last dream is fading, the daybreack has come,for this morn, now dawning, might be the last. runes shall ye know on untrodden ways.know how to scratch know how to grasp.few only know that othin obtained. runes shall ye know on untrodden ways.know how to round and how to attain.few only know whom freya will chose. ere forenoon came closer that very last day, the sun riding high on a watchet cloudless sky.i left all behind me to follow the path,untrodden for ages by none but the gods. runes shall ye know on untrodden ways.know how to scratch know how to grasp.few only know what othin obtained. runes shall ye know on untrodden ways.know how to round and how to attain. few only know whom freya will chose. the bridge lies ahead know, shining and clear,bright and golden, the lowlands behind.for i am to walk on the untrodden path,to follow the soundings, to never return. runes shall ye know on untrodden ways.know how to throw, know how to read.few only know how to open the gate.
