"...from the darkness, risen our of blackness,
a flame once, burning like red blood
was seen by those who waited for the battle,
to lead them to where blood will soon be shed..."

The oars were shoved into the water,
the wind blew strong and filled the sails
of dragonships
set out for a vikingish foray...

The runes were scratched into the swordblades,
wielded by heathen of the north
to the glory of
Valfreya, Asynja, Vanadis !!!

As darkness fell and all was silent
the air was filled with smell of death
and fires burned
as a sign of asatruian pride !!!

"...The seashore burned like fire
and blood ran down the sands...
Another day of victory
in unknown foreign lands...
...Guided we are by Allfather's might..."
