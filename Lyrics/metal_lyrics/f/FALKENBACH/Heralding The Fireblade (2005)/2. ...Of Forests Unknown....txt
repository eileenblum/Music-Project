On eagle's swift and supple wings
I tore through the utter black.
No clouds above, no ground below
The flame's my only light.
I fell into nothingness until the impact ceased my fall,
Into a world unknown to man....

From a forest, unspoiled, unseen, I perceived
A whispering, summoning me
To follow the path of no return.
Step by step I walked this route nobody ever built
Holding tight onto my shield and sword....

A cloaking darkness embraces me
Though flames are burning bright,
In a distance far a flickering,
The blaze my guiding light.
Snow, caress me, sharp and cold, in the very depths of my hearth.
Tired, frightened now I am; my will now fall's apart....

From a forest, unspoiled, unseen, I perceive
A whispering summoning me
To follow the path of no return.
Step by step I walk this route nobody ever built
Holding tight onto my shield and sword....
