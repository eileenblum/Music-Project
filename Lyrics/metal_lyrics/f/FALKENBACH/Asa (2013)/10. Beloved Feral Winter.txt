[Bonus Track]Snow - caress me
Wind - embrace me
while my traces fade

Moon - the only light
and countless silvern stars
open skies brighten upâ¦

Left - my home
Lost - my retreat
no way to take refuge

Asynjaâ¦

No step forward
nor withdraw
desperate yet stout

A lifetime
struggling for your affinity
and following your signs
till the end of days

Gracious sleep
grants silken dreams
rehashes my frozen heart
silvern like a star,
always and forever,
my beloved feral winter

Rustiling leafs aloft
caressed by gentle gales
the wolves walk at my side

Fires surrounding me
as blue as heaven high
and no one knows my waysâ¦
