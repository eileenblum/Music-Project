... As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And a star will shine
From far away...

...As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And hate remains
Inside my heart

At night a star did shine upon
What once was build on my ancestors' land
When once I was young
Willing to learn
From the old and the wise

...As long as winds will blow
My pride will be
And hate remains
Inside my heart

Evening fell unto this land
That once was build by my ancestors' hand
When I was young
Willing to fight

...for as long as the winds will blow...
