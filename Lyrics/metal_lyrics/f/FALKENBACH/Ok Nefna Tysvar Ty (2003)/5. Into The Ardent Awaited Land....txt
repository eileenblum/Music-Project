Beyond the twilight horizon
Above the shadow of the horses hooves
A maiden behind a golden shield
In a chariot rides across the sky

Two ravens are above us
A long forgotten tale
How it is to reach the utter hail
And the eyes of the Valkyrior caress your heart...

Once you will open your eyes
While a maiden is kneeing at your side
And she will kiss you to awake
For you will stride the mighty rainbowbridge

Two ravens are above you
They will show you the final way
Across the rivers and over the mountains
Into the ardent awaited land
