May Donar grant us guiding wind
Walfrigga bless those wooden boards
- So we will see the morning sun arise -
May the one eyed good lead us through raging storms
- So we will reach our homeward shore -

Allfather Wuotan grant us strenghts to beat those waves
- God of rain and thunder guide us well -
May Freyas star show us our way
- So we will reach our homeward shore -
