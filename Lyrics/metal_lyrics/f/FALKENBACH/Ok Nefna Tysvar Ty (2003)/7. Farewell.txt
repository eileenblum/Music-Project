A cheek was beckoned
By a tear
A hand on a sword
And a whispering to hear

A word never spoken
A deed never done
Time now is near
Farewell my son...

Hail to thee
Great Valkyries
Lead my son to
Where he belongs...

Guide his way while
Crossing the rainbow
Bid him welcome there
Where he belongs...

"Riding on horseback
Winged like the ravens
Eyes of the one eyed god..."

"Sun now shines golden
Through the leaves of the old oaks
Up to the mountain
Now I ride..."

A glorious dream
That was never dreamt
A death never died
And a life never lived

The last words where spoken
While the rising of sun
Time now is near
Farewell my son...

[Ref.]

"Passing the frontier
Of Asgard and Midgard
Of heavens and grounds below"

"Allfather Wuotan's
Ravens my guidance
Leading me high above"

A cheek was beckoned
By a tear
A hand on a sword
And a whispering to hear

The last words where spoken
While the rising of sun
Time now is near
Farewell my son...

[Ref.]

"From beyond the horizon
Glorious rising
The hall of the bronzen shield"

Portals now opened
Bidding me welcome
A shield maiden takes my hand..."
