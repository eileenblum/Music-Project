[Music and lyrics by Igor.]

My life was beautiful as yours
till sorrowul moment in my fate.
One human changed all my life
one day...

My future vengeance
will be so terrible for you!
My expectation
was so long ...

No word can help you anymore.
You will be praying for death.
You'll finish own life in my cage
one day...

My future vengeance
will be so terrible for you!
My expectation
was so long ...

Vengeance!
I can not wait. I'm ready now.
Vengeance!
I need a key to my new life.
Nobody can stop me,
My plan is good, I'll try to run.
Very soon I'll be free,
You have no time, don't try to run
You'll dying slowly
I'll be your God this short time.
It's something inside me...

My plan was successful, and now I am free.
Don't think to run away!
I'll find you asshole. It should be so soon.

I'm waiting that time all my sinful life
since that sorrowul moment.
And this is my fate to be a hangman!
I'm cutting your veins
and seeing in your eyes.
Blood splashing on my face.
I like watching your pain
not trying to kill you.
I'm cutting your brain.

My life was beautiful as yours
till sorrow happened in my fate
But I have changed your life
Right away!!!
