I am running far from something something evil something frightening
Fear of falling fear of death heavy conscience heavy breath
I am a menace cannot you see stay away from me because I am a creep;
Find salvation find some hope if there is no fire there is no smoke

Violent urges tear at my spirit why do I run from me
I am a bad man, I am a madman save your pride and walk away;
Say your prayers and save some face because I am the sandman come to play;
I am a bad man I am a madman I am the sandman come to play
I am a bad man I am a madman I am the sandman come to play

I am running I am still running senses fail and I feel nothing
Fist of fury knuckles red seems my foe has been but to bed;
Why pick on me how tough can you be when deceased
Consequences conscience cries do angels weep when someone dies
