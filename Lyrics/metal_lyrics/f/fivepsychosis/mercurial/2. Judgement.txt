What is there to do with you complete you or destroy
It would not matter in the end you are just another toy,
You keep running panting frightened blinded by your fear
But more bad luck is on the way because I am right fucking here

The scythe comes down your soul no more
You take a final breath your eyes they fill with terror now,
For your sins sudden death

Who knows now what he shall do determining your fate,
Like all those who hurt and kill your end will be your hate
Echoing from hills afar I hear your funeral bell
And now you fall on to your knees before the gates of hell
