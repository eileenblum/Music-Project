Thunderous roar machines of war breaking heaven please no more
Hit us first now you are through we are taking the war to you
Serenaded by the gunfire choir feasting with the dead and the damned
Biding my time until I meet the enemy now taste my steel how does it feel
Fire hit the floor bloodshed another war

Taking control violence, death treating civilians like common threat
Bring destruction blood and gore fire smoke hit the floor
Serenaded by the gunfire choir feasting with the dead and the damned;
Biding my time until I meet the enemy now taste my steel how does it feel
Fire hit the floor bloodshed another war

We are hungry for more we want your blood the more you resist the worse it will get
Die of hunger die of thirst we do not care as long as you are dead
War is over peace is near we have killed them all the skies are clear
Fought hard unleashed our hate no more bloodshed we have changed our fate
Fire hit the floor bloodshed another war
