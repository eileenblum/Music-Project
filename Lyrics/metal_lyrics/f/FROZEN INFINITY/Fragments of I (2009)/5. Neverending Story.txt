Living a life so meaningless
The same tragedies day after day
Obeying the rules that they have made
Condemned to be their mindless slave

No chance to escape, lest the will to flee
Growing in my mind, brings me to see
The confines of this cage that I have built
Keeps me trapped till my fate's fulfilled

It's a neverending story
This misery repeats every day
Through this neverending story
This life is killing me

Stay right in line, obey and sine
Never think for yourself, ignorance divine
They take care of your needs
Even when your heart bleeds

The longing for a superior being

Desperate cries calling through the night
Lacking the will to stand, the will to fight
Complete assimilation, so much to fear
Complete desperation, it's so much to bear

It's a neverending story
This misery repeats every day
Through this neverending story
This life is killing me

Desperate cries calling through the night
The longing for a superior being

It's a neverending story
This misery repeats every day
Through this neverending story
This life is killing me
