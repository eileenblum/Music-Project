Endless longing for improvement
No longer satisfied
What we were born with
Enchanging ourselves
Getting stronger day by day
The weak will be killed
The strong will be filled with pride

Choose your side, your might
Feed your mind with thoughts
Of supremacy, of threatening morality
Trapped inside this life
Our future is coded in a chord
Of self-destructive DNA

Nature's laws have become obsolete

Man or machine
destroying our believes
Devastating our life
Trapped outside Paradise

Growing older day by day
Defeating death
Holding him at bay
Held in sway of the decay
Our body is a temple
Of mind-born blasphemy

Half life of time, downfall society
Leading the rats to come forth
And devour our sanity
Our memories fade, our history repeats
Coding the future in a chord
Of self-destructive DNA

Nature's law have become obsolete

Man or machine
Destroying our believes
Devastating our life
Trapped outside Paradise
