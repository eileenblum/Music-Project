Bitterness is filling me
A cold dawning
Shattered lives and broken dreams
Withered like leaves

Here I stand in my own shade
Missed my mark it is too late
Misery is filling me
I'm giving up I cannot see

Your gods own law you shall obey
Fulfill your chores to him I prayed
There's nothing left inside my chest
Fallen from grace there's nothing left

Fallen from grace
Averting my eyes
Downcast from the heavens
Only fear and lies

Suicidal seraphim
No strength to live no fear to die
Failing the dream
My life runs before my eyes
Cut down your wings
Once soaring high above
When shrieking winds sing
My life essence fades

Committing the first deadly sin
The first deadly sin
As red blood flows I hear me scream
Searing pain

Man-made steel - angelic flesh
Divine essence - diabolic crash
My vision blurs I cannot see
Is it real the pain I feel

I cut my throat I cleanse my soul
A servant who has failed his master
Next station now the gallows pole
Falling down towards disaster

Drowning in hate
I hate myself
Hope fading away
Towards a bitter halt
