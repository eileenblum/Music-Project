Your wrong is right
Your faults are none
You'd swear 'til the end
Your wrong is right
Your faults are none
Open your eyes, my friend

It's the last thing that I wanna hear
Your excuses lie cold and dead here
Just play your games; just follow suit
Around and around, they're haunting you

Circling you has been a pleasure of mine
And I must admit
Your faults don't surprise me one bit
They don't surprise me
Not one single bit

Oh God, bring Your judgement
Let's see it

What have we done?
What have we become?
With this sin, I'll put down the caster's stone

Bring me back, oh God
Wrap me with Your love

Your wrong is right
Your faults are none
You'd swear 'til the end
Your wrong is right
Your faults are none
Open your eyes, hypocrite
