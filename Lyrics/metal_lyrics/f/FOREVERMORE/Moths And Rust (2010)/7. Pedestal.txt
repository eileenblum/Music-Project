For the very first time
Take a bow before them all
Show them what greatness is
How great you are
For the very last time
Take a bow before them all
Show them what greatness is
How great you are

You've been blinded by that mirror
You've been staring at for years
Don't let them catch onto your selfish intentions
You've been blinded by that mirror
You've been staring at for years
They've caught onto your selfish intentions

Were you never taught
Pride goes before destruction
A haughty spirit
Before a fall
This could be your end
Watch your step because this
Won't end well, not at all
You've made your choice

Let them beg, let them bleed
As long as you've satisfied your needs
You've become so cold
Your heart's been crushed with a vise
You're convinced love won't suffice
There's no need to explain
It's just your egocentric way

Your pedestal is breaking
It's failing right at the base
Your pedestal is crumbling
Now wipe the smirk from your face
Lay down your pride
