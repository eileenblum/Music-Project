Rinse and repeat. 
The thought sickens my insides.
Solace never came so easy. 
This carousel you ride won't last forever.
So I'll beg you and I'll plead, 
Get off while you're only bleeding.

Justify everything you do.
It's nothing major. It's just fine.

How long will you return to failure?
It's becoming a second home.
And we both know it's nothing you'd ever show.

This could be your fall. 

Spiraling farther down,
there's nothing but black inside this pit you're digging.
Now hang your head in shame. 
So absolve your last transgression- 
Your failed attempt to gain acceptance.

You coward.
When will you learn your lesson?
What will it take for you to see that you're not fooling anybody?
So please, just take it easy.
