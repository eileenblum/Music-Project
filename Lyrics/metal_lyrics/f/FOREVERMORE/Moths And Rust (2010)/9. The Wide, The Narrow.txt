This is a tragedy if I've ever seen one
You've become a captive with your loaded gun
I've seen this before
I know how this ends
Pull the trigger once again

Following the crowd, it seems
Is your new profession
No matter what it takes
You'd die with them again

It's true- there's still hope, my friends
But this you knew
Your refusal and your cowardice
They will be dealt with

We'll see who's right in the end

So come back my friend
