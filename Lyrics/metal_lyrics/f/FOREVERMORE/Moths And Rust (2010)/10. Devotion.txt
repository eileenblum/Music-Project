Grant me words to speak
Fill my ears with Your melody
Lead me to a higher place
I need Your spirit to pour out over me
I surrender my will- take over me

How could I say
Everything that is on my heart
I pray
Just to feel Your embrace
I will never
I will never

Keep Your arms open wide
I beg as I drown

Forgive my faults as I am only a man
Mold my life to Your will
Break me down
Keep me accountable o the promises I've made

I want to feel ten times the pain that's Yours
When I fail

Just take my everything
All I am is Yours

If everything fades
If everything is turned to dust and decays into ruins, I swear
I will never turn away
I am Yours forever

I will never be ashamed
