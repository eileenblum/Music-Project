What good does it do to hate everything in your sight?
I know your past-
Full of darkness and deceit.
Can you not look back and find one time worth reminiscing?

Nothing ends well this way. 

There is so much more for you to hold;
So much more in store.

So give up everything you call your own.
There's such a better plan for you that you can't even know.
Brother of mine, come home.

Oh brother of mine, be still.
Come home.
Love can end this disastrous state.
Come home.

You'll reap what you sow.
Make this count.

Just like a serpent, he'll flash his his teeth.
The venom calls to betray your newfound peace.
Keep watch.
