You stand at the pulpit, dressed to impress
With your congregation fooled
You may have learned to play the game
But youâve forgotten nothing truly goes unseen

I know youâve chosen to ignore conviction
A steady hand, faux smiles keep it hidden
This wonât last
This won't last
You may have learned to play the game, but nothing, nothing goes unseen

I know youâve chosen to ignore conviction
A steady hand, faux smiles keep it hidden

Your words are laced
They are poison
Your actions reveal your true face

This is the price of what youâve always wanted
What selfishness brings
Your final call, the means to an end
(What went wrong?)
Now as the doors to all your dreams, to your ambitions
Slam shut, do you feel fear at all?

(Your words are laced
They are poison
Your actions reveal)
Your words are laced
They are poison
Your actions reveal your true face
Your words are laced
They are poison
Your actions reveal your true face

You stand at the pulpit, dressed to impress
With your congregation fooled
You may have learned to play the game
But youâve forgotten nothing truly goes unseen

I know youâve chosen to ignore conviction
A steady hand, faux smiles keep it hidden
This wonât last (this won't last)
This won't last

This is the price of what youâve always wanted
What selfishness brings
Your final call, the means to an end

Now as the doors to all your dreams, to your ambitions
Slam shut, do you feel fear at all?

This is the price of what youâve always wanted
What selfishness brings
Your final call, the means to an end
(What went wrong?)
Now as the doors to all your dreams, to your ambitions
Slam shut, do you feel fear at all...
