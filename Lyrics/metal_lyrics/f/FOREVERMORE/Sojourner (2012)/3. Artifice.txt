Look at me
I am the quintessential believer
I am Godâs gift to man
I am a shining example
I am the perfect son
So look at me
So look at me

I can only dream
To be all you see in me
I am truly a broken man
Lost and slowly losing hope as I lead my best friends to sin

I am a
I am a... lie!
I'm living a lie

And all thatâs shining through is my incompetence
I have failed

I am this close
To giving it all up
I swear to God, I'm not making this up
Just give me your attention
God, why wonât you listen?
Wonât you listen?

Desolation
I've lived here far too long, I know
I have failed
(I have failed)

And still
Still you care for me (you care for me)
Still, you love me (still you love me)
Still, God, you love me
