Time has slipped away
My soul cries for peace, for understanding
In this moment, I hear no voice
No revelation finds me

No answers to quench my thirst
Left here to die alone
No answers have quenched my thirst
Am I alone?
(Am I alone?)

Worst of all (worst of all)
I'm just fine
But how can I know if I am free, truly?
Am I free? (free)
Is this life (is this life) worth living?
I've heard the truth will set me free
But all that I've found is this desolate prison
And I'm still breathing

You must acknowledge that youâve fallen down
For us pick you up
You must acknowledge that youâve fallen down
For us to pick you up

Is your soul so worthless to you
(Open your eyes to see this is bigger than you)
That you wonât fight this spirit of complacency growing inside you?

Canât you see whatâs at stake?
The lies wonât keep you afloat
Your soul is not worth your deception
Itâs not worth your pride

Your soul is not worth your deception
Itâs not worth what you call your pride
Tell them
Tell them

Worst of all (worst of all)
I'm just fine
But how can I know if I am free, truly?
Am I free? (free)

You must acknowledge that youâve fallen down
For us to still pick you up
Just acknowledge that youâve fallen down
Weâve come here to pick you up
