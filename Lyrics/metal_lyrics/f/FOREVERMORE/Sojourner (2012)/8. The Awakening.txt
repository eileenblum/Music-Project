Fate has offered this to me
I never chose this life
Destiny chose me

I have given my life away (life away)
To follow you into the darkness
Could this truly be the end?
Is this evilâs bane?
Iâll serve if only for righteousness

Seven years I have waited in hiding
Now is the time
Awaken and fulfill your destiny
Now is the time
Fulfill your destiny

Iâll let nothing stand in my way
And to those who stand in my way:

I will cut out the hearts of the wicked

I will fight through all traces of the adversary
Do not underestimate me

Time is my last hope
Could it be that all I've worked for was for naught? (was for naught)
I have no other choice but to see this through
Cause I've become timeâs last hope (I've become time's last hope)

Seven years I have waited in hiding
Now is the time
Awaken and fulfill your destiny

You have been gifted with courage
Fulfill your destiny
You have been gifted with courage
Fulfill your destiny

Led to the gates of the sacred realm
The king of thieves has come
He has corrupted that which we stand on
The very ground
Heâs corrupted the very ground
I wonât stand for this

Give me one reason to doubt myself (to doubt myself)
Give me one reason to doubt myself
Give me one reason (one reason)
You will be sealed away
