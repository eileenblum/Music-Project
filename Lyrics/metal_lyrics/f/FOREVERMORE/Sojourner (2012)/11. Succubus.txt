My purpose is just to serve
May neither spirit nor life
Hinder me from my only goal
To deal my masterâs wrath

Sliding my way in (my way in)
Staying inconspicuous
I've built up trust
Gained influence over this mind

Now that I've lost all control
Reason has lost its foothold
And I'm alone
And your bodyâs warmth
It never felt so cold
Here in the silence only denying what we both know

Now soak up the pleasure
Now partake in the indulgence
Now soak up the pleasure
Now partake in the indulgence

Now soak up the pleasure
Itâs about the time that you get yours
Do something for yourself

Keep it under wraps (under wraps)
If you must
But we both know
You canât deny whatâs welling up in you
(Itâs welling up in you)

I canât hear your voice among the chaos
I want to be set free
All I'm lacking is the need
And I, I just cannot help but feeling
I'm better off alone
I'm better off on my own

Look how I've turned you
Against everything that you knew
Iâll be back soon enough
This is only the start
I'm not done
