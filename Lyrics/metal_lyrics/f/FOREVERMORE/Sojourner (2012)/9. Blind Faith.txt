Give up your perception of reality
Believing things are exactly as they seem

Can you at least attempt to open up your mind?
You blame those for simply believing what theyâre told
Canât you see the irony?

And I agree
Blind faith is weak
Now show me the reasons for your beliefs

Ignorance!

Attempting to exalt your superiority
Youâve embarrassed yourself
You have become the very essence of what you hate
These things are not as they seem

I will not be one who simply follows
I will never stop seeking the truth
Give up your perception of reality
These things are not as they seem
