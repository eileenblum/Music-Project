Onward!
Step up and move the sieges forward
Weâve heard the cries of the innocent
Onward
Onward, to war
You wonât face this alone

Searching
Following whatâs in sight
Empowered by faithfulness
Weâll see this through
But will you?

Here lie the fallen
Those who couldnât stand up strong
Weâll see this through

Now, the hunted have become the hunters
Rush the gates with a vengeance
The likes of which theyâve never seen
We are the hunters
Letâs give them what they want
The bloodbath of the century

We'll fight
Weâll fight to death or victory

Searching
Following whatâs in sight
Empowered by faithfulness
Weâll see this through
But will you?

Here lie the fallen
Those who wouldnât stand up strong
Weâll see this through
We'll see this through

I know that there is no clear end in sight
Still, perseverance is your only option
See the bodies of the weak
Piling up around you
Survival of the fittest
Itâs completely up to you
It all comes down to you (to you)
(It all comes down to you)

Itâs completely up to you and you alone
The battle is yours if youâll just take it
This is a call to arms
So get up and ready yourself for war
It all comes down to you (to you)

Staring death in the face
Will you back out now?
Will you fold?
Will you take the cowardâs way out?
The night, it grows darker still
Now finally, it all comes down to you
