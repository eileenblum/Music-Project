[feat. Spencer Sotelo of Periphery]Clouds of indifference
Have filled the dark sky that is your mind
Itâs time to man up and decide
Itâs nothing less than do or die

"Weâve won! Weâve won!"
The demons and devils alike
They fix their eyes with malicious intent
They smile, they jest, and they laugh at your sight

This is truly pathetic
And you call yourself a man?

And now this emptiness is all I know
Seeking out whatâs in sight, though I'm alone
Pleading with my own signs
Now find the source of this noxious apathy
This thorn inside of me
Help me find a way out
Find a way out

Solace comes at the worst of times
My spirits lifted
I can hear the battle cry
Hey, hey
This war, it rages on
Indecisiveness ignored

So follow me
Weâll crush the adversary and finally live in peace

So as you sit there up on your fence
Countless lives below, they are lost
Their blood is on your hands (is on your hands)

"Weâve won! Weâve won!"
The demons and devils alike
They fix their eyes with malicious intent
Donât let this be your demise
