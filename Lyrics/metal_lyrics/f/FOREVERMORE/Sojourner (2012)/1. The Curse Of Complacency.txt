Wake up!

Take charge and throw it all off
The spirit of apathy is taking hold of you
And I wonât sit back and watch it devour you
Devour you

You have embraced indifference
Withdrawn a burning passion
Muster up some strength and crawl out

Well I guess this is it
Here we are again
And I know
This time youâll be content
Lying through your teeth again

Repeat
Repeat

Youâre becoming lazy
Youâve made a habit of underestimating

As for me, Iâll lay things out plain
This has wrecked me inside
You were a brother to me
But now that part of you
It seems to have died
I just pray youâre still alive
I pray youâre still alive
I pray you're still alive

Now the ways of your past have been disclosed
And weâre still here (and we're still here)
So invest in something worth dying for
While youâre still here

Complacency
Your curse looms
It begins to devour you
Rose-colored glasses
Shrouded now
Your sight deceives you

Itâs deceiving you
It's deceiving you
It's deceiving you
It has deceived you

Such is the curse of complacency
