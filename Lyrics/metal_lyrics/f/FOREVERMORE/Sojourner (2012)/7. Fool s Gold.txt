The choice is always bigger when put into retrospect
As well as the pain of regret

Double standard now defines my life
Stripped down and abandoned
Every afterthought was just a feeble attempt
To justify why I never tried
Why did I (why did I) never try?

You may delay, but time will not
So stand aside
Make way for the righteous
Or give it up and help us
You may delay, but time will not
So stand aside
Make way for the righteous
Or give it up and help us

And now I'm running in place
Masked by this shame and disgrace

The choice is always bigger when put into retrospect
(Into retrospect)
(Into retrospect)

Every afterthought was just a feeble attempt
To justify why I never tried
Why did I (why did I) never try?

You may delay, but time will not
So stand aside
Make way for the righteous
Or give it up and help us
You may delay, but time will not
So stand aside
Make way for the righteous
Or give it up and help us

I have been stripped down
I have been abandoned
This is your final call
(This is, this is)
Will you ever wake up?
