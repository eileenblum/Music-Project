A common outlook that's so misunderstood
Is you don't lose your faith in God by blaming Him for your anger
Behind humanity constantly failing (constantly failing)
You've lost all faith in yourself
And you can't continue to live like this for the rest of your time

Is this the life that you hoped for?
Is this the life that you made?
Burning every bridge with the ones you meet along the way

Death rests at the tip of your tongue
Your words spread like poison across the horizon
Death rests at the tip of your tongue
Your words spread like poison on their lives

You believe we're so easily misguided
Always bringing false hope
You break the silence when you find out who you are
Look at me, I need to know how you got this far

I wish you could see that desolation's not foreign to you
All your decisions have left you for dead
The crown of apathy rests on your head
And you've yet to be phased
The crown of apathy is burned on your soul

The only time you'll ever wonder where you went wrong (where you went wrong)
Is when your world falls apart on you
And you have nothing left to lose

You want to bring back the ones that you abused
These bitter years of this life you're living
They have nothing to prove

You breathe fire and ice while walking a thin line
Making it known you can't make up your mind
You breathe fire and ice while walking a thin line
Making it known you can't make up your mind
You breathe fire and ice while walking a thin line
Making it known you can't make up your mind
You breathe fire and ice while walking a thin line
Making it known you can't make up your mind...
