How do we make up something so insincere?
This world is drawn near to all these falling patterns
They make our actions and voice we speak
But living in abandonment we shall not reap (shall not reap)
Who else is tired of decaying?
I haven't lived for far too long (far too long)
When my life starts to stand for nothing
Maybe I can explain it through a song

Can you help me find where this direction's heading?
Another path to take, another setting sun
Where are we leading each other?
Is it hope or disease?
Marked with self-righteous cowards afraid to be washed clean

Give me a sign, give me a reason to prosper
Give me what I thought I wanted until I completely fall apart here
Give me a sign, give me a reason to prosper
Give me what I thought I wanted until I completely fall apart here

Sometimes it's hard to hold my tongue when all I see around are wolves
Devouring every step forward that I make

I need to bring myself to safety
I need to find my way back home

If only I could dine with the pigs
When did the swine become something so tasteful?
I scream so loud, but nothing seems to make its way out

I'm on my way home, covered in filth
But that's the way they'll take me
Oh that's the way they'll take me

Take me so I can know your plan
Collect all my fears in the palm of your hand
Oh brother, why are you so concerned with what's right? (What's right)
I've turned away from the past
And I don't plan to be a light (to be a light)
Because I want to be something brighter
And more prone to ignite (more prone to ignite)
Because I want to be fire and cause the world to ignite
I want to be fire
