Torn down and abandoned
This shell of a body fails me now
I've dipped my cup in the fountain of youth
A feeble attempt soon forgotten

All sense of reality has been removed
Now I crave for something more

Lost in the fabric of time between the dead and divine
How profound this state of life
I've given everything to taste the eternal (eternal)

Like a cancer it ate me alive
I've lost my sanity, my heart and my will to survive

I've fallen victim to the dark limits of time (of time)
Oh the irony, for I am the culprit
I am the victim, yet I am the culprit
I am the victim, and now I am the culprit

This is the great divide
I have created the fault line
This is the great divide
And I have created the fault line

My time has come, what have I done?
I've lived to account for these sins of old
My days are done, I'm calling out
But this voice, it fails me now

This is the great divide
I have created the fault line
This is the great divide
And I have created the fault line
