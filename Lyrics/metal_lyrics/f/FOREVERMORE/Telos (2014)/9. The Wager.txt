Eternity awaits me
And I know that we're all broken vessels
Trying to find our way in life
To the ends of the earth
I've searched high and low to no avail
My time was wasted

Why did I ever place my faith
In things that couldn't save me? (Couldn't save me)
Everything was all for nothing
Every breath I took in vain
Everything was all for nothing
Empty words that hold no weight

And now I understand (and now I understand)
That it was all in vain
Here I kneel before my Maker reaching for words
Reaching for words

Ears to hear and eyes to see
But never comprehending
Ears to hear and eyes to see
But never understanding

(Eternity awaits me
And I know that we're all broken vessels
Trying to find our way in life
Eternity awaits me)

Why did I ever place my faith
In things that couldn't save me? (Couldn't save me)
Everything was all for nothing
Every breath I took in vain
Everything was all for nothing
Empty words that hold no weight

Time stands still
I'm running out of breath
Everything around me breathes, except for me
