We fall apart, to get back up
We learn the rules to just get by, that's not enough
We fall apart, to get back up
We learn the rules to just get by, that's not enough
Born to be broken
Born to be broken

This is a human uproar
These are the plagues that contain our souls
We are so easily crumbled and shaped like a paper world

This is the point where I told myself I would never be
Your ideas tempt my mind with something that I never wanted

Even with these constant reminders
But the immoral overlays the benefits
What have they sold us?
What have they sold us here?

In a world where We thrive off hurt and confusion
It's been whispered in our minds that it's just a phase
That it's just a phase
We listen, we accept thinking it will pass
But this state of intertwining's overdue for its last
We listen, we accept thinking it will pass
But this state of intertwining's overdue for its last

I have discovered yet another analytical failure
And its agony flows through our veins

We have strayed from the disease that can take our system hostage
Never will I compare myself to the gold that you claim
Never will I settle in this grave that you call home

It's not enough, it's not enough, it's not enough
I won't settle any longer
This is the point when you suffer

We fall apart, to get back up
We learn the rules to just get by, that's not enough
We fall apart, to get back up
We learn the rules to just get by, that's not enough
