I've returned to a city rebuilt
Only to watch it fall again
How entirely common is it for one to retreat?
Ignoring every sign from the depths of proof
You have truly seen miracles
But still question my existence every day

I've seen Your name be used to gather a profit
But what difference does it make between you and I? (Between you and I)

We've all sold God
For this half-hearted formula
Bearing what we want from this earth
Then coming back to You for answers in the end

When will our youth break through struggle?

I'm guilty yet forgiven
Oh how we take for granted the second chance
There is no point in taking yourself to a degrading level

We've all sold God
For this half-hearted formula
Bearing what we want from this earth
Then coming back to You for answers in the end
We've all sold God
For this half-hearted formula
Bearing what we want from this earth
Then coming back to You for answers in the end

I've returned to a city rebuilt
Only to watch it fall again
When will this cycle end?
When will this cycle end?
When will this cycle end?
