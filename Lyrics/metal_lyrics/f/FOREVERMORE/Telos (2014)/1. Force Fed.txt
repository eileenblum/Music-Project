Do you remember what it was like to feel alone?
Dragging me through hell at my weakest hour
Bury me alive and walk over my grave like I'm nothing
Like I'm nothing

Tell me, tell me how you really feel
Tell me all the things you've done because you were force fed
It's your choice to lose your state of mind
Your own free will (your own free will)

Force fed lies
Force fed failures
Force fed dreams that fall apart
Force fed lies
When I lose control of all I hold
Force fed failures
My life will slowly fade to black

And I finally realize
That I'm the one that can take control of myself (take control of myself)
I am the one that is in control
The world never stood a chance

And now I understand
This is all worthless!
This is all worthless!
Unworthy (unworthy)

Everything that you've asked me to be, I've lost
And now I'm running around in circles
Trying to find my own sense of discovery (of discovery)

I've been sleepless
Trying to wrap my mind around how I can be useful
I've been defiant because I know what's in store (know what's in store)

Force fed lies
Force fed failures
Force fed dreams that fall apart
Force fed lies
Force fed dreams with a new start
