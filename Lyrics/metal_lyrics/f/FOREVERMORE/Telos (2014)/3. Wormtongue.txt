Bow to me, the cowardly
Crown me king of the vile

See how you've fallen so far
Pursuing foul endeavors to find who you are
And I know, you think that time will heal all
But you're falling faster, your throne is shaking

When was the last time that you stood for what you built?
When will you ever learn to face this fear?
You're screaming out for help
But I can't hear you, no I can't hear you now

Blind ambition, you only see the ones you want to blame
Don't turn your back away from the sky
Darkened intention, I won't stop until you see your lies

You walk the path of hypocrisy
Evil has crowned you king
And now, when it's all said and done
You will be made low
Cast to the depths of the sea

Deceitful tongue, I'm calling your bluff
They'll watch as I rip you out
Deceitful tongue, I'm calling your bluff
I'll bury your throne in the sand

This is the end of your reign, king of corruption (king of corruption)
This is the end of your reign, king of corruption (king of corruption)
And I won't settle for anything other than justice

This is your chance for redemption
To right the wrongs of affliction
This is your chance for redemption, your final call (final call)
This is your chance for redemption
To right the wrongs of affliction
This is your chance for redemption, your final call

Deceitful tongue, I'm calling your bluff
The world will know you're corrupt

See how you've fallen so far
Pursuing foul endeavors to find who you are
And I know, you think that time will heal all
But you're falling faster, your throne has collapsed
