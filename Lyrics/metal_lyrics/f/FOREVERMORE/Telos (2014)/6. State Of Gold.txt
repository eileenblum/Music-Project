Death will hold nothing against us
Death will hold nothing against us

I see a revolution bound for freedom
Taking hold of what's rightfully theirs
The only path we see is forward
And our torches stay held high

Break down these walls
We have no problem becoming martyrs for our generation
Stand up and reach out
And realize that you're not alone
The walls around will crumble and sometimes you'll be slowed down
But you'll rise like a phoenix and the ones around will pull you out

I know we won't be shaken
This is the path we've taken

We will move forward
We know we're not alone
If they say it's not our virtue, then we prove them wrong
We will not run away because it's all we've known
They'll start losing their mind due to the fear of growth
They will see it in your eyes
They will see it in your actions
The passion in your life means more than all your past mistakes

Open the gates
Our youth will avenge this evil
Open the gates
And let your spirit free

I know we won't be shaken
This is the path we've taken
Can you receive the truth alone?

We will move forward
We know we're not alone
If they say it's not our virtue, then we prove them wrong
We will not run away because it's all we've known
They'll start losing their mind due to the fear of growth
They will see it in your eyes
They will see it in your actions
The passion in your life means more than all your past mistakes

Stand up and stand tall
And hold your torch high
See your future is written in the sky

I see a revolution bound for freedom
Taking hold of what's rightfully theirs
The only path we see is forward
And our torches stay held high
