I never had to be anything
Until I saw myself in the mirror
At that point, what I saw was lost hope
And knew there was time for a change

This world will be forgotten
Just don't leave it empty now
This world will be forgotten
Just don't leave it empty now
Sometimes we paint these pictures, just to start all over

We realize where these colors take us
They're bleeding through the canvas
To reproduce our image into something more distinctive
Into something more distinctive
These thoughts grow into newfound efforts
And time never seems to be on our side (on our side)
Until we hang these art forms on the walls around us
And continue to be unsatisfied

And I don't wanna live like this again
I thought you said it would be so simple
And I can't continue to live like this
Because my own plans aren't so wishful
Because my own plans aren't so wishful

I dream and dream but never seem to be on page with my own visions (my own visions)
But I'll take the path where my Maker leads me
And strive to be a tool in His hands
