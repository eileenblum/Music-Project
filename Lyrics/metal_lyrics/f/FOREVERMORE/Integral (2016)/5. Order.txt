The Order finds me
Havoc flees
I find myself, my reason
I am only a fragment of her physique
We say unto you, dispose of all you possess
Embrace us
Law scribed on our hearts
The Order states
My purpose and my place:
To be a part of the body
Enslaved to truth, yet freed of my primal ways
Fed up with seeking glory
Unsatisfied
Wonât you submit to her law?
Give up yourself
Join the righteous fight
We say unto you, dispose of all you possess
Obey us
Law scribed on our hearts
The Order states
My purpose and my place:
To be a part of the body
Enslaved to truth, yet she frees us of our destined bane
Pledge to us
She'll see to it that you're delivered truth
Pledge to us
Eternity is her guarantee
We say unto you, dispose of all you possess
Obey us
The Order finds me
Havoc flees
You find yourself, your reason
We are only a fragment of her physique
We say unto you, dispose of all you possess
Obey us
Law scribed on our hearts
The Order states
My purpose and my place:
To be a part of the body
Enslaved to truth, yet freed of my primal ways
