An entire world at hand
A lost mind in the fight
No sense of direction
Nowhere to hide
Red in tooth and claw
Perpetual violence
Unrelenting assault
With only instinct guiding me
Red in tooth and claw
Unrelenting assault
Is this the only way to
Survive
I open my eyes I realize
Space between the body and mind
In spite of revelation
I'm compelled to persist
The pursuit of wisdom forsaken
I fight to exist
I find myself in a world
Propelled by the force of my own will
Scratching out a life with my own two hands
No time for seeking clarity
In this never ending scarcity
Survive
I open my eyes I realize
Space between the body and mind
Survival
I open my eyes I realize
Space between the body and mind
Unsafe and unspoken
This is all that I know
A buried identity
I stand alone
Survive
I open my eyes I realize
What else can be made of this life
