Truth is a matter of context
Every idea, every value
Can you prove it better than the rest?
We're all the same
You're no better than the rest of us
You forged a tomb
Disguised as a shelter
You lit the fuse
Now face your deadline
The innocent sentenced to a hell
Pursing capital, turn your head away as they plead for your help
Well they all had a story to tell
Now, try not to look away as they burn
So much damage done,
How long until you realize
This is our last shot?
Truth is a matter of context
Every value
Can you prove it better than the rest?
We're all the same
You forged a tomb
Disguised as a shelter
You lit the fuse
Now face your deadline
