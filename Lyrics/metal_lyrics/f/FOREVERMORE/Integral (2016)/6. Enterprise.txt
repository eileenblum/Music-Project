I've explored a thousand doors and seen a thousand shut
An empire at stake, I know what must be done
Made my way to the top without ever looking down
A glorified slave no more,
This is the pursuit
I play the game to win,
Get to the bottom of this
Turn a blind eye to your blind faith
I will not bow down
I control my fate
From the top of the pinnacle Iâll build my throne
A free world
Free will
Set apart from confinement that bound me
My eyes are open, yet this is a dream
I wont wait to receive the truth
I'll fight to find it
I won't be mislead down the mountain
I'll reach its peak
I'll climb it on my own
From atop the pinnacle, Iâve built my throne
Free world
Free will
Set apart from servitude
My eyes are open, yet this is a dream
I play the game to win,
Get to the bottom of this
The world now held in my palm
Discovery alone, brought me to where I belong
I know I'm safe here
A slave no more
This is the pursuit
I play the game to win,
Get to the bottom of this
Turn a blind eye to your blind faith
I will not bow down
I control my fate
Show me something more than the words in your script
Prove it to me
