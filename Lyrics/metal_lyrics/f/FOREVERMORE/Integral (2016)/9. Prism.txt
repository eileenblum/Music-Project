I see the world in every shade
I know exactly who you are and who you need me to be
But is it all for one, or one against all?
Always forsaking the past and fearing what lies ahead
And this pursuit of certainty has only ended in rivalry
Lives engulfed by the friction, united only by division
"Now we have the light"
Your collective battle cries,
"Our notion will prevail, all others will surely die"
"Now we have the light"
Forever chasing a new harmony
Can't you see your light is a fabrication from a false source?
Ever-changing, transformation hasn't run its course
You and I will never see the same
Set apart by the differences on this page
It's okay, I'll embrace my solitary state
I see the world in every shade
I know, exactly who you are and who you need me to be
It's one against all
