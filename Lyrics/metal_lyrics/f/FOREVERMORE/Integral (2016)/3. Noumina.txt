This is give and take
Weâve all wasted away in vain
Lost in a life of false endeavor
Lost in a life of self-seeking gain
We bind shoulder to shoulder
Let this dry spell end
We're weary from thin air that fills our lungs
If iron sharpens iron, weâre longing to be used
To fix our gaze collective
Colorless I grow
I canât flourish on my own
And now with helpless hands may we come alive?
Our numbers down, thinned out,
Expire or thrive
Beg the favor of our earth below and sky above
We bind shoulder to shoulder
Let this dry spell end
We're weary from thin air that fills our lungs
If iron sharpens iron, weâre longing to be used
Send the rain, or weâll cut out the roots
Colorless I grow
I canât flourish on my own
And now with helpless hands may we come alive?
Our numbers down, thinned out,
Expire or thrive
From the dust weâve come, to the dust weâll go
Mother earth, father sky, let us reap what we've sown
Colorless I grow
This is give and take
Weâve all wasted away in vain
Send the rain
Saturate
This is give and take, and now we see clearly
Everything breathes
From the dust weâve come, and now we see clearly
Everything breathes
Colorless I grow
I canât flourish on my own
And now with helpless hands may we come alive?
Expire or thrive
