I'll grab the world by the throat
Conquer, destroy, divide
My only master is time
Disguised from beginning to end
Confidence in consequence
Rationale ascends and from the depths of dust I've watched us spring
And I pursue the power calling me
Rationale ascends and power calls me
Rid my way of the feeble at heart
What a great disdain I've learned for you
Losing grip of a mystical mind
I feel my iron fist clinching our fate
Here, I will define our course
Hear me, declare me king
Now, I see, the beauty of dominion surrounding me
Then, you sought, for validation from the stars
And now I decide the Earth won't tell my future
I'll write my own
I'll grab the world by the throat
I'll grab the world by the throat,
Conquer, destroy, divide
My only master is time
I confess
Your expense is my gain
I confess
Your entire life fed my flame
And to tell the truth, I wouldn't change a thing
When all of the ones who I loved, I traded for nothing
