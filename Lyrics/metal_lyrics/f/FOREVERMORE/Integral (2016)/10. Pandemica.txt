A new light that guides my way
A new path beneath my feet
Breaking through the stone where roots are showing, a tree is growing
There is no "one way"
No need to follow suit.
Every stage has its purpose
Every branch will bear its fruit
Can you see earth's on its deathbed?
Fading light, on borrowed time
Can we let go of our pride?
We must relinquish this fight
And now I see we've found a new way
We have discarded the desire to follow suit
Every stage serves its purpose
Every branch will bear its fruit
Can you see earth's on its deathbed?
Fading light, on borrowed time
Can we let go of our pride?
We must relinquish this fight
Cast regard to the sky as the tides rise
Virtue shallows â
The masses' demise:
A world at war
Can you see earth's on its deathbed?
Fading light, on borrowed time
Can we let go of our pride?
We must relinquish this fight
