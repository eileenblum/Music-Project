Seeking promise, loyalty and truth
We ride amongst those who are the broken youth
For seasons past we've waited calmly
To return this place to a civilized society
We must not waiver on our course
Weâre destined to continue no remorse
In this humanity's doom we'll all be put to the test
Will valor prevail or will your soul never rest?
Take a breath
Return the hope for all man kind
Trust in yourself and follow the light
Open your eyes believe in the fight
We will be another fallen town.
Until valor we ride amongst those broken youth
We must not waiver on our course
Weâre destined to continue no remorse
