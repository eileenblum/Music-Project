So many things to say, But they will never mend.
And until this day when my word stood true,
Iâm leaving the past behind to start over with something new.
I hope this tears you apart,
I hope this haunts you inside.
I remember what you said to me,
The first time you died.
I've watched us fail; more then I'd like to admit.
Youâre nothing more to me then a selfish fucking heartless fake.
Living in your lust; I see past the versions of your face.
I'm scratching your name off the one and only lover's list.
When I still believed in the word but now itâs gone you cease to exist
So don't let down your guard and keep your enemies close.
Hereâs where itâs setting in to theâ¦
Youâre nothing more to me then a selfish fucking heartless fake.
Living in your lust; I see past the versions of your face.
Fist full of guilt send the damage to your name.
I hope this feeling fucking haunts you inside.
I'll send you off with a final goodbye,
These dreams have faded of you and I.
Silent Treatment now
