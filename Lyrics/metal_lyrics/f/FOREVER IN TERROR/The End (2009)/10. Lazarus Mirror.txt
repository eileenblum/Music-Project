The gates are closed, thereâs no more sign on life.
This blood's been spilled-it pours down slowly from this heavenâs might.
Skin burns in agony; youâll lead a life a legacy.
Learn through pain, now my name you fear the rest of me.
Standing on hollow ground the end is near in sight.
A man has placed his future walking towards this bitter light.
Once true deceiver,
I see what Iâve become
Sell your soul, take the fall as your skin begins to boil.
I see what Iâve become.
All my days are trances,
All my nights were dreams.
Truth in anatomy, nothing is what it seems.
See what you've become?
To see what Iâve become.
My fears have become true, just learn to respect.
Your words grow short; your mouth is living with regret.
Would you save me now?
Can you save us all?
Once true deceiver,
I am a believer these prayers will save us all.
