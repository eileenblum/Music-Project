Take this fear-fold it up and let it sink in,
I'm fucking finished hoping for this life to begin.
The world has fallen my time is calling, this is my destiny.
Learning lessons with interceptions getting the best of me.
"I'll give this all I've got, we can not let this fail.
Through all of these shards of glass and still these feelings will prevail"
Laugh in the face of failure, It's now became my middle name.
No bringer of fortune could tell a truth to leave your words living in vain.
The final warning signal slips through my grasp,
To fuel the fire, burn with desire or your chance will pass.
Now it's leaving you behind...
"I'll give this what I've got; we can not let this fail.
Through all of these shards of glass, and still these feeling will prevail"
The day the world was mine we fell away.
