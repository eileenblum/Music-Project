The lines we follow,
Have driven us to this place.
Look past the present
To look the future in its face.
Where the sky still shows on our side.
Let us know that we're still alive.
That we're still alive
This is our time to shine the reason for our lives,
To take this in and hold it close. Donât let it go
For better or worse we grow.
(Despite past mistakes)
To live on you have to know.
(Moving forward)
The Sunlight shows us, Where it hurts the most.
And this is where it hurts the most.
To live on without the one I love toâ¦
Standing alone in the sunlight sands,
I have become a ghost.
That we're still alive
