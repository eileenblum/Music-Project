Searching out to find a pattern in the center through and through.
The light that shines brings us all closer to the end of truth.
"And I can't do this on my own a million miles away, and I feel so all alone.
Now Iâm so alone..
In a structure filled with lies and ties taking up their turn.
To let the rays shine down, Now we watch as this city burns.
A losing war, in this balance of mankind.
Our twilight will be found when the sun has set.
A losing war, in this balance of mankind.
Our twilight will be found when the sun has set.
The day this earth stood still.
We watch them fade away.
