The moonlight hangs above our bow.
Calm night air spreads out its cold breath.
Denial is vain; you never wanted a shallow grave.
Overtaken by scoundrels
You swallow your pride
To drown in your shallow grave.
A captainâs death, one contempt and brave. 
Over the edge, forget the past
Youâve seen your future, a moonlit path
Now we dance to release this bitter plague.
Now you...
Dance beneath the waves
To drown in shallow graves.
