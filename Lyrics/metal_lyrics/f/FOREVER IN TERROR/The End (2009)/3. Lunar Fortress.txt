Through this struggle, is where we've made our place.
Constant demise shown by the human race.
Just shut this fading case and swallow down the key,
Placed fate in the hands of vengeance, a liarâs truth is any word he speaks.
I can not hold the world; the weight will crush my back.
The dial's set to incinerate, Targets locked and it's ready for attack.
And we're ready to attack.
The shadows cast, we live in the darkest of the night.
A billion miles away and still no closer to this Heaven's light.
This battle ground will host the mightiest of men,
Twelve spears to cast them down and burn our palace to the ground.
Burn our palace to the fucking ground.
The weight will crush my back.
I can not hold this world..
So will this fortress fall?
Tear down another wall
This burden on us all
Fuck You
We've waited for this call
For chances not to fall
The writings on the wall
Now we fucking take you,
This is my chance to hold
To break the fucking mold.
This life is yours to loathe
Now we fucking take you on!
