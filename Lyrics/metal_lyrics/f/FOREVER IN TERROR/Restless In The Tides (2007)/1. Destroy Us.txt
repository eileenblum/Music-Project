Confusion of a beautiful mind, separate skin from bone.
Pencil in my body, to see my live. We move apocalyptic thoughts beyond the grave.
Destroy Us, limb-from-limb. The resolution the only way is death.
And now you'll feel my shake. Our inner ashes will awake.
The moral of the story, Is I have planted my feet. This soil is forbidden.
Destroy us, limb-from-limb The only way is death. Your resolution, the only way is death.
Carry my body to the sacrifice
And now you've lost your own, you've finally made it through.
