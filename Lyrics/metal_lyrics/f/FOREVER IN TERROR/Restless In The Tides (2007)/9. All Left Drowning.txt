You cant stop whats within, these skies bleed with hate.Burn this temple
killing horrific rates.
Condemn the founders, we cant all survive
all left drowning. Shall arrive in your dreams tonight.
Nothing you've known will survive. In your dreams tonight. Not a soul
you've known will be left alive.
Forever in your nightmares, you'll have to chase.
 The one thing more,longing for.
Enchained in reality, We cant all survive.
All left dead
Shall arrive in your dreams tonight. Nothing you've known will survive.
In your dreams tonight. Not a soul you've known will be left alive.
You won't stop me.
Your skies will bleed.
