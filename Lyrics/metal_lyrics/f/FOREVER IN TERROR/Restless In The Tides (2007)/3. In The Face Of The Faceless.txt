Trapped confronting falsehood with reality, As the lies seep through your teeth.
Blinded by stories of hopelessness fearing what is to come.
Do not falter, do not abate, do not retreat to the keep.
empower the revolt, with words of patronage. Will you crumble before you liege.
(And now you beg for forgiveness) The faceless liege.
(Upon your self you brought this, suffering) You see whats present, but believe whats thought.
Will you crumble? Will you stand as your baron, or will you kneel with doubtfulness.
Now you've faltered in the face of the faceless, Faltered in the face
of the faceless, faltered in the face of the faceless.
Your absence was awaited, now we're free of you. We knew long ago it wouldn't last.
You've failed in this world, Your time has passed. You've got yours at last.
You'll fall before your liege.
and now you have faltered in the face of the faceless.  Crumbled at the hands of your maker.
(And now you suffer.)
