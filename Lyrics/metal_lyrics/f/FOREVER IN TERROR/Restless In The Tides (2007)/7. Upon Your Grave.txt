We will not, we will not stand in your shadows and we will not,
bow down and we will not suffer your torment again.
Sign this declaration, sign it with your blood.
You live this life of your own, the path to hell you chose.
This putrid angel of demise, and father of his sins.
I stand upon your grave seeing disgrace. I wake in misery, every day I
know that you still alive.
This death note, you've signed with pride.
Upon Your Grave.
