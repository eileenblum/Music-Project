Your blood drips down, as my smile gets grotesque.
My heart gave to you, then ripped from my fucking chest.
This life means nothing, this life is absurd, Your time reaches its final stage.
Don't say a fucking word.
(You Will) Live and die for salvation,(You) will never breathe the air.
(You Will) Betray me like you always do, swear to him I fucking hate you.
Locked in a world, filled of violent horrific ways, All I see is darkness.
When light comes all I see if gray. Locked in a cellar of distress as I strive for the gates.
You've fucked with me for the final time, Now heres your fate.
LEVIATHAN
Release Your Hatred,Release Your Hatred. Leviathan.
You will never change all these ways.
