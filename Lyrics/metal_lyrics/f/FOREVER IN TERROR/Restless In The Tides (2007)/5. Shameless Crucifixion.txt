I have been sent here, to kill all of you. Can't see beyond your reach is a world of..
A world of pain and suffering, everyday you'll re-live.
Your shameless crucifixion, shameless crucifixion. In Hell.
I won't think twice, to pull the switch to end. Your life is fading faster, just like and hourglass.
That has been running dry.
This shameless crucifixion. Crucifixion.
