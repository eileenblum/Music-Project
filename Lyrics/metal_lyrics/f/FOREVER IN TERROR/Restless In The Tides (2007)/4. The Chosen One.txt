You're the chosen one, Taste hate at the hands disposal. You pretend to be the chosen one..
But who you are, from the outside in. Take these answers and throw them away.
One day you'll look down at this recollection, Portraying yourself as a god.
But simply I am just a being, my eyes stay forever blind. A single move is all it takes, to end.
The lines, the lines they came crashing down.
Your mine. Your ours, the lines came crashing down.
Your mine, your ours. In time they'll all fall away.
Your the chosen one.
