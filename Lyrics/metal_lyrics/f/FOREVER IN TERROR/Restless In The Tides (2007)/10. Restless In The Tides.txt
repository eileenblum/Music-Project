It was a dark day. Who knew if would be her last. All I remember, the waves broke her like glass.
Your eyes, paralyze me. I realize now that your gone.
Take her away, She's restless in the tides. Theres nothing left but this, Black day.
Now here I stand.. Restless in the tides. The gunshot rings.. Wash ..Away.
The memories of her eyes, Blind me. Kill me.
And I know you'll be gone forever. Kill me, Kill me!
