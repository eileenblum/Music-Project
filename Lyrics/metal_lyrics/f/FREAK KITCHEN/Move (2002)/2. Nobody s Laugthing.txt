Nobody's laughing here
Nobody's laughing

Your mouth is open wide
Words spin a cynical swing

It's getting cold in inside
While I hear you joking...

Sarcasm Boy
You know, some of us are not amused

Nobody's laughing here
Nobody's laughing
Nobody's laughing here
Nobody's laughing

The superficiality
And verbal diarrhea's OK

What scares the pants off me
Is what you really say

Sarcasm Boy
You know, some of us are not amused

Nobody's laughing here
Nobody's laughing
Nobody's laughing here
Nobody's laughing

Tell me, do I have a hunch?
Should I take you seriously?

We're such a clever bunch
Generation Irony

But nobody's laughing here
Nobody's laughing

Nobody's laughing here
Nobody's laughing
Nobody's laughing here
Nobody's laughing

You have a ball your way
And I am entitled to mine

Still, I think my hair will turn gray
Waiting for the punch line
