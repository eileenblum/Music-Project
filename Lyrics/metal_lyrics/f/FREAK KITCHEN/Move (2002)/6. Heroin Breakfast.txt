That junkie logic is bound to fail
We've heard it all before
You defend yourself with tooth and nail
But never fight the downward spiral war

Here we go again...

When everything is said and everything is done
One could always suck the barrel of a gun
Get your shit together, beat that rotten past
There's no way a starving soul like yours would last
Another heroin breakfast

Every time you're getting back on track
And at least feel semi-well
You take a colorful little something
With side-effects from hell

Here we go again...

When everything is said and everything is done
One could always suck the barrel of a gun
Get your shit together, beat that rotten past
There's no way a starving soul like yours would last
Another heroin breakfast
