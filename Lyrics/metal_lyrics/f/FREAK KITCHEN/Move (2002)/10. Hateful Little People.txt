They never tell you face to face
They are the one and only race

They always smile and are polite
They go thru life in black and white

They close their eyes and all is bliss
They always scent of prejudice

They cannot spell hypocrisy
They're everywhere; they're you and me

How did we become
Such hateful little people?
How did we become
The scab that we are?

Where's it coming from?
Hateful little people
How did we become
The scab that we are?

I hate you
You hate me
We hate ourselves

How did we become
Such hateful little people?
How did we become
The scab that we are?

Where's it coming from?
Hateful little people
How did we become
