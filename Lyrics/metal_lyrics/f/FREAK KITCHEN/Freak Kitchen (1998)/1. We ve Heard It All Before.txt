Haven't got the time for this, waiting makes me sick
Tell me what the hell you want and tell it to me quick
My modem isn't fast enough, maybe I've been screwed
Let's go for some drive-in food that's already been chewed
I don't give a shit about some dolphins in some net
Or if some Chinese dudes kill a bunch of monks down in Tibet
I got to hurry but I don't know where to yet
You know we've heard it all before
And we are jaded to the core
Give us something new
Something we can trust...
You know we've heard it all before 
We've heard it all before 
Give us anything 
Something we can trust... 
Used to think that rap was cool, even wore a golden chain
Tried to blow my head away to honour Kurt Cobain
I got to hurry to empty my hollow brain
You know we've heard it all before
And we are jaded to the core
Give us something new
Something we can trust
You know we heard it all before
We heard it all before
Give us anything
Something we can trust...
Give it to me all the time, in every possible way
Give it to me all the time, 48 hours a day
