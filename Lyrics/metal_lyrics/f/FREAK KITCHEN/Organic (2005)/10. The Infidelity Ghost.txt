What doesn't mean a thing to you, means everything to me
Please be careful what you do, because I am trying desperately

To stay afloat, to stay real, to be the person I need to be
Yet your pathological new man might screw you up permanently

One step forward, one step forward and a million miles back...

I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
But there's one thing I fear the most

I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
But there's one thing I fear the most

The Infidelity Ghost

Wish you could trust my loyalty, stick with me through thick and thin
But I am tempted easily, don't want to know where I have been...

Anemic blood flows through my veins, an insult to monogamy
I'm not sure I can dispel, The Ghost of Infidelity

One step forward, one step forward and a million miles back...

I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
But there's one thing I fear the most

I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
But there's one thing I fear the most

The Infidelity Ghost

One step forward, one step forward and a million miles back...

The Infidelity, The Infidelity Ghost

I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
But there's one thing I fear the most
I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
One-guy girl
I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
But there's one thing I fear the most
I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
But there's one thing I fear the most
I'll be your one-girl guy, if you'll be my one-guy girl
(The infidelity ghost!)
But there's one thing I fear the most

The Infidelity, The Infidelity Ghost
