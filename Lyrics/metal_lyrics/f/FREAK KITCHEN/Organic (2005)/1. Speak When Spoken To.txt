There's something foul with my oral opening
I can not seem to control it, I object to everything
You know, I'm talking all the time
But I've got bupkiss to say
The ka-ka my vocal cords produce
Even outdid my ass today

Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!

Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to

Pseudo-provocative, I haven't got a clue
What I'm referring to, I just argue 'til I turn blue
The sound of my own voice gives me
An intellectual high
I get off on my own arrogance
I'm so cynical I could cry

Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!

Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to

My mouth's in good shape
My lips are itching
Spare me some duct tape

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!

Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to
