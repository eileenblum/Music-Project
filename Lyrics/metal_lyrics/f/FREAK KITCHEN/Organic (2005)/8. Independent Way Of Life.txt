I'm so alternative
I am so independent
This is the way to live
The independent way of life

I'm so alternative
I am so independent
This is the way to live
The independent way of life
The independent way of life

I'm twenty-five or so
At least I was twelve years ago
Despise my existence
And my miserable gothic wife

Have no identity
Have no personality
You wouldn't notice me
Even if I stabbed you with a knife

Now I am so depressed
And my eyes are painted black
My days are one long trauma
I'm about to crack

I am so happy...

I'm so alternative
I am so independent
This is the way to live
The independent way of life

I'm so alternative
I am so independent
This is the way to live
The independent way of life
The independent way of life

My day's a pile of shit
I love every minute hating it
The way I dress reflects my soul
I'd never anything Nike

I hardly ever sleep
Sleep is not considered deep
I'm really difficult
Detest everything you like

Play me your favourite tune
I'll convince the world it's junk
But if you listen to what I listen to
I will slip into a funk

I am so special...

I got a gig today
You won't believe the stuff we play
We just signed a major deal
Riches are heading our way

I was alternative
I was so independent
This was the way to live
The independent way of life

I was alternative
I was so independent
This was the way to live
The independent way of life
The independent way of life
