Chest pain!
Chest pain!

So I've been acting somewhat weird recently
I guess it's life that's catching up on me
Tired of pretending
Run out of fasade
Caucasian puppetry

You can only keep things
Stashed away for so long

I've had all the shit I can take
All the shit I can take
To push me now is a grand mistake
I've had all the shit I can take

Chest pain!
Chest pain waltz!
Chest pain!

Here comes another stunning panic attack
Increase the dose, there is no turning back
My legs feel kind of dead
Massively irrational
Shock treatment maniac, maniac!

You can only keep things
Stashed away for so long

I've had all the shit I can take
All the shit I can take
To push me now is a grand mistake
I've had all the shit I can take

Chest pain!
Chest pain waltz!
Chest pain!

I've had all the shit I can take
All the shit I can take
To push me now is a grand mistake
I've had all the shit I can take
All the shit I can take
To push me now is a grand mistake
I've had all the shit I can take

You can only keep things
Chest pain!
Stashed away for so long
Chest pain!

Chest pain!
Chest pain!
Chest pain waltz!
Chest pain!
Chest pain waltz!
