Here we are
God, I need someone to blame
So, here we are
Things will never be the same

Time will heal...
Or so I've heard
Still, here we are
And I'm crying out your name

Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Just breathe...

Here we are
I can sense your smell
So, here we are
I know those hands so well

Life goes on...
Or so I've heard
Still, here we are
And I'm sliding into hell

Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Just breathe...

Here I am
Decades drifted away
So, here I am
The phantom pain seems here to stay

You'll work it out...
Or so I've heard
Still, here I am
And it feels like yesterday

Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Just breathe...
