It's kind of funny in its own little way
The words that you sing and the music you play
Is all a far cry from my company
But you are happy to sell me your integrity

The Mrs. needs a new swimming pool
It's important to make the whole neighborhood drool
Social status is everything
Repeat after me: Mammon is King

I got the rights to you
There's nothing you can do
I got the rights to you, you, you
Rights to you, rights to you, rights to you
I've got the rights to you

Can't take a piss without a written permission
Pay the price for some recognition
To step out of line is no stroll in the park
That pretty little smile is a registered trademark

Your butt is mine until you grow old
The dotted line says you'll do as you're told
Sit! Stand! Bark! Moo like a cow
Rollover! Bend over! You're my product now

I got the rights to you
There's nothing you can do
I got the rights to you, you, you
Rights to you, rights to you, rights to you
I've got the rights to you

I own the rights to you
There's nothing you can do
You're just a pair of jeans
Singing lame evergreens

I got the rights to you
There's nothing you can do
I got the rights to you, you, you

I got the rights to you
There's nothing you can do
I got the rights to you, you, you
Rights to you, rights to you, rights to you
I've got the rights to you
