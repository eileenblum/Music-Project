Hey dude, you used to be fun
Always cool with everyone
I remember, you were like a brother to me

Time flies and we're not the same guys
There's a sinister vibe behind your eyes
That hostility... a spooky fascist tendency

Mind your Mussolini
Mind your Mussolini mind
Mussolini mind

An intelligent man who doesn't belong
Hey dude, where did you turn wrong?
I remember there wasn't a bad bone in your body

Mind your Mussolini
Mind your Mussolini
Mind your Mussolini mind
Mussolini mind

Hey dude, you screwed up your kid
A furious fifteen-year-old on acid
Who'd bash the head in of a passing refugee
To show Il Duce he's worthy...

Mind your Mussolini
Mind your Mussolini
Mind your Mussolini mind
Mussolini mind
