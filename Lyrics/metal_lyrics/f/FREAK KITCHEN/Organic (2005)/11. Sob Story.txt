Would you be my role model?
Would you be my helping hand?
Looking for a soul brother
I need someone to take a stand

Would you be my role model?
Where I trust you and you trust me
But I won't be your sob story
No, I won't be your sob story

My birth was a mistake
I've been told from the beginning
What do you want from me? An apology?

Hooray for parenthood
Guess what? I see right through you
The Carbon Paper Family

Would you be my role model?
Would you be my helping hand?
Looking for a soul brother
I need someone to take a stand

Would you be my role model?
Where I trust you and you trust me
But I won't be your sob story
No, I won't be your sob story

I believe
I believe
There must be something else

I may be your flesh and blood
It means exactly nothing
You're both strangers to me

That's it! I'm done
The Prodigal Son
Lost from Day One

Would you be my role model?
Would you be my helping hand?
Looking for a soul brother
I need someone to take a stand

Would you be my role model?
Where I trust you and you trust me
But I won't be your sob story
No, I won't be your sob story

I believe
I believe
I believe
There must be something else

Won't bother you no more
Go practice Sweet Denial
This wasn't meant to be

I believe
I believe

You could be my role model
You could be my helping hand
Looking for a soul brother
Strong enough to take a stand

You could be my role model
Where I trust you and you trust me
But I won't be your sob story
No, I won't be your sob story
