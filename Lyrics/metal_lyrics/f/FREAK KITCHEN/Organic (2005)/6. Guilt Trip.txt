Real men don't cry
Stand up! Banzai!
God speaks through Dr. Phil and Ted Nugent

Immune to pain
Me Stud, you Jane
Check out my penis enlargement

Watch where I'm going
I'm on a guilt trip
I don't believe you
I don't believe myself

Watch where I'm going
I'm on a guilt trip
I don't trust you
I don't trust myself

Win this, win that
Drink piss, low fat
Viagra and chemical warfare

Full speed ahead
Rest when you're dead
Popcorn, Fox News, Osama's still out there

Watch where I'm going
I'm on a guilt trip
I don't believe you
I don't believe myself

Watch where I'm going
I'm on a guilt trip
I don't trust you
I don't trust myself

Be smart, invest
Go east, go west
