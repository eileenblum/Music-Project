Becky, my Becky, you're one of a kind
I don't understand how you made up your mind
When everyone around you seem to be
A full-blown racist pig

Don't give in! Don't give in!
Don't give in! Don't give in!

Dad keeps on singing the trailer trash blues:
"A good nigger is a dead nigger"
While Mommy hates Jews
Your brother sports a swastika tattoo
And your boyfriend as well

Don't give in! Don't give in!
Don't give in! Don't give in!

Becky, dear Becky
You're the bravest of us all
A tower of courage
Girl, you stand beyond tall
Where does it come from?
Your strength is a solid stone wall
Becky, dear Becky
You're the bravest of us all

Prejudice, ignorance
The whole nine yards
Surrounded by a swarm of wicked retards

All odds against you
Situation no win

Don't give in! Don't give in!
Don't give in! Don't give in!

Becky, dear Becky
You're the bravest of us all
A tower of courage
Girl, you stand beyond tall
Where does it come from?
Your strength is a solid stone wall
Becky, dear Becky
You're the bravest of us all
