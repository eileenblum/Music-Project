Spare me your lame excuses
You think I find it funny? Take another good look
How many times can a person screw things up?
Perhaps you're aiming for that Guinness book?

I'm done covering, it's just embarrassing
To stick your head in the sand won't make it go away
I know you're not dumb yet something clearly is missing
What did the T-shirt say? Same shit, different day...

Wake up brother
There's no other
Than you to clean it up
Wake up brother
There's no other
Than you to clean it up

I don't want to turn my back on you
I'll be the last person to abandon ship
But there's a limit to how far one can carry another
When all you do is slip and slip and slip

No more bull, think a little ahead
Fed up listening to your sorry ass voice
Never thought I'd call you a fool
But these nasty habits of yours leave me no choice

Clean it up (clean it up, clean it up)
Clean it up (clean it up)

Wake up brother
There's no other
Than you to clean it up
Wake up brother
There's no other
Than you to clean it up, to clean it up

Wake up brother
There's no other
Than you to clean it up, come clean
Wake up brother (wake up!)
There's no other
Than you to clean it up, clean it up
Wake up brother
There's no other (clean it up)
Than you to clean it up
Wake up brother
There's no other
Than you

Clean it up
Clean it up
