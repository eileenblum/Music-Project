Transparent, a black hole of emptiness
Expectations that will turn you into a permanent mess

Just drop it
Youâre OK
Youâre OK

Projecting all those failures chokes your energy
Little by little you fade into passivity

Just drop it
Youâre OK
Youâre OK

Youâre OK
Youâre OK
Respect yourself, protect yourself
Respect yourself, protect yourself

Makes me sad to see how desperately you try
It wonât change a single thing as life passes you by

Just drop it
Youâre OK
Youâre, youâre OK

Respect yourself, protect yourself
Respect yourself
Respect yourself, protect yourself
Itâs all OK
Respect yourself, protect yourself
OK, OK

Youâre OK
