Come closer, donât fear me
I need you to be near me
Much closer so you hear me
Come closer
Any chance, One Last Dance?

Another precious day, another precious hour
Another shot of morphine in a life gone sour
It feels like a cruel joke at my expense
Struggle to come to peace while Iâm drowning in turbulence

Come closer, donât fear me
I need you to be near me
Much closer so you hear me
Come closer
Any chance, One Last Dance?

Itâs all so trivial, this whole transfusion thing
Still Iâm checking out âpositiveâ has a funny ring
Would you do me a favor since Iâm running a bit late (running a bit late)
My skin is thick, yet dying is a radical state
Dying is a radical state

Come closer, donât fear me
I need you to be near me
Much closer so you hear me
Come closer
Any chance, One Last Dance?
Any chance, One Last Dance?

Come closer, donât fear me
I need you to be near me
Much closer so you hear me
Come closer, come closer

Any chance of One Last Dance? (Come closer)
Any chance of One Last Dance? (Much closer)
Any chance of One Last Dance? (Come closer)
Any chance of One Last Dance?

One last dance?
One last dance?
Come closer
One last dance?
