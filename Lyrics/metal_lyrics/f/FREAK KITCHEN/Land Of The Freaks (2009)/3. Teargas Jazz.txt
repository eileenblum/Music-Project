We all come down to the Delhi to play freaky music
And check out the vivid scenery
This Danish paper printed explosive cartoons
The Muslim world took quite seriously
Seriously

Provocation or freedom of speech?
The shit had hit the fan and there we were
Donât go out there, youâre oozing Scandinavian
Always trust the wisdom of your local chauffeur

Tandoori stains
Tandoori stains and teargas jazz (ah!)
No, weâre not Danes
No, weâre not Danes, teargas jazz

Teargas jazz
Jazz

Hah!

As pragmatic Vikings we kept a low profile
The mad were mad as only mad can be
We all come down to the Delhi to play freaky music
And check out the vivid scenery

Tandoori stains
Tandoori stains and teargas jazz
No, weâre not Danes
No, weâre not Danes, teargas jazz
Tandoori stains
Tandoori stains and teargas jazz
No, weâre not Danes
No, weâre not Danes, teargas, teargas

Jazz!

Teargas!
Jazz!

Tandoori stains
Tandoori stains and teargas jazz (ah!)
No, weâre not Danes
No, weâre not Danes, teargas jazz
Tandoori stains
Tandoori stains, teargas jazz, hey!
No, weâre not Danes
No, weâre not Danes, no, weâre not Danes, teargas

Jazzâ¦
