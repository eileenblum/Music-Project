Sick!

Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain

Everybody feel sick, everybody complain
Everybody feel sick, is everybody insane?
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel sick

Sick!

You seem perfectly alright to me
Still that headache and twitch tell differently, differently
And that allergy, anxiety and itch on your right knee
Fatal probably

Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain (everybody complain)
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain
Everybody feel sick, is everybody insane?
Everybody feel sick (everybody feel sick)
Sick!

Relax, I am sure you get enough protein
Itâs not likely youâll grow a tumor from bad hygiene
No, itâs not the scariest ingrown toenail I have ever seen
But please put yourself in quarantine (sick, everybody feel pain)
(everybody feel sick, everybody complain)
Put yourself in quarantine (everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain)
What if you get really sick? (everybody feel sick, everybody complain)

Sick? Death by hypochondria
Sick? Death by hypochondria
Death! Sick?

You got nothing to bitch about
Get a little perspective for bacteriaâs sake
Sooner or later we will all reach the end
So give that frantic worrying a break

Death by hypochondria
Death!

Sick? Death by hypochondria
Sick? Death by hypoâ
Sick? Sick?

What if you get really sick?
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain (sick, sick, sick)
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain (sick, sick)
Everybody feel sick, is everybody insane? (is everybody insane, is everybody insane?)
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain
Everybody feel sick, everybody feel pain (everybody, everybody)
Everybody feel sick, everybody complain (everybody)
Everybody feel sick, is everybody insane?
Everybody feel sick (sick? death by hypochondria)
Everybody feel sick (sick?)
Everybody feel sick (sick?)
