Look out gringo!
Here I come now
Priority lane

Me white person
White male person
Top of the food chain

God save the spleen
And Shanghai surgery
God save the spleen
Your kidney belongs to me

It belongs to me
God save the spleen

No moral issues
Itâs you or me, dude
Whistle the organ transplant song (song)

Your government sanctions
Are far beyond tiptop
Is this liver Falun Gong?

From the pharynx and larynx
To your Johnson and your skin
A million Taiwan dollars
Say you canât win

God save the spleen
And Shanghai surgery
God save the spleen
Your kidney belongs to me

It belongs to me
You belong to me

Second grade citizens, prisoners and activists
Sure as hell wonât case me any sleepless nights
Your anatomy fits perfectly
Fuck violations of human rights

Do not hit the waist
The stuff inside is useful!
Be careful with the waist
The stuff inside is useful!
Do not hit the waist!
Be careful with the waist

Itâs harvest time! (itâs harvest time)
Itâs harvest time! (itâs harvest time)
Itâs harvest time!

God save the spleen
And Shanghai surgery (surgery)
God save the spleen (surgery)
Your kidney belongs to me

Belongs, belongs to me
You belong to me!

God save the spleen
