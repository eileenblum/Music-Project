No matter how
We try and try
No matter what
Minutes still fly by
We try so hard
Ain't worth a dime
There is no escape
From the smell of time

The smell of time (the smell of time)
The smell of time

Bingo baby, you just won a Prius
Would you mind filling out the questionnaire?
Someone goes on a phishing trip
Your life savings vaporize into thin air

Masturbation for Dummies
Carrot lover or carnivore?
The political agenda
Is thrown out the mahogany door

No matter how
We try and try
No matter what
Minutes still fly by (fly by)
We try so hard
Ain't worth a dime
There is no escape
From the smell of time

(the smell of time)
The smell of time (the smell of time)

Everyone despises you in the waiting line
And spanking that monkey is such a drag
You can't bring toothpaste on the plane
But we seal your liquor in a special plastic bag

Sure, the furniture's cheap (so cheap)
But someone always has to pay
A Messiah complex the size of a T. Rex can be yours to own today
A Messiah complex the size of a T. Rex can be yours to own today

Besserwissers and assholes take the exit to the left (the exit to the left)
That console gives you arthritis so no more grand auto theft
Climate changes and terrorist threats have become part of everyday life (everyday everyday)
Mow the lawn at any cost while your brother is banging your wife (your brother is banging your wife)

No matter how
We try and try
No matter what
Minutes, minutes still fly by
We try so hard
Ain't worth a dime
There is no escape
From the smell of time

(the smell of time)
The smell of time (the smell of time)
The smell of time (smell it)
