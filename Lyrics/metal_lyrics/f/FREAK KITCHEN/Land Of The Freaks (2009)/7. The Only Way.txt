You should be welcome now to our show today
It's society in a modern way

Follow everything I say
With your safety in mind
Know that we're the only way
To a place where the blind lead the blind

The more I see of life in this special way
Where the will to live breaks down from day to day
The more I'm sure I'm stuck in a big charade
Where everyone is dying to be displayed

And when I'm notified
That they can't understand my mind
'cause there's a doubt

I raise my head up high
I'm breaking out because I know it's right

Follow everything I say
With your safety in mind
Know that we're the only way
To a place where the blind lead the blind

The man behind the mirror hides the truth
Well, it's always been like that
The man behind the mirror hides the truth

Follow everything I say
With your safety in mind
Know that we're the only way
To a place where the blind lead the blind
Follow everything I say
With your safety in mind
Know that we're the only way
To a place where the blind lead the blind
Follow everything I say
With your safety in mind
Know that we're the only way
