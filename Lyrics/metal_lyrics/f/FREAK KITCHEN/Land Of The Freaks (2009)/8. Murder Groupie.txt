Be my
Be my murâ
Be my murder
Be my murder grouâ
Be my murder groupie

All those letters of yours make me feel less lonely
Youâve simply got to believe youâre my one and only

My puppy eyes will make you take the bait
If you love me you will help set things straight

Be my murder groupie
Be my murder groupie

Your support and affection mean the world to me
I need your trust desperately

That shallow life of yours could stand a thrill
If you love me, then, precious, kill you will

You want a change, youâre feeling stuck (be my)
An easy prey, a sitting duck
Your resistance is nil

I read you like an open book (be my)
If you love me, then, precious
Kill you will

Ah, be
Be my
Be my murâ
Be my murder
Be my murder grouâ
Be my murder groupie

You want a change, youâre feeling stuck
An easy prey, a sitting duck
Your resistance is nil

I read you like an open book
If you love me, then, precious
Kill you will
