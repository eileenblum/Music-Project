Step up now indifferent one
Let's some real work done

Everything is changing
No matter what you do
Holler all toy want
We are many against few
Give me no excuses
It's time to make a stand
Choose a side...

Or join the ranks
The ranks of the terrified
Join the ranks
The ranks of the terrified

Your silence derives from fear
Being "neutral" is no option here

Bailing out is not OK
It's too convenient to look the other way
