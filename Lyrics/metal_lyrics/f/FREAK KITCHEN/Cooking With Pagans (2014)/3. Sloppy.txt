Bleeding information in every move you make
You're not alone anymore

Big brother is watching
Like he never watched before

Who are these people violating your life
And what gives them right?

Airstrip One has been way surpassed
And no one gives a shite

Sloppy
I am getting sloppy
You're getting sloppy
We're getting sloppy

Target of interest? Too bad for you
There is not recovery

From the 24/7 Orwellian
Mass surveilance machinery

It's all for the "greater good"
So we are doing as we're told

The truth of the matter is that everyone
Is being seriously cornholed

Sloppy
I am getting sloppy
You're getting sloppy
We're getting sloppy

Deaf, dumb, blind
We're getting sloppy
