Hide...while you complaint about the Wi-Fi
Hide...to keep a fraction of sanity
Hide...that soul needs some sixteen stitches
Hide...or be damaged permanently

So I hide
So I hide
Yes I hide
So I hide

Hide...from text messaging inferno
Hide...from the white noise deafening me
Tried to bang my bone head bloody
Against the hulking walls of stupidity

So I hide
So I hide
Yes I hide
So I hide

Hide...we could hide ourselves together
Hide...and we can struggle to get real

So we hide
Yes we hide
So we hide
