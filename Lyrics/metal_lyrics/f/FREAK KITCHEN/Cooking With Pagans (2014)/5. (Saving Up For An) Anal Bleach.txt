Shit! I'm low an battery
iPad parent, shame on me
Pierce my eye and dream about
A testicle tattoo

Need more gadgets to decorate
Frame my shallow, sorry state
I so want my asshole to be
Pretty just for you

I'm saving up!
I'm saving up!
I'm saving up!
Saving up for an anal bleach

Happiness is a friend request
Jerk off to a binary breast
Oops, my youngest may have drowned
While I deleted spam

Tweet, tweet all day long
Desperate to belong
I am not sure I even do exist
If it ain't on Instagram

I'm saving up!
I'm saving up!
I'm saving up!
Saving up for an anal bleach

Content? Substance? Who gives a crap?
When you can download another app
Into a reservoir of nothingness
Browse until we drop

Twinkle, twinkle little star
Can you see how fucked up we are?
Everything is not enough
And we never, ever stop
