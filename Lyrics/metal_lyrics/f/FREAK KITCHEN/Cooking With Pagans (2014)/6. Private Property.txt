Building higher fences just to keep me sane
I won't let nobody enter my domain
I've got my own place now, this is what I need
A solitary soul that I have to feed

How did I get here, the damage is done
Believed in the market, the greedy has won

I've got what is mine, and you've got yours
I will break you down with no remorse
If you could you surely would do the same to me
I've got what is mine and you've got yours
My private property

The daily grinf assembly line, you're nothing but a fool
I'm the most important, from high above I rule
Healthy and productive, words become the law
Imprinted since I was a child, standing here in awe

How did I get here, the damage is done
Believed in the market, the greedy has won

I've got what is mine, and you've got yours
I will break you down with no remorse
If you could you surely would do the same to me
I've got what is mine and you've got yours
My private property
