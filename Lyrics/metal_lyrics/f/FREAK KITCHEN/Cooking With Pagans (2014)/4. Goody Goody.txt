So you met someone who set you back on your heels
Goody, goody
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
Goody, goody
So you gave him your heart to
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
And now how do you do

So you lie awake just singing the blues all night
Goody, goody
So you think that love is a barrel of dynamite
Goody, goody
Hooray and Hallelujah, you had it coming to ya
Goody, goody for him, goody goody for me
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you!
