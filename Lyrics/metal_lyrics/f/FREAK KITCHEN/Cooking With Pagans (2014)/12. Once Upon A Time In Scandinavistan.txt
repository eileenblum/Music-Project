Once upon a time in Scandinavistan

Grumpy, tired with eyes blood red
Take a breath as the therapist said

Bingo-playing sex-workers and curry ooze
A molotov cocktail of venereal blues

Kama sutra and decomposing seaweed stew
Diastolic blood pressure higher than the IQ

Shaking, starving, running out of juice
Better stop by the tandoori moose

Once upon a time in Scandinavistan

Illegal propaganda transmission from a submarine
Get your head smashed by a feminist teen

A public intelligence Officer too tired to be afraid
As the anti-socials are gearing up for the parade

Colonial law states it's an utter disgrace
Committing Nuisance in a public place

Vomit, drunkenness and potent fury
There is no cure for the muddy streets of Gautampuri

Once upon a time in Scandinavistan

Wear helmet!!
Head is not replaceable
Wear helmet!!
Head is not replaceable
Wear helmet!!
Head is not replaceable

Only one head per lifetime...
