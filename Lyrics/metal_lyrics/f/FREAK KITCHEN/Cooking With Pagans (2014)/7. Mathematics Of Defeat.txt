This ain't no damn swan song
Yet I am deeply fascinated by
The slow decay and the sound of the lifecycle gong
You simply can't win no matter what you try

I don't understand what is up with my feet
I used to have the groove, now I can't find the beat
There's a time and place for us all to retreat
It's the simple mathematics of defeat

Seize the day is a good way to start
You know those clichÃ©d carpe diem rants
Stitch me up as I'm falling apart
Did I just piss my pants?

I don't understand what is up with my feet
I used to have the groove, now I can't find the beat
There's a time and place for us all to retreat
It's the simple mathematics of defeat
