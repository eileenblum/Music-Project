Where am I? Where are you?
Have I been here before?

It's spinning so fast now
I can't keep up no more

Life will kill you
And there's no one
You can call for professional help

I ponder and I wonder
What if it ends right here

Slipping into a neurosis
As I try to cope with fear

I need to believe in
That soul and karma jive

Can't help it, but it seems like
No one gets you alive

Life will kill you
And there's no one
You can call for professional help

Sure, the meaning of it all
Is a mayor nut to crack

But you promised, reassured me
I want my money back

Life will kill you
And there's no one
You can call for professional help
