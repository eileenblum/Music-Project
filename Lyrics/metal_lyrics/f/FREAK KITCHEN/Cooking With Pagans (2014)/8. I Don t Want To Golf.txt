You reached a certain age and the panic's kicking you
Stuck in that bunker, running out time
Suddlenly aware of your own mortality

When that career isn't exactly a hole in one
What you wouldn't do for a tiny slice of success
To boost that place in the bourgeois hierarchy

I ain't you bro
I don't wanna golf
Bad for mojo
I don't wanna golf
Forever no
I don't wanna golf

The symbolism of another shit-expensive club
Perhaps the Maruman Majerty Prestigio Driver?
And yet you never hit the ball
And you most likely never wil...

I ain't you bro
I don't wanna golf
Bad for mojo
I don't wanna golf
Forever no
I don't wanna golf

Fire the caddie
Take it out on the wife
Thank yout mom and daddy
For your miserable life

I ain't you bro
I don't wanna golf
Bad for mojo
I don't wanna golf
Forever no
I don't wanna golf
