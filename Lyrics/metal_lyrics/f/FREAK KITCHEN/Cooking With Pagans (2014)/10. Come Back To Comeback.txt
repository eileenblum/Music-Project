Bury the hatchet, put you differences aside
We don't care who picked the initial fight

The music of today ain't worth a damn
Please, won't you reunite?

Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback
Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback

We're desperate to buy overpriced tickets
For yet another farewell tour

Nostalgia was so much better before...

Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback
Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback

Your legenday look and your trademark pose
Used to be sublime

Dye your streaks of grey, burn that fat away
Let's pretend you're in your prime

Another compilation with the same old tunes
Remastered for the zillionth time

Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback
Come back! Come back! Come back to comeback
