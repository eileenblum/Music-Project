Running through the night
I see shadows from behind
Something's closing in
Playing tricks with my mind

Electric touch sends icy shivers
Right down my spine
I hit the ground with a thunder sound
To the mistress of the night!
Ascending here to the atmosphere
I'm opening my eyes
Riding this metal machine
I feel the grip of vice

She takes me in to this Place of Sin
Leaving saints outside
My lust is strong, it won't last long
I'm gonna make her whine

Time after time, you did your crime
And earned your fame
But I can see right through all this devil's game
And when I'm done, she gives me
Pleasure spiked with pain
And we race on  into the night

Chase goes on 'till the break of dawn
Power burning up
Ramming hard, moaning loud
This race will never stop

Strive to hold this heavy load
Pressure rising high
Bursting white, like a dynamite
I press her to the ground

Time after time, you did your crime
And earned your fame
But I can see right through all this devil's game
And when I'm done, she gives me
Pleasure spiked with pain

I'm living for
Flesh &amp; Blood
Flesh &amp; Blood (uh baby)
Flesh &amp; Blood (you've got that)
Flesh &amp; Blood (I don't want your)
Flesh &amp; Blood

Running through the night
Metal shining bright
Flesh &amp; Blood!
