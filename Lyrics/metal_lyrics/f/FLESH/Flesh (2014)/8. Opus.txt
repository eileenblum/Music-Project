Standing in the shadows
Put on heavy ordeal
Rust carved into Flesh and bone
There is nothing I could feel

The seasons changed
and memories fade away
But the northern wind
Carries your voice to this day

Tonight, I'll break the chains of this illusion
Your gaze will rescue me from this evil spell

For so long I've been waiting
Waiting for you to come
Now the stars are aligning
Vile magic soon undone

Tonight, I'll break the chains of this illusion
Your gaze will rescue me from this evil spell
Tonight, We'll break the chains of this illusion
Your gaze will rescue me from this spirit spell

We sail on savage winds
Delivering doom and thunder
Death echoes from galaxies afar
Blood crescent rising
Red glow reveals the way
Our flight goes on through countless days

Together my love, we'll roam the open land
United again, victory at hand
As hour draws near, we will break the spell
Riding on, return to forever

As time is running out, frozen to the core
Sun and moon join together for the end

On dark horizon a beam of lightShines on the dead
Leaving me again alone Forevermore

Together my love, we'll roam the open land
United again, victory at hand
As hour draws near, we will break the spell
Riding on, return to forever

For so long I've been waiting
Waiting for you to come
Now the stars are aligning
Vile magic soon undone
