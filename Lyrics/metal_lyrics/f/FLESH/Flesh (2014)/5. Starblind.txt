Surrounded, in a spectral haze
Lost within space and time
I see the light of a thousand stars pass by
Closing in for my soulblight

Eerie visions, they 're calling
for my name

This barren soul lies empty
Bearing memories of gold
It stares at the stars at night
In bleeding pain
For so long

This sacred bond now past
Turns into bitter hate
Wasted all your time
On a life you never had

Standing the test of time
Together we'll ride again
This journey has come to an end
The fire is dying out

The road is long and winding
Darkness eating the sun
Forever it will keep on fighting
In spite of pain, agony and sin

This sacred bond now past
Turns into bitter hate
Wasted all your time
On a life you never had

Standing the test of time
Together we'll ride again
This journey has come to an end
The fire is dying out

Look what you've done, you ain't the same
Again alone, no stranger to blame
The need is strong, it swallows your life
The hunger aches, it cuts like a knife
