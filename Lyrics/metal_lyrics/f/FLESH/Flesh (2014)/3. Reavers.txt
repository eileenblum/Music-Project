Standing on the outside
Feel the gathering heavy rain
Danger arriving
A word of warning I know

They're here to stop us
They're here to drag us down just wait
Just wait and see

They reign in power
Worlds they devour
To the end of time
Shadows in the night

The strike of a moment
The shot from a gun
The heat of the fire
But nowhere near the sun

The battle rages on
Till the break of dawn
Black fire burning home
Of origin unknown
The end is near we're not feeling any fear
Stand fast, Reaver from the void

A beast in black is waiting
To do it's evil deed
A flash of lightning
A metal star is rising

A surge of power
Display of might
Into the fire
But nowhere near the sun

The battle rages on
Till the break of dawn
Black fire burning home
Of origin unknown
The end is near we're not feeling any fear
Stand fast, Reavers from the void

Dreadful scream, an echo in the wind
It's a sign of a bloody war
Burning waste is what they leave behind
We stand and fight, the end is nigh
The end is nigh!

The strike of a moment
The shot from a gun
The heat of the fire
But nowhere near the sun
