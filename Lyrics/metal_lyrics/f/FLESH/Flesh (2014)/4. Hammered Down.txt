In the break of the morning
Sirens sound the fight
I've been waiting for you
Waiting all through the night

Your bastard smile will be the last 
you'll ever take
Now better get ready, soon 
you'll meet your fate

This sinister lies have brought you
Down close to the wall
Now cornered up, you've got
Nowhere to hide nowhere to go
In blood you'll pay, the price is
up too long
Tonight I'll Hammer you Down

If you see me coming
Start running hard and swift
When I rip your tongue out
You'll find silence is a precious gift

You'll rue the day when 
You spread falsehood and deceit
Next time think twice or I'll come
Hunting for your meat
