Out of the cellar
And into the streets
We're vermin rising
Devouring the meek
In hunt for the skins
And the scalps of the pigs
Black swarms of terror
Takin' the lead

We eat your entrails bite by bite!
We feast on soft Flesh nite by nite!

We're Vermin Terror, and soon you will die
We're Vermin Terror, we spread like plague
Throughout the land

You steal from the poor
And feed on the fat
Obese lying bastards
Malicious snakes
Your vicious agenda
Is ruling the world,
But foundations are shaking
The rise of the Rat!

We eat your entrails bite by bite!
We feast on soft Flesh nite by nite!

We're Vermin Terror, and soon you will die
We're Vermin Terror, we spread like plague
Throughout the land
