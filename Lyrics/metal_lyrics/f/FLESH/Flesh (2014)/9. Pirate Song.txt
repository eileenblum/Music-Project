Thursday night, going out
I've been waitin' all week to scream and shout
Takin' my leather, smashing the door
Mom's crying, "please don't drink no more"
Bottle or two, brandy on wine
By the time I'm back, I'll be shitfaced fine
Night in the City, I'm in trance
Me and the boys heading straight to the Place!

In the pit, mp3 blasting loud
As time goes by, the bigger the crowd
Dudes come, dudes go,
Funny faces we don't know
Vegetable people lurking around,
No wonder roaches can be found
Smelly ol' hobo living near,
Cashing change on our plastic beer!
