Heading south, through plains of despair
I've found a place, mortals beware

Possessed by demons, forces of old
Heading south, blood's turning cold

I feel sadness,misery and pain
Crossing the deep river of flame
The black bridge of death
Through gates of hell
Lies the Cathedral, once sacred place

Once sacred place, Heaven in black
The Cathedral

Before the entrance stands a priest full of grief
He feels so desperate, he can't find relief
Cold doors of steel are covered in blood
Flesh was sacrificed for the demented god
Inside the Cathedral everything seems so unreal
A council of bishops with satan strike a deal
Halls are guarded by the legions of the dead
Endless suffering is their only fate.

The quest is over, salvation at hand
The beast is banished by metal command
Atop the altair, spirits are free
Heavy is the load, ofa demon in me

The demon in me, Heaven is south
The Cathedral
