Rockin' steady, rock you right
Livin' ain't easy, day and all night
Sometimes it's hard to keep control
Fighting your mind and fighting your soul
Pushing badly, standin' tough
Stuff won't change, it just gets rough
Out of rhytm, losing control
Once you go down
you've gotta hit back the road

You know you got it, if it makes you feel good
Easy Rider, Heavy Striker
You know you got it, if it makes you feel right
Easy Rider, Heavy Striker

When time is right, take what is yours
Stay fast and heavy, an' that's how it goes
Don't ever let 'em bring you down
Don't let'em keep you runnin' round 'n' round
From the bottom, straight to the top
Take your chances, don't you ever stop
Keep your rhytm pounding and strong
This way you'll never ever be wrong

You know you got it, if it makes you feel good
Easy Rider, Heavy Striker
You know you got it, if it makes you feel right
Easy Rider, Heavy Striker
