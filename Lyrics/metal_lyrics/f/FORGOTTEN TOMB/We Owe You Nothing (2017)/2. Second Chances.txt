Touch my skin, kiss my flesh
Hold my body, fuck me, love me
I won't be here anymore
I'm going to ship into the night
And disappear for good everyone's sight
Failed at seeing the bigger picture
Failed at seeing the master plan
Should have gone into that wreck
I had a glimpse of how things could have been
I have a proof of how things will never be
Pathetic as life's always been
Second chances ran into the ground
Crashing hard against reality
Broken bones, broken dreams, broken hopes
Predictability of failures
Alive to see the horror
Of another worthless day
From where do you start again
When all you believe breaks down?
Why should I restart again
Since all my world crumbled down?
I'm running my fucking life into the ground
I'm running this fucking life into the ground
I had a glimpse of how things could have been
I have a proof of how things will never be
Pathetic as life's always been
Second chances ran into the ground
