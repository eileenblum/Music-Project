Broken, burned-out
Left exiled
Cutting short the affliction
Wish to expire
Corruption of all beauty
I embrace dismay
Compelling hurtful sight
I'm just longing for decay
Constant torture
Twist the knife
Spitting on a mirror
A shattered life
World keeps turning
I rot away
Drowning into suffering
I'm just longing for decay
No redemption
Falling from grace
Degenerative sickness
Pain on replay
Desolation
In the heat of these nights
Sleeping 'til late
Avoiding daylight
Running straight towards
All thing that I fear
Abusing constantly
My mind's so unclear
Void and misery
Is all I've got left
Wine and spirits
Help me endure this unrest
I'm just longing for decay
I'm just longing for decay
