Expectations bound to fail
You're at lost a loss for words
Dismissing daydreams overnight
All warnings end unheard
There is nothing left to say
Broken lives and broken dreams
A whirlwind of defeat
When doubts are really what they seem
And lack of trust just takes front seat
Tragedy approaches near
Projects for life now disappear
There's nothing or no one to hold dear
You're in for a new worthless, wasted year
Time heals nothing
Here comes the pain
Life or die, love or hate
It's just the same
It's just the same
There's no redemption
Just disappear
Abandon everything, the end's approaching near
Your own self's the one to fear
Take the failure like a man
There's nothing else to do
To wish some wounds would heal again
'Til reality comes through
Popping pills to sleep at night
When past joys pass before your eyes
Too tired to reach tomorrow alive
Another drop before you die
Meaning of life slips through your fingers
Feeling such a wreck
The will to end it all still lingers
A weight upon your back
Family dreams burn in flames
All smiling faces drive you insane
Alone the whole time, rot in despair
This life just led you to your own death chair
Time heals nothing
Here comes the pain
Life or die, love or hate
It's just the same
It's just the same
There's no redemption
Just disappear
Abandon everything, the end's approaching near
