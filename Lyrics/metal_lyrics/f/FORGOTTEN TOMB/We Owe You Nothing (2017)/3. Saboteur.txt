Eyes stretched towards the ceiling
White null ensues
Blank face to disguise my hurt
I find myself up to this shit again
I shut the door and lost my nerve (Up to my shit again)
You're pulled the strings that struck a nerve
You're sabotaging me again
You're pulled the strings that struck a nerve
You're sabotaging me again
Framed by confusion, disillusion
A light that drove me blind
We crossed the finish line with no winners
And found out we all lost
I shut the door and lost my nerve (Up to my shit again)
You're pulled the strings that struck a nerve
You're sabotaging me again
I shut the door and lost my nerve (Up to my shit again)
You're pulled the strings that struck a nerve (Up to your shit again)
I pray for sleep and close my sight
I pray for sleep and die inside
I pray for sleep and close my sight (I pray for sleep and die inside)
Been fooled again by this mirage (I scream sabotage)
