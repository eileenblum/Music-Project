On the path to darkness, the darkness of this nights
Through the fog we're dressed with our black robes
Silence... The wolves will lead us
towards the place of nightmares...

A deserted house stand beyond the ancient cemetary
We coven inside the dark place
The pale walls of the crypt
now are lightened by black candles...
The medium begun the invocation...

"Invoco animas veterum mortuorum
In nomine dilapsorum nobis ostendete verum
Volumus ex novo vivere fines vestram.
Animae mortuorum audite hanc revocationen,
dicete nobis de tenebris que post mortem sunt
Nobis revelate horridum abyssum mortis..."

We want to know

Lugubrious moans comes from the near cemetary
Your cryptic voices whisper
with the stenching breath of Death...

"Redite per clathros vita e post mortem."

Tonight the sky is darkened than ever,
as tormented souls tell the occult secrets...
Obscura Arcana Mortis
Morte
