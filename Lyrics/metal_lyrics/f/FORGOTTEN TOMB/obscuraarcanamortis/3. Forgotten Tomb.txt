Let me die alone in darkness,
shunned by the light
Misanthropic death,
ignore the past life

No more visions of tomorrow
Dreaming the Death,
a tomb in the fog
A cold tombstone
forgotten by everyone

Forgotten Tomb

Leave me alone
Let me follow the path to nothing
Through the lands of inhumanity i wander
The black candle light has closed,
I can see the blackened beauty of Death
Forget me, I'll miss myself in the void

Forgotten Tomb...

I am alone now,
only the dark listen to my words
Forget me
