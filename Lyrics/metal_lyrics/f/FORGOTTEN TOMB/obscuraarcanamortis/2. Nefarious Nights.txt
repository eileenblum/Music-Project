Nefarious nights, a time so far,
ancestral fears and nightmares
From the darkened clouds of the past
memories of souls without rest...

Pray your lord to reach another dawn
(The) Darkness takes away our mortal life
They' ve come back with these obscure nights

The moon appears through the fog
which flattens over the bog
Lock yourself inside your fragile home
close all lights and hope they don't come

Nefarious... Nights
Nefarious... Nights

I observe sinister moors
Through the grip of winter
I walk towards the endless dark
As legends return to take
other lives into their funeral drape
Nefarious Nights...

"Rediverunt nobis.
Tempus est solvere debitum sanguinis.
Deum benedictat nos omnes."

A funeral procession through the night
takes the caskets of the dead to the cemetary
They burn their coffins to purify the souls
then pray the Lord to be forgiven

Population now has payed the dues
The cold winds take away the nefarious nights
