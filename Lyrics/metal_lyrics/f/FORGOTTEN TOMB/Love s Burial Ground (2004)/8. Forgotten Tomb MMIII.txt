Let me die alone in darkness 
Shunned by the light 
Misanthropic death 
Ignore the past life 

No more visions of tomorrow 
Dreaming the death - A tomb in the fog 
A cold tombstone 
Forgotten by everyone 

FORGOTTEN TOMB 

Leave me alone - Let me follow the path to nothing 
Through the Lands of Inhumanity I'll wander 
The black candle light is dying (out) 
I can see the blackened beauty of death 
Forget me - I'll miss myself in the void 

FORGOTTEN TOMB 

I am alone now 
Only the dark listens to my words 
Forget me
