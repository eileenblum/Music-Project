Thought I dreamed it again, the place where I constantly wander 
So far and wrapped in darkness 
It stands as the incarnation of my obsessions 

My soul is keaving my body once more 
As I enter those wretched ancient walls 
Corridors of post-mortem existence 
I breathe the evilness of dark deserted rooms 

Tears falling from my eyes as I walk towars the stairs 
Haunted by something I can't perceive 
A house built on my utter negativity 

Last visions of a fullmoon, the frozen nighttime wind 
I lose myself through those endless dungeons 

Take me away, take me there where I'm born 
Embrace me in your inhuman angst 

The smell of distant places in my dreams 
Nostalgia, take me home...
