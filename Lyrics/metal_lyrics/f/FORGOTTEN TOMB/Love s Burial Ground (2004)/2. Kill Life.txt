Die for me - I'll swallow all your pain 
Kill me - Release me from this strain 
Feel it - You are going to be forgotten 
Taste it - The hand of unforgiveness 

I injure myself 
Searching for a way out 
In my eyes you see 
The horror of being alive 

Cry for me - I need this pain to live 
Hate me - I feed on your own sickness 
Breathe it - The stench of self-destruction 
Love it - It's the only thing that's left to you 

I watch my blood flowing out 
You feel your tears running down 
Hold my wounded flesh now 
I'm the last thing you crave for 

Life is pain 
We're doomed to destroy another one 
Who stands in our way 
'cause we were born under a cursed star 

You wanted to suffer 
But I need a last relief 
I need to bleed 
I need to kill life 

I need to kill life
