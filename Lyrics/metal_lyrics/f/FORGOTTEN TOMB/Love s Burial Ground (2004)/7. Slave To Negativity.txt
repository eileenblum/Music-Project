Froten and still I stand 
Through these rooms of emptiness 
The void in my hands once more 
Awaken to see another day of greyness 

Armless and numb 
All emotions now are gone 
I burn another page 
From the book of my memories 

The way I follow has no return 
I'll face this journey alone 
In every night and in every breath 
You'll drown in the wastelands of my soul 

No other words are left 
No reasons to explain 
My scorn as a farewell message 
Only silence now remains 

Negativity 
Surround me in Your cold dead embrace 
Rape my spirit with Your divine sickness 

Blind is my soul, I sold You my life 
My faith shines in every wound 
Fanatical cynicism leads my way now 
We're nothing but tools under Your eternal spell 

My true belief - 
Slave to Negativity
