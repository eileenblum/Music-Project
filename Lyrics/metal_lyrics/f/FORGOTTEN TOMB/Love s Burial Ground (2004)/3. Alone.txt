Once again life is killing me 
This time I know there's no way back 
Left alone, abandoned 
Without any chance in tomorrow 

You're gone forever 
As I try to find a reason for this 
Endlessly wondering why 
You burned away all I was living for 

Remembrances are all I still own of you 
As I lie in my bed, drunk, confused 
Flashes of our past passing before my eyes 
Just like dying, endlessly dreaming of you 

Dreaming of forgotten words and smiles 
Trying to push away the need to harm myself 
I feel is growing deep inside of me 
I feel I will have to carve this pain upon my skin 

Loneliness arises from the past 
I will not bear this torment longer 
As I try to hide the painful tears
Frustration increases in my soul

Reminding when I felt so high
Feeling nausea in my lungs, suffering
I try to sleep to heal this madness
But this bed now seems to be like my tomb 

Now I know it's all too late to save me 
I keep on dreaming of past years 
I can't feel that warmth anymore 
You turned my existence in a terminal disease 

I know all I once called life ends today 
As you disappear forever, flying far away 
All emotions inside of me are dead and gone 
I can't stand this silence, but now I'm alone 
I'm alone 

Where have you gone when I needed you? 
Never again
