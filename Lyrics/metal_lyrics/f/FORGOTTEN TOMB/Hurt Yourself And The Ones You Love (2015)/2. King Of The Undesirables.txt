I am the king of kings
I rule this hell circle
King of the undesirable ones

I am the king of kings
I rule these corrupted children
King of the undesirable ones

Face down deep in shit
A generation doomed by their own old ones
Or just by their own lack of self-respect
I am the vulture who feeds
On hatred and self-harm
Unfit for social needs
I lead a sickening breed

Corruption - Disruption
Subversion of the righteous
Onwards to deconstruction
I am the fuel for riots

I am the king of nothing, therefore the king of kings
I rule a place where feeling numb and void is all that means
I am the king of nothing, therefore the king of kings
Born to be undesirable, let the apocalypse begin

I am the king of kings
I rule these stillborn
King of the undesirable ones

A legion without empathy
We hate each other and it's right
We share no ideologies
We aren't brothers, we just hate this life
I long for chaos, I long for death
I pray for white to fade to black
I came to train the mob
Kill, rape, pillage and rob

Corruption - Disruption
Subversion of the righteous
Onwards to deconstruction
I am the fuel for riots

I am the king of nothing, therefore the king of kings
I rule a place where feeling numb and void is all that means
I am the king of nothing, therefore the king of kings
Born to be undesirable, let the apocalypse begin

I am the king of nothing, therefore the king of kings
