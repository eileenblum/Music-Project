The will to hurt and deny
The will to watch you cry
The will to make someone die
The will to hurt and deny
The will to embrace your own end
The will to betray your friend
The will to lie and pretend
The will to embrace your own end

There is nothing and no one there
Cherish the end
There is nothing and no one there
Cherish the end
To hurt yourself and the ones you love
There is no one to hold dear
Only death above

The will to inflict my own pain
The will to drive you insane
The wiill to play my own game
The will to inflict my own pain
The will to carve up your smile
The will to walk my green mile
The will to gouge out your eyes
The will to carve up your smile

There is nothing and no one there
Cherish the end
There is nothing and no one there
Cherish the end
To hurt yourself and the ones you love
There is no one to hold dear
Only death above
