Graveyard dirt and filth in piles
I'm the blind who leads the blind men down
Despise the icons, crush reality and drag to my hell all your smiles
Old dog, I lead the wolfpack on a trail of pain, drive you insane
The best has yet to come, you're never to be heard or seen again

Got what it takes to mislead the snakes
Your poison fails cause l feast on your mistakes

Retribution day, these fools complain but they all know my name
I don't know yours cause you're no one and you've got just yourself to blame
Recurring task on my agenda since 16 years: bring you to tears
I'm feeding on your hatred, you should be aware that you hate what you fear

Got what it takes to mislead the snakes
Your poison fails cause I feast on your mistakes

Mislead the snakes

Watch all our worlds collide
Some rules 1 can't abide
I represent the end
You're joining your dead friends

Got what it takes to mislead the snakes
Your poison fails cause I feast on your mistakes

We're hellhounds on your trail
Now watch your dreams turn pale and fail
A broken toy you can't repair
Like snakes afraid of fire you all slither away

Slither away
Snakes shall slither away
