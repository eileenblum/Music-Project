I'm lying here as I listen to the deafening sound
Of all regrets and of the hopes of youth being buried down
A mental vortex where emotionless I'm flowing free
I feel like I was gone long time ago, nothing more to see

My days have turned to blank lies
Asleep with 2 coins on my eyes
When nights became an old weeping blues
What would you do when had dreams come true?

Degeneration of all state of affairs
I know too well how it feels, I couldn't fly, I climb a thousand stairs
Sometimes I dream to travel back to times when I was young
So I could enter high school with a gun and shoot down everyone

Your days will turn to blank lies
Asleep with 2 coins on your eyes
When nights have turned to an old weeping blues
What will you do when bad dreams come true?

Expectations of loved ones, friends and society shattered to pieces
My mercy is the opposite of all that you mean with your blind worship and teachings
Your children will rise and get rid of your delusional ways of deceit
Like sheep led to slaughter you'll perish and we'll use your blood to write on the walls:

Dead
Dead
Dead
All pigs are dead
I know the sickness I achieved cannot be undone
I glorify the horror of it all, the monster I've become
The demise of your well-being is my reason to breathe
I'll ruin your progeny, the only promise I can keep

Your days will turn to blank lies
Asleep with 2 coins on your eyes
When nights have turned to an old weeping blues
What will you do when bad dreams come true?
