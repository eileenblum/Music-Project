An endless descent into my personal darkness
Longing for nonexistence, slowly holding my breath
Down down down â So fucked up and so careless
Feeling so close to the end of this journey into cold death

Deprive me â Pave the way for my demise
Deprive me â I will miss the morning rise
Deprive me â Cut me down, close my eyes
Deprive me â To deny the gift of life

This torment so tempting, the path of the joyless
I took all my love and turned it into my own curse
Rape my innocence, rip me apart, leave me heartless
The only place I fit in is into my own hearse

Deprive me â Pave the way for my demise
Deprive me â I will miss the morning rise
Deprive me â Cut me down, close my eyes
Deprive me â To deny the gift of life

Deprived

Useless strains of sorry lies
Worthless days, worthless nights

Deprive me â Kill my chances to survive
Deprive me â Through black waters let me dive
Deprive me â Waste my will to be alive
Deprive me â Take away what I despise
