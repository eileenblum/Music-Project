Itâs like if the suffering of this world 
runs into my veins
Broken dreams and wasted lives
The solitude of a million souls

Poisoning my blood, carved upon my skin
But when you think that I might care, youâre so damn wrong

I wish you could live on your flesh
The pain that Iâve been through
The denial of emotions
Euthanasia of all sweetness
Aborted happiness, my heart a shallow grave

Lack of redemption, my only prize
If only you could see the hell which lies 
behind my eyes

You would
 Love me like youâd love the death
Like if youâre loving Death itself

Love me like youâd love the death
Weâre going six feet under
Still divided as weâve always been

A chronic lack of trust in life
What else could you expect?
Everything deserves to be gone
I chose to run towards the end

Be a martyr or be a hangman
Two different ways to fail at life
I know exactly whatâs wrong for me
But temptation comes my way 

Over and over again
A tragedy I could foresee
An omen so predictable
My self-inflicted punishment
Murdered serenity, my heartâs a graveyard

Now â Itâs far too late to make amends
Fuck me like youâd fuck a man that soon will end up dead

Love me like youâd love the death
Like if youâre loving Death itself

Love me like youâd love the death
Weâre going six feet under
Still divided as weâve always been

Love me like youâd love the death
Love me like youâd love the death
Love me like youâd love the death
Fuck me like if youâre fucking Death itself.
