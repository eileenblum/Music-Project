Everlasting cycle of pain
Reciprocal failure, our terminal game
You know, weâre born with a birth defect
We only share feelings in our longing for death

One more step towards the end
Only while dying weâre gonna hold out our hands
Youâll slit my fucking throat
Iâll kick your chair so you can swing from your rope

Letâs burn together, letâs start our strife
Letâs dig our fucking graves, letâs waste our lives

This angst keeps us alive
Letâs torture each other
Like a splinter in our eyes
Letâs torture each other
Please feed from my disease
Letâs torture each other
Weâll end up on our knees
Letâs torture each other

A will to disappear
No more life means no more fear
This cruelty, our addiction
Weâll share the nails for our crucifixion

Like heroin in our veins
Our pleasure in suffering will drive us insane
Strung out, I need a final injection
Iâll overdose on my own self-destruction

Letâs burn together, letâs blind our sight
Letâs get to the bitter end, letâs fuck up our lives

This angst keeps us alive
Letâs torture each other
Like a splinter in our eyes
Letâs torture each other
Please feed from my disease
Letâs torture each other
Weâll end up on our knees
Letâs torture each other

Thereâs no compassion in the way we live
A selfish constant search for all the kicks we need
I donât want to be saved, you got it all wrong
I want us to share our grave
The only place we belong 

This angst keeps us alive
Letâs torture each other
Like a splinter in our eyes
Letâs torture each other
Please feed from my disease
Letâs torture each other
Weâll end up on our knees
Letâs torture each other
