Lead us into temptation
We are nothing but tools
To embrace the enlightenment of depravity
Take our souls, take our lives, take everything from us

Mother â Who art in the depths
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth 
As it is in death
And donât deliver us from evil

A will to do harm
To ourselves and to all lives that weâll cross
We chose a path with no way back
Let us touch the ecstasy of iniquity

Mother â Who art in the depths
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth 
As it is in death
And donât deliver us from evil

In the name of everything thatâs foul
We glorify our will to destroy
No flesh shall be spared
Join us in the light of Negativity

Join us
