Waging the war of nerves again
The silence of the ones who failed

Iâm craving for isolation
A way to stop the screams in my head
My reflection shows me
A man battered by this life of neglect

I donât feel like rising up again
Standing frozen, idle in my longing for the end

Pills to ignore the pain
Booze to numb the senses
Smoke to fall asleep
I donât fucking care about your help

Pills to ignore the pain
Booze to numb the senses
Smoke to fall asleep
I donât fucking care, I feel adrift

Deprive me of all self-esteem
Iâm guilty of inducing my demise

My health has went to pieces
My joy rots somewhere deep inside
Your judgement wonât affect me
I already sentenced myself to death

Too fucked up to care about life
Donât call me self-pity sick
âCause the only truth is that I really donât give a shit

Pills to ignore the pain
Booze to numb the senses
Smoke to fall asleep
I donât fucking care about your help

Pills to ignore the pain
Booze to numb the senses
Smoke to fall asleep
I donât fucking care, I feel adrift

Another city, another faceless crowd
Feeling more alone than ever
My smile is so fake that it disgusts me
I wish next motel room will be my tomb

Trust me when I tell you
Today I just donât care if I live or die
I hate you all for giving me the illusion
that someone cares
Weâre born alone, we die alone

Pills to ignore the pain
Booze to numb the senses
Smoke to fall asleep
I donât fucking care about your help

Pills to ignore the pain
Booze to numb the senses
Smoke to fall asleep
I donât fucking care, I feel adrift
