In the night hour I wander through the streetlights
This dead city is as bleak as my existence
My senses are numb, tranquilized by my self-abuse
Wishing for each of you to stop breathing

In the coldness of this tortured life
I see more darkness coming
Iâm fully aware you think Iâm a sick junk
I chose to dismiss my salvation

Nullifying tomorrow, erasing our will to be
Counting down the days, expecting the one when we wonât awake
Putting compassion to sleep, heading for a killing spree
A selfish final exit, the only way to set ourselves free

 In the coldness of this tortured life
I see more darkness coming
Iâm fully aware you think Iâm a sick junk
I chose to dismiss my salvation

Itâs so hard for you to accept 
What I say is what I believe in
Thereâs a difference between you and me
You just pretend, I fucking mean it

Letâs nullify ourselves
Letâs nullify our place in this life
