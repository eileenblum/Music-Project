Challenge me again, you think you are a king
Wanna flying high but you wonât go far
With those burnt-out wings

Save your lies âcause I know
Youâre the one to blame
Youâre running out of luck
Here comes the pain

Downlift
Drag you under
Into the shit where you belong
Downlift
Iâm cutting you down, cutting you down
Down to size
Forever â permanently

Drag you down â youâre gonna hit the ground
You better watch your back
Iâll slit your throat without a sound

I got some plans for you
And nuthinâ fancyâs coming your way
Go ahead scumbag, make my day

Downlift
Drag you under
Into the shit where you belong
Downlift
Iâm cutting you down, cutting you down
Down to size
Forever â permanently

Challenge me again, you think you are a king
Wanna flying high but you wonât go far
With those burnt-out wings

Bred and born in southern Europe
(Iâm) a pissed-off motherfuck
Donât mess with the working class
Spoilt brat, kiss my wop ass.
