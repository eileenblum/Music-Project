Shutter â where have you gone when the storm has come?
Run away as always, your pride asleep wonât hurt
Iâve seen a thousand faces, all void as yours
Iâve seen a thousand lives, all gone as yours

Now â the curtain falls
Upon the deeds of yours
And leaves the bitter taste of absence

Shutter â where have you gone when your turn has come?
An empty seat remains, the stench of coward fills the air
Another teenage angst, another waste of life
The prototype of failure, a human piece of junk

Now â the curtain falls
Upon the deeds of yours
And leaves the bitter taste of nothingness

Shutter â close your eyelids to the world
So you cannot see what you became
A prisoner of life

A prisoner of your own life.
