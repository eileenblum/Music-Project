From down beneath the subway crawling up in you
The time has come to pay depression overdue

When your disguise is proved untrue
The end is near, the day is through
Leave this world behind
Your joyless ghost has made you blind

Exploiting sadness, complaining in your endless strife
Feel sorry for yourself is all you've ever done in life

When your disguise is proved untrue
The end is near, the day is through
Leave this world behind
Your joyless ghost has made you blind

Drowning into endless waves
Self pity sick - You dwell in your disgrace

Broadcasting your teenage angst
Is all that gets you high
Your fucking failure now reveals so bright

When your disguise is proved untrue
When bitterness is overdue
Feel sorry for yourself
Is all you chose to show 'bout yourself

When your disguise is proved untrue
The end is near, the day is through
Leave this world behind
Your joyless ghost has made you blind
