Lost among this waves
Brought to you again
A splendour of decadence
Still feels like I've been there before

Mesmerized spirit-like
Through dark paths at night

Like a Kinski nightmare
A ravishing atmosphere
Melancholy enthroned
When carnival is gone we're all alone

In the darkness
Shipways are silent, only the wind howls
And the echoes of ghosts
Screaming voicelessly to me

Mesmerized spirit-like
Through dark paths at night

Like spectres over Venice

Laguna arise and take my grief away
Her breeze caresses me
And leaves my soul to wander forever

I wonder what this cold life
Will bring on my way
How things will be
When I'll walk through this city one day
One day
