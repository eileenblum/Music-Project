Stay away from me, I'm all you despise
I'm the one who enjoys the suffering in your eyes
What do you think you have to share with me?
I hate myself, I hate you all but you can't see

Can't you see? I'm already dead
I've died a thousand times
So many crosses fill my eyes
And if we haven't met before
I can bet I won't see you anymore

A nihilistic lifestyle, a southern discomfort
This pretty city is built on a river full of blood
Downtrodden future, a miserable prick
Neglect the happiness, glorify the sick

Can't you see? I'm already dead
I've died a thousand times
So many crosses fill my eyes
And if we haven't met before
I can bet I won't see you anymore

You can't kill who's already dead
You can't kill who's already dead

I have watched my friends
Dragging my blue corpse ashore
I revived to fuck your smiles
And mock you forevermore

From a place between
The big river and the concrete sky
I've returned for retribution
Harm yourself and your loved ones tonight

You can't kill who's already dead
You can't kill who's already dead
You can't kill who's already dead
You can't kill who's already...
