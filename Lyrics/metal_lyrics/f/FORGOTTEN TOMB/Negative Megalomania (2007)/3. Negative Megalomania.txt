Tired of all your bullshit, fed up with all your crap
A bunch of retarded children, all dressed up in black
A mass of nerds, so repressed, behind your PC screens
Trying to appear so evil, to look more and more extreme

A temporary trend you want to live talking shit everyday
You buy a thousand albums, since your parents are the ones who pay
You're a plague to be erased, you're just a waste of life
Now show me your wrists, I will take care of the knife

A negative megalomania
Our weapon to get rid of this scum
Your frustration puts a big smile on my face
I like to provoke your sickening race

"Why don't you kill yourself?"
Too many times I've heard these words,
but still you can't understand
I'm not the one supposed to die
Why don't you take a look
to your silly teenage life?

Always criticizing what I say and who I am
Who are you to judge? I don't really give a damn
You never understood a flying fuck about my belief
Your self-elimination to me would be a nice relief

A negative megalomania
Our weapon to get rid of this scum
Your frustration puts a big smile on my face
I like to provoke your sickening race

Now I know my mistake:
I overvalued people' minds
but still you can't understand
I'm just a wise man
Smiling while I drink some whiskey,
as you complain about how I'm "fake"...

KILL YOURSELF

Rumours and infamies never managed to stop us
Your pathetic lies were just free promotion
Death threats gone in vain, you can't kill who's already dead
Your hate towards us, our fame grows inexorably

(Got some load of misery for ya)

Devil Bless Negativity
