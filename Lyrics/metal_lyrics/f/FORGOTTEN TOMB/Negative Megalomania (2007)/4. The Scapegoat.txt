They want to force me in the corner once again
When I was thinking there was difference between us and them
A bird with its wings nailed to the ground
Waiting for the justice that I never found

I'm just the scapegoat for you all
To brush away the dirt from your rotten souls

When friendship's a lie, and life's a fragile dream
I struggle so much, but my hate remains unseen

I'm just the scapegoat for you all
I'm just the scapegoat for you all

It's so easy to talk when you're not walking in my shoes
Try to be like I am for 1 day, and see what would be left of you

I look in the past and I can't see a single face I would still call friend
Just don't forget sooner or later all lies come to an end

They want to enjoy my end, they wait for my defeat
I'm really sorry buddies, I'm still on my feet
I've been cast in tears and blood
I've been treated like a dog
Not their fake pathetic lives
Not their sickening disguise

I'm just the scapegoat for you all
To brush away the dirt from your rotten souls

When all seems to be wrong, there's a place where I find myself
In my sea of distrust, I am sure I don't need any help

I'm just the scapegoat for you all
I'm just the scapegoat for you all

It's so easy for them to judge the life of others
They're all made of the same poisoned blood
They would even sell their mothers

I look in the future and I know I won't make the same mistakes
I know someday things will be different and with scorn I will piss on
your graves
