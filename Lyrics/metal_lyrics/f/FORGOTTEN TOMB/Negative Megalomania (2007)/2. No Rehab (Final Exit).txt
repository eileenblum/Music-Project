Into the maze of my mind
getting high on something beautiful
I use to call my wine

Thoughts disturbed
Bouncing things hitting the walls of my brain
It sounds like I'm going insane

Desolate
Like some drug running through my veins
It is just myself to blame

Screams unheard
But it's not that bad this feeling
as I puke my soul onto the ground

My sight is getting numb
There's something I can't understand
beyond this wall of blackness
Strange figures dance before me
I know they're going to bury me
in some fucking hospital

Dead onto a mortuary slab
My skin turned blue
Too late for rehab
Heart has ceased to beat
Poisoned blood is drained outside of me
My soul released, finally I'm free

My sight is getting numb
There's something I can't understand
beyond this wall of blackness
Strange figures dance before me
I know they're going to bury me
in some fucking hospital.
