Remembrances - Once more Im there
Living in the past
Faded pictures of yesterday
My best and worst memories
Will be forever here

Another night - Bleak fading lights
Im growing old with them

Burning grief consumates me
Im falling to dust

Another day - Is turning grey
Tonight I burn my pictures

When I come home
from these useless days
And I dream of past joys
Then I fall again into loneliness
And my blood streams in remembrance

When I cry into darkness
And my scars release blood
Sometimes you would have wantes to die
To let me the last good memories of you

A desert inside
Cold blue dust is falling on my eyes
Im flying away
Dreaming of those bittersw!
 eet days

Now I watch these opened wounds
For every cut i bur
n another fear
Both we were painful scars,
drops of blood falling in an endless sea of sadness.
