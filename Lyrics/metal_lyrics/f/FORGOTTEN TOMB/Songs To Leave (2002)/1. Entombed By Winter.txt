[Music and Lyrics by HERR MORBID - Summer 1999, Autumn/Winter 2000]

Observe the snow under which i lie with empty eyes 
Losing life, remembrances of cries 
Frozen images of last sick days 
The forceless body hanged shows me ill-fated ways 

Recalling desolation, no one cried my death 
The acrid taste of rotting takes my breath away 
My violet lips covered with frost 
The paleness of those walls is lost... 
It's fucking lost 

The winter grows cold 
It takes me into the frame of dust and old 
The silence in me... 
Please Death set me free 

Fallin' upon my buried coffin 
the snow freezes my last smile 
And the tears are crystallized 
But the pain remains in me 

Still and cold and dead 
My body lies under the ground 
A withered flower falls on me 
Upon the ice of my grave 

ENTOMBED BY WINTER... 

Memories of life, times lost in my mind 
Ages of a forgotten existence, so far now 
Dusty shells of pictures buried by years 
Tell me who i am 
Tell me how to see my dawn... 
Tomorrow... 

Were we born to struggle and suffer ? 
Happiness is a short while 
Where we forget to be humans 
Hate is only a waste of time 
The cold is growing, end of days 
Hold my body and take me far away 
Far away from this grave of  frost 
We must enjoy these moments of inhumanity 
Before they take our dream away... 

ENTOMBED BY WINTER
