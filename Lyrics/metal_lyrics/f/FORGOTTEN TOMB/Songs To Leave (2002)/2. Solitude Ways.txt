[Music and Lyrics by HERR MORBID, Autumn/Winter 2000]

Last night I walked again that soil, 
places in my mind 
Remembrances as cold pieces of glass 
Blood red stained mirrors 
lie broken upon the floor 
A time so far - Something we can't recall 

I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
I can't describe the day 
when we crossed our solitude ways 

Deserted houses - Haven of mine 
Tombs under eternal fog and frost 
The pool of blood is turning cold, 
as we watch our reflection 
becoming red as December dusk 

I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
You'll never cry alone in the rain 
The sleep will heal our solitude days 

They'll never live the meaning of parting 
Souls left alone in the night 
as tears flow with the pain 

Loneliness, coldness and bloodlust 
Alcohol, razorblades and the same old places 
Blood, tears and semen 
the only human things will be left of me? 

I love the night as I love your eyes 
You'll burn inside the cold lands of my heart 
Our way together towards inhumanity 
Our dreams without any God above 

I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
We'll never cry alone in the rain 
Only Death now could divide our solitude ways
