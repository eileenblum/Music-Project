Never again will we feed those with inhibition
And let me catch anyone trying to think free
Keep a close eye on those sleeping
Watch them with eyes like hawks circling their prey
I will renounce the moment you were given power
May dark circles and clouds follow your soul straight to hell
The darkness you see was not caused by me
well, it has always existed here

I've waited for sleep and I'm watching every memory fade
Just spread my ashes in the wind
Take her out
You see what becomes of thieves here!
