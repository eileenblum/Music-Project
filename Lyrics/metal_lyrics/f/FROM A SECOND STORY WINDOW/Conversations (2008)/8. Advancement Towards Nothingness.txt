The moral majority knows
Nothing of what it is to be free
Now if we examine the modern ways of thinking
Then perhaps we could see
The mistakes we are making

The standard way of life
Is not better now than it used to be

Is the answer too great
For the question at hand
Can we allow ourselves to advance

It seems to me, that to advance, we must have had, some sort of plan

So it seems to me
That there will be an eternity
That will carry us home in the end

Just hold onto me, hang on
It will be alright in the end.

They need us here
For our love and for our fear
They force love
They force fear
