Behold the treason
That sits fittingly on crowns of war
We're sifting soot, gathering the evidence
While they let us believe
That the accused is free

Well if I'm dreaming
Please let this be the one that wakes me
From this life
No longer will I allow myself
To sink this way

I will  curse you as you sit on high
And watch us burn
They'd watch us die

I wish that it were not true
The ways we choose to love
Can lead us down
And show us how to be ourselves

There is no us in this world anymore
There is only war
Believing in a change
Is what has sent them away
To cause more pain
To breed more war

I feel so alone
Like there is no home
And this wind feels like fire in my bones

Someone set me free
Allow me to be all you ever wanted
I'm all you'll ever need
