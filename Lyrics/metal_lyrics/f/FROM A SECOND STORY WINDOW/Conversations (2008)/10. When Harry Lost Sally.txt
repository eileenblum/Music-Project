Are you feeling well?
And are you alone, in the house we called our home
I'm still waiting here, lost and without a care.
The further you run, the closer you are to me.
Well, I'm still waiting here
Arms wide and wearing thin

You must be blinded by your own eyes
Surely you understand it's you I despise

And if we hold on to what we had
We could be what everyone has
Just to see the sun rise into the sky
I'd give anything to be closer to you
I'd give everything to be closer to you
