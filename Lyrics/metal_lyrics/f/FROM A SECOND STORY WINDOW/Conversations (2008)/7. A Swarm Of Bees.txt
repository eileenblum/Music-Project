Keep listening as I speak
There will be one true reckoning
We're gathering as we prevail
So I will sail before we fail

As the world keeps spinning around
We're trying to grab a piece of ground

I simply can't complete any sort of feat aside from breathing.
Increase in temperature is the fault of all, we suffocate ourselves
We are only breathing

There are so many ways to rearrange there are so many reasons that life must change
Look to the children who have no home
Look to the children, what have they done?
We paved the roads of destruction, what have we done
We paved the roads of destruction, we've let them down

What are we waiting for

Never again will we see the worlds dreams.
They're all dying.
We are the visitors here and the air is failing.
There is no world to punish, we destroyed it all.
