Remember when lines were formed for some sort of reason?
Be silent
And not just something we do to show our allegiance
Try breathing
Does it make you feel as though you're simply conceding?

Rest your head and continue to tell yourself that nothing we do will ever quell the contempt we all share.

I have a lot to lose more than I can tell you
Oh god I'm almost there.
I'm already leaving.

Keep silent and breath in.
In breathing we are no longer here

Lies

I am alive, I feel alive

I was meant for more than the way I feel. I revel in my madness. Is there a God outside?

Are you listening?
There could be more than this.
