It's 3 o'clock and we are waiting for it to rain
And I'm planning our escape
To the places we can go
To the shores that we call home

Well surly we can make it out of here
You know that we will never be clear
Of the feelings they all harbor
Well, yea I'd rather not bother

Do you feel lonely
All the time

If you'll come with me. well, then I can show you
That the lives we lead could be sure and true
And if you take your time to look around you'd see
There's nothing wrong with me that hasn't already been seen

There's nothing wrong with me
There's nothings wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with us, I'm seeing through
Nothing's wrong with me that can't be traced to you
I've folded in my heart, I'd waste it all for you

Do you feel lonely?
All the time
