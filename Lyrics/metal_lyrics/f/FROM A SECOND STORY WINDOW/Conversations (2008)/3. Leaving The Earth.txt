I'm never coming back
We've made our choice
Now let's live with it
In my life I never had the chance to change
Why can't we change?

Grown enough to know where to begin
If we know where it would end
Then we all could see the sky for what it is

We are lost

Like running in circles
Trying to realize what we are
We are the truth
We hold the proof that what we are is of no use

Is there a way to make a change?
While running in circles
Can we outlive the coming days?

No
We are a waste of space
We are the world gone wrong
Save yourself

I am awake
