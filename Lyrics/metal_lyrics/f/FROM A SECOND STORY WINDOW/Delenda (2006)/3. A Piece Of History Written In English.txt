[TOBIAS (The Son):]
SEPARATE yourself from the end of this, before you become the end of the one thing that you never wanted in the first place...
Moving forward against my will.
I am now aware of how you sit... watching, judging, and always leaving waste in your wake...
I make my final stand, my heart it separates into pieces.
I've been forgiving, but this isn't what I signed up for, and I say we leave it all, do not give up until you are dead.
I will never stop believing in this, it is over again.

[CROWD:]
What shall we do? What shall we do now?

[TOBIAS:]
THIS is a new beginning.
I hold the sun in my hands.
And if you let me save you, we will bring means to this end...
Again and again we believe, looking into this light, and we still scream burning in this fire.
