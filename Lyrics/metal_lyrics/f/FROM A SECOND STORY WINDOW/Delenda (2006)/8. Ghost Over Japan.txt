[JORDAN CRUZE:]
sometimes we can see the skylines rise above the fields of sinking stones
crawling away from this sun again, it feels like forever since this all began
and these prayers of mine are lost in this house of sand
we float away just like the ghosts over Japan.

[DANA RICHARDS:]
And they float away like the wind. so will you stay with me?
And wait with me? We can change this world forever.

[JORDAN CRUZE:]
Stay with me and wait with me... You can see down again here we go...
Look out your window and see the world as it starts crumbling down again, here we go!..
Walk away into this dream it will end with me.
