[PASTOR STEELE:]
crumble down oh symbol on high, this world is no more
feel the warmth of horses breath on your neck
kiss the flames of Loki's blade
then you might be able to understand what has really happened
there is nothing more, only dark
we have lost everything, this well has run its course
I feel so betrayed. As if I am going to be murdered by the air I breathe, the ground I walk on, and this water that cleanses me.
We can leave our legacy to the cockroaches
do you see those lights ahead? Can you see them?
They are angels sent to kill us
they are the angels of death

[TRISHNA:]
...but the dead.

[PASTOR STEELE:]
No. The dead only whisper their words.
