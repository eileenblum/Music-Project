[JOHN:]
Lost at sea and the breeze is SLOWLY killing me.
My blood may stop in this wind, Jesus what a storm this is.
Drink in that darkness my love; it very well may be the last you see.
If you look out to the sea, dead and gone is where ill be.

[CAPTAIN:]
WE ARE GOING DOWN!..
THIS SHIP IS SINKING!!
THIS SHIP IS DOOMED!

[LINDA:]
I see the waves like giants.
Their hands are smashing our ship...
I know now that I am lost and there is no escaping.
I am to be swept away deep into the blue.

[SHIPS MATE:]
THIS SHIP IS TAKING ON WATER...AND WE ARE ALL GOING DOWN.

[JOHN:]
oh god not down again...my dreams have been true...this is how I end.
No! Down...not down again...dear sweet oracle please let me wake FROM THIS...don't let this be my end!?!
I have done my part; please let me wake from this!

[SUDROV:]
IN THE END THERE IS NO REST FOR THE WICKED AND WE ARE ALL DOOMED.
THEIR EYES WERE SHUT FOREVER.
