Open the gates,
let the wounded in,
leave the rest to rot fear the sky,
amazing how it happened,
the blood poured down like rain,
fear this sky, fear our sky,
floating closer to my face,
ressurrect the fears that you forgot,
look upon them, with such disgust,
hear the screams of the children,
show us where to hide,
place your faith in someone else,
floating closer to my face,
I can feel you,
laughing while we're bleeding.
