Kiss these sour lips,
paint a smile on my face,
translate all of these words and thoughts to actions,
breathe life into my mouth, never leave me,
kissing your sweet lips,
was all I needed to live,
reach in grab my heart,
never let go, my reflection has shown me,
how you have changed my soul, take my hand,
I will always feel your touch, take my hand,
WAIT,
I won't be left alone,
WAIT,
I can't face myself tonight by myself,
please hold me close, I will not survive, I won't survive this,
kill all your hopes and leave me to remain,
can't you see in these eyes,
how much you mean to me,
stay here, forever with me.

This EP was re-released in 2004 by Black Market Activities under the name "Not One Word Has Been Omitted".
