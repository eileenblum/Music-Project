Cleanse this fallen angel with open arms,
we will not see the same sun set again,
I know that this is ending,
a life long dream I had,
to keep you alive,
walking with your hands around my throat,
realize that everyone is against you,
walking with hands around my throat,
in my eyes you're so plain,
holding your hand with such high hopes to one day own your heart.
