To the God in which i believe not just some fairy-tale
The one who answered me in power and revealed Himself
To You my God i lift up my life, body and soul
And to this world festering in filth
I will feel no remorse to leave you but while im here mark these words

I DENY YOU!
I DENY YOU!
I DENY YO-O-U-U!
I DENY YOU!

And your wicked ways
From this day forth you have my hate
Your desires disgust me and your designs are frail
Building churches of flesh and bone, susceptible to rot and decay

Feel the foundations start to crumble, sensing your demise
Let the walls collapse, this is the day perversion dies
Let it die

Oh God, how i love You! And i will bless You forever for what You have done!
Oh wicked world, how i hate you! And i will never forgive you for what you have become!
