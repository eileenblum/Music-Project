Lion of Judah roar!
Bring in a new wave of deliverance
A fresh outpouring of Your Spirit

The Lord has brought us to such a time as this, a season of preparation
Awaken the watchmen, awaken the warriors, awaken His bride
An outpouring is on the horizon, and the flame of revolution is in our hearts
Your spirit is His!

Share in the blessed communion, adopt reformation as a way of life
You were meant for each other!

Power was meant to course through your spiritual veins
Light to flow from your eyes and out of every pore
A sword is your inheritance and glory is your birthright
Open your heart not just to let him in but to let yourself out

Wake up! Get out of your seat, and stop clinging to the corpse of tradition
Stop going to pay your respects to a wretched counterfeit of Christ and start celebrating the Living God!

Prepare, the Lord is alive and He is here! worship the Lord!

With dance and song! clashing cymbals and waves, stringed instruments and wind through the trees, a shout From his people and the cries from the stone of the earth!

Hosanna! Hosanna in the highest!
