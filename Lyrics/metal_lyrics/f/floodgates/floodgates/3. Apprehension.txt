You say to those who will listen
Seek me and you will find me
I'm not calling you a liar but i feel so lost

I cant feel you
And youre no where to be seen
Your voice is all but silent

I tell myself that its a test
But i dont believe that
I'm being honest when i say
I don't know where you are
Or if there's even anything to find if i were to look for you

But something tells me that youre there
I couldn't let go if i wanted to
You're always on my mind
You're ways are constantly the object of my comparison

How can you not exist if i can cling to you so
But how can you be omnipresent and yet i cant feel you surrounding me

I don't know what to do but i need peace
And if that comes from You, Jesus the one who is said to possess peace that surpasses understanding

If your yoke is easy and your burden is light
Then my soul needs your rest, my spirit thirsts for something more
Your word offers living water and a house with an open door

Only of the son of a living and mighty god will let me know that you are there

I am waiting for you

Surpass what i have come to know and understand
Show me something real
I need love
