Through suicide, my souls evaporates into
An interstellar-travelling entity.
Headed through space at subluminal speeds,
I enter a black hole held open by a
Spherical shell of negative-mass cosmic strings.
Reality as I know it melts into a whirlwind of psychedelics.
Colors and shapes run together creating intricate geometric patterns.
Space-time distorts as the warped patterns
Stretched farther down the flux tube.
Crossing the event horizon, time dilutes and ceases to exit.
Through the wormhole shadow, a parallel universe can be seen...
A dimension I will never reach. A paradox of myself withers before my eyes.
He cycles through the seasons of life.
From birth to death, to birth again...each lifetime, a reciprocal of the former. Interstellar Condemnation
Imprisoned Between Dimensions
Every movement and every word predicted.
Fading over the millenniums, crisp black and white images erode to a series of grays.
Sharp figures bleed into one another.
Infinite lifetimes, I have yet to experience.
Trapped in the flux tube. Suspended in time for eternity.
Imprisoned between dimensions.
Interstellar condemnation.
Trapped in the flux tube. Suspended in time for eternity.
Imprisoned between dimensions. Confined within the wormhole.
