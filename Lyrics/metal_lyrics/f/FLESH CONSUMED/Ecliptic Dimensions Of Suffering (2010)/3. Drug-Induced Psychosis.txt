Methamphetamine-fueled psychosis.
Performing worthless surgical procedures.
I splay open the rib cage, hemoglobin sprays.
The shadows lurk over me observing my work.
Red Phosphorus coursing through my veins.
Paranoia Increases with my accelerating heart rate.
Delusions of parasitosis, obsessive picking at the skin.
Formication leads to self-mutilation.
I torture the human for what seems like an eternity.
The days and nights blend as one.
While performing the vivisect
I stare deep through the soul into the astral plane.
Entranced in nebulas and stellar lights.
My physical body continues to torture
while I travel the universe.
