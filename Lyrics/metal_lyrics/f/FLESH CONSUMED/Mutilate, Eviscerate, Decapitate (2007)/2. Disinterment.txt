Gorge on death, rotten flesh
Liquefied, eat that which has died
Unearth the bounty of jellified human carnage
Pillage the treasure chest, of mortified produce
Feast on the meat, of the long since deceased
Worm infested cutlets, tenderized by decay
Cemetery cropfields, constantly replenished
Saturated the earth, with dead human effluents
The time has come, to reap the harvest
Exhume the casket, snatch up the carcass
Decrepit mangled bodies
Devastated by putrefaction
The hands of time aid our cuisine
By means of pre-digestion
Plunge into this before you
Submerge yourself in human slosh
Slurp down giblets, siphon spinal fluids
Gnashing teeth tear through tendons
Splinter bones to suck out marrow
Waste nothing, feast again tomorrow
