Beneath the septic system of the metropolis
Hides a lair of torment and killing
An assembly of intertwining tunnels and passages
The underground labyrinth leads into a pit
Chloroform on a rag, I drag victims into the feeding ground
Awakened by the bestial gutturals of starved boars
The gates are drawn and the beasts are released into the labyrinth
Adrenalin pumps as I watch the boars hunt down the prey
Eaten alive by the pack, ripped apart and devoured in minutes
Cranial bone crunches as they gnaw on the skull
The sound of the teeth scraping on bone gets me high
Feasting on cranial seepage
Gelatin textured brain matter leaks from the cranium
Human scraps are all that remain
Plummeting into the depths of the cesspool
They descend into the abyss
The spikes below split humans in two
Fumes from decaying flesh induce vomiting on contact
Tortured souls emit blood churning shrieks from the depths
Skeletal remains impaled on stakes aging back for decades
And sustain for decades to come
