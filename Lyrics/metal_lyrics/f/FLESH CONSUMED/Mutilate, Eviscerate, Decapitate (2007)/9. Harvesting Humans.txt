Nuclear warheads detonate overhead
Salted hydrogen bombs designed to destroy
Mutually assured destruction
Bodies incinerate in the initial blast
Building structures collapse into rubble
Firestorms burn through cities
And forests emitting vast amounts of smoke, soot
And dust into the troposphere
Driven by whirlwinds to form a black particle
Cloud belt encircling the northern hemisphere
The clouds block out the suns light causing
Surface temperatures to plunge to subfreezing levels
High doses of radiation kill off the earth's vegetation and animal life
Hazardous radioactive fallout in every continent
Toxic radiation lingers for decades
The surviving humans retreat into underground fallout shelters beneath the
ruins
Soon all food rations are depleted
The starvation triggers chaos and killing
The weak killed off and eaten raw
Children and elders ripped limb by limb
Until they devise a systematic way to feed
Women are isolated and impregnated
Raising their infants like cattle
They're kept in cages made of human bones
Harvesting humans, slaughtered by hand
Skins are stretched, dried and used as clothing
Organs and meat dispersed amongst the tribe
Everything mankind has built up to has been
Reduced to a barbaric, cannibalistic society
