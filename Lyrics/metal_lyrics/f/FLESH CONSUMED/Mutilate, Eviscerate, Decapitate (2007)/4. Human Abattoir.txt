Human livestock hauled in by the hundreds
And herded into holding pens
Prepared for pre-slaughter inspection
Then let the slaughtering begin
Conveyor commencing infinite killings
Bolt through the brain, hung by the legs
Slit the throat, let the blood drain
Vat of human slush overflowing with plasma
Humans transferred from
Bleeding shackles to hooks
Identified by numbers side by side
Cadavers transferred to the cutting line
Stainless steel, the skin is peeled
Remove the head, thousands killed
Harvest the organs
Cavity inspected for parasites
Split the carcass
And continue down the F-line
Body parts are separated
And meat cuts preserved
Meat products packaged and distributed
On the underground human meat market
