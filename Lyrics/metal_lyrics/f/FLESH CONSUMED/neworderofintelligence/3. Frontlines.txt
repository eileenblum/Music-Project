The beginning of the end for man
Gassed out by droids the humans are forced
To engage machines above ground
Man versus machine
Armageddon begins
We stand face to face
Extermination of the human race
A sea of human bodies come into view
Through the radioactive haze
Deteriorating steel foundation projects
From the concrete wasteland
The flourishing machines paint the sky
With the shimmering of metals through
Transparent green radiation
Powered exoskeletons move into place
The robotic hum crescendos like a droning engine
The mechanical infantry overtake the horizon
Man versus machine
Armageddon begins
We stand face to face
Extermination of the human race
