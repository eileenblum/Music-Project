Artificial organisms flood the desolate ruins
Steel and flesh collide
The humans attack optical sensors then immobilize
Nanoparticles drift through the wasteland in a shifting cloud
The micro-robots enter the bloodstream ensuring a slow
Agonizing death in which there is no escape
Equipped elitists scan the proximity
With flawless precision high-charged plasma blasts
Incinerate humans upon contact
The apocalypse
Inferior race
Consumed by fire
Reduced to nothingness
Human troops target a primary generator
Hundreds of machines power-down in a wave as an
Electrical surge sifts through the land
Calculating logistics
The machines prepare to use orbital kinetic weaponry
With a tweak of a satellite the remaining humans incinerate
In a hailstorm of concentrated laser beams and nuclear warheads
Consumed by fire
Reduced to nothingness
Man is extinct
