Ice -- waking up in a death chamber, my body cold
Light -- in my head sucking out what they call soul
Flesh -- begins to rot slowly
Pouring my inside out stuck here with the pain running in circles
Ride -- hovering over the desolated ground
Sigh -- once again I hear the voices call
Breed -- through a whole in the sky they would fall
Pouring my inside out stuck here with the pain running in circles

Never did I feel consequences on my walk thought I was invulnerable and strong enough to fight them
I didn't know that I was watched from behind I couldn't see a thing cause I had already been blinded
The further I walked the less I felt the pain the more vanished my hope I could survive
Then I tumbled and I felt and couldn't get back on my feet
The earthshake had broken the horizon

Line -- over the massive mountains the would step
Die -- my fate was sealed now I couldn't turn back
Time stands still
Flesh and bones wasted life stuck here with the pain holding my breath the last

The sourness in me
The weakness I felt

Blind  - had only been
Wise  - can't hear a thing
Time  - wretched hole in me
Why - am I lying here
