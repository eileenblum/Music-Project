I thought those days would help me face the demons I had called
Tripping away only the pair of eyes would follow me

A loaded gun I'm on the run but I don't know where from
It feels irrationally right but I am losing
Am I the one who could have done everything he was told
A thousand nights I've been awake now I a losing my ground and I fall

I am drowning again
With fear in my eyes
Golden light and shades
Trapped in walls that break
Sinking in the velvet light
Close the eyes as the walls would break

Too tired to walk my burning feet can hardly feel the ground
I'm dying of thirst I'm freezing to death this time -- nothing!
Too tired to walk my burning feet can hardly feel the ground
I'm dying of thirst I'm freezing to death this time going down

I am drowning again
With fear in my eyes
Golden light and shades
Trapped in walls that break
Sinking in the velvet light
Close the eyes as the walls would break

Seeing the gates
A thousand times I've dreamed of this moment
Tears dried
Fears remaining how could I have lied

I am drowning again
With fear in my eyes
Golden light and shades
Trapped in walls that break
Sinking in the velvet light
Close the eyes as the walls would...
