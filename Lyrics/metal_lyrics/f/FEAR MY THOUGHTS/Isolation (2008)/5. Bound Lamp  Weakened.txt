Sold my pocket full of gold
Thought then there was something to receive
Down and burned out from the quest
The things I tried to reach just weren't real

I used to live alone and always had the feeling I was wrong
But how could I have lied
I buried all my dreams and these was nothing left to hide

Leave this world by night
Nothing left behind
Trapped all inside
Bound and weakened

Gone the power that I've won
And yet I had to fight as long as rain keeps falling on me

I choose to die alone but either way I pick it always feels so wrong

Leave this world by night
Nothing left behind
Trapped all inside
Bound and weakened
