Leave it all behind
Tired of asking the way as I walk in the rain
Questioning what is called life
Wasting time hoping the fate will deliver the sense
Rays of time through my eyes
Separating truth from lies
But a reason I won't find
Seeing no chances at all
To stop me from falling into blankness

Here I stand all alone and I'm watching me bleed
Threw away all my values just to free me
Through the eyes of a god but still I can't see
Gave up hope to be born again as I leave

Over the edge of all times
I am struck down by the light
That once was held inside
Weird as I what it go by
Without burning my eyes
I had my lesson

Here I stand all alone and I'm watching me bleed
Threw away all my values just to free me
Through the eyes of a god but still I can't see
Gave up hope to be born again as I leave

I was wondering how I could relieve myself from walking under those trees
The bitter taste of being infested by an unknown disease
The parasites nagging all my consciousness but I am trying to find
The way into glory even if that meant that I must sacrifice

All that I leave
Now I know that it's gone
I am left here alone

I know what life sometimes can mean
I walked away and now it's much too late
But still it's all part of the game
We try to cheat and then we betray

Here I stand all alone and I'm watching me bleed
Threw away all my values just to free me
Through the eyes of a god but still I can't see
Gave up hope to be born again as I leave
