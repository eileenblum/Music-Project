When nights will fall
We will never be the same
My blinded walk over the edge
No grave to bury my sin
When time will ring
In the long awaited end
My lost soul will finally arrive
And then we'll meet again

Stand in a breeze and I was completely hollow
Built you a cage with golden bars in time of sorrow

Pretending anger
For what was and what is yet to come

And I treat you the way I treat a goddess
Your crown you won't wear becoming useless
Try to remember things I've long forgotten
This boat went ashore so far and I can't

Remember anger, feeling cold

When nights will fall
We will never be the same
My blinded walk over the edge
No grave to bury my sin
When time will ring
In the long awaited end
My lost soul will finally arrive
And then we'll meet again

Finding me a way to you

The golden cage is opened up widely
You break your neck and you'll die

When nights will fall
We will never be the same
My blinded walk over the edge
No grave to bury my sin
When time will ring
In the long awaited end
My lost soul will finally arrive
And then we'll meet again
