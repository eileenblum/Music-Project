The golden roofs I see below in the dead of the night are passing by
Like my last hint of hope
My wings spread wide carrying me through the air
My every night's dream and soon a nightmare

Never had I seen waterfalls
Just tales of some memories
How can it be that life just don't make me curious
How I become what I'm meant to be
How can it be that life makes no sense to none of us
How do I become what is meant for me?

And we fear the end so we burn the lamb
A thousand days to spend in herds but we're alone
So we turn to sand and the time will bend
Our suffering till the end and we all die alone

Never has light come through those clouds unnatural air that we would breathe
But we live in peace still that don't seem to be good enough
Gave up hope that it's worth to believe
We die in peace still that don't seem to be good enough
I wanna believe that it's worth to bleed

And we fear the end so we burn the lamb
A thousand days to spend in herds but we're alone
So we turn to sand and the time will bend
Our suffering till the end and we all die alone
