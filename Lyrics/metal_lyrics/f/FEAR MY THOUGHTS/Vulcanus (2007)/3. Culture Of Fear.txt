To hunt the ones I am here for
I don't care how long it will take, in a culture of fear I please expectations
If it bleeds it leads, we all know so well
I feed the needy - I feed them fear and I will shed not any precious tear
The distance of these motives is wide, I'm standing on the safer side

[Chorus:]
I'm here to spread Anxiety, I will fuel all your fear

I capture human tragedies, I'm here to catch the moments of pure despair
Agony is fueling me, Anxiety is ruling me

[Chorus]

In a culture of fear I please expectations
In a culture of fear I satisfy you
