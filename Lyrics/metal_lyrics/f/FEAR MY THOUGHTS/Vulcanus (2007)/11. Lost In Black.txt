So here I stand now judging the life I lived so far
All actions and my decisions
What was and what has been
Way too many signs pointed to various directions
No matter which way I choose
Regrets did follow me

[Chorus:]
Forgive, forget - To count my mistakes
Life, love regret - Is all that it takes

So many ways to go on and so little I can see
The darkness seems impermeable, no light to lead me on
Too many signs taking the sun, directions lost in black
No matter which way I choose
Regrets did follow me

[Chorus]

I am lost in black
Please don't count my faults
I know I made quite a few

[Chorus]
