[Chorus:]
I can't be saved - I cannot hide
My time is running out
I can't be saved - I cannot hide
I'm running out of time

Have no time to waste, nothing to lose
A burden on my back, I did not chose to bear myself
All things I tried they failed, nothing that worked
A struggle I can't win, I'm doomed to fall away from you

[Chorus]

The world I used to know is so long gone
And all abilities fading memories of hope
Caught in this living hell, just one way out
My way towards the end, a silent one to go from here

Ice cold fingers longing for my back
Grinding every move I make
Sands of time bending my weak spine
I've wasted precious time
Gates to nowhere open silently
My only way to go
I leave everything behind and walk on silently

[Chorus]
