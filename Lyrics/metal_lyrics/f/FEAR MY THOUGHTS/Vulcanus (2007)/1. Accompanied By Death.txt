You have to understand, we fight a faceless threat
Endangered is every step we take. the foe could be everywhere
Our ears in every wall, these eyes will never rest, our freedom is defended.

We will stand until the end

[Chorus:]
We are the chosen people, we're keeper of the truth
And we will stand until the end, we are the brightest torch
We're the bearer of the light, you will learn, death is by our side.

We spy on every suspect, fulfill our god given task, our enemies will not succeed
We take them to their judge
We will never rest, we take this to an end, we will never rest, the evil is condemned.

[Chorus]

Death is by our side
