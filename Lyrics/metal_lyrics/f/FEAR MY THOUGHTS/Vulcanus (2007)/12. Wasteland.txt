I never thought this world would change
Never felt this way would turn around
I always thought I would be save
But now I know I have to go

[Chorus:]
The force of change, disrupting me
The force of change takes me to this wasteland

The world I know I leave behind
I'm wandering on unknown paths
Alone I am here in the dark
I have found a light that shines

So I fall into this wasteland

My feet touch unknown ground
A new hope that I found
Forever on the run

[Chorus]
