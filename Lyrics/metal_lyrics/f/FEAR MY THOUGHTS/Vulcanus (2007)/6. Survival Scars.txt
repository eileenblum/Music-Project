I saw the light coming for me, an icy wind arose, I fought so hard to stay
The solitude was so close
They pushed the needle right in me
Pushed it into my head
They pushed the needle right in me
Survive what they call dead

[Chorus:]
I can't tell if I'm still alive
All I know
I feel so dead I long for life

They bend me and the broke me - They squeezed me into a form
They taught and were leading me - According to their norm

[Chorus]

With all the scars I carry with me. I don't feel alive
With all the scars I carry with me

Knowing I'm not dead
