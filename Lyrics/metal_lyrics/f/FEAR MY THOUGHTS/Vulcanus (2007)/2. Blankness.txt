My hope, my dreams, my love - They fade
Vanishing tastes of what I had and all that seems to stay with me are memories - A gone reality
And everything I feel is the blankness within me

[Chorus:]
I feel the emptiness in me, to never feel this pain.

The dull expression of faceless guises, I feel the pain in me arises
Can't talk about the things I've been through
I cannot tell where I have to go

[Chorus]

All I feel is blankness in me

[Chorus]
