Who was the first one to throw the stone
Which book is telling the truth
The two named lord is long gone
While old men sacrifice their youth

[Chorus:]
Hallowed country, disgraced without end
Both blood can't be washed away from your hand

Hatred and distrust grows on sacred land
No fire can be distinguished with oil
Innocent blood fertilized the sand
You all live life in toil

[Chorus]

Fanatics send you to war, a normal life is there no more
Your losses drive you insane, blood won't wash away pain

[Chorus]
