This world is changing it's appearance every single day
We're the ones that are faced to adjust
You have to keep up with the pace you constantly bear
Or you will lose your place

[Chorus:]
You'll only get this one attempt to try
Accelerate or die

We cannot wait for you to learn the things you need to know
You have to follow our advice
Evolution forces us to terminate what's old and slow
They'll be wiped away

[Chorus]

So don't forget, don't ask for reasons why

Accelerate or die

[Chorus]
