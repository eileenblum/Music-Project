I've got that feeling
That you're scared my little friend
You are shivering
And you're nervous I can see
You got no reasons to behave unassertive
I will show you, you can count on me for sure

[Chorus:]
The young girl dies - the old man lives
Consumed her soul - Nothing more to give
The young girl dies - Won't see no lies
Her soul consumed - Nothing there still shines

Take my hand now
And suppress your childish fears
To decide how we will make our way from here
You got no reasons to behave unassertive
I will show you, you can count on me for sure

[Chorus]

The young girl's eyes won't see no life
Her soul consumed nothing left to shine
Don't you believe what they say
There're only trying to split us
Never believe what they say
They're just trying to scare you
