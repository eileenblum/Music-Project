It's love it's hate it's pure it's tainted
So clean so cleansed it sickens
It cuts it bleeds it scars forever
It's ink it stains it's for life

Havok
Keep your head.
Where your feet stand the rest will unfold
Havok
Stand strong through it all and the rest will unfold
Havok

The trust the lies they crawl inside us
They breed infest and they kill
It's rage its raw it's brutality
It screams and then it's silence

Havok
Keep your head.
Where your feet stand the rest will unfold
Havok
Stand strong through it all and the rest will unfold
Havok

All along through it all
Havok grows inside us
All these years remained strong
Havok is upon us
It's love it's hate it's war
It's what we're fighting for
Havok, havoc, havok
The struggles in our lives.
The meaning shown in time
Havok, havoc, havok

Keep your head.
Where your feet stand the rest will unfold
Havok
Stand strong through it all and the rest will unfold
Havok
