So fed up!
With the filth from your mouth.
So shut up!
So sick of all your lies.
Your bullshit!
It gets in the way.
I canât stand it!
You are my enemy!

Gonna mouth off?
Gonna get the last word?
Gonna rise up, flex a little power
Or clam up like a bitch mother fucker!? [Repeat]

So fed up!

So shut up!
You know Iâm swinging it.
Youâre bullshit!
And youâre in my way.
I canât stand it!
You are my enemy!

Whatcha say
Whatcha gonna do now huh?
Gonna mouth off?
Gonna get the last word?
Gonna rise up, flex a little power
Or clam up like a bitch mother fucker!? [Repeat]

Iâm growing tired of your problems, your complaining.
Yes, youâre all the same.
You are all insane
You talk behind my back.
Believe I hear you loud now.
Yet to my faceâ¦
Not a sound.
Itâs going around.
Itâs coming around.
Itâs going around.

Itâs all the rage.
All the rage.

Itâs all the rage!

Now brace yourself motherfucker!

Itâs going around punk.
Itâs all the rage.
