Life, itâs a funny thing
It pulls you under
Holds you down so you canât breathe
Breathe itâll be okay
The sunlight only comes after the rain
Rain down on me
All of your thoughts
On how much better it could be
Be my wishing well
Iâll do all I can
But time will only tell

Your crimes!
In life!
Oh god, canât you see me?
Iâve fallen completely
Down, Iâm down
Iâm scratching, Iâm bleeding
Wonât somebody help me?!

Tell me the truth
Your darkest memories
And all your secrets too
Two becomes one
The sound of those three words
As they left your tongue
Tongue in cheek
If they should ask
What happened to me
Me, Iâm a fool
I sacrificed myself
With hopes of saving you

Your crimes!
In life!
Oh god, canât you see me?
Iâve fallen completely
Down, Iâm down
Iâm scratching, Iâm bleeding
Wonât somebody help me?!

Now!
Iâm falling down.
Down down
Oh, why?!
All these bitter lies, lies, lies!
No, I can no longer contain
My thoughts on this, on falling behind
So far behind
That I canât persevere
Where I feel the air
Is leaving my lungs
Iâm spun and too far gone from saving
When it all came down around you
It was me who found you!
The bitter truth
Those last words leaving you
Your silence is a blessing
Iâm now professing
All the lies, your lies!

You, whatâs left to say?
Youâre with me always
In every song I sing
Sing to keep sane
A simple way
To keep my demons astray
Stray, and I did
Iâll do it again
If thatâs what it takes to get by in life!

Oh god, youâve deceived me
Iâve lost you completely
Now, Iâm down
Iâll return
To be abused once more
The bitter truth
Those last words
Leaving you
