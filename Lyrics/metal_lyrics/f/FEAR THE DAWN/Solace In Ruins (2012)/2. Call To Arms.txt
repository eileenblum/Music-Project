Bring it!

This is for you
This is the one
This is the now
This is forever
This is for you!

We all desire shelter
Friend and foe alike
We all live in strife
We all are born to suffer
Though we are strong in numbers
Everybody wants control
To best the opposition
Life with us submissive?
No!

This is for you
This is the one
This is the now
This is forever
This is for you!

They!
They will try
To end our reign
But they will fall
Into their graves
âWhat the fuck have we left to fight for if not ourselves in this fucked up war?!â
We are all thrown
Against our will
Into the throes
Eternal hell!

This is for you!
