So long! I'm cutting ties I'm blurring lines.
No more! Wasting my time on a selfish whore.
Damn right! I cut and run. I kill for fun.
Dead wrong! Never gonna tuck my tail and run!

Used to bleed for. Used to die for. Used to kill for. Your love!
Used to bleed for. Used to die for. Used to kill for.

Head first to hatred. Head first to hate.

So long! To the old me. I'm a new breed.
Hell spawned! Blood drunk on every wound endured.
Warpath! Annihilate these silly games.
Shotgun! Right to the face of this trepidation.

Used to bleed for. Used to die for. Used to kill for. Your love!
Used to bleed for. Used to die for. Used to kill for

Head first to hatred. Head first to hate.

Hatred!
