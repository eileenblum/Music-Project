Thereâs a secret place
My mind drifts away
Far from these sad scenes
Free of everything
In my secret place
I can feel no pain
No more shit parades
Or marching with the dead

I know itâs not much
But itâs everything to me

Falling deeper now
Visions much more clear
You wonât hurt me now
Iâm at peace right here
In my secret place
I can feel no pain
No more suffering
Freedom page by page

I know itâs not much
But itâs everything to me

I know itâs not much
But itâs everything to me!
I know! (In my suffering)
I know! (I will find peace)
At home! (In darkness)
At home! (In my own space)
No one! (Will find me here)
No one! (Will hurt me here)
At home! (In darkness)
Shadow! (Iâm returning!)
