I'm so tired of this place
Disdain written on my face
Had about all I can take
I admire those who broke away

Oh! I'm taking you down
Clip full of hatred and one in the chamber
Cock back, pull, and oh! It's all over
It's all over now

It seems I've lost all control
Vivid dreams of burying you all
One by one everyone falls
Death approaches and the darkness calls

Oh! I'm taking you down
Clip full of hatred and one in the chamber
Cock back, pull, and oh! It's all over. It's not over!
Yes, I'm taking you out!
Clip full of hatred and one in the chamber
Cock back, pull, and oh! It's all over. It's all over now!

I feel it's inside
It cuts like a knife right to the core again and I
I hate you, yes, every part of you now
Even in death I'll hunt you down
You liar. I'll burn. All you've ever loved
And smile as it all comes crumbling down
I'm taking you out now
It's all over so over now
It's all over
