Who do you think you are?
Youâre big talk. Youâre no walk.
I see right through those scars
Slit wrists, get pissed, now get this
Liar. Parasite. Itâs all over now for you
I know what youâre about
Get up. Get off. Get on this and go!
Circle the drain into your damnation

Guess whatâ¦now youâre fucked!
Itâs all over now for you
I know what youâre about
Slit wrists, get pissed, now get this
Liar. Parasite. Itâs all over now for you
I know what youâre about
Get up. Get off. Get on this and go!
Get up and go!
Bow before your messiah
Youâre false idols. Go!
Get up and go!
Run before itâs all over
Your worlds falling

[Repeat first verse]
[Repeat first chorus]

Run! For your life! Itâs over now!
This! Ends tonight! Itâs all aground!
Whereâs your god now?
None in sight!
This! Pale lit sky! A crimson knife!

Run!
[random ramblings]

Circle! Circle! The drain yeah!

Circle the drain to your damnation
