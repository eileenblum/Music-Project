I'm not the person that I've lead you to perceive.
I'm just a servant to a set of false beliefs.
A slave indeed I am to my false identity.
I'm just a product of a construct built by enemies!

Screaming. Crying. Spinning. Spiraling. Downward. Just a coward. No! [x2]

I admire how you follow your heart strings.
Envious I am I used to be the same way.
Maybe one day clarity will come in waves.
Until that moment I will wallow in zero space!
