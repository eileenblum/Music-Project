Gradually I will erase all of those memories
Of us, of them of this whole place
I just need room the breathe
Iâve lied everyday of my life
Not with words but silence
If you could see what lies beneath
Well then Iâll tell you this

That I know what you donât know [x2]

I separate myself
I will not be enslaved
By worthless drama fiends breeding diseases
Pride will be your downfall
The nail in your coffin
I could go on but youâre not worth my time

If you could see all that I keep buried inside
It would change all that you believe in your life
Iâm not about to confess or explain my history
And if I do it still remains

That I know what you donât know
Yes I know what you donât know

If you could see all that I keep buried inside so deep
It would change all that you believed about integrity
These eyes theyâve lied a thousand times
Throughout and on through life
An honest shade of blue and pale
And doth the devils will

That I know what you donât know

Iâm escaping the monster you made me
Erasing the memories that brought me to this place
Yes I know what you donât know.
