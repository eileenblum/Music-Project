[Bonus track]

We all walk through this life
On this stage of pain
Given only a chance to make the best
That chance was all you need

Always wandering what's best for us
You fought for us
And whole life spent protecting
What you forever said

Farewell and go in peace
We will always remember you
Don't worry, don't you cry
Cause where a star shines on me
I will know, that it's you...

What you've been through I can't erase
Most times life was hard and senseless
Never ending pain always looking back
It's was all too much for your broken heart

Heavens bell rang, you heard a call
You were all alone
Go to the light, don't be afraid
Cause pain ends here at your gates

Farewell and go in peace
We will always remember you
Don't worry, don't you cry
Cause where a star shines on me
I will know, that it's you...

Farewell and go in peace
We will always remember you
Don't worry, don't you cry
Cause where a star shines on me
I will know

I know, I'll find you
The sky is so bright tonight
Don't worry, don't you cry
Cause when the gates open again
I'll be there, for you
I'll be there for you
Forever, for you...
