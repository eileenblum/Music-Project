Running wild through the years
Through the years outlived and gone
Tomorrows dream is far from true
Everyone expect so much from you

For every thing you ever did
And everything you'll ever do
They had it all planed out for you

Living under darkest skies
We are victims of the future
There will be no last good byes
See the signs

But well keep fighting on and on
Just let your heart to lead the way
Oh be brave don't turn to stone
On this holy ground well forever stay

It rains it rains
But well keep holding on through years
Don t pray just stay
For all of us there's a better day
Don't stop to dream
Dreams are keeping as alive
The nations calling you

The past is there for all to see
Never forget those who died for you and me
Like the eagles we will fly free

And well keep fighting on and on
Just let your heart to lead the way
Oh be brave, don't turn to stone
On this holy ground well forever stay

It rains it rains
But well keep holding on through years
Don't pray just stay
For all of us there's a better day
Don't stop to dream
Dreams are keeping as alive
The nations calling you
