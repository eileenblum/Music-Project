Rejected by society
I live as your shadow
Though maybe I'm afraid
To you it doesn't matter

Do you know how it feels
When the ghost of street is calling your name
All the lights are out
You're all alone again

I am the outcast
Always walk the streets alone
I am the outcast
Without a brother or a home
The outcast
I fight to survive

Always live your life
Like others tell you to
Don't break the rules
Nothing will ever change

Destruction and decay
Crush the earth every day
And all the things that matter
Are simply wiped away

I am the outcast
Always walk the streets alone
I am the outcast
Without a brother or a home
The outcast
I fight for you

I am the outcast
Always walk the streets alone
I am the outcast
Without a brother or a home
Fighting the outcast
You are living for the dawn
I am the outcast
Without a brother or a home
The outcast
I am the outcast
