We ride the winds of pain and destruction
Millenniums are coming and going to waste
The stars don't even bother to look at us anymore
It is the thunder the sign of a deadly core

Nothing in the future will give us hope
Horizons black and burning down
No one will ever take us for what we are not
The sails are set to rise or fall

Forever storm we are
One storm forever
Forever storm we will be
The one for all eternity

Passing of the years will seal all the dreams
The dreams are there just to remind us
Of the person that we used to be
A lost child in the pouring rain

Forever storm we are
One storm forever
Forever storm we will be
The one for all eternity

Sometimes I bleed
Reveal the wounds of long lost battles
Some times I cry
Reflecting all the fears of life
Why cant we see
That this world was made for you and me
Were here to belong
Were here to belong not to destroy

Forever storm we are
One storm forever
Forever storm we will be
The one for all eternity
