Wandering the maze of this garden in black
Shapes of gray undefined and terrifying
Paths change on the way tell me why
Sky isn't there when I look tell me why

Once again you're the one
The selfish fool who runs
Tell me why, then leave me die
Enclose my mind again once again

Posses the gift that you don't want
Blinded by reasons you fall asleep
Dream of what they tell you to
Awaken in your world of cold reality

Once again you're the one
The selfish fool who runs
Tell me why then leave me die
Enclose my mind again once again

Throw me down throw yourself
Back to where it all began
Forsaken what you were blessed with
Well burn together on their stake
