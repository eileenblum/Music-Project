While the sun sets
And the moon rise above the clouds
The battle starts
Raging thunder lights the battleground
Hell is the name of this world of none

Blood runs through the battlefield
The taste of victory is in the air, in the air

Fight for one and all
Oh, oh
And fight for freedom
We will march on and on
Throw this crimson storm
Cause our glory lies in the battle cry

Let the lightning struck
And let the heavens fall
But we will never crawl
Raise your swords and fight from the heart
And we will take no prisoners

Blood runs throw the battlefield
The winning screams are calling me, calling me

Fight for one and all
Oh, oh
And fight for freedom
We will march on and on
Throw this crimson storm
Cause our glory lies in the battle cry

Fight for one and all
Oh, oh
And fight for freedom
We will march on and on
Throw this crimson storm
Cause our glory lies in the battle cry
