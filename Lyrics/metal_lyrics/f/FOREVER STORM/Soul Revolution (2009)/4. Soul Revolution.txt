So many years have passed, still you're in our dream
You're living silent, you're living unseen
Here you sigh and beg to see, what you've been struggling to be
Don't tell me you believe what I see
(What do I see?)

I see the world through your eyes
Blinded by the false redemption
But in my mind, I hear the cries of
Freedom, it's the soul revolution

They are controlling us, telling us all what to be
What you try to understand is nothing but a dream
A dream that's made to haunt you and take your hopes away
Nightmare that's made to show you that your fight is in vain
(So are you afraid?)

I see the world through your eyes
Blinded by the false redemption
But in my mind, I hear the cries of
Freedom, it's the soul revolution
