How can you see it
When your eyes are shut?
How can you know it
When your mind is closed?
How can you fly
When your wings are made of dust?
How can you die
When your life is over before it starts?

Every day you look away
And every time itâs the same

Youâre made of lies
Youâll never reach the morning light
And open your eyes
Your bloody ties
Will never chain my soul
Never still my heart

Now look around you
And tell me what you see
Take a look at the world
That you have left to bleed
Rip your heart away
And spill the blood
On this ground that you
Never cared about

Never look my way
Better kneel down and pray

Youâre made of lies
Youâll never reach the morning light
And open your eyes
Your bloody ties
Will never chain my soul
Never still my heart
