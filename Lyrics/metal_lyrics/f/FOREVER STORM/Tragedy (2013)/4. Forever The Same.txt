Time - never will I find it
Doesnât mind, thereâs no tomorrow

Only stains in the dark
And all you see are lies
Spread across the land
Where people live and die in despair

Wasting all we could be
Drowning in this tragedy

Forever the same
Weâll never find the way back home
So weâll face the end of our road
The storm is closer, the night is near
We fall asleep forever

Guilt brought upon me
By those who want me to follow
But they donât know what they do
Destroying the future for me and you

Forever the same
Weâll never find the way back home
So weâll face the end of our road
The storm is closer, the night is near
We fall asleep

Fear next to nothing
Worn by those so hollow
Greed blinding their eyes
So they canât see, they canât see

Forever the same
Weâll never find the way back home
So weâll face the end of our road
The storm is closer, the night is near
We fall asleep

Forever the same
Weâll never find the way back home
So weâll face the end of our road
The storm is closer, the night is near
We fall asleep
Forever
