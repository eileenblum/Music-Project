Restless storm shadows the sun
Helplessly the light dies down

A silent scream spreads on through the
night
One more time struggling in a fight

Of being me
Of who I am
You want to know?
Just take my hand

So many dreams
Donât understand
Just follow me
And take a stand

On and on, Iâll lead the way
And show you what weâve done today
Weâre near the end and all is lost
So now you know what is the cost

If only you could now
If only you could go
And live your life
Beyond this pain

But now itâs too late
Now you found yourself
And you see the signs

Itâs who we are
Itâs how we bleed
But in the end
That isnât what we see

Wanting more
Never-ending needs
Killing love
In every being

On and on, Iâll lead the way
And show you what weâve done today
Weâre near the end and all is lost
So now you know what is

This is my last tragedy
This is our last tragedy

On and on, Iâll lead the way
And show you what weâve done today
Weâre near the end and all is lost
So now you know what is

On and on, the sky will fall
Our own greed will kill us all
The time has come for us to see
That this is our reality
A tragedy
