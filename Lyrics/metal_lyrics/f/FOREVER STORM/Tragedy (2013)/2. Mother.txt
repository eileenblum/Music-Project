All the time they see the signs
Every day and donât wonder why
Can they really hear the screams
From the top of your tired lungs?

Every day I watch you die
Every night I hear you cry
Every time theyâre leaving you behind

Hear me, donât fear me
Take me in your arms of love
Mother, youâre torn asunder, going under
Their burning minds

You gave them life and let them breathe
Forgave them all for what they did
Your rivers flow and flowers bloom
All in vain, theyâre signing your doom

Ravaging and shattering
Burning fields and lands of free
Still you find a will to carry on

Hear me, donât fear me
Take me in your arms of love
Mother, youâre torn asunder, going under
Their burning minds of dust

We are dust
We are dust

Hear me, donât fear me
Take me in your arms of love
Mother, youâre torn asunder, going under
Their burning minds

Hear me, donât fear me
Take me in your arms of love
Mother, youâre torn asunder, going under
Their burning minds of dust
