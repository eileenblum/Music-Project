I see the world in ruins
I see it die in flames
Every day this image reappears

The savior is too late
We never see him coming
Bound to relive the same tragedy

It is meant for us to bleed
Meant for us to bleed

When death comes alive
Everything shall die
Every voice will sigh
All lifeâs deprived
When death comes alive
All reasons denied

Another soldier died in vain
One more mother drowns in her pain
Another year goes by in an endless cry
Death is there and we canât see

We are not supposed to be
Not supposed to be

When death comes alive
Everything shall die
Every voice will sigh
All lifeâs deprived
When death comes alive
All reasons denied

Crumbling down, destruction bound
Painful colors in our eyes
But itâs our nature and itâs our curse
To see the beauty in our fall

When death comes alive
Everything shall die
Every voice will sigh
All lifeâs deprived
When death comes alive
