[Digital Edition Bonus Track]Will you kiss a storm grey sky?
Wonât you taste a bitter lie?
When anywhere is nowhere at all
And thoughts are those that created you

Seasons change and you will too
And I hope that it isnât too late
All I ever wanted of you
Was to be yourself, to be me

Iâm going now and Iâm leaving forever
To where I was meant to be
I leave you here to fight your battles
Do you know where itâs leading?
And now you bleed when I say forever
Because you know itâs not a word
Iâll never be there to save you
But thatâs not what you deserve

Wonât you go where no one goes?
Will you ever think like me?
Would you ever find a way
To bring me back to seal your destiny?

Seasons change and you will too
And I hope that it isnât too late
All I ever wanted of you
Was to be yourself, to be me

Iâm going now and Iâm leaving forever
To where I was meant to be
I leave you here to fight your battles
Do you know where itâs leading?
And now you bleed when I say forever
Because you know itâs not a word
Iâll never be there to save you
But thatâs not what you deserve
