Since I remember Iâve fallen through the dark
The endless struggle within my troubled mind
Always thought the darkness was the key
To meaning, the will to be

You burned my heart with your lucid mind
And all the tales were left behind
I was floating over an endless sea
When flames of reason took all over me

Stay, stay, my savior, my sign
Touch, feel, this wounded soul of mine
Come, see, through my disguise
Iâm yours to keep, so be my demise

I want to spend the rest of my time
Walking beside you through this chaos
I want our love to be the cure for this earth
Where ruins we touch will find their rebirth

Stay, stay, my savior, my sign
Touch, feel, this wounded soul of mine
Come, see, through my disguise
Iâm yours to keep, so be my demise
