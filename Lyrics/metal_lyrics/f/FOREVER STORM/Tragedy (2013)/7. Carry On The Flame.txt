Life is waiting always there for you to come
In the universe of your unconscious mind
All the things we learned when we were young
Turned to be lies
So we must find ourselves beyond this vivid light

Look inside the night
And donât fear the shadows
Close your eyes and see
Beyond the borders

Carry on the flame of life
Carry on all that you are
Donât look back to see
What you could be
Just look inside you
And realize you are

All the years that passed away and all the nights you spent in pain
Reflect the time when you were asking questions
About the pieces of the world we couldnâtâ save
About all the chances we let slip away

Look inside the night
And donât fear the shadows
Close your eyes and see
Beyond the borders

Carry on the flame of life
Carry on all that you are
Donât look back to see
What you could be
Just look inside you
And realize
