In pain I travel all alone
Between the mountains of blood and bone
City of vultures calling me
And brings me closer to its walls

Misty road in front of me
Reeks of ashes and decay
My cape is black
My hands are blood
Of those who didnât care
To know my name

Donât want to be trapped inside
Donât want to know their reasons why
Donât want to be lost forever

My temple falls as the days goes by
Lost on the shores of the sea of lies
Seeking refuge in the same old scars
But still again I play my part

As I reach the gates of black
Dying whispers lead ahead
I feel my heart turn to stone
As I enter

Lurid colors burn my eyes
As I walk towards the line between the
Dead manâs stare and poisoned air
Hey, stranger, help me find my way

Open the door and let me in
I want to sell you all my sins
I want to show you where Iâve been

My temple falls as the days goes by
Lost on the shores of the sea of lies
Seeking refuge in the same old scars
But still again I play my part

Forget who you are
And go so far
Donât try to turn around
They will tear your soul apart

My temple falls as the days goes by
Lost on the shores of the sea of lies
Seeking refuge in the same old scars
But still again I play my part
