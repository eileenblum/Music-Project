Hey! Do you ever think of what could be?
Wake up, take a breath and follow me
Lock the door as you leave the sanctuary
Close your mind to the taste of betrayal

And here we stand waiting for the night to come
Now here we lay bleeding, but not for long

Far away from the pain
We try to seize the day
By the night the flame will burn
The skies await for our return
We will return

Hey! Iâm speaking to you
Do you hear my voice or you still believe Iâm not you?
Screaming inside your mind
Can you see me clear or you still believe that you are blind?

And here we stand on the verge of no return
This is the time to spread your wings and fly away

Far away from the pain
We try to seize the day
By the night the flame will burn
The skies await for our return
We will return

We will return
We will return
Before the dreams are crushed and burned
We will return
We will return
To find a place where we will learn
To be who we are
To live how we feel
To bleed for the freedom that is real

Far away from the pain
We try to seize the day
By the night the flame will burn
The skies await for our return
We will return
