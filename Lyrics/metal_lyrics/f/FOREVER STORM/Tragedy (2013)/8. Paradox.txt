The night falls around my heart
The dark engraves another scar
Every time wondering
Why is this happening?

The gates open a path in lies
To land of dust and polluted skies
The dread imprisons my darkened mind
Letting loose the ties that bind

More it hurts to feel the pain
Knowing you are causing it

Iâm losing you, losing myself
To this demon called vanity
Every day more I die
Killing what keeps me alive

Once again the new day dawns
Weary I take the hit of reality
But now I know you bleed the same
Iâll keep you safe and kill you in the end

Amazingly you see the future
While youâre destroying it

Iâm losing you, losing myself
To this demon called vanity
Every day more and die
Killing what keeps me alive
