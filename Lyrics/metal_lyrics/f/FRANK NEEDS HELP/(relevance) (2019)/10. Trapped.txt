Get out of my head

Fuck!

The wheel of thoughts has me again
I'm trapped in a prison of fear
Release me

I'm just a sketch drawn by my own nightmares
Me versus me
This is the worst pain I've ever felt
Days become nights and nights become days

Come near! Come near!
Tell me that I'm still alive
Come near! Come near!
Teach me how to breathe again
Stay close! Stay close!
Don't let my lungs collapse
Stay close! Stay close!
Tell me who I really am

Break these chains

And as their eyes are closed, mine are open wide
The more I think the less I understand
As I whisper my prayers, she whispers his name
And as he drags her to bed, he drags me to my grave
Buried alive

Their happiness is my anger
Jealousy and frustration are conquering my mind
I am afraid of myself
I am afraid of myself

I want this pain to end

Let me be an overcomer
Let me be a conqueror

Come near! Come near!
Tell me that I'm still alive
Come near! Come near!
Teach me how to breathe again
Stay close! Stay close!
Don't let my lungs collapse
Stay close! Stay close!
Tell me who I really am

I'd rather hear nothing than these demons in my head
