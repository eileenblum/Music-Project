Denial and hate

Your head is full but your heart is empty
Your voice is loud but your spirit is silent
Looking for words to serve the masses

You want to build a bridge where you built a wall
You want to heal their scars with knives and swords
Why don't you collapse under your own dishonesty?

You're looking for persecution
You're looking for the opposition
Even if it's not there, you'll always find it
You just need something to point your finger at

You're a power-hungry product of hate
Trying to suppress the past
You're a power-hungry product of hate
Hoping for recognition

Pretender!

Write a verse on the anchor tied to my feet
I'm still gasping
You're not gonna save me

You're a robot in an ignorant culture
You're a puppet looking for strings to pull yourself

You think you're an ambassador
But it's just a neuroparasite
You think you're an ambassador
But there's just a parasite in your head

You're a power-hungry product of hate
Trying to suppress the past
You're a power-hungry product of hate
Hoping for recognition

You won't save yourself from drowning

How can you carry on?
How can you carry on like this?
