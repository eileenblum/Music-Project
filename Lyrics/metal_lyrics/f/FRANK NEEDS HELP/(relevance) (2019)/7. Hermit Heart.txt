Time flies by
It feels like
You have to cut a part of your heart out
And throw it in the bin of oblivion
With the side effect of getting dull (getting dull)

Those well-known roads, you won't walk them down with the same vivid mind
Nothing will prepare you - you get thrown in at the deep end (the deep end)

Back in the days, experimenting with the engine of life
Fueled by the emotions I had
No damage expected

But failure and adverse impact waiting behind the doors
But failure and adverse impact waiting behind the doors

Surrounded by prejudice and hate
A shell for protection began to grow
A shell for protection began to grow

Confusion - disturbance
I feel the havoc in my head
The genesis of insecurity

I wish there was a chance to warn my former self

Back in the days, experimenting with the engine of life
Fueled by the emotions I had
But the damage of failure and overestimation
Made me bring that fuel back into the basement
