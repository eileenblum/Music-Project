I am a clown, I can't stop smiling
I am a clown, I forgot how to laugh

I am afraid of being afraid
Draw a smile on my face and I'll be the king of this role play
No one can see the slave behind it

Bury me and my happiness
Sadness is what I long for

What have we become?
Nothing is real
Nothing is true
Where is our honesty?
Our image becomes our personality

Welcome to the circus
Where the clowns are crying behind the curtains
Welcome to the circus
Where faces are smiling and souls are weeping

I am a clown
I cause you to laugh
Even if I don't know what it actually feels like
I am a clown
I can't stop smiling
But I forgot how to laugh

Don't tell me how I should feel
Those feelings are the result of this chaos
It's hard to always deliver as expected
Don't force me to smile when my head is at war
Give me back the freedom I need
Let me take off my mask
Let my tears be physical again
I'm not a robot - I'm still human
