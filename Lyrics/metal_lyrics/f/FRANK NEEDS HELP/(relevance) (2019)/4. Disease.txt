Terror to the living nature
'Til our own obliteration

Not just suicide
Besides harming what we need to survive
We bring suffering and death to our fellow beings

Suffering and death to our fellow creations
Driven by selfishness and the lack of emotional warmth

Exhausting the source of life
There is nothing more important than us
Exhausting the source of life
If there's no instant harm, where is the problem?
Exhausting the source of life
The greed drowns our prudence
Exhausting the source of life
One day, we'll pay for everything we've done
Sadly, not every culprit - just the last of us

Change will be to late
No salvation

We are the cancer on our mother's skin

Exhausting the source of life
The greed drowns our prudence
Exhausting the source of life
We'll pay for everything we've done (everything we've done)

Misbehaving like an outrageous guest
Creating a mess, despite being marvelously hosted
Her tears of disappointment and sorrow
Will turn into an outburst of rage

Disgusting
All the pain we cause
And the scars we leave
Mother - when it is no longer bearable for you
I'm sure you'll find a cure to erase us fungi

Wipe us off your shoulder when it's time for you to heal
