[feat. Colin Staeger]Endless wandering
In the woods of insecurity
Looking for a way out
To find a place to rest

Tired legs from chasing rays of light
In hopes of finding a gate
To escape this empty space
Exhausted from obscurity

I was sure, outside I'll find the potion of existence
Finally, I'll be relieved from this fucking malady

Illusions
Nothing changed
Took a bite of an apple rotten to the core
A deceptive hope out of desperation
The only thing I felt was suffocation

I've had to learn
That time can't cure eternal longing
That time can't cure eternal longing

Salvation

But what could I do to achieve the goals I've learnt to strive for?
Better stop running after something you cannot catch

In the wake of the obscure, the shadows come crawling in
Staring faithlessly ahead, doubting memories of past
Far out in the sea of dread, almost drowning from the weight of regret
A glance into the future, uncertainty of the light to come
Forlorn at hand, for misery can't be undone

Where am I?
Reeling in a dense fog
I can't find a path
Try to prospect back in the woods

It seemed so dark
I used to hide it from myself

Take a flashlight
Shine a light at your surroundings
Look closer
And find the beauty of those common colours

Ignored the essence of fulfillment
Driven by fear

Salvation
