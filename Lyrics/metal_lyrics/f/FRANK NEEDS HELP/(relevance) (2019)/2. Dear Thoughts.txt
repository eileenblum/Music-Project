This is a war
This a battlefield
Raging inside of me

Help me

Dear thoughts
Why do you hate me so much?
You allow these demons to whisper in my ears
They keep repeating what I am afraid of
They keep repeating what I am afraid of

I try to run away
But I can't flee from myself
I try to hide
But I always find me

I sink when I think
And I think when I sink

It seems so easy to stop
I am the one at the wheel
But somehow, I have no control

This is a war
This a battlefield
Raging inside of me

Help me
I can't find a way out of this darkness
By myself

Tell me
Who's fighting with me?
Who causes these wounds?
