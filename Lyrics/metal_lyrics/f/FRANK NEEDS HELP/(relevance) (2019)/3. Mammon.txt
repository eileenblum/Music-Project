[feat. Ryan Kirby]They call me king
I've reached everything
Bow down before me and kiss my feet
King - I've reached everything
The mountains you climb are not as high as mine

I burn dollars - just to watch them burn
I am beautiful - that's what the surgeon says
Women's skin is what I like to smell
They scratch my back and scream my name

Love me - admire me
Your dreams are my reality

Lies - all lies

The truth is - I am dead inside
Broken
Weak

I drank the water of society but my soul still thirsts for more
And if I had everything they want to own
My heart would still be empty

Rescue me

Under pressure
Under pressure of ideals and performance expectations since my young years

I thought
I've reached everything
Still I have nothing but a broken soul
King
I've reached everything
Everything's nothing - I'm a slave of my "success"

I am a teacher who has never been taught
I am a father who has never been a son
I am a castle with closed doors
No one can see the inside
I was looking for the life everybody dreamed of
I found it, it's a nightmare
