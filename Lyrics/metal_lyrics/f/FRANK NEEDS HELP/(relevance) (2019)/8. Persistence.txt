Why should I continue a puzzle
With way too many pieces missing?
What if we can't get any further?
Will it be worth it?
Or just trying in vain?

This house will never be built.
These walls will fall again and again.
Cannonballs of inhumanity break down our construct of peace.

We are builders standing in the line of fire.
We keep building on (keep building on)
We'll pick up the pieces
And try to fit them in
This all may sound senseless - but a small roof also protects from rain

No surrender
Even if there is no way to turn the tables

Light up
This dark place
To find the ones to suffer

We live in a reality where peace is an illusion
We live in a reality where peace is an illusion
But I'd rather adhere to an illusion
Than being passively involved in a bloodshed
