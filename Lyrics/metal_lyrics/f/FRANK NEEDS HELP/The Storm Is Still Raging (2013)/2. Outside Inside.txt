A big red dragon on his skin
His look is dark
His hair is red and long
Metal in his mouth
Metal in his ears
He wears black with skulls on it

Oh my god addiction
Violence
He's so evil
His soul must be black
If he even has one

Do you have the eyes of god?
Because I think you don't know his heart

Have you ever seen the color of his soul?
Do you know his story?
Have you ever seen anything else then the outside?
Then tell me
What gives you the right to judge?

Outside inside, there is a difference

You don't have to look like spick and span to have a heart

Have you ever seen the color of his soul?
Do you know his story?
Have you ever seen anything else then the outside?
Then tell me
What gives you the right to judge?
