I live in a beautiful house with a really big garden
Friendly handshakes with my neighbors
No shouting over the fence
Steel around my house, my walls are solid
My world is beautiful and safe

But I need a sniper on the roof, a tank in the garden and a guardian in the kitchen

I want more and on my way to the store there are voices begging for life
No life for you
I need the bread to feed my death machine

Watch this, my neighbor's got a helicopter
Although I have bad cards, I want to be part of this senseless game I can't win
Gambling empties my pockets
It looks like declaring war on nothing

A second sniper on the roof, another tank in the garden and one more guardian in the kitchen

I want more and on my way to the store there are voices begging for life
No life for you.
I need the bread to feed my death machine.
