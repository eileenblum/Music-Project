The storm is still raging !
Tears will still fall !
You're not in heaven
Not at all
Yes, I know this is a new beginning
But no, you can't put your rose-coloured glasses on !
This is still life, this is still earth! It's not heaven !
The storm is still raging !
Tears will still fall
My friend it's not heaven
Not at all
But there's a helping hand, there's a healer, there's a savior at your side!

He is the crutch for the broken, the light in the dark
Life won't be perfect, but his hands will hold you
FOREVER !
He remains steadfastly at your side !

The storm is still raging
Tears will still fall
But there is a healer
At your side

And he loves you !
