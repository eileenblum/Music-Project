Blood, the holy blood flows through us all but today's society cannot see it

All they want is money, but if there are bad times cash can't help them, can't you see?!
I pray for this world so they may see: Mr. Rich's love isn't real love. I pray for this world so they may see: only God's love is real love

So it's time to shout out what we believe in, so it's time to tell the world, what real love is

So I do believe although the world is trying to keep me away from his love (but) he'll never let me go

I AM A BELIEVER

Clock, every clock has a maker, look how finely it is crafted every piece is In the right place

But as far as creation is concerned, many people claim that all the universe is a coincidence.

But I do not

So it's time to shout out what we believe in, so it's time to tell the world: you're not an accident.

So I do believe although the world is trying to keep me away from his love (but) he'll never let me go

I AM A BELIEVER
