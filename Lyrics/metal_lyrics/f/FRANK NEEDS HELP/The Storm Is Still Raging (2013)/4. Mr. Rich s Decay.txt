There is this world and yourself and your millions, but nothing else, but nothing else.
You don't care about anything else but your sodden cash.
You don't give but take away.

Do you think it's helpful to watch the poor kids on TV (on your 9000-dollar-seat)?
You watch this disaster and you shout to god:
"Can't you hear them calling? Can't you hear them screaming?
Why don't you give them the cash they need to live? "

You fool! Fool!

You've got money but no heart, you've got millions on your card, but no friends and no god, am I jealous? No, I'm not!

Ill, that's what you are now. You're deadly ill! You can't escape, you can't escape.
Can you feel the bitter taste of the life you have lived?
Now you want mercy! Mercy!

You've got money but no heart, you've got millions on your card, but no friends and no god, am I jealous? No, I'm not!
