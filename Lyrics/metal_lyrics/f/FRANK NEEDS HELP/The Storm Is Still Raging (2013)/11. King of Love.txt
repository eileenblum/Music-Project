Destroy the hate there's too much of it in this world
So take your flame of love
And burn down the gates of hell.

Torture, death, resurrection
This is love

Destroy the vanity there's too much of it in this world
So let us share the bread
Like the one who is love

He's the king of love
Let's follow the king

Torture, death, resurrection
This is love
