It happened many years ago
But it's still in his head
You kicked him
You hurt him
You didn't respect him every day

And now he's coming back
He's coming back with the past in his mind
Now he's coming back
He's coming back! There's a voice in your head
I will pay for it
Yeah I will go down for what I did to him

You look out of your window
He's walking towards your house
You're now swimming in a sea of fear
Revenge

And now he's coming back
He's coming back with the past in his mind
Now he's coming back
He's coming back! There's a voice in your head
I will pay for it
Yeah I will go down for what I did to him

His hands are clenched
As he stands in front of your door
What is he going to do with me?

You open the door and there he stands
You expect his fist married with your face
But he just shows a cross and all he says is:

I forgive you

Like he would

Let's change the world
This is the reLOVEution
