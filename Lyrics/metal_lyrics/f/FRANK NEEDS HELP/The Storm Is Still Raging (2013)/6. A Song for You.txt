Listen, this song is for you
I wrote it because my heart beats like drum n bass
When I think of you
There is a void inside of me
I need you to fill up this emptiness
Damn I want you here with me

When I look into your eyes
It feels like heaven, all the pain is forgotten
When you're by my side
When you're by my side
Butterfly overdose in my stomach

Why can't you feel the same?
God make her feel the same

All I have to say is: I've fallen in love with you
And all I want you to know: you're so wonderful
And I won't give up I won't let you go
An army of butterflies forced me to write this song

Yesterday I thought of you, now I'm thinking of you, tomorrow I'll think of you
This is not normal
Your beauty is conquering my brain and heart

And all I have to say is: I've fallen in love with you
And I want you to know: you're so wonderful
And I won't give up I won't let you go
An army of butterflies forced me to write this song

I would do everything
Just for one kiss
I would do everything
Just to hold you in my arms
I would do everything
Just to be with you
I would do everything
Because I love you
