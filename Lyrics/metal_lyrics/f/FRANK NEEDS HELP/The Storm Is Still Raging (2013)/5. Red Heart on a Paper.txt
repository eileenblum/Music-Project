Where is your love
You preach about?

You're holding up a red heart on a paper
The words from your mouth are about love
Let us all live in love
But there's no place in this church for two male hearts longing for each other
There's no place in this church for a girl in need, because she has a kid and no ring on her finger

Your words are just words
They've never met your heart
Preaching about love doesn't mean to condemn those your eyes don't want to see
Do you think you're better?

Where is your love
You preach about
Remember the one who gave love to those nobody wanted
Where is your love
You preach about
Look at the one who loves everybody the same

Where is your love?

You smash down the red heart on a paper
The words from your mouth are about hate
You sinners go to hell

Where is your love
You preach about
Remember the one who gave love to those nobody wanted
Where is your love
You preach about
Look at the one who loves everybody the same

Where is your love?

Now let us stand up for unity and love
We are all the same
Nobody's unwanted
You're wonderful

Now let us stand up for unity and love
We are all the same
Nobody's unwanted
You're wonderful
