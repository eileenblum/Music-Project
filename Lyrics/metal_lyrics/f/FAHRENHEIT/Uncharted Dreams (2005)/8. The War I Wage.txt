All this time, how I longed to see
How you learn to fly,
Sometimes you run, others you can dream
But you never try

Take my hand, I can show you how,
Come on, take a chance,
How the skies open up for you, giving way to light.

This is what I say
I'm fighting tears of rage
The words that I say
In time you will wake

The war that I wage
I'm fighting tears of rage
The words that I say
In time you will wake

You have grown, standing on your own
Having built and strived,
And forgot that you're not alone
We lived side by side.

We went away, barely left a trace
Vanished in the night,
Wishing you'd overcome your fear
Now that we came back

This is what I say
I'm fighting tears of rage
The words that I say
In time you will wake

The war that I wage
I'm fighting tears of rage
The words that I say
In time you will wake

This is what...
