Reaching to the skies,
I try to finally see you shine,
Whenever night returns,
I follow my dreams.
Starshine,
Your gaze serene as melody
Is what I need,
It's all I want for me...

Bright lights,
Bedazzle with intensity,
And running hard,
I'm blind and seeking still.

I cry,
And beg of you to light the way,
Don't let me fall again
So help me see...

Take the pain away,
I'll believe in you, I will hear you sing,
Please become the missing piece
In me.

Daylight,
It shatters every mistery,
The morning comes,
Again, reality.
You're nowhere to be seen,
There's nothing there,
No simmetry,
An empty mirror still in front of me.

Bright lights,
Bedazzle with intensity,
And running hard,
I'm blind and seeking still.

I cry,
And beg of you to light the way,
Don't let me fall again
So help me see...

Take the pain away,
I'll believe in you, I will hear you sing,
Please become the missing piece
In me.
