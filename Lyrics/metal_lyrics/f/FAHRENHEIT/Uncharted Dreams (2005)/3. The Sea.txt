Where are the dreams of a promising land,
Now that I'm here to survive on my own?
The sky has fallen down,
There's nothing but gray.

I stare at the sea
Longing to be free
Of this wicked misery
That I have to face to live

I can barely fight the cold,
What is wrong, God save my soul,
Nothing's what is used to be,
All I've left are memories.

You said "forgive me son,
I can't undo what I have done,
Too late to turn away,
I'm sorry is all that I can say".

I stare at the sea
Longing to be free
Of this wicked misery
That I have to face to live
