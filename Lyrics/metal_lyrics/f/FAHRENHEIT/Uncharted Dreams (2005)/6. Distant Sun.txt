Looking up,
Eyes still clouded by memories;
Wondering, how dust
Covered the mighty king.
Rays barely coming down
In meager weaves;
I brace myself,
Fending off the raging wind.

(It) Won't be long now,
How can I not give in...

Tearing at
My fate and hands,
Mad giants from the sands
Wearing out my will ever so slowly.
Strenght is leaving,
Strenght is leaving me...
In the end I'll have to let all go...

(Bis) (It) Won't be long now,
How can I not give in...

Nothing to hold on, wildly swimming on
Towards a distant sun,
Time and space have lost their meaning;
There's no way to know, nothing to fight back
And nowhere to turn,
Will I go that high? Or when will I fall?

Looking out, finding my way,
Trying to tell up from down;
My head misses having some solid ground,
Somewhere to stand on,
Something to show me the way,
Right at the end I had to let all go...

(Bis) (It) Won't be long now,
How can I not give in...

Nothing to hold on, wildly swimming on
Towards a distant sun,
Time and space have lost their meaning;
There's no way to know, nothing to fight back
And nowhere to turn,
Will I go that high? Or when will I fall?
