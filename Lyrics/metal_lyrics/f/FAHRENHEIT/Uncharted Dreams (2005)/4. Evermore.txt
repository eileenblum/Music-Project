Walking on the longest road,
How many times have I begun?
So many reasons to go on
Or stay behind;

Fighting back my darkest fears
And hanging on through all these years,
Giving everything for just a dream...

Where is the road that leads me to
Evermore?
How can't be reality?
I'll see it brightly burning, eternal grow;
How far thw swim to reach the shore?

I see now, and the pain is gone,
No more doubt in my way;
Evermore, closer to the shore,
I will get there someday.

Every place that where I have been,
An invitation to believe
That what I dream was never meant to be;
But I know within my soul,
There is a place to call my own.
No matter what it takes, someday I'll see.

Where is the road that leads me to
Evermore?
How can't be reality?
I'll see it brightly burning, eternal grow;
How far thw swim to reach the shore?

I see now, and the pain is gone,
No more doubt in my way;
Evermore, closer to the shore,
I will get there someday.

I see now, and the pain is gone,
No more doubt in my way;
Evermore, closer to the shore,
I will get there someday.

I will get there someday.
