Where do I stand now?
Fire burning in my veins,
My clothes are torn down, I can't remember,
Covered in crimson,
I've never been in this place before,
My senses have opened
At night sleepless, and yet not awake...

There's no tomorrow,
It's something that I have to gain.
Will I be myself again?
A price to pay, alone I stand...

There's no tomorrow...

There's no tomorrow,
It's something that I have to face;
To not let myself be caged,
I'll fight my way, alone I stand...

I try to remember,
Recalling only nightmares of fury;
To hunt and be hunted,
I can't believe this would happen to me.

There's no tomorrow,
A curse or a gift, who can say?
This may take me to the grave;
A price to pay, alone I stand...

There's no tomorrow
It's something that I have to face;
Will I be myself again?
A price to pay, alone I stand...
