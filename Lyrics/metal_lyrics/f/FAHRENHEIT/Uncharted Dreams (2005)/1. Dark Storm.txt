My warrior you're ready to die,
On the land where your sword and your soul became one,
For the sake of your King and your kind,
You must prove that we will overcome.

The enemy is strong and is not of this world,
Bringing powerful weapons of magic and fear
Having no goal but destroying us all,
We must not let them come and succeed

Must unite
Push him back
Raise your arms
Fail and death is penalty

Ready your banners your armor and swords,
For the battle approaches you have to be strong.
A horrible sight is the size of their might
And our age could be lost in their wake...

Must unite
Push him back
Raise your arms
Fail and death is penalty

Here comes the dawn, here comes the rising sun,
There will be pain, strike them again.

Must unite
Push him back
Raise your arms
Fail and death is penalty

Here comes the dawn, here comes the rising sun,
Dark storm is gone, gone is the rain.
They come in vain, vengeful will be our blade,
There will be pain, strike them again.

Must unite
Push him back
Raise your arms
Fail and death is penalty
