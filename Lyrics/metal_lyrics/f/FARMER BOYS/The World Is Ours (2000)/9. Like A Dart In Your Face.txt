Personal regards
Like a dart
In your face

Whatever you might do
There's nothing left to lose
Or to take

I wave the long goodbye
And wonder if I'll die tomorrow
Or today

And whatever I do
There's no more fear to lose
Or to face
Anymore

Got time to kill
And I'm killing it slowly
Time like a dart in your face

Another poacher's day
The killer's on his way
To his duty

And nothing that I want
Will enter in his thoughts
Today

I want you to arrive
And look me in the eyes
Then just go away

But nothing that I want
Will enter in your thoughts
When the time
Comes to pay

Got time to kill
And I'm killing it slowly
Time like a dart
In your face

No time to kill
Is a desperate moment
Time like a dart
On its way

I never seem
To make you cry
To matter much
Or cross your mind

I don't want you
I don't want you

So take your aim between my eyes

And do what must be done

And then leave me,
Leave me alone
I...

...need time to kill
'cause I'm killing it slowly
Time like a dart
In your face

No time to kill
Is a desperate moment
Time like a dart
On its way
