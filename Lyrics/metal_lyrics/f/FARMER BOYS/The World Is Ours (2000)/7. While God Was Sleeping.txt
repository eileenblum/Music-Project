Seen things lately
I can't get off my mind
They frustrate me
And keep me up at night

Oh lord, does your watchful eye
See the news-every night
Via satellite on T.V.

While my god was sleeping
Pain was on the rise
When my heart stopped beating
God was far and sleeping

A lot like torture
As pleasant as it seems
A wheel of fortune
With sandy beaches and bad, bad dreams

Hey man, what's with your eyes
What do you see-from up so high
Are you hypnotized or just lazy

While my god was sleeping
Pain was on the rise
The blade that cuts so deeply
Made me realize

While my god was sleeping
Sleeping like a child
Who never said his vespers
He's sleeping now forever

I stopped to watch my life
To watch it passing by.

I love you god, I pay the price
I want to make this sacrifice forever

While my god was sleeping
Strangers lost their lives
When their hearts stopped beating

God was far and sleeping
While my god was sleeping
Sleeping like a child
Who never said his vespers
He's sleeping now forever
