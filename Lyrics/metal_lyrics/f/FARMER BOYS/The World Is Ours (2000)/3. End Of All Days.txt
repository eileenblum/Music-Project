Build a house on sand
And watch it sink
Into the ocean blue
Build a house of cards
And watch the wind blow through

Play a grown-up game
With grown-up names
And plastic surgery
Build a house on sand
And watch it disappear

All the plans you made
And prayers you prayed
Are lost in yesterday

This is the end
The end of all days
Marking time
For the very last day

Write a memo in your organizer
That nothing is for sure
Mark your calendar
And strike tomorrow through

All the plans you made
And prayers you prayed
Are lost in yesterday

Cause this is the end
The end of all days
Marking time
For the very last day

This is the end
The end of all days
Marking time
For the very last day

It's the end of all days...
