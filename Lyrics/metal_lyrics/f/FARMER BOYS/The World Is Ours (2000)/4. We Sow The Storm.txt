You close your eyes and walk out
Through the open door
You fold your hands together
On your knees once more

The heavens kiss you with a flame
It burns your skin but there's no pain
And it pours...

We sow the storm that is breaking up the sky
Oh
We sow the storm in your heart

You see the clouds as they assemble
Up on high
You feel the multitudes surround you
In the night

There's nothing here to buy or sell
There's only heaven and there's hell
And it pours...

We sow the storm that is breaking up the sky
Oh
We sow the storm in your heart

The dogs of war have business cards
And flesh for sale, by the pound
They chew until your bones are bare
With teeth that gleam like silverware
But...

We sow the storm that is breaking up the sky
Oh
We sow the storm in your heart

There's nothing here to buy or sell
There's only heaven and there's hell
