It's a new breed
A new breed of evil
Conceived in the moonlight
Breathing fire

Sweet fallen angel
Delectable stranger
And if you don't know me
Then show me

Infernal walls
Your perfect skin
The heat between your thighs within

Your tongue and mine
Can taste the sin
A brand new breed of evil breaks you in

I can smell your sweat
And I can feel you're wet
Delectable stranger
Please put me in danger

The gates to hell are open wide
You lead me there to come inside
And all the secrets that you hide
You show me

Infernal walls
Your perfect skin
The heat between your thighs within

Your tongue and mine
Can taste the sin
A brand new breed of evil breaks you in

Infernal walls
Your perfect skin
Your tongue and mine
Can taste the sin
