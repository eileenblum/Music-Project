A one-horse town
With one old traffic light
Hunted down
To a cheap
Motel

Your swollen eyes
Never, ever say die
As the sheets run red
Under me

If you ever leave me standing
Then
I've one last wish
Oh please, wrap the scarf around me
Red-white found me
For my life

They're all here
To pay their last respects
It's crystal clear
Only one
Way out

Your hand in mine
Never, ever say die
As the sheets run red
Under me

If you ever leave me standing
Then I've one last wish
Oh please, wrap the scarf around me
Red-white found me
For my life

Oh please, wrap the scarf around me
Red-white found me
For my life...
