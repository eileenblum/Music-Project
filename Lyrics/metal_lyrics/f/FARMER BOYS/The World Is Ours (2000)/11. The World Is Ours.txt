A world that will wrap you round a tree
Demons that keep you from your sleep
At night

And in the mirror all I see
Is someone who looks a lot like me
Tonight

This isn't a dream
Like some cheap novel at the airport
This is our life
The trial by fire

And it feels like winning again
And it feels like the beginning again
Now the world is ours

Strange how things turn out sometimes
The years in the wilderness are left
Behind

This is the return
This is the triumph over exile
Now it's our turn
All lessons learned

And it feels like winning again
And it feels like the beginning again
Now the world is ours again...
