All you do all
You've been through
Has put you where you are today

All you do
Is a photograph of you
Now do you like what's in the picture?

The time is now
There's no time for waiting around
You get one shot, don't run for cover
Until it's over

This is the good life now
This is the high life now
I can see with my own eyes
That it's a good, good life

The things you say
Day after day
Make all the difference in the world

The things you hate
Might never go away
But they can't win if you don't let them

The time is now
There's no time for hanging around
This your chance, take it with no doubt
And don't let go, now

This is the good life now
This is the high life now
I can see with my own eyes
That it's a good, good life

This is the good life now
This is the high life now
Can't you see with your own eyes
That it's a good, good life
