Am I wrong
To lay my hands on things that hurt
Was it right
To give my heart away
Am I wrong
To lay my eyes on things that burn
Was it right
To sell my soul for you

And will you weep like Jesus wept
The bitter tears when I am gone
And will you watch, will you be there
When I will rise for you

Will you stay
And watch me when I fall asleep
Will you pray
That God will save my Soul

And will you weep like Jesus wept
The bitter tears when I am gone
And will you watch, will you be there
When I will rise for the love of you

And will you weep like Jesus wept
The bitter tears when I am gone
And will you watch, will you be there
When I will rise for you
When I will rise for you
