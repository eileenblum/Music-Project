This Time they knew what they did
This Time they knew what they did
This Time they knew what they were doing the whole time
This Time they knew what they did
This Time they knew what they did
This Time they had their eyes wide open and their pants pulled down

You got religion - you gave it back
You got redemption - but you just gave it back
You got salvation - and you gave it back
I have seen enough and now I am coming back
And this time
No one gets out alive
Cause this time
You get crucified

It's time they learned what they did
It's time they learned what they did
It's time they finally got a little taste of just who they're fucking with

You got religion - you gave it back
You got redemption - but you just gave it back
You got salvation - and you gave it back
I have seen enough and now I am coming back
And this time
No one gets out alive
Cause this time
You get crucified
