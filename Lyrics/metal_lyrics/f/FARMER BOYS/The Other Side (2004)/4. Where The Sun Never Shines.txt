Deep in the ground
Where the sun never shines
You move your eyes
And you know you're still alive

We'll never share the pain
We'll never feel this way again
We'll never have to cry
Or ever say goodbye
And if the world should disappear
Don't be afraid I'll right here
I'll never leave your side
Buried here alive, with you

You never knew that I feel like I do
I brushed your lips
With a cold deadly kiss

We'll never share the pain
We'll never feel this way again
We'll never have to cry
Or ever say goodbye
And if the world should disappear
Don't be afraid I'll right here
I'll never leave your side
Buried here alive, with you
