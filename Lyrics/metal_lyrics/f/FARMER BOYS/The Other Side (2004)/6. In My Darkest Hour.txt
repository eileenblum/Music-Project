Can you forgive me
For all I've done
Give me absolution
Just this once
Take me in your arms
Back into your fold
Here where I belong
When the stars above
Start falling from
The crown that they adorn
I'll be waiting
In my darkest hour
When you were gone
When I lost the power
That I had won
Beyond the sky
Time passes me by
There where I belong
Start falling from
The crown that they adorn
I'll be waiting
When the earth stands still
And the end is fulfilled
I'll be waiting on the shore
