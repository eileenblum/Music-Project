I walk the earth with a devil at my side
I'm on my search and he's still not satisfied
He will not stop until he's not satisfied
I thought I should, I knew I could
After trial and error
The terror remains
I thought I could

I know you know
All the tears behind my fears
I know you know
All the tears behind my fears
Once and for all

Recognize the price I've paid
Now I turn the page
Now you feel my rage
I walked the earth with a devil at my side
I exposed the nerve holding all the lies
He'll feel my pain before he dies
My ways have changed
My life's rearranged

I know you know
All the tears behind my fears
I know you know
All the tears behind my fears
Once and for all

Recognize the price I've paid
I've been through it all
The rise and the fall
Once and for all
Recognize the price I've paid
Now I turn the page
Now you feel my rage
