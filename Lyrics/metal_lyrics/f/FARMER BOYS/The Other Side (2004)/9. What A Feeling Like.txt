Born to win
To win and win again
Ignore the pain inside
Blood and fame, bred and games
Keep the masses entertaint

A dirty job that someone's gotta do
Like me
So take me, break me
What a feeling like
You never had before
Leaves me reeling and hungering for...

The crowd, it roads
It screams for more and more
I feel its voice inside
Loosing time, loosing face
Attacking with amazing grace

A dirty job that no one else can do
Like me
So take me, break me
What a feeling like
You never had before
Leaves me reeling and hungering for

A feeling like
You never had before
Leaves me reeling and hungering for more
