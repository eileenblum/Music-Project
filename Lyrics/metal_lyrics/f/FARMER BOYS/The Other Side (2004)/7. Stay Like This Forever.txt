I see your eyes
Pupils so wide
I could fall into them
I see your lips
My fingertips
Only want to touch them
You swallow me
Like ecstasy
So delicious is this sin
The pornography
Between you and me
Is running down your chin

I could stay like this forever
With no end in sight
C'mon, let's stay like this together
In ecstatic delight
Don't go away
Into the day
Where the sun tells its lies
Stay here with me
Stay here where we're free
Where I float in your eyes

We ride the waves
Out of our brains
On the chemicals and sex
The music's loud
Our bodies proud
We are young, hungry wrecks
Your sweat tonight
Under the lights I want you again
A million ways
Before the day
Brings tonight to an end

I could stay like this forever
With no end in sight
C'mon, let's stay like this together
In ecstatic delight
Don't go away
Into the day
Where the sun tells its lies
Stay here with me
Stay here where we're free
Where I float in your eyes
I could stay like this forever
