Freezing, waking up alone
Starring, at the ceiling and the phone
Thinking, that this house once a home
Falling, for a hundred million miles
Shattered and broken, like a hundred million tiles
And there is something, there is something in my eyes

Come take a walk with me down
The trail of tears
Where legions have walked before
No one is ever alone on
This trail of tears
You're always at home

Listen to these words you'll never hear
We had perfection, and than you just disappeared
Now my eyes are burning, from trying to find you here
And fighting back the tears

Come take a walk with me down
The trail of tears
Where legions have walked before
No one is ever alone on
This trail of tears
You're always at home
