Take this kiss upon the brow
I'm departing from you know
Thus much let me avow
You outta belong her deem
Let my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away

In a night or a day
I'm pushing on on
It's stuff i can rest on
In a night or a day
We see our seam
Despite a dream within a dream

I stand amid the wall
Ever so of tormented shawl
With a hole within my hand
Had a few it's how they creep
Trough my fingers trough the deep
What I need what I weep

In a night or a day
I'm pushing on on
It's stuff i can rest on
In a night or a day
We see our seam
Despite a dream within a dream
