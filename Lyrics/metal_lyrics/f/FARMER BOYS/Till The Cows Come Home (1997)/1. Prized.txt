Nominate the sitting hens
While they cling to a screen wire
Watch them picking with their cut-off bills
Crown he fattest, crown the best
Breeding brooder that contest
In the competition that you give
Let's play a losing game
Versus the sickness and versus the pain
Versus the butcher again and again
The winning is rated
The bodies were sized
And the winner is ... prized
Nominate the perfect egg
And observe its innocence
Like the whiteness of a stillborn child
Crown the fattest, crown the best
Laying layer that contest
In the competition that you give
Let's play a losing game
Versus the sickness and versus the pain
Versus the butcher again and again
The winning is rated
The bodies were sized
And the winner is ... prized
Nominated to die
Prized
