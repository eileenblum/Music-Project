The pain I said was old and irregular
The pain you heard was big as a solid brick wall
Pain is formed by the limit of our domain
No we'll try to turn it round
To turn the pain to sound
Pain is party
There's a point in pain, in this falling of ours
I believe in suffering and playing like us
Now we'll try to turn it round
To turn the pain to sound
Pain is party
just a party
