All animals are equal
Equal to the sky
Equal to the ocean
Equal when they die

There's a pig down in the mud
Face the dead man in his blood
Chained up neat roll down the rails
Down to meet you at a place

When they look at you
And you at them
To sing it together again

All animals are equal
Equal to the sky
Equal to the ocean
Equal when they die

I'm the porkling that was grilled
I am the victim that was killed
Me in chains roll down the rails
Down to meet you at a place

While they look at me
And I at them
To sing it together again

All animals are equal
Equal to the sky
Equal to the ocean
Equal when they die
