Who's the liar
Who claims to know the truth
It's your desire
To see the tings so smooth
Who's the liar
Who claims to know the truth
Here's a warning
For those who need proof
You see the sun is shining bright
To bask in the sun and feel all right
Don't disregard the consequences
I see the sun is burning your skin
While you are sleeping and dreaming of me
Open your eyes and realize
Truth is aching in sunburnt awakening
Who's the liar
Who claims to know the truth
Here's the answer A haunting tune
You see the sun is shining bright
To bask in the sun and feel all right
Don't disregard the consequences
I see the sun is burning your skin
While you are sleeping and dreaming of me
Open your eyes and realize
Truth is aching
In sunburnt awakening
You see the sun is shining bright
You wear sunglasses to save your sight
Ultra protection for your skin
I watch you sprawling in the sand
Forgot my suncream now I'm taned
I open my eyes and realize
It's high time I should decieve me
It's high time I should belive me
Sunburnt
