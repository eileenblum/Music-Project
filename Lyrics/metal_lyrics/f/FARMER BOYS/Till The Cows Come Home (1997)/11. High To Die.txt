A thousand miles away
I'm staring through a screen
I see the world with different eyes
A thousand miles away
In a state supreme
I see the world through different skies
Are you saying good bye
Are you ready to fly
Are you coming away
Are you going to stay
High to die
A thousand miles away
I'm staring through a screen
I see the world with different eyes
Are you saying good by
Are you ready to fly
Are you coming away
Are you going to stay
High to die
staring through a screen
in a state supreme
