Now and then
In the corner of my eye
I see the passers-by
Going through the motions

Bathed in sin
There's no redemption here
And all you have to fear
Is waiting for you here

Here comes the pain
When bullets are flying
And women are crying
Here comes the pain
Specially for you

Born to lose
It's a family affair
An inner circle where
You know who your friends are

Born to kill
Tears were made to cry
But the blood that's in your eye
Was made to flow, made to flow

Here comes the pain
Where living is big time and dying is big time
Here comes the pain
Special delivery
But no one's to too innocent to die...

Here comes the pain
When bullets are flying
And women are crying
Here comes the pain
The pain, the pain
