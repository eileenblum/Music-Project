To simple to be true
When you prefer your lies
You don't want to see through
It's right before your eyes
Believe me, there's something
That you have never seen,
When night falls, there's nothing
To save you from the things,
In your darkest dreams.

[Chorus:]
And in this ghosttown it's sundown
It's you and it's me
I'll keep my eyes open wide
And I will ride with...
...Cowboys and angels

The horses are restless
And they can smell the fear,
The streets now are empty
The wind is all you hear,
It's too late, to change now
It's time to win or loose
It's just me, and you now
The weapons that you choose
Were made for fools

[Chorus]

Cowboys and angels
Cowboys and angels
Cowboys and angels
