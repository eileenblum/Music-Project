Hear what I hear
Deep inside your morning fear
See what I see
A thorney weed becomes a tree

Light is fading out
Tears of blood are running down
Dread and darkness are covering your soul

Dire passions growing free
Suffering your destiny
Crimes of violence are leading you to me

Sperm keeps flying
Towards the rising scum
A calf starts crying

A farmer rapes its mum

Feel what I feel
The silent hate is lying in wait
Pain life in pain
Perfect storn like a stain

Light is fading out
Tears of blood are running down
Dread and darkness are covering your soul

Dire passions growing free
Suffering your destiny
Crimes of violence are leading you to me

Sperm keeps flying
Towards the rising scum
A calf starts crying

A farmer rapes its mum
