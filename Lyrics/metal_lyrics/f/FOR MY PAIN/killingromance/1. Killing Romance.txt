[Music: Jarmo KylmÃ¤nen &amp; For My Pain..., Lyrics: Juha KylmÃ¤nen]

No, I can't go on
Waiting only tomorrow
Life, so meaningless and hollow
It's the circle of sorrow

All I once believed in is dead
A faded halo around my head
Innocence turns into regret
A sinner in a white veil

The bond of trust
Burned by the lust
One wicked glance led into killing romance
Now I know that death can dance

No, I can't go on
Waiting only tomorrow
Life, so meaningless and hollow
It's the circle of sorrow

In the shadows of the endless night
I'm paying the sins with my life
It hurts to come into daylight
I'm cursed to roam in the dark

The passion of life
Gone in the shade of night
With no belief and bleeding wings
I'm half of the man I used to be

No, I can't go on
Waiting only tomorrow
Life, so meaningless and hollow
It's the circle of sorrow
