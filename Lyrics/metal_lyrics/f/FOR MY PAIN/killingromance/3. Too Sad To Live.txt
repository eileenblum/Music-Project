[Lyrics by Juha KylmÃ¤nen]

Everything she tries for the sake of that little boy 
Gives all her love, every single piece of her heart 

Don't lose your head, don't lose your faith or you'll end up dead 
You're one of a kind, don't drown yourself into the crowd 

Oh, my precious sister, it's you who I adore, 
In spite of those sleepless nights you still keep carrying on 
With your life, with you soul 
The faster beats your heart the more you're gone 
With your life, with you soul 
The faster beats your heart the more you're lost

I know it hurts bad, to give everything and still end up sad 
Twisted fact of life, every single day is another fight 

Oh, my precious sister, it's you who I adore, 
In spite of those sleepless nights you still keep carrying on 
With your life, with you soul 
The faster beats your heart the more you're gone
With your life, with you soul 
The faster beats your heart the more you're lost 

Too sad to feel anything, these scars will never heal, or so it feels... 
Oh, A little child only hope in here, but it takes more than I can give, sadness set me free: 
With your life, with you soul 
The faster beats your heart the more you're lost
With your life, with you soul 
The faster beats your heart the more you're gone
