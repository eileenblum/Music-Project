âTwas the night before Christmas and spirits were high 
I was all tucked up in bed I knew Santa was nigh 
The stockings were hung the mince pies were out 
And I drifted to sleep with good feelings throughout 
But when Santa descended the chimney his breathing was heavy 
I thought it was due to his weight but he was just getting ready 
He crept into my room with his sack in his hand 
And decked my halls with his testicular glands 

When Santa spaffed in my stocking I will admit that I cried 
It was horrid and crusty because it had dried 
When Santa spaffed in my stocking there went my Christmas day 
My presents are festive in the worst possible way 
Now Santaâs sack is empty he has given all his presents to me 
There are tears in my eyes spunk in my Christmas tree 
But next year I know I will pull my own stunt 
I will lace his brandy with roofies and rape the fat cunt

Cumming all ye faithful over all thatâs in sight 
Spilling his eggnog and pulling his cracker all night 
Putting his pig in blankets was not enough for St. Nick 
He had to stuff my turkey and baste with his prick 
He went through my selection box and ate all the best ones 
And then he spread his jolly jam over my hot-crossed buns 
It wasn't a silent night but it was a holy night 
He was away in my manger setting his pudding alight 

Santaâs been dreaming of a white Christmas too 
Itâs horrid, translucent, all covered in goo 
Following that reindeer booty all over the earth 
Gave him a stiffy so huge with a pulsating girth 
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas every day 
But tell me why did it have to be this way? 
When Santaâs Yule log became unfurled 
Allâs he wanted was to feed the world
