Whoa mate Iâm gonna stab ya
Whoa mate Iâm gonna break your legs

I go to the park after dark
And Iâll stab ya with my knife
Then I go home and smoke some weed
Then Iâll go screw ya wife

I go outside in my bling bling
Whoa mate Iâm the real thing
And with my posse Iâm gonna do you over
Go home, get pissed and wake up with a real hangover

I go to the pitch with my bitch
With my Nike trousers tucked into my socks
And then I go home and fuck my bird
âCause sheâs got some real big knocks

I go home listen to my real big mix
And then Iâm gonna mess with my hydraulics
I turn my cap all around
Iâm real solid mate and uh...
Iâll bang ya out!
