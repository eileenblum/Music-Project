Brown empties from my soul
To be sucked through this blackened hole
Eternity breathes a sigh of relief
An ecstasy at the end of grief

The room is enchanted with this blissful smell
Just sigh and give it hell

Strain
Strain your heart out
Pain
In pain you cry and shout
Rain
It rains itâs grief on you
Gain
Nothing to gain or lose

Doom spirals through this world
Destroying everything youâve hurled
Blasphemy exits from your region
As an evil, tormented demon

The room is annihilated in this horrid despair
You have made this your unloading lair

Spinning turmoil eats your life
Jabbing your muscles like a jagged knife
Blood dripping through your espionage crew
Nothing left for us to do

What can we do?
