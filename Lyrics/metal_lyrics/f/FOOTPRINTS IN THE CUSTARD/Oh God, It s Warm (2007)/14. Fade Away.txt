It all started long ago
I was happy then, I know
There were just the little things
Until the hunger spread its wings
The diameter increase
Just seemed never to then cease
And say that the worst has passed
But my fears are getting vast

Why wonât this all just fade away?
Deep into the blackened night
Why wonât this all just fade away?
When will it all be alright?

So as time sustained a roll
My life was engulfed whole
Everything I used to love
Crushed me flat from above
I found I could not endure
So I ran right for the door
Still my problem seems to be
My problemâs twice as big as me.
