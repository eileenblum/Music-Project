I need to express
My greatest need
All I desire
Is to release

My need to wee

Oh, I feel so strongly about this wee
Itâs everything that makes me be
If I did not need this piss
Think of all those things Iâd miss
This dripping water in my mind
Makes my desperation rise
If I do not urinate
Soon it will be too late

I miss the sound
I miss the smell
I miss the taste
I miss the texture

Of my pee
Smelly wee

Oh my God it burns
I canât believe how much it burns
I cannot express
My ultimate distress
Iâm just not well
Letâs unleash hell

Unzip me
Free the wee
