Deep in my heart, deep in my soul
Thereâs something missing, Iâm not whole
There is something I donât have
Nothing for you to grasp
All my nights I canât sleep
Knowing I am incomplete
I have nothing left to lose
Nothing for your hands to use

I know I can never be
Anymore than you now see
So please donât tell me lies
When you look into my eyes

Place your hands upon my chest
Say youâll always love me best
But when your hands find nothing there
Tell me truly you donât care

Out of my heart, out of my soul
My life is rushing to a close
All around me people see
Everything I fail to be
Can you not see that I am lost?
For my crimes Iâve paid the cost
I wish I could be complete
Become part of the elite
