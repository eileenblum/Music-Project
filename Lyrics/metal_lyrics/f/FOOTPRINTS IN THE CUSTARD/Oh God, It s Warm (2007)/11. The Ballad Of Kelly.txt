Holy shit youâre fucking disgusting
Your one ring must be rusting
Iâd never put my finger inside
The deep dark depths where the orcs all hide
Iâm not touching your Mt. Doom
And neither would Orlando Bloom
Cast a spell to hide your face
Youâre Middle Earthâs sickest disgrace

Have you ever seen someone so ugly you could die?
So hideous that you could skull-fuck Sauronâs eye
Or do it with a dwarf and get it in his beard
âCause a girl who looks like Smeagol is something to be feared

Hobbits live in hills for reasons
To side from you throughout the seasons
Youâre the reason the Ring-Wraiths screech
And fly so high out of reach
Iâm not touching your giant eagle
Not with a face like fucking Smeagol
You should be locked up in a cage
So say the Elves, wise and aged
