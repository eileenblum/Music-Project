[performed by Footprints in the Custard]Have white and pasty wenches lost all of their allure,
Do you plough and churn the field and wish you could have more?
Don't you fret my lucky man a brave new world awaits,
To change your life forever walk through the black gates

Cut-throats and rapists bastards and thieves,
Honour and glory or death on your knees?
Stand your ground ring out the bell,
On my command unleash Hell
Winter is coming the choice has been made,
You can't turn away from the course that is laid,
You swore an oath and you can't take it back,
Cause when you take the black, you can never go back!

Oaths that can't be broken stay with you for life,
Turn your back on winter take shadow for a wife,
Turn away from sunshine you can't abide the light
You plunge our swords in darkness and thrust away all night

Black! as the flightless crow
Black! sends me down below
Black! set me on this track
I have taken the black I can never go back
Black! as the flightless crow
Black! sends me down below
Black! set me on this track
I have taken the black I can never go back
