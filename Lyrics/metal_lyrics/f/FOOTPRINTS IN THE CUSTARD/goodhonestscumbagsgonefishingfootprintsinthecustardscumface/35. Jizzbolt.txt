[performed by Footprints in the Custard]Iâve got a secret no one should know
That reveals itself every time I get a blow
As if out of nowhere straight to the face
JizzBolt

Knocked to the ground, blinded by the light
Fury of the Gods, blistering and bright
The salty pent-up rage bears down upon
As tears, blood and semen now merge as one

Itâs a guilty pleasure of mine
Iâll end them one whore at a time
As if out of nowhere straight to the face
JizzBolt

Knocked to the ground, blinded by the light
Fury of the Gods, blistering and bright
The salty pent-up rage bears down upon
As Tears, blood and semen now merge as one
