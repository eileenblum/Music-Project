[performed by Footprints in the Custard]Happy Hour is here at last
Time to indulge in a liquid repast
Have the barkeep pour me a drink
Cause tonight I'm gonna forget how to think

Give me some more
(Dirty Pints)
Crash to the floor
(Whisky shots)
Oh, good God
(What is that?!)
I think I'm gonna be 
My beer goggles
(Booze, booze, booze)
Are sewn on too tight
(Drink, drink, drink)
I can't see right
(Vom, vom, vom)
Wasted! Wasted!
This drunken haze
(Booze, booze, booze)
Is becoming a maze
(drink, drink, drink)
My eyes are glazed
(Vom, vom, vom)
Wasted! Wasted!

I'll tell you when I had enough
I'll drink beer from your Mum's muff
I went there I'll say it again
Have I ever told you you're my best friend

Okay, I see I've gone too far
Be a good time to jump in the car
Where are my keys? where is my scotch?
Why is there vomit all over my crotch?
