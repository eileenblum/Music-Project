[performed by Footprints in the Custard]Met a girl at a local bar told her I was a big rock star
Sweet tattoos and long dark hair
I wanted in to her underwear
Line them up, knock them back damn this girl is great
But I didnât know, when in the sack what sheâd initiate

In the heat of the moment you can hear me scream
Part my butt cheeks open cram a finger in between
In the heat of the moment I feel like I could cry
With your fingernails up my shit trail kiss my dignity goodbye

Damn this girl was really fine I took her right on back to mine
I didnât know and Iâm not to blame
That sheâd play me at my own game
Back at home another beer shit I was really drunk
I didnât know, and Iâm sincere sheâd stick it where it stunk

(Oh! The shame...)
Sheâs spreading my cheeks
(Oh! The shame...)
That shit reeks
(Oh! The shame...)
Caressing my groove
(Oh! The shame...)
Thereâs no lube!
(Oh! The shame...)
Forage inside
(Oh! The shame...)
Swallow my pride
(Oh! The shame...)
Now sheâs inside
Oh fuck... Iâve come
