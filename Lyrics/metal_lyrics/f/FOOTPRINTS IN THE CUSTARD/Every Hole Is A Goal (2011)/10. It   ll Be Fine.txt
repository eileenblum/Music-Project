She used to be such a sweet, sweet girl
But on that night she shattered my entire world
In the blink of an eye her innocence was gone
I never knew that this girl could be so wrong
She said

Itâll be fine as long as it goes over my face
Itâll be fine as long as thereâs no paternity case
Itâll be fine as long as you jump off of this ride
Itâll be fine as long as you donât spaff one off inside of me

This is a girl with a high risk of infection
This is a girl who doesnât care about protection
She was the one that I thought would remain pure
Now it transpires sheâs a filthy fucking whore

Itâll be fine
