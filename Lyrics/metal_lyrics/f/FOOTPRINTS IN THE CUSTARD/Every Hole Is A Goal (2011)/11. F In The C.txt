F in the C in the motherfuckinâ house
Wave your shit in the airand shout this fuckinâ out!
The Footprints are back and theyâre stomped in deep
And what theyâre gonna do is knock you off your feet!
All you motherfuckers better prepare
Scream âtil you bleed, pump your fists in the air!
âCos the Pickleweaselâs back and heâs chilling in his lair
Drinking whiskey by the gallon from his thick armchair
He donât care who you are, if youâve come very far
At the bar with a jar smokinâ a cigar
If you get in his waythen youâd better fucking pray!
Youâre his prey by the way It ainât your day today, wigga!
This is the Custard with the motherfuckinâ Prints in!
Scream âtil youâre flustered and your eyeballs are wincinâ!
Câmon motherfucker, make it convincinâ!
Fuck this party up and letâs get the drinks in!
The Pickleweaselâs all around
Fuckinâ up your town with his badass sound!
Kick up some shit if you wanna survive
If you strive to provide, heâll keep you alive!

The idol of the party, the Pickleweasel massive
âBoys down your drinks and girls shake your asses!â
If you canât see it yet, put on yoâ glasses!
Footprints bringing this shit to the masses!

Send me
West motherfucker! You cannot comprehend
Whatâs goinâ down with our green and purple friend!
He ainât bending no trend when thereâs nothing to mend
Fuckinâ up the wiggaâs heâs a weasely gent!
Picklinâ those corpses high up on the ceiling
Cherishing the feeling of the skin as itâs peeling
Heâs wheelinâ and dealinâ with a rock hard feelinâ
Stealing the innocence and weilding the freedom!

And if itâs a good time you want get the bass a pumpinâ!
Câmon motherfucker, get the place a jumpinâ!
The Pickleweasel here and his rhythm is thumpinâ!
Get your tits out and heâll ram his stump in!
Bitch motherfucker! This shit is for real!
Feeding energy like a three course meal!
Tits and pussy are fucking ideal!
Damn motherfucker, weâll make them squeal!

Keep you alive!
Keep you alive!
