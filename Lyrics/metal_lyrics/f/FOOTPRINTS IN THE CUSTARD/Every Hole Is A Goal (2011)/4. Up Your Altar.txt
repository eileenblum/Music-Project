Let me express myself ever so graphically
Of kids prostrated on the altar so seductively
They drive me mad, they drive me wild, they make my habit chafe
As long as Iâm around no child alive is safe

Molesting kids taking them home itâs a dirty job but someoneâs got to do it
Swear to me that youâll never falter and Iâll stick it right up your altar
Iâm a Catholic pious as hell but I love it when those children yell
None of the girls only the boys stick it in hard with some room for toys

Wait for the bell to ring children flocking in
Hold them behind after class to engage in original sin
Donât be scared donât be afraid, what would Jesus do?
Heâd bend over, a smile on his face, and wait for the Holy Glue

Donât you tell never grow old
Donât you tell do as youâre told
Be my Peter Pan
