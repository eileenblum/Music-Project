Lying here these robes are shed
Iâve played this moment so much in my head
But you canât
Or at least I wonât

I donât know how you can bleed so much and not die
Every month itâs everywhere how are you still alive?

Iâm longing for this connection
But itâs swamped by your menstruation
Itâs a tide
Itâs a God damn torrent
