Weâve come to all or nothing letâs try this out
A red ocean cascades into the mouth
Scrape the pieces from my eyes but the blood just comes to nothing
Next to the big surprise

Blob bunnies flying out of your minge
Weâre going down on a blob bunny binge
One mistake and the trap is sprung
Uteral lining builds on my tongue
Canât escape this ceaseless flow
How was I supposed to know?
Is it live or is it dead?
Itâs tasty despite all Iâve said

I know that I should falter I know that I should quit
I canât believe the refuse thatâs covering my lips
Itâs in my beard sticky and red
Creeping down through the sheets staining the bed

I know I should be disgusted by this chewy bunny blob
Will I ever get the taste out of my overflowing gob
Itâs rushing down my face and hair leaving me with no respite
Worst of all, the strange thing is
I could go all night
