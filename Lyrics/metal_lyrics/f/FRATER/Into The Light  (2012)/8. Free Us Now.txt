Freedom of speech is plain bullshit (bullshit)
morality soaked in green
Stumbling through blindness, just drifting
believing in no-oneÂ´s beliefs.

bow down to your knees,
give your soul to the empire
bow down to your knees,
fill the ark of the empire of blood

Free us now, from this pain
Free us now, unify
Free us now, from this pain
free us now, rise inside

we will find the way
we will find our path
we will burn the flag
the flag that holds us down

Progress is a promise of a better life
that leads to a bitter end.
Progress in excess, breaks equilibrium
is easy to see that this progress is failure

bow down to your knees,
give your soul to the empire
bow down to your knees,
fill the ark of the empire of blood

Free us now, from this pain
Free us now, unify
Free us now, from this pain
free us now, rise inside

Free us now, from this pain
Free us now, unify
Free us now, from this pain
free us now, rise inside

Violence leads to violence
leads to violence,
leads to violence,
free us now!
