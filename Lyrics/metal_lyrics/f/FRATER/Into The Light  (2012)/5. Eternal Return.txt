Eternal return to the hatred
You canât deny what ever is this
Bound to fulfill our destiny
Just close your eyes and leave none behind
None

No regrets as youâre ok my friend, no regrets
No regrets for the blood that weâve spilled no regrets
Once youâre in it, no way out
You cannot run from your self
No way out [x2]

Meaningless
Senseless

Thereâs no other way donât pray for a saviour
The answer within, within you.
The life that youâve killed, the life that youâve inhale
The answer within, within you.

As higher as deeper the fall
Burn them all to feel the warmth
Of the innocents souls that weâve slaughtered
Just close your eyes and leave none behind
None behind [x2]

No regrets as youâre ok my friend, no regrets
No regrets for the blood that weâve spilled no regrets
Once youâre in it, no way out
You cannot run from your self
No way out [x2]

Meaningless
Senses less
