Through this pain I refine
Tearing me from within
As night sinks me deep, in absence of hope,
you live inside of me

Through this pain I reborn
Against the current
Through your eyes, Through your lips
I reach redemption

Close my eyes, everlasting
My heart returns to you

I give my heart away

Torn! Bleak! Lost! breathless!
If I could only erase this grief, I
Know! YouÂ´re always within.

Close my eyes, everlasting
My heart returns to you
Hold me here, never-dying
My heart returns to you

Hope! yearning! save me!
If I could only erase this grief, I
Know! YouÂ´re always within, swan song.
