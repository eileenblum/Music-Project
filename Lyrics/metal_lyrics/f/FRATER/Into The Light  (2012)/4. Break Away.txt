Wake up restless spirit open your eyes
thereÂ´s no oblivion ahead. Forgiveness

Breathing, let the flow drag you down
gently drifting, wreckless

Burn the disguise, this thoughts are stabbing my head
I need to find where I am, I need to break trough

You take away IÂ´m trying to shake off the fear
a broken mirror reflects, disfigure, no reality

And then I open up my eyes
thereÂ´s no sorrow, thereÂ´s no pain

And then I open up my eyes (forgiveness)
ThereÂ´s no shadows, thereÂ´s no darkness (no shadows, no darkness)
And then I open up my eyes. for you...

Wake up, lift me spirit and let me fly high
extend your wings and shine forevermore

Breathing, purity fills the void
from now on, enlightened

Burn the disguise, this thoughts are stabbing my head
I need to find where I am, I need to break trough

You take away IÂ´m trying to shake off the fear
a broken mirror reflects, disfigure, no reality

And then I open up my eyes
thereÂ´s no sorrow, thereÂ´s no pain
And then I open up my eyes
thereÂ´s no burden I canÂ´t take

ThereÂ´s no forbidden road
even though I may stumble
IÂ´m determined to know whatÂ´s beyond

ThereÂ´s no path I canÂ´t cross
if my spirit yearns for freedom
thereÂ´s no darkness beyond our own blindness

Break away

And then I open up my eyes
ThereÂ´s no shadows, thereÂ´s no darkness
And then I open up my eyes. for you Free

Break away
