The awakening, the pain so endless
my mind tied to darkness
embracing the chain as I fall

Sunken eyes, blackened soul
shattered will all I am is none,
My whole life, trying to avoid
bouncing against the same wall

The path I walk is a dead end
the life a I lead is a dead end
This fucking voice, inside my head
self-taught lies, the same mistakes
The path I walk is a dead end

The hope for something more
all that I wished for
has gone in shapeless dreams
buried beneath my fears

well IÂ´m sitting there
trapped, here in the corner
inside of my head

A black ceiling above me
IÂ´ll close my eyes
Wrapped around my hate
I feel death will take me this time
or will you kill me this time?

This fucking voice, inside my head
self-taught lies, the same mistakes
The hope for something more
all that I wished for
has gone in shapeless dreams
buried beneath my fears

well IÂ´m sitting there
trapped, here in the corner
inside of my head
