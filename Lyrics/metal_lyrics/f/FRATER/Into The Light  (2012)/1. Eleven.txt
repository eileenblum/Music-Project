I had enough of this world and its sickening pace
enough plastic lives and enough apathy.
You took it for granted and nodded along
Just a sheep among wolves idolizing frauds

You changed the stone and you stumbled again
burn the foundations and start all over
love-hate, borned-killed, spiraling centuries
WhatÂ´s the point motherfucker?
Just circles in circles in circles in circles...enough!

What if I said thereÂ´s no tomorrow?
Will you help me to stand free? (will you point your finger at me?)
What if I said our time is borrowed?
Will you give this shell for free?

I know I know, I should let go

Righteous, oh youÂ´re so righteous
A scorching flame looming above the sea
Barren, your tongue is worthless
A flickering flame crushed by my feet

I had enough of this world and its sickening pace
enough plastic lives and enough apathy.
love-hate, borned-killed, spiraling centuries
WhatÂ´s the point motherfucker?
Just circles in circles in circles in circles...enough!

What if I said thereÂ´s no tomorrow?
Will you help me to stand free?
What if I said our time is borrowed?
Will you give this shell for free?

I know I know, I should let go

What if I said thereÂ´s no tomorrow? (will you point your finger at me?)
Will you help me to stand free? (will you wage this war with me?)
What if I said our time is borrowed?
Will you give this shell for free?
