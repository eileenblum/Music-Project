When all itÂ´s said and done and the thirst of the days devours the night
Why should I bother? Why should I care?
As I repent, all my sins come undone

Into the light I go, covered/shrouded in mist and glow
Into the light I go, hold on to death and let go

As I walk the path unable to die,
IÂ´m loosing senses, one by one.
Ascending in circles, the rings of my mind.
As light shifts to shadows, as the veil falls, I rise.

As the souls emerge, lifting me far above, I can see the great river bellowing ahead yet
calmly and endless. Death and life, itÂ´s all transition, to a nowhere place, purposeless.
Each particle of energy, merges into the whole, mutating, blooming into oblivion and eternity.

All life is what death shall conceive,
All death is what life shall breed.

Into the light I go, I know, I should let go.

Into the light I go, covered/shrouded in mist and glow
Into the light I go, hold on to life and let go
