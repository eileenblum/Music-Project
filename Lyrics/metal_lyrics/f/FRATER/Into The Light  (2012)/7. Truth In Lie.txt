Why everything seems to slip away?
I cannot take this pressure (no longer)
Why? Is it me? is it just another day?
Inactive, reactive, a mental retreat from the world.

Breathing, bleeding.

Face the truth with a lie, until you believe in it
I fear to see, fear to change. IÂ´m lost without a trace.

Carved in my flesh, memories taking me (down)
Down, I canÂ´t run, I canÂ´t hide no longer
Fallen, defeated, corroded, unhealed.
Inactive, reactive, a granted farewell from the world.

Face the truth with a lie, until you believe in it
I fear to see, fear to change. IÂ´m lost without a trace.
