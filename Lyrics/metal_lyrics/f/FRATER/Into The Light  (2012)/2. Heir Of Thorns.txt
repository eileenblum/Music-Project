We have chosen to be, the ghost of ourselves
Blindfolded, pursuing lies that weÂ´ve made
The Word casts no light, in the land of the shades
His will sacrifies you so kneel down and prey. Amen!
Heir of thorns, in your cross
will you showÂ´em the way
Heir of thorns, beloved son
would you perish for them

Eden
Bless me father cuz` I have sinned
Bleed me father cuz` I have lived

whereÂ´s the light in your purpose?
whereÂ´s the use of this rage?
For your glory, for your virtue
In your name, the faithfull, the scapegoats,
we say halleluia!

White crosses for your endless fields
War trophies, war!
