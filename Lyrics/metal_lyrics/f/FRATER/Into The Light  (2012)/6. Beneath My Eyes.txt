I read the truth between your eyes
I felt your desperate need to hide
I realized that the beginning
Arrived when your life was undone

I seized the life, I seized the life left in my hands

Mark my words, clarity stroke me down
And surrounded by light
IÂ´m breaking through this

All my life, I tried to run
Caged and stuck, beneath my eyes
All my life, I tried to run
From my self, from my self

The angers grows inside everyday
Praying that this time itÂ´s real
Disarmed of all your pride youÂ´ll die
HereÂ´s the place where I take my stand

Mark my words, clarity stroke me down
And surrounded by light
IÂ´m breaking through this

All my life, I tried to run
Caged and stuck, beneath my eyes
All my life, I tried to run
From my self, from my self
