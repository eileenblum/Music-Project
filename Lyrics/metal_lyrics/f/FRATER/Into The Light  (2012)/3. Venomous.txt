Fuck this, IÂ´m sick of this nightmare
sick of your venomous tongue in my mouth
the weight of the world in my shoulders
ItÂ´s time for you to take this cross and fuck off

You fed me with hate for so long,
and now your creation is scratching the sky
Manipulate me, but youÂ´ll never break me
soaked in your blood, I reborn.

All that remains, all that I had
ashes in my hands
But now I understand
that the choice is within myself

within myself, IÂ´ll kill the pain
A brand new light, showing the way

ItÂ´s not too late, fight for remain
Over and over again, tread on my beliefs again
Louder than all youÂ´ve heard, IÂ´ll show you whoÂ´s the insane

Failure, as you push me backwards
IÂ´m breaking the boundaries that youÂ´ve set
Watch me, arise from the shadows,
as you diminish, here I stand, still.

All that remains, all that I had
ashes in my hands
But now I understand
that the choice is within myself

within myself, IÂ´ll kill the pain
A brand new light, showing the way

ItÂ´s not too late, fight for remain
Over and over again, tread on my beliefs again
Louder than all youÂ´ve heard, IÂ´ll show you whoÂ´s the insane
