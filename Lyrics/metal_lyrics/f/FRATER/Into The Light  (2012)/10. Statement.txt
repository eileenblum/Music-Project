I raise my voice over a thousand seas
a soulless mourn, drifting along the waves
How could I ever reach the shore that shines abroad
If less is more, this void is endless

I live my life under a simple statement
"Breath by breath, dust to dust"
nothing is meant to last, nothing is meant to be
Forevermore, forevermore.

SomethingÂ´s crawling through me

Pain of wisdom, knowledge of flesh
wind of reckoning, d dr draag meeeee

ThereÂ´s a deeper meaning, thereÂ´s a bigger force
than you and me, but you still donÂ´t see the point.
An underrated life is unforgivable
YouÂ´re unforgivable. weÂ´re unforgivable.

I never see. I never feel.

Light dwells in me, blooms in me, but itÂ´s too late, I am dying
the mist embraces the shore, IÂ´ll never reach it.
the sea devours all, unraveling justice.
I raise my voice, I raise my voice.

I raise my voice
