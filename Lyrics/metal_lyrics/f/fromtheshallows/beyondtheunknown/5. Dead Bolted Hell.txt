Waving arms like distant flags
We cry out in agony
A heartless breath of horror lingering
In the deepest depth of midnight
We've done this to ourselves
We're bleeding on the shackles of binding hate
A cold clasp of rape clentched and gnawing at our flesh
This is what we've told the world time and time again
Confined and contorted
distorted as an unscathing blasphemy and mask of ourselves
This force moves us in ways we cant describe
Its such a wretchid torment
and we've done this to ourselves
and I reach for your hand father god
hoping to escape the gates of this deadbolted hell
DEADBOLTED HELL!
WE CAN NEVER GET FREE
THIS IS OUR HELL
His tears fell from the sky as his body gave way
We pierced and betrayed him on his cross that day
His blood dripping onto our hate strickened faces
Waving arms like distant flags
He cried out in agony
His feet were severed so quickly
And He could only pray for death
A heartless breath of horror lingering
In the deepest depth of midnight
We've done this to ourselves
We're bleeding on the shackles of binding hate
A cold clasp of rape clentched and gnawing at our flesh
He lifts his head to the heavens with prayer for we
Our souls deserve eternal damnation
But he has forgiven us of our ignorance and malcontent
And he has died for us time and time again
A prophetic resurection fufilled on that horrendous grave
And we lacerate our throats with sharp blasphemous incantations
