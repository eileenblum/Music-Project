I'll be your gravedigger And then I will cut youReady set go Decapitated corpseA horrid shade of red I found her head in the iceboxPerfectly preserved Save yourselfYour tightly wound skinIs begging for cannibal behaviorOpen wide to consume these fantasiesThe deeper The bite The better The taste Save yourself Or you'll all suffocateThe end is near I'll break into youWith every scream and cry I become you
