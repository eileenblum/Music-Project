And we swallowed his blackened freedom
The sinners blood coveted by martyrs
Under your rancid uncleansing moonlight
Tear your flesh and let it be devoured

And we will never run, GO
With honor we fight!
will you have my back?
through the cold dark nights!
we can never look back
now go!
with honor we fight
will you have my back?
through the cold dark nights
we cant look back

So following quickly behind the dead lord
and breathe this blackened earth
for he has enticed you with his blackest plagues
and you shall suffer once more

Tonights fiery sky blazes oh so bright
As a swarm of hate breathes from the dark clouds above
ashes burn the flesh like sacred sachels
and all will burn so very bright

The swallowed what we once called home
hasting the day that we once felt alive
Encrusted in a tomb we feel a malice dormant
And your tightly woven flesh will burn one last time

A picture perfect burning world
lying dormant to illusionary slaves
fire rising engulfing everything youve had

with honor we will fight
will you have my back?
through the cold dark nights
with our honor we must fight
through the horrid nights
