I can step out of cold
Heaven is your award
No more useless compromise
I try to move but I'm caged in ice

All secrets that I hide will die with me
Then thrilling and dramatic memory
Look at the birds fly into hurricane
They'll soon be quietly denied by pain

You bring life free from sin
Rebuild the shattered dream
I want repent and live
Have you any faith in what you believe?

For three days she screamed and cried
Full of passion and delight
With fear of death I wait for the night to come on me
Shadow is my only friend
Dance with hope come to an end
I feel beneath my feet cold sand
