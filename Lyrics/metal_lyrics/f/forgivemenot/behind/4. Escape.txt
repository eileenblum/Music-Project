Some will say death take breath away
With us it's different way
Way of life is not where we'll go
We'll follow other path

This is where we end
No more hops is left
Weakness fills me now
Creeps into me
Life beneath this sky
Seams a useless ride
In death-car of the God
Won't you make it stop
Let us catch it

Stand by me
Don't be scared to go
Don't be afraid to fly
Our last dream
Of the peace of heart
Made us escape life
