It hurts my eyes to look at you
'Cos you so bright and you so cold
Your crystal words bring me down to sunrise
A darker mass against the night
Your illusion of light
You belong to freezing point

I can try to remain first minute of the weakness
Fire dance in the rain to animate me

The dawn crept over tranquil see
I find my self like a fly in a wet
She gaze at me steadily and proudly
I understand well enough what her smile means tonight
She so bright
I belong to freezing point

I can try to remain first minute of the weakness
Fire dance in the rain to animate me
