Girl believe when I say
It was so hard for me to decide
I don't want to be in pain no more
Bet you know it's a game
And there's always somebody to blame
And there's always me to know the score

I see it coming there's no way out
You are my favorite game but I still doubt
You were fun to play now let me out
I wan't compromise 'cause the rules are mine
I'v had a time of my life

Break the rules it's ok!
It's high time for you to let go
There is more to life then you can fake
And we were two damn fools
I was wrong to guess that you know
I'm just glad there's not so much at stake
