Whoever told you that we can not try to fly
To fly without wings much easier just try
To dive in deep blue dream and stay up there wrapped in peace
Is simple thing to do just pull the strings

We will touch the sky
With our weary minds
Whoever told you that our dream are not for real?
They're more then life, I tell you, don't you feel?
Our dreams we can control no more they're spells upon our souls
Cease trying to escape our spirits roams

We'll holding to
Ethereal ties
We will touch the sky
With our weary minds
Sweetest agony
Leaves us no doubts
Lost inside our dreams
We shall stand behind
