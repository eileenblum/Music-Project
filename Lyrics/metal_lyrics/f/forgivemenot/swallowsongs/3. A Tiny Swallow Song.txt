More all the stars that ever shone for me
Come with the fingers of the destiny
Can you hear songs of a tiny swallow
I hear them too and there is no need

But I can fly
Like a bird in this reality
I see you
Tease me but the time of my vitality
Will be over

The air wraps me up with the feathers
The sun becomes so unbelievable
Can you hear the sounds of a tiny swallow
I hear them too...

But I can fly
Like a bird in this reality
I see you
Tease me but the time of my vitality
Will be over

More all the stars that ever shone for me
Come with the fingers of the destiny
Can you hear songs of a tiny swallow
I hear them too and there is no need
But I can fly...
