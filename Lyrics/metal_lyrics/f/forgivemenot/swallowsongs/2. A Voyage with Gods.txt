Kiss my sunbeam
Feel my heartbeat
There's no life in me alone
When I don't see you
I can feel you
I just want you to atone

Hit the starlight
Meet the sunfight
Drive in to your fantasy
I'm just shining
I'm just bleeding
Do you hear me cry I'm alone

What did I do
I give it all to you my love
You can leave me now
What did I do
I gave it back I know I can't
Live without you now

Kiss my sunbeam
Feel my heartbeat
There's no life in me alone
When I don't see you
I can feel you
I just want you to atone

What did I do
I give it all to you my love
You can leave me now
What did I do
I gave it back I know I can't
Live without you now
