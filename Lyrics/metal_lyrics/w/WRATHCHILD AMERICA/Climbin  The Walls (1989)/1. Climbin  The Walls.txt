I know, you know
Something's gotta break
If this shit don't come to a halt
There's not much more I can take
Wheels are spinning, lawyers are grinning
To see what I'm gonna do
Minds arranging, I'm tired of changin'
Something's gotta pull me through

Club owners say, "Didn't make your pay,
I think we must got took"
Don't fuck with me, I'm glad to see
You're smarter than you look,
No vacancy, no vacancy, everywhere I stop
When you see me doing, 83 in a 55
I might kill a cop
'Cause I'm

Climbin' the walls standin' on the edge
Climbin' the walls insanity's the ledge
Climbin' the walls till I can't catch my breath
Climbin' the walls I'm gettin' closer to death

I ain't got no money and that ain't funny
Check is in the mail
Agents are barkin', the fire ain't sparkin'
And I'm livin' in a private hell
People say you gotta pay
To play in a winners game
Well I am me, a lunatics friend
And nothing else stays the same
'Cause I'm

Climbin' the walls standin' on the edge
Climbin' the walls insanity's the ledge
Climbin' the walls till I can't catch my breath
Climbin' the walls I'm gettin' closer to death
