Darkness fills the corners of my swollen eyes
The Earth around me doesn't make a sound
I wish it was a dream but it's time I realize
I'm still alive, but six feet underground

Not much air, there's not much time
There's not much hope
The seconds seem like hours in my mind
In pitch black darkness I could lose my sanity
The panic flows like ice through my veins

I can hear, their, muffled laughter
Can they hear my screams?
It doesn't matter now 'cause they don't care
It's all a harmless drunken joke to them it seems
I can't laugh I'm running out of air

Silent darkness fills my ears and eyes
(Smothered life)
Trapped by Earth my body screams
Death from below creeping slowly
(Smothered life)
I realize this hell is not a dream

My eyes are covered
With the dirt that seals my grave
My breath is getting shorter all the time
All I hear is silence, but I'm not alone
Insects just like chills run down my spine

Silent darkness fills my ears and eyes
(Smothered life)
Trapped by Earth my body screams
Death from below creeping slowly
(Smothered life)
I realize this hell is not a dream

There's maggots in my bloodstream now
And filth beneath my skin
Won't rest in peace until I know
My death has been avenged
The smell down here is rancid
My breath it reeks of sin
Been buried alive, my corpse will rise
Revenge lies deep within
My soul it climbs up through the Dirt
To haunt the Earth above
Revenge is all fucking seek
Tonight there is no love
And to those helpless culprits
I'll reek catastrophe
And only then will I rest in peace
For all eternity
