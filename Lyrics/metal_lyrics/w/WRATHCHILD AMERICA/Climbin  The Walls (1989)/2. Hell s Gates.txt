When you see me comin'
and you hear me cry
you see the look of fear
and the chill in my eye

you play the killers game, all the faces have no names
he'll come to hunt you out and he'll live to cut you down
now your god can't help you, you are on your own
he'll drag you through the fiery gates to bow before his throne

Satan waits
at hells gates
Desecrate
pain, torture, hate
Destruction lies far down below
Hells gates are filled with fire
Love has no hidden meaning
You're cursed and damned a liar
Satan waits
at hells gates
Desecrate
pain, torture, hate

Live in hatred die in grief
Challenging my disbelief
Burning flames are boiling my brain
Lucifer inflicting the pain
Wretched life that didn't matter
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
You lie decaying your final chapter
Your misused soul lies in his clutch

You got nowhere to run got nowhere to hide
There's turmoil all around you like
The coming of the tide
Now you can't help but wonder
About your after life
When you wake up dead
Horns or halo, burn or fly

Live in hatred die in grief
Challenging my disbelief
Burning flames are boiling my brain
Lucifer inflicting the pain
