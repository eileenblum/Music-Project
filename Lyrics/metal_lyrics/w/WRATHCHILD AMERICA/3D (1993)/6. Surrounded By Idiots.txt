All through my life every day's the same
And they tell me I'm losing again
I can talk until I'm blue in the face
But can you tell me who's the one to blame

And what are you gonna do when we get old
And we're tired of doing what we're told
Because the government's broke and we're out of place
In a country that's already been sold

I don't know what to think
But I know what I see
I think I'll have another drink
You wanna join me?

I can't make sense out of any of this
The more I try, the more I get pissed
This confusion that I can't erase
Can't seem to crawl out of the abyss

Desperate groupie making a pass
The little slut didn't just want my ass
She said, "I wanna be cool and have a rockstar's kid"
But will the novelty of the bastard last?

I don't know what to think
But I know what I see
I think I'll have another drink
Wanna join me?

Surrounded, Surrounded, Surrounded
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
(Here I am) Surrounded, I'm surrounded, surrounded
Surrounded by idiots

The TV gods and the Jesus freaks and the flag burners
And the rapists, and the murderers, would you check out
All the geeks...I can't believe what walks the streets
From Hollywood to D.C.

You banned little red riding hood
censored mister rogers' neighborhood
I go to jail if they find a seed
But meanwhile the mayor runs free

Now I know what I think
And I know what I see
I say everything sucks
You agree!

Surrounded, Surrounded, Surrounded
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
(Here I am) Surrounded, I'm surrounded, surrounded
Surrounded by idiots!
