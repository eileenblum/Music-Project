Who's got creative control
What governs imagination
The object is not right or wrong
The answer lies deep down within you

What's wrong with expressing our feelings
Through corporate lies and business lows
We will overcome the wheeling and dealing
And wade knee deep through the shit

Don't walk around, walk through you
Make you open your mind
Got no time for closed minds
3-D man, 3-D man

One dimension-now's the time
Two dimension-use your mind

Why must people categorize
Live the propaganda lies
I learned not to believe the hype
Just go with the urge to create

I got no time for closed minds
I got my feet on the ground, not in it
I don't see in tunnel vision or in black and white
"Cause I'm a 3-D man, I'm a 3-D man
I don't walk around, walk through you
Make you open your mind
Got no time for closed minds
3-D man, 3-D man

One dimension-now's the time
Two dimension-you gotta use your mind
'Cause I'm a three dimensional man
I'm a three dimensional man
