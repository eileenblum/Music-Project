Falsify, riding on the wings of time
Ancient tribes saw the future in fire
Reason for departure will void all questions
We didn't have this sort of thing in mind
De-evolution's started, we can only lay down
And hope there's a better place

People talking, judgment walking, evaluation's coming soon
Parallel minds buying their time, gonna find the end of mankind

Electrify, crowds of people turn and stare
No disguise, watch our lives get re-arranged
A public announcement about to be made
For all of those concerned to hear
There are people outside, all wanna come in
Come on in out of the rain

Buildings standing, bodies falling, evaluation's coming soon
Parallel minds buying their time, gonna find the end

Time for change before it's too late
Peace must reign, it's such a shame
You don't know what the future has in store for you

Time for change, it's such a shame
Peace must reign, before it's too late

No more lies, there's not a cloud up in the sky
Tempers flare, see the world go through a change
Life as we knew it just ain't the same
The children will ask the reasons why
How good and evil both live in fear
From conflict that started in the brain

Time for change before it's too late
Peace must reign, it's such a shame
You don't know what the future holds for you

Time for change before it's too late
Peace must reign, it's such a shame
You don't know what the future has in store for you
