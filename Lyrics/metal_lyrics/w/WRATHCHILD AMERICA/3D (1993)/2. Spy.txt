I can see what you saw through my eyes
Every move you made I visualize
I dust for prints, I look through magnified eyes
I'm the confidant of behavioral science

And you're having a good time
Making innocents bleed
Now it's all I can bear
I'm gonna make you disappear

I got a double major in criminology
You'd have to be invisible to get past me
I got a nose like a hound on a fox's path
I keep myself busy huntin' psychopaths

Are you having a good time?
I see you've made the front page
Now it's all I can bear
I'm gonna make you disappear
I can make you disappear

You took your time and picked your crime
One in a million for me to find
One little clue you left behind
Evaluate your mistake
Got me a sign, now you're running out of time

Everybody knows me by name
But they don't recognize me when I change
I swear I got eyes in the back of my head
I can see in the dark, I got the infrared

Got you in my sights, there's no place to run
You know it's too late,
'cause there's a voice in your head
But you don't wanna hear
Now enough has been said
It's time to make you disappear

I can make you disappear
And you're having a good time
Making innocents bleed
It's all I can bear
I'm gonna make you disappear
