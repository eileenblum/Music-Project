The game is never ending
No escape
Here's something you don't understand
Well, that's your mistake
Pain for pleasure, pleasure for pain
Hooks through your skin like a needle in the brain

Parasitoris, razor blade, blood on the mattress, reincarnate
It's time to play so don't be a tease
You summoned us up, now it's time to please
This isn't a dream and all is not well
Your suffering will be legendary
Even in hell

The doctor is in
What's your pleasure, sir?
You want my recommendation
I say amputation

Now is the time, time to lose reality
There's so many things to see in the other world
Now you're here, you can scream it's a dream
Nothing you have ever seen in this other place
It's the time, time to lose reality
There's so many things to see in this other world
Now you're here, you can scream it's a dream
Nothing you have ever seen
Lost without a trace

Now your head is spinning, your mind's gone wild
Lost like a rat in a maze
You know you can't escape me, child
I can see you from miles away
It's from your mistakes that you can learn
Play with fire, you're sure to get burned
Well, I'm the fire in the hole
And I'm here to burn your soul

The torture is your subconscious desire
A lesson in ecstasy
You wear your skin so well, deceiver
Through those eyes I can't see
Smile as the living arrow enters
And to think I waited this long

Now is the time, time to lose reality
There's so many things to see in the other world
Now you're here, you can scream it's a dream
Nothing you have ever seen in this other place
It's the time, time to lose reality
There's so many things to see in this other world
Now you're here, you can scream it's a dream
Nothing you have ever seen
Lost without a trace

Now is the time
Time to lose reality
There's so many things to see
When you're in this other world
