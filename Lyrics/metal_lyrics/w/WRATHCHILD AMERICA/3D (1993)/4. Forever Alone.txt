You walk around with that smile on your face
Making people think you care
What you don't know is I can see through your facade
The darkness overrides the glare

You better watch yourself. Be careful what you do.

You make your friends so you can slip into their lives
Try and bring them down with you
Always talking shit about premonitions and predictions
Now I'm catching on to you

You better watch yourself. Be careful what you do.
Power can create a fool
You're gonna wake up one that's more powerful than you

Always wished for things
Not always wishing for the right things
Taking for granted things you can't even begin to understand
In this lifetime

Ever wonder how you learned to loathe
Ever wonder where you planned to go
Is this dark trick what you really want
To be forever alone

You can't look me in the eye
You bite your tongue and taste the blood
Look in the mirror and you cry
You hate yourself

You better watch yourself. Be careful what you do.
Sometimes hatred turns on you
You gotta learn to be afraid of what your fate
Might hold you to

You better watch yourself. Be careful what you do.
In this game there are no rules
And you can never win, because too much pride's the ultimate sin

Take heed to the warning
There's no revenge that's sweet enough
For the grief you'll endure
When you explore....
