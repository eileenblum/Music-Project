In the heat of the day, feel the power of the sun
Sweat burns your eyes like an acid shower
Buzzards overhead show no mercy for no one
An imminent death from the epitome of power
Now, look to the sky, it never ends, it just begins

Go ahead and try to outrun the heat
Sand feels like fire to your feet
As you look around for miles and miles
Panic sets in as the desert smiles

Now, look to the sky, it never ends, it just begins
Desert grins

The desert smiles
Give up your soul to the land
The desert smiles
You realize that you're merely man

Dusk falls cooling the brain in your skull
You can make up some time, but which way to go
Now here comes the night and you're freezing in blackness
The earth comes alive as you drift into madness

Now, look to the sky, through swollen eyes, you'll never win
Now, nighttime sets in, the desert is your only friend

The desert smiles
Give up your soul to the land
The desert smiles
Trapped in a living, breathing blanket of sand
The desert smiles
Don't you try to understand
The desert smiles
You realize that you're merely man
