I can not believe
The bullshit you eat
Replace all aesthetic
Trends with a wasteland
Mimicking influenced
By constant bombardment
Absurd and stupid
Idiots fuck-em
Complacency runs rampant
On this fucking planet
A universal concept
I can't fucking grasp
A daily dose of bullshit
From warped idiots
Fucking meaningless
Mindless opinions
Here we go again
Another fucking trend
Poseur wannabes
The new elite
I need more ammo for all these assholes
You choose to avoid
I fuck and destroy
You can not relate
Let me fucking translate
It's not if it's when
Siphon out this shit
Fanatic unstable
Cynical fuck you all
I can't take this shit no more
Another fucking day and I swear I'll blow
My fucking brains out on the floor
A fitting end for the status quo
I'm Gods most fuck up creation
Never any warning and no hesitation
I'll burn in hell when the reaper comes
Bring it motherfucker if you want some
I can not believe
The bullshit you eat
Replace all aesthetic
Trends with a wasteland
Mimicking influenced
By constant bombardment
Absurd and stupid
Idiots fuck-em
