What the fuck
They just can't understand
The world we fuckin live in
Our hatred of all women
Here's my response
Fuck you
I extend both middle fingers
To every motherfucker
You think we give a shit
Fuck your opinion
Anti this pro that
It's all the fucking same to me
The mainstream the opposition
Sellouts the enemy
All you fuckers fall in line
And open up your mouths
Eating up what they shit out
All this talk about
A perfect fucking global blueprint
Sexual abstinence,
Social dialectic bullshit
I just want to fuck every cunt
That fucking moves
Everyday alcohol abuse
All these bands think I care
About their fucking stance
On ideology or fucking foreign policy
That shit's a joke. I have the antidote
Pass the bowl get me fuckin stoned
You say you stand for what
We don't give a fuck
Brainwashed by bullshit
Keep it fucking suck
Not politically correct
Outcasts nonconformists
Tolerance the cause
Acceptance the effect
I have the solution
Tell these motherfuckers
To shove it up their ass
We're the putrid few
Shove it up their ass
We don't give a fuck
If you hate us
Don't buy our shit
Mission accomplished!!!
