Far past pissed off
A fucking understatement
Incite a riot through provocation
Bloodshed solicited like a fucking sermon
Silenced as I split your fucking skull open
Inflict permanent
Damage and pain
I can't hold back
My hatred sustained
You'll have to kill me I'll never give in
Violence the only fucking option
Reason doesn't fucking exist
Restraint doesn't fucking exist
In my mind pain doesn't exist
In my mind pure fucking chaos
Fuck it my mindset
I'm a motherfucker
All out assault
When you set me off
What you fucking see is what you fucking get
Face to face what the fuck you gonna do about it
A fucking understatement
Incite a riot through provocation
Bloodshed solicited like a fucking sermon
Silenced as I split your fucking skull open
Inflict permanent
Damage and pain
I can't hold back
My hatred sustained
You'll have to kill me I'll never give in
Violence the only fucking option
Reason doesn't fucking exist
Restraint doesn't fucking exist
In my mind pain doesn't exist
In my mind pure fucking chaos
I'm the stereotypical
Antagonist radical
My social status clinical
A one man army that's lethal
Unyielding to my enemies
Master of brutality
The undisputed unholy
Just stay the fuck away from me
Inflammatory - provocation
Get fucking ready for retaliation
Let the hatred flow
It's lethal agony is what I offer all
You've been warned
The raw power unpredictable
You're not safe
My impulses don't discriminate
Challenge me carnage is fucking guaranteed
Far past pissed off
A fucking understatement
Incite a riot through provocation
Bloodshed solicited like a fucking sermon
Silenced as I split your fucking skull open
Inflict permanent
Damage and pain
I can't hold back
My hatred sustained
You'll have to kill me I'll never give in
Violence the only fucking option
Reason doesn't fucking exist
Restraint doesn't fucking exist
In my mind pain doesn't exist
In my mind pure fucking chaos
