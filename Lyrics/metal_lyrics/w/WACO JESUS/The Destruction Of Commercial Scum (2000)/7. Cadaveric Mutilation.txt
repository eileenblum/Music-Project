A fascination with mutilating the dead
I view internal organs during disembowelment
draped in your intestines there's nothing left
no evidence of your life or your existence
no skin tissue or fragments
you have dropped off the earth
post mortal
cease to exist
fuck your soul
awaiting troop of sickness
extinction of the weak
dropping off the face of the earth
I file your teeth down
blow your head off at point blank range
with a sawed off shotgun
mutilation of the dead
high on drugs fucked up
immortal I'm god
your god can eat shit
pure hatred
fuck you
cutting you from your crotch up
removing your fucking guts
puncturing vessels
severing your breasts and sewing them on myself
I fondle them slowly
nauseated from the sight of the dead
salivating from my mouth
butchering bodies
exploring pleasures deep within your bowels
