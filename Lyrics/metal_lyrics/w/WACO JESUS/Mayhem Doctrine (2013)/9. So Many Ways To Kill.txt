Gore! More fucking gore
So many ways to kill a motherfucker
Like stringing 'em up for a slow grizzly torture

Plenty more to mutilate
Plenty more to desecrate

Blood! More fucking blood
i watch the body convulse in fucking agony
Unable to scream cause I've punctured both kidneys

Plenty more to terrorize
Plenty more to brutalize

Clubbing you with a crowbar
Smashing in your skull
Disciple of the Devil
You're never found and I'm always on the hunt
For another one

Carving out your eyes
Then I smash 'em with my boot
Both barrels up your cunt
And then I fucking shoot

I watch your body bleed out
From a thousand dripping slits
Then I soak you in a chemical
That eats away the skin

Infected by
Mind-rotting visions
Of bodily skinnings
Burnings and
Amputations
Bashed and slashed
In and out of consciousness

Then a hatchet to the head
Brings you to your knees
A hammer to the hatchet
The split is complete

So many ways to kill
So many ways to kill
So many ways to kill
So many ways to kill
