Stealth assassinations
Conspiracies
Cynical suppression
Half truth theories

From ancient tribes to current times
Tyrannical concepts to closed up minds
Encrypted codes secret symbols
Protect our inner circle

The media is complicit
Day in day out
Under surveillance
Skeptics that doubt

The unseen hands pushing buttons
Controlling the masses from behind a curtain
Apocalyptic prophecies
Deception is the fucking key

Provoking thought to dangerous
Shut 'em down shut 'em up
Concealment of our collision course
Cover-up lie and distort

Clandestine plots aids and disease
Foreign countries under siege
Suicides deaths unexplained
Accomplices fall to their fate

Conducting secret practices
Manipulating world events

The Illuminati and Freemasons
Skull and bones the Rosicrucians
They demonize their enemies
Well funded by blood money

Propaganda espionage
Agencies of sabotage
Fraudulent and corrupt
No one seems to give a fuck

Mysticism, initiation
Long tradition of fame and fortune
Too many to be a coincidence

Protecting our inner circle

I pledge allegiance
To never give a fuck
