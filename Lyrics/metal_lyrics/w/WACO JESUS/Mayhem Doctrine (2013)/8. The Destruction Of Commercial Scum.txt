Extreme, no fucking gimmicks
Bone crushing riffs at break neck speeds
Getting fucking paid with alcohol and weed

We keep playing shitty gigs
We keep playing shitty clubs
They don't call this fucking music
They call it fucking garbage

A chokehold, who's in control?
The death of CD's the rise of MP3's
Our aggression is fueled by failure and obscurity

Another decade of cliches
More slogans to obey
Make you think it's what you want
Why don't they shut the fuck up

The destruction of commercial scum
The destruction of commercial scum
The destruction of commercial scum
The destruction of commercial scum

My way or the fucking highway
Go fuck yourself I crawl town to town
Year after year throughout the underground

We keep playing shitty gigs
We keep playing shitty clubs
They don't call it music
They call it fucking garbage

Sell out your claim to shame
Poisoned by fucking dollar signs
Here today gone tomorrow worthless motherfuckers

Another decade of cliches
More slogans to obey
Make you think it's what you want
Why don't they shut the fuck up

The destruction of commercial scum
The destruction of commercial scum
The destruction of commercial scum
The destruction of commercial scum

Unthreatening to the masses
To me it's fucking madness
Please tell me fucking how
You motherfuckers bow
Down and sacrifice integrity
For the elites the mainstream and majority
There's incompetent fucks calling all the shots
You're like a whore being forced to suck a cock
