I want it all or fucking nothing at all
I don't think that's a lot to ask for
I've got a hand on with a pulse you're gonna feel it
in every fucking hole
Don't waste your time chasing short bursts of high
On the world wide waste of time
You're gonna sin so sin like you mean it
You're going once around this fucking ride

Instant gratification
The only fucking cure for terminal boredom
Paralysis of the mind
In a millisecond
An appetite for consumption

My desiring
Of desires
Overload, erode
Sensory wires
My desiring
Of desires
Slowly increases
Higher and higher

Seriously fucked up from
Lack of stimulation
Consuming hazardous amounts of
Forced repetition

There's a fucking sick plague raging in my brain
Invoking intense neurosis
Gratification the need for stimulation
Until I'm 6 feet under and rotten
Put this mother fucker on a suicide watch
Everyday around the fucking clock
Fuck any limits I refuse to resist
I'm obsessed, hard wired, impulsive

Instant gratification
the only fucking cure for terminal boredom
Paralysis of the mind
In a millisecond
An appetite for consumption

My desiring
Of desires
Overload, erode
Sensory wires
My desiring
Of desires
Slowly increasing
Higher and higher
