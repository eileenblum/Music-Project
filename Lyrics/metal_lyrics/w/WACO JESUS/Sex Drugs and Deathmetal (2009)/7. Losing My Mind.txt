Objectification, a constant threat
To societies moral threads
Anything you want, just take it
Race to the bottom, who will get there first?
You think it's bad now? it's gonna get worse
Coming at you live, rigth now real time
Coming at you live, rigth now real time

Losing my mind

Something else, but nothing new
Colliding with my fuck you attitude

The redefining elements and the lingering effects
Of the never ending cycle of repiticious shit

Losing my mind, losing my mind
Losing my mind, lose it

Neglected populations, with no human ambition
Pathetic populations, no human ambition
