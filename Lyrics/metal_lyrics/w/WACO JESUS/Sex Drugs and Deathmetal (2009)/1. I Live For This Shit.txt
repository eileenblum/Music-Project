This is our time our era
We are takin' this to the limit
City by city we'll conquer
We ain't takin' no prisoners
We don't need a label
We are independant
This is what we live for
We eat, shit and breathe this

We're the new social disease
The definition of the world sleaze
On your knees
I live for this shit!!!

What you see is what you fucking get
No regonition for accomplishment
Fuck it cause I live for this shit!!!

Our armies and our allies span the globe
Living by the universal code
Here we go
I live for this shit!!!

No nonsense or elitist bullshit
It's rude, crude, raw and fucking primitive
Look out cause we're coming to your fucking town
To throw down

Unsigned, keep it in the underground
Unsigned, keep it in the underground
Unsigned, keep it in the underground
Underground
