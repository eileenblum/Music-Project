They saturate
And hype this world with
Over-rated bullshit
I just can't take it... no more

I don't get depressed
I have no regrets
I just say fuck it... cause I'm

Going down... going down in flames
Rethink? Reconsider?
No fucking way

I don't need
No ones permission
Or you forgiveness
Hers' my confesiÃ³n

I'm arrogant
Fucking bellicerant
I have more self respect
Than to go out like a bitch

Crash and burn
No return
I'm going down
At the fucking speed of sound

I represent
Everything
That you fucking hate
In a human being

I'm... going... down...in flames
I'm... going... down...in flames
