Here's a toast to all of us fuck-ups
Living with no code of conduct
Here's a toast to all of us fuck-ups
Living just to get wasted

Here's a toast to all of us fuck-ups
Living just for the moment
Here's a toast to all of us fuck-ups
Living just to get wasted

Controversial, unregulated motherfuckers
Take a look, how irrelevant you've become
That's right, we're the superstars of tomorrow
We're the new role models

Nothing, nothing in common with us
Cause we just don't give a fuck
Nothing in common... with us

Nothing, nothing in common with us
Cause we just don't give a fuck
Nothing in common... fuck off

Same old shit, every motherfucking day
The same standards, still in practice still in play
Pull your heads out your motherfucking ass
Try something different

Nothing, nothing in common with us
Cause we just don't give a fuck
Nothing in common... with us
