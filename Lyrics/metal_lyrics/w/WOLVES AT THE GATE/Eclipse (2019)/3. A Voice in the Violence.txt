Tell me I'm yours
Tell me I'm not alone
Falling apart in this silence alone
Tell me I'm yours...
Tell me I'm not alone!

I see the night slipping over
It crawls along coming closer
I feel the lies pull me under
I hear your voice like it's thunder

You're falling in love with the silence
It's telling you all that you want to hear
You're falling in love with the violence
It's telling you all that you want to hear

I crept along in the shadows
I drowned the guilt in the shallows
It's buried now, covered in doubt
I hear your voice
Tell me I'm not alone

You're falling in love with the silence
It's telling you all that you want to hear
You're falling in love with the violence
It's telling you all that you want to hear

(I'm all alone
Tell me I'm not alone)

Tell me I'm yours
Tell me I'm not alone
Tell me that I'm not alone in this world
Tell me I'm not...

I drowned out your voice
And hardened my heart to stone
I filled all my voids
But opened my wounds
The pain digs in deeper and deeper

I filled all the voids
But opened my wounds
The pain digs in deeper and deeper

A voice cut its way through the silence
Telling me of love that is sincere
You quiet my heart from the violence

You're falling in love with the silence
It's telling you all that you want to hear
You're falling in love with the violence
It's telling you all that you want to hear
Forgiveness despite my defiance
Telling me of love that is sincere
Forgiveness despite my defiance
Telling me of love that is sincere
