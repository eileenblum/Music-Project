We just don't care
I think that we all know, we're well aware
Swallowed in shadows but still don't care
I think that we all know, we're well aware
There's no self-repair

Tell me it isn't true, these cries are ruthless
And "hatred without a cause" a just illusion
Nations all rage against, though it's useless
But are we that much different?
It's a delusion

If knowledge is the power then evil are the kings we are
If knowledge is the power then evil are the kings we are

Listen and hear the truth, we drown in patience
While anchored to our hatred, we're sinking deeper
Resisting the hand to save, we turn to violence
With armor of apathy we're getting weaker

If knowledge is the power then evil are the kings we are
If knowledge is the power then evil are the kings we are

How long will we fight the beauty in all the light?
How long 'til we find our way through the night?

We just don't care
I thing that we all know we're well aware
Swallowed in shadows but still don't care
I think that we all know we're well aware
There's no self-repair

Tell me it isn't true, hatred without a cause
Tell me all isn't lost, we're fighting without any cause

If knowledge is the power then evil are the kings we are
If knowledge is the power then evil are the kings we are
