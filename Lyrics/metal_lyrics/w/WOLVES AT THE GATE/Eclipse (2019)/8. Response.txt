Will you believe?
Will you receive?
Will you believe?
Will you receive?

Will you believe? Or just count it all as vain?
Will you believe? Or just write it off
Count it all as waste? Will you believe?

I'm not selling you lies, just a beggar who has found favor
Show me what you despise, a selfless Savior?

You find a lot of fault in me
I find it hard to disagree with you
I'll own my crimes
My guilt has shut my mouth

Will you believe?
Will you believe the words I say?
Will you receive?
Will you receive this faithful truth?
I'm not tricking you, I'm not selling truth
I just want you to hear of this matchless love!

I'm not selling you lies, just a beggar who has found favor
Show me what you despise, a selfless Savior?
Will you believe? Or just count it all as vain?
Will you believe? Or just write it off
Count it all as waste? Will you believe?

What is the fault you find in Him?
To come and cure the desperate sin-sick and pay their crimes
Is there a greater love?

Will you believe?
Will you believe the words I say?
Will you receive?
Will you receive this faithful truth?
I'm not tricking you, I'm not selling truth
I just want you to know of this perfect love!
I'm not tricking you, I'm not selling truth
I just want you to know of this perfect love!

I'm not selling you lies, just a beggar who has found favor
Show me what you despise, a selfless Savior?
Will you believe? Or just count all as vain?
Will you believe? Or just write it off
Count it all as waste? Will you believe?
