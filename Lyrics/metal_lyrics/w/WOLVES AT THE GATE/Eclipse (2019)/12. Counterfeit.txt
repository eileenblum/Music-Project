I won't believe a single word no matter what you say
You won't make me into your pawn or now become your prey

You speak of peace but the house is burning
It's burning down
Put iodine in the well we're drinking
It's poisoning

I don't believe we fell for your masquerade
You won't make me into your pawn
(We won't believe)

I've caught the beat and rhythm of the shallow words you say
It's all just lies you're hiding so we don't see your decay
It's all just lies and vanity falling from your mouth

(We won't believe)

It's all just vanity and lies from your mouth
It's all insanity disguised
You tell us truth is the path we've chosen
It's treachery
Infect the youth with the truth you've woven
It's villany

I see right through your careful worded charade
You won't make me into your pawn
(We won't believe)

I've caught the beat and rhythm of the shallow words you say
It's all just lies you're hiding so we don't see your decay
It's all just lies and vanity falling from your mouth

(We won't believe)

I've caught the beat and rhythm of the shallow words you say
It's all just lies you're hiding so we don't see your decay
I've caught the beat and rhythm of the shallow words you say
It's all just lies you're hiding so we don't see your decay
It's all just lies and vanity falling from your mouth
