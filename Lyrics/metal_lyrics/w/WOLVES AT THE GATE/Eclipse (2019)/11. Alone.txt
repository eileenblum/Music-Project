Alone
Face the truth of what will soon transpire
The time elapsed is going to expire
All alone we hurtle towards the sun
The beauty and the terror has begun
Flames swallow the night

Terror alone won't make you believe and see the beauty
Shutting your eyes to darken won't help it, eventually we'll see
Steady your legs and brace yourself because there's nowhere to run
Ready or not we all will now see that we're heading for the sun
Alone

Trace the warmth, begin to feel the fire
Fading in my hands it all expires
Desperate for release the crowd divides
The panic and peace start to collide

Flames swallow the night
Comfort from the light
It burns eternally

Terror alone won't make you believe and see the beauty
Shutting your eyes to darken won't help it, eventually we'll see
Steady your legs and brace yourself because there's nowhere to run
Ready or not we all will now see that we're heading for the sun

Embracing forever, surely the comfort all of the beggars have now come to know
The face of forever burning on our hearts, burning on our hearts
Alone

Terror alone won't make you believe and see the beauty
Shutting your eyes to darken won't help it, eventually we'll see
Steady your legs and brace yourself because there's nowhere to run
Ready or not we all will now see that we're heading for the sun

Embracing forever, surely the comfort all of the beggars have now come to know
The face of forever burning on our hearts, burning on our hearts
