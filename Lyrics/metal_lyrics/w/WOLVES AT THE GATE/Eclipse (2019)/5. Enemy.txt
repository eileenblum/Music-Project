I've got a new enemy, but is it you is it me?
I've got a feeling that all I fear has come for me
I can't wait 'til I see it coming, I will face it alone

I've got a new enemy, but is it you is it me?
You know it's starting to look and sound a lot like me
I can see that it's coming closer
Listen close and you'll hear it whisper
I'm coming for you now

Can you see it? Or will you hear it?
The silhouette of my enemy
Can you feel it? Or will you know it?
I've got a feeling it's come for me

I've got an old enemy, but I think it's just me
I find it hard to believe the facts, the irony
All the lies that I held so dearly
Gouge my eyes so I can't see clearly
Gripped my throat and they nearly killed me
I can't face it alone

Can you see it? Or will you hear it?
The silhouette of my enemy
Can you feel it? Or will you know it?
I've got a feeling it's come for me

I'm lost now, find me!
All along I was my enemy

I couldn't see it, I couldn't hear it
The silhouette of my enemy
I couldn't feel it, I didn't know it
That I alone was the enemy

Can you see it? Or will you hear it?
The silhouette of my enemy
Can you feel it? Or will you know it?
I've got a feeling it's come for me
Break me out of this warfare waging alone
I can't escape
Break me out of this warfare waging alone
I can't escape
