The truth of my lies is tearing up these eyes because the fire is gone
To wash off this stain I would have to burn it all and start it again
If I fall away will I ever see Your face? Is it much too late?
Have I gone too far? Am I on the narrow road?

I've worn out a path, a path that leads to death
And I darkened my eyes
Cold to Your love, am I inscribed upon Your hands? Am I known at all?

If I fall away will I ever see Your face? Is it much too late?
Have I gone too far? Am I on the narrow road that leads to home?

I'm falling beneath You, I'm calling to take me home
I'm falling beneath You, I'm calling to take me home
I'm falling beneath You, I'm calling to take me home
I'm falling beneath You, I'm calling to take me home

Though I fall away, it is then I find more grace
Though I'm desolate
Though I've gone too far, far beyond the narrow road
You lead me home

It is then I find more grace
Though I'm desolate
Far beyond the narrow road
You lead me home
Though I fall away, it is then I find more grace
