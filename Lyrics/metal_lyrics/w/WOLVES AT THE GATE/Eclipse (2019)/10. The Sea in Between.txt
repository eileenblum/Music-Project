Will you carry me across and redeem what I have lost?
What I lost!

Divided, as the sea becomes my war
Surrounded, and I'm swallowed in its roar
Sinking down below to the ocean's floor
Lost, forsaken it spits me back out to shore
Every time I navigate these seas, I am left with nothing

Still You carry me across
You carried me across
And You suffer all my loss
You suffered what I caused

The horizon paints a ghostly sight as the vessel billows in the night
The waters taunt me to return as they toss and scatter the ship they've
torn
Wreckage in the sea sings my eulogy
Overcome by the scene that's in front of me
Every time I navigate these seas, I am left with nothing

Still You carry me across
You carried me across
And You suffer all my loss
You suffered what I caused

Wreckage in the sea sings my eulogy
Overcome by the scene that's in front of me
Every time I navigate these seas, I am left with nothing

I've filled up this sea and created its divide
Every drop of its curse is the wall I've fortified
I will accept my death for it is warranted and true
But I cannot come to grips with separation from You

Still You carry me across
You carried me across
And You suffer all my loss
You suffered what I caused

Still You carried me and You suffer all my loss
You suffered all my loss

You lift me up above the sea and carried me through the dross
The waves they crashed upon Your frame, You suffered all my loss
This rescue came with suffering completely at Your cost
It tore your body through and through but You brought me safe across
