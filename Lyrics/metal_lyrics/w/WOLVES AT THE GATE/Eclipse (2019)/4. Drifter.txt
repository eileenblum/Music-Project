A perilous load is resting on my back and
A merciless road is what is set before me
A terrible path is mine to walk and mine alone
Mine to walk alone

Don't worry anymore
I'll do this on my own
Don't worry anymore
I'll walk this path alone

All I know is I'm missing the signs, buying my time
Eventually I know I'll fall below and drift out of line
Drifting away
Imprisoned in my mind

I stagger along this wretched path I've wandered
Reopening wounds that are familiar to me
The sirens are calling me but I can't look away
I can't look away

It's tearing me apart
I knew it from the start
It's tearing me apart
It's ripping out my heart

All I know is I'm missing the signs, buying my time
Eventually I know I'll fall below and drift out of line
Drifting away
Imprisoned in my mind

The voices roar, tormenting all my dreams
They mock and they roar
Exposing history
What good has come from them but suffering and pain?
My misery will die with them tonight

It's tearing me apart
I knew it from the start
It's tearing me apart
It's ripping out my heart

All I know is I'm missing the signs, buying my time
Eventually I know I'll fall below and drift out of line
Drifting away
Imprisoned in my mind

There's nothing left I'm done with all this pain!
I'm yours to save so help me find my way
Fall below and drift out of line
Drifting away
I'm yours to save
