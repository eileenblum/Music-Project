I know I've shocked and stormed the heavens
I fear betrayal lives and flows in my blood
I can't kill the curse or claim the blessing
Living in death and shame

How many songs of my betrayal
Will I have sung before it's fatal?
Though all my words are weak and tired
Your love still blossoms like a fire

My betrayal
Is it fatal?
Weak and tired
Feel the fire

I know I cannot reach the heavens
Wearing a harlot's heart, cursing Your name
But You take the curse, give me the blessing
Bearing my death and shame

I feel it burning like a fire
O' Love that will not let me go
I feel it burning like a fire
O' Love that will not let me go

How many songs of my betrayal?
(Feel it burning like a fire)
Will I have sung before it's fatal?
(Won't let me go)
Though all my words are weak and tired
(Feel it burning like a fire)
Your love still blossoms like a fire
(Won't let me go)
O' Love that reaches from the heavens
To wretched, rebel hearts lost and alone
You took my curse â gave me Your blessing
Giving me hope in death
