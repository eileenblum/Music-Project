We're fighting for our lives
What we deserve is nothing
Which one of us survives?
I fear that history repeats itself
The history repeats itself

We haven't found the shame that ties us to our name
(Are we bound? Are we free?)
The terrors of the past are not long forgotten when history repeats itself
The errors have amassed, they're spoiled, they're rotten
When history repeats itself

We're fighting for our lives
What we deserve is nothing
Which one of us survives?
Will we be free?
Is it the hate that dies, or just another victim?
Which one of us survives?
Will we be free?

We haven't found the shame that binds us to our name
When the colors that we choose make us pawns in a game
There's no one else to blame
(Are we bound? Are we free?)
The terrors of the past are not long forgotten when history repeats itself
The errors have amassed, they're spoiled, they're rotten
Prove a war is still waging

We're fighting for our lives
What we deserve is nothing
Which one of us survives?
Will we be free?
Is it the hate that dies, or just another victim?
Which one of us survives?
Will we be free?

Suddenly we're drowning on these tepid seas
We are so indifferent
Do we all believe that we're finally free?
Free?
The history repeats itself

Are we all alone now on these trepid seas?
Do we all believe that we're finally free?
