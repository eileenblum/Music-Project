I can taste the misery
Spitting out the remedy
All I've been through, all that I've seen
These eyes, this heart still can't dispel the lies

I don't know if I can feel it
Floating downward, fading slowly
Static message, cryptic signals
Cataracts can't see things clearly

Divide the cure from the poison and misery
Sever the ties that enslave and are killing me

Take it all as I stumble and lose control
I was chasing nothing
Take it all, all the torment inside my soul
Watch it fade to nothing...

Scales begin to fall from my eyes
Floating downward, fading slowly
Vibrant message, glaring signals
Brilliant light shines piercing through me

Divide the cure from the poison and misery
Sever the ties that enslave and are killing me
Divide the cure from the poison and misery
Sever the ties that enslave and are killing me

Sever the ties that have filled me with doubt
Wring out this heart make it bleed out the curse that's plaguing my eyes
Gasping to catch my breath, I feel the poison dissolving
Filled with the remedy, I once cast aside

Take it all as I stumble and lose control
I was chasing nothing
Take it all, all the torment inside my soul
Watch it fade to nothing...

Chasing nothing!

Filled with the remedy, I'm gaining clarity
Oh God, destroy what poisons me
Destroy what poisons me
