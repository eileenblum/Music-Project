Walk with me and follow close and you will start to feel
The chilling grip of hollow lies and what is truly real
Hear the echoes
Face to face with distant fears that I had thought were numb
They clip my heel and bring to light what I have become
Echoes
Everything I fear

Listen closely, every seed must die before
Die before it can grow
Sinking slowly, to be planted in the dust
Long before it can grow

A sickness spread across my limbs, I'm planted in the dust
Long before it can grow
A sickness spread across my limbs, I'm covered head to toe
Here I'm standing face to face
A sight I cannot bear
I'm clawing and scratching to turn from what I see
The chilling grip of all my lies and what is truly real
I can hardly hear

Listen closely, every seed must die before
Die before it can grow
Sinking slowly, to be planted in the dust
Long before it can grow

It's darkening and fading out
Darkening, fading out!

Standing at the great divide
I fell into the ground and died
The taste of death was bittersweet
I fell into the ground and died
But death made me alive

Listen closely, every seed must die before
Die before it can grow
Sinking to slowly, to be planted in the dust
Long before we can grow
