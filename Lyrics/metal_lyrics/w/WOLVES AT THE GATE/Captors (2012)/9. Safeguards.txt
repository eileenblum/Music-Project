These eyes have seen the joys yet suffered
Mind and body
Though still I'll sing
"How Great Thou Art"

Calm my heart
And give me
Still peace
Within my very soul

These eyes have seen the joys yet suffered
Mind and body
Though still I'll sing
"How Great Thou Art"

When strength turns
To crippled
I've learned to silence the world and listen

Blood staining
Your footprints
For surely You went before this son

Through all the chaos
And noise I've learned
I've learned to silence
The world and listen
Still I'm singing of
How Great You Are
For surely You went before this son

When safeguards
Turn captors
The haven never been seen so clearly

My constant
Delivers
All the surety that He hears me

How can I
Repay You
Lord for
This all-forgiving love?

For it's the sight of Christ upon the tree
That surely
Will always still
And humble me

Guard my heart
And give me peace
Within my soul
Within my soul

How can I
Repay You Lord
For this bounty of love?
This bounty of love?

How can I
Repay You Lord
How can I
Repay You Lord

You will not abandon me
When this body sees decay
Grace and peace has made a home
In this heart that it will stay
It will stay

You will not abandon me
When this body sees decay
Grace and peace has made a home
In this heart that it will stay
It will stay

You will not abandon me
It will stay
When this body sees decay
It will stay
Grace and peace has made a home
It will stay
In this heart that it will stay

For when my safeguards turn to captors
For when my safeguards turn to captors
It will stay
For when my safeguards turn to captors
For when my safeguards turn to captors
Whoa-o-o-o
