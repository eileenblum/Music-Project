I saw these chains locked on my wrists
Around my neck no shackles missed
I'd tried to shake them off and flee
Nowhere to go without a key

Awoke my eyes drew the first breath
New to the world but not to death
This plan devised in secrecy
May take my life or set me free
No more to work this simple life
To toil only met with strife
The evening still and passed the sun
The night crept in my chance to run

I wait for dark!
I wait for dark!
I wait for dark!
No looking back I'm running
I'm running out of sight
I wait for dark!
No looking back I'm running
Running into the night
I wait for dark!

My feet be quick for this racing heart
Come morning's light will the chasing start
With the fear of pursuit comes a fear of the flight
And if I stop they will shoot so I continue to hide
In the cover of the night

The morning bright all darkness gone
I see the distance fade
I take to flight my fears withdraw
My heart is now betrayed

Not a slave to man anymore!
Not a slave to...

Set me free
Set me free
Hammer these chains and
Set me free!

Break these chains
Break these chains
Unbind my hands and
Pardon me!

Ran all this way with the hope this pain would
Now release
Finally cease
What is this freedom if I haven't
Haven't peace
Haven't peace?

Serpent you lied and told me to run
I haven't found repose for I still am undone
This isn't life!
This can't be it!

I've run so far away yet
None of the pieces will fit
I couldn't see
I should have known

This peace abounds at my master's home
Now my heart be still or these feet will fall
All for the will of the master's call

The morning bright all darkness gone
And not afraid
Shown the true light against the dawn
My debt has now been paid
I was lost to save
For I'm the master's slave

For I was lost to save

No looking back I'm running
Running with all my might
No looking back I'm running
Running to the true light

I saw these chains fall off my feet
I stand amazed at this work complete
These not Your they were my own
"Now run no more My son, come home"
