And I was once a dead man
A stranger with no home
I stood opposed to god himself
And yet he pardoned me

With all my heart
And the fiercest will
Desired not but to
Thieve and kill

I hadn't a thought of peace, but war
Surrender was not what I'd endure

I was a murderer
Filled with lies and deceit
Faced with my list of crimes
That I would always repeat

Deliver me!
Wake me up from this damning sleep
I'm surrendering
Pull me out from this wickedness
In this thieving heart of stone
I realized all these sins
I could not atone

I was a murderer
Filled with lies and deceit
Faced with my list of crimes
That I would always repeat

And I was once a dead man
A stranger with no home
I stood opposed to god himself
And yet he pardoned me

So just at the right time
When we were dead in our sins
You took this heart of mine
And gave me life again
And gave me life again
This is where I begin

So far apart
And a debt to fulfill
This purchase bought on redemption's hill
An ailing disease I couldn't cure
Oh this grace!
How rich and pure!

Abide in me
My god!
I am found in you
Pardon me
My god!
You know my deepest thoughts
Deliver me from sin
I am made anew
I'm surrendering
This heart
For which your blood it bought
For which your blood it bought
For which your blood it bought

The mob, they yelled and screamed for justice
That wrath was ours, we are to blame
You made a spectacle of rulers
Denying you of a king's fame

Having crushed the written cannon
That wrote of all our guilt and shame
Displayed upon the tree it was nailed
The saving power of your name

And I was once a dead man
A stranger with no home
You saw this wretch and you gave my life
Forever I'll praise you!

I will praise you!
