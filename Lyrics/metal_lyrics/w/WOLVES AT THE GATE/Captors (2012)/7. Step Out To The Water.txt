Step out to the water and you'll see what I believe
Come out to the water and you'll see of whom I sing

For the seas are raging and the ocean grows
I see your arms are flailing as your panic shows
Look beyond the waves to the One who saves
Still this storm is waging with its fiercest blows
For your knees are shaking at your darkest woes
Look beyond the waves to the One who saves

So just as You have given grace to me
I'm pleading Father that their eyes will see
The clearest vision of Your love shown on Calvary
For redemption's story's in my heart may be seen through me

For the seas were raging as the ocean rose
These very bones are aching and my voice it grows
âCall out to God! Call out to God!â
The only hope is found in Him
âCry out to God!â

Look to the One who calms the seas
His very words cause the storm to seize
I'm calling out, I'm crying out
So as You've given grace to me
Please Father give them eyes to see
Your blood, our sins. It did atone
Without You Lord I'm a sinking stone
I see your body sinking slow
And yet you still fight on your own
How long you'll last I still don't know
Don't you know you're not alone

Step out to the water and you'll see He won't deceive
Come out to the water and you'll see what trust can bring
Cry out to God!

For the seas are raging and the ocean grows
I see your arms are flailing as your panic shows
Look beyond the waves to the One who saves

So just as You have given grace to me
I'm pleading Father that their eyes will see
The clearest vision of Your love shown on Calvary
For redemption's story's in my heart may be seen through me

Step out to the water those with faith can receive
Come out to the water and you'll see the risen King
