John 1:23, 29; Romans 10:17

Wake up! Wake up!

The wolves are biting.
The wolves are clawing and snatching up the sheep.
For if we speak without the truth upon our lips,
We're giving in and weâre falling fast asleep.

Creating more prodigals.
More jaded and worn.
Creating more prodigals.
More jaded and worn.

We organize and strategize.
Yet we're keeping our mouths shut.
(Keeping our mouths shut)
For we are actors without action,
When the cost factors no reaction.
We hide under roof and steeple,
'Cus we're afraid of broken people.

The wolves are biting,
The wolves are clawing and snatching up the sheep.
For if we speak without the truth upon our lips,
We're giving in and weâre falling fast asleep.

Wake up! Wake up!

So if faith comes by hearing,
Why not speaking by preaching?
Though my fear is the half truths
That the many are teaching.

The world is lining you up and bids you to come,
To live on the edge till your heart it is numb.
Lining you up and bids you farewell,
To look like the righteous but still live like hell.

Are we fighting?
Are we fighting or are we asleep?
Are we dying?
Are we dying to aid the sheep?

We compromise in our own eyes,
Yet we're keeping our mouths shut.
(Keeping our mouths shut)
For we are actors without action,
When the cost factors no reaction.
We hide under roof and steeple,
'Cus we're afraid of broken people.

The wolves are biting,
The wolves are clawing and snatching up the sheep.
For if we speak without the truth upon our lips,
We're giving in and weâre falling fast asleep.

So are we crying?
So are we crying to all the lost and dead?
Behold! The lamb of God who takes away
The sins of the whole world by his blood shed.

Making straight the way,
The way of the Lord.
Making straight the way,
The way of the Lord.

âAll of your guilt and all of the wrath of God against you is transferred to Him and he legally bears it away. Do you believe that Jesus Christ really is willing? That you have a sin bearer that takes away all sin, past, present and future!â
