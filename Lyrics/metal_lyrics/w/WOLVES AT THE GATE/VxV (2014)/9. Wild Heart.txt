Titus 3:3-7; Ephesians 2

Knee deep in the swelling seas without a thought
Or realization of my dying need,
I cannot keep out this grim disease
For it has plagued and overtaken all,
All our dying breed.

Waist deep in the oceanâs sleep
Without a thought or realization of my dying need,
(I cannot) canât keep what I didnât reap
For I see justice coming swiftly for,
For every thought and deed.

None had taught.
Such wickedness from the start.
In deed, in thought, my heart was tearing apart.
In vain I fought.
Hoping this pain would depart.
Still no one could tame this wild heart.

Lawless and reckless, my will and my art.
âFlawlessâ I profess, yet wicked in heart.
Lawless and reckless, my will and my art.
âFlawlessâ I profess, yet wicked in heart.

A liar, a thief is what had marked my soul.
Thought lying and stealing would make me feel whole.

Neck deep in the waterâs grave
Without a thought or realization of my dying need,
(I cannot) canât keep back the coming wave
For I see it coming swiftly for,
For which I carry and plead.

None had taught.
Such wickedness from the start.
In deed, in thought,
My heart was tearing apart.
In vain I fought.
Hoping this pain would depart.
Still no one could tame this wild heart.

The oceanâs deep and thick
My lungs are filling quick.
I scream and flail and kick.
For my heart is truly sick.
I feel the end is near.
Choked up by waves of fear.
Distant, You seem unclear.
Until the Savior nears.

Cut through the night.
My curse and my plight.
Blinded by light.
Holy in white.
My heart didnât fight.
My heart didnât fight.
Crushed by the sight.

Shame had taught.
Of all my sin in disgrace.
In love You sought.
To bring me to Your embrace.
My life was bought.
By God in taking my place.
For none could show
Such mercy, love and grace.
Grace!

My heart didnât fight.
My words at a loss.
Crushed by the sight.
The sight of the cross.
