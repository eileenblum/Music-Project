Hebrews 4:15-16, Matt 11:28-30

âFor we do not have a God who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.
Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find helpâ¦â

All who are burdened and seeking respite.
All of the hopeless, wretched and desperate.
All who are worn out and feeling oppressed.
Come in and find your rest.

Weâve seen your scars.
As it has captured like
Like prison bars.
Bitter and sharp it runs down.
Runs down your skin.
It doesnât ease it hides,
Hides wounds within.

We arenât deaf, weâve heard.
Weâve heard your plight.
As dark as night.
In pain youâve cried.
That âhope has died.â

I know that youâre guarded,
Iâve been there before.
Sin is crouched at your door.
Come find your rest.

Iâve traded all of my sin
I once counted worth.
For healed wounds and rebirth.
Come find your rest.

All who are burdened and seeking respite.
All of the hopeless, wretched and desperate.
All who are worn out and feeling oppressed.
Come in and find your rest.

Come in and trade your tears.
(Your tears)
All worry and ease your fears.
(Your fears)
Your burden is not unknown.
(Unknown)
Donât run friend
Youâre not alone.

For all confined come be set free.
For all the blind that long to see.
Come and receive the perfect relief.
Come and believe He bore your grief.

Rise up as the war has ceased.
No bondage you have been released.
Released, released.

All who are burdened and seeking respite.
All of the hopeless, wretched and desperate.
All who are worn out and feeling oppressed.
Come in and find your rest.

Come in and trade your tears.

Donât run friend
Youâre not alone.

Come all you weak and contrite.
Heâll strengthen and clothe you in white.
Come all you weak and contrite.
Heâll strengthen and clothe you in white.
