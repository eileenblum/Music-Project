Isaiah 55:6-7, Psalm 103, 2 Cor. 5:20-21

If the answer is found within yourself
Then who has made the key?
Then tell me who could ever hide such truth
If not for you and me?

Now if you ever found this key inside,
Inside your very soul.
What would there ever to be found at all
Besides a gaping hole?

Return!
Return! Repent!
Return! Restore!
Return all you thirsty.
Come all who hunger.
See that our God is good.

Scream until you faint
At all of the stars and planets and sky.
They havenât a mouth
Havenât a mouth to speak.
Even if the earth could shout out,
Make a reply, it would tell you all to return.
Return, restore and seek.

Open up your eyes.
The light may blind,
But brings relief.
With patience and grace.
Patience and grace.
Bids all to come and

Return!
Return all you thirsty.
Come all who hunger.
Mend what weâve broken.
Return! Repent! Return! Restore!
Come forth! Repent!
Come forth! Behold!

Just like the blind stumbling in the darkness.
Canât find light for they walk in blackness.
Canât find hope living without justice.
Canât find peace while their hearts are restless.

Just like the blind
Canât find light
Canât find hope
Canât find peace while their hearts are restless.

As youâre slipping down to the floor
While youâre reaching and crying out,
Crying out for someone to just hear a sound.
As youâre slipping down to the floor,
While youâre falling youâll hear me shout
âSeek Him while He, Seek Him while He may be found.â

Open up your eyes.
The light may blind,
But brings relief.
With patience and grace.
Patience and grace.
Bids all to come and

Return!
Return all you thirsty.
Come all who hunger.
Come and see that He is
He is full of grace.
Abounding in love.
Slow to anger.
Surely good to all.
