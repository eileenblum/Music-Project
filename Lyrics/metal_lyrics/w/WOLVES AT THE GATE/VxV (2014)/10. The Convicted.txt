Galatians 3:10-14; Romans 5

Fallen, fallen!
Here we stand wrapped up in our crimes.
Itâs all of us who are afflicted.
Itâs all of us convicted.

Allâve fallen!
Allâve fallen!
The verdict call is âGuilty!â
Here we stand all wrapped up in our crimes.

It is all of us who must surrender.
Weâre the culprit and the lone offender
With the gavel striking down upon our crimes.
Upon our crimes.
Upon our crimes.

The guilty running free,
Without a single thought of Your grace.
Erring without a plea,
In our sin, spitting in Your face.

Itâs all of us who are afflicted.
Itâs all of us convicted.

It is all of us who must surrender.
Weâre the culprit and the lone offender,
With the gavel striking down upon our crimes.
Upon our crimes.
Upon our crimes.

Here rise the swelling waves.
Exposed and helpless.
It surely is our graves.
Our hearts in distress
And as the waters caved,
Falling from their slope.
Our lives were truly saved.
And given true hope.

You held back the coming flood
And then You let it fall on Your Son.
This debt was bought with blood
And in Your death our victory won.
Held back the coming flood
And then You let it fall on Your Son.
This debt was bought with blood
And in Your death our victory was won.

You held back the coming flood
(The coming flood)
This debt was bought with blood
(Bought with blood)

It is all of us who must surrender.
Weâre the culprit and the lone offender.
It is all of us who must surrender.
Weâre the culprit and the lone offender.
With the gavel striking down upon our crimes.
Upon our crimes.
Upon our crimes.

Under that tidal wave of wrath
Our guilty souls stand.
It should have fallen on us all,
But by Your command.
Held back the crashing flood of wrath by Your hand.

We are the ones who are afflicted.
We are the ones who stand convicted.
For all of us You were afflicted.
For all of us You stood convicted.
