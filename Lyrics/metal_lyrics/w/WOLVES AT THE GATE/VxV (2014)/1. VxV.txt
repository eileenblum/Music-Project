Five by five, five by five.

âI donât know about you, I long for a place to place my hands, so that all of my guilt would be transferred away and He would drive it far from me. I, I need that! I want that! Do you? Oh, for a place! Oh, for a refuge! Heâs willing to do that. All of your guilt
and all of the wrath of God against you is transferred to Him and then He goes and bears it away.â

âWhen Jesus, the Lamb of God dies, sins are taken away and wrath is removed. He is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world!â
