Hebrews 9:27, 11:23; Eccl 3:11

May my lying down acquaint me with my grave.
From this life it will save.
I know Iâm prone to sin, one day Iâll be whole.
These aching bones donât hold my soul.
Hold my soul. Hold my soul.
These aching bones donât hold my soul.

Someday I will die.
Iâll rest and leave this body.
Not up in the sky,
Will you ever find me.
Someday Iâll be gone.
Iâll rest and leave this vessel.
But not here, Iâm moving on.
In peace will I settle.

Oh, theyâll dig through all of the rock and stone.
With hopes of giving rest to my,
Rest to my skin, my skin and bone.
They may take this absent vessel.
They may take and put it out to sea.
Not the Atlantic or Pacific Iâll be.
I will be. I will be.

May I never lose the heart of the restless.
When my eyes they close in death
And when my body is breathless.
May I never lose the heart of a vagrant.
When Iâm buried in the depths
And when my body is vacant.

Someday I will die.
Iâll rest and leave this body.
Not up in the sky
Will you ever find me.

May my lying down acquaint me with my grave.
From this life it will save.
It is appointed once that all will expire.
To their rest or fire.
As your frailty confronts where you will attend.
Heaven or hellâs the final end.
Final end.
(Heaven or hellâs the final end.)

Someday I will die.
Iâll rest and leave this body.
Not up in the sky
Will you ever find me.
Someday Iâll be gone.
Iâll rest and leave this vessel.
But not here, Iâm moving on.
Iâm pressing toward the gate
And now Iâm not afraid.

May I never lose the heart of the restless.
When my eyes they close in death
And when my body is breathless.
May I never lose the heart of a vagrant.
When Iâm buried in the depths
And when my body is vacant.

May I never lose the heart of the restless.
We were made for eternity.
