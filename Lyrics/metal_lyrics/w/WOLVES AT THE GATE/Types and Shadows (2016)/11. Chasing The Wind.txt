You should send me away, I've been such a liar
With the strongest of words, but weakest desire

But look at me now, I'm reaching much higher
I'm trying so hard, but quickly I tire
(When will it be enough?)

So often I see your beauty surrounding me
(But find my way out)
What's wrong with my heart? This friction of bound and free
(That fills light with doubt)
When will it be enough to know just grace and stop chasing the wind?
(Stop chasing the wind)

I tried to be wise with foolish volition
(Working to earn my place)
Oh how I was bold, but ignored my condition
(Forgetting "all of grace")

I feel the push and the pulls as it all tears me apart
I'm tripping over my pride, what's wrong with my heart?
I feel the push and the pulls as it all tears me apart
I'm tripping over my pride, what's wrong with my heart?

When will it be enough to know just grace and stop chasing the wind?
(Oh how much I've sinned!)

So often I see the darkness that's found in me
(But clinch my eyes shut)
My guilt will agree, I drown in the deepest sea
(The deepest sea)

Yet how could this be? I've been such a liar
Who's got nothing to give and none you require

How could I forget? Your ways are much higher
(I couldn't afford mercy)
Declaring to me your love doesn't tire
(You must be everything)

You've taken my curse and all that I've squandered
(There's nothing that I could bring)
That despite all my flaws and how far I've wandered
(You've given everything!)

You're longing to show your mercy, mercy
My weakness reveals your beauty
You're longing to show your mercy, mercy
My weakness reveals your beauty
