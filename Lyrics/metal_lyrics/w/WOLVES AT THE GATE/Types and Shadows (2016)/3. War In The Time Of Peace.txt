Marching alone where I don't belong
Tapping along in the dark before the dawn
Nothing is wrong, you're here
Abandon the sound of the captain's call
Grabbing my gear as I jump the wall before, before nightfall is here

I've crossed the line of the great divide
I heard your orders
I sneak past land mines
Watch them with each stride
I know the borders

Stumbled upon to the battleground
Search and look for the fight but a white flag's all I found
It's all I've found out here

I know, I know you said you've overcome
But I think it's time I joined the fight

Lay down your arms young one
I realize it's hard to see the war is won my son
You must see the war is won over and done

Caught in the snare of the rival's jaws
Digging in deep as it rears it's vicious claws
I guess my fight is here

What have I done? I'm trapped and all alone
I'm bleeding out and fading quick

Footsteps draw near (Could this be it?)
Is my death now here (Could this be it?)
Who's this that's come for me in this dying and desperate state?

Lay down your arms young one
I realize it's hard to see the war is won my son
You must see the war is won over and done
Over and done!
Done!

Rough hands are placed upon me
I'm far too weak to fight and break myself free

I was chasing apparitions
What's wrong with my volition?

Just as my body floated
I dread and fear what is this stranger's motives?
What have I done?

I opened up my eyes to see the stranger bore a dear old face
And water filled my eyes, it was my captain that I had disgraced
I turned to look away in shame
But in tender words you called my name
"See I bear the marks that fought the war!"

Lay down your arms young one
I realize it's hard to see the war is won my son
You must see the war is won over and done
Over and done!
Yeah!
