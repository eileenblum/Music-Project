Eyes wide in this reverie but it's all still dark as night
I'm falling fast asleep
Black tides of my misery coming down upon my sight
I drown into the deep
Is there but a ghost inside these bones?

Come now my darling! Come now beloved, My love it calls you!

Am I just a ghost inside these bones?
Walking as the dead; hearts made of stone
Nightmares of my darkest fears all around crippled with fright
I'm falling fast asleep

Come now my darling! Come now beloved, My love it calls you!
Come away my darling! Come now beloved, My love remains for you!

I'm lost, so long!
The spirit's willing, but the flesh is weak
I hear your song!
My fears are chilling so I dare not speak
For you my blood was spilled
But I made my bed in hell
In you I see no guilt
But you know how far I fell
Oh may it wake you from your sleep

Am I just a ghost inside these bones?
Walking as the dead; hearts made of stone
Hasten up my feet so I may fly
Wash me now my God or I will die

Black tides of my misery coming down upon my sight

Come now my darling! Come now beloved, my love it calls you!
Come away my darling! Come now beloved, My love remains for you!

I'm lost, so long!
The spirit's willing, but the flesh is weak
I hear your song!
My fears are chilling so I dare not speak
Though you know how far I fell
You've saved my soul from hell
