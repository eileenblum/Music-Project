Oh, I wanted to see a fire ablaze in my heart
A flame not full of smoke

I know your love is a fire
Why am I so cold?
My flesh it screams, "You're a liar!"
Those cries are so old
The smoke ascends, the embers dim
Just follow its trail
Help me I'm weak and so frail

I'm waiting for a reaction and the motions in between
I'm looking for You

Every night I watch and wait as my candle's burning out
Every night I scream and shout as my patience turns to doubt
Stay with me, my flickering flame
Stay with me, I know your name
Quit your fight, it's all in vain
When your flame takes flight, it lasts the pouring rain

I'm waiting, flame smoking, and fading out
I'm fading, withering, will I weather?
I'm waiting, sustain me, help me weather
I'm fading, flame smoking, flickering and fading out

Oh, I wanted to feel the fire before mine goes out
A flame so bright it blinds

I'm waiting for a reaction and the motions in between
I'm looking for you, right now

Stay with me flickering flame, I know you're name
Every night I'll watch and wait as my candle's burning out
Every night I'm filled with doubt I will cry to you and shout
