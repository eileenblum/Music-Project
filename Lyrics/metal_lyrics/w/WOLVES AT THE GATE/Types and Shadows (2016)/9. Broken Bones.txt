Barely alive, but who'd believe it
I'm living clean, but my heart is defiled
Barely alive, but who'd believe it
I bear a heart of stone
Yeah

I look alive but the inside is something worse
Fooling all with the right deeds and nice words
I'm feeding lies and my heart doesn't feel the remorse
Fooling all with the rights deeds and nice words

Buried alive, but who could see it?
My heart is numb but I'm just in denial
Buried alive, but who could see it?
I wear a dead man's bones

Don't be nervous to face the truth that you're not fine, you never were
So don't be frightened to see the Light when you open up your eyes

Washed in the blood or just in the water?
Oh how white you have washed your tomb
Washed in the blood or just in the water?
Hiding death inside its womb

I look alive but the inside is something worse
Fooling all with the right deeds and nice words
Barely alive, but who'd believe it
I wear a dead man's bones

Don't be nervous to face the truth that you're not fine, you never were
So don't be frightened to see the Light when you open up your eyes

Washed in the blood or just in the water?
Oh how clean you have washed your tomb
Washed in the blood or just in the water?
Hiding death inside its womb

Don't be nervous to face the truth that you're not fine, you never were
So don't be frightened to see the Light when you open up your eyes

When you open up your eyes, you'll find that you're lost as hell
When you open up your eyes, don't fear you'll be fine

When your words touched my heart
(You opened up my eyes)
It ripped straight through my bones and tore my pride apart
I spoke not a word (And death inside me dies)
For the claims I had made were revealed to be absurd

When you opened up my eyes I was shaking and trembling
Then you told me to "Arise! Don't fear you'll be fine"

Don't be nervous to face the truth that you're not fine, you never were
So don't be frightened to see the Light when you open up your eyes

Now I'm alive, would you believe it?
My heart is clean though it was so defiled
Now I'm alive, would you believe it?
Inside these broken bones
