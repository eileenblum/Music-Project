Bold sounds rise upwards
Cold words thunder

Oh how I cried aloud
Though no one heard a sound
How I was locked and chained
But none could see me bound

For I spoke of peace
But I dreamt of war

Secrets have a voice
Screaming without breath
My heart speaks of its choice
Calling for my death

Mountains take flight, rain down from above
Shadows and night aren't dark enough
Rocks and hills, cover me!
Rocks and hills, hide me from your face!
Rocks and hills, hide me!

I claimed to be rich
Truly, I was poor

Secrets have a voice
Screaming without breath
My heart speaks of its choice
Calling for my death

Choosing my own path
Shrouded treachery
Ignore the aftermath, living carelessly
Tempting you to wrath with infidelity

So where's the fire? Where's the flood?
These guilty hands are covered in blood
Shouldn't I die, shouldn't I die, when your laws I deny?

Earth heeds not my cries
Mercy come or I die

You speak with your own voice
"Come be not afraid
Weep no more rejoice
Punishment is paid?"

I feared the one who bears all sin
Will you take me in father?
Cover me with your blood!
Cover me with your blood!
Cover me!
