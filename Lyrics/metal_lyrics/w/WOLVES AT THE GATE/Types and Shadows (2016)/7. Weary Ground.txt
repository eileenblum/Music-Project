Keeping watch while the whole world sleeps (Listen close)
Feel the earth toss and turn and weep (Hear its voice)
A wearied ground opens up to roar (Hear it roar)
"How much longer will this pain endure?"

We're waiting for a better day
The shadows gone, all things pass away
Listen close and hear it say
"We're cursed and we're dying"

Hills shake and mountains quake (Mountains shaking)
Earth's fires have come awake
No words, but hear it speak (Hear it speaking)
As the deep calls to the deep

Beauty, beauty mixed with dread
Hanging by a thread

We're waiting for a better day
The shadows gone, all things pass away
Listen close and hear it say
"We're cursed and we're dying"

Skies wake, the heavens ache (Heavens aching)
Thunder and lightning break
O glory come, come like a thief (Like a thief)
Bring us relief from grief

Still on and on, we're waiting for the hour
On an on, our cries are growing louder

How long must darkness reign in a world so violent (So violent)
While we toss and turn in pain, in vain, and it's still so silent

Waiting, wait for what's ahead
These tattered rags will be shed

We're waiting for a better day
The shadows gone, all things pass away
Listen and hear it say
"We're cursed and we're dying"

Hills shake and mountains quaking
The earth's fires have now awaken
No words, but hear it speak
"We're cursed and we're dying"

"We're cursed and we're dying"
(We're cursed and we're dying)
