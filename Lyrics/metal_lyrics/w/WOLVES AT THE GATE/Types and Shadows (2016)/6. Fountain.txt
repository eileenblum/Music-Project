There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains

Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day
And there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins away
With all my guilty stains

Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away

Ever since by faith I saw the stream Your flowing wounds supplied
Redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die
