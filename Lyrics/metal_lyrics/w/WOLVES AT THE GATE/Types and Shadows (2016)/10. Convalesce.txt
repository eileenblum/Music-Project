I know who you are, you wanted to be perfect
In all that you were, but you bailed, you bailed
I know who you are, you wanted to be worth it
In all that you were, but you failed, you failed

Kill all the lights, you fear what's inside
Cover your eyes, I'm trying to run and to hide in shadows
Filling the void with just a veneer
Watching your steps and hoping that I don't come near
Don't follow

I know you thought, you thought you'd never need it
But you cannot hide behind all your claims, your claims
Guilt is now the anchor pulling, dragging your head under

Drowning deeper down below
Fear is just a false claim, vanity has locked the irons
Sinking faster, heart is hollow

Show me your sorrow my love
This burden is the milestone 'round your neck
Convalesce and I will bear, bear your shame

The voice of hell screams and roars
Of what has been done
Tens of thousands and countless more
Yet I'll remember not one
You know who I am, I wanted to be perfect
In all that I am, but I failed, I failed

Would you walk in darkness just to find a broken rebel?
Crippled legs won't find their way
Could you look upon my blackened soul
I've wrecked and ruined
How could see me without clean hands or a pure heart?

Show me your sorrow my love
This burden is the milestone 'round your neck
Convalesce and I will bear, bear your shame, every stain
Bear your shame, every stain
