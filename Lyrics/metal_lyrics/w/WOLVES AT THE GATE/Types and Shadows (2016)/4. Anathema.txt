I'm lying barren in my own blood
It's drowning me like a rushing flood
A wave of crimson eclipse my eyes
No sign of pity here

My lips are silenced with blistering
The utter silence is deafening

Vultures fly above
They're calling out my name
The vipers watch below
Taunting my crippled frame
Desolate is love
Surely a curse and my name
The same, a plague is all I know

The lover I had claimed has sent me out here to die
Ashes for beauty and shame my ally
The lover I had claimed has left me here to die
The wings of death black out the sky

Isolated in deserted lands
Isolated in deserted lands
Suffocating under dirt and sand
Cursed, despised, I am anathema!
Cursed, despised, I am anathema!

Glory speak to me
Call upon my name
Tell my soul to live, to live

Grant to me the life only your hands can give
I take a breath as I try to shout
I go to scream but no words come out
No shred of solace I'm left to die
No sign of pity here

My lips are silenced with blistering
The utter silence is deafening

The lover that I had claimed has sent me out here to die
Ashes for beauty and shame my only ally
The lover that I had claimed has left me out here to die
Ashes for beauty and shame my only ally

Vultures fly above
They're calling out my name
The vipers watch below
Taunting my crippled frame
Desolate is love
Surely a curse and my name
The same â a plague is all I know

Oh rising sun, won't you dawn on me
Descend just like a dove
Oh rising sun hear this sullen plea
Hide me, hide me in your love

Glory speak to me
Call upon my name
Tell my soul to live, to live

Grant to me the life
Isolated in deserted lands
Isolated in deserted lands
Suffocating under dirt and sand
Cursed was I and surely left to die
But glory became my anathema
