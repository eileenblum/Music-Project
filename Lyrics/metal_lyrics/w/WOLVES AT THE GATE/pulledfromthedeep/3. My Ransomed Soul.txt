Buried in the heart of the earth
(Blood was shed for)
There for three days bearing my shame
(A world of men)
This man of sorrows despised for His love
The blood at Calvary ransomed now oh my soul

I deserve the cross I deserve a death for I am fallen
Blood was shed for (this world of men)

Something was deeply wrong if God had to die
Your body broken Your blood was spilled
Even after all we've done You still justify
And Your words were spoken a life fulfilled
Even after all we've done You still justify

I deserve the cross I deserve a death for I am fallen
A Savior for the lost cause I can't pay the debt of all of my sin

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

A God who will save us
A God who will love us even after all I've done
To deserve a death of
That of a traitor who speaks with the most treasonous lips
