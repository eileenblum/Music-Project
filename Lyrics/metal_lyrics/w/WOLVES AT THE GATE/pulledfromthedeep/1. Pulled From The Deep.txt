Oceans come to pass on the wreckage of all my drowning vessels
Still these waters swallow and torment all the men that face their swells
In this sea of treachery my heart holds fast to this vessel
As the waves pass over me I feel this ship tremble
Breaking and burning and shifting and turning

I feel this ship fail beneath my feet
Somebody save me!

So empty me of this burden in my chest
It weighs me down in these darkened waters
For I am Yours! And I know my Redeemer lives!
For I know my Redeemer lives!

I have no fear of the dark for I have the Light inside of me
I have been pulled from the depths of the sea
If grace were like trickling waters
We'd be in trouble because we need it like a rushing flood
But abundant this love still redeems
Christ became my sin on the cross

Stretching out my hands You reach for my heart 3x
Stretching out Your hands I reach for You my God

"God became a man to redeem a sinful humanity, and in becoming a man He lived a perfect. Then after He went to the cross, on that cross He bore your sin and as bearing your sin the Father in heaven crushed His only begotten Son."
[- Paul Washer]

Pulled from the deep, a saving grace for wretched hearts
Woke from our sleep, our cries were heard no longer apart
Stretching out my hands You reach for my heart
Stretching out Your hands I reach for You my God
Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

In this sea of treachery from the depths my heart sings

Hallelujah! What a Savior!
