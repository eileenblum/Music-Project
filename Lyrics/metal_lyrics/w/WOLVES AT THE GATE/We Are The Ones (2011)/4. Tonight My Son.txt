Tonight my son, be still and sleep while storms are crashing
On this deep we drop the anchor with the hope
This vessel holds us still
Oh Great Captain, You navigate the storm
My son be still and sleep while storms are crashing
Oh Great Captain, You navigate the storm

An angry water surges the waves have taken its toll
While this ship submerges on my tempest soul
And though we've weathered the storm
You know the next one could be much stronger
And I can see the shoreline
Is a mirage or a sign?
I can feel the anchor fast as I meet each sudden blast
And the cable though unseen bears the heavy strain between
Each storm I safely ride until the turning of the tide
As I meet each sudden blast

We drop the anchor with the hope we won't set sail into the storm
We set the sails and tie the rope tonight my son, be still and sleep

My anchor holds until this tempest calms and dies
For this squall's the throne to which He rides
Still this faith will last the waves demise
All these purging skies will never see my end

We drop the anchor with the hope we won't set sail into the storm
We set the sails and tie the rope tonight my son, be still and sleep

As the waves crash over and over
You are my anchor
Every gale I meet
The plight of all the seas can't separate me
For all I have is Yours

[Psalm 23:2, 91:11, 138:7; Isaiah 43:1; Ephesians 4:14; Hebrews 6:18-19]
