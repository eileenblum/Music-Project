Death awaits us all as we walk this path
Though different endings, in His light or in His wrath
We never know what awaits
For every loved one lost I see the pain in every heart
And still we all must pay the cost our sin has kept us apart

So you've got the world
Gripping your life in your hands
Taking for granted the breath in your lungs
But death has a voice
Singing to us "Make your stand!"
Death is ever certain we all share this fate
I watched you go away Know it was coming
Vanished and we didn't know it We didn't know it
I sat and watched and prayed   we didn't know it We didn't know it
God has called your name   We didn't know it

In death we see that we are just as vapors
And life has become what we all do savor
When all is lost and taken away
Endless nights to weep and pray
We're letting it all out still it feels so quiet

For every loved one lost I see the pain in every heart
And still we all must pay the cost our sin has kept us apart
Still in these bodies feeling fragile with the same fate
Never knowing if our time fills or death awaits
While our hearts are pounding inside we'll fight and not break
To my King I will confide my everything

In death we see that we are just as vapors
And life has become what we all do savor
When all is lost and taken away
Endless nights to weep and pray
We're letting it all out still it feels so quiet

Still I'll walk Your path for You write my story
And I'll count the days till I see Your glory
You will clothe us in spotless white
I'll sing to Your glories, what a beautiful sight
A host of saints and all the angels
With no constraints and nothing painful
We'll sing these songs and You will listen
In the Book of Life our names are written
