I consider my life worth nothing to me if only I may finish the race
and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me. The task of testifying
to the Gospel of God's grace. Now I know that none of you whom I have gone
about preaching the Kingdom will ever see me again. Therefore I declare
to you that I am innocent of the blood of all men for I have not hesistated
to proclaim the whole will of God. Keep watch over yourselves and all the
flock to which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of
the church, of God, which He bought with His own blood. I know that when
I leave savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to
draw away disciples after them. So be on your guard. We are not the wolves
at the gate, we are the ones who face them.

[Acts 20:26-32; Luke 10:3; Matthew 7:5, 10:6]
