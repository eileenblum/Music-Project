You'll just lay softly
I think you cannot age at all
In the cloth of some pearly wool
How did you grow so hard of stone

And I hear every memory that beats like a drum
A sundown so plain and new

And you sleep like a moon
And take the end from the ruin

All things are love
And all love is pain
And our pain is all that is true

You'll just lay softly
I think you cannot age at all
In the cloth of some pearly wool
How did you grow so hard of stone

And I hear every memory that beats like a drum
A sundown so plain and new
To float like a feather but shoot like a gun
And it's too fast, it's too much, too soon

And you sleep like a moon
Take the end from the ruin

All things are love
And all love is pain
And our pain is all that is true
Our pain is all that is true
