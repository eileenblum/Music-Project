My hands are clean
Washed of your precious heart
You come to me
You come to me

Devotion
To hunger
To leave you
Owing no one

My hands are tied
Your precious heart is
Feeling so alive
You come to me

Devotion
To hunger
To leave you
Owing no one
And it's all
For nothing
Your sun is
Setting somewhere

My hands are clean
Washed of your precious heart
You come to me
You come to me

Devotion
To hunger
To leave you
Owing no one
And this all
The sun is
Setting somewhere
