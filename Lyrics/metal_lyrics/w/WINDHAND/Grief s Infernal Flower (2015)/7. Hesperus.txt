Grower of grief's infernal flower
I am the love that always devours 
I am the rain, I am the tower
I am the builder, the furnace of power

He has a steady hand
He liveth faithlessly
He is a paceless/faceless man
He fills/feels eternity

Drink from the devilish fountain
Fade in my memory
Call of the revelation
Call of the reverie

He has a steady hand
He liveth faithlessly
He is a paceless/faceless man
He fills/feels eternity

I am the rain, I am the tower
I am the builder, the furnace of power
Grower of grief's infernal flower
I am the love, that always devours 

Drink from the devilish fountain
Fade in my memory
Call of the revelation
Call of the reverie

[4x]
I can't know 
Yes I can
