Goodnight my child, goodnight
Sweet dreams before the light
Goodnight my child, the darkness has come
Goodnight my child, goodnight

Dream of my emerald eyes
Dream of my emerald eyes
The summer has gone and so soon shall be I
Dream of my emerald eyes

The snake will have its day
The sun will burn away
On a sea of tears your cradle will sway
Above my cursed grave

No matter big or small
What rises surely will fall
When you have learned you are nothing at all
From the dark you'll crawl

Goodnight my child, goodnight
Make sure your sleep is light
Be warm of heart and fierce of fight
And keep the fire alive
Keep the fire alive
