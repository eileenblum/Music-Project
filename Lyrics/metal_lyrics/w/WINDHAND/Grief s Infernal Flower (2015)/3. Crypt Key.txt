Send me who is lonely as I am
I've seen nothin' so cruel as God's plan

Softly I been bathin' in sunlight
Memories of the days when I was warm

My sweet angel stony face above
Sleepin' deeply safe from everyone

Send me who is lonely as I am
I've seen nothin' so cruel as God's plan

Softly I been bathin' in sunlight
Memories of the days when I was warm

My sweet angel stony face above
Sleepin' deeply safe from everyone

My sweet angel stony face above
Sleepin' deeply safe from everyone

Send me who is lonely as I am
I've seen nothin' so cruel as God's plan

Softly I been bathin' in sunlight
Memories of the days when I was warm

My sweet angel stony face above
Sleepin' deeply safe from everyone

My sweet angel stony face above
Sleepin' deeply safe from everyone
Safe from everyone
Safe from everyone
