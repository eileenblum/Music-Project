I know that palace is a tomb
We're goin' to another moon
Go on and do something good for me now

I know that palace is a tomb
We're goin' to another moon
Go on and do something good for me now
Go on and do something good for me now

Burning up the sun
Burning up the sun
Burning up the sun
Burning up the sun

I know that palace is a tomb
We're goin' to another moon
Go on and do something good for me now
Go on and do something good for me now
