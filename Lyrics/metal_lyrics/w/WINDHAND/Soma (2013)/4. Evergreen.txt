You won't suffer long but you will see
How cruel her love can be
Leaves behind the bones
Skin and sky alone
Don't grow old
stay evergreen
sleep where the summer sleeps
dance in the dawn, my own sister
wearing their sorrow down
oh how I knew that you'd miss her
soon as she stopped twirling round
you won't suffer long but you will see
how cruel her love can be
don't I know your face
somewhere out in space
don't grow old
stay evergreen
sleep where the summer sleeps
stay evergreen
