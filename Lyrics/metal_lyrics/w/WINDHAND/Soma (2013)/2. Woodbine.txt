Ride the ocean waves
The rising surge
The rush of waning surprise
It's time to call the gods
Sink in the waves
And all you laid in the arms
So go, go on and love
Go on and love
Go on and love what you are
Come on say things about me
All your love's like a fire burning on and
All white/wide like an oasis
All your loves like a fire burning on and on
