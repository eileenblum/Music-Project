So tonight's The Night
This is the final day
Are you ready to cross the line?

Don't be afraid
we've been waiting for you...
just step over... talkin'bout you!

Everyday life is the worst of it all
I won't go on like I did before
the madness is spreading but we won't be a part
of self destructive.... 2000!

[Chorus:]
Are you ready for the radium round?
Passed years' model is the satan sound
'99 party is merry-go-round
it's so good!
So are you ready for the radium round?
Let's have one more to the satan sound
'99 party kicks all around
it's so good!

Talkin'bout you!

Soon we're not here, we are moving ahead
don't resist coz it won't help
I won't sleep with my ears and arms alarmed
love, peace and happiness in 2000!

[Chorus]

Talking about you!
Now it's a final round!
mayday mayday!

[Chorus]

So, are you ready for the radium round?
Passed years model is the satan sound
'99 party is a merry-go-round
it's so good!
So are you ready for the radium round?
Remember the old time of the satan sound
'99 party kicks all around
it feels good!

Talking about you!
2000!
