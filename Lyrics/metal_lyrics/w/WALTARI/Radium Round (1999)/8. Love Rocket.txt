Coz you life is getting thin
coz you don't know why you are in
it all begins to fall and a desert mind is coming in

I came to heal you mind
and we are two of a kind
then we'll begin to shine and we'll observe not only hell

[Bridge:]
Love is all around
listen to the sound
Everywhere it begins to be heard
It's my final word for you, it's true

[Chorus:]
I am a love rocket flying away, away from this pain
I am a love rocket flying away, flying to play
flying my way

Every pleasure is not right
and small hunger keeps you tight
Your mind begins to feel clear, and it feels like
you're near, forever close

[Bridge 2:]
Every single day
makes me wanto to say
that when I will begin to shine then I'll live my life for
only you, it's true

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1 + chorus]

Distance won't keep us apart
and we are in each other's hearts
and if you know what you want, you'll be fullskilled for everything
