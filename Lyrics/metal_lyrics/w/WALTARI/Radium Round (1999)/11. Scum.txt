(Whatta bam-bam, ...my body's ready to take you,
through our flooding snot, go!
Am I beaten?, you better funk me up!)

Think of a spot walkin' itself to the widest white it finds
oh shit - grappin' with its claws my burning flash,
oh mama come!
Looks like I'm doomed for real suffering
amma victim of a passion play
(fuck) I'm only able to crawl for the next few days
I'll be battered, beat through out like a slave

[Chorus:]
Not me, not me
This scum si damn rotten - and never for me
Not me, not me
This scum, no, it can't beat me

And no, I won't surrender, I'll beat it with tons of
pure whiskey inside my body, I will keep it starving,
I won't eat any healthy stuff
oh, my dear booze, it's like magic, seems like
a spot won't last
I don't need it's part, I'll make it rot
its million legs will run and fast

[Chorus (Scum! Run!)]

Yo man, the spot is gone, wonder how my good
remedy worked
I'm supposed to feel well, I should, but I can't tell
what if it's still there, whati if it's still inside,
somewhere hiding, getting bigger, silently, violently
oh gosh... cancer is here, cancer is everywhere!

[Chorus]

I am dying of this scum!
This is fucking boring!
