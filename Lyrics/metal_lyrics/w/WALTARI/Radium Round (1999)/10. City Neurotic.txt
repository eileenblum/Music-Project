Rolling on a rell, coiling on a wheel
time to turn the machine on, feel the heat, the mind blows on
mayday makes my day, dancing in the rain
rain that melts
my dirty skin, spreads around the medicin
all the common lies make me realize
I'm a man of the megatown, a look that kill with a megafrown
you're "radical" and nice, touch me if I please
Peeping on the noisy drift, I'm back from my dialy shift

[Bridge:]
I'm on my way, I'm making it fast
you might be first, but never the last
this city's calling all night long

[Chorus:]
Panic in the street, drifting in the heat
alone withou you, thinking about you
city neurotic, measuring the beat
is it tonight you, the concrete victim of the day?

Struggling like a man, doing all I can
to fight against the neurosis, creating gradual dismiss
filthy like a dog, digging in a rock
nails in blood I want to reach some time in malibu beach
this fascinating world still acts so absurd
start to cover for tonight all the parts that I can hide

[Bridge + chorus]

Rolling on a reel, coiling on a wheel
time to turn the machine on, feel tha heat te mind blows on
mayday makes my day, dancing in the rain
rain that melts my dirty skin, spreads around the medicin
all the dirty lies make me realize
I'm a man of the megatown, a look that kills with megafrown
you're radical and nice, touch me if I please
peeping on the noisy drift, I'm back from my daily shift

[Bridge]

I'm on my way, my heart's beating fast
days without nights, nerves could never last
this city's calling all night long

[Chorus:]
Panic in the street, drifting in the heat
alone without you, thinking about you
city neurotic, measuring the beat
is it tonight you... is it tonight you...?
panic in the street, drifting in the heat
alone without you, singing about you
you city neurotic, taste my bitter sweet
I am tonight you, your concrete victim of the day!
