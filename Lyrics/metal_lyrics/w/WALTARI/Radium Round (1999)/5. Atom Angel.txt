He's pointing out his hand
towards a brightness in the sky
reflected by the light
rising high above the night
standing on the deck
the figure's dimly to be seen
scared and weak and proud
his restless feet are tapping

[Chorus:]
Hello you flaming land
here comes an angel with a sword
you real flaming land
a salvation? - you can think so

The boat slips silently
into the arms of the desert wall
drying of its strength
a salvation of soul?

[Chorus:]
Hello you flaming land
here comes an angel with a sword
you real flaming man
atom angel with a smile
hello you flaming land
hello you flaming land
(you can think so)

[Chorus]

I know what you saw!
