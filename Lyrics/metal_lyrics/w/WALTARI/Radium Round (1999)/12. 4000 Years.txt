So are you ready to follow me here further down the road
where there's no light in sight, just blind man painting this grey zone
touch my deepest part inside and feel the cold wind blow
I cannot see around, just glassy eyes look where to go

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes (I'll give you everything you need)
for thousand years (sail with your sweetness to the stream)
is it so?

My manic incognito drives you mad when I'm not here
are you feeling lonely, dontcha know why I'm not near?
Your desolation mind keeps telling where about to start
just sacrifice your teenage will for those who want your part

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes (I'll give you everything you need)
for thousand years (sail with your sweetness to the stream)
close your eyes (Stuck with these rhymes that you've been told)
...and you're old!

Hey man, where are you going, are you leaving this space behind?
with a speed of light I'll take the next round - which is mine

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes (I'll give you everything you need)
for thousand years (Bring us somewhere where we'll be free)
wish me well (I think I'm dead when you have come)
for thousand years (soon they will saturate your soul)
...and then you're old!
