Where can it be?
my destiny
I set it free now
I wanna be!

Hey I wanna get back,
back to the bottom!

Now, they will judge us from each and every angle
wish you would breakdown, skip you life and tangle
confusin' enuff, they wanto what you got
they'll drop ya on the ruff, lick a shot!

[Chorus]

Hey, I wanna get back,
back to the bottom!

Taught - we all ready - paid our frickin' frickin' dues
should have known - it's never steady when they make the rules
they categorize you - fit you inna mould
but we come free no matter what they told

[Chorus]

(I wanna make a masterplan)

Hey, I wanna get back,
back to the bottom!
