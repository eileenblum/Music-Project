When I come home tired, late feel like I'm gone
you're already waiting hand on the gun
you force me to move my dead ass towards
the vacuumcleaner - pass
I fall down to the floor trying to keep my eyes open
Oh well, is this a reason for popping?
Oh, what a life of luxury to live in this nice insanity

You're wasting you time like you knew
that you won't never ever catch it, it's too fast for you
inside you mind you're closing you're eyes
your eyes are frozen like a frozen smile

You're beating and cheating on yourself
you're trying to be somebody else
you would like to set me free but after all it comes back to me
don't wanna stay close to your mind
your mind is weak, don't tell me no lies
I pray for justice, sensibility with some kind of ability

[Bridge:]
You know I'm turning into a clone
but I know well what I'm inside my bone
you will force my nature to let go
(coz) everything's better than feeling low

[Chorus:]
You need me and I need you
but what's all this we're going through
my sixth sense won't tell what to do
deaf dumb blind when I feel you
You need me and I need you
but what's all we're going through
There's a desert in my heart
feels like broken, bizarre

So disconnect you telephone
tear the chord out off the wall
if she's calling don't reply
your mind's an empty hall
it's necessary, it's obvious to step aside of the ball
but if you only let her fool you
soon she'll cause you a fall

[Bridge+chorus]
