I was inna downtown where lights move so fast
seeing salesman, pimps, who could never last
I'm slowly heading for the subway train
Begging for some small peace for my pain
seeing people staring but no-one really wathces
Just paying attention, no real touches
someone pushed me cause of his hurry
gave me bad looks coz I wore no tie

Wish I could see more clearly what's inna head
I could read yout thoughts about love and despair
I could find out the mind of the president
about the goverment and all that shit

But now I'm only drifting, will I ever reach
anything or anybody who could really teach
how to gather togetha and feel the revolution
togetherness against thisja isolation

Nobody can see inside my world
I feel lonely
so, please, listen and open my heart
for the power of thoughts

If falling trees of India invite you to meet yourself
in guatuama
don't expect to meet god who rescues without
a feeling of pain
no pain no gain, just remember u need a bloody cure,
makes you feel better
drink you own blood, eat your own shit
then you'll realize what's in your kit

Nobody can see inside my mind
I am the only one
so step inside my heart to fill my dream
of power of thoughts

(I was inna babaaa.....babagawana)
sometime I feel that I'm ragged, and make a muff of myself
I'm just losing my time, wandering around in my mind
see a bom bom bang with my love affairs
hey, where's my passsport? Fuck it up!

Nobody can see inside my world
I feel lonely
so, please, listen and open my heart
for the power of thoughts
Nobody casn see inside my mind
I am the only one
so step inside my heart to fill my dream
of power of thoughts
