I'm lying on a mountain be the river
In the distance see the city, I'd love to be a bird
Started dreaming 'bout a day I would be there
I'm walking thru the people with power and name

I know you wait for me
I know you still should see
That I'll never do anything that's out of the blue

You think I'm a liar and I'll never change
But my family, you must understand as far as I'm concerned
I'd like to make you feel
That I am really real
Don't wanna do anything that's a copy of you

[CHORUS:]
(Good God) No, I did never feel like
(Good God) No, I did never feel like
(Good God) No, I did never feel like I would be a clone
(Good God) No, I did never feel like
(Good God) No, I did never feel like
(Good God) No, I did never feel like I would steal your show
(you know I never feel like)

You know I feel like this! Doncha be yourself with us!
Let's go!

Baby you are wondering why I walk alone -
'coz nothing in this whole wide world would make me copy you!
I wanna be myself
And nobody else
No, I'll never do anything that's outta you

[CHORUS]
