Everybody's hoping that I won't do no wrong
"Be clean, be a dad, be brave and have a high-tech job!"
But when I switch on my stereo and get my feelings out of dirty sounds
I gotta keep moving
I gotta keep moving
I gotta keep moving on

[CHORUS:]
I got a bad-bad ride
I got a bad-bad ride
I got a bad-bad ride

I think that you are old, when you just tell me what you are told
"Be clean, be a dad, be brave and have a high-tech job!"
While those dirty freak rule the world, talking 'bout
war pigs and other lunatics
I gotta keep moving
I gotta keep moving
I gotta keep moving on

[CHORUS]

I gotta keep moving
I gotta keep moving
I gotta keep moving on! Well...
