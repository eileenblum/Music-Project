Again on the stage where everybody's ready
To rap this beat or do you wanna call it heavy
We wanna wecome you to this unfinished show
We wanna welcome you to this unfinished show
And we're gonna get through 'coz we're allowed like you
Everything's simple but not so clear
I've heard that you live in a bad atmosphere
So forget the bad deals and let yourself go
There's nothing in this world that'll keep us low

HELLO!

Don't live your life with a TV-set
It will kill you, thinking there's something you can get
Don't make your ife sounds ike a bad joke
And let the leaders give you too much dope
Things will be better all the time
It depends on how you will waste your time
Don't panic your mind like a regular Joe
Forget the bad deals and let yoursef go

HELLO!
