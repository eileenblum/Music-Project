My body kicked me out and I started out a hippie
I dreamed about the time of the endless trippie
But then one day I woke up in my head
I was very disappointed instead

I had it But then - I lost it!

So many years have passed me by
I didn't catch any piece of mental sky
An' there was only on chance to try
To find tota piece of mind

Gotta find it But now - I've lost it!

I was fucking on this same line
T'was no way to find cloud nine

"Hevosenkuva!"

What was that? My ears started to whine
When I heard that rhyme between my head and I
Somebody tod me it was Finnish language
What is this place, full of mental baggage?

Should I go there?
Maybe I'll find something?

Then I fucked off with my old line
I scared my voice deep inside
And my body gave a message to me:

"Hevosenkuva!" ...

So I took a real trip to southern Finand
Walked (along) those dead Helsinki streets
I praised: "Hallelujah, this is everything!"
A real fullfilment of my dreams

Finally I found a real place to live
Finalla I found a real place to love
These happy fellows - a real "horsepicture" for me

This is where I belong
This is a symphony of a healthy mind
There's no other place like this!

My body "goes away"
Yeah, when I hear them say...
My body "goes away"
Yeah, when I hear them say: Hevosenkuva!
