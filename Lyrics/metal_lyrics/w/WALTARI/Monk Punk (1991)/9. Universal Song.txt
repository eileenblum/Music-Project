I can't reveal my real world to you
I can't show how I need you
Things in my mind make a mess of me
I am weak and I know it well

[CHORUS:]
But I'm safe behind this universal song
In my mind I know how to have some fun
I am pale in front of this universal song
I'd like to sing, I don't need no gambling games

Show me the way how to make it right
Show me the way how to save my soul
I don't need the daily routine
Wish you knew what I really mean

[CHORUS I need universal song]

There's still many youngsters who would relly like to see the real world
