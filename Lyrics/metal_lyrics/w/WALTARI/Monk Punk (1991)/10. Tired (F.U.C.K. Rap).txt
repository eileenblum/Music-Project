[CHORUS:]
I'm tired of all these people, tired of all their lies
Used to be friendly, I don't discriminate

[Rap:]

I think I'll start to live as clown
'Coz I'm bored by people wearing a frown
I wanna take off to somewhere else
To see some people out of thei shells
In New York City, New York town
Everybody's shaking all over the ground
And here my body wants to kick that mean old lady ...

I'm tired of all these people (YEAH YEAH YEAH)
I'm tired of all these people (YEAH YEAH YEAH)
I'm tired of all these people, tired of all their lies
Used to be friendly... Why?
