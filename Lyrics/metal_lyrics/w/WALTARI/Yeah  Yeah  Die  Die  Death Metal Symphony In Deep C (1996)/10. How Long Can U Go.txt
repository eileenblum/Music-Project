I'm making my money and I'm making my money allnight
And when I cheat you badly it only makes me feel I'm right
And if I don't trust you it's just the same
I can always let you down and you'll forget my name
(Yeah!) I'm ready, are you ready? I'm always ready...
Ready for the rock'n roll

I show my penis on stage if I'll just get wellpaid
(ya know) it always sells though it's of the lowest grade
Yes, I feel so nice and I feel so fine
And behind the stage I see my manager's smile
'Coz I'm ready, I'm ready, always ready, ready for rock'n roll

I dance like hell 'coz I know my boss is there
I smile at him and people think I have something to share
But if he can't trust me it's only peanuts for him
He can always let me down and I can start as a pimp
And I'm ready, still ready, always ready, ready for rock'n roll
