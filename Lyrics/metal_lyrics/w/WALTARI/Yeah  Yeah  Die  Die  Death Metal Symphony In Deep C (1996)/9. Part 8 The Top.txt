"All's well that ends well": everybody simply decides to vanish into thin air
and disappear into the pages of internet!

[Band: ]
Let's go to the top! To the top! Top!
Let's go to the top! To the top! Top! Top!
[John Doe: ]
I wanna make you see, make you see, make you see, 
make you see, make you see, what you never ever saw
I wanna make you roar, make you roar, make you roar,
make you roar, make you roar, like you never did before
Everywhere you go, where you go, where you go,
where you go, where you go, there's a piece of paradise
Revolution mind, human mind, here I am; so hypnotize
[The Angel: ]
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
[John Doe: ]
I wanna make you see, make you see, make you see, 
make you see, make you see, like you never did before
You're living in a dream, in a dream, in a dream,
in a dream, in a dream, and you did forget the truth
[Machine: ]
Defecating ecstasy
Measuring your pulse
Intellectual hypocrites
Guarded by the Laws
[The Angel: ]
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
[Machine + Band: ]
To the top! To the top! Top! To the top! To the top! Top! 
To the top! Top!
[The Angel: ]
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
Life is waiting, waiting for you!
[Everybody: ]

(We) Go to eternity! (Yeah!)
Go to eternity!
Go to eternity!
(Let's ) Go to eternity!
(We) Go to eternity!
