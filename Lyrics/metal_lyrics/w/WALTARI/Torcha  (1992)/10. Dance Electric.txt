I wanna go jo-jo underground
I wanna live for sight and sound
I wanna move towards the flow

Dont let me walk down
Please, dont let me dry out
Dont let me walk down

I wanna spell your success:
better to wind up yourself
to a vague ball of experience

Dont let me walk down
Dont let me go down
Hey baby let me fly high

[Chorus]

I wanna dance
I wanna dance electric

Better toreally step outside
Better to look for bright colours
I wanna hear the metal sound!

Youre not a dead body
Like us, everybody
Hey baby, gimme your noise!

[Chorus]
