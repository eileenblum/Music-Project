You know all about flying, but dont tell me all your wisdom
coz just own imagination can throw us out of deadly routine
Livin in the naugty city (without no heart), blind
and mind full of emptiness
The long winter seems to fill your heart with
distrust and loneliness and cold

I wanna know wheres the deepest sea Tell me who you are, The Waltari!

Run with your flame into a big horizon
Fly with your thoughts above despair
Slow down with your hips in fast emotion
why cant we love fast in our heads
