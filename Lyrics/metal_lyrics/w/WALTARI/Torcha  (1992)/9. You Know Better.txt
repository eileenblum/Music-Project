I love the sound of dignity
I love to stand on my own two feet
I keep on watching the big sunset
Youd like to talk to me, but I wont let you, I bet

I know I love you - I know I hate you
I know I love you - I know I hate you (now)

I prefer to get cold in a hard rain
than to give anybody a chance to share my pain
I wanna feel the limits in my head
I wanna keep on sitting in the electric chair

I know I love you - I know I hate you
Thats why I put my faith in you
You know better what you are!
I know I love you - I know I hate you...

I love the sound of dignity
I love to stand on my own two feet
Sometimes Id like to change my way to go
to give my my confession and feel my flow

I know I love you
I know I hate you
Thats why I leave it up to you
coz you know better what you are!
