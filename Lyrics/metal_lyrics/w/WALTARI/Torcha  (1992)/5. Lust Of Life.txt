[Chorus:]
Go, everybody, go, to the lust of life!

Sitting here on this side of the fence,
though grass is greener on the other side
I thought id better here, but still it locks me down
Im the worst intervention in the whole history
Birds are shooting complicate series into my consciousness
At once Im back in time when there was no order of geometric stress

[Chorus]

Tired but happy I organize the world, trying to hear it louder
Lets go deeper into the world to live more for sight and sound
Many kinda robots are waiting for us to calculate our pride
Take me away, somewhere, anywhere, Ill be in and I will survive
Civilization?!

[Chorus]

Lifes so cruel, lifes such a bitch, (but) still its inviting us to play
Theres many dangers against the humans
but we have decided me to step inside
But I smashed the mirror down (like Tommy did)...
....banging the doors behind
Civilization?!
