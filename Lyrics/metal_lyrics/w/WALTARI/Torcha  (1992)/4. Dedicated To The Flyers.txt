Go, go, go, move on!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, have fun!

Lets go, go, go, go, go, and have some fun!
All right? It's time to fight, so trust yourself!
Lets fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck for our fun!
We play rock'n'roll, better look at yourself!

[Chorus:]

Dedicated to the flyers
Who dont give a fuck 'bout climbers
They just wanna live thru feelings
and thats sure a real good way to start
towards the paradise!

Go, go, go, run on! Fuck, fuck, fuck, move on!

Kiss my ass, kiss my song
Lets go (fuck!) all nite long!
Its only rock'n'roll, you better find it in yourself!
Theres no sense I this, no good advice
No real help for your stress

[Chorus]

Go, go, go, run on...
