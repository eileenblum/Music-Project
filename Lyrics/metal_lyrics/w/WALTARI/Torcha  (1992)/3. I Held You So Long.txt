A time of no passion lives somewhere in me
Its a pity to realize that theres no more love
I held you in my arms, I held you so tight
But one day the flame went out and I was alone

Oh, Im going on, I held you oh so long
Oh, Im going on, to find where I belong

I felt I was happy, no-one knew about me
Someday they will find out, how brave I've been
Oh, I held you oh so long

Oh, Im going on, I held you oh so long
Oh, Im going to the other side of dawn
Oh, Im going on like a hungry lion

But how strange, I felt empty, days didnt pass by
I missed you, felt helpless, I have to confess

Oh, Im coming back 'coz I held you oh so long
Oh, I need you so, theres no point in pretending
Oh, Im coming on, theres no hungry lion inside myself
