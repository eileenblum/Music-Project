[Son:] I saw the eyes of the american war machine
[Father:] Its such a fine way of thinking to get us some scene
[Son:] The video war games can sometimes be so boring!
[Father:] Sand castles made to crash! Youre not a boy anymore
If you cant grab a gun youll stay alone at the shore
and everybody thinks youre too childlish and unable to get along!

[Zombie (comes):] Come here - you got caught!
I got my eyes on you! Be good, be my body -
I put my lies in you!

Do you remember when your daddy felt quite mad
'coz he didnt understand why you felt so sad;
[Father:] My boy, you have to face it, youre becoming a man!
Still you feel changin tunes where ever you go
Though even girls are looking at you everywhere
but I know baby, c'mon and get your share!

Lie of the Zombie (yeah!)...
Lie of the Zombie (yeah!)... Dont mess with the man!
Lie of the Zombie (yeah!)...
Lie of the Zombie (yeah!)... Dont mess with the Sam!

[Son:] Today I slept through my broken dream
Hmm, it wasnt how it should be...
[Zombie:] Code number 102!
[Son:] Now I think theyre going to cut me to pieces
Can I ever get the right answer or just lies
Nevermind 'coz theres no right way to swallow my pride
I am what I am on this crazy stand! (Lend your hand!)
[Zombie:] Please stop looking around
Please stop looking around - I got my lies in you!
Please stop looking around
Please stop looking around - I got my eyes in you!

[Son:] does it matter anymore?!

[Chorus]
