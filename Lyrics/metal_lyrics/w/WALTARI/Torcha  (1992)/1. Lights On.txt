You think you're smart when you dance so hot, but you wink your eyes too fast
Ooh, how hard wed try to manage this night could never last
Take this moment and slide into freedom an play this game of love
Same old story, its easy to guess - you'll get my body torn

Power is so attractive, yeah, it makes me use my gun
Ooh, how hard you try to manage this game can't make you a nun
Be my boss and use your freedom and pay for your sins later
Let's get down to business and shut these fucking lights, yeah

You'd better turn the lights on
You'd better turn the lights on
You'd better turn the lights on
Move on honey, its so dark in here
You'd better turn the lights on
You'd better turn the lights on (deep in your head)
You'd better turn the lights on
Move on masses, move your asses on!

Why do you try to act like someone who knows everything
In fact youre just a lost little girl who tries to save her own skin
Why don'tcha try to convince me, try to really turn me on
Instead of cheating and telling me lies show that youre a real one!

You'd better turn the lights on
You'd better turn the lights on
You'd better turn the lights on
Move on honey, cant you turn me on
You'd better turn the ligts on
You'd better turn the ligts on (deep in your head)
You'd better turn the ligts on
Move your asses, move on masses!

Hey, you creepies, turn the lights!
You'd better turn the lights on...

You'd better turn the lights on
You'd better turn the lights on
Why do we treat each other like it was the end of the human race

You'd better turn the lights on
You'd better turn the lights on
You'd better turn the lights on
Move on masses, move your asses!
