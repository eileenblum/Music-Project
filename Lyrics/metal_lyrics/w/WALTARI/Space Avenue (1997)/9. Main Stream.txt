[Musik: Hatakka / Latvala, Lyrics: Hatakka]

I wanna kill your mind
I wanna kill your brain
I wanna kill your schemes
I wanna kill your dreams

Open your head open your mind
Open your heart show me some pride
The shadows are growing longer
For this rising breed!

I wanna kill your needs
I wanna kill your seeds
I wanna kill the saturation
I wanna kill your aim

Open your mind open your brains
Open your eyes open your veins
The shadows are growing longer
For this rising breed!

Main stream world is over!
I won't trust it anymore
A greedy brain is progress
With no real intuition
We forgot ourselves somewhere!

I wanna kill your stream
With an endless freeze
Kill the luxury!
The financial dreams

Main stream world is over!
I won't trust it anymore
A greedy brain is progress
With no real intuition
We forgot ourselves somewhere!

Main stream world is over!
I won't trust it anymore
Walking in the streets makes me feel I'm far too stressed
Only rats will have my share

We'd like to see this land come alive!
We'd like to see this land come alive!
I wanna kill your dreams!
I wanna kill your mind!
