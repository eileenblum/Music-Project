[Musik: Somerjoki, english lyrics: Hatakka]

The external light is sitll waiting
Dark forms huge vault all around
It becomes clear that my mind's full of fear
I can't get no release for today
Behind the sun we are reaching
Insanity laughing inside
Why are we still here, space is so near
We could drift away, far into the distance

Tars are shining
But I am just one turning pale
Stars are shining
This world is no fairytale
Stars are shining
But darkness inside is so mean
Stars are shining
This life is merely a dream

Countdown has already started
People are packing their bags
I need a rest coz my pain is the best
To tell where this path really should go
You tell me that the dishes are dirty
That I should be walkin' dog
Maybe it's tragic, but it's so magic
Our fortune is not here at all

Stars are shining
I'd like to reach you again
Stars are shining
Eternal is my earthy pain
Stars are shining
But I am just one turning pale
Stars are shining
Behind the time I will sail

Stars are shining
But I am just one turning pale
Stars are shining
This world is no fairytale
Stars are shining
But I am in love with my pain
Stars are shining
This life is merely insane

STARS ARE SHINING!
