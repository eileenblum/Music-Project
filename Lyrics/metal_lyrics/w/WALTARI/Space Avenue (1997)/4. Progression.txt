[Musik: Hatakka / Latvala, Lyrics: Hatakka]

Machines start to ruin your poise
You see the damage, you hear the noise
Damage - damn age, you see the light and then the next page
Progression is the way to go
But who takes care if you flow
If I'm ready for today, my mind is on the way
Lose yourself to the windows pages
The files of internal rages
"the new brave" await but you lose your grip
In a hallucination trip
Amen we are the new breed
And we heave to follow our time
But ussualy the masses will only fail
If they follow the only sign
You don't wanna stop (the way you're going)
You don't wanna stop (the way you don't care)
You don't wanna stop (the way you're exploding)
You don't wanna care coz you are dead!
What is your life
