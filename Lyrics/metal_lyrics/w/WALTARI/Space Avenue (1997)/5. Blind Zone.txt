[Musik: Lehtinen, Lyrics: Hatakka / Ebanks / Lehtinen]

Blind zone lies deep within a young man
The lost cells are floating in bioplasma
Blind zone lies deep within an old man
Unconsciousness rules, you can't see the plan
Blind Johnny has one pint in his hand
The soul is searching for a place to hide
But blind zone always decides what you can
You can't do anything, the cells like planets are your destiny

Blind Johnny crawls into garbage can
He keeps drinking 'till he can't understand
But blind zone makes jupiter take a ride
And those small cells inside start to crawl out into the dark sky

All in all in one we're all like... (not just empty space inside)
All in all in one we're all like one cell in a soul bomb!
All in all in one we're all like... (not just empty space inside)
All in all in one we're all like one cell in a soul bomb!

One for all and all for one
Hear us now, Johnny started to run. sommademma say, ain't no way
And sommademma say - it's gonna be today
Boundaries givin's us delay but like Bob Marley: don't wanna wait
In vain
'coz basically, everyone wants the same
So are we just one - with different names?
Some of us brave, some of us afraid
Some of us say it, some of us wait
Take off your mask - life is no parade
Who ya think ya foolin'? when yaself is a fake
Simple and clear - we gotta be aware
Conscious mind leads the way
But the blinded narrow minded zone
Only controls - what we call fear

All in all in one we're all like... (not just empty space inside)
All in all in one we're all like one cell in a soul bomb!
All in all in one we're all like... (not just empty space inside)
All in all in one we're all like one cell in a soul bomb!
