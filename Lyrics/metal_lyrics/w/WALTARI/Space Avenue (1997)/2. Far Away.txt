[Musik: Hatakka / Parviainen / Suomalainen, Lyrics: Hatakka]

I don't want to live like this
I don't want to rest in peace
I better face myself
I wanna go go go go go
Wanna die, it s time to wave goodbye
I better face myself

You been reaching for
What you adore
But I need something that I really love
You shouldn't try
To shape my mind
But I've got something that I'd die for

I've been trying all the time
To reach a level that will keep me high
You better watch yourself
I know there's a place where I can go
When I can live in peace with my rock n roll
Maybe I'll have the strength to carry on
To become really strong

You been reaching for
What you adore
But I need something that I really love
You shouldn't try
To shape my mind
But I've got something that I'd die for

You contend that I am wasting all my time
You demand that I should wait and keep on following you
But I cannot turn myself into someone else
The burning flame inside demands me to go far away

You been reaching for
What you adore
But I need something that I really love
You shouldn't try
To shape my mind
But I've got something that I'd die for
