I'm penetration in through the door locked tight
Into your small one room apartment
I am careful of every steo I take now
So I won't awaken you

Like thin air I am circling around your room
I'm coming in through the ventilation pipes
With no direction
Like an aeronaut I wanish into the sky

Spin beynd the mad luxury

The crawling look at the midnight staring at TV
Like hypnotized by wooden box
With no suspicion
Completely known as a prisoner of luxury
