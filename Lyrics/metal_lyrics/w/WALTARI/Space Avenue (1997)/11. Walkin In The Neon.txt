[Musik: Hatakka, Lyrics: Hatakka]

Everyboy, like a homeless toy,
Serches for the real joy
But soon they'll see how it will be,
Sorroundings kills, life turns to pills
You are what you see- pure destiny,
You grab first you see, immediately
But please don't really believe in anyone, accept what you feel

Stay strong you're never alone
Leave the bad behind
Concetrate on what's important

Go wrong take the illusions of society
And wrap yourself in the darkness of your luxury

Who cares about the universe,
Who cares about happiness?
You should know the only way to go is the hardware stress
But hardest way to life,
The hardest way to the truth
Will make us humans lose

[Chorus]
We're part of the magical movie
We're walkin' in the neon (trancevision)
We believe there's power to do it
We are hungry for the real life

Your parents can't see they're mentally dead
Tangled in a web around your head
There's somebody in but in too deep,
Stay strong you'll hear when your heart gives a beep
There's something wrong around this place,
There's an voverdose of human disgrace
Stay clean and drift towards the sun,
Remember life can be real fun

Wake up you're on your way to the wrong side
You lose yourself to the media corrosion

Loosen up don't believe what you hear
Take a peace of your own life sow the seeds of reality

[Chorus]
We're the part of the magical movie
We're walkin' in the neon (trancevision)
We believe there's power to do it
We are waiting for a new life

[Chorus]
