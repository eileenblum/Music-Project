[Musik: Hatakka / Latvala, Lyrics: Hatakka]

Sitting in a local bus
Ready to "take away"
I feel it strained around me
People with hollow pain
Looking outside the window
Seeing heavy rain
Human memories are dim
Only pressure in my veins

Purify yourself
Just settle down so you won't need nobody else
Purify yourself
You don't need another cage
Purify yourself
Instead of digging in your dirt, please let it go!
Purify yourself
Don't wanna see you going insane

Don't expect me to be a jesus to your world
You have jesus inside your head, so cure yourself like you would
Someone
Else
Don't walk
Don't ask me to sympathize
If you don't want me to critizise
If you're interested in yourself
Life will be so hard

Purify yourself
Just settle down so you won't need nobody else
Purify yourself
You don't need another cage
Purify yourself
Instead of digging in your dirt, please let it go!
Purify yourself
Please, wash your dirt away
Purify yourself
The party continues anyway
Step aside from being in vain!
