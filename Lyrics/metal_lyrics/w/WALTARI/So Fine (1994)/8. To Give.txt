Are you in now?
Are you in now babe?

Hello from nowhere
Hello you backwards
It seems to be realy cold out there
Better keep a long distance

Nice to meet you, funny guy, you look so sad, moving around and around
Clap your hands, clap your feet, make your way through blindfolded
Every night, every day, where your head goes it's the wrong way
Step ahead, step behind everywhere, all the same kind

Isolation seems to be what you deserve
You were trying, but now the beast is in your head

I see the Wall Street
I see high buildings
Too much to take, too little to give
Strange, you're still aiming to the couds (clouds?), anyway!

Isolation is the state we'll keep you in
Still we're worrying, worrying 'bout your head spinnin'
See me fying (flying?), I would have so much to give
But you're lazy, you just need more things for living

[CHORUS:]
Beat it, leave it, baby, beat it
Beat it, baby, life's not such a graveyard
Beat it, leave it, baby, beat it
Beat it, man, you are much more than you think
Beat it, leave it, baby, beat it
Beat it, bayby, life's not such a graveyard
Beat it, babe, that's not reailty
Beat it now 'coz you have much more to give
