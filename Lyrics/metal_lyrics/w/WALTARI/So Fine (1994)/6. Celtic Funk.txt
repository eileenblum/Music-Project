Here comes Good Ol'Satan
Watchout! Noise lunatics are in town
No chance to escape anywhere 'coz they're all the time around!
They kill your deepest dreams
Of possible peace and harmony
They penetrate in every mind, there's no way to rest in peace
They shake good vibes on everyone
They shake good vibes on everyone
Take care of yourself or otherwise you'll be bitten in the end
Lock yourself in your house
Hide yourself under a blanket
Try to think of something nice 'coz this disaster's spreading all over the place

UH-UH
UH-UH
HEY HEY
Hi you scared face, here's to you, it's big lush case

They kill your peace in every single town
They kill your peace in every single town
You can't be convincing anymore
They just laugh while pushing you to the real depression
Skins don't like it, politicians hate it
Music professionals lose their faith
Everybody's watching each other: is this the end of the world?

UH-UH...
Hi-ho music man, here's to you, it's an anti-band!

[CHORUS:]
Don't need your "mega-tips" for a frown
I just wanna fly above the ground

This is just a loss of space!
Mankind lose it's clean face!
People can't stand this any longer
Please let us stay in peace!
Noway! these stranges shout
'coz this is really what life's about
There's no use to turn around
It's real life all what's found

UH-UH...
Hi-ho silly man, here's to you, it's all in your head!

[CHORUS]
