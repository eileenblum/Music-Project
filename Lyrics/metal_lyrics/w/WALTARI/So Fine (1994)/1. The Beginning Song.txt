Island in the city, music in the air
Waiting for the feeling, and surprise: it's right there!

I dressed up in a cloth of lion
I wanted to avoid growing thin, so
That I couldn't blame myself not running faster

I took my courage, I felt so hungry
And hunger is a greed that makes you achieve
Something more than you are in now

[CHORUS I:]
I want my life, you'd better beware of my mind
But you are here and this is a hungry lion dance
I wanna hit and run and you'd better beware of my kind
'coz you're bit green and I know well what I've come here to take

I saw a big field
I saw the moonshine
I saw the black figures in horizon
Don't you be afraid of me babe
I'm faster than your fright

You shiny angel, wearing crystals
You will recognize the rebel without a pause
Still I'll wait, on the final scene before the edge

[CHORUS 2:]
I want your love, you'd better beware of my life
'coz you are near and this is a hungry lion dance
I wanna hit and run without an easy way
I'm hungry for you love and I really don't like to pass you

Island in the city, music in the air
Waiting for the feeling, and surprise: it's right there!

[CHORUS 3:]
I want your love you'd better beware of my mind
'coz you're so green and I know well where I'm aiming to
I wanna split and run without an easy way
But still you are here and I really don't like to slip you through
