It's a mystery, when I see your
pretty face around your burning lips
But when I think of myself, inside
I'm so shy
That I could cry having those
memories so far
The glorious nation of lovely party
girls won't let me go in my dreams

No one can hold me tight
When I fly throught the night

Ooh... misty man, misty man

I live with a girl who ain't good
enought to make love to foolish guys
And my "Paradise" doesn't wanna
hear me playing piano all the time
I have to try to have my baby back,
hope she makes me feel alright
(she makes me feel so fresh)

No-one can hold me tight
When I fly through the night

Ooh... misty man, misty man

I want to break free, I want to be
free and see the real color of your eyes

Ooh... misty man, misty man
