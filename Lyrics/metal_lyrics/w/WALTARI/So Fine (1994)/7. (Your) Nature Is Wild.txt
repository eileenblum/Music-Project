(Your nature is wild.
I wanna see through you
Let's kiss the world....forget the depression!)

I surrender... I surrender... again...
I surrender... this land again, ooh
I surrender...

You are so beautiful I want to take it four...
I am so beautifu... I could whisper in your ear...

I am so beautiful my mind is waiting
You are so beautiful my mind is shaking again
I kiss this land!

(This so-called recession, doesn't realy depress anyone...)
Gotta get out, get out of this fever...
I kiss the land!

We want to be free again, so let us be free again!
