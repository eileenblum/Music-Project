[The God Amighty:] "I curse this people to the deepset hole
I make them suffer and feel like absolutely nothing!"

C'mon baby, I wanna nasty ride
You know it's time to lose my pride
I wanna keep my feet on the ground
Don't wanna live for sight and sound

Don't you leave me alone tonite
I'm so shy and it makes me cry
Bastard, the whole life's a bastard
I live like a stone, I just am

[CHORUS:]
Living is so easy, nasty and little
Living piggy in the middle
Living is so easy, nasty and little
Living piggy in the middle
(everyday!)
Find me a place to stay
'coz I don't wanna fade away
Living piggy in the middle
(everyday!)

Hurry up there's no time to rest
'coz working makes you real man, the best
You will see when the day is done
You get cheers from everyone
I can't sing and I can't talk
I just need my own New York
You know it's that tragical history,
tragical history of living:

[CHORUS:]
Living is so easy, nasty and little
Living piggy in the middle
Living is so easy, nasty and little
Living piggy in the middle
(everyday!)
Find me a place to hide
'coz hiding is the best way to die
And me, working as slave, every day!

You see when I'm walking
I hear nobody talking
I live for my telly
And I work for my belly
I build the new houses that no-one
wants to use
I can't get rid of this 'cause
I wanna lose

[CHORUS:]
Living is so easy, nasty and little
Living piggy in the middle
Living is so easy, nasty and little
Living piggy in the middle
(everyday!)
Trying to find a place to stay
If I can't, I won't pray today
For me, it's living like a dog, every day!

(this is my life)
(this is my life)
