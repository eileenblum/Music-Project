Towards an autumn
Towards, darkness
(Better) fight the power!
Like a New Years Eve
A new day has just begun
Keep yourself sharp, sharp as a knife!
Towards the sunset
Towards the distance
(Better) fight the power

Through the year
Spread a wider atmosphere
Shine your light on the autumn sky!
Be brave in the human race
Confront your feelings face to face!

Towards an autumn
Towards darkness
(Better) fight the power!
A start of a new circle
A new day has just begun
Keep yourself sharp, sharp as a knife...
