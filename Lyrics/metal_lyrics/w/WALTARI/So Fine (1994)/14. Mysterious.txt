(Every day, every day...)

I'd like to get out of this lunatic thought
But as long as it is there, I wanna get caught
I can't get any sleep
'cause I don't live a dream
Life is not a casualty
And that's just where I've been

Hitch-hiking away throught these mysterious days
I think we are the medal of the previous 2 billion years
It's a flight out of time
And I have only a dime
It's real hard to imagine
That there's no time at all

Now I'll take my final step to the unknown
Nothing can really stop me, 'cause I'm on my own
Only thing I would like to take with me is you
Yo, please come to me, take my advice.
And I'll show you...

(... the mysterious part of life!!)
