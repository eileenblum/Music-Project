I wanna stop again this masturbation I'm doing all night and day
I wanna escape my mental isolation, it's where I don't wanna stay
My voice is just for you, I want to serve it
Extended version of this game
So I made up my mind, I left the craft and stayed on the revolution

[Chorus:]
Send a postcard of your birth
I'm the one who stayed on the earth (I'll collect you honey!)
Raise a gun and shoot for a curse
What we'd need now is to delete what we have deserved

The shaman's drifting now somewhere in the clouds , and I say that we all have our doubts
The nature wants us to stay somewhere else, but senses freeze inside our brains

Sometimes I hear some voices calling my name, they sound like music to my ear
Someone still keeps on thinking about my name, and I should do the same

[Chorus]

(I'll collect you honey!)

[Chorus:]
Now I feel I must get strong
Fear of weakness and getting old (break the chains now honey!)
Change the system back to the old
Save the souls and be bold and resow the earth
