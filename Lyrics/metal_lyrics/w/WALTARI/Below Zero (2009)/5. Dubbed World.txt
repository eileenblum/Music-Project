[Chorus:]
All the places where I've been
I've found myself from somewhere in between
All the dreams that can be made
Will be destroyed by history once been paid

Understand me and my religion
No censored words with addition

It is this dubbed world that keeps me insane
All I can follow is laughter and pray
What you are talking is not what you say
Speak to me, just what they want you to say

[Chorus]

So that's why we are here!

Call me back again! (they call me Mingus Treason)
Call me back again! (I am your painful reason)
Call me back again! (I'm here to cease your season)
Call me back again! (here comes the royal freedom!)

Sack the ego maniac...

It is this dubbed world that keeps me insane
All I can understand is laughter and pray
What you are talking is not what you say
Speak to me, with no-one between you and your brain

[Chorus]

Call me back again! (they call me Mingus Treason)
Call me back again! (I am your painful season)
Call me back again! (I'm here to cease your reasons)
Call me back again! (here comes the cry of freedom!)
