Who will take you to the highway
This endless road that never fades away
It sneaks into your dirty dreams
It never gives you self-esteem

[Chorus:]
Oh, are you still following my way
Covering your tears with my blood? (I know you want everything)
Oh, now we ride the endless highway
Dark rain fills the road forming flood

Mother never gave me company
Always hungry for so many things
Dad was always inside his mind
He never understood this file

[Chorus 2:]
Now you're still following my way
Covering your tears with my blood? (I know you want everything)
Now, now we ride the endless highway
Dark rain fills the road forming flood (you need something, just anything)

Tears are nothing!

Pain will follow this hollow road
Can you feel how it eats so...
You need to find the other way
Side road that never goes astray

[Chorus]

Oh, ...forming flood (need something, just anything!)
