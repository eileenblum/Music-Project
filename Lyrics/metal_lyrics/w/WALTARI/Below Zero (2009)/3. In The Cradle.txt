I know, I feel, I'm the thing moving in the cradle and I'm a part of the Frail

[Chorus:]
I know, I feel, I'm the thing rocking in the cradle thou I'm a part of the Frail
I know, c'mon you friend, I'm the thing rocking in the cradle and I'm the part of the Frail

I'm drifting in the night on a calm sea
I'm flying on the edge of the night
The seagulls spread their wings is all I see
I start to drift towards the daylight

The city's raising into the new dawn
The streets are silent as the man's mind
I like this peace around me, it feels right
Like a golden bright view in my sight

[Chorus]

Now, two boys kissing in the children room
When left alone in the shade
While their wise parents overfed and drunk
Lying around doing nothing... anymore

Now, two boys kissing in the children room
When left alone in the shade
While their wise parents overfed and drunk
Socializing with telly... fake... fake... fake!

[Chorus]
