Solitary soul like a virgin priest
Ancient mannequin of the modern feast
A lot of energy is a painful weight
But could you give up this blessed fate?

You'll stay away from the Morocco dose
It's just here to tease
You please yourself with a dream to pose
For the cast, at last with tears

[Chorus:]
I won't build my destiny based on your attraction
It's my own satisfaction, whatever you may give
This is what I really need: The self experienced fraction
It's my own satisfaction...

...the moment of the bottom of my heart!

Now we get mad, baby
Hope you get mad too, baby...

Too much greed is not your mate
Intoxication of your inner state
As the last supper "your heart you ate"
Just to make it there
Sadness blinds you: to judge your fate
Leading you to hate
It sucks to wait, being too late
Nobody serves your fate

[Chorus]

...the bottom of my heart

And see, one day you will wake up
With no one around, in sight
Feeling just so hated and dismissed
Do you really want it that way?
I'd prefer to leave it all, right now!

[Chorus 2:]
I won't build my destiny on somebody's action
It's my own satisfaction whatever you may feel
This is what I really need: The self experienced fraction
It's my own satisfaction...

...the moment of the bottom of my heart!
