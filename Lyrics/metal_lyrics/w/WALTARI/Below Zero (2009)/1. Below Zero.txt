My frost philosophy will put no curse on me
It sets my mind so free, the far reality

Freezing death, my veins work under threat
My pain's hurt
My body's working at the full god's speed
My cold body's shaking
My cold mind is aching
But I would die if I now chose to give in

[Chorus:]
I feel no cold, I feel no fear inside my mind
Now I'm full of energy, electric shock feels in my feet
I feel the strength, how it will purify my mind
I live below zero

Energy is reaching my dead skin like drifting
I'm drowning in the healing of this cold ride
Ain't it neat, no one can hide or cheat himself from
Being a survivor suffering coldness of pure

My frost philosophy...

[Chorus + Chorus 2:]
I feel no cold, I feel no fear inside my mind
Now I'm full of energy, you cannot put a curse on me!
I feel the strength, how it will purify my mind
I live below zero

[Chorus + Chorus 2]

I feel no cold inside my mind, I need fresh air to purify
I feel no fear, it makes me fine, the blood is running out of time
I feel no cold inside my mind, I need fresh air to purify
I feel no fear, it makes me fine, the blood is running out of time
