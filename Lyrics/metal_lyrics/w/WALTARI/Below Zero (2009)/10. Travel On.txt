Do not wait for me, I'm too slow
Just move on, now to make it grow
I will follow if I can
Won't be buried in the sand
Don't be stuck to the gloomy world
It's all in your poor head making it all worth
Save yourself 'cause the truth is close
Travel on from your deadly pose

Move on you wild soldier, travel on
Get it on, move it on, push it on...

[Chorus:]
Open your dead eyes to see the truth, reality
Which is not in this disguise we're living in
Truth is somewhere else, the place is somewhere near to reach
Destination's known, so no fear, travel on!

You can be buried in the dark doomy sand
Which covers you and freezes the blood in your hand
The stressful routine is killing your brain
It leads you to the real damnation of pain

Move on you wild soldier, travel on
Get it on, move it on, push it on...

[Chorus]

I wanna part of me too!

[Chorus]
