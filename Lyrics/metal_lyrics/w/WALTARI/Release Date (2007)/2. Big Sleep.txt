Is it so that you're not interested in facing this day?Â 
None of your pains will reach you, if you just escapeÂ 
So be blessed you little innocent soul with your wayÂ 
Just fading out you turn your problems just awayÂ 

[Chorus:]
Crawl on the floor without finding the doorÂ 
It's so easy to fall into a big sleepÂ 

I see you drifting away into oblivionÂ 
thinking it's just the same where we have reached beforeÂ 
Middling wuality is getting a grip on you, can't you see?Â 
Knowing that is just a straight way to hellÂ 

[Chorus:]
Crawl on the floor without finding the doorÂ 
It's so easy to fall into a big sleep
