The endless stream is touching the skyÂ 
when entertaining warriors will play the next lineÂ 
The others stayed, I wentÂ 
Too much time here I've spentÂ 

It's warmer here where I used to stayÂ 
The restless soul will start to playÂ 
I took a lift to the line of 1000 exciting mindsÂ 

Suffocation exctasy is filling me inÂ 
To be free in jailÂ 
To shoot, to be a hero!Â 

The wheels are leading to the skyÂ 
of neon lights, flashing byÂ 
The money is not the thingÂ 
but raging for my right to liveÂ 

Machine gun steel keeps me awakeÂ 
while two cock-needing pets bring me to the cityÂ 

It looks the building's way too highÂ 
I'd like to point my mind off the skyÂ 
(I could fuck you on the roof!)Â 

Neon lights against the dark sky,Â 
full of beauty, hanging highÂ 
The space's burning, the roof's not straightÂ 
I'll be the god of this night game!Â 

I'll never watch you, mdma...Â 

Stop your dreams! Now it seems, we are late for our fateÂ 
We're not clear, leaving fear. We're alone, rolling stone!Â 
A shaman, just a man, make no sense not immenseÂ 
Time to go into the flow!Â 
End of freedom, end of show!
