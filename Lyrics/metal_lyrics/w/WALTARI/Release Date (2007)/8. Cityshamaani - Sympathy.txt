There is no way to follow meÂ 
Asking my name is threatening meÂ 
Always ready to talk to the passers-byÂ 
The way they look - I am simplified...Â 

I'll get bored of just being hereÂ 
I've kept holding on so longÂ 
I keep searching for the exitÂ 
To feel alive beyond the tearsÂ 

Small shop windows are churning outÂ 
All kinds of dolls with frozen smilesÂ 
But I can't see any of my kind...Â 
Except the bright lights of the streets... or my mindÂ 

I've been told: Life's a phobiaÂ 
But like a bold ne, I still feel my utopiaÂ 
I will go on for my melodiaÂ 
Keeping my mind in insomniaÂ 

Sirens calling and I tell them to come soonÂ 
Everyday they're calling night time...Â 
Silence calls when I feel down and heaven lingers onÂ 
in the dawn; a real dawn!Â 

Naked in the dawn we fly into the nightÂ 
Wasted in the fog we cry for the lightÂ 
While I'm closing in... closing insideÂ 
While I'm closing inside... i nevery wayÂ 

With a faded scarf on his headÂ 
he tries to infiltrateÂ 
to the crowd cover his red eyes of yesterday,Â 
under his rasta hairÂ 

To be free in jail...Â 

What's it to be like a big dipper, a teen whore scream?Â 
That's not what I believe in...Â 
though just to be high, used to be cruelÂ 
Don't wanna be just high and tied to the flashlights and strobos of mindÂ 

I don't feel that I belong in hereÂ 
Right, I, beneath the chrome metal escalators, I, (hi!), don't feel that I belong in here
