I'm never more than I sangÂ 
Asking for more and I canÂ 
I'm traveling down with my hopÂ 
I'm never bored in your handÂ 

[Chorus:]Â 
I recognize just myselfÂ 
I recognize just myselfÂ 
I recognize only my eyesÂ 
I realize it satisfectsÂ 
I recognize just myselfÂ 

To by right, running a rideÂ 
Maybe I fall in... maybe... loveÂ 
I'm running down with my hopÂ 
Am I blind, am I sure?Â 

[Chorus]
