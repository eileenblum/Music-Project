I will find my way to youÂ 
and play my blues to you in C-toneÂ 
Yes, I'll crawl into your greasy mindÂ 
while telling blah blah: "I'm so sorry"Â 

I won't be able to stand straight no moreÂ 
so please, catch me if I fallÂ 
I'll be forever on your bigger levelÂ 
I'll be your enemy and whoreÂ 
I won't be able to stand straight no moreÂ 
so please, catch me if I fallÂ 
We are the remedy, we are the tragedyÂ 
Let's puke together once more!Â 

You like to escape? Just follow meÂ 
The king of dreams for this long nightÂ 
I'll lean on you if you'll lean on meÂ 
I keep you in my grip so tightÂ 

I won't be able to stand straight no moreÂ 
casting our spell out of reachÂ 
I'll be forever on your bigger levelÂ 
Let's suck the shit out of eachÂ 
I won't be able to stand straight no moreÂ 
so please, catch me if I fallÂ 
We are the remedy, we are the magic team
Let's puke together once more!Â 

Puke together!

I won't be able to stand straight no moreÂ 
so please, catch me if I fallÂ 
I'll be forever on your bigger levelÂ 
I'll be your enemy and whoreÂ 
I won't be able to stand straight no moreÂ 
so please, catch me if I fallÂ 
We are the remedy, we are the tragedyÂ 
Let's puke together once more!
