Just take your trendy shirt and you'll be heading for massesÂ 
The teen style's beautiful: It breaks the innocence, crashesÂ 

It's a fallen nation (just take this step into the crowd!)Â 
It's so far from creationÂ 
The mayday is running thru your veinsÂ 

[Chorus:]
Let's head for the masses as it crashes your lost soulÂ 
No chance for the beauty, the beast praises your heart made of coldÂ 
Let's head for the masses as it crashes your lost soulÂ 
Let's act like the others do: Get marked and then get stamped!Â 

I saw the changing lineÂ 
I saw my friends losing fireÂ 
I saw how proud they feelÂ 
being the slaves of desireÂ 

It's a big penetration into the dreams of yesterdayÂ 
It's a falling nationÂ 
The mayday is running thru your veinsÂ 

[Chorus 2:]
Let's head for the masses as it crashes your lost soulÂ 
No chance for the beauty,the beast praises your heart made of coldÂ 
Let's break the real consciousness of feeling all the loveÂ 
Let's act like the others do: Get marked and then get stamped!Â 

As it comes to thisÂ 
When it feels the sameÂ 
There is one to blame, just meÂ 

As it comes to thisÂ 
I don't like this gameÂ 
This feels a lonely place to be...set me free...without you...Â 

[Chorus:]
Let's head for the masses as it crashes your lost soulÂ 
No passion for beauty,the beast praises your heart made of coldÂ 
Let's head for the masses as it crashes your lost soulÂ 
Let's act like the others do: Get marked and then get stamped!
