[Shaman:]
I was invited to that dark concrete buildingÂ 
Veins on my forehead banging, had emptied my batteryÂ 
What do they want from me? I owe them nothingÂ 
I was raised by TV and computer action-gamesÂ 
I live alone, doing 0.K.Â 
Why should I give them everything now?Â 
I could keep on living in peace if they'd just let me beÂ 

[Robots:]
Dear boy, we called you then,Â 
we need the proof that you are our friendÂ 
It is time to fill your duty for this community!Â 

We can't watch you no more being no manÂ 
Forgotten all the good advice from your mom'n'dad?Â 
If you got no money, you ain't got no brainÂ 
If you go on like this, you'll become insaneÂ 

We won't watch it like this another dayÂ 
If you're not on my side, you're my enemyÂ 
Now it's time to choose your final wayÂ 
come with us or we'll kick you out!Â 

[Chorus:]Â 
[Shaman:]
I'm not your humble servant, you're not my real master,Â 
though my life will be like this: One hell of a testerÂ 
I will choose my way for freeÂ 
and preserve the pure naturalityÂ 
Although it dangers my destiny, I'm ready, if I fall... just take meÂ 

I'll keep on fighting for the room I haveÂ 
You just can't take it from me, try to understandÂ 
It's unfair to judge me for the way I amÂ 
As long as I won't harm anyone in this canÂ 

Kick my brains out!Â 

[Chorus]
