HypeÂ 
Wanna see you now in flamesÂ 
Wanna see how much you can't get out of meÂ 
Spiritwalker, shot by brainsÂ 
Johnny Walker death in a family afternoonÂ 

Rap:Â 
"When the mouth's opened on a corridor for a strong languageÂ 
and the stratosphere will get ready for an explosionÂ 
In the streets the stereotypes keep going on the same circlesÂ 
and we will get ready for an opening again"Â 

Winter's coming in againÂ 
Faces running to the dark dim yesterdayÂ 
Entertaining aces highÂ 
Everybody wants to reach the melting skyÂ 

Disappearing never diesÂ 
It's a wasted line of a liner in deep swayÂ 
Sway towards the melting skyÂ 
Sky below the red light, burning out of reachÂ 

First command: outÂ 
Last command: inÂ 

We're going round and round and roundÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
Like the ravers in their rageÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
Like the lions in their cageÂ 

Serious mid day comesÂ 
when we turn into a machineÂ 
in a serious way!Â 

A wasted line of a liner in deep sway...Â 

We're going round and round and roundÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
Like the ravers in their rageÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
We're going round and round and roundÂ 
Like the lions in their cageÂ 
Like the lovers in their fateÂ 

A WASTED LINE!...
