The dogs at dawn barkingÂ 
Of hunger, no sharkingÂ 
Searching for somethingÂ 
Intention : no runningÂ 

If you ever feel lonely - singÂ 
And life is getting phoney - singÂ 
It is your voice only - singÂ 
That cares so boldly - singÂ 

Pressure, not wantingÂ 
Soul is in huntingÂ 
Life towards ShantiÂ 
Aliens shoutingÂ 

If you ever feel lonely - singÂ 
And life is getting phoney - singÂ 
It is your voice only - singÂ 
that will ring out so loudÂ 

[Chorus:]
Giving it up coz the life is a lie....( One way to hell!)Â 
Wish I could feel you , wish I could save from a farewellÂ 
Running around coz the life is a lie... ( Swords of the spell)Â 
Wish I could heal you..Wish I could heal!Â 

Pressure, not wantingÂ 
Soul is in huntingÂ 
Life towards ShantiÂ 
Aliens shoutingÂ 

If you ever feel lonely - singÂ 
While itÂ´s your voice only - singÂ 
Still you care so boldly - singÂ 
YouÂ´ll wake the dead, sounding brightÂ 

[Chorus:]Â 
I donÂ´t care if you paint my Jesus in a funny wayÂ 
Cause in fact , I think in a same wayÂ 
Can you apologize ? Or would it be bad for your business?Â 
Can you apologize ? Or are you too proud to beg? Coz I ainÂ´t!!!Â 

If you ever feel lonely - singÂ 
And life is getting phoney - singÂ 
It is your voice only - singÂ 
that will ring out so loud!Â 

[Chorus:]
