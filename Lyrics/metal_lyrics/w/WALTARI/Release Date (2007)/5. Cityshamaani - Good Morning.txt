I, shaman, trudging aimlessly in the shades of the neon lightsÂ 
(all day running!... hunting!... wanting!)Â 
White snowflakes falling, flashing under the halogene lampsÂ 
(Warning: It's morning! Morning is coming!)Â 
The leaves of a plastic tree under a bright white mistÂ 
(warning, falling, wanting, running) In the snow make-upÂ 
girl hobgoblins trudging with their boots...Â 

I keep on wantingÂ 
I keep on searchingÂ 
I keep on huntingÂ 

...For when the mankind's struggling for their safety, preservationÂ 
The poor are raising their huge force against the domination!Â 
(every machine needs some oil to moveÂ 
Coffee with a muffin makes me groove...)Â 

Good that there's some cents in my pocketÂ 
from the last night's raveÂ 
It's time to go and meet some friends in Robert's CafÃ©Â 
I could stay Travolta all night longÂ 
But now it's good to stay calm and live for minimal productÂ 
(I live for a minimal product...)Â 

I did never believe that way, that merry-go-roundÂ 
is all what we needÂ 
I'm not taking in of what you say, to raise a familyÂ 
and work all dayÂ 

Oh I keep shining in my tired mind, being friends with everyoneÂ 
To be free, not being in jail...
