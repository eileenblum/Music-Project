A Biergarten, alot of laughing facesÂ 
A grip of a huge pintÂ 
A tiny glimpse of nice relaxation to which we have the rightÂ 
The schlager backround noise is making me feel dizzyÂ 
Or is it just the beer?Â 
That look of the sexy girl is bothering my lazy mindÂ 
Erasing my fearÂ 

Have you ever heard of my desire?Â 
Donât you know my quality is highÂ 
I want to spend the night with you, alright?Â 
Pay the penalty which is hardly mineÂ 
Raging,Â 
come gimme remedy!Â 
Raging,Â 
come gimme remedy!Â 

Watching your back while Iâm walking just behind youÂ 
You didnât say a wordÂ 
Am I an appetite for your personal hunger?Â 
Or just one of the herd?Â 
Sun is shining and reflecting off the grey wallsÂ 
Iâd like to see your pussyÂ 
Your smile is too outrageous 4 meÂ 
And you make me feel fussyÂ 

Have you ever thought of my desire?Â 
You should know my quality is highÂ 
I want to spend the night with you, alright?Â 
Pay the penalty which is hardly mineÂ 

Hiding in the bushes of the BiergartenÂ 
Sweat on my hairy chestÂ 
My coloured black hair caresses your innocent peachy breastsÂ 
Measure me with your silky sweet... Touch...Â 
Like no-one else has done beforeÂ 

Have you ever thought of my desireÂ 
You should know my quality is highÂ 
I want to spend the night with you, alright?Â 
Every little thing... makes me feel youâre thin!Â 
Raging,Â 
come gimme remedy!Â 
Raging,Â 
come gimme remedy!Â 
Raging,Â 
come gimme remedy!Â 
makes me feel youâre thin!Â 
UAARGH
