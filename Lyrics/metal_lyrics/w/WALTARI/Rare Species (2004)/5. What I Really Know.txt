IÂ´m dealing with the devil
forced to think of myself
and you can not pull those strings anymore
IÂ´m selfish and foolish
forced to think of myself
This feeling "down" canÂ´t go on anymore

I should tell you what i really know
but youÂ´re too scared to see what I will show
I should tell you what i really know, what i wanna show

Crazy Angelina
is eating her own oedema
and IÂ´m not here to take it anymore
Madness is spreading
And today is different
DevilÂ´s drinking his own blood to get on

I should tell you what i really know
But youÂ´re too scared to see what i will show
I should tell you what i really know, what i wanna show

IÂ´m into something that doesnÂ´t exist
IÂ´m paying my dues, I canÂ´t resist!
The memories of light canÂ´t turn this into night
Somebody needs a highlight to this life!

I should tell you what i really know!
But youÂ´re too scared to see what i will show!
I should tell you what i really know, what i wanna show!
