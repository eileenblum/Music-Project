Sitting in the dark side of the desire, an admirer
Is there anyone to see me here tonite?
The lust of loving me excites her and feeds her
but dust is the only thing that keeps me moving on

Looking back there was no voice
that was burning in my deep soul
Dontcha know, ItÂ´s all in my dreamworld

Luxury Lotion
You bloody cream
What have you done to me?
You washed all dirt off me
Cleaned the dust of me
to keep it clean!
Luxury Lotion
You bloody cream
What have you done to me?
You washed all dirt off me
Cleaned the dust of me
to keep it clean! ...for my dreamworld.
