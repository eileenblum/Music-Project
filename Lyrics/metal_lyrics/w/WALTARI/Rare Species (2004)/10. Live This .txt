You seek his soul after
cold feelings killed laughter
Your mind is like the concrete wall
The pride is your master
wanting revenge faster
by wearing a grey uniform

There really wasnÂ´t time to tell
the reason why you rang the bell
A fright oppresson is what you feel
You didnÂ´t want to understand
thatÂ´s why you didnÂ´t lend a hand
But as long as weÂ´re able to carry on, I believe

I live this life for love
I live this life for love
There is a light above
I live this life for love

I live this life for love
I live this life for love
There is a light above...
WEÂ´RE ROCKINÂ´ ON THE BORDER OF THE BASS LINE

Talking is cheap labour
Just choose the right flavour
and youÂ´ll hold the heavens with both hands
We lean on each other
but failingÂ´s easier
The problems will be raised so tall

There really wasnÂ´t chance to tell
the reason why you rang the bell
The fear of pain lives inside me
You cannot even judge the news
coz life is just the point of views
but I do know in what we should believe...

I live this life for love
I live this life for love
There is a light above
I live this life for love

I live this life for love
I live this life for love
There is a light above...
