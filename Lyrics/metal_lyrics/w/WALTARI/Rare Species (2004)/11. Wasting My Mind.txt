We are the children of the greed
I want to spend the night with me
Information overload
Just take your asperin and float

Wasting my mind

Home is where your heart will bleed
So arenÂ´t you disconnecting me?
Just check the system right and we'll be plugged in tight
and in overnight IÂ´ll radiate my fright

Wasting my mind

IÂ´ve given everything I own
for an overtired soul
IÂ´m staring at the glass, the windows of my past
IÂ´ll keep the program on and you'll be around...

Wasting my mind!
