Frail as I wonder
I wouldnÂ´t even know my name
If you said that itÂ´s still the same
I wouldnÂ´t believe

Every day weÂ´ll change
and every nite you cannot know
what the next day will show
Nobody will know

We will dream on anyway
though we wonÂ´t care
though we wonÂ´t pray
We will dream on anyway
Against the storm weÂ´ll fight with our pain

Willing to give up
IÂ´m ready to confess causing you a mess
that I didnÂ´t need

One day we will face the truth
We all have different minds
With our permanent crimes
we should get along

We will dream on anyway
though we wonÂ´t care
though we wonÂ´t pray
We will dream on anyway
Against the storm weÂ´ll fight with our pain!

We will dream on anyway
though we wonÂ´t care
though we wonÂ´t pray
We will dream on anyway
Against the storm weÂ´ll fight with pain for that we pay!
