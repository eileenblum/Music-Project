DonÂ´t have to be so tense with me, ThereÂ´s no need, I feel
Machinelike I stay calm that I can hear when you talk

One day, I will get you, out of my mind, for good
I will, I will walk on, into nowhere, out of sight...

The slave is here, the file is on, but I donÂ´t know how to save
Just pay me to stay away, and the danger will be erased

One day, I will get you, out of my mind, for good
I will, I will walk on, into nowhere, out of sight...

One day, I will get you, out of my mind, for good
I will, I will walk on, into nowhere, out of sight...

One day, I will get you, out of my mind, for good
I will, I will walk on, into nowhere, out of lights...
