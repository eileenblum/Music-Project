You are a busy guy, you have no thought of deja vu
You are too realistic boring man, to put the guitars on,
and let the good times groove...
You think you have a clue about the world so evident
and you donÂ´t know how easily your wicked world will burst into small pieces
...without your baby!

Do you believe in life without love?
Do you believe in life without love?
Do you believe in life without love?
Remember how it is to feel so sad
The pc-screen is all that you ever had!

You are an MC-guy, you have a Harley Davidson
YouÂ´d like to show that you're a masterman
Real Rock'n'Roll
(ooh, let the good times go..)
You see the world so narrow that you have no guts to swallow
that the world changes around us all
ThereÂ´s nothing more to see
...without your baby!

Do you believe in life without love?
Do you believe in life without love?
Do you believe in life without love?
