FEAR IS NOT FOR LOVE, IT IS SO CRUEL AND MEAN
BUT IÂ´LL KEEP IT ON, MY FAMILY LIVES IN A MACHINE
TOO TIRED TO TALK,TOO TIRED TO RELAX
TOO MUCH TO DO OR THINK TO STAY ON THE TRACKS
RADICAL SUNRISE IS NOT TO ARRIVE
TO BRING MY MIND INTO A POSITIVE JIVE
YOU CANNOT WIN, THIS PLACE IS JUST TOO BLEAK
YOU CANÂ´T ENJOY UNLESS YOUÂ´RE A FREAK

Quick as day
Quick as a night
like my poor love seems to be as it fades away

Quick as day
Quick as a night
like my poor love seems to be as it fades away

I HEAR THE STEPS COMNG IN TOWARDS MY ROOM
IS IT YOU MONSTER CALLING?, BURSTING LIKE A BALLOON
IS THIS THE END OF MY LIFE, WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG?
ITÂ´S THE TIME OF AXE AND MY FINAL SONG!
BE BOY,GONE BOY, HERE IT COMES: THE FAST TRENDY VISION THAT THE DAY SUMS

WITH NO HAPPY DREAMS, WITH AN UGLY TRUTH
OF HOW TO GET KILLED IN YOUR LIVING ROOM!

Quick as day
Quick as a night
like my poor love seems to be as it fades away

Quick as day
Quick as a night
like my poor love seems to be as it fades away
