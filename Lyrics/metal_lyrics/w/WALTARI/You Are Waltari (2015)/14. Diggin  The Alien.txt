There's someone in my mind
There's someone in my mind showing where to go
Move on with the flow to see the miracle

The place is full of lights
Now there are full of fights who'll get the closest spot
See what is not and here to be pinnacled

[CHORUS:]
The obsession, next to suicide
is attracting so that you'll become blind
when floating in the sun
And someone's clapping in the shade of a light
and will make a quick million overnight
when you're wasting all your fun
diggin the alien

Am I a part of your fucking war?
The least important you are fighting for,
but I'm ok as long as you let me be
Am I a part of your fucking feast?
Starts to feel this all is only for that beast,
for the desperate souls, who want to let it out of control

[CHORUS]

I didn't know, I was so blind
I didn't know, you're so unkind
I didn't know, it hurts me so
I didn't know, please let me go
I didn't know, I was alive
I didin't know, I am alright
I didn't know, don't wanna die
I didn't know, I want to SURVIVE!

[CHORUS]
