Solutions will come one day (solutions will give a way)
Solutions will come one day (solutions can make us stay)
Solutions will make us brave (Are YOU to pray??)
Solutions will break the day
So we will disappear!

[CHORUS:]
So kill yourself but don't kill me
Still have a will to become free
If you're so faithless, don't blame me
it's your own trouble what you must see!
So kill yourself but don't kill me
I have a will to believe
So easy to blame me, now I say:
Hate your beast inside, now just disappear!

Solutions will wipe your tears away and push you for the next stage
You're the dictator of your own sin, the creator of your own grim
Solutions can show the way...if it's not too late
Solutions might make you dead!

Nothing but my last shot..building a tribe of the monsters

[CHORUS:]
So kill yourself but don't kill me
Still have a will to become free
If you're so faithless, don't blame me
it's your own trouble what you must see!
So kill yourself but don't kill me
I have a will to believe
So easy to blame me, now I say:
Hate your beast inside, now just disappear!

Ashes of human kind
Ashes of hollow mind
Raise a sword of our rights,
a right to make us back alive

[CHORUS:]
So kill yourself but don't kill me
Still have a will to become free
If you're so faithless, don't blame me
it's your own trouble what you must see!
So kill yourself but don't kill me
I have a will to believe
So easy to blame me, now I say:
Hate your beast inside, now just disappear!
