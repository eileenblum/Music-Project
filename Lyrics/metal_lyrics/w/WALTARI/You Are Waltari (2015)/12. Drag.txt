Shake your darling!

You're getting old and cold, no bold no more
There's nothing any new to say
You're hiding your skills behind the darkness,
nobody's there with you to play
You speculate about your hitler honey
You stuck to your old yesterday
You're longing for the cold and long revenge,
but you can't do nothing but to pray!

[CHORUS:]
Drag-ism Mad-ism Drag-ism Bad-ism
You talk about yesterday
All I wanna do is to avoid yesterday
Drag-ism Mad-ism Drag-ism Bad-ism
You live around yesterday
but I know I don't have any yesterday

Of course it's good to know about the past
You learn about yesterday
You must be careful of what you gonna choose
and you musn't do the same mistakes
But then you start to feel like a liar in fire
There's nothing like the good old days
You wanna kill your darlings to the pure ashes
and only thing you want is to obey

[CHORUS]

The human rights go cold in line,
you die then every day
You dare now your mother's days,
sitting on yesterday

She's gonna make you cry for your mile's end and
you step with joy into that faith
The faith that leads you nowhere, moving to the
night, moving to the end of the days

[CHORUS]
