The dozens always live, when thousands will die
12 will never run, the fast way to cloud nine

The clock's moving around in me
with never reaching anything
Am I just a part of this "number thing"?

[CHORUS:]
See my 16 secrets is better than the 12
in a dozen. In The Universum Hardware
it's just a man's invention to put us to the frame
I'm more into the secrets which keep us insane

12 always in a dozen, too many thoughts are frozen
But what is the truth that lies, behind "by-heart-taught" eyes

Some day when you're counting flips,
you'll be broken down to clips,
and no one can count on your tricks

[CHORUS:]
See my 16 secrets is better than the 12
in a dozen. In The Universum Hardware
this 12 doesn't tell me anything
It's just to cause your mind to spin

If I unveil your eyes, will you cut my head off? [x2]

[CHORUS:]
See my 16 secrets is better than the 12
in a dozen. In The Universum Hardware
we're just put to the mathematchic square
Step one number away and you'll lose your pair

13 in a dose... 13 in a dozen... 13 overdose...
are you 13 in a doze-n?

Unveil my eyes, and cut my head off!!! [x2]
