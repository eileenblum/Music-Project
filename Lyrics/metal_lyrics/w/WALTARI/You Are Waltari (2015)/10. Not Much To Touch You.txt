Life is sometimes cruel, it doesn't count on who you are
Life will keep you balanced with your doings after dark
Do you want to come to my krypta and place your body for sale?
Love and lust won't lead to same, they have different trails

Not much to touch you, I wouldn't even speak
Louder as my voice I hear my fullbumping heartbeat
You're so attractive, it's so hard to refuse,
but sometimes it'd be better to keep myself tight off you

Not much to touch you...

You're already waiting for me so hot, can you feel?
I would like to like you til it's over...
High off the ground you would like to lose my mind
Wanna use you till the sky will open like a sign!

Not much to touch you, I wouldn't even speak
Louder as my voice I hear my fullbumping heartbeat
Let's dance and wallow towards the kingdom come
till the brightness comes to the eye, and make my stiff feet run!

Not much to touch you...
