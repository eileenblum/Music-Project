So scruff your eyes and ears and sharpen your sense
It's time now for a duel, for a fight immense
It's difficult to let our human feelings go,
and this dead end won't make us grow

Your greedy needs don't see the inside,
and soon you'll be bitten by your own mind
Choose the story that you wanna hear,
but you are living on the edge, your final end is near!

[CHORUS:]
It's a killing machine
The major danger singularity
This is what you don't see:
You break the rules of humanity

You're offered now the gift of eternal life,
eternal power, luxury life divine
But the gamble of life waits for you to pick the card
Alive or dead? Let's pick up alive

[CHORUS 2:]
It's a killing machine
The major danger singularity
This is what you don't see:
Your friends are turning to your enemies

Sneaking now behind your back,
all the time ready to attack
I know, it's 'bout the power of man,
which I can listen to but don't understand!

[RAP:]
We're walking down a treacherous path
as human soul is parallelled with math
Enchance the cognitive abilities
all hail the mighty transhumanist breed
Solder the wires of abomination
Feed the suicidal fixation
Open the gates to the future wire zone
Replace the thoughts with algorithmic code
Hear the screams of a dying race
only to be drowned by dystopian praise
Harness of power of the gods
in exchange of surrendering your flesh and blood
Shivering thoughts and blackened grim vistas
Brother against brother, sister against sister
Apocalyptic terror takes over my mind
as I glance into the future with lifeless eyes

[CHORUS 2]

Sneaking now behind your back, ail the time ready to attack
All I know, it's 'bout the power of man, which
...DON'T WANNA LISTEN TO, DON'T WANNA UNDERSTAND!!

Grinded it all and cried for help in this nowhere cell
I know there is some light somewhere, I want to see it again!
There is no meaning in all this, there is no more fun!
We cannot give anything no more, we just play the game!
