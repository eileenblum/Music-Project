Why I have to take all the risks,
that you leave me to breed?
Why it's all about taking risk?
Coz nothing's solid

[CHORUS:]
Keep it alive, only life can say goodbye
Keep it alive, and alive you'll stay
Keep it at low, and alone you will stay
Keep it alive, only life can say goodbye
Keep it alive, and alive you'll be saved
Keep it at low, and alone you will stay

Why you're watching me all the time?
Why you're so worried?
If you let me have, what is mine,
please don't feel sorry

Jumpin' back and forth the scene
Visualize the day between
I'd like to lay it back,
but you'll always stab my back
I'd just need some time in peace,
then I'll rest, which is to ease
You'll die, if you can't find no time,
no time to really recover!

[CHORUS 2:]
Keep it alive, only life can say goodbye
Keep it alive, and alive you'll stay
Keep it at low, and alone you will stay
Keep it alive, only life can say goodbye
Keep it alive, and alive you'll be saved
Keep it at low, and you're done, alone!

[CHORUS 1 x2]

Jumpin' back and forth the scene
Visualize the days between
I'd like to lay it back,
but you'll always stab my back
Jumpin' back and forth the scene
Visualize the days between
You'll die, if you can't find no time,
no time to really recover!
