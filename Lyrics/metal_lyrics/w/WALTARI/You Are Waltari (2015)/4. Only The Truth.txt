Holy Jamboree!!

I'm not a criminal, but still impossible
I'm jumping out of rat race and don't give a fuck 'bout pace
I'm now sick of your dates, a calendar full of rage
Somewhere the sun is looming, wiping out the deep and doomy

[CHORUS:]
What you see is only true
(open wider panorama, shining around, act bananas)
What you see is only true
(super papu, tichuraku, bagha magoo, rocky raccoon...)
What you see is only true

I know the principle, we must stay critical
The feelings must be doubtful, never tend to turn this page
Now jumpin' out this cage and then become enganged
turning the natural page we'll survive and never worry

[CHORUS:]
What you see is only true
(open wider panorama, shining around, act bananas)
What you see is only true

Reaching out for the fresh, the real sound of life
Jumping out from the speed, searching for life's real pattern

Shot by too many too's
and soon you'll crawl insane
So close to leave in vain,
instead of being

[CHORUS:]
What you see is only true
(open wider panorama, shining around, act bananas)
What you see is only true
(super papu, tichuraku, bagha magoo, rocky raccoon...)
What you see is only true
