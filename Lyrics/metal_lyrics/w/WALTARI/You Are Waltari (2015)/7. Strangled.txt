I failed again!

Don't you know that I have no fair pair
Big brother is watching me, stalking in the air
Don't you know, I have strangled myself
Big brother is watching me, vibrating in the air

I must learn, I must,
coz I still love everyone...

I failed again!
I failed coz I practice what I preach

Don't you see how I weep next to you?
Are you so much wasted that you're running thru the sphere?
Don't you feel how I'm 'bout to burst thru?
You are just dreaming of your dirty business too

Soon I'll do something to myself...

I failed again!

Spread your nicest trick, place your widey smile,
I HAVE now NO, have no place to hide
Spread your nicest trick, place your widey smile,
I have no place to hide!
Spread your nicest trick, place your widey smile,
I HAVE now NO, have no place to hide
Spread your nicest trick, place your widey smile,
I have now no place!

I, don't feel, no guilt, but Iâm strangled!
You follow me now everywhere.
Thank me coz I failed again!
