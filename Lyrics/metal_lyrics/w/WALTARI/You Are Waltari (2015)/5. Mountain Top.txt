Get the fuck out now of your boogie-woogie
Kiss my ass with your old school tutti frutti
Now it's time to rip you out to play
Better be kicked off! Right ya?

Madness creeps into your past mind (hoochie coochie!)
makes your head explode to the hilt.
Your nervous system is about to tilt.
The final time now to climb out!

I'm alive!

[CHORUS:]
Head on, you mountain top!
Head on to the mountain top! [x3]
Head On! Tomorrow you can reach the top, so KICK IN!

I'll head on just to prove I'm not your honey-bunny
Life is risky and you are not funny
Get on to the moon, head like a hole
Desolation mind's dying!

Underestimation is pilipali
Shoot yourself as a new messiah,
like the world, to critisize itself!
Climb onto the highest mountain!

I'm alive!

[CHORUS 2:]
Head on, you mountain top!
Head on to the mountain top! [x4]
Taste the mud and do not cry
One step forward, two behind
Some day you will reach the top
The day when all profane be stopped!
Head on, you mountain top!
Head on to the mountain top!
Head On! Tomorrow you can reach the top, so KICK IN!

Fight the power, dumb out all your bodyguards!
Don't stop!!
Fight the power, dumb out all your bodyguards!

[CHORUS 3:]
Head on, you mountain top!
Head on to the mountain top! [x4]
Grip the wall with your fingertips
Beat yourself out of your brims
Taste the mud and do not plead
Climb ahead, do not give in
Head on, you mountain top!
Head on to the mountain top!
Head On! Please to meet you, it's 24-7...
