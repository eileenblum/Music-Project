[RAP:]
The grave is overfilled by falling ashes
Immortal crime against the life that now passes
The heart is getting tired in everlasting night drive
Watching you drying is a pretty bad jive
The march on the corner for the pigs in jail
Wanting to bring the real justice back against the lies that fill up to your head
Just fake purity and not TRANQUALITY

Not any credibility... Hail hail
Just a march for the kingdom of the dead!

[RAP 2:]
Your seeking's just plastic
You're just crying to act more drastic
but your real aim is just to keep mastering
First Human God, but still end up in a grave

[CHORUS:]
Crying for pride but the shadow's in
Bored to people therapying
like the flies round the brain
(WATCH YOUR MEGA MAD DOG FAGGOT RAGGED IN THE RAIN!)

[RAP 3:]
Cried for the crime with no moral in a rhyme
The path to the cemetary is waiting on a line
Watching in a park when you're sinking to the ground,
waiting for your friend to join the shroud
So overcynical and bloody in sin
the nature describes how to end to dustbin
But sure you are willing to choose this shift?
Sure you ainât willing to take such a risk

[CHORUS:]
Crying for pride but the shadow's in
Bored to people therapying
The highest mountain you're climbing (Watch the waves of the water...)
For the freedom struggling
Crying for pride but the shadow's in (Breathe the clean crispy air...)
Bored to people therapying
like the flies round your skin (Feel the loss...)

I'd like to take you away,
show the other way
Why you waste your day
in an endless game?

[CHORUS:]
Crying for pride but the shadow's in... (Watch the waves of the water...)
Bored to people therapying
The highest mountain you're climbing (Breathe the clean crispy air...)
For the freedom struggling
