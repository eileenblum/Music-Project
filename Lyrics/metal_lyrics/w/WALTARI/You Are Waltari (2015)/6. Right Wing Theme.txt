So didn't I tell you that this crap is hell?
Good good good we're all going down so well
Living for wealth is never going to sell
So we just skip that, and yell

I did never thought it all will end like this
Good good good, the method is hit or miss
Shit hits the ground and we are all too bricks
Good good good soon we all will rest in peace

[CHORUS:]
World will be destroyed and everyone will die
Nothing seems to matter, we only wanna cry
Never understand a word and what you wanna tell
Coz in the end it's always a straight forward road to hell..lallalaa

Should we go to gym or should we just get drunk?
Doesn't matter, soon we all get spanked
Are you telling me, you're not able to survive??
Soon you'll be happy, coz you're not alive!

[CHORUS 2:]
World will be destroyed and everyone will die
Nothing seems to matter, we only wanna cry
Finally we'll get rid of this so called "Promised Landâ
No one here to blame, coz no one understands

This is such a cold world and we're sick and tired of life
Everybody stinks, not least your hard coldblooded wife
Still you raise more bloody flags under the blood red sun
Doctor's orders: Subutex, will make your stiff feet run
Hoochie Coochie man has come!

[CHORUS 1,2,1]

This is the way we live, this is the Right Wing Theme!
