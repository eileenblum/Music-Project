Drug is a rebellion
But see how it burns your brain
So sad song, sad song
You thought you knew much of life
But Society is your wife
So sad song, sad song
Lost in luxury haze thought it seems to be
That your music's still free
You lie in your grave and you trust yourself
But drying is the way it looks like
HEY HEY HEY (don't leave me no more)...
Death is a rebellion
But see how it burns your skin
So sad song, sad song
Every day you're closer to your exit door
Take care that you find your best way to shine
Let's not live a sad song no more!
[Repeat verse 2]
HEY HEY HEY (don't leave me no more)...
