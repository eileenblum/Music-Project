[Music by Parviainen-Hatakka- Waltari]

The thought sword, that cuts you down
The make up, that jerks you up
Colors that burn your skin
The wildest adventure
(not black and white)

I WANNA BE YOUR COLOR TV

Pictures
Comunication
I'm your best devil, not any stability

I WANNA BE YOUR COLOR TV

Hypnotized
You are alone, sitting in the dark corner watching me

I WANNA BE YOUR COLOR TV
