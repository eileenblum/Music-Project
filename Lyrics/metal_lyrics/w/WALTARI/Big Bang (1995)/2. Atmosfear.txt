[Music by Hatakka-Waltari]

Billions and billions in this world
Always try to find out what's the word
Instead of learning instead of
Yearning they fuck their brains out
The heads are burning
I took a long trip far away
Could I really find myself
'a new day'? Silent people with silent
faces easy to fill empty spaces

Atmosfear

The old town bored me!
Wonder if this place has something
else nice miles, but behind the scene
I feel passion and cruelty... mean!
I'm sorry to disturb you
Maybe it's too early to live this
Though I feel Im' a bitch
Like I'd steal your time
But I have to work this out
So is it a crime?

What am I doing here?
Won't you tell me the quickest way to a miracle!
What am I doing here?
Is this the atmosphere that I feel?
Is this the atmosfear?
Is this the atmosphere that I need?
Is this the atmosfear?

GO!

I'm a warrior but I have no soul
I'm easier, but I aint bold
I cry all my thoughts to the deepest
Hole and hide my bad seeds in my soul
Like drifting in the timeless haze
baby I'm looking for my place
around these people with silent faces
it's not so easy to reach new spaces

I know, moment's not right
feeling all too tight, please release me!
Show me the way out
I can't find my own shout
Please release

"What am I doing here, what am I doing here? I wanna leave this place"

What am I doing here?
Won't you tell me the quickest way to a miracle!
What am I doing here?
Is this the atmosphere that I feel?
Is this the atmosfear?
What am I doing here?
Won't you tell me the quickest way to a miracle!
What am I doing here?
Is this the atmosphere that I feel?
Is this the atmosfear?
Is this the atmosphere that I need?
Is this the atmosfear?
