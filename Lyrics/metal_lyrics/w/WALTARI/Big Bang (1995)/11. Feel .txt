[Music by Hatakka-Waltari]

I am free to do whatever I want to
I am free to soar like a bird
I don't live for this society
Only depression of the minds I see

You're my soul salvation!

Take me to your different world
Take me to the unknown of this life

You feel the passion and you kill your pain
You see the light, the death is all the same
You don't need the nations and you don't need rights
You leave your history of endless fights

You're my soul salvation
(look at me, look at me, I'm flying on the street...)

FEEL! FEEL!
FEEL! FEEL!
You're my soul, like a bomb and today we run!
Soul salvation!
FEEL! FEEL!
FEEL! FEEL!

Don't you know that you are very small
But this world is big and this world is tall
Your life can't be decided by this mess
You just have to shake away your stress

You're my soul salvation
(look at me, look at me, I'm flying on the street...)
You're my soul, like a bomb and today we run!
Soul salvation!
