[Music by Hatakka-Waltari]

I'm waiting...
I'll wait till the morning comes

Do the emotion! Do it now!
(I'm watching all that madness but I'm searching for the rel one!)
Do the fast emotion! Let it out!
(I force myself through the noicy croud to the light
that's flashing really wild!)

I'm waiting...
I'll wait till the morning comes
I'm searching,
searching for Music Force

Do the fast emotion! Do it right!
(I'm standing outside the City mess I'm waiting for the people...)
Find the motivation! Find it now!
(I'm crawling like heavy worm on the disco floor of real love)

I'm waiting...
I'll wait till the morning comes
I'm riding...
Riding the nedless night
Do the fast emotion! Do it now!
(I'm seeking like a lunatic for appearance of our real love!)
Find the motivation! Find it now!
(I'm watching all that madness but I'm searching for the real Bang!!!)
