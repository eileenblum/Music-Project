[Music Hatakka-Waltari]

My stolen moments try to reach me here on my ice
You know it's slippery there
a psycho exciting connection
Waves from your eyes
You're blowing it onwards
and I realize the whole size of my logical brain
a psycho connection
with something that comes from outside

[Chorus:]
Oh, I make belive
connection in the dark could release
Oh, I'd like to feel
The echo of your distant breeze

I feel you dancing,
while my hearthbeat's starting to grow
now I see something in there
the distance
The future in front of me coming here
As a feature instead
My hands are shaking and my whole body's telling:
bevare of the darkness
you are nobody now
the unknow surround me,
the waves are filling me in...
now I'm the Power of Life

[Chorus:]
Oh, I make belive
connection in the dark could release
Oh, I'd like to feel some power
coming trought your leaves
Oh, I make belive
The echo of your distant breeze
Oh, I'd like to feel...
but there's ice on my mind
It's frozen and it's hard to see it!

Gotta pile it up, gotta pile it up
All the things in my head
I fight the best I can and I realize
The whole size of your killing breath
Now I have to know, now I have to care
it's only me and you
We share this pain and we face ourself in the dark
Thoight there is ice on the road (let's go!)

[Chorus:]
Oh, I make belive
connection in the dark could release
Oh, I'd like to feel
The echo of your distant breeze
Oh, I make belive
connection in the dark could release
Oh, but sometimes I feel
that we never ever wanna,
we never ever dare to see it!
