[Music by Hatakka-Lehtinen-Waltari]

Wake up, shake up yourself to the road
it's an endless one, so forget your code
just shoot, inside you there's a machine
gun your bullets are tough,
have a hot foot run
you don't need no peanuts or little
mistakes they'll give you bad feelings,
they'll give you heartache
just trust yourself wherever you go
'coz your heart always knows
what you got to show

I don't need no money, I dont need routine
it's just a waste of time, I'll be ugly and mean
I wanna "run the Sun" while doing my thing
the gift I got when I was as small as a pin
the smoggy air is just killing my breath
murdering the nation,
'coz there's no more health
people are lazy, just sitting in their cars
I'd prefer to feel free and walk on the mars

[Chorus:]
I don't need nothing but a real life
(I'm your rainy day!)
I just need some time to groove
I dont need nothing but a real luck
(I'm your rainy day!)
to lean on my destiny

Just shoot, inside you there is a machine gun!
Just shoot, inside you there is a machine gun!
(Killing the breath!..)
Just shoot, inside you there is a machine gun!

[Chorus:]
I don't need nothing but a real life
(I'm your rainy day!)
I just need some time to groove
I dont need nothing but a real luck
(I'm your rainy day!)
to lean on my destiny
(I need some time to go)

I don't need nothing but a real life
(I'm your rainy day!)
I just need some time to go
I dont need nothing but a real luck
(I'm your rainy day!)
to lean on my destiny
TRAVEL FAR AND NEVER STOP!
