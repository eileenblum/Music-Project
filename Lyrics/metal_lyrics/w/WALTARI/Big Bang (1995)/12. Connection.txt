[Music by Hatakka-Waltari]

Connection, what's the matter with you baby
Connection don't explain, don't need your "maybe"

I wanna feel your head
but please, do let me go
you've got nothing to show
I wanna leave this place
if you are on the way
to hell with misery

Connection, sure I need the breath of danger
Connection but sometimes I feel you are a stranger

I wanna feel your head
I'd like to see your mind
but you are locked inside

You wanna stay in-bed
alone with just yourself
to become nothing else

You wanna hide-away
maybe you're "fater's son"
the connection is gone
you never pass it on
you shitty lunatic
your place: another brick

Spectric, electric lightinig, atomic
feeling I'm here to burn
facing, atomic feeling
I don't like hiding, I wanna learn

Connection, only speaks when I am sleeping
Connection, tell your story 'till I am weeping

Spectric, electric lightinig, atomic
feeling I'm here to burn
facing, atomic feeling
I don't like hiding, I wanna learn

Reeling, your brains have feeling
you are returning into your shell
silence, sometimes like violence
nothing is moving - stability!

Connection, what's the matter with you baby
Connection, don't explain, don't need your "maybe"
Connection, what's the matter with you baby
Connection, what's the color today, babe?
