[Music Hatakka-Yli-Sirnio-Waltari]

Living so eek trying to reach the peek
living is so ooh someone's knocking on the door:
SHOWTIME!

Buzz of conversation reaches my deaf ears
can I hear anything? All I can hear is dim:
SHOWTIME!

Why, why should I cry, I feel so high
We don't wanna try, we can touch the sky

Now it starts to crumble
reality isn't here
space is full of colors
restless moving spheres:
SHOWTIME!
