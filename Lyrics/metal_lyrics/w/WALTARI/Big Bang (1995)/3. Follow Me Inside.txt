[Music by Hatakka-Yli-Sirnio-Waltari]

I ask you to follow me inside,
I have so much power to give to you
there's a space inside me for you babe,
you'll never know what happens
when I'm open to you

I want you to follow me inside
you'll never know what happens
when there's nothing to do
but you are afraid
you think twise - too much
I wink my eyes and smile,
that's what I'm offering to you

You ask me to follow you outside,
you'll never know what happens
when there's some game to play
You say: "please, please, kiss me quick it dosn't make you
a man if you just sit and wait"
You beg: "jump into bed, come on fill the empty spaces"
(o.k.) alright, party around!
There is nothing really special for us too soon

You see my dark side, coming closer
to me but love is brightness
I see no fear when you are near me

Tonite...
I know what I'm feeling
I'm feeling inside
Tonite...
I know what I'm feeling,
I'm feeling inside!

I ask you to follow me inside,
I have so much power to give to you
there's a space inside me to share,
you'll never know what happens
when I'm open to you

You beg: "jump into bed, come on fill the empty spaces"
(o.k.) alright, party around!
I say farewell, there's nothing to do

You see my dark side, coming closer
to me but love is brightness
I see no fear when you are near me

Tonite...
I know what I'm feeling
I'm feeling inside
Toninte...
I know what I'm feeling,
I'm feeling inside!
