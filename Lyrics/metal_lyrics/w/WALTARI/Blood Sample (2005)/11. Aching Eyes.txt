Aching eyes of busted mind wearing disguise
Gate number 9 is ready to swallow the pride

Aching eyes, the distant time measures height
A flight to Bonn, it's still yesterday's nightless night

The endless pain is hurting chest, it's hard to breathe
One can't find any place to fall in sleep

Aching eyes!

It's so mean with naked lies of losing life
Like a tramp, the fake smile without no fireside
