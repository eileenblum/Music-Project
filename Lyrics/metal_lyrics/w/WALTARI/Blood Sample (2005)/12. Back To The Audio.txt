He's got a delicate sound, he knows how to roll the stones
He's walking like a thunder where ever he goes
Everybody admires him with full respect
Longing for his great sound that the crowd will beg

Now it's time to climb back in and put out the tune
And no chance to come out  'fore next day noon
It's time to get buried and create the beast
With a number one hit you leave the net in peace

back to the audio  back to the studio  back to the audio

(I made with a beastie a deal)

The machine is on, it is time to press play
while his girl calls asking him to come home again
He'll put out a tune with pure flesh and blood
spending five days in a studio in a row

back to the audio  back to the audio  back to the studio
back to the audio  back to the studio  back to the audio
back to the audio  back to the audio  back to the studio
back to the audio  back to the studio  back to the audio

He's such a lovely guy
(with all the promises he makes)
He's such a lovely guy
(He tends to live his feelings all alone)
He's such a lovely guy
(He'd walk beside her if he could)
He's such a lovely guy
(A master of the fantasy of truth)

He's really obsessed with
this rhythm that flows thru his instincts
This rhythm won't leave him in peace
before he will get it for me

(I made with a beastie a deal)

He puts out all his senses
and sets up in his mind, all his fences
He has to be closed to get connected in..to
the phrase of the universe, the mind within

(I made with a beastie a deal)

back to the audio  back to the studio  back to the audio

He's such a lovely guy
(No-one can see what he is missing)
He's such a lovely guy
(He tends to live his feelings all alone)
He's such a lovely guy
(He'd walk beside her if he could)
He's such a lovely guy
(He has to fill his duty all alone)

(I made with a beastie a deal)

Everybody admires him and his odd life
and his absence makes his girl only dream about being a lovelylovely wife
These days of creating are making him wait in, fainting,
painting his tireness to his wonderwall
Can't you understand, they need more...
The long distance call in a studio hall...
Why the walls are so fuckin' tall?
