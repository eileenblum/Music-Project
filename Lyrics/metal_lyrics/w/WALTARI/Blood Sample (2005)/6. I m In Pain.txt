I sold my soul to my yesterday
I never feel I could pass thru another day
Will it come and make feel that I could heal
my wounds so deep and stop my weeping?
Like the dove that washes away the pain
give me trust for life and dries the hard vain
and never learns how to keep the ghosts away

Every day I'm a machine gun
Every day I'm sentenced to run
I could still my thirst having fun
but it rolls the cycle, long gone
I'm in love, it feels good,
but it fails in the hazy summer
I need warmth to stay true

Wish it was like yesterday
I'm afraid of another day
I don't like in here today
I'm in pain (I'm in pain)

I will try to survive, what else can I
making love to the cactus's spine
Trying to smile while I hide in my mind
Nice, I will try to turn on my human kind
Every day there's some nice sunshine
Every day there's some moody candle light
In the dark night there's a spider
climbing in my mind, trying to see the sign

Every day I'm a machine gun
Every day I'm sentenced to run
I could still my thirst having fun
but it rolls the cycle, long gone
I'm in love, it feels good,
but it fails in the hazy summer
I'll leave my life to you

Wish it was like yesterday
I'm afraid of another day
I don't like in here today
I'm in pain (love in vain)

"Stop your mind snoaring. Wake up! Shake up yourself!
Eat the fat, break the crap, in the name of consciousness..
Wake up! Shake up yourself!
Wake up! Shake up yourself!
Eat the fat, break the crap, in the name of consciousness..
Let the pain off your soul"

Wish it was like yesterday
I'm afraid of another day
I don't like in here today
I'm in pain (I'm in pain)
Wish it was like yesterday
I'm afraid of another day
I don't like in here today
I'm in pain (love in vain)
Love in vain..
