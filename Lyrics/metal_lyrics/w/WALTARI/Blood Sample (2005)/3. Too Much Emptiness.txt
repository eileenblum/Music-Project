A way down honey...
It's all my fault
The Music's loud an' never stop...an' it's me!
Face the music, face the style
That's the way I will decide...coz it's me!

(A way down honey...) Too much emptiness
(A way down honey...) Too much loneliness
(A way down honey...) Too much emptiness!

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
She gets, she gets too much emptiness!

A way down honey...
A way down, fast...
A young boy's thoughts could never last
Attack the system and hug its waste
This is the drying, your mind's death taste

(A way down honey...) Too much emptiness
(A way down honey...) Too much loneliness
(A way down honey...) Too much emptiness!

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
She gets, she gets TOO MUCH EMPTINESS!
