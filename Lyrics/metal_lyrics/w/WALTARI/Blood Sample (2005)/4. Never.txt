Here I am, Lost And Found
I can't see that I'm so proud
Could have made so much more
Could have paid back with my back straight
Now  I'm just a half of me
Am I happy? Sure, I should be!
There's no need to disagree
thou I could have stood with my back straight

I never got an answer from you baby
I never get an answer from you now
I never got an answer from you baby
why can't we feel free together!

The scene is highly civilized
It breeds like kids on merchandise
Could have paid so much more
Could have paid back with my back straight
Now I have everything I need
but physically, not mentally
Nothing's happening right now
I don't feel I stand with my back straight

I never got an answer from you baby (won't ever let you use me)
I never get an answer from you now (won't ever be your slave)
I never got an answer from you baby (won't let you rule over me)
why can't we feel free together!

The fantasies from my memories raising like the beast, praying on your knees.
Praying on your knees, the relief raising like the beast from my memories.
The fantasies from my memories raising like the beast, praying on your knees.
Praying on your knees, the relief raising like the beast from my memories.

I never got an answer from you baby
I never get an answer from you now
I never got an answer from you baby
why can't we feel free together!
I never got an answer from you baby (won't ever let you use me)
I never get an answer from you now (won't ever be your slave)
I never got an answer from you baby (won't let you rule over me)
Why can't we be free together!
