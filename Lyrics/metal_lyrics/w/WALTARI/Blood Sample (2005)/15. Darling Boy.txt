A solid later day, about to go insane
Should I feel the greed to tell you what I need?
Another bit of you, I wanna be like you
Youâll show me what to do, what I never needed to
No matter if Iâm sad, no matter if youâre bad
Iâm blessed to walk with you, I will obay your rules
Your light will shine on thru, Iâm blessed to share it too
And now weâre ready for our heavenly loveâ¦

I would be your little darling
I would be your little darling
I would be your little darling boy

If thereâs a storm around, I have to stop it now
There wonât be any harm, if I will just stay calm
Sometimes Iâm feeling sad, because Iâm feeling bad
Itâs very strange to be a kid who disagrees
It all depends on me, I am the one who bleeds
Why I feel so bad, donât have to be like that
I just have too warm blood, it makes my mind flood
I should be ready for our heavenly loveâ¦

I would be your little darling
I would be your little darling
I would be your little darling boy

You wonât be around, this conversation is over
Will have to go for you, I wonât stir up your soup

What is your conscience about? Right now Iâm bursting outâ¦
What is your conscience about? Right now Iâm bursting outâ¦
What is your word for a rainy day? What is your soul?
What is your mankind? What is your blood?
What is your blood?
Show it, for Christ sake!
What is your blood?

â¦And now weâre ready for our heavenly loveâ¦

I would be your little darling
I would be your little darling
I would be your little darling boy

What is your blood? Show it, for Christ sake!
What is your word for a rainy day?
What is your blood? What is your blood?
