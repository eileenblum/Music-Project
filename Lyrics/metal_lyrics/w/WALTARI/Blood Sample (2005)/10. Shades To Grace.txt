The world is the stage where we used to live
You live as deep as it makes you
You die as hard as it brakes you

So pull up the curtains and let it show
Now the spots are pointed on you
Then play the part and leave soon

The act is over from today
So wipe your powdered mask away
Release your deathly pale face
from shades to grace
The act is over from today
Itâs time to find the exit way
Release your deathly pale face
from shades to grace

From bright light to shade this part will lead
and all the time they watch you
thou canât get close or touch you

We all are the actors on this stage
ready to turn the new page
Take care, xou wonât be forgotten in rage

The act is over from today
So wipe your powdered mask away
Release your deathly pale face
from shades to grace
The act is over from today
Youâll see you have to get away
Release your deathly pale face
from shades to grace

The world is the stage where we used to live
You live as deep as it makes youâ¦

The act is over from today
So wipe your powdered mask away
Release your deathly pale face
from shades to grace
The act is over from today
Itâs time to find the exit way
Release your deathly pale face
from shades to grace
