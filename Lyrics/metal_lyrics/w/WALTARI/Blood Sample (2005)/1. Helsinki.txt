"Tuuli on kylmÃ¤
Tuuli puhaltaa taukoamatta

Sade piiskaantuu ihoon ja lihaksiin pureutuu viima.
MissÃ¤ oot kulta?
Kaipaan lÃ¤mpÃ¶Ã¤s nyt lauantaina
Kun vain tuijotan tuoppiini, lÃ¤mpimÃ¤n katseesi siellÃ¤ nÃ¤Ã¤n."

Watching the sky, watching the shining river
Watching the fields, wild as the wind blows
Watching the sun, behind the dark cloudy weather
as it whispers in your ear, that this world has a fear

"Kiire on aina
Baarin ikkunaan tuijotan
Vihaiset ihmiset viistÃ¤vÃ¤t kaukainen katse kasvoillaan.
MissÃ¤ oot ystÃ¤vÃ¤?
Jossain kaukana maailmalla
Kuljen kauppatorin rantaan, kÃ¤Ã¤nnÃ¤n katseeni merelle pÃ¤in."

Travelling around with my hometown on my mind
I think âbout my friends with a frown on the face

Remember the sky, watching the shining river
Watching the fields, wild as the wind blows
Watching the sun, behind the dark cloudy weather
How they could carry on, with their black minds
I would ask them to move away, out from the ice

Helsinki on my mind!
Rainy days, the disgrace!

It was a long time ago
since I saw the sunshine in your helo
Been trying to escape those lies:
"Darkness inside my simple mind"
Now this foaming pint keeps me warm
As it fades the memories into this swamp
-The grey day when i was left alone,
in this foggy hometown: Sorrow

Watching the sky, watching the shining river
Watching the fields, wild as the wind blows
Watching the sun, behind the dark cloudy weather
How they could carry on with that black in their minds?
â¦as it whispers in your ear, that this world has a fearâ¦
(â¦ as Iâve been fading my past, as it blows thru my songâ¦)
