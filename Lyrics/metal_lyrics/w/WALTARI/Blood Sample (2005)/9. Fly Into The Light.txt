You're what? So what!
You're pretending that you're not,
so hot that I'll burn my fingers!
Am I ready for this black vision track
like an alcoholic moustache grey body singers?
Is it true that the blue vision kills my thrills
for the need of smoking my dope?
One more Jean-Paul Piccadilly free style,
and I'll be ready for a valium shot!

I'll keep on flying into the light
I'll keep on playing like untamed!

Say what (so what), kill city kills hot (if not)
and will spot your pretty face
I won't, I shan't, like a cunt, in a sewer speculate
this nice human race
Big boys, lazer toys, women of a lazer choise,
natives of urban city disgrace
Play the game, let 'em tame your fellows,
your personal route will be made fastpaced

I'll keep on flying into the light
I'll keep on playing like untamed!

You're a taker like me,
with peace using power to the people
your own benefit will last
Madness of the humiliation
pass this kinky ass, shaking an ass, walking on glass

You're what? So what!
You're pretending that you're not
so hot that I'll burn my fingers!
Am I ready for this black vision track
like an alcoholic moustache grey body singers?

I'll keep on flying into the light
I'll keep on playing like untamed!
