I live together with jesus
My heaven at home is so gorgeous
I know she'll always be waiting
When cooking she's eternally smiling

But when the lights of my office've been turned out,
I will give it up
The sweet danger in the dark...

I'll never get enough love
I'll never get enough love (The sirens, don't call)

I can't help it, I am addicted
to those thousand jobs always blowing
Those bodies will make me inventive...
I've been surfing to find them intensive

And when the lights of my office've been turned out,
I will give it up
...when seeing those legs in the dark...

I'll never get enough love
I'll never get enough love

I can't get enough!
