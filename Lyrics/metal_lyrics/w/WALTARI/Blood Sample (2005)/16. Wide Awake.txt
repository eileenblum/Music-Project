Wide awake full of faith and destiny
Am I safe?
You're away
The red wine makes me fall into sleep
I'm awake
I can't sleep coz I'm worrying again
Wide awake
With passion I build up my world

Every day having espresso in a cafe
I ride
Where I ride I don't really know
It's inside
It's inside but outside it's also nice

I seek for adventures, to go very far
Further than distance, with my Jaguar

Wish I could see myself
Wish I could pray for us today
The stories are for kids,
but this is pure reality, just like you, just like me
An old lady sits in a corner
with some wisdom on her face
She has a long story to tell,
an ugly life with full discrace...on her face

Wide awake
I know there's always a way
Anyway,
I need to see all the cards of fate
I sway
by the beauty of the shores of Seine
I'm insane
It's inside but outside it's also nice

I always come back, and I always leave,
looking for something, wish I could be healed

Wish I could see myself
Wish I could pray for us today
The stories are for kids,
but this is pure reality, just like you, just like me
An old lady sits in a corner
with some wisdom on her face
She has a long story to tell,
an ugly life with full discrace...on her face

Wide awake,
let me stay...
