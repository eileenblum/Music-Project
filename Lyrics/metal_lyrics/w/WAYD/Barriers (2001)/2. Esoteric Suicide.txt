When the sun goes down
And the light has gone
And breath has stopped
You know what's been done

No smile left, no tear was wept
Yes, no need to read what's dead
Just another why is closed
And how may there have left

Strange or nice - two ways of doom
Walking along my grave with you
But I don't wanna wait for the moment
The moment when you bring a noose

Biting worm inside
Slowly choking on what he ate
Hands hidden in your heart
Fallen angels stealthy fates
