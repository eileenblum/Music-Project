You're living in dust
and dirt of this world
You're longing so much
To achieve something good
You know you're right
Nothing lasts forever
There ain't much time
Lost again another fall
And nothing remains behind you
Just everlasting war
A deceived child standing alone on the shore
You feel misery, lack of faith
anger with everyone
Just step the hunt, no power left
You've told yourself - put up with it
You let things slide
Tryin' your best so far
It's too hard to make up
for lost time and start
Start again to watch the world
behind the window apart
You're staring through blind eyes
at the dead sky
See yourself standing alone on the shore
A rough sea in front of you
No chance to break it anymore
You'll find your face deep in sand
You feel misery...
