With the darker steams I'm flowing
Right inside your veins
As I get into your breath
You're reaching on the hands

Our own hell creators
Our own heaven dictators
Shining when we're dying
Screaming when we dance

Fade to fade as reality has changed
Burst out, cracked up, confronted
Side by side challenging life
Unheard voices flying through time
