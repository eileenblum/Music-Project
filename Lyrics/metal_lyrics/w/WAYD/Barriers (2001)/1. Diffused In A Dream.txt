Hey, enchanter, hold on - what are you asking for?
Is it my life? - or do you want more?

My smile was thrilling through my fingers
Non- you found it on your lips

Would you like to step nearer to me?
Shall I nod to you carelessly?
You see, it's deep inside of you and me
Taking it out is the touch of death

Diffused in a dream
My laugh makes your eyes blind to see
New roses for all those who arrived
New hearts, new beasts and solemn bride
So what about the sense of fullness?
One of the freezing delicateness of fear

Maybe, I'd be diffused in a dream
And you'll find the splinters you don't understand
Are you afraid of your own tears?
Is it hard? It seems not easy to bear

Diffused...

Hold your breath again
Close your eyes &amp; feel your sweaty lips
Shine your hours to the land of screams

I will overflow you with a pale rainbow
I will cut the half of your dream
I will paint red your wall of laments
Let the play of light begin

Hey enchanter...
