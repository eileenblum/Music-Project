I saw you in a different time
Decking a corner - place to hide
Your rhythm has changed, it's hard to see
These stains on your soul revealed

Bleeding fists can't find peace
You sell your dreams reflecting tears
Time will heal &amp; find the truth
Tasting frost that made you burn

Choking on the fear you feel
Shaking with your scream beneath
A fortune-teller of your own life
Non-, extremes in you are mine
