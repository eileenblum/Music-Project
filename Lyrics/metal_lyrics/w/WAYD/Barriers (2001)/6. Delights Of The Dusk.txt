Shadows of your smiles beneath
Dancing mists I want to seal
Heal the wounds that make us weak
Yes, there's no peace for me to feel

Taste the underwater kiss
It's a dream you're gonna miss
Cold eyes free breath
The way down &amp; turning back

To find the feeling I've lost
To say what I really want
To see the last light from the stars
Diving into the sweetness of dark

My mind is bursting out
My mouth's shut, it realized
My heart forgot all doubts
My brain has been left behind
