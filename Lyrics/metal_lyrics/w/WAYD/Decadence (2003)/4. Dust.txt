[music: WAYD/ Lyrics: D. Jurik]

so youÂ´ve come to the end of nothing
sittinÂ´, satrinÂ´, bleedinÂ´, blind
dust is covering your eyes
and your sun is going down
black-thin line through all the years
makes you feel like a men who wants to believe
in our dreams weÂ´ve chased the sun &amp; paid the price
thereÂ´s no place left for us in poised paradise

tryinÂ´to find what takes your breath
without fear only we can fly
if you hold your promise before i die
and world- your world is closed inside

your dust filled my veins
weÂ´re shamans on our own graves
when blue tears are falling
we all be running out of flames
my tired eyes must learn to stare
and the dark cold rain brings me back for life again
when the blue tears are falling
we all be burning out of flames

tryinÂ´to find what takes your breath
without fear only we can fly
if you hold your promise before i die
and world- your world is closed inside

tryinÂ´..............

tryinÂ´..............

tryinÂ´..............

so, youÂ´ve come...
