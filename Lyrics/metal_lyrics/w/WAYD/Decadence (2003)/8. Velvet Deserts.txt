[music: WAYD/lyrics: D.Jurik]

pieces of memory and mind,
relief and pride, pleasure &amp; pain
virtue &amp; vice

whenever iÂ´m dreaming
dissapointment pulls me down
the vision of previous day
is dreadful and wild
so i sometimes make mistakes
experienceÂ´s cruel
but nothing has changed
iÂ´m just thinking over now

pieces of memory and mind
relief and pride, pleasure and pain
virtue and vice

whenever iÂ´m dreaming....

pieces...
