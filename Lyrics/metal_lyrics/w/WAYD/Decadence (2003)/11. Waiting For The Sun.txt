[music: WAYD/lyrics: D. Jurik]

where no one breathes &amp; no one cares
all you can feel is cold embrace
like a frozen tears canÂ´t flow away
Â´m trapped in here canÂ´t feel the pain

iÂ´m waiting for the sun, weÂ´re waiting for the sun
when things are come undone, weÂ´re waiting for the sun
iÂ´m waiting....

like a frozen tears canÂ´t flow away
Â´m trapped in here canÂ´t feel the pain
like a frozen tears canÂ´t flow away
iÂ´m stuck in here canÂ´t get away

please stay with me - come, enter my dreams
hear time just passing by, let your emotions never die
iÂ´m trapped in my dreams, iÂ´m waiting for the sun
in the chessboard of existence, the final move i mine

where no one breathes &amp; no one cares
all you can feel is cold embrace
all you can feel is cold embrace

iÂ´m waiting for the sun, weÂ´re waiting for the sun
when things are come undone, weÂ´re waiting for the sun
iÂ´m waiting....
