[music: WAYD/ lyrics: D.Jurik]

i forget the fatal mistakes
that destroyed my emotions
all i see is darkness
&amp; bitter taste of existence

i lose the way in my mind
finding no escape out
tryinÂ´to reshape reality
iÂ´ll never make up for lost time

burning, screaming, lost in your mind
falling, turning, searching, for the light
for so many years youÂ´ve been rotting deep
inside
youÂ´re only one to free yourself tonight
