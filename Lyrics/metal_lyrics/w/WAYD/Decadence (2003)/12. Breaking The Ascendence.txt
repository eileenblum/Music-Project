[music: WAYD, lyrics: D.Jurik]

iÂ´m breaking the ascendence
as  you go as you try to say my name
iÂ´m crawling out of my hell
as i rise above my pain

itÂ´s the same as always
where thereÂ´s nothing to lose
you put yourself into things
but itÅ just half of you

unable to transcend
or touch the other side
youÂ´re prisoner of your own
of your own vicious lies

tearinÂ´ apart the chains that bound me
i rediscover the darker side needinÂ´ light
i can feel the scent inside of me
flyinÂ´high within, high on my strongest vibe

unable.....

iÂ´m breaking....
