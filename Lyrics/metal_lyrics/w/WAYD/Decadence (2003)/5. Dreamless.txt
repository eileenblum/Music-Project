[music: WAYD/ lyrics: M. Gonda]

i went sad no because i canÂ´t feel joy
not for there wasnÂ´t reason for
i went sad but for i canÂ´t see the hope

i went sad...

it was lying in the corner
litle &amp; trembling the future was dead
it was lying in the corner
and i canÂ´t make change

i can change myself
i can change you
but i canÂ´t change the monster with 1000 hands
thousands legs &amp; only one mind
a lots of strings hanging from the sky
just a puppet, who holding it?

i left you dreamless
