[music: WAYD/ Lyrics: D. Jurik]

paralysed dreams haunt the night
our thoughts behind so surreal
seven ways to die
and only one to stay alive

dark blood, cold veins, and only laughter remains

weÂ´re twisting hand in hand
together in decadence

paralysed dreams...

itÂ´s time to lose control, itÂ´s time to dance
itÂ´s time for decadence
itÂ´s time to lose control, itÂ´s time to dance
itÂ´s time for decadence

dust on your lips tastes so sweet
comfortable death i can hear

sofisticated walls shades the light
n chance to stop or left behind

weÂ´re twisting hand in hand
tegether in decadence

letÂ´s try to make it right tonight
we donÂ´t wanna die
dancing on the shores of fire
weÂ´re gonna taste lithium light

itÂ´s time to lose control...

ethereal dancing, raindrops are falling down
confusing my senses, Â´m wandering through fields of light

sophisticated walls shade the light
no chance to stop or left behind

dark blood, cold veins, and only laughter remains

weÂ´re twisting hand in hand
together in decadence

paralysed dreams...
