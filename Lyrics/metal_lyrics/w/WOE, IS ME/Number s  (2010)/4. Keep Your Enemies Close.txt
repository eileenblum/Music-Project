Hindsight is my only flaw
Right after we fail it's easy to realize the things we've lost
Push comes to shove, their only excuse is we do it out of love

There we flee trying to please everyone that we see fit for the trifold
Behind everything, inside we choose to hide
Because we have the sense to do this for the sake of pride
Business aside

Modest, we condescend, while you're looking up reaching for my hand
Now tell me, who's the bigger man
Never take your sight of these trophies in the light
Because the thieves of the swell will try to steal our thunder
Expect all is well but they're holding us under
When all we have, is all we know
We've tasted flight, we will forever move this earth

I'd like to thank the devil inside for slamming so many doors
But I thank God for opening so many more

I hold the key to your teeth that preach those crooked words
So hold your tongue before I, rip it out.
