[Featuring Jonny Craig of Emarosa]Stop!
I stand here as a man who holds his ground, 
So silence your hands, 
I'm everything you once held dear.

How can you sleep

How can you sleep at night,
Too many you were rights, 
I have no home, 
My home is non-existent
So long, 
I was here but you missed it, 
So kiss this, 
I hope you know you pissed it away.

So cut me out, 
Just knock me down, 
Lifeless I may feel, 
And I'm slowly finding out, 
Life is full of bitter things
I won't shed a tear even if it stings, 
Hit the road my spirit and all my clothes, 
Who am I, 
Who the hell knows.

Tie my words, 
Around your neck, 
Never forget.
Listen, 
For I've walked the path of men, 
I've stood my ground, 
I've earned my crown,
And this is where it ends.

I will hold their hands, 
I will walk across this sea 
They've stood behind me, 
And they'll follow me till death.

Never speak to me like you are some kind, 
Of hidden prodigy you're wasting my time
You will never make it in this world, 
It's all in your mind.
Well that's ok with me I think I'll be fine, 
I don't need a shitty home to be on top of the line,
This interstate is making me the prime, 
Example of what it means to follow your dreams

So watch.
