You've taken all my will to
Exploit my face behind these hands
And you're far to shallow to drown me in your follies
You wont make it far, this is bigger than who we are
How could you get this far, with such a bitter plan, building all these scars
Just go ahead, pull us out, to sea, relapse to what you were
Such a commodity for you and me to be lost at sea, 
You drug me out here but honestly,
I can sleep and preach much better now, in the clear, 
You are not to keen, on your current positions

You're to far out to swim your way in, 
You're to far out to swim your way [2x]
Now that I'm back to where I started, 
Drifting out against the oceans speed, 
These waves will take you farther, into the deep

And I said, that this is the end, the end 
(Let's both be honest, this is the end)
Pause, fold, contort, all your friends, 
They fell short and sold you out

You're to far out, to swim you're way in, 
You're to far out, to swim your way [2x]
When all is said, and done, 
We face the problems we thought would never come,
These treacheries, will claim you. 
I feel your hands inside of me.
