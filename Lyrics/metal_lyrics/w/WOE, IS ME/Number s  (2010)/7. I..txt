Timid, broken loner this ghost town, 
And it drained the hate from his mind, 
Now there's nothing left inside

Rumors, and lies, are all you've got, they're all you've got
Mother , Father, where have you been, I needed you

What have we become, mere shadows, standing alone, inside and out, 
This incarceration is tearing me down [2x]
Oh have I become a mere shadow standing alone, inside I cry out, 
Screaming I make no sound

Screams, he finds, I'm the one who haunts her dreams.
Her life torn at the seams, I'm the one who haunts her.
