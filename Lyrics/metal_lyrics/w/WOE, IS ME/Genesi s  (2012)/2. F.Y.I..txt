With the devil on my back
And God in my heart
I used the hands that built you up
To fucking rip you apart

You turned their whole world upside down
And filled heads with doubt
But thereâs just one small thing you forgot about
That on the other side of heaven
Thereâs always a hell
And thatâs one fucking place I know all too well

So Iâll pick up a pen
And from beginning to end
Iâll write the three words we will defend:
Follow your dreams
Go!

Donât give in
To all the lies that they fed you
And everything they said about me
Just to deceive you
So let me ask you
Why would I give a fuck?

So sit back, enjoy the show
Thereâs just a few things I think you should know
Like how your sticks and stones
Wonât break these bones
Or seize the throne
Because Iâm the man of steel

So before you place the blame on anyone else
Why donât you take a step back and fucking start with yourself?
We never gave up
We never gave in
We never gave up on you
So donât give up on me!
