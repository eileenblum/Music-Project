Did you honestly think for a second we played our final song?
In spite of those who disagree, you know it feels damn good to prove you wrong!
Singing oh whoa, we did it somehow
And oh whoa, itâs our turn now
Weâll shut you down; youâll drown like the rest of them
Need I remind you?
That youâre up against the best of them!

So let me promise you this
With ignorance as your bliss, your name wonât ever be missed when we are through with this
Iâll be the thought thatâs in the back of your head
Weâll be the monsters hiding under your bed
Iâll make you pay for all the things that you said
Use your own line to cut off your fucking head!

I thought I told you once that you reap what you sow
But I guess this time around Iâll say I told you so
Now that was clever
But let me make this clear
We are coming for you
We are coming for you!

Tell me why
They painted us with guilt
They said that weâre not good enough
The only thing weâre guilty of is never giving up
So take a second glance and put yourself into these shoes
We got a second chance and weâve got nothing left to lose
So keep singing, oh whoa, whoa
Oh whoa, whoa
So keep singing!
Take a second glance and put yourself into these shoes
We got a second chance and weâve got nothing left to lose
