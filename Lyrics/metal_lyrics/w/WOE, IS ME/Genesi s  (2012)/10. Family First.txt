No one ever said that you had to face this on your own.
Just do your best, forget the rest, you're stronger than you know;
So let it all go.
Don't dwell on all the things that you can't change,
'Cause we are stronger, oh, we're so much stronger than we know.

One by one you gave up hope and you prayed to God that I would choke,
But I paid no mind to your attack because empty words can never hold me back.

Every dream begins with a dreamer,
We have a hope we must defend.
No matter what, we'll come out swinging,
We haven't reached the end.

Every dream begins with a dreamer,
We have a hope we must defend.
No matter what, we'll come out swinging,
We haven't reached the end.

Just know you're not alone, we'll always be your home.
So never give up hope and know you're not alone;
And you don't have to face this on your own
We said that we would live forever-
Well you laughed instead, you said we're dead.
So get this through your head,
I've got one more left.
You better be ready to bring us your worst,
This army is our family, oh, this is our family, and family comes first.

Every dream begins with a dreamer,
We have a hope we must defend.
No matter what, we'll come out swinging.
We haven't reached the end.

Every dream begins with a dreamer,
We have a hope we must defend.
No matter what, we'll come out swinging.
We haven't reached the end.
