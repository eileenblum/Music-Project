I breeze as but a spirit uninterrupted, to consent with the Hallifalations Behrathas, Aehnkantos. "I stand before you a fleshless temple from Xzorian with the last talisman, capable of the destruction of Uraitahn. You are more than familiar with our compromise. I've taken apart myself to suit you, now just bring me to my eyes." "Give us the talisman! We've transferred more than you deserve. Eternal life to a doltish man is nothing we've been known to do." The seal inside this marionette has quickly come to wither. My last chance at mortality is to devastate these poisoned lands. "Ohrelae untai, ohrelae." The haze within their eyes begins to solidify. Light attempts to breach the sky. The steaming ground begins to break like a thirsting mouth to swallow up their lives.

[Solo: Vail]

The seal inside this marionette has quickly come to wither. I must depart this broken shell to join the translucent. Uraitahn is but a wasteland.
