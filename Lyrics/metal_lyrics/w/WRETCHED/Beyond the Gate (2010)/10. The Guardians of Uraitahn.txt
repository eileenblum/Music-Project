In a distant realm where body and soul divide: "We are the Hallifalacious, the guardians of this whole. In this realm where mortality capitulates, we'll feed for eons upon your temple."
Behrathas, Aehnkantos, cease to deplete from this consumption. Welcoming in all thriving flesh. Become ethereal to wander through Uraitahn. Welcome to Uraitahn, the path between your vale and Shamballa. Become ethereal. Carry on.

[Solo: Funderburk]

Deep within the bowels of the Hallifalacious' waste, the fulcrum of a practiced past emanates within my mind's eye. Escape from eternity is borned in my essence. The key to the light is with the guardians. A compensation of legendary dimensions. "Here in Uraitahn, the path between my vale and Shamballa, I have become ethereal. I will bring you the last talisman."
