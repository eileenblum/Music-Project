I can see that you're not ready for this. But I've waited for
chaos since childhood my friend. And my life has all been a miss.
What happens when things just keep going?

When the tides all subside &amp; the fire is weak,
And the world still exists in American bliss,
It's time to let go. You're moments from death and all you
worry about is your politics.

Who caused the rapture?
Who brought this on?
(I did)

Would you have done it differently, (of Course)
I will accept this as, a natural couse,
Embrace the eye witness; I've seen this dream,
I'm so happy to be the last man standing...
(I'm so happy to be the last)

I could have done more...
Since my breaking point...

I could have done more, since my breaking point, I have
fallen to crutches. All as the stellar sunset of evolution,
drips down my home
