The dawn has come to put your queries aside, I see doom
in the skeptical minds, Sucked into this world, of imminent
growth, That's soon to expand till the dead line the coast,

It seems to me...

We're fearing God's wrath when it, Is our own, No horse-men, just
our species, to lay waste to our homes A civil death, a chivalry
war, Panic like the vermin you bank with, It ends in a thought, not a bang.

[Lead: Vail]

It'll happen one day coming, not in ways that you'll conceive, Not
seven plagues, this internal hatred bleeds...

Behold the wasteland, it breathes. This is oblivion...mans way.Â Â  [x2]

Our politicians will never know a sacrifice, And revolt is the unspoken way
to begin it all, I'm asking who are you... I am Anonymous. I'm asking who are you...
I am Anonymous.

It seems to me...

[Solo: Vail]

And it won't sneak up and be painless, So i will wait with a fistful of patience,
And anger exceeding my wildest beliefs, This day means more to me...

It seems to me...
