This instinct was handed from serpents to thieves and priests 
Feed off their own; destroy their homes
In search of conquering their pride 
Spine is ripped out, any vertebrae of ethics is in dismay 
Survival; how great it is and howâd you get it? 
Itâs obvious death comes, aside from your wealth, stature and healthcare 
Power is why a human lives, while every organism just is
Malevolence molesting the systems of life
Annihilate ourselves, impacting all those to come 

A step backwards, with nuclear arms
Weâre wild with greed 
Scarred by political charm 
Depreciating with excess force
Protesting with only an unarmed voice

Tools of a trade are tossed for the fancy life
Led by the embalmed and blind 
Someone take my spine before itâs lost
Give me fire and a blade to last 
Iâve broken down sensitive eyes
To frost over those who wonât grasp their lives

Push!
No need for the stampeding
Human sized but making paths that have an impact 
The game then connects from traveling
Without each pollination
We are unraveling
Sand blast battered with molten rock
Weâve evolved to be soft
The few will live and gorge on flesh; 
No animal without fangs is feared 

Filed down
Down to stubs
Filed down
When we are young 
Destroying all learning, label it a phase
To be forgotten, not knowing hunger pains
Filed down
When we are young
