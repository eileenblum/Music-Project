Thrust your razor nails into my chest and spin 
Sling blood in a circular pattern; the carcass is battered 
Rowing through a sea of savages, men left in ruin 
Is this what you would call torture growing into a man? 
...Sling....Sling 

Into my flesh, she carved a hollow, heart will be raw 
Into my flesh, I search for something sweet just for your tongue 
She smiles with innocence, dancing with silence, feasting on every last inch of my pride 
Soulless, black eyes 

Shocking the mess that followed my dull knife
Just a puddle, just a puddle of piss 
Shocking the mess that followed my dull knife
Just a puddle, just a puddle of piss 

Starved me of the simplest things, it is of no cause 
I will do what need 
Cut the throat of the beast
The color is unexpected 
Intriguing my throat
Fill it up, down it goes 
Shocking the mess that followed my dull knife
Just a puddle, just a puddle of piss
Shocking the mess that followed my dull knife
Just a puddle, just a puddle of piss
