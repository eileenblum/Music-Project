Give the sacrifice to the flies
The one who burns
Feeding me and feed the crowd 
Thatâs our tomb of cold and rotting wombs 
Thatâs your network when at work 
When at work
Life is void of body language
Instinct must consume you, it must confuse 
Thatâs our tomb of cold and rotting wombs 
Thatâs our network when at work
When at work 

Clawed and scratched their way, biting through the next rat
Save its own neck, snake consuming snake
Danger culminates in them doing business with another 
Loss of self-awareness, no sense of warm blood 
To feel a conscience at all 
Clawed and scratched their way, biting through the next rat
Save its own neck, snake consuming snake
Danger culminates

Gnawing at the bone, hopeful for its marrow 
A thousand rats crowded at my back
Jealous and left with a hungry taste in malnourished mouths
Everyone is hungry
We watch our peers, just to see when they fail; a vulture whose habits canât have it 
We watch our peers, just to see when they fail, a vulture whose habits wonât have it
Failure!
Pressure stacks against a city of camels and bricks
Whether I like it or not, I am alone in this 
Live with the dead and decaying, I rot as they rot 
A viral plague of toxic nostrils, breathe out your violence 
Pressure stacks against this city of camels and bricks 
Breathe out your toxic nostrils; breathe out your violence 

Muzzle covered in intangible filth, instant guilt
A status so emotional
Evolved, single only interested in 
My stomach filled and lungs are full of smoke 
Muzzle covered in filth, insistent guilt
A pistol lays before me and I am broke 
Just another Cannibal
Gnawing at the bone

Clawed and scratched their way, biting through the next rat
Save its own neck, snake consuming snake
Danger culminates in them doing business with another 
Loss of self-awareness, no sense of warm blood 
Clawed and scratched their way, biting through the next rat
Save its own neck, snake consuming snake, danger culminates
