Open your head, gagging, barfing alone in the house! 
Orange bottles spilling hate from their mouths! 
Work! Working my bones down to powdered dust
I see gold held above me, like power, like filthy lust 
The garbage, the putrid need for success
Trophies for my desperate life and my lonely death
Leave these things be
Orange bottles spilling uninformed bile from their mouths! 
Working my bone
I see gold held above me, like power, like lust.
