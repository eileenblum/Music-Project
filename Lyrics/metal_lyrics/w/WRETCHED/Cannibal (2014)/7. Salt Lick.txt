Reaching for another sedative, I want to find eternal sleep
Weâve grown so far apart, Iâm in quiet hell 
As your back rests next to mine 
Daydream of smothering your breaths 
Perfection, persistence
The experience of new breasts

Shallow surface value, we passed this long ago 
Shallow surface value, trust and betrayal that is stopping our growth 

Stopping our growth, destroy our home
Her desperate stare had no soul 
Lust is petrified of the fear of loneliness
Bleach your skin and start to remove the fat 
Put it back, into your lips, dye your hair and starve yourself 
Covered in graffiti, you might fit in when your tattoos are healing
Fuck image, fuck your body
Consuming yourself for yourself, thinking of no one else 

Donât let her decide your death
Companions for decades all ending in webs 
Poison the camel, queen is my home
Never another, ripe with resent 
Poison the camel; Iâm lost with resent
Weeks before we explode, Iâll reach you yet
Reaching for a joint, some mescaline 
Sheâs poisoning Winston so Charlotteâs my home. 
Blank expression on the floor, waiting for my presence 
She speaks in truth splattered flame, starts wars to be wed 
Marred and intoxicated, the last thing I swallow
Iâve wandered off, gotten lost and asked for God 
Often bothered souls are bought in whole 
Often bothered souls are bought in whole by demons 
Rot away, let it spoil 

Shallow surface value
Weâve crossed this long ago 
Shallow surface value
Trust and betrayal that is stopping our growth 
Stopping our growth destroys our home 
Your desperate stare had no soul
Lust is petrified of the fear of loneliness
