This human breed is far too tame and thinks that itâs one of a kind 
My compassion is dying, needs antibiotics, advancing rapidly 
Socialized to the teeth, but never in person we meet
On a digital interface, slowly with time our limbs are rendered useless
Just a trunk, towering, high and dotted 
High and dotted with fingertips 
One orifice for all activities; one chamber for any intelligence 
All emotion will be under scrutinous watch

Chemicals will let us feel and the feeling is toxic 
Chemicals will let us feel and the feeling is toxic 

Constant fucking noise! Conjure the silence
Itâs awkward just like my first taste of beer 
Composition of our bodies collide, and the flesh sours breeding new milk
New pools to fester, new drool to record
Our exit is unpredictable, throwing these seeds to the wind
