My manic world collides
With the day your head spins questions 
Hurled right to my side
Frantic! Desperate, for a song to hide 
I, I just need a pause
Body feeds itself
Iâm eating basic meat to sustain the dayâs work 
Nicotine and weed to fuel the next shift

In need of changes
Physical rearrangement

Tossed the vile, but more restricted
Truthâs dead I will always be addicted
Tossed the vile, but more restricted
Truthâs dead I will always be addicted

I grow weary of, weary of my phone; if I open it I cannot escape the anxiety!
I grow weary of, weary of my phone; if I open it I cannot escape the anxiety!

Trivial but true, parasite of the brain
Draining my body
Draining my body of its dirty blood

Calls, questions and incoming mail 
My future, my present and the end of the world
My fix and cigarette, my song and band
Son, daughter, sister, suicide
Second chance at life
Blame!
This blame is rampant!
Obsessions of all kinds 
Obsessions of all kinds
This blame is rampant!
Your brain was so simple, flipped off with a snap 
Iâm reading you wrong, neckâs hard to grasp
