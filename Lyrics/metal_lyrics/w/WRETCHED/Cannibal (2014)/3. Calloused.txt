Artists watching artist, watch each other for the flag 
One shot into the air! 
Before we race to stab each otherâs backs
Will you climb the ranks? 
Weâre all staring towards a sun of gold 
Without an inkling of what it is or what itâs worth 
Just instinct to succeed
Can I shock you? 
I doubt it, youâre jaded 
Can I create the songs that I want?
Two generations fight for attention
Made of pure oil, nothing but standards 
For us to live by 
There shouldnât be a waste of time

Busy yourself, learn a trade
And conquer this before your corpse is gone 
Feeding shit into the ground
In hopes that the forest will grow

Producing copies of copies
Until the pepper is not tasted
The bite is totally gone 
The bite is gone 

Gossip, it all starts from the mouth
Of a crooked traveling act 
Naive to the fact that music has no place for egos

From the mouth
Filth spills out 

No angel lives, his presence is missed 
Tripp, you still speak to me 
No angel lives, their presence is missed
Tripp, you still speak to me! 
Enraged those comments exist
Words from anonymous, soon youâre exposed 
Enraged that those comments exist
Iâll hunt you down, when karma is void
