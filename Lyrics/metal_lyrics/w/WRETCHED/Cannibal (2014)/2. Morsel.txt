Just let me taste! 
Explosion of my curiosity 
I look for what human remains in you 
Opening your head and reaching in
I jump inside the driverâs side and drive 

Begin removal 
Superior excitement when I remove the eyelid 
Begin removal 
The god youâve chosen to be present, begin to feast. 

Lungs of a devil beast, superior excitement, the flesh of a devil queen 
Lungs of a devil beast, superior excitement, the flesh of a devil queen 
Just a morsel, just a touch, a desperate fucking monster, gulping blood in angry thrusts 
Just a morsel, just a touch, a desperate fucking monster, gulping blood in angry thrusts

We are just a void of we are pointless voids of 
Filthy!
Iris captured
Light will erupt inside my gut 
Your contacts stare back as I throw them up
Light erupts
Scorn for my interests in tasting the world 
Broke every limb with a twist, I only wish
To understand and fix her 
Dissection of the specimen
In my domain, not begging for much
Just the chance to cut 
To feel a humanâs warmth
Swift escape 

Begin removal
Superior excitement, when I remove the eyelid 
Begin removal
The god youâve chosen to be present, begin to feast 
Begin removal
Superior excitement, when I remove the eyelid
Begin removal 
The god youâve chosen to be present, begin to feast
