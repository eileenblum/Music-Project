Lo, here I've fallen with my claws deep in your back.
And with a surly swing, I'll collapse your neck.
I've waded through barren nights, procuring latent sins, without overwhelming myself in such shallow standards.
Lust in patience is beginning to hollow my very core.
Through the thick of the trees I can sense her emotional aura.
Envisioning the waltzing daughter gliding with vacancy.
Consequently this embellishes a feeling I've held in seclusion for an eternal perpetuity.

[Lead: Funderburk]

Amidst the sky is where I lie, biding my time in the still of night.
Bidding to catch a glimpse of your gleaming face, uncontrollably I am sweeping towards you without a sound.
Distress begins beating through your chest as you awake helpless.
Clutching onto such a porous glance, I can taste you on my lips.
I must justify myself to you through gnashing teeth, with the rest of my hidden from your eyes for your succor.

[Solo: Moore]
[Solo: Funderburk]

Whole and swinging in this sanctuary from her feet.
Lust in patience is beginning to diminish in the air, as we breed.
I can see that you're reclusive, with me inside of you tonight.
Tears dripping down your beautiful face just disgust me deeply.
There is nothing more that I can do.
You know of me and I can't have you.
If I cannot possess you, this sacrifice will suffice.
