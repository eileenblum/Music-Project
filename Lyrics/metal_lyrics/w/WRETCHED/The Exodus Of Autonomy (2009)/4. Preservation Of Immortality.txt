Here at the break of dawn, I wait secluded from occurrences that stand foretold.
Hesitation devastates me, while the reek of you empowers me to defy my immortal humanity.
So set in stone with these rulings, I can't deceive my father's regulations.
No matter what the lure, I must hold back my strength.
I mustn't bear my teeth.
Inflicting my infectious persuasion to create a wall between us, only failing.
I have but one alternative.
I must exclude myself from the torture of your fragrances.
Wallowing in my hopelessness of self-control amidst your presence.
Fled through the forest in an instant, to take refuge with the genus in the north.
I must salvage myself.

Here, at the break of dawn, the weeks have passed as days.
My blackened eyes grow weary.
To concede that the words of the prognosticate are truly set, to be an entry into eternity anew.
My hungry eyes shift from black back to gold, as I give myself vigor to face my future.
