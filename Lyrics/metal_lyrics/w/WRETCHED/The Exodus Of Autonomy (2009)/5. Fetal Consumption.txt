Shaking hands with his left.
Giving you his filthy ring to lay your courageous virgin lips upon.
Feeling so unworthy in this holy matrimony between a brother and a sister.
Caligula said, "Drusilla, we will bring on the fall of this Roman empire."
Caligula and Drusilla conceived a child upon this erection forced by Zeus to bring a destined dawn.
I will guide my hands inside, to desecrate your uterine walls.
So serene is the second that the heartbeat failed God.

[Solo: Funderburk]

I slipped past the guard.
I carried her remains through the fortress like a thief in the night.
Squandering all the promises you made to me, with the blood of our child.
Wake my love.
Where did your luster fade down these desolate paths of our fate?
I cannot revert to a soul bent on sanity, where the walls of my life corroded onto me.
I will guide my hands inside, to desecrate your uterine walls.
So harmonious was the second that the heartbeat fell with God.
