Swept myself away, from the troublesome future I have bestowed upon you.
Cast myself away, from the grips of your demise.
Waiting impatiently for this insufferable pain to subside.
As I walk these barren lands to hide my insecurities, I confide in nothing.
The nourishment won't take me far away from the constant memoirs of you.
Waiting impatiently, for this unbearable thirst to subside.
Ripping through the branches as I sink my teeth into flesh.
Drawing life from the slow (from the weak), sustaining myself.
I cannot withstand a lack of procreating life within the barrage you're allowing through your gates.
Our fold remains to be alleviated.
Swallow the pride of the stand that has forced itself through this brace.
Condemn this need (the wanting; the crave) that dispossesses me of my absence.
I am so loving.
I can be gentle.

Now the sun is streaming pathways that lead against my will, where it's revealed that this was my gravest mistake.
What they told me was erroneous.
What they told me was that you had left this world.
Waiting impatiently for this insufferable pain to subside.
I'll take these legs into a lair of unending flame.
