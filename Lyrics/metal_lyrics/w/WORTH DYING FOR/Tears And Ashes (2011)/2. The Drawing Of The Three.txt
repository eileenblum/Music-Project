Doors standing in the sand
Pathways to worlds I don't know
And then we were, torn asunder
Shadows and light you and I

A thief then a beggar
A liar then a king
He's fucked up in his mind

Black aura on the cards I read
Of your future, of your disease
With great expectation I speak
Of the Drawing of the Three

Coming forward
From two places in time
Falling backwards
One body, two minds

Looking through a shattered mirror
This face that I don't know
Draws me back to the Midworld

Planets and stars, galaxies collide
Portals are opened and I see the light
And the dunes and the endless sea

Black aura on the cards I read
Of your future, of your disease
With great expectation I speak
Of the Drawing of the Three

A thief then a beggar
A liar then a king
He's fucked up in his mind
