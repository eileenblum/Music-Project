The air around you is clenching my throat so tight
So blissful the revelation / poisonous is the salvation

Bonded by the weakest ties of blood
You're a threat for all those you've cared for

Accepting the memories and then they're unclean
Your death would be a bargain I'd be willing to break

Never the one to partake in the efforts we have made
To keep our heads above the foul waters of dismay

I couldn't even fucking cry when I was told you might die
The taste of blood is so sweet when I taste it off the edge of a knife

No closure in sight, this part of me has died
I've written this story without an end
