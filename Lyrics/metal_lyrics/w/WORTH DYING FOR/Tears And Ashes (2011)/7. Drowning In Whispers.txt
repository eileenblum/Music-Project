Somewhere deep within
The prisoner's trying to regret
But he is unaware that Death overlooks with a blackened stare

Waking up, drenched in sweat
I cry (we cry) I'm reaching for air
Was this a wicked dream
Or a reflection of my reality

Cause you're a fucking disaster
And no one is searching for a way to end my nightmare
Cause you're a fucking monster
Everyone seeks to get you trapped in front of their crosshairs

There's frost in the windows I'm burning with fever
It's driving me insane
There are ghosts in the shadows watching you, brother
I'll help you get rid of this pain

Dying alone inside this lonely cage
I'm drowning in whispers
Staring at the walls of this hollow lair
I'm drowning in my fucking whispers

Imagination is endless / suicide is painless
Delusions brought me under
My finger's pulling the trigger

It won't be forever
This tearing asunder
Delusions brought me under
My finger's pulling the trigger

My world turns to black
