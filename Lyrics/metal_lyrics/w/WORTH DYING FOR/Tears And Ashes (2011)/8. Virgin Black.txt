I can hear her cries from within the pyre
Untold words pierce the conflagration

Running through the trees she knows she has brought many men under her tombstone
Her phantom runs forever so
I loved her more than you'll ever know

And burn she will as we can't keep on going like this
When opposites attract, one takes the fall to avoid the worst
Engraving one last spell under the town hall
Let's make sure this witchhunt will be one they'll remember

Running through the trees she knows she has brought many men under her tombstone
Her phantom runs forever so
I loved her more than you'll ever know

Running through the trees, she goes
She taught me a curse worthy of tombstones
Her venom runs forever so
She will hurt you more than you'll never know
