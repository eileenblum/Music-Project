Twisting and turning
in my bed every night that I dream
of a demonic twin
Who tells me that I'll kill people in the name of our saviour

He tells me in all honesty
Destiny's a complex machine
But I think even the angels can't withstand
My pain and the blood that's in my hands

I'm waking up to hear them mourning
Singing in unison the angels's song / The killing sound
Could be heard all the way to heaven
And straight back to hell

We won't be left behind
With a single word we surrender our lives

To remember the scorn and those words they would say
The tears overflowing I can't stop thinking
Your life's slowly fading away
With one last whisper we merge with the grey

Locked out from the world in a real-life purgatory

We won't be left behind
With a single word we surrender our lives
We won't be left behind
A barrier of sound is claiming our lives
