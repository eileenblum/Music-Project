I was second-to-none
He trusted me with his life and all his secrets
I was by his side on this night when he told me
I had to burn Germany down to the ground and leave nothing for them to find
Nothing to see but dust and ashes

I am completely unable
To bear with their sufferings
I knew that we were responsible
But I just didn't want to see it

Tens of thousands on the Zeppelinfield
Chanting loud and clear
The glories of our slaughters
Bathed in a symphony of searchlights

Was all that was on our minds back in the time
Was the good or the bad way no one could say

But the record will show
There has been redemption in the darkness
The powers I've harnessed
The truth I confess
But not on my knees

Let it be known for history's sake
That I stood proud here today
That I stood proud as a man repentant for his actions

I am completely unable
To bear with their sufferings
I knew that we were responsible
But I just didn't want to see it
