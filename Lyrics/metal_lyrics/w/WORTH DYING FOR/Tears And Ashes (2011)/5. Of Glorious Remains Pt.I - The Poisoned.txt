Coming in a new day with fright
I take place under the faint lights
The pain is real, empty I feel
As they take me away

I am begging for forgiveness
I've been asking for truthfulness
They've got something against me
Something I can not see

I feel the poison flowing
In my veins slowly burning
My spirit is quickly fading
I feel the reaper coming

I feel the poison flowing
In my veins slowly burning
My spirit is quickly fading
I feel the reaper breathing

I feel the fire, I feel the flames
I'll be reborn from my glorious remains

We are the ones who will judge
We are united within the system
We are the corrupted
We feed on the demise of the innocent

Am I really nothing ?
Am I really dying ?

Without no flaws, without no laws
We stand before their freedom
Without no flaws, without no laws
We live beyond their freedom

Am I really nothing ?
Am I really dying ?

I feel the poison flowing
In my veins slowly burning
My spirit is quickly fading
I feel the reaper coming

I feel the poison flowing
In my veins slowly burning
My spirit is quickly fading
I feel the reaper breathing
