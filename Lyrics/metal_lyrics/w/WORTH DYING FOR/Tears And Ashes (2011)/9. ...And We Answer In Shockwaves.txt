With subtlety we divide the good from the bad
We've never been this close before
To unite with the stars on top of their silver towers
They had stolen salvation when it meant they kill their own

At the center of this controlled chaos
The truth lies so deep, inexorable

Dead to the world, parallel voices uniting
Epicenter of rebellions
Dead to the world, parallel voices uniting
Crossing paths with the enemy
Dead to the world parallel voices uniting with the voices of the damned

Without a cause to call our own
We lie on the fringe of desperation
Looking for clarity in all the wrong places
When they were riding the waves we created
