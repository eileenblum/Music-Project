Look up
This is reality
Last time I checked
I wish I were dead

Look down
This is reality
Last time I checked
I wish you were dead

The layers of disguise are piling up
The fire is long gone annihilated
I have come across the boundary
Of what used to be called the promise of a new dawn
I am about to break the curse
Break the curse

[2x]
If fact I'll pass it on to you
You animal

Sooner or later
We'll cease to be
Sooner or later
It'll cease to be

Same skies as ever
Same sonnets
Petrified glance circles through a bitter awakening
Time seems to stop
As butterfly sweat slides down my hips
This is reality
Last time I checked
I wish I were dead

Buried within a rusted soul
But there's a glimmer of hope though

Only this slight chance of salvation
Is darkened by the stench of your breath
Demons pondered on your fate for many moons
Now that the veil has been lifted
I would not linger if I were you

Then again
You should have known
You've been there

Tender reminiscence of a painful youth

Sooner or later
We'll cease to be
Sooner or later
It'll cease to be

Look up
This is reality
Last time I checked
I wish I were dead

Look down
This is reality
Last time I checked
I wish you were dead

Thin layers of hatred are piling up
Last time I checked
I wish you were dead

This is reality
A clock is ticking
A clock is ticking
A clock is ticking
