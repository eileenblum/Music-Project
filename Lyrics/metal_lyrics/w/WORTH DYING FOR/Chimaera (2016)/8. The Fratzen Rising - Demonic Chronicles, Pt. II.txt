Worship can be so cruel.
Then somebody else answeredâ¦; -âIf you trust in him, you must trust also in me!...â
The foundation of an hallucination which bloomed in her quietly.
Ironically, what was supposed to save Anna
is invaded by a strength far beyond that of its faith.
Itâs invading her fears , Itâs invading her prayers.
âBut donât let your heart be troubled,â they saidâ¦
âYou should trust in God,
so you must/ trust also in usâ¦â
Determined to release their child of her sufferings,
they call on to the Roman priests to practice
countless exorcisms, countless genuflexions.
The results were so sad;
demonic psychosis,
starved and exhausted,
in ends of energy to fight against â¦the exorcisms!?!?

Broken knees and exhaustionâ¦
their worship have killed her.
The more that we look of the power of Gods,
the more that we look of the power of the Devil â¦
But if the only real devils are the ones living in
the heart of people who believe in it...
What about God?
Please hear me God, I need to be saved â¦Iâm bleeding down, down on my knees.
over and overâ¦
