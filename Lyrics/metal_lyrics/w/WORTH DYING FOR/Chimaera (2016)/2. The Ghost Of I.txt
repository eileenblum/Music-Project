Crawling down my spine, and burning out my eyesâ¦
What is this fire coated aura thatâs turning my blood to ice!?!

Something grows deep inside, something that must die.
Itâs such a perfectly symmetrical design, apart of what is aliveâ¦

He breathes and feeds upon my will and dreams
My own true possession is becoming my own fierce obsession!

Most of the time he hides behind shadows, waiting!
And he knows me so well yeah, so fucking well!
He knows which way is the best to drag me down to hell
He knows which way is the best to put me down,
Put me deep down in hell!

The blackened clouds are covering our land,
As I start to look at the mirrorâ¦
All I can see is nothing but a shade
of what it used to be
Of what it used toâ¦.

â¦Something grows deep insideâ¦
Something that must die! The ghost of I!

Most of the time he hides behind shadows, waitingâ¦
A tricky predator that always strikes to kill.
So symmetrical in design!
He is the face of death!

Will I always be flying from dream to nightmare, on and on forever?

Forever flying from dreams to nightmares, am I lost in between..?
With demons hidden in the shadows, always watching me!
The only wayâs to Separate from reality,
Itâs to join space and time.
Be part of the symmetrical design.
And stand with the stars
till the end of timeâ¦.
Till the end of time.
