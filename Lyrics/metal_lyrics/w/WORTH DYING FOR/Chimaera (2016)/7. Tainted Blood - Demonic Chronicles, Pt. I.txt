There wasnât a better way to make it.
There wasnât a better path to follow

It was nothing less than a complete devotion;
"KEEP FAITH, AND PRAISE THE LORD!"
There wasnât another way (for her) to loveâ¦
No other way for her to love!

-"Bow down before your Masterâ¦", repeating to herself constantly.
-"Donât let your heart be troubled, you should trust in God.."
But now like everything is short-lived,
Anna was viciously struck by the grand disease.

Dumb and paralyzed,
her beloved Savior couldnât hear the prayers no moreâ¦
CANâT HEAR NO MORE!

Please hear me God, I need to be saved â¦
Iâm bleeding down, down on my knees.
