There was a time, I can clearly remember if one of us stumbledâ¦
We used to wash it all away, hanging out with friends and boozes, you knowâ¦

I thought it was just the same kind of shit againâ¦
I just canât believe what happened, you shouldâve waited for meâ¦
Iâve left some messages and you never answered backâ¦you seemed too far awayâ¦
I knocked at your door a plenty of times but youâre too far awayâ¦

Hoping to meet you back here againâ¦
Now all thatâs left is breathing in sulfur
While searching for the answer.

We knew that we had to be well prepared in anticipation of the storm to come.
We boarded up the windows, all together put in shelter.
But she took you by the hand and never came backâ¦
She took you by the hand and never came backâ¦
NEVER CAME BACK!

I wish I couldâve made it before you left.
Together breaking through, instead of letting go.
Could Iâve been strong enough to bear this burden?
At least I let you know, you were never aloneâ¦

I thought it was just the same kind of shit againâ¦
Just canât believe what happened..: you didnât wait for me!
Iâve left some messages and you never answered back ; you were too far away!
I knocked at your door a plenty of times but, you were gone awayâ¦
