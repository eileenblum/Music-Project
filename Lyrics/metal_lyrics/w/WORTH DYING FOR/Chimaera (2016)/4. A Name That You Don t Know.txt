A name that you don't know

I have a name that you don't know
That you'll never speak

All the words and every kiss
All the hungers or your heart
Hold not a wing aloft to fly
But tear them all apart

With every touch
With every careful stroke
In every flick of tongue on tongue

This in me awoke
The beast in me awoke

[2x]
I have a name that you don't know
That I will never share again

I am walking wounded
Unburdened by regret
So far away stranded with my tears
Still warm and wet
Remaining upright in the way before me
Always trying to hide the scars
Covered my a mask...
Oh, so my own

Dream that bear alone
The burden of despair
Tattered and torn
By the remorses of fatality

Dream that bear alone

I fall in kisses
Fall with worms
Fall from a grace
My own
And lie and cheat and speak untrue
As if her love I'd never known
As if her love I'd never known

With every touch
With every careful stroke
In every flick of tongue on tongue
