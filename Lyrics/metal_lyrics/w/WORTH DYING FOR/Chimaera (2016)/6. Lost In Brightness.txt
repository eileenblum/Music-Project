Once youâve crossed the line, itâs worse than teasing the cobra,
Itâs almost like whispering with the Devil.
In the first place, you get stunned, then start spiraling down.
Bewitched by her penance stare.
Frightened, you lose control, lost between earth and fire.

Where are we in duality? Why does it sound so clear to me?
A fist of fate knocked me out that day,
That I've never seen coming, so cruel!

Her charm can take the whole world, she can bring you back to life
By a single look into her eyes.
Her perfect silhouette is the ultimate inspiration...
An endless inspiration...

Through a blackened sky brimming with stars
Sheâs still the brightest of them all.
