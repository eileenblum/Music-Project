Tell me for how long will we stay in this fucked up state of mind? âWITH NO CONCERN!
Thousands of years of failures that we must wash away! -WITHOUT CONCERN!
Weâve been fed so many lies, everyone is suffocating! -SUFFOCATION!
The sickness is rising and we need a cure right now! âRIGHT NOW!

Past generations leave an inheritanceâ¦A gift to their fellow men,
But it rather looks like additional scars-to-me! MORE SCARS TO ME!

The Octopus fills us up with lies with each of its tentacles
and they all work together so hard to keep you from es-ca-ping!

â¦Escaping from the curse of the Medusaâ¦

Maybe we should embrace the need to change, if it's not too late!- IF ITâS NOT TOO LATE!
We must gather together to create the strength to hold on!â¦. -THE WEAPON THEYâLL FEAR!

Past generations leave an inheritanceâ¦A gift to their fellow men,
But it rather looks like additional scars to me!

WE NEED A CURE RIGHT NOW!
We have the strength to embrace the change!
