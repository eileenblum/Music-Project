Scratched &amp; bruised and beaten wrecks
Exiled to the streets
Their own fate is their worst enemy
Beg, sell, and steal to eat
Offer you the world they own
Itâs just a ploy, a hidden sin
You canât erase a worthless past
In this arena no one wins

[Chorus:]
Will they leave me be?
Living like a leach
Never gonna leave
Insane Society

 In your face, a wall of smut
Ruling in this land
The goods they sell are cyanide
Waiting to change hands
Youâll never know where theyâve been
Or what theyâre going to do
The disease of the environment
Will push itself on you

[Repeat chorus]

Selling of their body is all the world they have
They need a fix so bad under the skin
Life is really sad
But this is the world that they choose
A junkie of the streets
A victim of addiction, the one that canât be beat
