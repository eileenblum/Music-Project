Screamin for mercy, you are so pitiful 
Run for some shelter, try to escape from me
Can you stand it or will you just give up
You know you canât take it 
Because I am the one
To tear you up
Take you down
My how the torture
Shows in your eyes
It shows- in your eyes

Grab your belongings, take the next train out of town
The full moon is rising Iâm comin to get you now

Blood will be flying when I hit you with full force 
And soon youâll be crying, oh why do I have to die?

You are so selfish
Never time for no one
Will you accept it
Your time has finally come

Breakdown
Woman youâre breaking me down
Breakdown
I donât care if itâs you or me
