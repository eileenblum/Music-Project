Feeling the pressure
My mind begins to bend
A twisted puzzle
Too much to comprehend
Radical Measures
Fanatics run wild
Escape from adapting
To prejudicial lies

Canât you sense my force
Never take itâs course 
It will cost your life

Corruption will feel us
As we begin to bear
Our strength is in our numbers
And fear sends you there

Weâve become lethal
Our fate can change
Fanatics rule all minds

Attack every thought allowing our plan to work
Never ending rage will build up from inside

And take it all away leaving our hate to show
For obsolescent ways the time has come to change

We have the power to overcome the regnancy
Living for the day fanatics gain control
