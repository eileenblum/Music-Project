Walkin the streets alone at night
Everybodyâs ready
Darkness creeping on 
The cold air is deadly
And soon weâll find the gate to hell
In a fire stricken hole
Then, the master will call out
Behold, I want you to know
I want you to know

As he raises his fist to the sky
Weâre all told to listen
Come my children of the wicked
Into my own world
Thereâs nowhere else that you can go
Everything is frozen
This place down here is forever hot
And soon you will like it
You will like it
You all will like
