Can you feel what you want
Is your need so strong that you 
Gotta have
Burning desire is a one way street
Itâll tear you up and get you beat
I know what I want
I know itâs not you
A pack of lies is all you speak
Lookout, youâre in for a treat

Crawl around on your knees
Getting dirty, anything to please
Your mind is an empty space
Itâs written all over your face
Do anything to get your way
It wonât work, itâs another day
Canât you see its no use
Torturing yourself with this abuse
Câmon

Fight, Fight â to stop your lies
Right, right â gotta realize
Hey, hey â whatâs your game
Lay, lay â well thatâs your game
