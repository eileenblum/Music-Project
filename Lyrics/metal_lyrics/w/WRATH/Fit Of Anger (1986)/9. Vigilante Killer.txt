Woken by surprise in the dead of night
Caught in between whatâs wrong and right
Donât play the hero, it never pays
The one who kills, is the one who lays
They donât care if you have a reason
Itâs all the same to them
Theyâll hang you hard and string you high
And let your body sizzle and fry

Over and over you try to escape
The fear that follows is a lonely wait
Cominâ to get you at a quarter of five
The plunge you take is the final dive
The crowd gathers for the show to begin 
The lights come on and they bring you in
Tied to the chair like a little doll
Treated to the crowd like a criminal 

You will see that I am right
Time will tell, if you, are free
Youâll see, right
