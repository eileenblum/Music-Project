Terror in your eyes, time to realize
Your fate has been chosen
No more chances, youâve been
Given enough
To prove yourself
Now thereâs the fear, dripping in a tear
Running slowly down
Your mind bleeds sorrow, as if
No tomorrow
Cry yourself to sleep

The men await, while the children
Take their turn on your body
Casting spells upon, hurling stones on
Your tortured waiting soul
Demented little schemes, their evil little dreams
To destroy your face
Fallen apart from the shame and disgrace
The angel crawls to a hiding place

Taken astray, by your swollen mind
Come down to earth, ooh and see the light
You are no one and soon you all will find
Why the angel cant fly

Try to pull a number 
Itâs all in vain 
Your efforts are wasted
Everyone has caught onto your game
The emptiness shows why
No one came
Keep patting yourself on the back
While your show goes down
A well troddenâ track 
Nowhere at all is where youâll always be
A dream world you live, some fantasy
