Thunder- hits the sky
Crashin â to the ground
Run to the gates
Youâre the chosen one
Engines rumble â in the dead of night

Slowly walkinâ â itâs a dark
Lonely crawl 
Passinâ a life time- left on a wall

Runnin- through the night
Trying â not to fight
Pull now â Together
(We canât give up)
Scream out â for your sins
(Ya gotta try)

Place in your mind,
You gotta believe
Run with the pack, donât look back
Out in the night, nowhere in sight
Press in now, to machine

What can this be
For all you to see
The fear will numb
Machine will come
