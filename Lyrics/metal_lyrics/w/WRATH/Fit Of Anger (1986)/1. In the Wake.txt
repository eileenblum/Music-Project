Possessed by shadows, you turn to run
From what you donât know, something evil
Someone lives inside you, I know the reason why
Somethingâs grown inside you, youâre gonna die

Pain it overcomes you, inside your head
Reaching out for help, thereâs no one there
Feelings of anger, penetrate your mind
Somethingâs inside you, youâre gonna die

Someone lives inside you
Somethingâs making you lose your mind

Can you â Can you fight it off
Or will you lose your sanity

Left in the wake, one step from hell

Someone lives inside you, I know the reason why
Somethingâs grown inside you, youâre gonna die
Someone lives inside you
Something lives inside
Someone lives inside you
Something â youâre gonna die
