Suicide overload, she canât get away
Canât get her mind through another day
Praying for the strength 
Or the will to survive
Donât wanna be around when 
She takes that dive
Simple minds breed simple souls
The time has come as the bell tolls
Her silly ass body crawls into bed
To get by
Under the sheets is where 
Sheâs gonna die

Around the block is where she goes
Everybodyâs had some, we all know
Disease, infections to the point of disgust
Her mind is raged with that one track lust
Calling out to anyone with a gun
She wants to be loaded full of
No potential thereâs only
One way out
The end is near as she screams and shouts

Force her- onto her knees
Make it â last to please
Abuse it â till it bleeds
Make it â good to me
Make it â good to me
Abuse it â till it bleeds
