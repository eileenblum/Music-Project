In between the wars of time 
Death has struck the hour
Lifeless bodies lined the fields
Fertilizing powers of the world

All the powers of the worlds surround 
Making our lives crash to the ground
Take you to death your death soâ¦
Your death so young, push on the leaders there is the wrong
They are selling yourâ¦selling your head, 
Rented you outâ¦left for dead
When the worlds collide

Shadows grew upon the trees 
Mortar blasts in the cool breeze
Burnt building lined the skies
No one left all have died

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Darkness turned into the light
Death, destruction all in sight
I canât stand their evil ways
My minds at loss from day to day

Out of dark ashes rose
The universe it was destroyed
Your greed for scepter has recoiled
And left itâs mark in the soil
