Following footsteps through barren land
Searching through shadows 
Cast by my hand
The sun has beaten a sweat on my brow
Heat has taken my body over
Itâs taken my- body over

Day wears on into the night
Death is near, unless I fight
The war is over yet itâs just begun
Iâve got to survive the evil sun

He will be there
Waiting for your body as the end gets near
Cast out- your fears
Mind over matter is the only way out come on

A nightmare in daylight
You tell the untold stories
The rider on white horse
The only way to morning

Screamin, runnin, fallinâ on your knees
We will destroy ya, and then come back for more
Shout out, no one hears your
Useless call
