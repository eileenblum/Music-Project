Torn apart from the sight the deadly mass is out tonight
Along the streets the mutants crawl
Attacking young bodies and screaming their call
âOut of our wayâ is what they say
Worry no more your death will be my pay

Corpses fallâ¦one by one
Dead men crawlâ¦out of their holes
Blood runs redâ¦down my spine
Heads crushed by lead Iâm ripped into pieces

And so they say to be prepared the end is near and itâs time to fear
Caught by knives the blood flows free
Out of life and no one breathes
Sharpen the blades to dig inside
âOvercome bitch our you shall dieâ

In the air where radar scans human flesh begins to burn
Down below the people turn theyâre moving fast
But thereâs nowhere to go when the knife cuts through me
Oh my God Iâm ripped into pieces

Torn apart from the sight the deadly mass is out tonight
And so they say to be prepared the end is near and itâs time to fear
Caught by knives the blood flows free
Out of life and no one breathes
Sharpen the blades to dig inside
âOvercome bitch our you shall di
