Forever under fire your strength grows weak
You search for survival in this hell we keep
Penance paid the torture approaches
Wave a fist to try me attempt to crucify me
Iâm burned to bits Iâm laughing

My evil plots devotion to the sickened minds in motion
Money turns the tumblers in me
I crave the desire to watch you expire
A pitiful sight to see
Which deep blue vein will stop the flow
Well I'm still laughing donât you know
Iâll inspect you till the closing stage
And laugh you under when you die in caustic sleep

See my emotion watch me take over 
Never a leader always a taker
Spare me your anger I could care less

And so the day has come for judgment of you and me
Iâve never seen a more deserving bastard to die the death youâll feel
Your body will burn in agony and make my pleasure swell
Youâll never see your dreams matter theyâll just fade away

All your life youâve live a nightmare portraying innocence
When guilt has ruled your mind forever will you still deny
Cry out in pain an danger your God is dead
Must we all live in your shadow
