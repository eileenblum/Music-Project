Rats infest the human race
Ruining lives at a shattering pace
No hope for leaches that thrive on greed
Hell is full I bought the deed

Powers an illusion of weakened men
Destroying the ego of a brain termed âDeadâ
Wave your fists and lies come out
History reveals what believers doubt
Demented rulers for the time control
Leading astray the robots in droves
Pulling strings of ball less men
Afraid to speak out for the fear of death

Communist pigs patrol streets of fright
Preparing to strike an attack of delight
Rotting flesh give the air a stench
Murderers show no signs of repent
Eternal life is what you seek tin this game
But the fortunes you rape cannot bring you fame
The sign flashes bright on the burning wall
âNo More Room Hell is Fullâ

I blow my way through you force is my game
Iâll stand behind your back make your charade your words
You canât kill me Iâm not really there to take your blows
A well thought thrust will wipe me out of your brain
