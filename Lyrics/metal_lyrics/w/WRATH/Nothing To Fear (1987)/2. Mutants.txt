Across the lanes the mutants design 
A brew for descent to confiscate their wrath of mankind
Their avid lust it sickens the scheme
Afraid of contest to the change the codes of society

Lull yourselves is what they say
Respond to our deeds like beasts react to their tags
Adopt our laws for there is no choice
You gray matter means nothing except a voice
A voice that we donât hear

We will alter your tormentive ways
The mutants are going to take over

Weâll publicize specifics of your lies
And to the close youâll sorrow all your sins

Into the dark I sense your steel
Penetrate my spine, try to exhaust my mind

Iconoclast it spreads over countrysides
The dislodging is imminent as the day

Detonation grovels from the depths of despair
No more peace weâve lost the desire to live
The life youâve chosen for us
Try your strength youâve lost all your will
The time is ours and we shall not stand still
The mutants will survive

We will alter your tormentive ways
The mutants are going to take over

Mutants, Mutantsâ¦are going to take over
Mutants, Mutantsâ¦are going to lead
Mutants, Mutantsâ¦no more bullshit
Mutants, Mutantsâ¦
