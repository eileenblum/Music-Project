Secluded by thoughts almost never revealed 
He lives in his mind and laughs at the world
Anesthesia benumbs his soul and lifts the curse thatâs taken its toll
His world has froze heâs forgotten the past
His mindâs been blank heâs retired and left
A life of helping the young to live and the old to die and the blessed to give

But he knows, and the one thing that he controls is his state of mind
And thatâs where heâs got us all fooled
We think heâs insane but heâs actually not 
Heâs living his past inside of his thoughts

His thoughts are they real or are they part of his plan
To escape from a time which heâd rather forget
Heâs chosen isolation away from creation
Itâs his peace that matters to him and nothing else
Time, Time means nothing itâs so fribble
And to dwell on the subject is so unreal

Cause of Death, Classified!

One for depression
Two for the lack of thought
Four thousand questions stare you down
Once a life of trust now a broken man
Your concoction of life lives inside your nerves
Handing out answers to those in pain
Seeking relief from this hell
Curious people ask âWhoâs this saintly manâ
But heâs just an object that has lost his mind
