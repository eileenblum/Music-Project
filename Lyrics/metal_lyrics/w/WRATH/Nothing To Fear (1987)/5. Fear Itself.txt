Phobia grips my mind states my fear of nothing
Commit myself to comatose my movement sees and end

My intelligence anticipates an increase for suppression
Wallowing with my diffidence screaming for an answer

An emptiness surrounds me leaving me to wither
I must shake this silly whim for thereâs nothing left to fear

I have screamed my last dream
Shadows reveal what I have seen
My fears have been charaded into nothingness
A fool was I to believe
In fearâ¦itself

A feeling of confidence overwhelming erupts within
My character
Success over absurdity
Coward not justified capacities insulted
Exhausted of life in a shell this trendâs to be broken

Over my crisis and I donât wish to die
Laughing at my freight as it stares me in the eye
Phobias an illusion of a weak-minded fool
Controlling your emotions and possessing your rule

Scared to die
Hear my cry
Ya Ka Bang!
I wonât fear to die
