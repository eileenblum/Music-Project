[Limited Edition Bonus Track]

Everything is fading
Nothing left to follow
Everyone repeats the words
Empty and shallow
All our love has become
A mere liquid analogy
Of our recycled fragile entities

When god took his holiday
He let civilization rot
Away slowly
Color me unuseful
When you color me away

Everything is fading
Nothing left to follow
Everyone repeats the words
Empty and shallow
Everybody stand in line
And take the poison
The poison tastes divine

When god took his holiday
He let civilization rot
Away intentionally
Color me unuseful
When you color me away

All our love has become
Emptiness

Everything is fading
Nothing left to follow
Everyone repeats the words
Empty and shallow
Everybody stand in line
And take the poison
The poison tastes divine

All our love has become
Emptiness, nothingness, uselessness

Everything is fading
Nothing left to follow
Everyone repeats the words
Empty and shallow
Everything is fading
Nothing left to follow
Everyone repeats the words
Empty and shallow
