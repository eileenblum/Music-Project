Useless faith and numbered days
The end is near, we're all insane

The end is near, the drug is fear
Obey these words and believe me
Puppets play your game
Useless faith or poisoned veins
Follow me blindly into oblivion

Useless faith and numbered days
The end is near, we're all insane

The doomsayers, the clock watchers
Control your fate for their needs
When bullets are a legal drug
Murder is the ultimate rush
Society will punish you, is it wrong to execute

When will the powerful learn to understand
When we slit our wrists the same blood
Falls into the sand

Useless faith and numbered days
The end is near, we're all insane
