Brother you were never there for me
When the children needed peace you disgraced both families

Brother you were never there for me
When my father died I thought that you would take my hand
You said I was just too young

Sister I can tell you all the love I have for you
Our mother sleeps in silent peace because your love was pure

But brother you were never there for me
When my father died I thought that you would take my hand
You said I was just too young

If I could erase one moment of pain
I'd throw away everything, even fame
If I could play god do you know what I'd do?
I'd swim through your blood and kill the cancer in you

Brother you were never there for me
I was just too young but now I've grown and I can say

That brother you were never there for me
When my father died I thought that you would take my hand
You said I was just too young

If I could play god
I'd swim through your blood and kill the cancer in you
My brother
