These are the days when we celebrate host and parasites
Bold are the words of the cold unfeeling neophyte

I live in a sick world without balance or sense of reality

In a fractured moment we are torn into the fragments
Of a sick world without equilibrium

I can't erase the past, I can't erase today
Please take it all away
I can't believe there's nothing more to this senseless world
Please take it all away

Why do we live within these season of wither?
Why does the hopelessness take control?

In a fractured moment we are torn into the fragments
Of a sick world without equilibrium

I can't erase the past, I can't erase today
Please take it all away
I can't believe there's nothing more to this senseless world
Please take it all away

Slowly fading we lose control
Slowly decaying, losing all

I can't erase the past, I can't erase today
Please take it all away
I can't believe there's nothing more to this senseless world
Please take it all away
