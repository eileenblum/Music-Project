When the ones you love have let you down
Feel failure and wear the fool's crown
Remember still there is a blessing
Within the hardest lesson

You self serving arrogant sycophant
Your selfish acts, thoughtless tasks and livid rants
Every time you want to make the world go away
Just take an injection of your chosen misery

And when I fall
I have the strength to learn the steps
And crawl into the pain
Sometimes the mirror is cruel
If your mother gave the lesson
Never waste the truth

You self serving arrogant sycophant
Your selfish acts, thoughtless tasks and livid rants
Every time you want to make the world go away
Just take an injection of your chosen misery

Yesterday was plagued with rain
Like silent drops of velvet pain
Hail yesterday
Thursday was the day of sin
Friday silent hell began
Hail yesterday

Saturday was plagued with rain - I played the jester perfectly, hail yesterday
Sunday never came to mind - I played the jester perfectly when misery delivered me
Monday's afterthought was blind - I played the jester perfectly, hail yesterday
Tuesday stole the show - I played the jester perfectly when misery delivered me

Hail yesterday
Hail yesterday

Tuesday stole the show, when Wednesday killed the golden crown.
