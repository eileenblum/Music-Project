It was the spring when we met our renewal
And all around us was madness and ruin
As if awaiting its prey
The ascending melee pulled the sun down

In August we laid her down
In August we gave her to the ground
One last kiss, her last wish
Was that this moment would last forever
In August we laid her down
In August we gave her to the ground

Torn away, torn in two
Destiny where are you?

It was the spring when we met our renewal
And all around us was madness and ruin
It was the spring when we met our denial
It was the spring
In August we laid her down

In August we laid her down
In August we gave her to the ground
One last kiss, her last wish
Was that this moment would last forever
In August we laid her down
In August we gave her to the ground
