[Feat. Chris Broderick]

And the parasites that call themselves the pretty ones
Licked their lips acknowledging the suffering they had created
And yet felt no remorse

In between the quiet space
Of cold defense and misplaced selfish rage
I blame defiantly
Not like the others that came before
We are the ones who can change

I love to let you down
I love to wear this foolish crown
Of suffering and empty dignity
For your deity has abandoned me
Such is vanity

The withered parasites are slandering
The walls of truth, the wise can see them fall
To attain enlightenment
The change is whispered on the winds of unjust war

I love to let you down
I love to wear this foolish crown
Of suffering and empty dignity
For your deity has abandoned me
Such is vanity

Not like the others that came before
We are the ones who can change
Not like the hatred that falls away
Treading the silence again

I love to let you down
I love to wear this foolish crown
Of suffering and empty dignity
For your deity has abandoned me
Such is vanity

Not like the others that came before
We are the ones who can change
