[Feat. Jeff Loomis]

I'm the one you call the liar
I'm the lamb who slayed the lion
Crawl upon your cross again
Play the victim till the end
What you've gained is nothingness
What you've learned is useless

You play the Martyr, crawl upon your cross again
Always the victim but it's all inside your head

Dark are those that lie to lovers
Your fathers past, the weakest cover
Perched upon your soiled throne
Cast your sticks, I'll throw stones
Envy and Lust will drown you
Just look around you

You play the Martyr, crawl upon your cross again
Always the victim but it's all inside your head

Remembering days we felt we were chosen
Those were the days when the hunger was all that we had
Can't take back the past, can't heal the wounds
No one can rescue your faded ideals
All that remains are scars of a wasted youth

You play the Martyr, crawl upon your cross again
Always the victim but it's all inside your head
When will you ever learn to trust another, my friend
just play the Martyr 'till the world stands to it's end
