I remember this old man and the wisdom that he shared with me
Upon his knees I'd listen
I remember words he spoke and the look behind his quiet eyes
In silent bliss life gives little lessons

He spun tales of worlds unseen
Now he sacrificed his youthful dreams
He lived his life again just for me
He raised children to be strong
They flew into the city lights, such busy lives
He wished they'd visit home

I will remember the words of this old man until my dying day

It took his death to bring them home
To the empty rooms where they had grown
Where he died alone
And the buried him next to his bride
I held her hand as my mother cried
Just a child of five, now I understand

Now I understand the words of this old man
