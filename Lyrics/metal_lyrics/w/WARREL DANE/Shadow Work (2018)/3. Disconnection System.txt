Today, I smoked my pain away
Yesterday we stood in our decadent decay
We brave the storm
But still man did conform
We serve the virgin, suffering
We serve the virgin and not the king

Within the darkness we came along
We drove the devil into his perverted religious throng

We serve the virgin, suffering
We serve the virgin and not the king
Disconnection system takes control
I will serve the virgin and not the whore
If you take a step back to realize
This disconnection system shall open your eyes

(Suffered enough, I feel lost
Failure to see before nevermore I am
Why I fear why I am here)

[Solo]

We serve the virgin of suffering
We serve the virgin and not the king
Disconnection system takes control
I will serve the virgin and not the whore
If you take a step back to realize
This disconnect system will open your eyes
