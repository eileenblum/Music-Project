A war rages inside of me
Do I choose heaven or hell?

Drag me down to hell and make me deny god
Pull me under and watch as I evolve
Love me tender but kill me slowly

Madame Satan, please come to me
My succubus of eternal lust, please crucify me
Kill me in my dreams, my sweet madame Satan
My sweet madame Satan

A battle of innocence that most cannot comprehend
A sweet place of pure disgrace
Awaits in the setting sun
Face fear, make it clear
The ending has begun

Pull me under and baptize me
Madame Satan, please come to me
My succubus of eternal lust, please crucify me
Kill me in my dreams, my sweet madame Satan
My sweet madame Satan

Lies and hatred, our minds stripped naked
Guided by decay
Reign in suffering from the depths of chaos
Who are we to be saved?

Praise the saints of abomination
Lay the past in its grave
Only humans use pain and torture
For their foolish, selfish gain

You can pull me away from time
But you can't escape the afterlife

I can see the future sky is black
In the final days
Hell is hot and waits for me
Just a blasphemous man insane

Life is torture, maybe we're not immortal

Madame Satan, please come to me
My succubus of eternal lust, please crucify me
Tonight, we can dance like freaks
Until the devil speaks
If we're all going to hell
That's where all my friends will dwell

Where all my friends will dwell
In hell
