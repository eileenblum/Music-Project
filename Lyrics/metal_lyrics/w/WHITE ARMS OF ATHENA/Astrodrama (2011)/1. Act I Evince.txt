Bring this forward to the world, I feel as if I must. How are we supposed to ever love, if in our selves we do not trust?
This trust I'm speaking of, it comes from within, so that is where we must begin...

As I am writing this, these are but ideas, I am but a student.
I'd like to say Im learning, and striving to see my self through it.
I've leapt and stayed and, I've also lost my balance.

My self and I,
I think we've found a sort of balance.
Together,
we have waved off the valance.
This veil of presence.

Oh, maybe the way we are is hereditary...
Or, maybe we are the way we are because of some old karmic struggle we just can't see clearly...
A good part of all this would be the ones we hold dearly, side to side, daily and yearly.

We can't hear each other clearly.
We just can't hear each other clearly...
We fight thinking what we've been taught to believe is right, for us, it is - in our plight.

We must turn it around,
permit proper sight.
Take the shadows, bring them to light!
I wish I may, I wish I might,
Every soul in the world tonight, finds their place.
A sacred space to sleep, to speak, and to make peace with that which they need.
