Reality just slapped the shit out of me. Blink of an eye type of thing. Fucking catastrophe.

Blink of an eye type of thing. Saying, "Awaken, big things must be done.
Big things must be done since you feel you have the power. Since you feel you have the power."

But in the back of my head, "Haha, just because you think you know it all, just because you think you know it all, just because you think you know it all, and because you think you know it all."

Contradictions are what is keeping this at a head.
Just when there is enough, more is needed.

I do find comfort in knowing it all can be vented, (like this)
But the process is taking it's toll on us all.

So when in doubt, think about it once and over again. What was the outcome? It was the same both times. I've told you!
I've told you this is real! I've told you this is real!
Not stuck, just waiting, because this is a fucking journey.

Not stuck, just waiting, and its the only thing I'd ever let take this time.

Pure emotion, gives a lover chills on this journey. On this journey, love isn't physical, on this journey.

Expressed through thoughts and rhythmic patterns, we do this for you.

On this journey, love isn't physical; expressed through thoughts and rhythmic patterns we do this for you.
