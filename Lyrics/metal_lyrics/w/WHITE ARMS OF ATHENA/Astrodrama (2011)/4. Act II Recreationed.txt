We all must be a little out of our minds. To simply abide and trust with closed eyes.
To trust with closed eyes and still see,
If we are anything it is proof.

Its funny. Its funny, Its all amazing.
Its funny, Its all one big fucking joke.
And if we can take a life, or even live a life, then we must all be.
We must all be able to take a joke.

Because it's whimsical even, but in the best way imaginable.

We all must be a little out of our minds,
to simply abide and trust with closed eyes.
To trust with closed eyes and still see,
If this is anything, it is proof.

See me when you see you. When you see you, see you when you...
When you see you you see me!
See you, see me when you...

When we find harmony helps a human to recognize these surroundings, doesn't everything feel a little familiar?
