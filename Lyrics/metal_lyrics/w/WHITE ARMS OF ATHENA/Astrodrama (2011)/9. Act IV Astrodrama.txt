Your being really doesn't exist here anymore, and I understand that;
But what I don't get is that I'll never be with you; See, talk, or laugh with you ever again.
You really were an influence, laughing your laugh all the time.

And when you left I don't want to imagine how it was for you.
Wasting time with no possible change is for no man.

You were my mothers keeper, like you should have been.
And then without warning, disaster.

So, we worked it, like before, but we forgot about temptation. We had no idea.
"I am here inside you, and I will eat at you until you give in to what I want."
That's her. That's her! A whore is temptation.

No sympathy be given, it just won't be spoken of.
We all gave in, and we're all human. Worse could have been done.

Everyone blame yourself please.
Everyone blame yourselves please.
Everyone blame yourself, please.

For closure, I still talk to you.

And I woke up and wrote this for everyone.
I woke up, and wrote this for everyone.
I woke up.

Awaiting the better, hope and want are just a step forwards to be thrusted backwards, full speed ahead.

" I am here inside you, and I will eat at you until you give in to what I want "

I woke up and wrote this for every one:

Awaiting the better, hope and want are just that. A step forwards to be thrusted backwards, full speed ahead.
With this speed, with this speed, one could change, but traveling backwards brings...
Discomfort and distortion.

Oh, where would you start?
Here, you can start!

Gone, I'll be, comfortably. Influenced less by gravity. So high...
Nothing happens outside of what I'd like to, I'm spending decades in moments if I choose to harness the power.

To harness the power of these dreams (my blueprints for my time machine), think, give your head a chance, fall in to it open minded-ly; and see your mind for what it really is.
