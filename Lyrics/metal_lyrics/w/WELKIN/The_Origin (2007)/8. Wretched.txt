Like Sheep Grilling In The Heat
Of What Was A Sweet And Thrilling Day
Race The World To Be The First
On The Ride That Goes Straight To Hell

Like Sheep Grilling In The Heat
Of What Was A Sweet And Thrilling Day
Race The World To Be The First
On The Ride That Goes Straight To Hell

Leave Me To Be
Don't Want To Go
Let Me To Live
My Own Life

Like Sheep Grilling In The Heat
Of What Was A Sweet And Thrilling Day
Race The World To Be The First
On The Ride That Goes Straight To Hell

Fighting An Others Demons
This Wretched Life Must Go
I Never Asked For This Trip
Beyond The Depths Of My Own Goals
Fighting An Others Demons
This Wretched Life Must Go

I Live In Poverty

Like Sheep Grilling In The Heat
Of What Was A Sweet And Thrilling Day
Race The World To Be The First
On The Ride That Goes Straight To Hell

Like Sheep Grilling In The Heat
Of What Was A Sweet And Thrilling Day
Race The World To Be The First
On The Ride That Goes Straight To Hell

Leave Me To Be
Don't Want To Go
Let Me To Live
My Own Life

Leave Me To Be
Don't Want To Go
Rising At Time
Dragging My Limbs
Let Me To Live
My Own Life

Let Me To Live
My Own Life
