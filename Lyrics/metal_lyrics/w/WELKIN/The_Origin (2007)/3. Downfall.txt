Wild Face
Burned With Yearning
Bloody Meadows, Forced To Hate
In Their Hands, Pain Keeps Growing
The Veil Of Promise, Shows NO Stains

The System Fails
The Sky Comes Down

Misery Is Ending
Clouds Pore Down
Rains Of Sorrow
The Downfall Starts

We Eat Our Own Full Weight
Of Misery, Grieve And Hate
Thinking That We'll Survive
Growing Enstranged

We Eat Our Own Full Weight
Of Misery, Grieve And Hate
Thinking That We'll Survive
Growing Enstranged

Wild Face
Burned With Yearning
Bloody Meadows, Forced To Hate
In Their Hands, Pain Keeps Growing
The Veil Of Promise, Shows NO Stains

The Downfall Starts Right Now
