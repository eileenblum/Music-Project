With A Ridged Enslaving Beat
The Sound Crawls Up To Me
Silence Dies In Ripping Screams
As They Are Out, Finding Me
Looking For Their Hungry Eyes
Tears Well Up In Me
Why Can't They Just Pass By
And Let Me Bleed

I Want To Sleep

Beyond The Gate Of My Own Keep
I Cannot Hope To Be Free
Driving My Nails In The Walls
Still Slowly I Slip Away

I Hold The Pain
Let It All Burn
Turn Around My Sight

Black Hands On A Dying Light
Hollow Teeth With A Holy Sign
The Air Choking, Closing Tight
Crawling Towards The Final Line

Black Hands On A Dying Light
Hollow Teeth With A Holy Sign
Sounds Crawling Up To Me
Silence Dying In A Ripping Screams
The Air Choking, Closing Tight
Crawling Towards The Final Line

Beyond The Gate Of My Own Keep
I Cannot Hope To Be Free
Driving My Nails In The Walls
Still Slowly I Slip Away

Don't Let Me Sleep
I Die Alone

Into The Dark
over The Plains
Of Weathered Grief
And My Own Life

Why Play My Divine Snare
Fight Aside The Crumbling Right
The Danger In Eternal Care
Wrestling With The Cloth Of Night

Spreaded Wings Surrounding Me
Holding My Mind Complete
One Ray Of Breaking Light
May The Sun In My Soul Shine
