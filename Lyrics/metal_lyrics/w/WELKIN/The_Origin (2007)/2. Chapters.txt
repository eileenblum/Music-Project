A Glance Of Insanity
A Mind Set To War
Craving For Solitude
Moulding The Door
Destroyed By Self-Knowledge
Crushed Bu Relief
Craving For Solitude
Surrounded By Weeds

To Let It Grow
To Let It Feed
To Need Believe

To See It Go
To Drown In Tears
To Turn The Page

To Feel Alive
To Kick And Fight
To Make It Stream

To Trust And Hope
To Reach Ahead
To Glow Inside

With Hands Full Of Memories
A Head Torn By Fear
The Shadows Reaping
Light Shines On Me
Light Shines On Me

To Let It Grow
To Let It Feed
To Need Believe

To See It Go
To Drown In Tears
To Turn The Page

To Feel Alive
To Kick And Fight
To Make It Stream

To Trust And Hope
To Reach Ahead
To Glow Inside

Enlighten Me
Selective Need
Squired Greed
Hope Drenched Seed
Grow In Me
