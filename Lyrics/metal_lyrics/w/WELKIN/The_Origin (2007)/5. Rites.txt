The Harder We Scream At This
Heart Fleshed By Integrity
Passed Onto The Dreaming Plains
Groaning We Rest Ourselves

The Harder We Scream At This
Heart Fleshed By Integrity
Passed Onto The Dreaming Plains
Groaning We Rest Ourselves

Without The Rites
Without The Pain
Without The Lies
The Malice And Without The Stains

Without The Rites
Without The Pain
Without The Lies
The Malice And Without The Stains

Walls
Standing With Pride
Built With Passion
Time Endured

Walls
Standing With Pride
Spend In Friendship
Bounded In Hate

Armies Strong As No Living Man
Flooding Landscapes On Knees And Hands
Screaming The Names Of Them Who Lead
The Battle For Individuality

The Battle For Individuality
The Battle For Integrity
The Battle For Individuality
The Battle For Integrity

But The Whaling Echoes Tell Us
That This Will Not Be In Vein
Our Heart Will Keep On Growing
Beyond The Borders Of This Domain

This Will Only Enrichen
Our Sense Of Right And Wrong
The Mind Is Set To Flourish
And Take Our Misery Down

Armies Strong As No Living Man
Flooding Landscapes On Knees And Hands
Screaming The Names Of Them Who Lead
The Battle For Individuality

The Rites Cleans Our Past Tense
The Rites Make Way Of Grief
The Rites Strengthen Our Will
The Rites Make A Man
