Speak The Name That Spawns Worldwide Disasters
Reaping The Wicked, Seizing The Damned
Fear The Hand That Weighs Of All Your Stories
Depths To Conquer, Evil To Drown
Evil To Drown

With The Sword In Which Fires Are Burning
I swing To Clench And Purify The Sky
From The Evil, The Sins, The Plagued
Follow My Rules, Or Admit To The Lie

With The Sword In Which Fires Are Burning
I swing To Clench And Purify The Sky
From The Evil, The Sins, The Plagued
Follow My Rules, Or Admit To The Lie
Admit To The Lie

I Feel Vengeance Burning Inside
For Those Who Pushed Me Aside

With The Sword In Which Fires Are Burning
I swing To Clench And Purify The Sky
From The Evil, The Sins, The Plagued
Follow My Rules, Be Willing To Die

To All Who Ever Followed
A Path To My Demise
I Will Never Forget
Prepare To Pay The Fine
