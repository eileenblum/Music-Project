The Ability Of An Own Voice
Is A Gift, Blessed And Praised
So Why Try And Hide Yourself
Behind The Statue Of An Empire Raised

Hail To The Throne
Feed The King

The Ability Of An Own Voice
Is A Gift, Blessed And Praised
So Why Try And Hide Yourself
Behind The Statue Of An Empire Raised

Hail To The Throne
Feed The King

Let Perish, The Rest Of It
In A Flock There Is No Room To Grow
Let Perish, The Voice Of It
The Shepherd Will Let ... Let You Drown

The Ability Of An Own Voice
Is A Gift, Blessed And Praised

Hail To The Throne
Feed The King
Hail To The Throne
Feed The King

The Ability Of An Own Faith
Is A Gift, Blessed And Praised
So Why Try And Hide Yourself
Behind The Statue Of An Empire Ruined

Hail To The Throne ...
