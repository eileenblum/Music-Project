Why do you murder your brothers,
And squander nature's beauty?
You are all blind and ignorant, truly.
How is it possible to lose lucidity?
Reimagine the earth,
Or we'll all drown in stupidity.
One day you'll all see.

Destroy everything.
We can erase the obliteration of this well being.

Take a look at the sky and acknowledge these mysteries.
They will never deceive me.
From your lips, you'll speak the cries of surrender.
Procrastinating until we'll all appear.
But by then you'll all be seized by your fear.

Your leaders are feeble and weak,
Unable to keep promises they speak.
They treat you like you have a choice.
So what's happened to your voice?

Speak.

Those intelligent enough, will submit, our reign shall begin it's imminent.
And you'd better not pissed because you got us here,
Here to begin with.

We are your final solution.
'Cause this is our war.

Take a look at the sky and acknowledge these mysteries.
They will never deceive me.
From your lips, you'll speak the cries of surrender.
Procrastinating until we'll all appear.
But by then you'll all be seized by your fear.

We see them gazing overhead.
Fuck.

We will show you the true meaning of violence.
