This flesh you are given is simply a test,
And if you succeeded you will rise like the rest.
There's an alternate choice and not many know it,
Your mind is fascinating, you can overthrow it.
(You can overthrow it)
To walk away with your eyes still open.

In an atmosphere of temptation,
Clear the mind and seek what we should find.

Inspiration is what your mind should seek.

This entity does not understand it's purpose.
Don't ever fault it.

Tell me you're alright,
Tell me it's not too late.
I know it's not your time.
You deserve to shine.

Dodging the world,
Like an open wound.
The soul escapes 'cause it lost the will to speak or consume.
The body is used.
This pain will end,
I swear to you.

You're life is irreplaceable.

This life won't be the death of me.
I will never set my demons free,
Buried beneath the feet of the ones I love.
They're a gift from above.
I won't join their creator.

Tell me you're alright,
Tell me it's not too late.
I know, I know.
Open your eyes, let me hear your voice.

Open your eyes, let me hear your voice.
Open your eyes, let me hear your voice.
