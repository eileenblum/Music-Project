All I see is the light inside my dreams.
Awe struck, accept reality.
The life and fulfillment I crave is within my reach.
This body, it leaves me.

Eyes on me.

Take heed.
The vessel powers through.
Unveil the entity within you.

But just rememberâ¦
What you say to me if you're against me.

I know you look at me with eyes filled with envy.
Swallow pain, guilt and rage.
Too much for you to take,
And you're ashamed.
All you have left is your atrophy.

In my eyes you're worthless.
Discover your purpose.

My passion is sinking now.
There is a place where inspiration ignites.
And I cannot feel the sights.
But I hear the lights.
And I was so lost,
And I was so scared,
But now I know the passion is there.

All I see is the light inside my dreams.
Awe struck, accept reality.
The life and fulfillment I crave is within my reach.
This body, it leaves me.

Don't stray.
Carry your head up high.
With patience,
You will know existence.

You will know existence.
