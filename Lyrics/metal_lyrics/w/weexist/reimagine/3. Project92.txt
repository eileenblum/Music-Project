I know what it's like to be secondary, temporary.
I know it seems like the fall is never ending.
But would you take it with me?

I'm so ashamed when temptation,
It takes me,
It breaks me.
I revere in the thought of the selfless plot that I call my own life.

Can you fucking hear us now?

With hearts of fire,
This earth is yours and mine to take.
Their voices shatter,
They mean to harm.

We will not stand by as the serpents rip away at our skin.
As the days grow longer we fall asleep faster.

We're so carbon copied,
And we think through a screen.
Have you ever asked yourself,
"Now what's life mean?"

Turn away from everything you know,
This isn't how it's supposed to go.
I will not leave this place or leave your embrace.

I won't listen to what they say.
(To what they say)

And we've been living in a fantasy,
That's what they say.
I'm not sure what it'll take,
But let's make it a reality,
Not matter how long I wait,
I'm with you 'til I stop moving.

Fear of success is what prevents us like a boundary.
I can tell you right now that I'm not afraid,
Afraid of being free.

Turn away from everything you know,
This isn't how it's supposed to go.
I will not leave this place or leave your embrace.

We all fall,
Through it all.
We live and we die,
I'm not afraid to survive.

We are the golden age,
This is the new generation.
