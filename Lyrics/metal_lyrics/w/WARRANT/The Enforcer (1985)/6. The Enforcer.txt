He lived in the past
Executioner is his name
He had sworn to wipe out evil

Others told him
What to do
His job was to kill parasites

We need him today
To do what we say
He is our last chance

[Chorus:]
The enforcer
Save us now
The enforcer
Smash the rulers, bring them down
The enforcer
Your axe is dynamite
The enforcer
We'll ride by your side

Look, can't you see
We only want to have fun
But some bastards trying to spoil it

Wars of aggression
Are in the air
The will to live's gone forever

Some heads will have to roll
To satisfy our souls
We need him to survive

[Chorus]

The enforcer...

Time, wind and rain
Are far away
The earth's been blown to bits

Break the spell
Or go to hell
The viper's mouth is deadly

We need him today
To do what we say
He is our last chance

[Chorus]

The enforcer...
