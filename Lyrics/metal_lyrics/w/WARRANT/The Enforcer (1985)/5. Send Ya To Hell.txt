Banging around, pounding the ground
Forget all the trouble you've had,

There's no way out
Death comes from above
Powder lies everywhere

Dreaming of a better earth
No one sees what you deserve
You lying preachers

Live or die, don't ask why
Mankind don't have no hope

Shout it out that we're not proud
To fight for our fatherland

We are numbers in a game
The game is deadly a total disgrace
You lying preachers

[Chorus:]
We'll send ya to hell
You preachers...

[Chorus]

Banging around, pounding the ground
Forget all the trouble you've had,

There is no way out
Death comes from above
Powder lies everywhere

Faces of death comin' on fast
The pest is spreading you are the last
You lying preachers
