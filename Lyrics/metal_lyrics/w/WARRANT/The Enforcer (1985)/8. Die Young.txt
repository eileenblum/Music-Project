Heavy metal is my life, someday I'll be a star
Sometimes downcast, sometimes high
Rolling down the road

Pleasure is the only thing,
Which satisfies my needs
But the end will come soon
I'm gonna have to die, the devil will get me

[Chorus:]
Die young, die young, die young

My love of guitar, my love of song
Makes me feel so strong
Playing loud, playing fast
The show must go on

Fucking groupies all night long,
Just see me turning on
But the end will come soon
I'm gonna have to die, the devil will get me

[Chorus]
