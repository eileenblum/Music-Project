Late in the night when I close my eyes
My thoughts oscillate
In the tunnel of life and death
It's so cold, it's so dark as I try to get free
Red eyes of fire staring at me

[Chorus:]
Torture in the tower,
They're coming down on me
Torture in the tower,
Is it real or fantasy

I see a hangman, staring at me
I get the feeling, he's waiting for me
My sweat's running cold
The axe falls through the air
My head is falling, my soul screams in despair
