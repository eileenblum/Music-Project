[2000 Reissue Bonus Track]The city where we're gonna play tonight
Is closed to my heart
The magic is great, the feeling is right
No one can tear us apart

There's only one answer
Together as one
Like a magnet to steel
It turns me on like dynamite

[Chorus]

Don't put out the flame of the show
Don't let it end, just carry on, and on and on
Don't put out the flame of the show, oh no
Don't let it end, just carry on, and on...

Don't change this feeling', keep it for good
So take what I give
You got the choice, you know what it means
I'm your pleasure machine

Makes me hell and fire
Time and again
Don't wanna say goodbye
We're flying high through the sky

[Chorus]
