The same old song 'bout how the world'll go on
The world we're living in is a commercial bomb
Shall we break through the wall?
Or shall we begin a deadly war?

[Chorus:]
Say what you think
Cowards or martyrs
Say what you think?
Cowards or martyrs

Shall we run or shall we hide?
Warbringer can't tell me no more lies

The persecution of evil
Is our only chance

[Chorus]

Soldiers of metal save us now
We place our hopes in you
God'll give you the benediction
And you'll never ever die
