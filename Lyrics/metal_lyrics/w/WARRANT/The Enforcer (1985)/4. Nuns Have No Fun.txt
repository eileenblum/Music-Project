They lived in a convent
No entrance for the outer world
Love is not allowed
Between their legs

I don't understand it
How can they live without a man
Don't they feel a great temptation
Lonely nights

[Chorus:]
Nuns have no fun, they are always on the run
Nuns have no fun, they are always on the run

Words like fucking
They don't wanna know
But deep inside their souls
Dirty jokes

Only vibrators
Can make them high
A risk much too dangerous
God's waiting inside

[Chorus]

Now we just feel obliged
To help them for a while
We can bring their problems
To an end

You can make them happy
For the rest of their lives
They only need a little lovin'
To survive
