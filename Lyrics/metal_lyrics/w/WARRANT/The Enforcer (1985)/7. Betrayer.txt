Feel the metal
Again and again
Hear the people
Who call us insane
Hear them scream, see them run
For their lives

[Chorus]
Betrayer thatÂ´s you, betrayer thatÂ´s you
Betrayer thatÂ´s you, thatÂ´s you
They make me so sick
Their lives are grey
WeÂ´re gonna stopÂ´em
To show the way
Hear them scream, see them run
For their lives

[Chorus]

Betrayer, betrayer, thatÂ´s you, betrayer thatÂ´s you
So be a metal man and do everything you can
So be a metal man and do everything you can

[Chorus]
