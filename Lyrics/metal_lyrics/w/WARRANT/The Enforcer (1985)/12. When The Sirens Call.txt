[2000 Reissue Bonus Track]The eyes of a billion people
Are watching the sky
The day has come, the majesty's arrived
Screaming and crying
A mankind in despair
But we should know we can't go on this way...

When the sirens call
When the sirens call
When the sirens call

Don't be afraid, when it's all over now
Save the action in your mind
Worn out, at a loss, lost in paradise
The sound of sirens everywhere

Power, the infinite universe
Death, the past will fade away...

[Chorus]

Oh it's too late
When the sirens call
No matter who you were before, before
Oh it's too late
When the sirens call
But it's you they wanted dead

When the sirens call
When the sirens call
When the sirens call

The world is shocked, crying out for help
Face the mirror, all we see is pain
A second chance, they've come to save our souls
Annihilation to animate the world

Lost, it's coming down to earth
Death comes nearer to take lifeâs place

[Chorus]

When the sirens call
When the sirens call
When the sirens call
