I don't like anything you do
Controlling me like a fool
Get lost

Full of disguises and dirty lies
You've never known the poorest life
Get lost

Fat politician, what's in your head
I'll kick your ass, you're driving me mad

[Chorus:]
I got no more hope
Call for the rack
No future for me
Call for the rack

Brothers killing brothers
Devil's children are being born
Get lost

I'm running wild, getting higher
Revenge is my only desire
Get lost

Die you bastards, crawl down to hell
You lousy creatures, believe what I say
