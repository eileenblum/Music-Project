The nights of the round table
Read the message of King Arthur's disappearance
Oh Galvin wants to take the crown from Camelot
His hangman waits for the victims so innocent

[Chorus:]
No time to loose, we never see the king
Merlin the wise, put power in my hands
I'll capture Galvin and take him to the king
I'm waiting for a sign
Ready to command
We suspect a palace intrigue
But I know the sand of time is running fast
I take my armour and ride to unknown fortress
Merlin's prediction gives me a chance

[Chorus]

After the liberation, from the prison
The king shows Galvin his destiny
I take my horse and ride off to liberty
Arthur says: "Good night, thanks for your loyalty."
