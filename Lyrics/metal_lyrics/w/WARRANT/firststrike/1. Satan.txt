Knives and bullets, that's my sacred duty
I fell into disgrace with the priests
They get me down, I feel depressed
The life of the pope remains the same
I'm a new Satan, I'll kill them all
I'm a new Satan, die
I'm a new Satan, I'll kill them all
I'm a new Satan, right

[Chorus:]
Satan, believer
The master of the universe
Satan, believer
The master of the universe
Call me I'm waiting for you in the dead of night
My craving for oppression
Can take your pain and fright
Now you're under my control and see the fright
All the life is stolen or borrowed
I'm a new Satan, I'll kill them all
I'm a new Satan, die
I'm a new Satan, I'll kill them all
I'm a new Satan, right

[Chorus]

I'm a new Satan, 'll kill them all
I'm a new Satan, die
I'm a new Satan, I'll kill them all
I'm a new Satan, right

[Chorus]

I'll come out tonight
I'll take all the power
Death rides on my side
A blood redden shower
