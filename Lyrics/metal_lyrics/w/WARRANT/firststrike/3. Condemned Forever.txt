The vampire's life is hard and tough
He never gets a chance to live
He's a lonely man, without heart for you
He's coming back to you
A killer on the loose
He's reaching out for blood
The enemy of god

[Chorus:]
So little girl watch out tonight
He'll come before it's dawn
He's a sinner without a heart
So ride straight to your home
Condemned forever
He never thinks the same as you
He's a victim of evil
He's on the hunt for girls like you
Creeping around at night
Condemned forever
Hostility is his only friend
The prince of the night
He's gonna destroy your mind
A sinner to you
I'm asking: "is it true"
Always dressed in black
Somewhere on the attack

[Chorus]

Condemned forever...
