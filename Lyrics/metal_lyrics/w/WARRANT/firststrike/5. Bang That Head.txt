Bang that head
Feel the lust, youÂ´re half insane
Blood running through your veins
Your life is bad, you know the pain
But lost forever is your name
You ery, you shout away

[Chorus]

Bang that head and loose your soul
Let aggression out of your heart
You feel the lust is coining up
Never wanna stop
You ery, you shout away
You fly, flying high again
You hear the satans call
YouÂ´re possessed of the devils will
Loose control of your body
Spirit of the metal man
Never failed to shock here

[Chorus]

Bang that head â¦
