Is it only in my mind?
Is it real, or am I blind?
Do I see what the others canât?
Or have I fallen into the dark?

Black and grey, no shades of white
No tunnel ending in a light
Into the dark
Devoid of feeling, feel no shame
The only thing I know is pain
Into the dark
Into the dark

Asylum
So I crawl back
Asylum
So I crawl back

Screaming is the only sound
That lets me know Iâm still alive
And in my mind the darkness thrives
No escape, no turning âround

Asylum
So I crawl back
Asylum
So I crawl back
Asylum, asylum, asylum

Falling into the blackness
Drowning in my own nightmare
Waking brings only terror,
So I crawl back into the dark
