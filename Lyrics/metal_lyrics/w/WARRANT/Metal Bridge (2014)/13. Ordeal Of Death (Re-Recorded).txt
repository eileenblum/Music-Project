Look in the sky the stars are shining bright
But our lives are in danger, days turning to night

A deadly craze

God will set us free
Together we'll be born again

Ordeal of death
Up on the throne
Ordeal of death
Destroying the world
Feel the flames
Got no chance to hide
Ordeal of death
Turnin' out the light

Atomic explosions, our hopes and dreams are lost
Corpses are rotting, are rotting mankind

A lost embrace

God let me be an honest man
Guilt is not on my side

Ordeal of death
Up on the throne
Ordeal of death
Destroying the world
Feel the flames
Got no chance to hide
Ordeal of death
Turnin' out the light

Space is empty mother earth is blown away
Like a wanton vulture the devil takes the rest

No second chance
Souls cry out for revenge
Their words are no use now
