Silence - there is a ritual to be done
Midnight - A casket comes from underground
Howling - moon shines cold up above
Stay out - Stay clear of the graves
Why are you here?
You know the punishment

... The Ritual has begun

Candles - light up holes thru the thickest black
Chanting - phrases, Screaming - praises
Be gone - white magician and mourning wife
This place - no longer welcomes you..

Why are you here?
You know the punishment
... The Ritual has begun

Stand back - or know the consequence
These sights are not yours to see -
They aren't yours to know...

Rise from your bed!
Live, though still dead!
Loose are the powers that lied in the grave
Openlid caskets are freed from their slaves
Bodies now moving, back from the dead
Pray for the living, who are delivered instead

Why did you come?
You know the punishment
... The Ritual has been done.
