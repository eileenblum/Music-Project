Stigmatized!
Step closer if you please...!
My body bares witness, can't you see
You can't deny your own eyes
This must be real... stigmatized!

So you speak to me about proof
But where once was skin now are wounds!
A sceptic life y ou should realize
This blood doesn't lie... stigmatized!

Why have I been chosen to be the manifestation of God?

I cannot take this anymore...!
Not by far believed, only scorned
Please, God, make this go away...
Or take me home
Why have I been chosen to be the manifestation of God?
I never asked for this...
God... set me free!
