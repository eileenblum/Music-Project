There's no meaning with life as it is...
There's no meaning, there's no meaning
There's no such thing as a life after this,
No such thing as an afterlife bliss
Float into oblivion

Born - burn - die
Ashes to ashes and dust to death
Fade away - burn away

Ashes to ashes and dust to death
Pass away - your soul astray

Your hollow words and self-righteous grin -
You're the cancer of this world we're living in
Puss and disease surround your every move...
Your every word... your every word
Dehumanize, manipulate, infiltrate, disintigrate

Ashes to ashes and dust to death
Fade away - burn away
Ashes to ashes and dust to death
Pass away - your sould astray
