Jagged shore face a violent tide,
Total serenity cross the surface lies
The distance may not seem that far,
But the gap spans a lifetime no less no more

Welcome to your parting
I'll take you safely across
That boy can wait,
There's only room for one
See the abscence of my shadow
Yet you know my name
I'm not the one you should fear
To me you're all the same

Dark water stretch a few inches deep
Yet fathomless darkness lays
Right under the keel
It's the end of the journey
But across you must go so shut up,
Sit down and don't rock the boat

It's the eve of your lifetime,
You know ones fate must end
Eternity lies before you,
So now it's time to repent
See the abscence of my shadow
Yet you know my name
I'm not the one you should fear
To me you're all the same

Don't stick your band thru the surface
Yes, there's movements in the deep
... for those aren't really stars up above,
And it's hardly water beneath

Meet the Styx
Not evil, not good
Just a step on the way
You're a step on the way...

Jagged shore face a violent tide
Total serenity cross the surface lies
The distance may not seem that far,
But the gap spans a lifetime no less no more

Welcome to your parting
I'll take you safely across
That boy can wait,
There's only room for one

See the abscence of my shadow,
Yet you know my name
I'm not the one you should fear
To me you're all the same
You're all the same
You're all the same
You're all the same
