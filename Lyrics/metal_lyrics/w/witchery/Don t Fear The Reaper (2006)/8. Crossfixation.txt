Golgata lies silent
And the sand has drunk the blood
Black is the wind which make the crosses sway
Depart your hallowed ground
Life stab-wounds to the skin

Crossfixation
Crossfixation

Human ornamentation, a ghastly vaudeville
Had to entertain the masses
Had to keep them in fear
Crosses lean on these barren hills
Daily tribunals daily kills

Crossfixation
Crossfixation
Crossfixation

Last of days sands of time running fast
Drag my cross through the mob
Whipped and chained
Dying young, dying young, dying young!

Blood and sweat blinds my eyes
No one weeps, no one cares
Count my steps up the hill drag my cross
Drag my cross
Nails are driven deep through my limbs
I'm hung to die, left in the sun to dry!

Crossfixation
Crossfixation
