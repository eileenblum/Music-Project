Unveil the veins that hold the blood
The victim is strapped, the demon is scared -
Quotations are voiced - the holy script
Held in its grip, the victim tosses and turns
Phrases are praised as the candles are burned
Time running short there's a life here at stake
Must hurry fast as the night now awaits...

Draw the blood - that sickens the mind
Draw the blood - let the evil run dry
Suck out the blood - that darkens the soul
Draw the blood - and pray for us all

Profanity reeks - condemning God and us all
Dietys clash - flames rise and fall
A legion of names are called out from the book...
Yet the night is so black, that darkness cooks...
The darkness cooks!

Held in its grip, the victim tosses and turns
Phrases are praised as the candles are burned
Time running short there's a life here at stake
Must hurry fast as the night now awaits!

Draw the blood - that sickens the mind
Draw the blood - let the evil run dry
Suck out the blood - that darkens the soul
Draw the blood - and pray for us all

Draw the blood
Draw the blood
Suck out the blood
Draw the blood
