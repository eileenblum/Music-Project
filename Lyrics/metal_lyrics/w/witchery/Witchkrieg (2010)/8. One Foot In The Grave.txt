I stir underneath of my headstone
As food for maggots I now decompose
You kneel and you weep for my poor soul
I need no tears for where I will go

[chorus:]
Born to burn...
Born to burn...
Born to burn...
Got one foot in the grave, the other in hell

Burn - everything round me is burning
Flames are feeding off of my rotting flesh
Leave! I find your presence disturbing
Save your prayers for I have sold my soul...

[chorus]

[solo: Jim Durkin]

The world is ablaze
Fucking brimstone and flames
From one foot in the grave
To being Satan's slave

Born to burn
Born to burn
Born to burn

From one foot in the grave,
I'm now in hell
