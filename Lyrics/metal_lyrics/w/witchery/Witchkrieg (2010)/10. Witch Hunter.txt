Moon sees the masse
Hidden feast
Spell are read and chants are said...

Witchsmeller, hail!
Save our souls, and god prevail
Bring the witch to the stake and she will burn

Burn, whore of Satan!

[chorus:]
Witch hunter...
Witch hunter...
Witch hunter...
Witch hunter...

Witchsmeller pursuviant
Sweep the land with our trusty
flames of truth

Stand fast in your fight
Cleanse with all your might
Defender of the faith and of our youth

God's will be done...

[chorus x2]

Stalk the night - we stalk your night
Blood'll shed - blood will shed from this corpse
that was you...

Empty veins
