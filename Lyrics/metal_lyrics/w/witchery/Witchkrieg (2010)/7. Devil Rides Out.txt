Who's another fool - who's another tool
Will you be the one for the missions?
Can you see yourself - part of something else
For the love of god and ammunition?

[chorus:]
Fight the righteous fight!
Believe what is right!
Beat that drum - oi!
Beat that drum - oi!
Black stallion of death - the devil rides out

Come and fill our ranks - win imperial thanks
Earn yourself a seat with the victor!
Time to settle the score - nothing like before
Climb the wall and storm now and forever more...

[chorus]

Lock and load your gun - barrage has begun
Hold your breath and wait for the signal...

Generals have their fun - "Do you duty, son!"
Unit on the map is just a symbol
Mud in your mouth - what's it all about?
Can you count the holes in your body?
Who is friend or foe - brothers I don't know
Could you wave that flag one more time for me!

[chorus]

Black stallion of death...

Scarred stallion of fear...

Black stallion of death...

He rides out to war...
