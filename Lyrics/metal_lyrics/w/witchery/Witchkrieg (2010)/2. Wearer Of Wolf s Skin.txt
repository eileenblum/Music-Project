Lick the teeth, bloodthirst when the moon is round
Starry night, we search our hunting ground
On we slay - human prey
Tearing and biting, shearing and smiting

[chorus:]
Wearer of wolf's skin
Wearer of wolf's skin

Silent howl, ravenous hunger deep inside
Yellow eyes, pack mentality in disguise
Gnashing fangs, the erd I decimate
Paw and claw, ...dig deep the dirt

[chorus]

This hunger is mine, this hunger is mine it burns divine
You cannot take my hunger away

This is who I am, and this is what I'll stay
No silver bullet, nor Jesus Christ, will make it go away

Scary from the herd, stray from the word
