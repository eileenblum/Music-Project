Riding across the heavens, the moon is full and round
Chasing down his victims, but their bodies... will not be found...

Drumming hooves of vengeance, the silent killer strikes
People hiding in their homes, but he knows... where you hide

[chorus:]
Reaver - the reaver - is on your trail
Reaver - the reaver - he will not fail, so know... you time is up

Darker than a shadow, blacker than the night
Feel his fingers round your throat, you know... it's time to die

Turn around to run it's the only thing to do
Someone's about to die, and that someone... is you!

[chorus]

Reaver - he cuts, he spears, he mains, he shears, he kill... he is the...
Reaver - he hunts, he finds, he rips, he binds... he will bring - you - down!
