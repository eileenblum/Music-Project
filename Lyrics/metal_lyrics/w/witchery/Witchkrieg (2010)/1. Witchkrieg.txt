Satan - around the flames the troops now fly
Hordes of death - cover the earth
Nationwide crematory
The feeble and meek - end of story
Open the gates - and lacerate the sky

Wings now fly - to reap all life
Damnation's bell - come forth... lords of Hell!

[chorus:]
Witchkrieg!
Witchkrieg!

Congregations, die side by side
In mounting heaps - rotting angel now lie

[chorus]

Christ is now our slave... mother Mary now our whore...

[solo: Kerry king]

[chorus]
