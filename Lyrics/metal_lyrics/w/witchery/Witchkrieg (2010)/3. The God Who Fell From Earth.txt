Who are these people? And what is this ritual?
Have I really have been away for so long?
They've turned their backs on, once loved icons...
... but the god you left is now back

[chorus:]
Behold! - it's the god who fell from earth
Enter now this world
Retake what is yours, and seize the golden throne
Greet the god who fell from earth!

Men are fleeting, for their sons and daughters are bleeding...
One should never forget the gods... sound out my triumphant return

[chorus]

[solo: Hank Shermann]

[chorus]

The god who fell from earth could be you...
