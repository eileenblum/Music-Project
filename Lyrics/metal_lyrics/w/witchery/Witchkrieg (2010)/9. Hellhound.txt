Drumming paws fill the night
- stay low, stay outta sight
Mark of prey came a birth
- Canine horror sweep the earth

[chorus:]
Hellhound on your trail
Hellhound on your trail

The hunt - draws - closer...

Thought you're quicker, thought you're smart
- can't move faster than the dark
The Devil'll fight you tooth and nail
- put the hellhound on your trail

[chorus x2]

Snapping jaws, the devil's might
Hellhound on your trail...
