[solo: Andy LaRocque]

Sneak up to the cemetery gates
They swing open without a sound
Hurry over to the funeral mound

Rain makes thehair cling to the face
Darkest night but as lightning cracks
Empty the bag of shovels and axes

The earth is soft underneath the leaves
Remove the dirt, we dig with ease

[chorus:]
Dead - dead - dead - dead - dead to worse
There are things worse than death,
far more worse than death

So it's done, time to lift the lid
It creaks open, and there it lays
The corpse is prepped and we sing the praise

Slowly stepping out of the grave
Fill the night with nocturnal scrams, it screams

On our command, the body climbs from the grave
Once dormant and dead, now forever our slave

[chorus]

From the grave - now death escaped - life retake once more
Walk the earth - an antibirth - see death reversed undone

[solo: Andy LaRocque]

There are things worse than death,
far more worse than death

Worse - dead to worse
