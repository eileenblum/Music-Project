galloping hard fear in my eyes
whipping the creature down between my thighs
thunderous sound rumbles close from behind
closing the gap and me they shall find

the hooves hammer hard on the trail
i've got the devil on my tail
on a black horse thru hell

a demon snarls the posse from hell
a sulfuric wind tells me to beware
me a man who has sold his own soul
racing thru flames to flee from this hole

the hooves hammer hard on the trail
i've got the devil on my tail
on a black horse thru hell

the jaws of death snap at my feet 
will i be able to burst thru the gate 
i cling to my saddle and say my last prayer
now i am trapped in the evil eyes glare

on a black horse thru hell
on a black horse thru hell
the hooves hammer hard on the trail
i've got the devil on my tail
