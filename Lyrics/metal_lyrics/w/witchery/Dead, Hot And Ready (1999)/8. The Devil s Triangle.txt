lo and behold the captain's struck by fear
all hands on deck a storm astern us nears

the raging waters our ship is covered by sea
will we survive the surge from beneath?

all's wet and freezing the waves are five storeys high
reef all the sails better struggle to save your lives

the raging waters our ship is covered by sea
will we survive the surge from beneath?

all is calm at the eye of the storm 
the sea is black like glass
a few of us who are still alive 
see the wind start picking up fast
a sailor is tied fast to the helm
his predecessor died on his post
this vessel is now but a floating wreck
it will never bring us back to the coast

the raging waters our ship is covered by sea
will we survive the surge from beneath?

the devils triangle!
the devils triangle!
