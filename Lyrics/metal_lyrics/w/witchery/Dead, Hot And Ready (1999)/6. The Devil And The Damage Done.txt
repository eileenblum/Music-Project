say that you love me you fool
call me the devil its true
if you sell me your soul i win
if you live in the dark you sin

onward with the wolf you run
the devil and the damage done
damage done

bring me your children they'll burn 
never look back never turn
reach out and touch me you'll see
to run with the wolves you're free

onward with the wolf you run
the devil and the damage done
who are you to flee the sun
the devil and the damage done

its time go welcome to my home
you scream my name
i'll dress you up in flames
you sold your soul
this is what you bought 
i hope you like it 'cause i've heard its rather hot

onward with the wolf you run
the devil and the damage done
who are you to flee the sun
the devil and the damage done

if you sell me your soul
if you live in the dark
the devil and the damage done
