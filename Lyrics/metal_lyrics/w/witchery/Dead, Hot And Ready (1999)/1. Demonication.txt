demons - like whirlwind through your soul
no escape - through the flesh
like a razor to the bone

far from grace-hells hot embrace
demonication

angels - flee like lambs when approached by the wolf
hunters - of the damned
will devour your faith
they kill without a trace

far from grace - hells hot embrace
demonication

the diabolical force - the minions of death awaits
an army of wrath - join the ranks of stink and hate

far from grace - hells hot embrace
demonication
demonication
demonication
