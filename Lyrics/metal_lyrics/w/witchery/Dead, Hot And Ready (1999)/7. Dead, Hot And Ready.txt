the soil is moist and the night is damp and cold
the gate swing open as i trespass over bones 
trespass over bones!

i find the grave where the slut eternally lies
she can't escape me even six feet from her life

this place will witness something heavy
'cause she's dead hot and ready

this place will witness something heavy
'cause she's dead hot and ready

the chapel bell strikes twelve 
and the lid is opened
the cold bitch's face stares blindly at the stars
once forever inhumed no signs of putrefaction
the body is intact quoting the necronomicon
startles the corpse 
rise!

her lustful ways made me a hungry man
now i'm back to claim what death took from my hand
she thought she find a way to rid herself of me
but my love is stronger than she had foreseen

i know she's dead hot and ready

rise you fucking slut!
