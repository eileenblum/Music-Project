one hour left to live one hour 'til i die
i should be walking free yet still here i now lie

receive the blessing of the blade
the guillotine

misjudged and sentenced for a crime i did not do
accused of witchcraft and for raping one
or two

Receive the blessing of the blade
the guillotine

the masses cheer I climb the stairs
i hope for mercy but salvation's nowhere near
just one word from being forced to join the headless dead

strapped into place with a basket at my head
i hear the whisper now of the blade
slicing the air

receive the blessing of the blade
the guillotine
