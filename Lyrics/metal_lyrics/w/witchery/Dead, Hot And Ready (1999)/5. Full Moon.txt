both man and beast infest the heavens with all profane
forever held as the least
by the circle of the lunar
damn - all - who damned shall be
you've all forsaken the ways of the unseen
- of the unseen

another moon crowns the sky
so perfect white and cold it shines
as first and last it reigns
as first and last unstained

cloak and dagger - we hide the sands of time
for the faith has now ceased
as the twilight is unleashed
damn - all - who damned shall be
you've all forsaken the ways of the unseen
-o f the unseen

another moon crowns the sky
so perfect white and cold it shines
as first and last it reigns
as first and last unstained

a biblical sign at the end of time
moon shines red
nowhere to run there is nowhere to hide
behold the wakening of the dead
- of the dead

be sure to pray
salvation - from high above
not from god and his angels
but from the moon and its calling

another moon crowns the sky
so perfect white and cold it shines
as first and last it reigns
as first and last unstained
