another night another call
the coven meets again - meets again
to give our praise to conjure hell
we laugh as we cast a spell

its a call of the coven
the time is right the devil oh be thy name
let the night become untamed

the time is black but we feel bold
tonight we sell our souls
we sell our souls
another spell another chant
we deserve to burn in flames

its a call of the coven
the time is right the devil oh be thy name
let the night become untamed

candlelights - witches rites
churches burn - crosses turn

sacrifice - in the night
blasphemy - angels flee

a candle lit a demon cries
someones about to die
the demons cry
spirits in rage fires grow high
the witches now engage

its a call of the coven
the time is right the devil oh be thy name
let the night become untamed
