Starting with a whisper, deep in the night
Jumping from the rooftops - they swarm in evil might
Clawing at your window, clawing at your door
Lusting for your blood and they only want more

[Chorus:]

Obey and raise the gilded fang
Together, we will bleed the land

Bitten by a bearer, smitten by their thirst
Driven by a hunger, that'll make your jugular burst
Trapped in a corner, you know you cannot flee
Bid farewell to your sanity

[Chorus]

Feel the fever burn, burn in your veins
Feel the hunger yearn, slowly go insane
Feel the fever burn...
Feel the fever burn...

Running with the pack now your former life has past
You are now immortal, learn the Hunter's craft
Can you hear them singing?
The creatures of the night
Praise the gilded fang, bask in its might

[Chorus]
