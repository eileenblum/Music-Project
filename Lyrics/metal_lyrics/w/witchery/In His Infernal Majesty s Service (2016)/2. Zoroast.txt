There's a breeze in the midnight air
Eyes are weary but still I stare
Atop a tower I hold my watch
For planets in line and suns that burst

Aaaarrrgh... Bring forth the undoing of this world
Ba'al, Lord, claim thy prize!!

[Chorus:]
The sky is never what it seems
Stars align, the end of time
The Beasts' they live inside your dreams
There's a full moon rising

Studies burn the midnight oil
Over charts and algebra I pour
My work parades the signs from God
Come save thy servant, oh Ba'al!

Come forth the signs beyond our Earth
Blessed Ba'al and Marduk, for thee I search

[Chorus]
