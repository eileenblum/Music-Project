Villagers gathered 'round the witches trail
Holds the signs of mass hysteria
Women scorned, and kinds accused
Reason is left when the mob's to rule
A trial is held, a travesty
A show of power from the ministry

Neighbor rat on neighbor as the act of a devout
Eager to seem more pious so they sell each other out
Accusations, to vilify
Perjury to save your life
Random acts of heresy
Heinous accounts of devilry

So burn
By the powers vested in me
God's will be done, zealously

Verbal abuse roars from the stands
Once on trial there's no legal chance
Faith is held at the maximum
Praise the Lord, his will be done
So-called victims made to testify
Bearing witness of the Devil's might

So burn
By the powers vested in me
God's will be done, tirelessly

"In the year of our Lord June 2nd, 1692,
I, William Stoughton, chief magistrate of this Grand Jury,
find you all guilty, as charged, of acts of witchcraft and heresy.
I sentence you all to be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.
May God have mercy on your souls."

So burn
By the powers vested in me
God's will be done, endlessly
