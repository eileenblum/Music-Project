Bend forward and uncover your arms
This will only take a second
Little girl, there's no need for alarm, approach the tub
When you're beckoned

Gather round the young ones now
They will make you stronger
Hold the key to immortal life
Wither away no longer

[Chorus:]
Aaaarrrrrgh....
Wash the countess, in warm blood
Elizabeth Bathory

Oh but hey, wipe those tears away
You want to follow your friends, don't you?
They're back below, playing outside the keep
Now hurry up to join them

Maybe you'd want to look away?
But see, it was almost painless
You feel sleepy, yes, so please have nap
Join your friends slumbering dreamless

[Chorus]

See the steam from the gilded tub rise
The taste the metal is rich in the air
Candles barely lit the darkened room
As the inner door swings open

Enter Countess, and drop your robe
Slip into the pool of life
Hold the chalice, above your head
Baptize yourself a beautiful red

Aaaaahhh... rise up and behold your reflection
Drenched in blood, a woman of perfection

[Chorus]
