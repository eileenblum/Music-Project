Grab that rifle and buckle that strap
Keep your head down and prepare to attack
A million men are waiting along the line
A million men are waiting along to die for... what!?

When you hear that whistle sound the guns will roar - like never before
So get up, get out and gain that ground - now!
Not a single step back - attack!

[Chorus:]
Feed the gun
I said hey
Feed the gun

Starring out at no man's land, the darkness rips apart - and the shelling starts
Mausers and the Maxims rip through swaths of men
Not a single step back - defend!

[Chorus]

Feed the gun
I said hey
Feed the gun

[Chorus:]
Feed the gun
Dry bones will litter this ground
Feed the gun
A nationwide funeral mound
