Who are you to break the oath?
You know the punishment...
The sentence has been cast
A traitor will never last

No one will stand in our way
Victory will be ours
We wait just out of sight
You will know when our - time has come

[Chorus:]
An oath is sworn - do what has to be done...

An oath is sworn, the dice are cast
Each day might be our last

Hidden signs with hidden consequence
Whispered words and blind obedience - blind obedience

[Chorus]

Order - the time of consequence has come
Execute - approach the traitor as one

Candles burn - daggers jab - curses heard
Silence falls - a life is had - the oath is all

[Chorus]
