Winged godless creatures they fill the blackest night
Vandals of divine no rush of evil might
A frightening streak of rampage
Screams of pain and death
They're swarming all around
Nowhere to catch your breath

[Chorus:]
Wicked spirits around us storming
Will we ever survive their closing attack

With buzzsaw razor anger they slice and cut their way
Breeding hate and chaos brings forth the final day

[Chorus]

Blasphemic martyrs oblivious to mercy
Voracious icons submit to an unstoppable force

[Chorus]

Will we survive!
Will we survive!
We we survive the attack!
