Standing next to a shallow grave
Vacant for now but not during day
The stench is foul like lived in by beast
Who now left his hole amongst the deceased

[Chorus:]
A threat to our kind
Something older than time
Something evil has taken its say in this vacant shallow grave

Hiding next to a shallow grave
Dawn is near we need to stay brave
Grasping our arms we tremble with fear
A noise reveal something draws near

[Chorus:]
A threat to our kind
Something older than time
Something evil lives in this vacant shallow grave

Sneaking out of its hideous lair
Devouring the flesh of
Let none be spared
Hunger of the undead
Let it perish in flames
Death is certain
Darkness descends

[Chorus:]
A threat to our kind
Something older than time
Vicious evil lives
Unholy abominations
A frantic desecration
Vacant Shallow Grave
