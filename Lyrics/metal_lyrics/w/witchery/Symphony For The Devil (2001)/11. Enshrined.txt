I have to die for my sins
Final rest recieving salvation

Lost and hollow trapped within lorn at last
Come tomorrow there I lay a shadow past

Guide my way a path unseen
My soul astray shivering
The end serene

[Chorus:]
Into the realm of my tomb
Underneath a darkened moon
Seal the senses from pain
Enshrined off in vain
I embrace my doom!

I close my eyes
Commit the dead
I drain my blood
Eternal sleep
Come tomorrow
Shivering here I lay
Dark and hollow
A shadow past
A soul astray

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
