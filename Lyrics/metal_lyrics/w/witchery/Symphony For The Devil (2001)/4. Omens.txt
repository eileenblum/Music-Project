Empty streets wihtout a sound
Doors are locked no life is found
Anticipation the moon is round
God forsaken this little town

[Chorus:]
Velled in dusk
Velled in dusk
You can't stop hiding from the omens!

Visitors now often sighted
But long dead guests are not invited
Candles lit though not ignited
Flicker and move as if excited

[Chorus]

Signs of movement amidst the grave
A churchbell chimes no one's to blame
Silent prayers are hasty spoken
Wish the dawn would now be broken

[Chorus]
