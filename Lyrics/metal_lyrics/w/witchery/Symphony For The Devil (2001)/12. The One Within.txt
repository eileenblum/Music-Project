Barren plains unholy ground
A silent scream darkness abound
Mythical rhymes spoken by few
Fiendish uprising a legend come true?

[Chorus:]
Ungodly pleasures mortal sins
Feeding the one within
Rise again Rise again

Inverted crosses bloodstained sand
Ancient symbols carved in hand
Godless creatures odium fortold
Devoured by vermin a corpse without soul

[Chorus]

Risen from below
Captor of your soul
For beyond retrieve
Forsaken by your god

Barren plains unholy ground
A silent scream darkness abound
Close the circle nocturnal feast
upon the flesh hellhounds unleashed

[Chorus]
