Stand back and behold the wrath
The eye of the storm second to none
Magnificent power supreme
Gracing the skies and trembling the ground

[Chorus:]
Deleted horizon
Earth torn to shreds
Diabolical storm of the end

Rushing forth a blackened wall
A whirlwind of anger God save us all
It's the sign of the southern cross
Ashes to dust - Ashes to dust

[Pre-Chorus:]
A wind with sulferic debris
Blows hard
Rages violently

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

The Storm
The Storm
The Storm
