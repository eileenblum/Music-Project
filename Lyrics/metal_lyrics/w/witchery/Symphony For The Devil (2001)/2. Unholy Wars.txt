Oh Witching hour!
Un masse we fly the air unseen we fill the night
We shoot into the gap to a place that soon won't be
No saint no single soul will live their eternity

In legion we fly
In thousands they cry
The streets of gold will run with blood

[Chorus:]
Unholy Wars!
Unholy Wars!

Behold the flames grow strong
We raid and scorch a path to death we do belong
Countermeasures blown away God's army in defeat
Scattered now across the skies by angels of deceit

In legion we fly
In thousands they cry
The streets of gold are drenched in blood

[Chorus]

Rest not 'til all are caught until the last is found
Under one command we hail and kill as one
We rush and scale the walls
We flood the sacred streets
Salvation is no more the surrender of the meek
Abolish the laws of God and so the trinity

Unholy Wars on bloodsoaked shores
Unholy Wars fought at God's frontdoor
