We've been diggin' this grave for hours n'hours
Hiding ourselves from the light
Open this casket to feed the beast
A sacrifice done in the night
Howling wolves at a brightful moon
A shadow flys across the sky
Whispering voices chants a eerie tune
"Hurry up and dig" you fool
A ressurection in the dead of night
The secret earthing of the dead is right
Midnight at the graveyard
Our footsteps hammer on the coffinlid
Gently we both clear up the dirt
A foul scent of death, the stench of rotten flesh
Was that a moan from beneath that I heard?
Rise from the grave!
The rain beats done but now the time has come
We place the corpse down on the ground
Preparing the rite, but I feel something is wrong
Now the body has open it's eyes
A ressurection in the dead of night
The secret earthing of the dead is right
Midnight at the graveyard
Midnight at the graveyard
