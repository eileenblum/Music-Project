I'm the almighty,
the king of the kills
Armageddons father,
I'm lurking in darkness,
ready to take your body and your soul

The Reaper, the Reaper
I'm coming to get you
The Reaper, the Reaper
prepare to die!

Don't try to escape,
I'm hunting you down
holding you tight in my grip
kissing the steel,
the flash of my blade gleaming in your stare

The Reaper, the Reaper
I'm coming to get you
The Reaper, the Reaper

I'm the almighty,
the king of the kills
Armageddons father
kissing the steel,
the flash of my blade gleaming in your stare
