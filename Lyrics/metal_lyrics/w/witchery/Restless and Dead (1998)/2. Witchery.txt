The moon is full tonight,we gather round the flame
The candles burn so bright,we start to chant thy name
Satana
The circle starts to glow, hear the spirits scream
A demon from below, black - with eyes that gleam
Witchery - in the misty candle light
An incantation of the dark
Witching hour!
A vibration fills the air, we fall into a trance
We sense someone's here,who have we conjured this time
Satana
Witchery - in the misty candle light
An incantation of the dark
Witching hour!
Witchery
