Howling moon and a rapid nightfall
Cold hard death and chanting spell
For the dead to be risen from their deep slumber
The grave shall be open to free who's under
We're the restless - and the Dead
Dead people walking thru the sanctuary
A scream comes from one of the graves still buried
The light in the window shows the priest has heard us
Alltolate for the tombs are now open and empty
We're the restless - and the Dead
Hunger - for the flesh of the people who are still alive
Open grave - the Dead will rise
Rise!
We're the restless - and the Dead
