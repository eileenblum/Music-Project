Hell - storms hard
Rampant evil cloud the skies
Creatures - sing
As they praise the unborn child
Famine and plague
Race thru out the world
On wings of damnation
There's a fire in the sky
Behold the riders in the night
With fear we whisper their names
War and death - famine and plague
Prophecies
Forfilled with cold precision
Seas of blood - predict mankinds extinction
War and death
Unleash the terror
With divine intervention
There's a fire in the sky
Behold the riders in the night
With fear we whisper their names
War and death - famine and plague
There's a fire in the sky
Behold the riders in the night
With fear we whisper their names
War and death - famine and plague
