Down by the cemetary
Lies a house, where evil roams free
The rooms are silent, but you better beware
A thousand souls have perrished in there
As you turn to stone
And you loose your head
As he takes your soul
The walls turn red - bloodshed
The smell of brimstone and the clanging of chains
(the) Hooks into flesh - to tear and to maim
(a) Bloodshowergush - the walls turn red
This ritual doesn't end just 'cause the body is dead
As you turn to stone
And you loose your head
As he takes your soul
The walls turn red - bloodshed
The house is empty, another night has gone
A deathlike silence - the deed is done
The doors are open - "please step inside"
An hour remains to the rising of the bloodtide
As you turn to stone
And you loose your head
As he takes your soul
The walls turn red - bloodshed
