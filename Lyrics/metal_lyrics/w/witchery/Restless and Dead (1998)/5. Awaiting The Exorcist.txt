Bring the infant, who speaks in tounge
An exorcism, shall soon be done
Bannish the evil, that rules this child
I hope the priest will hurry to come
We'll provoke the demons of sin
Awaiting the exorcist
Cast out this presence within
We tie her down, for the sake of her own
Or she will injure herself to her death
Unaware of what the future will bring
The demon smiles and starts to scream
We'll provoke the demons of sin
Awaiting the exorcist
Cast out this presence within
We'll provoke the demons of sin
Awaiting the exorcist
Cast out this presence within
Awaiting the exorcist
We'll provoke the demons of sin
Awaiting the exorcist
Cast out this presence within
