I'm the Executioner
I shall not rest - 'til you're put away
Mercy is just a word to me
Walk through life - on a trial of death
Outta my way!
I'm the Executioner
I shall not rest - 'til you're put away
Mercy is just a word to me
Walk through life - on a trial of death
Step aside!
Hunting and killing and searching and finding
and stabbing and choking my victims to death
Turning their eyes to flash of my blade
It's the last thing they see as I sever their heads
I'm the executioner
I shall not rest - 'til you're put away
Mercy is just a word to me
Walk through life - on a trial of death
Eat this!
Fucker!
