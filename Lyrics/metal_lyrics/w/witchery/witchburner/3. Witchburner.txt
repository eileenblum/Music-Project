Moonfog - a churchbell chimes
Burning - flames of the stakes grow high
Castigation - of an inquisition
A witch - that'll soon be no more
A soul - forever bannished by the lord
She's in league with Satan, she must be burned
So let it be written, so let it be done
Screaming - out cries - of witchery
But none do dare defy, the inquisory
By the powers of the ministry
She's in league with satan, she must be burned
So let it be written, so let it be done
She's in league with satan, she must be burned
so let it be written, so let it be done
