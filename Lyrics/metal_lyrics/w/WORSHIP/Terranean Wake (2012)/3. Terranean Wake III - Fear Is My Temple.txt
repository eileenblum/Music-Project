I know no light
And no salvation
I can't remember how to live
I knew before
Now there's nothing
It blackens all

Fear is my temple
Crushing down
Burning me alive
Beyond all hope

I will not run - what for?
I bring my own darkness
Can't bring myself to look at the sky
I know it's no longer there

Est-ce la voie que j'ai choisi?
Tout n'est que noirs marÃ©cages
Et toutes ses sombres eaux
Ne pourront me sauver du bÃ»cher

[Is this the way that I have chosen?
Everything is black swamp
And all its dark waters
Can not save me from the pyre]

Fear is my temple...

There dire corridors
Go right through me
My endless prison
Always, me
