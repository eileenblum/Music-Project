We were waste monuments
Blind vermin and deluded kings

We rise: We leave
Our shattered reign
Undone: We leave
And leave no trace

Forever we never had
We had grain we threw away

Le paysage se dÃ©sagrÃ©ge vers le Ã©toiles, s'Ã©tirant
comme sortant d'un sommeil millÃ©naire, comme
une feuilie immense dans les mains d'un dieu
que nous n'avons jamais eu.  Et enfin je vois...
nous fÃ»mes trop fous pour voir.

[The landscape disintegrates to the stars, stretching
as post-millennial sleep, as
???? huge one in the hands of god
that we never had. And finally I see ...
we were too crazy to see.]

Our fingers fail to hold on
To any morsel nothing shall last

We rise...

Nothing matters given time
Our fleeting towers blink of any eye

There is no atonement
No sense, no revelation
Our Last farewell
Into oblivion
