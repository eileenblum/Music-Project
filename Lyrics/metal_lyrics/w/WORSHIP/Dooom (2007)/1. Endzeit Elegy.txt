A bed of stone
To wake upon
To a world long dead

May this sight strike me blind
Lest I envy the dead
Let my bones melt to earth
To cease and forget

In brittled cloth
A grave of rock
Above the world's remains

[Qorban:]
"I broke the surface of a lifetime of sleep,
or so I felt. For minutes I couldn't will my aching bones to move,
to rise from my bed of stone, or my gaze to bend from the tomb of rock above me.
I willed my body over the edge and crushed to the floor below.
Through a mist of pain I started to see: I was imprisoned.
A forboding fright dawned in me, as I slowly struggled to free myself from my own grave.
It seemed my limbs would burst before I was free,
but finally at the very end of my strength I could see the world beyond,
and to my horror - It was no more!"

I have lost to sleep
Man's final days
Now to awake
Just to be tortured by grief
