I reached the core
Once the peak of life
The bleeding eyes
Of empty shells

A shattered vision
The failure that was man
Higher spires
Deeper
Graves

Graveyard horizon
Whence my eyes can't flee
Every ruin
Is convicting me
They all, as one

Her voice foremost
Too dead to bear
Fingers damn
Then crumble to dust
Their touch is stone
The present past
Passed away
As life is lost

[Qorban:]
"In the dead city, only the echoes of my steps are alive.
Like in a dream, I entered a shattered and half-buried house through its gaping eyeholes.
Inside a body of rags and ashes, she's long dead, unknown, forgotten.
I wipe the dirt from my wet eyes but I can hardly see.
Look! A brittle newspaper! This...cannot be,
it's all a mad...unending nightmare!
These voices...I did nothing! Nothing, you hear me? Leave me alone!"

You live
Where we are doomed
To die
You must reveal
Our secret bane
