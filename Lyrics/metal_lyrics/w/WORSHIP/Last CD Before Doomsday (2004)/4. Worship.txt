On the way to redemtion
Through the path of destruction
There are no ways to look back
Darkness is already here...

Verdamnis und vergebung
In den Armen der Leere
Wiedergeburt in Schmerz
[English translation:
Condemnation and forgiveness
In the arms of nothingness
Rebirth in agony]

...we have no way to escape
We would like to live one more day
To feel sorrow one more day...

The masochism of our life
Is realism of death !!!
How could we forget
The pain we gave to nature ???

Now we have to pay
To pay with our lives

Kill yourself and Worship...
