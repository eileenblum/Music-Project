Cast your stone into the water now
And watch the ripples spread like poison
Under the gun, underneath
You'll feel slaughtered and betrayed

I know you put your trust in Heaven's arms
Happiness enroots your being
It's said that purple would open up your mind
How come all I see is black and white?

Anything that's made with heart and soul
Comes with a price not worth to pay
All those years and years I struggled, too
I'll be your hero and saint
It's said that purple would open up your mind
How come all I see is black and white?
It gets us down

Walk courageously into the fire
No sense but bliss
Twisted til we'll die
Magic ritualistics in the pyre
The flames go out, but you are rising higher

Destroy the one it takes you to compete
The winners in the game, you will defeat
Your strange consciousness you restored
The Bible is the ultimate deception

It's said that purple would open up your mind
How come all I see is black and white?
It gets us down
