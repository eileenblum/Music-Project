He was a leader
You were a believer
see where it took you
You canât get away

If you pass away too early
you dont need to worry
Who will you follow
When your son has turned away

Karma works in reaverse
whirling an swirling its way
Automatic wisdom
Inherent but deranged

Nihilistic viewers
believe in their true ways
Confused and decedant
They give in to their fraud

The animal kingdom
An alternative to freedom
Awaken in your nightmare
of paradise demise

Blissfull but not content
Overjoyed with sentiment
All the world is a place
for a mind to waste

Preaching for the deaf
Hypocrisy what's left

Blissfull but not content
Overjoyed with sentiment
All the world is a place
for a mind to waste
