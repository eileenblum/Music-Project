Wishes of your mind girl
Are the same thatâs in your head
Evil thoughts are evil
Too much wine to go with your bread
Paranoid by confusion
The blood is the reign in your home [?]
The ghosts hides in the passage
Damn spirits over here
Donât comá¹lain, donât threat again
Never say a word
Isolation and frustration, faced your foes

Can you hear the silence, fighting with the wind?
Numbed by the illusion, that nature is a wind
Flying trees canât handle needs
Waiting for your call
In this kingdom, queens are ruling, all for you all

Donât complain, donât threat again
Never say a word
Isolation and frustration, faced your foes
