Tell me now who's without sin
Tell me who has never repent
Legend has it, legend is true
But nothing really compares with you

It disintegrate in your ocean of uncertain beliefs
The waves of your sea must be run by a complex without me

Paint me a picture of peace and understanding
Make sure the details stand out like a warning

The paradox of this war
It runs so deep

This chosen path
It's all a bloody steep

The shining light of the gods
It's made out of nothing

Brutally raped by philosopher's
Worn out mundane tales

Take your hands off me
I cannot let it go
Let this mantra speak
Emotions overflow

Self-combustion
Homeopathic turns

A dead end and a curse
Imploding universe

Take your hands off me
I cannot let it go
Let this mantra speak
Emotions overflow
