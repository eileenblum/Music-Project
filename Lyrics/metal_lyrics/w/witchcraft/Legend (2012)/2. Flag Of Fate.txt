Lonely years
And twenty days
All since when
We parted ways

No tears or no joy
No looking back
Strange intense
Strange immense

The flag of fate
Was waving by
It shoved its face
Deep into mine

All motion of thoughts
This chain of loss
Is binding me
It eats and gnaws

Commence the funeral
Its playing in my mind
All precious memories
Are turning their blind eye

Commence the funeral
Its playing in my mind
All precious memories
Are turning their blind eye

I saw it coming
