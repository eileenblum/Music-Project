Say me mister officer, what is it that you want from me?
I'm just another brick in this fascist regime society

I stand naked and abused

Utopian idealist breaking ways for all to see
Deconstructed patterns manifest in broken helpless souls
Inspiration draws her source from a muse, that's mute and disconnected
Suspicion and coalition holding hands when trust is gone

Satan is amused

If all the love descended from above
The altruistic ones
Would cherish in their hearts
Decide and conduct
Correct your misconduct
Be brave and be strong
Do no other wrong

Definition of your mission is rules it lasts eternally
Tell me why then I am unaffected (the) gravity

Tension blows the fuse
