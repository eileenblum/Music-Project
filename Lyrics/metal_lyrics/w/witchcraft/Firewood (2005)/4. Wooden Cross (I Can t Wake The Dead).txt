Give me a wooden cross
Someone is waiting to be crucified
Don't let him wait too long
His weakened powers will grow strong

I cannot wake the living dead
Since they are already alive
Standing next to me
Witness the beauty in the tragedy

Look at the ones grinning wide sitting in the government
So self-assured but we all know power is in the wrong man's hands

They have plans for all mankind they'll rot now one by one
They'll freeze and they will bleed there is no chosen one

I cannot wake the dead
Since they are already alive
Dancing skeletons scream
Apostles of Lucifer's dream
