Through my window I think of you
It's not a problem as long as you are gone
Why do you do this, cause me all this harm
I never want to see that place again

Sorrow evoker pain bringing witch
Today I'm wiser, I see my part
You musn't think like you used to do
You shouldn't judge me before you think

Time is but a melody
Subjective, twisted like reality
Lovely tears wash away the stain
Memories, wonderful summer rain

Spread in the wind all is forgotten
Nothing left but traces in the snow
Embraces just for caring
Here we go touch the broken wing
