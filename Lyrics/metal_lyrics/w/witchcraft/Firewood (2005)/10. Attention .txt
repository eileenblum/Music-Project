Sometimes it feels like I don't have a heart
Just a rock or a stone that's been torn apart
Oh, you told me it hurts...
But you never told me it burns!

Warmed by the fire the heat was intense
Then cracked by the cold a stone cannot mend
Oh, you told me it hurts
But you never told me it gets worse

Over the hills and far away is were you are
Distant and remote just like a fallen star
My love for you was something new and beautiful
