I see a man
He's doing all he can
Oh he's working hard
To create a life

If you leave him now
Then he will cry
If you let him go
Inside he will die

From my past life
I've got the stone here
It will guide me now
Through this hate and fear

You killed me then but never again 
This time I am strong like a storm force ten
Freedom bleeds freedom blood
Don't you think that I understood- I love you

So I set sail
Around the planet babe
Don't need your wishing well
Now your love will tell
