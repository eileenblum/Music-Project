Out in the streets where the light turns into night
I walk alone with a feeling that I never be alright
A heart of gold now has turned into a heart of stone
Amidst the haze never have I felt so alone

Come back baby, come back and make my life whole
You turned your back and left me down stone cold
I wanted you to heed me, heed me forever
I lost a friend and a supposed lover

Through the haze I've come to change
I have the power to rearrange
I am the master I control my dreams
Blast away the nightmare screams

Go away, stay away
Don't come back, don't come home
Let me be, set me free
Let me breathe again

From the start you said you thought you really had doubts
But you kept on going, fumbling in darkness and chaos
