Spend too much time to learn your rules
Got no time to see through the fools
I wasn't born to sympathise
With bad people and their lies

They want our thoughts overshadowed
They steal our time with their dirty games
We're so easily controlled
Perhaps that's what we want to be

Oh oh, if wishes they were horses
I know that beggars they would ride
Is it not we who bear the crosses
Of this society's pride

Down to the bone we are all equal
Can't you learn from your history
Man weren't made out of clay
We are all born the same way
