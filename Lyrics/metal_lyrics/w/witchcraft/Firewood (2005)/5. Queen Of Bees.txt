Queen of bees you suck my life forever
Weaving dreams like a fairy spider
You look so sweet are you what you seem
So young and bright you shine you light lover

Am I betrayed by my own perception
I see love is it my obsession
Queen of dance, dance my blues away
The little of joy will it come to stay

I see a light where the wind blows
How can I find only my god knows

You were my high you were my everything
Now we both died I stand here with nothing

Is it true do I really sing about you
It could might as well be about someone else
Look around you're not the center of the world
They say truth lies within this word
