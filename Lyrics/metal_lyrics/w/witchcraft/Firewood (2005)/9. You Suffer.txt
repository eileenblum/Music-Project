Point your finger at someone else
If not so then at yourself
Everyone cannot be like you
I know you know but you act like two

I thought it was time to have this conversation
Between two eyes about truth or dare
I see you can't understand my situation
But you're too damn blind to even care

Not too long before you drive me mad
You're the worst nightmare I've ever had
It's so good to feel I know where you are
Far away from me I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
