Your dreams be like the snake in cage
Within four walls I scream in rage
I twist and I writhe underneath your throne
You think you're a king but you're all alone
See I have lots of things to say
Matches will change now from this age
Trip on me so I can walk
I seek my vengeance when you talk
Oh you talk so slowly
That is just fine with me
Day will soon come to an end
Silence you baby is my best friend
Now you'll see just why I live
I got to take back what you once killed
