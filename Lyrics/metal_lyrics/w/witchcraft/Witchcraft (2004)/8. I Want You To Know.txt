Too many worries to cope with everyday
Life should be easy, if I can have my say
I know I feel so deeply nested in our minds
Makes me so angry, oh my love dies

Now it is time for us to sit back and relax
No more dirty people stabbin' our backs
Now let the happiness flow through our blood
That's what we all deserve, yes we want the world

Can't find the lyrics to explain how I feel
These troubling feelings, they are so unreal
We have it all increase but we just let it go
A million chances that I want you to know
All right, oh no, let's go, whoa yeah

We are the reason
Why the gods change the season
Must not forget
Our manners
We are here
And that's what matters
