Lovely woman, beautiful name 
Lady Winter IÂ´ll take you again
Her voice so soft, caress my body
Her voice so strong, sometimes come out wrong

This feelin itchinÂ´ from top to toe 
IÂ´d love to kiss you, you must not go
The door is open you gave me the key 
I donÂ´t even know you but donÂ´t leave me

Frustration has its evil grip on me 
Evil women just canÂ´t leave me be
In SatanÂ´s clutch youÂ´ll forever stay
If you donÂ´t say what you have to say

I make a wish
I wish to be kissed 
Tempting eyes
Deadly lips
On my knees I fall to pray 
Warmth within come to stay
