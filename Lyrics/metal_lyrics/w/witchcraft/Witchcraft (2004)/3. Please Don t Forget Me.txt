[originally by Pentagram]I wanted to know what the future would bring
As I looked out the dark cave of my life
I can predict anything that will be
You'd have it too if you lived like me

Help my please cuz  I'm down on my knees
So they're gonna take me away
I got nobody, struggles but my own
But I still can't make it through the day
I never wanted no one to run my life
But now it's run by a point
My woman is dead and I'm losin' my head
And you gotta help me out of it, please
