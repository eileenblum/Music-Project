On the first day I came
I was insecure lame
And you have no respect
You thought I was a shame

If I had the chance
I'd do it again and again
To find out the way that I am

I live the outside the lure
With lots people like me
But they were my friends
And friendship never ends

If I had the chance
I'd do it again and again
To find out the way that I am

So the years they pass by
And I watch you all die
And I love you
