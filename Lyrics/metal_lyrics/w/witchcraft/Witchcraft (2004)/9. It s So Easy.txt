It's so easy to see the stars
It's so easy to fall on the ground
Yes one word for only a simple man
I can take him yes I know I can

Still I'm dreaming about whirling sand
But it gives me power to work through the pain

Thought you were my friend, oh yeah
You betrayed again
You fucking bastard

To be honest, I try to hand over
But it's not easy to end a war, have you tried
