No angel or demon
Will help me on my knees
No God and no Satan
Will help me if I please
But I won't ask forgiveness
Cuz I've done nothing wrong
They say I'm a sinner
Please help me be strong

I walk inside
A little printer's mind
I'll make her feel
Her words aren't real

The love that I'm leading
Was leading me down
But now I am leaving
Leaving me behind
I'm leaving you out now
I'm leaving you down
Now I am losing
Yeah, I'm losing ground
Oh no

I walk inside
A little printer's mind
I'll make her feel
Her words aren't real
Yeah
