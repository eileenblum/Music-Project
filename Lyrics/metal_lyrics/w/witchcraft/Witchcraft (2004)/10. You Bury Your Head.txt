They say you look like a gypsy
And got a smile of a thief
You wear your clothes like a hippie
In you they got no belief
And youÂ´re just walking around
Thinking about nothing
YouÂ´re well known in this town 
Cause of your big brown muffin

And every day to you 
Really looks the same
But youÂ´ve got nothing to lose
YouÂ´re not even in the game
You canÂ´t deny
All the feelings you have
Even though you wish to 
Cause I know you feel sad

You bury your head deep in the sand
You cannot take all the fear thingsÂ´ve gotten out of hand
People despise your free ways I know youÂ´re misunderstood
But is that really the truth couldnÂ´t things be good?

YouÂ´re all alone 
And youÂ´ve got no one
YouÂ´re lost in the game
It is the pentagram 
ItÂ´s got your soul again 
And youÂ´ll never be free...no
