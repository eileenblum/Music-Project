My heart's on fire
I'm alive
I've got wings of my own
Something new something fresh
Indestructible and fragile
Make amends

I softly call
Call on you
I don't know
What it takes to get through
Holy mother here inside
You left your temple with your gold

Please let this all be remembered
Donât' cast it upon another
This daydream is growing old
It's night but I'm not cold

Maybe my horses are a little bit high
Or maybe I'm easy and you are going blind
