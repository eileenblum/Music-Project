Guilty by all means
How to survive
This day means so much
I've payed my debts to you

Sleep in fusion file
Awaken by guilt again
Bear my innocence
Wake my innocence

It's just a spectre
An interlude of confusion
Don't let it scare you so
Be it thoughts of amusement
The light counters dark as it reaches its peak
Blend and balance the bold takes it all

The threshold's been diminished
Your ideals are gone
The struggle almost over
You've found your pot of gold

Learning to pray upon these false indications
Clinging to this nothingness might do you good

Solve this riddle
The answer lies within
Tantoblin knows where the hierogram is.
