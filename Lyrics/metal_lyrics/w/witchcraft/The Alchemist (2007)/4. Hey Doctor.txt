Hey doctor tell me how can it be
Our screams are so real and you, you live in harmony
You can't heal this cancer radiation will kill
Your cult of flames behind the wall of sleep

Impostor without knowing your beliefs been defiled
The flesh on them bones been scorched and burned
A downward spiral for your heresy inclined
You're pushing forward back your logic is reversed

Constitution of murder
So legal and proud
Institution of sadness
a lot of them died

Blood pouring down from the back of your neck
You're being drowned of vitality's gift
Like a serpant's tooth the venom penetrates
Fight fire with fire and you fight back

Integrity and dignity for what it's worth
Now pull your head out and act like a man
It seems like you never have been free
Fight fire with fire ant then fight back

The symptoms of your illness
Are beginning to fade
Now tell me who's to blame
Burn burn flame.
