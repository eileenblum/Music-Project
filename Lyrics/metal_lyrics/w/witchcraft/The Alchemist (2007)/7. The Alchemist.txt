I have seen great kingdoms
I've seem them rise and fall
I am a thousand years old
Maybe a thousand more
The story's now forgotten
The paper's long gone dried
The ashes of the magician
Are spread with the wind and fire

I am not afraid of my own blood
I can share with you so much more
Stable and balanced I am here
Breathing in breathing out

Sometimes I wish that I was back in Babylon
Drinking wine with nostalgia
A blessed disease I'd laugh at you dementia

I can blow your mind
I can blow your mind

The trees so stark shake like leaves
The garden is under siege
The storm cries war lieutenant speaks
This holy man the alchemist

I can blow your mind
I can blow your mind

Put a word in my mouth and watch me swallow
Dig a hole into the ground
The funeral orchestra

Slow down your pace is high
Your brutalised by one man's hate
Slow down kill his love
Retribute
Retribution

I'm back again witch perspective eyes
Deception still lingers on
But I'm no one to categorize
I'm a free man on my own
Looking back upon the disrespect
Next time I'm ready to fight
Unlike a soldier in a battlefield
I'll pull my horses back and leave
