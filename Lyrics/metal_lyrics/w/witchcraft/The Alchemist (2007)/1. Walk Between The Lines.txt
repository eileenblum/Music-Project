Walking between the lines
That's what makes me life worthwhile
When no one knows what I mean
Is when I feel I have succeded

Cryptic and reclusive
You bend your back for me
Hiding in the shadow
Complications over you

Keeping track on what's important
Is all that matters in the long run
Whatever echoes back makes you realise
You are not alone even though it hurts

Calm my mind with tempered thoughts
Ah, you fuel my heart with blood inside
Flawless and fearless you wish I was

Climb the walls in your high
You better come down and wait a while
Frustration for another mile.
