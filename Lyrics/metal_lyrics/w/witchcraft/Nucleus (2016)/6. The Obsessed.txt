To feel inspired
To hold the line with your heart
I do not cross over
Condemning ways not according to yours

To let it all go
Rest this compulsion to know
Fighting fears to change
Losing its grip now and rearrange

I'd travel higher
Iâd go beyond your doors
No fucking hollow words
Fed up with your endless circle games

To let some parts go
Rest this compulsion to know
Fighting fears to change
Losing itâs grip now, rearrange!

Constantly torn between whatâs wrong or right
Get up and move, finally I can tell you were poor
Iâve been alive in this world
Frozen hand on the table
Oh, and I go now
