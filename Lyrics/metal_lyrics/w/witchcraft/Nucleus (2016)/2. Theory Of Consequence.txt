The dance macabre, ignored by you
Supported by fiction, itâs so real itâs not real
Stupid and dumb, your favorite words
You know you coexist in this world of worlds

How much time will you spend
In your mind's paradise?
Driven by disappointment
All disguised as righteousness

Someday your mother will collapse
And youâll be faced with the same indecisions
Behind your pretty mask lies
All the same invaluable intentions
