Dear realization
Fear and understimulation
Shockwaves, all emotions
Pour over me, quenches my dedication

Depersonalization
Unfamiliar with this situation
Tears of devastation
Iâm trying and manifesting this creation

Stronger than I can remember
Iâm swimming in the remnants
Of a better life, of past relations
Now forced upon me is chaos and disorder
One of us must go
In the undertow

I will crucify
I will not lay down and die
Keep them coming, keep them coming
I have swallowed my pride
