[Part 1]

We all know it but we donât show it
Hard to admit it, but get a grip now
In the same sandpit throwing toys and splashing
Sand's in our eyes
Blurry's our sight to say the least

My analyzer's shallow but I think he has a point
It keeps my underground and carry my whole 'cause
One died another dying, and donât delve deeper
Just a game for the intellected
Blurry's our sight to say the least

To save a nation from a bad economy
Is like sailing away on an endless sea

To save a nation from a bad economy
Is like sailing away

To save a nation from a bad economy
Is like sailing away on an endless sea

[Part 2]

You say it spells naivety, I became [?]
A reader and a thinker man in a desert desolate place
It burned the rope at both ends, polarized and victimized
Failed to see infinity, that I get from society

Violated, separated, we are incarcerated
Like a time bomb burning, refusing to explode
Denying your weaknesses, again you're splashing sand
Hindering progress, checking for your own land
