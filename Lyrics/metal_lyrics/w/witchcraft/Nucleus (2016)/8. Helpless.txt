Loneliest desert for many years
Touched and turn every grain of sadness
A helpless wondering hole
Come to think of I'm the only man
Oh all these spiders sucked from the ground
Can they tell me why
In this land the flowers can't grow
They have withered and so have I
All dry footsteps of the ones we love
Fear will surround with misery
So you know what it means to kill
Never will they will heal
