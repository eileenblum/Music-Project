I canât even breathe no more, can't even recall my name
No, I cannot sleep with this horror that Iâve been here before
They will fall, they will crawl
On a cold [?]
I said nothing, they will find

If this is the devil's way to say my time has come
Then I would accept it all, tolerance is not my game
They should bleed, they should leave
Accomplish my aims
Set yourself free
They will fall, they will crawl

To draw these sanction deep in my soul
Is an exorcism of doubts
I never have to choose this way
Two changes to an end

Shame and guilt have made a losing way
Buried in this frustration of this bitter hate
I cannot cope with another breakdown
Justice perfection, physical meltdown
But my hands, seems I have spilled your blood
Time to shut them devils away

You gave me the dead stare
You filled my eyes with tears
But now I wander off
Permanently love
