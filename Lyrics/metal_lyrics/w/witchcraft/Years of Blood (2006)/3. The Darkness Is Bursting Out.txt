Cause the lights fell down and they are shadowing the rays
Cause the frost blows death and it frozens the bleeding hearts
From the forgotten oceans bursting out the darkness
Cause on the top of ancient hills the wolves are crying
Cause on the dark sky ravens fly towards north
Among the forgotten hills bursting out the darkness
Then the burning ghosts gives life to wicked offsprings
Who will serve in desire the black emperor of demonstorm
