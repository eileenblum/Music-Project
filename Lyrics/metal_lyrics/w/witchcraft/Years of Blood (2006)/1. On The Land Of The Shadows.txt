On the land of the shadows, swallowed in the silence
Misterious sounds are blending with the wind
They are whispering my name, they are poisoning my soul
Phantasms and visions they are kidnapping me
On the path of the frogs, in the heart of darkness
They forget forever my damned soul
Awekening in the abyss in the icecold silence
On the land of the shadows, in the vale of the shades
