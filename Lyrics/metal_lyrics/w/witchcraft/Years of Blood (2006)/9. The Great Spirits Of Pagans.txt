When the fire rules in the endless night and the fullmoon lights the iced hills of north
Then the revenge of ancient gods strikes down on the oriental lands
Burn, burn oh son of God feel the power of the flames
When they are licking your body pray for forgiveness
The great spirit of pagans hold a celebration on you sacred hills
GOD!
I burn down all your sacred places
I dust the heaven with blood
Your lamb's meat will be my throne on the profan black orgy
The sacred land is burning, everything will be gone the images ofold ages will shine on again.
