When the night descends and the moon rise
We collect at the stock of the greatest oak
When the night descends and the wolves sing
Forbidden prayers leave out our lips
Blood and damnation the shades of the night are greeting you
Pagan spirits dark demons the shades of the night are calling you
When the night descends and the stars shine we collect under the great hills
When the night descends and the trees whisper watching the sky we call the moon
UNHOLY LORD!!!
The shades of the night are waiting for you
Come and tell your horrible secrets
The shades of the night are greeting you.
