I've let tomorrow be a good excuse for
not changing today
looking over our lists of to-do's routines have gotten in the way
day in, day out it becomes the same
I'm tired of standing for nothing and sleepwalking our time away

leaving our questions unanswered
or never asking at all

could we be something more
than we are right now?
eyes closed, shut tight,
apathy has us by the throat,
loosen the ropes and let our dreams take flight!

so often we let our dreams fall away but not this time... let's go

I feel like I've never wanted something so bad as this
stand up and be something more!

we'll make a change STAND UP
no time to waste RIGHT NOW.
