Let's go back to square one again,
it seems like we've all lost touch
with what we all once loved so much...
we've lost so much
what happened to those sleepless nights
just waiting for the show?
has our excitement grown dull?
I'm here remembering again... all that was said

your flag was flown, now drawn aside
and i cannot find any reason why

just empty words thrown around so careless
I'm here questioning their worth...
I'm questioning their worth

Let's go back to square one again,
it seems like we've all lost touch
with what we all once loved so much...
we've lost so much

and all the love once shared,
belittled and betrayed, is lost
but not forgotten... it's coming back in me

so here's to our sleepless nights and singalongs,
to the new kids and the old ones...
this is our night and our show!
the love once shared, belittled and betrayed...
is not lost.
