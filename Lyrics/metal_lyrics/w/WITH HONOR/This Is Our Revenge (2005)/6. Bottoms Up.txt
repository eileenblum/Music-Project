Call me the song beating in your heart
The needles mark, scrape, and pry,
Damage is done, when all these cuts bleed dry,
I'll have your story craved on my chest and arms,
Broken dreams spelled out in scars.
Call me the hope built up just to let you down,
Crippled like fractured legs,
With my knees scraping on the ground,
I'll have your story craved on my chest and arms,
Broken dreams spelled out in scars.
I will,
I'll wear these bruises like a tlantet.
This lesson like a hat,
Tip the brim and turn it back,
To minds that won't relent,
Builging heats on things we said and meant.
This is how it feels to come undone.
I'll have your story craved on my chest and arms,
Broken dreams spelled out in scars.
I'll have your story craved on my chest and arms,
Broken dreams spelled out spelled out in scars,
Out in scars.
"The human body can bear immeasurble pain and yet recover, Wounds can heal.
But once your spirit in broken, everything pulls apart."
