Something are just the truth,
Like how the sky is blue,
And wheels will always roll.
A mile won't pass without me missing you and it breaks,
It breaks through my skin.
The clock's sitll ticking,
Everyone that's still breathing has more important things to do.
Call of the morning, stop the light,
I can't forget hard as I try.
Start in on long night where we gag on things that we never got to say.
Lost sight of brighter times,
Two of the brightest eyes closed forever yesterday.
I'll reach for the stars and pull them down,
Tie them up inside your arms and learn to move on somehow.
You made me feel like in this life there's not a minute worth wasting.
Now I don't know, I don't know how to walk away.
Call of the morning, stop the light,
I can't forget hard as I try.
Start in on long night where we gag on things that we never got to say.
Lost sight of brighter times,
Two of the brightest eyes closed forever yesterday.
But you have my word,
I'll give that much more.
I won't take a similar smile for granted,
I'll learn to take falling on my face as dancing.
It's time close the coffin tight.
I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you.
It's time close the coffin tight.
I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you.
