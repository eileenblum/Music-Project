So it's been week and I can't help but stop and think,
These rooms seem cold without you.
Memories turned salty cheeks,
I still feel the flames you held beneath my feet.
Life may never be so good again.
I've been staring at there picture so long, I swear they're talking back.
Today is for the living.
These songs that we're singing are more than moving on,
They're the only ways we're making sense of a world that's small enough to shake,
But it's still strong enough to break us down.

I've tried to capture it never found a way.
'Cause wrapping words around a love that made
Palaces of parking lots and art of ugly hearts isn't easy.

Life may never be so good again.
I've been staring at there picture so long, I swear they're talking back.
Today is for the living.
These songs that we're singing are more than moving on,
They're the only ways we're making sense of a world that's small enough to shake,
But it's still strong enough to break us down.

What we gave, what we had.
Some may never understand how twenty kis in three vans won't ever be the same again.
What we gave, what we had.
Six weeks in the clouds and I'm still not ready, not ready to come down.

Today is for the living.
These songs that we're singing are more than moving on,
They're the only ways we're making sense of a world that's small enough to shake,
But it's still strong enough to break us down, break us down.
