Just three words to right the wrong,
One simple phrase, two hands to play along.
Instead of matchbooks, backyards, and knives,
We play with sharpe blades, run them through our sides.
Drop innocence, use common sense,
Protect yourself, forget your friends,
Kill the lights, walk out the door, time complicates, we're not kids anymore.
There's not a price to pay that could replace our trust
Count the passing days,
Time can't rebuild what's lost.
We are not the same,
We'll never be the same.
We are not the same.
