I'll hold my tongue
These has been enough double talk to double cross every bridge we've ever walked.
Watch them burn along with love lost, empty words withdrawn, confidence replaced with doubt.
Open handed antidotes,
Contrived smiles, half-heated jokes,
If this is letting go, then burn it down and just let go.
I guess I'll break the yoke and walk alone,
I'm missing the days, missing the days when I was missing home,
But the past is in the past, it's here today and gone so fast,
Just walk away, walk away some things don't last.
I'll find another brick to throw,
Another bottle to break.
You've got memories and I've got ghosts,
Kill the kind words we learned to know.
This is not the way things had to be,
You helped me see that star-crossed eyes aren't that they once were,
Pretty as they seem.
Open handed antidotes,
Contrived smiles, half-heated jokes,
If this is letting go, then burn it down and just let go.
I guess I'll break the yoke and walk alone,
I'm missing the days, missing the days when I was missing home,
But the past is in the past, it's here today and gone so fast,
Just walk away, walk away some things don't last.
Come at me like you mean it,
With skeletons to fill a thousand closets,
Do what you will.
Come at me like you mean it,
With skeletons to fill a thousand closets,
Do what you will.
It's out of my hands, do what you will.
I guess I'll break the yoke and walk alone,
I'm missing the days, missing the days when I was missing home,
But the past is in the past, it's here today and gone so fast,
Just walk away, just walk away.
