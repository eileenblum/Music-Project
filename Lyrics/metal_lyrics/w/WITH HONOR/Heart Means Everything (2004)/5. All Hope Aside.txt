Winding roads, AND WRONG TURNS,
with the flip of a coin your hope comes crashing down.
It's easy to be bitter, when clarity becomes a cloud,
Plans have turned into pieces your friends have let
you down,
By your side when things are shining,
but when it's dark they're nowhere to be found,
It's easy to be bitter, when you've been left behind,
Soon your hand will place the blame, To begin this
cycle once again.
Winding roads, AND WRONG TURNS,
with the flip of a coin your hope comes crashing down.
But there will come a day when our hands are open,
holding one another's worries, dry your eyes you're
not alone.
YOU'RE NOT ALONE Cut the loss, keep moving on,
life has its share OF HARD TIMES,
It's better to take a risk than to try to calculate
ITS CHANCES.
KEEP PUSHING ON, you're not alone.
