All this pain closing in, pressure from every side has
got me running,
Advice comes to cloud my plight and opinions breed my
confusion,
I will admit I haven't been this scared in so long,
a friend lost without explanation strikes me as wrong,
Family should not disappear when they disagree,
just goes to show your love was faked.
Not once did I think...
You would abandon me (NO) in my time of need,
There's NO SENSE in trying to be someone I'll never
be,
so save your spite and walk away.
Just walk away.
