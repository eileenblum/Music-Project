yesterday is gone
my heart is singing a new day's song
with the good days the bad days will come,
but I'm ready to move on
TO MOVE ON

all my worries and all my fears I've pushed aside in a
swift stream of tears

times have changed, minds have changed
hope for help was lost
we'll find it real not when we get there
but here... now!

in this decision, in the resolve to look around with
open eyes
and see that circumstance can't take control,
our lives our in our hands

looking back on my faint memories
there was a heart that burned to be true...
and i will get there
when i realize that...

life lies in this moment

times have changed
minds have changed
yesterday is gone
but today is in my hands.
