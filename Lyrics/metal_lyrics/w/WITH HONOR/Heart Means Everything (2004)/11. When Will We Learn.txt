IT'S ALL THE SAME, putting others down to take their
place,
WASTING AWAY, strung high on attitude.
DID WE FORGET, we all came from the same start,
IT'S ALL THE SAME, dissent in the name of unity.
We hear your words but where are the actions
to merit the glory you say you deserve?
It's just a claim.

It's just a claim.
Eyes blink, and we grow older,
Why not wiser?
Differences that once decorated now divide.
Hands throwing hatred only wasted their time,
Time that could build us up, instead of keeping us at
bay.
Instead of building walls, brick by brick they've
gotten tall enough
to block our minds but now it's time they fall.
Looks like we need to STEP BACK,
and learn to value the person inside when we stare
across a crowded room,
RELEASE all of the preconceived notions THAT HAUNT US,
It's sad to see so many entertained at their own
expense,
talking such good game, casting off every shred of
integrity.
WHEN WILL WE LEARN we're all the same.
