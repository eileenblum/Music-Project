ONE LAST TIME
and then we will make the choice to change our ways
Man's greatest excuse has gotten HOLD OF US.
It eats away at decisions and promises we made,
STEALING OUR success and taking our triumphs for
another day.
DON'T LET GO, it's not too late to rethink and return
to the hour when our desire freely ran.
It's the greatest shame, carved out on the ones who've
turned away,
giving up their dreams for mediocrity.
Never knowing, never thinking they've signed their
lives away.
But what's to be said FOR US who take life by the
hand?
WE WILL PROVE WRONG all of our critics and smash our
greatest doubts.
WE WILL SEE HEIGHTS... see heights we never thought we'd
reach.
I know the pain that keeps us down.
Somehow self doubt keeps us from breaking ground.
We need to reclaim control and get ourselves on track.
FORGET OUR mistakes, we've made so many but there's no
going back.
DON'T LET GO, it's not too late to rethink and to
return
to the hour when our desire freely ran.
RETHINK RETURN
there's no looking back
WE CAN BE FREE
through this struggle
DECIDE TO FIND
strength in your beliefs
THERE'S NO LOOKING BACK
we will be free.
