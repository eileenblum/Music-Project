Are you happy with the way you're living?
ALONE IN THE DARK.
In the dark...
Turned your back on the ones who waited for you when
you had gone awry,
always chasing the one who won't ever run you dry,
If you've got money, he's got the time...
Cast aside everything you held dear,
and now it's been so long it seems it never was at
all.
Breaking bottles, ALL IS LOST, Your addictions,
HAVE A COST, No excuses,
I won't buy in, They're nothing but lies...
Years past, every day a new face to try on,
discourse as cheap as the highs you ride on,
Believe me I've tried to wait patiently, but it's
getting hard,
So hard for me not to speak, Here's what I think!
You're everything I NEVER WANT TO BE.
I hate to see, a life so compromised, potential sold
just for a selfish drive,
Every waking moment when we fail to change,
there are choices made, we must search out life for
today.
STRENGTH TO LIVE life for today.
