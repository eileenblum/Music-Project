Time flies, and it's flown away with me this time,
All my good intentions taken out by my absent mind.
Apologies are far too small, when in them arrogance
stands tall,
So let me throw away my pride, because I have nothing
to hide.
THIS IS OUR FIGHT, side by side,
REACHING OUT TO MAKE THIS right!
No matter how small the chance or how great the task I
will try,
No matter how long the fall or what's at stake I'll
aim to fly.
(Because) You've shown me what it's like to live,
nowhere to look but up, nothing to hold back,
everything to give...
Your friendship MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.
Maybe we'll never lose this, Maybe time will make us
into memories,
But one thing is true, in the end we'll be glad WE
GAVE ALL WE HAD.
