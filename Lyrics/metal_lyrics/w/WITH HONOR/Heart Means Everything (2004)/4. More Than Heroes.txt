No. This has gone far enough.
When mouths run fast, fists attack,
walls may crash but we're not...WE'RE NOT MOVING.
These nights mean too much to let them fall without a
fight,
And now a time's at hand where we must defend what's
so clear, so right,
It's time to choose our sides.
So who will rise to this call?
Who will empower the weak and catch friends when they
fall?
It's time to choose our sides.
NO BACKING OUT.
And if they want a war, they'll see a war.
THEY'LL GET A WAR TONIGHT.
There's power in our desperation,
there's strength in a mind that does not rest, always
ready always holding on.
These times they are our tests and through hard work,
dedication justice will come to pass.
Here tonight everything changes... TONIGHT EVERYTHING
CHANGES
we'll lay siege to closed minds, Tonight everything
changes,
TONIGHT EVERYTHING CHANGES
These ties that bind will not be broken.
We'll lay siege to closed minds and tightened fists.
Staying close to the truth we know, moving past
whatever's IN OUR WAY.
This has gone FAR ENOUGH, This has gone FAR ENOUGH.
When we can stand together in one mind, one heart,
we'll see everything will change...everything will
change.
If we could stand together.
When we can stand together, (ONE MIND, ONE HEART)
They will know, it will be clear, we are more, we are
more than heroes.
