They came from beyond with their ships of great pride
Trying to save us from total genocide
We were destructive defending our cause
Making our own laws and raising a force

Oh, what have we done? - is all pride now gone
Killing all life - oh alien abide

From old times we know they have been here before
Times of great minds now there's only a war
There's only one man to blame in this case
That homosapien not just a phrase

Oh, what have we done? - is our pride now gone?
Killing our life - oh alien abide

Alien come back and absolve my dark soul
For sins I cannot animate in your womb
Savage come save me and fill me with joy
I'll give you my heart and I'll lend you my brain

Oh, what have we done? - is all pride now gone?
Killing all life - oh alien abide

They came from beyond with their ships of great pride
Trying to save us from total genocide
We were destructive defending our cause
Making our own laws and raising a force

Oh, what have we done? - is all pride now gone
Killing all life - oh alien abide
