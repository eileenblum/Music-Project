Empty streets, deserted town. Barking dogs, distant sounds
Early morn, see the dawn, breaking red tomorrow's dead
Neon lights, never dies , a monument, we've reached the end
End of love, end of hate, end of time, end of the World....

The devil rode among us, not so long ago
The rats all left the dumps, heading for the town
Sent be evil forces, with blindness in their eyes
Raging cross the country they left grief and death behind

Please share my nightmare
Won't you bring around another torch
Please share my nightmare
I need a back to lean opon
I'm scared to death by the things I see
In the light of the torch

Standing in the city, the lights went out tonight
Like demons without pity, they quickly fill my sights
They come in packs towards me, the streets have come alive
Expose their yellow teeth in a deafening battle cry

[Chorus]

[Solo]

I'm up against the wall - the fire keeps them back
Soon my torch will burn out leave everything in black
I have to find somebody, who can wake me from this dream
There has to be someone to hear me when I scream
