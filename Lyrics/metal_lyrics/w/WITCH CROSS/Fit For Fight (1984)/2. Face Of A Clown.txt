He spotted you exactly as you walked in through the gate
You are just the girl of his desire
The jester laughs his evil grin he's master of your fate
Putting all his lunacy on fire

He waits for your screams tonight
He'll live out his dreams tonight All right

He's hiding in the shadows when the moon is on the rise
Preparing for his evil making
The Hunger for your virtue is shining in his eyes
Breathing heavy ready and waiting

He's having your body tonight
You'll take all he's got tonight

Face of a clown
Mind of a madman
Dress of a Jester
Intentions of a killer

You're back out on the streets
When you hear his steps behind
His laughing makes you run for your life
You're crying in despair your own tears make you blind
When you see the streetlight shine in his knife

You're begging for mercy tonight
You'll die by his hand tonight

Face of a clown
Mind of a madman
Dress of a Jester
Intentions of a killer
