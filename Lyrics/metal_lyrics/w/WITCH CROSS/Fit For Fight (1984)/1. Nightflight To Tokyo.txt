I saw it on the TV I heard it on the radio
The fire in their eyes can make your passion glow
Their black hair match their bodies, oh what a perfect sight
The language drives you crazy makes you easy to ignite

Do you want my loving, do you want it all
Can you take my loving can you take it all
Put me on the

Night flight to Tokyo
I wanna meet the Tokyo Rose
Night flight to Tokyo
Take me to the land of my dreams

Samurai daughters the stars of my erotic dreams
Come and tell me you love me and whisper sweet talk in Japanese
Let me rip of your kimono I wanna kiss the silk underneath
I need your loving badly more than all the air that I breathe

Do you want my loving Do you want it all
Can you take my loving can you take it all
Put me on the

Night flight to Tokyo
I wanna meet the Tokyo Rose
Night flight to Tokyo
Take me to the land of my dreams

I wanna travel far east to unleash all my fantasies
Make love to eastern beauties by the water in the midnight breeze
I wanna meet a local geisha drink sake in the candle light
Forget about my troubles if I could only be there tonight

Do you want my loving, do you want it all?
You take my body can you take it all
Put me on the

Night flight to Tokyo
I wanna meet the Tokyo Rose
Night flight to Tokyo
Take me to the land of my dreams
