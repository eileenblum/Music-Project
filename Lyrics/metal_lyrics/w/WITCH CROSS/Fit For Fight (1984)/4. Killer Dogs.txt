They're coming from the back street
Creeping around
Waiting for the time to kill
Looking for a victim
It's easy to find
Man or woman they don't mind

Attacking like the lightning
Flashing in the night
Never try to catch them
If you don't wanna die

They're fighting for the food
Tears his soul apart
Maybe next time it'll be you
They sneak up from behind
You never hear a sound
Until you're lying dead on the ground

Be on your guard
If you wanna survive
Expect no mercy
They're gonna take you life

Killer dogs
Watching you
Reflecting every little move
Killer dogs watch you die
Everybody's terrified

You'll never understand
The nightmare in their eyes
Evil spirits force them to kill
The only thing you'll see
Is the sight of your own blood
And then you'll know what hell must be like

Snapping teeth
Drip of blood
Gonna eat you raw
Dig your bones to the ground

Gone when the day breaks
Hiding from the light
Those mad dogs disappear in the dark
Protected from the daylight
The creatures all at rest
But after sundown they rule again

Be on your guard
If you wanna survive
Expect no mercy
They're gonna take your life

Killer dogs
Watching you
Reflecting every little move
Killerdogs watch you die
Everybody's terrified
