I'm on the loose tonight
My woman's not in sight
I roam the streets alone
And I'm far from home
At once you cross my way
I don't have much to say
You make a hit
You know I'm such an easy target
I feel a spark inside me glow
I feel the heat inside me grow
You're a temptator, mind fustrator I have to

Fight the Fire
Fight the Fire
Fight the Fire in my heart

I walk you to your door
I can't resist no more
Desire fill my soul, I've got no control
You lead me to your bed
I suddenly regret
There's no way back cause this girl's really got the knack

I feel a spark inside me flame
Suddenly I feel a pain
I'm alcoholic melancholic I have to

Fight....

[Solo]

Fight the ...

When early morning comes
You've got me on the run
I'm on the streets again without a friend
I'm feeling sad and cold
I'm feeling very old
I miss my wife my conscience cuts me like a knife
I feel a spark inside me die
And all alone I start to cry
You were a teaser mind diseaser I could not

Fight the ...
