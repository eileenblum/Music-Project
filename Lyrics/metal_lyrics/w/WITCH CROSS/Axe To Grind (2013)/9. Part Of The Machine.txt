Blood dries up in your veins
Your life won't be the same
Connected to the host
Electrolytes replace your soul
Synthetic spinal crack
You fade to bible black
Your will is not your own
Too late, the circuits thrown

The terminal takes complete surrender - lovin' your pain
Bends your will to the mass collider
Nothing will be the same...

You're part of the machine - huh!
You're part of the machine - ah!

Humanity the curse
But you're set for something worse
Your soul receives the void
A spark to solenoid
Your life becomes undone
A string of zero-ones
New science designed to kill
And bend you to his will

The terminal takes complete surrender - lovin' your pain
Bends your will to the mass collider
Nothing will be the same..

[Chorus]

You are a fading light - become a Neophyte
Powered by nuclear fuel
Collecting all you need to rule!

[Chorus]
