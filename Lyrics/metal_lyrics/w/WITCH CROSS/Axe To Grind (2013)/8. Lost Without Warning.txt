They sailed for the great unknown
The seeds of exploration sown
Sweethearts' tears alone at home
Just whispers on the wind....time and time again

Crashing waves and creaking timbers
Man against the elements
Primal fears forever linger
Guided by the firmament

Damn this voyage of desperation for other people's gold
Souls without salvation, lost without warning

Message thrown out in a bottle so this tale can be told
Met our dark damnation, lost without warning

The darkness of the Ocean's depths
We all succumb to Neptune's threats
And Mecca's mighty minarets
Are just a mirage now... oh no!

Pawns of avaricious masters
Men the fuel they choose to burn
Wide the jaws of our disaster
Taken by Leviathan

Damn this voyage of desperation for other people's gold
Souls without salvation, lost without warning

Now we float in icy limbo, silent in our rage
Hear us scratching at your window from another age

Damn this voyage of desperation for other people's gold
Souls without salvation, lost without warning

Souls without salvation, lost without warning... lost
