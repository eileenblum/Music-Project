"Welcome to the Chelsea Hotel.."

Set among the brownstones
Faded, balustraded - protector of their sins
All who crossed the portal felt the magic
Coursing through it deep within

Echoes in the stairwells
Memories from the past
Electrified and wicked
Welcomes sinners coming back

And Janis goes down like a bird on the wire
And Dylan Thomas checks out in 205
And Mr. Zimmerman writes of a lady's sad eyes
Jack Kerouac's back on the road again

Chelsea - one - zero - zero (rest stop)
Chelsea - one - zeroâ¦ zero

Tales of lust and grandeur
Feed my dark deception
Inspire and corrupt
Through my door I think I hear them
Distant sirens in the street

Final act of violence
Bloodstains mark the end
They rammed the door and found me
And the knife's my only friend

And the tapping of the Remington's getting too loud
And guitars serenade the infected crowd
There's a story behind every one of these doors
But don't go looking for Sid's it ain't there any more

Chelsea - one - zero - zero (rest stop)
Chelsea - one - zero ...zero (for the rare individual)
Chelsea - one - zero - zero (pit stop)
Chelsea - one - zero ...zero (for the last incurables)

Hahaha!

Everybody passing through here is somebody
Yet they're nobody on the outside
You've got to pay the piper
Checkout has your bill
Remember Sid and Nancy's bitter pill

Warhol takes a bullet for the feminist cause
And Dee Dee checks out through the suicide doors
Edie's candlelight eyes set the room on fire
And Janis goes down like a bird on the wire...

Chelsea - one - zero - zero (rest stop)
Chelsea - one - zero ...zero (for the rare individual)
Chelsea - one - zero - zero (pit stop)
Chelsea - one - zero ...zero (you're the last...)

"Checking out Sir?"
