We're living in the underground
You'll never break our spirit
We are legion

Denim, leather - march together
Sworn to the music, we're defending

The music you see, lives on in me
It's never on the radio
We're here to let you know
It's time to make a stand!!!

C'mon! C'mon! Raise your hands
We are the metal nation
C'mon raise your hands - together we can make it
We are the metal nation

We rise up from the underground
United by the spirit
Together we're strong - yeah, we're all for one

See our mighty numbers
Hear the guitars wake from slumber
Blow them all to hell!

The music you see, lives on in me
It's never on the radio
We're here to let you know
It's time to make a stand!!!

C'mon! Raise your hands
We are the metal nation
C'mon raise your hands - together we can make it
We are the metal nation

Hey hey! Metal nation... hey hey! Metal nation

C'mon! C'mon! Raise your hands
We are the metal nation
C'mon raise your hands - together we can make it
C'mon! C'mon!
We are the metal nation
And we are your salvation...
