She breaks through your conscience into the night
A cold wind blows out the candles
Cos she just can't stand the light

Her poison pen is poised to paint you
With wicked words and lies
The barbs of vitriol surround you
And there's hatred in her eyes

Demon, in the mirror - living out your lies
Demon, in the mirror - right before your eyes

She's just a grim reflection of all your wicked sin
But the chilling feel of lies made real
And so the hype begins

She preys on fears with vengeful fury
She'll rip your life apart
You're guilty, she's the judge and jury
And her words cut through your heart

Demon, in the mirror - living out your lies
Demon, in the mirror - right before your eyes
Demon, in the mirror - watching all your moves
Demon, in the mirror - you face the final truth

There's something strange behind your eyes
Your alter ego's tellin' lies
But now you heed the voice's call
And so our hero takes a fall...

Demon, in the mirror - living out your lies
Demon, in the mirror - right before your eyes
Demon, in the mirror - watching all your moves
Demon, in the mirror - you face the final truth

Demon, yeah!
