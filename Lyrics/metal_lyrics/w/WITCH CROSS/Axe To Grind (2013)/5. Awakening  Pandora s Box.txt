[a) Awakening]

[Instrumental]

[b) Pandora's Box]

Ooh yeah
Mmmm...
Oh no, no no...

Don't open Pandora's box
Don't you touch those latches and locks
You can't free what's hidden within
Demons, and devils, and every man's sin

Don't dare to peek inside
Or all good souls must run and hide
Chaos reign and brimstone fire
Pandora's box is Earth's pariah

Evil takes flight above the earth
The devil spawns his afterbirth

Pandora - no hope for ya
Pandora - a new Gomorrah

But wait, what's that beneath the lid?
You kept hope hidden, I know you did
That failing beacon, fading light
Our one last chance in this blackest night

But all around the fates abide
And mortals fight to stay alive
With talons, razored tooth and claw
We're dragged into the gaping maw

Her curiosity released
The worst of every man and beast

Evil taking flight!

And all around the fates abide
And mortals fight to stay alive
With talons, razored tooth and claw
We're dragged into the gaping maw

Her curiosity released
The worst of every man and beast

Evil taking flight!
