The Stage is on we are ready to go
All dressed up we are going to steal the show
the kids are here we are going to take them high
We want to see your hands tonight will never die

[Chorus:]
We Want to
see you
hear you
feel you
are you there?

Took off this morning far away from here
The roar from the kids there was still ringing in our ears
check in at the hotel through the kitchen door
waved through the window the crowd began to roar

[Chorus]

We met with the mayor had a talk to the press
we went to the soundcheck ended up in a mess
tuning the guitars in the dressing room
a little nervous we have to face you soon

[Chorus]
