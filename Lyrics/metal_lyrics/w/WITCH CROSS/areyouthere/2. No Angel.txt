I'm a crazy roadhawk I'll never settle down
I've got many borders to cross before I die
The moon is on my shoulder when I'm riding through the night

Moving against the distant till the Early morning light

He's a lonely rider forever moving on
And When you want him he'll be gone

[Chorus]
I am no angel dressed in white
That's why I'm living this kind of life
I am no Angel Dressed in White

People warn their daughters when I'm coming to town
But I'm no Virgin Killer I never did no harm
I am just a loner and I'm living my Life
I'm no Trouble Maker but I stand up for my rights
He's a lonely rider forever moving on
And When you want him he'll be gone

[Chorus]

So don't give me love I could never be your Sweet heart
I could never love a woman Cause I'm married to the freeway
I'm called the ghost rider and I'm always moving on
So take a good look cause you won't see me again
He's a lonely rider forever moving on
And when you want him he'll be gone

[Chorus]
