They come in through your backdoor
Hungry for your flesh
Waiting for a chance to kill
Looking for a victim
Got the taste of blood
Murderâs written in their eyes
Attacking like a lightning
A flash in the night
Nothingâs gonna stop them
Someoneâs bound to die

Theyâre fighting in the night
When darkness comes around
Maybe youâre the next to be hit
They sneak up from behind
Move without a sound
You never stand a chance to survive
You can pray to your God
Nothingâs gonna help
There is no mercy
Itâs you thatâs bound to die

Killerdogs
Your body will turn to ashes
Killerdogs
Watch out

You better understand
When nighttime fills your eyes
These evil monstersâ ready to kill
The only thing youâll see
Is the sight of your own blood
And then youâre on your way to hell
You can pray to your God
Nothingâs gonna help
There is no mercy
Itâs you thatâs bound to die

[Guitar solos]

They come in through your backdoor
Hungry for your flesh
Waiting for a chance to kill
Looking for a victim
Got the taste of blood
Murderâs written in their eyes
Attacking like a lightning
A flash in the night
Nothingâs gonna stop them
Someoneâs bound to die

Killerdogs
Your body will turn to ashes
Killerdogs
Watch out
