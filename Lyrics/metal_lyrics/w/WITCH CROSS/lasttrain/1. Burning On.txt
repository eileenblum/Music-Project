Too many people standing in the darkness
Waiting for the light shining through
Leaders led them blind
âCause they are lost children too
You can buy a candle of gold
And burn it to the end
But you can hide behind fortunes
But where will you buy your best friend ?

Too many people walking in the night
Looking for somebody to love
Thinking their treasures will show them the way
But itâs the wrong road they are on
You can play a propourous man
And do it to the end
You can hide behind fortunes
But where will you buy your girlfriend ?

Hear the sound itâll show you the way
It will lead you to a brighter day
Touch their soul but donât hear them pray
They can talk but they got nothing to say

Itâs burning on
Burning on
Itâs burning on

Use your life when you are young
Take a chance before itâs gone
Live your life and making it fun
Every hour of the day is done

Itâs burning on
Burning on
Itâs burning on

[Guitar solos]

Hear the sound itâll show you the way
It will lead you to a brighter day
Touch their soul but donât hear them pray
They can talk but they got nothing to say, yeah

Itâs burning on
Burning on
Itâs burning on
Itâs burning on
