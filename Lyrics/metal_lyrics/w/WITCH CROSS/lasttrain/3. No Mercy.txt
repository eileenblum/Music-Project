Iâve got a vision
I hope someday comes true
Nothing can stop me
âCause I know what I do
Walking in the darkness
Looking for you
Youâre the cause of my madness
Youâre my nightmares come true

When will it be ?
There is no mercy for me (evil laughter)

You think youâre the master
Of evil, death and pain
Your never ending searching
Will drive you insane
âCause there will be a ground mist
Thereâs a shadow in the light
Breaking all the silence
A scream runs through the night

When will it be ?
There is no mercy for me (evil laughter)

[Guitar solos]

You think youâre the master
Of evil, death and pain
Your never ending searching
Will drive you insane
âCause there will be a ground mist
Thereâs a shadow in the light
Breaking all the silence
A scream runs through the night

When will it be ?
There is no mercy for me (evil laughter)
