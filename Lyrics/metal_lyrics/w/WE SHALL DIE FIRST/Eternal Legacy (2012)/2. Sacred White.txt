He who overcomes will,
like them, be dressed in white.
I will never blot out his name
from the book of life,
but will acknowledge his name
before my Father.

They have washed their robes
and made them white
in the blood of the lamb.

I will heal their waywardness
and love them freely,
for my anger has turned away from them.

Abide in my affection.

See what great love the Father has
lavished on us, that we should be called
âchildren of Godâ
