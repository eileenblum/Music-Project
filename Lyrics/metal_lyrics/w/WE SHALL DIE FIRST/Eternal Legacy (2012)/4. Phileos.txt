drinking our tears,
blinded by hate.

Until you be satisfied with such evil?

Until you be satisfied with such evil?

A torrent of darkness
fills your heart with waste
your mouth pours poison
like the worst of snakes.

Will be
born again away from that death
that was the wrong way
sin consume your flesh.

Enter through the narrow gate
rejects the wide (wide)
way (way)
This means death.

Come to the path of light
where the brave are.
Iâll tell you something
we are not few in this fight.

Firm and strong,
we will proclaimâ¦

In this case the blood is superfluous, it is more than simple words
consist of rightful, unity and love.

There is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

The Lord says in His word in Proverbs 17:17
when youâre in agony, youâll have a brother indeed.

There is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

There is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

A friend loves at all times,
and a brother is born for adversity.

A friend loves at all times,
and a brother is born for adversity.

A friend loves at all times,
and a brother is born for adversity.
