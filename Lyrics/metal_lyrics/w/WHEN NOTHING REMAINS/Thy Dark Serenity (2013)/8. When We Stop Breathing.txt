It is the darkness that loves you
Hiding in the corners
It is the night that makes you
Feeding the monsters under your bed

And since heaven once fell
You live in your nightmares

It is inescapable this life
That you created with thoughts
And your chains are made of
Unbreakable dreams

You saw it coming
When heaven once fell
You went down on your knees
And if you cried
No one was there to listen

And since heaven once fell
You live in your nightmares

The shattered glass lies on the ground and the
Wounds they create
Sting under the soles of your feet
You think you are lost
But you are here
You think that you are dead
But you are still breathing
You think the morning will come tomorrow
(tomorrow)
