Trying to trespass the cruel vanity
To reach the strength of my mind
Seeking the subdued places
In a world where nothing remains
Wandering lost in labyrinths of chaos, Finding
Only fools game

It tortures me, tearing me apart
And it all fall down in the chasm of death

The shadows are deep inside
And the heart beats dull eternally
I am your sole spirit in the abyss
Attempted to find thy dark, serenity

I deny the loneliness
When illusions surround
And mockery voices cut wounds
I am bleeding not blood but life

Abominable scenery destroys the calm, ripping it
To million pieces
The nowhere creeps closer
And insane is a new reality

The shadows are deep inside
And the heart beats dull eternally
I am your sole spirit in the abyss
Attempted to find thy dark serenity
