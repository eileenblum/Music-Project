As day turns to night
We're losing our time
So let the veil of darkness
Cradle us to sleep
The raven will carry our souls
Through the skies and sunsets
Through the clouds and stars
And down
And down
To where we belong

You hold my hand
And in your eyes
I see the dying light
You are dark now
Ravenâs child

You ask me one last wish
But i will never say the words
I will take them from your lips
You ask me one last wish
But i will never say

A ravens tale, a ravens tale

And make them my own
And keep them so close

Time ends tonight
And the raven will carry our souls
Through the skies and sunsets
Through snow and rain
And down
And down
To where we belong

You are so quiet now
Blind and mute
Fumbling in the darkness
Without a guiding light
But just wait for the raven to come
This is the last of our dream

You ask me one last wish
But i Will never say the words
I will take them from your lips
You ask me one last wish
But i will never say

A ravens tale, a ravens tale
