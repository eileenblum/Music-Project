I see you walk on this lonely path
Between silent shapes of
Deathâs monuments
What are you thinking now
When the sun is buried in the ocean

When your breaths are cold
Like your hands and heart
And you canât trick me anymore
I see you standing in the shadows
Heads bent down
With silent words on your lips

Are you crying now
Over times that can't return
Over night and shooting stars
Why don't you come to me
And i will give you wings

Dig your grave with dirty hands
Next to my name
Deep written in the stone
I canât touch you yet but soon
You will belong to me
With your withered soul
And with your body next to mine
We can rest
