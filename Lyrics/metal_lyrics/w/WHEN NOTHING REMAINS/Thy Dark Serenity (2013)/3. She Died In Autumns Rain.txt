So cold nights since she died
So empty world without
But the rain keeps falling
Turns to snow at midnight

So cold days since she died
Sparkling white so dark
Winter is here, surrounds me
But she died in autumn s rain

Footprints in deep snow
Melts to water in springtime
And my silent mornings
Smells like the dirt and death...

I canât find the paths i should walk on
Canât see the places to go
Iâm blinded by sunlight
Lost in a world without rain

Wishing for November
Longing for her breaths
Her rushing heartbeats under the
Palm of my hand
Her dreams of winter's rest

Moonlight over grass
Starlight over stones
The heat of a summer day
But she died in autumn's rain.

Moonlight over grass
Starlight over stones
The heat of a summer day
But she died in autumnâs rain

Wishing for November
Longing for her breaths
Her heartbeats under the
Palm of my hand
Her dreams of winter's rest
