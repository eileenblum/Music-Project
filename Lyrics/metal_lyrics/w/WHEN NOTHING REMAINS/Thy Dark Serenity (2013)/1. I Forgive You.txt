Winds whispering, carrying our fate
Not letting me forget
And I remember how I met you
How your smile hid your demons away

Lurking inside
But I never knew
Until it was too late
Broken eyes, so filled with sorrow
Seeing what no one else can see

Hearing screams and voices
In silent rooms
Dragging knives against skin
To make it go away
To make it all go away

I found you
In your crimson bed
Your calm, calm eyes
Staring at nothing
Not even me
And I cursed you you everday

This bitter life
So cold and hard and lonely
Without you
I could have killed your demons away, away.
I could have loved you still
But i forgive you...
