Once the world was new
In the beginning
We where shining

Then there where changes
The hands of destruction swept forth
Past there where failing
The hearts of destruction heated acute
Prior the wishes faded away
And our eyes was blindfolded

It's a die down star
Who takes us all
Down to the darkest abyss
It's the mourning of the sun

Visions are dismissed
Dreams are improbable
People are shadows
We are the broken ones

Never going back
Never see the light
Never be increased
Never be living again

It s a die down star
Who takes us all
Down to the darkest abyss

Now there is sable
Now there is death
It's the mourning of the sun
