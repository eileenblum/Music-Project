Dream the dreams
In a senseless sleep
And forget the awakening moments
When darkness comes closer
The silence grows old
And the pain obscure deep

Deceive the untrue to reality
A theatre of insincere hopes
An act of mending thoughts
But the grief will recur at dawn
And the pain that where gone
Will possess anew

The agony is me
Thousand shivers in my soul
Suffering i tried to abscond
But sleep is eternally lost
And the silence i need to conceal
Is a rear inside

I was a child once
I was alive once
Now nothing is left to be me
