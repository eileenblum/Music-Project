From the first breath to the second
A billion years
Just an instant time for mankind
We have come to the final moment

It's the end
As all torn asunder
The darkness will rise
And our gazes of fire
Will see it all die

Who are you
When life is death
What will we be
When death is reality

New life is dying
And the silence screams the words
It's the end
As all torn asunder
The sun will reject us
And the memories
Will forget it all

Fortune disappears
No one's left to whisper the words
No one's left to hear
No one will see
It all torn asunder

It all has come
To the end
