She lives in her shadowland
Deep drowned in misery thoughts
She feels like buried alive
The surface is so high above
She prolong her hand
But no one can reach it

She's alone in her shadowland
Deep drowned in fightful memories
She can't catch her breath
Respite in unsound air
The world around
Lies in ruins, Lies in ruins

I will meet her in her shadowland
Embrace her pain and make it mine
Maybe i can save her
From the darkness within
And she can walk away from here

She's alone in her shadowland
Deep drowned in fightful memories
She can't catch her breath
Respite in unsound air
The world around
Lies in ruins, Lies in ruins

She lives in her shadowland
Deep drowned in misery thoughts
She feels like buried alive

I will meet her in her shadowland
Embrace her pain and make it mine
Maybe I can save her
From the darkness within
And she can walk away from here

I will meet her in her shadowland
Embrace her pain and make it mine
Maybe I can save her
From the darkness within
And she can walk away from here
