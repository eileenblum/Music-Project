She holds my soul in her eyes
Her deep dark eyes
So young and yet
They have seen a passing time
I hold her in my arms
Trying to embrace the life
That slips away from her
But it's final now

She give me words
In her deep dark eyes
She wish that life was sacred
She pleads me
Please do not let me go
Hold me forever
Force my soul to stay
With you

Her life was not hers to live
And deep dark shadows
Turns pale in her eyes
And i betrayed her
I failed her
Because i let her go
Her life was just a moment
But so beautiful

Was life meant to be
Just a glimpse of her
Or was her lost life
Only a mistake
Maybe she was never born
Perhaps a dream in the night
In another world
Her deep dark eyes
Had been blue
