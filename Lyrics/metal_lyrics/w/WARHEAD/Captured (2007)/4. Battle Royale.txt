Woke up in a dark old classroom
You hear the grim teacher speak
This youth that is neglected
The stronger will kill the weak

Now your old friends have betrayed you
And now you know you're on your own
You think that this is nothing new
You always fought alone

Comeon put the fucking gun in your hand
Never stop running
You fellow classmates got their targets on you
You can hear them coming

An explosives collar's hanging round your neck
Making sure you won't survive
If you don't follow all the rules
You better try to stay alive

21 kids are dead and gone
You only crack a smile
Soon you will be free again
But only for a very short while

Comeon put the fucking gun in your hand
Never stop running
You fellow classmates got their targets on you
You can hear them coming

The B.R. game's all over now
The last day it is here
Your evil teacher takes a bow
The losses were severe

Comeon put the fucking gun in your hand
Never stop running
You fellow classmates got their targets on you
You can hear them coming
