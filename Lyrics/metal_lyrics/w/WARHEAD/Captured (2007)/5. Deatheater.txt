One man one word
He's fucking mean
Out on the road
A damn killing machine

Hands on the wheel
Yeah, faster he rides
The pain that he deals
Is fire in his eyes

No place to run, no place to hide
He's out to get you through day and night
This man means business and you will die
You can't escape, there is no use to try!

You made mistakes
Now he comes for you
Your life he takes
There's nothing you can do

He's coming in sight
Soon you will be dead
Yeah, he'll take your pride
The bounty on your head

You cannot hide, you're never free
He rides through the night and your death you will see!
