Tell me what has happened since the gulf war
I wonder if our lives are saver now
Did they crush the axis of evil?
Or where they out for what lies underground?

Do you see the next big thing is coming?
Shock &amp; Awe the punchline for attack
Is this all a war against terror?
Oh will the phobia get off our back?

Did they find the head of global terror?
Is he hiding somewhere in a cave?
I wonder if there's someone still searching
Or is the answer hiding in a safe?

Nearby we can see that there is mischief
Helping here would be a mighty deed
All I see is that they give a warning
Plans are different for the "creed of greed"

The puppets that you see - they're hollow
The truth that you can't find - is hard to swallow
This power rules the world - below the surface
You can't see their eyes - they are faceless

Phantoms!

Don't they see the other source of fire?
Genocide is happening all the time
Hungry people crying for salvation
But I see that no one gives a dime

Look around you all you see is madness
Better start to ask and use your brain
There is something happening in the shadows
Decisions made are totally insane!

The puppets that you see - they're hollow
The truth that you can't find - is hard to swallow
This power rules the world - below the surface
You can't see their eyes - they are faceless

Phantoms!
