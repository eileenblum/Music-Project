As you sit there in your cell
You think about your life
The time it runs so quick
Your skin has turned to grey
No there is nothing more for you

Windows barred
Can't breath air
Wait for death
No one's there

It's your crises
You don't want to be
The warden closed the door
A simple plan
To set you free
Oh, you don't want no more

Windows barred
Can't breath air
Wait for death
No one's there
You hear voices from afar
Never free, yes you are

Captured
Your life is no more
You rot on the floor
(Oh lord please forgive me)

Captured
The devil will grin
You pay for your sin
(Oh lord please forgive me)

Captured
There's no need to whine
You're facing your time
(Oh lord please forgive me)

Captured
You sit in your cell
You're captured in hell

Windows barred
Can't breath air
Wait for death
No one's there
You hear voices from afar
Never free, yes you are
