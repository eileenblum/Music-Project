The night is cold and now there is no sound
The earth it cracks open from the underground
A hand comes up, now you see a face
Distorted features of the undead race

Have no fear your time is up
They have come to eat you up

Zombie Ride
Feeding the night
You cannot run and you cannot hide

Zombie Ride
Feast on your fright
They only want your flesh

They come to you and you forgot how to run
They grab your legs and now you are done
As they take a bite you start to shiver
They rip through you choking on your liver

Blood is flowing
Guts are showing

Zombie Ride
Feeding the night
You cannot run and you cannot hide

Zombie Ride
Feast on your fright
They only want your flesh

As the teeth rush in
Let the slaughtering begin!

Zombie Ride
Feeding the night
You cannot run and you cannot hide

Zombie Ride
Feast on your fright
They only want your flesh
