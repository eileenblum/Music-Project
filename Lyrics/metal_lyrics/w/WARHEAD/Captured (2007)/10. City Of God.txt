Two children raised in bitterness
A poor life's what they lead
Smoking pot is total bliss
A future's what they need

Helplessly the parents moan
The youth's out of control
They steal, they lie, they shoot the gun
They hear destructions call

Faces! All these Faces!
You know there's something more to this
Place of horror, no tomorrow, always sorrow in the
City of God

Face it, got to face it, they keep on fighting to survive
Bullets flying, see them dying, hear them crying in the
City of God

Dead souls

Years have passed the kids grew up
Two stories here to tell
One became a normal Joe
The other king of hell

Dealing drugs spreading the pain
He's on a killing spree
Godfather of his district now
He feels almighty free

Faces! All these Faces!
You know there's something more to this
Place of horror, no tomorrow, always sorrow in the
City of God

Face it, got to face it, they keep on fighting to survive
Bullets flying, see them dying, hear them crying in the
City of God

Dead souls

The city's a mess - Drugs rule street
They want nothing less - It's all that  they need
There's no compromise - Be quick or be dead
The look in their eyes - Aiming straight at your head

A living disease - There's no way to hide
They do what they please - They're prowling the night
To kill and to burn - Is all that they know
The tables will turn - All the sorrow will show

Life it ain't fair - There's no turning back
They don't shed a tear - The final attack
They planted the seed - And see what they get
The one twisted breed - In the land of the dead!
