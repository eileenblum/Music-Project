Hate to say it to you
But you don't want to hear
What I feel when I hear you cry
I die inside

Beast on my back
You're always there
Don't want to hear your problems
Full of yourself
No you don't care
About no soul but you

You lie and shit and moan
I got to live life on my own
(My hate is leading me)
Can't breath at all
I'm in your grip
You tear me down with all your shit
(Anger building inside of me)

Deaf as you are
Yes you are
You shut your mind from me
You tell me that you're sick and tired
What's that supposed to mean?

Beast on my back
You're always there
Don't want to hear your problems
Full of yourself
No you don't care
About no soul but you

You lie and shit and moan
I got to live life on my own
(My hate is leading me)
Can't breath at all
I'm in your grip
You tear me down with all your shit
(Anger building inside of me)

The skies turn black
Lightning strikes the ocean
Thunder calls you
I can't breath air
Purple People!

I see the way you treating me
Purple people is all I seeâ¦
