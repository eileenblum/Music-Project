Confused by life I walk alone
Never thought I'd be the one
Who has to bear the greatest pain
And that your hate is all I gain

I tried to make everything right
Stayed in the shadow of the night
I am a ghost that is unseen
Never knew what might have been

Don't see the sun, no air to breath
I live in sewers underneath
There is no helping hand for me
I count my days in agony

The time is slipping through my hands
I start to loose my common sense
Oh why have you forsaken me?
This dreadful nightmare shouldn't be

And when you think that I will not return again
You see me eat my lunch out of a garbage can
I won't give up, but I can't fight the feeling
You turn your heads away from all the damage that you're dealing

Despise the world that's up above
I want to know what's life and love
I make my plans for my return
My souls on fire - feel it burn

The time is right, the time is now
I know I make it back somehow
And as I crawl out of my hole
My fierce revenge will get you all!

And when you think that I will not return again
You see me eat my lunch out of a garbage can
I won't give up, but I can't fight the feeling
You turn your heads away from all the damage that you're dealing

Living dead, down below - only reason to survive
Get out of the dark - you don't care, you don't know
I am bound to stay alive

Despise the world that's up above
I want to know what's life and love
I make my plans for my return
My souls on fire - feel it burn

The time is right, the time is now
I know I make it back somehow
And as I crawl out of my hole
My fierce revenge will get you all!

And when you think that I will not return again
You see me eat my lunch out of a garbage can
I won't give up, but I can't fight the feeling
You turn your heads away from all the damage that you're dealing

Still got my pride - and I know that I'm alive
Time for me to rise - yes I will destroy the hive
Bound to endless time - do you think that you're alive
Vengeance in my soul - time for you to pay that all

You won't break me down

Living dead down below
Only reason to survive

Get out of the dark
You don't care you don't know
I am bound to stay alive
