[music: eilen-breitenbach/lyrics: eilen, arranged by WARHEAD]

More than just dissatisfaction with politics;
we ask the politicians to shut up. No more lies,
bigotry and corruption that they receive salaries for,
a normal person can't even imagine.

you can speak as a man
you can walk as one
can be proud of your past
and the things you've done
all I read from your lips
is sweeter than gingerbread
Mr. President, I'm awake
shut your mouth, for God's sake

SHUT! SHUT! SHUT!
SHUT YOUR MOUTH! SHUT, OH PLEASE
SHUT YOUR MOUTH! SHUT, SHUT UP!

you promise good, promise work
money for everyone
but the best jobs in town
are for your daughters and your sons
why do you get the most
in this motherfucking land?
well, because all you give
is flowing back to your own hand

SHUT! ...
