[music: breitenbach-eilen-zur heide/lyrics: eilen, arranged by WARHEAD]

[A song specifically against the catholic church of the middle ages,]
[asking them to celebrate the riches of their loot - even nowadays.]

holy church it's you we hail
feed us on our holy trail
give us gold and holy food
Jesus Christ we praise our loot

could be words in mind and head
wishing harmless people dead
did you act on God's command
"cleaning" all unholy land

celebrate, celebrate
celebrate, celebrate your loot
