Where do I go?
Is life all I know?
Is pain all I feel
And time is here to heal?
And lâm watching from the other side.

There was the start
The years have played their part
A child soon a man
Whatâs left of my plans?
And the quest goes on until the end.

Who looks behind my eyes when lâm asleep?
Who looks behind my eyes when lâm down deep?

What makes me feel the way that I feel everyday?
Am I alive or dead on my lonely way?
And lâm going to meet my fate.

Who looks behind my eyes when lâm asleep?
Who looks behind my eyes when lâm down deep?
