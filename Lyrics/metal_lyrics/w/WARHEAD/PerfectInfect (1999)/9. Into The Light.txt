[music, lyrics &amp; arrangement by eilen]

Just like the light draws the butterfly,
the woman in this song is drawn to drugs which eventually kill her.
"It's over now, you went straight into the light."

the butterfly moves 'round and 'round
around the fire that burns so bright
the attraction he can't resist
the mystic sight is dragging it
into the light

you've got no wings
but you're my butterfly
so full of power when you're high
your flame is white, I lose the fight
you never stop killing yourself, you're going
into the light

it's over now ... it's over now ...
you went straight
into the light
