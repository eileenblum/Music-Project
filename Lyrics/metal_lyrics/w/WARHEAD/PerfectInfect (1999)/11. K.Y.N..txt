My apartments round the block
Downtown thereâs not much youâve got
It was my last day at work
Donât ask me if it does hurt.

Iâve got to walk
Cause they damaged my car
Last week at a slutty bar
Oh the rent lâm not able to pay
And my wife kicked me today.

Do yourself a good
In your neighbourhood
March along the floor and
Kill Your Neighbour...

People next-door drive me insane
What is their intention, what is their gain?
Theyâre disturbing me
When theyâre passing my way
And it hurts
When theyâre got nothing to say.

Thereâs nobody whoâs really good
Out there in my neighbourhood
A man hurts his wife and children cry all day
I think I better blow em all away.

Do yourself a good
These were times I remember well
Things that I can hardly tell
I do repent and I have to pay
As the priest and me
Are on my last way.
