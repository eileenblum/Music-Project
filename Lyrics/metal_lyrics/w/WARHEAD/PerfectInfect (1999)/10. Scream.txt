People are coming to take me out of my house
Donât understand the angriness of the crowd
Bursting windows raining down the floor
Donât realice what they are reaching for.

Get out.

Running falling, slavering hands on my shirt
Again and again they punch my face into the dirt
I lost my last hope when they started to beat
Iâll never get myself out of this heat.

What for shall I die?

Now they tighten the rope around my neck
A kick the chair falls down, my heart attacks
No breath no life am I going to die?
What have I done, I donât know why?

They say that you have caught him
They say heâs punished now
They say that none should mess with you
You infallible crowd
Be proud of what youâve done
For your self-righteous sense of justice
The beast is dead, this is the end
An act of fair revenge.

But didnât you know not just far away
Another little girl was raped today?
And didnât you hear bou the man sitting in jail
That he has confessed this last two murders?

Get out.
