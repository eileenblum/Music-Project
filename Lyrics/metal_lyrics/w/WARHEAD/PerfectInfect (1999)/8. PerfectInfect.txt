[Sarcastic, apocalyptic lyrics similar to Mad Max.]

now we face the end of 1999
like rats they leave the sinking ship
the higher-class mankind
tearing down the walls of inhumanity
the crowd stands up with powersaws
to show you how to bleed

straight ahead
there's no beg
you will get - perfect/infect

with unjustice and poverty
you've tried to starve us out
but Judgement-Day's not far from here,
you'll see what it's all about
we'll shower you with pestilence
until your minds get lost
there's no escape from punishment,
eradication starts

straight ahead ...

tell me when
you start to wonder why
the day you can't deny
will see you passing by
you'll be on your knees,
beg and entreat, oh please
we all just have one life
and each life says good-bye

straight ahead
there's no beg
you will get
this last good-bye

perfect/infect, perfect/infect
perfect/infect, perfect/infect
perfect/infect
