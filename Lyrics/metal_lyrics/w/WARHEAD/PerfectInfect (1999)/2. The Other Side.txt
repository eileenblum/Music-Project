Speech of the leader in front of his followers;
he demands they follow his orders and fight against their enemies.

hahahahaha! listen to me
children, listen to what I say
you're all here to find the truth
to find God and your duty
so when I say kneel
you'll have to kneel and speak to God
and now fold your hands and close your eyes
'cause this is what God has to say to you

you're here to pray along your way
into the night, the other side
and when you find the one who's blind
prepare to fight, the other side

hahahahaha! listen to me
disciples, spiritualize my speech
there's one God on this world
he says walk my way and you'll never die
so I say believe and you'll believe
'cause God speaks to you
now lay down cause I've come to heal you
your mind and your body

you're here to pray along your way
into the night, the other side
and when you find the one who's blind
prepare to fight, the other side
