[Metal song about the apocalypse and today's bigotry.]

way up, way down and no way to return
mankind that never learned
just talk 'bout love and respect but just lie in fact
I tell you that's the way you act

the deep dungeons in the heads
are filled with distrust, hate and pain
a friendly smile to keep the common face
it's the same old ugly game

SIX BILLION HUMANS CREEPING DOWN ON EARTH
HIDING FROM WHAT THEY'LL DESERVE
LIVING ONLY TO ENJOY
NOT FOR LIFE, JUST TO DESTROY

go down, go down, go down without remorse
for your own end you're the cause
go on, go on until it's to late
follow your God and stand straight

you hurt each other with your hatred
killer and victim through and through
you think you're the only exception
and for this I hate you!

SIX BILLION ...

feed the dungeons in your head
preach damnation and stand straight
feed the dungeons in your head
we know you just preach to hate
feed the dungeons, feed the dungeons
feed the dungeons in your head
