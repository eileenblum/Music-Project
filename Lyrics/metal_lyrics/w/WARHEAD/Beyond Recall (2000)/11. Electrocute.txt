[music: breitenbach / lyrics: zur heide arranged by breitenbach] 

... the Pardon Board refuses the aquittal of the murderer. Outside the courthouse there's a pro-death sentence demonstration and the people demand his annihilation ... 

Turned down! Dead man in the dock
The Pardon Board has done it's job
I break down, guards lead me away
I have lost the game

Outside people celebrate
My day of death they can't await
I shiver as I hear their words, again and again:

CLEAN OUT THE BRUTE! ELECTROCUTE!

How can I face my destiny?
The Strap-down Team's awaiting me
To end my life in chains and cells, a life in hell
To pray for delay or clemency
The last rites of humanity
Is this what is left for me?
I still hear them yell:

CLEAN OUT THE BRUTE! ELECTROCUTE!
