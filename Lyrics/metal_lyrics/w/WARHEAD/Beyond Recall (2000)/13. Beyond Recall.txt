[music: breitenbach / lyrics: eilen / arrangement by breitenbach]

... now strapped to the table he hopelessly watches the preparation of his lethal injection. As the poison enters his veins his life is beyond recall. 

It's all a mistake, this show is a fake
You fuckers, you lie, I wanted to try
And no one of you, the murderers crew
Is better than me, you're guilty in my eyes
BEYOND RECALL 

Who starts the machine?
You turn me to the screen
For you it's all a joke, you want me to choke
I still can't believe, it's only your grief
It's not, I can feel I'm not sure that you know this is

BEYOND RECALL

So look at me, look at me, you witnesses
What do you see?
Is this what makes you masturbate
For you everything's too late
The last thing I want to tell you
And I know that this is true, cause someday
You'll all die, too, and this is 

BEYOND RECALL

Cold liquid, the poison's in my veins
Oh my god, I can't describe the pain
Why can't I breathe, I'm fighting with my fate
The hell in me, you'll never stop the hate this way... 

BEYOND RECALL

This concept album tells the fictional story of a man sentenced to death awaiting his execution on death row. This is an emotional story of violence and remorse, apprehension and uncertainty, hope and desperation, told from the angle of the murderer. Beyond Recall is not making a political statement for or against capital punishment. It does not deal with guilt or innocence, justice or injustice. Futhermore the central character of this story is a person who has murdered and consequently awaits his death. This album describes his hopeless situation cought in the governmental legal system - his life torn between hate and hope, doubt and despair ... 
It all starts off with the armed robbery of a supermarket during which the perpetrator shoots two innocent employees ... 
There is no way to excuse a murder nor a chance for compensation. Beware of what you do. You are responsible!
