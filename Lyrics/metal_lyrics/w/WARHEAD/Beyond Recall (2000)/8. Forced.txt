[music: eilen-breitenbach / lyrics: zur heide-eilen / arranged by WARHEAD]

... because of the strict organisation and the brutality of his treatment he feels robbed of his dignity ... 

Life is hell, a mindless odysee
Now here I dwell, stuck in misery
Forced to draw the line, life not worth a dime
Pain rules my day, living to obey

FORCED! FORCED! 
The guard wants to provoke me
The priest wants to calm me down:
Rage is aggravating. The punishment is known
Already stopped living, No mind, no heart, no will
Captured in a death-trap, Forced to keep still

RESPECT I REGRET, RESPECT MY SHAMEFUL LIFE

Nothing left to lose, except my selfcontrol
Rage is satisfying, feelings are reborn
Got to end this nightmare, awake before I drop
To fight because I'm human
The last thing that I've got

RESPECT I REGRET, RESPECT MY SHAMEFUL LIFE

FORCED! FORCED!
FORCED! FORCED!
