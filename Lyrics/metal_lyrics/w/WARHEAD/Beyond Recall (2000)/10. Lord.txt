[music: breitenbach / lyrics: eilen / arrangement by breitenbach] 

... facing death he feels foresaken by God and his country. He never lived a christian life but it's the irony of his fate that he - like Jesus - will be executed. And didn't Jesus also say: "God, you failed!" ... 

I never thought I'd have something
In common with this man
My life was always different
To the way that god has planned
Father, this is your intention, you want me to obey
But government, it wants the same
And didn't Jesus say: 

LORD, YOU FAILED; LORD, YOU FAILED 
LORD, YOU FAILED; LORD, YOU FAILED

Now I await my destiny, regulated till the end
One man, one cell, one life, one death
I try to comprehend
I'm twisted and they say
I've got to be eliminated
If that's the way it's meant to be
You should be medicated !!!

LORD, YOU FAILED; LORD, YOU FAILED 
LORD, YOU FAILED; LORD, YOU FAILED
