[music: breitenbach / lyrics: eilen / arranged by breitenbach]

... during his first hours in the death house he is painfully overcome by the emotional memories of his family and childhood ... 

I close my eyes and see it passing by
The time when I was free
Now makes me wonder why
A child grown up in love and harmony
My brother cared about my mom and me

HELP ME OUT, THESE PAINFUL MEMORIES
FLASHING THROUGH MY MIND
HELP ME OUT, THESE PAINFUL MEMORIES
LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND

Did you forget the good times that we had
I still can see you smile and now it drives me mad
The smile turns into laughter, fades to grey
The friends I had, they turn their heads away

HELP ME OUT, THESE PAINFUL MEMORIES
FLASHING THROUGH MY MIND
HELP ME OUT, THESE PAINFUL MEMORIES
LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND

I open my eyes, shadows, dark and mean
Isolation, I am no more the one I've been
You leave me in this hell and misery
The pressure in my head is killing me
HELP ME OUT THESE PAINFUL MEMORIES
FLASHING THROUGH MY MIND
HELP ME OUT THESE PAINFUL MEMORIES
LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND
