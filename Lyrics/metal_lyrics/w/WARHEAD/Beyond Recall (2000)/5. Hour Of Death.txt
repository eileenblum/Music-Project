... years later: The day of his judgement is now certain. The execution of a fellow inmate inflames his hate towards the prison and guards ... 

The sun rises, the light is warm and bright
Another inmate soon will lose his life
One more day, one more night, that's all
For sure he'll meet his murderers at dawn

Now they are here to kill another man
The Strap-down Team, I call them the hangmen
One cell is left forever and I know
It's killing time on death row!
In my hour of death, I wish I'm not alone
You are doing wrong, this law is heresy
IN MY HOUR OF DEATH, I WISH I'M HERE NO MORE
IT'S MY ONLY HOPE; THAT'S WHAT I'M FIGHTING FOR

The sun goes down, his last night has begun
He has to say good-bye to wife and son
He had hope, the pardon on his mind
But the governor he never signs

There's still a light that shines across the yard
Working men, playing all their part 
The death house awaits the ceremony 
Who is next? It could be me!

In my hour of death, I wish I'm not alone ... 

Is there hope? Is there life?
Or will I follow him into the night?
... rejected and killed ...no,... not me !!!

Red light, glowing sky at dawn
Right now he fights the fight that can't be won
They're taking time, they're doing their duty
The job is done responsibly

Minutes, days, lifes are passing by
Another inmate, now, has lost his life
When prisoners mourn and one man had to go
It was killing time on death row!

In my hour of death, I wish I'm not alone ...
