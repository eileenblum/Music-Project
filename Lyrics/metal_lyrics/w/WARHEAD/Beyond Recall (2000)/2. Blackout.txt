... on the backseat of a squad-car he realizes for the first time what he has done and wonders about his bleak future. He's aware of his guilt and tries to justify himself with a blackout ... 

Oh let me wake up quickly, let me get outta here 
And wash away the guilt, the blood-stains on my shirt Oh my god what have I done?
Why did I use this fuckin' gun?
Why did I shoot and kill a man? and a woman, too?

BLACKOUT BLACKOUT BLACKOUT BLACKOUT 
Now here I sit on the back-seat of a squad car
What's gonna happen now? I won't say a word to any of these bastards
They won't make me bow I didn't want to kill these people I didn't want to shoot
This was never my intention
Really, I didn't want to.... 

BLACKOUT BLACKOUT BLACKOUT BLACKOUT
