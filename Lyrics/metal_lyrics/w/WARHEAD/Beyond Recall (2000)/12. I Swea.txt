[music, lyrics and arrangement by eilen]

... with his last words in the death chamber he swears, he would never kill again ... 

I swear, I'd never fail again
I swear, I'd never fail again
I swear, I'd never fail again
I swear, I'd never fail again

Well-devised from the start
No matter what I learned 
Where's the hand that I could hold
I never could return
I'm buckled on this cross-like desk
The whitnesses await
I made my life a one-way street
Pathetic lonely case
