[music: breitenbach-eilen / lyrics: zur heide / arranged by WARHEAD]

...right after the robbery the murderer tries to escape, the police search teams hard on his heels. He's soon cornered and arrested ... 

Sirens wailing 
Voices yelling 

Confusion in my head, I cannot think at all 
There's no turning back, backed against the wall 
Sirens in the air, I hear that racking sound 
The pounding of my heart, I'm feelin' they're around 

Drop the gun, turn 'round! 
Resistance is senseless! 
Drop the gun, turn 'round! 
Resistance is senseless, Senseless! 

Floodlights searching
Bloodhounds seeking

Bloody cops on my back, searching every block
I'm cought in a trap, driven into and locked
No, I won't obey, I take my chance and run
I know I'll find a way, yes, I still got my gun

Drop the gun, turn 'round!
Resistance is senseless!
Drop the gun, turn 'round!
Resistance is senseless!

Or should I stop, yield and confess it all ...
... to dwell in jail for years? No! I've got to run!

Drop the gun, turn 'round!
Resistance is senseless!
