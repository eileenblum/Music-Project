[Savatage cover]

Hi - Welcome to hell
You are all here
For this where you must dwell
Sinners and cheats
Sit here with Satan
And have all your spirits meet

Oh city beneath the surface above
How you survive on evil and blood
You breathers in this space
You never can leave this place

Die - We all must die
How will you face it
When you bend to your knees and cry
Burn - Like witches burn
When will you sinners believe
That it's your time to learn?

Oh city beneath the surface above
How you survive on evil and blood
You breathers in this space
You never can leave this place

You breathe earth's inner space
You never can leave this place

Punished for the way that you lived
Raping and stealing
But never one thought to give
Here forever - not a trail or a trace
Total illusions of tales
Of the unholy place
