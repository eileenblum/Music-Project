What do you think
While you are running here
Between the bushes in the rain?
What do you feel
Inside your fucking head?
Cause now your "real me" goes insane

I will take your soul
For my own pleasure
Many of you warheads
Went that way before

Be careful what you say
It takes your breath away
It takes your life

Just another War

Once again
You hear the hammering on the outside
The helicopters in the sky
You try to run
But you can't control your legs
You realize it's time to die

I will take your soul
For my own pleasure
Many of you warheads
Went that way before

Be careful what you say
It takes your breath away
It takes your life

Just another War

Did you ever think
That your government
Tells you the truth about your war?
You crossed the boarderline,
Sawed the seeds of death
But in the end i beg for more

I will take your soul
For my own pleasure
Many of you warheads
Went that way before

Be careful what you say
It takes your breath away
It takes your life

Just another War
