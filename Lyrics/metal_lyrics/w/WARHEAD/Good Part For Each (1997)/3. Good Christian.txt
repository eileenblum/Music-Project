[music: breitenbach]
[lyrics: zur heide]
[arranged by breitenbach ]

shades of blood
and shades of inhumanity
we can see
your trace throughout history
decades of hope
you brought up to society
and centuries of pain
and hopelessness and misery

your mission is perfect
you spread and infect
annoying insect

good christians

crucifictions
forgiven when you cross yourself
in the name of god
millions have been sent to hell
is it faith
what makes you look up to the priest
or ignorance
or the fear of the beast?

your mission is perfect
you spread and infect
annoying insect

good christians
