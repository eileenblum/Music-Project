[arranged by breitenbach]

a little room with a lattice window
here i live there's nothing more
outside concrete, grey and cold
this is my home, i'm the one who's left
the second made me be the one i am
the stories people tell here are heavy
and this is mine...

oh my love was great,
thought that i am the only one you need
you gave me the only
meaning to my life
i changed everything for you
said that we'd love until we die
and somehow
we made the words come true

the first year we were together
nothing bad i did expect
two people in a world full of honey
and slowly i got blind
something happenedin the second year
we were kissing but our eyes weren't closed
and sex became a different thing
than we did a few weeks ago

i didn't want to realize it
i didn't want to see
you said you went to the doctor
what a beautiful lie
for the time we didn't speak too much
and what we spoke was simply shit
i knew i would like to get rid of it

so one day you were calling the "doctor"
and i saw you leaving our home
i followed you to his place
and looked through the window
you were kissing
you were pissing
you were fucking that man
and i was watching you

so believe, i jumped through the window
to get you, my dear
i was taking the knife that i had
and ram it into your head

good-bye!
