[arranged by WARHEAD]

the black door of a big neglected building
they call it papermill, we call it excess
i step inside, cold light shines
from a lantern outside, i feel depressed
i know this way well, so i walk down
to the basement to meet "me", friend
the rave-party starts right now
i ask for pills, enjoy that thrill

going, going to, yo

going to the center
let me arrive
going to the center
splitting my life

the first song they play, my heart beats fast
i feel the tension, escape from within
the bassdrum's hammering in my head
the dancefloor quakes, it makes me awake
the entrance to a better world somewhere in me
calls for me, some kind of error
i dance a thousand years or more
i'm lost in a vision, a lovely terror

going, going to, yo

going to the center
let me arrive
going to the center
splitting my life

a few hours passed by, i'm still dancing
it keeps me moving on, the beat and the sound
i find myself on the floor as i dance some more
it got me down

going, going to, yo

going to the center
let me arrive...
