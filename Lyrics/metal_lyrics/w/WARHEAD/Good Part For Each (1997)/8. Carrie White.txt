[music: eilen - breitenbach]
[lyrics: eilen]
[arranged by breitenbach]

this is your life-long atmosphere
your mother keeps you trapped in here
a cruel world you can't escape
your name is carrie, you're in bad shape

your mother's mentally deranged
so you can't cope with life outside
the things she teaches you are strange
you can't differ the truth from lies

carrie white

you stand alone in the world of pain
your suffering is your mother's gain
the bloody child of a bloody ass
your whole life a total mess

there is no helping hand at school
no real friends you can talk to
no mercy, treated like a fool
it's just your mom who talks to you

carrie white

as you begin to realize
there's a power behind your eyes
satisfied, hear your mother yell
it is the exit out of hell

the ones who treated you so bad
are watching you now going mad
you kill the ones that took your pride
your final deed, the suicide!

carrie white
