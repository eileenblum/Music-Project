[arranged by WARHEAD]

a tear drops down from your face
the wrong thing at the right place
your eyes a touch of nothing
your captured

the bloody truth is, you're stoned again
feel the needle in your veins
buy the stuff and be dead

a little higher you get
eat pills instead eating bread
emotions you share with pain
you're insane

as long as you are satisfied
you're standing on the good side
a hell's what you're living in

blindly

close the door behind your eyes
await the big surprise
the fire is burning cold
your life's sold

the stab hurts you, never care
a dead body, a living nightmare
it gets you before you can get it

the beginning of the end
the opinion you had to defend
the walk into the fire
your desire

never stop, go on and on
nothing's right but you are wrong
you have gone one step too far!

blindly
