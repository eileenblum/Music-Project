[arranged by breitenbach]

the black sunshine high above
smell dead children, forget to love
soul burns brightly, never see
never hear a word from me
one door is open, one door is locked
i am the mountain, the highest rock
you'll never reach the end until
your hands work for my own will

hurgh

a loaded pistol in your hand
will never be my command
the dream you reach in your mind
well, i'm polite, you'll never find
without my hand, without my feet
a man is nothing more than meat
hell is for those who criticize
the truth, it lies behind my eyes

hurgh

i don't possess you, i don't care
that's not my kind of warfare
trust me, you're small together we're tall
when you give me your life, child
it is the last time you will smile
for me the biggest, endless thrill
you never thought that i'd kill

hurgh

and from the point that you are mine
you start to learn a different side
the one who reaches out for me
is trapped by sick misanthropy
cause i deliver you from good
i treat you like nobody would
say hello to the masters knife
and say good-bye to the beat of life

hurgh

huuuooaaarrsire!!!
