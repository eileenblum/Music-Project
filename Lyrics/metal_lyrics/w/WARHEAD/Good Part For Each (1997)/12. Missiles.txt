[music: eilen]
[lyrics: eilen]
[arranged by eilen]

now here i stand, i've got no eyes
got no hands, no arms to embrace
the darkest day, crossed man's way
can't describe the sorrow in me

missiles never win
missiles never care
missiles never win
missiles

the papers said that we would try
nuclear weapons we say good-bye
but a few more tests, some islands sink
jack, we can do without sorrow you bring

missiles never win
missiles never care
missiles never win
missiles

the dead, they cry, do we need more?
where's the sense? what is it good for?

missiles never win
missiles never care
missiles never win
missiles
