â¦We are almost wholeâ¦
â¦We have burned it down â again and againâ¦
â¦Returning to foundation â year after yearâ¦
â¦Suffering from neglect and deteriorationâ¦
We are almost whole
We have burned it down â again and again
Returning to foundation â year after year
Suffering from neglect and deterioration

Bodies waiting for demolition
Once and for all

Weâre taking closure with satisfaction
There could be no turning back
Deny yourself your mixed emotions
You have a job to do, so wipe away your tears
And drive it forward now

I see you falling apart, but I know youâre not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know youâre not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know youâre not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know youâre not worth tearing down

â¦The floor is running out beneath usâ¦
â¦The caving roof was pouring inâ¦
â¦Broken glass lie all around usâ¦
â¦The doors will slam right off their hingesâ¦
The floor is running out beneath us
The caving roof was pouring in
Broken glass lie all around us
The doors will slam right off their hinges

Weâre past the point of no return here
Nothing can be salvaged now
So look past your hesitations
You have a job to do, so gather up your strength
And drive it forward now

I see you falling apart, but I know youâre not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know youâre not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know youâre not worth tearing down
I see you falling apart, but I know youâre not worth tearing down

Iâm afraid to start this
I want to tear you down
But if you leave without this
Iâm going to tear it all right down
Right now

â¦We are almost wholeâ¦ (â¦The floor is running out beneath usâ¦)
â¦We have burned it down â again and againâ¦ (â¦The caving roof was pouring inâ¦)
â¦Returning to foundation â year after yearâ¦ (â¦Broken glass lie all around usâ¦)
â¦Suffering from neglect and deteriorationâ¦ (â¦The doors will slam right off their hingesâ¦)
