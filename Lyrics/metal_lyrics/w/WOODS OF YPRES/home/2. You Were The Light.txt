Your pretty causes
Make great conversation
While another world is yearning
Painfully for an end

And who will save me now
Now that you are gone
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life

Think of me when you are weak
Whenever when you are strong
Pretending that I'm OK
Will comfort when you are lost

And who will save me now
Now that you are gone
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life

Close the door and cry,
Or lock it up from the outside.
Look down on me from the balcony,
And hold the railing tight.

And if you changed your mind
Then you are justified
And if you changed your mind
You'd know that you were right

And you will be just fine

The more you knew
The less you wanted to
You made our decisions on your own
And left me without a choice to choose

None of this
Will ever haunt you now
Since there is no one else
Accounting for your cruelty but me
You will see no consequence
And though I am not to blame
I suffer all the same

And who will save me now
Now that you are gone (now that you are gone)
And who will save you from yourself
You were the light
That shone brightly in the night
You were the light
That shone harshly on my life
You were the light
That flash and left me in the dark
You were the light
The only light I'll ever know
You were the light
You were the light
You were the light
You were the light
