We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way

I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, for as long as I live

Can you feel the hatred, from your fellow man?
Can you see his ignorance? Unfortunately I can.

There's nothing more to say. There's nothing to discuss.
Enough words have already been heard. Enough deeds, been done.
You are not a mystery to us. We know exactly who you are.
And for as long as you might live, you are dead to us.
We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way

I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, for as long as I live

Can you feel the envy, from you fellow man?
Can you see his ignorance? Unfortunately I can.

There's nothing more to say. There's nothing to discuss.
For I can see the fear in your eyes as you try to act tough
And as we rise up from the muck, we are filled with disgust (even more)
To realize that you ever thought, you were in the same league as us
We dug this hole for ourselves, but we'll gladly bury you instead
After having sacrificed yourselves, by standing in our way

I can hold the Iron Grudge, like a fist!
I can hold the Iron Grudge, and never lose my grip

I'm not your stepping-stone, I'm not your fucking crutch.
And for as long as you might live, I can hold the Iron Grudge!

I can hold the Iron Grudge!
Long live the Iron Grudge!

So go ahead and waste your time, it will keep you further behind!
Suffer!
