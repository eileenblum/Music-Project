Drag that fuckin' weight man,
Drag that weight and breathe
Pull that fuckin' anchor across the rocks, push that mountain into the sea

Drag that Weight! Over Foreign Landscapes! Drag that Weight!

Like a 10 ton stone statue, standing before miles of mountains
In a foreign land, where you don't speak the language there

I feel so heavy man... So I drag that weight!
And I drag that weight over foreign landscapes

Slow and heavy!

Drag that fuckin' weight man,
Drag that weight and breathe
Pull that fuckin' anchor across the rocks, push that mountain into the sea
