Life is just pain and piss; it's nothing that I will miss
Life is just pain and piss; it's just... temporary
Life is the madness of a drunken city night
With wet leather on your back and rain dripping off your spikes

PAIN! Life is just pain and piss. PISS! It's nothing that I will miss.
PAIN! Life is just pain and piss and everything is a scam

Life is your hopes and dreams, your expectations
When your health is a full-time job, and there's no vacation
Life is the comfort of a good friend's advice
Who says it's all your fault and your standards are too high

PAIN! Life is just pain and piss. PISS! It's nothing that I will miss.
I'm always doing something to hurt myself just trying to feel alive

Life is the impact of a falling brick wall of rain
Coming down on your long walk home when your thoughts are sobering
Life is your consciousness as you tame your wild beasts
When exhaustion is the currency that you must pay for sleep

Life is just pain and piss; it's nothing that I will miss
Life is just pain and piss; it's just... temporary
Life is the madness of a drunken city night
