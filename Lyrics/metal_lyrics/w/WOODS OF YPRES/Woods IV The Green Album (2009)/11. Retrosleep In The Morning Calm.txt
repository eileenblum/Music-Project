It's good that I sleep alone... so often
Because I toss and turn so much, I feel bad when I disturb my partner
It's okay that I toss and turn... all night, every night
Because I sleep alone so often, I feel bad when I've disturbed my partner
It's good that I'm alone, because I sleep so much so often
And I sleep so much because I am alone, so often, all the time

It's good that I sleep alone... so often
Because I toss and turn so much, I feel bad when I disturb my partner
It's okay that I toss and turn... all night, every night
