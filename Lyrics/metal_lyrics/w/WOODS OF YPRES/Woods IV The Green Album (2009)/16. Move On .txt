The woman will always leave the man.

You may come together, in the lust of summer,
And she may stay with you, to see the autumn colours,
And love you through the winter, in your warm and cozy home,
But by the time that spring arrives... she'll be gone.

The woman will always leave the man.
Women move on, and men love forever.

Women move one. Men move on. Women move one. Men! Move on!
Men! Move on! Men! Move on! Men! Move on! Men! Move on!
