[Part One: The Mirror Reflection]

I was right all along, and I was wrong to believe,
Foolish to doubt the self-respecting truths, I learned while suffering.

Nothing happens for any reason, there is no plan.
We are all just random beings, not destined for anything.

The world is nothing, disguised as something it is not.
Aspire to be something, appearing as you really are.

Dig deep to find your strength, trust that wisdom comes with age.
But when ways of old have been outgrown, don't hesitate to chop them down

Once you've been leveled out, reconnect with yourself again.
When new ideas have led you astray, return yourself to whom you once became.

The world is nothing, disguised as something it is not.
Aspire to be something, appearing as you really are.

Cut yourself down to the stem. Stand upon level ground again.
Tear yourself all the way down and rebuild yourself in solitude.

When left alone, the forests renew themselves.
When left alone, man improves himself, as well.

You always knew, one day you would destroy me.
And I always knew I would have to be the one to restore me.

[Part Two: The Hammer Reinvention]

Your need for self-reflection is a reflection of you and a sign of the times.
Your use of self-expression is a weapon in the age in which we live.

When you hold the hammer, you are the weapon,
Smash the mirror for seven years of self-sacrifice.
When you hold the mirror, you're in reflection,
Reflect the truth and not the curse of superstition.

I thought you were taking pictures of me,
But that was just the lights burning out!
It was no one's dream to follow me,
When everyone wants to be followed themselves.

Your self-expression is a reflection of the mind.
Use it to make peace with yourself,
Those around you and the age in which you live.

Make peace with the age in which you live.

Your need for self-reflection is a reflection of you and a sign of the times.

But that was just the lights burning out!
It was no one's dream to follow me,
When everyone wants to be followed themselves.

Your self-expression is a weapon of the mind.
Use it to defend yourself, threaten others and enhance your life.

Threaten others and enhance your life.
