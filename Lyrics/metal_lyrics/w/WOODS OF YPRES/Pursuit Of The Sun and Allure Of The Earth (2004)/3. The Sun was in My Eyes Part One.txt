The sun was in my eyes
It blackened my sight
I was high with conviction
That I was invincible

The sun was in my eyes
I was stricken blind
I believed I could see through the dark
As I followed the un-guiding light

Pursuing the sun
While causes of mine are still alive
But barely carry on

Pursuing the sun
While friends lay in beds
Recovering from their recklessness

Give in to all the temptation
Give up on all your beliefs
Forget the feeling of the changing of seasons
Wishing that summer would go on forever
How long before it would get old
Would you miss looking forward to when it starts to get cold

The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see

The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light

The sun was in my eyes
Putting it off for a rainy day
When it pours I'll stay indoors
To try to make things right

The sun was in my eyes
Thin ice on a summer's day
As I procrastinate
It falls apart and melts away

Pursuing the sun
While causes of mine are still alive
But barely carry on

Pursuing the sun
While friends lay in beds
Recovering from their recklessness

Going after the pleasures of summer
Betray the comforts of our dark little space
Believe their healing will cure all your trauma
Becoming the person you've claim to hate
True colors are shining through
Trading the black for the yellow, green and blue

The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see

The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light

When summer came
I was overcome
Pursuing the sun and its hot summer days
On the long road on the way to the grave
