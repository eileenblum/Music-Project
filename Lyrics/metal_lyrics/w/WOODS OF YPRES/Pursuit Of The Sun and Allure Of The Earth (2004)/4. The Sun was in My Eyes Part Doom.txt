The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see

The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light

The sun was in my eyes
I could not see
Please find it in your heart
To forgive me

Pursuing the sun because you can
But still tell the night you'll still see each other now and again
Let him down softly, be polite
Reassure him all the same that things will be like they've always have been

A fragile boy
With needs on you he depends
Who measures how much
It all meant to you by how quickly you left

A fragile boy
With needs on you he depends
With your negligence
You have pushed him to the edge

It was the darkness that kept us together...
...It was the light that led you away

You control our destiny
Reduce it back to an idea
I beg of you from agony
Please conform to decency

The sun was in my eyes
It came through the trees
Consumed all of my mind
It was all I could see

The sun was in my eyes
Something became of my life
I left all else behind
And starred into the light

The sun is shallow
It will shine for anyone
The night is loyal
Only to those who are true
Time will fly as you pursue the sun
But the night will be long and cold
And it will wait for you at home

When summer came
I was overcome
Something lost for something gained
Pursuing the sun and it's hot summer days
On the long, backstabbing back-road on the way to the grave
