Curse all those who were so vainÂ 
who felt entitled to hold a place on the earth as a grave for their remains
but no monument for me, please... I am not one of them
I didn't need it in life, I wont need it in death

Whoa, just kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa, when I die...kiss my ashes goodbye

When words become irrelevant,Â 
and you start to feel as though ...you've been misled
Keep me out of sight, leave me out of mind...
when the thought no longer serves you 
when I no longer serve you, just let the memories die (...and move on)

Whoa, kiss my ashes goodbye
Whoa, when I die...kiss my ashes goodbye
