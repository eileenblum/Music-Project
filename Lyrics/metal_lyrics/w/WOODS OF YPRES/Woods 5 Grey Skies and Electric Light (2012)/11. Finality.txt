When we have all gone, to the silence of eternity...Â 
To first be forgotten, and lost in, the records of the earth
Could I still miss you, then, in the time and space after life
When no one is searching  anymore, and where we are nowhere to be foundÂ 

We didn't spend our life together
and I will miss you forever

The choice was mine, To long for a time, that will never come
Though we leave the world apart, I, still went peacefully, quietly,Â 
with you, still, firmly... in my heart.

I will wait forever. Â I wait...
