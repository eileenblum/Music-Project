In the darkness, under the stars, With enough warning, to pull off to the side, in time

In the end, was there anyone to share in your joy?
I woke up one day...and realized it was already over

Back On the highway, under the moon, my final moments, still wondering about you...

In the end, was there anyone to share in your joy?
I woke up for years without you, to realize it was already over, for meÂ 

Now making amendments... to the dream / story...
Changing the ending, as I would like it, to be

We were together, in a memory
And We live forever, in finality.

Holding on...To a dream...Â 
When the end... couldn't come slow enough for me.Â 

Holding on...
