Three stuck over and out like jagged rocks one night.
And as for me, we talked about things that are only delight.
The reasons of places of people that have been.
But as of things I have seen, there is no end.

I am speaking of course of civilization that we all count ourselves as
being part of.
I am your friend with happiness and glee.
The following shall be in a creational sense.
Like a road with a bed on it.
There is nothing in place to repeat.

All the creatures of the world must stop and listen to the wind.

A murdered woman is sprawled out on the floor.
Stop and look into her dead eye.
