So I let things pile up
I prefer the trash to the bath
Such an unbearable need

In the backseat
He's been there ten days
In the back of my car
There's been too much so far
Then I stick my hand out the window
Theres a church hanging
A civilized scapegoat
I smell the sting

I'd kill anyone for water
Just to climb a hill
But it spills on the way back
This desert's like stepping on tacks

Well I'm just a camel, man
I can't even wait, there's a cave ahead

I'm sometimes down
It hurts me through my teeth
There are some things worth checking in the cave

It's been ten days
And too many times I never went to rest
And too many times I've been careless
But not enough

I'm coming on like a wretched hog
I'm coming on like a naked bitch

I'm coming on like a wretched mess
Cause boast company has more has less
I'm coming on cause I asked you well
