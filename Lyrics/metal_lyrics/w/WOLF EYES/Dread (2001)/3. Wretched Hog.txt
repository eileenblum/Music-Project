Am I alive or am I dead?
You fucked the walls
You better fuck the head

This was because I'm half animal and half insane
Because I'm environmental athian lain
This was because I'm half animal and half insane
You shouldn't even know my name

I'm standing here 'cause I'm standing in shade
I'm having troubles with the fishes main spade
I've waited for so long
"What's his name, date?"

I've waited very slowly the whole day
I'm comin' on 'cause I think I'm brave
This was because I'm half animal and half insane
