My eyes are slowly dilating pure white
Skin stretched as if about to tear
There's a wretched stench of rotting limbs
Erect I am from this smell
Pain, please end the pain
I submit to whoever is causing this pain
In a sense I enjoy the agony
Subconsciously I am aroused
By now I should be fucking dead
But these sacred grounds I still tread
Never underestimate immortality
My memory is slowly wallowing back
I have the power of possession in my hands
Becoming stronger every step that I take
I will destroy what has done this to me
Human scum will abide by my words
This planet is doomed
Pray for a savior to liberate your kind
Beg for peace
It will expire
I am here
To seal your fucking fate
Scum of the earth
You're all a fucking waste of life
No heretic will stop what is invincible
How could I thank you for your time
My name will forever live inside those who appreciate
The absence of light and suffering
I assure everything isn't what it seems to be
Fuck your faith
Fuck your kind
Fuck your ways
Fuck your world
