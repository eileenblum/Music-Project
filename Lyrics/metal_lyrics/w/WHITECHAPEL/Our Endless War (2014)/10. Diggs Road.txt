Suicide
It brings me light

Itâs the only way I know how to cope with this
These tears are burning holes in my face
My memory of them is worthless
Now a memory forever erased

Even if you're in hell
Iâll go down in flames just to see your faces again
But until that day Iâll sit here and wait to die
Cause time doesnât heal a thing

Suicide is the only thing left for me
Time does not heal anything

I saw you both in a dream
Your arms stretched out
Reaching for me
In the night I woke
Calling your names
Itâs so depressing
Time won't heal a thing

[Solo]

In my dreams is where I seem to find you
Consciousness
Is living hell
Close these eyes
Forever I will sleep

[Whisper]
Forever I'll sleep
To feel your touch
Iâll close my eyes
Iâll come to you
So I can see you
Again

Iâll come to you
Cause time won't heal a thing

Even if you're in hell
Iâll go down in flames just to see your faces again
But until that day Iâll sit here and wait to die
Cause time doesnât heal a thing

Cause time doesnât heal
Time won't heal
Time doesnât heal
A thing
