This is our way of life

And we sleep away our misery in our blood-soaked sheets
Weâve left our homes to infect the world and addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars, infinite blood to bleed
Our presence stops your heart and leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees and recognize your new found king
Where we come from, the saw is the law
When thereâs no hope left, we will not fall
Among the giants, we still stand tall and we will not be stopped
Just let it go and let the wind blow
Itâs like a hurricane inside your head
The pressureâs never ending but your brain is still depending and comprehending why it is still defending just let go and be one with the family

Your life decisions have become our control and we will swallow this world whole
You are, you are nothing
We are everything, you are nothing without us

This is our way of life
Taking cities one by one
Carefully choose your side
You could be one of many sons
This is our way of life
Deafening ears and shutting mouths
Come and join our side
Welcome to the deep south

This is our way of life

Weâve left our homes to infect the world and addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars, infinite blood to bleed
Our presence stops your heart and leaves you six feet deep

Fall to your knees and recognize your new found king
Where we come from, the saw is the law
When thereâs no hope left, we will not fall
Among the giants, we still stand tall and we will not be stopped
Just let it go and let the wind blow
Itâs like a hurricane inside your head
The pressureâs never ending but your brain is still depending and comprehending why it is still defending just let go and be one with the family

Your life decisions have become our control and we will swallow this world whole

You are nothing
We are everything [3x]
