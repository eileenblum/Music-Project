May we dwell in madness
And commit to our desire of sin
Of man, one wish
Break these chains to psychopathy

And now we roam the night, searching for blood
Innocent, deserving, we will silence them all

Believe in yourself that desires within will come alive tonight
The desire of sin
For this night, I will give my soul
To exterminate everything bitter and cold
Take off the mask of morality
Then we'll lie, cheat, steal and murder everything
We have dark, tarred souls underneath
So come out tonight and dance with me

The night is young
Come out tonight

The wolves come out and the sun is nevermore
The virgin mother earth becomes our whore
On this night the universe stands still
And we hold the powerless gods against their will

Fight
The gods have no power here
Tonight
We are the ones they fear
