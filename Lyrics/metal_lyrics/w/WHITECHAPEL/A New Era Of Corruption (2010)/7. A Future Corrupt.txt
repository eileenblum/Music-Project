Forced into my own psychotic prison
The future of science bred into my blood
The evilest of creatures wish for such empowering traits
No one man can inherit a bloodline
Such as this man made destructive power
The darkest evils of the world
Feed my youth and bathe them in depravity
Wash their hands of this sickness that reigns in the sky
Forced into my own psychotic prison
The future of science bred into my blood
The evilest of creatures wish for such empowering traits
Gather the virgins, secure my children in their womb
Their chastity is a waste, remove their purity
My children at last be born into the world
My children at last be born into the world
My children at last be born into the world
The impossible is now the future of your dying earth
Even the wisest of men follow a path of failure
It's a shame that this is what your race breeds
Blindly following the culture you mislead
The demise of this era is among us
