Forever the darkness prevails
The sun has set as darkness prevails
Now we all devolve and rot in hell
These are the words of the suffering lords
Dethroned they remain, degraded as they burn
Welcome to hell, where suffering reigns
Hypocrite tongues, they speak
Wishing for death, wishing for the end
Like cowards they flee
Welcome to hell, where suffering reigns
The most worthless creation of all
Has finally devolved to something beautiful
Nothing
They are obsolete
And now the creator has fell to his knees
The most worthless creation of all
Has finally devolved to something beautiful
Nothing
They are obsolete
And now the creator has fell to his knees
Now they pray for a savior to come
That savior is dead
This is what I long for
This is what I live for
This is what I long for
This is what I live for
They said they would return
Now their souls are all frozen in time
We have waited all our lives for this moment to come
The time has arrived
The new era has begun
This is what I long for
This is what I live for
We are the ones who detest your lies
Reverse the cycle, reduced to nothingness
Welcome to hell, where the suffering reigns
The most worthless creation of all
Has finally devolved to something beautiful
Nothing
They are obsolete
And now the creator has fell to his knees
The most worthless creation of all
Has finally devolved to something beautiful
Nothing
They are obsolete
And now the creator has fell to his knees
