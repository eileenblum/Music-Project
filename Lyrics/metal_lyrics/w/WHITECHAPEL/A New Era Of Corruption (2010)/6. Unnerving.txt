I am God
For I am not a man nor a machine or the highest soul of immortality
I am not you, I am not me
Yet I still control all the things that be
For I am not the fake image your eyes want to believe
But I will change the world only for the worse
There is a reason why I have you here
To overtake your mind and multiply your fear of me, God
Does this feel familiar
Does this feel familiar
I am everything you hate
I am everything you hate
For I am not the fake image your eyes want to believe
But I will change the world only for the worse
It wouldn't be a problem
To initiate the process of elimination of a planet
And the fucking hypocrites it breeds
Destroy them all
Hate
Hate
Will
Will
Cleanse us all
The forces of good and evil are yourselves don't you see
You have made your mind believe that you couldn't exist without me
Your morals are dead
This is psychological rot at its finest form
Hate will cleanse us all
Hate
Hate
Will
Will
Cleanse us all
I am everything you hate
I am everything you hate
