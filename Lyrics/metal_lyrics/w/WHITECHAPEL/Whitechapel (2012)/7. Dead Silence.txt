You'll never figure this out.
This is the reason the world is filled with doubt.
You'll never figure this out.
This is the reason the world won't shut their mouth.

Shut your fucking mouth.

Who the fuck do you think you are?
I am willing to listen but I'm not willing to follow these hollow words, they kill, they rape, they destroy everything.
Stop wasting your life telling me when I'll lose mine.

Your words will be erased when I seal your mouth and pull your tongue right through your throat.
We are the ones who control our lives.
Never let them decide.
When we will meet our demise.
We refuse these lies.

You'll never figure this out.

Who the fuck do you think we are?
How can you sit there and tell us when we will die, then it fails us again.
You bleed, we bleed, what's the point of these lies?
Stop wasting your life telling me when I'll lose mine.

You'll never figure this out.

You'll never figure this out, how can you be one with the dead, when you're split in fucking two.
How can you be one with the dead, when you're split in fucking two.
How can you be one with the dead, it's better left unsaid.

We are the ones who control our lives.
Never let them decide.
When we will meet our demise.
We refuse these lies.
