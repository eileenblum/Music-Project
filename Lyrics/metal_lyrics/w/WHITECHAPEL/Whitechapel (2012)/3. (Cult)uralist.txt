Just wait, the suffering will come.
When you're exposing yourself to a Hell you can't corrupt.
All I hear are words, no actions, to stop this plague.
I'm just a fraction of humanity waiting to die, waiting for these nightmares to subside.
This is not a question of how you will prevail, it's a question of what will you say when you're burning in Hell.

What will you say when you're burning in Hell?

I won't be the one to fall, I'll kill you all.
Before you take everything behind these walls.
I will never submit until you commit.
To quit living in shit, hope will never be a vision when religion has become the contradiction.
That we all decide to live in.
Think for yourself.
As life goes on, I'll tell the tale of how you burn in Hell.

I won't be the one to fall, I will kill you all.

I will never conform to organize my allegiance to the life I've designed.
I will never let society decide.
I will kill you all.

I won't be the one to fall.
I will kill you all.
