We've been somatically defiled, exiled, and now this new era has come to an end.
Go!

I forever crave the things that will never be changed.
I would rather take my own life than wait until the day.
They see everyone, everything.
Promising eternal fortune for the price of your life.
We ignite the fire for the highest degree of Hell.
You bought it with your brain, now you'll forever burn.
Now normality cease to be.
Hopefully you can withstand the thought of being dead.

This life; I have never seen such disgust for power and lust.
This life; it's a tragedy, someone get me out, someone please help.
Tonight; I have realized this is my last night to be alive.
This mind; it begins to see, it begins to breathe, make it bleed.

Make it bleed.

I forever crave the things that will never be changed.
I would rather take my own life than wait until the day.
They see everyone, everything.
Promising eternal fortune for the price of your life.
We ignite the fire for the highest degree of Hell.
You bought it with your brain, now you'll forever burn.
Now normality cease to be.
Hopefully you can withstand the thought of being dead.

When it all falls apart, I'll be the one that's standing over your corpse.
With my foot on your face embracing the darkness of your days.
Embracing the darkness... of your days!
