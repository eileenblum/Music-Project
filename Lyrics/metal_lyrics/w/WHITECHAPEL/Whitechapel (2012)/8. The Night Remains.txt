There is a place where the seas flow deep red.
Sounds of the night, our ears have eternally wed.
Where every hero lay slain.
For the sunlight dies and the night remains.

The light of a million fires could not bring your eyes to see.
The hounds of Hell conspire.
Extinguish the sun and bring forth the night.
Tidal waves of blood crash down on the lifeless bodies.
The dead become revived.
The horrors of the night shall never sleep again.
Bring forth the night.

The night remains.

Tidal waves of blood crash down on the lifeless bodies.
The dead become revived.
The horrors of the night shall never sleep again.
Bring forth the night.

(Believe me when I say, the sun will disappear.
And the night will remain.)

Everything has fallen silent, the tide begins to recede and calms.
This is only a place for violence.
Rid yourself and never return.
There is a place where the seas flow deep red.
Your eyes go blind and the night remains.
