Grinding again
We're the legion of the south
Another year with our name in your mouth
I know how it feels to hate everything
And feel like you're alone
I am here with you just close your eyes
And listen to my voice
Spill your thoughts inside of me
They'll vanish in the void
No one can feel what we feel
This is family
Just let them burn in the fire that we've set on the world
Close your eyes and follow the sound of my voice
We are the void
Where the pain is obsolete
You don't have to feel a thing
Or think that life is not complete
We are the void
Just let go and free your mind
Come with us into eternity
And leave the rest to die
Never again will I be on this earth
Float with me into the void and witness rebirth
The overwhelming beauty takes the air from your lungs
Time doesn't exist, we'll stay forever young
When you think you're lost
Close your eyes and follow the sound of my voice
We are the void
You don't have to live a lie
Be yourself and nothing less
Take my hand and we'll watch the world burn from the sky
Take my hand and we'll watch the world burn
And be where we're supposed to be
Take my hand and we'll watch the world burn from the sky
