I know you can feel it
Let it in
People will still hate you in the end
So hate back
Plan the attack then they'll realize they can't crack
The mind of a fucking maniac

The voice inside you always wins
Your graves been dug so lie in it
And commit until the end for your dear old friend
And I promise that amends will meet at the end

Why can't I be anything without you

Because the scars will fade and you'll never age
When you give your life to the mark of the blade

The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything 
If you give your life to the mark of the blade

You can come with me or you can stay and grow old
And let the universe swallow your rotting soul
Turn a blind eye to everything or take a chance to be blind to model ignorance

The voice inside you never quits
It'll haunt you until your dying breath
So breathe in and breathe out
Reach deep within
And I promise that amends will meet at the end

Why can't I be anything without you

Because the scars will fade and you'll never age
When you give your life to the mark of the blade

The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything 
If you give your life to the mark of the blade

Give your life to the mark of the blade 
(Give your life)
I'll take your name beyond the grave

Give your life to the mark of the blade 
(Give your life)
Give your life to the mark of the blade 

I bleed the blood that is cut from the blade
I bear the mark and i won't be a slave
Come with me and be saved

Why can't I be anything without you

Because the scars will fade and you'll never age
When you give your life to the mark of the blade

The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything 
If you give your life to the mark of the blade
