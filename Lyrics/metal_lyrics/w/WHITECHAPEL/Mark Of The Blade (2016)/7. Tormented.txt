The cold air hits my lungs
All is silent
I can't stop biting my tongue
I feel so violent

They say that I'm nothing
That I am better off dead
They're right in my head
But I won't leave this earth without theirs
I hate the man you've made me become
Take responsibility
When it's the innocent one's turn to bleed
What you call normality is everything I want to be

Fuck the world, I don't care anymore
All I wanted was a friend, not to be ignored
I know where you lay your head
It's with the rest of the ones in my basement
Fuck the world, I don't care anymore

Shut me down, shut me out
Now that the tables have turned
Please tell me how does it feel
That everyone you know and love will be killed
Shut me down, shut me out
Now that everyone's dead
Please tell me how does it feel
That everyone you know and love has been killed

Everything I am
Is everything I hate
Because of you

When will people learn
That their words create a flame
That burns forever
You've created a monster
It's growing stronger
We won't be alive much longer
Forget the future, the past has come back
So take a moment to hope you're forgiven
I doubt that
You reap what you sow
You pay what you owe
And unfortunately for you it's your soul

Fuck the world, I don't care anymore
All I wanted was a friend, not to be ignored
I know where you lay your head
It's with the rest of the ones in my basement
Fuck the world, I don't care anymore

Shut me down, shut me out
Now that the tables have turned
Please tell me how does it feel
That everyone you know and love will be killed
Shut me down, shut me out
Now that everyone's dead
Please tell me how does it feel
That everyone you know and love has been killed
