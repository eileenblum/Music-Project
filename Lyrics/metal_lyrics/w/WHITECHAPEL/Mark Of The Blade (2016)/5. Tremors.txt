I bet you won't have much to say
When a sledgehammer rares back and busts you in your face
Pop another pill, pretend you're not fake
Come to think of it, maybe you life's a mistake

Don't breathe, don't speak
I need a moment to think what you would be without me
You are the bane of everything
Nothing will ever be the same

Don't think that you're better off now
Or you have a clean slate
How can you sleep at night
When the earth shakes, just self-medicate

Don't think that you're better off now
Or you have a clean slate
How can you sleep at night
When the earth shakes, just self-medicate

Two thousand miles away
Even I can feel the earth shake
When you say
That everything will be okay
There's nothing left
We're facing death
And you still can't admit
That everything won't be okay

They will say it's lonely at the top
But it's a nightmare at the bottom
They'll never stop to think or feel
Don't tell me you're alone
When I'm lying here dying
At the foot of their throne
Misguide me, mislead me
Take me away from everyone that needs me
I'm drowning, I'm dying
And you still won't reach me
I'm drowning, I'm dying
I'm on my final breath and still won't reach

Don't think that you're better off now
Or you have a clean slate
How can you sleep at night
When the earth shakes, just self-medicate

Two thousand miles away
Even I can feel the earth shake
When you say
That everything will be okay
There's nothing left
We're facing death
And you still can't admit
That everything won't be okay

If I die, you're coming with me
They say it's euphoric anyway
Speak my name and feel the earth shake
Feel the earth shake
