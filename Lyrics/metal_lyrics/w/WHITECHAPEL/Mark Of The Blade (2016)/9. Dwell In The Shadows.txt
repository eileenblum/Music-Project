I dwell in the shadows of the past life
And I welcome you to try
To pull my thoughts to the outside
Introverted, am I supposed to be a man
That doesn't hold it back
I don't need the spotlight
All I need is to be the man I know I am

I dwell in the shadows of a past life
And I never thought my words
Would change the lives of the mentally disturbed
It's insane to me, I help lyrically
It seems, you're more fucked up than me
But that's who we are
Mass produced psychos with a million scars
That's who we will be
And you're the ones that made me

Don't ever change
We are who we are and it should remain the same
If you don't want to dwell in the light
Then dwell in the shadows with me

I am a ghost
They never see the side I hate the most
Blackened by the outside
I'm fighting a rising tide
I'm not afraid, this is the part of my life
That has made me who I am
And what I am is a tortured soul helping them
To see the light
I am a voice for the people
To relate to my hate
But I'll always dwell in the shadows
Until you call for me

They will call us evil, forever they'll shun
But just call my name
And I'll take their tongues
This blade cuts deeper than flesh
It cuts down to the soul
As we dwell in the shadows
I am your voice for them to hear
I am your thoughts, I am your fears
We are one and we are all
As we dwell in the shadows

I never thought I could hold on
Or help anyone to get out of the darkness
And stop them from a suicide
I know when you're lost it's hard to find
Any peace for your mind
Let me be your voice
And hold the balance of mankind
May be all find our way
And stop us from self-destructing
If that day still comes
I'll die the man I always was
