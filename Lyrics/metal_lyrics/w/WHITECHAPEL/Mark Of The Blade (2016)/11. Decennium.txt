Brothers rejoice
I propose a toast for this decennium
Followers celebrate for this is our time
No turning back now
I share the tears of thousands like me
Don't be afraid, for my hand can be reached
My friend, I know it's hard to stay on your feet
But you're a part of a brotherhood
That never admits defeat

We've lost a lot of things along the way
And I know that it's hard to stay
Just hold on, it won't be long
Until this pain is gone
If you bleed just know I bleed too
I'll never be hiding you from the truth
Just hold on, for we are strong
This is where we belong

There's a way out
Don't hold onto doubt or hopelessness
I've been down that road before
Time won't come back for you
Look straight ahead
There's so much more, this isn't the end
I share the fears of thousands like me
Don't be ashamed for I'm here to teach you
My friend, I know it's hard to stay on your feet
But you're a part of a brotherhood
That never admits defeat

Don't quit on me now
This has to be what we were created for
To walk side by side as one

You're safe now my friend
No one can hear you but me
Tell me anything you need
We're the brotherhood of the blade

Come together
We've spent our whole lives separated
And now it's time
To be as one and pave the way
We're the brotherhood of the blade
