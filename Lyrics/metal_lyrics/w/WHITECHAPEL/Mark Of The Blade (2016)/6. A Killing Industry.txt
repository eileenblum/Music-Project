It's been a decade
What the fuck makes you think
That my mind is the same
'Cause it's time for a change
This is evolution not a solution
To seek out fortune or fame

I would rather kill myself
Than to live my life for someone else
I would rather burn in hell
Than to give my soul to sell

I would rather kill myself
Than to live my life for someone else
I would rather burn in hell
Than to give my soul to sell

The pressure builds
I'm only hanging by a thread
It's like I've got a gun to my head

This industry is killing me
How many people do I have to please
I'll just stay in this rut
'Cause it's easier to just not give a fuck
This industry is killing me
I don't have anymore blood left to bleed
It doesn't matter how deep you cut
'Cause it's easier to just not give a fuck
I just don't give a fuck

I would rather kill myself
Than to live my life for someone else
I would rather burn in hell
Than to give my soul to sell

The pressure builds
I'm only hanging by a thread
It's like I've got a gun to my head

I'm just trying to help you realize
That no matter what everything will die
I've worked my whole life, this wasn't luck
Talk all you want because I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck

I don't owe a thing to you or anyone
Trust me when I say
That I couldn't care less if you were dead

I don't owe a thing to you or anyone
Trust me when I say
That I couldn't care less if you were dead

This industry is killing me
How many people do I have to please
I'll just stay in this rut
'Cause it's easier to just not give a fuck
This industry is killing me
I don't have anymore blood left to bleed
It doesn't matter how deep you cut
'Cause it's easier to just not give a fuck
This industry will never be
A place of peace and clarity
I'll just stay in this rut
'Cause it's easier to just not give a fuck
I just don't give a fuck
I just don't give a fuck
