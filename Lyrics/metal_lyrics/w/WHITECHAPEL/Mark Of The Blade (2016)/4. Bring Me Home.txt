And slowly I've been
Recognizing everything
Through an adolescent mind
It's so dark, here
It's so dark, here

And for the first time
I feel alive
But you're not here

Life, it changes
Wake me up
And bring me home
Bring me home
Let me stay here, forever

I can't see a thing
I'm lying in my bed
I can't stop thinking
It's driving me insane
Never got to say goodbye
It's still dark, here
It's still dark, here

And for the first time
I feel alive
But you're not here

Life, it changes
Wake me up
And bring me home
Bring me home
Let me stay here, forever

I'll live on
And carry your name
And be what you always
Thought I could be
I hope we
Meet at the end
But I'll never forgive the world
For taking my best friend

[Solo]

I can't see a thing
(I can't see a thing)
I can't see a thing
(I can't feel a thing)
[4x]
