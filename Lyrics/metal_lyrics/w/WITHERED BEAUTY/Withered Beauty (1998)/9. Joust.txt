[BjÃ¶rklund]

Fighting for your life
I want to see you die
For your defeat I strife
You can not from me hide
My strenght is fading
I can not give up now
Fatal strike I'm needing
In my blood I drown
Drifting, floating, flying away
By a wind I'm spread astray
Now will I leave and wait
I died from your hate
Drifting, floating, flying away
By a wind I'm spread astray
