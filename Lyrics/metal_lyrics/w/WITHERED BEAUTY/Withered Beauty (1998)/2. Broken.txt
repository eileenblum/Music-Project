[Bryntse]

Anguish, pain, wrath
Misery, disease, hate
Suddenly, I was not myself
A creature not me
Suddenly, my sanity was gone
Not knowing myself
In the mist I'm eternally lost in my dreams
Ruled by another conscious of my own
No one hears the echoes of my eternal screams
Alone, but not, inside myself I moan
I am blind to feelings
Yet, feelings tear me apart
Inside myself I die
But no one can tell me why
Suddenly, I was not myself
A creature not me
Suddenly, my sanity was gone
Not knowing myself
Memories of another life that won't die
Inflicting me with a wish of death
I can not raise my hand in anger
My subconscious leading my way
