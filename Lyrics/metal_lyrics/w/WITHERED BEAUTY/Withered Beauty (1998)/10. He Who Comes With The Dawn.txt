[BjÃ¶rklund]

Fleeing away from the dawn into the night
Don't want to be the reborn, away from all night
Prophecies will be fulfilled or will he be stilled?
He who comes with the dawn to save us all?
Fleeing away from the dawn into the west
Away from the dragon reborn (from) those who know best
Prophecies will be fulfilled or will he be stilled?
He who comes with the dawn destroy us all?
Lay down and rest
And sleep forevermore
The dragons nest
Into the nevermore
Prophecies will be fulfilled or will he be stilled?
He who comes with the dawn to save us all?
Feeling his power with wrath, feel as it grows
Leading Aiel to their death, as they all know
Prophecies will be fulfilled or will he be stilled?
He who comes with the dawn destroy us all?
Lay down and rest
And sleep forevermore
The dragons nest
Into the nevermore
