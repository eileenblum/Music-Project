[M. BjÃ¶rk, A. BjÃ¶rk, Bryntse]

A piece of my mind wander away
A sudden movement by a cloud
Darkened the sky above
Only a light shines through me
And takes me far beyond my failure
I vanish in my endless hall
Dimensions pass me as I fall
A cry for help is growing strong
And leads to nothings greatest lounge
Futile my life
Futile my death
I am myself
I am my failure
Deep down below echoes the tide
And drowns the feelings kept inside
The power haunts me like a ghost
Leads me to places I fear most
Inward withering in my soul
I can not control it anymore
