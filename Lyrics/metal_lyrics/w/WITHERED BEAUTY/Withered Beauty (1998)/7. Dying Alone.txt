[Bryntse]

I fall
The golden walls surround me no more
Though I laugh
I know this ain't no fun at all
Into the maze of pain
My soul is cast, to be raped
Screams
Torment my ears, my fate is here
The dawn no more place
The place of disgrace
Eternal dusk, my eyes are none
Through darkness I stare
My dreams are here...not
Ridden by dark lord
The mare haunts my mind
Dimension of despair
The edge of death
My hands grips - none
The fight is ended
As I'm dying alone
