We are passion and desire
Falling angels in the fire

We are darkness for the light
Demon spirits in the night

By the light of the skies
We claim what is ours
We're calling for you

We've got the power
On our side
We're rulers
Of the night

We've got the magic
On our side
We're rulers
Of the night

Spreading fear from town to town
They can never track us down

Never to see the light of the day
A soul is a mortal price to pay

By the light of the skies
We'll claim what you've got
We're coming for you

We've got the power
On our side
We're rulers
Of the night
We've got the magic
On our side
We're rulers
Of the night

We've got the power
On our side
We're rulers
Of the night
We've got the magic
On our side
We're rulers
Of the night
[X2]

Dance with the devil
In the fire
We're rulers
Of the night
