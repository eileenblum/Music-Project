INJUSTICE LIES BEHIND EVERY CORNER
UNQUESTIONING FOOLS CHOOSE TO BOW THEIR HEADS
LIVING WITH MINDCUFFS
SUBMISSIVE AND BLIND
NO DISTRUST IN POWER
KICKIN DOWN AND KISSIN UP

THE ARM OF THE LAW - ALWAYS ON MY BACK
ALWAYS GOT THEIR WATCHFUL EYES FOLLOWING MY TRACKS
THIS GAP BETWEEN US, THE BRIDGES HAVE BEEN BURNT
KEEP CRACKING THE WHIP, GET MY SCORN IN RETURN

NO JUSTICE NO PEACE
NO MORE SERVANTS OF A SYSTEM
BASED ON INEQUALITY
TIME TO FIGHT BACK
UNITED - BLACK &amp; RED

DEFIANCE IS THE KEY
TO A WORLD MORE JUST,
BASED ON SOLIDARITY
TIME TO STRIKE BACK
UNITED - BLACK &amp; RED

PROTECTING THE SYSTEM,
DEFENDING THE POWERFUL
A BADGE AND A GUN - NO MORE THAN VIOLENT THUGS
COMRADES ROT IN THE PRISONS,
LEFTIST CIRCLES UNDER SIEGE
EACH ONE COMPLICIT
UNCHECKED VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS

WEâLL MAKE NO PEACE
NO RETREAT

NEITHER SLAVES NOR MASTERS
DONâT EXPECT NO RETREAT
NOT A SINGLE STEP

YOU FAN THE FLAMES OF OUR DISCONTENT
OUR BURNING LOVE FOR FREEDOM
IS TURNING INTO FIERCE CONTEMPT

NO JUSTICE NO PEACE
NO MORE SERVANTS OF A SYSTEM,
BASED ON INEQUALITY
TIME TO FIGHT BACK
UNITED - BLACK &amp; RED

DEFIANCE IS THE KEY
TO A WORLD MORE JUST,
BASED ON SOLIDARITY
TIME TO STRIKE BACK
UNITED - BLACK &amp; RED

WHEN WILL WE SEE &amp; LEARN THAT THE POWER IS IN OUR HANDS
