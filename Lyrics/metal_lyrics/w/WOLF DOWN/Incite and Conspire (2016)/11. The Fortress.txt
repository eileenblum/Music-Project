BLOODDRIPS IN THE SAND OF A PLACE WE CALLED HOME
THE HORRORS OF WAR TURNED OUR HEARTS TO STONE
LEFT EVERYTHING WE EVER HELD DEAR
ON A MERCILESS PATH TOWARDS UNKOWN FRONTIERS

THE DAESH HORDES LEFT NOTHING BUT DESTRUCTION
COLD-BLOODED CUTTHROATS BEAR NO EMPATHY
FOR ENDLESS MILES WE DRAGGED OUR WEARY BODIES
JUST TO FIND A PLACE FILLED WITH PEOPLE FULL OF HATE

FORTRESS CHOKING ON ABUNDANCE
SHUTTING OUT THE MISERY
THE DEAD PILING UP AT THE WALLS
A REMINDER OF INHUMANITY

THE BORDER GUARDS WELCOMED US AT GUNPOINT
COLD-BLOODED GATEKEEPERS BEAR NO EMPATHY
THROUGH TROUBLED SEAS WE SAILED OUR CROWDED SHIP
SOLD OUR LIVES FOR A NEW BEGINNING
OUR HOPE, OUR WILL, OUR ENDURANCE THEY CANâT BREAK
THEY WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND ITâS OUR LIVES THAT ARE AT STAKE

FORTRESS CHOKING ON ABUNDANCE
SHUTTING OUT THE MISERY
THE DEAD PILING UP AT THE WALLS
A REMINDER OF INHUMANITY

BURN ALL PAPERS â BURN ALL FLAGS
TEAR DOWN ALL THE BORDERS
FOR THIS WORLD TO SEE BETTER TIMES

THE WALLS ARE IN OUR MINDS

WE ARE THE SEEDS OF A NEW WORLD TO COME
