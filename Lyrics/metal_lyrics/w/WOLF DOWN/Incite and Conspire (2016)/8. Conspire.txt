BANNERS RAISED AS BLACK AS THE NIGHT
NO LONGER BENT DOWN, WE CAME TO DAGGERS WITH LIFE
DEFIANCE OF THE UNTAMED FEW
WITH PASSION AND COURAGE AND DREAMS TO PURSUE

WEâRE LYING IN THE GUTTER
BUT SOME OF US ARE FACING THE STARS
STILL WE CARRY THE NEW WORLD
HERE IN OUR HEARTS

AT DAGGERS DRAWN WITH ALL GODS
AT DAGGERS DRAWN WITH ALL TYRANTS

WAR
ON AUTHORITY

REBORN
THROUGH INSURGENCY

OPPRESSOR, OUR PACK HAS TRACED YOUR SCENT
RETRIBUTION FOR YOUR DEEDS OUR ONLY INTENT
FORGED BONDS OF RESISTANCE ACROSS THE EARTH
YOU CANâT CRUSH THE MOVEMENTâS ONCOMING REBIRTH

WEâRE LYING IN THE GUTTER
BUT SOME OF US ARE FACING THE STARS
STILL WE CARRY THE NEW WORLD
HERE IN OUR BURNING HEARTS

WAR
ON AUTHORITY

REBORN
THROUGH INSURGENCY

THIS IS THE SOUND OF RAGING HEARTS BEATING AS ONE
OUR BURNING MATCHES WILL INCITE A FIRESTORM
THIS IS THE ANTHEM OF THOSE BORN WITH RAISED FISTS

WE ARE THE CONSPIRACY OF ARSONISTS
