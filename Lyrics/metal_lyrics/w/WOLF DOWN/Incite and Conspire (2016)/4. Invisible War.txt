GHOSTS OF PROGRESS
DRESSED IN SLOW DEATH
ARE RUNNING RAMPANT
IN SEARCH OF ENDLESS PROFIT

DRAW THE FRONTLINE
BUST THE CAGE FROM THE INSIDE
DRAW THE FRONTLINE
WHERE WILL YOU STAND WHEN THE WORLDS COLLIDE

TRAPPED IN THIS VORTEX
OF PROFIT OVER HUMAN LIVES
STRONGHOLD ON THE BACKS OF THOSE SCRAPING BY

NO PEACE OF MIND
IN THIS INVISIBLE WAR DISTRESSING MANKIND

SUBVERSIVE THOUGHT SWALLOWED BY MASS APATHY
THE WORKING CLASS FORCED TO A LIFE IN MISERY
BLOODLESS - BOWING DOWN TO THOSE ABOVE
LIFELESS - REVOLTING VOICES CHOKED OFF

DRAW THE FRONTLINE
BUST THE CAGE FROM THE INSIDE
DRAW THE FRONTLINE
WHERE WILL YOU STAND WHEN THE WORLDS COLIDE

PEOPLE LIVING IN THE STREETS
WHILE COUNTLESS BUILDINGS STAY VACANT
SO MANY STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET
WHILE OTHERS CHOKE ON TOO FUCKING MUCH
ALIENATION - DISPLACEMENT - SOCIAL DECLINE
WHEN THE FUCK WILL YOU REALIZE THAT THE CRISIS IS CAPITALISM ITSELF
STOP THE MACHINE DEAD IN ITS TRACKS

CAN'T YOU SEE THAT THIS SYSTEM BREEDS WAR?
