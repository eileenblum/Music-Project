welcome to hell
where the life stands still
because the pain you feel
overcomes your fear
and everything around you
crashes down to dust
and your anguish
becomes so fucking real

you can't run away
there is no place to hide
never turn your head
or you are falling down

hiding behind faces
in hope of not beeing found
but every false step
makes me fall apart
i'm hearing voices
but no one is around
my head's exploding
i want to get out

you can't run away
there is no place to hide
never turn your head
or you are falling down
this is the world
that i'm living in
it's fucking sink or swim
over and over again
