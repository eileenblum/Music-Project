i'm waking up again
another sleepless night
just can't stand the pain
others rate as slight
the pictures played-back
will stay for ever on my mind
we're ruining our lives
but who's to blame?

these crimes are organized
feels like my hands are tied
i can't take it any longer
rise up to end this ecocide!

mother earth is dying
choking in own haze
resources are being wrung
forests going out in blaze
all waters are spoiled
another land laid waste
we cause our world to rot
with fallouts being faced

we're ruining our lives
but who's to blame?
we cause our world to rot
with fallouts being faced
