on a stake
they burn us like witches

pushed with the back against the wall
with a gun barrel to your chest
fire - fed with bodies
of those who came to take you out

on a stake
they burn us like witches
whipped with flames
branded before death
flesh and fire â
for you it's the same

hiding behind brutal rooks
bringing others in disgrace
you're just a coward
without a face

what's there is ours to take
we have nothing to lose
this time you're accused
watch everything going up in flames
your kingdom's going down
solidary we'll live on our own
we donât beg the king
cuz we wanna topple him
