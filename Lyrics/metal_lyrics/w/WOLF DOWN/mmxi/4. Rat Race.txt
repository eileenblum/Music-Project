i step back in my tracks
everyone else is moving fast
i stopped to watch the worlds collide
like I am the only one to realize

you failed!
24/7 hurry-scurry
how can you think this stress is life?
just sit back and watch the worlds collide

I'm stuck in this daily routine
going round in circles once again
what happened to the spirit I used to have?
seems like there is no way for getting on

I'm tired, so please let me rest!
I'm wasting my life - I miss the progress.
How come you call this entire shit life?
we're living for wagework like in a hive
How come you call this entire shit life?
we're living for wagework - like in a hive

I WANT TO BREAK FREE!
9 to 5 is not a deal for me
many toil for a few's greed
9 to 5 is modern slavery

I claim life deluxe for all!
