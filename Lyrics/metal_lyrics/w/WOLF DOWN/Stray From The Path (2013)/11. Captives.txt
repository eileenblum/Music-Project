every time you take a look to the sky
you'd rather be dead
than a slave made for mine
wings are made to fly but yours are confined
by a prison created by myn
to keep broken spirits alive

no one is free
until all a re free
no one is free
no one is free
until all are free

scarred for life
your wings are broken but your will is strong
we can break bones but a free mind
wants to go where it belongs

no one is free
until all a re free
no one is free
no one is free
until all are free

to bow down to those whoâve crowned themselves
all powerful (yet never reigning)
leaves us laying upon their holy ground
strained and dying
where no one is free
