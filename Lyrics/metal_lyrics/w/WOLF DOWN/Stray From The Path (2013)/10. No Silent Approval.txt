while the blood drips off the blade the cries still resonate
estranged, cut into pieces - rediscovered on your plate
you stop at nothing for the privilege of taste
like a panel of judges you're deciding their fate

born in misery, abused - got nothing to lose
exploited for profit therefore you breed by human greed
this machine that turns lives to products is called tradition
your silent approval - what an imposition!
individuals - facing perversion by superior forces
social, sentient beings degraded to resources
you stop at nothing for the privilege of taste
like a panel of judges you're deciding their fate

this is about freedom, this is about compassion,
abolish exploitation â animal liberation!
The time has come - to break this culture of death
