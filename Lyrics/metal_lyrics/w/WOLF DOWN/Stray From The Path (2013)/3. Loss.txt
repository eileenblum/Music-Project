hello death, seems like we meet again
once again you took away my dearest friend
I'm feeling alone, trying to cope with his death
the mere thought of him still makes me hold my breath

you jacked me and caused me guilt
destroyed everything we built
took away what meant the world to me
and all I have are fucking memories

people say "time will heal"
but days turn to weeks
and months turn to years
this pain runs deep
i can't fucking forget
this wound will bleed always and evermore

it's fall and leaves are falling from the trees
your life passes right in front of me
my eyes are burning
but i don't like to dry my tears
you've walked away
and all I have are memories
