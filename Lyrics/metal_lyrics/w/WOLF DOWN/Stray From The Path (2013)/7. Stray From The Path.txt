go with the flow - that's what we're taught
and like blind sheep we believe what we're told
heading towards one direction
a misguided youth without connection
I choose a way off the beaten track
a herder has never been a sheep's best friend

blind leading the blind - obeying by tradition
veer away, all you need is volition

I'm not the only one -
there is more of my kind
I am a renegade
fighting to survive
I'm not the only one -
there is more of my kind
stray from the path
leave the mass behind

we're lost - we miss the forest for the trees
that's why we're pleased with living life on our knees
there's no right way in this labyrinth
stray from the path

stray from the path -- escape prescribed conformity
stray from the path - break the uniformity
stray from the path - get out of control
stray from the path - we're here, you're not alone!

stray from the path
