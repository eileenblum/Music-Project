countless generations were forced to bend down
but what goes around comes back around
I'm wearing a crown, but I'm not a queen
I'm a slave of this world I was born in
I'm desperately trying to get rid off this crown
its thorns are made to put me under ground
trapped in this corset to which you think that I'm bound
you can't imagine how deep is this wound

I've been held long enough in this golden cage
powerful, rude - I will disengage

I'm wearing a crown, but I'm not a queen
I'm a slave of this world I was born in
harassed, abused - just a birth machine
a slave of this world I was born in

I'm bearing this weight for thousands of years
my sisters and me have shed oceans of tears
so who the fuck do you expect me to be?
I'm not your love, not your bitch, not your dear

I've been held long enough in this golden cage
powerful, rude - I will disengage
