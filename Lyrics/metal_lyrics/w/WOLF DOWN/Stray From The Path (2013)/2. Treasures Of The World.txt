love - the strongest element in life
harbinger of hope, moulder of destiny
burning passion cures the worst despair
opens minds and fills lungs with air

we can have all treasures of the world
but we're poor and desolate - if love passes us by

true love is irresponsible, rebellious
an act of revolution in a futile world
without the burning fire of desire
we can't decide what's right or wrong

we can have all treasures of the world
but we're poor and desolate - if love passes us by

take care of each other, so you can be dangerous together
