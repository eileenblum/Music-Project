so proud of your country - so proud of your race
we have nothing in common and we'll never relate
your head's full of prejudice and national pride
no tolerance for you and your narrow mind
the ignorance you follow is a disease
got a penchant for scapegoating minorities
you're a blind spot in the state's watchful eyes
fight the fascist threat - we're your demise

people facing daily threats
and living in anxiety
this is not a side issue -
racism's rooted in society

I'm not scared
I'll stand up - won't keep my mouth shut

boundaries are a product
of your imagination
a common tool for exclusion
and separation

I'm not scared
I'll stand up - won't keep my mouth shut

you played your game - now tables turned
don't play with fire if you don't wanna get burned
don't follow blindly - spot the wolf in sheep's clothing
their web of lies is decomposing

capitalist crisis, discontent rises
a breeding ground for racist ratters
they're crawling out of the woodwork
decoying with simple answers to difficult questions

I'm not scared
I'll stand up - won't keep my mouth shut

Fight the fascist threat!
Pack off! Get lost!
