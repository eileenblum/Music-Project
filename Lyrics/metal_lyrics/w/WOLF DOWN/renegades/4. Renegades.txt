a smell of corruption is clouding my mind
doctrines of hate and chevy overwhelm
the master plan to make deaf people blind
is a perfect weapon to uphold your realm

you sow fear, to reap hostility
poisoned wits of those under your thumb
your fellowship is soaked with bigotry
we don't feel our chains of being numb

this bloody fight held on a billions' backs
brains and bodies fed to the machine
society feels like torture racks
escaping this became a fucking routine

move out of harm's way
I walk with fire
I stand defiant
move out of harm's way
I am the Renegade
i won't stand by your flag
