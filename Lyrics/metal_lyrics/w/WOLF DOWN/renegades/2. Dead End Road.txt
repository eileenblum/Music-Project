forced to walk some stamped out paths
with no escape passageways
everyone knows where this road leads
this road leads to my very end
my hands are clenched to a fist
in this world ignorance is bliss
so I pretend to be strong
to survive in a world I don't belong

money talks but I'm not listening
I fucking bite the hand that feeds
