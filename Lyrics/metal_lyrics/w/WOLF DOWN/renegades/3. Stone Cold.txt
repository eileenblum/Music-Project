how many times did I ask myself for the sense of life
too often I was hurt and came to realize
that people step into my life to twist the knife
it's dog eat dog - souls of stone, hearts of ice
I'm fed up with seeing faceless faces day by day
wearing faked smiles with no shine in the eyes

I'm growing cold

how many times did I ask myself for the sense of life
too often I was hurt and came to realize
that people step into my life to twist the knife
it's dog eat dog - souls of stone, hearts of ice
I'm fed up with seeing faceless faces day by day
wearing faked smiles with no shine in the eyes

the creeping death is haunting me
darkness is all I see

I'm fed up with seeing faceless faces day by day
wearing faked smiles with no shine in the eyes
