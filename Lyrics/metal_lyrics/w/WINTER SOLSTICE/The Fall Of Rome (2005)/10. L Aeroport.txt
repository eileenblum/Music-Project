poetry written in a tongue that only you and i can read
we forget the world with one prolonged embrace

marching to the beat of a near end song
your crystal facade cracks quietly

with the legend of the mantis still fresh in my mind
i continue trying to give you the key
but your foot's already in the door

one hand on the phone
the other on a blank picture frame
left alone to remember all the wonderful memories we never had together
there were no memories for us to have

move your hair from your face and look me in the eyes

with the legend of the mantis still fresh in my mind
i continue trying to give you the key
but your foot's already in the door

forced to forget tomorrow
each breath becomes more precious than the last
drastic weather changes make me tired
hopefully the worst has passed me now

flawlessly gorgeous you looked in that dress
your intentions were more fair than your skin

it hurts to smile when your indecisive ways
freeze my emotionless expressions

marching to the beat of a near end song
your crystal facade cracks quietly

with the legend of the mantis still fresh in my mind
i continue trying to give you the key
but your foot's already in the door

flawlessly gorgeous you looked in that dress
your intentions were more fair than your skin

over and over again, i seem to lose my mind
like a leaf in the wind of the most atrocious of hurricanes
carelessly and directionless it floats away
goodbye
