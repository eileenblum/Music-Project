Frantically running through the catacombs of peril
So far from hollow
A nightmare interpreted into something so beautiful
Flooding your senses like tsunami of light
Inferiority races through your veins
Monumental photographic memory
Converted into self-inflicted amnesia
The flowers grow in a perfect circle
Displaying harmony and content
As you pick each one
A part of you dies
Like each perfect blossom 
Inferiority races through your veins
Never to surface without warning again
