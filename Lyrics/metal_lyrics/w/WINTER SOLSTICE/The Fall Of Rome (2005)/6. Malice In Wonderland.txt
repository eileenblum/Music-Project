this dream i'm living will never end
when i attempted to place your abominations into words
you fled with disgust

lions weep at the sight of their own weakness
the day's darkness overwhelms our spirits
i'm still fortunate enough to know someone like you

the waves remain placid and invisible
receding the shore with ironically horrific malice
caught in a war against the blues

lions weep at the sight of their own weakness
the day's darkness overwhelms our spirits
i'm still fortunate enough to know someone like you

we walk every where with sheets over our heads
praying they won't recognize us

you're a paper wall
and i'm your wrecking ball

the silence spreads like fire across our field of dreams

lions weep at the sight of their own weakness
the day's darkness overwhelms our spirits
i'm still fortunate enough to know someone like you

you're a paper wall
and i'm your wrecking ball
