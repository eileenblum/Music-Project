Once there lived a man in a small house of wood
Just before the threshold tall birch-tree stood
Knocking at his window and pulling his hair
All of that he did not care

Days passed the nights and the nights passed the days
Human's path was his only way
Once under the full moon he fell asleep
A girl came to him and began to weep

[Birch:] Please, please, darling come to me
[Man:] How can I not knowing thee?
[Birch:] Please, please, darling come to me
[Man:] How can I not knowing thee?

[Birch:] Always I've been here don't be surprised
You'll see me always just close your eyes
Knocking at your window and pulling your hair
[Man:] I'm sick and tied of you so beware

[Birch:] Please, please, darling come to me
[Man:] Oh, well, I'll come and cut thee
[Birch:] Please, please, darling come to me
[Man:] Oh, well, I'll come and cut thee

[Birch:]
Be my blacksmith to forge the new swords
Be my staff for wild waters to cross
Be my hop to bitter my drink
Be my key to break wooden link
I'm your smithy to forge the new sword
I'm your way to the stallions of Njord
I'm your mare to ride through the night
I'm your birch tree with tears so bright

Then he took an axe and exited the house
Came to tall white tree and closed his eyes
The girl came to him one and final time
But he preferred to close his mind

[Man:] Oh, well, I have come to thee
Please, please, don't worry me
Oh, well, I have come to thee
Please, please, don't worry me

His hands were above and her waist below
Thus he embraced her in moment slow
The cold iron passed into her heart
When his eyes had opened they were apart

So he turned to mirror again and again
Blood on his axe, blood on his hands
Grinning and laughing he came to the wood
Hanged himself - now he's ravens' food

[Man:] Now you will never come to me
[Birch:] Oh, well, good night to thee
[Man:] Now you will never come to me
[Birch:] Oh, well, good night to thee

No one now lives in a small house of wood
Nothing there is, so the tale ends good
