In a rusty ruined tavern
Face to face they sat all night
One was good, another evil,
They had dice and ale to fight

Good was dressed in long white cloak,
Red coat wore another man
Wolves a-howled and ravens croaked
Three eyes watched at dice as one

In a rusty ruined tavern
Face to face they sat all night
One was good, another evil,
They had dice and ale to fight

Many bets were made by players
Many crowns were spent that night
One was good, another evil,
Thus they had a lot to fight

Final round - they're to throw
Once and winner takes the bank
Only one appeared for old man
But another's dice was blank

Evil looked with growing hatred,
Heat was both in air and mind
So he turned into the fire
Good had vision of a kind

One was thrown for eye and water
One - the water rears the vine
One - the rival is immortal
One - we have one face and sign

Nothing thrown for tree of wisdom
Nothing - arrow mistletoe
Nothing - is the evil guilty?
Nothing - is he friend or foe?

Fire vanished, empty chair
Was aside of good old man
Void in jug and void in memory
Were there three of eyes or one?

So the good rose up his brimmer,
Drained it dry and fell asleep
Ravens croak and wolves a-howling
Were enough for dreams to keep

Weaver smiled and turned the spindle
And a day replaced the night
One was good, another evil,
But there's nothing more to fight
