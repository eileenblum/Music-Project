Fairy lady all of darkness
Can you hear my silent scream?
Can you see my bones are broken?
Can you feel me? Disbelieve!

Heart is only word means something
Honour means no more I see
All the words are out of meaning
Water will be bed for me

Hail the Lords of sky and higher
Bloody water now shall rise
Only blade will kill that fire
Only pain will be my prize
