"Evigt liv tecken av kraft"

Bridges of ice the women going
Women go because I called them
Frozen statues in the lines
Make my borders gleam and shine

Welcome lady be my queen
Frost will penetrate your skin
'ternal beauty'll be my gift
Since you'd come across my rift

I'm the king of northern trolls
Decorating icy halls
Welcome guest here is your home
Does not matter where you're from

Fields of snow the children going
Children go because I called them
Frozen statues little toys
Make my garden full of joy

Welcome baby close your eyes
All your nightmares - only lies
'ternal game will be my gift
Since you'd come across my rift

I'm the king of northern trolls
Decorating icy halls
Welcome guest here is your home
Does not matter where you're from

Walls of hail the warriors going
Warriors go because I called them
Frozen statues faces long
Make my fortress good and strong

Welcome sir you're tied of war
What you've fought for's nothing more
'ternal strength will be my gift
Since you'd come across my rift

I'm the king of northern trolls
Decorating icy halls
Welcome guest here is your home
Does not matter where you're from
