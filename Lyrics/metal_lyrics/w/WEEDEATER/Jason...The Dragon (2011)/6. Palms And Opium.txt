Palms and opium, my brain has come undone, my
thoughts all turn to one, palms and opium, and
the sand, and the breeze, and the sun, goddamn
what have I done, palms and opium, blisters burn my
tongue, my god it's too much fun, palms and opium, 
and the sand, and the breeze, and the sun,
goddamn what have I done, and the pain it
makes me numb, palms and opium.
