I'm going home, back where I belong, know what I mean,
I'm right behind you, you smell like fuck, beside yourself,
worth half as much, ten pounds of shit, in five pound
bags, abandon ship and burn that fucking flag, burn
the goddamn flag, mud guts like dirt ball, out by my
truck, dirt road style voodoo, like bagged up junk, fat
like a tick, old toothless hag, abandon ship, and burn
that goddamn flag, burn that fucking flag, I stole your
home, it's not where you belong, know what I mean.
