Hold my line until the deed is done
Need for speed and it's so much fun
Stay inside, it's too cold for me
Be the way I want you to be
In my time I've seen fear
End your time it's been a thousand years
Take my time before I make my run
I'm coming out like a loaded gun
Stay inside, I'm cold as I can be
See the things I want you to see
In my time I've seen fear
End your time it's been a thousand years
I need it and it won't be long till I got it
And I'm gone
You want it but it runs through me
I got it and I'm free
It's been a thousand years
