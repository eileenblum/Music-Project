It's way too late
I should probably not
I guess it's OK
Maybe one more shot
You hate me so bad
But it helps me be
I makes me so mad
When it runs through me
Down in blues
All lines downtown
That's what I need
Point me towards MLK
And then watch me bleed
You think it's so sad
But nothing's for free
Your dumb ass outlook is what makes me me
Which way is the wrong way
That's the way I need
This way or that way
Make my nose bleed
You need it so bad
But it won't be free
It's gone so goddamn fast
And you still can't see
