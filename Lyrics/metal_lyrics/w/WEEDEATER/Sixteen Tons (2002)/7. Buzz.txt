All aboard, my only son
One and only chosen one
Nothing ventured nothing done
Nothing gambled nothing won
Per say, it's all okay
All aboard, my only son
One and only chosen one
Head into the setting sun
For half a day then come what may
The righteous one was born to us today
All aboard to save my son
One and only chosen one
Next to nothing, we are done
Then come what may, it's not okay
The evil one was born to us today
The one who was to lead us all astray
The antidote, the one and only way
