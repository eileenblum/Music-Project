Sometimes I think I don't think
I don't know, I can't tell
Maybe I shouldn't breathe
Maybe it's just as well
Shut the fuck up
That's all I see
Sit down sucker punch
Now you feel me
Probably shouldn't reach into the wishing well
Maybe I shouldn't breathe
Maybe it's just as well
Maybe I didn't think things through too well
Into the wishing well
