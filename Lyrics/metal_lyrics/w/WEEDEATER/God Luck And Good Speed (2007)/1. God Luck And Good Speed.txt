I feel you crawl
I know your type
It's all the same to me
And you know I'm right
I'm falling

You see me fall
I see you smile
5,000 razor blades
10,000 miles I'm crawling

Untied we stand
Long live dirt weed
Mankind is unkind man
God luck and good speed

I don't really agree
Much with myself
Ain't got no time
For no one else
I know

I tell myself that I'm not like me
Part of me just won't hear
The other part can't see
I'm gone

Untied we stand
Long live dirt weed
Mankind is unkind man
God luck and good speed
