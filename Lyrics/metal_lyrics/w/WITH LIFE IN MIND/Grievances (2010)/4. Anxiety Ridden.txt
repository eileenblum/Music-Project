It scares me to death to think of what I have become,
and what a wandering soul I have become.
If I followed the beaten path instead of marching my way through my own.
I feel so lost in this world like I made the same mistake one thousand times.
I donât want to be a drone, a slave to the system that's caught so many others in its trap.
I can only hope to look back and see a life fulfilled.
Times of triumph, love and compassion.
But itâs better to have lived, then to have never spent a day alive.
But will these choices finally come back to haunt me in my dreams?
This self loathing can only get me so far.
