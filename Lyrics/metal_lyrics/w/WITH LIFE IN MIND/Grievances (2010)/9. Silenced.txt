Your hands tied.
You are bound and gagged.
Everything you've been told has been a lie.
Weâre so afraid to step outside the lines.
Conformed to restraints of this world.
We've all been asleep since the beginning of time.
Why are we so scared to use our minds?
The only thing we can call our own.
We pretend as if it doesn't even exist.
Muzzles are tied to our mouths.
Voices are never heard for fear of the repercussions.
Imprisoned by our own reality, we dare to go against the grain.
What will it take for us to come alive?
Prepare to rid ourselves from the filth that rots our lives.
Instead of living in the shadows of brothers who have fallen before us.
