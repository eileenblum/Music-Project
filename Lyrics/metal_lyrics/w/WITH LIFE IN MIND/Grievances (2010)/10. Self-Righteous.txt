How do you judge the ones that are carbon copies of yourself?
A perfect mirror image that you look down upon so half-heartedly.
You may not sin like me, but you'll still rot the same.
The flaws in your character show the weakness in your conviction.
Just because your actions don't reflect mine it doesn't make you any better.
I've lived a life based on value, on pride, on the ideals that we are all the same.
You feed on the power; the idea that you're superior.
You raise your head so high to a society you blatantly cast aside.
Judge so blindly to a world you donât understand.
Your ignorance displays shallow existence.
We all sin the same, and one day weâll all rot the same.
