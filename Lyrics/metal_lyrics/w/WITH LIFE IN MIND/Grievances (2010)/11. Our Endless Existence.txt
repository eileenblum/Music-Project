Take a look around at everything we are and everything we've become.
Our innocence is lost.
We were once so weak and invincible.
Oblivious to the world around us.
We are unstoppable.
An army of brothers with nothing to lose.
Our Strength in numbers never failed.
We are unstoppable.
But times change, hopefully for the better and we've become something so much greater.
Our eyes widened.
Our senses sharp to the harsh reality of the place we call home.
What happened to the days where nothing matter?
The years filled with endless hope.
We've moved on, but we can never forget the time we had it all.
These are the days, we had it all.
