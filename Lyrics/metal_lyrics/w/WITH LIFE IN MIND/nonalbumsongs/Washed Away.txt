We washed this place away.
The innocence of man was lost so long ago.
We've come so far with nothing left to show but corruption, greed, and lies.
The guilt we carry is that of all mankind.
As primitive as can be, we are nothing short of animals.
This is survival.
Our demise is knocking on our door.
We should be ashamed of what we've created
Of what we've all become.

How can you love a world that doesn't even love you back?
We sold our souls for a shot at triumph
we drink to calm our troubled minds.
Disgraceful, misguided misanthropy.
We should be ashamed of what we've become.

This can't be what was intended for us all.
Bested by our ambitions to control what's not meant to be contained.
We search to find our meaning in life but ended up in misery.

This is survival of the fittest.

Can you see the pain in someone's eyes?
Could you even endure the suffering of man?
When did everything slip through our fingers?
We are the engineers of our own destruction.

How can you love a world that doesn't even love you back?
We sold our souls for a shot at triumph.
We drink to calm our troubled minds.
Disgraceful, misguided, misanthropy.
We should be ashamed of what we've become.

This can't be what was meant for us all.
Bested by our ambitions to control what's not to be contained.
We search to find our meaning in life but ended up in misery.

The biggest threat to humanity is ourselves.

We've washed this place away.
