We're blindfolded, centered only to survive, concerned only with that which keeps us safe. We think nothing of the world around us, and were so entangled around what tortures us day by day. Our own shallow lives. So void of compassion for the masses that roam this earth with no where to go, and not one shoulder to cry on and no where to run to. We turn our heads from the helpless. This type of behavior is nothing more than discouraging in my eyes. What makes you any better? What makes you any different? A world you hide in? A mask of Fools. A crown of Kings. Who are you to pass all your judgements, Compassion falls short. we're all burdened in the end, burdened in the end by your lack of conviction, burdened in the end by your lack of truth. I pity the ones that hold no sympathy. Narrow-mindedly walk through life, concerned less, with the ills of man. With your head so high, it might seem like centuries before you reach the ground. Your no better than the ones you shun away, survival of the fittest seems to suit you well. But when it comes time to reach for a hand, will you sink or swim, or will you drown?
