How do we save ourselves from this misery we've plagued our lives with? And we've plagued ourselves. So desperate for answers, we search for a reason to survive. We spend our days staring at the sun. Only to blinded, by the mere thought. Encouraged, enraged by what has held us down. We're Straining on the last bits of hope we have left. No one hears our cries, and no one sees us screaming, beating out our lungs. We are the Forgotten. Our minds have starved from this constant fight to find solid ground. To be something more than what's placed in our hands. Struggling to find the means, to build ourselves back up. With every odd stacked against us, we walk as men through a sea of giants.
