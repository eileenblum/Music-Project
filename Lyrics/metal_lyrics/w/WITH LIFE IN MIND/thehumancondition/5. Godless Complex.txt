What if everything we've ever worked for meant absolutely nothing?
And all the struggles, the hard times, the blood, sweat, and tears?
All for what? A simple chance for freedom?
A light at the end of the tunnel.
Living through someone else's life.
This should be for you, not for some false hope of epiphany
For some false reality
Oh, like the blind being led into darkness
The masses crumble at your feet
What for?
A chance that you'll be heard
A chance that you'll be heard

Cowering in silence at the hands of wrath
Was it really all worth it?
When conformity's all you got, I guess the next best thing is salvation.

Your no savior, you're no saint

Since when is being forced a commendable act?
From birth we live these sheltered lives.
Diseases shoved down our throats everyday.

Those pearly gates don't seem so glorious in the eyes of a sinner.

Like the blind being led into darkness
The masses crumble at your feet
Cowering in silence at the hands of wrath
Those pearly gates don't seem so glorious in the eyes of a sinner.
You're no savior, you're no saint.
