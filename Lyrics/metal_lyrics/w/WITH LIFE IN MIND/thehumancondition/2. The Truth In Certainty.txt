We're just living in darkness.
Looking for comfort.
When almost nothing's there.
Why do we live this way?
In search of something that will never exist.
Even when we've tried our hardest and did our very best to forget all the memories,
and the struggles we've had.

Feeling so hollow, we're just living in fear.
Where do we find hope in a world so dead?
Feeling so hollow, we're all living in fear
Where do we find hope in a world so dead?

Desperation's setting in, and we're all clinging to nothing.
All we get it this false sense of completion.
And these insecurites will get the best of us.
Even as this stranglehold only grows tighter.
Were hiding our sorrows behind that front we've built.
In search of nothing more than the trail of a ghost.

And will any of this even bring you happiness?
And these insecurities will get the best of us.
Even as this stranglehold only grows.

We're so afraid of what we might become.
So scared to let go, be content with what you are.
And it only gets harder as the days roll on and the pain and regret only builds stronger.

Looking for comfort.
When almost nothing's there.
Why do we live this way?
In search of something that will never exist.
Even when we've tried our hardest and did our very best to forget all the memories.

How do we rise when it feels like the weight of the world is standing on top of your shoulders?
When it seems like this world is so hopeless.
We find another reason to fall apart.
