Michael had been shot many of times,
but Loomis realised it wasn't easy for
him to die! So the shape escaped without
a trace, and body after body he left a
horrible disgrace.

Dr. Loomis figured out with total con-
centration, that Samhain, demonic ritual
of pain, was Michael's celebration.
And his only mode was to search and
kill his sister, Laurie Strode.

[Chorus:]
Halloween II-The Shape strikes
again. The night isn't over, until he meets
the end. He'll search throughout every neigh-
borhood, slashing his way, until he kills
his sister in cold blood.

[Solos: J.D., M.S.]

[Chorus]
