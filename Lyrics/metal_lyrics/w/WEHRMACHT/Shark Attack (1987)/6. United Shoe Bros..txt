When it comes to the weekend,
my friends and I get drunk. You may
think it's strange but the boot is
cool to us. We buy a case of Lucky
Lager for 7,47$, so we fill the boot
up to the rim, which puts us all in
heaven!

[Chorus:]
United Shoe Brothers!
United Shoe Brothers!

Pass the boot around the room,
and chug the sacred brew. And if you
turn it down, lightweight, we will
laught at you!

Make donations of your beerm
initiate the next in line. And if
they're afraid of "Athlete's Mouth",
they're just a wimpy swine.

[Chorus: Repeat.]
