Try to get a job, that's what they say
but all the jobs are gone, and we have to pay
They come in the huge boats, too many to count
Our country's pilling up, it's starting to mount

[Chorus:]
Please - I want to work
Get out - you miserable jerk
Go home - to your flea-bitten life
Or I - will use my knife!!!

Id like to get a gun, put a hole in their head
Crush 'em to the ground, pound until they're dead,
You can't understand them, "What did you say?"
Get out of my space, I'll do it my way

[Chorus:]
[Solos: J.D., M.S.]

They're everywhere you go, you cannot get free
All they want is money, from you and me
Why are they here? We'll never know
Kick them all out and then we can grow

GO HOME!
GO HOME!!
GO HOME!!!
GO HOME!!!!!
