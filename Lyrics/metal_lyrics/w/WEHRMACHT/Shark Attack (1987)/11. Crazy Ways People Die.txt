Walking through the woods, a bear
it munches you. Put your head in a 
vice, go drilling for the goo.
Fall one hundred thousand fest,
go splat in the middle of town.
Your head lops off from a chain-
saw and falls down to the ground.

[Chorus:]
From behind, a blade slides in, and
opens up your veins. Under your car, the pump
gives way and squashes all your brains.
A great white shark rips you limb from limb,
a jigsaw cuts the flesh, it tears around the rim.

"An execution", hear the cry, shock! It pops
your eyes. A rope wrapped firmly a-
round your neck, it ends all your lives.
Now they stuff M-80's down your fucking
throat, when they go, you will blow, and
then start to bloat.

[Chorus: Solo's: M.Z., J.D., repeat]

Pour some gas on your head, then light
a match. Stuff your friend in the oven,
then lock the latch. Creme your face on
the ground, falling off your bike. Fall
from a cliff Bub, while taking a nature
hike.
