One flick of the switch, and we're all dead.
One nation destroyed, it moves on ahead. Bombs
destroy everything here, no time to live, or
cry a tear.

Beg for your life, down on your knees. War-
mongers hate! Kill as they please. Fallout is
arising, people vaporising. The blast is so
bright, it takes out your sight. Cars over-
turned, houses are burned. Nature is lost, to
total chaos. Deathly air, everywhere, decaying
flesh, here and there.

[Chorus:]
Napalm spreads on, our city is gone.
Evert the task, what more could you ask?
It's just too late, we agree with fate
Our governments fucked, and we were all shucked!

[Chorus: Solos: J.D., M.Z.]
