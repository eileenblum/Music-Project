You've seen the rest now hear the best
We've come here to say total thrash we play
Crush all the fags they have no say,
uncontrolled power we can blow them away

[Chorus]
Bursting your ears spurting mass blood,
poser control will steal your soul, we' ve
come to bash to pound and smash, we're here
to stay; coe to blow you away

Thrashing your heads
Sloshing your brains
Intense painful whiplash
We will take the blame,
each song results in total mayhem
we'll never slow down, the heaviest around

[Repeat Chorus]

Enter the pit then skank or die,
Dive off the stage yes you can fly
Stomp on your face the mersh I dread
Don't sit around get slammed instead

[Repeat Chorus]
