Lead a path from this destructive place,
cannot be slaughtered into an unholy disgrace,
a dark fate awaits the final mistake,
be free. You must escape.

[Chorus]
Who? You were targeted for termination,
blown away to desolation.
Who's next to be tagged for temination?
Somebody's everted.

Eyes of hatred peek upon you, have to figure out
a way to get fuckin' through, someone's claimed a big
price on your head, that someone wants you face down dead,
now it's too late, you screwed up, made a big mistake,
death gave you the final date.

[Repeat Chorus]
