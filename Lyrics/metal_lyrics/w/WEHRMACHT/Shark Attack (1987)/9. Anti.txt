You say you know, and hear what is new
You're on top of the scene, a regular "Shoe"
What's all this fuss, does it matter at all?
Who's better than who? Make others feel small
You're not too much, more of a stud
Than all those folks, you flick so much crud . . . 

It's just a game taht all people play
To be better than you, that's what they'll say
I don't really casre, you're as equal as me,
No one is better, I wish they could see
We are all the stuck here on this merry-go-round
This hell-hole called life, worst pit I have found
Learn that you're equal, the same as rest,
you're not so great, stop thinking you're the best!

[Chorus:]
ANTI - Down with this
ANTI - Down with that
ANTI - You don't like this
ANTI - You don't like that

[Solo: M.S.]

ANTI - You think you're the best
ANTI - Fuck all the rest
ANTI - You think you're so cool
ANTI - You're really a fool

[Solo: J.D.]
