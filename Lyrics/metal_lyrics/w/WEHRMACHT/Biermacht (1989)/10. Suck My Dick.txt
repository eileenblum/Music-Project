[Words: Brian, Riffs; Shann, Duffy, Brian]

Teacher tells my parents that I've been skipping school.
Don't matter to me 'cause I don't care,
that school is just for fools.

[Chorus:]
Suck my dick

They bitch me out,
it's nothing new to me it's just a game,
but when they start to say
you're grounded,
I just turn and say.

[Chorus:]
Suck my dick

So I called my girl to see how she's been,
damn she's being a snotty arrogant bitch again.
She caught me messin' around with this other chick,
we had sex so told the with to...

[Chorus:]
Suck my dick
