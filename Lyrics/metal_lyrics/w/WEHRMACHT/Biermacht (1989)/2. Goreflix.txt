[Words: Brian, Riffs: Duffy]

Addicted to the horror, I love to see the blood,
excitement runs through my veins
as I watch them kill the young
adrenalin is strong,
I thrive brutal death depicting scenes of graphic violence
is what fills up my head.

[Chorus:]
Murders, stabbing, snuffing I watch in sheer intent.
Slaughters, bleeding, eating, amusement makes me laugh.
People going crazy, killing just for fun,
Hitmen getting paid to kill victims with their guns.

Heads cut off here, guts chewed up there,
eyes scan the screen with that sickening vile stare.
As long as there is Adism, 
scraping and messy gore,
I won't even care 

[Repeat chorus]
