[Words: Everybody, Rifs: Marco &amp; Brian]

Oh my God, I feel so hungry.
Just got a craving for some munchies,
I want some pizza,
I want it now,
Gimme some food,
So I can chow,
I love to eat,
until full
I can't stop eating,
I'm on a roll,
Pig and pig,
until my stomach bloats.
Shoving more grub down my throat
Munchies!!!
C'mon, mom, give me some food,
I feel like an Ethiopian dude,
The more I wait,
the more I'll omplain,
I can't believe this, a hunger pain?
Muncheez
Rib chaw,
pizzamacht, barbecue chiken,
The greasy fast food clock is ticking,
if we come to your house, we'll raid your fridge,
in search of food, we're on a fridge,
in search of food,
we're on a binge
We eat out, we drink up.
We're never gonna stop,
if you don't have beer,
we'll gladly drink your pop,
Now I know because I've experienced the deadly disease,
It's a hunger thriving inard twisting feeling called the 
muncheez
Muncheez
