They had arisen taking control,
Ruling the land, leaders of all.
Rise of the reich,
masters supreme,
Wanting the world they almost succeeded.
Nation to nation they pillaged the land.
Retaliation with swift command.
Crushing the weak those in their way,
THANK GOD HITLER DIED,
we prayed for the day...

Under the swastika all bullshit stands the master race carried the plans...
ovens were warning chambers were full but Hitler had fallen out of control,
WE ARE NOT FASCIST...
