Slowly awakening
On the ground in forest
I can barely stand
The icy bite of winter is tearing my flesh

Few steps ahead
Hidden among the trees
Corpses unlighted by thin moonbeams
Pale faces in pain, they found no peace in death

Getting close, staring at their eyes
Their mouths frozen in silent cries
I know each and every one of them
I remember the pain

Jealousy, tortured me
Sadness, transformed me
Hypocrisy, angered me
Rancor, fed me

Frustration, mutilation
The faded color of my eyes
Powerless in front of the lie
My rage is waking up

In my back sounds of gluttony
I turn in around to face a different me
Weak with emaciated face
Suddenly I fall in the abyss

Jealousy, tortured me
Sadness, transformed me
Hypocrisy, angered me
Rancor, fed me

Pale faces in pain,
Pale faces in death
