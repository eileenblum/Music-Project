Â 
Come out and see
Into this world thatâll soon be yours
Into the circus fantasy
Amongs magicians, clowns and lost infants
Â 
Haunted by the memory
Sadness, their sole chorus
Childhood, dead still as a doll
In a world of putrid smell
Â 
They laugh to tears
As the elephants roar
Despite their torn faces
Their smiles carved forever
Â 
Nothing here is the same
Their shattered lives now gone
Their shadows slowly tremble
On the great waderâs shoulders
Â 
The caravanâs now their sole home
No better, no worse
Throwing their smiles away
Leaving misery behind
Â 
And the carrousel spins
As those vultures who have haunted their days
Hunched back by the torments
Flesh gnawed by feces
Â 
Seel clouds are crying tears aloud
Keeping the dead souls torturer away
Painfully tearing out their rusty nails
Thrown carelessly to hellâs Cerberus
Â 
Come out and see
Into this world that now is yours
Give in to this sweet harmony
Thou shouldn't suffer again
