Heâs the dawn of all things
Ymir the original being
Born from the heat and cold
Essence of the earth
Â 
From his body born daughters &amp; sons
His arms embrace the world
Father of the frost giants
He's both birth and death
Â 
Thrown in the Ginnungagap
By Odin and his brothers
Between Niflheim and Muspelheim
The yawning abyss is now his grave
Â 
The deluge of his blood
Killed all of them but Bergelmir
The last of a kind
The proud grandson
Â 
Creation of the world from the wounds
Oceans of blood
Mountains of his bones
His flesh, the walls of Midgard
Â 
Now secluded by Odin
The JÃ¶tuns maintain their land
Morphing us into wolves
Weâll track down all intruders
Â 
We, giants of the lore,
Strong we stand tall
Â 
We master the frost and might
From Utgard our fortress of ice
No matter how hard you cry
Even Thor fell in JÃ¶tunheim
Â 
We, giants of the lore,
Strong we stand tall
