Clash of the waves
The thundering storm
I have returned to the sea
To watch the roaring masses of clouds
Â 
The gods have obscured the sun
Creating an overwhelming celestial dome
The ground shook and broke in millions
Releasing the underworlds amongst men
Â 
Clash of the waves
The thundering storm
I have returned to the sea
To watch the roaring masses of clouds
Â 
They spread the great disease
A plague blacker than coal
Darkening skins and groaning hearts
The eyes as vain as the minds
Â 
The devastation is complete
The seas have engulfed the lands
And from the heights
I behold
Â 
âI witness the destruction of this world
And there is nothing I can do
I cry seeing it destroyed
These forces I loved
These mountains I respected
The fall of men would have been enough
But theyâre rather chosen chaosâ
Â 
Since everything have disappears
And all is lost
I canât refrain from thinking
To those responsible
Â 
Do you hear the cries of those poor creatures
Swept away by the blind waves
Â 
Can we talk about sadness and suffering
Since even the souls have ceased to be
