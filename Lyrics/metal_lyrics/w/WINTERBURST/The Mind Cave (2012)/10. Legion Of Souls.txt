Â 
From the top of the hill
He scans the horizon
Witnessing the march of two masses
About to collide
Â 
What will be left of us?
When weâll be dead for your cause
Will you remember us?
When youâll raise your crown
Â 
Heâs the harvester of souls
Lurking in the shadow
Â 
I can hear the drums in the distance
The wind is blowing harder
Just before the attack
Â 
What will remain of our memories?
When on the throne
The gold will shine
Reddened by the blood of the men
Â 
The storm stokes the rage of men
Changing their face into death masks
Each move brings the pain
Pulling out their feet from the icy mud
Â 
Butchery knows his time of glory
When the golden eagles get trampled
The eyes of wolves shine in this cold night
Chimaeras and ravens slowly awake from the stones
Â 
Theyâll be mine!
Faithful souls on my side!
Â 
âVocavi vos a mortuis
Trado arbitrium ultionis
Jungere hunc nos
Mutate vos animalia noctis
Dabo salve vobis
Dabo potestatem vobis
Venite ad me fideles bellatores
Non timedis dolorâ
Â 
You will remember us
When youâll be praying for compassion
Youâll feel sorry but not us
When weâll show our fangs
Â 
We feed us from your fear
Revenge is our glory
The cold has shielded our hearts
We forgot the pity
Â 
There is no chance to escape
To leave our darkness
Â 
I welcome the dead
Those died in vain
For a promise made
I welcome the dead
Â 
Wolves to hunt them downâ¦
Chimaeras, to smash them upâ¦
Ravens, to tear them apartâ¦
We are our legion
