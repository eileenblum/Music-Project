Â 
Forgotten since the baronâs death
Laying in the attic of the mansion
Unused, in the dust
The mirror's anger is growing
Â 
It can reveal the past and the future
The lies of the present
Even the blood stains
You just washed on your hands
Â 
A new owner settles down
A fallen legacy for the baronâs grand son
Discovering the mirror shining in the dark
âThis piece of art should be for all to seeâ
Â 
Dare you come in?
My world of illusions?
Will you dare to come see,
What there was and what would be?
Â 
Finally free, itâll release its bitterness
Enthroned in the biggest hall
Â 
Certainly the life turns into sheer nightmare
Frightening visions before their eyes
The mirror always shows its owner lies
Now face your ancestorâs sins
Â 
Brought in every room
The mirror never fails
Showing every tortures
Of the baronâs games
Â 
âIt canât beâ¦
This is insaneâ¦
I am not like themâ¦
Tell me what my fate is!â
Â 
Dare you come in?
My world of illusions?
Will you dare to come see,
What there was and what would be?
Â 
Finally free, itâll release its bitterness
Enthroned in the biggest hall
Â 
âYouâre not different
Youâll kill them all
Insanity can be so sweet
Do you want to break the chain?
âYes!â
