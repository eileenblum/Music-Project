They walk in the darkness of the night
Wandering in the last glimmer of envy
Torn between desire and madness
Alone in the heart of the sleeping forest
Â 
The temple along the bank
Made of cob and stone
Attracts those whom
Life has given no son
Â 
The cawing of crows
Shears silence of twilight
Suspended above the blast
A purple veil evaporates in the air
Â 
Kneeled down on the marble floor
Worshipping the goddess of fertility
Through kisses and offerings
As their mothers once did
Â 
As deities coming from Olympus
On a lighter pace, barely touching the ground
These nubile are slowly caressing their soft skin
Waving their sensual curves
Â 
Out of darkness come the Taurus and Aries
Lured by the milk flowing from their breasts
The Beasts come to feast
Thus ends the pagan ritual
