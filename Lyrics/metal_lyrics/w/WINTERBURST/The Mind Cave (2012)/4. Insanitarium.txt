Louisville, 19th Century
Clouds and darkness
In an insanitary chamber
A scream in the night
Â 
Haunted by the memory
Of brutality and madness
The death lurks in corridors
She knows the truth
Â 
The rope was taut
The chair rocked
Her neck was broken
Her soul forever prisoner
Â 
The hill remembers again
Children who played on the grass
Their laughs, their singings
Their coughs, the blood on their hands
Â 
The train comes
The dead walks
Through the night
Their green wide open eyes
Â 
The little girl waits in the dark
She remembers
Like the others
The final operation, the most painful
Â 
The blood on the floor
The smile of the doctors
Â 
Buckle with straps to not move
Torn pieces of leather snatch
Â 
The chest opened in two
The saw that cut their ribs
Â 
She remembers the singings of the choir
All standing and circling
Â 
The refectory still smell good coffee
Although, there's nothing left
A fade light, the dripping of the water
Her shadow appears and disappears
In the middle of the night
The sounds of his steps resound in my head
Â 
Louisville, 19th Century
World of sadness
Â 
The moon shine
The girl cries
Smock and wine
The doctor smiles
