Â 
In the North, the great wall of ice
The refuge of those who chose the black
Those who left their past
To join the Night Watch
Â 
Winter is coming
Freezing lands numbing bodies
Beyond the wall the others are waiting
Soon they will break it out
Â 
Poor kids mixed with villains
Hardly carrying swords too big for them
âThey train without knowing whatâs growingâ
For this bastion theyâll fall protecting
Â 
Surrounded by a threat colder than death
He only sees armors glittering in the moonlight
âTheyâre getting closer in a horrible whistlingâ
And the sword-trusts rain in bluish halo
Â 
Winter is coming
Freezing lands numbing bodies
Beyond the wall the others are waiting
Soon they will break it out
Â 
Scarlet tears drop
On the snow-covered ground
The leather attires
Soaked in flesh and blood
Â 
A blue light will shine
From the bottom of his pupils
He will come to furnish the ranks of the army
That no longer fears the steel
Â 
Winter is coming
