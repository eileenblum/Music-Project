Â 
In the cave of my mind
I enjoy the forbidden pleasures
between these silver walls
I chose to live in exile
Â 
My mind is a winter
Where the cold reigns supreme
Where snowstorms
Freeze the evils of my anger
Â 
My thoughts wander
In the dark maze I built
Wandering endlessly
Suffering eternally
Â 
Every day
I feed the beast
Whoâs keeping my heart
In my cold and desert world
Â 
In the cave of my mind
I have erected statues
Between these silver walls
In honor of my fallen heroes
Â 
I aspire to the impossible
The return of the sublime greatness
To this narcissistic exuberance
Of the ancient conquerors
Â 
In the cave of my mind
The cold marries the night
Between these silver walls
Lies my tortured soul
Â 
The mournful howling of the wind
Join my lonely life
Voluntary prisoner
In a world that escapes me
Â 
The day will come when everything will explode
In millions of crystal blades
Shining like a comet tail
Tearing darkness of the night
Â 
The monster will be released
Ice Behemoth eager for revenge
Arising from the hell
âMake the mort resound!â
Â 
In the cave of my mind
My throne is made of ice
Between these silver walls
Forever I will stay alone
