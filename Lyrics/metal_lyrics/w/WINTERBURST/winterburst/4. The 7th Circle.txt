Now that you're deep within
Drowning in your own dead sins
Now that you can't escape
Are you pleased with your pain?

Torturer of Christian souls
The punishments are human's horror
Now that you get what you wanted
Enjoy the nightmare

Charon led you towards the gates
Cerberus to guard the place
Judge Minos to choose your pain
Lucifer reigns in the flames

Tombs made of emaciated trees
Full of poisoned thorns
Tears of flesh for the Harpies
Your eternal punishment

Listen to these lamentations
Of the forests of inferno
The 7th circle of sinners
Torments and agonies

The slightest crack of their branches
Will water the Styx of their blood
Eternal dismemberment
One step higher in this evil scale

And they will behold
The fugitives
Wasted Shred by shred
By starving bitches

Now that you're deep within
Drowning in your own dead sins
Now that you can't escape
Are you please with your pain?

Listen to these lamentations
Of the forests of inferno
The 7th circle of sinners
Torments and agonies

Bound by the devil
Lust and violence are what
You're rotting for
By now and for eternity
Bow down to the infernal One
Your soul burning in his hand...
