Everything was prepared fine
Tables full of feast and wine
Everyone gathered for the crowning
The ascension of their new king

A palace of stone
Carved in the side of the mountain
Thousand of torches to light
The paved way to the altar

Shadows on the walls
Spinning like fireflies

Hypnotic scenery
Of this Dark Age ceremony
His plan has been so prepared
He knows this has not been fair

"Make way for the man
The one who will lead you
Have faith in him
Here is your new king!"

Rising and standing tall
The demon has been crowned by men again
The shadow of the Beast behind him
Fire in his eyes, he's laughing

The destiny's now sealed in blood
Submit to this cold embrace
Or you will fall one by one
By His hand
