War! Mars, my Master
Roman God, here are my offerings

Born on a battlefield
Misery I've been living
Broken in the deep of me
I only know blasphemy

Heavy barbarian burden
My life has been built on murders
I proudly brandish our banner
Crushing all people around

I am from Mars
Beholder of my own tragedy
I am from Mars
Torturer of my own sanity

Plunders, rapes
I kill relentlessly
Slaughters, thefts
I delight in savagery

Who were my parents?
What did I Forgot?
Has it always been so?

In my frenzy of executions
I add my aestheticism
Scratches and crucifixions
The zenith of my fantasies

I try to ignore my state
The weakness of my condition
I keep myself in the darkness
Taking refuge in uprising

I am from Mars
Betrayer of mankind
I am From Mars
Torturer of all humanity

My dementia will unleash the Gods' fury
It'll be certainly the last one
My soul is too evil to see the truth
With clarity

I ask for the Last Judgment of Jupiter
Apocalypse, Armageddon to come
Release us from our madness
I need to be the first one

Kill me... Kill me
Set them free from us
Kill me... Kill me
I need to be the first
