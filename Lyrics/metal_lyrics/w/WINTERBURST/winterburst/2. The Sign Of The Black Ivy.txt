In the arms of the death embrace
The child holds the cold hand of his mother
Refusing to see her glazed eyes
The black ivy imprisons them slowly

The ravens join the call
Gathering all around the isolated house
Vision of them through the window
Black birds cawing for the feast

I am your darkest fear
Reaping from the mists of time
I devour
Each ounce of power in you
Predating your children and wives
I devour
Each ounce of will in you

The black ivy's creeping all over the stones
Strengthening his hold on both lost souls
The gleam of the moon is already fading inside
Only candles to light the last goodbye

I am your darkest fear
Reaping from the mists of time
I devour
Each ounce of power in you
Predating your children and wives
I devour
Each ounce of will in you

I am your darkest fear
Reaping from the mists of time
I devour
Each ounce of power in you
Predating your children and wives
I devour
Each ounce of will in you

Intoxicate
Indoctrinate
Misery
We are our worst enemy
We are our worst enemy

You too
You got a poison ivy growing deep inside of you
