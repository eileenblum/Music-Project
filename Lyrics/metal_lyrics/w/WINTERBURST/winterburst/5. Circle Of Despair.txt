Watching the weak caught in atrocity
Sufferings and wounds done by humanity
Feeling so vain
Going insane
I just can't hide from the glimpse in my head

I will stand in front of them
Face the things that shouldn't be
Feeling the hate
Filling my veins
Today the vengeance will calm down my pain

The time has come to change
To break from the bounds of the human race
Devastating perversion of man
Brought us to ruin the gift that has been made

Slaughters of nature
Trails of blood left behind
Man needs to feel strong
No matter the cost

Egocentric self crowned fool
You have to fall down from your throne
Resumption of the power by the nature
To save the origins of the Earth

[Chorus]

Rise from the ashes
Summoned ancient Gods
Titans of nature
Forgotten by modern Man

Extreme punishment
For each and every one of them
Elements and creatures
Come to regain what is theirs

[Chorus]

I surrender to the inner power of the Earth
Leave my body and mind to it
What may be the end
Is surely a better place to be
