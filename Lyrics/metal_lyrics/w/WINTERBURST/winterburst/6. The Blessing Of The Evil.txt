I will destroy with the blessing of the evil
Purify this world, from this infection
From this tragedy, true face of destiny

Before my eyes, their duplicity
I can feel their hypocrisy

Be warned of the danger
Don't trust in them
Did you believe in what they said?
Beware of these preachers

Learn from the power of your roots
And the knowledge of your ancestors

Where is the savior?
Is there only one yet?
There are so much guilty
Now it's time to redress

I will destroy with the blessing of the evil
All these superstitions
Fantasized and unjustified
Wisdom against stupidity

Before my eyes, their duplicity
I can feel their hypocrisy

Be warned of the danger
Don't trust in them
Did you believe in what they said?
Beware of these preachers

With the blessing of what they call evil
With the blessing of our rights

How coward can they be
When they steal the lost souls
We'll take great pleasure
To make them eat their hearts

With the blessing of what they call evil
With The blessing of our rights

Don't deny your rights
Don't forget your duty
No one should control your mind

Don't be meaningless
Keep your head up high
Refuse their words
The true worth of life
With no frustration

Take your fate in your hands
Make your life a history
This chance won't last long
Cause we'll never, never, never, never, never go back
