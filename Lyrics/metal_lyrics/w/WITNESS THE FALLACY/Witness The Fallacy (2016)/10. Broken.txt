You're broken!
Feeling like there's nothing I can fix.
Your faith provoked!
A dumb bitch that doesn't deserve shit.
Why did I, even try?
Even though I knew you were worthless!
Gave you my, fucking time!
I hope you die in a pile of piss and shit.
My times been wasted,
Following these broken dreams.
Everything just seems to fade,
Meaning nothing to me!
So this what you call love?
You truly are a piece of shit.
Digging out my heart when someone should really be digging your own ditch!
You're disgusting, you make me sick!
Our feelings rusting .
Who would have thought it'd come to this?

Everything just seems to fade,
When I see her face! [2x]
So this what you call love?
You truly are a piece of shit.
Digging out my heart when someone should really be digging your own ditch!
You're disgusting, you make me sick!
Our feelings rusting .
Who would have thought it'd come to this?

It's just business!
