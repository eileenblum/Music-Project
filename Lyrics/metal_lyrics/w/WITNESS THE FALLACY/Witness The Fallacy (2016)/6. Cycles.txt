This is a curse that I must live with.
Visions of your death ruminate within my mind.

The voices are calling out to me.
Deception of my brothers falling to their knees.
Oh dear you sound so displeased to know that your true intension were to open your legs and (spread your disease)! [4x]

Now we're back to the same cycle.
Killing just for the sensation.
Anxiety is pulsating.
Throughout my veins, it pains me that you're the one that's on my list.
But I can not wait to rip off your fucking flesh.
Exposing all the filth that rots the minds of the simple kind.
Dissembled body limbs oscillating from the ceiling.
You were nothing but a trick that seeked to choke on their fucking dicks.
Everything seems to be falling apart around me.
Someone throw me a raft I'm drowning in a sea of madness, there is nothing left, better stay out of my path.
Now we're back to the same cycle.
Killing just for the sensation.
Anxiety is pulsating.
You will not dethrone the king!
Bow before your new adversary!
The voices are silenced, now I can be free.
Now we're back to the same cycle.
Killing just for the sensation.
Anxiety is pulsating.
Throughout my veins, it pains me that you're the one that's on my list.
But I can not wait to rip off your fucking flesh.
Exposing all the filth that rots the minds of the simple kind.
Dissembled body limbs oscillating from the ceiling.
You were nothing but a trick that seeked to choke on their fucking dicks.
Everything seems to be falling apart around me.
Someone throw me a raft I'm drowning in a sea of madness, there is nothing left, better stay out of my path.
Now that I have you within my grasp, I promise to make sure the suffering everlasts. [4x]
