Even though I've tried to make it right,
I don't care what goes on the inside!
It's my time and you will see,
Bring me down but never get the best of me!
So many times I think I am worthless,
In the eyes of the ones I love!
What must I do?
Emptiness within my chest,
My lungs collapse fighting for every breath!
If only you could see you're my disease,
Decomposition rotting flesh!
On my deathbed waiting for my answer,
For all the things that I've done!
Hope nobody holds it against me.
There will be a day when know if you're really going up or below.
Then you will see when the light disappears, what you really have to fear.
And there will be a day that you see what it means to be.
There will be a day where you go to a place that nobody knows.
Come and join me for you're the reason I'm here,
Come to rot with the scum my dear!
Deep within the catacombs, this purgatory is a dream gone old.
Life destroys us with peace comes death, I'll find serenity in your last breath!

This will be the longest sleep that I have taken!
A constant dream, my soul left for the forsaken.
Emptiness within my chest,
My lungs collapse fighting for every breath!
If only you could see you're my disease,
Decomposition rotting flesh!
On my deathbed waiting for my answer,
For all the things that I've done!
Hope nobody holds it against me.
There will be a day when know if you're really going up or below.
Then you will see when the light disappears, what you really have to fear.
And there will be a day that you see what it means to be.
There will be a day where you go to a place that nobody knows.
Come and join me for you're the reason I'm here,
Come to rot with the scum my dear!
Deep within the catacombs, this purgatory is a dream gone old.
Life destroys us with peace comes death, I'll find serenity in your last breath!
