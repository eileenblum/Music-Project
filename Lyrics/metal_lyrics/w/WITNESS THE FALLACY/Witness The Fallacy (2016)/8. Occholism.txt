We are nothing but a puny little spec,
I'm surprised the gods haven't sent us to our death.
All we do is destroy and corrupt the mother earth,
Sucking the life from the soil that we don't deserve!
Watch the mountains,
Crumble right before your eyes.
This is a product of humanity!
Overwhelm corrupt this virgin ground,
Just to overpopulate a brand new town.
Our race is like a parasitic worm,
Killing the host just to preserve one's own.
We are nothing but a puny little spec,
I'm surprised the gods haven't sent us to our death.
All we do is destroy and corrupt the mother earth,
Sucking the life from the soil that we don't deserve!
These lands have become,
Desolate with no hope!
Money cannot replace,
The carnage that we have done.
How long must we see,
Our mother earth bleed?
The deepest sea will rise,
As the heavens close.
Hell and earth will collide,
As the sun explodes.
Only few will survive,
Yet death still grows.
Nothing will stand,
Woman or man.
