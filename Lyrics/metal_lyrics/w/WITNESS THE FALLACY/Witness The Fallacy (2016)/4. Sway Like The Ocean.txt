Sway like the ocean!
Back and forth we go.
Barely staying afloat.
Water within her lungs,
But down you'll have to go.
There is no rest for the unknown.
I hope you choke!
Creatures from the dark
Will soon rip my soul apart
Carried out by your recklessness
Wish I could have seen this shit!
Crushing me within these depths
Down to the gallows I go!
Do you see how we got here in this water of regret?
I could never admit that I fell into this abyss.
Slowly I will begin rotting on the bottom of the ocean floor.
My life will soon erase.
My existence will soon be no more.
My life will soon erase!
But this is not the end!
