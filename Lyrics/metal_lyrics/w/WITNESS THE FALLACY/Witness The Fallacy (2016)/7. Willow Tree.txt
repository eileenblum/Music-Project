You will succumb to me tonight!
I will rip out our larynx making sure,
You will never speak of you seen.
Next I go for your hands making sure,
You will never write of this horrid sight.
As you beg for me to stop this,
You could have avoided this
If you had had stuck to our promise.
I'm so sorry
Things couldn't be differently.
You forced this upon me
Maybe in another life.

Things could be better
But you had to interfere with me.
And now your friends and family begin to worry.

I have chopped you up
Displaced your embodiment
Removing your limbs,
Stuffing you into the Earth.
There is no trace left of you,
Why do I have blood lust for
These bitches, whores and skanks.
You are left under the willow tree.
I'm so
I'm so sorry
Things couldn't be differently.
You forced this upon me
Maybe in another life.

Things could be better.
So much better
A little better.
My dear it would have ended, so much fucking better.
