But this is a reason to live!
This is our reason to live, to survive we all die trying to find.
Our wrongs from our rights; but you know it's just time we all defy:
"Within these walls, we will break free!
Within these walls, we will find a way!" [4x]
Close my eyes every time I feel this way I slowly die, could I be restrained?
You were right, how did I end up this way?
Now it's time, things have got to change!
Living a lie, trying to find!
Anything that comes my way to ease my pain
Living a lie, trying to find!
Everything that comes my way and make it mine!
Oh!
And I will make it mine and you will see in due time.
Losing hope, but you can't let go!
Losing hope!
We will conquer the world.
You will see nothing can stop me!
There is no control, or higher anarchy. There is no power stronger than me!
Now you will see nothing can stop me!
