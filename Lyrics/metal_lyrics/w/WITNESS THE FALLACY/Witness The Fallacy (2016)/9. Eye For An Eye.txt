An eye for an eye will make the world blind,
But why should I care when the hopes and dreams have been ripped right from me!
Ripped right from me!
So this is what it feels like
To be down on your luck?
Everyone surrounds you but they don't give a fuck!
You try to find the answer,
But it is oh so clear.
That everyone here doesn't love you,
They don't hold you dear!
This is all I know!
No direction where to go!
This is all I know!
Nothing in life to show!
This is all I am
This is all I have
Life beyond our comprehension
Lifeless strands left behind like all the rest.
I'm surprised I'm not fucking dead,
Lost without a plan.
If only I could understand!
So this is what it feels like
To be down on your luck?
Everyone surrounds you but they don't give a fuck!
You try to find the answer,
But it is oh so clear.
That everyone here doesn't love you,
They don't hold you dear!
You will never be forgiven!
