Alone I consume myself within this room
Society has locked these demons in here with me.

With me!

Everyday we break this pain!
Welcome to oblivion! Oh!

Come child and take my hand
For there is a place you don't quite understand
This place is a wasteland
So take my hand into oblivion

This is the place where the light takes its last stand.

I cannot see this through.

Lost in your selfish ways, you'll never understand
The loved ones you betray, will turn their backs
Sheltered within this shroud, you're going astray
Step into seclusion, obscurity awaits.

Into the emptiness.

Welcome to oblivion!
