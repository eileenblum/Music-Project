We have come here
To liberate your kind
Kill those who are in the shadows
Of your sheltered mind.

Always remember those who had your back.
Replace those that hind behind there false hopes that leave them blind.
Never forget those who fuckin' turned it.
Always remember those who had your back.
Never forget.

We will forgive.
We will never forget.

With our backs against the wall,
We have no other choice!

So this is home?
We are all lost
This place is rotten
With betrayal.

So I've seen what's become of you!
Your colors are showing true!
