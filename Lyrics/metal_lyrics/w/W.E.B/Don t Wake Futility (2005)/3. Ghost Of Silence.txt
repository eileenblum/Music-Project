I hear you in the silence
I kiss you in the emptiness
I feel your breath in the air
I know you are always there

God prays for me no more
God prays for me no more
God prays for me no more
Enter the silence

I hear you in the silence â hear me in the silence
I kiss you in the emptiness â kiss me in the emptiness
I feel your breath in the air â feel my breath in the air
I know you are always there â I am always there
I am always thereâ¦
I am always thereâ¦
I am always thereâ¦
