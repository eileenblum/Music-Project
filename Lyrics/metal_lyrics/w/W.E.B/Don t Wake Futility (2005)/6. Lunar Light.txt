Washed by the Lunar Light
Listen to them screaming in silence
Under the Lunar Flare
Their eyes are glowing
Theyâre singing a song
For the broken hearted
Theyâre crying at the wind
That carries my weeps through the air

Spread your blood in velvet sheets
And lie on them with tyranny
Blessings whispered through the air
Bouncing and healing your despair

Lang the tears from my skin
Dry them down, let me beâ¦
Bite this orchid, make it bleed
Make it suffer, make it weepâ¦

Under the Lunar Light
Listen to them screaming in silence
Under the Lunar Flare
Their eyes are glowing
Theyâre singing a song
For the broken hearted
Theyâre crying at the wind
That carries my weeps through the air

Oh, fairy godmother fly
For my prayers should not be forsaken
Make them a spell, make my angel rise
Or take me with you â to the darkness of the shadow land

Iâm sick of the hope to meet you again
Sometime, somewhere in another world
I was praying for you
But my God was never there -and my angel now is dead
