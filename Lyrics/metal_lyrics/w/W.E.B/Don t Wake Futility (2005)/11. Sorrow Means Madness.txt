Walking through the alley
With the meaning of life
Trying to find the answers
That brought me here from the afterlife

Sorrow means Madness
It means endless pain and sadness

Walking through the alley
With the meaning of hate
Pale yet hurting visions
Creep silent through my brain

Thereâs no exit
Not a single light at the end of the tunnel
Thereâs no hope
Not a single word from your lips in my mind
Sorrow,
Fills my soul with tears
Darkness,
Only the stars look here
Blackened,
The spirits possessing my soul stop fight
And you,
Youâre fading away inside a velvet night

Pschycopathetic
Everything shrunken to Hell
No love, no hate just darkness
The end is close
Bewareâ¦
