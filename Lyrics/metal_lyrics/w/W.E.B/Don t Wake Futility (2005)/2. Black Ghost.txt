Iâve returned from another world
Iâm back for something that I donât know
Evil nightmares while Iâm awake
Are they signs? Are they trails?

Like a Black Ghost â white cold flesh covers me
With a Black Bird â eyes made for me to see

So the nightmares are visions to guide
I always see Shelly saying goodbye
I see the beasts that destroyed our life
Iâll drive them crazy by killing men five

Like a Black Ghost â white cold flesh covers me
With a Black Bird - eyes made for me to see

Some will die
Some will mourn
Thus this world
May hear my cry

Within a cell of emptiness
The serpentâs soul eliminates
Praise, Love and Innocence
To sensitive oblivions

A restless spirit rises
In a realm of blood and flesh
With no Regrets, Remorse nor Fear
Shall vanish all of Satanâs tears
