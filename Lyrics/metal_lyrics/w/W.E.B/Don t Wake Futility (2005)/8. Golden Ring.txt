(I remember the attic
Full of lightened candles awaits
It keeps a well hidden secret
Wasnât it your Golden Ring?

Now that the light is gone
Something was missing all time long
I see you calling my name
On your hand the Golden Ring)

Memories blast
My mind full of flashes
Canât forget the past
Though itâs gone to ashes

One by one
Even Pandora wouldnât open
Ring by ring
God get me back into my coffin

The Golden Ring is calling me
This is my heart. Itâs torn apart
The Golden Ring. Take it my love from me
This is my fate to set her spirit free
