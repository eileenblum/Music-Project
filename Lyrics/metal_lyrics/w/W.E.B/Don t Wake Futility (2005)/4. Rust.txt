A sea of hate is not enough to wash my pain away
The books of wisdom won't tell me why you fade to grey
Cold rain's in your eyes now where springs once come and gone
Donât know how can I still hope there'll be another dawn

Your words are thorns nailed in my heart
My hope's been raped by lies
I kneel down to the ground again
So no one ever hear my...

...Cries in the night fade away
As love and hate become one once again
And painâs only left now for me
Pure love will whip my soul till its send free

Eyes are dry canât cry no more cause cries wonât bring you back
Last hope dies in daylight worst fear grows in the dark
I watch you walk away again now that I need you most
And every single memory has now turned to ghost

I d die now for your warm embrace
But all I feel is ice
Pain is overwhelming now
Oh God I cant avoid theseâ¦

...Cries in the night fade away
As love and hate become one once again
And painâs only left now for me
Pure love will whip my soul till its send free

I pray youâll never feel like I do
Such pain would tear you apart
Regrets and guilt instead of me
Embrace you in the dark

...Cries in the night fade away
As love and hate become one once again
And painâs only left now for me
Pure love will whip my soul till its send free
And I yearn for your touch
To show me this can't have ended so fast
Take my hand; time has come now at last
Together we will rise above this rust
