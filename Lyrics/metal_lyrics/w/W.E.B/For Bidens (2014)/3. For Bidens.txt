Coven summon
Starlight worship
Demons upon
Aeons of grief

Wearing our wisdom of chaos
Feeding on lifeâs bright core
The ultimate nothing incomplete
The moonlight marks Heavenâs fall

For Bidens For Bidens
Iâm Draining your soul

Death killed by one embrace
Life freezing through your veins
Stab me now and be my scorn

We open our eyes by nightfall
Predators thirsting for blood
The wolves and the owls march to war
We stand by the full moon and howl

For Bidens For Bidens
Iâm Draining your soul

Death killed by one embrace
Life freezing through your veins
Stab me now and be my scorn
