Breathing gold and tearing diamonds
Son of Gods enslaving men
Building tombs by whip and terror
He would be the greatest king

No pain No prays for 
The Prince of 1000 Frozen Suns
All slayed, betrayed
The Prince of 1000 Frozen Suns

Unjust life quickly transformed
Fear to anger, wrath and hate
All is gone to bring him down now
He shall fall, he chose this fate

No pain No prays for 
The Prince of 1000 Frozen Suns
All slayed, betrayed
The Prince of 1000 Frozen Suns
