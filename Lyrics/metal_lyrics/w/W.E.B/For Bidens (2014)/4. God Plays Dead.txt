Gazing upon cloudy skies
Itâs angelsâ time to sing La-la-la-la
A Prometherian psalm
A massive hymn to 

The end of this world

God plays dead - Itâs the chaos in your brain
God plays dead - Let us extinct and sin free
God plays dead - Itâs a feast on idolsâ chain
God plays dead - In an orgy dressed God free

Itâs the age man falls apart
God laughs sarcastically Ha-ha-ha-ha
Itâs coming soon
Itâs late to save this place nor 

Pray for it 

God plays dead - Itâs the chaos in your brain
God plays dead - Let us extinct and sin free
God plays dead - Itâs a feast on idolsâ chain
God plays dead - In an orgy dressed God free
