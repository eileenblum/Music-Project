Eligos â Eligos â Eligos â Eligos
Eligos â Eligos â Eligos â Eligos
Eligos â Eligos â Eligos â Eligos
Eligos â Eligos â Eligos â Eligos

I will swallow your soul

Eligos â Eligos â Eligos â Eligos
Eligos â Eligos â Eligos â Eligos
Eligos â Eligos â Eligos â Eligos
Eligos â Eligos â Eligos â Eligos

Send me guilt and bury your dead war
Show me your risk and offer me pain
Carry my dark guild onto your shoulders
May their blood baptize the earth

Slaves fall to your knees and obey thy master
Serve me with fear and terror. Treat me as god and as king
You âve sworn a league to Satan and you will share my triumph
I am the demon of war. Your souls are furiously descending

Feed me your souls , as sacrifice
My altar is blessed by both fire and ice
Burn all your kings, their lines are broke
There is no crown for a dynastyâs son

Bury your friends, bury your mind
Bury your god and bury your life
The fates now spoke, the dice are thrown
Nothing moves but the calm before the storm

The calm before the storm
