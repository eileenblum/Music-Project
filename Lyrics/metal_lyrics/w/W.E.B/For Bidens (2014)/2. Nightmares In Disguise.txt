Closing your eyes is isolation
A dimension you play Maryâs son
Itâs your sleep
Breathing deep

Walls are changing shape
Flowers turn to grey
Nails pushed in your face
Crawling snakes parade

Nightmares in disguise
The dreams that you despise
Nightmares in disguise
The closet is open

You hear your mother singing lullabies
You fear the monsterâs smoking bright eyes
In your sleep
See me creep

Clowns are laughing strange
Winds creating haze
Crows fly in weirder shapes
Youâre lost in moonshineâs maze

Nightmares in disguise
The dreams that you despise
Nightmares in disguise
The closet is open
