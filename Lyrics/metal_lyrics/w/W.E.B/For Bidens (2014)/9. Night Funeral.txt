Early night, with my dearest friend we walk
Nothing seemed that this evening will end with a red dawn
I could only smile. Iâve had a happy life
Nothing seemed that a grown-up (sigh)

I could see blurred faces. I could see them all
When the air just started to feel cold
I never had a chance to see this world
Mother do you hear it? My final call?

Mother are you ready for my funeral?
Mother are you ready for my funeral?
Mother are you ready for my funeral?
Mother are you ready for my funeral?

Pointing guns upon a child â NO
Overuse of civil rights â NO
I just felt a bullet in me â Dead Cold
Mother your son is just a victim â NO

Mother are you ready for my funeral?
Mother are you ready for my funeral?
Mother are you ready for my funeral?
Mother are you ready for my funeral?

Show me your face, your pain, your fears
Show me now
Show me your guns, your name, your tears
Show me now
Show me that future could be clear
Show me now
Show me a life your ears would hear
Show me now

Tell me my rights, my debts, my years
Tell me now
Tell me my time, my job, my realm
Tell me now
Tell me a tale thatâs not severe
Tell me now
Tell me if innocence is real
Tell me now

Save Our Souls
Save Our Souls
Save Our Souls
Save Our Souls
