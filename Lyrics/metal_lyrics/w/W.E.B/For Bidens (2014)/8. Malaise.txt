Iâm sure you always envy the way I smile at life
Iâm sure your only wish was only standing there watching me die

I donât pry â wonât brake the boundaries of your world
Just do the same
Stay there, just right where you are.
Danger â Private area

Canât you see the hunger?
Canât you feel the horror?
Canât you hear them screaming?
Canât you wake from sleeping?
Donât you see the madness?
Donât you see the sadness?
Donât you touch our spirit.
Donât you dare to spill it.

I lied just to hide my weakness from evil sight
People never forgive the truth. People are always lying

Itâs no wonder why the traitors still breathe
You mortals are weak, pathetic, naÃ¯ve

Reality is braking out. Danger â Danger
Reality is braking out. Danger â Danger
Danger â Danger. Danger â Danger

Itâs breaking me down
Watching me die
