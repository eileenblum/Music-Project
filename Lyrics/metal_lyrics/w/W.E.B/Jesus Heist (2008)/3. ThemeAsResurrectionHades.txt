Behold the child of doom stands before you
Keep him in your arms
Haunt with him your soul

Pain is sweet like cold soft rain
Lust is creeping through my veins
"kneelâ i say to my slaves
Pray and hope you will be saved

Pain â sometimes we feel alone
Hate â sometimes our heart is stone
Sloth â we are the tongue of christ
Cruel fate
Pale â we are a race undead
Greed â the angels dressed in red
Shred â sometimes regret is dead
The race that bleed

Behold a prince of sins kneels before you
Forgive him
Molest him
Enslave his cyan matter
