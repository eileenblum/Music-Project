By the time of our last graven kiss
Even the roses will mourn
Blood red tears will run down their blossoms
To wet the soil that will cover my soul

Crave me, lay me
So i can wash my sight on thee
Kiss me, pray for me
So i can embrace your life through me

You will be the last to know the truth
You will be the last
To experience the real
I am the truth

Always so pale yet burned by the source of all life
Always so joyful yet drowned by the fake love of the dead

The dead â they whisper my name
The dead â they call me away

All i ever wanted was here and gone
All i ever dreamed is not mine anymore

Immortality is loneliness
Death is a release
By life's cold moist cell
