You will always wonder why you stand empty
Before a white picture replacing the pureness inside

Thoughts thoughts thoughts
Wake up memories
Thoughts thoughts thoughts
Rape your mind

From a life surrounded by darkness

I will scare you with my smile
I will freeze you with my laugh
God says-i hide nothing
Immortal intelligence destructive
