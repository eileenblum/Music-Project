A beauty dawned before my eyes
A pervert remorse â no despise
Malicious as a Cosmic Joke
And vicious as a whore off coke

Hanger for sex
Red crucifix
Rising climax
Count 666

Get Me Corrupted â SipSiS

My libido is now awake
Youâre the next God will forsake
Thatâs no lie this is not fake
Youâre to drown in blood Sperm Lake

Life is burning
Begging yearning
Throats bleed screaming
Flesh is tearing

Get Me Corrupted â SipSiS

My eyes are setting like the sun
Into a black sea of weeps
Drowning demonic fairies down
And my heart will meet its eclipse

For Iâll never see her eyes
Which shined above the stars
To lighten the helpless
For Iâll never feel her arms
Which could embrace a fallen leaf
And turn it into a morning rose

So fresh
So wet
So cold
So pale

Like the dead

Get Me Corrupted â SipSiS
Get Me Corrupted â SipSiS
