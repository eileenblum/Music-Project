Im the seeker of your soul
Im the ripper of your nothingness
You cannot espace my wrath
You wont live to see the dawn

The serial killer of your dreams
My maniac mind seeks for vengeance
Im undead and invisible
You will die before i'm gone

Sticking knifes in your head
Poisoned needles in your heart
This wont have a happy end
You will all be sent to hell

Im an angel sent to kill
Im a beast that's wounded deep
You are now all my victims
You will taste fear pain and screaming
