Oh Jesus,
Why did God throw you here?
Oh Jesus,
Why did you speak to me?
Oh Jesus,
Itâs me again your blessed child
I cry out,
The cause your doctrines gave us hell

Take away our sadness
The remaining treasure of this world
All the plagues and madness
And the death your priests gave to us all

Cherouvem singing psalms to thee
For the misery
Through all history
Blaming Jesus Heist
Do you hear us Christ?
We still wait
Judgment Day

Hey Jesus,
You hear me now, so I know
I beg you,
Just give us light and fill us hope
