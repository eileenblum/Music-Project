Look in the mirror
Come pay a visit to me once more
Look in the mirror

Tell me what you see beneath the shore
I see the one i've never dreamt
I see the one i've always felt
You are the one i will forgive
Because

Without you i'm incomplete

This struggle you must not repeat
Without me you're incomplete
Your will, shall meet with defeat
In my absence order retreat

I'm the one you draw under your bed
The one you talk when all is fled
The one who's laughing when you bleed
And take over all there is from thee

No!
You see? you can't hide from me
No!
I shall be forever here
Because

Without you i'm incomplete

This struggle you must not repeat
Without me you're incomplete
Your will, shall meet with defeat
In my absence order retreat

It's me
The other you
Watch me rise
In front of you

I walk with jesus on my shoulder
The eye of ra is watching over
I've got the devil on my side
And in my arms the gifts of the night
Without you i'm incomplete
No! no! no! no... go away...
