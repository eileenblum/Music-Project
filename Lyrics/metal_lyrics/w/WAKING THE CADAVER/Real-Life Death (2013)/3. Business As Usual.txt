trust what they say?... yeah right i'm better off just taking the knife to my wrists
prayers that they say will never find their way back inside my mind
nothing but brain wash story time
lies always served up with chime
i make these phony signs
religion is a business and a crime
trust what they say?... yeah right i'm better off just taking the knife to my wrists
prayers that they say will never find their way back inside my mind
all just slaves, not me
i'm making my own history
taking the lives
of all who preach
silence the speech
banish all who teach
do not be played
by the prophecy
they look too far
it's infinite war
the passages are all fucking made up
don't believe in anything they feed you
how the fuck do you think i made it this far
i relied on myself
not worried about where they gonna send me afterwards
prepare for death
i embrace the trip
my big ride is up next
trust what they say? yeah right i'm better off just taking the knife to my throat
nothing but brain wash story time lies always served up with chime
prayers that they say will never find their way back inside my mind
why do i make these phony signs, religion is a business and a crime
how do you think, what doesn't add up, should be your definite guiding light
think for yourself don't let these fools keep a strong hold on you
prepare yourself - prepare for death
what you fear is really the only way out
the life you're living is not what you think
