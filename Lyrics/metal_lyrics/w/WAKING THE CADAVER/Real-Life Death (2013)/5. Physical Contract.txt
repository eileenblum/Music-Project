high on cocaine, sins
running right through my veins
bad form to run your mouth again
i know about everything...
next time i see you - you'll be suffering
the physical contract doesn't feel bad for cries
it just brings justice
to those who lie
breaking you down
you're scared stiff by the enforcer
preparing swiftly to subtract your life from your body
i already know it's gonna happen abruptly 
a ruthless scolding and then a steady one-two
next you'll love what i got in store for you
it's the contract you broke and now it's smashing you
your mangled face hurt so bad
your whole life's ending
enduring this pain is not an option
you're suffering
the physical contract doesn't feel bad for cries
it just brings justice
to those who lie
breaking you down
you're scared stiff by the enforcer
it's time to seal the deal
this contract deals only death
i make them pay with their life
