Pissed off, hatred brews
Seeking you, your face its clear
That you're terrified of me
Assault style attack is how you'll get taken out

No mercy shown when your dropped to the ground
Assault style attack is they'll get taken out
No mercy shown when they all drop to the ground
Targeting your pathetic kind

Preying upon you - you the weak
Smelling your fear all throughout the venue
You don't know your gonna die soon
Disrespect straight to your face

Quick hands are gonna do the talkin'
My fists are gonna start flyin'
There won't be no lyin'
No more eyeballin'

I'm bringin' the pain
Drugs got me goin' insane

SNAPPED IN HALF!

Snapped in Half

This motherfucker never had a chance
Now I'm crushin' your skull
Snapped in half
This pussy never had a fuckin' chance

Now I'm crushin' your skull
You thought your hard now your dead
Coward is all you'll ever be
You thought your hard now your dead

Coward is all you'll ever be
Targeting your pathetic kind
Preying upon you - you the weak
Smelling your fear all throughout the venue

You don't know you're gonna die soon
Your bones they shattered like glass
Your blood shed across the whole floor
Your face mashed to a pulp

Your puny friends are gettin' rolled out
It's called street justice payback
Your bones they shattered like glass
Blood shed across the whole floor

There are no limits to why my pain can bring
No one is ever gonna stop me
It's plain to see that I beat your ass to death
No one was ever gonna stop me.
