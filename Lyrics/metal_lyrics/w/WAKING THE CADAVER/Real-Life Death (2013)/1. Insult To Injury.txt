payback is a bitch motherfucker
especially when ya don't see it coming
ya thought wrong thinking ya could hide
behind your lard of lies
here is where i draw the line
like a starved pitbull
released from its cage
exploding outrage
i'm gonna take a soul
you're still thinking you're safe
in your own little world
here i come
injecting my insanity
vengeance
better expect plenty of foul play
berate
slamming a true slap in the face
insults
they are doing a number on you
hurtful, like a brick-bat
comments are cutting ya down quick
suffer...
eye to eye i'm making matters worse
i see that you're receiving immense pain
trust me, i'm doing all i can to prolong this torture
you look so pathetic
fear the words
adding insult to the injury
adding insult to the injury
phrases have scorn your core
exactly my intent
verbal abuse has given you sores no time to repent
you dug your own grave with this one
there is no turning back
shut the fuck up with all your stuttering
i offer no forgiveness when i attack
what made ya think - ya better - ya never once thought about the right thing
what made ya think - ya better - ya never - once saw me coming...
so now two wrongs make a right. no longer being polite
it's open house, on little fucks like you
i only see red, black, and white
this time my words speak
louder than my actions
overwrite your thoughts
or face my shriek
like a starved pitbull
released from its cage
exploding outrage
i'm on a roll
this time my words speak
louder than my actions
