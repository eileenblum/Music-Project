human souls are now all slaves
for all of hells eternity

evil marches to the kingdom of heaven

smashing down,
the pearly gates
army of immoral darkness
attacking

only the holy
having zero pity
severed wings
and burning feathers
spewing death at angels

beyond god, butchering the deity
beyond god, ultimate supremacy [x2]

this is how satan works his angle
every messenger will, die slow one by one they are sent
down below to my hell

this maker thinks , he met his match
think again soon you , wont have a head to scratch
blood pouring everywhere
from all the torn flesh

im undefeated , by hate driving hunger
conquering the ruthless battle
fighting on the side of evil
i made sure, i had most kills

kills, the most kills
i had the most kills
kills, the most kills

im undefeated , by hate driving hunger
conquering the ruthless battle
fighting on the side of evil
i made sure, i had most kills

the most kills [x7]
