Choke as I squeeze your throat,
Drown as I hold you down,
Never get free,

Choke as I squeeze your throat,
Drown as I hold you down,
You'll never get free,

Now that your captured,
The time now has come,
To feel the pain,
The pain i reign,
Reign supreme,
Youâll never get free,

Bones - Brains - Blood - Raw,

Your about to face the wrath of my, ruthless beatings with my fist,
Your about to face the wrath of my, ruthless beatings with my fist,

There is,
No way out of here this time,
Just kiss your ass goodbye,

Donât even waste your time,
Thinking how to escape my sinful scheme,
You canât break those chains,

Doom is whatâs in store for you,
Now youâre not so fuckinâ tough,
With all your organs split,
To hell with your prayers,
Nothing can save you now,
Go internet fagit cry,
Now its all over,

Making an example,
Ridiculing you,
Making an example,
Ending your life
Making an example,
Ridiculing you,
Making an example,
As I stand proud,

I OWN VICTORY!
Now I Reign Supreme,
Over your life.
