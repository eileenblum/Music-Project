Disrespect, violation
This is why you require punishment
Failure to see authority
Now has brought you to your knees

Begging for forgiveness
Pleading for your life
Nothing will save you
It's time to put up a fight

Smashing you with vicious blows
When I stop - no-one knows
Seeing your blood splattered all over me
Embraces the truth that I am unholy.

It was my pleasure
To rip you apart
Now that i taught you a lesson
You will never forget

I'll take down your friends
I'll take down your family
This is something I should have done from the start

Crushing blows right to your skull
When I stop nobody knows
