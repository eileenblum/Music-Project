We live in an empty world
People are crying in their soul
Everything just seems
As we made them for ourselves

Now our time is up
Fate is knocking on the door
He comes to go with us
Behind the black curtain

You'd better close the window
You'd better close the door
No-one hears your screaming out of fear

I am the final
I'm the mortal destiny
I am the cruel who takes away your souls

Few words we need to say
We had the chance to change our life
The task is not an easy one
To find a better way

You'd better close the window
You'd better close the door
No-one hears your screaming out of fear

I am the final
I'm the mortal destiny
I am the cruel who takes away your souls

[solo]

You'd better close the window
You'd better close the door
No-one hears your screaming out of fear

I am the final
I'm the mortal destiny
I am the cruel who takes away your souls

I am the final
I'm the mortal destiny
I am the cruel who takes away your souls
