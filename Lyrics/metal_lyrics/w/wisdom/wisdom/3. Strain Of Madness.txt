Come in here
Listen to my words
So much things I need to tell right here
Come in now
I am all at sea
Help me get the better of my fear

In the nights
I wake up from my sleep
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Paranoid
Voices in my dreams
Strain of madness overmasters me

Give your hands to me, stay tonight
Bring me through my dear
Stay or else I will lose my mind
And die before my time

More and more
Overrules my mind
In the end the evil comes to life
Strange to say
The world becomes so plain
Oh I know I have to meet my fate

Give your hands to me, stay tonight
Bring me through my dear
Stay or else I will lose my mind
And die before my time

[solo]

Give your hands to me, stay tonight
Bring me through my dear
Stay or else I will lose my mind
And die before my time

Give your hands to me, stay tonight
Bring me through my dear
Stay or else I will lose my mind
And die before my time

Give your hands!
