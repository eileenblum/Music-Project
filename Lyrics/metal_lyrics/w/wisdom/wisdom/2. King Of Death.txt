I am the ruler, the king of the world
You all were born to be my slaves
New for the future, you all have to serve
I'll bring to heels who fight against

I am the Lord and you're my servant
I'm the King of Death
Obey the law you unbeliever
Or go to hell

Die for me, obey by all means
Go through lands and thousand seas
Help to make my private ends
Fight for holy virgin lands

I see the fallen, their blood on the ground
Out of these souls I get my faith
I'm just a demon, a voice from the dark
No-one will never see my face

I am the Lord and you're my servant
I'm the King of Death
Obey the law you unbeliever
Or go to hell

Die for me, obey by all means
Go through lands and thousand seas
Help to make my private ends
Fight for holy virgin lands

I am the Lord and you're my servant
I'm the King of Death
Obey the law you unbeliever
Or go to hell

Die for me, obey by all means
Go through lands and thousand seas
Help to make my private ends
Fight for holy virgin lands
