There's a man who's smiling, although
Kills, no matter, when
There's a guy who hates us still, he
Is a leading man
There's a voice of agony, the
Crying of the fools
Hear the bells of sanity, when
You break the rules

I'd like to fly away
Leave the world behind now
I'd like to find a way
Where I'm left to fly

Fly high with me
Fly with the wind
Fly with the wind of failure
Useless the life, where
Evil disguise
Covers the faces around

There's a man who's kindly, although
Betrays his best friends
There's a guy who's doing time for
Giving rise to death
There's the want of charity, they
Look down on the poor
Feel the comin' tragedy, when
You break the rules

I'd like to fly away
Leave the world behind now
I'd like to find a way
Where I'm left to fly

Fly high with me
Fly with the wind
Fly with the wind of failure
Useless the life, where
Evil disguise
Covers the faces around

[solo]

Fly high with me
Fly with the wind
Fly with the wind of failure
Useless the life, where
Evil disguise
Covers the faces around
