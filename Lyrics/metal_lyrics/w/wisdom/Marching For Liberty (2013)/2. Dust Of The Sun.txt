On the wings of hope I walk carefully
Through the universe that belongs to me

When the stars are so bright, silence is heard
Then I disperse the power of life to the earth

Rays of light in the dark clouds of thunder
Wasting time that is always on the run
Ways of life and a whole world of wonder
All is me from above dust of the sun

Take a look around, feel the harmony
Everything that you see is made for me

When the sun is so bright, it shines through the rain
Then I gather the dust and I throw it away

You were born from dust of the sunshine
You will always be a part of me

Rays of light in the dark clouds of thunder
Wasting time that is always on the run
Ways of life and a whole world of wonder
All is me from above dust of the sunshine
