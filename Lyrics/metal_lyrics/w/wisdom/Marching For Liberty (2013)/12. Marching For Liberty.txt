Hope arrived with the winds of change
And it blows and nothing can stop it now
Those who were even more estranged
Get a chance to have a new start

Ad res novas parati, cum impetu audaci,
In pectore fideli colimus spem mundi novi

Oh, my dear followers, here comes the time
What we waited for so long has finally arrived
Oh, my dear warriors, God lead your way!
Altogether, are you ready for the long campaign?

Anything you say, we believe your words
Fire in our hearts and the flame still burns
In the flash of lightning, together we're fighting
For a better world
Whenever you call us, we shall be there
Tell us what to do, and we do our share
In the flash of lightning, together we're fighting
For a better world

Long years in sheltering arms of the dark
Now it's over, and the sun shines through the misty clouds
I taught you everything, all I have known
Got my eyes on you but now the time is up to go

Marching for the future, freedom for us all
All we want is peace and justice even if we fall
Marching for the future last chance to be free
We are stronger than we've ever been

When the rain falls to the ground,
Feeds the hungry earth
When the sun shines through the dark,
Lights a brave new world

In the land of tyranny
Where we are in chains
Master and his followers
Ride the winds of change

Marching for liberty, no more pain
Marching for liberty, no more hate
Marching for liberty, no more lies
Marching for liberty, no more cries

No more pain, no more hate
Join us and be the master of your fate
No more lies, no more cries
Fight with us even if you have to die

Hope arrived with the winds of change
And it blows and never will stop
