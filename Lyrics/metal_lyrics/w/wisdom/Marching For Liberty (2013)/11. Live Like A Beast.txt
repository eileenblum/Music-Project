What an evil man you are
Can't you see what is going on?
Lately you have gone too far
Now we are out of hope

We don't wanna fight
With the ghosts in your mind
Take you deep into a place like 
Hell for the rest of life

You're the man who never cares
Crazy madman against the rules
Pain remains if you were there
How can you be so cruel?

Your world is a lie
Full of greed, lust and pride
We will take you to a place like 
Hell for the rest of life

Live like a beast to the end of time
Darkness will eat you alive
Hide like a worm in a hole and wait
The end of days

Seven deadly sins and all
Dirty deeds in your dirty life
No one needs you anymore
Too many tears we cried

No, we don't wanna fight
With the ghosts in your mind
Take you deep into a place like 
Hell for the rest of life

Live like a beast in the deepest hell
No one will wait for you there
Hide like a worm in the darkest hole
Evil must fall
