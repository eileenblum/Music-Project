Walking alone empty feelin' in my heart
Where to go, my whole world is fallin' apart
For many years I've been livin' in a hole
Maybe I've been playin' a role?

I dream of better days oh I can't wait
Somebody take me away

Where the fairies live
Flies the white winged horse
Future has no meaning if you open up the doors
Where the mind is free
Enemies are friends
I'll be young forever if you take me to Neverland

Unholy pride it was hard to realize
I have been deceived by a fool's paradise
Grey everyday makes me angry to the core
Faces I can't see anymore

I'm getting older and
I am my only friend
I know I will be free
In Neverland
