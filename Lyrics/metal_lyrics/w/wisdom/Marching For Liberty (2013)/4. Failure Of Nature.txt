Look at his face, he is not a man
Some kind of monster ain't nobody's friend
Where is he from, do you know his name?
Failure of nature as the others say

Never had a chance to show his other side
This is what he feels inside

One more night in the bed of sorrow
One more day passing in despair
He must run far away tomorrow
From this nightmare

Hides in the dark in the underworld
Only a deaf dog listens to his word
What kind of god sent him to his fate?
There is no justice; he must bear the weight

Never had a chance to live a normal life
This is what he feels inside

Where can he find humanity?
Where is the charity?

He will never be once more in tears
