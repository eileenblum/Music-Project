Deep in the forest there is a place
Where you go, through dangerous ways
Fear in your eyes it's easy to see
Since you heard the prophecy

Don't believe, no one knows
What the future holds

Turn your face to the sun, feel it in your veins
Take in the might of the burning rays
Tell yourself you're a brave man, achieve your goal
Face up and do what is in your soul

Wiseman is callin' and if you dare
Go, your heart is leading you there
Follow the path of glory and pride
Be a martyr if you die

Never fear, no one knows
What the future holds

Time to meet your destiny (Destiny)
Never be afraid (Hail to the brave)
Time to meet your destiny (Destiny)
Hallowed be thy name (Hail to the brave)

In your soul
In your soul
In your brave soul
