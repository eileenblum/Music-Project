Frozen in a lonely night
When the moon is shining bright
I remember every hurt, oh how can I forget?
I recall my memories
And I find just pain and tears
Maybe I was born for sorrow in the arms of death?

Wake up my life
Please don't let me die
Give me a reason to believe and stay alive
Wake up my soul
Please don't let me go
Help me to find the fields of gold

How to tell you what I feel?
I can't overcome my fear
Many questions wander in my head when I am blue
Will you save me from myself,
Show the way out of this hell?
Time is running out, and I don't know what I can do

Day by day
Waiting for my fate
Save me, I hope you won't be late
