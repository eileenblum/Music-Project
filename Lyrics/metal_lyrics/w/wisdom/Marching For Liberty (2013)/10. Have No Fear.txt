Marching on the road across the emptiness
Marching on the road of misery
Marching on the road in silent loneliness
We are on the road to victory

To the battle we go together along the glorious way
Raging weather, it does not matter, it won't stop us anyway

Days are wandering by
And it seems we shall never arrive
Stormy winter is here
And it shows no mercy
Faith will keep us alive
But it seems we shall never arrive
Raging winter is here
But we have no fear

Cold wind blows away the empty promises
Snow day after day so cold embrace
Now we are the prey we're falling like the leaves
Old General Winter show your grace!
