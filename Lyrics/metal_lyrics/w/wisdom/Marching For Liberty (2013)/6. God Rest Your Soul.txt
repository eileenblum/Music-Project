All the time you are on the run
Suffering out of fear
Hunter eyes of a loaded gun
Seek you out and you feel

Cold embrace of death
You will never be back

Free forevermore
Let your own spirit soar
Find pleasure in Heaven and may
God rest your soul

What is wrong with the world today
Where you don't have a choice
Dog eat dog and you are the prey
But you can't have a voice

Never be afraid
Something better awaits
