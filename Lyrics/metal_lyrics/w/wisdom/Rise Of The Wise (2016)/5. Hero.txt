"Heroism is the brilliant triumph of the soul over the flesh that is to say over fear: fear of poverty, of suffering, of calumny, of illness, of loneliness and of death."
[HENRI FREDERIC AMIEL]

Battle cries in the deep of night
Burning fire and steel
There's a hero to win this fight
To defeat the enemy

Soldiers of destiny many dead and gone
Killed by the bravest one

Hero, creature of war
Glorious forevermore
Hero, king of the field
His name is feared

Early rays of the morning sun
Lights the large battlefield
Silence kills when the war is done
Many died or disappeared

Soldiers of victory celebrating and
Praising the bravest man

Hero, creature of war
Fearless and brave to the core
Hero, keeper of faith
No question he never fails

Hero, creature of war
Glorious forevermore
Hero, king of the field
His name is feared

Hail the hero
Praise the hero
