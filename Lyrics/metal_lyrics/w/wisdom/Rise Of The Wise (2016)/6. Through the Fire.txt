"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself."
[LEO TOLSTOY]

When you are in flames and close the door
Crawling back into your shell
You're just falling deeper more and more
Only you can help yourself

See the world in another way
Life is more than pain

Have you ever tried to make a change
Whenever you feel alone?
Now I think it's time to break your chains
Like I did it on my own

See the world in another way
Feel it in your vein
I believe and I know today
Life is more than pain

Through the fire I walk the line
Maybe one day I will arrive
Something inside tells me to go
Where the wild winds blow

Crazy little things could break my heart
And my life was so surreal
Then I didn't know myself but now
Everything is crystal clear

See the world in another way
Feel it in your vein
I believe and I know today
Life is more than pain

Through the fire I walk the line
Maybe one day I will arrive
Something inside tells me to go
Where the wild winds blow

Road to nowhere I'm on my way
Feeling higher day after day
I will never, never return
Let the fire burn

I don't know what waits for me
Where the wild winds blow
I just know that I will be
In a place where I belong
