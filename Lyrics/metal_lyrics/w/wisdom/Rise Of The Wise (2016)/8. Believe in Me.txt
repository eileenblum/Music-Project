"Never do anything when you are in a temper, for you will do everything wrong."
[BALTASAR GRACIAN]

Outside the window, I see the moon
Gives little silver light in the gloom
No breath of wind, no rise in the ground
Only my thoughts are whirling around

Morning will find me awake
Oh it's always the same
Something must change or I'll go insane

Still many times I lose control
I am just like the man I don't wanna be
Give me a final chance, one more
You can trust and believe in me

Face in the mirror, seems like he cries
I look into his desperate eyes
Try to deny what sanity tells
Whether it's me or somebody else?

Morning has found me awake
Oh it's always the same
There must be change or I'll go insane

Trust and believe in me
