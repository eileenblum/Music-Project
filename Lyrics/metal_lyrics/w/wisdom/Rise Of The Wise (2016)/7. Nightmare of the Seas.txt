"Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you."
[EDWARD TEACH]

Far in the island I was born
Deep in the wildest thunderstorm
Mother who cared and covered me
Was the wide eternal sea

Father, the wind has cold embrace
I let his fingers guide my sails
Where there is something to be done
He will never let me down

All in my hand
Fortune and fame
Born to command
All people fear my name

Because
I'm the king of piracy, the nightmare of the seas
Sailing through the stormy waters for a thousand years
Never give a chance to enemies, I've learned it all before
Nightmare of the seas I ride the storm

Sailin' against the wind and fight
Ridin' the waves all day and night
Livin' among my loyal crew
This is like a dream come true
