"The werewolves are certain sorcerers, who having anointed their bodies, with an ointment which they make by the instinct of the devil; and putting on a certain enchanted girdle, do not only unto the view of others seem as wolves, but to their own thinking have both the shape and the nature of wolves, so long as they wear the said girdle; and they do dispose themselves as very wolves in worrying and killing, and eating most of human creatures."
[RICHARD VERSTEGAN]

When the full moon lights the sky
Time is right for mastery
Sharpened claws and mystic eyes
That's the werewolves' destiny

Ancient fever in my bones
Long ago my fate was done
When the sun goes down I feel
Yes I know my time has come

Hunting the night, out in the wild
You will be my sacrifice
Hunting the night, out in the wild
Your blood keeps me alive

When I turn into the beast
Hunger is my enemy
Every prey is like a feast
That's the werewolves' destiny

Sense of guilt in human shape
This is how it has to be
No one sleeps when I'm awake
That's the werewolves' destiny
