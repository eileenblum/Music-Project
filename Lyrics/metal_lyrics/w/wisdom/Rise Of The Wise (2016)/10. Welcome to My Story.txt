"The artist is nothing without the gift, but the gift is nothing without work."
[ÃMILE ZOLA]

You want me to create something
I will make it, I won't rest
So you want me to spread my wings
I will do my best
You want me to follow your way
I will try it, keep in touch
So you want me to work all day
Don't you want too much?

Everything I do I always do it from my heart
But I never liked to make it hard
Welcome to my story

Waiting just waiting for honour and glory
No more I can do let me say I'm sorry
Hoping just hoping that fame will come for me
That's all I can do, welcome to my story

You want me to improve my life
I will make it, I won't rest
So you want me to use my mind
I will do my best
You want me to follow your word
I will try it, keep in touch
So you want me to join your world
Don't you want too much?

Sometimes I feel like I'm inside the storm
Maybe I'll raise high or sink like a stone

Welcome to my story
Welcome to my story
