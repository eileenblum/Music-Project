"When faith is lost, when honor dies, the man is dead."
[JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER]

The rain falls down on my face
The rain falls I've been losing my faith
The rain falls still nobody cares
Just empty promises, nothing else

Where should I go, oh what can I do?
I want to know just like you

I wonder how frail I am
Remember how I was a blind man
Pretender, no I'm not a fake
My feelings poison me like a snake

I stand for a while, realize why I live
My heart is alive, I want to believe
Now I let the rain wash away all my pain
My heart is alive and I will find my way
