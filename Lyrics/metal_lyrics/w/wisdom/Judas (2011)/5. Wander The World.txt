[Music: G. Kovacs, Lyrics: M. Molnar]

"Wandering re-establishes the original harmony which once existed between man and the universe."
/ANATOLE FRANCE/

Walking the lonely road 
On the way I've never known 
Close to a dark forest 
Cool wind takes me down to rest 

Under the open sky 
Facing the stars 

Careless and easy life 
I don't want to leave behind 
And as I fall asleep 
Pray the Lord my soul to keep 

Rays of the morning sun 
Chasing the dark 
Wake me and warm me up 
In my heart 

Wander the world, come and go 
Sometimes it feels like so long ago 
Wander the world, come and go 
Leaving my way to the Lord 

Walking the lonely road 
Places I have never known 
Slowly across the fields 
Through the valleys and the hills 

Maybe a day when I 
Get to the end 
I'll have to take my life 
In my hand 

Wander the world, come and go 
Sometimes it feels like so long ago 
Wander the world, come and go 
Leaving my way to the Lord
