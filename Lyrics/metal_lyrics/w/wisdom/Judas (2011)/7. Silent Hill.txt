[Music: M. Molnar, Lyrics: M. Molnar]

"Where there is mystery, it is generally suspected there must also be evil."
/LORD BYRON/

You are alone holding a candle 
This night is long, lasts forever 
And if you are screaming for someone 
Nobody's there, you're the last one 

Here inside 

Welcome to the nightmare of Silent Hill 
Life is more than fantasy 
Better look around when the night is near 
Something evil's here 

Lost in the night, the powers of darkness 
Eat you alive don't be mindless 
You never know what is behind you 
Run for your life, no more time to 

Waste and cry 

Time is still down in Silent Hill 
Silence kills, something evil's here 

Welcome to the nightmare of Silent Hill 
Life is more than fantasy 
Never be alone when the night is near 
Something evil is here
