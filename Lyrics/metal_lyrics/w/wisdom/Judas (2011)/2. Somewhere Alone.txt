[Music: G. Kovacs, Lyrics: M. Molnar]

"Look around you, remember that you are mortal."
/TERTULLIANUS/

Long before I came into this world 
All have heard the fortune-teller's word 
Of a lone man in the prophecy 
He was me, the Man of Destiny 

When I look around it's a no man's land 
Blood is everywhere, I stand 

Somewhere alone far from my home 
God from the high heavens saved my soul 
Somewhere alone down to the bone 
Hardly alive anymore 

Bodies lying all over the ground 
Mothers crying, death is all around 
I am just a puppet on a string 
Fighting for the power of a king 

I don't wanna fight to the end of time 
Obey like a fool and die

Maybe I was born to kill 
Cause misery and death 
Maybe I was made to be 
Part of a master plan
