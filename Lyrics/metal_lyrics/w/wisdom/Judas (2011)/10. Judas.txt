[Music: G. Kovacs, Lyrics: M. Molnar]

"Sin goes in a disguise, and thence is welcome; like Judas, it kisses and kills; like Joab, it salutes and slays"
/GEORGE SWINNOCK/

Night is falling, the sun goes down 
Fireflies awake 
In the darkness of the forest 
We are together again

Night is falling, the sun goes down 

Fireflies awake 
In the darkness of the forest 
We are together again 

Far away in a secret place 
For the chosen ones 
Where the wise man shows the right and 
True way of living for us 

Judas, a liar, a king for a day 
He's gonna give us away 
Judas, a liar, a rose with a thorn 
He's not the same anymore 

There is a time when you need to decide 
Have to be strong and need to be wise 
A deal with the devil will lead you to Hell 
Fire of fear awaits you there 

Fire lights up the faces now 
By the torches' flame 
Ghostly cries are heard, his eyes are 
Burning with demonic rage 

He's a man with a darkened soul 
Hunting for his prey 
In the night-time at the right time 

He's gonna take one away

Demons and shades of the night 
Thy wish is my command 
Evil in me never dies 
I have no choice 

I can't find the way 
Out of the storm 
I can't break the chains 
In my heart of stone 

No more words to say 
Damage is done 
We were all the same 
But those days are gone 

Judas, a liar, a king for a day 
I'm just a man not a saint 
Judas, a liar, a rose with a thorn 
Why don't you leave me alone? 

Judas
