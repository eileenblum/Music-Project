[Music: G. Kovacs, Lyrics: M. Molnar]

"A man should never be ashamed to own that he has been in the wrong, which is but saying... that he is wiser today than yesterday."
/JONATHAN SWIFT/

Hard to find my way 
And the days go by 
Many years were wasted 
I can't turn back the time 

Voices in my head 
Make me feel so low 
Lately I've been thinking 
More about my home 

No more aimless wandering 
No more lazing around 

Everything I had 
I have thrown away 
Oh my God, have mercy 
Can't you feel my pain? 

Now I understand 
All the things you told 
Father, please forgive me 
I am coming home 

No more aimless wondering 
Let me lay in your arms 

Take me back into your heart 
Open your heart 

Open your heart
