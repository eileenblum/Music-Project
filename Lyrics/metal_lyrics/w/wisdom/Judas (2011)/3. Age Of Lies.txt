[Music: G. Kovacs, Lyrics: M. Molnar]

"We must be the change we wish to see in the world."
/GANDHI/

A thousand heavy years ago 
When the cross led the crown 
Thousands had to fear the law 
And the spies all around 

Holy wars, glory calls 
In the name of the Lord 
No remorse, no recourse 
In the eye of the law 

Age of lies, will the sun ever rise? 
Show the way into the light 
Age of lies, will you open your eyes? 
Inquisition's still alive 

Nowadays in the world of fools 
Everything is the same 
Right way is against the rules 
Human greed is to blame 

Age of lies, will the sun ever rise? 
Show the way into the light 
Age of lies, will you open your eyes? 
Inquisition's still alive 

Rays of sunrise 
New age, new life 
Rays of sunrise 
Here we are
