[Music: G. Kovacs, Lyrics: M. Molnar]

"Who has a harder fight than he who is striving to overcome himself."
/THOMAS A KEMPIS/

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child 
I hate to live my powerless life 
Sometimes I fear every toll of the bell 
I am between Heaven and Hell 

Some other times I am so high 
Just like an eagle high in the sky 
Joy in my soul and I have more 
Pleasure than I had ever before 

And when the angel is not on my side 
I wish my anger out of my mind 
Another day is another in Hell 
This is my fate trouble and care 

I wanna live, throw it away 
I wanna be somebody again 
Let my life go, I need to know 
Nothing is easy, nothing at all 

Time has come to rule my life 
Find some peace of mind 

Heaven and Hell, trouble and care 
Dark and dreamless nights 
Trouble and care, Heaven and Hell 
Time to say goodbye 

Heaven and Hell
