"All of our unhappiness comes from our inability to be alone"
[BRUYÃRE]

I'm full of so many thoughts
Poisoned emotions of those
Glorious days and the pain
Leads me to go insane

I raise my eyes to the sky
Slowly as time is passing by
Try to look deep in my soul
To understand it all

Time will change, change us all
Through this human age

We can all lie all alone, hide
Maybe we need some days
We can all lie all alone, hide
Time is gonna heal our pains

I wipe the tears from my eyes
I'll find the strength to arise
Please really don't get me wrong
Leave me to be alone
