Hey, you are the king! Take care of our souls
Hey, you ought to see the returning of foes

Once for all, destroy them all!
I know what to do I'm here!
Time for war, fight to the core!
I'll lead you to victory!

You ought to behold the glory you hope
Lies at your feet again
Look death in the face - it's a glorious day
The day of your fame

Hey, you are the king! Take us by your hand
Hey, you ought to be the commander again

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Raise your sword to the course of the future
Lightning goes through the sky
You will know what to do with the power
In the course of time

[Chorus]
