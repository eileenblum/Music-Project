Still many times, I can't recognise
Those who wear evil disguise
Once in a while, they give me a sign
Hits like a bolt from the sky

Watchin' those eyes glowing false
Feelin' the untruth so close
Over and over again
It's sucking my power away

Masquerade

Facing someone, look deep in his eyes
Seems like he tells only lies
So far I thought him best friend of mine
He's like the Father of Lies

[Bridge]

Masquerade
Masquerade

Beware of all the ravening wolves
Sheep's clothing covers their face
Give you a show and have no remorse
Beware of their charming ways

[Bridge]

Masquerade
Masquerade
