No one knows why I'm afraid
Why I feel so bad
Oh, I see our destiny
It makes me feel so sad

Unholy Ghost takes away our hopes
I don't want to fall on evil days anymore
Never again, misery and fall
Is it just a dream that I am waiting for?

Oh, my dreams will realize
All the hopes I have
I won't rest, will stand my ground
Until I reach my end

[Chorus]
