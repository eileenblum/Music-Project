God only knows, they don't leave you alone
All those nightmarish dreams in your head
God speed you boy, if you're leaving your home
Find yourself in this world, be yourself

Wherever you are and he comes to your mind
Just remember the words that he said
"Never say die, got to make up your mind
Be the master of your life 'n death"
