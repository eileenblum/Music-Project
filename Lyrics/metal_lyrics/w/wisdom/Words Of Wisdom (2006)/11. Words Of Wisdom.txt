All of the sins, every useless lie
That we commit keep the evil alive
But we always say there's another way
Never too late, make a change!

See every day empty people are in tears
See every day as they're fallin' into misery
Scream every day "People, what the hell is here?"
Scream every day, but your words give rise to agony

Oaths, too many oaths
Promises we broke
Sins that make us guilty too many times

Never too late, read it today
If you want to change your life, it
Shows you the right way
Never too late, make it today
Words of Wisdom every time will
Show you the right way

See every day they don't practise what they preach
See every day all around the rising heresy
Scream every day "People, what the hell is here"
Scream every day, but your words give rise to anarchy

Yes, you are the same
We are all the same
Words of Wisdom lead me, show me the way

[Chorus]

Why are we here
In this vale of tears
How can we find what we need?

[Chorus]

All of the sins, every useless lie
That we commit keep the evil alive
But we always say there's another way
Never too late, make a change!
