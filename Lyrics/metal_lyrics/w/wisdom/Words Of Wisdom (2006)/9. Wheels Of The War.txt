Although you walk alone
Feel the war inside
Like the pain of holy thunder
Hurts every time

Over the fields you go
Feel it even now
Hear the gunshot, smell the carnage
Why close your eyes

Look to the future pray for all
Pray, the Lord's gonna hear you
Look to the time when winds o'war
Don't blow in the sky

Wheels of the war crash all the more
Yeah, you see men killed by force
Wheels of the war crash all the more
Yeah, you hear them cry

You're hearing screams behind
Never-ending calls
Ghostly voices keep you under
Their grasping hold

Road to Eternity
Calling you away
Like the sirens holy voice, but
Hey, you must wait

[Bridge]

Wheels of the war crash all the more
Yeah, you see men killed by force
Wheels of the war crash all the more
Yeah, you hear them cry
Wheels of the war crash all the more
Yeah, you feel their life is false
Wheels of the war crash all the more
Oh, you watch them die
