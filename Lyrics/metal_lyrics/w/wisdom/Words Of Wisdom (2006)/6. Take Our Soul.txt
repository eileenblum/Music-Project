Through the Valley of the Kings
Over the bloody rocks
Through the calm eternity
Hearts full of empty hopes

Please lead my Lord
We're searching for our only home
Please lead my Lord, there's nowhere to go

Take our soul

Raise a hue and cry against
All of our enemies
Let the people live again
And be with their families

Please lead my Lord
And give us a chance to behold
Please lead my Lord, there's nowhere to go

Take our soul

[Bridge I]

Take our soul
