Here where the rain falls
Into the seas
Here where the rainbow
Shines over the trees

Daylight blinds me when I'm
Getting used to the dark
Day by day, when I fall and I rise
I see the world through your eyes

Later these raindrops
Drift for a while
And then again go
Back up to the sky

Twilight blinds me when I'm
Getting used to the light
If you die, then I'll go for a while
Leave your body behind

How many years I have lived
Like a holy vagabond
What kind of life will the future bring me?
How many times I had to feel
That I won't be anymore
Nobody knows my forever wandering soul

Mind that this cycle is
Eager to live
Goes on forever
As long as you believe

Daylight blinds me when I'm
Getting used to the dark
Who'll need me and receive me when I'm
Back again to arise

[Chorus]
