Every day I see you're strolling through the streets
Got no aim and you have lost your faith to believe

I want you to hear the same
How sweet the music sounds
I want you to feel the same
Like me, when it starts

Oh, let your soul show you the way
We want more
Wisdom metal is the law we're dying for
Let your heart show you the way
We want more
Wisdom metal is the law!

Trust in me, our show is always true as steel
Time has come to realize that at last we are here

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Everyday I see you strolling through the streets
Take my hands; let's go together fulfil the dreams

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
