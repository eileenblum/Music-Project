These arenât the good moments, when the life is on my back again
So much hatred dwells within us all
I wonât let you â crush, remodel, kill, you mean nothing â donât deceive yourself!
Go away! - I can't stand your verbal torments,  let it go, don't hurt me more
Before you will do something stupid think of how youâre hurting me
When you stab your knife into my heart
The hatred â your words are  entwining my mind, catching in a spiderâs web
Happy now? Today for me you  mean nothing, I could kill you, are you scared?

So much hatred in my heart, the venom's spilling now
Pain's devouring blinded senses, ough!
How much trouble one can handle I am learning now
vanishing behind the veil of pain

Itâs long since I have stopped to listen to the demons in my head
What to do, what to say, how to live
I wonât let you â crush, destroy,  rape, remodel, kill, deceive, I  know I wonât
Every word â 's killing me, and pain is festering my heart,  I won't give up!
I was supposed to leave you but youâve caught me in your web again
The psycho war is rolling on
Stop vexing me â you are pouring venom in my sick ears just to badger me
Hell with you â I am leaving, wonât come back, Iâd rather die, delusions stop!!

So much hatred in my heart, the venom spilling now
Pain devouring blinded senses, ough!
How much trouble one can handle I am learning now
vanishing behind the veil of pain

Enough, enough, eeee-nough!
