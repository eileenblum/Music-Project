Tears in my eyes, the pain of past time
This place is driving me mad
And they laugh, always laugh

Get up, you aren't sick at all
Don't tell me it hurts
I decide who's healthy in this house
Stop kidding, get dressed

You've been naughty - nothing to eat
It's forbidden to beat
He has only burned your parents' shot
You will forget them, no matter what

A child from here
Is shame and fear

Now I have my home and a reason to live
But I'm "a child from here"
I'm coming back in all my dreams

Orphanage is my home
This complex is my pain
I'm trying to break free
But still I hear the voice
