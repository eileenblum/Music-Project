Power corrupts, it is strong like a drug
Every day you take bigger doses
Clergy loves it, knows your weak spots,
It is God's right to profit from them - you will pay
Your conscience is dirty and sinful again,
The priests are nagging and nagging
Nothing's allowed, all you do is sin
So pay your dues and you'll be O.K.

Black n' whites hold power over souls
Politicians working for their goals
They're stuffing you with their old crap
You have fallen into their black trap

At school, radio and TV venerable priests
Have been constantly washing your brains
Watch for wonders, work, pray every day,
Thought is sin, so don't think, don't think - go to church!

God have mercy upon them, make them humble,
Give them brains and some manners
You're not in their hearts, they scare us with Your wrath,
They claim they were chosen by You - is that right?

Wanna have respect in my small paradise,
So become a priest in this hive
Workers and drones their everyday toil
Will put you on your tray and you'll have it all
