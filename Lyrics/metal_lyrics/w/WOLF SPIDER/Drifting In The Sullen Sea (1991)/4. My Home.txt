To live at this place you must be abnormal
It's land of pathetic fools
There's lots of mystics and pathetic clowns
My home has no stable rules

Dirty kids are playing with bottles
From their old man's cheapest booze
They must drink with him when he wants it
When they don't then all hell breaks loose

That's my home, that's my world
Stink and trash, bitter taste
I'm a victim of the gang rape
They chased my mother, she couldn't flee

Can you tell me why I was born?
What is the aim of my life?
She could abort me but she was afraid
My future would never count

Just to give birth is no big deal
That's what they once did to me
This house is a boat full of suffering
Drifting in the sullen sea
