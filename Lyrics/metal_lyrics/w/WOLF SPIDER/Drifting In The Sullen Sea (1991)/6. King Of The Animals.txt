There's rush in our forest, heat in every den
We will choose the king tomorrow, the best that we can
Dreaming's a good idea but it's too trivial so
Animals try again to choose the lesser evil

How long is it going to take?
Who will sometimes give us a break?
All the claimants fighting again
Now they promise, lie as they can

You wanna sit on the throne? - it is easy!
You don't really need to be wise
Do like he did, lots of howling
Lots of sweet words for the crowd
He is the king og animals

Worse and worse in our forest, heat in dens again
King who promised paradise is getting rich himself
It's a tradition here to give the rule to scum
And then to hate them madly for all that they have done

He's so strong and that's what we need
Shout like me if you want a career
Don't protest for you have no chance
King's already started his plans!

In this forest king howls a lot
Gives sweet slogans to the happy crowd
He is the king of animals
