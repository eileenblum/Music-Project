Sullen faces passing me
Nothing can make them smile
Time has broken the thread of hope
They're striving to live their life

Examine this sick mechanism
Who's who? What's the game?
The constant stress is blocking the brain
Wiping out your face

Look! It's a wreck, nothing but a wreck now
You must live - tell me how!

The frustrated mob crowds my paradise
Willy nilly, I'm sinking as well, drifting in the sullen sea

You wanna know what's the taste of life
Come and have a look at my paradise
I'll give you my dough to live on for a month
You will try the taste of our life

Yes, it's a face, boorish Poland's face
Its kitsch is dressed up as style
Myth of our mission that may save the world
Should not stand this last test

I wanna  break free from this trap
Suck out the poison for good
Impotence is clipping my wings
Pouring salt on my wounds

Yes, the death has wrecked all your birthday plans
Your future has lost its sense, lost its sense

The frustrated mob crowds my paradise
Willy nilly, I'm sinking as well, drifting in the sullen sea
