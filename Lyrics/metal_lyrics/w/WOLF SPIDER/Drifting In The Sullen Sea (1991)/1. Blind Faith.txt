With just one word "shit" you're calling the world
Your own life you're calling the same
You hated your school for its boredom and fear
You preferred your friends, a match and beer

You're a fan
You're a fan

The stadium has shaped you, taught you to drink and swear
To quench emotions with aggression
You should give it all your thanks every day
Now you're good enough to have your own Heysel
You're a fan

You're strong in the crowd
When you yell out loud
There you can feel safe
A part of the wave

Dirty stream of scum is flooding my town
Brainless morons playing everywhere
Everything around is slowly falling down
To resist them no one would now dare

You're a fan
You're a fan

They're chauvinists who kill you for their club
Anarchy allows them to act
There are more and more hooligans around
Soccer stadiums are their playing grounds

They're fans
They're fans

Down the drain every day
Drinking beer all in vain
That's the life that you want
To like you? No, I don't!

It's a spark of war, it's an evil source
Always dreaming to conquer the world
This is fanatism, kills humans in us
So prevent it quickly if you can

Fanatism
Fanatism
