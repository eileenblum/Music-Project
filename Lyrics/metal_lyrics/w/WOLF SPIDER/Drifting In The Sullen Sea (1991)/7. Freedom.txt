Your head is burning, a new potent gift flows in your blood
Gift of oblivion, all this world of yours is struck by flood

Freedom does not go along with drugs
Only morons don't believe it
It's deadly shit, lethal crack
You'll be dead soon if you need it

Look at these people, always roaming to find some warm nook
This is their heaven, the narcotic madness of their look

What's the price they'll pay for this
For those blissful gorgeous visions
Death has put his money into them
On the most compelling reasons

Always looking for new feelings, sinking deeper down
Human weakness has its triumph, and now you're out

Your will can save you, so don't break it with the first big shot
Go straight ahead, otherwise your mind is gonna rot

Drugs will never free you from the stress
Only morons don't believe it
You don't know what hunger really means
Crack's no good fun, so you should leave it

Always looking for new feelings, sinking deeper down
Human weakness has its triumph, and now you're out

Freedom - but you have it now all wrong
This is freedom - just listen to this song
This is freedom - but it doesn't care for you
This is freedom - it's your freedom

Freedom - but you have it now all wrong
This is freedom - just listen to this song
This is freedom - but it doesn't care for you
This is freedom - it's your freedom
