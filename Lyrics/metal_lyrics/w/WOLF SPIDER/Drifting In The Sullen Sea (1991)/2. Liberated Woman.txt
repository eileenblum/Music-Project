You are scribbbling trash, just wasting your time
You'd better do some business and make some more dough
All those books of yours are only catching dust
I'm fed up with you, this day is my last!

You're telling me you're honest, full of self-respect
Nonsense! That's all rubbish, one day you'll regret
These children and this home! Oh, I'm bored to death!
I'm still young and pretty, enough with this mess!

All day long
I'm listening to this crap
Feeding my money-box - this is my woman!

I swear and curse this hour when I went to a bar
Just to have a few drinks and there I saw my star
Really it was a moment, we chatted for a while
We made it in a bathtub and now I don't know why!

My dear little daughter, your mother is so bad
She only cares for money, she's acting just like mad
Money ruins love, and love has ruined me
Remember this, my girl, if not, you will see!

One cannot all day long
Just listen to this crap
I'm leaving now for good - tell her that!
