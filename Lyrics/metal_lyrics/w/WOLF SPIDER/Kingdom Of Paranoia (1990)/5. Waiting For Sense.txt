I don't know what's wrong and what's right
but I think I'm not alone
sick education made a fool of me
just like all of us

rock 'n' roll, sex and a great world
we were not to learn about
packs of lies and ficticious truths
made a pulp of our minds

that's not it, stilted ease
imagination's gone
that's not it, we need more hues
it's still in bad taste

will anyone cure this disease
take the lead, wipe out dirty flipper myth
who'll cure our home and work and dreams
forbidden to laugh through tears

cleaning woman takes the boss's place
black turns out to be white
cats and dogs eat from one pot
what you've got off it you'll know

the King is turning into a fool
very quickly changing views
this is our crazy paranoia
little changes, much ado

that's not it, stilted ease
imagination's gone
that's not it, we need more hues
it's still in bad taste

will anyone cure this disease
take the lead, wipe out dirty flippers myth
who'll cure our home and work and dreams
forbidden to laugh through tears
will anyone cure this disease
take the lead, wipe out dirty flippers myth
who'll cure our home and work and dreams
forbidden to laugh through tears
