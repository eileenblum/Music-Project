you must know that, it's the same fight everyday
you must live, selling your youth for dough

the place's not lovely yet
the world says it is
stupid VIP's
try to meddle with the rules

look! A bird's flying in the sky
so free and so proud
try to bear it like it does
to pass over that

the dirty mob shows off its stupidity
without booze you can'ty do anything

though it's not lovely yet
don't stay aloof
until the mighty fools
try to meddle with the rules

look! A bird's flying in the sky
so free and so proud
try to bear it like it does
to pass over that

look! A bird's flying in the sky
so free and so proud
try to bear it like it does
to pass over that

live and survive
live and survive
