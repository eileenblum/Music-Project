drink - it is a feast day, the old system has just failed
don't think - there is nothing about, so drink at last
we'll really make them see who's who
now it's time to claim property, cross out the past

revolution - we want freedom, we want rights
revolution - no one will rule us again
people want to rule

hey you man - don't you find it nice?
you shake your head, don't expose yourself
hey you man - you think you can scoff at us?
come n boys we can bash their mugs

stop - we're not being followed but we've made a little cash
look - people seem happy when we're hacking them so hard
we can do just all we want, don't be afraid
no one will hurt us for that, don't bother about (it)

yes - freedom is not for stupid savages, the vicious mob
fist - it is not an argument which fascinates the world
you're not reliable in it's eyes
you're able to just steal and drink and fuck

revolution - favour clever, others wreck
revolution - let us lead a normal life
wash out the marks of shame
