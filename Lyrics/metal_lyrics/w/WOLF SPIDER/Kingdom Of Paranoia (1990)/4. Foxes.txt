foxes - live with us
mask - a stilled face

artfully deceiving you
and you believe in all that rubbish
you'll give them what they want
unaware feeding the evil

foxes - live on us
on the stupid fools

strives for your special favours
ruins you behind your back
it's a dodgers's game
to steal and sell what they can

credulity makes us lost
throw it out of your houses
don't believe anybody

nowaday's such a time
that falsehood gets applause

this living's easily earnt
changes mind, vexes you
profit is your aim
you go ahead over dead bodies

foxes - hate their dens
shame-faced of their homes

nothing is in a position
to cover boorish manners
disguise the blanket's dirt
brainwashed is all they've got
