walking virtue models
it's humanity's end
your irresistable charm
longs for the splendour, fame
power, control

with hand suppressed, your lust
aches for a new allure
so many of you
rank up with god

father from stars, your servants serve you so poor
there are many traitors greedy for dough
father from stars, they don't treat you with respect
ir isn't good to follow your footsteps anymore

black 'n'  whites must be converted
black 'n'  whites must be converted
