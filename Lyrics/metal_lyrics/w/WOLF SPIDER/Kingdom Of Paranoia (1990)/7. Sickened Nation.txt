grow in numbers, I can hardly understand it
what a shame, stinking bodies laying close to us
depots dirt is all they have got in their life
stinking numbers, may somebody cure them, it's high time
cure them, it's high time
cure them, it's high time
cure them, it's high time
we've never been told about the poverty
which came from those who lost their homes

vegetation
sickened nation

let's do something, let's catch 'em
it's time to wash 'em, teach 'em to live

just be strong, don't fall into schizophrenia
don't let them rot, they are human although they are mad
now it's time to stop the degredation
you must try to give your hand to those who need your help
who need your help
who need your help
who need your help
lack of feelings has made us insensitive
let us change itm see it by yourself

vegetation
sickened nation
vegetation
sickened nation

let's do something, let's catch 'em
it's time to wash 'em, teach 'em to live

schnorrer - like a rat - it's sickening
eating all the crap, spreading pests

homely stench, clothes like a new fly-paper
you can find 'em in the depots, parks and back streets
i detest the awful spots
mercy stifles rage

that's enough
