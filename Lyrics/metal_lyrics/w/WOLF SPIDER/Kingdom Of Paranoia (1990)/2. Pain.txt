where am I to go
don't know - anywhere
just forget about it, close the door behind me
maybe it's a bad dream
it wrecks me
they were so beautiful, I loved them dearly

why did it happen just to them
I'd rather die than stay alone
I've got a hazy recollection
of crashing cars and my daughter's blood

acrimony is
penetrating me
'cause the guilty are
unpunished still

it was a lovely night
we enjoyed the time
we were laughing loudly coming back in the rain
he crashed into us
no chances
dreadful tragedy, smash

you live 'cause the Devil doesn't take evil
your status brought the judges 'round
I wonder if you've got a conscience
tell me! Why did you ruin my home?

acrimony is
penetrating me
'cause the guilty are
unpunished still
acrimony is
penetrating me
'cause the guilty are
unpunished still
