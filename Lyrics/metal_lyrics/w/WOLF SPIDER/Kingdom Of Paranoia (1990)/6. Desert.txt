It's a good idea to enjoy oneself
wait, who's got dough, I know, let's go
it's so boring when there's no money
it makes me down and out
at last I will eat
stop here, we hit the place

Hi buddy? There's business to talk
you know what's up, you were a musician too
lend me some cash, I like my chops
after a gig you can have it back

always can
just a thrash

I love it
it's hard to pass out logs
at least I wish
I have something to live on
to anchor onto something
have something to live on
to anchor onto something

now hit the stage
where the fools rule
it's not your style
to live from day to day
you let me down
i thought it was a dream
it's the same story
i know it too well

you're not the first who is leaving me
get out of here, please don't cry
it is not as on TV
I will not make you a star

how to compose!
how to compose!
how to compose!

have something to live on
to anchor onto something
have something to live on
to anchor onto something
