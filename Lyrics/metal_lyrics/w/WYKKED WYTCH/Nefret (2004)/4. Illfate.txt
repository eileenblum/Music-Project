Looking At The Mirror Who Do I See
Dark Circles Around My Eyes
Desperate Woman
Is This Who You Wanna Be

Is It Something I Said
Why Blame Anyone
Maybe It Is Your Illfate
It Is Your Illfate
Maybe It Is Your Illfate
It Is Your Illfate

I Can Shout, I Can Strike
I'm Your Double Vision
You Always Fear Me
Future Looks Blurry
Faith Taking A Toll On Me
Take A Look, Take A Look
Final Twist You Will See

This Life Is Not For Me
I'm Sick And Tired
Sick Of Your Conception
I Will Shout, I Will Strike
This life Is Not For Me
Can't Live It No More
Sick Of Breathing
Better Off Dead
Better Off Dead
Better Off Dead
Might As Well Be Dead

I Can Shout, I Can Strike
I'm Your Double Vision
You Always Fear Me
Future Looks Blurry
Faith Taking A Toll On Me
Take A Look, Take A Look
Final Twist You Will See
