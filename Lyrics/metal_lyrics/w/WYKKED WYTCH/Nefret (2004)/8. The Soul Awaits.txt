I Send This False Being To Search My Entity
Soul I Have Not Seen Awaits For Me

Soul Awaits Soul Awaits Soul Awaits

Emptiness I've Felt Disables Me
Is There Meaning To This Senseless Fight
Self Destruction Keeps Feeding Me
Soul Was Never Born But It Waits For Me

Efforts Not Enough, Not Affective
Failure Will Join, Destroy Our Energy
We Are Ill With Sickness, With No Remedy

Soul Awaits Soul Awaits

I Don't Have A Soul They Shout At Me
My Mind In Ruins Lures Me To Defeat
I Don't Have Shame I Don't Give A Damn
I Have No Guilt Takes Me To My Beliefs

Nother Time Soul Awaits
Nother Time Soul Awaits

I Don't Have A Soul But They Shout At Me
My Mind In Ruins Lures Me To Defeat
I Don't Have Shame I Don't Give A Damn
I Have No Guilt Makes Me Relieved

I Don't Have A Soul But They Shout AT Me
My Mind In Ruins Lures Me To Defeat
I Don't Have Shame I Don't Give A Damn
I Have No Guilt Makes Me To Believe

Nother Time Soul Awaits
Nother Time Soul Awaits

I'm In Battle With My Conscious
I See No Escape Maybe I Am Dead
I Just Didn't Know But I Have Hate Instead

Hate Is What I Have
What Does My Soul Await
Let It Wait Let It Wait
Soul Awaits
