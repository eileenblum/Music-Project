What lies Beneath, Shadow Of The Doubt
We Are The Nation, Misguided Children
Bribery Is Their Only Sources
To Keep Me Alive
Others Ignore My Existence
Cause I Have Fatal Intentions
There Are Times I'm Anxious
Other Times I Care Less
Love Always Disgusts Me
I Have Hate Instead
I Saw This Sick Child
Violent And Vicious
I Had No Vision

No One No One
No One No One

I Was That Sick Child
But I Wasn't Aware
Yet Diminutive Timid
Was So Tender
But Never Knew That I Had Fatal Intentions
Cause I Had Fatal Intentions

Didn't You Know The Facts
Friends And Foes They Are All The Same
There's No One To Blame
It's Your Name Ties You To The Crime
Cause I Have Fatal Intentions

No One Stood By Me No One Knew Anyway
I'm Not Pure Innocent As I Use To Be
No One Stood By Me No One Knew Anyway
I'm Not Pure Innocent As I Use To Be

Being Naive Led Me To Believe
Life Was Simple And Sweet
Demonic Voices Awakened Me
To See The Sides Of Me That I've Never Seen
Intentions Fatal Intentions Sick Intentions

There Are Times I'm Anxious Other Times I Care Less
Love Always Disgusts Me I Have Hate Instead
There Are Times I'm Anxious Other Times I Care Less
Love Always Disgusts Me I Have Hate Instead

No One Knew Who I Was No One Cared Anyway
I'm Not So Innocent As I Use To Be
