Is This The Face, You Despise To Hate
My Desperation Pulling Me To The End
It's Final, It's Near, lt's Too Late

Despair I Felt For Years
Today Is A Good Day To Fade
Could I Scrape The Wounds
Inflicted Upon Me,
Should I Cease The Voices
Screaming To My Ears
Is There Anyone, Can Hear My Screams
As The Night Falls Paranoia I'm Paralyzed
The Beast Brings Out Worst Of Me This Is Not Real
I Was Destined To Face My Fear

Voices I Hear Coming For You And Me
This Is What I Really Wished For, Who Cares

As The Night Falls Paranoia Surrounds Me,
Is This Really What You Wished For, Who Cares

How Would I End The Pain
I'm In Despair Pool Of Tears
Fear Consumes Loss Of My Years
These Are The Words
Could I Scrape The Wounds Inflicted Upon Me
This Is Why I Really Wished For Who Cares

How Would I End The Pain
I'm In Despair Pool Of Tears
Fear Consumes Loss Of My Years
These Are The Words I Always Fear

Voices Are Calling My Name I Must Go This Way
Minute Closer, Lasting Memories
No More Sorrow, Tears, Don't Cry For Me

Demon Stole My Mind
Blocking My Sanity
No One Came To Rescue Me
Fatal End Of Reality
I Was Told I Must Go
Stop Cry For Me
Choices I Made
Was Not A Tragedy
Tragedy, Tragedy
Was Not A Tragedy
