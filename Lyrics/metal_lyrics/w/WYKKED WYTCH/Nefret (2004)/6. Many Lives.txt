Liars... Lies...
Betrayal Makes Me Realize I Have No One To Trust
Religion Is Man Made, To Make Me Fear
I Wanna Die, Don't Need Your Sympathy
Everyone Wants Piece Of Me
But I Rise Above

No Gods - No Christ - Since Justice Failed
No Gods - No Christ - It's All Make Believe
No Gods - No Christ - Can't Cure Ill Society
There Are No God, We Know That By Now
No One Hears You, Why Bother To Pray
There Is No God, It's All Bullshit

Many Lives Many Die - Forget The Fate
Many Lives Many Die - Don't Compromise
Many Lives Many Die - Isn't The Way
Man	s Many Die - We All Be forgotten
Many Die - No One Will Survive
Many Lives Many Die - No Justice For Innocent

Its Too Late Memories Are Stained
Its Too Late Can't Reverse Damaged
Its Too Late For Redemption
My Life Is Not Redeemable
There's No Trust Everything Is Corrupt No Fuckin Way
There's No Trust You Joined The Statistics
We Are Just Numbers No Value For Human Life
We Destroy Than Create
My Best Was Not Good Enough All I Did Was Wasted My Years

Things Will Go on Even When I'm Gone
Things Will Go On Even When I'm Gone
There Are No Heroes Cause Are All Maniacs
Its Just Mayhem, Can't Help Being A Freak
There Are No Heroes Cause We Are Maniacs
Its Just Mayhem, Can't Help Being A Freak

Many Lives Many Die, Many Lives Many Die
Many Lives Many Die, Many Lives Many Die
