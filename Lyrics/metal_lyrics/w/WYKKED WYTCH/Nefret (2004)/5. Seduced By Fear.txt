Fear Is Within, Like Dripping Blood
I Can't Run From It
Awareness Not Helping
I'm Lost In My Words
Sentence Me To My Despair
Mentally Mute Deteriorated
Forgive Me If I'm Deprived

I Fear Nothing
There Is Nothing
Nothingness Surrounds Me
I Feel Nothing

Emptiness Saddens The World
There's Nothing Else Left
Destruction On The Way
Can't Defeat This Crisis

I Fear Nothing
There Is Nothing
Nothingness Surrounds Me
I Feel Nothing

I Fear Darkness Bright Light Blinds Me
I Fear Being Alone No One Besides Me
My Weakness Intriguing My Curiosity Seduced By Fear

I Hear Laughter Can't Stand The Lies
I Fear To Survive
I Hear Laughter Can't Stand The Lies
I Fear To Survive

Seduced By Fear Seduced By Fear
Seduced By Fear Seduced By Fear

Fear Is Within I Can't Run From It
Awareness Not Helping I'm Lost In My Words

Mentally Mute Already Deteriorated
Forgive Me If I'm Too Deprived
Prayers Are Useless
When I Have No Will
Society Failed Me Damn You Damn You

Nothing I Feel Nothing
