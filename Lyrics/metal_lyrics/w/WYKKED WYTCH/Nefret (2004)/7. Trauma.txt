Trauma Was My Premonition
This Can't Be Real, Why Me
Faced With This Awakening
What Is This Suppose To Be

I Lost My Innocence
Framed Is This Conspiracy
As I Saw My Child, Lifeless On The Floor
Shattered Dreams, Oblivious

Where Am I
Why Am I Still Here
Since You Taken All Of Me

Trauma

Searching For Answers That I Will Never Know
Can't Stand The Truth
When This Life Is Gone
Will You Be There For Me
Eternal Pain Begun

Trauma

What Ifs &amp; But Why's
Run Through My Mind
Nothing Can Ease My Insanity
No Drugs Will Sedate Me
My Only Salvation
Stay Alive Stay Alive

When I Can't Live For Now
Don't Tell Me Time Will Heal
There Is Nothing Left Behind But
Dry Ashes Mountain Of Tears
Dry Ashes Mountain Of Tears
Dry Ashes Mountain Of Tears
Dry Ashes Mountain Of Tears

What Ifs &amp; But Why's Run Through My Mind
What Ifs &amp; But Why's Run Through My Mind
