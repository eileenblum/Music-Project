On The Day After, I Came Back For Domination
There Was No Hope For The Future
No Civilisation, No Humanity
No Cure For This Crisis
This Land Lies In Ruins
They Welcome Starvation
Hunger Is Thar Will To Live
Eliminate The Passive
Bury The Hideous And Weak Darkness Is The Light
The End Is Certain
Fear You Can't Escape
Witness My Vicious Crimes
As The Sword Comes Down,
Everyone Shall Be Tortured Under My Spell,
Everyone Will Die
As The World Comes Down Victims Will Be Mine
Under My Power
Everyone Will Obey
Everyone Comes Down Victims Will Be Mine
Under My Power Everyone Will Obey
Come Down, Come Down Everyone Come Down
Give, Give, Forgive
Denied... Denied... Denied...
Come Down, Come Down Everyone Come Down
Soon It Will Be Time To Testify
Time To Sentence The Sins Of These Unholy
Right Or Wrong, It Js Just, Everyone Dies
Confessions Are A Blessing Forgiveness Denied
Those Will Pay For Her Betrayal Beware Of My Intentions
Victims Are Slaughtered
No Warning Of My Sadistic Acts Mindless Sheep You Are
Souls Were Sold
You Lost Your Right To Claim Shall Be Buried Under This Ground
That You Opened For Enemies
Forgiveness, Forgiveness
I Must Deny, Deny
The Innocent Are Condemned
With The Rest Of The Maniacs
Confessions Are A Blessing Forgiveness Denied
Those Wilt Pay For Her Betrayal
Beware Of My Intentions Victims Are Slaughtered
Forgiveness... Forgiveness... Forgiveness Denied
I Will Rape
I Will Mutilate
1 Will Rape
I Will Mutilate
I Will Rape, I Will Mutilate
1 W.I1 Desecrate
1 Will Avenge Your Blood And Mine
Blood Is Precious Blood Is Life
Everyone Embrace Me
No One Escapes From My Domination
All W.ll Face The Consequences
They Were Warned
No One Escapes My Domination
Your Devastation Is My Conquest
