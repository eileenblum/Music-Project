To Die...
To Die...
Dark Shroud Covers My Soul
From Hell To Eternity
Faith Does Not Exist
That's My Destiny
All I Have Are Vicious Memories
This Is How It Was Meant To Be
Dark Shroud From Eternity Faith Does Not Exist
That's My Destiny
Coming Your Way, Pray Soon
Here He Is Beneath Dark Clouds
Grabbing My Worthless Bones, Contains No Soul
Welcome Death, Open Arms
Lay Me Down Lay Me Down Let Me Down Let Me Down
Lay Me Down Lay Me Down Let Me Down Let Me Down
Let Me Be, Lay Me Down Welcome Me Now To Death
We Shall Live This Death Before My Last Breath
We Shall Endeavor
Final Symphony Of Death Yeah, Death
This Sickness Consumes Me From Birth
I've Known My Path To Die Before My Time
They Shall Die
To Die... To Die... To Die... To Die... To Die-
Nothing Can Stop This Plague
Prayers Are For The Weak
Allegiance To The Prince Of Darkness To Die, Is My Only Plan
Nothing Can Hold Me Back
Until My Last Breath
To Die
To Die... Before My Time
To Die
To Die... Before My Time
Nothing Can Stop This Plague
Prayers Are For The Weak
Allegiance To The Prince Of Darkness
To Die, Is My Only Plan
Nothing Can Hold Me Back
Until My Last Breath
To Die...
