They Betrayed The Master
Victimized Her Down Below
Death To Hypocrites, Liars, Their Blind Slaves
Mortal Christ Has Come, Justice Is Final
We Brought Sin And Death Upon You
I Crave Blood, I Shall Drmk
Lady Nailed To A Cross
Crucified For Her Beliefs
Slashed And Slayed By Enemies
They Were Not Aware Of Her Power
Feast Of Blood Will Feed The Hunger
Beast Desires Defeat The Weak
Wake, Wake, Wake, Wake
We Lost Our Faith,
Faith Lost Us Our Eternal Hate And
Vengeance Now Time To Exorcise
Ashes Rose From Death
Laughing At Her Enemies
One By One, They Fall
What Lurks Beneath The Flesh
They Betrayed The Master
Victimized Her Down Below
Death To Hypocrites, Liars, And Slaves
Pray For Mercy, Death Is Beside You Soon We Shall Emerge
Death To Lies That Pollute The World I Come For Weak Souls

I Shall Take The Suffering
For The Lord Join Us For Eternity
Lifeless Is Your Final Destiny
Desires Were Truth
Truth Was Abolished By Lies
Intent To Preach Righteousness In Dead Souls
Desires Were Truth
Truth Was Abolished By Lies
Intent To Preach Righteousness In Dead Souls
Lies, Lies, Lies...
Where Is The Truth
Action Has Been Finalized
Admission Of Guilt Punished By Cruelty
Brutality Remains Silent
Your Fate Has Been Sealed
No Brutality Your Fate
Paralyzed Pathetic Beings You Will
Bow Down To My Supremacy
Slaves Of My Kingdom
You Will Suffer My Lasting Glory,
Paralyzed Pathetic Beings You Will Bow Down
To My Supremacy Slaves Of My Kingdom
You Will Suffer My Lasting Glory
Pray For Mercy Death Is Near
Soon We Shall Emerge
Truth Is Gone By Deceit
You Will Suffer My Hate Eternally
