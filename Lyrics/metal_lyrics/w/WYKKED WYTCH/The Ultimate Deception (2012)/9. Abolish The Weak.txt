Life is misery
Your thoughts decline
Defiant as the curse
We need salvation
Soul keeps searching

Yeah up your lies
Sanity is a dream
Seems so faraway
Itâs so unreal

Your actions despicable
Relentless unpure
Fate will unseal eventually

More than an obsession
Instinct from ancient crypt
Corrupted from inside out
Guilt of deformity
Is the devil in disguise
Tragedy of ordeal
Unpurity of lost humane
The stench of ash remains

Dark clouds creeping upon me
Nevermore defeats
Cost your infidelity
I shall dispose
Waste your serenity

Yeah, up your lies
Denial is way of life
Youâre not my inspiration
Absolute failure
You have no influence upon me
You failed me

Abolish the weak
Abolish the weak
Abolish the weak
Abolish the weak

Yeah up your lies
Sanity is a dream
Seems so faraway
Itâs so unreal

Your actions despicable
Relentless unpure
Fate will unseal eventually
