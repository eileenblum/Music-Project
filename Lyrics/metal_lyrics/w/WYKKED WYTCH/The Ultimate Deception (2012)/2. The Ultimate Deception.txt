Dream of vengeance
Waiting For Bloodshed
Massacre I predicted
Embedded in my head
You disregard all honesty
But you failed so miserably

Follow your shepherd all of you sheep
As you plan for my defeat
Let the crippled weep
On your skin soul
Iâm the one that holds all control

Empty words not worthy
Shallow from inside, now face me

Now forfeit your visual lies
Sick tired of being dehumanized
When you planned to strike
I struck back
I viciously left you with
A knife in your back
Youâre embarrassment to your race
Couldnât take me on face to face
Confrontation built upon years
Iâm the one that will make you
Disappear

Still holding you to highest degree
Even though you always deceived me
Iâm watching my life slip away

 Dream of vengeance
Waiting For Bloodshed
Massacre I predicted
Embedded in my head
You disregard all honesty
But you failed so miserably

Words arenât believable
Fake smiles hypocrisy
Beware the ones
You trusted those are
They will laugh at you

The guilt in your heart enslaves
Coward is the name
Take it to your grave
Downward spiral leading to demise
You live a lie that wonât affect me
How could a coward like
You can replace me
Beware the ones you
Abused &amp; Mistreated

Now forfeit your visual lies
Sick tired of being dehumanized
When you planned to strike
I struck back
I viciously left you with
A knife in your back
Youâre embarrassment to your race
Couldnât take me on face to face
Confrontation built upon years
Iâm the one that will make you
Disappear
