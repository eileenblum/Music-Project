Centuries of silence
Awakening from slumber
Hollow dreams so deep
In a world asleep

Time for a wakeup call
Inner dwellers begin to crawl
Dead see no end
Nothing out there for you

Outbreakâ¦
You wasted Every
Moment of your life

From the shadow of your life
Go ahead and hide
Itâs your comeback time
Planning your demise
When the sleepers rise
I hope you all die
When the sleepers rise
Hearing all the cries
Suffering gets me high
Execute demise
When the sleepers rise
I hope you die

Release the anger and rage
No protection against this plague
Extermination date has been set
Years of preparing for battle
Underestimate my power
Iâll lead you brainwashed traitors

Iâll give you a wakeup call
Moments before your downfall
Outbreakâ¦End of the line
Iâve made the decision
No one destroys my vision

From the shadow of your life
Go ahead and hide
Itâs your comeback time
Planning your demise
When the sleepers rise
I hope you all die
When the sleepers rise
Hearing all the cries
Suffering gets me high
Execute demise
When the sleepers rise
I hope you die

Iâm the leader with new infection
With agenda of destruction
Beware of my confidence
Erased with a vengeance

From the shadow of your life
Go ahead and hide
Itâs your comeback time
Planning your demise
When the sleepers rise
I hope you all die
When the sleepers rise
Hearing all the cries
Suffering gets me high
Execute demise
When the sleepers rise
I hope you die
