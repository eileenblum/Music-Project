Weâve come to reclaim our past
Storm the gates with battle axe
Slaughter the young take your brides
War of the centuries rip out insides

Bearing marks from the past
Fallen creatures prepare to dine
Ravaged weak with the fear
Scent of death is near

Feast upon remains
Feed the hunger of the insane
Feast upon remains
Feed the hunger of the insane

Motherfuckers I want you to die

Tellers, bring your lies
Serpents among us
Tellers, bring your lies
Serpents among us

Traitor masters of deceit
False prophet always the enemy
Gutless swine that canât face me
Itâs time to meet your destiny

Watch as I destroy the one so adored
I came to rape and murder your whore
Look upon me as you beg on your knees
Itâs too late canât hear your screams

Feast upon remains
Feed the hunger of the insane

Dark supremacy begins our legacy
Allegiance to our lord
Returns us to the kingdom

Tellers, bring your lies
Serpents among us
Tellers, bring your lies
Serpents among us

Cleansing the maggots
Summon the immortals
Darkness consumes the flames
Down on your knees

Cleansing the maggots
Summon the immortals
Darkness consumes the flames
Down on your knees

Stench of death
Scent of your final domain
Forgiveness is not a trade
My venom dissolves your sanity
Surrender your entity

Serpents among us
Serpents among us
Serpents among us
