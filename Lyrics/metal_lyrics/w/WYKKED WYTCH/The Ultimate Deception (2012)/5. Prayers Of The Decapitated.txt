Deceased forefathers
Perished in vain
Deceit blinded vision
Can you see my rage
Prayersâ¦of decapitated
Prayersâ¦of decapitated

Demon disguised traitors
Behold or be dishonored
Eternal Compromise will shatter
Victory ended with wisdom

Stand before me blood on your hands
Hear me god hear me god run from me
Stand before me blood on your hands
Hear me god hear me god run from me
Rust in pieces you wonât me missed
Under my doubt cuz I hated you

Prayersâ¦of decapitated
Prayersâ¦of decapitated

Claim your birthright
Embrace all the evil
Embedded sins justifies our tale
We shall not surrender

Stand before me blood on your hands
Hear me god hear me god run from me
Stand before me blood on your hands
Hear me god hear me god run from me
Rust in pieces you wonât me missed
Under my doubt cuz I hated you

Prayersâ¦of decapitated
Prayersâ¦of decapitated

Now our life is fading
Alone with darkness waiting
Final memories of desires
Feeling like hours
Those survive the battle
Now thrown in fire
Final resting place for farewell
Demise at the gates of hell
Catastrophe begins in twilight
Crisis of eternal bloody war
Defeat is not an option I know that
Where Misguided trust
Becomes the trap
Youâre the bait in the end
In enemies eyes we are the forsaken
Everything had now taken away
Why not we are always the victim

Prayers are useless
No one can hear you
I canât hear you
No one hears you
I canât hear you
