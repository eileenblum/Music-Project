Each time you pray
Another one is betrayed
Fearful afraid
You are born disgraced
Birthing the beast
Sinister creature released
No cure for disease
Demon is unleashed

Creation gift I hold inside
Breeding a life-force
That wonât survive
Poison runs strong in our veins

Wasted time of being alive
This body &amp; soul is not divine
Committing the ultimate sacrifice
Time decayed for the price you paid

Actions of worthless one
What was taken was not yours
New flesh creation of a whore
Dishonor the maker
By becoming the taker
Captivated destruction of a life
A haunting connection dissection

Each time you pray
Another one is betrayed
Fearful afraid
You are born disgraced
Birthing the beast
Sinister creature released
No cure for disease
Demon is unleashed

Perfect creature imagined inside
Sins of your past now realized
Seed implanted for no reason
Bloodline will carry on your name

Wasted time of being alive
This body &amp; soul is not divine
Committing the ultimate sacrifice
Time decayed for the price you paid

Born into society of waste
Your soul is ready to take
Innocence corrupted in the process
This poison soul
Will not let you be free
You will become what I hated

This time demon arrived

Each time you pray
Another one is betrayed
Fearful afraid
You are born disgraced
Birthing the beast
Sinister creature released
No cure for disease
Demon is unleashed
