Eyes of a vulture
Eyes of a vulture

Feeding from the mind a sick game
Feeding from the weak willed
Done without shame
Feasting flesh for survival
Two legged killer stalking the prey
Waiting to decay

Those who prey upon us
The ones who I shall not cross
My unjust conviction to the prey

Carcassâ¦Corpseâ¦
Thatâs your meal
Raptors hungry claws
Infections

Falling upon those whom I defend
Youâll be hunted by the cannibals
Kill or be killed run if you can
I wonât give in to
Self-righteous animals
Sharpen your claws
Ripped &amp; sliced
Flesh Criminals to hell with you

Those who prey upon us
The ones who I shall not cross
My unjust conviction to the prey
Torsos lot of blood all thatâs left
Neverâ¦Neverâ¦
Neverâ¦Neverâ¦
Turn your back

Circling in the land of dead
Scavengers need to be fed
Waiting for the beast
Vultures upon the feast
Left to rot on the cross
Hungry claws gorge
This wounded victim

Those who prey upon us
The ones who I shall not cross
My unjust conviction to the prey
Carcassâ¦Corpsesâ¦All thatâs left

Feeding from the mind a sick game
Feeding from the weak willed
Done without shame
Feasting flesh for survival
Two legged killer stalking the prey

Look into the eyes of a vulture
Killers
Look into the eyes of a vulture
