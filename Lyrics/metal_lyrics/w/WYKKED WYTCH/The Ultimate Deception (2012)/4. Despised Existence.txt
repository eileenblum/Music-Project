Tainted bloodâ¦Rotted corpse
Tainted bloodâ¦Rotted corpse

Iâll slit your throat rip your tongue out
Iâll carve my name into your flesh
Iâll light you on fire forget your ashes
My hatred engulfed in flames

Behind these vacant walls
Hidden terror still remains
Discharged disposed
Blood spilled all in vain
No caused achieved a failed victory
Disgraced memory of the deceased

Iâll slit your throat rip your tongue out
Iâll carve my name into your flesh
Iâll light you on fire forget your ashes
My hatred engulfed in flames

There is nothing there is nothing
Not a damn thing left behind
Thereâs no one I care for
Why should I sacrifice
Befriended by someone
I always despised
Youâre a pretentious
Self-centered whore

Did you ever think twice?
That you would pay a price
Posing up there such a faker
One day you will face your maker

Look back to your past
I made your dreams a reality

Memories forgotten
Who will be there as youâre fading

Iâll slit your throat rip your tongue out
Iâll carve my name into your flesh
Iâll light you on fire forget your ashes
My hatred engulfed in flames

There is nothing there is nothing
Not a damn thing left behind
Thereâs no one I care for
Why should I sacrifice
Befriended by someone
I always despised
Youâre a pretentious
Self-centered whore

Gift of self is rape
On the path till destruction
Give in to your demons
Question your reason for living

Tainted bloodâ¦rotting corpse

There is nothing there is nothing
Not a damn thing left behind
Thereâs no one I care for
Why should I sacrifice
Befriended by someone
I always despised
Youâre a pretentious
Self-centered whore
