I WALK, YOU RUN
YOU SEEK, I HIDE
YOU FAILED TO THE SEE THE DEVIL INSIDE
INVADE YOUR BRAIN
YOUR LOSS, MY GAIN
IâLL TAKE PLEASURE FROM YOUR PAIN
FROM YOUR PAIN
FROM YOUR PAIN

MANIPULATE
MY MIND IS SET
IâLL TAKE AND TAKE WITH NO REGRET
DECEPTIVE WAYS
FEEL YOU OUT
YOU OPEN UP WITH NO SELF-DOUBT
NO SELF-DOUBT
NO SELF-DOUBT
NO SELF-DOUBT

I WANT SO BADLY TO BELIEVE
A SITTING TARGET FOR YOU TO DECEIVE
NO GUARDIAN ANGEL HAS APPEARED
HELPFUL ADVICE ARE WORDS THAT I FEAR
YOU LISTENED TO MY PRIVATE AMBITION
SAVED IT UP FOR YOUR AMMUNITION
TILL THE MOMENT I LEAST EXPECT
USED ME UP TILL THEREâS NOTHING LEFT

GUARDIAN ANGEL - BURNED YOU DOWN
GUARDIAN ANGEL â UNDERGROUND
GUARDIAN ANGEL - BURNED YOU DOWN
GUARDIAN ANGEL â CANâT BE FOUND

NO GUARDIAN ANGEL

[REPEAT 1ST VERSE]

YOU WANT SO BADLY TO BELIEVE
A SITTING TARGET FOR ME TO DECEIVE
YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL HAS APPEARED
HELPFUL ADVICE AS YOU CRY IN YOUR BEER
I LISTENED TO YOUR PRIVATE AMBITION
SAVED IT UP FOR MY AMMUNITION
TILL THE MOMENT YOU LEAST EXPECT
I USED YOU UP TILL THEREâS NOTHING LEFT

[REPEAT CHORUS]
