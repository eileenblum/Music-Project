BACKED INTO A CORNER
ENEMY PRESENCE NEAR
HEART AND MIND ARE RACING
BUT THEY CANâT OUTRUN MY FEAR

SPOTLIGHTS KILL THE DARKNESS
DOGS ON THE TRAIL
BULLETS MARKED WITH MY NAME
TO STOP MY BREAK FROM JAIL
BREAK FROM JAIL!

INSULT OR INJURY MATTERS TO ME NONE
LIVING LIFE BY WAY OF THE GUN

FREEDOM WAITS BEYOND THE WALLS
OF CONCRETE AND STEEL
I WANNA LIVE MY LIFEâS AT STAKE
I TOOK A CHANCE TO MAKE A BREAK

LIVING AND DYING - ITâS ALL THE SAME TO ME
MY NAME IS HELL - I HAVE BEEN UNLEASHED
UNLEASHED!

SUDDENLY THE PANIC STOPS
THE PATH IS FUCKING CLEAR
SLAY RESISTANCE WITH FULL FORCE
HEAD-FIRST WITHOUT FEAR

PIGS ARE PAID TO KILL
BUT IâM KILLING FOR THE THRILL
IâLL TAKE THESE BASTARDS WITH ME
I SWEAR THEIR BLOOD WILL SPILL
BLOOD WILL SPILL!

INSULT OR INJURY MATTERS TO ME NONE
LIVING LIFE BY WAY OF THE GUN

FREEDOM WAITS BEYOND THE WALLS
OF CONCRETE AND STEEL
I WANNA LIVE MY LIFEâS AT STAKE
I TOOK A CHANCE TO MAKE A BREAK

SUFFERING THE TIES THAT BIND ME TOGETHER
DESTROY THE SYSTEM THAT HELD ME DOWN
RELEASING MYSELF UNTO MYSELF
I HAVE BEEN UNLEASHED!

SCREAMING IN THE FACE OF DEATH
PUMPED FULL OF LEAD
BLOODY BUT UNBOWED I LEAVE A TRAIL OF THE DEAD

MY LAST STAND THEYâRE CLOSING IN
THEYâVE GOT THE PLACE SURROUNDED
HUNTED FOR A WAY OUT 
I FOUND IT!

SUFFERING THE TIES THAT BIND ME TOGETHER
DESTROY THE SYSTEM THAT HELD ME DOWN
RELEASING MYSELF UNTO MYSELF
I HAVE BEEN UNLEASHED!

UNLEASHED!
[X5]
