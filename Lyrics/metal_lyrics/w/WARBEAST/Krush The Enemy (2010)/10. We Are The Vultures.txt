MAIDEN SPIKES OF IRON IN THEIR BACKS
LIMBS PLUCKED OFF THEIR BODIES BY THE RACK
BEHEADED CORPSES FROM THE GUILLOTINE
VICTIMS OF MIDIEVAL DEATH MACHINES

HERETICS, TRAITORS AND COMMON CRIMINALS
INQUISITIONS THEY BETRAYED
PURIFICATION COMES THROUGH PAINâ¦

THEY NOW CONTROL - YOUR DESTINY
NOW THEY PROLONG - YOUR AGONY
YOUR PUNISHMENT - CRUEL AND VULGAR
SICK HUMAN TORTURE - IT THRIVES IN OUR CULTURE

ANAL IMPALEMENT ON THE JUDAS CHAIR
VAGINAS MUTILATED BY THE PEAR
TEETH IMPLODED BY THE HEAD CRUSHER
TORMENT DEVICES BUILT TO MAKE YOU SUFFER

HERETICS, TRAITORS AND COMMON CRIMINALS
INQUISITIONS DISOBEYED
PURIFICATION COMES THROUGH PAINâ¦

YOU DARE DEFY THE LAWS OF THE OFFICIAL DOCTRINE?
YOUR MISERY HAS JUST BEGUN

MACHINES OF MALICE - ANCIENT HIGH-TECH RAGE
STRANGE AMUSEMENT - ITâS A HUMAN DISGRACE

AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER NOW DIDNâT YOU?
YOUR FATE IS NOW IN THEIR HANDS

HUMAN SACRIFICE - ON DISPLAY
ENTERTAINMENT - FOR THE HUMAN RACEâ¦
DISGRACE! DISGRACE! DISGRACE! DISGRACE!

THEY NOW CONTROL - YOUR DESTINY
NOW THEY PROLONG - YOUR AGONY
YOUR PUNISHMENT â CRUEL AND VULGAR
SICK HUMAN TORTURE - AND WE ARE THE VULTURES

WE ARE THE VULTURES - WE ARE THE VULTURES
[X3]

WE ARE THE VULTURES - MACHINES OF MALICE
WE ARE THE VULTURES - STRANGE AMUSEMENT
WE ARE THE VULTURES - ANCIENT RAGE
WE ARE THE VULTURES - BEHEAD THEM ALL â NOOOO!
WE ARE THE VULTURES - BEHEAD THEM ALL â NOOOO!
WE ARE THE VULTURES - BEHEAD THEM ALL â NOOOO!
WE ARE THE VULTURES - BEHEAD THEM ALL â NOOOO!
