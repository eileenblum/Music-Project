FORCED INTO SLAVERY
MY 9 TO 5 DEATH MACHINE
I WONâT DELIVER
ON THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN DREAM
NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE
NEVER DARE TO BREAK FREE
LIKE RATS IN A MAZE
LOST FOR ETERNITY

CORPSES FEED THE FLAMES
WHEN DREAD PREVAILS
DEATH BY DESIGN
ANOTHER LESSON FAILSâ¦

THE CONTROLLER

I LAUGH AT THE REBELS
TRYING TO FIND THEIR DESTINY
DOOMED AND OPPRESSED 
BY AN UNSEEN ENEMY
CHAINED TO THE TREADMILL
TILL THE DAY YOU EXPIRE
A WORTHLESS PROTESTING
YOU NEVER STOP TO QUESTION WHY

CORPSES FEED THE FLAMES
WHEN DREAD PREVAILS
DEATH BY DESIGN
ANOTHER LESSON FAILSâ¦

THE CONTROLLER â CONTROLLING YOU
THE CONTROLLER â CONTROLLING ME

FEEL THE GRIP
OF IRON HANDS
YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE
AT ITâS DEMANDS

CORPSES FEED THE FLAMES
WHEN DREAD PREVAILS
DEATH BY DESIGN
ANOTHER LESSON FAILSâ¦

THE CONTROLLER â CONTROLLING YOU
THE CONTROLLER â CONTROLLING ME

FEEL THE GRIP
OF IRON HANDS
YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE
AT ITâS DEMANDS
