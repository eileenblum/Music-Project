WEâVE NEVER MET / BUT YOUâRE IN MY THOUGHTS
YOUR PICTURES ADORN MY WALLS
I KNOW WHERE YOU WORK - I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I CALL
YOU ASK WHOâS THERE AND I START TO SPEAK
OF THE PLANS IâVE GOT FOR YOU
MAKING SWEET LOVE WITH MY HANDS ON YOUR THROAT
UNTIL YOUR FLESH TURNS BLUE

FEELING MY STARE - EVERYWHERE
FEELING MY STARE TONIGHT
A FACE IN THE CROWD - AN OMINOUS CLOUD
FEELING MY STARE TONIGHT
IâM GETTING CLOSER - TO YOU!

SATURDAY NIGHT / YOUâRE OUT ON THE TOWN
YOUR FRIENDS DRINK AND DANCE
ACROSS THE ROOM I WATCH YOUR BODY SWAY
YOU NEVER GIVE ME A FUCKING GLANCE
YOU ACT LIKE TRASH WITH EVERY JERK IN THE PLACE
YOUâRE GONNA LEARN SOME RESPECT
A REAL LADY CANâT DRINK OR SMOKE
WITH BLOOD POURING OUT HER NECK

FEELING MY STARE - EVERYWHERE
ANYPLACE YOU TURN
A FACE IN THE CROWD - AN OMINOUS CLOUD
ANYPLACE YOU TURN
I'M GETTING CLOSER - TO YOU!

CRIME OF OBSESSION â NOW IâM HUNTING YOU
YOUâRE MY POSSESSION â I TRACK YOUR EVERY MOVE
PERSISTENT DELUSION â FROM VOICES IN MY HEAD
VICTIM OF ILLUSION â REALITY I DREAD
I DREAD! I DREAD! I DREAD!

I SEARCH AND LURK / ON THE INTERNET
YOUR SPACE IS MY-SPACE TOO
I READ YOUR COMMENTS TO ALL THOSE MEN
YOU MUST THINK THAT WEâRE ALL FOOLS
MY MIND BELIEVES THAT YOU BELONG TO ME
I REALLY NEED YOU BY MY SIDE
IF I CANâT HAVE YOU / THEN NOBODY CAN
YOUR FINAL CHOICE IS ME OR DIE

FEELING MY STARE - EVERYWHERE
FEELING MY STARE TONIGHT
A FACE IN THE CROWD - AN OMINOUS CLOUD
FEELING MY STARE TONIGHT
AND NOW I AM - AND NOW IâM STALKING YOU!
AND NOW IâM STALKING YOU!
[X2]
AND NOW IâM STALKING YOU â STALKER!
[X5]
