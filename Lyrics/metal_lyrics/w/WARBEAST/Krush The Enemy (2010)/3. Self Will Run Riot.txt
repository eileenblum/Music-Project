WE THOUGHT WE COULD STOP
WHENEVER WE WANTED
WE THOUGHT OUR HOUSE
COULD NEVER BE HAUNTED
LOSS OF CONTROL
SYMPTOM OF DISEASE
SACRIFICE ALL
DEPENDENCY

SELF WILL RUN RIOT - SELF WILL RUN RIOT

TRAPPED IN ILLUSION
ANOTHER STATE OF MIND
AVOIDING THE MIRROR
JUST ONE MORE TIME
SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS
FROM OUR PATTERNS OF LIFE
SELF DESTRUCTIVE
THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE

SELF WILL RUN RIOT - SELF WILL RUN RIOT

JUSTIFICATION, DESOLIZATION, SUBSTITUTION,
DISTRUST OF OTHERS
DEGRADATION, DERELICTION, ISOLATION
AND LOSS OF CONTROL
LYING AND CHEATING, YOUR LOVED ONES ARE WEEPING
YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN UNTIL NEITHER DO THEY
THE DOCTORS AND PREACHERS ARE FAILING TO SAVE US
KILLING OURSELVES AT THE END OF THE DAY

REPEAT FIRST VERSE

SELF WILL RUN RIOT - SELF WILL RUN RIOT
SELF WILL RUN RIOT - SELF WILL RUN RIOT

LYING AND CHEATING, YOUR LOVED ONES ARE WEEPING
YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN UNTIL NEITHER DO THEY
THE DOCTORS AND PREACHERS ARE FAILING TO SAVE US
KILLING OURSELVES AT THE END OF THE DAY
