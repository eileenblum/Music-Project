DAY OF ANNIHALTAION
DAWNING ON THE SEA OF FLAMES
THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT THEY WISHED THE NIGHT
WOULD HIDE THE LIST OF NAMES

SCORCHED EARTH POLICY IN EFFECT
BROKEN TEETH AND SNAPPING NECKS
BURY THE GUILTY IN SHALLOW GRAVES
ON BLOODY KNEES FOREVER SLAIN

SCORCHED EARTH POLICY

DRAIN THE CHALICE SACRED WINE
THE DESERTS QUENCH THEIR THIRST
BURNING TEMPLES PROPHESIZE
PREDICTIONS OF THE WORST

SCORCHED EARTH POLICY IN EFFECT
WASTELAND FOLLOWS RETREAT
INVADERS TRIUMPH DIES IN THE FACE
IN THEIR OWN DEFEAT

SCORCHED EARTH POLICY
SCORCHED EARTH POLICY
SCORCHED EARTH POLICY
SCORCHED EARTH POLICY
SCORCHED EARTH POLICY

REVERSE OSMOSIS EXTRACTION OF LIFE
AS BLOOD BREAKS INTO BOIL
A HOLLOW VICTORY UNDER SMOKE FILLED SKIES
A KINGDOM OF BLACKEND SOIL

SCORCHED EARTH POLICY
SCORCHED EARTH POLICY
SCORCHED EARTH POLICY
