BORN WITH A HEART AS BLACK AS SPACE
BETWEEN THE STARS NO LIGHT ESCAPES
PLEAS FOR MERCY ON DEAF EARS
FREEZING STARE THAT SHEDS NO TEARS
NO PITY FROM A FACE OF STONE
CLOAKED IN HATE CONCUSSED ALONE

PERSECUTION / EXECUTION / ELECTROCUTION
BORN WITH A BLACKENED HEART
BORN WITH A BLACKENED HEART

BORN WITH A HEART IMMUNE TO GRACE
ANOTHER DIES, A FORGOTTEN FACE
SECRETS PASSED ON VACANT STREETS
WHISPERED NAMES NO ONE REPEATS
THE MOURNFUL CHORUS CRIES REFRAIN
LIKE A DEAD WORLD WITH AN UNKNOWN NAME

PERSECUTION / EXECUTION / ELECTROCUTION
BORN WITH A BLACKENED HEART

BURN A CANDLE FOR THOSE BENEATH
SUSTAINING THE COMFORT OF ETERNAL GRIEF
A SOUL SURROUNDED BY FORTRESS WALLS
BUILT BEFORE MAN LEARNED TO CRAWL
NO WEAPONS CAN EVER CRUSH THIS SHIELD
INVINCIBLE YET IMPRISONED HERE

PERSECUTION / EXECUTION / ELECTROCUTION
BORN WITH A BLACKENED HEART
[X4]
