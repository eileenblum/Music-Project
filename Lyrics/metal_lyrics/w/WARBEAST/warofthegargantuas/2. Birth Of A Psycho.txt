[performed by Warbeast][1st verse:]
You think life is so damn easy?
Well you donât miss what you havenât had.
I get pissed-off for no reason,
Iâm done with lifeâ¦ now Iâm doing death!

Walking Time-Bomb - on the rampage
Human Time-Bomb â Iâm full of rage.........
Iâm full of rage

[Chorus:]
Twisted mind.......
Tortured soul.......
Shattered dreams.......
Itâs the Birth of a -
Psychopathic, crazy-maniac
Sociopathic, skitzophreniac
Psychopathic, crazy-maniac
Sociopathic, skitzophreniac

[2nd verse:]
My mind's about to trip-out,
Your heart Iâd like to rip-out.
I can't control my own fate,
I am immersed in pure hateâ¦.
Pure hate

They think that I'm eccentric,
I turned out egocentric.
Avenge of my rejection,
Revenge is my redemption.

[Pissed-off screaming part:]
Iâm fucking losinâ itâ¦
I HATE EVERYBODY!

[Evil nararation during mosh part:]
First Iâll gauge my fingers and smash my hands through your head
So I can pull out your brains piece by piece.
When all the grey matter has leaked through my fingers onto the floorâ¦
Iâll use the blood-caked fingers to pluck out your eyes.

Bizarre acts of violence.
Lashing-out with frustration.
It's a grudge against the worldâ¦.
Itâs the birth of a psycho

Itâs the birthâ¦ of a psycho
Iâm not in my right mind!
It's the birth.... of a psycho
Iâm not in my right mind!

[Guitar solo section]

[3rd verse:]
Creepy, crackpot, confused, nutcase
Outcast, oddball... I'm a basket case
Mixed-up, madman, mental, manic
Distant, disturbedâ¦ I'm a deviant

Short-fused Time-Bomb - out of control
Ticking Time-Bombâ¦ ready to explode
Walking Time-Bomb - on the warpath
Human Time-Bomb - I'm filled with wrath.........

[Repeat Chorus:]
Twisted mind.......
Tortured soul.......
Shattered dreams.......
Itâs the Birth of a....
Psychopathic, crazy-maniac
Sociopathic, skitzophreniac
Psychopathic, crazy-maniac
Sociopathic, skitzophreniac
