[performed by Warbeast]Historically, made in the mold of man
Destruction, unyielding, a curse
Inherently, obedient to ITs command
Sometimes a mixed blessing of the worst

Inanimate, until IT is coerced to kill
Revenging, murder, oppressor
Inhumanoid, without a vital conscience will
Unformed and imperfect reigning chaos over targets of infamy

Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Body without a soul

Intensity, meditational magic
Resulting, conforming and crude
This isnât cruelty so much that IT is tragic
Deactivation alters not his mood

Eventually, IT runs amok and grows in stature
Enormous, violent, mass
Continuing, impossible to capture
Violating, mutilating, burnt offering

Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Body without a soul

Intensity, meditational magic
Resulting, conforming and crude
This isnât cruelty so much that IT is tragic
Deactivation alters not his mood

Inanimate, until IT is coerced to kill
Revenging, murder, oppressor
Inhumanoid, without a vital conscience will
Unformed and imperfect reigning chaos over targets of infamy

Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Body without a soul

Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Body without a soul or a heart

Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Body without a soul or a heart or a mind

Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
Flee from meâ¦ for I am Golem
I am IT!
