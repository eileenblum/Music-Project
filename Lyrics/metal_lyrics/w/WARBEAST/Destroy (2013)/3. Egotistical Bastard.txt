[Music â Scott Shelby, Lyrics â Bruce Corbitt]

Here comes Mr.-know-it-all, riding on his high-horse
Off on another ego trip, on top of the world
The earth revolves around him; heâs above us all
Heâs so high and mighty, that he has no downfalls

You didnât even have to say itâ¦
But thatâs how you come across to me
You have to sing your own praises
Just to boost your own self esteem

[Lead: Bobby Tillotson]

[Pre-chorus:]
You walk on air
Your shit donât stink
Even when youâre wrong youâre right

Your heads so big
Youâre so stuck-up
Youâre Godâs gift to us all

Youâve gone too far
Youâve lost your mind
I hate to burst your bubble

Youâre not so smart
You are so vain
Youâre what we all callâ¦

[Chorus:]
An Egotistical Bastard
Youâve already lived your next chapter
Just an Egotistical Bastard
You brought me to tears from my laughter

[Lead: Bobby Tillotson]

Bragging just to hear his self talk, âcause no-one else will listen
He shows-off when he does anything, âcause he craves for the attention
A self-absorbed waste of oxygen, who expects us to grovel at his feet
He admires himself more than anyone, âcause he thinks heâs one of the elite

[Pre-chorus]

[Repeat Chorus x2]
