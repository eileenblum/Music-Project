You think that I'm afraid?
No rules ever obeyed
You'll soon feel my rage
I'm ready to engage!
You wanna mess with me?
Then you'll need an army
You better bring it on
Cause I'm an army of one!

Nobody gets in my way
Nobody dares defy me
Nobody lives to tell about it
Nobody disrespects me...
Insults me...
Can beat me...
Will defeat me!

You say you're filled with hate
Then I accept your fate
You have ignored my warning
Now the storm is coming!
You wanna make your mark
I'm waiting in the dark
For you to take that step
A move you'll always regret!


Nobody gets in my way
Nobody dares defy me
Nobody lives to tell about it
Nobody disrespects me...
Insults me...
Can beat me...
Will defeat me!

[Lead: Scott Shelby]

You should have listened
They tried to warn you
But you ignored them
And now they mourn you!

Your corpse a message
To fools who follow
If they are wiser
They'll see tomorrow!

You're not the first to try
You're just the next to die!
Power flows through my veins
Life exits your remains

You should have walked away
Held your demise at bay
Your life would've been spared
But now your death's been declared!

Nobody gets in my way
Nobody dares defy me
Nobody will ever survive
Nobody disrespects me...
Insults me...
Can beat me...
Will defeat me!
