Meteors strike earth
Spaceships emerge
Aliens attack
Human race fights back

Laser beams, heat rays and incinerators
Missiles, bombs, grenades, and rocket launchers

This is the birth of World War 3
Is this the death of humanity?

Our fate is coming soon
The earth has met it's doom
Presumptuous to think that we're the only life known
Mankind's harsh reality is we are not alone

We are in the war Of The worlds

Space invaders, flying saucers, unknown creatures
Bombs exploding, cities crumbling, planet eroding

Galaxies collide
Only one survives
Regiments detached
Our weapons are no match

Laser beams, heat rays and incinerators
Missiles, bombs, grenades, and rocket launchers

One thing they have failed on their criteria
There's no resistance to our bacteria

Their fate is coming soon
Their kind has met their doom
Presumptuous to think that we could ever be dethroned
Their species harsh reality is they are not alone

We have won the war of the worlds
