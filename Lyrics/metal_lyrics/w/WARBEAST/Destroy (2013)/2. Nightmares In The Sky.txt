[Music â Scott Shelby, Lyrics â Bruce Corbitt, Rick Perry]

On churches and cathedrals
Deterrent from their evil
The gaze of grinning devils

Crafted in ancient times
So grotesque in design
The patron saint thatâs confined

[Chorus:]
Alive at night, spread their wings and fly
Behold the nightmares in the sky
Itâs dark outside, they have taken flight
Beware of nightmares in the sky

Firmly perched on his lair
A menacing glare and stare
Damnations meant to scare

Sculptures that cause sheer terror
Statues that live forever
Focused on human error

Incarnations, Half-man half-beast
They are monsters that are not of this world

Protruding out, spewing their poison
When the thunder storms filled their eyes with rain

Stagnant by day, soldiers by night
They will become nocturnal defenders

Gargoyles at guard, sworn to protect
They will ward off the unwanted spirits

[Lead: Scott Shelby, Harmony: Bobby Tillotson]

Ancient Eyes dead and wise
See the passing of our lives
In our blind commute to go nowhere
Unaware we are watched
Down below all is lost
Down below in the streets of this hell

We never pause we never look
We never read unholy book
We never felt the timeless evil in their stare
Down the line biding time
Wings of stone wait to fly
Wings of stone wait to take to the air

As centuries passed them by
Their purpose changed over time
Peoples fear turned to spite

Betrayed by their creators
Annoyed with being saviors
Their loyalty now has wavered

Angered and filled with disgust
They have deceived our blind trust
Now they are coming for us

Carved creatures frozen stone
Forgotten and alone
These demons left their throne

[Repeat Chorus]

Nightmares, nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares in the sky!
