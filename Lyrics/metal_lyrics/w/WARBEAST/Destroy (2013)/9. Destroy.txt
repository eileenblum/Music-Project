Ladies and gentlemen
It's the moment we've all been waiting for
It's time to witness the return of the unstoppable force

It's been building up to this night
Constantly preparing for this fight

It's time to punish you
It's time to devastate you
It's time to annihilate you
It's time to pummel you
It's time to demolish you
It's time to destroy you
It's time to destroy

Never been more focused for anything
Unbeatable once we step into the ring
Ready to crush you when we enter the cage
Determined to thrash you when we hit the stage

It's time to conquer you
It's time to ravage you
It's time to eradicate you
It's time to defeat you
It's time to pulverize you
It's time to destroy you

Obliterate, annihilate, exterminate, devastate, eradicate, decimate
It's time to level you
It's time to eliminate you
It's time to destroy you

Destroy
It's time to destroy
Destroy
We will destroy
Obliterate, annihilate, exterminate, devastate, eradicate, decimate
