The moon's shadow has disappeared
The sun creates the perfect sphere
Illuminating it appears
Lunar cycle's mid-phase is here

Shining full and bright
It only lasts for three whole nights
The darkness has been filled with light
Now their victims are in sight

The boy who cried wolf has been bitten
The mark of the beast now is written
Ignoring all of your suspicions
Fighting against the superstition

Silver bullets stop transformations
Killing them as beast is no transgression
But taking a human life is a sin
So where does one end and the other begin?

It's time for their feeding
Leaving prey shredded and bleeding
All that remains is what they don't eat
Pick what's behind from between their teeth

The boy who cried wolf has been bitten
The mark of the beast now is written
Ignoring all of your suspicions
Fighting against the superstition

Lycanthropes sadistic scowling
Shape-shifters ferocious murdering
Wolf-like creatures viciously growling
You can hear the werewolves' howling

Call on the spirits of the trees and air
Heat and fire - cold and ice
Melt the bullet - blunt the knife
That they may never harm the beast

Magic circle
Pentagram
Nightshade is on
Your door tonight
The witch's curse
Upon his brow
Feel the yellow
Stare of the moon

When you see the moon's projection
From the blood puddle's reflection
Then you know your turn is coming soon
You've just witnessed the blood moon
You've just witnessed the blood moon
You've just witnessed the blood moon
You've just witnessed the blood moon

Lycanthropes sadistic scowling
Shape-shifters ferocious killing
Wolf-like creatures viciously growling
You can hear the werewolves' howling
