It started just like any morning
Tragedy came without warning
Moments that will live forever
Haunting us with unknown terror

It's the day that won't go away
It's rewind for all mankind!

Bad trip down the memory lane
A constant reminder of our pain
Brain imprints these flashbulb memories
Reminds me of our nation's miseries

It's disgrace to the human race
It's a time that can't be defined
It's the day of... That will change our lives
On the day of... Bleeding stars and stripes!

Traumatized from lasting impressions
Wondering about unanswered questions
IT'S A SCREWED UP WORLD!!!!

[Leads: Bobby Tillotson, Scott Shelby]

It's disgrace to the human race
It's a time that can't be defined
It's the day that won't go away
It's rewind for all mankind!

Emotional recollections
Unforgettable reflections
Dates that live in infamy
Threatened by our enemy
Time capsules that never dissolve
Sleeping giant filled with resolve

It's disgrace to the human race
It's a time that can't be defined
It's the day of... That will change our lives
On the day of... Bleeding stars and stripes!

Traumatized from lasting impressions
Wondering about unanswered...
Unanswered...
Unanswered questions!

Attacks from terrorists have rocked our nation
Unspeakable assassinations
Natural disasters from mother nature
Catastrophes caused by human error

My country 'tis of thee
We lost our freedom and our liberty
We all remember where we were that day
From that moment our lives were never the same
They were never the same!
Our lives were never the same!
NO!
Not the same!
Our lives will never be the same!
Never be the same!
Never be the same!
Never be the same!
NO!
