Most audacious gamble of World War II
Playing for checkmate in one bold move

When they arrived crossfire from all sides
Spun web of death
A macabre game of chess
A macabre web of death

Company A was the suicide wave
Allied invasion now a beach of graves

Troops sacrificed commanders sell their lives
Strikes from the sea bullets ripped casualties

The shock and awe orchestration of violence
D-Day
D-Day
The shock and awe orchestration of violence
D-Day [15x]

Operations Neptune
Nazi tyranny is doomed!

Outflanked defenses begin to fall
War strategy overlord Normandy
The American gamble has just paid off
Crushed enemy glorious victory

The shock and awe orchestration of violence
D-Day
D-Day
The shock and awe orchestration of violence
D-Day [17x]

Orchestration of violence
