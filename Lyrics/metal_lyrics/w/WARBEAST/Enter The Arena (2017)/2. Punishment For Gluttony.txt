What on earth do you take
That makes you act that way?
Are you for real or just a fake?
Your life's one big mistake

Hey you!
Better get out of my way!

Yeah you!
Every dog has his day!

Craving for my binge
You should know that
Heads I lose, tails you win

Overindulgence
You should know that
Heads I win, tails you lose
I will take the world!

And everything that's in it
I'll do it all in one minute
I want what's coming for me
Punishment for gluttony!

Craving for my binge
You should know that
Heads I lose, tails you win

Overindulgence
You should know that
Heads I win, tails you lose
I will take the world

You're all a bunch of fuckin' assholes!
Do you know why? 'Cause you ain't got the
Guts to be what you want to be. You need people
Like me so you can point your fuckin' finger
And say, "That's the bad guy!"

Nothing exceeds like excess
Nothing defeats like depress
I tell the truth when I lie
I can't live until I die

Craving for my binge
You should know that
Heads I lose, tails you win

Overindulgence
You should know that
Heads I win, tails you lose
I will take the world!
