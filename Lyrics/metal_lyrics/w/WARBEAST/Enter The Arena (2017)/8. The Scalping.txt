Infernal shouts and pantomime
Warned us that the fate which had overtaken our
Unfortunate companions not only awaited us, but likewise
The whole race of the hated white man. All the dead,
Without exception, were scalped and the scalps
Still fresh, were dangling from their belts.

Moving through the hill
Native clans upon his heels
Running for his life
Through the wooded think
Fleeing the Apache knife
Barbarous mutilations
Dexterous operations

Racing through the trees
Echoing shrieks of enemies
Dodging axe and arrow
Launched to penetrate
Right to the bone and the marrow

Trespass!
They'll take your scalp
Knocked to your knees you'll fall
Trespass!
They'll take your scalp
The flesh peels from your skull
Twitching eyes roll back in shock
As the head is crowned with tomahawk!

Death cries and dancing ceremonies
War prize scalping human trophies

Untamed and wild frontier
Like a demon born from scorching winds
Prowling a phantom scout watching you
The hunt begins to play out
Barbarous mutilations
Dexterous operations

Tenderfoot trampled sacred grounds
Paleface life force spills to the ground

Trespass!
They'll take your scalp
Knocked to your knees you'll fall
Trespass!
They'll take your scalp
The flesh peels from your skull
Twitching eyes roll back in shock
As the head is crowned with tomahawk!

Your head is clutched and tilted back
The flint rapes your forehead all goes to black
As you bleed out on the planes
Coppery sting washes over your eyes
Crimson sheen of your blood flows by
Hear the crunching scrape echo through your skull
As the blade cuts through your brow
Feel the painful wind as your head is skinned
As you tremble, shriek, and howl
You're left to writhe in pain
The wolves await your remains
Fluid spurts from your face
And it coagulates

The scalping!
