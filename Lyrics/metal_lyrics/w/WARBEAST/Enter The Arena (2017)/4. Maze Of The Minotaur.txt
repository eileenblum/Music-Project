Three sibling rivals
The sons of Zeus
Each wanted to be king
The right to rule
One brother Minos
Offered no truce
He prayed to Poseidon
For a snow-white bull
The god of the sea
Agreed to deliver
This majestic beat
Whose fate was to be sacrificed!
The new king betrayed him
Coveted specimen spared
Earth-shaker was angered
Revenge was
Monstrous form
Labyrinth of gore
Maze of the Minotaur
Maze of the Minotaur
Poseidon plotted
To punish the fool
His wife filled with passion
Her lust increased
The bestial affair
Woman and bull
Unnatural union
Begat the beast
Asterion is born
Shame on the ing
Imprisoned in scorn
Fourteen lives to be sacrificed
There is no escape
No will to survive
He stands before you
Witness to
Monstrous form
Labyrinth of gore
Maze of the Minotaur
Maze of the Minotaur
Theseus arrives
For the ninth year feeding
Pursuing the prize
Through tangled windings
The fate of the hybrid
He'll sleep forever more
Escaping by a thread
And slaying the
Monstrous form
Labyrinth of gore
Maze of the Minotaur
Maze of the Minotaur
