Humble
Refusing the throne bestowed upon him
Bishop
Too modest for this holy title
Virtue
Always fuels the spirit of detraction
Slander
Stains in the name of a pious archdeacon

Callous accusations fester inside
Faith deprivation
Bleak conjuration

Maligned
Powerless to escape incrimination
Honor
Slipping into immoral redress
Outrage
Leading to a terrible solution
Torment
The final result of this transaction

Seek the necromancer for a wretched proposition
Offer up your soul to the son of perdition
Contract inked in blood seals the deal
With the fallen angel
Conjuration with the devil
Deny
Christ and the virgin mother

First man in history to make a pact with the devil
Renouncing the almighty for earthly rewards
Absolution is unlikely for the sin of this exchange
Eternal damnation is the price
To forsake Christ and the virgin mother

Regret
Suffering in agony and terror
Fasting
Sacrifice brings visions of Mary
Confess
Forgive the sin with torn and burning deed
Fever
Falling dead in joyous reprieve
Mother of God can forgive the transgression
In death you will learn if youâre free from possession

Seek the necromancer for a wretched proposition
Offer up your soul to the son of perdition
Contract inked in blood seals the deal
With the fallen angel
Conjuration with the devil
Deny
Christ and the virgin mother
