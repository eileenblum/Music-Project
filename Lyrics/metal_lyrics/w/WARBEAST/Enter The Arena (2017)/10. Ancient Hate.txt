An ancient hate
Comes now the season
Unjust fate
Guessing the reason

Fight them at our gates
Fight them in the skies
Fighting in the heavens
Where Hell never dies

Hot desert winds
Unholy birth
Whirlwind of flames
Scorching the earth

Who believes in the moldy book?
Blind and witless if you take a look
Eye for an eye they hang by hooks
Suffering for each life that they took

Ancient hate
Ancient hate
Ancient hate
Ancient hate

Sheep to the slaughter by shepherds are led
Wondering who is the next to leak red
No one pays heed as the bodies stack up
When will it be enough?

Ancient hate
Ancient hate
Ancient hate
Ancient hate

Shroud of secrets
Temple of lies
Agenda concealed
From prying eyes

With nothing at stake
Lies become truth
Your life is worth nothing
Your death is the proof

Who believes in the moldy book?
Blind and witless if you take a look
Eye for an eye they hang by hooks
Suffering for each life that they took

The children are watching
They're waiting to see
Enslaved they are waiting for the day to break free
With antiquated idols covered in dust
Impotent in their own lust

Ancient hate
Ancient hate
Ancient hate
Ancient hate

Madmen preach murder from pulpits of black
God fires thunder and joins the attack
Believers deceived their prayers are in vain
The joke is on them because God cares not who wins out hedonist game!

Ancient hate will reign!
Ancient hate will reign!
Ancient hate will reign!
Ancient hate will reign!
Ancient hate will reign!
