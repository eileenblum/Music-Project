Southbound loner in the Texas heat
Lookin' for a ride to Hell
Sickening odor of manure and meat
Nauseating thing to smell
Clutching to his dirt stained burlap case
Greasy head and crooked smile
Discolored flesh adorns his face
Birthmark of Hell's child

Best not to pick him up, just let him die out there
The blood lust in his heart is second to none
Don't deliver the man to the house
Where the nightmare never ends
Never give a ride to the devil's wicked son
Hitchhiker

Stoppin' the van by the side of the road
Thumbin' for a ride to Hell
Delusional look in a bloodstained eye
Doesn't bode very well
Polaroid shots are a sick display
Crackpot moments of pride
Watch your image set ablaze
Feeling the hate implied

Best not to pick him up, just let him die out there
The blood lust in his heart is second to none
Don't deliver the man to the house
Where the nightmare never ends
Never give a ride to the devil's wicked son
Hitchhiker

I just live right off this road
You could have dinner with us
The last goddamn hitchhiker
That you'll ever pick up

Guns are no good, gimme the hammer
Old ways are much better
Fuck the gun, just gimme the sledge
That way they die better
They die better!

You like this face
I do all the work

Should've never stopped for the razor slicer
Should've washed off the blood
Should've never picked up the hitchhiker
Should've never opened the door

Best not to pick him up, just let him die out there
The blood lust in his heart is second to none
Don't deliver the man to the house
Where the nightmare never ends
Never give a ride to the devil's wicked son
The hitchhiker
