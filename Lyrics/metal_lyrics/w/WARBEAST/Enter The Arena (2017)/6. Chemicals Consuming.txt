Menacing madman stumbling buzz
Ravings screamed in aimless debunk

Sobering rebellion tames
Exchanged for the misery blame

Regretfully expressed doubts
Transferred dependence mounts

Kill the ill-advised affair
Eyed with predatory air
Chemicals consuming
Driven by flesh of wounding

Handle it all
Like a master
I'm the worst kind
Of disaster
Consumed

Swarthy wench is marked and crude
Perpetual flaws exude

Intentions exposed cryptic ways
Hinted destinations vague

Metamorphosis not pleasing
Callous, confident and sneering

Chemicals consuming
Driven by flesh of wounding

The exchange of beast was neutralization
Disorganized astonishing
Defeatist linkage

Expression of pain wistful and poignant
Domineering cast sad eyes gazing
Driven by flesh

Force for force divorce pushed assuredly
Mental defects of union were suicidal
Nod and drowse
Chemicals consuming
Gaining his identity was beyond corrupt untangling
Exaggerated lies deflate immaturity elate
Chemicals consuming
Driven by flesh of wounding

Handle it all
Like a master
I'm the worst kind
Of disaster

Chemicals consuming
Driven by flesh of wounding
Driven by flesh of wounding
Driven by flesh of wounding
Driven by flesh of wounding
