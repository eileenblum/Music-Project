Tonight we feast
We pray to the beast
Sharpen the blade
The oath that we made

Fallen brothers join
The war-god Mars
Never forget
Our darkened star

Never forget
Never forget

Taking aim
Mace and chain
Blood and thunder
Mayhem reigns

Unleash the hell dogs prepare to fight
Expect no honor or mercy tonight

All exits blocked by a wall of flames
Bonfires set by the die-hard insane

Mayhem reigns
Never forget
Never forget

Molten lead wakes the dead
Tonight we raid
No rules obeyed

Mayhem reigns
Never forget
Mayhem reigns
Never forget of it
