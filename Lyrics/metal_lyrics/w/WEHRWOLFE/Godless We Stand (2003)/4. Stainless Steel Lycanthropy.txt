Enter, this path, of my philosophy. Warzone, terror, hellbound shockwave. Shockwave of death! Beasts of battle standing tall, in a stance of victory. Mindless victims hear my call, all of you shall bleed for me. As the final lights fades from your eyes, you realize your existance was futile. On you, I spit, my cursing serenade. Bloodlust, legions, hell bound shockwave of... Beasts of battle standing tall, in a stance of blasphemy. Those who have betrayed the law, all of you shall scream for me. In a diabolical lunar, metalurigial, lupine metamorphosis. Servants of the lie, shed tears for the lives you waste, hearts filled with dread consumed with the filth you spread. Despair in your eyes, haunting visions of a ghastly hue, your blood you will taste as a reign of bullets shred your face. Beasts of battle standing tall, in a stance of blasphemy. Those who have betrayed the law, all of your, we're beasts of battle one and all hear our chaingun symphony, zeroed in to split your skull. Stainless steel lycanthopy. In a diabolical metalurgical, metamorphisis.
