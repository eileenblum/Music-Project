Festivals of pain within the gloomy night, one shadow lurking tall. In a wake of mourning sorrow blood drips from an iron claw. Allies of the world come forth and hear me now, the time is now to fight. No room in our hearts for fear. Take up arms and bleed for freedom. This is world war! Thousands of your sons, sacrificed on foregin soil, the price taht we pay to witness another day. Calloused.. to all that beg for life. Impervious... to their feeble cries. Chasms... of withered bodies lie. Redemption... redemption denied! Bloodstains and honor, lifes pain no longer. Storming beachheads burning bunkers, fightinng men sent to rush the shores. Soldiers...Forced to kill and die. Chaos...chaos divine. Shards of steel and lead, death is all around, I feel a searing heat, that brings me to the ground. Memories before me, as I gaze up at the sky, memories of the path I've walked. I regret not this life, for as I die my rifle at my feet, my brother shall march on, never to accept defeat.  Allies of the world, come forth and hear me now. The time is now to fight. No room in our hearts for fear. Take up arms and bleed for freedom. This is War! We've come to fucking dominate!
