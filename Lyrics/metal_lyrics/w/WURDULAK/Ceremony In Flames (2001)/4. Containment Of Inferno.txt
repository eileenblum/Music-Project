[Lyrics by Bard Faust]

Hold to the major stance
misled people will be given
no chance
food for vultures, prey for wolves
shattered and ripe, hear their calls

Containment of inferno, night of sword
a gallows in function, all for your lord
jesus is dead, killed by my will
a grip that by all means was
created to kill

Black current trinity
naturalistic satanic consistency
no liberation for the holy man
there is no such thing as a
praised land

Channeling of equent hate
ultimately opposed at any rate
god-given confinement is due
it will surely kill you and
your breed too
