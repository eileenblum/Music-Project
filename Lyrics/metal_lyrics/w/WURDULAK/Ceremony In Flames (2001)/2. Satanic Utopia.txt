[Lyrics by Killjoy]

Tortured cries
echoes of the sadist
gathering strength
evoking eternal fear

Battles won
through holocaust
dreaming of kingdoms
left unconquered

Eviscerated bodies
crippled and killed
blood splattered steel
a testament to will

A smoldering of faith
bittersweet tasted of siege
the spoils of victory
exited among christian
sacrifice
