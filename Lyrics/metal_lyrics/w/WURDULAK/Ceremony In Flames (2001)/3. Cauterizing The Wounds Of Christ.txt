[Lyrics by Killjoy]

Beaten whipped and tortured
nailed upon the cross
halo of thorns driven deeper
no pity for the son of god

To die for nothing
suffering in vain
sins aren't forgiven
forever burning in your name

cauterizing the wounds of christ

Nothing to gain or inherit
persecution only lasts so long
faith grows weaker
the meek are never strong

To die for nothing
suffering in vain
sins aren't forgiven
forever burning in your name

cauterizing the wounds of christ
