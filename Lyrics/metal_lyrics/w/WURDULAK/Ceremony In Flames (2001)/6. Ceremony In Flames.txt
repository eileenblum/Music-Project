[Lyrics By Killjoy]

Sacrificial offering
drapped in holy shrouds
13 candles blazing
conjuring fiendish terror

Born into nothingness
a parasite arrives
capturing the pain of faith
bound and gagged

Through the maze of deceit
the true face of god is
revealed
a beauty in knowing his touch
offering a hand into freedom

Caressed by solitude
a plague of desire
absorbing two thousand years
unleashing human restrictions
