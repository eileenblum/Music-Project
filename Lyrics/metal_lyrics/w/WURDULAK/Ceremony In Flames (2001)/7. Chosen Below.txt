[Lyrics by Killjoy]

Born of the jackal
blessed by sin
worthless servant, abandoned
unseen hands
embrace from the sky
i can hear hell (calling)

Upon the altar 
cast in stone
i invoke the coming of gods
i concede to whore's desire
i am the waiting

Born of the jackal
blessed by sin
i foresee the coming of the end
i can feel the cold touch beyond

Burnt by the sun
for touching god
branded evil
mark of the beast
i am the one chosen below
