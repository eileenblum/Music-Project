[Lyrics by Maniac]

Breathe into my mind
breed inside my flesh
be one of my kind
die if you neglect

I am the electric gene
one who should detect
the rotting skin of sin
your eternal defect

prototype messiah
disgusting creature abandoned
teaching the false gospels
i shall be your depravity

In my hands you're dead, dead
although you're still alive
part of my existence
cancer of earth

die, die, die
i shall not let you
