[Lyrics By Killjoy]

Storming the gates of creation
stained glass shatters
destroy the sacred scrolls
ending the myth of paradise.

Devour the righteous
unarmed and pitiful
no mercy for the weak
slaughter of the innocents

Temples Crumble
wisdom set ablaze
see the world burning
through serpent eyes

Cast the shadow
in a land with no light
apocalyptic reigning
at one with the beast
