[Lyrics by Killjoy]

Piercing the mind's eye
at last a perfect thought
enter those of vacant morals
breaking the will of men
once thought of as invincible 
corrupting the purist form
essence
turning it against it's master

Never again to be owned or
enslaved
expanding into new horizons
gather in unspeakable numbers
outstretched arms assembled
now the answer is clear
acts of contrition left behind
buried beneath perversion
