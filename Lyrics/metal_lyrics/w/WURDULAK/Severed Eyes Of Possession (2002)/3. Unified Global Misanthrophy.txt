No faith in your race
Buried among catacombs and
Veils of deceit
A downward spiral of misery

Look around and penetrate
The minds eye of infinity
A second skin of filth
That never washes away

Stand knee deep in human waste
Endless scenes of despair
To kill yourself is the only way out
Kill your fucking self
