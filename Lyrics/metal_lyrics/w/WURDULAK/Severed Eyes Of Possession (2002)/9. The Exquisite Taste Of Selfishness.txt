Struggling between
Sanity and destruction
Mental ability diminishes

Forcing my mind to betray
Strangling all hope
For a prevalent life

Become the enemy
To my own existence
Entering new levels unknown
I accept my possession
Killing the opposed

Foolish believers
Of hope and prayer
Marching blindly into nothingness

The shall never know
The exquisite taste of selfishness

Become the enemy
To my own desire entering new levels
Blackness overcomes me
