So why are we dynamite
To explore in your feeble minds
To destroy the expansion of conviction
To fulfill our devious benediction
Demon flowers so shall be
The outlook of your disintegration
To be the destroyer of worlds
The words are dead in your mouth

The bonescreen of your believe
Shatter as we fly into your vision
Of rotten flesh and dying opiates
Lust to double barrel kill you
An but what the fuck are you to me
If not a measure of gang green
I truly devote my craving instincts
To more dangerous living than shell shock

To obliterate to truly see
To watch the downfall of pity
To see beyond to never live
To be the affliction reflection
And so you die tonight my love
For all your pretty sins
And watch the christfigure unfold
To pornography as medical advice

And then as we are dynamite
You fold your bleeding hands
And we walk in square blood meters
And laugh and laugh and laugh
Oblivion was never an option
Fish hooks in your vacant dreams
You're lust part of our vision
Oblivion was never an option
