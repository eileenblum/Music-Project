Incubus stationed at my left
Breath of life beyond recollection
Morbid zephlyns becoming kings
Excessive nature
Land into the mighty beast
Driven by hatred
Life long existence now extinct

They shall wither unwarned
Touched into deaf ears
Swallows of obedience
Tainted wonders never cease

Death has come
Marched into hell
By perfidious minions
