Sovereign is dying
Lifeless cold and blue
Virgin summoned
Lay upon his corpse

The stench of decay
Incense for the watchers
Eager to feed
Off the sin

Share the warmth
From her fair skin
Aroused and cold from the lips
Of a cadaver

Disciples begin to breed
Raping seeds from the body
Reincarnating their beliefs

Arisen from death
Sacrificial offering
Sovereign reborn
Through the blood of the pure

Implant the rotting organs
Souls of the living damned
Anger to feed from
The taste of sin
