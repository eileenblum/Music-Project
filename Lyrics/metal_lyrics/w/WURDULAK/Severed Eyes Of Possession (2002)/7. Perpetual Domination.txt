Open blind eyes
To the ways of old
Substandart morals
Foundation for the wear

Let me free your mind
Programmed thoughts
Christian cancer

Victims lost and left for dead
Begin a new dawn of redemption
It's there for the taking
A willing sacrifice

Let me free your mind
Programmed thoughts
Christian cancer

Perpetual domination
Perpetual domination

Soul is born indifferent
Fallen from breathless god
Vanity and ignorance
Virgin to king

Let me free your mind
Programmed thoughts
Christian cancer

Beckon forth desires
Suffer the weak lambs
Breath into my form
Blessed by the lost of trinity

Let me free your mind
Programmed thoughts
Christian cancer
