In my mind eye my thoughts
Light fires in your cities

The shadows of wrath
Embrace my soul
Forcing forward
Knowing no remorse

To live with pain
Fuels my desire
Weakness long forgotten
Abandoned on killing fields
Eye of the devil
Guides my way
Through frost and fire
Through darkness and desire

Storms of darkness
Feed my will
Blood gathered in battle
Memories of the last kill

I wear my fatherland soil
No matted where I die
