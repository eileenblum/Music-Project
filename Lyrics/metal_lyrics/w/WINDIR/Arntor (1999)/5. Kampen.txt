FÃ¸ste gaongen di kom va ra med kvite krist Ã¥ krÃ¥ss,
maonge ao Ã¥ss nekta Ã¥ ta imot dinna bysle krist,
men nÃ¥ken ao Ã¥ss svikta. Jor Ã¥ stidling i stan fÃ¸r haidn skjikk.
No mao mi ao Ã¥ lima, ain kamp mot kristne fanta.
Torshammaren vart knuste, irstatta me ain krÃ¥ss.
Sjonging ao tona, irstatta me bysle or.
Bloting fÃ¸bÃ¥e, irstatta me gustineste.
HÃ¥vi vart brende, irstatta me kjÃ¸rkje.
No mao mi ao Ã¥ lima, ain kamp mot kristne fanta.
Dan andre gaongen di kom va ra so bedrevitara me sokadla konnskap.
Maonge ao Ã¥ss nekta Ã¥ verta so byfanta, nÃ¥ken ao Ã¥ss svikta.
Status Ã¥ innpass i stan fÃ¸r sont bondevit.
No mao mi ao Ã¥ lima, ain kamp mot byfanta.
Hauga Ã¥ vÃ¥dla fÃ¸svinde, store bygj Ã¥ bue.
Spraoke vaort vert utvatna, ao ti Ã¥, i ti e.
Bjor Ã¥ laug, ti sÃ¸te vin Ã¥ rapavatn.
FjÃ¸sbrok Ã¥ trisko, ti vie brÃ¸ke Ã¥ tÃ¥skne sko.
No mao mi ao Ã¥ lima, ain kamp mot byfanta.

[English translation:]

[The Battle]

The first time they came was with Jesus Christ and crosses
Many of us refused to accept this weak god
some of betrayed, land and positions,
instead of Heathen customs

Now we have to gather, a battle against Christian bastards

Thor's hammer was crushed, replaced with a cross
Singing and tones, replaced with weak words
Blot was forbidden, replaced with religious service
holy places were scorched, replaced with churches

Now we have to gather, a battle against Christian bastards

The second time the came, was as know-it-alls with so-called knowledge
Many of us refused to become like city-men
some of us betrayed, status and foothold
instead of the true common sense

Now we have to gather, a battle against city bastards

hills and fields disappeared, big buildings and houses
Our language was thinned out: ao to Ã¥, and i to e
mead and beer, to sweet wine and soft drinks
barns pants and clogs, to wide pants and idiotic shoes

Now we have to gather, a battle against city bastards
