A vague shadow lurking in the dark,
A sane man's worst nightmare,
A vision containing death,
As a wake in honour of himself,
For equal sane mortals,
It's a nightmare becoming real,
But I, I see it as the Final clause of a neverending deal,
I embraced my vision, as it was common for me,
A fate, a destiny, an inevitable early death
Finally I'm dead,
And the vision is revealed for everyone else
