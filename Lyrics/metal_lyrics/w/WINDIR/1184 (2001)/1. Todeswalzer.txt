Dying with sorrow not in hand,
Welcoming my gods, an equal I am,
A travel awaits before me,
Encircled as a God, dead as a man,

An era has now ended,
But a new era will come,
While my destiny fulfills itself,
I glance at the world with wisdom from the end,

My efforts will now be rewarded,
As I enter Kingdom Come,
My hate will now get fatal
For those that disapproved me once,

With my misanthropic these soon brought to life,
I'll see an definite end for weak, feeble minds,

As I die I'll go further, further than any other man,
To obtain powers and wisdom as a God from the other end,

My death will be revenged with fury of the damned,
My eternal life will be praised by the gods at the end.

"Wenn ich tot bin, werde ich weitergehen, weiter als jemand.
Um Kraft und Weisheit zu erreichen, wie einen Gott vom anderen Ende."
[English translation:
As I die I'll go further, further than any other man,
To obtain powers and wisdom as a God from the other end]
