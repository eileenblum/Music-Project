It is he who holds the power -
It is he who reflects the will -
It is he who reigns the masses -
It is he who urges to win -
It is he who lights the fire -
It is he who controls the flame -
It is he who breeds hatred -
It is he who withstands pain -
The endless gap between servant and lord will grow stronger within us all -
It is he who decides the course -
It is he who takes the step -
It is he who moves forward -Â 
It is he who worship himself -
The endless gap between servant and lord will grow stronger within us all -
From order raises chaos,
In chaos there is progression,
In the ruins of man's ashes,
Sprouts the resurrection,
A dark narcissistic dimension,
A new world to come,
The end of civiliasation,
The arrival of the Spiritlord -
It is he who lights the fire -
It is he who controls the flame -
It is he who breeds hatred -
It is he who withstands pain -
Altered perception a moral decay,
A feast for the vultures circling over their prey,
No care for others an individual war,
Where you are enslaved or become the Spiritlord.
