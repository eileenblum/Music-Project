The Mountain of Goats I shall reign
A sight where hate gains
A sight where evil reigns
The mountain of Goats

Under the sign of the Devil
Chanting our song to reach a new level
Preparing a kingdom worthy a throne
Seated by me, me alone

With rape as means I'll breed
Securing the throne with the sperm that we need
My throne will survive with terror and fear
Constant aware that the traitors are near

A path of evil a river of blood
Shed for me because I'm God
Unleash the Devil within me
All this for me because I am the King

On the Mountain of Goats I shall reign
Hordes will toture and kill in my name
My kingdom and throne will  continue to grow
As the Devil continues to feed on my soul
