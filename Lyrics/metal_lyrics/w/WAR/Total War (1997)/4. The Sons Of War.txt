Carry with you my anger and hate
Be strong and avenge my death always
Bear with you my darkest thoughts
And punish every weak drop of gods blood

Carry with you the memories of our brotherhood
Be wise and let none cross you on your way
Bear in mind that are born of Satan's power
And finally let our dreams come true

We are the sons of Satan
We are the sons of war
Brothers united by evil
To extinguish the fucking world

Carry with you my words and immortalize 'em
Be brave and never give up our cause
(Bear me with you in your thoughts
And kneel in front of our common warlord)

(Watch me sit there at Satan's side
Be evil and show no fucking mercy
Bear in your heart the never ending fire
And the fatal darkness will await)

We are the sons of Satan
We are the sons of war
Brothers united by evil
To extinguish the fucking world
