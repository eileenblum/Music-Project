Keep on thinking about tomorrow
Keep on pleading your future
Thinking of battle that nights bring (???)
(???) your another way (???) will die

There's no future
nor there's any way to hide

There's no way we will (???)
There's no way your heaven in mercy
Look in our eyes and know there's no way
to (???)

There's no future
nor there's any way to hide

You keep on saying you will win
You keep on hoping that you will be free
Thinking about those stupid (???)
Save your nun (???) to die

There's no future
nor there's any way to hide

There's no way (???)
There's no way escaping
Look in my pace and you'll find out
That we are reapers of Satan

There's no future
nor there's any way to hide
We are the reapers of Satan
nor there's no way to hide
