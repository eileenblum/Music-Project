Arsenal stacked
With weapons of
Mass destruction.
Ignited minds
Of a hostile generation.
There ain't no mercy
You write your own fate.
Shedding blood for glory,
For honour and respect.

This is war.
Fight for your freedom,
Your country's pride.
This is war.
Old people talking
While young men die.

A medal of honour
For valiant display.
National colours
Wrapped around
The body of the fallen.
Lay down your life
At the altar of mors.
Glorifying death
For some malevolent 'cause.

This is war.
Corporate sharks
For their cheap thrills.
This is war.
Making your soldiers
Fight and kill.

This is war!

The finger on trigger,
The target within the range.
Peace is an illusion
A far-fetched distant mirage.
