The unrelenting surge
Of power and authority.
The battlefield reeks
Of blood and insanity.
Ally arsenal destroyed.
Hopes of men devastated.
The infantry in its last stride.
"Surrender or be dead!"

Big guns blazing,
Tanks destroyed.
And retreat
Is the only friendly cry.
When all is lost
And sacrificed,
The glory and pride
Too shall die.

Mortal slaughter.
Denial of destiny.
The challenge for power.
Devastated infinity.

As the bodies pile up,
Their fates are sealed.
Mayhem follows madness,
In a blood-soaked battlefield.

Coffins of the brave fallen.
The memory remains.
The unrelenting surge
Shall begin again

...to regain lost glory.
