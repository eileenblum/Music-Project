Fight!

First in the line of fire.
The bravest of the brave.
Fear they have conquered,
Their resolve never caves.

Charging at full throttle
Towards eternal glory.
War paint. Battle cries.
The messengers of misery.

Marching into battle
Staring death in the eye.
Victory they were promised.
All just blatant lies.

Charge!

The first attack
At the break of dawn,
Into enemy territory.
Misguided by propaganda,
For a shot at creating history.

Shots fired. Lives taken.
Warriors laid to rest.
Sacrificial lambs they were.
Bravery put to test.

Not a sign of weakness.
Neither losing a breath.
The vanguard keeps on charging
Towards the horizon,
Defending the false sense of pride
And honour 'til death.

As the day ends
The bodies burn.
Ashes fill up the air.
Somewhere in a corner,
A lonely mother sheds a tear.
