Inside out, upside down...
Reality is killing me
It's all a blur and it's moving fast
Doing 95, still I end up last
No time to stop or even slow down
Expectations are far too high
My machinery got to keep spinning around
('Round and around)

Won't you listen to me once, only once
There is no way for me to be everywhere
I know you're sad but I hope you're waiting
Time is not a friend these days so please understand!

(Inside out, upside down
Reality is killing me
It's all a blur and it's moving fast
Doing 95, still I end up last)
No time to stop or even slow down
Expectations are far too high
My machinery got to keep spinning around
('Round and around)

As I race through my life, I am crying
For I know what I'm losing
Helpless I look away

Running from his past life, still trying to forget it
But now today has come here to slow him while he's running
The challenge of remembering the things that are important
It seems to be the ending of something he was winning
A young boy meets the grown world, a grown man meets the memories
A fact that leads to losing the one thing that's important
His loved one waits a long time but that can't be forever
And when the dance is over he finds himself so lonely and weak

(My life's truth must be unseen as
I race through the now at full speed)

As I raced through my life, I was crying
I knew what I was losing
Helpless I looked away
Now my life's cold and barren again
I'm the child from my past life
Helpless I release the memories
