Through all these years the truth has been a stranger to me
We met many times but never got to know each other
I was used and fed with lies by who I thought were you
I left my way of life to be all you said were true
Now all this sadness washes over me and I feel like I'm drowning
I tried to call for help but the only thing I could feel was misery...
I did now want to walk alone through this barren wasteland
You turned your back on me when I reached out
It's all clear to me, it's you who choose to leave us here
There's no use in looking back since I know you won't appear
"I am the lord thy god..."
Blindly I would follow you as you preached to me your truth
I climber your mountain a million times
I was told I needed you to behold your enlightened view
I know now there is nothing there to see
I renounce your divinity
Slowly I woke up, slowly I saw
The lies you told faded away
A water was rising, the water was truth
It washed away the dirt of you as it washed away all that was true
Now all this sadness washes over me and I feel like I'm drowning
I've tried to call for help but the only thing I can feel is misery...
I hope that sadness washes over you and you find yourself drowning
And when you call for help from the ones you hurt
The answer will be one of silence...
