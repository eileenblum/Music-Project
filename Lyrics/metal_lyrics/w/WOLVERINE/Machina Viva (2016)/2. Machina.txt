Wide awake
I'm endlessly drifting
Weightless...
Heavily...

This world
All you are
Arrested conformity
Turning endlessly

I watch myself travel by
All we are has never been
Cycles everything

Trivial mind
Escaping time
Fighting for a definite end
Conform me again

I am you... [4x]

[2x]
Back inside the wheel in time
Never to revert outside
Externally

There's no way out
This spiral of monotony
You cannot deny me
Because I am you...
