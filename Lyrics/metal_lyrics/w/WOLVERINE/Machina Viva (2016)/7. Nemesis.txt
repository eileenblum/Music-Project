I fade away again and more you gain
This dark or light, black or white lingers on  
As I die I watch you live
You sure will find your way somehow
You have toâ¦I had toâ¦I lay me down again

I see myself in you as you see me
You have your ways and I have mine, it's all the same  
When I'm gone, your wish complete 
There will always be another one
I know youâ¦You know youâ¦There's always more of youâ¦

Wasted all this time, I walked for miles away from you
Wasted all this time, I walked for miles away from you

I pay no mind to life, we have it all
Our natural law, the fragile fall, you remainâ¦
Where there's crop, the eager feeds 
The more one has, the more one wants
I know youâ¦I see youâ¦There's always more for youâ¦

Wasted all this time, I walked for miles away from you
Wasted all this life, I walked for miles away from you
