They say that time will heal, that life is all but real
You see my worlds collide, a happy man so sad
I know the fire is safe, inside the icy shell
A place where you canât see, thatâs where Iâd rather be

In this world of conformity, I know thereâs no place for me
I stand here on the edge, see my face reflect
A well of eternity but it pains too much to see
A lock you canât unlock, a key thatâs mine to keep

See the trail through time and space
Find your way Iâll meet you there
