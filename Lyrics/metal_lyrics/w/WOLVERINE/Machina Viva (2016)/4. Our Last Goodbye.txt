All is grey, the sun has died
No wind today, my breath aside
Our last goodbye, you turned into 
A poisoned lie, I could not see through

Jaded hearts, fading beats
A life apart, a grand old start
Pouring rain followed him
Filled with pain from his domain

As I lie alone tonight
The sky allures in white
And I fly into the unknown void of silence
Leave the cries behind, I am freeâ¦ âtil I wake from my dream

Tonight Iâll be there by my window, watching the people below
So many stories of sorrow, so many endings to know
How come that I feel so alone
And that all that I see is my pain?

No oneâs there as Iâm falling
A dying glare sees me crawling
Falling in love is the reason I live and I die
I waitâ¦in silence I will rebuild my strength

Time goes by so fast
My love, weâre now a memory 
A memory Iâll always keep safe
Moments in time look like raindrops that fall 
On a windshield that travels a rainy night
Let it rainâ¦

As I lie alone tonight
Leave the cries behind, I am freeâ¦âtil I wake from my dream

Tonight Iâll be there by my window, watching the people below
So many stories of sorrow, so many endings to know
How come that I feel so alone
And that all that I see is my pain?
Millions are those who have spoken, millions are those left unheard
Looking for that which was broken, something not found in a word
How come that you seem so alone
Though you tell them he comforts your pain?
