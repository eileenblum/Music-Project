Turned around and you were gone, in spite of our promises
Shadows scattered by your hand, linger just down the hall
Silently Iâm suffocating in this void of yours
Grasping life, remembering how you made me feel alive

Crying in silence, all out of words
Fire embraced all I was, all I saw
Burned me from inside, leaving nothing but this pile of ash

Heard you laughed the other day, echoes of our hollow memories
Guess I know that time will heal all the wounds, barely leaving scars

Healing in silence, all out of words
Fire embraced all I was, all I saw
Burned me from inside, leaving nothing but this pile of ash
Rising from a fertile ground, all I was Iâm sure I will become again
Smiling in silence, Iâm holding back the words

The fire embraced all I was, all I saw
It burned me from inside, nurturing the ground I died upon
Finally I see through the shroud, Iâm finding air despite the void
The fire of you, the ashes of meâ¦they set me freeâ¦
