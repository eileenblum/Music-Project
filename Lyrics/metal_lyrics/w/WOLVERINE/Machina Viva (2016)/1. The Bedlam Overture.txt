Silent screaming words, offering our lives a way
A perfect smile for all to see
Lingers everywhere, travels where horizons blend
A grand design to hold as true

Strangers gazing west, faceless shadows on a screen
A distant comfort, silent cries
Death is just a word, stripped from meaning long ago
All thatâs near we hold as dear

Love is their disease, beyond a cure they gloat in sin
All the while they die
Color taints their mind, their savage hearts for us to see
Our kinds roam different lands

Breatheâ¦just breatheâ¦close your eyes a while
Stillness lies buried within your own mind

Sheâs drowning now, her life is swept away
All silent now, her body in decay
[4x] (Airâ¦Breatheâ¦Lifeâ¦)

Take a moment now, time to make a choice
Past soon turns into a faded memory 
Weâve gone too far, let go
See the weight of lunacy fall to the ground
Candle flames have turned into a raging fire
By winds put to words
Well of reasoning, calling for discovery
To flush sins of our deeds awayâ¦

Breatheâ¦just breatheâ¦close your eyes a while
Stillness lies buried within your own mind

Upon this hollow ground we need to start again
Bridge infernal depths, rebuild the realms we kept
Fight the urge to hide, find the vows that died
Upon this hollow ground we need to start again
Eyes upon the world beyond illusive screens
Now the blood red sky cries for reasons why
