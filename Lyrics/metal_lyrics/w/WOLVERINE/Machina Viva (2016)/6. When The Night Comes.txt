And you stare into a gloomy distance 
Of a place you thought was ahead of you 
But now the winding road seems never ending... Tonight...
You pray that the stars will light the way for you 
When the night gets dark and the cold unknown 
Comes your way to ensure your endingâs tonight...

I'll be there, watching every move they make
I'll be there whispering words to ease your pain all through the nightâ¦

When the night comes and the coldness numbs your mind
All your deepest fears find you running motionless
When the night comes and the nightmares come to life
All you drag behind slows you down trying, running
Youâll die trying, runningâ¦

Coldness seeks to slow your every move
Trading secrets with your loneliness
Watchful rest, keep that fire burning tonightâ¦
And though when it all just seems too much to bare
When the night is there and you're all alone
Your weariness can never be your mistress tonight...

The pain of leaving behind (A pain that shall set you free)
And journey on through the wild (Defying the cries of the night)
Defining trades of a life (A lifetime to show)
As you scare off the darkness tonight...

I'll be there, watching every move they make
I'll be there whispering words to ease your pain all through the nightâ¦

When the night comes and the coldness numbs your mind
All your deepest fears find you running motionless
When the night comes and the nightmares come to life
All you drag behind slows you down trying, running
Youâll die trying, running awayâ¦
When the night comes and coldness numbs your mind
Iâll whisper words to keep you awakeâ¦
When the night comes to suffocate your fire
Iâll be there watching, waitingâ¦to set you on your wayâ¦
