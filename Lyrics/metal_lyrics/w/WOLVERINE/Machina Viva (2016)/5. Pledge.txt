The reality of all I imagined was all of a sudden so obvious and so damn vigorous
The chains that kept me at bay all those years, they were lifted and ultimately destroyed
Iâd been saved by the one

For better or worse, through sickness and health
Burden of her devotion
There 'til the end, death do us part 
Devoured by her emotions

Trapped in a running wheel we ran towards something we would never reach
Still bound by our promises, old chains were simply replaced by new
Our desire to ascend just left us all the more confined

For better or worse, through sickness and health
Burden of her devotion
There Â´til the end, death do us part 
Devoured by her emotions

You will need to let go though darkness descends all around
I must travel alone from here

In the name of our pledge, with the force of past
Grasping my last breath
In the name of our pledge
All I ever was has nailed me to this cross

(Silence... Laughterâ¦ Breathingâ¦ Fadingâ¦)
Silence is screaming my name
In laughter it hides
Breathing life in our bond 
Fading againâ¦

In the darkness of tonight, dancing shadows on the wall
Hiding from the light, into the night, darkness to light
In the coldness of the dawn, breathing faintly once again
Nurtured by the light, into the fight, into the blight
Canât you see Iâm weary, fighting for my life?
Youâre so much more, thinking you should know by now
Why wonât you see?
Your essence is tearing apart content of your own heart

You will need to let go though darkness descends all around
I must travel alone

In the name of our pledge, with the force of past
Grasping my last breath
In the name of our pledge
All we ever were will die
In the name of our pledge, with the force of past
Grasping my last breath
In the name of our pledge
All I ever was has nailed me to this cross
