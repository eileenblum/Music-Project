So many memories, I recall
Wish I could do it all again
All of those years, have come to pass too soon
Part of me dies with our demise

Try to speak but I canât find the words
(Echoes are all that remain)
Wave goodbye to all I thought Iâd be
(While dusk tells of new found love)
Guess itâs time to go, time to leave the past behind
(Leave the past behindâ¦)
Time to face the truth and let go of whatâs to hold

All these tears of mine celebrate our deed
They are a token of what we achieved
Sorrow and pride, chaos and peace of mind
Bitter and sweet, weâre moving on

Try to speak but I canât find the words
(Echoes are all that remain)
Wave goodbye to all I thought Iâd be
(While dusk tells of new found love)
Guess itâs time to go, time to leave the past behind
(Leave the past behindâ¦)
Time to face the truth and let go of whatâs to hold

The road ahead has many ends
Where weâll end up we still donât know
Iâll be proud as I travel, proud of what I am leaving

Now thereâs no time to be afraid
Weâll see the future eye to eye
I donât care what tomorrow brings
I strongly believe in who I am

Now when I speak I finally find the words
(A poet that lives by his rhyme)
Wave hello to who I came to be
(While dawn tells of new found love)
Now itâs time for me, time to see with open eyes
(See with open eyesâ¦)
Time to face the truth and embrace whatâs there to hold
