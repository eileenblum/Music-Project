Sadly aware Iâm part of what I concider nothing
Suffocating us while we pretend weâre blind
Before tired eyes, those who cling to nothing
We embrace the echoes of our hollow souls

Values of life have changed currency somehow
Pockets lined with greed and shallow smiles of need
Somewhere we lost sight of who we are
Now more is more, less is nothing

All we need is âneedâ, a glass full of âmeâ
As we toast to madness we find fulfillment in
All this wealth is deafening, deafening our minds
As we all stray further into the great nothingâ¦

(Hereâs to health, hereâs to wealth)
Corroded, corruptedâ¦ I sell my soul again
(Hereâs to health, hereâs to wealth)
Infected, dissectedâ¦ I sell myself and die

Trapped in my addiction, outside looking in
The sound of silence, colours fade to grey
My remorse is not enough, I have gone too far
Iâve reached the end of my winding road

Now that Iâve bared my weakness to you
I beg of you to hear me; never follow me
See how my fragile shell is breaking
I beg of you to see me, see the great King Nothing

(Hereâs to health, hereâs to wealth)
Corroded, corruptedâ¦ I sell my soul again
(Hereâs to health, hereâs to wealth)
Infected, dissectedâ¦ I sell myself and die

(Hereâs to health, hereâs to wealth)
Corroded, corruptedâ¦ I sell my soul again
(Hereâs to health, hereâs to wealth)
Infected, dissectedâ¦ I sell myself and die
