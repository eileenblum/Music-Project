Thereâs a war inside you
And I canât escape the ground
Iâm losing my lifeline
Because you just canât face the truth

Your face deceives me
You tie me with your words
Fall on your own stones
But still itâs my mistake

Forgive meâ¦ Forgive me for your sinsâ¦

I want to ease your pain
But you turn your head away
I found you in your rain
But you canât find me

This stupid game weâre playing
You know we both will lose
Locking all your doors
No one gets in, no one gets out

Please release the rope that holds me
So I can reach your mind
Thereâs something holding me
Oh, thereâs someone holding me

Forgive meâ¦ Forgive me for your wordsâ¦

I want to ease your pain
But you turn your head away
I found you in your rain
But you canât find me
I want to ease your pain
But you turn your head away
I found you in your rain
But you canât find me

I want to ease your painâ¦
I found you in your rainâ¦
I want to ease your painâ¦
I found you in your rain
But you canât find meâ¦
