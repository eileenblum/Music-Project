Slowly her blood will kill him
Dying upon the leaves of poison
Body and mind

Helpless I watch him leave us
Lurking in utter darkness
Hiding from his past and his pride

Sadly Iâve been where you are so I know that
All the things you think you know and
All the things you say you love are just
Lullabies at night, echoes of her lies

You donât see it, pretend youâre blind
Youâre afraid of what you might find
You need her poison to numb your mind
A victim of her barren soilâ¦

Donât fear your own conviction
Donât be a remnant of her craving
Distinguish life from lies

I know you hurt just the way she hurts
I know she cries just the way you cry
But what you never share is that one smile

Trust me; Iâve been where you are so I know that
All the things you think you know and
All the things you say you love are just
Lullabies at night, echoes of her cries

Donât live her lie, youâre not blind
No need to fear what you will find
Drain her poison out of your mind
Donât be the victim of her barren soulâ¦
