All these changes Iâve been wanting
Greet my morning and Iâm thinking
Am I a blessed one? How did I get this far?

Could it be that Iâm a changed man and that Iâm finally breaking free?
Free from all of my illusions that I would never be enough
Could it be that Iâm just fine the way Iâve always been?
Could it be that Iâm alright despite the flaws that Iâve seen and livedâ¦

Iâve been hiding for a lifetime
Never wanted to be found but
Somehow I dared to be more than I thought I was

The life I lived in silence was my padded prison cell
I would never find a way back as far as I could tell
It was all so stillâ¦ I was all so stillâ¦

I remember how I stumbled towards
A tranquil fate of living by the will of others
I waited for something much moreâ¦

I waited for something much moreâ¦
I waited for something much moreâ¦

Donât live afraidâ¦ Donât live ashamedâ¦
Donât live in waitâ¦ The road is yours to walkâ¦
