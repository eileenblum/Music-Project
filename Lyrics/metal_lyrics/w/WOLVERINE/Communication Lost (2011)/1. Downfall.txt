"I saw you die
when you reached out to touch dreams transparent.
Yet you were always one step behind.
Life exhausted, will extinct.
The spark, your inner flame, faded away,
and the sound of rattling leaves, of grass,
motion by the wind, gently subsided.
And although you were descending, you did not know it.
This was a life lost. This was your downfall."
