You changed all that I am
Once you opened your eyes
Right there I turned off the world
And then there were you and I

Whole again, you have defined who I am
Innocence helps me retain what I am

One breath was all they required
To deprive us all of our bliss
Right there I saw you were lost
And there wouldnât be another âusâ

I fell and I fell, into a dark and bottomless pit
Darkness embraced my whole world

Iâll trade you my life, spare you my heart
Without you I still would be lost, Iâd drown in an ocean
I am you, you are me, we cannot part
A futureâs embrace clad with hope is oursâ¦

Slowly dark clouds dispersed
Offered a passage of life
And they gave us a reason to carry on
What we believed wouldnât be suddenly was

Iâll trade you my life, spare you my heart
Without you I still would be lost, Iâd drown in an ocean
I am you, you are me, we cannot part
A futureâs embrace clad with hope is oursâ¦

Dark clouds will shadow the roads weâll be walking
And questions will challenge our minds and our hopes
But Iâm sure that devotion and faith will make darkness subside
For the power of love is embodied and born in our strong embraceâ¦
