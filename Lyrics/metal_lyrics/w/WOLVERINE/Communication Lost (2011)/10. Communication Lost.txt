How many times do we have to end up here?
Itâs all but a secret, weâre slowly tearing ourselves apart
Iâm so tired of everything thatâs going on
Wish I could turn back time and return to our innocence

Constantly raping the boundaries we have set
Itâs each to his own in a battle of egos weâve fought for so long
Seems there is no way out of this
Weâll die to stand our ground

I do remember that there was a dream
Innocence united us, we grew stronger

Iâve cried a thousand times in despair of what we are
Reduced to slaves in the world of the silent no
Iâve tried a thousand times to believe in what we were
All I find is a communication lost

All I want for us is to get along, return that innocence again
All that we were to be what we are
We have wasted too much time, that fight ainât worth the price
By now weâve lost enough, letsâ bring this to an endâ¦

How do we end this, escape the battlegrounds?
Weâve fought in this war for so long, did we forget how to forgive?
All of the answers linger in shadows unknown
But with our last ounce of strength we need to askâ¦

I do remember that there was a dream
Innocence united us, we grew stronger

Iâve cried a thousand times in despair of what we are
Reduced to slaves in the world of the silent no
Iâve tried a thousand times to believe in what we were
I lost my faith, told myself you could never know
Iâve cried a thousand times in despair of what we are
Immersed in tears, I drown in its silent flow
Iâve tried a thousand times to believe in what we were
All I find is a communication lost
