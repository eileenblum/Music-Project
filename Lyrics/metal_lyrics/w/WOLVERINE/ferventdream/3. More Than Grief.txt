[Music - M.Zell]
[Lyrics - S.Zell/M.Losbjer]

Your face etched in my mind
Replaces all my control

Turned to more than grief
The loss of his life inhaled

My dream, to dream again
Help me, stranger take my hand

And when hope speaks to him
The promise turns to a lie

All his life he's been looking for a life
All his life he's been searching for a light
All the pain inside shows on the outside
And he still tries to complete the last of his dreams

Crucifixion just erased my tries
Science fiction may bring me back to my life

My face etched in your mind?
My fate laid in your hands?

There in his mind she lies
But in his heart it is right

I'll try, try to break through
Your walls of self deceit

Still he'll try, find a way
A guide to take him away

More than grief, no belief
More than grief, self deceit
