[Lyrics - S.Zell]

An old wooden bridge covered with
The presence of fall
And there I stood, I dared not cross,
Afraid to lose it all

Beneath the promise of a quiet place frightened me
But now the wind has spoken again
And marked the trail I could
Not see

And through the mist she calls my name,
The one that leads me
And when I feel the falling rain,
She shelters me from pain

Sometimes the memories return and once again I am lost
In that shrouded place
I'm staring down into the still water
So black

Then through the mist she calls my name,
The one that leads me
And when I feel the falling rain,
She shelters me from pain

Almost like whispers on the wind
She carries my soul and I fall to my knees
My past slowly drifts away
So that life can turn to day

Don't need to say a word
(Silence can be gold)
From moments have I learned
(Change is what she'll hold)

And through the mist she calls my name,
The one that leads me
And when I feel the falling rain,
She shelters me again

Don't need to say a word
'Cause silence can be gold
From moments have I learned,
Change is what she'll hold

6-9-1-9-6...
