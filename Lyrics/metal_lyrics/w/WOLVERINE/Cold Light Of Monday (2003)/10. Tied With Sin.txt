"Finally I've paid the price I always knew I'd had to pay
And with all these visions of my past surrounding me
It's no question why
I never dared to ask myself why I should let them feed on me
I chose the easy way of hiding deep inside and flee"

"This aching pain inside of me is something I must learn to live
No confessions will undo my sins; I destroyed my life and the one within
If only I had dared back then to reach inside and trust my strength
I never knew I had it in me or was it I refused to see?"

Reality has finally shattered all of her innocence
All she was and lived has now come crashing upon her
She once had such porcelain eyes, sadly unable to see through the lies

"Here, tied with my sin and my pain, it's all so clear to me
I see now that life, as I knew it, was just a lie covered in shame"

"Still that lie is a part of me, am I really able to break free?
I'm afraid this craving will be my cell, the place my soul will be laid to rest
Will I dare to face the enemy, take control and set me free?
Or take the easy way of hiding deep inside and flee?"

Reality has finally shattered all of here innocence
All she was and lived has now come crashing upon her
She once had such porcelain eye, sadly unable to see through the lies

"Here, tied with my sin and my pain, it's all so clear to me
I see now that life, as I knew it, was just a lie covered in shame
But still, wise from the truth, can I leave the place I called my own?
I guess life, as I never knew it, has forced me to face my worst enemy... my fear..."
