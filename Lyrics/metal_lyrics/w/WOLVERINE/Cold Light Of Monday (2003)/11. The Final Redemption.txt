Now that I've lost you and failed in every way,
And I've given the last of faith to chance
It tears my soul to face my failure
And to know what it finally ended in...

Here I am, lost but so much wiser than I ever was before
Through the pain of the price I paid to open my eyes
I am reminded to keep myself chained to the wall of life

Losing you was to be my final redemption...

All this warmth present in this one place of fear and pain
Makes me think that black and white could easily melt into one
So kind and gentle is the touch of the ones I used to fear
Please grant me strength to face my saviours, take their hands and offer my confession

Here I am, lost but so much wiser than I ever was before
And though I'm lost, led astray by me, I'm on my way back home...
Through the pain of the price I paid to open my eyes
I am reminded to keep myself chained to the wall of life
Everywhere that I look I stare into misery
I am reminded to stay on the road that I left so long ago

Losing you was to be my final redemption...
