"How I've longed for this... for my loneliness to die
There's no need to be afraid the enemy has been slain today"

"All this trust I found keeps me hanging on to life
There's a place I never saw hidden deep inside myself"

There's so much more to this than what she knows
She fails to see the truth through served
The blind led by a blind into despair
Despair dressed in a vow of joy...

"Free a last... I've found some of my own kind
Together we will fly away, here comes that rush again..."
