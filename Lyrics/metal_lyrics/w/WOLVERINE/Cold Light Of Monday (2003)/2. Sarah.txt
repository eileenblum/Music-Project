Sweet little Sarah, dressed in innocence
Trying hard to hide the tears running down her face
Sweet little Sarah, all scared inside
In the middle of a nightmare, wide awake...
Though a long time ago, the memories are all so vivid...

The girl they all knew is fading away
She's turning black inside
Victim of indifference and betrayal
A mere shadow of her past
Crawling beneath the feet of our world

Inside her scream the echoes of them laughing
She's got nowhere to run or hide
Look at her porcelain eyes, they're breaking
Oh, she is breaking!
Right here, beneath the feet of our ignorance

"Scream for us, bleed for us
make your way into yourself"
"Crawl away, hide away
turn around and see us laugh"

(Let us break those porcelain eyes
And pound our words right through your skull)
"Pour your life into wide open hands,
and see it soak into the ground"

(Let us tear that young heart out
And watch it die before our eyes)
"Close your eyes
lie down and prepare to
die alone in your deserted land"
