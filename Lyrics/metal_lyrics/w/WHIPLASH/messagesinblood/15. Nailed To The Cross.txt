With an evil life comes an evil fate
Only a question of time to open the gate
It's a fact that you're going to die
By tomorrow you'll be crucified

Nailed on, nailed to the cross
Nailed on, nailed to the cross
You stand erect no life left
Your soul's been robbed Lucifer's theft
Consciousness loneliness at the top
Must confess but it's too late for them to stop

A frowning face falls from out of the sky
Spitting blood head of a demon from hell
And you're left without a soul to sell
Double cross, eternity in hell
Nailed on, nailed to the cross
Nailed on, nailed to the
You know that you're dead when you're nailed to the cross...
