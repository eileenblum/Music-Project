We like it faster than lightning
We'll have it no other way
So fast that it can get frightening
Thrash it out day after day
Never enough satisfaction
Can't get the Marshall's past ten
Live in the heat of the action
Metal divides mice from men

No compromise we will thrash 'til death

Feel the drums pounding like thunder
Guitar riffs cut through the air
Casting a spell you'll be under
Thrashing 'til death unaware
Metal will flow through your bloodstream
Take over your body and mind
You'll never stop your headbanging
Raising your fists to the sky

No compromise we will thrash 'til death

We like it faster than lightning
We'll have it no other way
So fast that it can get frightening
Thrash it out day after day
Never enough satisfaction
Can't get the Marshall's past ten
Live in the heat of the action
Metal divides mice from men

No compromise we will thrash 'til death

Thrash 'til death!
