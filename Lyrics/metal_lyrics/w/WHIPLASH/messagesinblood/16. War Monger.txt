Lurking in the astral skies lust, power, greed, hate
Leader of the fighting force face of black fate
2100 A.D. at this man's will
Power thrashing death brigade regroups to kill
Can't just ignore what's right bow to the power lord
Warmonger
Bombs are falling from above death metal storm
Dogfight of the modern day star wars take form
Starship shooting in and out amazing grace
To each man a battle star chasing through space
Obeying every order heard brainwashed by their leader's word
Kamikaze warriors aim for the sun
Taking off for outer space four, three, two, one
Retrorockets activate lifting the craft
Final sound the fighters hear warmonger laugh
All the troops have died at war bow to the power lord
Warmonger.
