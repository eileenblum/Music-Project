Get on the go over and done plotting the plan of attack
It's time to fly over the stage high above each Marshall stack
Passing the guard making the move scale the P.A. to the top
End the first verse past the bass bins not fearing the 30 foot drop

Thrash to kill blood will spill
Now that you've met your match and nothing will suffice
Airborne offering thrashing sacrifice
Stealing the show eyes of the crowd focus of activity
Forty feet high moment of fame going down in history
Begin the flight splitting the smoke a swan dive into the sky
Tumbling down head over heels listening to cracking bones cry.
