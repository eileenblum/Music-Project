Ones your souls at rest
That's when you'll confess
Cut you down to size
Make you realize

That you not so tough
Say you've had enough
What it takes to learn
On the cross you'll burn

You must respect the dead
That's where your future lies
You must respect the dead
Or they'll rip out your eyes

When you in your tomb
You will meet with doom
Cause you've cursed the dead
Better left unsaid

You'll regret the days
That you've spit on graves
Now your time has come
You immortal scum.
