Like a viper
Your blood will flow upon his strike
Like all the others
Young and old alike

Time is running out
There's no one left to hear you shout
Time is running out
Not who he used to be
The man behind the mystery

He's coming at you
Full force
The king with the axe
He's coming at you
Full force
The king with the axe

Like a buzz saw
He's gonna cut you up on sight
You turn around and
There's no chance left, too late to fight

Time is running out
There's no one left to hear you shout
Time is running out
Not who he used to be
The man behind the mystery

He's coming at you
Full force
The king with the axe
He's coming at you
Full force
The king with the axe

He's coming at you
Full force
The king with the axe
He's coming at you
Full force
The king with the axe

A bloody rampage
Merciless onslaught in the night
Another victim
The executioner's delight

Time is running out
There's no one left to hear you shout
Time is running out
Not who he used to be
The man behind the mystery

He's coming at you
Full force
The king with the axe
He's coming at you
Full force
The king with the axe

He's gonna chop you down
