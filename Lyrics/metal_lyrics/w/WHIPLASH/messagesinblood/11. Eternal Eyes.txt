A bomb explodes in your head, it's one of those days
You should have stayed in bed, something's gone wrong
Nothing's gone right, eternal eyes will take you alive

It's a fact of life, it's a fact of death - eternal eyes
Are you dead or alive, can't get them out of your face
Can't get them out of your mind, you'll never escape
With two feet in your grave.
