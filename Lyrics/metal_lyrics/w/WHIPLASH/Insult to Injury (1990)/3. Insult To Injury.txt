A fallen soldier takes a hit
And is left behind
Comrades boots across his back
Who masterminds the sneak attack

[Pre-Chorus]
And of course the innocent
Is the One who pays the price

[Chorus]
Insult to Injury
Insult to Injury

A knife will twist into the back
the body hits the ground
And the culprits smiling face
is looking upon the waste

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

The missing lone ingredient
Salt into the wound
Is an insult to the pride
You better put yourself respect aside

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
