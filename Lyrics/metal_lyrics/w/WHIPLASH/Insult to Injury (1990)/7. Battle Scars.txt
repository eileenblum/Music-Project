Stitch in time
For a dime
Passion crime
A penny saved is a penny earned
Get rich quick
Turn your trick
Make it quick
Another bailbonds court adjourned
The rat race
Sets the pace
Leaves a trace
To teach you what you've never learned

[Chorus]
The wear and tear
Has taken its toll
Twelve hundred scars
Another years old
The wear and tear
Has taken its toll
Each battlescar
The blood runs cold

White or black
The meat rack
On your back
But not until the price is paid
Mind at ease
Aim to please
On your knees
Cause that's the way the money's made
Time slips by
To tough to cry
You wonder why
Your morals have now decayed
Pay the dues
Black and blues
It's what you choose
To live life the way you want
Familiar face
That's the case
But no disgrace
Your memory they will always haunt
Time will tell
End this hell
What you sell
You will someday no longer flaunt

[Chorus]
