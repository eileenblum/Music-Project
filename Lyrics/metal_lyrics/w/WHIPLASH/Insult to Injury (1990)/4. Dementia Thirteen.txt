Take it, it's for free
Soon it starts to please
Take as much as you want
Take as much as you need
It kills all pain
No need to feel ashamed
Now it starts ti hit home
Straight to the bone

[Chorus]
Dementia Thirteen
Now you're feeling stoned
Pains are small and few
This feeling's all that you own
Never let them try to take it from you

Ahh, it's fucking me up
I think Ive had a little too much speed
And I can hardly see
What the chords I'm hitting
What the otes to play
Yo, are we all in tune
What did that dude just say

[Chorus]
