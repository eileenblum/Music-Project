There's a scream at midnight
Or a child who's time has come
With a beauty so fresh and new
Just twenty years she'd just begun
Now the hour is coming strong
Only to crush the innocent ones
Crimes of passion and pleasure
The reasons for what is done

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear it echo through the stages
Voice of Sanity

[Chorus]
As its flowing through your mind
Let it bring you pain
Rivers turning blood red
Let it drain your brain

Looking from the hindsight
Of a world no longer strong
Thinking you are protected
You don't realize your sadly wrong
You can walk the straight line
But that straight line will be gone
The voice is always watching
and soon you will sing its sweet song

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

As you see the new dawn
And praise the safety of lighted day
Just like the young child
We must all have a price to pay
And if we're all mad
Sanity is for who to say
When the voice calls us
We must all heed and come out to play

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
