Pistolwhipped

Four cold dark walls closing
Gasp for air
Prison cell bars
Laughing as they stare
Scream in vain
What a desperate cry
Silent echoes
The room comes to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Contemplate plan to escape
Vision of breaking out
Chance to flee
Free from the arms of the law

[Chorus]
Pistolwhipped
Pistolwhipped
Pistolwhipped
Pistolwhipped

Footsteps keys ring
Music to the ear
No more waiting
Chance in hell is here
Beams of light shine
Knock'em on the floor
Must break free now
Open cell block door

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Fence is near
Scream as the sirens sound
Chase begins, blood pumping
The heart pounds
Cross a field
Taste freedom
Legs in pain
Crushing blow
Butt of a gun meets your brain

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
