With the sun sinking slowly
And the vultures flying low
Out on the streets again
With nowhere to go
You've taken you last chance
And there's nothing left to lose
Pull the gun your on the run
And caught by the man in blue

[Chorus]
Does the punishment fit the crime
It's a rape of the mind

Take a look at the rich man
At the people that he owns
Watch the smile on his face
Eviction from their homes
Caught for tax evasion
On the new he's taken away
Out a day later
ain't got nothing he wants to say

[Chorus]
His money pays for his time
It's a rape of the mind

Now the padded cell is waiting
And the doctors come to call
Shock treatments aren't helping
Still your shocked some more
Take your mind from you
And your freedom in return
With the hopes one day
A lesson has been learned

[Chorus]
Does the punishment fit the crime
It's a rape of the mind
Rape of the Mind
