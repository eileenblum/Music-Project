The last brick has been placed
Trapped in a wall of stone
Buried without a trace
Left to rot to the bone
Two men had been close friends
Fought a war side by side
Greed and lust lead to the end
One man buried alive

[Chorus]
The undead has life
Essence of Evil
Crawling and crawling
Stair after stair
It cries in the night
Essence of Evil
Revenge on the one
That has put it there

So one talks of a truce
He lures the other to his home
Let us drink and forget
The reason we walk alone
A smile on his face
But murder is on his mind
A taste of poison too late
How could he have been so blind

[Chorus]

Upstairs the killer sleeps
As its clawing tooth and nail
Raw flesh finds loose stone
It escapes from its jail
And now the killer wakes
As the door swings open wide
The essence has sealed his fate
There is nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
