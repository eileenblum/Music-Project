Smoke so thick you start to choke
Among the ruin the dogs of war
You feel the end drawing near
Air raid sirens wailing in your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
But you hear them
When it strikes, it's too late
Now you see them
Burning bodies squirming, screaming
Staring in your face

[Chorus]
Witness to the terror
Life appearing from the shelter
The lone vulture last survivor
Life is tasting bitter

Search the earth
Look around
Hopeless case
There is none to be found
Save your breathe
Final plight
Suicide
You never get it off your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Kneeling down
Final sight
Twitching hand
It cuts the ego like a knife
Pray for death
Pray for light
Live in hell
Pray to the one that's
wrong or right

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
