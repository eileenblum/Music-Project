Flashback... Pearl Harbor attack
Incoming bombers, no way to fight back
Chaos... blood in the sand
The enemy is coming, the threat is Japan

[Chorus]
It must fall to flame...Hiroshima
fall to flame...Hiroshima

Fighters strike from the air
Machine gun fire, no time to prepare
Wounded ships have been sunk
People will say kamikaze's the one

[Chorus]

One plane carries the bomb
Orders are given, the city is gone
Spreading flesh, it will burn
Revenge has been taken and
now the have learned

[Chorus]
