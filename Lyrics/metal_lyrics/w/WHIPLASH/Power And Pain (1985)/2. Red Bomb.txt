Night falls and she's out there walking the street
Hiding sking to dog the blue coats on the beat
The heat is on her tail tonight like never before
Down on twenty seventh street where she breaks the law
She bares her body to entice
Another john to pay the price
She earns her living on her back
Her legs spread wide apart forevermore
Moonlight's staring down at red bomb from above
Tonight there will be no sex there'll be no lust
Never doubt at any time she's worth the fee
If you lay your money down then you'll agree

Once she's in your sight long legs and red hair strike your appetite
Time that you lock eyes with the red bomb try her on for size
You'll do what you want, take what you will cause she's no cheap thrill
Hand over your cash for the right price she'll give you the gash
