Inject it into the blood directly into the vein
Metal assault on the ear feeling it flow to the brain
It can get under the skin the power metal syringe
It puts an end to all pain another headbanger singed

Breathe the metal in the air feel power everywhere
Taste, here's a double dose to take a fix of power thrashing death
Scream at the top of your lungs it's time to let yourself go
There is no lesson to learn get up, get into the show
The power to satisfy those who react to high speed
There is no secret to hide metal is all that you need
