I've tried so many times
To forget the things I've done
But you don't seem to let me
I guess it's all just in fun
Maybe I should ask you nice
Like civil people do
I'd get away with murder
If I'd only think it through

Try and stop just long enough
And look into my eyes
Push me and I'll push right back
Word to the wise

One time let me do things
One time my own way
I've sweat blood just to please you
How much can I pay?
I feel I'm being smothered
Your hands outstretched to my face
Clasped in prayer around my throat
I'll die in your embrace

Try to stop just long enough
And look into my eyes
Push me and I'll push right back
Can't you realize
Holding back is all that's tough
Word to the wise
Push me and I'll push right back
Cut you down to size

One time let me do things
One time my own way
I've sweat blood just to please you
How much can I pay?
I feel I'm being smothered
Your hands outstretched to my face
Clasped in prayer around my throat
I'll die in your embrace

Try and stop just long enough
And look into my eyes
Push me and I'll push right back
Word to the wise.
