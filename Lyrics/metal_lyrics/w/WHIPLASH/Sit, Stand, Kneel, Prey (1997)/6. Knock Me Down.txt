Looking back it seems so long now
And it's still all wrong now
'Least it is to me
Never thought of being you now
But it's all so true now
Guess it has to be

Sure it's alright
Until I turn around
Picking me up
Just to knock me down

Well I could've done some things man
Just pulled some strings man
Just to make you glad
Am I just a letdown to you?
Does it cut right through you?
What you could've had

Sure it's alright
Until I turn around
Picking me up
Just to knock me down

I wish you could see
Just how you look now
I know you can't see
Just what you took now

All the plans made for tomorrow
Only end in sorrow, never came to be
And my heart's forever bleeding
'Cause what I'm needing
Never came to me

Sure it's alright
Until I turn around
Picking me up
Just to knock me down.
