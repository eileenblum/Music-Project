I'm lying here, I cannot move
With nothing left for me to prove
With all the signs of life removed
Embalmed, eternally entombed
This emptiness I feel inside
I'm all alone, I wonder why
What left me here, what suicide
Left me with eyes that cannot cry

What's left unsaid remains that way
Words now lie dead - I cannot say
What's left unsaid is gone today
Words now lie dead - I'll never say

You're running out of air it seems
Like you've been killed in all your dreams
Blood trickling down in blues and greens
In neverending horror scenes
Your life is built on stone as cold
As the empty shell that held your soul
There ain't no guilt down in this hole
You're here for good - or so I'm told

What's left unsaid remains that way
Words now lie dead - I cannot say
What's left unsaid is gone today
Words now lie dead - I'll never say

What's left unsaid is just a shell
To show you who has gone to hell
I wish I could have one more try
Just watch the hellfires in my eyes

You can't escape from where you'll lay
Non sense of time, no night or day
No sight or sound in where you'll stay
We wouldn't have you anyway
So when the time has come you'll know
Your heart won't beat and your blood won't flow
Remember when you're left below
That I'm the one who told you so

What's left unsaid remains that way
Words now lie dead - I cannot say
What's left unsaid is gone today
Words now lie dead - I'll never say.
