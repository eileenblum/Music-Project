Looking out through stained glass eyes
Strange faces feeding me lies
Making the masses believe
Better to give than receive

Maybe I don't want to be
Part of the hypocrisy
But I find it hard to see
Past the fact you're killing me

Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint me!
Prey! Exploit thee!
Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint thee!
Prey! Destroy me!

Now I've got nowhere to run
Can't take back things that I've done
Always obeyed what they say
Always forbade me to stray

And what if I did believe?
Would I just be the next deceived?
In your depraved carnality
Fall empty words from up your sleeve

Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint me!
Prey! Exploit thee!
Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint thee!
Prey! Destroy me!

Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint me!
Prey! Exploit thee!
Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint thee!
Prey! Destroy me!

Molded you into their ways
The meek shall inherit their graves

Maybe I don't want to be
A part of the hypocrisy
A thousand years of tyranny
Can never make your blind man see!

Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint me!
Prey! Exploit thee!
Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint thee!
Prey! Destroy me!

Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint me!
Prey! Exploit thee!
Sit! Beside you!
Stand! Deride you!
Kneel! Anoint thee!
Prey! Destroy me!
