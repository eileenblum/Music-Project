Don't matter if you see it comin'
Don't matter if it's fair or not
You'll see as your blood is running
You deserve just what you got

You're at the top of the hitlist
You always wanted to be number one

There ain't a thing you do I don't know
That's part of what I do
I can make your wife a widow
Half now, half when I'm through

Somebody paid me nicely
To quiet you for good
If you had thought more wisely
You'd know somebody would

Don't need money to appease me
I won't be that forgiving
You see it's really all quite easy
Your dying is my living

You're at the top of the hitlist
You always wanted to be first in line
You're at the top of the hitlist
You always wanted to be number one.
