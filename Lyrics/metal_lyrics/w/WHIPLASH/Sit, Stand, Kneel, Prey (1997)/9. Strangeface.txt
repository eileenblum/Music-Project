The lines are all shut down
And your eyes are turned away
I can tell I'm getting nowhere
With the words I say
Words falling on deaf ears
As you dream of something new
I know you're going nowhere
And nothing I can do

Nobody promised you life in hell
You're not dreaming
You whispered for someone to help
Now you're screaming

Now, I see the loss in your eyes
I know the hows and the whys
I've seen the lows and the highs
This strangeface staring at me

You would never believe me
Thought the truth was for other ones
Look for solace in your use
And find another one
Clouds weeping tears of rain
Someday you'll feel the sun
Can't wash away the pain for you
The forgotten one

Hanging over rocks below
Cold wind blowin'
Covering tracks left in the snow
No one knowing

Now, I see the loss in your eyes
I know the hows and the whys
I've seen the lows and the highs
This strangeface staring at me

Nobody could see through
What you had turned into
You're reclusive, elusive, abusive
The truth is you're lying, crying, denying, and dying

Now, I see the loss in your eyes
I know the hows and the whys
I've seen the lows and the highs
This strangeface staring at me

A stranger lives in your eyes
The web you've spun out of lies
The time has passed for goodbyes
This strangeface you despise.
