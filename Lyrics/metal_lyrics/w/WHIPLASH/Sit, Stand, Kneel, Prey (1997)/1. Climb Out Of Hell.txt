Give me just one reason
Not to kill you where you stand
High caliber deliverance
God squeezed within my hand
Don't care if you suffer
Or how much you bleed
I'll cleanse you of your sins
Cause it may be all you need
The flesh rips, peels and tears
From a gentle kiss of lead
The firey, hateful world in which
You are soon to be
A lifeless, soulless shell to gaze upon eternally

Watching you climb from below
Crying like rain as you fell
Reeping the pain that you sow
Climbing in vain out of hell

A single flash, a deadly crash
Of lead against your brain
The ending will come quickly
So there shouldn't be no pain
They'll notify your friends
To satisfy their need for grief
If you were stolen from them
Just call me the thief
You'll get your little service
They'll come and cry for you
They might as well cry for themselves
I'm sure I'll get them too
Don't take it all so personally
It's just somethin' I do
My victim's always faceless
Just this time it's you

Watching you climb from below
Crying like rain as you fell
Reeping the pain that you sow
Climbing in vain out of hell

I'm watching
And I'm waiting
Until you're alone
The dark one
Has sent one
To bring you back home

Watching you climb from below
Crying like rain as you fell
Reeping the pain that you sow
Climbing in vain out of hell.
