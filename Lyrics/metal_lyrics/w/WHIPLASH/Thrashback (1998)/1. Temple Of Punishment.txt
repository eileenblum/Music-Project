Guess its time to snort another line
You're the temple
Yourself you deceive
The victim who falls to the pleasures of the flesh

Then you'll learn that the punishment is twice the crime

Now turn on the ultraviolet light
First a red
Then a white
Nearly dead
A hand full of black, you'll sleep tonight

You're the temple
Yourself you deceive
The victim who falls to the pleasures of the flesh
Only then to be judged by the prophet of lies
You're the jury
Convicting yourself
Sentence the one who's to blame then condemned
Then you'll learn that the punishment is twice the crime

You're the temple
Yourself you deceive
The victim who falls to the pleasures of the flesh
Only then to be judged by the prophet of lies
You're the jury
Convicting yourself
Sentence the one who's to blame then condemned
Then you'll learn that the punishment is twice the crime
