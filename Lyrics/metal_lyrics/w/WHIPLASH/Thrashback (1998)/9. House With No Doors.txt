My nails have scraped the paint from the walls
Peeled every inch off of the surface
Scratched clean through the messages in blood
I'm still left here trapped in this black circus

The key is in your mind
The soul shall never leave

Down on my hands and knees, crawling with doubt
Sanity prevails, those days are over
Giving in, convinced there's no way out
Say goodbye, like a lamb left for slaughter

The key is in your mind
The soul shall never leave
The soul shall always be locked
The soul shall never breathe
Forever in this house....
Forever in this house....
With no doors

Innocently led into the dark
By a pale hand that appeared before my eyes
For every one reason to live
I have found two reasons to die

The key is in your mind
The soul shall never leave
The soul shall always be locked
The soul shall never breathe
Forever in this house....
With no doors
