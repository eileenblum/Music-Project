Strive for every drop to soothe the savage need
Thrive, the pleasure, virtility freed
Bleed, a tear of blood comes trickling down the face
Plead, there's not another moment to waste

Stab
Annihilate
Devastate
The weak and the weary will never survive
Stab
Terminate
Eliminate
You'll treasure your very moment alive

Free from chains of bonded abnormality
Flee the lesson of mortality
Bear, endure this unholy atrocity
Swear, this unexpected calamity

Stab
Annihilate
Devastate
The weak and the weary will never survive
Stab
Terminate
Eliminate
You'll treasure your very moment alive

Face to face with the supreme authority
Taste the flavor of the fatality
Seal the fate of every entity on Earth
Feel the purity of creations birth

Stab
Annihilate
Devastate
The weak and the weary will never survive
Stab
Terminate
Eliminate
You'll treasure your very moment alive
