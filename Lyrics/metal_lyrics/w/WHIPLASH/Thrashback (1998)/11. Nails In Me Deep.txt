A question of honour and integrity
Belief in the privilege of equality
Determination and presence of mind
The greatest justice in all mankind
The day that the masses have authority
We will be lead by the majority
Escape from the grip held by those who betray
With passion to seize the American Way

The Truth
Betrayed
The Free
Enslaved
Never Stop Fighting
There's freedom to reap
Forever loyal
Nails in me deep
Never Stop Fighting
There's freedom to reap
Forever loyal
Nails in me deep

I must tell you something I think you should know
Maintain a firm grip and there's no letting go
The gift of freedom called democracy
Certainly has it's nails dug deep in me
You're stripped of salvation, won't you recognize
The diplomatic defamation paralyze
Deprived of rights and raped of dignity
Oppression, suppression and tyranny

The Truth
Betrayed
The Free
Enslaved
Never Stop Fighting
There's freedom to reap
Forever loyal
Nails in me deep
Never Stop Fighting
There's freedom to reap
Forever loyal
Nails in me deep

A question of honour and integrity
Belief in the privilege of equality
Determination and presence of mind
The greatest justice in all of mankind
The day that the masses have authority
We will be lead by the majority
Escape from the grip held by those who betray
With passion to seize the American Way

The Truth
Betrayed
The Free
Enslaved
Never Stop Fighting
There's freedom to reap
Forever loyal
Nails in me deep
Never Stop Fighting
There's freedom to reap
Forever loyal
Nails in me deep
