There's a killing on Monroe Street
It happened right before my eyes
With deadly action
Come satisfaction
And you can hear the victims cries

Happens all the time
Every night and day
If you hang on Monroe Street
You might get blown away
Happens all the time
Every night and day
If you hang on Monroe Street
You might get blown away

There's a riot
Down on Jackson
The raging angry mob you fear
Deadly axe licks
Double bass kicks
It's an assault upon the ears

Happens all the time
Every night and day
If you hang on Monroe Street
You might get blown away
Happens all the time
Every night and day
If you hang on Monroe Street
You might get blown away

There's a killing on Monroe Street
It happened right before my eyes
With deadly action
Come satisfaction
And you can hear the victims cries

Happens all the time
Every night and day
If you hang on Monroe Street
You might get blown away
Happens all the time
Every night and day
If you hang on Monroe Street
You might get blown away
