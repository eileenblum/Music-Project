Window of destiny
Slams shut on the hand of trust
Fate sealed in misery
Eternity to readjust
Yesterday's memory
Swarmed with desire and lust

A black cloud hangs over your head
Tomorrow hangs by a thread
Only my memory serves
Captured by this war of nerves
Forever is merely tomorrow

Watching you savor my wine
With every taste, I admire
Intimacy of sighs
Sharing the heat of the fire
My life is incomplete
Yet memories motivate and inspire

A black cloud hangs over your head
Tomorrow hangs by a thread
Only my memory serves
Captured by this war of nerves
Forever is merely tomorrow

A black cloud hangs over your head
Tomorrow hangs by a thread
Only my memory serves
Captured in this war of nerves
Forever by merely tomorrow
