[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tony Portaro, Joe Cangelosi]

Thousands of people come into your life
Pulsating sounds are shaking
See you the next time I pose a question
Are you out of your mind?

Hook in mouth
Hook in mouth
Hook in mouth
Hook in mouth

Plant the seed in your mind
And you know it's so insane
Because the hook is sacred
Yes, the hook is sacred
Think I need some new bait?

[Chorus x2]
