[From The Album "Paper Money" (1974)]
[Music &amp; Lyrics: Ronnie Montrose]
[Vocals By Joe Cangelosi]

If you're lookin' for something, that you can keep
Well baby, pass me by
And you want something, that's twenty years deep
Baby, don't even try
But you want someone, to take your soul
Maybe lift you a little bit higher...
I've got the fire

Just cause I'm skinny, don't you sell me cheap
I'm as long as a country mile
Well some like it wide and some like it deep
And guess which one's my style!
You think you can beat me at my own game
Well baby, I say you're a liar
Well I've got the fire
