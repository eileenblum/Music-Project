[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tony Portaro, Joe Cangelosi]

Scent of the carcass is near
Unrivaled talent to kill
The competition is fierce
Against all will
Guarding the food at its source
No chance of sharing the prize
Inches away from its cause
Feed to survive

The feeding
The bleeding
Jaws clenching down
Empower
Devour
Feeding frenzy

Kill and eat what is too slow
Feel the hot breath down your neck
Tapetum lucidum glows
Kill and protect
Tracking the one that's astray
Breaking the stride of the prey
Smelling the fear in the air
Teeth and claws tear

Inches away from its claws
Inches away from its cause
Chaos and terror arise
Fear in the eyes
Ripping the flesh from its core
Hovering over the kill
Splitting and cracking the bone
All feast at will
