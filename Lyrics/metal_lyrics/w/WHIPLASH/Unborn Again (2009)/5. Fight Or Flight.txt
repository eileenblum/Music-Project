[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tony Portaro, Joe Cangelosi]

Dangerous, threatening warfare
Explodes everywhere
Diving for cover
Smoke and sand fly through the air
Insurgences are coming
Nowhere to hide
Focus is sharp
Decisions is made to survive

Run, flee, escape
Choose your own fate
Mommy says go for the eyes
Will you live or die?
Fight or flight

Grazing solitude
Zebras out in the plains
Lion is hunting
Adrenaline pumping through veins
Predators spotted
Zebras reply
Shuffling fast
Escape or they meet their demise

Saber tooth, razor-sharp tiger
Stalks early man
Caveman is startled
Primitive weapons in hand
Fierce tiger growling
Eyeing the prize
Smashing its head
Bloodthirsty look in its eyes
