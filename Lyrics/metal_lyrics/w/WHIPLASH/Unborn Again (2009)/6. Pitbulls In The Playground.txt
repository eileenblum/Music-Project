[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tony Portaro, Joe Cangelosi]
[Special Guest Guitar Solo By Frank Blackfire]

Snarling attack
Money is made
Hail Mary pass
Best friend betrayed
Against all odds
Losing the bet
Meet your demise
The stage is set

Only a matter of course
It's time to show some remorse
For what you've done
Hopelessly riding the high
You aim to get higher
Into the fire with you

Trained to attack
A killing spree
Making your mark
In history
Against the law
Busted the ring taken away
Canaries sing

[Chorus]

Play action pass
Disorder, dismay
Contract is void
Miracle play
Front page report
Made the headlines
Sunday night game
Ignorant crime

[Chorus]
