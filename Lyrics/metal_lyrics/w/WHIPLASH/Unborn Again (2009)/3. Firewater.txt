[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tony Portaro, Joe Cangelosi]

Sit down like you do
And I'll cross my legs too
My friend
What's in that pipe
Strikes my appetite
Sweet blend

Firewater
Firewater

Two shots for you
One shot for me
Can you still see
It's your turn again
Let me help you hold the pen
And sign this deed

Firewater
Firewater

Firewater
Firewater
Fire
