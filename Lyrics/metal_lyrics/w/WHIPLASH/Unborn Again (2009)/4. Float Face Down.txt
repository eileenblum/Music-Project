[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tony Portaro, Joe Cangelosi, Rich Day]

Treacherous waters
Smashing and thrashing around you
Blistering lips
Salt water you'll kiss
Take a sip
And the trip will begin

You will fight for your life
'til you float face down
Gasping for air
Spit out your last prayer
Then you float face down

Ravaging current
Swirling, engulfing the White Sea
Struggling to live
Never forgive
Captain's order
The slaughter received

Unspoken terror
Heart beating faster
Inside you
Sun going down
The vultures will sound
Screaming out but the shout can't be heard
