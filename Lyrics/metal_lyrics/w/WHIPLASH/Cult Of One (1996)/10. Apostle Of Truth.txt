Trust in this man, break bread with this man
Welcome me into your home with your wife and your children
Give me the shirt off your back as I plan my attack
Take for all that itâs worth, Iâm the villain

Devoted disciple of integrity
I am your task rehabilitate me
The calling has come, youâre compelled to comply
You have the power to heal â my mind

Hold me to all that you own
Leave me there all alone
I will swear by my name to be loyal
Iâll put the ease in your mind,
Youâll return just to find
That your life has been taken from you

Devoted disciple of integrity
I am your task rehabilitate me
The calling has come, youâre compelled to comply
You have the power to heal

Faith, hope and love seen better days
Loyalty and honour Iâve abandoned from my ways
Lies all lies, I admit Iâm wrong
Feed me all your trust, but I will ignore

I need a saint to insure, He will help me to cure
The incurable cure â Iâm a liar
I live my life as a thief, full of my own beliefs
Show me land where there is truth, I will follow

Devoted disciple of integrity
I am your task rehabilitate me
The calling has come, youâre compelled to comply
You have the power to heal all lies

The lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
