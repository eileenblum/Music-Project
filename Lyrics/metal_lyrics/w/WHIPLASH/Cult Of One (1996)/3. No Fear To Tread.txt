Coward, screaming, hiding, bleeding
Put your fear to the rear and face the pain
Driven to violence, power devours
Evil comes around, brings you down
âTil youâre insane

No fear
No one strips me of my pride
Youâve been warned
Now get out of my way
Corruption, hunger, possessed by desire
Thereâs always one man out to rule the world.
Killing, slaughter, destruction, order
Wish this fucking nightmare would go away

No fear
No one strips me of my pride
Iâd rather die with dignity
No fear
I will fight until I fall
But I wonât fall âtil humanity is saved

History, repeated, always defeated
Freedom rules, you canât take that from me
Power to the people, eliminate the evil
If we all stand tall our strength wonât waste away

No fear
No one strips me of my pride
Iâd rather die with dignity
No fear
I will fight until I fall
Youâve been warned, someoneâs got to pay
