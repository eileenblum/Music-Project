Youâre the icon of shame, entirely to blame
Contaminating everything you touch
Socially rejected, consequently neglected
Undivided nations scorn the likes of such

Disgracing
Nauseating
Youâre no oneâs idol â No oneâs idol
Pathetic
So eccentric
Youâre no oneâs idol â No oneâs idol

Such an incriminating stare, toward your tangled, twisted hair
Youâre on display for every man to criticize
When oneâs life is a total waste,
A disgusting disgrace
What a sickening excuse for a human life

Immoral
Indecent
Youâre no oneâs idol â No oneâs idol
Offensive
Repulsive
Youâre no oneâs idol â No oneâs idol

You welcome filth with open arms, your mistakes do such harm
The stench of you makes stomachs toss and turn
Exit your presence let me breathe, donât want none of your disease,
Look at your ragged filthy life when will you learn?

Disgracing
Nauseating
Youâre no oneâs idol â No oneâs idol
Pathetic
So eccentric
Youâre no oneâs idol â No oneâs idol
Immoral
Indecent
Youâre no oneâs idol â No oneâs idol
Offensive
Repulsive
Youâre no oneâs idol â No oneâs idol
