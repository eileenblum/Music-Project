Why do I only see what I want to see,
And only believe what I want to believe,
Death is in the air, yes, itâs coming for me,
Stealing my soul to wither below.

As you have lived,
One day you will die, straight to the kill.
Death strikes again, Iâm afraid itâs time,
Such is the will.

Blacker than night, I will not know a thing.
No thoughts, no desires, what else it will bring.
A shadow in chains, in its own misery,
Coming for me, coming for me.

As you have lived,
One day you will die, straight to the kill.
Death strikes again, Iâm afraid itâs time,
Such is the will.

All such thoughts come into my head,
Will my soul carry on when my body is dead
Burn what is left, leave whatâs left unsaid
Such is the will

As you have lived,
One day you will die, straight to the kill.
Death strikes again, Iâm afraid itâs time,
Such is the will.
