I never feel the same, I canât sleep at night
Since that godforsaken madman took your life
Iâm going insane, a pain I cannot fight,
I cry most every night
I cry myself to death, donât want to live without you

Come take my hand and hold me tight
God shines his light on me tonight
I need you now, help me through the night
I donât want to live without you anymore

Lifeâs too short, a speck in time
A flash of light in oneâs mind
In my dreams, all I find
Are memories of another time
Why did you leave me alone?

Hush my baby donât your cry, mommyâs gone away
I need you now, I need you now
Everything you were to me, I need you now
Forever in my heart I cry

Come take my hand and hold me tight
God shines his light on me tonight
I need you now, help me through the night
I donât want to live, I need you now

Build me a wall 100 feet high and leave me to wither
Call me insane, lock me behind my bloodshot mind
Whatâs there to live for when all that you had was crushed and devoured
Just go away, leave me alone, canât you see that I want to die?

Why did you leave me alone?
I just canât live without you
Why did you leave me alone?
Iâve suffered so much pain

Lifeâs so unfair as I crumble to the ground
Takes back what itâs given
Where am I now? Who do I have? How do I cry?
I love you now more than ever before,
I yearn just to touch you
Iâll never forget the look in your eyes
Why the hell did you have to die?

Why did you leave me alone?
I just canât live without you
Why did you leave me alone?
Iâve suffered so much pain
