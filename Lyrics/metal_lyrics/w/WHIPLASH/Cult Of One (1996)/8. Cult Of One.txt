My life worth next to nothing
Tell me who am I to blame?
Iâve grown to my addiction
You would think Iâve gone insane
They talk to me at times, they never go away
Voices from the past
When I was young I felt the pain

What was once me has died
Cold and empty inside
Hungry you are my prey
Watch your life slip away

How much can I take?
I must have cried a million times
Can I escape retribution?
Clear these thoughts from my mind
How can I look you in the eyes, as your life fades away?
Welcome to your death
I love to hear you scream

What was once me has died
Cold and empty inside
Hungry you are my prey
Watch your life slip away

I donât know why I see my life through your eyes
As my pain starts to die, so will you

Hear the voices in my head
Whisper what they expect from me
Sacrifices to my religion
Killing everything I see
Come to me my love, I will show you the way
I will haunt you âtil forever
And forever comes today

What was once me has died
Cold and empty inside
Hungry you are my prey
Watch your life slip away
