The President gave the word the other day,
He ruled the world
Time to meet your nightmare face to face
Start the fires
Cities are burning,
Iâm scared out of my jeans.
Iâm about to see hell man,
God must have set me free

What does it mean to make a man realise,
He who makes war â Enemy
How many die in the blink of an eye,
Just to settle the score
Why does it take forever
Open your eyes â Enemy
How many die in the blink of an eye,
And I want to know why itâs me whoâs fighting

Drive a man to the point of insanity,
You make him kill.
No remorse âcause mercyâs dangerous,
Youâre a death machine
Men wounded, lie screaming
Iâm dying, help me
Iâll never see my motherâs face again.

What does it mean to make a man realise,
He who makes war â Enemy
How many die in the blink of an eye,
Just to settle the score

What does it mean to make a man realise,
He who makes war â Enemy
How many die in the blink of an eye,
Just to settle the score
Why does it take forever
Open your eyes â Enemy
How many die in the blink of an eye,
And I want to know why itâs me whoâs fighting

Every minute more, one minute less
Theyâve come for you
Will this be the day life ends for me
Youâll never know what hit you
Helpless and broken,
I donât want to die
Iâm too young to fade to grey.

What does it mean to make a man realise,
He who makes war â Enemy
How many die in the blink of an eye,
Just to settle the score
Why does it take forever
Open your eyes â Enemy
How many die in the blink of an eye
