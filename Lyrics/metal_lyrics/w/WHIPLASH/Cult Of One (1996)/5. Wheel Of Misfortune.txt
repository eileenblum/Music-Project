Alone again, it never fails
Always seems to happen to me
Just when I think Iâve got it all,
Along comes fate, it all falls to the floor

NaÃ¯ve but yet so conscious
Of the grim reality that I endure
I never won this game before,
Why does it happen to me?

Iâm alive, but Iâm not winning,
The life that I live, tell me who I to blame?

Iâm so broke but I survive,
Canât keep up with modern times
It all costs more than I can afford,
Why should a man have to beg for more?

I see the rich get richer
While the poor survive day by day, itâs wrong
Iâm sick of all that I endure
The world where I belong

Iâm alive, but Iâm not winning
The life I live, tell me who am I to blame?
So alive, my head is spinning, my mind keeps turning,
Life is killing me.

Itâs always me who hits the wall,
The only man to take the fall
I fall onto my knees and cry,
âCause everything I have just died

I try so hard to make it
In a world so cold, itâs rotten to the cire
But Iâll keep trying more and more
âTil I get whatâs coming to me
