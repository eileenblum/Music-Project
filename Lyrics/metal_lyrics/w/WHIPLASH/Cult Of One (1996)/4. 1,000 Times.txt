I donât see them taking me alive
Blinded by the blood that stains my eyes
I wonât give in â no!

Iâll fight to the finish
I donât want to die
No, I donât want to lose my pride
Iâve got all it takes to survive
Iâve seen my death 1.000 times

Greed from hell falls down so hard on the innocent
I pray they see the light of Heaven shine
There is no pity

Iâll fight to the finish
I donât want to die
No, I donât want to lose my pride
Iâve got all it takes to survive
Iâve seen my death 1.000 times

Screams for life they seem so far away
Life makes death one hell of a price to pay
I want revenge

Iâll fight to the finish
I donât want to die
No, I donât want to lose my mind
Iâve got all it takes to survive
Iâve seen my death 1.000 times
