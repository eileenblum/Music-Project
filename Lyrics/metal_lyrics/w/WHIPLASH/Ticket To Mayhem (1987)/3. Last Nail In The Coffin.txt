[Lyrics: Tony Portaro, Music: Tony Portaro/Tony Bono]

Without one breath of life from the coffin'
The body begins to arise
It's rotted skin smelling of death
A hand of bones creeps from inside
Emerging with two glowing eyes

These eyes are forever hypnotizing
Burning your very soul
Passionate, painless, paralyzing
They're gonna turn your blood cold

These eyes will forever hypnotize you
They'll turn around and they'll blind you

Evil inside those eyes
