[Lyrics: Tony Portaro/Joe Cangelosi, Music: Tony Portaro]

Ship has set sail, sea will prevail
Swallow the slaughter, drink the salt water
Pawn of the power, sea will devour
Infinite day, awaiting the hour

[Chorus:]
Walk the plank
Walk the plank

Trid ball and chain, infliction of pain
Vulture's arise, death in their eyes
Under the gun, food supply none
Knife in the back, nowhere to run

[Repeat chorus]

[Post-chorus:]
All hope is lost been double crossed
Legion of death steal your last breath

The trechery of muting, lightning and thunder
Make the mind wander
Water's infected, captain's arrested
Sharks in the water, body's injected

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat post-chorus]
