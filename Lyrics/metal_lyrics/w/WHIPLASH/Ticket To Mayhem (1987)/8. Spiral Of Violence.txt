One man with our lives in his hands
So much power
And so much pressure - is waiting on his command
Brainstorm

From out of the norm, a winning battle plan
And it's out of our hands
So the regiments form

[Chorus:]
The angel of war
Unleashing terror

Who'll throw the first crushing blow
Who will decide who has the last laugh
Who will throw the last blow

One of a kind
Who's out of his mind
He who thinks he holds all the answers
Can destroy all mankind

[Repeat chorus]

Wareny
Heard cut through the sky
Flip of a coin turns heads you will live
Lands on tails you will die
Napalm
A nuclear bomb
A flamethrower and a hand grenade
And I'm back in Viet Nam

[Repeat chorus]
