Judgement day's here, smell of death's near
Captor's ignoring the cries
Tragedy's stand, trouble at hand
Death jury plots the demise
Hungry to kill
Torture at will

Anxiously waiting the word
Sentence to cast
Won't be the last
Laugh when the verdict is heard

Last straw
Through with the final injunction
Case closed
No one will ever get free

[Chorus:]
Snake pit
Snake pit
Snake pit

Guilty of sin, no one will win
Death jurers plot till the death
Justice at large, make up a change
Waiting to stear your last breath

Gaffle will fall, order from all
Silence overcomes the court
Don't say a word
Sentence is heard
Might make the vision distort

[Repeat chorus]
[Lead]
[Chorus]
[1st verse]
[Chorus]
