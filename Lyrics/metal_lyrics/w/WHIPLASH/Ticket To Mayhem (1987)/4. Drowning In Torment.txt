[Lyrics: Tony Portaro/Joe Cangelosi, Music: Tony Portaro]

What is seen
Through the eyes of the crippled mind
No wasted time
No wasted line
Unforseen death What a seen

When the terror of the mind
Is craving evil lines
Confusion time
One step closer to...
Lust decides your fate

So the seeds will grow
Snow will dominate
Life is left to blow

Living dream, illusion being
Strength evolves from stimulation
The minds railng
Another gram is blown, eyes gleam
Numbness felt through the veins
Surging
The nose burning
Never learning
One step closer to...
Hell inside the soul 
Melts into the brain
Life is uncontrolled

Victim of cocaine

Dream your life, life's a dream
Another line, a deadly scheme
You will pay
Through the nose
An evil plot to get the blow

You will see, you are left
With nothing more, you bargained for
The money's gone, left in despair
You coming down, what you can't bear

Hell inside the soul melts into the brain
Life is uncontrolled, victim of cocaine

Conscious will never recover
Temptations taking control
Body's rejecting the substance
School of the wasted enrolled

Evil prevails to take over
Something like driving while blind
Reality must take cover
Left with a scar on the mind
