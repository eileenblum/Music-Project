Broadsword will never fall short of its mark
Split the skull
Aim for the heart
Flesh is no match for the black metal art
Outcome declared from the start
Sorcerer's rage setting the stage
Seek the Skull
Find me the One

[Chorus:]
Sword Meet Skull, Skull Meet Sword
Sword Meet Skull, Skull Meet Sword

Battle engaged
Slashing with rage
Chopping heads mile after mile
Baptized in blood
Drowning in mud
More bones to stack on the pile
Sorcerer's rage setting the stage
Seek the Skull
Find me the One

[Chorus]

Black metal spell sending all souls to hell
Prophecy now is fulfilled
Greatest reward is the skull on the sword
Not one drop of blood left to spill
Sorcerer's rage setting the stage
Seek the Skull
Find me the One

[Chorus]
