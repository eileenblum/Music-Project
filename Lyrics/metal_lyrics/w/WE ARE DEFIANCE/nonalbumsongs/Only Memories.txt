I inhaled the winter air Yeah, I can see us there
You were always by my side, you never left it
Then we snapped a photograph, one that I'll always have
The city was dressed in lights

You can't believe in what I've promised,
you can't believe a word I say
If it was love then wouldn't I have stayed?
I swear I wish I could take back the lies and the stories
Cause now I'm left with only memories

I'm missing the way things were
I never thought that I would throw it away

Now the life that we had planned, down by the ocean sand
Will be nothing more than just an empty promise?
All that there is left to do, is sit and think of you
How could I have lost it all in one night?

I swore I'd never let you go, but I threw it away
I swore I'd never let you go, that night threw it away
And tonight I'll call you mine for the last time
I will always regret all the things that were said
That was the last time I'd see your face
I should have made you stay

No, I'll never be the same No, I'll never find my way
I'm missing the way things were
I never thought that I would throw it away
