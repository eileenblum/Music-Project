I never said that this would be easy,
you gave up trying before we had the chance
This is my time to shine, but in this town we all die young
So scream at the world, we'll show them we are here
How could you be so selfish?
This is your chance, prove me wrong

And when you fall asleep, I know you'll dream of me
You'll dream of me, you'd look so wonderful dead
Find your way back home

I've watched the way that you fall, it's so tempting
You've let me down
I've watched the way that you fall, it's so tempting
So prove me wrong
So, when you fall asleep, I see straight through,
I see straight through those crooked lies

I can prove you wrong, I can shove it down your throat this time
So, when you fall asleep...
