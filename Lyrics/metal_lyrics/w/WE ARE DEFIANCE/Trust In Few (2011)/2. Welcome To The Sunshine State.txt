I am the thief among the thieves,
The angst in your blood
The cause of your depression,
Hereâs a lesson give up.
Youâre half the man I am,
I'm who you struggle to be
And the fact that you wonât suffer
Is what tortures me.

How does it feel to try to be like me?
You think youâre tough until your heart stops beating.
How does it feel to try to be like me?
You think youâre tough until your heart stops beating.

Man the fuck up.
