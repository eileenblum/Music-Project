Right now
You let me down
Some things will never change
Everything stays the same forget my name

I can't believe
What I have seen
The only thing that I have ever thought
To be sure of was never anything

Walking around with my gun in hand
A knife in my back and I can't
I can't be stopped

Was it worth it to end this so tastelessly
You crossed the line
So say goodbye

Right now, (right now)
You let me down (you let me down)
Some things will never change
Everything stays the same
Forget my name

But I can't breathe
With you near me
And now you'll see that I will be just fine without Your lies
I'm walking away

Walking around with my gun in hand
A knife in my back and I can't
I can't be stopped

Was it worth it to end this so tastelessly
You've crossed the line
So say goodbye

Right now (right now)
You've let me down (you let me down)
Some things will never change
Everything stays the same
Forget my name
And by now (by now)
I found you out (I found you out)
So don't pretend that its okay
Telling me to give you one more day

Open your eyes
You run and you hide
But I will seek you out
Forget everything you think you know about me
This is the last time goodbye
The last time goodbye

Carry with me
The weight of the sea,
Now watch it all
Begin to fall

Carry with me
The weight of the sea,
Now watch it all
Begin to fall

Carry with me
The weight of the sea,
Now watch it all
Begin to fall

Right now
You've let me down (you let me down)
Some things will never change
Everything stays the same
Forget my name
And by now (by now)
I found you out (I found you out)
So don't pretend that its okay
Telling me to give you one more day
