Write this one down. You listen carefully now.
It's about time you find out what I am truly capable of.
Why don't you pin me down and tell me I'll be alright.
Write this one down. What goes around comes around.

Write this one down. You listen carefully now.
It's about time you find out what I am truly capable of.
Why don't you pin me down and tell me I'll be alright.
Write this one down. What goes around comes around.

You're the reason why I try so hard
to keep the past at my back,
oh you're not coming back again.
Did you hear what I said?

Yeah, I'll take it all and leave you alone.
I'll knock you out and put you underground.

Write this one down. You listen carefully now.
It's about time you find out what I am truly capable of.
Why don't you pin me down and tell me I'll be alright.
Write this one down. What goes around comes around.
