This distance is an issue you, ain't foolinâ me.
I'll pack my bags and run away baby.
Just stay away, itâll be alright.
I'm breaking free tonight.

I havenât felt this way in a long time,
It's not the first time,
But I wonât hold my breath
It's cause of you that I trust in few
And why I'm sitting here with no hope left.

Drink yourself to sleep tonight,
Tip the bottle back, youâll be just fine.
Donât hesitate to choke and die.

This distance is an issue you, ain't foolinâ me.
I'll pack my bags and run away baby.
Just stay away, itâll be alright.
I'm breaking free tonight.

I canât stand the way you look at me,
Your eyes burn through my skin.
Thereâs not a chance or a second glance
That this will work out in the end.

Havenât felt this way in a long time
This ain't first time
But I wonât hold my breath.

This distance is an issue you, ain't foolinâ me.
I'll pack my bags and run away baby.
Just stay away, itâll be alright.
I'm breaking free tonight.

You always thought you were better than me,
But now they all see what I see
What do you see?
Now it's time youâll envy me.

And I will stop to see the truth
To never bend or break for you,
You canât break me
You canât break me down,
A cowardâs escape is your way out.
