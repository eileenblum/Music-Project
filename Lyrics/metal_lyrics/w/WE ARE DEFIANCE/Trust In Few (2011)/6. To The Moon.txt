Come back, come back to see
You should have listened much more carefully
What are you wanting from me, what do you want me to be?
Come set, come set me free
We're gonna make it there eventually
What are you wanting from me, what do you want me to be?

I will destroy you
You're so pathetic, you're a waste of my time
You took advantage of me, now it's my turn to lead
I'm taking back what's rightfully mine

You will respect me
It's not a question, it's me you'll want this time
With all the heads that I turn
When will you ever learn, that it's me who controls my life

You're in the way of what I'm gonna take
You're just a fake and you'll never forget me
