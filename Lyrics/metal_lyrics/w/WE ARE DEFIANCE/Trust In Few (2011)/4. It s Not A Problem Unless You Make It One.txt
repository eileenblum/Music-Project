Hold your breath forever cause I can't bare to hear you speak
You should, bite your tongue, save your lies
you're just a flavor of the week
You walk around with your head up high
like the world owes you everything
But in reality you have it out for me cause
I can't stand the way you sing, you bitch

I hope you know that we're all laughing at you
Fabricate the words you say, you're a fad in every way
I see right through those things you say and you do
I can see but why can't they, you are fading day by day

You fall short of the lies you told everyone knows that you're a fake
I can see in your eyes you're just a bitch in disguise
you fall harder with every step that you take
You're not what you think you're just a knock off version
of the person you are trying to be
You're not anything stop trying you're a joke keep failing
cause you're trying to be me

You'll never be me!!!
