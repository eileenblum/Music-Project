Not tonight.  No excuse.  You care right?  You're gone from sight.  Handpicked, taken for now.  Pity the foolish ones.  Inspired by your lies.  Deceit behind your eyes.  Avoid any action that leaves you with nothing to gain.  Secure with no shame.  Profit from others pain.  Only think about yourself.  Friendship by convenience.  Only think about yourself.  Friendship with no lenience.  I'm cutting you off.  What the fuck are you gonna do?  I'm cutting you off.  Who the fuck needs friends like you?  One way road leads me here.  One way road never clear.
