Open minds but close the blind- Searching for status.  What will she find?  Looking to trip and drop a name.  What's dignity when there is fame.  Pry away to belong.  Hope they notice before they're gone.  Empty inside, terrified.  Look out everybody she has arrived.  She's got plans.  She'll let you know.  Cheeks the guest list at every show.  Never sincere.  When I turn around will you disappear?  Doing whatever it takes to fit in.  If you measure up, she'll meet you with a grin.  Another hollow head with a pretty face.  Stars in her eyes, she'll end up in disgrace.  Powerless to popularity.  We'll burn your rusted tiara, I'll burn your precious crown.  We'll burn your rusted tiara.  Now burn you fucking bitch.
