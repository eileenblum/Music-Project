Do you know who you want to be?  Do you choose who to believe?  Do you hope that one day you can leave?  Welcome to your life.  Hearts break but they can mend.  The thing that matters is that you've got friends.  They'll be with you til the end.  Welcome to your life.  All the things you wished he said.  All the times you wished you were dead.  All the tears that you shed.  Welcome to your life.  Growing up but refuse to get old.  Don't look back, watch the future unfold.  Keep a grasp on the love that you hold.  Welcome to your life.  No direction, no intention, no care in the world.  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  But you gotta keep trying.  No thoughts of dying.  You gotta open your eyes.  Don't let this day pass you by.  Give thanks to be alive.  Sometimes you make mistakes, that's the risk you take.  The choices that we make.  Make it worth it.  The smiles, the frowns, the ups, the downs.  When you're trapped in a corner with no-one around.  Lifes a risk.  Victories.  The regrets.  All the people that you've met.  All the times you wish to forget.  Lifes a risk.  The hopes, the fears, the laughs, the tears.  The way your beliefs change through the years.  Life a risk.  Your love, your hate.  The bonds you create.  No way to predict your fate.  Lifes a risk.  Realize in life nothing is certain except the end.
