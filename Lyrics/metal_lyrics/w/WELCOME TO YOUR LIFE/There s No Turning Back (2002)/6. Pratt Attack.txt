No hope, closed eyes till the day you die.  Lost touch, lost faith, lost love, you lost your life.  I still hate.  You're too late.  Heard your lies.  Silence as you die.  So he doesn't believ in trust.  Who beat Who.  Doesn't make it right.  Disagree, bare the knife.  I hope one day I get the chance to save your life so I can watch you fucking die.  You can't hide with everyone on my side in the end, revenge.
