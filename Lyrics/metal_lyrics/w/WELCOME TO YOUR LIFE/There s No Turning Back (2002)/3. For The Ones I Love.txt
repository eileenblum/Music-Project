The search, what's right, the set up, the fight.  The limits been set.  Look back with no regret.  My friends, the true, this song goes out to you.  For everyone else you're on your own.  I'm loved by those who matter.  They'll stand by me through blood and broken bones.  I will not turn my back on you.  For my true friends.  Fuck the rest, fake but well-dressed.  For my true friends, fuck the trends, fuck the fake friends.  I am not impressed.  Outside behind the house made of glass.  I limped away.  No reason to stay.  Nothing to say.  The public eye without a blink.  Passed me by.  Not you, you stood there by my side.  For those I love I would give my life.  For my true friends I would sacrifice.
