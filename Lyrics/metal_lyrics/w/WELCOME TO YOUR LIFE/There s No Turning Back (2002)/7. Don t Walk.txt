Did you think that I would mind?  Would it be the same time after time?  Plans fall short.  Don't walk, run.  No remorse.  Don't walk, run.  State your case.  Are you up for a sale?  I'll stick around to watch you fail.  From birth to burial all you do is deceive.  The beginning was the end for me.  "X" out your eyes.  Slide the razor across your wrists, let the blood run.  No reason to exist.  Nothing left to say anymore.  Just walk away.  Just run away I won't push my feeling to the side.  You're gone for good and I won't look back.  Nothing between us, you and me, you and me.
