For the first time I know the truth.  Complete the change become the hypocrite.  I tried too pull free.  Cut the face out.  Tear this apart, collect the damage.  Hide yourself away.  Disappear, fade to grey.  Admit you want the taste.  Rumors laid to rest.  Provoke the attack, welcome it, we attract.  I share his disgust just in case you should ask.  Remove yourself, you better watch your back.  Blame the world for what you lack.  We know it's all a fucking act.  In the end you're alone, It's a fucking fact.  Found the weakness tried to restrain.  Leaning forward into the morning light.  Dead air phone calls obey the urge.  Bleed to me.  My smile, your mistake.  We're getting closer now.  Approaching distrust.  Looks like you have a lot to say so I'll beat you to the punch.  Am I the only one who sees the humor in this ignorance seeping through?  No one cares about you.  Trust in thyself cause no one else gives a fuck.  Walk out that door while you still can.  Walk out that door if you still can.
