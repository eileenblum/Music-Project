O' mighty Northland,
Mother of us all,
Your earthen womb has nourished our crops.

O' mighty Northland,
Father of us all,
You gifted us the secret of steel.

O' mighty Northland,
Benevolent guardian,
Eternally you have sustained us.

O' mighty Northland,
Forged in the flames of antiquity,
Do your mountains still thirst for blood?
