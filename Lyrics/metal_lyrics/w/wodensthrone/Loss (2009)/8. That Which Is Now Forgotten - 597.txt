From the vast encircling black seas do our ancestors watch with despairing eyes.
Only few still share this grief within their hearts like an extinguished flame in the eventide.

Many have now forgotten the deeds of our ancestors.
They have become blind to the charm of an alien faith.

The tide stirred, bound to the governing wind, building a falsity upon the foundations of our stronghold,
Forcing our essence into a construct of delusion and debauching our blood and glory!

Many have now forgotten the deeds of our ancestors.
They have become blind against a faith they once glorified.

Obstinate engravings etched onto the fabric of history.
Depicting our Gods as the accursed of their feeble doctrine.

Those who are now forgotten never perished from existence.
Once our awareness is reclaimed they will arise from our (dormant) consciousness.

Tir! Tir! Tir!

The new dawn shall come!
