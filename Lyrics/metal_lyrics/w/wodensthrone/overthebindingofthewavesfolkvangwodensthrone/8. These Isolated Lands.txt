A harsh wind blows westward over the northern sea
A lonely land beckons through the rain and ocean breeze
An isolated land that is without thought and remembrance

The voice of Nerthus calls

A journey into fields of solitude over the northern sea
As a clan we sail under the stars to fulfill what shall become
An isolated land that we shall reign and defend

The sun, luminescent in the north

An imbalance shifts the skies
As we walk unspoiled paths
An unfamiliar energy cloaks us
A new sense of understanding is left

This land is the source of all eloquence
Mainstay of wisdom and bringer of legend
Bound in the purity of dearkness
