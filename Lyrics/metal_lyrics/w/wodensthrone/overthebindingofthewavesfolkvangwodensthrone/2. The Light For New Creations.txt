Who's covered by darkness, wandering in madness
The infinite life is losing it's sense
The fog is taking away the autumn landscape
And the winter authority is coming back to life

Having left only memory, time is going away
It's carrying away what we have forgotten
The light, which has been revived for new creations will mention us only, but will not hear
