[Lyrics: HrÃ©owsian - Music: WildeÃ¾rÃ½Ã°, ÃrfÃ¦st, RÃ¦dwalh, A. Marshall]

First light caresses the sky
I am the creator
"In biting flame and burning ice
it shall begin again"

Whisper to me the name of the wind
be one with me
transcend the self
and become the whole

Let us hear the song of the ocean
and feel the weight of the sky
The heart opens as the eye closes
Pluck out and relinquish the 'I'

Ancestral warnings
etched into our souls
steer us from the darkness
that lies within us all

The serpent slumbers only lightly
Though he with one eye keeps vigil
Upon his throne once more
As it was, so it shall be again

The serpent slumbers only lightly
Though he with one eye keeps vigil
Upon his throne once more
As it was, so it is again
