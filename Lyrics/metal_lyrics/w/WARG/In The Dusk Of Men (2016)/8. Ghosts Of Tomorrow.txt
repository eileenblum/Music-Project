Free men born
In silver morning
Freedom reign
Upon this dawning

And when we're young
We learn to embrace it
And when we're young
We're told to face it

Thirst for battle
Soon arises
When our kingdom
Polarizes

The rage of youth
Annihilation
The rage of youth
Cold devastation

Let us ride with the ghosts of tomorrow
Let us feast in the halls of the dying
Let us grow with no pain with no sorrow
Let us rise, let us live, let us die

Storm would pass
Spring will come
Far more than us
What we become

We feel the light
A new begining
We feel the life
That runs within it

Flesh and bones
From clay from mud
A new life
Carries our blood

And time goes by
Our breed arises
And time goes by
We'll face the ashes

Let us ride with the ghosts of tomorrow
Let us feast in the halls of the dying
Let us grow with no pain with no sorrow
Let us rise, let us live, let us die

Starless night in front of me
In its arms I lay to rest
Peace is granted for my needs
In this place where ends my quest
Then the moon will light
The river of life

When the road is done
This and nothing more
What I leave behind
Is always on my mind

Let us ride with the ghosts of tomorrow
Let us feast in the halls of the dying
Let us grow with no pain with no sorrow
Let us rise, let us live, let us...

Ride with the ghosts of tomorrow
Let us feast in the halls of the dying
Let us grow with no pain with no sorrow
Let us rise, let us live, let us die
