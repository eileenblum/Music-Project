Just another day in life
Now you've reached the end of the line
No more feeling alone
The time to mourn is long time gone

We're marching forever through the dark of the sun
We're riding together come join us tonight

Wargs on the horizon (has risen)
New-born strength in your heart
Wargs on the horizon (are calling)
You've found your place at last

Stop the crying, it's time to fight
Control your anger, now feel your might
Now listen closely and mark my words
The wargs are calling, just let'em come

We're marching forever through the dark of the sun
We're riding together come join us tonight

Wargs on the horizon (has risen)
New-born strength in your heart
Wargs on the horizon (are calling)
You've found your place at last

We've come to get you all
We're here to stay
You cannot break the spell
Just hear my call

Wake, and ride with me again
Rise, and fight with me this time

We've come to get you all
We're here to stay
You cannot break the spell
Just hear my call

We're marching forever through the dark of the sun
We're riding together come join us tonight

Wargs on the horizon (has risen)
New-born strength in your heart
Wargs on the horizon (are calling)
You've found your place at last
