In the red keep
I rest in peace
Everyone knows of my existence
But very few on how I got here

With the breath of Balerion I was forged here
By thousand swords my seat was made
The conqueror, Aegon, would keep me sharp
So that no king sitting there feels secure

I have seen fall
Kind and wicked kings
Greed and lies
Where the throne remains

My creators came from a distant place
Carrying the fourteen fires
Valyria the place where the curse occurred
Across the narrow sea, they left behind the evil
Arrived to dragon stone
Between fire and blood they conquered the realms
Cover the realms in fire
A burning blood desire

I have seen fall
Kind and wicked kings
Greed and lies
Where the throne remains

Fire and blood
Its the watchword
Dragons and spells
Means to conquer
All the power
To settle down
In the land and make the law

It's the time
To unify the realms
From the north
Down to the south
Kneel before them
Fear of dying
Feel secure and to live in peace

Skulls, reigning kings blood
Darkness remains
Lost to the crown
Death on this walls

Dragons died
The power lost
Time went by
In decay
Blood spilled
Corrupted and gone
The only way a revolution

Usurper rises
To avenge
His time has come
No more pain
You'll see fall
All the kings
Merciless tyrants
You'll watch them die

Back to the narrow sea, the only chance to live for
Come back to avenge them all
Fire and blood will rise again with a new blood
She will refuse denial
She'll set the world on fire

I have seen fall
Kind and wicked kings
Greed and lies
Where the throne remains

I'll be here forever....
Hundred of winters have passed....
And hundred more will pass before they see my end...
