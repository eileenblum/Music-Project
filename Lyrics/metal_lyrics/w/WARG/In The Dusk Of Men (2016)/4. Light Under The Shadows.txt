The last of my kind, hidden in the shadows,
Last fighting man of a noble race
Running from evil deep in the forest
My life back again when I saw her face

She's and elf you're a mortal man
Forget her 'cause you will die
Or prove you can be relied
Get back the light for me

Between the sorrow
I'll fight the ruin for him
With no tomorrow
From the darkness of these days
I'll face the pain
To make them understand
I need his light to shine my way

My journey leads me to the land in darkness
Recover the light from the dark lord's crown
Death I may find on this hopeless quest
She helps me out so I won't fall down

The light is mine, I will hunt you down
Run fast, now the beast is out
This path ends with your death
Her soul you shall not get

He's cut the crown
He's found my death for me
To help me scape
From the darkness of these days
He's fought the beast
To make them understand
I need his light to shine my way

There could be joy caged amid the weeping days
There's a light, under the shadow of death
There is hope in the call of a merciless pain
If I get to see her dance again

In this dark night, from madness and horror I run
In this night, the daughter of twilight awaits
Nightingale, in the winds of autumn you dance
Tinuviel, a star in the winter remains

Doom fell, she lost her will
As the day broke into the deepest night
Trapped in mortality
Her immortal being received his chain

Wake up again but the pain's not over
The rage of the beast is upon the land
My most dear friend will face its evil
His own fate fulfilled on this tragic night

You're and elf he's a mortal man
Forget him, he'll make you die
Reject your eternal life
There will be no more to cry

You've cut the crown
(I've cut the crown)
You've found your death for me
(I've found my death for you)
To help me scape
From the darkness of these days
And from now on
Our paths will lead beyond
Together roaming to the confines of the world

There could be joy caged amid the weeping days
There's a light, under the shadow of death
There is hope in the call of a merciless pain
If I get to see her dance again

In this dark night, from madness and horror I run
In this night, the daughter of twilight awaits
Nightingale, in the winds of autumn you dance
Tinuviel, a star in the winter remains

A star in the winter remains
