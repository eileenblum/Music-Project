Bringer of terror to men
Greatest of all calamities
Your armor, tenfold of shield
Your wish, you kill when you will

You've made the strong fall and die
You ousted the king from his home
Under his mountain you reign
In troubled paths now he roams

You thief, do not be shy
Step into the light
Tell me who you are
I did not smell your kind

I come from under the hill
And here is where my path led
I am who walks unseen
The one who comes from bag-end

The skies are burning tonight
And your souls long for impending death
But I will ignore all your cries
Now dwell where your greed has led

My teeth like swords rip your flesh
My claws, spears, crack your bones
My wings will cause a hurricane
My breath will fire your souls

You've seen the darkness before
You've faced the fear and won
But now your luck is no more
For I'm the greatest of all

You liar, why do you hide
Thief in the shadows you are
Behold my grandeur
I will burn your lies

I have no lies for you
Oh, magnificent one,
I am the barrel rider
The wearer of luck

The skies are burning tonight
And your souls long for impending death
But I will ignore all your cries
Now dwell where your greed has led

And now, fear my rage
I am fire
So now, face the pain
I am death

I am fire
I am death

You burglar, don't run from me
Cause I will set you free
Go back to the light
I will burn all your sins

I am no sinner at all,
Oh, tyrannical one,
Just the riddle maker
Who found the ring on his path

The skies are burning tonight
And your souls long for impending death
But I will ignore all your cries
Now dwell where your greed has lead

And now, fear my rage
I am fire
So now, the end has come, face the pain
I am death
