A dark horizon when the weak just waits to die
Black veils are falling when the honest fails and lies
Gloom clouds are coming as the brave run from the fight
The storm is closing as the mighty loose their might

The vultures wait for us... as we're their prey
If nothing ever changes... we're doomed to fail
Hyenas clench their teeth... now comes their feast
We kill the hope that's left... awake the beast

Cry, from the flames
Nothing ever changes
In this world
The skies are turning red

Eternal sadness when the will to fight just fades
And endless night will come as our pride lies in the sand
Dawn of despair when we push faith to the grave
Perpetual darkness as we reach the dusk of men

And now why can't we see... it's not the path
This man-forsaken earth's... a wasted land
Shall we not realize... it's in our hands
To right this time the wrong that we've done to the world

World, down in flames
Nothing's going to change
If we fail
The skies are turning red

This is the time to right the wrong, It's time for us to

Rise, from the flames
We fight for a change
In our world
The skies we'll try to mend
