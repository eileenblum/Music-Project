In dark time of evil gods I rise (I pray)
Easy to take life, but not feeling alive (the law of the strong)
Many suffer rules, cannot scape, I live in sorrow
But with my faith I will survive

They will try, shut off your mind to the end 'til you see God

God! God! They will kill for
GOD! God! They make suffer
Burning, raping, mutilating
Everything is in God's name!

I'm beyond your reach outside the light (I fight)
Wondering why God allows your lies (he's mute and blind)
All of human deaths, by greed of the saints, feeding on their blood
I will put an end to all this madness!

They will try to blind your eyes to the end until you see God

God! God! They will kill for
God! God! They make suffer
Burning, raping, mutilating
Everything is in God's name!

In a dark age I have to live
As it was in ancient times

God was not who won the fate of mankind in the past
Greed, masquerading as holiness, cursed by evil
Dropping his disguise, the whole mad truth will just destroy us
But I live and learn, I fight and teach them to live without you

God! God! They will kill for
God! God! They make suffer
Burning, raping, mutilating
Everything is in God's name!

All minds I release from all their lies (my fate!)
You will not have to kill in your lord's name (written in blood)
Your sins will not save you, send you straight to the burning hell
We only need a soul ready to shine!

They will try, take all the lives to the end until you see God

In a dark age I have to live
As it was in ancient times
