Among the shadows in a misty London's night
Await the darkness of a devil in disguise
The same old job in the same old street tonight

A sudden chill is new to her
Feeling the blade torn inside

Time will hide
Buried deep with their lives
A dark secret lost
When the knife cut the rose
That night

Forbidden love
Royal blood has gone too far
Silence required
All her compeers must pay the price
A hunter hiding
Leads the problem to an end...

Sweet painful death by the unknown
If you need a name, call him Jack!

Time will hide
Buried deep with their lives
A dark secret lost
When the knife cut the rose
That night

Dark will hide
By the blade of the knife

She will feel no more pain
She's a sinner
Her silence now will remain...
It's the same winner

Threat is gone with their lives
Safe is the crown
Find their doom in the knife
Rose is cut
Feeling the ripper inside

Time will hide
Buried deep with their lives
A dark secret lost
When the knife cut the rose
That night

Dark will hide
By the blade of the knife

Time will hide
Buried deep with their lives
A dark secret lost
When the knife cut the rose
That night

Then the ripper was gone
They'll just know Jack the Knife
