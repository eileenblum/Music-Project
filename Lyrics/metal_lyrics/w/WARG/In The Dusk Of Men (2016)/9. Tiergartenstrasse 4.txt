And now the suffering crawls

The cries of the innocent
Lost in oblivion sands
Inhuman atrocities
That only men can make

They were considered as
The life unworthy of life
Feel the void, a dark fear
When the law justifies their crimes
(their god-damned crimes)

Stay in line
Tears in vain when the pain is real
Void and fear
Welcome to Tiergarten 4 (Vier)
Stay in line
Human rights buried in lies
Fear and cries
The foundations of the Third Reich

Inside the void of fear

When the pain is all they've got
Sorrow will remain at last
They're lives without a soul
Heading to their final call

Considered empty corpses
They're judged unfit to live
To grant them no more pain
Hypocrisy reveals its teeth

Stay in line
Tears in vain when the pain is real
Void and fear
Welcome to Tiergarten (StraÃe) 4 (Vier)
Stay in line
Human rights buried in lies
Fear and cries
The foundations of the Third Reich

The victims of the greatest lies
Sentenced to die by their own kind
A "mercy death" to the sick ones
A sacrifice
The face of evil taking form
To kill the unborn in their womb
They were denied to live their lives
Then sacrificed

Hidden in the shadows
Dark plan to unleash the pain
People unable to work
Are unable to feed themselves

Stay in line
Tears in vain when the pain is real
Void and fear
Welcome to Tiergarten (StraÃe) 4 (Vier)
Stay in line
Human rights buried in lies
Fear and cries
The foundations of the Third Reich

Willkommen to Tiergarten Vier

(Human eradication
Madness and sorrow remains
Controlled marriage for healthy sons
And the wheel spins again)
