[Music and lyrics: Luis Carlos]

My loyal traitors
This precious throne you'll never have
Thieves and betrayers
I heard you talk behind my back
But you won't get away
you won't try other day
It will be mine forevermore
Now I need friend
who will ease my pain
I must be told of good advise

[Pre-chorus]
Those that will climb on their king
clouds of treason dwell on their minds
to suppress their sick will
Fallen axe is what they must find

[Chorus:]
Hail the king
You will bow to me
Or by my sword
From your lives I'll set you free

The blackest future
This cold blood tyrant we must endure
Bloody solution
A revolution we should arise
But this cannot be real
we have no time to heal
We have to take the throne again
We keep ignoring orders
We keep following others
overthrow the king is what we try

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo LC]

A king with no pride
the lands with no lord
a wolf in disguise
Nevermore
Don't let them take your courage
Don't let them take your crown
Dissolve their bloody bondage
their heads be thrown
And I won't hear their lament
ignore their pity lies
Lead all their lives to torment
I'll drown their cries

[Solo Oscar]

You bloody bastards
I want to show you a great machine
This bell of gold
In the whole kingdom you will hear
But you won't see the trap
you will meet your fate
and this will be your final step
It's is the end of reason
I have killed all the treason
The phantom menace has declined

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
