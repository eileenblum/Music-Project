[Music: Luis Carlos/Javi; lyrics: Javi]

Lights turn on, city awakes
One more day in life
People feel, anger and hate
In a living hell of lights
Falling dreams, lethal winds
Toxic rain, God is dead
All mankind goes to destroy
The entire mother earth
Explode, disturb, death, as I see

[Chorus:]
See the world in flames
All made by the men
Who like to see the pain
And make the angels cry
Hear the voice of death
Laughing all in hell
For our burning souls
Condemned to the end

You can play with your soul
For money and fucking fame
When you die and go to hell
None hears your screams
Burning bones, rotten skin
Poisoned blood, a sick place
The fate of men will be decided
By monsters with no soul
In your grave you can see...

[Chorus]

Flames, eating all in their way
War, streets full of bodies
Don't pray and waste your life
All you must do is fight
Against the evil in the earth, now!

[Solo LC]

Flames, eating all in their way
War, streets full of bodies

It's the end, no more days
To see the sun's light
In the chaos of the land
Your tears turn to blood
Falling dreams, lethal winds
Toxic rain, God is dead
When you die and go to hell
None hear your screams
Cry, feel the pain as you seeâ¦

[Chorus]

(I see hell, I feel death)
