[Music: Luis Carlos/Dani/Javi; lyrics: Luis Carlos]

Broken promises made by unfaithful men
Planting seeds of misery
We harvest in our way
This journey through darkness began
Hold the scythe of death
The cold that is freezing my mind
Turns everything to red

[Pre-chorus]
A waste of men
A waste of time
A waste of lives... For nothing
High rank tells
Official lies
That will end the lives of men

[Chorus 1]
You buried my heart deep in this tomb
The grave of the undead crow
War will be damned nothing remains
No more sorrow
Empty hollow
Vengeance will be laid

The light holding my sanity
Is fading away
In the valley where sadness remains
We harvest the pain
We ask for oblivion to come
Wash our sins away
The cold keeps destroying our minds
My mind

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2:]
You buried my heart deep in this tomb
The grave of the undead crow
Twisting my soul beyond the pain
Deep inside my mind
Freezing my heart in winter's snow
The grave of the undead crow
War will be damned nothing remains
No more sorrow
Empty hollow
Vengeance will be laid

Once more, pure lust, one goal
So spoke the raven
Once more, your lust, no soul
Won't stop to save them

None called, you left me alone
I feared the day would never come
When I could get away
The dark red road would take me home
And when the war called the young
I feared the night set in this hole
Oh, how to get away
The dark red road showed the way
It showed the way... the way
None warned, you were in command
The fate of men were in your hands
How could they get away
The dark red road to the fallen land
Your rotten soul killed all the hope
Fearing the night that filled this hole
Running far away
The dark red road paving my way
[Solo LC]

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
Why should I rape,
Why should I kill,
Why should I die for you

Following orders...
Just following orders
Once more, we kill, we die
So spoke the raven
And now, with rage, we ask
Why should I rape,
Why should I kill,
Why should I die
