[Music: Luis Carlos/Javi; lyrics: Luis Carlos]

Back when we started
None gave a dime
On the edge we move
Dawn of our time
Darkness fell upon us - Sadness
No mercy shown - Pain
We carry on - Fighting
A new day's grown

[Chorus 1:]
Out of the darkness
back from the pain
out of the darkness
we'll fight on again
Back from the shadows
into the light
back from the shadows
we march

Through darkness, we'll try again
We're marching on and from the ashes we'll rise

Shortcut to madness
the road we take
We said it clear
we're here to stay
Into the future - Rising
A voice is heard - Flames
Rise from the ashes - Fighting
Rise from the pain

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Into the future
our voice will be heard
over the anger
over the pain
Into the future
our flag will held high
over the anger
we'll rise

[Solo LC]

Back from the ashes, back from the pain
Back from the shadows, we'll march again

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

Back from the shadows, back from the pain
Into the future, we'll fight on again
Back from the shadows, into the light
Back from the shadows, we march again
