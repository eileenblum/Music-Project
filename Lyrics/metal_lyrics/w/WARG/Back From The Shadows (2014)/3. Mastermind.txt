[Music: Javi/Dani; lyrics: Javi]

Skies, open up
Showing the beginning war
The enemies of mankind
And they all must die!
But they don't know the enemy is here now
They must fight against the evil in their minds
The evil cause by ignorance can be destroyed
With faith in metal in my heart
I fight till the end

All come the fight comence: it's a war, no clemence here
No way I pay my life: the evil starts to scream
They cannot win this land: don't break these iron walls
I stand with all my faith: no mercy and no retreat

[Chorus 2:]
Darkness forces, attacking my dreams
My head is going to explode
In my brain I have the key
To cast and end to all
To cast this end to all

These wounds never heal, you must protect your life
You are the best creation in this hole called universe
Do not let anyone dictate the rules for you
You think for yourself you have the power to do

Dust and misery: the dust begins to clear
So that I can see: the fear of my enemies
At last they will suffer: in wails and howls they burn
Creations of my mind?: or is it all real!

[Chorus 1:]
Malignant forces, breaking my mind
I am an empty soul
I cannot feel
Anything, this can't be true

[Chorus 2]

You try to hit me
You don't have world to run
You try to bite me
I'll break you fucking soul
You can't scare me
I'm brave and proud as man
It's the time to kill you
I'm powered mastermind

[Solo Ãscar]
[Solo LC]

Don't cry, open up your eyes, for me

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
