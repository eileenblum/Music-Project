[Music and lyrics: Luis Carlos]

Beyond the edge of time
like thunder in the sky
we stand to face the pain
an evil with no name
Casting the coldest fire
bringing the darkest light
controlling your desire
ignoring all the cries

[Pre-chorus]
Cast the fear
and wrought your ghost upon the floor
unleash old demons of forgotten lore

[Chorus]
Ride with me
Face the flames in the night
the beast awaits in my mind
Fight with us
Accept the embrace of the light
Denial
You will ride with me
Face the flames in the night
the beast awaits in our minds
You will fight with us
Accept the embrace of the light
Of dying embers we rise

[Solo Ãscar]
[Solo LC]

The wind will change its course
once we're strong enough
the origin of your feelings
now has a new born source
Inside insidious fear
you're in control no more
there's none left in here
and then my will be done

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

With dying shadows we ride
and feel the wargs arise

[Solo LC]

Fear tonight
the beast is stalking
Nevermind
we're coming after you
Cold inside
your mind we're taking
loose control
On with the warg you'll ride

The earth will crack tonight as the wargs arise

[Chorus]
