[Music: Dani/Luis Carlos/Javi; lyrics: Luis Carlos]

I am the sword
Casting the darkness away
I am reborn
Free from my sins is the trade
My life's the price
I have to pay to liberate my soul
My watch begins
My past is taking its toll

[Pre-chorus 1:]
I am the watcher in the night
I fight the demons of your mind
Just give me faith to survive
They say we will not stand
We live to defend this land
Just give me strength when I die

I am the Fire
Burning against the cold
I shall not take
Nor wife, nor lands and no gold
The watch's my life
You must understand there is nothing more
My will be done
Living and dying at my post

[Pre-chorus 1]

[Chorus:]
On this cold night binding vows have been made
We'll guard the realms 'til the last of our days

[Solo LC]

I am the shield
Guarding the realms of men
I am the horn
Waking the sleepers then
I pledge my life
To the night's watch from this night and on and on
My time has come
And I will fight for them all

[Pre-chorus 2:]
We are the watchers on the wall
We fight to fulfill our oath
Just give us faith to survive
They say we will not stand
We live to defend this land
Just give us strength when we die

[Chorus x2]

Night gathers, my watch begins and will not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I am the sword in the darkness, the light that brings the dawn, the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.

[Solo Oscar]
