[Music: Luis Carlos/Javi; lyrics: Javi]

[Solo LC]

There, lay, in a far away land
A place with a story of brave and cruel men
The barbarian life code
Sends their people to battle, die for their gods
The almighty gods in their kingdom of gold
By the sword they rule the world
Fear doesn't exist, prey for their blessings
And your souls will stay with them.

[Chorus 1:]
Come with us cheer and drink
In the rooms of Valhalla
Fight with honor in your life
Never retreat or escape and see
[Chorus 2:]
See your brothers live in the
Glorious land of the free
And share, with your brothers share
The divinity of brave men

[Solo LC]

We live with the frozen dark winds
The ice and snow are running through my veins
I stay strong with my axe
Rivers of blood flowing down the hills
When the battle ends
Valkyries raise the bodies of the dead
Carrying them away
Through the skies to the golden castle of Asgard

[Chorus 3:]
Fight with honor in your life
Cross the gates of Valhalla
Come with us cheer and drink
In the hall of the brave and see

[Chorus 2]

These are the tales
From a faraway land in the north
When those thunders roar in the sky
They're fighting!
Pagan hammers crash
Against lightning swords
Fighting 'til their last breaths
Until their last breaths!

[Solo LC]

Great builders with warrior souls never give up
They conquer with merciless might the world overseas
With the drakars wearing skins of steel spreading terror
They were drinking some mead in the skulls of their enemies
It's the legend of the viking land never be erased
Left their bloody footprint still on the earth
Hear their scream aloud in the frozen winds for thousand years
With gods they ruled the world, for three hundred years

[Solo LC]

Masters of their destiny
All it's written on a freezing piece of stone
The sacred stone
That recounts the terrible ending of their world
It was Ragnarok
The apocalypse that will come upon us all
But do not be afraid
At the end of it all you will meet them again

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

There's no more to tell,
Remember what you have heard
And never forget
Come with us at the greatest feast
There you cannot die
Share with them all divinity and fame
In the glorious land of the free.
