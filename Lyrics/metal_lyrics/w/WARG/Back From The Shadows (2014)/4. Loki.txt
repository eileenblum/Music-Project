[Music: Dani/Luis Carlos; lyrics: Luis Carlos]

Master of cold infinite treason
You're the trickster god
Ruins of a lost forgotten feeling
That abandoned you
Madness bringing this world to sadness
And nowhere more
Loki, cruel deity and wise tormentor
Of the remaining gods

[Pre-chorus:]
Raising your anger
You'll cry in the dark

[Chorus:]
In oblivion he'll remain
And his sins will wash away
Prays his vengeance will arrive
With the end of all kind
He's chained forever... just hear his cries
But from abyss... he will arise

Liar, you've been doomed to face
A hateful life
Traitor, your punishment starts
Bound to the rock
Coward, your destiny is being chained
With your son's guts
Loki, you won't see the end
The torment began

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

I'll be back, and you'll suffer
Hear my cries, I will bring the end
Then you'll die, fall forever
With Ragnarok, I will take revenge

Torment you, they torment you
They seal your fate for the evil you do
This nightmare's gone, the nightmare's gone
Lost in the maze it's killing you
You will return, yes you will return
The suffering and the end will come
The gods will fall, they will all fall
And you will take revenge, revenge

[Solo LC]

Master of cold infinite treason
You're the trickster god
Traitor, your punishment starts
Bound to the rock
Madman, your insane behavior
Will carry death
You've doomed the earth

Raising your anger
Bringer of sorrow
Insatiable hunger
You'll cry in the dark

[Chorus]
