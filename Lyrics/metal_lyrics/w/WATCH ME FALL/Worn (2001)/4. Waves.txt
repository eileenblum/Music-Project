The soil I'm lying on is cooling down with the vanishing daylight
And bitter are these tears in my eyes
They're slowly flowing down my cheek like glowing pearls
But those pearls are for the swine

The mind behind this weak body tries to isolate
Not willing to crystallize the reasons for my grief
I try to figure out how I came to this state
Where all the paths lead me just further from the light

Time flows on like a stream and passes the dead of the night
But it just pushes me further from delight
I feel my life sinking far too deep
When this self-deception won't let me fall asleep

The sky breathes black but still it shines
Like a halo upon my mental darkness
I'm bleak, cold and blond as the lack of will makes the waves roll in...

Here I ride again on these waves of misery
I'm all but sane as I close my eyes
And try to see the stars which shine no light
