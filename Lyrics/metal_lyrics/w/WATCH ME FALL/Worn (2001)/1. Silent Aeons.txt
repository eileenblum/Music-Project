This silence has tied me up so tight that I can't breathe
The night will pass away before I dare to fall asleep
?Within this trabquil darkness I dread to close my eyes
The stars so cold upon me shine from pitch-black sky

I know what's beyond there
The astral secrets reveal to me
The darkness rising, devouring this wretched earth
My soul is sinking into the timeless void

I fear to watch the calmness of the moonlit sea
For I know what waits under that deceptice serenity
I shiver to think the silent hills after sundown
The blackness so vast upon me, heavy on my mind

A vision of sheer terror right before my eyes
Travelling through the aeons till the end of time
A glimpse of something that was meant to be concealed
It's a dream I won't wake up from, turned to reality

I've seen what lies ahead
The mysteries revealed as night prevails 
The darkness rising, devouring my wretched mind
My soul is screaming for final relief
