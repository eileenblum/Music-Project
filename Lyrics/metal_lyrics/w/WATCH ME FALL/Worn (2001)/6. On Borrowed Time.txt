Light of saving grace - glowing dawn at the end of our world
The morning sun will rise as soon as mankind dies
Our last and final chapter is soon to be closed (relief)...

Wandering pale, our presence here in vain
Tomorrow's gone and our lives scattered in yesterdays
The shades are closing in, heart of this earth now bleeds
Last lights flickering, our journeys turned to shadow chasing

All things bee said and done, this road has come to an end
And this is the road wew can't walk back and start all over again
What was pure is stained in dirt, all fragile torn to dust
This supreme king of all the living sits on the bough he cuts

This place without meaning, these times without a reason
Only little men with their little lives,  little deeds in their little minds
Once so proud standing tall, we walked this earth so strong
Now we just born, waste and die for our good times have passed by
