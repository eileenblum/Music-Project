the wind somberly sighs your name in the trees
The waves whisper of the love long since gone
As I hearken to them, my loneliness grows ever bitter
Evanescent are the moments of joy in this world

[chorus]
Each night when I close my eyes I see you again
You take my hand and together we'll fly away
(and reach for the stars...)
But in the end your imga begins to wane
So every time my fate is one and the same
(you are drifitng away...)

A lifetime of pain and regret reserved for me
Just unfulfilled dreams for the rest of my years

I still believe that we were meant to be one
Each dawn I die again when I know you are gone
(and I've been torn apart...)

"If a dragonfly dances too close to a candle it will burn", you said
My imminence, my burning flame made you leave?
But isn't it so that one must cut the wings of love so it won't fly away?

[chorus]

All my life, all my life I've been destined ti wander in shades
All these tears, all these tears I've cried in vain for you to return
And this pain, and this heart-rending pain is all I have left of you
How I've loved, how I've loved you more than gods could dream

If only, even for once, I could see your face...again...
