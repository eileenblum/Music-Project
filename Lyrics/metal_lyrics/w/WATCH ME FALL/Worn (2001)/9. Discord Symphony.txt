In a moment of a nightfall, treshold of a storm
Overture fades and the shades grow deep

All alone, forced to witness same play every day
Ground moans in black, newborn leaves fall and decay

For so long neither the wind has blown
Nor the sun shone to dry the pus in my wounds

Gradually spirit of our age dissipates
Dead emotions can't replace frustation and disgrace

From the cradle to the grave
Dancing in dark, atonal haze
Helical path leading downwards...
Maybe it's time for us to leave
Helter skelter we achieved
Failed creation of our symphony...

And then the pain strikes again...

Drawing last poison breath, as the rain falls
Our creations of violence, nowthe drain calls

All our time spent to solve this mount of troubles
The more I try I dissolve to all fading gray
