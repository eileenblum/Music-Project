My mind's remains come to life again
While ny sould awakes from my sence's Night
But at once another dark's spreading around...
To feel if I were a dead...in Hell...
Cold and wet floor under my soles
And black walls're crying ever pain
If the Black walls cry...or is it the
Night...
Angels' chorus or Demons' shout??...
