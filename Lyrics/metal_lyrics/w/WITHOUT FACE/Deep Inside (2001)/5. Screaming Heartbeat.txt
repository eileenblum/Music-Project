crying, shouting
screaming, yelling
you must feel
sights of vanished spirits
don't stop here my fellow
make yourself at home

screaming heartbeat in the silence
something moving in the darkness
as if you were being watched

your hand is on the handle,
step across the threshold
come step one step higher
meet the last empire

softly, cracky planks
softly cracky steps
dusty footprints before you
silent darkness behind you

screaming heartbeat in the silence
something moving in the darkness
as if you were being watched

there's only space around you
now you bear something new
you think they're speaking to you
but only thr old floor
crackles under your soles

screaming heartbeat...

as if you were being watched

crying, shouting,
screaming, yelling
you must feel
sights of vanished spirits
don't step here my fellow
make yourself at home

now look at here!
you'll see the death
you'll see over the door
the faces in the wall
I'll give eternity
help me to build our city.
