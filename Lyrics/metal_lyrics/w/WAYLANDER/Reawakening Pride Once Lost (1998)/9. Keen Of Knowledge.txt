Truth, the root of the tongue
Wisdom, the breath of speech
Secrets untold, guarded forever
Shared with only the gifted few

Keen of knowledge, clear of vision
Earth's all consuming passion
Vital being to a life
Ruled by laws of the universe

Serenity beyond definition
Tranquillity beyond words
Bold in righteousness
Valiant in justice

In the sacred grone at nightime
Rites performed, so divine
Invoking the power of the gods
Within constraints of nature's laws

And in the stones
The circle of stones
Activating power
And from the earth
And the air
And the universe
Answer my call
