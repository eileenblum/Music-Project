Blooded to the battle
Born to the fight
Sowed in the soul
Thrill of the fight
Taking no prisoners
To die for a cause
Honour and glory
To win without loss

Prowess and power
Stealth and speed
Practice of combat
Take pain without heed
Boundless endurance
Man without peer
Natural instincts
Stay alive through it all

The world was young
The laws were true
To kill or be killed
These men were proud
And true to their word
Not modern day cowards
Who kill in cold blood
