As the dark clouds they do gather
I sing my last lament
For the ravens they do gather
My strength is almost spent
My life force it dispreses
The darkness now descends
My death is close at hand [x2]

To Gae Bulg*, my companion
I have put my trust in thee
But the darkness of the grave
Claims us all, eventually
I bid farewell to my loved ones
They and my kinsmen, please remember me

Through sacred Lugh, my father
My name will never die
The deeds I have achieved
Insures my name amongst my brothers
Throughout the sacred green of Eireann
My name will echo in the valleys

Cu Chulainn Hound of Ulster
Cu Chulainn Bane of Medhabh
Cu Chulainn Hound of Ulster
Cu Chulainn Champion of men

Son of an immortal
Immortal he shall be
Journey to the other world
To live eternally

From Emain Macha
To Tara's hall
Your name will live as legend
And to your memory
I give a toast
Dwell with the fairy host

A farewell to a hero
Your mortal days are gone
Your soul now doth fly
As free as the sun

[Gae Bulg means "Death Spear" in Gaelic and was the spear of a hero from Irish mythology named Cuchulainn, for whom the song is written]
