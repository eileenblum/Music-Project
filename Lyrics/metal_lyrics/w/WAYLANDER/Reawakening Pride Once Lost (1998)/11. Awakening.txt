A mistery around me
Eminating from the land
Only true kindred spirits
May even hope to understand

A voice I hear which is calling out to me
A message all around when my mind is free
Speaking in whispers thrown from the wind
Out from my surroundings calling out to me

Haunted by the canopy of green
I blaze of blue and emerald fire
A finer sight I've rarely seen
And I dine on awe alone

Swirling ashadows
Dance upon the water still
And sky and cloud vie for prominence
On the surface calm
A lone deed
Creating ripples alike waves
And all along the surface
Now consequence in journey

I breathe I feel my lungs
I breathe I feel my soul
I breathe I fill alive
I am alive!

Green surrounds me
The wind in my hair
Fast flowing waters
The hills and the vales

Ignited by passion
Most purent by far
My life I now fashion
I live for his hour

Free to live
Free to roam
Free to think
Free as the wind

Elation I peel
So hard to comprehend
As i stand alone
Upon Anu's land

I have come home
I have been found
The way it once was
Is as it shall be
