Extinguish all flame, ritually renew
Arise with the morning, gather the dew
Fire on the water, healing our ills
Cast spells of protection, gather your will
Call calm from the waters, the Earth and the sky
Invoke the patrons of kin and of tribe
Banish ill fortune, put paid to all pain
The circle keeps turning again and again

Sunwise in the circle turn, twin fires of better turn
Skyclad, to the beat of the drum
Twin fires of Beltine burn
Sun and moon, Earth and stars, twin fires of BeltÃ­ne burn

A new dawn heralds the triumph
Cold winter melts away
Aeonghas MagÃ³g Agus AnÃº
On this day hold sway
Make love in the forests, cavort in the fields
Anoint the blossom, increase the yield
Give toast to the gods and imbibe the wine
An Cailleach transformed to maiden divine

The rhythms of the seasons
The cycles of the moon
Feel the power of the elements
Sun shines on you
As the sun shines down on you

By Oak, give strength
By Rowan, grant magic
By Hazel, bestow wisdom
Spring from winter's darkness
Into invigorating light
And bathe in the warmth of the summer sun
Faoi dair, labhair neart
Faoi caorthann, deontas draiochta
Faoi coll, bhronnadh eagna
Earraigh Ã³ dorchadas gheiinhridh isteach i solas briomhar
Agus folcadh sa teas na grÃªine tsamhraidh
