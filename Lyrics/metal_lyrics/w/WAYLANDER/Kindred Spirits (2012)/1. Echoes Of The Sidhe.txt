Through the starless night time air they glide
Beyond the valley to the mountainside
Bright colored haze of luminosity
Enigma from which mortal senses flee

Open your inner eye and you will truly see
Leave this walking world and dare, dare to dream

Echoes of the Sidhe - Resounds eternally
Echoes of the Sidhe - Reverberates in tragedy

Prophets of doom or people of the light?
Contradictory theories, who is wrong, who is right?
Our mortal existence is but a blink of the eye
To those who are perennial and rarely do die

Bow your heads in shame, you who desecrate
You who violate our sacred seats of power
Your actions alone have sealed your fate
An ancient curse will stalk your life for ever more
