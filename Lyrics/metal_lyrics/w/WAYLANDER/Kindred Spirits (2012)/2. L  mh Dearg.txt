Accept the challenge, to contest for this soil
Victory will come, with blood sweat and toil
Knife through the waves, a province to claim
Defeat unacceptable, can't live with the shame

Sever the word hand, hurt to the shore
Infamous sacrifice of legend and lore
Anointed in blood, an ill-omened fate?
Strife without end which nothing can sate

Rise above that, which divides us
True love for this land must sustain
Bow to the goddess both planter and gael
True love for our land must sustain

LÃ¡mh Dearg - Raise the red hand high
LÃ¡mh Dearg - Abu
LÃ¡mh Dearg - Ulaidh Go Brea
LÃ¡mh Dearg - Abu

Conflict, oppression, atrocity, pain
Dwell in the past with nothing to gain

A bloody hand to unite us, lessen the strife
A true king who takes this land as his wife
A hero reborn from an age now past by

Who embraces the truth and never will lie
Adapt to the paradox we have become
Accept that the evils can't be undone
Embrace the future, learn from the past
Unite the clans, the die have been cast
