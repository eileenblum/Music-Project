Deep they dug, the giant's grave stood alone
Ravenous for profit, they coldly quarried all the stone

They sneered at the whispers of ancient magic
They launched as they counted their ill gotten gain

But the gods of the land, unconquered
Spoke with elemental clarity
A reminder of the true power
That endures beneath our feet
And from the depths the waters
Flowed and rose and rose again
And drowned the dreams of those who did not believe
