Kick heels to ones haunches, adrenaline rising,
Thundering lightning, tolling hard on your Reign.
Rolling the gradients, heart and hoof beat as one,
(Lifeâs) trial of endurance; Championâs portion I claim.

Quick to the fight, yet swiftly to love
Questing the knowledge seems barely enough
Which one is mighty, the pen or the Sword?
(In) tandem assault, we seek our reward

Onwards!

I fear not my death, my soul will endure.
Eternal flame burning with passion most pure
Preserving Tradition through story and song
Inscribed in memory, spiritual and strong.

Galloping Gaels,
Galloping Gaels,
Abu! Abu!
Galloping Gaels,
Galloping Gaels
Abu! abu!
Galloping Gaels, Galloping Gaels
Abu! Abu!

Death casts itâs shadow in raven black
Truth appears whiter, whiter than snow
Thoughts carried forth on a swift wind
Insight cuts sharper, sharper than steel.

Leap like the salmon, with vigour and zest,
Talents inherent the Gods did bequest,
Strive to be heroes, create Legends anew.
Ancestral reverence, olden ways renewed.
