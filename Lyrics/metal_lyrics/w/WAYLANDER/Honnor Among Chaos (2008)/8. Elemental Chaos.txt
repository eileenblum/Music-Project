Elemental Chaos, beg upon your knees,
Crushing resolve relentlessly,
Mankind, will reap the bitter seed,
Elemental chaos I foreseeâ¦â¦â¦â¦..

Hear the Earth God rumble with rage
(The) cruel whip of the wind devours all
Seas rising to touch the sky
Nature, consumed by fire

Like weeds theyâve cut the woodlands down
Terminal, our Planetâs disease
Accelerating cycles, that turn.
Air, sod, flame and tide.

Ignore the signs, embrace death
Kiss all, of your futures, goodbyeâ¦

The web of life is frozen
Silent victim for the Sun
The ice kingdom is melting
Drowning the hopes of man.

Splintering trees shock the silence
Echoes of doom in eternal winter.
No Gods of mortal man here do dwell,
Their frozen bones don snow white blankets.

Peasants, blinded blissfully
Maggots on our dying world.
