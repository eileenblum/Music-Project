There are many nations in this wide wide world
There are many religions in this wide wide world
Some people they worship, and others they do not
Some worship in private, others ram it down your throat!! 

The waste is so terrible which has eaten at our hearts
The land has been tarnished, old beliefs have been robbed
Religions of past millennium, mythomania and fear Replacing ancient deities, 
with their false gods. 

A thousand witches died
So they burnt ten thousand more
Heretics become fair game
Anointed in their own blood
No rhyme or no reason
For their self obsessive beliefs
Utter contempt to their faith
We'll neither forgive nor forget. 

They spread their disease throughout many a nation
With their silvery tongues, they established their lies
The life that was noble, so fierce and so proud
Has been stolen from us, truth and honour denied. 

Brainwashed of the Nazarene, zealots of Islam
Believe or be damned, obey the great scam
Plague of the Ages, decaying man's soul
Eternal stagnation, their selfish goal 

Are you the one to obey the great scam??
