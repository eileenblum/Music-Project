Responsibility is the last thing on his mind
Identity crisis enforced by his peers
Got to run away to save freedom of choice
Cheating destiny to alleviate leadership fears.
Wasting time to sate his selfish desires
Disconnecting all ties with what has went before
Not one man will die under his command
Constant dilemma, chilling to the core. 

And by an amazing twist of fate
All paths lead to destiny
Irreversible situation arising
No honourable man would flee. 

He was birthed beneath a waxing moon
Beltaine's festival of fire the time
The wise and holy men proclaimed
That all the signs were prophecied 

To rule was preordained
Written in the stars
To rule was preordained
Magic in the air
To rule was preordained
Born to reign
To rule was preordained
Born to rule 

Enforced training from his youth
Time to face inevitable truth
To be the fire attracting the flies
His enemies come and many will die
