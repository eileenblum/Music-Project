The light and the dark, a marriage eternal
Sundrenched, exultant, darkclad yet infernal
Chaos or order, evil or good
Definitions abound, clear cut yet confusing. 

Birth, youth, maturity, and death
Wheel of life keeps turning
Immortal species spiralling forever
Can never unravel the endless knot. 

Perceptions - one man's dream
Perceptions - another man's nightmare
Perceptions - follow your own path
Perceptions - countless possibilities 

Give way to instinctive urges
Alter ego wells within
Reaction to the conscience
A force too powerful to deny
Try to pacify the rage
Darker side is part of you
A device for your survival
Essential, not altogether evil. 

Ofttimes I dance in the light
On occasion I stalk the dark
Light and dark, day and night
My soul enshrined, dual delight. 

Who can say what is light and what is dark?
Mankind perceives life to satisfy his own desires
Yet, the wheel turns, the seasons fall And unabated the knot continues its 
endless journey
Of life and death.
