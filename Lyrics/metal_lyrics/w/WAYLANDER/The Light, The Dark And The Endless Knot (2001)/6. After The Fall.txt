Chaos - signs in the sky
Ruins - seas will rise
Drowning - a watery grave
Demise - immortals to die 

After the fall
Atlantis sunk not killing them all
After the fall
Lords of foresight did flee
After the fall
Knowledge gathered aeons old
After the fall
Preserve all illuminated lore 

On crafts of mystic arts they came
Borne by the wind
On the crest of a wave they rode
Children of the sun
Across the oceans East and West
Seeking chosen lands
To be guide to the race of man
Welcome magical fleet
Be they of the Heavens
Be they of the Earth
Be they sons of demons
Be they sons of man 

Wherever they go, civilization will grow
Enlightened thoughts, pupils to be taught
Figures of awe, deities to be
Chosen emerald shore, De Danann roar!!
