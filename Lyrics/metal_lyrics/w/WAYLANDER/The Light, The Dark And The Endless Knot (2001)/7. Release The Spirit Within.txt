Come sit with me
In this circle of stones
And dream
Journey with me. 

Hear the leaves they rustle
See but cannot really see
A presence in a dependent slumber
Alike a door without a key. 

Seeking, searching
Doubt an emotion I now leave behind
Seeking, searching
Fear an emotion I no longer comprehend. 

Music primal and soaring
Drumbeat of the universe
Eerie cosmic winds singing
The sighing of unborn stars. 

Focused to the ultimate point of trance
I march to the tune of eternity's dance. 

I navigate my own flight
Engrained thoughts, my insight
To leave behind my earthly shell
Delve deep within my depthless well. 

Flying through the astral plain
Unsure if you're insane
Echoes from the world of man
Dizzying distortions of space and time
Time has no meaning anymore
Begin to forget from whence you've come
Allow true power of thought to create
That which is reflected in your hear 

I was the seeker
MAny paths I have thread
I know now reality
Not what I've read. 

I am the master of my own mind
I am the master of my own destiny.
