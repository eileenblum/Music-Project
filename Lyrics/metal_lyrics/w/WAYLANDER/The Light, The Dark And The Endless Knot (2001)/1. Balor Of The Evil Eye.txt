Fomorian lord ruled with an iron hand
Piracy maintained by this darkened god
Tyrannical reign, o'er Eireann's sons
Starve and shame, into submission one and all 

Disciples of chaos - disrupting
Destroyer of order - dominating
Tipping the balance - oblivion
Extinguishing light - darkness 

Dominate de Danann, strip away then pride
Threat them like tenants, there's no place to hide
A tribute collected, heads hung in disgrace
Hollow eyes of defeat, proud race losing face. 

Balor - Evil Eye
One look - you will die
Balor - Evil Eye
Unleashed - strangled cry. 

There's one spark amongst the dying embers
Born to ignite red passions raging
Lugh Samildeanach, true inspiration
Equilibrium by sword and sorcery. 

Chaos king meets prince of light
Fulfilling omens of foresight
'Twas written blood must slay blood
Symbolic duel, redress the balance. 

Sword of Light
Quell the darkness
Shield of order
Vanquish the chaos
