Manipulating Earth's magic without giving in return
Consequences most dire, making even powerful men squirm
Mankind is forever the vermin infesting this world
Feel the sheer rage of Anu's retribution unfurled. 

Eruption in the air - water cascading
Tilting of the land - mountains toppling 

Winds whipping and lashing - hurricane
Screaming and raging - pouring rain
Rivers rising and rustling - tidal wave
Drowned bodies strewn - unmarked grave 

Slowly suffocate the Goddess
Have you no conscience at all?
Doomsday bells are chiming
Anu regenerates, mankind falls 

Global destruction, unprecedented scales
Disasters as natural as lady Anu's reign
Man has sown seeds of poison everywhere
Time for Anu to reap is now close at hand. 

Cleansing her domain to prepare for millenniums new
Survival solution, all diseases must be cured
The elements always harken to Anu's call
Vengeance belongs to Earth, Wind, Water, and Fire
