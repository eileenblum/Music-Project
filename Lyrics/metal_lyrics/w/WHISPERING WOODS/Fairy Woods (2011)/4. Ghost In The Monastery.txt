In the mist
Of the night
Stands a figure
Born of light.

Under moon's
Pale glow
Casts a shadow
In the meadow
Freezing heart
Brakes down to die.

Beware
Of the
Lightness
Within

Come to me
Take my soul
For I will be
Darken cold.

Down below
Under stars
Sun will die
All shattered

Nothing left
In the night
But the figure
Born of light.

In the shadows
Of the mind
Stands a figure
With cold sight.

Whispering tales
Of the past
Neverending
Silent craving
Freezing heart
Brakes down to die.

Beware
Of the
Darkness
Within

Come to me
Take my soul
For I will be
Darken cold.

Down below
Under stars
Sun will die
All shattered

Nothing left
In the night
But the figure
Born of light.
