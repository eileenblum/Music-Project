I feel like the trees are calling me...
I hear the call surrounding me

I follow the path to the woods...

Here, my soul will be free, tonight...
Like the stars will I be,
Shining gracefully...

Mother Gaia, show the way
To the place where we
Make eternity

Mother Gaia, give me now
Wisdom to unlock
My soul and set it free

I feel like the trees are calling me...

In the woods will I walk
To sing their song

Here, my soul will be free, tonight...
Like the trees will I be,
Singing gracefully...

Mother Gaia, show the way
To the place where we
Make eternity

The mist and the rain have taken over me
Swept away my dreams
Brought eternity
I am one with the night sky
Just, a spark of light.
