[Verse 1:]
In despair of the
Rhine maiden's wish
She will
Keep the gift
Of her beloved one
Wotan's ravens return
And darken the sky
The lovers betrayed
In the end all will die

[Verse 2:]
From one's heart
Comes devotion in time
But then
Siegfried misled
By the dwellers by Rhine
Ends up lingering in pain
His beloved one
Revenge he will get
As he strikes them with might

[Chorus:]
Siegfried my darling
Open your eyes
Caress my pain
Your memory will rise.
From the fire
The Ring will be purified
Waves will then flood the land
All will die.
