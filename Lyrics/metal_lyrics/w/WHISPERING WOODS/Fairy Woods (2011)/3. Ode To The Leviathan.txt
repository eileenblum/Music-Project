[Chorus:]
Hail
To this mighty beast
It will give us
Hope
For all barren souls
It will bring us peace

[Verse 1:]
You will crush
The others
And then stop
The chaos
And destroy
Your own
Creator!

[Verse 2:]
Take me deep
Down under
Where you have
Created
World for us
For all
Oh glory!

"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
(...)
Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
(...)
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
(...)
The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
(...)
Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride."
[Book Of Job:41, King James Version]
