[Verse 1:]
Dream away under mystic moon
Under shining stars
They will
Bring my heart to the
Place below under darken fears
Under hidden thoughts
By the
Dying hour I shall

[Chorus:]
Sing a song like the swans are singing
Bring forth light like the stars are bringing
Burn to ashes like the wood is burning
Free the dove which is now returning

Hide myself underneath my veil
Walk along this forsaken trail
In dark wind cursed I shall sail
See my tears turning into hail.

[Verse 2:]
Aphrodite was it once my name
Goddess born in sea
I was
Daughter of the Mighty
This will be my final fairytale
Written down on sand
By the
Dying hour I shall
