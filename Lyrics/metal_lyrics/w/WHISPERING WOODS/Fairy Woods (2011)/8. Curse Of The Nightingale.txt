Philomel of Pandion
The nightingale
Sat before the sun
And sang her song

Up up above
The gods will hear my call
Cursed is my heart
To sing forever in the dark...

Moon, my dearest
Be my guide
Light the forest
Shine with might

Ancient legends
Speak of me
Words with wisdom
Set... me free

Philomel of Pandion
The nightingale
Sat below the sun
She closed her eyes... and died.
