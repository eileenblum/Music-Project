Walk with me into the land of... Hades
Over Styx our paths will meet forever.
Cursed are the dreams of those who cross...

In the shadows we will be
Together in eternity
Dearest one my fate with thee
Sealed forever it will be

Searing is the grief within...
"Do not fear, I will return,
Forbidden is my name to speak
For I am Queen of the Underworld".
