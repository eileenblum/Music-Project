Cast down from Eden
In rain I will
Fall...
Asleep...

Hiding the sun
My clouds will then
Take me...
Away...

Misty is the path
To my mind
Clad in sorrow

Broken are my
Feeble wretched wings
In my dreams.

Falling to the ground
Whispering mellow sound
Silent sound...

Searching for the sky
Darken cloudy night
Silent night...

Sleeping angel
Rise into the light
Throw away your
Cursed agony
Follow mighty
Path to the stars
Be born again...
