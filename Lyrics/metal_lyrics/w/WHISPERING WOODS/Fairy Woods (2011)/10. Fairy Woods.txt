[Spoken intro:]
As I go down along the mystic path
I see fireflies reaching for the stars

[Chorus:]
Dreamy mist below the forests leaves
Sweeps away my darkest of dreams
The elder trees are awaiting my call
They open the ground, in sleep now I fall.

Inside the woods with the fairy name
Sits mother Gaia alone with her pain
Whispering the poem of wretched dreams
Hyperion's gone, the sun is in tears.

[Spoken:]
"Mother, are you there? The moon and the sun are my gift to you, shed the pain and bring forth the light."

Above the gloomy and sparkling flowers
Rests a beauty with heart cold and sour,
Her soul has been taken a long long time ago
Faustus himself, is dead and no more.

[Spoken:]
"Spirits of the woods, come to me and take my breath and light the sky, forever night."
