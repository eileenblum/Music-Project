Born into a world of loss
I have seen defeat			
And those who fall to misery		
The taint of heresy			
Death always smiles my way
But I still stand

As I yet draw breath
My voice shall resonate			
The soul and heart in unity
Virtues of honor is my armor

Now I face the horizon
Reaching for the sky
For long I have been the son of dusk	
Now reborn as dawn	

The Blossom of sorrow
Long have you been our herald			 
The Idol of regret and pain			
I cast you down
For I still hear the resonance of my dreams

"Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light"

The Blossom of sorrow
Long have you been our herald			 
The Idol of regret and pain			
I cast you down
For I still hear the resonance
The resonance of my dreams

Resonance
