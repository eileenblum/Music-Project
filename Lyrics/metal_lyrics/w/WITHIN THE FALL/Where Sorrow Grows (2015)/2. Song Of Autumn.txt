In the wind 
I see them scatter
Like the dry leaves 
Such dissipation

Silently we lay on the ground
The modest and the heartfelt 
The last song of autumn

In circles we dance to our last breath
With a gentle kiss you leave me with goodbye

Autumns carnival spreads your wings           
As all life grows cold

Stir the soul for one last time
And we shall cherish the end
as hope takes its leave
And to earth we return 
And our last vestige of life comes to a close
Wither away in your vivid colours of autumn

In the wind I see them scatter
Some cling on, some gives in
To higher grounds some will fly
In darker places some will die

Stir the soul for one last time
And we shall cherish the end
As hope take its leave
And to earth we return
