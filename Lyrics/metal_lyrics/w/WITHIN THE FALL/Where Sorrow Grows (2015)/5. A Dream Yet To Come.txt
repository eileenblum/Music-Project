When the world closes in
Everything seems so fragile
In this chamber of silence
I stay awake in this vacant mind 

Solitary thoughts passes my time
Lost in my reveries
I linger in my secret sorrow
I was born in shadows

A dream yet to come true
This faint picture
Of soaring the skies
The eminent reason for peace

To smile back at the world 
The pillar of light
Solemnly you stand 
Keeping the dark at bay

I stumble to my knees
Reaching for you
As each scar reminds me
The weight of darkness 
A burden of what came to be me

I still have a long way to go
