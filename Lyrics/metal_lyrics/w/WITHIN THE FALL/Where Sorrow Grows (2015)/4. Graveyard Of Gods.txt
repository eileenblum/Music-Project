A lament, gently passes by
Its mournful kiss ignites the pain
The mist playfully caresses me
Like a child lost in paradise

To this place I am forever bound

In my weary heart I remember
I am the grave keeper

The saddest of lullabies
In this place where gods die

The fettering visions of empty skies
The falling ashes touches my shoulders
