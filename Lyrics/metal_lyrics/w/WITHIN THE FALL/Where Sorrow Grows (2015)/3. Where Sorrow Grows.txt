Only here in silence
Where every bridge is burned
A long way from home
Where the sun never shines
In the vale of tears
Where my sorrow grows
In my time of need
The doors are now closed

Confined here on the shore of the lost
Still with heart and soul to care
With everyday I write your name 
And in the sands you still seem to fade

I stand here 
In the shape of despair
Where my sorrow grows
In the wind it all seems to wane
Only to find that I am the prospect of hate

Only here in flames
Where every bridge is burned
Farther and farther away from home
Days became years
Years became centuries
A sun so black
In this valley of death

Confined here on the shore of the lost
Still with heart and soul to care
With everyday I write your name 
And in the sands
You still seem to fade

I stand here 
In the shape of despair
Where my sorrow grows
In my search of solace
In my search for peace
to find I am an ocean apart
