A lament, gently passes by
its mournful kiss ignites the pain
the mist playfully caresses me
like a child lost in paradise

to this place I am forever bound

In my weary heart I remember
I am the gravekeeper

the saddest of lullabies
In this place where gods die

The fettering visions of empty skies
The falling ashes touches my shoulders
