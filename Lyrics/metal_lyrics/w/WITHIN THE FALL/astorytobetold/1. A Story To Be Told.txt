Choked in silence
grief broke my voice
the feeling of true loss
broods inside me
Staring, staring at your picture

your eyes enchanting
your inviting red lips
I know which lies seeps through
Beneath layers of beauty
I have seen darkness in your soul
I came too close to the beast

the beast that resides in your heart

For this is my story
a story of tears, blood and pain
a tale which sings my name
for I am vengeance incarnate
this is a story of all that remains

the torment you put me through
the lies has to stop
you won't breathe no more

I sink the blade into your flesh
I kiss you for the last time

Meet my gaze fallen one and see
See the sadness in my eyes

I never wanted this
I never wanted this
I never wanted this
