Staring into the void
Senseless questions,they roam inside
A dream turns to broken hope
I should leave

Glorious was the time I have shared
Embrace the last remnants of my soul
There is no dawn where I shall walk
There will never be light where I tread

The peril of what should be and never was
Oh mighty abyss, cast your gaze upon me
Let me take the journey upon river styx
Infinite slumber awaits
What have I become?

My old friend
It's raining again
The time has come, for me to leave

One lonesome road to desolation
The rippling waves of the dark
Caress the last moments
The raven has come 
As I draw breath for the last time

Glorious was the time I have shared
Embrace the last remnants of my soul
There is no dawn where I shall walk
There will never be light where I tread
