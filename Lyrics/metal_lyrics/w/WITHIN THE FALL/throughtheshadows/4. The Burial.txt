Old is the house we have built
Slowly it burns down before my eyes
Howling are the wolves
They cry for us tonight
Wither away my friend
Solace shall grace you

I stare into the heavens
Seeking refuge among the stars
This woe is mine to bear
The burden is mine to wear

The coat of snow 
My silent companion 
In the midst of this storm
Let there be solitude in this burial

For one last time
I feel your hands
The tremble of your fingertips
I reach for them with soothing grace
The hollow whisper of your name
To realise you were never there

I hold this candle close at night
I will always remember you
