When the dust has settled                 
The mournful creak below my feet
In this gloom I still remember

When my love still danced on these floors 
Moving with such tender grace
I try to cherish your smile in this misery

The cruelty of forever
I still cling to the hope
But I know the dream is dead

I still long for the nights
With you in my embrace
Yet here I am, looking for ghosts
As my tears resound through these halls

That sincere laughter
Still it rings through the shadows

I still search
In vain I reach out
But for nothing
Unforgiving is the sadness
When the boundary of souls is broken
