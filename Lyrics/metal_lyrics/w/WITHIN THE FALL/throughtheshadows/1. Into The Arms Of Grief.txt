When laughter dies
The silence remains
Watch the fire burn out
The evening star is dead
The emptiness takes control
We came so close

Violent anguish is turning inside
The malice you weep at my shoulder
Oblivious to the snake in your heart
The blood will be on your hands
And do us a world apart

I fall into the arms of grief
Cold voices lures me in
Child of bereavement
Rise to anger
Take place with the fallen

Departure is the only notion we have left

Within the solitude I am reborn
I am the unforgiving season
Loveless, uncaring and cold
Spiteful void of all hatred

I fall into the arms of grief
Cold voices lures me in
Child of bereavement
Rise to anger
Take place with the fallen
