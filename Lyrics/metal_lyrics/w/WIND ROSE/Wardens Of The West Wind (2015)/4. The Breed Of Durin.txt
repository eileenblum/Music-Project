We shall claim what belongs to us
Anger and steel won't hesitate further
We shall slay who holds our gold
Beaten and killed
Those who stand on our pathway

Erebor, Erebor
You will sure await no more
You will sure await no more
And the terror will swear to come
To an awakening

Erebor, Erebor
You will sure await no more
You will sure await no more
A new feeling of hate has born
Mighty and stronger

Shall we free the ancient halls
Axes and shields will nor forgive longer
Shall be shed with the invader's blood
In the name of what we crave

I raise the banner of my kind
Leading us to ascend

Come break the fear
That is storming on us
Carry on on the desire for revenge
And a glare from the north
For long wasted and gone
Like a winter incoming will reign
Forever more in us

Always more in us

We could defeat and could we die
But never retreat
Trust in the reasons of a new beginning

Feel the morn reliving in us all
With the shiver of a new beginning

We could die for what we crave

A weary moon will close the fall
The sun will be her guide into the night
Aligned before a vivid sky
The time has come for us to rise

Over the agony we have found on our way
We taste the splendour
Revealed once again

A new feeling of hate has born
It's the fury of the dwarves
And the terror will swear to come
We could die for what we crave
