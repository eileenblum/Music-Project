Rise, rise
Skulland crossbones

I remember the day
When my journey began
When I knew where it was starting
But not where it ends
Buried in the depths what I left for
A new promise of gold, a desire of fame

I'm still closing my eyes, and I fall
Breathing the freedom for all of my life
Until the end of my time
I'm still watching the horizon unknown

Forevermore we'll sing along the night
When the road seems lost in a starless sky
Forevermore we'll leave our past behind
Bound to the darkness

Full sail ahead
Far miles away
Weighed anchor to another rise

Rise, rise
Skulland crossbones

Live your journey
That soon before you can realize
It turns in a memory
On the course to a dram
Until the old Roger will nor find me

Like the calm sea my house greets me
But the currents of life are keeping me away...
From the quiet bay

I'll face the ripples of the highest waves
And legends, forgotten treasures
I will draw strength from notoriety
The key to redeem of my misfortunes!

I will shine in the history
I'll shine forevermore

In the sea and lost in time
When the edge will seem behind
And I will find my home

Forevermore we'll sing along the night
When the road seems lost in a starless sky
Forevermore we'll leave our past behind
As long as the skulls flags are waving

Straying from the path
We will dare
Will bring one to face the unknown
We'll break the fear
Can lead to struggle alone
But I will not regret
Until I will stand
