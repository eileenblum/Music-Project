Far, far ahead
With craftsmen and warriors we've come
To take what the north still awaits
With no regret take all we have
And leave for the battle
By centuries holding a dream
That will never fade away

Brothers here we are, my lord
Legions of the war, bloody mercenaries
We'll show no fear
Even facing the death

A bitter tear
As a hail for those fallen
From the eyes of the brave

Far we've come
With banners and swords
Fight for the sons of the north

Far we've come
Bow t our folks
And swear

Over the hills we aim for the glory
The time for the triumph has come
For the hope that lies in our dreams
Through the fire we're still marching on

Over the hills we aim for the glory
The time for the triumph has come
For the hope that lies in our dreams
The age of conquest begins

Far away
And the skies give no answer
All we know
Is to beware of the voice in the dark

Deep inside
The honor of fathers
Prepare your heart
For the final encounter

Far we've come
With banners and swords
Fight for the sons of the north

Far we've come
Resound the horns
Fight for the sons of the north

We came from the ice lands
Like the coldest spring
Determined to wrest
Your ensign from the throne

And I'm filled with power
I feel the old might
Now face to me
The one who still stands is your king
