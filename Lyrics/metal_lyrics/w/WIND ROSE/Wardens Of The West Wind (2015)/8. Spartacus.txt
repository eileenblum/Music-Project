Bought as a fighter again
From the ranks of the east
To the dust of the arenas
Ready to triumph or fall
Dying for an ideal means you're living
For something more

Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant

Warriors, warriors
We have been waiting for too long
In a cold prison
(misguided and deceived
We will change our destiny)

Warriors, warriors
Redeem the honor with the swords
Trace the old freedom
(we break the chains that bind us
To the empire)

Slavery will be no more
We have been waiting for too long
In a cold prison
(misguided and deceived
We will change our destiny)

Spartacus, Spartacus
Redeem the honor with the swords
Trace the old freedom
(we break the chains that bind us
To the empire)

For every soldier I fight
I taste the blood that is filling my eyes
'Cause nothing can break me
I shall rise again

This is what I want to be
And what they will tell of me
I'm the slave who defied
The Empire of Rome
And nothing will matter more
When I'll walk to the Elysian fields
I will care no more

Enter a world we don't use to know
Walking alone to the bliss of dawn
Ameinon, Ameinon
A place of end and start
Ameinon, Ameinon
A place of end and start

Memories come back again
The scent of being free
That I sensed on the way back
I'll still remember that time
By now it's far that day
And it could mean forever

What is written on the stars
And what I swear as a man
We'll find the peace in this world
Or maybe we'll meet again
