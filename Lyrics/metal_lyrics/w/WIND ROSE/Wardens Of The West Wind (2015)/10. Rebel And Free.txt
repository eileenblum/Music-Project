Death!
To the tyrant

Born as a free heart
Suffer in chains
Bent to the only will
Of the English crown

Highlands and clans fallen in bane
Red are the clouds, cold is the rain
Long is the path we have to deal
Strong is the chant, we have no fear

In defiance of tyranny

Burn it all!
And tell them our rage
In the years to come
Burn it all!

Whispers of sorrow
(oh ancient voice)
Through the sounds of the war
(oh sounds of war)
Paint up your face
And defend your motherland

We'll remember
The stories and the tales
Of enemies fallen
Drowning in the shadow
Death to the tyrant
That rules into these lands
As rebels began 
As freemen it will end

Revel and free

Let's go!
