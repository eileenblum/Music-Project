Before their arrival
Before nightmares become true
Moving with sorrow
The IV Vanguard still blazes

[Soldier:]
The dark hand is not here
We cannot feel any motion around

[Meadow:]
So keep going forward
We'll believe it once again!

These twenty years spent by your side
All goes beneath while you're alive

To bleed, to cry, to close my eyes
Emotions fed by sense of lie

[Garosh:]
Wait some day then you will understand

[Chorus]
Victorious
Or these dreams become steel
Or the fate will rule everything
To the unknown

Victorious
Let the Vanguards return
On the guardians of destiny
We rely

[Meadow:]
I've been walking for too long
But without the presence of your cold

Days slowly are passing by
Will you now defeat all of my cries?

[Dark voice:]
I'll reach up my aim
I'll burn out your soul

[Meadow:]
No tale and no melody
Could remind your crown

For thousand days, for all respites
You should believe there was no night

Spread your glow, my guiding light
Then drive me down the path he ride

[Garosh:]
When you find me it will be too late

[Chorus]
Victorious
Or these dreams become steel
Or the fate will rule everything
To the unknown

Victorious
Let the Vanguards return
On the guardians of destiny
We rely

[Chorus]
Victorious
Or these dreams become steel
Or the fate will rule everything
To the unknown

Victorious
Let the Vanguards return
On the guardians of destiny
We rely now
