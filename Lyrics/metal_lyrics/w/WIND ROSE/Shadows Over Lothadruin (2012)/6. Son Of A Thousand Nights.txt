Feel the wind slowly molds the sea
From the sky your whisper is sent
To show what is real
Through the dust of years,
On my memories silently lies

Binding a melody
To this place,
Your essence remains

An embrace of the mystery
Just a taste of the fate We don't know..
There's a force in our dreams
that ignores the tears
from the face falling straight to the heart

Redeem all your fantasies
and what you pretend,
would not mean the endâ¦
Your star will shine in the storm

[Chorus:]
Oh oh oh
We will follow the will of tomorrow
From the notes of the bards
To the echo of my rhymes
We will sing 'till the realm's awakening

Another one blurred dream
Son of thousand nights
Spent by looking for another day
Reliving smoothly in a tragedy

But afraid in a maze of life
Hold me tight

Redeem all your fantasies
and what you pretend,
would not mean the endâ¦

To satisfy the thirst of what we need
We'll say loud the final prayer

Before saying goodbye
