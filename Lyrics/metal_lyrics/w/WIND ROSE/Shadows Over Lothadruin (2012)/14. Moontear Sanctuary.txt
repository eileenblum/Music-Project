"Glow" and "Stone" guard the sanctuary of ancient wars,
to this place, while the rest of the world is still flaming...

through this magic fount
I can see how will end
written in the sand
written in the sand

Tears from the moon meet the temple's tranquility

How long will we pay for this agony?

How long... I don't understand.

This time, the vision leads the way
We are ready at your command
We'll make what You will say
My Lord

I remember the quiet of these lands
And how it's come to an end

The threat of today
Will never find a place in my heart
Long as I have strength in my arms

Moontear Sanctuary guard this day
Even if we meet half the way to the sky
Moontear Sanctuary ward this night
Lead our path from the dawn to the twilight

How much blood still we have to pay?
How much, they never cared

Prayers and swords
There's no tomorrow on the journey of warriors

Blessed the light reborn

Prayers and swords
There's no tomorrow on the journey of warriors

Our folk will never bow
To a tyrant without crown, my lord

All these enemies will face my heart
I've sworn to myself
The threat of these days
Will never find a place in my heart

You'll fall at the cost of my life

Moontear Sanctuary guard this day
Even if we meet half the way to the sky
Moontear Sanctuary ward this night
Lead our path from the dawn to the twilight

Moontear Sanctuary guard this day
Even if we meet half the way to the sky
Moontear Sanctuary ward this night
Lead our path from the dawn to the twilight

I believe, i believe
in a world without evil so

I believe, i believe
Til i fall asleep
