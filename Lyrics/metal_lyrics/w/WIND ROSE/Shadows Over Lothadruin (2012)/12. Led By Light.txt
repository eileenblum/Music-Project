Till the day of reckoning
I will not give up
Moon, pour down your silver ring
Sun, lay on my soul

âHope dies suddenlyâ
Your deed betrayed us all
âUseless you prayâ
Iâll shine on his dead reign
âDark blood in our veinsâ
White wisdom in our creed
âPassions become pain
And pain means blindnessâ

Dear virgin led by light
Divine or not I will trust our might
I hope youâre following my lane

Across the crimson sky
I hear the voice whoâs calling my name
Memories burn, weâll not rest

Blessings divine
Moonlight saints upon us
Blind faith we own
Sweeps away fears for all

A red dawn has winged between
Holy myth and truth
Wheeling downhill, marching on
Shone by some healthy glow

âDusts up on your
Pathway
Donât let you go backâ
I think Iâll not go back

Dear virgin led by light
Divine or not I will trust our might
I hope youâre following my lane

Across this crimson sky
I hear the voice whoâs calling my name
Memories burn, weâll not rest
