In the night,
Praying for the wisdom
That will free our lands

Strong pride,
Might and honor are required
To fight for the reign

Our destiny,
Depending on the will of our majesty
There's no time for doubts and demands
I'm breathing an air of revenge

In my mind,
I feel we won't again survive,
But I have found myself

Candlelight,
Embraced by the dark,
Will we be free again?

Dear memories,
I will say to this realm my last farewell
For the anger that hides my regret
Engaging the battle till the end

Strait in the ranks
I must await
A new dawn that will mean our salvation or pain

Facing the enemy in the name of the king
There is nothing that leads better than sorrow and tears

[Chorus:]
We believe in our triumph Majesty,
New alliances are rising

We're defending and serving your name
There's no doubt on our way

As a cloud,
Painted upon the sky
I will follow the wind
That will leave a mark on my faith,
In the final day it will make me disappear

[Chorus:]
We believe in our triumph Majesty,
New alliances are rising

We're defending and serving your name
There's no doubt on our way

[Chorus:]
We believe in our triumph Majesty,
New alliances are rising

We're defending and serving your name
There's no doubt on our way
