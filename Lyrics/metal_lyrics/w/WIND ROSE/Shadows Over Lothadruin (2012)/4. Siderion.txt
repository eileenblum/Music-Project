Under this protective sun
Weâre ready to the tourney
Tournament will choose who leads
The army of the king

Knights and warriors far away
Through days and days of journey
Coming here to show their skill
Their eyes cut through the field

Bright halls
Waiting for you
For your awakening

Down the green
And back to the ridge
Ride your steed to the goal

[King Gohm:]
âOne of you
Here in front of me
Will command to surviveâ

Go
Straight
Fight
Before the light

Go
Straight
Fight
You are a knight

Soar chosen one
Holding your sword
Then drive them all and
Show pride that you own

Don't stop
Believe in my words
Now get on and try!
