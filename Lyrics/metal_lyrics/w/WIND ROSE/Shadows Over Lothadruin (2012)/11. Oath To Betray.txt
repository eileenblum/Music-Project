For every time you raped my mind
Thereâs just a sign that shows me

I face the fear for every tear
That would be dry

But shadows cannot leave me

And I donât want to hear your prayers,
Your memory in lies will drown

Overwhelmed by consciousness
My heart has been divided
âYour aim is now to clear the throne
Thereâs no way out to escapeâ

For how long the tears
Have filled my eyes of bloody anger
What I ever wanted to say
From the ashes, I will raise

For every life youâve sacrificed
A scream of ace consumes me

An oath done only to betray
Now skies and seas are browning

This time it will not last forever
Wisdom reveals the truth you hide

This kingdom awaits a new leader
And here starts my revenge

For how long the tears
Have filled my eyes of bloody anger
What I ever wanted to say
From the ashes, i will raise

For how long the tears
Have filled my eyes of bloody anger
What I ever wanted to say
From the ashes, i will raise
