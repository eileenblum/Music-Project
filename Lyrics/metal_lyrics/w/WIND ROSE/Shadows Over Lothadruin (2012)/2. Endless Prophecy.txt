Standing on the edges
This never ending prophecy
Whispers from the valleys
To the sea

Memories of brightness
But ruins upon the landscape lie
Ivy them hides

Lord
How canât you feel
Something wicked coming from south
To deny these lands

Now winds thrive
Unleashed by ancient cries

[Chorus:]
Strong, forget your emptiness
Through the dark, through the light
Gloryâs waiting

Watch the sunset faraway
Hope is not fading

âRhune empireâ fell asleep,
Someone talks about a mist
Crawling by the waves of the oceans

Slowly marching on the fields
Reached the place where all is fear,
Where all is quite
Lost

Hear my last breath,
All will end
But the shrine will guard my soul

So winds thrive,
And blow within your eyes

[Chorus:]
Strong, forget your emptiness
Through the dark, through the light
Gloryâs waiting

Watch the sunset faraway
Hope is not fading

Strong, forget your emptiness
Through the dark, through the light
Gloryâs waiting

Watch the sunset faraway
Hope is not falling down
