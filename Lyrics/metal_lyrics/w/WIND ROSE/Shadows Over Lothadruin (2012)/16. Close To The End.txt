Close
Close to the end as I believed

Stay here
Here by my side
My dear lover
And please stay awake

Until the night will fall
Don't leave me alone

Stand here just forever
One day I will be there
To your beautyâ¦

So
Now you can sleep and I must leave
Wind sends my breath
If she will need me again
In the creed of heroes

[Meador]:
Everybody hear my call
Everybody marching on
We'll run before the twilight fades

Far,
Far away to back again
It's hard to forget,
We should only reach the end of our grief ...
Nothing will ever take us back, we'll fight as one!

[Soldiers]:
Never trust a vivid dream,
The guile creeps in us all

[Dark voice]:
"So you fell in my trap,
You won't see the sunrise again ... "

[Meador]:
Nothing can lock down my path,
I'm still on my way!

[Chorus:]
Blessed by the heroes,
Until my own faith doesn't fall...
It will stand... It will never fall!

[Chorus:]
Blessed by the heroes,
Until my own faith doesn't fall...
It will stand... It will never fall!

In the name of (the) freedom,
beast, I'll make you pay!

Too long we have been denied
the infinite silences, have been desecrated by the crying of a war...
