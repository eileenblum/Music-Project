When the night, raises the dire banner,
The barren flesh lies on the floor,
And they fall, never to awaken againâ¦

Heroes of our king,
Brother left behind,
People of our ownâ¦

Once they held the fury on a storm,
Now the warriors are lying in a cold, dark abode,
Awake until the last breath of fire,
Now fallen asleep in the arms of their fate,
Hiding the fervor of a war,
Now embraced by death within chambers of stone,
Forgotten by the passage of ages,
Now praised and recalled for their valor in lifeâ¦

Under the stone lie the ashes of time,
Forged in battle and now
Reborn in our praise to the fire,
To the midnight skyâ¦

Lords awakened, relive your last farewell,
Bow down to your fate, and rest in peaceâ¦

We are the fallen star that leaves in the night a trail,
That will shine forever in the midnight sky,
'Cause we are the fallen star that leaves in the night a trail,
That will shine forever in the nightâ¦

Nothing and no one can tell,
When the reaper is calling, you will not be exempt.
Awake until the last breath of fire,
Now fallen asleep in the arms of their fate.
Bound to the destiny of war,
Slowly kissed in the forehead by darkness and cold.
Forgotten by the passage of ages,
Now praised and recalled for their valor in lifeâ¦

We are the fallen stars of the new world's awakening,
We are the shelter in a cold winter night
We are the path to be held to on the journey
Look to the sky, we are shiningâ¦

Under the stone lie the ashes of time,
Forged in battle and now,
Reborn in our praise to the fire,
To the midnight skyâ¦

Lords awakened, relive your last farewell,
Bow down to your fate, and rest in peaceâ¦

We are the fallen star that leaves in the night a trail,
That will shine forever in the midnight sky,
'Cause we are the fallen star that leaves in the night a trail,
That will shine forever in the nightâ¦

We are the fallen stars of the new world's awakening,
We are the shelter in a cold winter night
We are the path to be held to on the journey
Look to the sky, we are shiningâ¦ [2x]

Lords awakened, relive your last farewell,
Bow down to your fate, and rest in peaceâ¦

We are the fallen star that leaves in the night a trail,
That will shine forever in the midnight sky,
'Cause we are the fallen star that leaves in the night a trail,
That will shine forever in the nightâ¦
