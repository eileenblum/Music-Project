Tell me trees that seep the day
Show me the truth where our nature is bound
Their eyes stand still (The animist!)
Baptize me within your will
Make me part of your innate grace
By a mystical embrace

All you have done (All we have done)
All you've been fighting for
All you have known (Ruins of truth)
Is covered by falling dew
All that exists (Dangerous sins)
Drowning in ashes and mist

A rising thrill on your skin
Heralds, the end is near
You may pile gold
Until there's nothing more
You shall fall
I will not follow you
Spilling out tears
For a nearsighted mind
I'm reborn here
Strong as the wolves' call

Free man's native form once you belonged to this earth
The force that I feel in your voice grows when daylight fades

We are howls of
Praise to the night
Engraved in the falling darkness
Of the wolves' night
And if I die you won't be afraid
Even a moon risen in fear will reveal
The bitter cold of the wolves' night

Run through the forest of the past as you know
Make sure no one can see you run alone
Run through the blanket of winter's snow
You will guide your fate, do not ask for more

No return can't you hear until we learn to see
Same old ghost, can't you feel, slowly killing me
No more time now could halt the fall
How could we not hear the wolves' call

We are howls of
Praise to the night
Engraved in the falling darkness
Of the wolves' night
And if I die you won't be afraid
Even a moon risen in fear will reveal
The bitter cold of the wolves' night

As long as I've chances to change the new world
With my life I'll fight for the years to come
As long as I've chances to change the new world
With my life I'll fight for the years to come

If I've chosen not to fight any more
If I deceive the father's will with a storm of lies
Just to fill my eyes
Raising my sword as if all is lost

If I've chosen not to fight any more
If I deceive the father's will with a storm of lies
Just to fill my eyes
Hiding my tears, the ancestors dream will fall

We are howls of
Praise to the night
Engraved in the falling darkness
Of the wolves' night
And if I die you won't be afraid
Even a moon risen in fear will reveal
The bitter cold of the wolves' night
