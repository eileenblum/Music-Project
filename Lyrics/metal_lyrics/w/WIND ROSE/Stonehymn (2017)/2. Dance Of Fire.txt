A flame will arise in time,
And the way is clear to my tear-filled eyesâ¦ [2x]

It begins long agoâ¦
When the "pale" revealed the world,
The mountain reflected the torches,
From the valleys belowâ¦
They brought death and misery,
To the place where we belong,
Now it's time to battle them allâ¦
Let the flame burn high 'til the mornâ¦

For those who fell, the flames are arising,
And burning what lies all around,
Purifying our landâ¦

Can't you hear now the spirits call?
On and on, burning on and on,
We join in the dance of fire,
Let the flame burn high 'til the mornâ¦

To the mountains high reaching over the sky,
We are joining in the dance of fireâ¦
Aiming for the heart, we are watching their all,
Crawling to the soil, drowning in their blood,
For the plundered fields, may they never be healed,
From the curse of their gold,
To the life we have sworn, to be free we can fall,
Across the battlefield, hear the flame that burns to the mornâ¦

As a fallen awakened,
For the forces that make me rise,
Standing over the mountains,
The dead will find me aliveâ¦

For the forces that make me rise...
Make me riseâ¦

With a bloody past behind them,
They are just a sign of a future in war,
My folk will never kneel before them,
We are warriors from long beforeâ¦

For those who fell, the flames are arising,
And burning what lies all around,
Purifying our landâ¦

Can't you hear now the spirits call?
On and on, burning on and on,
We join in the dance of fire,
Let the flame burn high 'til the mornâ¦

To the mountains high reaching over the sky,
We are joining in the dance of fireâ¦
Aiming for the heart, we are watching their all,
Crawling to the soil, drowning in their blood,
For the plundered fields, may they never be healed,
From the curse of their gold,
To the life we have sworn, to be free we can fall,
Across the battlefieldâ¦
