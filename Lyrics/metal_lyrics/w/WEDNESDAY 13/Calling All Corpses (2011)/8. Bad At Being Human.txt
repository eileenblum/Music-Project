[Dedicated to Lux Interior, R.I.P.]

Iâm bad, oh baby Iâm bad,
And it feels good, to be so bad,
Well Iâm bad when Iâm walking down the street,
Iâm punching babies, kicking puppies,
Iâm bad, oh baby Iâm bad

IâM BAD IN THE MORNING,
IâM BAD AT LIFE,
IâM A BAD MOTHERFUCKER,
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT,
IâM BAD AT LOVE,
IâM BAD AT AFFECTION,
IâM A BAD MOTHERFUCKER,
WITH A BAD INFECTION

Iâm bad at being human,
HEâS BAD AT BEING HUMAN,
Iâm bad at being human,
HEâS BAD AT BEING HUMAN,
SO BAD, SO BAD,
SO BAD, BAD, BABY IâM SO BAD

Iâm mean, oh baby Iâm mean,
You wanna know how mean,
Yeah Iâll tell you how mean,
Well I hated my books, beat up the teacher,
Burned down the church,
And pissed on the Preacher,
Iâm mean, oh baby Iâm mean

IâM BAD IN THE MORNING,
IâM BAD AT LIFE,
IâM A BAD MOTHERFUCKER,
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT,
IâM BAD AT LOVE,
IâM BAD AT AFFECTION,
IâM A BAD MOTHERFUCKER,
WITH A BAD INFECTION

Iâm bad at being human,
HEâS BAD AT BEING HUMAN,
Iâm bad at being human,
HEâS BAD AT BEING HUMAN,
SO BAD, SO BAD,
SO BAD, BAD, BABY IâM SO BAD

IâM BAD IN THE MORNING,
IâM BAD AT LIFE,
IâM A BAD MOTHERFUCKER,
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT,
IâM BAD AT LOVE,
IâM BAD AT AFFECTION,
IâM A BAD MOTHERFUCKER,
WITH A BAD INFECTION

Iâm bad at being human,
HEâS BAD AT BEING HUMAN,
Iâm bad at being human,
HEâS BAD AT BEING HUMAN,
SO BAD, SO BAD,
SO BAD, BAD, BABY IâM SO BAD
