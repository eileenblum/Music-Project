Forever painless, forever death,
No longer life, no longer flesh,
Forever gone, no looking back,
Blood fades to black,
(WHOA OHH, WHOA OHH
WHOA OHH, OHH)
The stars will bleed,
And shine a light,
Into the darkness, we march in line,
Forever gone, no looking back,
Blood fades to black,
(WHOA OHH, WHOA OHH
WHOA OHH, OHH)
In this moment,
Accepting fate, so bittersweet,
I love the taste,
Forever gone, no looking back,
Blood fades to black,
