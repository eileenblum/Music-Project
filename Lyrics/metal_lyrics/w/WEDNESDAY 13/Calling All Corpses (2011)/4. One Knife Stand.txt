I canât believe youâre here with me,
Iâm growing accustomed to your screams

AS I DISMEMBER,
ITâS A, NIGHT TO REMEMBER,
WHOA OH OHH, ONE KNIFE STAND,
ONE KNIFE STAND, ONE KNIFE STAND

Your blood is oh so warm and red,
I watch it drip now from your head

AS I DISMEMBER,
ITâS A, NIGHT TO REMEMBER,
WHOA OH OHH, ONE KNIFE STAND,
ONE KNIFE STAND, ONE KNIFE STAND

AS I DISMEMBER,
ITâS A, NIGHT TO REMEMBER,
WHOA OH OHH, ONE KNIFE STAND,
ONE KNIFE STAND, ONE KNIFE STAND
WHOA OH OHH, ONE KNIFE STAND,
ONE KNIFE STAND, ONE KNIFE STAND
