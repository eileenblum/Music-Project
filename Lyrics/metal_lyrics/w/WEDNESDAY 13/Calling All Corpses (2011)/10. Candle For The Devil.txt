Some people, they were born with it,
Got the flame burning in their eyes,
Shoot first and ask questions later,
Has been the story of my life,
Two middle fingers and a mouth from the south,
And the targetâs in my sight,
I hold a candle for the devil baby,
âCause it keeps me warm at night

HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He leads me home at night,
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He always treats me right,
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He leads me home at night,
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He always treats me right

Some people say it makes no sense,
Itâs like Iâm itching for an early grave,
Just like my mama always told me,
Iâm the only hell she ever raised,
Full throttle down this highway to hell,
Buckle up now, itâs a bumpy ride
6-6-6 grab your crucifix,
Itâs gonna be a hell of a night

HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He leads me home at night,
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He always treats me right,
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He leads me home at night,
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He always treats me right

HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He leads me home at night,
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He always treats me right.
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He leads me home at night,
HOLD A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL,
He always treats me right
