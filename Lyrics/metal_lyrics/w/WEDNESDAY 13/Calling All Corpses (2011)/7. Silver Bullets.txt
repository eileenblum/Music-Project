Iâm starting to feel strange,
SOMETHINGâS COMING OVER ME,
I was bitten the other night,
FROM WHAT I COULD NOT SEE

ITâS GETTING CLOSER, I START TO SWEAT,
PLEASE DONâT FORGET, THE SILVER BULLETS,
IâM TURNING INTO SOMETHING,
BABY DONâT BE SCARED,
I PROMISE NOT TO HURT YOU,
BUT BABY PLEASE COME PREPARED, WITH SILVER BULLETS

I know darling, itâs such an awful sight,
UPON THIS VIOLENT NIGHT,
Beware the moon, for the wolfs bane blooms,
BUT I PROMISE I WONâT HURT YOU

ITâS GETTING CLOSER, I START TO SWEAT,
PLEASE DONâT FORGET, THE SILVER BULLETS,
IâM TURNING INTO SOMETHING,
BABY DONâT BE SCARED,
I PROMISE NOT TO HURT YOU,
BUT BABY PLEASE COME PREPARED, WITH SILVER BULLETS

ITâS GETTING CLOSER, I START TO SWEAT,
PLEASE DONâT FORGET, THE SILVER BULLETS,
IâM TURNING INTO SOMETHING,
BABY DONâT BE SCARED,
I PROMISE NOT TO HURT YOU,
BUT BABY PLEASE COME PREPARED, WITH SILVER BULLETS

WITH SILVER BULLETS,
WITH SILVER BULLETS
