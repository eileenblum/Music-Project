Sheâs crawling from the casket, I really wanna ask her,
If sheâll be my one and only, Iâm tired of being lonely,
I know this sounds sick, I gotta bite you on the neck,
And make you mine,
You couldnât get me higher, my little vampire,
Youâre beautiful and spooky,
And you donât mind Iâm kooky,
I wanna drive a stake right into your heart,
And make you mineâ¦ All mine

I FELL IN LOVE WITH,
THE GHOUL OF MY DREAMS,
AND SHEâS THE ONLY ONE,
TO MAKE ME SCREAM

I FELL IN LOVE WITH,
THE GHOUL OF MY DREAMS,
AND SHEâS THE ONLY ONE,
TO MAKE ME SCREAM

Sheâll be little my spider,
Iâll sit right down beside her,
She doesnât think itâs scary, that Iâm usually buried,
I know this sounds sick, I gotta bite you on the neck,
And make you mine,
And when youâre next to me, I donât need no Halloween,
âCause you can make me scream,
Like no other human being,
Now I wanna drive a stake right through your heart,
And make you mineâ¦ All mine

I FELL IN LOVE WITH,
THE GHOUL OF MY DREAMS,
AND SHEâS THE ONLY ONE,
TO MAKE ME SCREAM

I FELL IN LOVE WITH,
THE GHOUL OF MY DREAMS,
AND SHEâS THE ONLY ONE,
TO MAKE ME SCREAM

I FELL IN LOVE WITH,
THE GHOUL OF MY DREAMS,
AND SHEâS THE ONLY ONE,
TO MAKE ME SCREAM

I FELL IN LOVE WITH,
THE GHOUL OF MY DREAMS,
AND SHEâS THE ONLY ONE,
TO MAKE ME SCREAM
