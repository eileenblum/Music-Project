Burn the flames until Iâm ash and gray,
And store my remains beside of you some day,
Hand in hand and now weâre can to can,
Ashes to ashes with a fool proof funeral plan

I guess Iâll never learn, I was born to crash and burn oh baby,
Yeah Iâm hot around the collar and thereâs just no need to bother,
Just fry me like KFC

I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED

I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED

All that remains on this cold black tray,
Throw whatâs left of me, inside this tin grave,
Hand in hand and now weâre can to can,
Ashes to ashes with a fool proof funeral plan

I guess Iâll never learn, I was born to crash and burn oh baby,
Yeah Iâm hot around the collar and thereâs just no need to bother,
Just fry me like KFC

I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED

I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED

I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED

I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
I WANNA BE CREMATED
