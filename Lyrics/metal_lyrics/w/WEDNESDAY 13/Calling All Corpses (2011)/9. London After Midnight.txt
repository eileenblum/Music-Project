My make-upâs smeared, and Iâm looking for a fight,
And IâM OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT

I wanna get loaded,
I wanna break some stuff,
Iâm going down to the pub and see who thinks theyâre tough,
Iâm looking for action, Iâm looking for trouble,
Iâm drinking triples now, âcause Iâm seeing double

EVERY DRINK I CARE LESS OF WHAT YOU THINK, OF ME,
AND IâLL BE DAMNED IF IâLL GO DOWN WITHOUT THE WORLD KNOWING MY NAME

My make-upâs smeared, and Iâm looking for a fight,
And IâM OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT,
My make-upâs smeared, and Iâm looking for a fight,
And IâM OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT

Iâm an N.C. doll, out looking for a kiss,
Then ten drinks later I can barely stand Iâm so pissed,
As the sun comes up,
And I crawl to my bunk,
My head is spinning because Iâm so fucked up

EVERY DRINK I CARE LESS OF WHAT YOU THINK, OF ME,
AND IâLL BE DAMNED IF IâLL GO DOWN WITHOUT THE WORLD KNOWING MY NAME

My make-upâs smeared, and Iâm looking for a fight,
And IâM OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT,
My make-upâs smeared, and Iâm looking for a fight,
And IâM OUT IN LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT
