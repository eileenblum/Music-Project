Where do you come from,
THE DUST,
Where will you go to,
THE GRAVE,
Darkness soon for everyone cause,
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES

Stirring up the brewing pot,
I like words that rhyme with death,
And things that rot, Iâve got a bone to pick,
But I donât know where to start baby,
THEREâS SOMETHING WICKED, THEREâS SOMETHING WICKED,
And I like things when they go wrong,
And I prefer Godzilla to King Kong,
And what you call hell, I call home baby,
THEREâS SOMETHING WICKED, THEREâS SOMETHING WICKED

Where do you come from,
THE DUST,
Where will you go to,
THE GRAVE,
Darkness soon for everyone cause,
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES

Where do you come from,
THE DUST,
Where will you go to,
THE GRAVE,
Darkness soon for everyone cause,
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES

Donât worry I wonât hold my breath,
Because the only certain thing for me is death,
âCause Iâve always dressed to depress baby,
THEREâS SOMETHING WICKED, THEREâS SOMETHING WICKED,
Alice Cooper and G.I. Joe,
Taught me everything I need to know,
And when I hear Hey Ho,
I scream LETâS GO BABY,
THEREâS SOMETHING WICKED, THEREâS SOMETHING WICKED,

Where do you come from,
THE DUST,
Where will you go to,
THE GRAVE,
Darkness soon for everyone cause,
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES

Where do you come from,
THE DUST,
Where will you go to,
THE GRAVE,
Darkness soon for everyone cause,
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES

Where do you come from,
THE DUST,
Where will you go to,
THE GRAVE,
Darkness soon for everyone cause,
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES

Where do you come from,
THE DUST,
Where will you go to,
THE GRAVE,
Darkness soon for everyone cause,
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES

Where do you come from,
THE DUST,
Where will you go to,
THE GRAVE,
Darkness soon for everyone cause,
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES
