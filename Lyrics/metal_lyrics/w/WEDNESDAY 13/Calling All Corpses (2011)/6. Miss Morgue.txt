Saw you on the slab late Saturday night,
Took one look at you couldnât believe my eyes,
There ainât no doubt about it,
Iâm crazy about you,
Long black hair, and pale white skin,
Even though youâre D.O.A. youâre a perfect 10,
There ainât no doubt about it, Iâm crazy about you

COLD AND BLUE, IâLL ROT WITH YOU,
MISS MORGUE I ADORE YOU,
COLD AND BLUE, IâLL ROT WITH YOU,
MISS MORGUE I ADORE YOU,
OHHHHH, MISS MORGUE

You, donât really have much to say,
As a matter of fact, you donât say a thing,
There ainât no doubt about it, Iâm crazy about you
Itâs not so bad once you get past the smell,
But Iâve never been one to kiss and tell,
There ainât no doubt about it, Iâm crazy about you
COLD AND BLUE, IâLL ROT WITH YOU,
MISS MORGUE I ADORE YOU,
COLD AND BLUE, IâLL ROT WITH YOU,
MISS MORGUE I ADORE YOU

COLD AND BLUE, IâLL ROT WITH YOU
MISS MORGUE I ADORE YOU,
COLD AND BLUE, IâLL ROT WITH YOU
MISS MORGUE I ADORE YOU,
OHHHHH, MISS MORGUE,
OHHHHH, MISS MORGUE,
OHHHHH, MISS MORGUE
