[Dedicated to Zoie Starr]

Do you think weâll be alright,
ITâS HARD TO SAY,
Will we get out of here alive,
NO NOT TODAY,
Weâre all running for our lives,
WILL WE BE SAVED,
Thereâs just one ticket outâ¦ up, up and away

So many things I want to say to you,
Iâm sorry for the things that I know I put you through,
No matter what you always put a smile upon my face,
Just know that I love you more than anything just in caseâ¦

WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH,
WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH,
WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH
WE ALL DIE!!!

I canât believe my eyes,
WHATâS HAPPENING,
Will I even get to say goodbye,
ITâS HARD TO SAY,
Weâre all running for our lives,
WILL WE BE SAVED,
Thereâs just one ticket outâ¦ up, up and away

So many things I want to say to you,
Iâm sorry for the things that I know I put your through,
No matter what you always put a smile upon my face,
Just know that I love you more than anything just in caseâ¦

WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH,
WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH,
WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH
WE ALL DIE!!!

So many things I want to say to you,
Iâm sorry for the things that I know I put your through,
No matter what you always put a smile upon my face,
Just know that I love you more than anything just in caseâ¦

WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH,
WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH,
WE ALL DIE, WHOA OH
WE ALL DIE!!!
