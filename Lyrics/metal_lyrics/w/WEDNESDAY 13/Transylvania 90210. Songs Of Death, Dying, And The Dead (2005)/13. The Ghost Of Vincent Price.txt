I knew that life wouldn't be the same after that fateful day
Dreams were crushed and who's to blame for all my hurt and pain
Can someone tell me why, why did all of my heroes die?
And now there's nothing left but this black heart of mine just cheating death
Just cheating death

I know I'll always get my thrill in that house on Haunted Hill
I know that life can be a gas locked inside that house of wax

Some people prefer the finer things in life
I'm alright just hanging out with the ghost of Vincent Price
Some people prefer the finer things in life
I'm alright just hanging out with the ghost, with the ghost of Vincent Price

It's so strange how my life suddenly went black and white
Like a movie on the screen with Vincent Price co-starring me
It's such a late, late, late show
And when it ends, nobody knows
I never question my sanity when the Lord of the Dead is watching over me
Watching over me

I know I'll always get my thrill in that house on Haunted Hill
I know that life can be a gas locked inside that house of wax

Some people prefer the finer things in life
I'm alright just hanging out with the ghost of Vincent Price
Some people prefer the finer things in life
I'm alright just hanging out with the ghost, with the ghost of Vincent Price

I know I'll always get my thrill in that house on Haunted Hill
I know that life can be a gas locked inside that house of wax

Some people prefer the finer things in life
I'm alright just hanging out with the ghost of Vincent Price
Some people prefer the finer things in life
I'm alright just hanging out with the ghost, with the ghost of Vincent Price
With the ghost of Vincent Price
With the ghost of Vincent Price
With the ghost of Vincent Price
With the ghost of Vincent Price
