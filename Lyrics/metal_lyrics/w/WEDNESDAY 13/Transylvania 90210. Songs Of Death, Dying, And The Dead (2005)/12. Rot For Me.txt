You and me were once a fairy tale in love
No happily ever after, just a horrorble disaster

You tried to drag me down, so I put you in the ground
You brought it on yourself and now this coffin fits you well

I tell my love goodbye
I watched the dirt fall by your side
You I could never trust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Rot, rot for me, my darling, rot for me
So rot, rot for me, my darling, rot for me

I carved it in your chest so you'd never forget
And I loved you to death, and I'll take your final breath

I hope you understand that our story had to end
Now I lay you down to sleep
And pray the worms your soul to keep

I tell my love goodbye
I watched the dirt fall by your side
You I could never trust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Rot, rot for me, my darling, rot for me
So rot, rot for me, my darling, rot for me

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

I tell my love goodbye
I watched the dirt fall by your side
You I could never trust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Rot, rot for me, my darling, rot for me
So rot, rot for me, my darling, rot for me
