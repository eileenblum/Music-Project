I've made a fist but I cannot knock upon that door
'Cause once I walk through it I won't be coming back no more
It's strange how everything can change oh, so very fast
Somewhere someone out there will always have the last laugh

Just say a prayer for me, in case I forget
And when you speak of me, don't say it in regret
Life's a grave... dig it

I'll put the noose around my neck
Will you get to me just in time?
I've got no reason left to live
But I've got a hundred to die
I'll put my hands together now
Hold them up to the sky
But there's no one to save me, yeah
'Cause I know... God is a lie
God is a lie

Everyday I look at myself and I wonder why
I have written the soundtrack to the end of my life
And as I climb this ladder now it is certain I will fall
God, he must be deaf because he never heard me call

Just say a prayer for me, in case I forget
And when you speak of me, don't say it in regret
Life's a grave... dig it

I'll put the noose around my neck
Will you get to me just in time?
I've got no reason left to live
But I've got a hundred to die
I'll put my hands together now
Hold them up to the sky
But there's no one to save me, yeah
'Cause I know... God is a lie
God is a lie

Somebody save me!

Just say a prayer for me, in case I forget
And when you speak of me, don't say it in regret
Life's a grave... dig it

I'll put the noose around my neck
Will you get to me just in time?
I've got no reason left to live
But I've got a hundred to die
I'll put my hands together now
Hold them up to the sky
But there's no one to save me, yeah
'Cause I know... God is a lie
God is a lie
