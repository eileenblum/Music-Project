We thought this would last forever
But were all, all so wrong

You use to be so dear to me
Now you're the enemy
Un-loveable, un-trustable
That's all you'll ever be, to me

This is the end, goodbye and good riddance
Parting ways with this wretched misery

We shared many things together
Now all those things have come and gone

You use to be a friend to me
Now you're the enemy
Despicable, un-trustable
That's all you'll ever be, to me

This is the end, goodbye and good riddance
Parting ways with this wretched misery
This is the end, goodbye and good riddance
Parting ways with this wretched misery

Regret is all that, you fucking left me with

Regret is all that
Regret is all that, you fucking left me with

This is the end, goodbye and good riddance
Parting ways with this wretched misery
This is the end, goodbye and good riddance
Parting ways with this wretched misery

Regret is all that
Regret is all that
You fucking left me with
Good riddance
