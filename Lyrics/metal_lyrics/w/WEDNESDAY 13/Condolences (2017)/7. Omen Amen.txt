Beaten by the Bible, brainwashed to believe
That someone up above is looking down on me
Say your prayers nightly, don't use his name in vain
And everything that is bad, the devil is to blame

God is great, God is good, let's dis-obey himâ¦ Amen!

No more hallelujahs
It's immortal sin
The devil's got a new recruit
Omen amen
No more hallelujahs
It's immortal sin
The devil's got a new recruit
Omen amen

Summoned by the devil, his words I must command
Now I spread this blasphemy all across the land
Faith in the father, put one between his eyes
Away with the manger, his words I despise

God is great, God is good, let's dis-obey himâ¦ Amen!

No more hallelujahs
It's immortal sin
The devil's got a new recruit
Omen amen
No more hallelujahs
It's immortal sin
The devil's got a new recruit
Omen amen

My life is sin after sin
Do it again and again
Your faith is burning my skin
Now open up and let the devil in

No more hallelujahs
It's immortal sin
The devil's got a new recruit
Omen amen
No more hallelujahs
It's immortal sin
The devil's got a new recruit
Omen amen
No more hallelujahs
It's immortal sin
The devil's got a new recruit
Omen amen
No more hallelujahs
It's immortal sin
The devil's got a new recruit
Omen amen
