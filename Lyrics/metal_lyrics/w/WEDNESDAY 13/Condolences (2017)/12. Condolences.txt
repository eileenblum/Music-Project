The show is over, I take my final bow
As my life's light is fading
Friends and family gather 'round and grieve
I can see it now so clearly

And as the darkness calls to me
Death is your destiny

Sorry for your loss
Sorry for your loss
Condolences!
Condolences!
Sorry for your loss
Sorry for your loss
Condolences!
Condolences!

The shadow people, they reach out to me
Telling me that it's okay
I'm holding on, I don't know what's going on
They've come to take me away

And as the darkness calls to me
Death is your destiny

Sorry for your loss
Sorry for your loss
Condolences!
Condolences!
Sorry for your loss
Sorry for your loss
Condolences!
Condolences!

You wave goodbye, the curtain's closing on my life
Into the darkness we begin this final ride

Where am I going, what is before me now
A new realm has awakened
And as the darkness calls to me
Death is your destiny

Sorry for your loss
Sorry for your loss
Condolences!
Condolences!
Sorry for your loss
Sorry for your loss
Condolences!
Condolences!

Condolences...
Condolences...
Condolences...
Condolences...
