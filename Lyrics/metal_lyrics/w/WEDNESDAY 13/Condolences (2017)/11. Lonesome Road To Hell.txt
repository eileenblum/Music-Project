My eyes, dark, blank and vacant
Repulsed by all that's sacred
These thoughts they come to mind

Now I, never trust the living
Corrupt and deceiving
Destroy all mankind

God have mercy on me
For now I must deceive

I'm not turning back
I already hear the bells
And I'll leave a trail of blood
On this lonesome road to hell
I'm not turning back
I already hear the bells
And I'll leave a trail of blood
On this lonesome road to hell

Insane, vile, and unhuman
The hatred I'm consuming
Dwells inside my brain

Now I, punish all the living
Their ways so unforgiving
Inflicting so much pain

God have mercy on me
For now I must deceive

I'm not turning back
I already hear the bells
And I'll leave a trail of blood
On this lonesome road to hell
I'm not turning back
I already hear the bells
And I'll leave a trail of blood
On this lonesome road to hell

God have mercy on me
For now I must deceive

I'm not turning back
I already hear the bells
And I'll leave a trail of blood
On this lonesome road to hell
I'm not turning back
I already hear the bells
And I'll leave a trail of blood
On this lonesome road to hell

Now I, I'm not turning back now
I'm on my way
Lonesome road to hell

Now I, I'm not turning back now
I can see the flames...
