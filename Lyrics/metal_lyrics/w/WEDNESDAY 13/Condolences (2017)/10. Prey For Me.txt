My brain is rancid, ingesting negativity
I am a vessel, spewing bile and brutality

The body count is rising up
There's too much blood, but it's not enough
And you're the one, one that I've been thinking of
It's a massacre now giddy up

Now can't you see, you're all just prey for me
Step up to the butcher's block
And let's start this crime scene

Prey for me
Now witness all of the horror
Prey for me
You're all just cattle to slaughter

I am infected, diseased and plagued with tragedy
You'll be my victim, of my darkest depravity

I'm hell bound and so violent
You're almost dead, but not just yet
Now I take this razor to your neck
From ear to ear now, I'll watch you drip

Now can't you see, you're all just prey for me
Step up to the butcher's block
And let's start this crime scene

Prey for me
Now witness all of the horror
Prey for me
You're all just cattle to slaughter

No! No!

Prey for me
Now witness all of the horror
Prey for me
You're all just cattle to slaughter
Prey for me
Now witness all of the horror
Prey for me
You're all just cattle to slaughter

No! No! No!

Prey! Prey! Prey! Prey!
