So said the spider to the fly
Welcome to my web
I'll slowly watch you die

Now you're hoping and praying
Everything will be okay
Don't hold your breath my love
No not today

And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight

It's just so sad that you're so dumb
Now I devour you in this nightmare that I've spun

Now you're begging
And you're screaming for me to end the pain
Don't hold your breath my love
No not today

And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight
And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight

It's too bad, things had to end this way
But I promise, to end it oh so violently
Now I, sink my fangs so deep down inside you
Your blood, I need, now won't you give it all to me

And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight
And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick and I need all yours tonight

And there's no way
And there's no way you're getting out alive
I'm so blood sick
I'm so blood sick
And I need, all, yours, tonight
