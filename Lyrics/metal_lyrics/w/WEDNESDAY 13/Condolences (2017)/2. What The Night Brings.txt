Somewhere out there, deep in the dark of the night
Creatures crave, blood to feed their appetite
Long, sharp knives, to cut you right down to size
Now close your eyes, so the night can come alive

In the night there are bad things, you cannot understand
An abomination, the devil commands

In dark shadows, lurk strange things
No one knows what the night brings
Bloodletting, lycanthropy
No one knows, what the night brings

Slow creeping death
From the depths of the damned and possessed
Call to you, to carve upon your flesh
Punishment, torturing and violence
Bleed you dry, in this nocturnal sacrament

In the night there are bad things, you cannot understand
An abomination, the devil commands

In dark shadows, lurk strange things
No one knows what the night brings
Bloodletting, lycanthropy
No one knows, what the night brings

I am the one that sits at the foot of your bed
When you think you're alone at night
To make sure you're, tucked in oh so tight
Now don't be scared, I only want a bite

In dark shadows, lurk strange things
No one knows what the night brings
Bloodletting, lycanthropy
No one knows, what the night brings

In dark shadows, lurk strange things
No one knows what the night brings
Bloodletting, lycanthropy
No one knows, what the night brings

What the night brings
What the night brings
What the night brings
