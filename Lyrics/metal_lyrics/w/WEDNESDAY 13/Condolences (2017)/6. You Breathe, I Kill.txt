I know tonight you are alone
Because I'm right outside your home
And soon I'll be inside with you
And I know just what to do

Cause I'm a bad man
I end lives with these hands
Your blood it spills
You breathe, I kill

I, kill everything that walks the path in front of me
You are the fucking enemy
You breathe, I kill

Now don't be scared it's just a knife
And now it's come to take your life
And now I've got you gagged and bound
In your own blood I'll watch you drown

Cause I'm a bad man
I end lives with these hands
Your blood it spills
You breathe, I kill

I, kill everything that walks the path in front of me
You are the fucking enemy
You breathe, I kill

Cause I'm a bad man
I end lives with these hands
Your blood it spills
You breathe, I kill

I, kill everything that walks the path in front of me
You are the fucking enemy
You breathe, I kill
I, kill everything that walks the path in front of me
You are the fucking enemy
You breathe, I kill

You breathe, I kill, you breathe, I kill
You breathe, I kill, you breathe, I kill
