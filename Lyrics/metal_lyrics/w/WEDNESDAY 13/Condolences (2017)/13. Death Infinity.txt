God's above me, and God's below
Call out to me, welcome me home
Into the twilight, all alone
My spirit's drifting, to the unknown
And as I take, these final steps
I know life, begins at death
At death..
At death..
At death..

Falling from mortality
Darkness shines the light for me
I'm death infinity
Falling from mortality
Darkness shines the light for me
I'm death infinity

After death, and after life
There's so much darkness, for me to fight
And where it leads me, I don't know
As I fade from flesh and bone

Falling from mortality
Darkness shines the light for me
I'm death infinity
Falling from mortality
Darkness shines the light for me
I'm death infinity

Falling from mortality
Darkness shines the light for me
I'm death infinity
Falling from mortality
Darkness shines the light for me
I'm death infinity

And I'm falling
I'm so far beyond the grave
And I can see the way..
And I'm falling
I'm so far beyond the grave
And I can see the way..
