I've got bad, bad thoughts a brewing
Deep down inside of me
I just wanna take a razor blade
And mutilate your body

And blood will spray, and birds will sing,
It's so deranged, but I know that I like itâ¦
I fucking like it

Don't you understand
I'm just the boogie man
And I've come to cut you down
All that I've been dreaming
Just to hear you screaming
I'll be around when the sun goes down

I just want to hurt you
Beat you black and blue
I just want to be so cruel to you

And you had this coming to ya
Every dog has its day
And that day is finally here to put you
Out of your misery

And blood will spray, and birds will sing,
It's so deranged, but I know that I like itâ¦
I fucking like it

Don't you understand
I'm just the boogie man
And I've come to cut you down
All that I've been dreaming
Just to hear you screaming
I'll be around when the sun goes down

I just want to hurt you
Beat you black and blue
I just want to be so cruel to you
I just want to hurt you
Beat you black and blue
I just want to be so cruel to you

Cruel to you!
Cruel to you!
Cruel to you!
Cruel to you!

I just want to hurt you
Beat you black and blue
I just want to be so cruel to you
I just want to hurt you
Beat you black and blue
I just want to be so cruel to you

I just wanna
I just wanna
Beat you black, and blue
I just want to be so cruel to you

Cruel to you!
Cruel to you!
Cruel to you!
Cruel to you!
