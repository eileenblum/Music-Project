Full moon tonight alright
I've got some sick thoughts on my mind
On to your grave site
I'm digging in to see what I can find

Stiff and rotten, dressed in blue
I've got a confession to make
I wanna get inside of you

You're all that I need, so let me proceed

It's Friday night at the cemetery, and it's you that I lust
Open up your casket baby, so hideous, cadaverous

Entombed I'm craving you, your corpse is oh so sweet
No grave's too deep for me, I'm going 6, 6, 6 feet deep

In your coffin, next to you
First date and I just can't wait to
Get inside of you

You're all that I need, so let me proceed

It's Friday night at the cemetery, and it's you that I lust
Open up your casket baby, so hideous, cadaverous
If you don't mind, I've got a corpse to grind
In the back of my hearse
Open up your casket baby, so hideous, cadaverous

It's Friday night at the cemetery, and it's you that I lust
Open up your casket baby, so hideous, cadaverous
If you don't mind, I've got a corpse to grind
In the back of my hearse
Open up your casket baby, so hideous, cadaverous
