Is this life?
Or is this misery?
Cause IA can't tell the difference
It's all the same to me

Now we hope and pray
And we ask god why?
How do you even try when we all
Know we're gonna die

We don't need to tomorrow, it's all over soon
It's killing everything including me and you

And life will kill us all
On hand on knees now we all crawl
We can't live forever
But we can try until we fall
And life, willâ¦

On your hands and knees, scream baby scream
Cause we're never getting out alive and I know
That's a guarantee
