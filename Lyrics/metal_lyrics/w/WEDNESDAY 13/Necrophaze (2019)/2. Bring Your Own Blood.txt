There's a party and I want you to come
But bring your own blood
Bring your own blood
Monster sluts, guns and grotesque stuff
But bring your own blood
Bring your own blood

The moonlight's shining on the moonshine
And if your gonna call the doctorâ¦call Frankenstein
I think I wanna put a spell on you
Now stirring up the madness in my witches brew

So don't you leave your house alone
Cause you may never ever get back home
I love to watch your skin crawl
Cause you've got blood and now I want it all
The moon will rise and darkness falls
Bring your own blood, bring your own blood
I know we'll all be dead by dawn
Cause you've got blood and now I want it all

This party's like a hit and run
But bring your own blood, bring your own blood
And we'll get loaded like a hand gun
But bring your own blood, bring your own blood

Ashes to ashes
Dust to disgust
Cause I want blood
And you've got more than enough
