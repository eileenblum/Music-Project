Entering the necrophaze
We take the other form
Exhuming bodies from the grave
To feast upon the worms
Decomposition's my addiction
This I must confess
Coffins full of rotting flesh
Grotesque by request
Graves and tombs
Death in full bloom
Consuming the decayed
Enter the mouth of madness
Enterâ¦the necrophaze

Enter the necrophaze
There's no mercy for you?
Rest in piece, but not for long
This nightmare's coming true

I am the night, the terror, the fright
I'm the necro-shadow
Reanimate the dead, watch them wake
In darkness all is hallowed

Darkness alive, no one survives
Necrophaze-necrophaze
Death and dismay, kill for joy, kill for days
Necrophaze-necrophaze
Your soul be thine, see the dead, watch them rise
Necrophaze-necrophaze
Evil descends, as the night closes in
Necrophaze-necrophaze

Decomposition'sâ¦
My addiction, as I embrace your death
I'm morgue than meets the eye
So grotesque now I request
