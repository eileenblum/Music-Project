When the lights go out at night is when I come around
My name is violence and I wear the crown
I am not sick now, I am insane
Left a trail of bodies
Soon you'll know my name

Just like a monster thriller (Zodiac Killer)

I left some of them bleeding
I left some of them screaming
Bringer of death this isâ¦
The zodiac speaking
I have no sympathy
Your pain is my whole reason
Bringer of death this isâ¦
The Zodiac speaking

I'm hunting humans when the darkness falls
Man is the most dangerous animal of all
I have always been here, and I will remain
The executionerâ¦bringer of pain
