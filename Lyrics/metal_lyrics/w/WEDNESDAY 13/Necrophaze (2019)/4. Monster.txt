Swing from the gallows
It's been my destiny
And everywhere that I roam
I spread this blasphemy
Now I'm a bad, bad, man
My name you should not speak
I prey on the innocent
The powerless and weak

You, made me a monster
And all I wanna do is dismember you
Made me a monster
And now the monster's coming after you
Made this creation
Causing all this devastation
You, made me a monster
And now the monster, he's out on the loose

On the loose
I am a madman on the streets
Now don't ever forget'
That you created me
Now look, into my eyes
And take your final breath
My hands, around your throat
Just one more last caress
