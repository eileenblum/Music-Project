Your sin and your sorrows
No one cares and no ones listening
And there's no tomorrow
Just pain and suffering for eternity

And I hope you suffer
And you will never, ever rest in peace
Just lie, in your casket
Soon the worms they slowly start to feast

And now you're lying there decaying
Forever, unforgiven
I loved it when youâ¦stopped living

Rot away in your grave, six feet below
I swear to curse your name as you decompose

And there's no forgiveness
As you are lying right where you should be
Your rotting cadaver
Can never, ever rot enough for me

Rot away in your grave, six feet below
I swear to curse your name as you decompose
I want you to know
That I curse you as you decompose
As you decompose
