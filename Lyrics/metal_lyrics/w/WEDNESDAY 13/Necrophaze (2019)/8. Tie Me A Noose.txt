Tying another knot in the noose for me, Death comes soon
And as I hang, I hang in spite of you
You were the best to bring the worst right out of me
And casualties have always been my specialty

Save all your prayers for the priest now, he comes soon
And when I dies, I'll die for me, not, not you
My world is crashing down, the caskets on the way
Just dig the hole and fucking put me in my place
And from this noose you watch my life taken away
The only home I've ever known is the grave

Tie me a noose
So I've got something to hold onto
Just scream my name in vain nowâ¦
As I hang, as I hang
