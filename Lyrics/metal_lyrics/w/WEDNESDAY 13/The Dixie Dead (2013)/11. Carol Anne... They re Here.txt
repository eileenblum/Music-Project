I hear your voice from the TV in the living room,
You sound scared and we all wanna help you
Carol Anne, now you gotta fight
So go and walk into the light

All the things that go bump in the night
Found a way back here inside
With two words you make it clear,
Carol Anne... they're here.

[Chorus:]
Whoa carol Anne [x2]
And when you said they're here,
We should of ran away in fear

And now things are getting strange
We're seeing things we cant explain
Like that tree that came alive
And tried to take your brothers life

And that clown up in your bedroom
I think he really wants to hurt you
Into the TV, he disappeared
Carol Anne.... they're here

[Chorus]

[Guitar solo]

They're here

[Chorus]
