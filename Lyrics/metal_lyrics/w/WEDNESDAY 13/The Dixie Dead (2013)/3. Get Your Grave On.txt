Zombie, cadaver, what does it matter?
Iâm a spook, a creep, the recently deceased
And Iâm a creature, a curse, the body in the hearse
And Iâm screaming bloody murder from the very first verse

And Iâm your death, your dealer, your faithful deceiver
I got maggots on the brain but I canât complain
I got a spot in the cemetery,
Baby, thatâs calling your name

Get your grave, get your grave on, baby
Start rotting away
Iâm dying just to hear you say
Lifeâs a grave, now dig it, baby
[x2]

Monster, a fiend, the body at the scene
Take your wrist, a razor, do yourself a favor
Iâm your ghoul, your host, the ghost that wants the most
Now lick your lips, bitch, hereâs another fucking dose

And I love blood, guts and all that violent stuff
I like guns, knives, taking peopleâs lives
Got all the creatures in the casket screaming
Baby, wonât you come inside

Get your grave, get your grave on, baby
Start rotting away
Iâm dying just to hear you say
Lifeâs a grave, now dig it, baby
[x2]

Baby
Baby

Get your grave, get your grave on, baby
Start rotting away
Iâm dying just to hear you say
Lifeâs a grave, now dig it, baby
[x2]
