I'm addicted to your agony,
all your pain and suffering,
No room for peace and love,
Too dead to die, too fast for blood

Now the smell of flesh and bone,
makes me feel right at home,
And if you don't leave screaming baby,
You won't leave at all!

Too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast for blood [2x]

Do what I can to get by
and I don't mind a little crime,
Death is my fucking drug
Too dead to die, too fast for blood

Now the smell of flesh
and bone makes me feel right at home
And if you don't leave screaming baby,
you won't leave at all!

Too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast for blood [2x]

Too fast!

Too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast for blood [2x]
