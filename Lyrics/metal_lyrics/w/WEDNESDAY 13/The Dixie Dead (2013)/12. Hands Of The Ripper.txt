Come in, come in my next victim,
Gonna sink, sink, sink in my teeth right in,
Your lips they wet my appetite,
Now welcome to this violent night,

Don't go out alone tonight,
Now the Devil's waiting for you,
in the pale moonlight,

No escape, hands of the ripper
Mutilate, hands of the ripper
Meet your fate, hands of the ripper

If you don't mind I'm next in line,
Gonna run my nails down your spine
I am the Ripper that's no doubt
I'll rip your goddamn heart right out

Don't go out alone tonight
Now the Devil's waiting for you,
in the pale moonlight,

No escape, hands of the ripper
Mutilate, hands of the ripper
Meet your fate, hands of the ripper
