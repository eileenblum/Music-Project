Gonna take you where the moon don't shine
Way back beyond the pine
Tell you a story of the very worst kind, yeah

They said they were invincible
So indestructible
The most horrific thing you've seen, yeah

Now load it, load it, make your bet
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead
[x2]

Some say they stomp around the swamp
And blood is all they want
Just call it Hillbilly homicide, yeah

And they say when the moon is full
Those motherfucking ghouls
Are ready to bleed you dry, yeah

Now load it, load it, make your bet
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead
[x2]

Now load it, load it, make your bet
Beware the Dixie dead
Dixie dead
[x2]
