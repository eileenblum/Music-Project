I made my mind up
Your blood I wanna suck
Just tap the vein, give it to me

The sun now has set
Donât make me beg for it
Just tap the vein, give it to me

With my things that go bump in the night
Go ahead and scream, baby
Scream for your life

You got blood and we want it
You got blood and we need it
You got blood and weâll drink it
Iâm a blood sucker, motherfucker
[x2]

The darkness has arrived
And now we say goodbye
Just tap the vein, give it to me

And now I lick my lips
Your death I canât resist
Just tap the vein, give it to me

With my things that go bump in the night
Go ahead and scream, baby
Scream for your life

You got blood and we want it
You got blood and we need it
You got blood and weâll drink it
Iâm a blood sucker, motherfucker
[x2]

And if you got the blood
Then I got the time
And if you donât, motherfucker,
Donât waste my time

You got blood and we want it
You got blood and we need it
You got blood and weâll drink it
Iâm a blood sucker, motherfucker
[x2]
