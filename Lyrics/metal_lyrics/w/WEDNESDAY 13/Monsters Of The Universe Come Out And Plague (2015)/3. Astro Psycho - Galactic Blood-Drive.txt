Astro Psycho!

Bringer of death
Destroyer of life
I'm crushing your fucking planets
One at a time
The earthlings try to run
and try to be free
you can't escape me

Are you ready
For this devastation
The end is here
Fucking Annihilation

I rule the planets Motherfuckers!
Galactic Royalty
But you can call me
Astro Psycho!

I rule the planets Motherfuckers!
Galactic Royalty
But you can call me
Astro Psycho!

We came here long ago
And taught you all you know
And now you know too much
You gotta fucking go!
No one of your world
Is getting out alive
Galactic Blood Drive!

I rule the planets Motherfuckers!
Galactic Royalty
But you can call me
Astro Psycho!

Are you ready
For this devastation
The end is here
Fucking Annihilation

I rule the planets Motherfuckers!
Galactic Royalty
But you can call me
Astro Psycho!

I rule the planets Motherfuckers!
Galactic Royalty
But you can call me
Astro Psycho!
