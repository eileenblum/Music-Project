They've got a plan for me and you
And you better do exactly what they tell you to

Big brother behind every door
Just like in 1984

They've got the bombs, they've got the guns, this is a war
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
They've got the bombs, they've got the guns, this is a war
Is this the life you've been waiting for?

Oh say, can you see
Nothing is what it seems?

Everything you do, think or say
Just know they're watching you from the cradle to the grave

Big brother behind every door
Just like in 1984

They've got the bombs, they've got the guns, this is a war
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
They've got the bombs, they've got the guns, this is a war
Is this the life you've been waiting for?

Oh say, can you see
Nothing is what it seems?

This is a war!

Big brother behind every door
Just like in 1984

They've got the bombs, they've got the guns, this is a war
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
They've got the bombs, they've got the guns, this is a war
Is this the life you've been waiting for?

Oh say, can you see
Nothing is what it seems?
