Just kiss your ass goodbye
theyÂ´re falling from the skies
and you can hear 'em screaming redrum
and all your faith is hope
itÂ´s been a fucking joke
now who will be screaming oh my god

Another solar system
controls the earth like a prison
Total extinction of the human race
is their prime mission
Now they've tired to keep
us all asleep
now weÂ´re all dead
Now they're here
and ready to creep

YouÂ´re going to get
what you deserve
Monsters of the universe
there's no escape
dead is assured
monsters of the universe
There is no faith
there is no cure
monsters of the universe
It's pure intergalactic war

Their hands around your throat
and as you gasp and choke
you're gagging pleading screaming oh my god
and he can't save you darling
and that's the fucking problem
because your puny god never was

Another solar system
controls the earth like a prison
Total extinction of the human race
is their prime mission
Now they've tired to keep
us all asleep
now weÂ´re all dead
Now they're here
and ready to creep

YouÂ´re going to get
what you deserve
Monsters of the universe
there's no escape
dead is assured
monsters of the universe
There is no faith
there is no cure
monsters of the universe
It's pure intergalactic war

Now is the time
for you to die
your final breath
is what we'll take
from you tonight
there is no cure
from this curse
we are the monsters...
...of the universe
