No orbit can withstand us
We are the chosen ones
We are the chaos bringers
Of destruction

Within the rings of Saturn
The transmission feeds
Complete domination
Of humanity

We rule and we own you
You have no thought control
Pulling all the planets
Into the blackest hole

Galactic widow makers
It is our destiny
Within the depths of space
No one can hear youâ¦ scream!

Can't stop, you can't stop it
Planet eater
Can't stop, you can't stop it
Planet eater
Can't stop, you can't stop it
Planet eater
Can't stop, you can't stop it
Planet eater
Planet eater

Can't stop, you can't stop it
Planet eater
Can't stop, you can't stop it
Planet eater
Can't stop, you can't stop it
Planet eater
Can't stop, you can't stop it
Planet eater
