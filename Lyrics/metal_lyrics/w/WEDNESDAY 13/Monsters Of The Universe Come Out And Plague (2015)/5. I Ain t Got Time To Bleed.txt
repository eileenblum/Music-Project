They say that's there's no way out alive
And I don't mind it
They say this mission is suicide
And I don't mind it

Man-Up now, it's do or die
Nobody's getting out alive

I ain't got time to bleed
Just keep your eyes on the enemy
I ain't got time to bleed

I ain't got time to bleed
Just keep your eyes on the enemy
I ain't got time to bleed

Put up a shirt or start talking shit
And I don't mind it
They say that death is fucking imminent
And I don't mind it

Man-Up now, it's do or die
Nobody's getting out alive

I ain't got time to bleed
Just keep your eyes on the enemy
I ain't got time to bleed

I ain't got time to bleed
Just keep your eyes on the enemy
I ain't got time to bleed

Don't bury me
I'm not finished yet
But every dogs
Gotta have its day
And I wont leave a trail in regret
I'll go find another way...to the grave

I ain't got time to bleed
Just keep your eyes on the enemy
I ain't got time to bleed

I ain't got time to bleed
Just keep your eyes on the enemy
I ain't got time to bleed
