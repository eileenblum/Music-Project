Bow down and accept your fate if you're praying to God
Then you're praying too late and all the right things
you've learned are wrong
Brothers and sisters we are not alone

We are the nightmares that you cannot dream
An intergalactic killing machine
An eye is upon you your future is doomed
All hypnotized by the hollow moon

Everybody keep watching the skies
Everything you know is a lie
From the day you were born
You were born to die
Everything you know is a lie

No way, do you have a chance
The government's got you in a trance
And now you're on the way to the body bag
Just keep falling for the old false flag

We are the nightmares that you cannot dream
An intergalactic killing machine
An eye is upon you your future is doomed
All hypnotized by the hollow moon

Everybody keep watching the skies
Everything you know is a lie
From the day you were born
You were born to die
Everything you know is a lie

Everybody keep watching the skies
Everything you know is a lie
From the day you were born
You were born to die
Everything you know is a lie

Everybody keep watching the skies
Everything you know is a lie
From the day you were born
You were born to die
Everything you know is a lie

Everybody keep watching the skies
Everything you know is a lie
From the day you were born
You were born to die
Everything you know is a lie
