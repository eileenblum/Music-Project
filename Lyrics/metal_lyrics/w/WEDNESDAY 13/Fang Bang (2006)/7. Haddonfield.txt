It's getting dark and scary
When the stars start falling down
Who will make it through the night
Who will live and who will die
I guess nobody knows

It was the night that he came home
So you don't go out alone
When it's dark in Haddonfield
It was the night that he came home
So you don't go out alone
When there's blood in Haddonfield

And now he's looking for Laurie
But she doesn't even know
Gonna baby-sit tonight
And who will make it out alive
I guess nobody knows

It's only the boogie man
And he knows what he wants tonight
But Loomis is trailing him
And he won't go without a fight, oh no
