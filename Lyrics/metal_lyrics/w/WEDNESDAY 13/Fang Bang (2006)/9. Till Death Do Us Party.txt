It's Friday, and everything is great
And my stupid friends got a dumb idea
Gonna go down to the lake
And we don't care about the stories we've heard
And we're too damn dumb to realize
That we're never going to return

And soon enough we're gonna meet Voorhees
We might as well write it on our heads
Come and kill us please

Hey you don't be late
Till death do us party right here on Crystal Lake

We got everything that we need
Let's go skinny dipping
Drink some beer and don't forget the weed
And have your brain at the door
'Cause where we're going
You won't even need it anymore

We couldn't have planned it better
If we tried
We got nothing to lose but our lives
T &amp; A and an early grave
Well sigh me up
Now Jason's here in the nick of time
To fuck us all up
