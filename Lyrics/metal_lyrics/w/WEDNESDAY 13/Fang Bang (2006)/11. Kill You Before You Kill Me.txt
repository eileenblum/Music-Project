B-B-Baby you and I don't get along
And one of us will have to go before too long
I'm just trying to find the fastest way
To make you the fuck away
And I know you've got a few tricks of your own

And you know I've tried to walk that line
With you a couple million times
Every time the mission failed
And I hope you understand
Why this has come to be
I've got to kill you before you kill me

Sometimes you and I don't see eye to eye
So let me load this gun again
And we can try
I'm just trying to find the fastest way
To blow you the fuck away
And I know you've got a few tricks of your own
