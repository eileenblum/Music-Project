I'm the rotten seed in the mouth
Of a world that wants to spit me out
No longer human by tomorrow

I'm the scum of the earth
I'm a galactic reject birth
No longer human by tomorrow

Erase myself from the human race
All aboard this rocket into space
I'll die Sci-Fi
And kiss the earth goodbye

In the cosmic hands of death
Is where I'll take me last breath
No longer human by tomorrow

Into the stars, sparkling bright
I'll die Sci-Fi
No longer human by tomorrow

I'll kiss the earth goodbye
Die Sci-Fi, die Sci-Fi
Die Sci-Fi, die Sci-fi
Die Sci-Fi, die Sci-fi
