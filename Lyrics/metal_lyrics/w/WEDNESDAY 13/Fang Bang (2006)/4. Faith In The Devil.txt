You know he's good, he's bad
He loves it when you're sad
He loves to rock out
With his cock hanging out

So hold your horns up
Like you just don't give a fuck
So sing out loud with the sinners around
And c'mon

And he don't need no fucking sympathy
He represents the highest class
I'm talking about you and me

So have some faith in the devil
So have some faith in the devil
So have some faith in the devil
So have some faith in the devil

You know he's black, he's white
He's always fucking right
He loves to drink, fight
And fuck every night

He's so sharp dressed
Sometimes a fucking mess
So sing out loud
If you're evil and proud, c'mon
