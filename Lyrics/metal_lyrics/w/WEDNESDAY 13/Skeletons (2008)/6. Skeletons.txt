They come and talk to me
When I am all alone
They always remind me of all the things that I've done wrong

It's scary, disturbing, but somehow I'm not sorry
The only thing that's even real is the feelings that I don't feel
They're all the same
But they're so different
They're leaving evidence of my darkest secrets

I hear them, they're calling
The skeletons in my closet
I hear them, they're calling
The skeletons in my closet

It's taking parts of me into the unknown
It's like a void inside of me that goes on and on and on

It's scary, disturbing, but somehow I'm not sorry
The only thing that's even real is the feelings that I don't feel
They're all the same
But all so different
They're leaving evidence of my darkest secrets

I hear them, they're calling
The skeletons in my closet
I hear them, they're calling
The skeletons in my closet

Now I just can't pretend to forget
These voices in my head
And they just wont stop screaming

They're all the same but all so different
They're leaving evidence of my darkest secrets

I hear them they're calling
The skeletons in my closet
I hear them they're calling
The skeletons in my closet
