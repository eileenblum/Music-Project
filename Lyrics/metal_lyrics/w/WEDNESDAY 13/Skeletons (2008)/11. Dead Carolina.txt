Trying to see through this death that I breath,
All these ghosts they are lost in front of me,
Lost in a trance, never had the chance,
Now were forced to walk the dead's dance.

Everything is gray now,
Ashes all across the floor,
And I'm just hoping that I find the key to unlock this door.

And you know that I'm trying,
To make my way through the art of dying,
And I'm trying so hard to find ya,
In this dead Carolina.

Shadows they fall off the walls in the halls,
And it lays out a path for the dead to walk,
Nothing to say, we're all lost in our ways,
Now the dead and decayed march in this dark parade.

Everything is gray now,
Ashes all across the floor,
And I'm just hoping that I find the key to unlock this door.

And you know that I'm trying,
To make my way through the art of dying,
And I'm trying so hard to find ya,
In this dead Carolina.

D.E.A.D. Carolina.
