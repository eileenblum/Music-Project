Gimme gimme bloodshed
Gimme gimme hell yeah.

Open your eyes sweet Mary Jane take a look around,
You're miles away from anyone,
And no one can hear a sound.

Now you're knock,knock,knocking on heavens door while,
You're chained to a dirty floor,
Your sunshine just got lowered into,
Into an early grave.

Gimme gimme bloodshed
Gimme gimme hell yeah
Gimme gimme bloodshed oh yeah.

Yeah blood is red sweet Mary Jane and you know it's trues,
It's dripping from body now,
And it's filling up this room.

And you scream,scream,screaming but no one hears a thing,
Cause you're locked away,
Your sunshine just got lowered into,
Into an early grave.

Gimme gimme bloodshed
Gimme gimme hell yeah
Gimme gimme bloodshed oh yeah.

Now I, have a confession,
A love affair with Smith and Wesson,
Brutality is my obsession,
And i can never get enough.

Gimme gimme bloodshed
Gimme gimme hell yeah
Gimme gimme bloodshed oh yeah.
