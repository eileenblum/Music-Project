The rules that you make are the rules that we break,
And we slither through your system now just like snakes,
Pat us on the back and tell us we're great,
Then you grab us by the throat and feed us our fate.

We've got a problem with your solutions,
Just hell-bent on our own confusion,
You can't shake hands now with your fist,
Cause that kind of friendship don't exist.

Mom and dad look at me now,
I know you're so damn proud,
The baby that you used to kiss,
I can not resist these middle fingers on my fist.

HEY, this is not another teenage anthem.

But it sounds like one,
For all the bored and the young,
Who dare to be dumb.

They look and they say it's so sad and a shame,
How anyone could ever turn out like this way,
But in a world of lairs and hypocrites,
You're the reason that this monster exists.

Quick to point the finger saying who's at fault,
That rock and roll and movies operate our thoughts,
They only reason we do what we do is,
To shove it down the throats of pricks like you.

Mom and dad look at me now,
I know you're so damn proud,
The baby that you used to kiss,
I can not resist these middle fingers on my fist.

HEY, this is not another teenage anthem.

And we don't need a reason,
To give you all a fucking beating,
And if you think can make us,
Go ahead and try and take us.

Mom and dad look at me now,
I know you're so damn proud,
The baby that you used to kiss,
I can not resist these middle fingers on my fist.

HEY, this is not another teenage anthem.

We don't care.
