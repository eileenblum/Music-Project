I love to say fuck when I'm driving in my car
Fuck when I'm walking in the fucking park
Fuck you if you don't like what I say
I love to say fuck every fucking day
Oh yeah

I love to say fuck
I love to say fuck
I love to say fuck
I love to say fuck

Well I ain't got a fucking problem
I just love to say fuck
And I don't care who's around me
I could really give a fuck
And I don't care if you're my mother
Or my motherfucking father
I could really give a fuck now
That ain't my motherfucking problem

Oh, yeah
I love to say fuck when I'm driving in my car
Fuck when I'm walking in the fucking park
Fuck you if you don't like what I say
I love to say fuck every fucking day
Oh yeah

I love to say fuck
I love to say fuck
I love to say fuck
I love to say fuck

F.U.C.K. every fucking day (Fuck fuck fuck fuck)
F.U.C.K. every fucking day (Fuck fuck fuck fuck)
F.U.C.K. every fucking day (Fuck fuck fuck fuck)
F.U.C.K. every fucking day (Fuck fuck fuck fuck)
