It's a perfect day to crawl from my grave then search for brains
I'm bleeding in my head, taking mini steps, welcome local freak
Dark and scary I don't mind at all
I'm laughing as darkness falls

See the corpses rise from there graves
Listen close you can hear them say
They can smell your brains, they can smell your brains, they can smell your brains and they can smell your
See the corpses rise from there graves
Listen close you can hear them say
I think it's everdent you, if you send more paramedics

Of the living dead, of the living dead, of the living dead it's the return of (2x)

It's a graveyard bash, fall crashing the gate, dancing on graves,
I'll take that walk to the dead man store, searching for brain
Dark and scary I don't mind at all
I'm laughing as darkness falls

See the corpses rise from there graves
Listen close you can hear them say
They can smell your brains, they can smell your brains, they can smell your brains and they can smell your
See the corpses rise from there graves
Listen close you can hear them say
I think it's everdent you, if you send more paramedics

Of the living dead, of the living dead, of the living dead it's the return of (2x)

See the corpses rise from there graves
Listen close you can hear them say
They can smell your brains, they can smell your brains, they can smell your brains and they can smell your
See the corpses rise from there graves
Listen close you can hear them say
I think it's everdent you, if you send more paramedics

Of the living dead, of the living dead, of the living dead it's the return of (4x)

THEY CAN SMELL YOUR BRAINS
