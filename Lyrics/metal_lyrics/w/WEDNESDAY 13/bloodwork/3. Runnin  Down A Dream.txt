[originally by Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers]It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
I had the radio on, I was drivin'
The trees flew by me and jack were singin'
Little runaway, I was flyin'

Yeah, runnin' down a dream
That never would come to me
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream

It felt so good like anything was possible
I hit cruise control and rubbed eyes
The last three days the rain was unstoppable
It was always cold, no sunshine

Yeah, runnin' down a dream
That never would come to me
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream

I rolled on as the sky grew dark
I put the pedal to the metal to make some time
Somethin' good went down this road
I'm pickin' up whatever is mine, mine, mine, oh mine, yeah

Yeah, runnin' down a dream
That never would come to me
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream
