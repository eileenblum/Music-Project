Picking up the pieces

As I wander through the rain
We've made it through to the other side
now we're allowed to feel the pain

December looms before us and the nights grow cold and grey
And it wears the shroud of tragedy
Still it fails to hide it's shame

Casting off the shadows
That eclipse the morning rays
There's no way back from misery
Until you put the past away

If I could see behind your eyes what words do not betray
We would save us both a little time
And could cast aside these chains

But under your spell my will it just melts away
There's no way I can escape
I'm taken to another plane
As I wait for the night to fall
Dragged onward into the end
I submit to your embrace
Not sure if I will endure
The cold on this long walk home...

For the Long walk home...

Leaving all behind
We take the long way back
To a better time in another world
In a lost and distant past

I never thought that I
Ever write these words
Never thought that i'd
Write the final verse

Leaving all behind
Leaving all behind

Write the final verse...
