Struck down dealing out mercy and slaughter
Temptation whatâs one more lost sheep in the flock?
Donât waste your time on such trivial things as salvation
We sell candles to blind men take food from the mouths of the lot

Children... are you reading along?
Martyrs... sacrificed for a song!

No more time for the silver tonged liars
Temptation selling us more than youâve got
Donât turn around to see pasts that have been left behind us
No looking back, no forgiveness in hell, they will rot

I went to sleep in another world
Lost as I dreamed of our end
Seeing a fortune now lost to me
Then I wake up to find it was all in my head

Crosses fixed to frail men on an altar
Disgraceful images of paradise lost
What kind of spirit letâs children pass on so before them
May we leave them behind start anew let the past be forgot

Children... are you reading along?
Martyrs... sacrificed for a song!

I went to sleep in another world
Lost as I dreamed of our end
Seeing a fortune now lost to me
Then I wake up to find it was all in my head!

Children... are you reading along?
Martyrs... sacrificed for a song
Children... are you reading along?
Martyrs... sacrificed for a song...
