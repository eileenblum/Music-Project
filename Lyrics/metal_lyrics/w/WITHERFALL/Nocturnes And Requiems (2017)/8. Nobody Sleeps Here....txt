It isnât the time now to tell her our plans
It isnât our fault that this nightmare wonât end
At first it was like a dream
Now Iâm only reminded of death

She was a shadow on the walls of my room
How quickly those same walls became my tomb
Oh how they welcomed me to sleep
Now I can only wait for the dawn and weep...
I wait for the dawn and weep

There is a dark man at the door
Waiting for me to step outside
Nobody sleeps here anymore
If only a dream would let me hide...

Iâm lying anxious in the light of the moon
Though beyond the curtain some devil still looms
I wait here paralyzed with fear
And I wonder how much time I have left
I come to quickly thereâs a knock on my door
So many dark memories flood back in once more
I wish for a way that I can run and hide
Thereâs only one way out but I just canât go outside
I just canât go outside

There is a dark man at the door
Waiting for me to step outside
Nobody sleeps here anymore
If only a dream would let me hide...

I see someone standing in the shadows
He wonât come into the light
Maybe Iâll go to him and see just what he has in store for me
It canât be worse than another sleepless night...

Oh how I prayed for the end, this unbearable dream
Could no longer pretend, she was not
I went to sleep in another world
Lost in a dream not my own

Oh how I prayed for the end, this unbearable dream
Could no longer pretend, she was not as she seemed...

There is a dark man at the door
Waiting for me to step outside
Nobody sleeps here anymore
It was only a dream

There is a dark man at the door
Waiting for me to step outside
Nobody sleeps here anymore
It was only a dream

It was only a dream
But now... the Nightmare is gone...
