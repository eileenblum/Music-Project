There was a time when it almost came true
When my fate was to be decided
I was left clinging to you
Holding the remains of my life
And itâs over now

The stage was set
No one really knew what to expect
Then silent eyes casted along a path headed to demise
So now we wait trained on the end
In this great debate
Short on time with no recourse
We cross the line into the end

Ah...
Ah...
Ah...

So now we wait
Held captive to a lie believed to the day
Those sins repaid
Now years have passed and lines left to betray
Suspended in time weâve lost the will
The nerve to carry on
Short on time, now no remorse
Weâve crossed the line âthis will be the endâ

Ah...
Ah...
Ah...

I was caught sleeping for the great awakening
Eyes silent, shades dark
To be innocent
To pass on through...
