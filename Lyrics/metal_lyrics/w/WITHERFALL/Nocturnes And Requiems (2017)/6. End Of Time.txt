In a corner hate can serve us well
It circles round us only time can tell
Lies die slowly
Now in the courtyard sounds a distant bell
Itâs only there to warn us
Of some impending hell
I can see it...

Rise up from under the old world
And into another day on the wind we make our way...

Onward through history reeling from impotence
You wage your war from the pages of books
Leading the charge from the comfort of ignorance
The taking of innocent lives without firing a shot

Cradle of civilization your omnibus
Losing the battle and not winning the war
Staying the hand of the leper in all of us
You take up the sword of forgiveness with no remorse

So now that itâs done
Weâve come to the end of time
Letâs just let it die and fall from our eyes
Theyâve poisoned the well, the promise of paradise a lie
We live our lives one step from the end... of time

Pushing past ignorance we take on our enemies
Breaking down walls that once kept out the damned
Leading the charge as they lay down in front of us
Leaving the sheep to kneel as we make our stand!

So now that itâs done
Weâve come to the end of time
Letâs just let it die and fall from our eyes
Theyâve poisoned the well, the promise of paradise a lie
We live our lives one step from the end...

So now that itâs done
Weâve come to the end of time
Letâs just let it die and fall from our eyes
Theyâve poisoned the well, the promise of paradise a lie
We live our lives one step from the end... of time!

In the garden lost in lifeâs frantic pace
The mystery defines us
Leaves without a trace
Lines of history
In the courtyard silence casts its spell
Leaves us to our memories ghosts and demons dwell
Someone save me...
âCause Iâm not the person I once was
And into another life I expire...
