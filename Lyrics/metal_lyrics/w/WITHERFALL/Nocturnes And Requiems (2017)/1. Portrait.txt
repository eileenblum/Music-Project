Thereâs a portrait on the wall and it seems sheâs smiling
A lady in black with red stains on her dress
Tied to a tree is a rope and it hangs longingly
Under the moon a procession of death

I can see her standing there, in a trance she calls to me
Underneath this moonlit starry night
Siren song takes me in, there is no saving me
Alone in this nightmare I walk into the light

I can hear her say
Come with me and I will show you what I have seen
Slowly ascending our way towards a dream, so steadily
âShadows entwined around this dark heart of mine, it lies silentlyâ

In between my trembling hands her neck slides gracefully
Rolling eyes no longer look so hard
I see sheâs fading fast disappearing before me
Her life slips away under my grasp

Come with me and I will show you what I have seen
Slowly ascending our way towards a dream, so steadily
âShadows entwined around this dark heart of mine, it lies silentlyâ
