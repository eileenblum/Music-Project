I can't find my center, though I've been
Through this hall before
The light is rushing past us
As we open up the door
The room is slowly spinning
As I try and make my way
To the other side beyond the gate
My final resting place

In the shallows,
The murky light of the dawn
We are shadows,
Reflecting visions on these walls...

We are nothing
This isn't real
We dance in madness
Pretending the truth is revealed
We are nothing
Our souls are just flickering lights
To be extinguished,
Snuffed out by the cold hands of time.

Staring into nothing
Only memories survive
Wading into darkness,
No illusions I'm alive
My life is flashing quickly through my mind
&amp; begins to fade
Into the abyss, the eternal night
As my being slips away

What is this?
What do you have in store for me now...
I've given into your wishes so far
One last time, I'll abide by your rule

Who am I?
Will there be anything left of me now?
You tell me nothing and no one here knows...
If I close my eyes
Can I will them back open again...
