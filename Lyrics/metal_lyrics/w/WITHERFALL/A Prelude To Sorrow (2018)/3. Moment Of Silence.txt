Staring into darkness
We try and make our way
Lost inside this paradox
Of solitude and shame

We're all falling
Towards the same uncertain end...
Destined to be nothing but kings
On a tumbling hill of sand

The line is breaking and time has passed us by
So let's all bow our heads
In a moment of silence
This is the hour... Dark empty sober eyes
Will watch us fall from grace...
A moment of silence

Enslaved, we move around this room
As if we have a choice
As if a door will suddenly appear
To take us through these walls
Into another life
Only to find "The truth is" what you fear

Fall into the mptiness
We all
Are consigned to the shadows
Fall into the emptiness
We are
We are destined
Destined for nothing

The line is breaking and time has passed us by
So let's all bow our heads in a moment...

I.I.I. Outro
The line is breaking and time has passed us by
So let's all bow our heads in a moment...
In a moment of silence
This is the hour...
Dark empty sober eyes
Will watch us fall from grace...
In a moment of silence...
In a moment of silence
