Time and suffering,
The only constants in my fragmented existence
I am the void
Slaves ain't masochistic
They bow their heads
And pretend they wear a crown
They sit on their throne of the dead

Shadows are all that I see
Is there anyone left alive
Come and give me sanctuary
Shadows are beckoning me
Follow us to the end of time
Far away from tragedy

Pain and desperation the only option
Time will accept no forgiveness
I watch them fall
The end a simple concept
We are waiting for nothing
As our lives pass us by
We are blind to the struggle ahead

Everywhere I look
People walking 'round acting restkess
Saying things they do not mean
As they look in my eyes, with a smile:
I play unoffended...
I play unoffended...

Shadows are all that I see
Is there anyone left alive
Come and give me sanctuary
Shadows are beckoning me
Follow us to the end of time
Far away from tragedy

Shadows are all that I see
Is there anyone left alive
Come and give me sanctuary
As it all falls apart
And we watch the dawning of the end
'Til all the lines of existence fade away...
