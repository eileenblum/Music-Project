Invited we walk through scattered bones
The remains of the wicked
Left to mingle with the unknown
In the garden, left behind all I once knew
I can't say I'm not excited at the thought that
I'll soon be passing through
And I know that these are just words

Lies I tell myself when I'm alone at night
And there's no one there to answer my prayers
My communion of the wicked.
Will this night be my last

The ground is stained, a fallen lark
Where trembling shadows lie
The dream is lost still I'm not awake
If I could only close my eyes
And reach the other side of fear
We wear the mark of innocence in vain...
We tell ourselves these lies to hide the shame
And we'll soon be passing through

Lies I tell myself when I'm alone at night
And there's no one there to answer my prayers
My communion of the wicked.
Will this night be my last

Our time is closing in
We are never to return
And now we say goodbye
As tomorrow drifts away...
