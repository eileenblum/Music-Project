We question ourselves till all is revealed
Till we're left with nothing
No cards left to play
No mystery left unrevealed
I gave you my words, then you needed more
If time wasn't spent on such trivial things
Then you would have noticed before

When you give nothing
Nothing is what you'll receive

So here now again we try and stay whole
So easy we fall into a well of despair
So easy to wallow alone

Sometimes mirrors only show
What we want to see

And we'll fall into despair
And we'll get no reprieve
As we descend further down

You see what you want to see
In our ode to despair
And we'll get no reprieve
In our ode to despair

Time just slips away
