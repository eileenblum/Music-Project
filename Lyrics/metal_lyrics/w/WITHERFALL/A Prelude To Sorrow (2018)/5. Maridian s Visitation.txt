Time is cruel, it slowly follows us
Like a trailing and ever fading light
'Til there's nothing left,
Just shadows cast on the graves
Of those we left behind

Then you're fine for a while
'Til it all falls apart
And we try to forget
It will be us next time around...

Now we're here in this void of space and time
Into eternity we fall
The distant sun has set
Only shadows now remain
Still somehow we chase the light
