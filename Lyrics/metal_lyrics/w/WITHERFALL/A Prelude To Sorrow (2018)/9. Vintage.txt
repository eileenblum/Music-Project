A solitary light, not a soul arounds us
As it burns in my mind,
Illuminating the despair
It goes on into the night,
The hours go by quickly
Like every stranger passing
By pretending not to care

Now it's everywhere that I look
Their faces all seem so unreal
Like they're ripped from the pages of books
Now they're lost and never revealed...

Now the haze is setting in,
And the silence begs the question...
Could it be just from the wine?
That we're numb beyond repair
So, we slip back into the light,
To hide from the shadows
But they follow close behind,
Whispering in our ears

The light is now fading
A shadow walks by my side
She whispers "You must let go now"
And Maridian's waiting...
She tells me I'm not alone
It's as if my world is coming down...

Time is not worried,
Doesn't care about plans
The things we create
Will be ripped from our hands
If I can't pretend that I'm not losing this fight
And all is forsaken
But the memory of a slowly dissolving lie...

We can't take it back

No...I will not succumb
I will not obey, into fires of hell
I'm alone but I am not afriad
I have never shown you what i AM
Or what I can make out of this shell

Seen from above into the world below
Am I lost?
Alone on this final stage the spotlight gone...
So afraid...
I'm leaving here to a place I do not know
Is this the end?
Gone from this existence will I go on?
Somewhere in time to reappear... like an echo:
My voice will carry on.

Travel on my friend,
Your memory will never die...
From nothing you made a world your own
This is not the end, your music remains alive
The cadence of life can't resolve

Travel on my friend, your story forever told...
From nothing you made a world your own
This is not the end, you'll always e by my side
When I feel like I can't go on anymore.....
