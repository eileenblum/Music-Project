Dark past ancient time
You must fight to stay alive
Blasphemy there is no God
Who would help against the mob

And in this chaos a baby is born
To be a king and to rule all alone

Half a God half a man
Came the antichrist to ban
Praying peace don't you hear
'Cause the end is almost near

On every fire they praise his fame
He's a hero Destroyer's his name

Half a God half a man
Came the antichrist to ban
Praying peace don't you hear
'Cause the end is almost near

And in this chaos a baby is born
To be a king and to rule all alone
Alone
