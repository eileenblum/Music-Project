Midnight's coming I see devils running
And I feel it's not only a dream
I know what they want I know it now
They want to get me and take my soul away

The hall is open and Earth's vibrating
I see the devil's celebrating they start a haunting
They want to catch me
They want to torture and take my soul away

Nightmare
I'm living in a neverending nightmare
And there's no chance to be save
In a nightmare in a neverending nightmare
I look around I see the devil on my right
And I feel it's time to die
I loose the fight I have no chance
He's gonna kill me and take my soul away

Nightmare
I'm living in a neverending nightmare
And there's no chance to be save
In a nightmare in a neverending nightmare
Nightmare
I'm living in a neverending nightmare
And there's no chance to be save
In a nightmare in a neverending nightmare
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare
