Sunny Wednesday noon
In the crowded city
Mother's out for shopping
Children on their hands
Business went as usual
At Tati's discount
But joy became horror
'Cause killers were around

Sunny Wednesday noon
In the bloodshed streets
Dying and wounded
Littered all the ground
A black day for Paris
It wasn't the last
How long must we live
At mercy of the bombs?

Fire and thunder, five people dead
What's the sense? Terror stroke again
Innocent victims, slaughtered and killed
Fire and thunder, Paris in fear

The world is shocked
The world is in pain
Is there no solution to live in peace again?
Should we bow to anarchy?
Should we get extorted?
Or should we take revenge
And risk a bloody war?

Fire and thunder, five people dead
What's the sense? Terror stroke again
Innocent victims, slaughtered and killed
Fire and thunder, Paris in fear

Fire and thunder, five people dead
What's the sense? Terror stroke again
Innocent victims, slaughtered and killed
Fire and thunder, Paris in fear

Fire and thunder, five people dead
What's the sense? Terror stroke again
Innocent victims, slaughtered and killed
Fire and thunder, Paris in fear
