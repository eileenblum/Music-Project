Going to church on Sunday
And you don't know why
Holy priests are praying
But they all feign and lie
Judas' wearing cassocks
Pious should one be
They are only hypocrites
Betraying you and me

God will help you if you pay
Heaven is for sale
Jesus is hanging upside down
I think the lord has failed

Middle ages inquisition
Slaughter in the name of God
Tortures, torments, burning witches
Confess or you'll die in rot
Pious farmers work and fast,
That lazy priests can have their meal
Orgies behind cloister walls
Lust instead of piety

God will help you if you pay
Heaven is for sale
Jesus is hanging upside down
I think the lord has failed

God will help you if you pay
Heaven is for sale
Jesus is hanging upside down
I think the lord has failed
God will help you if you pay
Heaven is for sale
Jesus is hanging upside down
I think the lord has failed
