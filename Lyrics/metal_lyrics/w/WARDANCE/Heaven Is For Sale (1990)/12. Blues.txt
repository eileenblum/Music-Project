Woke up in the morning
And I found that you're gone
Just a note "I am sorry"
And you left me alone
I can hardly remember
What happened last night
Guess we went to a party?
Did we get in a fight?

I need you so badly
Baby why did you go?

Woke up in the morning
I've had too much to drink
I don't know where my pants are
I'm still to drunk to think
You took my beer with you
In the fridge is the phone
I'm trying to call you
Why aren't to home

I need you so badly
Baby why did you go?

Woke up in the morning

Just a note "I am sorry"

Did we get in a fight?

I need you so badly
Baby why did you go?
