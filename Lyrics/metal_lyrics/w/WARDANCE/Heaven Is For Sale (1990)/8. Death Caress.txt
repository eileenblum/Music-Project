I'm dreaming in the night to sleep
With your body to mine
And  feel you shiver by
Running my fingers down your spine
I'd touch you gently
And then I would treat you like a whore
I wanna see you on your knees
And crawling on the floor

I'm sitting in the room with you
In the dead of the night
The moonlight's shining bright
The razor's twinkling in the light
My fingers softly touch the blade
There's madness in my eyes
Blood is running from your throat
And dripping on the floor

Die from my death caress

I'm sitting in the room with you
In the dead of the night
The moonlight's shining bright
The razor's twinkling in the light
My fingers softly touch the blade
There's madness in my eyes
Blood is running from your throat
And dripping on the floor

Die from my death caress die
Die from my death caress die
Die from my death caress die
Die from my death caress die
Die from my death caress die
Die from my death caress die
Die from my death caress die
Die from my death caress die
