Holiday out to play
Life can be so nice
They are young, look for fun
And think it's paradise
And think it's paradise

But something strange is going on
Can't you feel that something's wrong
This time it is not a game
Jason is the hangman's name

Beware take care
It's Friday the 13th

Tonight's the masquerade of pain
Take care of the insane
Incarnation of the bad
Jason comes and he is mad
Showdown in the dawn
And you defeated him alone
But one day he comes back again
To take revenge on Friday the 13th

Beware take care
It's Friday the 13th
