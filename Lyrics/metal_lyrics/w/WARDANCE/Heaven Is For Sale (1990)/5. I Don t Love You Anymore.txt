Don't look at me with your bedroom eyes
That used to promise me so much
You won't change my mind
I'll leave despite your tender touch

I was the jester of your court
You. made a fool of me
And like a brand you burnt yourself
Into my memory

I hate you I love you too
And now I wear you like a scar
You think you're irresistible
But now I can see through all the lies
The little lies that you were telling me
I hate you I love you too
And now I wear you like a scar

My mind is going round in circles
Should I stay or should I leave?
My heart is in your hand
You stole it like a thief

I thought your love was true
I was too blind to see
That you're a teaser
And your gift was pain and misery

I hate you I love you too
And now I wear you like a scar
I hate you I love you too
And now I wear you like a scar
I hate you I love you too
And now I wear you like a scar
