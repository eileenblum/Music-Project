Wake up in the night
I'm screaming cold sweat on my face
Was it real or was it just my fantasy?
Evil eyes around my bed
It looks as if the glass has told the truth

The cards will never tell you lies
Though still you hope you can survive

Can you see the skull beside you
Satan smiles he's there
If you're weak your life is in his claws
Look into the gypsy's is ball
Dive into the secrets of your soul

The cards will never tell you lies
Though still you hope you can survive

Do you think I'm mad I'm crazy?
Join our circle now
Evocation
The wizard holds the magic key
Imagination has its limits
There are things you won't believe
They're true
