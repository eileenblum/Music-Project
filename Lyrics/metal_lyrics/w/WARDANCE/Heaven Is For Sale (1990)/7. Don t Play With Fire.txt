I was looking for love
When I first saw your face
Pretty little boy full of grace
I swore my love would last for all time
Never thought you would treat me unkind

Now I can see that you're too young
Wanna enjoy your life and have some fun
But watch out
Don't play with fire
You'll get your fingers burnt
Don't play with fire
One day you might die in the flames

Now I'm walking the road of tears and sorrow
But after rain there's sun tomorrow
Let me tell you you'll grow up and learn
And one day you'll see what you did to me

Now I can see that you're too young
Wanna enjoy your life and have some fun
But watch out
Don't play with fire
You'll get your fingers burnt
Don't play with fire
One day you might die in the flames

Don't play with fire
You'll get your fingers burnt
Don't play with fire
One day you might die in the flames
