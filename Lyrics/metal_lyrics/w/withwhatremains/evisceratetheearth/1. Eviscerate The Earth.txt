Eviscerate, embrace the hate within
Regurgitate the lies you push, into our skin
With a frenzy of feeding
We muster in the lies

Hate
This time I'm making a stand
At this point in my own life 
My walls are concrete and you're not gonna smash
Through my walls

I see the light of who...
...of who, I am meant to be 

The night is getting colder
As my veins begin to recede
Digging deeper inside my mind
To see who I've become 
The fury is buried deep inside my gut
And now it's my time to be set free

I will tear through the heart and pulverise, the cage
In which my life lays prisoner
No more will I be trodden by your mind

I'm clawing my way out

With
Nooses we stand in line 
Your
Existence will fall
If you follow...
