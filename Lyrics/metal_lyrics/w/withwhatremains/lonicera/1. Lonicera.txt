I'm afraid 

Where is that part of me?
I can't reclaim from the world that took me over
Let me know
How to let things go 

Is it too hard to see? 
When I'm reaching out for your hand 
Let me know 
How to let you go

Could this just be a dream?
or my consciousness, punishing me?

Do you just laugh as I lay here and subside in my mind?
Strip away the flesh of my being 
I will crush the Vatican's emphatic putrid race 

Where is that part of me?
I can't reclaim from the world that took me over
Let me know 
How to let things to 

Is it too hard too see? 
When I'm reaching out for a hand
Let me know how to let you go

Where is that part of me
I can't reclaim from a world that took me over 
Let me know 
How to let things go
When I'm reaching out for your hand
Let me know
How to let you go

I'm not the person you knew, anymore
Finally I have broken,free from your vice
I caged is my mind once again
Who am I anymore? 

I am broken...
