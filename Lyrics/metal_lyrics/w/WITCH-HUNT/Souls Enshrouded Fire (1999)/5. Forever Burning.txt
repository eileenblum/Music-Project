Withered And Falling
Like A Dying Flower,
Life Is Escaping
In My Final Hours.
Why Did It End This Way
So Much That I Had To Say
Our Flesh Is Apart
But We're Bonded By Blood
We Shall Rejoice
Once The Other Side.
The Soul Shall Never Die
A Power Unconfined
A Light Inside The Shell
That Burns Eternal.
