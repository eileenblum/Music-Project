From Above
Seven Trumpets Blow
This World Will Soon See
The End Of Time.
The Seas Filled With Blood
Flames Caress Their Weak
Souls, (they will all die)
They Will All Die
Under A Blood Red Sky
Demons And Angels Collide
To Take Away Their Lives.
There Is No Escape
The Locusts Have Arrived
...This Is The End.
