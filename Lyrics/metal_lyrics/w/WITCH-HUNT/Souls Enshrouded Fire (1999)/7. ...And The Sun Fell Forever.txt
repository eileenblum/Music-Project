There Was A Time
Upon The Skies
The Sun Stood Bright
Behind The Clouds
(Of The Earth)
Darkness Fell
No Sunrise
A Black Horizon
Filled Our Eyes
We've Lost All Hope
In This World Of Sorrow
Never To Behold
The Light Again...
Time Stands Still
When All Has Departed
Winds Iced The Land
And The Sun Fell Forever.
