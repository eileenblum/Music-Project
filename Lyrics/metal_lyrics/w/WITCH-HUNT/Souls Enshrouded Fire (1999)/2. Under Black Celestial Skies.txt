I Await The Winds Of The
End, Depart From Body And
Soul, The Final Release
Welcomes Me, Through
The Clouds Of Infinity.
Entranced By Inner
Tranquillity, Thoughts
Cease To Occur, The Light
Draws Near, Into The
Skies...I Soar.
Reach For The Skies
Toward The Burning
Stars, The Lights Draws
Near, Into The Skies I Soar.
