Warriors Rise Of Flesh, Blood,
And Steel, Under The Sign Of
The Sword We March,
Conquer Mortals Who Once
Stood Tall, Blades Shining
Blood Red, Victims Fall.
We Travel, Begin The Journey
To The Mighty Gates, We Will
Fight Many Battles On The
Way, And Trample The Bodies
Of The Slain.
We Will Shed The Blood Of
Our Enemies, Raise The
Swords In Their Defeat,
Warriors From The Dawn Of
Time, Live By The Sword, And
By That I Will Die.
