Here I stand looking at the sky
It has never been so red before
Here I stand looking at the mountains
They have never been so tall before

Now the road lies ahead
Yes I'm heading on
But don't miss me when I'm gone
I might find what I seek
And one day I might be back

And then I'll save a prayer
That you'll be there
O brothers, you must think that I don't care
Yet you're the only ones I've never had

But you know that I'm a wanderer
I was born to walk alone
And now when spring is here
And in the glow of sun
The rivers flow
I must be gone
