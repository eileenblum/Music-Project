In my dream...
âTwas a cold morning when I saw the first of them
Tiny spots on the horizon
Their wings blackening out the sun
Exodus had begun
Messengers of damnation
And the people cried: âThe birds are leavingâ

Great was the mourning when they were gone
In a bloodred sunset eternal
Through when they were here we never did hear them
sing
Now the silence seemed so infernal and I cried:

Throw a rope to a drowning man
Collect my bones from this dying land
And we'll laugh in the face of horror

Oh, take me higher, away from here
Show me the horizons of my mind
Take my hand and I'll fly with you
Together we will see tomorrow shine
Oh, take me higher, away from here
Show me the horizons of my mind
Take my hand and I'll fly with you
Together we will see tomorrow shine
Together we will see tomorrow shine

âGwaihir! Gwaihir! Hear me calling!â
Lord of the sky, take me high

Sins are but sins
But don't make the birds leave

The land, the sky, the mountains will cry
When they leave, oh, take me with you
The sea, the hills, the forests will sigh
When they abandon ship and fly away
I'll say:

Throw a rope to a drowning man
Collect my bones from this dying land
And we'll laugh in the face of horror

Oh, take me higher, away from here
Show me the horizons of my mind
Take my hand and I'll fly with you
Together we will see tomorrow shine
Oh, take me higher, away from here
Show me the horizons of my mind
Take my hand and I'll fly with you
Together we will see tomorrow shine
Together we will see tomorrow shine
