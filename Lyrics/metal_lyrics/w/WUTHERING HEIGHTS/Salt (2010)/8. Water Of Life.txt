I am no wise man
But I reckon that the Gods of old
Bound the secret fire of life
Inside this dram of gold

Bringing warmth to the cold
Helps a human heart be bold
Keeps me healthy, keeps me young
Animates to love and song

Malt, smoke and peat
The land beneath my feet
Salty sea and open sky
Hear the seagulls cry

Acqua Vitae
Uisge Beatha
Water of Life
