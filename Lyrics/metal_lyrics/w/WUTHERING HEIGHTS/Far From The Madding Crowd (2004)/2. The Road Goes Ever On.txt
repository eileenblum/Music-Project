Now as I'm sitting here
My life passing by
I recall the things I'he done
I watch the sun
But this is not the end
No the end I'll never see
And I'll be moving on

A sunbeam heats my chest; it's time to rise again
The leaves above whisper to me
I feel the land. I feel the air
Blowing through my hair

Now into the down I'm heading again
The hills are calling my name
Like a leaf on the ground I'm blown away
I wasn't born to stay

Living for the roads I see
I'm wild, I'm free
A stranger from the past
But I'm not the last

'Cause the road goes on and on. The road goes on and on
The road goes on and on. The road goes on and on
Don't know if it's a curse or just another kind of blood
But my road goes on and on
Yes the road goes ever on

Now the sun sinks... The air is growing chill
I lie down under just another tree
The last grey daylight dies
Now as I close my eyes

Then the shadows surround me again
The cool wind touches my face
The empty landscape fills my mind
Guess I'm behind my time

And yet I'll always be
Though my time is done
In darkness, in the sun
Travel on

'Cause the road goes on and on; The road goes on and on
The road goes on oand on; The road goes on and on
No I'm not antisocial, I'm of another kind
And my road goes on and on
Yes the road goes ever on

You know me in your dreams
Though you hide it well
I'm who you'd wish you were
The traveller

'Cause the road goes on and on; The road goes on and on
The road goes on oand on; The road goes on and on
I'he lived my life, fulfilled my dreams, I'm not afraid to die
But my road goes on and on
The road goes ever on

The road goes on and on..
