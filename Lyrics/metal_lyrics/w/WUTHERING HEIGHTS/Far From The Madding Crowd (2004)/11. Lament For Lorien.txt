Out of battle I did come
Afraid of darkness, afraid of the sun
The Gods led my feet to the kingdom now gone
Fairest of them all... Fairest of them all

Blessed be the golden wood
Where trees were new that ages stood
For haunted souls and sanctuary true
And fairest of them all... Fairest of them all

O, what joy, what balm for wounds
To stray beneath the stars
Where elvenmaids did dance as light
As leaf on lindentre... Leaf on lindentree

In the mirror I did see
What hunts me in my dreams, brings me to my knees
Would that forever I could hide midst the trees
In Lorien the fair

Could I stay I would never leave
Could I stay I would ever be
In timeless land where shineth no moon
Yet I must leave here soon

O, the burden laid on me
My quest is hard to bear
Succes or failure both shall be
The end of Goldenfair... The end of Goldenfair

I set my sails and leave this world
To me all seemed bare
For neverafter shall I walk
In Lorien the fair... Lorien the fair

A dream now gone, a name in a song
The garden of the Gods, faded and lost
Noone now lingers where mallorn once grew
And my world's fading too

All laurie lantar laassi surinen
