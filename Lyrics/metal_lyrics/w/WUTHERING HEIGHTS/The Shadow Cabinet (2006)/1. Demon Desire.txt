The beast that lurks in my genes
Is controlling my will
In endless search of the ultimate carnal thrill

Like a knight without an armour
I ride out to face the two backed beast
Naked in the face of horror
A jester at this undercover feast

Desire fills my heart with guilt and pain
As my burning blood from my mind is drained

Demon desire; you lead. I drag behind
Demon desire; leave my fragile mind
How can I be at peace
When my blood is on fire
Don't want to be your slave
Demon desire

I can never fight my nature
I am he - the pleasant primitive
Or so the queens of lust they see me
But myself is all I have to give

Desire fills my heart with guilt and pain
As my burning blood from my mind is drained

Demon desire; you lead. I drag behind
Demon desire; leave my fragile mind
How can I be at peace
When my blood is on fire
Don't want to be your slave
Demon desire

Curse this world
That gives urges but no breeding grounds
How shall I see the sun
Behind desire's brooding clouds
I cannot fight my nature
The pleasant primitive
O, let me live...

All my years and all my gold
It takes to ease the demon
All my years and all my gold
To keep the beast at bay

Could I only put away my bow
When no prey in sight
But now I'll leave my mind behind
For another hungry quest into the night

Demon desire; you lead. I drag behind
Demon desire; leave my fragile mind
How can I be at peace
When my blood is on fire
Don't want to be your slave
Demon desire
