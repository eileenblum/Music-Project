They will ask me what am I doing here
My reply will be spit
In their motherfucking faces
Scum bereft of any morality
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you even here?
Burn in Hell!

You can't wash off blood with blood

Filth is poisoning our souls
Pain is the only thing we know
Wanna know why we don't speak?
I'll tell. We're used to it
Wanna know why we don't speak?
I'll tell. We're all in fear

Human is such a meaningful word
And who are you in this polluted world?
What have you done in your dreary past?
That your present is just immoral dust
You pay with blood
For your soul

Standing on your knees
In front of fallen realm
What would you say to my face?
Wouldn't you beg me? Or you pray for mercy?

So much scum
In hell you will be mired
Our souls in pain
You bodies thrown on a funeral pyre

Cleanse your flesh with fire
I am the Messiah

The government knee-deep in corruption
The artists are mired in seduction
People, what have you become?
Listen closer to the earth's weeping
It groans mad, it's in pain
Feel its blood, it's on your hands
Brutes don't deserve forgiveness!

You don't deserve to live
May the plague come to your homes
Your children's death is set in stone
Burn in hell scum you fucking scum
Eat the dirt you fucking pigs

Feel the pain
Ravens will feast
On your fucking guts

So much scum
In hell you will be mired
Our souls in pain
You bodies thrown on a funeral pyre

Try to escape from disaster
