The illusiveness of my existence I see
Every time the reflection by mirror is shown
This world's so fucked up, don't know how to live
All is foregone you can't move by your own

How long are we here and is this all real?
I wish I dropped dead like an autumn leaf

Every fucking day
My soul breaks into pieces
Every fucking day
My boiling blood releases

I'll paint a picture with the blood of my friends
Hoping I'll be able to feel at least a bit of pain

I'll paint a picture with the blood of my friends

I'll paint a picture with the blood of my friends
That won't be touched with fire from my soul
The world is raging in bloody red flames
Who befalls the illusions will fucking rot

In the emptiness of digital world
Something plays us like we're toys
After ourselves we leave just bones
Which chaotic world can not make rot

It's time to step over the board of illusions,
To step into unknown emptiness
Only our hands in blood can light the way
To exit from slumber labyrinth

Burn on flames of pain

I lived in this fucking world of illusions
Seeing the nightmare every day
I'm done shedding blood in this city delusioned
I'm sick of this fucking pain
Get out of my mind, get out of my world,
Make fucking curtains fall

I reached the fragments of sky
In this world of broken reality
Emptiness inside is like mold
It consumes me faster and faster
But I will never go back
Letting the pain be with me
Learn how to feel, the reality
Break the fucking illusion
