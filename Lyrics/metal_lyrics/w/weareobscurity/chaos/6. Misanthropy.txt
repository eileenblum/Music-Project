Society's fucking filth
Is swallowing me whole
Don't you look away scumbags
'Cause I can see your souls
Through all disguise and rags

Society's fucking filth
Is flowing through my veins
Scumbags, where are you off to?
Away from my disdain.
Escape from me is vain

A state of thieving assholes
Dead hookers sprawled in gutters
I owe you sorry fucks nothing
As my life is lying in ashes
With all that I hold dear
I scream in rage and fear

The clergy's corrupt to the bone
Molesting little kids
I'll see you fuckwads in hell
How hot and bright you'll burn
Degenerates born of hate
We're poisoned with
First breaths we take.

I renounce all of you
I distrust those who claim to be friends
In the darkest corner
I'll be waiting for you locked and loaded

We're bogged down
In this crummy broken world
Life is a sick joke
That's played on you
By everyone day after day
Wake the fuck up, take a look
Where are we marching to
In lockstep on this death parade
And I'm a rabid dog
Lurking in the alleyways

I'm so sick of you
Fucking dimwits
Why'd I ever come here
To this traitors' den
No-good cocksuckers
And false friends
You look me in the eyes
And say your empty praise
I know your souls are sold
A sacrifice to mediocrity

When the walls start crumbling down underneath your egos' weight
I will lift my head to the skies and cry out
I've shed the shackles that I hate

Society's fucking filth
Is swallowing me whole
Don't you look away scumbags
'Cause I can see your souls
Through all disguise and rags

Society's fucking filth
Is flowing through my veins
Scumbags, where are you off to?
Away from my disdain.
Escape from me is vain

I damn these lands,
And damn your laws,
Fuck this world
And every one of you
Come judge me, worthless rats

I renounce all of you
I distrust those who claim to be friends
In the darkest corner
I'll be waiting for you I'm locked and loaded

Judge me from the floor choking on your blood
