May the oppressive one know only death and hatred.

Knowledge of life and death lies in your soul
It leaves deep scars on your consciousness
All that's left is to take up arms
And dispense justice soaked with anger and hatred.

My body is pierced with pain
And I can no longer control my fear
I tear off the curtains of faith
To gaze into the eyes of truth
What is hidden behind those masks?
Everyone knows, everyone sees
What stirs us
The true power, the all-binding energy

Only hatred is real
You will see the essence of the universe
Only hatred is real
You will see what your soul hides
Only hatred is real
You will sense their pain
Only hatred is real
You'll wipe dogmas away

The ashes in our palms
Blood soaked through the ground
Gloomy shadows
Fading echoes
It's terrifying to run through the abyss of contempt
I don't want to see judgmental looks
The one who has learned the truth cannot turn back and start over again
Condemn! Destroy!

Now you know
What truth hides
Only hatred is real

Run to my voice through the seas of rage
Take my hand and ascend
