You're real you say
What kind of bullshit is that
We'll be OK
Bound by this treacherous net

Whatever floats your boat
In your shallow boggy moat
That you dug for yourself

Hey there sport
Come on and settle in
This is the hole we tore you from
This is the one we'll bury you in

This is the casket you'll call home
We'll mould and hurt and haunt you

This is the plank you'll wallow on
Alone curled up in angst and torment

There, have some values and taboos
You're saddled now with them for life
Some extra flesh for you to bruise
Remember to recoil and cry
If someone were to ever hurt
Your precious little made-up world

We'll bring our torches blazing bright
And stuff you full of dog-shit dogmas
We will suppress your will to fight
Along with other sinful urges

You're shit
Lie face down and pray
No peeking
Do what we say

You are as good a man as your ability to hide
The real you, and it can never see the light
Of day, 'cause it's a morbid bottomless pit
With just your name cast into it

Ticket for one
To eternal abyss
There I'll find
My promised bliss
Free from judgement
Bereft of conscience
The outness is bleak
Within's my catharsis

Now come back out,
All centered and wise
But something's wrong again
And you realize

Your shelter is crumbling
To a pile of rot
Does the world hate you?
No, it does not

Who the hell do you think you are?
For anyone to love or hate you?
You are a floating piece of space garbage
Damned with consciousness but not for long

Don't you worry, it's not for long

Don't lose your values and taboos
Proudly carry them through life
Some extra flesh for you to bruise
Remember to recoil and cry
If someone were to ever hurt
Your precious little made-up world

We are all lost
You are no exception
Think you're special
That's what makes you
Same as everyone
Else
Don't look for
Revelations
Think you're special
That's a rookie mistake

Same old grudges
Same transgressions
Think you're special
But time just
Runs in circles

Think you're special
Same old grudges
Same transgressions
Think you're special
But time just
Runs in circles
All that changes
Are the faces

Ticket for one
To eternal abyss
There I'll find
My promised bliss

If placidity's what you want
Then get your scalpel and dig deep

Now come back out,
All centered and wise
But something's wrong again
And you realize

Your shelter is crumbling
To a pile of rot
Does the world hate you?
No, it does not

However woke you are
It's no more real
Than the delirium we're all in

Think you're awake now
You woke up to another dream
