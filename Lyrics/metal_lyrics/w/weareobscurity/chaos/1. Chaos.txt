I've seen entire planets scorched
And soldiers' bones reduced to ashes
Armies of thousands spread like mold
Devour empires like a flash of plague

My dreams are filled with pain and fever
Dark gods' beckon it's all that I can hear
Kill! Tear apart! Crush bones!
Give in to the chaos!

I was ripping apart the festering flash with my own hands, mourning for my brothers.
I could barely remember that I'm a human, not a monster.

Dye my hands with the blood of friends
Feast on their pale decaying flesh
Build myself a throne out of their skulls
Torch their homes with kids locked inside

My body became strong
My brain filled with anger
I'm ready to sacrifice my soul to you, the god of violence!
Put in my hand, the power of chaos.
Please direct me to the enemies, oh the almighty!

Bloody threads are weaving fates
Scarlet dawns ignite the worlds
And just like locust swarms
Desolate the lands

Heed me sordid brother
Why do you stand before me?
Don't you know what happens
Every fucking time?
I'm a monster, a butcher
You'll drown in pain
Can't you sense the fear?
Can you hear your cranium cracking?
The flesh peeling from your bones.
So long, you piece o' shit
Done with your sorry ass
You're a useless bygone

I've seen the fear
I've seen the darkness
I've seen the pain
Everything
Will be
Devoured
The chaos
Will come
Join our ranks
Or die!
