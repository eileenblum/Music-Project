SHOVED BACK DOWN IN PLACEÂ 
IF I CAN ESCAPE THERE IS A DEEP SACRIFICEÂ 
REALITYÂ 
ALL OF YOUR PRIMITIVE TOOLS WILL BECOME OBSOLETEÂ 
I FEEL THE PULLING THE TEARING THE GRINDING OF TEETHÂ 
TRAPPED INSIDE WITH NO ESCAPEÂ 
THE CHOKE AND HOLDÂ 
I WILL NEVER FORGETÂ 
AWAKENING TEAR THE VEIL AWAYÂ 
SHOVED BACK DOWN IN PLACE
