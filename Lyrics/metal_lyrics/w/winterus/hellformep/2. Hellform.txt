I SEE AN ALMOST CLEAR ELIXIRÂ 
AROMATIC AS IT VANISHES THROUGH MY BLOODSTREAMÂ 
I FEEL THE COLD VOID WITHIN MEÂ 
FOR THIS GREAT SORROW RUNS THROUGH MY VEINSÂ 
SO FAR GONE THE CYCLE IS PERMANENT INFINITE CONSEQUENCE IN RUINS INDEBTED
TO FAILUREÂ 
BROTHERHOOD THE BRAVE DARK CIRCLEÂ 
THE HAND IN ALL WE ARE FORGED INTO THE EARTHÂ 
A TOMB OUR BURIAL CHAMBERÂ 
A MOUNTAIN AMONG THE MOUNTAINSÂ 
IN OUR COSMIC ARRANGEMENT
