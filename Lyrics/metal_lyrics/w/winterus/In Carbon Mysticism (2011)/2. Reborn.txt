Immaculate conception
I am rotting away, I am nothing...

A hypnotic and devoid human
Filled with hollow and festering echoes.

I can end this one way,  it's drilling in my brain.

I'll become stronger when my soul is vacuumed towards the sky.
It will end all, and I will feel whole again. I will become stronger.

Lost... Fallen...

Now you wonder what time you have left, while I'm starting to grow.
I will summon the worst that I can and blow you all to Hell.
