I'm longing for winter's chill...
For the numbing air to burn my veins frozen.

I am the saddest one...
I am the deserted one...

Not a soul is wandering because you feel no warmth,
No journey to the farthest reaches could make time change.

Make time change...

When I am called the darkness my cradle,
I am drunk with heavy footsteps and my mind becomes slave.

I was told that every day would be my last.
