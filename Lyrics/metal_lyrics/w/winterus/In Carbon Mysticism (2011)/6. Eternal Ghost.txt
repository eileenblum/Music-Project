Shredded, tore open... A tragedy was this man
They assume that I grew selfish, I reply I know I am. 

What time you have wasted to consider why
All the time you have wasted it's time to decide. 

When there is so much to divide, counter-balance, separate and diffuse. 

My thought will pass you by. 

It will be easier to forget what happiness I barely offer any of you. 

Here flows my blood on these last few moments of my life. 

Before the stone, confide in this hole. 
Seven years rotting, died for sins of my blood. 
Betrayed by the flesh, the blood and the skin. 

Waiting for that soft rush of blood to fill her in this, my last torment.
