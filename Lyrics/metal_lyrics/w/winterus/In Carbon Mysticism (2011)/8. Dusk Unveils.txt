Lost, trying to find a way home.
Darkness... this will soon be the last of our sanctuary.
The tyrant, the true nature of us is born.

We will never know when we'll return.
If we'll be victorious...

If we'll be dead or alive.

What has become of my life?
My fate is sealed forever.

A crimson outline burns across my neck..
Perhaps in death I will truly rest once and for all.

Like a sunset I'll be easily missed.
You can not see me because I am nothing.

My immortal grave.
