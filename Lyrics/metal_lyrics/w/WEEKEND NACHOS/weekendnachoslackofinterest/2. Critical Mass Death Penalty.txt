[performed by Weekend Nachos]Big city, anarchist scum
inconvenience everyone
Streets are for cars, you know damn well
You &amp; your bike should burn in Hell
Rich kid won't purchase gasoline
This ain't fucking Portland
The ambulance can't get to the hospital
I'll take a U-lock to your fucking skull
A parade of fools who won't face reality
A cheap way to rebel against society
White-bred spoon-fed fucks
Live a day in the real world
Till then shut your fucking mouth
You &amp; your bike should burn in Hell
