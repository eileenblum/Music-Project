[performed by Weekend Nachos]Energy lost, madness drained
I have caused so much pain
Many screamed I have swallowed
My heart is cold &amp; hollow
Won't stop until the world knows fear
Earth resentment, you put me here
So many destroyed, they failed every test
Lose my mind again, finish of the rest of God
I fucking hate everyone
