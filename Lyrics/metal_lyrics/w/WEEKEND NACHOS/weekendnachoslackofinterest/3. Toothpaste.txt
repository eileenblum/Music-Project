[performed by Weekend Nachos]Day by day, tooth decay
One of these days I'll fucking pay
When my teeth start to rot I'll face up to the truth
I should have listened to crucial youth
My mouth is destructing, I'm dooming myself
This irresponsibility, this daily neglect
Toothpaste is all that it may take to save the day
One of these days I'll fucking pay
