[performed by Weekend Nachos]A bunch of fucks ruined my fun
Joined the brawl, 10 on 1
Are we a positive scene, I'm still not sure
Are we growing stronger or moving backwards
Moving backwards
Violent dancing turns into a fight
Your friends jump in &amp; fuck up the night
Are we a community or just a bunch of dicks
Neanderthal behavior making me sick
Moving backwards
Not here to fight or spill some blood
Get out if that's what you call fun
