[performed by Weekend Nachos]Why should any of us care about you
All you're looking for is the green room
Rock star attitudes, entitled pricks
No one's going to suck your dick
You must be living a fantasy
This basement ain't no fancy dream
You're looking for your deli tray
It's time for you to go away
