I don't care about any of you
&amp; I'm getting fucking bored
30 dumbfucks in a basement
Setting out to change the world
Preaching to the fucking choir
Fighting nothing but my ears
Empty slogans &amp; singsongs
Your words are worthless than your beer

I hate your fucking lyrics they say nothing to me at all
Except you lean more to the left I'll smash your face against the wall
If you think that's all it takes then you better think again
No one overseas gives a fuck that you're impressing your friends

None of you are changing a Goddamn thing
Fuck you
