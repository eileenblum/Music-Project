You need a bigger club
You need that guarantee
All I give a shit about are the fucked up kids who relate to me
Your scene is accepted
Your scene's filled with pretty boys
But around here we're all ugly
&amp; we don't care if you hear our voice

Nothing that you do means a fucking thing to us
Cause you're not apart of what we do
So don't pretend to give a fuck

You need to fucking die like your peers on MTV
Cause an army of rockstar hipsters are the last thing that we need
Go fuck yourselves
Get the fuck out of our scene
Fuck your agent &amp; your street team
&amp; everything in between

Record sales &amp; chicks
Are there reason that you're here
But you'll never know real pain, mistrust, abandonment &amp; fear
&amp; we will kill you if you come near
