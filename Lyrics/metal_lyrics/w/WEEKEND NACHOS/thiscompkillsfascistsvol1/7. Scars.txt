I can never go back to that miserable place
Halls of misery where I couldn't show my face
The wounds open up every now &amp; then
Destroy your sick world again &amp; again

Never
Escape from the past
Memories
That will always last

Wounds that will never heal
You don't know how I feel

Humiliation scars
