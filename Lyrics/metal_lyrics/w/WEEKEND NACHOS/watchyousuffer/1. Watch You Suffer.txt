Life's gotten so tough,
You're not strong enough.

Watch you suffer [x3]
I just can't watch you suffer.

We've both been through a lot,
I'm able to cope but you're not.

Watch you suffer [x3]
I just can't watch you suffer.

You walk away with self-decay,
Your world is hurting, wasting away.
I can't sit back and watch you suffer,
I need to step in, can't lose another.
