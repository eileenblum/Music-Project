Stories and laughing, parties and drugs.
Drinking and dancing, smiles and hugs.

You're all out tonight.
You're all feeling alright.
I'm miserable with nothing to do.
Well I'm going out tonight too.

Bomb your fucking bars and
destroy your worthless friends.

Tonight I'm going to kill somebody.
Maybe tonight I'll be somebody.
I dropped out of life when I couldn't cope,
I don't want to belong, I have no hope.

That life of yours.

I'm ending it tonight.
