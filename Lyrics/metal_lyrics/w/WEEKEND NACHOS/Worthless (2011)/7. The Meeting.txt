you thought I needed to feel more pain took advantage of everything left me dead at your front door heartless fucking dirty whore I turned my back on my best men ignored advice from caring friends all for someone I thought was real a person trained to lie and steal when we meet again I hope youre still the same when we meet again ill still remember your name when we meet again ill stare at you for a while when we meet again you'll wonder why I still smile your eyes were cold the whole time you had no soul so you took mine
