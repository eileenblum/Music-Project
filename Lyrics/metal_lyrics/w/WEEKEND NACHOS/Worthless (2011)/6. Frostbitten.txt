seasonal hatred no air to breathe my bodys cold lungs are frozen my lifes on hold buried deep in snow beaten down by an ice storm my blood stops running but no heart attack this nightmare ends but it always comes back my veins snap in half skin dries out cracked and bleeding bitten by the wind hands are burning with pain I live in frozen hell frostbitten
