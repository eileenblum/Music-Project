you know, i think its fucking great when you're in the ER after breaking your face you'll go in the pit to push everyone around and i won't help you up when you hit the ground the problem's not violence the problem is you a dumb jock loser with everything to prove i love it when you get hurt it makes me feel good to see you hurt dancing hard is all you're good for casualty of the core
