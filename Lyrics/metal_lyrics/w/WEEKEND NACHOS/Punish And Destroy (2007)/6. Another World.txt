LOOK IN MY EYES and who do you see? that's right you don't know me neither do my friends, work, or family strange enough, that's how i'd rather it be each day more alone and unknown makes most sense to me don't need to change the world this place is not my home you're all so fucking dead to me in my own world i roam so many morbid thoughts i'll never know why i know i want to live but i want you all to die
