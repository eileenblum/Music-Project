don't get me wrong, some words rub me the wrong way but is it really your right to tell me what i can't say? there are so many times when you could turn the other cheek but instead i think that dram is all that you seek i'm more or less offended by the air that you breathe, cuz you act like you're so much better then everyone including me give it a rest, i don't want to hear you whine don't need the p.c. police on my ass, cuz i'm doing fine without your guidance
