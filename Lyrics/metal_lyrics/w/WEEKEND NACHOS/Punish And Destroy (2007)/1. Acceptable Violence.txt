we kept to ourselves, we left you alone you turned the screws, now we're on our own we can't go for help, we can't get support no one understands the meaning of our war the strong eat the weak, society shuts its eyes the people in power are destroying us all from the cops on the streets to the jocks at the mall this suffering and this pain can be reversed we have the power to turn around this curse fuck pacifism, we've tried that before it's time to fight back, it's time to wage war ACCEPTABLE VIOLENCE
