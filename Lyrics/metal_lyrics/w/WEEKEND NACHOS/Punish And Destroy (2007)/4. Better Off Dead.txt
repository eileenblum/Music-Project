congratulations, you're a fucking clone you all look the same and it doesn't look good i don't think you're pretty, i don't think you're cute when you open your mouth i want to put you on mute starvation and diets are what you condone tanning salons are your second home a pound of make-up to hide your ugly face a strain on my eyes, a human disgrace ugly on the inside makes you ugly on the outside the truth is... you'd look a lot better hacked to chunks in a dumpster better off dead
