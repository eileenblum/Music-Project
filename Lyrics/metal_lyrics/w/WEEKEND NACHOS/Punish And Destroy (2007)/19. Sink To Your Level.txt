never been the violent type but the desire's always been there i've been trained to walk away from your shit but just once i'd love to shed some blood 23 years of avoiding a fight but i've always wanted to injure you be the reason for your pain and discomfort sink to you level and smile while you suffer afraid to end your life because of jail time i've gotta break free and take back what's mien ring your fucking neck for what you're done to me choke the life out of you till you can't fucking breathe
