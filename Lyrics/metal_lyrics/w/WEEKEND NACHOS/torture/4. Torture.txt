existing as a lab rat for the pleasure of the world, to damage and to break until i can't take any more, love, trust, and friendship dangled in my face, without any hope of ever getting a taste, tortured forever, the reason i'm here, tortured forever, but i won't live in fear to the world and all you've done to me, fuck off and die
