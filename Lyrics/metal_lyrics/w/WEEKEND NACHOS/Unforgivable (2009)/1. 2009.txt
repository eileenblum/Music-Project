Negativity lives and breathes inside of me
It's worthless to think that I'll ever be free
Fuck you
My hate for this world is more than I can take
If you say that you love me, I'll say that you're fake
No one is listening and no one fucking cares
Life is disgusting and nothing is fair
I can't even stand to look you in the eye
You want me to smile, I want you die
You don't have scars and you don't know pain
Violent thoughts are what's left in my brain
Negativity is all that remains.
