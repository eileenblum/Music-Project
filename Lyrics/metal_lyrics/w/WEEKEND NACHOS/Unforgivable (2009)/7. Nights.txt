Night after night,
I've lost the fight
Are these walls my friends?
This will never end
The isolation feels right but it doesn't feel nice
Infinite amounts of time to dwell on my past
I don't hate you, I only hate myself
So I lose all hope and forget all my dreams
As I stare at a window,
I am afraid to look out
Unable to move
And I know in my head
I will not survive this tonight
Can't take another day
I will not make it through the night
Will I ever know what's out there?
I think I'd rather be dead than step outside
There's a reason I'm behind bars
Your world means nothing to me
I know where I belong
That's where I'm gonna stay.
