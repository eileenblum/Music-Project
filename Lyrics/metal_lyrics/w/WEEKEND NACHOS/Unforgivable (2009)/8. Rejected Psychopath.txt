You're walking home,
I'm right behind
I'll follow you to Hell
Time turns love into fear
You never knew me very well
I've got eyes everywhere
Watching your every move
You can't get away with this
I am following you
You let me in, but you pushed me out
I'm not leaving, it's too late
With a knife in one hand and two eyes full of hate
You're fucking dead
You'll never escape
You'll never escape this
You'll never escape me.
