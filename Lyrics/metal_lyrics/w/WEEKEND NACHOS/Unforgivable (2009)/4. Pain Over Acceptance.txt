I'd rather be abused and mocked by your world
Than walk amongst vultures, parasites, and whores
I'll live through your shit and never look you in the eye
Reject what you offer me till the day that I die
Won't conform to your standards
There's got to be another way
I'll take pain over acceptance any day.
