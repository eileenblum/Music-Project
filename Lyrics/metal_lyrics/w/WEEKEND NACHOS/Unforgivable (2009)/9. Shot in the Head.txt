You're on stage, you're having fun
You've got fans, you think you've won
I'm not jealous, I'm fucking disgusted
Your attitude cannot be trusted
17 years old and on top of the world
A loser one minute, next you're shitting gold
You're a product of the message board hype machine
You're a flavor of the week in a retarded scene
Shoot you in the head at your sold out show
Shoot you in the head and the scene will know
That you live and you breathe just like everyone else, motherfucker
Shot in the fucking head
