The minute you're born, you start to feel pain
You enter an ugly world and you go insane
It's the meaning of life
It's a reason to die
From morning to night, experiencing shame
Avoiding new enemies, but playing their games
It's breeding inside and there's nowhere to hide
It's time to give up
It's time to disappear
I don't belong here
There's no one to love
There's nothing left inside
No life left
This is where I stay face down
This is where I don't wake up
This is where I die
