You look at your life, as I look at mine
Optimism is poison
Can't choke on false hope
Expect the worst or die naive
Because I refuse to believe
that this world is on my side
You are the reason I suffer
Your laughter is tearing my ears off
Good times are taken from me
Your smile is burning my eyes out
I find discomfort in a world
where you reign supreme
As I sit here alone
looking down at the blackened sky
Your positivity makes my stomach turn
When Hell is on Earth, you'll be the first to burn
I don't want you to ever learn
because I want you to be the first to burn
