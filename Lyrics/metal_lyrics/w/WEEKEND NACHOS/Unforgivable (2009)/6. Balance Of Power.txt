If I were in control, you'd all get in a line and I'd cut off your heads on at a time
You mother fuckers would cry and then you would die
Climb the mountain, slowly you arrive
You know your own fate
It's too late to survive because what's done is done
It's too late to run
You would finally see what you had done to me
The pain and terror I've faced since I was old enough to be
But it would be too late for an apology
I want you all to feel as dead as me.
