No punishment could justify the filth you create
Your existence alone spawns a lifetime of hate
You cheat, you steal, you're what I despise
You judge and you profit on nothing buy lies
The unholy unite for a violent revolution
Destroying the church is the only solution
As priests and nuns are burned at the stake
This is the end of your religion
This is the end of your faith.
