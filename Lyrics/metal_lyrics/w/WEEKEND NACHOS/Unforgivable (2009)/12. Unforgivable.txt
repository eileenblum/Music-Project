What the fuck do I owe this world besides misery and pain?
I've died a lonely death on this soil
All that's left are my bloodstains
I observe human life
Nothing seems more absurd
The only solution is death
Make everybody hurt
Burn for every breath
Suffer for every sound
A species unworthy of life
A society gone wrong
Nothing brings out more hate in me than sharing life with another human being
I can no longer deny I am everything I despise
Relieve the world of its cries
This unforgivable existence must die.
