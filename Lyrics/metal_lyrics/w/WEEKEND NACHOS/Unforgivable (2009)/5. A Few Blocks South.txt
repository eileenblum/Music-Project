Being with you is wrong, and it's taken too long for me to realize why I've been telling myself lies
Your beauty is unmatched but you're different inside
There's a reason you and your pretty little friends stay away from my kind
I've wandered past enemy lines
I don't belong on your side
It's time for me to say goodbye
Now you're the one who gets denied.
