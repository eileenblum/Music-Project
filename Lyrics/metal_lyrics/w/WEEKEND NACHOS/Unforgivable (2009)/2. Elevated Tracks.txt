My inner demons are set free
Crowded bodies close to me
Bloody fantasies inside my head
Praying that we'll soon be dead
No words could describe how I feel in this place
Staring at everyone's miserable face
This world is my enemy, I have no friends
I'm waiting for the day when it comes to an end
