My dear friends, our time is done
Time to move on, did we have our fun?
Wasted years, so much bullshit
Stole so much from me, it's sick
I don't believe in friendship
You'll never know me, I'll see to it
Smile and nod and part ways
Nothing left to fucking say
What we've been through I'll soon forget
Every minute I gave you I regret
Our time ends, goodbye, die
Rid the world of our charade
Won't be missed, whither and fade
No more memories of better days
