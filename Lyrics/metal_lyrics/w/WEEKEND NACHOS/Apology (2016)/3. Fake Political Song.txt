Dictators coming back
System's the same, they never left
We the people, civilized
Change our ways or we all die
Get your gun and start to believe
Lose our allies, nation's weak
End the rich's winning streak
Bloody martyr fantasy
I don't care, it starts with me
Build a bomb and start to attack
Time to die, you're fucking next
Sick of waiting for the rest
Man made army killing scum
How the fuck do you think real shit gets done?
No more voting, take by force
Democracy, that doesn't work
I won't stop until all the politicians are hurt
A violent overthrow of government is necessary
