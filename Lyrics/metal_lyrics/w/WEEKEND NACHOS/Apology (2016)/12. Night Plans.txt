Pick you up tonight at 8
Take you out, a nice date
Steak for dinner, then stay late
At first sight I knew your fate
Stare into your kind eyes
You trust me, I don't know why
My intentions you can't see
I'm alone, do you love me?
Locked inside, could not hide
Knife comes down, made no sound
Throw you out like today's trash
It's not your fault my mind's a mess
I make choices beyond the grave
You and I both can't be saved
It's me who feels the most pain
As your blood and skin sink down the drain
I hate the whole human race
This is how I survive but I'm dead inside
Lifeless hag, body bag
Chopped off head, beautiful dead
Where I'm headed there's no fresh air
My kind thrives below and I'm going there
