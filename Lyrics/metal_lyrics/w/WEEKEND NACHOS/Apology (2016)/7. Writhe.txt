Garbage, sewage, shoved down my throat
At my own free will
Rejected scum, regurgitate
And release this waste
Self-inflicted sickness
Tears up my gut
Writing in pain until this life is done
I don't know where I went wrong
I'm a stain, I won't last long
13 years of punishment
Much deserved torture
I know I'll never fucking learn
Insides poisoned with my mistakes
In this dark alley, dry heaves and shakes
I writhe in pain
