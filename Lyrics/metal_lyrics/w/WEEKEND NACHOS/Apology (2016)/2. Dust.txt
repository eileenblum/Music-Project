[feat. Dylan Walker]They set the fire but we watched it burn
Misguided youth, you fell hard
Got mixed up with the wrong crowd
Tried to take hate to the lower depths
To think for yourself, you'd rather die
And outside your hole, you'd never survive
You belong to a family, it's all a lie
Meanest and toughest guys around
Kicking me on the ground
What's a man without his friends?
Nothing but dust
Lost your sense of care and all your feeling
No longer a decent human being
It's sad to see a kind man turn to stone

[Dylan Walker]
Foot soldiers all across the nation
Violence, power and manipulation
But we can just close our eyes and hide

Respect and fear are the same
It's their world, play their game
What's a man without his friends?
Nothing but dust
Nothing to us
