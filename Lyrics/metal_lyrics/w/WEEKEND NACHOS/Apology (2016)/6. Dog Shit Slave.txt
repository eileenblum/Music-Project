Business ruins and poisons your minds
American dream is controlling your lives
I can't stomach this fucking bullshit
Step on their necks just to make a profit
Count me out
Pathetic slave, such a shame
Losing someone else's game
Join the herd, wannabe
You're just dog shit, can't you see?
It's not just a living, it's fire in your eyes
Threw out your passion for a sketchy disguise
No more substance, no longer pure
Lost your fucking mind, dollar's the cure
Count me out
Living false, slitting throats, how do you fucking sleep?
Where's your loyalty to everything you used to believe?
Let it die, let this system unravel itself
Let it burn, wealth and power are not my concern
