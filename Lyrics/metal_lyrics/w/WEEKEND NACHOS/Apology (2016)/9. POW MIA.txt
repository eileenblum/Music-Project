Bottled up, ignored
Couldn't face, suffering
Prepared to die
Refused to live
For you and for me
A shell of a man never to be found
No one who loves me will see me around
Do you know what it's like to disappear?
Do you know what it's like to live in fear?
Vanished without a trace
Can't recognize my face
Erased
I never wanted this
