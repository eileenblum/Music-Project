Look over my shoulder
Follow me around
You're an informant
Kill yourself now
Pretend you're my friend
Judge behind my back
You think I don't know
It's about time you listen
You're a fucking traitor
You are the system
Gossiping always
I know where you're at
Fucking narc
Time to rid the world of the silent snitch
Whose side are you on, you fucking bitch?
You're a fucking narc
I must end you before you end me
