Tragic cries ring throughout the world
Are we all in this together, or are we at war?
We have all lost and we have all burned
I don't know who you are or what you've been through
But different stories speak of times that are true
We have all lost and we have all burned
The selfish stay on their own ground
The righteous keep their eyes all around
Will you help a fellow man in need
Or will you reek of apathy and greed?
We have all lost and we have all burned
When will humanity ever learn?
No place for those who only self serve
No time to make claims about what is deserved
We have all lost and we have all burned
