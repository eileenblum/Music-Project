Worldwide destruction
Powers you cannot comprehend
Who can you save?
Not the animals or the humans you love
It's all coming down
Smashed bones, shattered fangs
Broken spines, bleeding limbs
World genocide
Nothing left to cherish at all
Fires spreading across the land
You know it's time for us to fall
Melted claws, burning hair
Torched skulls
World genocide and no one fucking cares
Who are you, what do you stand for?
Taking your last breath
What did you live for?
Die with regret or with a clear head
It never meant this, this is the end
