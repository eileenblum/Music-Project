I wish you knew just how much
I don't fucking care who you are
Or how you identify
You're no different or better than me
And it'd mean everything 
If you'd shut the fuck up
Or slit your own goddamned throat
Sick of hearing about your struggle
Sick of dealing with your cries
You're always fucking talking
But when are you fucking listening?
Let me be the first to admit
I truly don't fucking care
I live my own life
And I care for those who earn it
I don't fucking care
You're a selfish, entitled, scumbag prick
And you're the one judging me
Fuck you
