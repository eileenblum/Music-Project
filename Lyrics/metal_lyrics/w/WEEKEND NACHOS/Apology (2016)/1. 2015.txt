I've been down the road of trust
I know exactly where it ends
It's in our nature to ruin souls
Bleed out your heart before it grows
Look into another person's eyes
Pledge allegiance until someone dies
You will end up confused, broken and buried
Left with stains, headed back into darkness
Back into darkness
Life plays tricks, you think you're alive
Like a knife in your back, you're burned by lies
For longer than I realized, I failed and I fell
I know some day I will see you in Hell
Back into darkness
I fell back into darkness
Bled me dry
