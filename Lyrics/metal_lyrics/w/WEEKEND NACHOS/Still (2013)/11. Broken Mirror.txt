Going somewhere, headed nowhere
Walking blindly to my grave
Wasted breath and cancelled time
I used to think the world was mine
Looked at myself, smashed the mirror again
Great opportunities I just fucked
Seven more years of bad luck
Fuck this
Every time I see my face
Why can't this be erased?
Smashed this mirror with my fist
Bloodied knuckles and a broken wrist
Fuck this
You think it gets better
I know it doesn't
Give me back what I once had
Take me back.
