Everything I ever believed was wrong
The beginning was the end all along
Another minute becomes a day
Another layer of skin evaporates
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND MY WAY
Time has only done me harm
All grown up, lost my charm
Living and dying become the same
Wasting my life, watching it fade
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND MY WAY
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
WHERE DID I GO?
AM I HEADED DEEPER DOWN A HOLE?
WILL I EVER MAKE IT HOME?
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND MY WAY.
