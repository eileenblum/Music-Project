Point your finger, I'm to blame
I've been sucked into your game
All of your problems are
Someone else's fault
Accuse my friends of what you want
All for just a publicity stunt
Solve the world's problems
With verbal assault
I'm sympathetic to why you're upset
But I don't need to live in fear of regret
I make my choices
They don't revolve around you
Don't fucking concern yourself with what I say or do
The real oppressor is you, It's true
Fight me with what you've got
I'm the enemy with my own thoughts
You hate a world that won't
look your way
There's nothing to hear when there's
nothing to say
GO AWAY.
LOOK AT YOURSELF, FOCUS ON YOU
DON'T FUCKING TELL US WHAT TO DO
OR I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU.
