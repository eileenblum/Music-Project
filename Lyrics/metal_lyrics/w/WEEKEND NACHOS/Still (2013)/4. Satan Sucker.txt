Set the template, set the standard
Show me how it's really done
I need rules, I need guidance
Show me the ways, O evil one
So mysterious but you're in disguise
Black cloak hides your bright blue eyes
Scowl at god, you're almost there
Piss on Christians everywhere
Worship dark lord, cross upside down
Satan Sucker, you're from hell
Burnt down churches, bleeding virgins
Satan Sucker, I know you well
Behind the mask, a white knight lies
Real evil comes, a white knight cries
DIES.
