Spouting off bullshit, angry and wild
YOU'RE NOT PUNK
Yelling in my face, close minded child
YOU'RE NOT FUCKING PUNK
Take off your jacket, show me what's there.
Give me a reason you actually care
Stop talking shit and come out to a show
What's your motivation? I already know
It's the uniform and your reputation
We all hear you, It doesn't mean SHIT
YOU'RE NOT PUNK
You live for others
I live for myself
Been doing it longer
You'll die like the rest.
