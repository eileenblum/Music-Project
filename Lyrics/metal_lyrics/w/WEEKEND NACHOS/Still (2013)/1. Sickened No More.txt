All my life I've seen the pain
There's only one way to escape
I'm giving up, this was always my fate
I LOOK UP AS THE CEILING FADES
Can't watch another man decay
Won't witness it another day
Violence surrounds and consumes
My mind has no more room
SICKENED NO MORE
Murder and rape, common news
Our kids committing the crimes too
Society got the best of me
There's only one way to be free
SICKENED NO MORE
I know I've officially lost this war
But now I will be sickened no more
Lights are out, I've locked the door
But now I will be sickened no more.
