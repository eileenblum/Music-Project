I like to go on walks late at night
I've got a cold dead look in my eyes
It's not a pretty sight
My escape from the world and from you
No one out here is telling me what to do
LATE NIGHT WALKS, LATE NIGHT THOUGHTS
LATE NIGHT PAIN, LATE NIGHT SHAME
It's dark and raining, no idea where I'll go
I do this all the time, I wander, I roam
Is someone dangerous out here
that I can't see?
I don't give a fuck what happens to me
LATE NIGHT WALKS, LATE NIGHT THOUGHTS
LATE NIGHT PAIN, LATE NIGHT SHAME
I'm out here with the vultures
Let them prey, let them feast
I don't give a fuck if they take me
LATE NIGHT WALKS, LATE NIGHT THOUGHTS
LATE NIGHT PAIN, LATE NIGHT SHAME.
