I IGNORE YOU.
Fuck me over, fool the others
You're still around, you still exist
Every fucking day I know it
So I try my best to ignore you
I IGNORE YOU.
Your face appears again and again
It never fails to disgust me
There's only one other thing I can do
So I just try to ignore you
I IGNORE YOU.
KILL.
IGNORE.
