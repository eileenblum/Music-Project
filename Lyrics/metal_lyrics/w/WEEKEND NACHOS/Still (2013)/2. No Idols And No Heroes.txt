I used to think that there were
those to admire
To look up to and to worship
to feel inspired
Now I know
Now I fucking know
There are no idols and no heroes
Fuck their egos
You can go through life pleasing them
It won't fucking matter
To them in the end
Respect yourself more
Than anyone else can
In this life, worship no man
You exist today so I can still be a fan
You never gave a shit, not now, not then
It broke my heart when I realised
Your respect for me was all a lie
A lie
NO IDOLS AND NO HEROES.
