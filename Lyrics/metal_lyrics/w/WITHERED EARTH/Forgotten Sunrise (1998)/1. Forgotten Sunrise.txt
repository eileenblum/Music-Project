[PROLOGUE]

By the last Caress of light
I wander threw shattered Horizons
Far below the scorched land
Whilst a new dawn overcomes
Engulfing the fainted stars

[THE ASTRAL DREAD]

As twilight unfurled its lament
To those of the wailing cosmos
Castaway from mourning ordained
Vast oceans in dominant spoil

[RETRIBUTION]

He destined his peoples tragedy
At the claws of the heathens befoul
Overshadows the brightest star
Desolation is the wielder of might

[TORMENTATION]

In a shower of gold we fall
With an illusion of crumbling galaxies
I shant not pity the heavens
For they shant not pity me...
