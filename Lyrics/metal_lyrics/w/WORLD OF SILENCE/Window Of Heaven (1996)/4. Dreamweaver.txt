[Lyrics: Dablqvist]

The last step taken
To enter the void
The emptiness in between
Start to fade away
Into the unknown
A landscape yet unseen

I lie, Iâll sleep
I meet the weaver of dreams
I fall, beneath
I meet the weaver of dreams

An image of memories
Float before my eyes
A flash then descending light
What I try to accomplish
I cannot fulfill
A blessing in disguise

I lie, Iâll sleep
I meet the weaver of dreams
I fall, beneath
Iâve never fallen before
The end, complete
I meet the weaver of dreams

I tried to see what I wanted to see
The things that came out of reality
I lose the handles, I let all systems go
Iâm waking up but thereâs no
Easy way out if this hell that Iâm in
