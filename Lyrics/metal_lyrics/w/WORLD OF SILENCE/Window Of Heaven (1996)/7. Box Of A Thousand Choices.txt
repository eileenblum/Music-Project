[Lyrics: Sandquist]

Couldnât conquer, a lifelong ignorance
Couldnât conquer, in a worldwide spectrum
Deny me my life, deny me all my presence
You lead me to temptation instead of guiding me to sleep

The voice inside grows stronger
As human limits face away
As long as the abstract hymen stays unbroken
Theyâre locked up in chains
Inside a box of a thousand choices

How can you earn my trust
When you wish me to fail all the way
How to live without changes
Without lifting that stone of your chest
Time to listen and to realize
It could be sailed forever
And future falls apart
Before itâs even started

Open-minded, now and then
Increased my belief in the gift
A letter from her, the firstborn
Gave me life and a glimpse of a beautiful future
