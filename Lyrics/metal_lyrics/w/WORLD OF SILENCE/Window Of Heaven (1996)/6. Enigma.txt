[Lyrics: Dablqvist]

The sands of time keep running
Through the desert land
Forsaken by so many
To rest among the damned

So many years theyâve wondered
What it turned out to be
A tool for mankindâs hatred
An interpreter of dreams

Saved by an imaginary miracle
Losing track of time
Wishful thinking fills my mind
Enslaved by the hand
That rules the universe
A savior of the sea
Another just like me

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Spoken word of truth
Spoken for the believer
The lonely child within
The lonely child within

Done is done, canât be undone
In the time of angels
Starvation or salvation
Self-destructionâs overdue
Faith in what they cannot see
Shapes their imagination
Their belief in things that cannot be
Allows them to ignore reality
