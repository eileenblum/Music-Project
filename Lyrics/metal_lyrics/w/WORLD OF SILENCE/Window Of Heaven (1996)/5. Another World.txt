[Lyrics: Heder]

The captures animal, the unborn child
Living in an unknown world
An ocean pictures at a distance
Their own world is all they know
Captures by whatâs beyond their horizons
Prisoners of their minds
Lack of knowledge makes them believe
Things should be as they are

They live in a world of silence
Surrounded by whatâs called universe
Everythingâs alright, someone said
No guarantee, just believe in me
Remember the time when it all began
A quiet moment of passion
Far away beyond imagination
A link to higher world, no fear

Youâre afraid of what will come
You canât handle the truth
You donât know the power of your mind
Ride on the wind out of this
If you donât break the limits and step out
Youâll never know anything but this
You say youâre satisfied and thatâs alright
But from where I stand, itâs all a lie

You asked yourself how you wanted to live
Then you closed the door to your life
Didnât asked the world what it thought
About shutting both sides out
Youâre the one who knows why youâre there
And why youâll stay forever

There are so many details on the surface
They canât be seen, they canât be traced
The waves behave like scared animals
The fear will change them, forever
All this is equal to the human soul
Two waves encounter without meaning
Their paths cross, the separates
The afterglow will always remain
