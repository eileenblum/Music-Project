[Lyrics: Heder/Dablqvist/Sandquist]

Another day, another week
A silent breeze awakes my mind
Fate has once more shown its mastery
I know, but does she care?
Future is in control of today
What future am I in control of?

Another month, another year
Gaining your strength from an unknown source
Command yourself with hatred
The silent man beholds this face
Another breath, another sigh
Searching gives no hope
Another truth, another lie
Faces seem to fade

Synchronized with the outside world
But still helplessly drying out
In a moment of trust and despair
The opportunity lies right ahead

The final solution slowly closes in
The reflection shows nothing but the eye
Radical difference, complete confusion
Fire interferes with ice
The master key will finally open the skies
