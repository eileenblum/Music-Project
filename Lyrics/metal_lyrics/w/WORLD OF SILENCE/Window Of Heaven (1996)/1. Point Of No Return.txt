[Lyrics: Dablqvist]

Restlessly searching for eternity
An eternity not to be found
As soon as the pages will turn
The image will begin to fade
Iâm drowning in a river of lies
Who am I to believe in victory?
After years of patient waiting
I fall asleep no to wake again

Raging through the winter storms
A heart filled with despair
I rise to race my final quest
With powers unknown to me
Challenging my only faith
Questioning the feelings I have left
This is the final time of action
This is the point of no return

Between nothingness and eternity
I see the point of no return
In an unconscious state of mind
I reach the point of no return

Watching the face of the earth
Through the window of heaven
I want to scream in agony
But my voice cannot be heard
Within the eye of the beholder
Lies the truth that canât be told
Beyond the clouded skies of white
Lies the point of no return

Torn away from what used to be
Determined to be the one to achieve
Enchantment by the way of reality
How everything can turn to stone
What I did and what Iâm doing
Is as different as night and day
The only thing I see, which is certain
Is the point of no return
