[Lyrics: Dablqvist]

As long time passes
A blackened shadow rise
In a broken world
In remembrance of the past
Reflection of remains
Seems unknown to creation
Segregation of few
Fills the lines of many

The silence that surrounds
Keeps them all awake
In this time of resurrection
Itâs all a give-and-take
Theyâre trying to believe
That true words are spoken
Those spoken words
Itâs hard to believe

The strength of thousands, still hold the eruption
In a world, reflected by the mirrors of contempt
Along the visual path, lies an isle of disbelief
In a world reflected by the mirrors of contempt

Can you see your own reflection
In the corner of your eye?
A shade of painted pictures
All just floating by
With forbidden eyes to see
Whatâs going on inside?
A ship is built of hope
Built to carry lies

As only light of day is present
In the world, reflected by the mirrors of contempt
Minutes turn to hours, hours into days
In the world, reflected by the mirrors of contempt
