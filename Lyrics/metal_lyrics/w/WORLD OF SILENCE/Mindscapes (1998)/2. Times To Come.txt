[Lyrics: Mikael Dahlqvist]

A dark cloud is closing in at the horizon
A fallen hero at his last stand
Severing himself from the life he once lived
Accepting his destiny with an open hand

Begins his journey to unknown places
Where no man has ever been
Leave no marks, leave no traces
Nothing to lose, all to win

A treacherous institution, a segment of life
Still marching onwards, in defiance
A total confusion, what is whom and where?
Past turns into present, screaming in despair

A now free spirit, set to fly
âCross the open plains, high up in the sky
On the wings of future, with knowledge of tomorrow
Perceiving the past, and welcomes the times to come

In a race with time, sees a life passing by
Talking all for granted, reality becomes a lie

A new dimension in entered, a new life in progress
Taking the pieces, puts it together one more time
Once devoured, now all is peace and tranquility
Perceiving the future and welcomes the times to come

A dark cloud has closed in at the horizon
A fallen hero at his last stand
Severing himself from the life he once lived
Accepting his destiny, and welcomes the time to come
