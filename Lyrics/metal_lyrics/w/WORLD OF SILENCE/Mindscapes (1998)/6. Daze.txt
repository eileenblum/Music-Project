[Lyrics: Fredric Danielsson]

The sun is rising to warm another day
The sky is bursting as darkness fades away
I am listening to the silence of the daybreak
Trying to hear what it has to say
In time all my questions will be answered
And that is one more reason to stay

I lay down on the ground embraced by her presence
Iâm trying though itâs hard to stay awake
Whispering thoughts within my mind tells me no to think
And through this bitter daybreak Iâm reborn

Perceptive to the wonders of world again
Open-minded and full of compassion
I thrust myself against the sky
To feel the heartbeat of the sun
Bleeding into my soul

The sun is setting under a blood-red sky
The tide is turning as daze turn into nights
Iâve been listening to the silence of the daybreak
And Iâve heard what it has to say

I thrust myself against the sky
To feel the heartbeat of the sun
At last all my questions will be answered
And Iâve got all the reasons to stay
