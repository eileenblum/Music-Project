[Lyrics: Thomas Heder]

Standing out there in the dark
Looking through the dusty glass
Through, beyond or maybe
Just watching her reflection?

There was something in her eyes
You would have seen it too
Something must have happened
When, where and why?
Does it really matter?

Please picture you inside
On your outside and then
Let the mirror tell the story
For you and for me

Iâve always feel this sympathy
The numbness of her mind
Thereâs so much for her to find
So tell me
Donât know where to begin
Maybe you were too afraid to ask?

Add it to your experience
Listen and listen close
It will only make you stronger
For what reason?

Feel and believe in the future
Trust and never look back
Imagine what you may find
The other side wonât have anything at all...

Let your dreams be the seed to reality
Nothing gives the outer world meaning
But your own inner world
There are no rules to follow

Let your dreams be the seed to reality
You will have to go by instinct and be brave
