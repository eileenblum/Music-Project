[Lyrics: Mathias Sandquist]

It was the time of year
When storms came from the oceans
Bringing cloudy skies from coast to coast
Days of miracle have all been used up
Been used up for so long

There was this day of year
When hope turned into tragic
It brought up memories no one could deny
Stolen childhood, a bitter rain inside
The bitter rains are pouring down

My beloved, I kept the secret deep inside
Here we are, why so hard to tell the truth

It was them time of year
When storms reach into minds
A year have passed and nothing more
If you believe thereâs nothing more
I hope weâre so much more

My beloved, I kept the secret deep inside
Here we are, why so hard to tell the truth

Once we hear them say
It was something that came through
Four seasons is all we need
All we need to feel
