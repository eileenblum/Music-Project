[Lyrics: Mikael Dahlqvist]

Where the land lies calm
The wind speaks of freedom
But change is on its way
The skies open up and the rain starts to fall
Where the land once lay calm

Itâs a rainy day, this October morning
And the birds song has ended
I let the wind caress me as it plays its tune
This rainy October morning

The leaves ceased to fall
The path of life lies open
Iâll walk that aisle
âTil I hear

Trees start to sing their winter song
The wind blows a tune on its wooden flute
Wonderful music sounding like a nursery rhyme
But beneath the waves still all is silent

Still the rain is falling
Days turned to nights
Shadows falling over me
I close my eyes and listen to the wind
Playing its lonesome tune

The leaves ceased to fall
The path of life lies open
Iâll walk that aisle
âTil I hear

Trees start to sing their winter song
The wind blows a tune on its wooden flute
Wonderful music sounding like a nursery rhyme
But beneath the waves still all is silent
