[Lyrics: Mikael Dahlqvist]

I am entering a darkened room
The walls are painted with my inner fears
In the corner stands the light of my life
Slowly fading as I turn away

Take a trip inside my mind
Are you satisfied with what you see?
Take a closer look and find
Thereâs just disgrace and misery

As the madness corrodes
The foe turns to stone
Now itâs easier to see
No one longer stands alone

Take my pride away from me
My only wish is to be free
I cannot make it on my own
Alone

Recollecting all the items
That once were in my possession
Controlling the life Iâve never had
Giving you my last confession

Take my burden of my aching back
Release me from these chains of sorrow
Iâve witnessed truth, Iâve heard the lies
Save me, before my tears drown my eyes

As the madness corrodes
The foe turns to stone
Now itâs easier to see
No one longer stands alone

Take my pride away from me
My only wish is to be free
I cannot make it on my own
Alone

As the madness corrodes
The foe turns to stone
Now itâs easier to see
No one longer stands alone

Take my pride away from me
