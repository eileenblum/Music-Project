I can see the source of forever
Bravely hiding behind the blackness
Extended open sky above our heads .
Remember
The stars they float like dust
They hang like birds in the breeze
Slow moving, receding, deceiving,
They're moving at a phenomenal rate
The Stars, like dust, encircle me
In living mists of light
The stays they thrive like dust
They shine with great intensity
Unyielding, overpowering
They make up every atom in me
The stars they die like dust
In time they'll change they way we see
Perception, never changing
It's not who you are or what you believe
They transcend night and day they stretch
For what seems forever more
Look up and feel their gaze this is what we came for
All things will be comprised, star dust, it's not just celestial
I stand, I see, I live, I breathe, I live, I can, I am
The Stars
