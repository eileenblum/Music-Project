Born of primordial waste Stunted limbs,
Misshapen shape Tetrapods!
The one's, from which we all have grown
A species who's genes will inherit globe
Blown in from under a dry ocean haze
Petrified and fossilized the shards of our rate
Tetrapods! Distant cousins are all of us They must protect their young, but how?
Swelling tides, under webbed feet
Teeth evolving info weapons so
Their offspring can eat Tetrapods,
Fight against the undertoe
The age of the fishes, left in the waters below
Hide amongst the newfound trees
Escape from the ancient beasts
Who dwell in the seas Tetrapods,
Relief upon the virgins shores
A Paleozoic era to behold!
Feed and breed
Bite to the bone
And split it in two
They must be smart
To get to the marrow
Crawl on to land
Then learn how to run
Before you can walk
Don't ever stop evolving
