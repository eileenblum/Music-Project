Under the cover of night,
Storm troopers will strike
Trench raiders bring shock and bring awe
Belt full of grenades
Rifles on back
Canadian corps
Plan their attack
Meticulous plan
Maximum death
The trench raider demands respect
Enemy unnerved
Shift of power turned
Flying flesh their alarm
To unforgiving harm
Meticulous plan
Brings certain death
The trench raider demands respect
Maximum Death!
Under the cover of night,
Storm troopers will strike
'French raiders bring shock and bring awe
