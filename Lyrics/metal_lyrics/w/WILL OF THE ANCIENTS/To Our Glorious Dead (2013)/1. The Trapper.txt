From the mists of time to Aklavik in July,
Came a trapper to the banks of the rat river
Albert Johnson, set up camp
And soon he tampered with traps
Mischief would go unanswered,
And mounties followed in his steps
Refusing to be watched, the trapper made his point
The mounties returned two days later unready to fight
One man gunned down, the trapper in dangerous now
They return to their homes to summon their fellows
The trapper must be caught!
He could see them coming, down the path
The rat river trapper was on the attack .
Nine armed men, explosives in hand, and a score of dogs
In his foxhole, He would hold them off
Leave home, destined for the woodlands and the winds
Wisdom, knowing what must be done to live
Hunted, through the wild like a wounded animal,
Withstand, the elements and conquer the mountain
Unlikely hero
The trapper withstood them all
Following the caribou tracks,
The trapper would go unnoticed
His only deviation from his methods
Would be his downfall	
Caught by surprise,
He was gunned down, shot nine times
Ended, will survive
