Revealed, the plan to over take the ridge
It was an ambitious plan indeed .
Could not repeat failures at Somme
Chances, they had only one, they could not falter
A fire broke out in the sky, the sound of 10, 000 thunders
The senses now smitten
Their trenches would reduce to mud
And fill with blood and limbs,
And forward they'd march up the ridge
To follow the creeping barrage of molten steel
Pulverized yet threads of resistance remain
Moving forward they'd mop up with relative ease
To the west, battalions were not keeping pace
Reinforcements would be needed to ensure
They would overcome
As they gazed upon it, the barren land in siege
The surreal bombardment, the world had never seen
The enemy crushed, by their cunning and foresight
To invoke the honour, of our forefathers plight
For they would achieve, what they could not
Canopy of steel, their guiding light
Steadily forward, we move with ease
Our soldiers head out, stalwart from green
When the soldiers looked down from the ridge top
And look on the view from on high
Victorious voices would echo
Songs of glory and pride, our nation was truly horn
To our glorious dead we pay homage
You showed the world our mettle
And forged Canadian pride
