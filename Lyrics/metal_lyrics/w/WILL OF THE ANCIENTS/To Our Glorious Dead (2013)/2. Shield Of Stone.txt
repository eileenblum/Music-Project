Behold in awe, the land forged from the flames of Gods .
Ancient volcanic soil gives birth, to hills
Of Oak, Spruce, Pine, Maple arid Birch,
Minerals await discovery under the crystal clearness,
Of a northern sky,
Glacially carved, through billions of dawns from our
Farthest lands north, and south to great lakes,
The Laurentian plateau, a shield of archaean plates,
For millions of years, weathered by the ruin,
This shield of stone is held strong over an aeon of
Tectonic supremacy, where the rock is at its thickest,
The Boreal covers miles, untouched by our hands,
Pre-Cambrian plates of distinction, Kazan, James,
Hudson, Davis, The Laurential Uplands,
In the stone, A song awaits the hammer fall,
The ground beneath it sunders as landscapes form,
Shifting plates the shape of Earth s geology
Changing shapes as borders move and boundaries form,
Yet existence will thrive, creatures will live and die,
The trees will drink the sod, for all time,
Encouraging the process to go on, nothing can be done,
Its strength wont be undone,
Can you feel the fire inside of it?
It will burn away the stone so that strength can flow
Forever from its source, the conflict of the Earth
Trembling underneath, the ground is out of sync,
A conflict inside, the plates will collide,
Yet existence, will thrive, creatures will live arid die,
Trees will drink the soil, for all time,
The laws of life have no rules, and require
None to govern them. Shield of Stone
