[Lyrics by: Jordy / Tristan]

We sail, to slaughter
Across the seas we shall wander
To take what it is that we please
And leave the weak to grieve

Freedom is our decree
So we take to the sea
On the seas we die
Black flags to the sky

Rape, pillage with musket in hand, we are the lords of the sea
Looting all of value, we cheer in victory
Rape, pillage, with treasure in mind, we are the lords of the sea
Across the oceans we travel in the name of anarchy

Fight, die, drink, capsize!
Our captain is a fool
So mutiny shall rule
Now he walks the plank
To the depths he sank

Rape, pillage with musket in hand, we are the lords of
the sea
Looting all of value, we cheer in victory
Rape, pillage, with treasure in mind, we are the lords
of the sea
Across the oceans we travel in the name of anarchy

Arrr!

"In search of rum and riches
And that we like a lot 'ta
We better equip, we better our ship
Already feared by armadas!

With wind in our hair and salt in the air
We are the lords of the sea!
We take your riches and bang your bitches,
The pleasures of anarchy!"

We sail the seas of victory...
