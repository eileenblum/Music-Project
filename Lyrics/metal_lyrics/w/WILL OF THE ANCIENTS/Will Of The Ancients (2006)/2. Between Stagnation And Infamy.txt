[Lyrics by: Jordy]

I find myself in chains
Trapped in my own shame
Mind and body, slaves
To the world we make

Why?

I live a life of immediacy
Since I can't find a way to be free

Why?

I can't find a way
To escape my brain
To escape my name
To escape my shame

Shame

I will escape
I will defeat
Men are as gods
Despite our flaws

We fight our flaws!
I can see the new way
Progress is its name
But with good comes shame

Shame

The choice is but one that is hard to make
Between stagnation and infamy

Choose!
