[Lyrics by: Jordy / Steve]

Luna grew tired of sharing her domain
Sol despises her and has much to gain
Their followers don armor and prepare for war
For they fight for their gods with blood-soaked swords

"We fight with malice in our hearts!
With blades we flay them to their parts!
The sun god shall never survive
For Luna demands that he die!"

The women and children refuse to wait at home
When they know it's a sin that they can not atone
Fear in their hearts; but loyal to the sky
For they know that they are being sent to die!

Luna seeks to end the light of days
And have night forever to reign
So sun and moon shall collide
For this the battle for the sky

The gift of fire
Sol's men grow tired
But he shows druids
The art of pyres

Burning of her followers
Luna then reacts
Freezing opposers
Dead where they stand
Mortal corpses pile high
In the now crimson sand
God's war takes its toll
On the world of man

And now that the war is done
Between the gods of moon and sun
They stare each other in the eye
Realization that they can't die

Their followers, now all dead
Carrion birds feast on their heads
Fallen friends, all they see
Their creation of misery
An attempt which can't be done
To eliminate moon or sun
But they must co-exist
For their nature demands this
