[Lyrics by: Jordy / Tristan]

Looking into what it is that they have done
Finding faith in suffering and life beyond
"The meek shall inherit all of the earth"
A lie told to all the sheep of no worth

Rewarded by death
Condemned by guilt
Waiting for God
Finding their flaws

You can never restrain me
Vicious acts of piety
Pain, death all for thee
Steel resounds across the sea

Loving, hating in their world of comas
Loving, hating all for their God
Hating, writhing in this world of comas
Hating, writhing, march to kill their God

Synapses fire in unison
Hate for life, pride a sin
Now we shall gather arms
For we march to kill their God!

Steel resounds
Angels fall
As we march
To kill their God
In their hopes
In their dreams
Suffering
Is the meaning!

Steel resounds
On this frozen land
Where i was born to this earth
It will take
All our strength
To achieve victory

Loving, hating, in their world of comas
Loving, hating; servants to their God

You can never restrain me
Your God's death, our victory!
Will to believe I've seen through
You just want us all like you

Pain in life
Virtue is strife
Fearing death
Afraid it ends?

Singing songs of victory we find ourselves in a fury
Fighting for what we hope and dream, again
Against the hordes of synapses
And dead minds in a relapse
We fight for human victory, our names!

Their God
Must die
The lie
Must die
Insane
Insane
Insane
Insane...
