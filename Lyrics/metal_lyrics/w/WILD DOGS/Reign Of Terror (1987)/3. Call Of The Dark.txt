A common man in a common place
Rebel by night, soldier by day
Do what you're told
Well that's all right
Until the voice speaks inside

One more drink and he's on his way
When duty calls he will obey
When it's time to go all he knows
He has to answer to the call

The call of the dark
The call, the call of the dark

He can't resist, he has no choice
When summoned up, by jackal's voice
Into the deep, with a double life
He cuts right through, to the other side

Out on the prowl, he's got the ball
Hiding out, a chameleon
When it's time to move
There'll be no doubt
He always answers to the call

The call of the dark
The call, the call of the dark
The call of the dark
The call, the call of the dark

In the dark
By the dark

On the prowl, he's got the ball
Hiding like a chameleon
When it's time to move
There'll be no doubt
He has to answer the call

The call of the dark
The call, the call of the dark
The call of the dark
The call, the call of the dark

In the dark
In the dark

In the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
The call of the dark
