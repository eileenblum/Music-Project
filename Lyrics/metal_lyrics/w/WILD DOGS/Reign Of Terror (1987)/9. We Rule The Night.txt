Come meet the maker
The authority in rule
Silent protector
He's watchin' over you
This neon jungle
Is sounding alarms
As we take our law
Into the street in arms

Stand aside, the siege is on
We're the night, where we belong
Hands of time
We take til dawn
In command of this hell hole

We rule, we rule the night
It's all that we got
We got the right
We rule, we rule the night
We're taking' control
Takin' control
We rule

Well now you wanna play
You gotta come see me to pay
You've taken an oath
Your night flight to escape
This code of silence
Is your only guard
Yeah to keep you runnin'
Oh against the odds

Let you out
The siege is on
In the night where you belong
Hands of time
We'll hold back down
She's the prey your sights are on

We rule, we rule the night
We get who we want
We're thieves of the night
We rule, we rule the night
Don't act surprised
The beast is alive
We rule, we rule the night
It's all that we got
And all we want
We rule, we rule the night
We're takin' control, takin' control
We rule

We rule, we rule the night
It's all that we got
We got the right
We rule, we rule the night
We've taken control, taken control
We rule, we rule the night
We get what we want
We're thieves in the night
We rule, we rule the night
Taken control, taken control
We rule, we rule the night
