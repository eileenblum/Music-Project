We're men who lead this mission
All pulled about the streets
Electric inner vision
We'll sanctify your needs

Tap and draw the power
Runnin' in our veins
It's the drive, the drive
Inject the fire

We're all and all for one
We're might until the end
Our time has come again
It's calling to fill us up

Metal fuel in the blood
The fuel burnin' me up
Metal can't get enough
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood

Some survive the madness
Some retreat and fall
A tidal wave of masses
Disciples to the call

The stage is our commandment
Music masters all
It's the drive, the drive
Inject the fire

We're all and all for one
We're might until the end
Our time has come again
It's calling to fill us up

Metal fuel in the blood
The fuel burnin' me up
Metal can't get enough
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood

Give me life from guitar
Give me liberty hear the cause
Give me metal I can scream
Give me fuel in my veins

Blood, fuel, metal fuel

Metal fuel in the blood
The fuel burnin' me up
Metal can't get enough
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood

Metal fuel in the blood
The fuel burnin' me up
Metal I can't get enough
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood
Metal, the fuel
Metal, the fuel
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood
Metal fuel, fuel in the blood
