The Red Express is leaving now
Leave your worries behind somehow
You've earned the right
Paid the price
Punch your ticket to paradise
To paradise
Weigh the good
Against the sins
Now your nightmare's
Ready to begin

Siberian vacation
A Hollywood wasteland
Hellbound invitation
Siberian vacation

A glamour world
To the Arctic Sea
Stake the place, you wanna be
A frozen land, of endless time
Choose the ticket to paradise
To paradise
Weigh the right
Against the wrong
Now you have arrived
Where you belong

Siberian vacation
A Hollywood wasteland
Hellbound invitation
Siberian vacation

To paradise, paradise
Weigh your good, against your sins
Now your nightmare's
Ready to begin

Siberian vacation
A Hollywood wasteland
Hellbound invitation
Siberian vacation

Siberian vacation
Siberian vacation
