Oh building the beast
From a modern day miracle
To protect and preserve
His motto to uphold and to serve
A mechanical nightmare
Frankenstein unleashed
Turning on his master in the 20th century, century
You better run, cover and attack

Oh, search out, destroy
Man against machine
Hide out in shadows
It's man or machine
It's man against machine

A laser beam nightmare
His death wish on fire
All warriors of justice
Sworn to the flag that they fly
A servant of betrayal
Bent out of control
Searchin' for creator
His time is runnin' short
Runnin' short
You better run, you better run

Oh, search out, destroy
Man against machine
Hide out in shadows
It's man against machine
Search out, destroy
Man or machine
It's man against machine

Oh building the beast
From a modern day miracle
To protect and preserve
His motto to uphold and to serve
A mechanical nightmare
Frankenstein unleashed
Turning on his master in the 20th century, century
You better run, cover and attack

Oh, search out, destroy
Man against machine
Hide out in shadows
It's man against machine
Search out, destroy
Man against machine
Hide out, in shadows
You better run, better run
Better run, yeah
