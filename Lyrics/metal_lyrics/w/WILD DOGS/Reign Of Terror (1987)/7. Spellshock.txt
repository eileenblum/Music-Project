Fallen angel
Lured into this spell
Unsuspecting victim
Caught against her will
Ancient modern witchcraft
Of irresistible urge
The time of disillusion
Has brought you to her world

From the straits of narrow
Thrown into a whirlwind

Spellshock
The rage that wills your soul
Spellshock
Her lifeblood's taken hold

Looking for a prayer
To quell the state you're in
Intoxicating potion
Will antidote your will
Shake off all influence
Return where you belong
Show a sign of weakness
You'll worship now the dawn

From the gates, we follow
Thrown into a whirlwind

Spellshock
The rage that wills your soul
Spellshock
Her lifeblood's taken hold
Spellshock
Lead to the unknown
Spellshock
The trance of mind control

Hellhound
Hellbound
Spellshock

Fallen angel
Lured into this spell
Intoxicating potion
Will antidote your will

From the straits of narrow
Tempted from oblivion
Behind the gates we follow
Thrown into a whirlwind

Spellshock
The rage that wills your soul
Spellshock
Her lifeblood's taken hold
Spellshock
Lead to the unknown
Spellshock
The trance of mind control

Spellshock, oh yeah
