Grown up on the west side
Surrounded by the east
The wall that's come between us
Casting shadows on our dreams

We're brothers at a stand still
All torn from within
I'll make my way through the corridor
And meet you back there again

In the streets of Berlin
I'll find you there
Meet you there
In the streets of Berlin
I'll take you far away from here

A communication cut off
Too young to understand
The last glimpse in the courtyard
I see it time and time again

A barrier has fallen
Too much for us to move
They may divide a city
But they can't divide the people too

In the streets of Berlin
I'll find you there
Meet you there
In the streets of Berlin
I'll take you far away from here
In the streets of Berlin
I'll find you there
Meet you there
In the streets of Berlin
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Don't give up
Though time is runnin' away
Away
Don't you run
After what you've faced
Memories and time erased

In the streets of Berlin
I'll find you there
Meet you there
In the streets of Berlin
I'll take you far away
In the streets of Berlin
I'll find you there
Meet you there
In the streets of Berlin
I'll take you far away from here
In the streets of Berlin
I'll find you there
Meet you there
In the streets of Berlin
Oh yeah, oh yeah
In the streets, streets
Oh, oh yeah
