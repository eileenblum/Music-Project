Sorting through the damage
From that which we have lost
It's time you paid the price
For those that you have wronged
You've taken all you wanted
No regard to fault
With justice comes the hour
Prepare for the assault

You've had your day
Now feel the

Reign of terror
Pushing further into your land
Oh face the reign of terror
A sentence carried out
By swift command

Another day is dawning
Cause for your alarm
A disregarded warning
Will suicide your faults
To my brothers calling
Sound the battle horns
Together voices roaring
It's time we right the wrong

You've made your way to the

Reign of terror
Pushing further into your land
Oh face the reign of terror
Devastation dealt by your own hand

Desperation felt far and wide
You'll find no place to hide

See the reign of terror
Pushing further into your land
Face the reign of terror
Retaliation you will understand

You've made your way
Feel the

Reign of terror
Pushing further into your land
Face the reign of terror
Devastation dealt by your own hand

Desperation felt far and wide
You'll find no place to hide

Wow, see the reign of terror
Pushing further into your land
Face the reign of terror
Retaliation you will understand

Face the reign of terror
Face the reign of terror
You face the reign of terror
Face the reign of terror
