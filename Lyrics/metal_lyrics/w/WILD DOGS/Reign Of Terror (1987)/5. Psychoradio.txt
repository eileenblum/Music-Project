Someone's taken over
Someone has stolen the show
Oh leave it some wise man
Who thinks he knows radio
A million listeners
Everyone lending their ears
Oh won't somebody
Get that jerk out of here

No more AM, no more FM
I don't want no more, no more, no more
No more AM, no more FM
Someone save us all
And give us what we want

Psychoradio, psychoradio
Crank it up, and let it blast
Psychoradio, psychoradio
Weld the dial, eighty six the rest

The hot box is over
It's down to what you can get
Scan up, down the dial
We can't find what we wanna hear
They say we've hit new times
I think it's a bunch of grit
On the wave of some new light
Somebody bring it back

No more AM, no more FM
I don't want no more, no more, no more
No more AM, no more FM
Someone save us all
And give us what we want

Psychoradio, psychoradio
Crank it up, and let it blast
Psychoradio, psychoradio
Weld the dial, eighty six the rest

Wow

No more AM, no more FM
I don't want no more, no more, no more
No more AM, no more FM
Someone save us all
And give us what we want

Psychoradio, psychoradio
Crank it up, let it blast
Psychoradio, psychoradio
Weld the dial, eighty six the rest
Psychoradio, psychoradio
Crank it up, let it blast
Psychoradio, psychoradio
Eighty six the rest
