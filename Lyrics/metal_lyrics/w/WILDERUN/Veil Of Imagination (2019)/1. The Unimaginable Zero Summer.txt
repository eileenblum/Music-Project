Weak for too long to notice the calling
Weak for too long to feel the falling
Days carried on, their touch but an instant
No time to hear my voice in the distance

Reading the pages of life, he summoned the will to rejoice in the dark
Lessons learned from forefathers must surely be enough for a spark
His fist was tightly clenched around the seeds he had amassed
He climbed the trees of strangers, sought the etchings of their past

But in the night, violence dreamt of his mind
And where it opens

Constructing a fortress of knowledge, he left no future in the arms of chance
Avoid any hypocrisy, avoid the failures dance
Useless, his free soul
Ensure control

Black words spewed forth from his head
One for each thought he had saved
Solidifying, rusting forms
They sealed in the cave

Excavation of will from the vaults of the earth
Sunlight burning through his back as his eyes sought dirt

Almost there, a time to be strong
He was almost there, but he waited too long

Every piece, every word to lifeâs song
He had dug, heâd put into place
But the order was wrong

He can never let go
Madness always creeps slow

Breezes of the empty brush past the surface
All the voices wither, the limbs are quiet
Is there time to return to the plot of nothing?
Can the blood now follow the stream into the sea?

A different darkness guides him, no path can be chosen
Forms become a question, he will not know their source
