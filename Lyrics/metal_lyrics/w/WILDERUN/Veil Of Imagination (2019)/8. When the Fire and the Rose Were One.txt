When the world first colored the sky
I consumed every sense with no ties
I was not in the field, but I felt the air
Life was there, but it was not mine

The fire burned, there was no pain
Only a reminder of the claim
That everything I touched was truly there
I needed not a future or a name

As the story of time quickened pace
Illusions of myself left their trace
I had entered the tale I could not see

There was so much for so long
Seeking any more is beginning to feel wrong

Is all still truly here?
Release me from my future and name
