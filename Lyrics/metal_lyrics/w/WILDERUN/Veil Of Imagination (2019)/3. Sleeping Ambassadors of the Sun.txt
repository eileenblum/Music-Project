Peace is careless of its form
Rooms of wisdom are unwittingly warm
To stumble into the night
Or burn our brain for the sacred light

Soon as you see it, it's already gone
All understanding becomes loathsome and wrong
Why do the fires keep burning for ones
Who have no reflection for the dream that they've just become?

They who lie, they need not run
Sleeping ambassadors of the sun
Caution to those seeking the truth they hold

We come in the night and awaken the dead
Committing our souls to every sentence they thread
"No, don't you see, you've already lost
The mind is flesh and its use bears a cost"

Wandering creatures come closer than we
Treating the air like a loved one would thee
Full of attention, they know not their strength
O what we'd give to forget why we came

They who lie, they need not run
Sleeping ambassadors of the sun
Caution to those seeking the truth they hold

Show me one thing
Show me one thing
Show me one thing
Never the rest

Yet still all things
Yet still all things
Still everything
Everything all at once
