A man will lie for a hundred years
In a bed of reliable gears
Consuming every minute of the day
Still flickers of the past peer through grey

He feeds his rumination's blood
Into the body that lies above
It's floating forward, acting as a prize
There's hope in its eyes
A promise that can never arise

So run far from where dreams unfurl
You'll claim the land but you'll miss the world
You cannot hide from earth and sky
The conceiver and its host must die

Bricks are stacking, books are read
Anything that can drown the dread is now
Welcomed quickly into the plan
More conjurations to understand

Leave time alone, its terrors have grown
Blackened and frail is the known
The tower will fall, so we'll have to crawl
Return to that from whence we came

There's bitterness that carries you
Will it survive for a minute as soon as
You collapse the earth down to its core?
If the watcher in the flesh is no more

So you should run far from where dreams unfurl
You'll claim the land but you'll miss the world
You cannot hide from earth and sky
The conceiver and its host must die

So run far and leave your corpse
Within the realm of the dead or worse
There is nothing you can think or say
There's another way
There's another way
