If the air touches skin with its grace
If the gift of love gives an embrace
If a blade finds its mark and blood is drawn
Still I think I'll be far, I'll be gone

If the breath of today does not sway
Tomorrow's memory just may
It is all I can hope for as of now
For the scent of today is too foul

Is this meant as as twisted cure?
Protection from all the hells endured
I'll take anything, as long as it stays
Within sight always
