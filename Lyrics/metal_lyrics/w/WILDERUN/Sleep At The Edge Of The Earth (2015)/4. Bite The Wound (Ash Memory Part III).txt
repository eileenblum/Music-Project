For one moment I lower to the dusty earth
And find the graves were dug while I looked to the sky
But I will fill them back up with the wine I fed your soul
I'd rather see you dead than watch you unfold

Clench the wound to seal it shut
Just bite the wound, it'll be enough

But the one road that leads out of the woods
Is watched by many birds
They'll never let me hide
From the shame of the truth
That water tastes like the stale air
And the grass is a bed of nails
So I'll drink the dirt and forget
My journey's doomed to fail
It's always doomed to fail
I'm forever doomed to fail

Clench the wound to seal it shut
Just bite the wound, it'll be enough

A dying beast crawls beside my feet
Begging for the end, for one last final sleep
But I can only stare and watch it suffer

Truth lies in the sharp edge of my blade
But if I strike, the image of the savior fades
And your memory of me becomes a name

I will accept your pain
As long as I cannot claim it for my own

I'm much too weak to suck the poison from your blood
I'll let it spill into the cup we both drink from

So I follow hope and shadow
Deeper and deeper into the forest
Letting any doubt be cleansed by darkness
