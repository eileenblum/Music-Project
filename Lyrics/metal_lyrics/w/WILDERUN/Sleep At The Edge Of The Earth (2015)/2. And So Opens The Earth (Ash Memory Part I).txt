After years of hiding in the dark
A sound is heard and the shadow is pulled apart
Just a whisper, just a fading song
A prey to capture before its voice is gone

I've scorched this land with the blood of my past
So nothing left breathing is ever able to last
I will drop all the riches I hold
To seek the candle that lights in the winter's cold

From the woods you crawled a life ago
Here you swore you'd stay
The mountain pass is marked with the very same stone
But the leaves have fallen, the trail is overgrown
I will forge ahead with the strength that I steal
From a false remembrance, from a time that wasn't real

Look back home before you go
It will soon be lost

And only when the last memory has burned
Will I believe a lesson has been learned
In the ashes I'll trace a map to guide me far
Not knowing that life still flows
Its soul becomes a scar

And if we stand
Choice laughs in our face
So we will go
And trust that something's changed

So the last wound mends
So the earth opens
