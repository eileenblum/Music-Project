Take the fire
And bend it into the shape of a child
And let him sing
What you've been trying to say for a while

That there's nothing left
No bodies to catch the heat of the flame
There's nothing left
And every word that's thrown becomes the same

We made hammers
To cave in the walls we chose to build
I'll grasp them both
Maybe you can honor the bearer of guilt

But instead
The white flag smothers the boy
And shelters the lie
You were only saved
Cause you could not be destroyed

One last time I'll
Try to tame the beast without breaking skin
But no solution
Seems to ever let me in

If I go on, I'll hold on
With the weakest grip I can
But neither warriors, nor humble words
Can linger in this land
