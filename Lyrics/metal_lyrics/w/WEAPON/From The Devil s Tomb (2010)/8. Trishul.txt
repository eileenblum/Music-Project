Ask, and ye shall receive. Lips parted, kiss of shame.
Transcendental spirit. Emergent, ravishing flames. 
A trident, a shining Trishul! Rips open the sphere.
Bleeding, gaping wound: puzzle of heart so clear.

Dirige Nos Domine;
Adeste Fideles; 
Dominus Vobiscum;
LUCIFER Mihi Ancora!
Vocatus Atque 
Non Vocatus Domine Aderit;
Veritas Vos Liberabit:
SATAN Mihi Ancora!

Drink of the unconscious stream, sweet Elixir of the Vain.
Towards the uncreated; Hallowed, unspoken name:
~SA:MA:EL~ TridentOvRebellion! None other embodied such might!   
 Thou giveth phosphorous structure, drinketh the nectar of night.

O Morning Star! My Light of Pride!
My song for Thee; the choir, the chime.
Ten thousand prayers, we cry Thy praise!
O Lord accept: a token... this life.

In shadows and waves, Thy motion felt.
(From) the highest peaks, (to) the endless depths;
Your flood will shape, a Sect of Man,
Feverish limbs, graced by Thy hand.

Credo Quia Absurdum Est.
I believe it because it is absurd.
Credo Quia Absurdum Est...!
I believe it because it is absurd...!
