The ceremony commences with a solemn prayer declaimed in unison. The priestess is seated 7 feet before the altar, her eyes closed. Initiates and adepts hold hands and bow their heads with fervor, for it is her time to arrive at the abode of Typhon.

She is vested in surplice and violet stole. Her eyes like incisions, wrinkled with aging skin: âI call upon the Flame of All to sever my cord and recoil my soul! Let me be Thy vessel of dissolution!â

Adepts and initiates 
Raise their Left hands,
Form the ardent Trishul sign;
Invoking Typhon:
âO Beast, who transcends Time,
Thy holiest name vibrated
As she kneels before Thy majesty
In servitude and trepidation!â

The priestess removes surplice and stole, lies on the soil and opens her mouth. 2 adepts approach her feet, 2 more from behind. Ashes and worms are poured down her throat; body slightly trembles, but her will unyielding, 
as worms pierce through her nostrils and cunt. With resolute hands they sculpt a Trishul betwixt her chest, and indubitably the blood-pus fills the Earth.
