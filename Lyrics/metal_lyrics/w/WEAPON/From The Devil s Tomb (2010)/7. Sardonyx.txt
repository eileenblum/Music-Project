Soiled in excrement and coagulated blood;
A trail of blood leads to limbs in red,
Limbs in red, jagged teeth;
Heaving with each thrust â Sardonyx.
Rusted nails claw out from her skin,
Putrid stench of afterbirth;
A mortal deprived of human caress,
Radiant, with each thrust - Sardonyx.

In the cup of life a dagger of faith;
Repugnant phallus in palpitating flesh!
O, demure child in exquisite pain;
Swallow the atonement - Sardonyx.
âTis oozing innocence! âTis dripping guilt!
Yet reeks of rapture, lust and filth.
The curse of vice like venom in veins,
Fall again, sweet Sardonyx.
