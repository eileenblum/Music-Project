Beyond walls of constricted time, I met The Grand Devourer. Lava flowing, Saturn (in) motion; transfixed Naga tantra. Promethean Fire was granted to me in a vision of absolution!  In the crimson miasma I caught a glimpse of Rudra. At His feet three hundred corpses, One with Bhairava. Trishul and chalice in hand, He bid me to the pyre.  

Rudra - Shiva! Rudra - Shiva! Bhakta - Shava! Atma - Shava! Naga Mantra! Lava Mantra!  Behold, Ye - Furor Divinus!   

Thus I rode the wave of Leviathan in stormy seas Above;    Summoned the will to descend through the hidden caves Below: Icons, idols, countless ciphers bore witness to His grandeur!  By stellar excursion I saw the Truth beyond time Just as blind sages and mad poets hath told,  Of utter dissolution; a caparison of abandon.
