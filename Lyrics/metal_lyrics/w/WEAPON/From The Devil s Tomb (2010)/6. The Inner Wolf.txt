Inherit plains that lie at thy feet; shatter the solar dreams; with jaws open, salivating at the womb of Bethlehem! Storming plateaus of governance. Gnawing the seams of creation. With iron fangs and crooked nails the welkin wolves awakened. Inner wolf! Inner daemon! A remnant of a slumber! A slumber (that in essence revealed) the true face of disorder.
Inner wolf! Inner daemon! Such mordant revelations!
Revelations that led us to the saber of retribution.

âO, Saber of Retribution:
Thy blade doth lead us
Towards the vast vestibule
Of sovereignty!
Whence, in summa,
We erected the final prayer,
Of liberation;
Yet, a monument of Thy affection.â

What is the scope, then, of sublime repentance? If the child of deliverance was conceived in lust? Does the flesh heal sooner? The scorn feel empty? When the source of dismay was a kin of the lamb!

âCorpses emerge from the vault malevolence;
The stench of resentment alive betwixt the skin.
The sanctity and grace
Of the all that is remembered,
Trampled under the crooked feet of the Beast.
Disdain - in aeternum. Supplication, in aeternum.
Corrosive chanting, slowly reaching inside the Self.
Rejuvenating the wolf within.â

The naked eye doth confuse eons of repression, and the beggarsâ hunger with servitude and contention; but an inkling to possess, that which cannot be attained by means of humility doth lead toâ¦ temptation.
