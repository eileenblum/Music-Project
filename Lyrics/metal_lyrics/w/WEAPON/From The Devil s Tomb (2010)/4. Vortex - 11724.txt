Children of sworn malice, creatures of white dust;
Reveled in stigmata, condemned to rust. 
Innumerable poisons, cyclical depravity!
A swarm of rats in decadent mortality. 
The rats! The rats! O, cherished dirt!
O, acerbic prison! Echelons corrupt.
As the poison finds, the source of the pulse;
That flickering candle of life is forlorn.

Within the madness of four walls,
A vortex drains thy marrow and spine,
'Tis a fatal cave wherein you dwell:
Carve thy flesh! Carve thy flesh!
Without the shroud of sainthood;
The guise of acceptance; falsehood.  
This is where thy corpse is born:
Carve thy flesh! Carve thy flesh!

[lead: A.VIII.]

My eyes are open! 
Smoke and dust plummeting 
To the very depths 
Of my livid Self!
For millennia I have been tricked!
Promises of (in)sanityâ¦

Swollen scars, gaping scars.
Carve thy flesh, BECOMEASCAR!
Inhale the venom, exhale the fumes,
Rotten skin, open wounds.
