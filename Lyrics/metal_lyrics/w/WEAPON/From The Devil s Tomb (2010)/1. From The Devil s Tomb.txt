God of Archaic Evil: we bow to Thy splendor.
We cower in Thy presence â silent, bleeding.
Primordial Gnostic Fountain: we succumb to Thy wisdom;
Our hearts burn in elation by Thine unfolding mysteries.

Preachers of the good word embrace the children;
Cries of innocence are drowned by coarse hands.
So we lurk in the shadows - heaving, seething,
They fulfill Thy will, so it is done!
From the rosaries drip sweat and unripe blood,
Of the tender flesh, that quiver in pain.
 O, throbbing salvationâ¦ gentle words:
Flock of redemption, deliverance divine.

Cadence fury
Venomous fire!
Arise My Lord
Through the mortem pyre!
And pull me under
The earth asunder,
INTO THE DEVILâS TOMB!

The Devilâs tomb
Is a temple of faith;
A church of persuasion;
A mosque of blind devotion.
âTis where He anoints
The seekers of Tehom,
Architects of Jahannaum;
Prophets of the Earth.

Within this Kingdom,
Arise no conceptions
Nor any assertions
Of manâs diktat; yet,
Pillars of arrogance,
Volitions of pride,
Icons of asceticism,
Sing His praise in unison.

â¦ From the Devilâs Tomb!

God of Archaic Evil: we bow to Thy splendor.
We cower in Thy presence â silent, bleeding.
Primordial Gnostic Fountain: we succumb to Thy wisdom;
Our hearts burn in elation by Thine unfolding mysteries.
Thy grace forever felt: stigma diabolicum,
At the halls of redemption, in the tears of the blind.
 Providence hath revealed Thy ubiquitous assertion,
Flawless manifestation in the deeds of the insane.
