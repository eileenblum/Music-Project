Those mongrels, embracing godhood,
They celebrate re-emergence.
LEFTHANDPATHYOGA! LEFTHANDPATHYOGA!
Crawling in excrement.
Crawling! In cremation-ground ashes,
Aliens to mortification.
In-trance-with-Chaos, entrance to Drakon -
Towards the Uncreated.

Daemonic unrest, spears that pierce
And rape the order manifest.
Their worm-like writhing, malignant presence:
Raging, lawless decadence.
Their rupture and wrath! SÃ©ance and prayers:
Rejection of creation.
They are broken clay-form reborn as Flame:
Towards the Uncreated.

The scoundrel pathway leads
To the triumphant throne;
The halls of judgment,
Are but illusionsâ¦ deceptions.

Uncreation catalyst
Spurned by the throng;
But the fallen one shall rise
And emerge a God.
