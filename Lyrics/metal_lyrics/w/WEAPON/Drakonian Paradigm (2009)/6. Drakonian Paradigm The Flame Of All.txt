We welcome first this Night,
Utmost sacred Night,
And a prodigal son of Eve;
We guide him through the caves,
This man, who broke the chains!
And strip him off his shell.
These dreams are not the kind,
Where one can wake at will,
Those voices not of Saints;
The sonata in your ears,
Is the foremost Angel's hymn;
'Tis the song of LUCIFER'S morn.

How far will you go?

To see the Diamond glow;
For how long can you burn?
When ashes cover your eyes,
And worms gnaw at your loins,
Will you cry out for God?
The truth may set you free,
If you truly do believe,
My Pulse is the Way.
Initiation has a price,
My friend, your spine (is) still frail;
My Laws are set in stone.
How far will you go...?

Ascend through the void of naught!
Drakonian Paradigm â caustic rebirth!
Transparent before the Eye, all-seeing;
Kiss the bloody tip of Kalilith's tongue.
Devoured by the storm of Qliphoth,
Culmination of fatal seeds.
The end of secular illusions,
Dawn of a spiritual mutiny.
Seeker, you ventured beyond.
This torch I anoint to thee;
'Tis made from the messiah's limb,
Who questioned (My) ethereal majesty.
Look within, not above -
As My breath exits your exhale.
Be One with the accusing glare,
Now emerge through the broken veil.
