Uniting the separation, severing perfect unity;
The fractal dilemma;
Manifest in grains, miles beneath the smoke;
Silent and formless...

Shapeless mirrors shimmer in the night,
As glowing embers commune astral light.
Where is the Cup that conceals Knowledge of Sin?
The stench of all Life, the scent of every Death,
Was always apparent within Thy bone and breath;
(And) must we bathe the corpse of attrition?

Rampant and raging, remnants of creation,
A mortem pyre as a spiraling welkin claw;
Ivory grandeur, demiurge overthrown,
(The) Tree of Life implodes, stillborn.
The purest, naked power (which Lilith devours,)
Stormed by the Shakti, a novel Athma shines -
Atrocious shift within the Garden of Mist,
Yet, the Lotus shall bloom forever more.

Glow!

Into the realm of Sheol, We sing, pray, rejoice!
The gates eternally opened,
Aglow, forever cognizant...
Come on! Ye seekers of gnosis:
Let our march be the final tumult.
Revolt the incarceration of skin,
Extol the forgotten lore, Amen.

Glow!
