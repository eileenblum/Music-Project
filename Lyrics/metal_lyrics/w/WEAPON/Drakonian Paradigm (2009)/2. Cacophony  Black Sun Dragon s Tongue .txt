"O Zalim! My heart seeks liberation.
Yet my lips! Taste (a) looming damnation...
Do I quell, these instincts born of Fire?
Yhvh, My spirit burns on The Desolate Pyre."

"O Kafir! As You speak, I hear Death's thunder;
Thy vanity shall sever the cosmos asunder.
Defiance! Your words' wounds bleed in the Heavens...
Oh LUCIFER, 'tis time to embrace Thy penance."

Fallen One of flames, mourning of the dusk.
In broken bonds of time, His pride ignites the Earth.
The seas divide all kin, as martyrs drown in blood;
When the Black Sun illuminates, our souls rejuvenate.

Spear of my destiny, Cleansed of mortality!
My master - Oh Lord of Plagues, Thy burden, my final stake.
Angel of Calamity! I weep to Thy cacophony;
Breathe through my deeds for Thee, Anoint these worthless limbs...

Swarming locusts, ancient star!
Carved in sin, Ye Holy scar.
Your mad laughter pierces time; Omega deity â perdition's chime.
When the four winds caress the Sun, The coil completes the cosmic run!
(As) Atoms erupt harmony is raped, In the womb of chaos the Dragon awakes.

Oh, Lord of Plagues...
