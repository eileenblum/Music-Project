I was born to worship Thee, Goddess.
I (can) feel Your celestial force.
The time of rebirth is upon us;
Serpent Goddess, heed my call.

Kali Ma â You are immortal fire;
Kali Ma â such divine aura;
Kali Ma â my blood, Your weapon;
Kali Ma! Answer my call!

LUCIFER - The Fallen Angel,
(With) Belial, a Prince condemned.
(With) Beelzebub, the Lord of Flies;
SATAN - the Emperor - awaits!

Lilith - She commands my wrath,
Maha Kali guides my path,
Chariot pulled by the force of Tan,
Jai Kali! Jai Kali!
Dire visions' miasma jade,
Virgin blood adorns my face,
Epitaph of the Shamshan Race;
Jai Kali! Jai Kali! [x2]

LUCIFER; Belial, Beelzebub; Hail SATHANA!
