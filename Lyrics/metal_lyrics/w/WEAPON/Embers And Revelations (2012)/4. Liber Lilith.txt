Vile temptress, Goddess ov Drakon! Initiator of perversion in mankind!
Let the phalli of murderers glow within Thy orifice of defecation.
O, ravishing Queen of noxious blood! He who repudiates Thy pulsating cunt,
Shall yield to strangulation by the severed, umbilical cord of a fetus.

Whisper the name of Thy consort: SATAN - the blaze of dissipation,
As You poison the minds of monks and besmirch virgins loins.
Ravage me, Goddess of Sin; permeate my dreams.
Augur of my rebirth, engulf and molest me within Thy womb.

Maha Lilith! Ama Lilith!
Infect my blood; infest my sleep.
Maha Lilith! Ama Lilith!
A thousand stillborn at Your feet.

Queen of Sheol, stillbirth vessel,
Ama Lilith,
Creation's bane.
Feral harlot; unchaste spirit;
Maha Lilith,
Mother of Sin.
