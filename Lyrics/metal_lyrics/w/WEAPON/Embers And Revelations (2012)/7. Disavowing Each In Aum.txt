[dedicated to sociopaths &amp; confidantes]

First taste of familiarity.
Separation from the whole.
Callous in sensation, smoldering from within. Poignant was the epitaph written before the dispersion, but how does one accept that which is intrinsically alien?

Seldom does one catch a glimpse into the vortex:
Shimmering, red, madness beneath the eyes. Lifeless.

Veins pumping odium. No pangs of scruples. A labyrinth devoid of guilt; illicit ambitions. I - unfolding obscurity,
Zenith of deceit.
Apex of disharmony and calculated malice.

[lead: R.S.]

Conducting the fatal orchestra of defiance:
A trail of ruptured lives and severed hopes.

The vessel is extraneous.
'Tis the content therein
That poisons and permeates
The constitution of virtue.

Seizing all via negativa, disavowing each in Aum:
First taste of familiarity, separation from the whole.
