Hear ye - I avow every drop of blood spilled upon this sphere. Heed My command, wolf-race of Cain; lineage of Death's Emissary: proliferate scripture; solicit infidels; sow seeds of despair. Entrench within their hearts the diagram of Uncreation.

Savior and messiah, foretold by sages, son of an absentee ruler: did the contour of that sanctified beggar at last descend? Or, stymied still, were false idols the recipients of reverence? (Idols molded in clay, shaped by injunction and upheaval.)

Shahenshah -
Lord of Elemental Chaos;
Shahenshah -
Rapturous Sun;
Shahenshah -
Father of Elucidation,
Echo, Uncreation.

Every kingdom beneath the stars shall burn, and seas shall rise a thousand-fold to the sky. O, archon, emperor, monarch, shahenshah - the luminous jewel on the acausal crown.
