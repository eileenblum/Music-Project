Take (it) as a matter of faith - the Lord labors in obscurity. His schema, a wraithlike revelation, like embers pining incineration.

Pandemic! His lava invades our veins, chastising clay-born predilection. Throne of disorder; in sulfur diadem, (our) Lord breathes on embers, grants revelations.

Embers and revelations...

And thus we fall through the magnum void; unchained and reckless, where no life dwells. Earthly-coil dissolved, transference - no return from the Dragon's crypt. Rejuvenation, resurrection,
Reverberation: Praise the Lord!
Praise His kingdom!
A mordant inferno: forever revealing, undying embers.

Behold - Age of Fire!
Praise - lawless desire!
Distort - those who resist!
Hail - The King of all Kings!
