Ferrum Legionem!

Abrasions and red fangs; hypnotic, carnal lust;
Trishul and saber erect, transgression on seraphim.
Daemoniacus militam, sworn to deicidal path,
Rejects of secularity, like vultures they descend.
Iron legion, Devil's vanguard; harbingers of strange eons,
Dwellers of the shadow-side, vermin of existence.
Vanguard of the Morning Star: pervade against the tide,
Seething and scalping a cadence of conquest.

Severing the arteries of all who breach the gates,
Gnashing spine and teeth beneath cloven hoof.
Jaws from realms below devour cherub flesh,
With fervor and madness the precursors ascend.

Daemoniacus militam;
Sanguis diaboli;
Ferrum legionem;
Triumphus diaboli.

[lead: V.M.]
[lead: R.S.]

Of velvet and brimstone, vanguard fire-born,
Daemoniacus militam, avowed to sedition.
Iconoclasm subjugation,
Vanguard of the Morning Star: bastion of SATAN.
