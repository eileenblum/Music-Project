I am the burning fire in man,
Final tryst of sophia and pride;
Dwelling beyond causal limitations,
All-seeing, acausal third eye.
My will: the line in the sand;
Sole ember that ignites your flame;
Constitution of cenotaphs,
I am I, the crimson tide.

Behold! For His tongue is a blade! Rays of the Black Sun: heed His words, virulent decree, ye, first witnesses of LUCIFER.
Recite His words and resound His chime, portentous gospel of the end of time; kiss the tears of beheaded saints - the parasites of an obtuse god.

Luciferi Excelsi! O, Beast Divine!
Anoint Thy witnesses, fruits of Thy crime.

Witness! The spoils of Tehom swine; dismembering sephiroth hearts;
cosmic pillager, radiant Shahenshah; redeemer of the lunatic ilk.
Ascension beyond demiurgic scope,
the mark of LUCIFER
in Loki's ruse;
in Shiva's wrath;
the scepter of Set;
amidst the waters where Typhon dwells.
