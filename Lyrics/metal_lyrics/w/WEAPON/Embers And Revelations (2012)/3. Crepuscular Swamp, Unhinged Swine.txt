Trapped I am in this maze of flesh, chained to transience, a cancer in the veer of Chaos; nailed to the concrete tablet of creation. Unchain my atma, o Sentinel of the Black Flame! Decapitate my Ego unto currents reversed. My providence shall be re-written! For I covet to be conceived... Conceived in a crepuscular swamp!

Re-emerging! From the cervix of a lawless whirlwind, I stand alone as the envoy of daemonic dispersion. Solve Et Coagula! In bile and blood I crawl, razor scales ornament my serpentine shell; now, I exhale insidious fires of omnipotence. Wolf-like hunger steers my jaw to the throat of the universe! In bile and blood I thrive, trampling the heavens like an unhinged swine.

Crepuscular swamp, unhinged swine.
Pralayic permeation by pain divine.

Catharsis: with each death, transmutation unto liberation.
Abhorrent: in the eyes of all who dwell in illusion.

Ravaging, Maya - mortal shackles yield to fire.
Salivating in a bhakti-trance, cosmic-cremation my absolute desire.

Deus Malum, Deus Mortem; Deus Infernum;
I applaud and rejoice as this sphere concaves in flames.
