Devout icon glows in skin,
Libel swept, beyond reason.
Menstrual-blood anointed flesh,
Parasitic mortal vision.
Silhouette boiling deep scars,
Celestial, blind devotion;
Open the gates to pure death,
Archana, inferi, libation.

Non-secular seed - Flame of All,
Compelled within her chalice.
Mongrel design of human error,
Foreshadow of extinction.
To reach beyond the grand scope
Of cosmic manifestations,
No mortal coils, no covens of hope
Cathartic decay: salvation.

Instinct of morbid traits - death-worship,
Souls that live bound to the ropes of His Dharma.
Spiritual Shamshan path - flame seeker!
Belong to the halls, temples of Archana.   

To walk an elemental path,
To descent the vessels of excess;
Wisdom from an ethereal source,
Veneration, sacrament of faith.
'Tis a blind man that walks afar,
Oblivious, strays the realms of bliss.
What pleasures we do attain!
Embraced by the Serpent's kiss.

In a dark, red corner of the human mind,
A raven unveils a poignant sign:
"As feathers append to the fog of decay,
Samskaara ascends, the Sun concaves."
