Reveal those cut veins - the mark of an open Eye.
Angelic Stigmata, malicious reek of Swine.
The Devil; he hands me a blade to unearth flesh.
A portal of faith lit our path - euphoric end.

Pilgrims bleeding.
Devil worship.

The ruler of earth &amp; All beckons for servitude.
A sordid poison breeds the flame beneath the shroud.
If the pulse of the Beast defies the confines of the cosmic walls,
Does that not then make us the conduits of Pralaya?
Reverence for dogma at a point of mortal end.
Garnered by scripture, pillars of mass command.
In the wake of all healing the Swine doth feel contempt?
The chasm ignites to the rapturous Bhakti-chant.

The Pulse opens the gates.
Towards infinite skies.
Dur-athma &amp; Pralaya.
Chaos-Chakra rise.
Hear the Serpent's chant?
The Darkness is but one.
Flame of vortex black.
Crimson Eye of SATAN.

Akshara-pathra heart.
Dur-athma poison wind!
Absolute deliverance.
Embrace the Fire within.
Falacious womb of Eve
Deep scars of rust and scorn.
Blood of the cremation grounds.
Soil of the Fire-born.

Parched and distraught, (yet) consecrated by His words.
Dance of the mordant, towards the starless realm.

Break the chains of hope, cut the throbbing vein.
Fill this chalice with death, demise is salvation.

Para Bhakti...Salvation.
