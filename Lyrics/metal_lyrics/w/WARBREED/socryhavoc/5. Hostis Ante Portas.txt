[Music by Sergio FernÃ¡ndez Ribnikov]

[Instrumental]

Vasily Grigoryevich Zaitsev, the hero of Stalingrad and the Soviet Union, remains one of the greatest legends of World War Two. Throughout the war, he shot down more than 200 German soldiers only with his tryokhlineyka and his expert eye.
In the Ural Mountains he was a skilled deer hunter but, in the midst of battle, he became an icon for the whole Soviet army. For his meritorious actions during the war, he was granted the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
