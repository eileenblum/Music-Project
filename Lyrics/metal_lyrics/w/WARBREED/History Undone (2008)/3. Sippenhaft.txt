[Jens Kiersted]
I'm a soldier for the Reich
I'm the archetype of the Aryan Ã¼bermensch
But I am not proud of what I've done
I've killed so many that I finally lost all count

I was so blind; I did not see my dream
Of unity differed completely from reality
But nothing is like it should be and I feel
I can't breathe, when I recall the madness and the carnage.

I never wanted to be the pawn in this game
Never wanted to see what I've seen
I naively hope that someday I'll be set free
Days are passing by and I'm still enslaved and forgotten.

...Enslaved and forgotten.

I fear not for my life but for that of my wife and son
A pledge of allegiance with a high price
These binds of flesh are a wicked machination
Punishment to the clan, our downfall is called sippenhaft

I'm a man in quest for his redemption
Whose dreams have turned him into a slave to the slaughterhouse
I wish I could go back in time and turn the story round
And then I would have held back my passion.

Call me a fool, but at that time the idea sounded right
I guess I am a fool
We were supposed to raise our country from its ashes
But this way everyday there are more and more ashes...

I never wanted to be the pawn in this game
Never wanted to see what I've seen
I have lost any hope that I'll be set free
Days are passing by, I'm still enslaved and forgotten

What am I supposed to do when all hope is lost?
Close my eyes and cry while I pull the trigger
This is no way of life, It's rather a taste of death
Farewell to you all, It's the only way out

What's there for me?
Silky clouds or ravenous fire?
Death, set me free
I'll kill no more; this last bullet is for me
