[Andrey Katzov]
What's left of us?
We are lurkers on this killing ground
Pale shadows in the middle of the night
We are candles burnt and worn out
Take a good look around

Cold, all I feel is cold
The beast has taken my soul
Three bullets in my back
Thus ends my life but
I'm glad I die in my land...

Proshaiy Stalingrad
Proshaiy...

Goodbye, I'm running out of time
I'm paying for my crimes
Father Koba, where are you now?
Don't leave me here to die

God, I've been told there was no God
But now I really fear for my soul
The beast, it crawls without a sound
The time has come for us all...

[Chorus:]
In silence we will die
Into darkness we subside
Now in glory we depart
But in Mother Russia we trust

This was my life
To kill and leave nobody alive
I hope this will suffice
85 frozen corpses should satisfy
The beast that lies...

Inside, I'm hollow deep inside
I'm 22 yet I've gone too far
My death is near, Stalingrad I'm here
My redemption lies in your hands

[Repeat chorus]

Now,
Proshaiy Stalingrad,
At last you're back to us,
Proshaiy Stalingrad
Your son bids you goodbye.
