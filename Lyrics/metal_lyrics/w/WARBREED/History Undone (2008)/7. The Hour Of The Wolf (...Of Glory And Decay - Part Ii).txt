[Adolf Hitler]
I'm the wolf that lurks amid the flock
I'm the hangman, the lord of pain in war
I'm the worm feeding on a corpse
I'm divine, the one-eyed god of wrath

Behold the wolf that I am
Shiver... I am real.

I'm the father of Ragnarok unbound
I'm pure darkness, a blizzard from the north
I'm the silence before a raging storm
I'm a Panzer forever rolling on

So it's time for you to...

Rise, rise my wolves
Together we will conquer the world
This kingdom of unevenness
Will fall under the rule of fire and steel
The glory of our people
Will bloom from a soil sowed with pride
Rise, warriors of Germania
Your fatherland is calling you to a war versus the world

Make them work until they're nothing but bones
Slaves and whores, the secret glory of Rome
Make them moan for all that they have done
Lebensraum... for being born in my world

The hour of the wolf has begun
And I'm invincible.

I'm the dragon that spits the fire of hate
I'm the vulture circling over your heads
I'm a phoenix; see my burning wings of fate
I'm reborn from the ashes of Versailles

The hour of the wolf has begun
And I'm the overlord

So It's time for you to...

Rise, rise my wolves
Together we will conquer the world
This kingdom of unevenness
Will fall under the rule of fire and steel
The glory of our people
Will bloom from a soil sowed with pride
Rise, warriors of Germania
Your fatherland is calling you to a new great war
The legions of the Rhein
Stand proud at the eve of the trial by fire
The songs from ancient times
Will inflame the hearts of the enlightened minds

Arise and behold my creation
The industry of death by obliteration
A thousand years of glory ahead
My empire will last forever...
