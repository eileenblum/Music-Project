Look, high in the sky
The vultures are back
And at full speed they ride the heavens

God, they're losing their minds
Why do they attack?
The unspeakable shadows came as a surprise

They came by the hundred
They arrived without warning
The bringers of storm, predators of warfare

There soon will be bloodshed
The streets will be blood red
The Luftwaffe is ready to strike with full power

'I can still remember the warning siren...
There was much light, yet we stood in utter darkness'

Look, it started to rain
Big bombs like droplets
But this puddle won't be precisely of water

Debris all around
Ashes and dust
A domino city just waiting to fall

Fall like Rome or Constantinople
Fall like the Tower or outrageous Sodom

Mother of Sorrow
Come ease their pain
For your children will see no tomorrow

[Pre-chorus:]
Death from beyond
Death from above

[Chorus:]
Rotterdam, Rotterdam in flames
Rotterdam, hell's breath on Earth
Rotterdam, Rotterdam in flames
Rotterdam, nothing will be the same.

In the middle of May, 1940
When no one saw it coming
Carpet bombing shattered Rotterdam
An unfair game won by stalemate

The Stukas wiped out almost every trace
Of a great city so rich in history
Of the many souls that died there
Of the heart that lost its essence

"Een Stad zonder hart..."

[Repeat pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2:]
Rotterdam, Rotterdam in flames
Rotterdam, hell's breath on Earth
Rotterdam, Rotterdam in flames
Rotterdam, gone all the same

[Repeat chorus] 1

Again.
