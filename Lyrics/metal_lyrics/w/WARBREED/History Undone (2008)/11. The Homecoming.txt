[Marek WoÅºniak]
On the verge of losing it all
At the end of this damn war
The death roll amounted to thousands
Yet somehow I have come through

Now it's just me and my shadow
And I'm running through the woods
I can barely stand the excitement
Five more miles and I'll be home

I'm coming home
To stop this nightmare once and for all
I'm coming home
Away from this bloody all-out war

So sadly I still remember
The death of my brothers in arms
Four shot down by a sniper
And the rest I left behind

But enough with my grim past now
I think this is my town
Whatever happened here?
There's nothing but ashes all around

How much farther must I go
To get home and tell my mother that her son is
Back again where he belongs?
How many lives must I take before I reach my home?

I'm coming home
At least I want to think I am
I'm coming home
Let me dream I'm almost home

Home?

I've been five years away cloaked in
darkness night and day, playing to be the
hero while those bastards played with my kin

What kind of man abandons his people
Leaving them all to their fate?
I swear upon their bodies that I shall mourn them for the rest of my days

And after that all I've done...
I am barely still human.

On the verge of losing it all
I ended up losing much more
I'm here all by myself to fight
My own personal war

But if there's no one there
I do not wish to go on
A dream within a dream
Is what my life has become

I'm coming home
Wherever you are I swear I am
I'm coming home
It won't be long

How much farther must I go
To get home and tell my mother that her son is
Back again where he belongs?
How many lives must I take before I reach my...

How much farther must I go
To get home and tell my father that his son is
Back again where he belongs?
How many lives must I take before I reach my home?
