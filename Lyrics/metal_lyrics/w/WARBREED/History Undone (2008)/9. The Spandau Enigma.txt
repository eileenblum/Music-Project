[Prisoner No. 7]
I died yesterday
Strangled by two men
They said I took my life
But they'd taken mine twice

They say they know me well
But I know I am innocent
My name is Alfred Horn
Dead since May, 1941

Then at last I closed my eyes
Forgotten? Forgiven?

Before my light goes off
I want you all to know
Before my soul ascends
I wish to be absolved

I was a simple man
A scapegoat for the great plan
The big owl's left its cage
And flew into oblivion...

[Chorus:]
[The Scholar]
Who died there... in that cold cell?
Quid est Veritas?  - His diary read.
Truth or tale?

[Prisoner No. 7]
So many years have passed
Since that dreadful night
When I landed on the glens
And kissed my freedom goodbye

A thousand miles away
Four walls to drive me insane
The flames of desperation
Burnt my hopes right to the ground

Not alone
No, no, not alone
No, never, never alone
Never, ever, utterly alone
Voices in my head!
My madness dies with me

Then at last I've found my rest
Forsaken? Forgiven?

So this is how it ends,
I take the blame to the grave
The men in black are here
My fate's becoming clear

The enigma lies unsolved
Six feet underground
But I have told my tale
And crave for absolution...

[Repeat chorus].

We may never ever know,
The Spandau Enigma, one and all,
The mystery lingers on,
The Spandau Enigma lies unsolved!
