Hark, I have sworn to praise the black arts forever
To battle until the end for the storm of malevolent darkness
For several time no I have opened the streams of red
Not to get lost in his limitless empire

Another age has arozen from the shadows below
Meanwhile wisdom spreads like autumnal storms through me

I have discovered so many secrets unknown before
Fierce dust lays down on my eyes
I am so blind that i can't see anymore the world of those feeble souls
But it is not of interest for me, for ! all the ones at the ground of my heart

"Thou, who dwelleth in darkness, am I the one I have seeked for all the years?"

Dressed in black I walk the paths into the forest of no return
I gaze into the moon and breathe sulphurous winds of impurity
I do open the streams of red again
And for the last time I stand above the chasm to nights'birth
