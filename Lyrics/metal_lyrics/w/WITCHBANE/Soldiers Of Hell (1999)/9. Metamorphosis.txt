Embattled is this realm of chaos mea! nwhile
We await the armaggeddon, funeral of enlightened ones
Slaughtered they shall be , scum of this universe

The ages of these golden sculptures are gone, lost forever
A new millenium will arise from the chest of earth
We hail the spirits of this metamorphosis nocturnus

Spirits passed this etherial cosmos
For thy age is born, we are the inheritance

Lean back and watch this evolution of evil
It is just a question of time, fall or flee

A scepter of serpents will be arozen for sure
