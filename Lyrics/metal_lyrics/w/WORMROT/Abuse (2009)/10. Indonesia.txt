Unite as one
Appreciate, highness feast
Careless fucks, punk at heart

Diy till die, in a 3rd world nation
Respect overloaded, they deserve to rise
Quality humanity is what the world should fucking be

Memories that we had
Fuck the rest, you all the best

You drunken fucks, we shall meet again
Unity once more, grind to the fucking core

Unite, as one
