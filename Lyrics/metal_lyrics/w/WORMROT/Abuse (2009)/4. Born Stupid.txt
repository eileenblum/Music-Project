Give it a break it is nothing new
So much hate fuck you
Why the wrath just co-orperate born stupid

Give it a break, broken minds
It is nothing new, fuck your rights
So much hate, lies or die?

A little more competition
What is the harm with criticism

You stupid fuck shall be impaled
Narrow minded shit will be leff to rot

Underground is dead in this fucking world
We do not need to hear your self-believing shit
You should be the one for us to compete
We will destroy you, fuck your thoughts
Who are you to fucking judge me
