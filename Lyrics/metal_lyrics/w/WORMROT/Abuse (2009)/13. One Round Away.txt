You just need to get a grip
Feel the cold sweat pouring down
One round away in your face
Exaggerated explosive, killing all humanity
Spend the day in fucking misery
Fuck this shit just pull the trigger now

Deafening and suffering, death
Back blast has ruptured my brain

One round away, back blast clear
We do not mess with this bullshit
