Fucking erased,
No way you are coming back
And start your bullshit again.
Fuck off now,
You don't need to be here bastard.
Forcing yourself to be
In the coolest generation,
Forgetting the fact that
Everyone want to watch you burn
Erasing your existence.
You are nothing to us
But just a plain fucking wall.
