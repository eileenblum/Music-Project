[Music: StÃ¥lvind / Lyrics: StÃ¥lvind]

Oh, brother where are you now?
Can't you hear my call?
My brother I need you now
If you hear me at all

Meet me at the graveyard
When the clock strikes
Meet me when the clock strikes midnight

I'll show you things that you never though you'd see
A family secret revealed
They never told you what you used to be
Can't you remember you used to be me

Meet me at the graveyard
When the clock strikes
Meet me when the clock strikes midnight

Fate is a nasty thing you have to admit
Nothing in life comes for free
Why did I have to die to let you live?
Why did you have to live?
It could have been me

Meet me at the graveyard
When the clock strikes
Meet me when the clock strikes midnight

Wipe off the moss and read the lines
It says your name right here
Brothers forever together again
I guess your dying to meet me
