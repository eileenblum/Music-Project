[Music: LosbÃ¤ck, StÃ¥lvind, Goding / Lyrics: StÃ¥lvind, Goding, LÃ¶sbÃ¤ck]

Is it wise to come to me
To guide you spiritually
Dead eyes stare back from the void
Reflecting what I see

I am the key that locks the door
The link between the worlds
Take my hand
Dare to walk with fire

Let the dead rest in peace
Step aside leave them be
Let the dead rest in peace
Sacrilege final sleep

I am here to satisfy
Your curiosity
If you think it's worth the risk
To be stuck with me

There are things you cannot see
That's why you come to me
Take my hand dare to walk with fire

Let the dead rest in peace
Step aside leave them be
Let the dead rest in peace
Sacrilege final sleep

Was it wise to come to me
To guide you spiritually
Your dead eyes stare back from the void
Now you're stuck with me

Let the dead rest in peace
Step aside leave them be
Let the dead rest in peace
Sacrilege final sleep
