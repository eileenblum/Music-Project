[Music: StÃ¥lvind, Goding / Lyrics: StÃ¥lvind]

Restless roaming screaming in the dark
Twilight maniac hunting the night away
Blood-thirst predator, bloodline of Lucifer
Red-eyed raging sadistic terror

The hunger I can't hide
Is burning in my heart
Never satisfied
And I'm looking for

The Bite - The thrill of it all
The Bite - The heat and the blood

Headless mindless furious beast
Hi-tech lunacy reversed psychiatry
Black mass hellion
Backward necromancy
Crusading death diplomacy

The hunger I can't hide
Is burning in my heart
Never satisfied
And I'm looking for

The Bite - The thrill of it all
The Bite - The ultimate high

Light, can't stand the light
I have seen it and hate it
It burns and it makes me blind
Days go by
I just sit in my room and just wait for the night to come

Days, I hate the days
They fade away like edges in the haze
Night goes by
I just sit in my room and fear the dawn to break

Restless roaming screaming in the dark
Twilight maniac hunting the night away
Blood-thirst predator, bloodline of Lucifer
Red-eyed raging sadistic terror

The hunger I can't hide
Is burning in my heart
Never satisfied
And I'm looking for

The Bite - The thrill of it all
The Bite - The heat and the blood
