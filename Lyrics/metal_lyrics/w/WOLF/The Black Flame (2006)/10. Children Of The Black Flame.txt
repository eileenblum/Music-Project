[Music: StÃ¥lvind, Goding / Lyrics: StÃ¥lvind]

When the northern wind is blowing
And screaming in the trees
When the darkness moves
And dances on the heath
A presence emerging from deep underground
Not a single soul in sight but you can hear them all around

Be silent, be still
Do not move a limb
Don't trust your eyes
Things are not what they seem
So listen closely, can you hear them in the wind?
Inside of you the silent whisper turn into a scream

Here comes the Morning Star
To make all new
Here he comes sailing on
The morning dew

A thousand eyes are glowing in the dark
Twisted figures move inside the fog
Could it be a dream or just a trick of your mind?
You may not trust your senses but you can't ignore those eyes

Here comes the Morning Star
To make all new
Here he comes sailing on
The morning dew

The time has come
It's up to you
This is the end of the road
The black flame calls out to you
Into the fire and flames you go

Children of the fire
Burning in the night
Come inside the fire
Burn with us tonight
Burn, burn
Can you feel the flames

As the northern wind is blowing
And screaming in the trees
The darkness still moves
And dance on the heath
There's no turning back and you will never be the same
Now that you've become one of the children of the Black Flame

Here comes the Morning Star
To make all new
Here he comes sailing on
The morning dew
