[Music: StÃ¥lvind / Lyrics: StÃ¥lvind]

Lost and alone in this desolate place
My senses betray me again
Though still confused I know I am used
Standing alone in the rain
This night is dead the stars are cold
The wind blowing dark in my mind
In the gathering gloom I sit all alone
Listening to my desperate cries

I am lost inside
Buried alive
I wish I could turn into stone
Still lost inside
Buried alive
Why don't you leave me alone

I hardly remember the days I was free
The time prior to your spell
As an ignorant fool, writing hymns onto thee
I drank from your poisonous well
Those days are gone just like you
You left me to wither and die
After you drained me you drank my blood
Raise your cup to the princess of the night

I am lost inside
Buried alive
I wish I could turn into stone
Still lost inside
Buried alive
Why don't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone

Lost and alone in this desolate place
My senses betray me again
Though still confused I know I am used
Standing alone in the rain
This night is dead the stars are cold
The wind blowing dark in my mind
In the gathering gloom I sit all alone
With no one to hear my last sigh

I am lost inside
Buried alive
I wish I could turn into stone
Still lost inside
Buried alive
Why don't you leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
