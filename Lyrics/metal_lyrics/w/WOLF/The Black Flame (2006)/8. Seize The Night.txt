[Music: StÃ¥lvind / Lyrics: StÃ¥lvind]

The wolves are on the hunt tonight
Can you hear them howling in the distance?
Listen to the footfall of the predator
Sneaking 'round your door

Shimmering images shatter the still of the mind
Moonlight so bright
Shadows come alive

Night - Seize the night
Let's steal what we can and leave behind a wasteland
Night - Seize the night

The scent of prey is in the air
Innocence sleeps unaware in for the kill
Aroused like a wild cat before the attack
Neurons fire at will

Shimmering images shatter the still of the mind
Moonlight so bright
Shadows come alive

Night - Seize the night
Let's steal what we can and leave behind a wasteland
Night - Seize the night
The carnage awaits and we're ready to kill

Never before have you felt this much alive
I've opened the door to an other side
Take one step with me and you'll see
The darkness turns bright
Cursed to be the days
Here comes the endless night

Night - Seize the night
Let's steal what we can and leave behind a wasteland
Night - Seize the night
The carnage awaits and we're ready to kill
Listen to the call of the wild
Receive the blessing of the beast
Night - Seize the night...
