[Music: LosbÃ¤ck / Lyrics: Goding, StÃ¥lvind]

See that drunk girl speeding down the street
A furious rider of death
Acceleration fast devastation
Potential assassin on wheels

A firebird of steel in the speed of light
Flying like a dagger through the night
Blood-stained wind-shield flee out of sight
Leave him behind no remorse let him die

Steelwinged savage reaper
Face of destruction and danger
Steelwinged savage reaper
Man eating killing machine

Roaring thunder sirens wail
High-speed pursuit is grabbing her tail
Fire and brimstone evil heat
Racing with death in the passenger seat

A firebird of steel in the speed of light
Flying like a dagger through the night
Bullets and sirens asphalt and rain
Live fast die in flash of a flame

Steelwinged savage reaper
Face of destruction and danger
Steelwinged savage reaper
Man eating killing machine
