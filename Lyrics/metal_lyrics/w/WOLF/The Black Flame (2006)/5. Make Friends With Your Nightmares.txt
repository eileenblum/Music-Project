[Music: StÃ¥lvind / Lyrics: StÃ¥lvind]

I try to stay awake
But I'm so tired I almost break
Breathing gets heavy and the images appear
I'm caught within a dream
Cannot wake up neither scream
Visiting hours for imaginary friends

Losing control
Trapped inside myself

The voices telling me
They scream inside of me
They are compelling me to do their sinful deeds
Cannot turn anywhere
Caught in the demon's lair
I have nowhere to go I do as I am told

Losing control
Trapped inside myself
Losing my soul
I must be someone else

Make friends with your nightmares

I'll stay awake from my bloody self
I'm not safe not even from myself

The things that I have seen
The things that I have been
Or maybe I still am
You wouldn't understand

Losing control
Feel so good inside
Losing my soul
I'm not afraid this time

Make friends with your nightmares
