[Music: Goding, StÃ¥lvind / Lyrics: Goding]

When you search for your inner light
And you've opened every door
I come to see you again
Like so many, many times before

I am the demon
In your mind
I will make you blind
I will make you blind
It's like you're dreaming
And I'm scheming
To stay inside your mind
Inside your mind

So you dare to raise me again
In the cold embrace of night
I'm your guide and your flame of life
I'm the edge if a sharpened knife

I'm liquid fire
I am here to eat your flesh and mind
Your flesh and mind
I have the answers to your questions
Seek and you shall find
Yes, you shall find

Now drink this holy cup of poison
Drink this blood of mine
And I will ease your pain
Just let me be inside your veins
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
Perhaps tomorrow never comes
When you are lonely in the dark
The only friend you've got is me

I am the demon
In your mind
I have made you blind
I've made you blind
It's like you're dreaming
And I'm scheming
Forever in your mind
Inside your mind

I'll take you away to my dark domain
No worries now I'll ease your pain
I leave you there on the other side
I'm through with you my work is done
It's the end and finally
All of you belong to me
Finally
You belong to me
