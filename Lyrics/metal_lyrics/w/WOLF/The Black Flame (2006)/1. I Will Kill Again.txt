[Music: Goding, StÃ¥lvind / Lyrics: StÃ¥lvind]

Nothing but time is what I kill these days
In this concrete cell just big enough for a bed
The walls have scratch marks that's how I sharpen my nails
And I don't need a view I have memories instead

Oh no, can't you see even though imprisoned
I will always be there for you to haunt you in your dreams

Don't release me, I'd kill again
Don't make the mistake and take my shadow for a friend
Never unleash the beast
Or feed the flame
It wouldn't take long before I killed

As days turn to years while my hair turns grey
You will never forget me and I haven't forgotten you
I vividly remember your eye reflected on my blade
Night and day in my dreams I finish what I started to do

You know these walls can never keep me inside
I will always be there for you to haunt you in your dreams

Don't release me, I'd kill again
Don't make the mistake and take my shadow for a friend
Never unleash the beast
Or feed the flame
It wouldn't take long before I killed

I can never see the light again
That's OK; you're always before my eyes
In our fantasies united again
Where I make sweet love to you with my knife

There was nobody like you among all the others
I enjoyed you more which is why I kept you alive
It is my satisfaction to be the main attraction
And to know that you'll remember me 'till you die

I know you know, but they can't understand it
I will always be there for you to haunt you in your dreams

Don't release me, I'd kill again
Don't make the mistake and take my shadow for a friend
Never unleash the beast
Or feed the flame
Run for your life when you hear my footsteps in the rain
Don't release me, I am insane
It wouldn't take long until I killed
Once again
I just can't wait
To kill again
