The warlords of mayhem
Rises out of cursed soil
Deceived ignorant men
Become the pawns of flesh and blood
Violate Dominate
Slaughter and exterminate
Fireflies In the night
Carry out the genocide
The rotten seed of hate
Grows in those who never learn
While blood seals their fate
Beyond the point of no return
Violate Dominate Slaughter and exterminate
Fireflies In the night
Carry out the genocide
The screams from afar
Will die in a silent sigh
For those who are doomed
Await their fate in the dead of night
Violate
Dominate
Slaughter and exterminate
Fireflies
In the night
Carry out the genocide
Rain of napalm
The earth bleed and heaven burns
Reign of terror
We're all going to die
This is total genocide
