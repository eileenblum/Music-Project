Strolling in solitude the city is asleep
You watch your breath and hear the snow beneath your feet
Then you hear footsteps that cannot be your own
You are afraid but feel the urge to turn around
Living in a dream Well out in space
Floating in a stream Without a trace
You're not perpetual
Forever steel
Trapped inside a deadly wheel
The room is quiet when you wake up in the dark
There's only one sound that's the pounding of your heart
Light a candle and see what's lurking in the night
A breath of death blows out the candle and your life
Living in a dream Well out in space
Floating in a stream
Without a trace
You're not perpetual
Forever steel Trapped inside a deadly wheel
The Reaper comes without warning on his way
His scythe is sharpened and it has your name engraved
You'll never know when there's no way to plan ahead
You'll never know until the moment when you're dead
Living in a dream Well out in space
Floating in a stream Without a trace
You're not perpetual
Forever steel
Trapped inside a deadly wheel
