Dark as a shadow
Sharp as a knife
An arctic breeze as cold as ice
Deep as an abyss
Sweet as a kiss
A burning hellfire on the rise 
You say you don't know my kind
Although I dwell in your mind
Venomous viper
Sinister deeds
An ancient force from a nether world
You love its curse you cannot resist the urge
Addicted blood yields to the need
You say you don't know my kind
Although I dwell in your mind
You have no clue what I am
But I will get you in the end
Dark as a shadow
Sharp as a knife
An arctic breeze as cold as ice
Deep as an abyss Sweet as a kiss
A burning hellfire on the rise
You say you don't know my kind
Although I dwell in your mind
You have no clue what I am
But I will get you...
I am the dawning of a thousand million years
I am the falling of a thousand million tears
Though you are not aware I'm present all the time
I dwell inside your mind transcendent dark sublime
