I walk alone in a crowded street
A sneaking lonesome stalker of the night Suspicious eyes that I meet
Always look upon me with deceit I can feel insanity
Crawling down my spine Because I am so insane
Really so insane 
Here in space minds ablaze
Burning frenzy, yeah
You can't see inside of me
Through my twisted stare
I hear them voices in my mind
Suggesting evil doings all the time
Release the wolves the moon is full
I feel them bugs crawling inside my skull I'm in reversed
Utopia
Exploring all the dark abandoned sides
Because I am so insane
Utterly insane, yeah
Here in space minds ablaze
Burning frenzy, yeah
You can't see inside of me
Through my twisted stare
Every time I see the light
Clouds begin to gather
All my hopes before my eyes Vanish into smoke
You don't know how much I yearn
To get out from this prison I can hear what's left of me
Calling from inside
Here in space minds ablaze
Burning frenzy, yeah
You can't see inside of me
Through my twisted stare
This is me - insanity
Everything I am
