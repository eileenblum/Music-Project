Dark ages and a shadow of death
Swiped across the land
A man of his time and a man of the law
Spread fear among the masses
On and on, from place to place
His mission carried on
In medieval madness
Destroy all witchcraft
Pain - I need your pain
The mark of your blood will tell me
Confess the truth Pain - taste my pain
No use to resist, make it easy
Confess my truth
No one is innocent no one is pure
Those words we do not know
Let God's will be done, there's no time to waste
Get on with the test make haste
We got methods to make you talk
Prepare the burning stake
The heat of the fire reveals the liar
Pain - I need your pain
The mark of your blood will tell me
Confess the truth Pain - taste my pain
No use to resist, make it easy
Confess my truth
Come fire, come blood Wash the sin away
Purified in purgatory
My holy law justifies my greed
Men's taste for blood
Justifies my deeds
The work is done no one has won
But an arbitrary law
With a peculiar pride and a guinea smile
Collect your silver and go
Travel on with your holy fire
But bear these words in mind
The truth meets the liar
You'll reap what you saw
Pain - I need your pain
The mark of your blood will tell me
Confess the truth
Pain - taste my pain
No use to resist, make it easy
Confess my truth
Black witches burn
You all will burn
Now witches burn In pain
