I wolf the peace inside of you
The nasty way the demons do I exhale my wickedness in you
So when you open up your eyes I'm there to flatter with demise
There's nothing you can do
I am the children of the night
The storm in you that kills the light
Here I come
Charging out through your skull
My reflection in your eyes
You hear me laugh when you die
Evil deeds You satisfy my vicious needs
A wave of terror in your mind
Eats you alive
They laugh at you I swear it's true With blade in hand what will you do?
Kill yourself a fool
Suddenly they're right behind I've got revenge on your mind
You know what to do
Come try and catch me if you can I am the
Devil in a man
Here I come
Charging out through your skull
My reflection in your eyes
You hear me laugh when you die
Evil deeds You satisfy my vicious needs
A wave of terror in your mind
Eats you alive
I am the evening and the dawn
The father to the morning star I teach the art of war
Sweet hate is pumping through your veins
The flame of fury burns inside
Exciter
I am the children of the night
The storm in you that kills the light
Here I come
Charging out through your skull
My reflection in your eyes
You hear me laugh when you die
Evil deeds
You satisfy my vicious needs
A wave of terror in your mind
Eats you alive
