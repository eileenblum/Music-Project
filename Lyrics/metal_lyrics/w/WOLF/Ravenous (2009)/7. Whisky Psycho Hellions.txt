Hello my friend, It's me again
Reckon you remember me
Nice to meet you, nice to eat you
Nice surprise, where have you been?
Like a re-occurring dream
The bad kind, if you know what I mean
Bet you wish I disappear
I'm not going anywhere

Whisky psycho hellions
Waste my time away

The essence of insanity
Ice cold inhumanity
Please give me a hand
I need to eat the flesh right off the bone
I'm a taker, I'm a fake
Chameleon of the masquerade
Blood-sucker and parasite
Imposter and eternal lie

Whisky psycho hellions
Waste my time away
Whisky psycho hellions
Waste of time and space
