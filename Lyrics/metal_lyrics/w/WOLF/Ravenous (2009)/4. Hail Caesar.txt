I like to tear the wings off flies and watch them crawl around
Sometimes it takes so little to feel so alive
As far as I'm concerned religion is for fools
There's only one God anyway, and I think you know his name

Some say that life is sacred, well I beg to differ
The purpose of all life is to be sacrificed to me
Now listen up you ants and rise up from your misery
Ive built you all a temple, now kneel and worship me

All hail Caesar [x4]

Now kneel and worship me

All hail Caesar [x4]

All hail Caesar [x4]
