Let's open up the door to my secret chamber
And care to take a look if you only dare
There is something hiding in the dark

I keep falling down - But cannot find the bottom
This black hole never ends - So I just keep on falling

These are the secrets we keep
Evil of which we don't speak
I know that you're just like me

I have something to show
You had it coming for you, My theatre of pain
Come in and have a seat
Watch the curtain fall before your eyes

I keep falling down - I cannot find the bottom
This black hole never ends - So I just keep on falling

These are the secrets we keep - Evil of which we don't speak
I know that you're just like me

Let's not run for the exit sign again
Close your eyes and hold on tight
Understand there's no true escape from me
Let me show you another light

Let's open up the door to your secret chamber
I dare you, take a look
Or is it they you are scared of something
Hiding in the dark

We keep falling down - But never hit the bottom
This black hole never ends - So we just keep on falling

These are the secrets we keep
Evil of which we don't speak
I know that you're just like me
