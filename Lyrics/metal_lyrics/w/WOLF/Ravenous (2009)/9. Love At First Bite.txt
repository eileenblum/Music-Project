Slithering, sliding
Outside your bedroom door
Something is creeping
It's seeking to devour

Don't be afraid of the dark
You need just to close your eyes
The viper's erect and it's ready to strike
That's when you know

Love at first bite
First bite

My tongue is slick
And it's licking your wicked body
You're writhing and moaning
But you don't want to stop me

Don't be afraid of the dark
You need just to close your eyes
The viper's erect and it's ready to strike
That's when you know

Love at first bite
First bite

Slithering, sliding
Outside your bedroom door
Something is creeping
It's seeking to devour

My tongue is slick
And it's licking your wicked body
You're writhing and moaning
But you don't want to stop me

Your first bite
It's your first bite
First bite
You'll never forget your first bite

It's where I belong - Under your skin
Inside of you - I'll let myself in

The first bite
The first bite
The first bite
You'll never forget your first bite
