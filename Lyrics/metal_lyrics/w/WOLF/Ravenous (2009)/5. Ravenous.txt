I'm losing my mind, the hunger inside
Is tearing me apart
I'm a bottomless pit, no matter how much
I always crave for more

It's almost there within my reach
I'm getting closer all the time
I just got to feed the flames

I don't mind the spots and the stains
My flag is spangled with blood and brains

Inside of my veins, I'm feeling the pain
As I take another drink
I'm over the edge, I'm not coming back
Beyond the point of no return

It's almost there within my reach
I'm getting closer all the time
I just got to feed the flames

I don't mind the spots and the stains
My flag is spangled with blood and brains

I'm paying the price, but that's what I'm like
There is no other way
It's my sacrifice, that I'm gonna pay
This altar is for you

I don't mind the spots and the stains
My flag is spangled with blood and brains
I don't mind the spots and the stains
My flag is spangled with blood and brains
