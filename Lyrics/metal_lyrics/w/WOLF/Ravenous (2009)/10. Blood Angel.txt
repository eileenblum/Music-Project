Reaching out for imaginary hands
Chasing shadows that I call friends
I don't know where to turn my head
Here I stand at the gallows end
Vultures coming to collect the debt
I put the noose around my neck
We all know that it's not my fault
I'm just fullfilling my destiny

[Chorus:]
Blood Angel - take my life
Blood Angel - set me free
Blood Angel - here I am
Come for me it's the end

All my days I have wasted away
Trying so hard to keep up the lies
Twisted the truth just to get what I want
I've been running from myself all the time
I have destroyed everything I loved
I don't care everything is dead
Now I reached the end of the line
And I'm going down

[Chorus]

It's my life, I do what I want
It's my life, You don't know how I feel

[Chorus]

It's my life, I do what I want
It's my life, You don't know how I feel
It's my life, I don't know what I want
