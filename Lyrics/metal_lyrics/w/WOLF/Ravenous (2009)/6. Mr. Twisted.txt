I recognize those eyes from somewhere before
Now it freaks me out the way they stare
Broke all my mirrors 'cause I couldn't stand that gaze
Then glued all the pieces to my face

Hell yeah!

I have no friends left, don't trust them anymore
I've seen the looks they throw behind my back
I had my doubts before but now i know I'm sure
Conspiracy, it's obvious to me

Mr. Twisted, tell me where's your mind, yeah
Mr. Twisted, where'd you go and hide

Gave up my bank account, gave up my home, my phone
Still I hear voices all the time
I've painted all the windows black, to protect me from the space attack
Hoping they won't see me when they arrive

Mr. Twisted, tell me where's your mind, yeah
Mr. Twisted, where'd you go and hide

I'm leaving, I guess I'm leaving
You'll never see me again
I'm leaving, oh yes I'm leaving
You'll never hear from me again

Mr. Twisted, tell me where's your mind, yeah
Mr. Twisted, where'd you go and hide
Mr. Twisted, Mr. Twisted, Mr. Twisted, paranoia
Mr. Twisted, talk to me, Mr. Twisted
