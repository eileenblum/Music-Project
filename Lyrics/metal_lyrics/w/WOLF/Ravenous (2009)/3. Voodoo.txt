When you're burning with fever in the dead of the night
When the lights are out and the moon is bright
When you're soaked in sweat and you wake up and scream
At the shadows that seem to devour your soul

When you put on a hex, to get rid of your ex
To be an attraction to the opposite sex
When you're spending your money on a whole bunch of lies
That's when they got you under control

Voodoo [x4]

When reality suck, you wanna change your luck
Life guarantee, for a minimum fee
25 dollar spells to increase your wealth
There is no limit to what we can sell

Voodoo [x4]

So when you're burning with fever in the dead of the night
Lights are out, and the moon is bright
If you're obese, don't cut down on the cheese
There is an answer for all of your needs

Voodoo [x4]
