Sticks and stones may break your bones
But words will never hurt you
What a lie
Electrocute a thousand Mansons
In the chair
Evil never dies

I'm hiding in the shadows
They'll hunt me down like a wounded beast
I'm lurking like prowler
They'll find me crawling on my knees
Like a beast

There's not enough blood in my veins
To quench the thirst of this raging mob
Preachers feed on superstitions
Politicians of man's urge to kill

I'm hiding in the shadows
They'll hunt me down like a wounded beast
I'm lurking like prowler
They'll find me crawling on my knees
Like a beast

I'm hiding in the shadows
They'll hunt me down like a wounded beast
I'm lurking like prowler
They'll find me crawling on my knees
I hear the coming closer
Just a matter of time till they hunt me down
Like a beast
