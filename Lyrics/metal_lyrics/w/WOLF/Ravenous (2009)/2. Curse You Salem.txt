Back in 1692
The year of the Black Witch
Samuel Paris points a crooked finger
At the witch and proclaims

By these means the Devil is
Among us
The fires of hell will consume the condemned

The puritans' law is the law of our God
And to it all heads must bow
This witch-infested land must be purified
Once and for all

To get rid of the Devil
Among us
Let the fires of hell consume the condemned

Curse you Salem
The words have been spoken
Curse you Salem
So it shall be written

Giles Corey stood mute in front of the law
No man should hang without torture
God-fearing men with blood on they hands
There's no rest for the wicked

It's tricky to tell the saints from the devils
Among us
The fires of hell feeds on our fears

Curse you Salem
The words have been spoken
Curse you Salem
So it shall be written

Curse you Salem
At the gallows hill hang the scape goats
Curse you Salem
So it shall be done
