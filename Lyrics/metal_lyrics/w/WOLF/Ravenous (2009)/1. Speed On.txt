Standing cornered, my back against the wall
The knife against my throat
With white knuckles and blood on my teeth
I am going to war

Speed on
Speed on and on

No retreat, I'm never looking back
I leave the Devil in the dust
No remorse, I won't shed a single tear
I race towards tomorrow

Speed on
Speed on and on
Speed, speed on

You can try and stop me, my attack will hit you
Like a ram
I'll defeat you, I will kill and eat you
I run through you where you stand

[x2]
Speed on
Speed on and on
Speed, speed
