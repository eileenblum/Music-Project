Electric message from the gods
Deliver pain with devil sparks
I can't see who they are
Mechanic men are shaping me
Progressive fake technology
Arial church it's the new breed
Programming needs into my mind
Electrolytes run down my spine
I am therefor I die
The things I want, the things I need
Are suddenly erased for me
Of thing and man I bleed
Every night I fall asleep I have this dream
Where I am back to before it began
No fear of life no demon messages in my mind
And I'm a man again
Feels so good to be no one else but me
But then I wake up soaked in sweat in the night
And hear my mind screaming "murderer!"
Electric message from the gods
Deliver Pain with devil sparks
I can't see who they are
Programming needs into my mind
Electrolytes run down my spine
I am therefor I die
