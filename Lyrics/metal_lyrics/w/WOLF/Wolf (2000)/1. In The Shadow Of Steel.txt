I have just found out
I'm the chosen one
I am the great Sir Knight
Rescue young maidens
Fighting evil dragons
I'll defeat all the giants
In the shadow of steel
I am Don Quijote
Of La Mancha
Evil forces stand back!
And you black knights
Out of darkness
You'll beware of my attack
In the shadow of steel
They say I've gone mad
And my fate's rather sad
All the fame and the glory
I seek but they say I've read too many stories
In the shadow of steal
