There's a ship that is patiently waiting
For me on the shore
And the winds, they are eager to take me
Where none been before
I can hear the winds calling out my name
If I go then I know that it will be
To never return
I can't get back what I leave behind me
All my bridges have burned
I can hear the sea roars out my name
Oh no, he waves are getting higher
Oh no, do I dare to go
Oh well, despite this nasty weather
Yes, yes, I'll go
Left my fate in the hands of the deep sea
As my voyage's begun
I don't know where the winds want to take me
I sail towards the sun
I can hear the winds calling out my
I can hear the sea roars out my name
