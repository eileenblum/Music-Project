The roaring of engines burning fuel
We come with thunder wherever we roam
Hail freedom! We won't bend to your rules
We're a lost generation without a home
The blood is burning in our veins
Behold the dust clouds from miles away
We go through fire, storm and rain
We will not settle down we are to wild to tame
Ride, ride!
On dusty highways we ride
Roll, roll!
Like gypsies we're bound to roll
A restless pack born to be free
Always searching for something that we don't know
Don't try to change our ways to be
The highway's the only way we've ever known
Ride. ride!
On dusty highways we ride
Roll, roll!
Like gypsies we're bound to roll
There's no rest for our weary souls
We sail an ocean of sand
The sun burns our sails
At the horizon we gaze
Moving closer day by day
But for every step we take
It moves another step away
So far away from us
As we ride across the desert plains
So far away, so far away
The only thing we leave behind is miles, miles and miles...
Ride, ride!
On dusty highways we ride
Roll, roll!
There's no rest for our weary souls
Like gypsies we're bound to roll
We will ride on till we die
