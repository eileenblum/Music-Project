When the earth lost it's light
No more sun in the sky
I began to see fear
Even in the very bravest seamen's eyes
A fresh water's sailors fear
Of deliverance and storm
But with good ship and sea roam
We will make it home
The wind began to blow, in fury made waves to rise
A good ship but deep loaden
And with all that in mind we still rolled the dice
Waiting for judgement of heaven
Then the wind increased and so she wallowed in the sea
We had all hands at work to strike the top mast
But as the ropes got stuck we didn't have a chance
It's happening so fast
Waves raging higher
Please let us not die hear
From this violent storm
Save us all
Fear in our eyes as we gaze at the sky
For this one time
Save us all
The sea went mountain high, it broke upon us all
He wind whipped our sails
I heard the boatswain call and to his death he fell
At once washed away
Our captain prayed for mercy from the violent storm
We all could hear him cry
No time to waste now, cut the mast by the board
Or else we're doomed to die
Waves raging higher
Please let us not die hear
From this violent storm
Save us all
Fear in our eyes as we gaze at the sky
For this one time
Save us all
The ship was breaking but still the remaining crew
Called all hands to the pumps
As a last cry for help from desperate men at sea
We fired our guns
Waves raging higher
Please let us not die hear
From this violent storm
Save us all
Fear in our eyes as we gaze at the sky
For this one time
Save us all
