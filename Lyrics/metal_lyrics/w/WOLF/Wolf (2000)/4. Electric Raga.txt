Dance little sister
In a cosmic haze
Follow the guru
To his secret place
Oh, close your eyes and see
And let the Raga take you far away
Fade into the light
The zephyr's blowing
To fan the flames
The sapphires are glowing
In your pretty face
Oh, close your eyes and see
And let the Raga take you far away
Fade into the light
A magic carpet ride into your mind
Electric Raga from an ancient time
If you feel like I do, please take my hand
Enter the secret land.
