Everyday I work my fingers to the bone
I'm a beast of burden so give me some heavy load
Obsessive and compulsive head banging against a wall
I won't give up without a fight before I fall

Punch in the face
Take the blow
Stand up, strike back
Here it comes

Skull crusher - Can you feel the pain
Skull crusher - Here it comes again

Grave diggers will pull the triggers and eat your peace of mind
Just keep walking as they are stalking and leave them all behind
The smell of blood brings back so many memories
No time for flash backs now, so raise your fist and scream

Punch in the face
Take the blow
Stand up, strike back
Here it comes

Skull crusher - Can you feel the pain
Skull crusher - Here it comes again

Skull crusher - Can you feel the pain
Skull crusher - Here it comes again
Skull crusher - Here comes the pain
Skull crusher - Here comes the pain
Skull crusher
