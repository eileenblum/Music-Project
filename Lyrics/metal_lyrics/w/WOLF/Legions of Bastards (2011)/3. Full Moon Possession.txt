Master of faster
The prince of desire
Launching the rocket to the sky
Sin, self-afflicted 
The snake is constricted
Mischievous deeds on the rise

My purgatory is here right before me
I stand in Gehenna, waiting for rain

Rain
It's a full moon possession

Hiding and sneaking
Looking for something
That I aren't supposed to see
My fantasy's peaking
The looks that I'm stealing
That I aren't supposed to steal

My purgatory is here right before me
I stand in Gehenna, waiting for rain

Rain
It's a full moon possession

Look out
I'm coming now
Full moon
