Don't go near it, can't you read the signs
Don't believe it, can't you realize
Don't receive him, don't believe the false preacher
The false preacher 

Here's a spade for you, now dig into the ground
That's your grave, now won't you jump right in and smile
Don't you see it, do you agree it's the false preacher
The false preacher 

We watch our life fade away
We watch it fade to grey

Life's mysterious, come walk with me
Lies we tell turn to strange fantasies 
You must swallow and you will follow the false preacher
The false preacher 

We watch our life fade away
We watch it fade to grey
We watch our life fade away
All of it fade to grey  

Preacher
The False preacher

We watch our life fade away
We watch it fade to grey
We watch our life fade away
All of it fade to grey
