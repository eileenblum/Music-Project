Devil inside me
I've got you under my skin
Devil can you not see
What you're doing to me?
No

Absinthe 
Ahh...

Mr, can you see?
Sister, can you hear?
Now I, now I can feel
The end coming near

Absinthe

Time and again I've been looking for you till I'm going blind
I think that you're hiding from me just to see if I lose my mind

Jesus, are you for real?
Don't play your tricks on me
Satan, that goes for you too
Who are you trying to fool?
Yeah

Absinthe
