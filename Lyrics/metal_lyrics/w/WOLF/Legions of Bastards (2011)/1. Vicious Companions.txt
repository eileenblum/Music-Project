You - never are contaminating the scene 
You're a rotten disease
Lies - you're the expert of bending the truth
Just to satisfy your never ending needs again
Ready to take a bite
In the hand that feeds again
To taste my sweat and blood

Whore - yes you're trying to make me you whore
Dependant on you
Burn - in the end in my fire you'll burn
And I know that you're after my dreams again
It's lucrative business indeed
Scheming chameleon
Dependant on my blood

You're running my heart into stone
So bad, so cold, so evil
You're running my heart into stone
So bad, so cold, 
You're running my heart into stone

You're running my heart into stone
So bad, so cold, so evil
You're running my heart into stone
So bad, so cold, so evil
You're running my heart into stone
So bad, so cold
You're running my heart into stone
Stone
To stone
Born out of evil
You're turning my heart into stone
