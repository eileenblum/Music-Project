The road to freedom is burning
And mankind is going to hell
High pressure is starting to build up
To explosion in every cell

The leader is leading the fools into the sea
Exclusive illusion, join the church of thieves

The shepherd is hungry for power
And feed on the blood of the sheep
I'm starting a brand new religion 
'Cause that's where the real money is

The leader is leading the fools into the sea
Exclusive illusion, join the church of thieves
On our road to hell
To hell

Come and take part in our vision
In our perverted crusade
With our fingers deep in your pockets
Stealing your mind away

The leader is leading the fools into the sea
Exclusive illusion, join the church of thieves
On our road to hell
To hell
Yes, to hell
Join the church
Down the road to hell
To hell
