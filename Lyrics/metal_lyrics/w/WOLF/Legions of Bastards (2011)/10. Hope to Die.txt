What goes on behind closed doors
What happens when lights are out
Do you feel the powers that be
Can you feel the hands' round your neck

Let's dance around the fire
And revel the beast
Switch off your mind for a second 
And receive 

Let me in on your secret 
I am dying to find out

Candles burning in the night
The masters gather in the dark
Do you feel drawn towards the moon
Can you feel your hands are tied

All chant around the fire
Hands to the sky
Switch off your mind for a second 
And receive 

Let me in on your secret 
I am dying to find out 
I can keep a little secret 
Cross my heart and hope to die

Let me inside
Take me inside
Let me inside
Inside of you
