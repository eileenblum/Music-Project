Sleep, sleep little one
Close your eyes come to rest
Deep, deep, now my son
In the spider's web

Dream, dream
Forever lost in Nevermore
Dream, dream
It's darker than ever before

Nightmare is crawling nigh
Reaching deep in your mind
Light fairies lost their way
As you are lost in the night

Dream, dream
Forever lost in Nevermore
Dream, dream
It's darker than ever before

Going down, deep under the surface
Buried in the ashes of a lost eternity
Wake up, you cannot move
Held by invisible hands
Wake up, inside your tomb
To find yourself asleep again

Shiver, tremble
Nailed to the bed
No air no where
Spasmodic panic
Going insane
Blinded, voiceless
