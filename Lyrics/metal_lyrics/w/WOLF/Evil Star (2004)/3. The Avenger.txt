Moving silent, through the rain
Don't think I'll be home again
There's just no way back
And I think just to forget
The life I lived, the tears I wept
Now it's all behind

I could take your life with ease
Snap your spine in the autumn breeze
Whispering my name
No truth unspoiled, no lie untold
Your blood's still warm, but mine is cold

I could never change my ways
And I've never been astray
Although my road is dark
You lost your way long ago
The perversion just went on
Until all hope was gone

Moving, silent, through the rain
Don't think I'll be home again

When I'm near
Sense the fear
I can feel your heart rate turn around
What's that sound?
Know for sure when it's too late
I may be there
When least expected
If you breathe, it's because of me
So unaware of my plans
And I just might change my mind

You may not see my point of view
But believe me I am true
And I can make you see
It will be clear and come to you
From down on your knees

Breath by breath, step by step
Perhaps the next one is the last
Moving, silent, through the rain
Don't think I'll be home again
