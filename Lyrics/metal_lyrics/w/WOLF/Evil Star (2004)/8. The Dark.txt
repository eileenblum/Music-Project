I hear loud and clear
Inside my darkened mind
He whispers to my ear
Come closer
My friend, this'll be the end
Heed my advice
The world is coming to an end
Black moon will rise

A vivid vision, or superstition?
I see it clearly now
It seems so real and true to me
And I believe it now
No one sees what I see
They refuse to believe
They'll be aware when the time is right
And read about my deeds

There may be shadows in my mind
But things aren't right I've seen the sign

Searching for answers in the mirror
I see a mystery
Bits and pieces coming together
In the prophecy
You know I will follow
And I don't care what they say
Lets go where you lead me
Until my final day

There may be shadows in my mind
But things aren't right I've seen the sign

I am deranged, I have lost my mind
But I know there's a hole in time
Confusion, illusion
I'll find a way to the other side
Rewind, turn back time
I'm not afraid to die
His advice is my demise
Unholy sacrifice

There may be shadows in my mind
But things aren't right I've seen the sign
Inside my mind, there may be shadows
But it's the shadows of the sign
