My skin, it feels one size too small
My body aches and my senses fade away
I see it now, it's crystal clear
When night descends the wolf inside me looms

Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?
I am calling
Deep inside the darkness of your soul

The yellow moon that will arise
Shall transform into a sinister device
The stars that twinkle in the skies
May turn out to be the serpent's eyes

Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?
I am calling
Deep inside the darkness of your soul

Next time when the moon is full
Don't ever walk alone
You'll never know when I'm coming for you

Can you hear me?
I can hear thee
Can you feel me?
I can feel thee

You are calling
Deep inside the darkness of my soul
It's raining blood in my heart
The beast is out of control
Raging in the darkness of my soul

I can hear thee
