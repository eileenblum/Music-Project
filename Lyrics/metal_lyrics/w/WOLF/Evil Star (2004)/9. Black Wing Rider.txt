Soul consuming fires of sorrow
Sanity burns down in flames
Mind-eater cuts deeper and deeper
Blindfolded words lost in space

Struggling screams trapped in silence
Lungs of vacuum can't breathe
Oxygen turns into poison
An abyss wide open beneath

So lost inside this emptiness
A dark caress
And I can see
Those black wings coming for me

Universe will explode and I will transcend
True friend oblivion waits at the end
The light at the end of the tunnel grows closer and then
One million pieces of nothing I finally am

The shadow of tomorrow is burning
The lost sunset fades into grey
On the edge of existence I'm standing
Letting myself slip away

So lost inside this emptiness
A dark caress
And I can see
Those black wings coming for me

So lost inside this emptiness
A dark caress
All I see
Those black wings coming for me
