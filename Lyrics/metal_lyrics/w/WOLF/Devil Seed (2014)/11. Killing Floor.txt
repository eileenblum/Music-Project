The book is read
The fire's dead
Remaining ashes show the beginning of the end
The tide has come
To spare no one
This is the onset of pandemonium

Vengeance
Vengeance calling
Vengeance

Vengeance
Vengeance calling
Vengeance

There's a time to learn
And a time to burn
The waves are coming in to wipe away your kind
Now it's too late
There's no escape
I see the Reaper ride across the sky

Vengeance
Vengeance calling
Vengeance

Vengeance
Vengeance calling
Vengeance
