There's a skeleton in every closet
That we mustn't display
Dirty secrets and shameful desires
We must hide away
Oh, won't you come inside

Collecting skulls, collecting bones
Stripping meat, eating souls
Collecting skulls, assembling bones
Feed me, I want your soul

I'm the chemical in lethal injection
I want you to taste my wine
And I'm a cannibal seeking perfection
My fingers run down your spine
Oh, you're so fine

Collecting skulls, collecting bones
Stripping meat, eating souls
Collecting skulls, assembling bones
Feed me, I want your soul

They never look me in the eye
Why do you turn your face away from me
I am a man you can't deny
Just want to feel my hand inside your skin

I want you
I need you
I'll touch you
Mmm...
And I'll make you perfect
Don't deny me
'Cause I need you for my collection

Collecting skulls, collecting bones
Stripping meat, eating souls
Collecting skulls, assembling bones
Feed me, Feed me
I want your soul
I need your bones
I want your soul

There's a skeleton in every closet
