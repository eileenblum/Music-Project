Breaking the waves like a cutthroat razor
Bringer of death from the deep
Emerging from darkness a stone cold killer
The predator launches to strike

Crimson slaughter in holy water
You are never coming back

Shark attack
Warning, warning
Shark attack
Warning

Cold eyes are watching your every move
A glimmer of teeth in the dark
When time is right they will rise to the surface
Breaking your neck like a stick

Take one step down in the food chain
You are never coming back

Shark attack
Warning, warning
Shark attack
Warning

Look over your shoulder
They're coming to get you
Look over your shoulder
They're coming for you

So beware, there is a charging predator
Ready to strike behind your back

Shark attack
Warning, warning
Shark attack
Warning
