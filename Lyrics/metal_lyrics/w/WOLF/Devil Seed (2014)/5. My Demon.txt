And so the night begins to close your eyes
And your reality will dematerialize
Just wait, hold your breath, sharpen every sense
Can you believe your fear, he's near

My demon
See him come with the night
My demon
Receive him
Now come with the night

Tonight
Come, come tonight
Tonight
Come, come tonight

We'll make the angels turn away their eyes
You see my devil seed about to materialize
I've got you in my hand, surround you like the dark
Rest assure that I will never let go

My demon
See him come with the night
My demon
Receive him
Now come with the night

Demon
See him come with the night
My demon
Believe him
Receive him
Now come, come tonight

And so the night begins to close your eyes
And your reality will dematerialize
Just wait, hold your breath, sharpen every sense
Can you believe, believe he's near

My demon
See him come with the night
My demon
Receive him
Now come with the night

Demon
See him come with the night
My demon
Oh, feel him
Believe him
Now come, come tonight, tonight
Come, come, come tonight, tonight
Come, come, come tonight
