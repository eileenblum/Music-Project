The fools deny me or they try to hide me away
Though I am inside them, there to guide them
Through the Haze
Try to defeat me, I will eat you in the end
Now open your eyes and see the best friend
You ever had

I'm pain
Pain
I am pain
Just your pain

I am the mother of all eternity
And I will unlock the door for those who come
To me
A seed inside my children planted in the womb
The only key that can unlock you from the tomb

Is pain
Pain
I am pain
Just your pain

I'm here for you
No matter what you say or do I'm here to stay
And keep you company in the dark

Pain
Pain
I am pain
Just your pain
Pain
Pain
Don't be afraid
It's just your pain
