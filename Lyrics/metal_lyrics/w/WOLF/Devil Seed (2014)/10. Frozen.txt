My friend
My friend has been frozen
His blank eyes stare at the wall

Disappearing in a growing distance
Hiding behind a wall of ice
I put my hands against the wall
It's so cold

My friend is frozen
Frozen

Blame has lost all its meaning
And pain has become the escape

Oh, paralysed inside a crippled mind
Hiding away inside a void
I try to find something beyond the ice
It's nothing there

My friend is frozen

Words can turn into poison
Silence is what we can share

I leave you there to your frozen stare
There's nothing for me inside your void
I can't stay, this is not my path
Good bye my friend

I leave you frozen
Frozen
Frozen
Frozen
