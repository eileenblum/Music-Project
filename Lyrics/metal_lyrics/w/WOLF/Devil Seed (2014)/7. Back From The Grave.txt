Did you think it was the end - think again
It's a fact that you can never kill me twice
I can feel it rising like a beast within
There are always things that will refuse to die

Let's bring it back to life
Into life

See a new day dawning, this is not the end
Never say forever, never pronounce me dead
I can take another shape and transcend
You have only made me reinvent myself

So let's bring it back to life
I'm alive

I'm alive
I found my way back from the grave
Now behold my resurrection
I'm alive
Unstoppable like rapid fire
I'll never return to the grave

Oh, it's alive
It's alive
Unstoppable like rapid fire
