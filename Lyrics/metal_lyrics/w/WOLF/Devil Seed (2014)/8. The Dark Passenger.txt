Do you remember
Can you recall
Can you dig deep in your soul ?

I never left you
Never betrayed
I was waiting for you to come through

We are one
I am you
Do you see
You are me

We are companions
Partners in crime
In the face of evil
So your face can shine

Walking in shadow
Side by side
Invisible shadow
I'll be your guide

We are one
I am you
Do you see
You are me
Set me free

I'll never leave
Never betray
I am your shadow
Your dark passenger

I'll never leave
Never betray
I am your shadow
Your dark passenger
