Twenty years out of reach
Now it's coming back to me
Still remember
Can't forget all those haunting memories

The echoes ring in my ears
Oh, I can't resist

By the river she is calling
From the shadows and the mist
I can't help myself from falling
In the river Everlost

Every time I come back
I find my mind is turning blank
I stand frozen, cannot move
She is always in control

By the river she is calling
From the shadows and the mist
I can't help myself from falling
In the river Everlost
By the river 
She's calling me
I can hear her
Oh, she's calling, calling
I'm never to return
