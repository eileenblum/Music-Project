Screaming this bitter curse
I pray you die alone [2x]

Let it be know

I despise the person
You've become

You are a fucking parasite
You are the reason I can't sleep at night

Tonight's the night we end this
It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath

Say goodbye to all you love
Your death will be my legacy

With the blood of a child on your hands

You call this victory
Look how everyone's abandoned you

Live your life in misery

Face the facts
You fucked up

Hang your head
Fuck your life [2x]

I am so fucking done with this

So fucking done with you

You're a fucking disgrace
Every action has a consequence

You'll get what you deserve in the end
You've crossed the fucking line once again

Suffer the shame

You're exactly where you deserve to be
And I hope you rot down there

I hope you rot down there
In the grave you've dug for yourself [2x]
