Nothing stays buried forever

Run for your lives
Dark days are here to stay

Look to the skies
No-one will fucking save you now

Can you feel the rising tide?
As it chokes your life away

Can you see the walls are closing in
You never had a chance baby

I hope I haunt you

For the rest of your days
Know regret

When you hear my name
I hope I haunt you

For the rest of your days
Know regret

When you see my fucking face

I will fucking end you
Sluts like you deserve shallow graves

I will fucking end you
Cunts like you never learn from their mistakes

I hope they find you

Raped and beaten
Bound and gagged and

Barely breathing
Please survive the ordeal

So you know what it's like to feel
Some semblance of humanity

Board up your fucking windows

Pray you see daylight

Board up your windows
Pray you see daylight [2x]

There is no surviving this

Fuck you and your happy endings [2x]

As your casket collapses
Caved in by the weight of the earth [2x]

Another bitch in a bodybag

Another whore in the ground [2x]
