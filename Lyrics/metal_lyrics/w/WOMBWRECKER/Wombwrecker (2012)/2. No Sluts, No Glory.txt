I've met girls like you before
You think you're special but you're just another whore
I hope when reality hits
You finally put away those nasty ass tits, oh
There is more to life than just hair extensions
GIFs of kittens on Tumblr
It's time you got some perspective
There are so many lessons, you have to learn

Dragging your lifeless body
Down to the lake
They won't find you for days

Lust has betrayed me
For the last time

I'm so sick of feeling nothing for you
When i look into your hollow eyes
I can feel the blackness washing over me
So this is what it's like to lose control

Taking a hammer to your face
Now i can see what's really on your mind
Taking a hammer to your face
Let's see you blog about this

Time will bury us all [2x]
I can feel this all coming apart [2x]
