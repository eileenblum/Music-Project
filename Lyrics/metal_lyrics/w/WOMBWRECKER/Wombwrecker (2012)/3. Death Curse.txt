I believe in nothing
This world holds no truth for me

To the deserters
May your dreams rot and wither away

I'm so sick of this blank existence

Living a life with no progress
We leave no mark when are gone

Deaths cold hands

Have their hold on me
Deaths cold hands

Are gripping around my throat

It's the end of the world
And the streets are filled with panic

You can run, you can hide
But in the end

No one gets out alive

We live in fractured times
There is no faith in anything [2x]

Fuck

I've lived out all my failures

I've watched my hopes die
You can save me your sob stories

Everyones got a story to tell
Can you feel this

Dread is rising
It's the end of the world

We leave no mark when we are gone

We leave no mark when we are gone [2x]
