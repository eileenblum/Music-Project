Dear lover
I built your tomb
A monument to the promises broken

It's such a shame that it has had to come to this
You should know by now that you are nothing but heartless
Walk away from everything we built together
Who will you run to when your world comes crashing down

I must admit I've had sleepless nights [2x]
Wake the fuck up.

Don't look back at the carnage
You won't recognise the man I am now
When everything dies around you
These are the moments that define

Don't look back
Walk away
Don't look back
Run away

Coward

Everything I've lost
Still holds me back
Holds me back [2x]

I need to wake up
I need to keep pushing forward

So what you're a brand new person
With a clean slate and a fresh start
I guess the shit you put up your nose
Has fucked you're brain as well as your heart
If I could take back
All the time I wasted
All the tears that I shed
Id do it in a heartbeat
In a heartbeat

Five long years
I will never get back
Five long years
I will never get back

You can keep searching
You'll never find what you're looking for
Keep searching
You'll never find what you're looking for
