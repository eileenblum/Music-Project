[Verse]
They say I maybe crazy
I only say I've had my fill
They say I'll throw it all away
I probably will
They'll only give you what you're taking
But lately I've been unfulfilled
They say I'll probably blow it off someday
I probably will

[Chorus]
The way they talk about each other
The way they talk about themselves
Well they could talk, talk, talk forever
And they probably will
You know they probably will

[Verse]
Now I'm not really bitter
You know I'm just a little chilled
They say that things can just get better
And they probably will
And they will only make us stronger
If they should try to keep us still
And we could rise and take it all
Someday we probably will

[Chorus]
The way they talk about each other
The way you talk about yourselves
Well you can talk, talk, talk forever
And you probably will
You know you probably will

[Outro]
And they will only make us stronger
If they should try to keep us still
And we could rise and take it all
Someday we probably will
You know you probably will
