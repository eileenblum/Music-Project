[Intro]
One life we get one chance
Kill the past and just keep giving it back
If we fall we will still prevail
Stand up and take over the world

[Verse]
How will it go, how will it end
If I should take back that moment and do it all again
Can't you see beyond your selfish ways
To help make this world a better place
Save someone's pain, save someone's pain

[Chorus]
One life we get one chance
Kill the past and just keep giving it back
If we fall we will still prevail
Stand up and take over the world

[Verse]
Time is ticking which way will it go
We only get one chance to help each other grow
We get one chance
No more drowning in a world of lifeless greed
Time is ticking to judge our ending
Time is ticking to set us free, to set us free

[Chorus 4x]
One life we get one chance
Kill the past and just keep giving it back
If we fall we will still prevail
Stand up and take over the world
