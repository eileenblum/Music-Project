[Verse]
There are no words that can soothe
Console or uplift
This is going to burn like a knife in the chest
Say goodbye lost hopes, false dreams
This nightmare will try and take everything

[Pre-Chorus]
World gone cold
New values born
In the face of death we carry on
Swallow pain let hate dissolve
World gone cold
New values born

[Chorus 2x]
Where is the love? (love)
It's in the face young
The spitting image of us
Where is the justice? (justice)
It's in facing the fear as we overcome

[Verse]
You've come to far to turn back now
Breakthrough end of all self doubt
I am the universe wrapped within
Life ends as it begins

[Pre-Chorus]
World gone cold
New values born
In the face of death we carry on
Swallow pain let hate dissolve
World gone cold
New values born

[Chorus 2x]
Where is the love? (love)
It's in the face young
The spitting image of us
Where is the justice? (justice)
It's in facing the fear as we overcome

[Outro]
I'm overcoming all this violence
I am the universe wrapped within
Life it ends as it begins
Violent, violent
I am the universe wrapped within
Violent
Life it ends as it begins
Violent
I am the universe wrapped within
Violent
It begins again
