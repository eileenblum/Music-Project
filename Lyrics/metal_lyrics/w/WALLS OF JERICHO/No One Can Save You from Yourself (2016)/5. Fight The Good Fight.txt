[Verse]
I walk the path everyday
That crashes down upon me
And suffocates my breath
And leaves me left for dead
I'll grab life by the throat
And make it my own
To rise above the ashes into the unknown

[Pre-chorus]
So hear and now
We won't back down
I will not be the victim or crucify myself
I'll break these fucking chains
And burn this fucker down

[Chorus]
Take hold of what's right
It's how you choose to live your life that counts
Fight the good fight
It's how you choose to live your life that counts
Let's go

Don't be fooled
It's not just you
We all have dreams that don't come true
But will it stop you /stop you)?

Fight or die
Fight or die
That's how I want to live my life
It won't stop me
And I will die to take hold of what is mine

[Pre-chorus]
So hear and now
We won't back down
I will not be the victim or crucify myself
I'll break these fucking chains
And burn this fucker down

[Chorus]
Take hold of what's right
It's how you choose to live your life that counts
Fight the good fight
It's how you choose to live your life that counts

[Outro]
In the end
All that matters
Is that you did what counts

That counts [2x]
