[Intro]
When that day comes
I hope it was worth it
When that day comes
I hope you gave it your all

[Verse]
Your betrayal have a life of it's own
These roots grow deeper
With every breath that I hold
You'll never know what I know
But you spin it to believe it
This fire still burning
And with time hate will fuel my journey

[Pre-Chorus]
When that day comes
I hope it was worth it
When that day comes
I hope you gave it your all

[Chorus]
I will go down in history or I'll go down in flames
Our legacy will live in you won't forget my name

[Verse]
Your desperation for glory
Striving for more than your worth
I've built a legacy
God like strength empowers me
I'll reign supreme

[Pre-Chorus]
When that day comes
I hope it was worth it
When that day comes
I hope you gave it your all

[Chorus 2x]
I will go down in history or I'll go down in flames
Our legacy will live in you won't forget my name

[Bridge]
When that day comes
I hope it was worth it
When that day comes
I hope you gave it your all

[Outro]
I will go down in history or I'll go down in flames
Our legacy will live in you won't forget my name
