[Intro]
I am relentless

We will never stop
We're relentless
We will never give up
We're relentless
We will never give up
We're relentless
We will never stop
We're relentless

[Verse]
Now is the time
Fight for your life
The devil is real inside hungry for our time
He waits to prey on all our lives
Night or day waiting behind
Every thought inside our mind
This despair is catching his eye
The coward strike when he sees our eyes
Are closed tight blocking the light
It brings the strength to fight

[Chorus]
Relentless
I got fight like a champion
Relentless
Those that have fallen will not be forgotten by me

[Verse]
Now is the time
Fight for your life
Through the dark I see the light
Stay relentless through troubled times
Those that fell my guiding light
My north star through my hardest plight
This disease is just a battleground
The earth will quack when it
Hears the sound of my heart beating so true
I am the victor through and through

[Chorus]
Relentless
I got fight like a champion
Relentless
And I'll be the victor 'till the end
Relentless
I got fight like a champion
Relentless
And those that have fallen will not be forgotten by me

[Outro]
Without struggle
There is no strength
Without struggle
There is no strength
So god grant me strength

So god grant me strength (strength, strength) [5x]
