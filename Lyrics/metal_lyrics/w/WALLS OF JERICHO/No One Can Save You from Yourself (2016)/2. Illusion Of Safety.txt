[Intro]
No (no) prison
Can stop this

The illusion of safety has been compromised
The Business of violence has been felt worldwide
The illusion of safety has been compromised
The Business of violence has been felt worldwide

In moments you can choose not to die
Pushed out of sight but not mind
Seek truth when forced from the light
Justified violence will be discuised
Don't think for a second that you've had a say
It's been forced down your throat
Since the beginning
Don't think for a second that you've had a say
It's been forced down your throat

The illusion of safety has been compromised
And all this violence has been felt worldwide
The illusion of safety has been compromised
And all this violence has been felt worldwide

I will resist lies sold in my name
I will resist my enemies by any means
