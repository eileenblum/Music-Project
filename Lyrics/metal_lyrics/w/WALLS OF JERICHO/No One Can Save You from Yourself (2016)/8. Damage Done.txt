[Verse]
It doesn't take much
To shut it down
When you're armed to the teeth
With a broken mouth
I will refuse
To let you see this through
Your self-entitlement weighs heavy on another's head
Passing blame is the way they made you
Excuse lost no one cares to save you

Now you feel
The damage done

[Chorus]
Who's to blame?
Were all guilty and insane
Kill pain
The best we can with the weight of the world
Who's to blame?
Are you willing to change?
Despite pain?
It's never easy when the way of the world
Is inhumane
The damage
The damage done
The forgotten one

[Verse]
It doesn't take much
To perpetuate ignorance
The thought of being stuck
Makes you want to self-destruct
Self-entitlement
Another product of your environment
Passing blame is they way they made you
Excuse lost no one cares to save you

Now you feel
The damage done

[Chorus]
Who's to blame?
Were all guilty and insane
Kill pain
The best we can with the weight of the world
Who's to blame?
Are you willing to change?
Despite pain?
It's never easy when the way of the world
Is inhumane
The damage
The damage done
The forgotten one

[Outro]
The damage done
The forgotten one
The damage
The damage done
Introspective
(The damage)
Depth perception
(The damage)
True perspective
(The damage)
Is neglected
The damage done
