[Intro]
Enough of this rhetoric
The Enemy you seek, you won't find in me
Look towards the solution
Stop hating everything, everyday, everyday

[Verse]
Stand strong all hope is not lost
Push on for those who got signals crossed
Hearts stomped on
A greater purpose, a higher cause
Not one that's been sent from above

[Pre-Chorus]
No one can save you from yourself
No one can free you from yourself
No one, you don't need any help, no

[Chorus 2x]
You can't faze me, this is the turning point
I keep my mind on track, I'm not your enemy
This is the turning point, I'm never looking back

[Verse]
Enough of this rhetoric
The enemy you seek, you won't find in me
Look towards the solution
Stop hating everything
You take the easy way out
Kill the negativity that you keep around
This is your chance. Question everything
There's a better way, don't keep sinking

[Pre-Chorus]
No one can save you from yourself
No one can free you from yourself
No one, you don't need any help, no

[Chorus 2x]
You can't faze me, this is the turning point
I keep my mind on track, I'm not your enemy
This is the turning point, I'm never looking back

[Bridge]
This is your life
This is your chance to live. We're so alive
So let's fucking live

[Outro]
This is the turning point
All hope is not lost. Whatever the cost
This is the turning point
All hope is not lost
And there will be a cost
This is the turning point

This is the turning point
