[Intro]
Once again I face this world
Broken and bruised again
I have walked through the gates of hell
And we've only just begun

[Verse]
Came up short let it slip through my finger
'till i hated who I saw in the mirror
Lost all hope for the shit I let linger
Bore down to break my shoulders
Love these scares because I earned them on my terms
All the cuts and scraps and the deep burns
I walk proud every corner that I turn, stand up
And break the barriers

[Pre-chorus]
Again on my own
I walk alone

[Chorus]
Once again I face this world
Broken and bruised again
I have walked through the gates of hell
And we've only just begun

Time is now
Wipe this shit off my shoulders
My minds set getting stronger and stronger
I won't stop 'till this city is burning
These flames light my journey

Stare right though the enemy in my way
I'm already seeing signs of a brighter day
Take that step in getting stronger in my fight
Victory is all I see in my sights

[Pre-chorus]
Again on my own
I walk alone

[Chorus]
Once again I face this world
Broken and bruised again
I have walked through the gates of hell
And we've only just begun
Forward infinite
Keep the past distant
Forever militant

[Bridge]
We build walls to - keep everybody out
We build walls to - stop all the pain
We build walls to - keep our self-suffering we build walls
Tear down these fucking walls

[Chorus]
Once again I face this world
Broken and bruised again
I have walked through the gates of hell
And we've only just begun
Forward infinite
Keep the past distant
Forever militant

Hold on to the passion that you have left
