Beyond all praise!

[Verse]
Does it resonate?
Can you feel it shake you to the core?
Is it love that drives you
Or are you searching for something more?
I won't live the way that I have in the past
Seeking out the love that won't last
I've made this promise to myself
It will be felt

[Chorus]
It's in all of us. You and I
We warp reality. Don't seek praise
It's in all of us. You and I
Manipulate, create or dig your grave
It's in all of us. You and I
We warp reality. Don't seek praise
It's in all of us. You and I
Manipulate, create or digging your own fucking grave

Feel the shift
Feel the shift of consciousness

[Verse]
Unconsciousness
Now we feel the consequence
New level of consciousness and full of confidence
I must love this way fuck mistakes of the past
Seeking recognition won't last
I've made this promise to myself
And no one else

[Chorus]
It's in all of us. You and I
We warp reality. Don't seek praise
It's in all of us. You and I
Manipulate, create or dig your grave
It's in all of us. You and I
We warp reality. Don't seek praise
It's in all of us. You and I
Manipulate, create or digging your own fucking grave

[Bridge]
I've made this promise to myself
And no one else
I've made this promise to myself

[Outro 7x]
Beyond all praise
