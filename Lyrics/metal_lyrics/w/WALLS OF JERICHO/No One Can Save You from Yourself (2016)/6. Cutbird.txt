[Intro]
My blood, my breath
My heart will bleed
My blood, my breath
My heart will bleed eternity

[Verse]
I welcome the wave when it crashes
Miss it if it's gone to long
Daily struggle of hate and sadness
But the pain keep me strong

There has never been another
One so true
And I will live life loving like you
Our hearts will bleed eternity

[Chorus]
There is beauty in this
You just have to find it
And the beauty is I survived it
There is beauty in this
You just have to find it
And the beauty is I survived it

[Bridge]
[?]

[Verse]
You've inspired a life worth creating
A passion that will grow forever
And is worth chasing
Our hearts will bleed
Our hearts will bleed eternity

[Chorus]
There is beauty in this
You just have to find it
And the beauty is I survived it
There is beauty in this
You just have to find it
And the beauty is I survived it

[Bridge]
I will seize this moment and put trust
And faith in the torment

[Chorus]
There is beauty in this
You just have to find it
And the beauty is I survived it
There is beauty in this
You just have to find it
And the beauty is I survived it
