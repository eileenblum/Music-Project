times have tried 
now you and I must complete the cycle 
when equality cant be built in a day 
where do we go from there? 
to divide us is to separate 
let's turn and start again 
where do we go from here? 
every opportunity is there 
when standards can be met 
because the difference is what you and I make of it 
break it down - I'll try if you try 
but equality can't be built in a day 
so I'll follow with time on my side 
I'll keep trying while you push through this wall that you let divide 
you and I
