you were there when I cried - I screamed 
It would not be forgotten 
A slave to the poison that dragged us down 
We must suffer for your fucking incapabilities 
And she could not see you destroy her 
I can't even grasp the pictures that 
you implanted in my mind 
Must overcome and impale you with 
the epitomes of your actions 
We loved so much 
Now I won't let myself hate you less 
Now you're dead 
You haven't suffered enough 
I wish I could have been the one 
who crushed your heart 
With my despaired hand letting 
your unruly blood flow 
And your burned flesh lie collapsed 
Are you proud?
