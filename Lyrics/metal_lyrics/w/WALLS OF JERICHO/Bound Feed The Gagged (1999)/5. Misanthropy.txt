and what am I to you? 
hopefully not a piece of misconception 
that life's rule has pounded into your head 
why is there a difference? 
why is it appealing? 
pain - oppression 
you're feeding off our insecurities 
they're living off your fucking tyrannical lies 
how can you degrade the ones 
you've claimed to love? 
how can you degrade the ones 
you've claimed to call equal? 
and you think our pleasure justifies our 
self destruction that you've 
bought into here, let me strip down to my bare skin let 
me show you what you call equal 
a rotting corpse is what you will have 
left in your hand 
it used to be equable but you won't conceive of it 
you defy it
