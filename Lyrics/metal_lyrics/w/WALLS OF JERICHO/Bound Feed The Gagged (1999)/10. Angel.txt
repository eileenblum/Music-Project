I stare as my weak knees wilt 
longing trying to touch the embrace that has left me 
and I had you 
and your kindness was there 
now pieces of you hate me 
I am not a portrait on your heart no more 
but I still kiss the feelings that emerge from my pulse 
and memories seep from my eyes 
knowing that love has gone further 
than my soft hand can reach 
the utmost apology is what I can lay on your face but 
will you still swallow me whole? 
nothing can compare 
and you continue to dance in me 
and I continue to bleed 
but nothing can compare 
I have killed the one thing that exceeds my existence
