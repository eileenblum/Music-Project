thin lines stand side to side while 
the cries of millions pile up 
their social structure declined 
ripped down from forceful hands 
as their tongues replenish silence 
you tore their virtue out with bare empty hands 
portraying what was dominated in your past 
you laid it down with the intent of compromise 
a life filled with the remaining memories 
how can you give us the pain? 
what thrives in you to proceed? 
chrome cut eyes will not hold obliterating energy 
blood soaked cavity collapses from annihilation


Thanks to throwupnchoke for correcting track #1 lyrics.
