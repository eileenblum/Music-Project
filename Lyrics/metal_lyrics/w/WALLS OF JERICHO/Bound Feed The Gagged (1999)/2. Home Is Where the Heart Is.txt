do you ever want to leave yourself 
and let misfortune take your soul? 
worthless heavy heart 
as I turn the switch and throw it away 
misery seeps on my skin and I sit and stare 
numb and mute 
can anything else I touch break? 
carry me away pain 
look through the framework and impale my disgust 
mistrust 
I have nothing 
none of it 
please join in, but do you deserve it? 
I beat fulfillment into white walls 
fuck it we all cry and hate life as we choose it 
bit by bit by broken piece we kill it 
we grasp heavily as blood and 
tears drip through our hands 
the light in my eyes 
unsettled in my actions 
kill them
