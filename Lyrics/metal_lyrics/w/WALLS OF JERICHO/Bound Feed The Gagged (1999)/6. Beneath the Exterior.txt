now I feel my tears shredding through my skin 
my convictions seep into my open wounds 
as the idea you've pressed on me 
are the fears that I bury within my 
distorted thoughts as this tear runs down 
my structured face 
images of your impulsive greed shreds my existence 
as your hands give life to the razors that 
slice my violated throat 
how to comprehend that nightmare you so willingly 
helped me fall in debt 
to what appeased you? 
answer me that 
piece by piece it slowly deteriorates 
my sanity if any is left
