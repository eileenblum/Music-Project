numbers of descendants
segregated by design
caught up in a purpose that disgraces their standards [X2]
eliminate the source but do not destroy the fighters
these actions wont help us end our fight
progress cant be made by weeding out the majority
the color of the oppressor is only
the shortcoming of the disaster
eliminate the source but do not destroy the fighters
end the sinister accusations
acknowledge the foresight in which we hold [X2]
to end oppression - doing it in an uneducated
way is not going to end it
it's going to enforce ones reputation
in a disgraceful manner
to segregate us by color would be antithetical to
what we are trying to accomplish
progress cant be made by weeding out the majority
