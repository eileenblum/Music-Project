why is it that we open our flesh based statue to 
minds that easily forget? 
I remain torn from the hand that I would 
have placed on my inviting face 
we sacrifice what brought us down 
to indulge in the unknown 
when you meant that much to me 
so did the words that were released from your lips 
but you weren't there 
so i'll pride myself in knowing your false 
proclamation as I build this wall once again 
what is left? 
the fragments coated in sorrow 
an acknowledged entrapment 
I am here to strike you down upon your disgust 
I will marvel in the glorified defeat
