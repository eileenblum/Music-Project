It's time to take back your life
So what if we showed an unbuttoned smile
Could it break the lock to our true thoughts of insecurities
We never speak

How about we love ourselves without underlying hatred
Respect for one another, no battle scars told
That means friends are not come and go
No overwhelming dramatic ending

Feelings we can acknowledge
And finally call our own

We will try, we will try, we will try, we will
It's time to start the change, what do you say
We will try, we will try, we will try, we will
It's time to start the change, our lives at stake

So raise your glass up high, we're through with bitter alibis
Here's to new beginnings, that need no fixing first
Here's to a romantic life of bittersweet compromise
A lifetime full of endings that smile at what were worth

Shout out how you feel, listen to yourself
Throw away pieces your unresolved crash course
Will depend on me, reckless with purpose
Work towards living a life worth living right

We will try, we will try, we will try, we will
It's time to start the change, what do you say
We will try, we will try, we will try, we will try

Here's to new beginnings, that need no fixing first
A life full of endings that smile at what were worth
Here's to new beginnings
Here's to new beginnings
For what it's worth
