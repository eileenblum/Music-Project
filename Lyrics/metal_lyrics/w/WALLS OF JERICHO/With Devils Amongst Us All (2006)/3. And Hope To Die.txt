The world has been against you from day one
Tomorrow never promised, night has just begun
So sing with me, we're all fucked
Cause this is your hell and this is your heaven
Unlearn what you know, burn all you've been given
Cause this is your hell and this is your heaven
Unlearn what you know, burn all that you've been given

I sing this song hoping that you still care (Cause we still care)
That all the broken dreamers are living this nightmare

This was written when my heart and mind defined this contradiction
There was nothing I could have done, those days play on and on
Now I cannot see what's written on your grave
I saw the white flag raised from miles away
Now I cannot see what's written on your grave
I saw the white flag raised from miles away
From miles away

I'm sorry for not being there
Twice in one fucking year

I sing this song hoping that you still care (cause we still care)
That all the broken dreamers are living this nightmare

You, you must have felt so alone
Terrified, terrified of a hollowed home
The only thing hopeless is death
The only thing hopeless is death
Desperate, desperate hope made you cry out
Someone, someone end the pain
The only thing hopeless is death
The only thing hopeless is death
The only thing hopeless is death
The only thing hopeless is death

I sing this song to let them know we care
I sing this song hoping you still care (cause we still care)
That all the broken dreamers are living this nightmare
I sing this song, this nightmare
I sing this song, living this nightmare
