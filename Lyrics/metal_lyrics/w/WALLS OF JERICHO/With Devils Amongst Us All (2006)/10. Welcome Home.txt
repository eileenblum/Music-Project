A mother of three
A woman buried somewhere underneath
Sings a sad lullaby
Forever burned inside their minds

Her nights are diseased
Another one full of whiskey and men
To uphold her complacency

As she's down
On her praying hands and knees
Crying out
Crying out

With her key in hand
She opens where her real night begins
Who could have known
That he pushed the pain this far
WIth a gun and venom in his veins
He screamed, try your best
Save her kids, give her life
Rip open his wrongs that will never be set right

As she's down
On her praying hands and knees
Crying out
Her daughter pleads
Daddy don't

With an itchy trigger
He focused on her instead,
Straight to her head
Shooting straight to her heart

How will this horror end?
Face down, Put up your hands
How will this horror end?
Face down, She holds her head
If she had to relive this
Could she do it again?
