Your mechanical eyes show how empty you are inside
Night after night you walk through the door searching and hoping, rotting and dying
What about this life keeps you going
Are you willing to kill this

One after another you line up to be seen
Hollow, wide eyed, drama queen
Are you willing to kill this cheap creep show

If you are looking for the time of your life you've got it
Searching, searching, hoping, hoping and slowly rotting
If you are looking for the time of your life you've got it
All dolled up your selling and buying lies you buy their lies
Let's kill this cheap creep show

To all the boys and girls with empty mouths and empty hands
What would you give to have it all
To all the boys and girls what
Would you give to have it all

You've got look your best
Dress to impress
If you're going to sell us the perfect, the perfect image
