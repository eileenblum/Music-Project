So we meet again
I wonder why every time I see you
You hold your head up high

So surface, so obvious
You're nothing inside

You are a waste of time
I've had enough
Why don't I help you out
Cause I'm tired of choking down your mouth

Your shallow existence is tired and old

Now you don't have to call me out
That's something I'll proudly do on my own
I have a past, I've made mistakes
Love and lost, hurt a few in my time
I've made some promises
With remorse I fell back on my words
I have only had regrets
If there was no lesson to be learned

And I won't forget the disasters I've counted on most
And I won't let this self-destructive bomb explode

These qualities are mine
I have a few, unlike you
I work to be a better me
You're self righteous
What could you possibly say

Here's to my enemy
I wouldn't have it any other way
Here's to my enemy
I wouldn't have it any other way
