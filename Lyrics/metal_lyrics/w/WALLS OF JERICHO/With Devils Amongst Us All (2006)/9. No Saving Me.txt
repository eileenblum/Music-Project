Inside these broken lines
A disruption of our lives
Insanity kicks in
And all I see is another dead end
So close your eyes
And escape from what you hide

How long will I take to bleed
There is no saving me
How far will you go to hold on

I'm better off cutting my own throat
Hope for once you might hear me
I know I can at least count on the mess never judging me
I'm breaking out from all I've come to be

How long will I take to bleed
There is no saving me
How far will you go to hold on

Alone I've gone through hell and back
Hell and back to try to feel
And there is no saving me

How long will I take to bleed
There is no saving me
How far will you go to hold on

I'm alone
And I've gone through hell and back
Hell and back to try to feel
And there is no saving me
