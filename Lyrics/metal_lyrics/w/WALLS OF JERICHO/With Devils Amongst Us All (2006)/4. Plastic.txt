A damaged past is haunting me
Creeps in, won't let me breathe
I can't quite grasp psychotic thoughts
The troubles lie beneath

We won't back down
It's far too late
Paying the price of endless pain
Our love, our hate
Which on will you embrace

Now I can't pretend
To live this life of plastic happiness
This plastic happiness

Because one chance is all we get to kill the questions in our minds
Just one more chance to turn around this life

Break through the structure that we see
Reach true surroundings that we seek
And force the path we know is right
This won't conquer quietly

We won't back down
It's far too late
Paying the price of endless pain
Our love, our hate
Which on will you embrace

I'm so sad to say I've watched this tragedy take everything away from me
I write these words for my own survival
If you don't hear them then they mean nothing at all
Then they mean nothing at all

I won't live like this
In plastic happiness
I won't live like this
In plastic happiness
I won't live like this
In plastic happiness
I won't live like this
In plastic happiness
