(This is our mission statement to go show world)
(This is our mission statement to your sheltered world)

We must survive

This is a wake up call
To all who shut their eyes
This is our hope,
Hopeless beaten strife

You kill the messenger not to hear it, not to hear it
It doesn't mean it never happened
It doesn't mean it never happened

This is our mission statement to go show the world, go show the world
We must survive
This is our mission statement to go show the world, go show the world
We must survive

We've been dealt
There's nothing left to chance
And the ending of this story
Is not filled with catchy hooks
So save your
It will all be o.k. anthems
And it's not getting any better
No it's not getting any better

This, this is where we stand
I hope you're ready to end this tragedy

This is our mission statement to go show the world, go show the world
We must survive
This is our mission statement to go show the world, go show the world
We must survive
We must survive
We must survive
We must survive
