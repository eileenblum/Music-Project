Let's open this book
One more time, one more time
Turn the page
And bleed from the inside
The haunted secrets
That we find
Are the final chapters
To our lives

Here comes the overwhelming
Tragic fairytale
That never seems to thrive, to thrive
This is the unfortunate mess
That never stood a chance
Someone silence her
Stitch up her wrists of wasted time
Put a bullet in her mind
Nail the casket for the final time

This is what I see staring back at me
Visible failures
We've made into a lovely disaster
Welcome this is your life
This is what I see staring back at me
Visible failures
We've made into a lovely disaster
Welcome this is your life

This is your life

Superhero who is searching 
One true mary kaye smile
Reaching for his one true damsel
With Cupid's arrow of poison desire
One to fuel his fire
Welcome this is your life

This is what I see staring back at me
Visible failures
We've made into a lovely disaster
Welcome this is your life
This is what I see staring back at me
Visible failures
We've made into a lovely disaster
Welcome this is your life

Like them we are much the same
With devils amongst us all
Like them we are much the same
With devils amongst us all
Like them we are much the same
With devils amongst us all
Like them we are much the same
Welcome this is your life

This is your life
