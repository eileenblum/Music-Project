[feat. Corey Taylor]

The tears come strong again.
i wasn't ready for your time to end.
i swear i'd tear this world apart to save you.
i think about that day.
i'd do anything to forget the pain.
when the sky burned and the flowers died.
the flowers died in May.

i can't do this without you.
if i could hold you one more time i'd never let you go.
i can't do this without you.
if i could tell you one more time, that i love you.

i close my eyes.
i see your face.

i hold you in my arms.
angel, your my guardian.
i sing this song so you'll live on forever.
like a storm that rages on a
woman that would not back down.
the day you left will always burn, burn inside my soul.

i can't do this without you.
if i could hold you one more time i'd never let you go.
i can't do this without you.
if i could tell you one more time, that i love you.

i close my eyes.
i see your face.

i can't do this without you.
if i could hold you one more time i'd never let you go.
i can't do this without you.
if i could tell you one more time, that i love you.

i close my eyes.
i see your face.

i close my eyes.
i see your face
