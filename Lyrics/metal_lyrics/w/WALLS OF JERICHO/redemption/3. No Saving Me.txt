Inside these broken lines
A disruption of our lives
Insanity kicks in
And all I see is another dead end
So close your eyes
And escape from what you hide

How long will I take to bleed
These is no saving me
How far will you go to hold on

I'm better off cutting my own throat
In hope for once
That you might hear me
I know I can at least count
On the mess never judging me
I'm breaking out from all I've come to be

Alone I've gone through hell
And back to try to feel
And there is no saving me
