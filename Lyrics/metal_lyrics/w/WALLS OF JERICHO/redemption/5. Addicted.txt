[feat. Corey Taylor]

Brother I am begging you,
Please donât let this life destroy you,
You spent so much time hiding inside,
Cutting out the hurt with a knife,

I can only watch you fall,
And throw my heart against your walls,
Why do you enjoy your pain,
Sister we are one in the same,

Donât give up Just hold on,
Give it time, it wont be long,
Iâm here to open up your eyes
Donât leave this part of us behind
Donât give up, just hold on

I see the hard times on your face
If youâd hear my cries
Youâd change your ways
Blood is like a trip through the past,
I know youâre on your own and fading fast
Iâm with you

Donât give up Just hold on,
Give it time, it wont be long,
Iâm here to open up your eyes
Donât leave this part of us behind
Donât give up, just hold on

It kills me that I couldnât see,
That someone I loved needed me,
You are a part of who I am,
I will fight this fight with you till the end.

Donât give up, just hold on,
Give it time, it wont be long,
Iâm here to open up your eyes
Donât leave this part of us behind

Donât give up, just hold on
Donât give up, just hold on
Give it time, it wont be long,
Iâm here to open up your eyes
Donât leave this part of us behind

Donât give up, just hold on
Donât give up, just hold on
Donât give up, just hold on
