Day breaks
the wondering begins
night without regret
couldn't face my suffering within,
where I come from, where I've been
I can't go down that path again

There's always a trail of broken hearts
you welcome bitter ends
it's always the first of fall apart
so I try to escape the past
but I'm running no where fast

[x2]
I will fight
risk my life
give my heart
to find my home

I'm searching for
my dreams to finally last
I search for something real
I search this world for a soul as lost as mine
but all the roads I've seen before
look harder than they were last time
I'm a heart with a will that's just as strong
I'm learning to survive
In search of hope
I push to carry on
waiting for the journey's end and a lifetime to begin

[x3]
I will fight
risk my life
give my heart
to find my home

I will fight
