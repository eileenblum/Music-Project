let's not sugar coat this, it's not that sweet,
my mind restrains my lips from speaking those words no one wants to hear,
those words someone has to say.
it's time to kiss goodbye.
i'm so close to ripping out my heart, i'm so close to throwing it in your face.
where would i be then?
no better off than i am now.
alone, afraid, desensitized.
this is not the first time and i'm sure its not the last.
this is the one thing i am sure of, the one thing i know.
let me ask you a question, do you know what's wrong with me?
can you give me an answer?
if not then leave me the fuck alone, quit playing hero.
honestly these tears are not for you, these tears are for me.
the me inside of me, the one that no one has seen, the me i strive to be.
i am so alone, now i'm afraid of becoming desensitized.
at least i think that's what i want.
do you know what i want?
do you know who i am?
do you like who i've become?
