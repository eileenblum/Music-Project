you can't imagine how much this fucking hurts.
how torn apart my mind has become.
i need to spare myself, from these endless tears.
i no longer want to look into the mirror.
i'm tired of being strong.
do you ever feel so alone, your own existence goes unnoticed.
yes, i'm talking about myself,
i'm not afraid to say i'm so tired of impressing you.
have you ever rebelled against everything you believed, how fucked is that?
this needs to be for me i need to fix this broken, fix this broken heart.
one day rejection will be off my doorstep,
and your eyes will fill with the passion that pumps through my veins
and falls from my eyes. 
you are my demise.
and through it kisses my heart, i am still broken.
