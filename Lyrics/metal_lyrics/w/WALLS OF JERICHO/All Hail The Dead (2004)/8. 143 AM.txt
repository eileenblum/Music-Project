i don't want to feel anymore.
this is the one we've been waiting for.
i'm done offering my life to you.
this fake smiles' time is up.
why is it that what we do is never enough?
no matter how hard we try, it never turns out right.
i can't stand feeling pulled from every direction, no more.
my uncertainities are making it hard ot breathe.
it's time to go on in this life.
i'm moving on from you, i'm letting you go, i don't want to feel anymore.
i'm done hiding it well, i need to lose control and let it work out for itself.
i'm not going to wait around and see not anymore.
