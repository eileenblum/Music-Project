chase life, don't let monotony burn another day.
don't let it be regret that falls on your lap.
it pains me to think of all the time spent looking for change,
but the change lies there with in ourselves.
this moment in your life, has never been more right.
it's time to overcome and leave the past behind regret is needless pain.
dream like you'll live for ever, live like you'll die tomorrow
