this is what i do, me here in front of you.
this is my life, this is my everything.
it's in my heart, help me keep it dear,
and i wil fight to keep my dreams alive.
you here with us, there's nowhere else i want to be.
this is the one thing we can't let fade away.
this is our life.
it's what drives us to go on.
this is our life.
no one can hold us back.
