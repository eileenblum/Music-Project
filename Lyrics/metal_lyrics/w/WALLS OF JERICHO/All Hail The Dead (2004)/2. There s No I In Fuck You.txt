here i am a poster board pinup for you to hate,
someone who once cared now nothing is holding me back.
i am no more an image of what you thought i should be,
the choice you've made and forced upon me.
so go on and hate me if you must, but honestly i don't give a fuck.
with my friends by my side i can get through anything,
with you on my side we can destroy everything.
for those who continue to comare to this false idea,
what do you expect from me,
sing a lullaby scream you to sleep, i'm fucking sick of it being your way. 
you don't love me, you love the person you think i am
a poster board pinup for you to love.
you don't hate me, you love the person you think i am
a poster board pinup for you to hate.
what you may see on the outside might not hold true to your heart, so here i am.
the real deal take it or not, like i've said before i don't give a fuck.
