Now I see
I never knew closed eyes could kill me
Now I know, and I see you for who you are
I've spent too much of my life watching you hide inside
Hoping you'd pull it off but your far from anything real

She said let the slaughter begin
Her tears spill to the floor
What a beautiful sight it is
As she lays down to again, to die again

Once and for all I want someone to owe what's mine
Look to the future with no more lies
I'm writing you up for the final time
This was just the point of pleasure was all mine
This will be the last time, the last time I try

Now I close my eyes

She said let the slaughter begin
Her tears spill to the floor
What a beautiful sight it is
As she lays down to again, to die again
