Take what you think you see
Is it real?
Remove the bottomless intrigue
Does it feel?

Embrace your sacrifice,
dead men die tonight
And out here no one can hear your,
Screams!

Backed into a corner, fear
Beating down your face
A firestorm awaits around the corner
These bullets are your saving grace

It will show what it believes
Does it breathe?
Host a new meaning of life,
Set you free

Embrace your sacrifice,
Dead men die tonight
And out here no one can hear your,
Screams!

Inject me with the will to live
I am the one left in ruin
This is our dying attempt

Embrace your sacrifice,
Dead men die tonight
And out here no one can hear your,
Screams!

Inject me with the will to live
I am the one left in ruin

This is our dying attempt [9x]
