There is not a thing, you're infect the worst, whats this sometimes,
You get nothing in return, you're not freedom, freedom, for us,
The regrets one, betrayed, by you whats that, the world forever gone.

For spreading all you're lies, but it wont work this time
(no not this time) forgiveness
means nothing to me, nothing to me, Nothing, my judgment day
We'll cut you free, cut you free, cut you.

Sincerity, force fed by pride,
For signs with open eyes
Champions just arrived,
you're not freedom, freedom, for us,
The regrets one, betrayed, by you whats that, the world forever gone.

every word you said you lied, but it wont work this time
(no not this time) forgiveness
means nothing to me, nothing to me, Nothing, my judgment day
We'll cut you free, cut you free, cut you
my purity, I hate what you've made out of me
Forgiveness
Means nothing to me, nothing to me, Nothing.

Force fed me all your lies, everything you sad you've lied,
it's time to say good bye.
...'cause it wont work this time!
forgiveness
means nothing to me, nothing to me, Nothing
my judgment day
We'll cut you free, cut you free, cut you
my purity, I hate what you've made out of me
Forgiveness
Means nothing to me, nothing to me, Nothing.
means nothing to me, nothing to me, Nothing.
My judgment day.
I hate what you've made out of me
