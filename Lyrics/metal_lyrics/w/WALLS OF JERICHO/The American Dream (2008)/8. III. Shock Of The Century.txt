"Lock the door, a killer is loose
Head count is 3.
A terrifying reality that won't end.
It's the shock of the century.

Blueprint of hate,
Blueprint of death.
Evidence will soon unfold.

Stateside road A1A.
Searching.
Another trail left cold.
Searching.
Body still not found.
Searching.
Discovery too unreal.

News is in.
Only bones remain.
Horror.
One after another.
Horror.
The gruesome three are found.
Horror.
Decaying bodies lay.

Report is in.
The wolf has struck again.
This is the work of a madman.
The true face of evil.
This is the work of a madman.
The true face of death.

Your time is up,
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
The noose is set for your demise.

We must.
Convict at any cost.
We must.
Lay them to rest.
We must.
Grant the request.
The end will justify the means.

Terror.
A mother cries out.
Terror.
A turn for the worse.
Terror.
A nation shocked by fear.
You turned him loose to kill again.

This is the work of a madman.
The true face of evil.
This is the work of a madman.
The true face of death."
