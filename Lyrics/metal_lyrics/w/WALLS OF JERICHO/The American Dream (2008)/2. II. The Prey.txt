You left us there to die
One fateful day
To rot beneath the stones
our flesh and blood prevail

I won't forget that day
Took it all as our carnage gave you life
Every day we cry from beyond
For we just won't let you go
Let you go!

Gore will tell our story
Validate your end, validate your end
You'll get what you deserve
Suffer for our glory

I won't forget that day [4x]
All that's left is hate

You will pay for that day
You ripped us from the earth
and at the hands of fate
We will get what's owed

I'll never forget

I won't forget [5x]
All that's left is hate
