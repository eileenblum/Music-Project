This army of inspiration
We came for our revenge, our revenge
We'll raise the flag of discontent
We know who we are and where we stand

I know words can't change the world
but they can have an impact on life, impact on life
Through some words that someone else wrote
I found hope, and hope is all we have!

Why sing another empty anthem?
When you know this world needs direction

Hope is all we have!

Why sing another empty anthem?
When you know this world needs direction

The hollow words you say,
We both know they mean nothing.

We know, we know, that your heart is hollow
We know, we know, that your words are shallow
We know, we know, that your heart is hollow
We know, we know, that your words are shallow,
but those words are all we have
