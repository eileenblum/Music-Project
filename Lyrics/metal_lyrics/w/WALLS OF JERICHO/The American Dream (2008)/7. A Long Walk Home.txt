From day one, you were my everything
You made me understand
That love and loss go hand in hand
Instilled in me a sense of loyalty
A trust that could never be undone

Redemption, is what I seek.
Redemption, guilt gets the best of me
Of me!

There's no better time than now to say I'm sorry
I should have never walked away
Now my heart bleeds One more tortured song
That I sing until my dying day.

Redemption, is what I seek
Redemption, guilt gets the best of me
Gets the best of me, gets the best of me!

I'm not the only one who can change
The hate you took to your grave
I'm not the only one to blame
For the pain you took to your grave

Redemption, is what I seek
Redemption, guilt gets the best of me
Gets the best of me, gets the best of me!
Redemption, gets the best of me
Redemption, gets the best of me
