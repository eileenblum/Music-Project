I AM a monster inside a man,
the outer shell is my better half
Methods of madness have no end
When you hunt the dead
And urge, strong urge, I can't resist
And they will only set me free to run again

I am a wolf, a killer, alone I stand
All you see is my mask of sanity
A true mystery
The wolf will strike again, strike again

MY DREAMS will prey on you
I promise this will set you free
Close your eyes wait for it, wait for it
The warm crimson freedom will wash you clean
Your body will rot beneath the concrete

I am a wolf, a killer, alone I stand
All you see is my mask of sanity
A true mystery
The wolf will strike again, strike again
The wolf will strike again

I am a wolf! I am a killer! Alone I stand!
The wolf will strike again, strike again

I am a wolf, a killer, alone I stand
All you see is my mask of sanity
A true mystery
The wolf will strike again, strike again
