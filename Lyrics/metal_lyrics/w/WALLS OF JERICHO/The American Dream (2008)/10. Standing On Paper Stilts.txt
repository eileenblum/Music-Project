Endless days, I've got to find a way
Who am I?
I die a little more each day
Pull out this affliction with my own two hands
I need to be a better man
Can't you see through me?
All I have is me but I don't know who I am
Spent life holding on
No chance of hope, no thought of bond
I don't know who I am, I don't know who I am
Why did it all go wrong?

Endless days, got to find a way
Who am I?
I die a little more each day
At 13 so I kept you at afar
Just wanted life to leave my heart
Shot up what all went wrong
F**k it I'm not that strong
Endless days, got to find a way
Who am I?
I die a little more each day
Endless days, got to find a way
I die a little more each day

Who are you to tell me how to live my life?
I've given you all that I have and there's no turning back
And there's no turning back now
It's time to fight
Make a choice and stand
What I've done with my life
Determines these endless days

End less days [x4]

These endless days [x3]
