Don't use weakness as a consolation price
To win a battle you must start a war
Soldier, soldier fight because you're proud of what you left behind

We used to think that life is like running into a wall
But remember, the harder you fall, the deeper you buried your hopes

When the time comes, be strong enough to overcome this plague
Like a soldier, you are the only one master of your pain

We live this life, taking this fight to survive
We may fall but we're still alive
We rise as giants
All the tallest fall and start all over.
Failure will never take away our dreams

Riddled with bullets, conscious of that mess
You must wait to get back your happiness

Don't use weakness as a consolation price
To win a battle you must start a war
Soldier, soldier fight because you're proud of what you left behind

Get out that mess in your head
A second chance doesn't mean anything
If you haven't learned from your first mistakes

We live this life, taking this fight to survive
We may fall but we're still alive
We rise as giants
All the tallest fall and start all over.
Failure will never take away our dreams

This is the reason why we are fighting for this.

Life is not a fairy tale.
All the giants fall and start over and over again.
