In people eyes, attitudes have changed
Every time they look at me I'm losing self-confidence
Mirrors are reflecting me as if I was different
I live the same dreams, the same will and same hell

One thousand eyes blinded by lies
Behind my back I can feel they stare at me
Pointing their finger most of the time
I'm powerless facing this reality

Don't waste your time judging by appearances
Open your eyes and take a look beyond of what you see

This is my life's fight down here
I'm screaming but you don't hear

I feel I'm consuming by fears [3x]
Set me free from this moral torture

In people eyes, attitudes have changed
Every time they look at me I'm losing self-confidence
Mirrors are reflecting me as if I was different
I live the same dreams, the same will and same hell

Ignorant minds spreading sadness all around
Like demons your place is underground
I'm the one paying the price of your acts
Scars still carry wounds of the past

I won't forgive or forget, too much mess in my head
I won't forgive or forget, too much place for my regrets

Thousand shards of glass lying on the ground
Broken mirrors
Divided souls again
Vacant stares hide behind curtains of shame
Broken mirrors
Divided souls again

Divided souls again
