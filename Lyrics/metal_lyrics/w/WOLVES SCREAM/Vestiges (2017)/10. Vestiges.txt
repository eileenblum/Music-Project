Burning lands reflecting pain
Fighting the dark with fire and flames.
I let them consume my fears
I am for what I believe

My faith leads me to a shinning place
A brighter light in the darkest space
Learning from the life I live
I am the voice that will never leave

We are the vestiges of this world
Is it real? All those images persist here and now
We are the vestiges of this world
Built by blood and sands, future is in our hands

Shadows reveal immaterial forms
A reborn past through the overflows
Empty souls facing the unknown
We are united against tomorrow

A brand new world to rebuilt the damage
A glimmer of fight in a lack of courage
High hopes have replaced our tears
We are the voice that will never leave

We are the vestiges of this world
Is it real? All those images persist here and now
We are the vestiges of this world
Built by blood and sands, future is in our hands
