Betrayer of your blood, corruption exposed
Spilling our blood on sidewalk
No more place for this massive discrimination
We will take down your racism addiction

It's time to pay for your sins, no more scars on our skins
Now it's blood for blood, you've broken your oath.
Your status doesn't grant you special rights; this is not black against white
Honor betrayed
Fallen hero only defending your ego, you were supposed to protect your equal

Oathbreaker

Our bodies ravaged by your fist, where the fuck is your justice

Protected behind blue suit and golden badge
What the fuck is on your mind? On your mind

We are not a nation of slaves; we all belong to the human race
We are not a nation of slaves, prisoners we're no masters of our faith

You judge us by the color of our skin
Betrayer of your blood
We'll prove your acts are real threats to justice

We are standing against fools like you
Because equality has no color
We are the wise and we'd rather die than be heartless and arrogant like you

Becoming a lone wolf wasn't my choice, it was my fate.
As a young boy, I had to learn to live with my own face
Bitterness brought me a lonely silent youth
