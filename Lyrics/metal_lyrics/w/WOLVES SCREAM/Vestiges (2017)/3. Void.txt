Remembering that day it took control over me
The void you've left inside is tearing me apart
I'm sick of struggling; I'm tired of trying
Dependence is ruining my days

Pain has broken every part of me
On my grieving heart comes a painful sight

It is too late for me to be saved
I can't explain what is happening to me
Prisoner of this addiction
I've let it distort my perception

Cancer or cure, relief has a price
If it kills me, I'm ready to die
I am reckless holding my fears
Lost in sadness drowning in tears

One more time leaving away from past
Sinking in a state of mind that would not last
Those thousand memories I won't forget
Trapped me in this room with my regrets

Another shot until my time escapes,
I'm self-destructive
Give me another shot, before I got crazy again
I'm sick of being unable to fight demons in my head
I am tired of looking for those answers

This addiction is ruining my days

Pain has broken every part of me
On my grieving heart comes a painful sight

Cancer or cure, relief has a price
If it kills me, I'm ready to die
I am reckless holding my fears
Lost in sadness drowning in tears

Forever in my blood until we meet again
