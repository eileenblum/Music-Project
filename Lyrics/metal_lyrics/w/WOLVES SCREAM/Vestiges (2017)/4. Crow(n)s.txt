Kings raised in glory until they sink in praise.
Hidden by words, lost in their lies.
Kings raised by gold hands, they will fall in disgrace
We will sow fear in your eyes

Centuries gone, dominated by crowns
Innocents' blood flows on your hands
We claim vengeance for your crimes,
Your power has left you blind

Asleep on your throne, forever alone
Even with your gold forever alone
You fear to lose your precious kingdom,
While we are only looking for our freedom

Kings raised in glory until they sink in praise.
Hidden by words, lost in their lies.
Kings raised by gold hands, they will fall in disgrace
We will sow fear in your eyes

Centuries gone, fields invaded by crows
Last call to arms on no man's land
We seek for our stolen rights
A new hope is coming to light

You may burn our house but you won't bury our souls
You'd better drop the weapons
'Cause we'll never give up
Asleep on your throne, forever alone
Even with your gold forever alone

Kings raised in glory until they sink in praise.
Hidden by words, lost in their lies.
Kings raised by gold hands, they will fall in disgrace
We will sow fear in your eyes

Our blood flows to the stones with courage
But you, you will be the only ones who die with the black hands
You die with the black hands

No one will cry on your grave and we don't give a fuck
