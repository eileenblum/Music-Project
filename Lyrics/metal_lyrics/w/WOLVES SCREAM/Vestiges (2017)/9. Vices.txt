Don't ever tell promises you can't keep
No longer faith
All these years were a shot in the dark

Have you lost your mind, where the fuck is your honesty gone?
After everything we went through
I gave you all my trust and after all
You've just toyed with my innocence

You took away my hope
Feeling one remorse, one remorse
To have seen you as a brother

This is the time I see your hidden vice
This is the time I close the door to our past

Don't ever tell promises you can't keep
No longer faith
All these years were a shot in the dark

Have you lost your mind, where the fuck is your honesty gone?
After everything we went through
I gave you all my trust and after all
You've just toyed with my innocence

What happened to you, fucking bastard?
You and your vice, lone 'til you die
Hidden behind a mask of lies
Impostor, I wished you had some fucking pride
