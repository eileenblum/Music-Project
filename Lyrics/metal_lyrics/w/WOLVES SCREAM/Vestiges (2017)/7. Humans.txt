We get all that we need from this beautiful land
Outstripping the earth's resources until the end
Acting without understanding empathy
We as humans are the kings of humanity

We're drawing the lines on the globe
In order to starve nature to death

Empty days searching for a light, would it be hidden in paradise?
This is perhaps the greatest challenge we ever faced
We made the earthquake that's destroying our living place

Sleeping carbon is in the atmosphere
Fertile areas have become an empty desert.

Reversion to a primitive condition, facing another massive extinction

We are its cancer

We are the shame of the human nation
The bigger threat to the future generation
Spreading our poison

Empty days searching for a light, would it be hidden in paradise?
This is perhaps the greatest challenge we ever faced
We made the earthquake that's destroying our living place
This is perhaps the greatest challenge we ever faced
