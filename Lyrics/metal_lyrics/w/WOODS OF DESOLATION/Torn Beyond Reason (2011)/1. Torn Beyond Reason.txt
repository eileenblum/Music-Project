Beyond the dawn, No new day
A ruined mind of false illusion
Beyond the darkness, deeper still
This sorrow has grown so old

Eyes turn skyward
Torn Beyond Reason, far too deep
Broken, Heartless. Void
No words will heal these wounds

Life's touch has faded, all meaning lost
I stride into Death's open arms
The wind will carry no farewell
And so shall the cold soil
Hold the taste of my decay
