Grey visions of today
Every sight the same
I can not break free
I think I'm gone
As though I never wake
Always drawn into descent
And my hope decays, just out of reach

Cursed through life &amp; condemned to misery
To be left with nothing...

If only for a moment; a way out
To see the faintest glimmer amongst the dark
To mend the broken dawn so bleak
Somehow I think I'm gone

But like ashes to the wind i will fade
Nameless and Forgotten
The thorn upon the withered rose
Somehow I always knew...
