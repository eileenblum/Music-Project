I'd give you my allFor just a second of your cold indifferenceThis empty feeling inside meAnd dreams that will never be realised So many sleepless nights by Death's sideWith nothing but this broken mind As all my memories fadeCrushed by the bitter realisationNothing more will lie aheadBut these darker days
