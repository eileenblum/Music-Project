I walk a million miles and get nowhere
Against the cold rain
Torn asunder
Clutching at the withered strands of "life"

Dreams splintered in two
Replaced by the endless drone
Of broken spirits and open wounds
Emptiness deeply sown

Distant voices echo in a sea of beings
Within it's ebb. Half forgotten memories
An Unbroken Moment
