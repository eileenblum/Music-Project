Each time I close my eyes.
They run at me.
Eyes empty
Screaming
In many ways I am responsible.

The adrenalin courses through my veins
As I drive deeper into the tortured
Souls of the innocent.
Disbelief as their life is robbed of them.

Forever will I live in this sound scape of screams.
Forever will the innocence haunt me with their pitiful agony's.

It is a time of darkness.
The storms have begun.
The rains fall with great strength and the winds howl.
Night is upon us. A time of eternal nightmares.
Thunder fills the night as the dead rot.
