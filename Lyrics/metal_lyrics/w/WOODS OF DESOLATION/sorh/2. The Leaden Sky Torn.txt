Cold desolate winds howl
As the rain strikes my flesh alike the blade
The leaden sky torn
Fractured by autumn decay

The dead leaves wept so silently
All words - empty, unspoken
Drowning within the black depths of misery
The cold void gathering

Another severance, another scar
As meaningless as a tear to an ocean
Misery will await, alike the seasons and the tide

So shall Death await...
