Alone I wonder, toward the unknown
Lost / Cast inwards to the void
Endless thorns upon my mind
Torn / Forever plagued by this torment within

Cold skeletal branches sway
The fall of leaves lost to the wind
Forever burdened by the past
These memories - a curse

As the full moon bled it's light upon the black sea
The last dying ebbs upon the grey shore
Life flowing within the crimson tide
Fading into eternity
