Entombed by the graven sky I lay
Reflecting within - of deepest emptiness
Enshrouded by solitude
And endless shades of grey

Isolation, the only comfort
As the shadows grow ever closer
Only sorrow shall know my name
Unable to break this undying longing
To bleed out this misery
To rot amongst the woods of desolation
