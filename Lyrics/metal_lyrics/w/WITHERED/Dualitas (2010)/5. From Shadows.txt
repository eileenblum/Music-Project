In the twilight, death will swallow
Those rising to the call
From the twilight to the shadow
Transcend these shrouded halls
Rise
Tortured conscious, being hollowed
Disparity is bred
Through suffering, freedom follows
See all as they are bled I
Bled, bled, bled, bled, bled
Rise death shadows
Rise from shadows
Rise
