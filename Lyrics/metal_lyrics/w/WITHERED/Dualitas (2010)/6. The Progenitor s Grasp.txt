Rend specious truth
I can faintly recall the burn of the sun
Myopic perception, vision is dimmed
The progenitor's gtasp will hasten maceration
Leap into the vastness of black
Dwell on the lacking within
The astute nature of all things reveling in sorrow
grasps my psyche with burning intent
as if to strip away the deceit
and reveal the glorious perversion
Echo beyond the haze
Choke out conception of faith
