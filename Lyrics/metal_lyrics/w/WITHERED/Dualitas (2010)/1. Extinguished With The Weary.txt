Willingly fall under foot and drone
without illuminated perception
Writhe
Begin dissolving into lifeless mass
Resigned to inherent fate
Trusting in frivolous enlightenment
Writhe
Tongue swelling choking
Nails curling splitting
Spine coiling cracking
Teeth gnashing chipping
Hide boiling peeling
Eyes burning closing
Mind fractured dimming
Frail anima wilting
Abomination of mentality
Pneunia decays in apathetic discord
