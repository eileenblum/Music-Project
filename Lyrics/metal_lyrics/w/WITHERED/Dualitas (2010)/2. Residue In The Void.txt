Strong intent fans a feeble ember into flame
to burn away spires erected out of fallacy
Weakened crests of contention will collapse
to unveil the veracity within
Pass through black halls
Wake timeworn axioms
Wrest the layers
Bare old wounds
Cleanse with flame
Burn off massed doubt, fear
Distend within the abstraction
