Abject, thoughts race, concede, blissful
Memories of stagnation
Forbidden fruit
Elixir of life
A poison filled chalice
Torment
Wisdom

How long will I be lost in lies of sanity
I crave the emptiness of ignorance
The only true faith I've known

Self flagellation
Sins of mind
A frail being
A perilous balance, succumb
Condemn
Malign
Rot

Denuded, ultimate negation, ecstasy, torture

Craving, leads to disillusion, and disgrace
Barren truth

Retraction, regression ensues, withdrawal, vacant
Become the haunted guise
