Cast out, flee from, the humility
Forlorn, hopeless, claw deep into earth
Bore down, descend, into hollow ground
Reach out, summon, wake the ancient dark

What do you seek in this place?
My life is stripped from me. I seek new life
Breathe in this dark to feel new life
The void in me, it grows. Endless despair
Embrace this cold and emptiness
The dark, consuming me. This fate I claim.
