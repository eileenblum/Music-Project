Plague of man
For want of a purpose
At war with nature
A useless passion

The truth which breeds, all of our pain and suffering
Say unto you, praise the glory that is human nature
Moral decree, to which we are held accountable
Counters all, that's flowing in our veins

The paradigm inverted

A witness to those who that came before us
The ultimate goal, at last understood
I have seen, this all before
Written in blood
Dreams yet to come

Hear my call, rain sorrow on this world

The essence of suffering revealed
