In down, wisdom, of ages, and power

Ingress, consciousness
Abandoned, essence of time
Hunger for the truths
Awaken, this primal mind

Wake all thought from ancient sleep
Converge
From dark
The epoch

From nothingness, become sentient
Elemental, consciousness
Be it alone, be it abandoned
In the hollow truth is found

Bastard birthright, heedless enslavement
To our virtue, faulted in life
We are alone, we are abandoned
Absolute truth is, nothingness
