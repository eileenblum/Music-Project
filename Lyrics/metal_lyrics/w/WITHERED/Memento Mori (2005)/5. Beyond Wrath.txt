Beyond consciousness lies wrathBeyond wrath lies birth and awakening of thatWhich haunts youSterility offear overcomes youVoid &amp; emptiness fuels the pain, consumes allHope within you fades away to nothingThe flame dimsLight escapes allThen it's gone, all is goneFades awayAsh of life, stink of truth chokes the breath from youWeakness begins to growOvercoming youThe flame dimsLight escapes allThen it's gone, all is goneFades away
