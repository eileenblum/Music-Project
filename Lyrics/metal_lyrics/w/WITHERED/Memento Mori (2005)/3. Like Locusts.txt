I lay in filthMy thougths decayI wish I could turn off my mindFlip of a switchEternalAll goes blackNo more angstNo more sadnessNo more confusionNo more angerNo more painNo more loveOnly blackOnly peaceHow long must I go before I realize that this is not for me?That I;m slowly dying, rotting from the insideLying in the darkMuffled sounds soundSo distant in this silenceExplode in my earsThey invade meThey envelope meLike locusts suffocating meThe currentToo strongGrowing tired and weary maelstromIts embraceIs pulling me underWe succumb to its violenceNever knowing when that time will comeI've fought it far too longNow it's time to let myself goNow it's timeAchieving peaceNow it's timeLet goOf the guiltNow it's timeStop my beating heart
