Drift into thoughts of the endFinished with this hellEnd my putrid stenchWasting breath of lifePain runs through my veinsSpill this pain of mine until it finally endsPain spreads within meCancerous existence overwhelming meRelief escapes meI've been given all thatLife is not supposed to beThere is nothing elseTo heal all the wounds that constantly torture meBeneath my angerI tremble from the fear and painThat cripples me
