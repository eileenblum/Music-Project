[Bonus Track]If you find yourself,
On the tip of an enemy sword,
Pull them close to you,
Look in to their eyes and laugh,

Look to the future
See they, children of the Engla,
Blood of the Land

For a drop of blood
That falleth to soil
Means you will live,
In the Land that you love,
Forever!

You will look back,
Be among ancestors,
The Fathers of Albion
