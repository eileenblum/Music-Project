Then he who thought wisely of,
Deeply contemplates this dark life,
Wise in mind, remembers he, the battles of old;
Time has departed,
Grown dark under cover of night,
As if it were never there.

Powerful spears took earls away,
Weapons greedy for slaughter,
Storms now batter these stone cliffs,
A falling snowstorm binds the Earth,
The tummult of winter;
Shade of night grows dark,
Sends from the north,
The rough hailstorm in hosility to men.

Everything is fraught with hardship in the kingdom of Earth,
Here all is temporary,
Earth's foundations become vain!

Apart in counsel,
good is he who preserves faith.

Nor ought a man to ever,
Make known the grief of his heart too quickly,
Well it is for the one, who seeks mercy for himself,
To find solace, where security stands

"My lord was covered in darkness,
I was wretched, I was desolate,
As the winter coming of waves,
To find solace, where security stands!"
