Learned we in former-days,
Of glory-blessed heroes,
The thegns of the Lord,
Their force did not fail,
In the war,
When banners clashed together.

Illustrious men upon the earth,
Bold folk-leaders on the fields of reckoning
Doughty Warriors, Battle-Brave!
When shield and hand defended their crown.
When all man's land was wound in murder,
The enemy's deceit was rife within the kingdom.

On the dwelling-place of mighty men, 
Homeland of heroes.  They of true spirit!
Neither bread, nor water for men,
Consumed they, blood and skin throughout the nation,
The flesh-homes of foreign-coming men,
Such was the peace-less token

The violence of the wretched,
That the enemy, sword-grim and sad-minded,
Destroyed the sight of th eyes,
With the point of spears.

Then they strove against incursion,
Swiftly under shield,
Bristling with spears,
Enraged ash-bearers,
Corwards the flight's flame!
One and all, together, for home!
