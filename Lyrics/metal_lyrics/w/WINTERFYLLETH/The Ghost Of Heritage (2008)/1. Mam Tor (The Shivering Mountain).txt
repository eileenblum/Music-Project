Mam Tor.
Your torso shivers
As the backbone of our land,
Under the weight
Of a now plagued country.
The old ways,
Elsewhere long gone,
Still linger in these parts.
The ways of our people,
Whose ancient mighty fort
Crowned your glorious slopes
And whose dead
Dwell in your barrows.
We will honour them
Forever.
We will hail your mighty heights
And the caverns beneath.
Those dark places
That had carved out our ores.

Mam Tor, in the High Peak!
Celtic whispers still haunt,
This windswept land,
Of long endured winters.

The spirit of our land
Will never die.
The spirit of the mountain is strong.

Mam Tor, in the High Peak!
Celtic whispers still haunt,
This windswept land,
Of long endured winters.

Mam Tor. Mam Tor.
