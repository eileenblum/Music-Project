Evil blossomed in all men's breasts,
Brand hot malice boiled their minds,
Grew hot the varicoloured poison,
Was evident in their injurious word,
A mood of ill thought toward other men,
With murder wound about.

A king commands the strong ones to go,
March the stone of the street,
From their solid plain, go forward,
Tread the earth-ways to green plains new.

Their errand in doctrines did lead to other lands,
By the king's word, from the earth,
To make resurrection, to lay their land to rest,
Limbs to gather up, spirits to take.

Not for the many, but serve only the few,
Forth they came to the people announce,
Whom they as gods in might understood,
Then set out they, to go forth and claim,

As him the Lord who had appointed them,
Over the boundary paths,
Where the bodies of those who stood,

The corpses of their fathers,
Had in struggle been concealed!

Then the elders again began, sinful to say,
That it by magic arts was done,
By glamour, that the bright one,
Spake before men and left them judged!
