Lo! We learned in days gone by,
Of those beneath the stars,
Nameless heroes blessed by all,
But servants of their lords.

Their glory failed not, by man's conflict,
When ensigns clashed and all fell fowl,
Men made famous on the earth,
By pious leaders, bold in warfare

The hand of slaughter, had been decided,
Land wound with fear, with the sedition of 'foes'!

Revered as warriors, and our saviours,
When fist and iron on all to war,
A nation guard on fields of battle,
Where none might home or hope enjoy!

"I was evermore in every way,
of thy will desirous in mind,
Now with sorrow must I deeds,
Act now as a warrior herd."

Their hands hath slaughtered, their fate decided,
Land red with blood, their foes cut down!

A sinful tribe, the tumult of undone men,
The devil's servants, blindly charging on.

After mixed for them, bitter together,
These wizards through their magic a fatal drink,
Which turned away, the wit and intellect of men,
And claimed their hearts within their breasts!

"I was evermore in every way,
of thy will desirous in mind,
Now with sorrow must I deeds,
Act now as a warrior herd."
