The 'great creationâ had arrived,
All before the Lord's made go,
Of fires intense and over grounds,
The heat of flame did roar!

The heavens burst, both strong and bright,
The stars they all did fall.
The sun turned dark to hue of blood,
A casualty of war!

And all but worse, the moon the same,
Gave light by night, shall now be still,
And so the stars from high be strewn,
Through tempest of the storms!

And through the wide ground loud be heard,
A soaring trumpet's voice,
On seven sides new winds shall fell,
A crashing blow, to fearful might!

Shall agitate and still the world,
With storm its breath shall fell,
The dark creations made by they,
Those wicked, whom folk tales tell.

So we as men must all now learn,
This cycle claiming blood,
Our future must not be again,
So stand as one, for we as one stand fall!
