Then there shone lights,
Of beams the brightest,
That beacon was upon the earth, 
As a fiery tower seen beneath the sky, 
Bright as the sun,

A song of triumph sun,
Throughout the air,
Threnody to the fallen,
Filled with joys,
For the love of those ones missed,
With angels' sound may voice relate!

But here they bear forth,
Birds screech &amp; grey-wolves bay
The war-wood still clashes,
Where shield answers sword

Woe-deeds come to pass
That which man's hatred desire to fulfil, 
Now the moon shines
Wandering under clouds,

The raven hovered, shimmering dark
Then the fire feedeth on a fleeting body's life
The spirit of the lost journeys onward
As funeral pyre consumes flesh &amp; bone

A song of triumph sung,
Throughout the air,
Threnody to the fallen,
Filled with joys,
For the love of those ones missed,
With angels' sound,
All there within
That in the world,
May voice relate,

A song of triumph sung!
