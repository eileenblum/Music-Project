I dance like flames,
I lend the winds,
Glorious shapes!
The fire in me,
Feels for the lightening,
And breathes me away,
Down the wind!

I will tell thee
My secret love,
If thou from me
Thy knowledge hidest,
The departing shall go,
Fated die, every day
Separated from mid earth!

When I am lifted up,
And they all bow to me,
The many with mildness,
There I must increase,
For the goodness of man,
The rising of prosperity!
