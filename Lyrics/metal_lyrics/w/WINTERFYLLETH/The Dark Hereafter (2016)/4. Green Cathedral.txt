The winds are loud,
The oceans sway,
Yet strong remain the stony cliffs,
Hold their place o'er watery strife.

At times I must, below the earth,
The waves of change dive under,
The sea from above, they stir,
The streams, they mix,
But mountains arise,
Firm solace of ground,
Where we, sure of foot,
Watch them dissolve together.

Where the water gently laps,
At gravelled shores,
Where heather blooms
As free men keep unfailing watch.
A quiet place, a lonely place,
I shall go to it, for one last time,
...and be carried,
By those who knew me in life,
Take me and empty me,
From a vessel and leave me there alone.
