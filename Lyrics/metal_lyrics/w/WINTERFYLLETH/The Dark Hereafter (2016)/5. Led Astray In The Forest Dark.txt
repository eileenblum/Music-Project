They awaited the maiden's return,
Astray she was in forest dark,
Her only friend was the homeward path,
Hidden by the spreading snow

Could she but not, follow starry trails
She would not be lost, amongst these spruces dark

Wooden arms embraced the foreign guest
Sad was their song unto her
The halls of the mountain king,
Clamour for Christian blood

[The Netherworld:]
"Near at hand; a maiden in grief
Hands joined in prayer
A Litany rises to heaven above."

From springs above
Upon her head
Drop by drop as blood
From Jesus Christ

[The Maiden:]
"Lonely, in forest deep,
Tonight, I feel and fear,
No one remembers me."
