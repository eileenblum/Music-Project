Accursed for ever and driven to exile,
Thou shalt be punished, for deeds of death,
The earth shall not yield thee, of her fruits,
By thy hands her soil stained, with proud men's blood!

The green land, shall withhold from thee,
Her beauty and delights,
In sadness and dishonour,
Shalt thou, depart from thy home!

As thou hast slain thy brother,
Loathed of thy kin,
A lowly pariah,
Shalt wander the earth!

Look not for pity, in this world,
For thou are lost in love and favour,
Weary the ways you must wander,
In dread and of woe!

Whenever one shall meet you,
In your guilt, near or far,
By his hate reminded,
Of his brother's death!

His life was shed,
So thou art scourgest,
And thou must go,
Away from all men's sight!
