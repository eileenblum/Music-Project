Came forth a liege and five loyal kin,
To a realm men sought to claim,
An old Witch thence appeared to them,
Her terms she did outlay...

The Witch -
"From this point on you all I'll make,
Seven strides shalt thou now take,
And if Long Compton thou can see,
A King of England shall thou be...
And if Long Compton thou can't see,
No King of England shalt thy be.
Rise up stick and rise up stone,
For a King of England shalt be none".

An Ode to the Elder Mother -
"Old girl, old girl give to me,
Some of thy wood, and I'll give thee,
Some of mine, some of mine
when I turn into a tree".
