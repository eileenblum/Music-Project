Our acre, once tall,
Now barren and frail.
"Devils", said father,
Had cursed our vale.

"Hunt them", protect us,
"Go forth", I did plea.
Mother did aver,
The right remedy.

"Erce, Erce, Erce", we spoke.
The rite was afoot,
How graven our folk.

Herb, milk and honey,
They fell upon sward.
Now Earth's blessed mother,
Our yield, she will guard.
