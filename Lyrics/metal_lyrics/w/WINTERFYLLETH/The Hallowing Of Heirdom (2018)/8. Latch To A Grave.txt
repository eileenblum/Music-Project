I am a Lord's attendant,
A soldier's loyal kin,
To my master dear,
Companion to my king.

A queen on me sometimes,
Nobly, swears an oath.

I hold in my possession,
The latch to a grave.

My tongue is firm,
Yet oft I, to the poet,
A loan of words
Give for his verse.

Faultless is my form,
And noble is my cause,
Yet in the hands of some
Deathly is my touch
