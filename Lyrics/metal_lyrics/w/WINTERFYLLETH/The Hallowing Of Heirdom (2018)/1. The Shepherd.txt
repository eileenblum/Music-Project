Part 1
Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove.
That hills and valleys, dale and field,
And all the craggy mountains yield.

There we will sit upon the rocks
And see the shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow rivers, to whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals.

Part 2
There will I make a bed of rose
A thousand petals there I chose,
A cap of flowers, and a gown
Embroidered all with leaves surround.

A robe made of the finest wool
Which from enduring flocks we pull,
Fur lined to shield against the cold,
And raindrops of the purest gold.

Belts of straw and ivy buds
With coral clasps and amber studs:
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me and be my Love.

The shepherd swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May-morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me and be my Love.
