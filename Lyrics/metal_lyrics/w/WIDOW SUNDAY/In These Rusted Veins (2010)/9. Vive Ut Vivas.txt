You've always told me just to be myself
To make decisions based on who I thought I'd become
Gave me every chance
The path I chose led me to this life
I hope I'm everything you wanted to see
All I ever wanted was to make you proud
I tried everything to do my best
But failure always seems to grab me by the neck

How much longer will it take to justify all my mistakes?
I just want you to believe that this is where I was meant to be
How much longer will it take to justify all my mistakes?
I just want you to believe that this is where I'm finally free

I'm not the perfect son you thought I would be
I can't shake the feeling that somehow I failed you
Every minute, every dollar I've wasted
Promising so much and delivering nothing
I swear to you I'm trying to succeed
I hope you understand this is all for you
Everything I am is to prove to you
That I won't be broken

I'm the end result of all my bad decisions

How much longer will it take to justify all my mistakes?
I just want you to believe that this is where I'm finally free

This is where I'm finally free
