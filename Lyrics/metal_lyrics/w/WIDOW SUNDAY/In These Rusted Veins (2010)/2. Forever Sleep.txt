Taken from me without warning
I woke up just to find you cold
What did I do to deserve this pain?
As you pass I've one solution
Can't let go, this whole world ends tonight
Brace yourselves to feel what I have lost
There's no way that I'll be left behind
Say all your goodbyes and watch the skies

The fire above
To sense the falling ash that burns away
I need to be reminded I can feel
A blinding light, my wrath becoming clear
I pray to sleep forever

I'll consume the world just to see you
I won't hesitate to take you all
Since you died I have no options
If I can't have you no one will

The fire above
To sense the falling ash that burns away
I need to be reminded I can feel
A blinding light, my wrath becoming clear
I pray to sleep forever
A blinding light, my wrath becoming clear
I pray to sleep forever
Let me forever sleep

If I cant have you
If I can't have you no one will

The fire above
To sense the falling ash that burns away
I need to be reminded I can feel
The fire above
To sense the falling ash that burns away
I need to be reminded I can feel
The fire above
A blinding light, my wrath becoming clear
I pray to sleep forever
Let me forever
Let me forever sleep
