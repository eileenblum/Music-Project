Grind away the skies above
And dismantle darkened clouds
Incinerate the blighted earth
Fan the flame of your demise
Trampled life beneath the weight of a thousand locust hordes
The strip-mine devastation leaves us broken, bruised and blind

Kill and make a stranger of your enemy
Kill and make a stranger of your family tree

How long before you and I are worth our weight in gold?
Sacrificial slaughter so the upper crust could breathe

Ignorance is bliss until you watch the hammer fall
As the waves crash down your cities crumble over and over and fall
Crushing all that sits beneath your precious fucking crown
Swell the seas to cleanse us of our crimes

Trust we so foolishly put in you
Let you take control of all we have
Trust we so foolishly put in you
Let you take control

Consuming every last resource until the rivers flow with tears
The cancer of this tattered earth finally disappeared

Ignorance is bliss until you watch the hammer fall
As the waves crash down your cities crumble over and over and fall
Crushing all that sits beneath your precious fucking crown
Swell the seas to cleanse us of our crimes

Lay back and close your eyes
Breathe deep and end your life

Kill and make a stranger of your enemy
Kill and make a stranger of your family tree

Ignorance is bliss until you watch the hammer fall
As the waves crash down your cities crumble over and over and fall
Crushing all that sits beneath your precious fucking crown
Swell the seas to cleanse me of my crimes
Cleanse me of my crimes
