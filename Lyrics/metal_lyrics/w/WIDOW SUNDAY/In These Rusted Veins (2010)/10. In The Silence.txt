Darkness is the greatest teacher
Allowing ones to see themselves
And every ounce of shame they carry
Praying that they ll never repeat
In the silence no one listens
To what we need to hear
When there s no one else around
The only one left to blame is yourself

Learned my lessons well
Over and over again
Force-fed lies until I choked
In this cell
I scream with rage
I wait until a voice responds to me

Take my hand and I'll make you see
I'll show you sights you'd never believe
I'll take you to a place where these walls mean nothing now

A life disposed
My skin becoming scales
A soul this bruised could never be whole again
Send someone to heal
These self-inflicted wounds
Cannot fix what is broken

The moments pass so violently
I feel the change through grinding teeth
What once was me is gone forever
Leaving your walls far behind
The moments pass so violently
I feel the change through grinding teeth
What once was me is gone forever
Leaving your walls far behind

I'm leaving your walls far behind
I leave your walls far behind

Took your hand and you made me see
Showed me sights I never believed
Took me to a place where these walls mean nothing now
