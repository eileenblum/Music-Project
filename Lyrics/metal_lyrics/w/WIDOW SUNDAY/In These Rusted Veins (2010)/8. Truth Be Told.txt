From birth we re shown
The mistakes of generations
Open our eyes to stare their shame in the face
Our curse to walk among the living
And face this wretched, twisted

Fucked up world is all because of you
Coat the ground with the shit you spew
Truth be told, I'd rather die like me
Truth be told, than to live like you

Baptized in waters
Poisoned by your so-called savior
Shoulder the burden
Of our crimes of being born
Our fate to wade among the burning fields
And face the monsters we've become
The monsters we've become

You say we're self-righteous
You won't hold us back
Every word from your mouth digs your own grave
We will burn you
Pay for your mistakes
This is the final word
Our time has come

Fucked up world is all because of you
Coat the ground with the shit you spew
Truth be told, I'd rather die like me
Truth be told, than to live like you
Truth be told, I'd rather die like me
Truth be told, than to live like you

How long will it take to see this is our time?
