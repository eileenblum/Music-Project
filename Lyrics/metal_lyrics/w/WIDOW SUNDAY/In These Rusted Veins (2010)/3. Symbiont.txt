I sense my soul again so let me breathe
My mind reconnects the lines that fade
I sense my soul again so let me breathe
My mind reconnects the lines that fade

I've become the avatar of everything you wanted to see
Wore my mask and played the role
Of a fool who thought it d all be worth the pain
A black heart smeared with good intentions
Only masks the scars of a vapid existence
Blinded I made the sacrifice
On my knees it all comes into focus

I sense my soul again so let me breathe
My mind reconnects the lines that fade
I sense my soul again so let me breathe
My mind reconnects the lines that fade

Silence, praise be the blessed silence
Takes me to a new plane of thought and resistance

Now the choice is who to eliminate
Myself or this parasite
That s leeching me away inside
Piece by piece
Constantly with you it never ends
Blood boils in these rusted veins
I stand at the precipice
No more will I stand and
No more will I stand and cower
Before you

I'm released from agony
From everything I tried to repress
Why it took so long to realize you were drowning me
I'll never know
I'll never know why it took so long
To realize you were drowning me
I guess I'll never know

The time has come for separation from this curse
The reason I have now begun to hate myself
You're not worth the pain we caused each other everyday
I'll be fine when I walk away
