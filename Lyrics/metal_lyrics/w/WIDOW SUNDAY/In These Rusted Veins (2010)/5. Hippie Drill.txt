Fuck your righteousness
And fuck your hacky sack
And fuck your patchwork life
Fuck you tree-hugger
Fuck your peace
And what the fuck is that smell?

What exactly do you think you'll prove?
That your hemp shirt will save a whale?
You wanna make a difference but you don t do shit
Bongo circles won't stop the bombs
When will you finally accept that you're just as fucked as me?
And oh my god, if I hear one more word about the fucking Grateful Dead
So help me

Jerry won't save the world
Trey won't save the world

Bounce

What exactly do you think you'll prove?
That your hemp shirt will save a whale?
You wanna make a difference but you don t do shit
Bongo circles won't stop the bombs
When will you finally accept that you're just as fucked as me?
And oh my god, if I hear one more word about the fucking Grateful Dead
So help me

Your tie-dyed blood will fuel my hippie drill
