Disgust, contempt for the air you breathe
Soulless, coward you're a fucking disease
With every ounce of strength that I've got left
I won't stop until you feel what I feel

No one will save you now
Who would save you?

Focus now if only for a moment to collect the thoughts
I've become the instrument of death
Your face stares back now, blank and lifeless

Your eyes betray that glimmer of fear
The hope, the plead that I might relent
No longer man, now the bullet made flesh
And the gun in your mouth's only fueling my bloodlust

No one will save you now
Who would save you?

Focus now if only for a moment to collect the thoughts
I've become the instrument of death
Your face stares back now, blank and lifeless
How the fuck could it have come to this
I don t know what happened to self control
Fate consumes and your debt will be paid
With every pint you spill for me

Everybody dance

Retribution comes in many forms
But I've saved the best for you
There's nothing left to tie me to this world
Except to be the one to avenge the fallen
It's so easy to prey on the weak
When the weak don t have a choice
Just imagine if the bled fought back to reclaim what's been taken from them

Blood money
