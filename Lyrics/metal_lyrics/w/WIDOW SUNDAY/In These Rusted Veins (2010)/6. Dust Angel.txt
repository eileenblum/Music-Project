To live is to renounce whatever strives to deceive
Your lies are proof of deception whispered in my dreams
Who decides what thought to betray and who becomes a god?
I won't fall onto my knees and declare undying love
Seraphim fear to be cast out for beliefs they call their own
If I am already condemned then what's the point of absolution?

Face the day with a new found sense of what's to come
I won't be a servant to your serpent god
Your mistake was choking lies to let them break you
I am not your dust angel nor will I ever be

How much did it cost to build your throne?
A pious life lived in luxury
Dedication inspires wrath
All forgiving hope casts us down
Cast us down

Face the day with a new found sense of what's to come
I won't be a servant to your serpent god
Your mistake was choking lies to let them break you
I am not your dust angel nor will I ever be

When the rapture comes I won't cry for peace
Won't regret for a second what I chose to be
Am I now a traitor for my indifference to the light?
Not a captive to the rhetoric spewed from your tarnished heights
Genocide will choose the path the weak will wear through
My strength will deny your words from ever taking hold again
My strength will deny your word from ever taking hold again

How much did it cost to build your throne?
A pious life lived in luxury
Dedication inspires wrath
All forgiving hope casts us down

Never gonna see
Won't live like the ones I despise
Never gonna feel
A bullet in my hand
The bullet feeds the gun
A bullet through my head
Your dust angel falls
