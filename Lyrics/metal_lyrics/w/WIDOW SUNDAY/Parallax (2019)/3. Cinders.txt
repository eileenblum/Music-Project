Corruption, brutality. Force fed lies of purity.
Servant to the great machine, twisted by your own disease.
Rhetoric regurgitate, make yourself feel justified
Forcing those who've seen the truth to use our calloused weak minds

A trigger finger leader opened the abyss
A junkie's fix to take and dominate

We will devour everything within sight
Spreading like a cancer and consuming the light
'Reap what we sow' will be our demise
Laughing in our misery while we're burning the skies

Slaughterhouse for weakened men convinced they can see the end
From a distance you feel safe
Watch your world disintegrate
Blind us to the waves of fire.
Ignorance is perfect bliss.

A junkie's fix to take and dominate

We will devour everything within sight
Spreading like a cancer and consuming the light
'Reap what we sow' will be our demise
Laughing in our misery while we're burning the skies

Emptiness will breed malevolence
No remorse for the fallen and used
Mountains leveled and the oceans to ash
The cinders of this dying world

Watch your world disintegrate; the cinders of a dying world
