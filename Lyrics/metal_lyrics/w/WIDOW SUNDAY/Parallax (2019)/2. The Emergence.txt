First light, a new war starts inside my mind
A battle for the will to wear my mask and face the day
Hide behind the mask of someone who has met their match,
A beaten broken cog inside the wheel of the machine
I believe that they don't have control of me
I alone control my future, fate and destiny
The beast within is tearing at my outer being
And thus released, I relent, it begins devouring the dark

Be the explosion that shatters the world,
Breaking through the weakened flesh sustained by the old
If there's nothing worth saving, why do I fight?
Each bead of sweat, each drop of blood
I fight for my life!

Each and every one of us was given a gift,
The will to sustain and the strength to resist
Divided by the conflict that defines our days
Your weakness only strengthens all that we have attained.

Now is the time to make my mark
Annihilation of that empty shell

Be the explosion that shatters the world,
Breaking through the weakened flesh sustained by the old
If there's nothing worth saving, then why do I fight?
Each bead of sweat, each drop of blood
I fight for my life!

Be the explosion that shatters the world,
Breaking through the weakened flesh sustained by the old
If there's nothing worth saving, why do I fight?
Each bead of sweat, each drop of blood
I fight for my life!
