Once again another sleepless night deciding what to do
My bloodshot eyes will only see me descend into a haze
The days all seem to blur together
Can't tell which ones are real

Every night as I lie awake, the thoughts return; it all repeats
Take me now I can't stand this place.
Take me somewhere I won't feel this way

Round and round the cycle turns 'til I'm right back at the start
Every time I think I've won, that I've finally passed this test
I return to the same place that I left
But this won't be the end of me

Every night as I lie awake, the thoughts return; it all repeats
Take me now I can't stand this place.
Take me somewhere I won't feel this way

I don't need another hole in my head. The one I've got will do just fine.

When's my chance, my time to breathe?

Every night as I lie awake, the thoughts return; it all repeats
Take me now I can't stand this place.
Take me somewhere I won't feel this way
