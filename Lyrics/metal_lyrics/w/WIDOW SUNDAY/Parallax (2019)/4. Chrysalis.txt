Take me from this blackened state before I break and fall away
This body only takes so much.
Use the fear to keep me focused

How has this become my life?
This selfish hell

My mind won't accept the truth
Am I strong enough to keep you safe?
I don't know

I have felt the darkest thoughts grinding my brain into dust
Every other word I speak laced with anger and disgust

And then I see your face and it's surrounded by light
The sum of my love is alive in your eyes
This angel, the proof there is more I can be
The change, the fire you've ignited in me

New life granted
Your protector
I will crush all your detractors

I have felt the darkest thoughts grinding my brain into dust
Every other word I speak laced with anger and disgust

And then I see your face and it's surrounded by light
The sum of my love is alive in your eyes
This angel, the proof there is more I can be
The change, the fire you've ignited in me
