When our eyes connected; determined to love.
Everything was perfect, all I wanted to see
But soon infatuation turned into repulsion
And only made me realize I was better without you.

I look at you, you think of him
How long before you disappear?

I couldn't fuck you hard enough to save my life
I hope all the others taste better than mine

I hesitate, then the hatred all comes flooding back.
I am done hoping you will change someday.
This charade, has strengthened what I thought was lost.
It ends today.
Your blackened eyes won't ever turn me to stone.

At first the signs were subtle, then they started to show
I should have seen this coming; I know what you are
You had so infected me I thought you were real
Your actions speak louder than your screams ever will

I look at you, you think of him
How long before you will disappear?

Every day, in every way. So deceived and so betrayed.

Hide behind that little smile.
The one you used to fool all the others
You little slut,
Couldn't keep 'em closed long enough to get me out the door
I'm fucking done. I've seen enough.
I can't wait to take your head

I hesitate, then the hatred all comes flooding back.
I am done hoping you will change someday.
This charade, has strengthened what I thought was lost.
It ends today.
Your blackened eyes won't ever turn me to stone.
