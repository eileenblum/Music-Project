Slow down can't you see I'm trying to explain.
No okay now the summers really going to end.
Above the silver city. I'm always lost to her ways.
Some day I'm going to find. Someone true. Miana is her name.
She's so. Not okay here we go around and round again.
Today watch out as I'm eclipsed again.
Above the silver city. I'm always lost to her ways.
Someday I'm going to find someone true. Miana is her name. She's so.
I'm always lost to her ways. Some day I'm going to find someone true.
Miana is her name she's so blue. Now i feel slightly real.
Coming up for air.
