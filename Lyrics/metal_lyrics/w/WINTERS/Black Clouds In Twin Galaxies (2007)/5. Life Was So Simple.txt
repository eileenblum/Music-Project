You just see weakness. I build it sky high. Just to tear it down.
Stories of dark ways. That leafy chill will lead to from us all.
I took the long way down. I took the long way out. Ruins and pillars.
Within the art I place my discontent. Within the statues.
Forever frozen. Speak with wet cement.
Life was so simple. Life was so simple.
We would laugh and get through. Now just dark.
With the stars above you. Let them burn. Life was so simple.
