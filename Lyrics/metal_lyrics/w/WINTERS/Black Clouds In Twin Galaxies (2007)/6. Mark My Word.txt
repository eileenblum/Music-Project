Mark my word when I see you tonight.
Going to pass you through to the other side.
O my son don't you live in fear.
Keep your friends real close and your enemies.
O my son don't you live too long.
With the little things that keep going wrong.
Run from sun don't you feel the flame.
On the green grass to the mountain high.
It's not that simple. No matter what you do.
There's a dark place for you. You got to follow me to.
My son. There's no worries. Being a mess is mundane.
