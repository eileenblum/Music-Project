Someday soon I'll feel in control. I believe in everything wrong.
Fried every night till the start of the day.
I live my life in this beautiful way. Yeah.
One day soon she will despise. Guided by voices followed by lies.
Fried every night till the start of the day.
I live my life in this beautiful way. Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Come sit beside me won't you tell me what's wrong?
Can't find any wrong dear but you might live too long.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Someday soon I'll feel in control.
I've been leaving everything wrong.
