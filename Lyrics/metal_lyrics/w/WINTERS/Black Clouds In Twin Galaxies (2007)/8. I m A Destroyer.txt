Just keep on spreading disease. I don't care I do what I please.
And you keep telling me slow. I don't care I want to go wrong.
Don't matter who you used to know. Oh such a stupid game to play.
It's missing time all the time. Sort of missing someone here tonight.
And you keep telling me slow. I don't care I want to go wrong.
Don't matter who you used to know. It's such a stupid game to play.
It's killing time all the time. Sort of missing someone here tonight.
Girl. Don't know what to do.
