I woke up to find she is leaving.
On my own with the winter feeling.
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no. And the tales of my deceiving.
Then the break of day broke my evening.
Oh no oh no it's all gone wrong.
Oh no oh no it's all gone wrong. Now it's happening.
Oh no oh no it's all gone wrong. Oh no oh no it's all gone wrong.
Now it's happening, it's happening.
