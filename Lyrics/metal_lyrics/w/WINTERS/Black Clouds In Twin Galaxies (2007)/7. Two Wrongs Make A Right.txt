Missing you missing me. I just can't tell.
I don't know where I've gone it could be hell.
Find a place here to stay. Call it a home. Been around been around.
Dragging that stone. In the midst of it all. We both give up.
Time has passed friends fall down. Endorsed in black.
Found no place here to stay. Cannot get home.
Been around been around. Dragging that stone.
And then you got to go. I'm starting to feel it girl.
It just leads to confusion. Don't know what else to do.
