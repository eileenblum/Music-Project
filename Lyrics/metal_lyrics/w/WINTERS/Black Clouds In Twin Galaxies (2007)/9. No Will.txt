Nice life nice day. Nice life nice day. You suffer I just leave.
Nice life nice day. Got such a shallow hold.
Nice life nice day. Don't say you will if the will is won't.
Say you will if the will is won't
Try to hide it but your sicken yourself.
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.
Starting over with the damaged cells.
Little sequence to damage your health.
Inside your dreaming but outside you'll find.
Come around one more time.
