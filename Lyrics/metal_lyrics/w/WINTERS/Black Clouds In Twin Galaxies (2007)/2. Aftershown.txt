Meet me after show. Show me what I just don't know.
Hey Paul that's just not me. Where did he go.
Hey Paul I aim to please. Whatever you may need.
I dream of windswept cliffs. The cold the rain it fits.
Hey Paul that's just not me. Where did he go.
Hey Paul I aim to please. Whatever you may need.
Where is my mental health. Please don't wake me don't.
Don't wake me, don't wake me.
Watching that same old car crashing.
