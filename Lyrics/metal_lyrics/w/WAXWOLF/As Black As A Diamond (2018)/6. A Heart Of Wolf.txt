And I've never been so far from life
You showed me what the moon is like
The forest now so far behind
Then why am I so unafraid oh heart?

Heart of mine, I don't mind
Just be warm, we are you
And I and if I die to me lie
Don't let me know,
The chances past by

Oh heart

Heart you heat what he hears
But he has frozen you alive
Just sing this song to melt my tears
And force it stop me asking why

If I can't mind, just make me die
Just to remember me I'm alive
Show me what fear is like
So brain, you'll start to let me fight

Heart
Brain
Feel
Fear
Wolf
Forget
Apathy
Forest
Swallowed your
Heart
So
I
Must
Remember
You
The start

Make him feel panic, just pound violently
Force him remember past regrets,
Now just stop

Heart I lied we feel from mind, you're just a muscle pumping wide
Brain I've got promises to keep, so walk these miles, before I die.

Why are we lying to each other, why are you lying to me
Don't let me ask, don't want to bother, close my eyes, don't let me see

Freeze this moment in mind, freeze this moment in mind, freeze this moment in mind, freeze my mind

Gazing at mortality why you let me see

Gazing at mortality
Rip my eyes away
