Some say
If no one is watching
There is nothing to see
A changing behavior
In this exhibitionist matter breed

In illusions I form my identity
In distress I feel relief
The only reality is the intangible dream
I create to dwell in

I live the unraveling of time
Pointlessly going nowhere
As the seasons of my soul pass by
One by one

I waste my time wondering
Of all the possibilities
Of what could have been if
Me wasn't me in this form
Life starts getting strange if you
Don't believe real things to exist
Questions as is it fair?
Have no meaning at all
In the court of the dream king
Where trees have branches made of gold
I've found my companion in a bottle of envy
What I crave can't be found here
Among the mortals of this world
Because what I want are
All of the answers

In solitude I create
What I need to live
Longing for the end in my
Metaphysic prison

Keep on searching answers will arrive
Just like they've done for those before
You king of nothing king of everything
In your garden endlessly you'll thrive
