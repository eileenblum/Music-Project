White chains of remorse
Cover the landscape
Of my mind

The urgency of being
Makes you tend beyond
While an imperative denial
Echoes in your soul
And I curl up in my shadow
As time passes

While the mind is hand-cuffed by desire
Fear of death inspires creativity
And memories of sadness
Corrupt the clear vision of the whole

Time
Despot of life
Deaf to the prayers of reason
You are nothing but a ratio
Unfelt but not neglectable

I am annihilated
As time passes

So we recreate
The mandala of existence
As we were so well taught to do
Fall gives way to winter
Father gives way to son
