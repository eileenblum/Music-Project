Life is wonderful
I'm thrilled to be here
As a spark of lighting
As a splash of water

If you close your eyes and
Lay down a while in peace
In a field with grass and trees
With the sky above
You'd think of

Billions and billions of atoms
Endlessly binding and giving birth to
Billions and billions of life forms
Fighting from dawn to sunset on
Billions and billions of planets
Spinning and crashing and then there's you

On and on will grow the universe
Calm and wild it flows
Ancient as the existence itself

Beyond comprehension,
Life just happens to be
No one can outlast it,
As absurd as it is

You can travel far and search for nature's treasures
You can live the art, panacea of the wise man
Nothing is important
Nothing will remain of you

On and on will spin the universe.
Calm and wild, it flows
Ancient as the existence itself

Overwhelming fear of void takes over the mind and
Stops any drive that would make actions real

On and on will go the universe.
Calm and wild, it flows
Ancient as the existence itself
