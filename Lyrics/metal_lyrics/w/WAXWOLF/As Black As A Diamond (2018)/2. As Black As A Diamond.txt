Anguish, the queen
Has came back to dine with us,
We must prepare the table cloth
Made of tears and dust
Wait for the hourglass to stop
But don't waste your wishes
On more sand anymore

Crawling to a new state of unconscious fears
I need music to survive, creativity to live.
When solitude announces its malignant presence there is
No more will to fight,
Just another song to write

Everyone need to open wide their eyes
People need to stop from going towards their demise
We only have to tear down the walls we are setting to ourselves or
The circle will not end

Thou deserve to dine with the gods
At the end of the journey
But what if there hasn't been no journey at all?
So what would be the odds?

Concrete fears and plastic nightmares
Occupy my field of vision
No respect for anything
Except for your own profit
The man,
Once a diamond,
Has turned black

Just wait for a moment now
And think
Our life is too short for malice
Or depression or anxiety
If our mind is free from pain
We can overcome every border
To save us from those reapers
Our mind must be in order

But you became one with your shadow
And now you are lost

Please don't cry so much my friend
Because you are made of stars
And stars are made of eternity
And when this vile race will be no more
We'll be part of the everything again
