Tonight is the night of our lives
Our hearts so alone yet alive
You'll weep
so precious her heart is to keep
You're all I've got
and I'm all you have
lets save this story yet, hero and heroine
no...
Tell me what you seek
underneath the sheets (of snow)
bury me alive
inside this nightmare
i've built inside your eyes
and if you die in sleep
you'll scream so violently
so loud you'll wake the sun
as well as everyone
And I'll try my best to give you everything
that you've ever loved
And I'll try my best to give you everything as my heroine
These teeth are shields to protect these words from
everything that you've ever run from
Your mask of frozen beauty
contricts my stomach tight
and I wont let go, until its over
I'll never let my stare
meet the glare of your
blind eyes....blind eyes
But now our lives are over
your lips are shut as are my eyes
I whisper goodnight, my sweet Forever
And as for Paris..
He fell outside amongst her frozen air
He fell upon the snow that helps her sleep.
To find a way, out alive
chasing after this, i wont let you go
to find a way, out alone
the ground comes falling through, I wont let you fall
and as this world falls I wont let you go
I wont die until your blood stains my hands
Heres to my fate of catching her sleep
And I'll try my best to give you everything
that you've ever loved
And I'll try my best to give you everything as my heroine
These teeth are shields to protect these words from
everything that you've ever run from
fiction, with it, I create the end...
