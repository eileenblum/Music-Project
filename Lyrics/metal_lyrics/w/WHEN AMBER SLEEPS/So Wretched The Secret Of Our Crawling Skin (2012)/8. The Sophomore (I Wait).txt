In God's own words,
she swore she'd sleep forever.
I've never felt so sharp
and abandoned now.
You start to shake with regret,
i'll have to swallow my tongue.
You've never fallen so far so
keep your eyes on me.

I'll have to catch my own star,
cause yours has fallen from the sky.
I'll keep my eyes sewn awake so I can't dream of you.

Sing, as they fall into the sea,
as they scream "I'm okay".
They close their eyes,
and from their spines,
they sprout their wings.

Pull my hair out
as you return sideways
through my window
agape as the sky that
taught you to fall so far from grace,
stealing you away from faith.
Stealing you from faith.

Cold, cascading red that
flows like rivers from your eyes
and stains my hands,
suprise,
we're so in love tonight.
And take my heart
still beating from my chest.
Youre all I see in sleep.
My lovely tragedy in dream.

The long hand set on fire,
the short hands pointed at the sun,
and I know you won't walk away,
until i'm though with you.

Sing, as they fall into the sea,
as they scream "I'm okay".
They close their eyes,
and from their spines,
they sprout their wings.
