We Watch The Coast!
Embrace your lungs
cascading blue On your skin
water in my veins this salts a rush
I feel the sun reflect the ocean in your eyes
I'll take a breath cause this may be my last time with this sky
Breathe out, breathe in for me
tonight, you are the sea
Breathe out, breathe in for me
tonight, we are the sea
Julie, lets watch the sun
From up here we're angels to everyone
Julie, lets watch the sun
From up here we're angels to everyone
we're angels to everyone
ã
severed off and torn in through my sleep
inside my eyes, I see you effortlessly
As tides we're gone by dawn
and when you wake, they wander where we've gone
tonight, I'll show you the light
but i cant stay for long, until we meet again
I surrender to your unrelenting consciousness
and I take position

oh
Embrace your lungs
cascading blue on your skin
water in my veins this salts a rush
I feel the sun reflect the ocean in your eyes
I take a breath cause this may be my last time with this sky
Why would you let go, when it's almost over?
My eyes sleep for days yet they dream perfection
This is progression, this desolate feeling
effortless night, I love this ending.
Why would you let go, when this is all you love?
My eyes sleep for days yet they dream perfection
This is progression, this desolate feeling
effortless night, yet I love this ending....
