Your heart lies next to mine
but I can't bring it to life.
The start of something brings the end of our time;
we fade like pages.
Yet we'll bring the fight for the rest of our lives.
We are crusaders.

Agony fuels the flame that lights our way.
A hero dies so you can get away.
We earn our valor.
We fall behind your king.
There will be no escape.
Glory in galleries,
we fade behind your blade.
There will be no escape.
In turns of tide, we die in vain.
Fall behind your king.
There will be no escape.

Your heart lies next to mine,
yet it's cut open despite.
You're a monster.
You're a monster.
Hero, who's gonna save you this time?
You're hopelessly devoted to the one you lost.

Agony fuels the flame that lights our way.
A hero dies so you can get away.
We earn our valor.
We fall behind your king.
There will be no escape.
Glory in galleries,
we fade behind your blade.
There will be no escape.
In turns of tide, we die in vain.
Fall behind your king.
There will be no escape.

I'm still a ghost and you're still a liar.
You're still my heart because it won't beat.
You steal my blindest gaze.
I breathe just to scream your name.
I'll catch my breathe to scream your name.
I don't know why, but Ares, he chose you.
