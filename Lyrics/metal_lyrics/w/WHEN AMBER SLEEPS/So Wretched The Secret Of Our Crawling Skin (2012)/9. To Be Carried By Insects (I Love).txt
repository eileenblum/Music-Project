I won't lie
I'm not sure how
We're getting home
But if we do
I want to know
That you'll be
Waiting to
Taste... me...

We are smaller than you know
The words that we've built will fall,
This is where we tip toe...

We are smaller than you know
The words that we've built will fall,
This is where we tip toe...

You
You better hope you can find me
When this place creates cowards.
We'll never get home...

My dreams never
Made me bleed till I
Swallowed insects
Breeding nightmares
In my head

Regain composure
Again...

We are smaller than you know
The words that we've built will fall,
This is where we tip toe...

We are smaller than you know
The words that we've built will fall,
This is where we tip toe...

I can't control
The things that make you sweat
And everything
You won't forget
I believe in understanding,
I've created refuge.
I believe in you
And everything you've asked me to
For you.

Disaster, you're finally proving me wrong
With every choice in my veins
Through shattered voices
And blood in my lungs
I scream your name

Rip my mouth from my face
I will dream for you
Pilot
So never let me go
And if you don't return
I hope you know
Our love will grow...
