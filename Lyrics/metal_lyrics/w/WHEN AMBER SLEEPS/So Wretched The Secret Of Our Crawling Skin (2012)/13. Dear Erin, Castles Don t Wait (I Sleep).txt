Please, be honest with me
If I fall will you fall to? (Im all yours)
Please tell me the truth, If i die will you die too?(im all yours)

Take me, out of this horrid place

And i will pray for you
now take my, take my hand
and you'll know that I will pray for my angels

The time has come
to show yourself
when eye meets eye be calm
you hide your
face from what youve done
I hear hollow words
on your broken tongue

Just because we live with anchors doesnt make us afraid
of floating into the sky, for God to take us away.
Just because we live with anchors doesnt make us afraid
of floating into the sky for god to take us away.

wait for my last word, wait for it...
wait....for my last....word to you.

And i will pray for you
now take my, take my hand
and you'll know that I will pray for my angels

follow my lines
I wont be gone for long

So follow my lines, and chase me.

We'll hold hands side by side,
if you fall, than I fall too
dont let them take me
I wont let you fall (forever)
this is the blackest night
the darkest day of our lives
dont let them take me
youre everything
