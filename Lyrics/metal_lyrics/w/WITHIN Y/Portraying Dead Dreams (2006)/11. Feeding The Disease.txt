Such a great lie
All these memories will live on as fakes
Brought behind the scenery
Every time do we have what it takes
Fake words, fake promises
A burden so heavy to bear
Will time really change our ways
Release our fears
When can we let our worries be
Take back control
Swallowed all our tears after feeding on this awful disease
Fake words, fake promises
A burden so heavy to bear
Will time really change our ways
Release our fears
When can we let our worries be
Take back control
