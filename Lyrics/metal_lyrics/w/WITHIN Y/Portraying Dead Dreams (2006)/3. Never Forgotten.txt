Forged and betrayed
Your mind is set to deceive
Appreciate nothing and fill your heart with a filthy disease
And by all means you choke life and it's purpose
A genetic heritage
Never forgotten

Fear is what you cannot bear
A reckoning urge to believe
Nothing more can save you
From being a used puppet
Mass hypnosis taking over senses
Malicious intent breaking the boundaries

A dead memory awakens to see
Can't you see what you hide?
A terminal vermin
That feed on your soul
On weak and trembling steps
You fall to the ground
This is your day to witness
Your own funeral

Fear is what you cannot bear
A reckoning urge to believe
Nothing more can save you
From being a used puppet
Mass hypnosis taking over senses
Malicious intent breaking the boundaries
