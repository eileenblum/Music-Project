In this search of man
He returns into the shadows
After showing his relentless urge
To never give up
You cannot see him
Feel a new fear embrace you cold
Panic is near his footsteps you cannot hear
Can never feel repent
Will never feel remorse
Just set to fulfill his violent course
Beg for a new life
Will make his smile so wide
Be proud
He won't take my life
Enjoy your begging
Now you'll die
A man that has sworn to hate
A past to forget but not to forgive
Lost his courage
And his will to succeed
Sinking deeper down in lies
So pure, so fast
A greater fear to be served
Will he ever tell right from wrong
Can never, can never
Will never, will never
Just set to fulfill his violent course
Can never feel repent
Will never feel remorse
Just set to fulfill his violent course
