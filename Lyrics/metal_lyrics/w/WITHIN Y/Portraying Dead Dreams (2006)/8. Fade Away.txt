As predicted I'm brought to this world alone
Abused, repeatedly broken down
Boundaries that haunts me like a plague wears me down
Existing paths leads life away
Leads life away
And if this is all there is
What if this is it
Fading away
A world so full of illusions
A world so full of lies
Fading away
A soul awaits the eternal
A soul left to die
And if this is all there is
What if this is it
Knowing that the pain won't cease
Convicted
Existing paths leads life away
Leads life away
