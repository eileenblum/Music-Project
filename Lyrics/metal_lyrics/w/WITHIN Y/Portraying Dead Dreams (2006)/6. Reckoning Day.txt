A black sky over my head
Watch the sun engulfed and perished
A dead mind, a dead kind
A dead future to take lead
Absolute hatred, a denying wish
Reached the limit of what I can take
I rest on bleeding knees
Demolished and burned
The fate of awake, awake
I see faces of suffering
Portraying dead dreams
Decaying I walk aligned
To wires sewn into my eyes
A failure to the point of no salvation
Faces of trauma
All bricks have fallen in
Narrow paths to lead us astray
I see faces of suffering
I wreck space to see what comes my way
I walk aligned
To wires sewn into my eyes
I see faces of suffering
Portraying dead dreams
Decaying I walk aligned
To wires sewn into my eyes
Wires are sewn to my eyes
