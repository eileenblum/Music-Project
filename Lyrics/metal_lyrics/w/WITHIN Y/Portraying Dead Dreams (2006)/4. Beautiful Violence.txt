In my empty head
Nothing to care about
Blindfolded
Sleepless nights
Why all this shame

A weaker mind for every day is this real
Sitting in the empty black our everyday
Beautiful violence
Neverending ignorance

Returning my focus
Trying to keep my grip
I see your delight in my mistakes a thousand times

A weaker mind for every day is this real
Sitting in the empty black our everyday
Beautiful violence
Neverending ignorance

I will never forget
Hear me now
Silently I wonder
Am I going under
You don't seem to regret
Hear me now
Will I face tomorrow

Returning my focus
Trying to keep my grip
I see your delight in my mistakes a thousand times

Beautiful violence
Neverending ignorance
Silent wonder
