Preacher, tell me what I have to say
What I need to be
Listener, will you go my way
Will you believe my words
We need a new breed to shape up
What has been struck down
Collapsing piece endless flows
All structure's uncontrolled
Uncontrolled
Liar, this must be your secret plan
Your source of inspiration
Victim, show your bleeding eyes
Don't shove your head in the sand
Who will remember when you're gone
It's so deceiving and it feels so wrong
Will they really grow another one
A heart so torn
Does it make you strong
Show us the new breed to shape up
What has been struck down
Collapsing piece endless flows
All structure's uncontrolled
Who will remember
It's so deceiving
A heart so torn
This heart so torn
