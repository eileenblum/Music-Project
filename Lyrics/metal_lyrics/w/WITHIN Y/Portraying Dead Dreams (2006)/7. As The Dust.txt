We draw us to silence
'Cause we are
Marked by our feeble minds
We are awake from slumber
Don't you stipulate
Don't make amend
We are awake from slumber
Recharged by fear
I swallow the anxiety
Be as the dust
This time it won't come easy on you
Breaking out from your distorted thoughts of reality
Watch them crawl to where you never have been
Is this the way?
Nothing's what it used to be
A slave to our own minds
Is that where we'll stay?
Recharged by fear
I swallow the anxiety
Be as the dust
This time it won't come easy on you

Will you see through
What's really left
Will it be you or will you burst
Will you see through
What's really left
Will it be you
This time you'll burn
