We are just a standing illusion
Merged into a primal being
A sickening fusion
All of us in the shadow of dust
In us there's nothing but rust
Withered pieces of minds so forlorn
We are falling down
And we're all back in this mess
An impulse to create
Fear to be something
We are the mesh
And we put you all back in this mess
We are the mesh
That succumbs to greed
Undo the state of mind
An attempt of seeing
So blinded, so restrained
Just beg for hope
Not to converge
We are the unjust being
Not to converge
We are the unjust being
