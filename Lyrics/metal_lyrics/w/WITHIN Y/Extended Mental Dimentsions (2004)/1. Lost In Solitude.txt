As I walk through the mists of life, drowned by the things I behold
Struggle to find what lies within, like the stories I've been told

Ruined lives, ruined futures, fallen hopes, fallen dreams

As the chirping birds dies into silence, forever crying as they falls to the ground
Have all life in this dreamworld ceased flowering? I'll find myself forever trapped herein

The sun struck me blind, and left me empty and cold
To mourn my loss of life, my loss of life

Forced to open my wound once again, and not knowing what there's to find
As sworn to a life in silence, why can't I leave this behind

Ruined lives, ruined futures, fallen hopes, fallen dreams

As the chirping birds dies into silence, forever crying as they falls to the ground
Have all life in this dreamworld ceased flowering? I'll find myself forever trapped herein

The sun struck me blind, and left me empty and cold
To mourn my loss of life, my loss of life

Go!

As sworn to a life in silence, Why can't I leave this behind

The sun struck me blind, and left me empty and cold
To mourn my loss of life, my loss of life
