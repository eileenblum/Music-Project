Come on taste my anger, built of my shell of pain
Be strong, you're the saviour, rape of a broken soul
You will heal my wounds as I make your trust collapse
No more telling the world, why can't you see what you will be?

Taste my anger of my shell of pain
Your'e the saviour of a broken soul
Heal my wounds, I make your trust collapse again!
Let us feel more than sorrow, why won't you guide us through
Break out and live forever, cant take this hell no more
You will heal my wounds as I make your trust collapse
No more telling the world, why can't you see what you will be?

Silence! As if it all came down, tortured and feeble, as we

Heal my wounds, I make your trust collapse again, AGAIN!

Silence! As if it all came down, but yet so feeble and weak
Silence! As if it all came down, tortured and feeble, as we

Heal my wounds, I make your trust collapse again!

SILENCE!..... SILENCE!

Silence! As if it all came down, but yet so feeble and weak
Silence! As if it all came down, tortured and feeble, as we
