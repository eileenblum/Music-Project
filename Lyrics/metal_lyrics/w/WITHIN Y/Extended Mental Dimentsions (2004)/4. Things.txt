As the rain keeps pouring down, everything's so sad and cold
Learning to live with it all, learning to live with it all
Sometimes it seemes like it all stands still
Sometimes it feels like, my own will

Awaiting it all to come, damaged as life upon
Never will we be free, TORTURED!
All the tears that we've shed, reflecting ourselves within
Pale, white, by myself outburned..

The things we touch makes us feel nothing more than
Than the shiver down our spines
The things we touch makes us feel nothing more than
Than the shiver down our spines

All the tears that we've shed, reflecting our selves within
Pale, white, by myself outburned..

As the rain keeps pouring down, everything's so sad and cold
Learning to live with it all, learning to live with it all
Sometimes it seemes like it all stands still
Sometimes it feels like, my own will

The things we touch makes us feel nothing more than
Than the shiver down our spines
The things we touch makes us feel nothing more than
Than the shiver down our spines
