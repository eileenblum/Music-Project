This world of, confusion, suffocates our greatest dreams
Feeding the disease, silently leaving, this behind
Searching, the towers, for the colours of the world
Feeding the disease, silently leaving this behind

I'm screaming, for a life so well designed,
Stranded in this mental abusion
I'm dreaming of a life less fragile
A life so well designed

Outgrown innocence, we live in endless denial
We're hoping for a cure, to late to fake it all, away
Finding the colours, our time to set it off
We're hoping for a cure, to late to fake it all, away

I'm screaming, for a life so well designed,
Stranded in this mental abusion
I'm dreaming of a life less fragile
A life so well designed
