...En, tvÃ¥, tre, fyr.
Why can't you see, this ain't meant to be
The world falls down, no time left
Eye for an eye, they slowly wipes it out
Tooth for a tooth, welcome down

You've reached the point of no return
No use to struggle as you fall, Face down.
You've reached the world where all souls burn
Face down your lie

Your mind plays tricks with your soul as you fall
Deep down, the silence is total
Still awake to feel it fade away
The nails dig in, and rips you up
Begging it to end, NEVER!
Pain devine, forever!

You've reached the point of no return
No use to struggle as you fall, Face down.
You've reached the world where all souls burn
Face down your lie

Why can't you see, this is what you'll be
The world falls down, it all fades away
Eye for an eye, they slowly wipes it out
Tooth for a tooth, welcome down

You've reached the point of no return
No use to struggle as you fall, Face down.
You've reached the world where all souls burn
Face down your lie
