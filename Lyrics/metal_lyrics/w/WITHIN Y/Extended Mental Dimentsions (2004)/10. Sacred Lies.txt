Reborn, to have the will to kill, to search the highest ground, for penetrating carnage
In the absence of light, I stand tall to feel, resurrection from above
Brought down beaten up, will make my way up again..

Nullified by your lack of tolerance, I betray your sacred lies
Lies that will only be stronger, I betray them sacred lies...

Disincarnate the structure, the folded blindness, by the hand of GOD
The liar above. created to mislead us humans

Cleansing the soul to havoc the cries that deafens the skies of tomorrow
In the weakest moment, we seed our dorment realms of destiny's embrace

Nullified by your lack of tolerance, I betray your sacred lies
Lies that will only be stronger, I betray them sacred lies...
