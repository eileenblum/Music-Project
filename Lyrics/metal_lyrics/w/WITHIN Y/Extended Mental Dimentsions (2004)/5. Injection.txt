Abused by perfection, choked on expected ideals
A new world, a new disorder, through the boundries we'll walk
Devastated!

Fall down to gain perspective, to see the light
Severe, drained observations, confidential words of lies

Extended mental dimensions, embraced by the weaker sense
Revealed by the hidden structures, reality breaks, REALITY BREAKS!!

Fall down to gain perspective, to see the light
Severe, drained observations, confidential words of lies

As this bitter sweet injection, view the world through the selfdestructive, selfdestructive eye!
As a weaker state of mind, protected by pale reflections
Depart this fragile human life..

Abused by perfection, choked on expected ideals
A new world, a new disorder, through the boundries we'll walk
Extended mental dimensions, embraced by the weaker scence
Revealed by the hidden structures, reality breaks, REALITY BREAKS!!

As this bitter sweet injection, view the world through the selfdestructive, selfdestructive eye!
As a weaker state of mind, protected by pale reflections
Depart this fragile human life..
