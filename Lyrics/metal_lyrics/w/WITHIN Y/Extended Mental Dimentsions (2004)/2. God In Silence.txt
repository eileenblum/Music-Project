Bound to serve the brick on your chest
You watch it grow 'til you burst into dust
Sadistic thoughts of what you should be
Be chosen, be special, a human god

.....you will be the one that's choosen
In this descending world of lies...

Your wounds won't seem to heal
It's everlasting, do you even know what's real
It's everlasting, do you even know what's real?

Perfect by nature you close your eyes to disappear
But will it help you in your descending world of lies?
Trying to figure how it really feels
To be choosen, be special, a human god

...you will be the one that's chosen
In this decending world of lies...

Your wounds won't seem to heal
It's everlasting, do you even know what's real
It's everlasting, do you even know what's real?

Bound to serve, the brick on your chest
You watch, It grows, sadistic thoughts of what you should be

Your wounds won't seem to heal
It's everlasting, do you even know what's real
It's everlasting, do you even know what's real?
