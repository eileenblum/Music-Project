Virtual thoughts of insanity from emotional chaos
This lonely life you are roaming in won't let you
Feed your emotions with joy, a lesson learned in life
Behold what you had, behold what you had!

You want me to ease your suffering
Why can't you gather your thoughts and
Blame no one!

So come on! And I'll follow you wherever you will go
So sad, your possesion keeps you down
So come on! And I'll follow you wherever you will go
So sad! Your possesion makes you drown.

With a broken smile for no reason
All your laughs in vain
I count the days to the killing season
Where I will put you to constant pain
A lesson learned in life
Behold what you had, BEHOLD WHAT YOU HAD!

You want me to ease your suffering
Why can't you gather your thoughts and
Blame no one!

So come on! And I'll follow you wherever you will go
So sad, your possesion keeps you down
So come on! And I'll follow you wherever you will go
So sad! Your possesion makes you drown.

Feed your emotions with joy, a lesson learned in life
Behold what you had, behold what you had!
