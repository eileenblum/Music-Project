Once of Northern blood
Death and tragedy
Everything in you
Ghosts and mystery

Under the grey banners of skies
Where falcons sing their pride
What haunts your iron dreams
Motherland Ostenvegr?

Endless fields
Mists and horrid woods
Barrows by the riverbanks
And autumn wind above

Long forgotten songs
Human bones in the dirt
Helmets and swords in rust
The smell of graves and autumn soil

Mighty olden oaks
Always speak to me
With their grim voices of the dead
With their neverfading memories

Once of Northern blood
Death and tragedy
Everything in you
Ghosts and mystery
