Caught in a landslide of emotional hypocrisy
Would you let me breathe
Stars have fallen as time began
This was the first war that started everything

Power
An overwhelming concept
Full of pride and lust
One by one
They fell straight through the rising sun

Blood red eyes staring lifeless in what was our past
Give me strength through this aftermath
From the highest of heights come crashing down
Look to the sky watch them fly as they hit the ground

This is war
War on humanity
Now we know that your fall was your destiny
We hear the voices
The endless voices
Bred from desire

And you're too late
Caught up in all your praise
Until you hit the ground
But now you tremble
At the mention of his name

Imprisoned cast out and abandoned
As you wait for the pit to open
Time has passed ignored but not forgotten
A second coming will give rise to the thoughtless

This is war
War on humanity
Now we know that your fall was your destiny
We hear the voices
The endless voices
Bred from desire

This was the first war
That started everything
