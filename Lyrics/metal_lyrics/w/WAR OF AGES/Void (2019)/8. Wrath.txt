What you seek is revenge
No matter who is put before you
What you seek is revenge
No matter who is put before you

Violence a faceless ploy to cover up your
Vengeance and attitude playing into
Violence flow from the heart bleeding into
Vengeance the act itself leads us to these open wounds

We feel retaliation
In the wake of what we lost
Leads us in retaliation
Of an act that you'll regret

Are you ready to fall
Will retribution
Destroy the fabric
Of everything that you are

Violence a faceless ploy to cover up your
Vengeance and attitude playing into
Violence flow from the heart bleeding into
Vengeance the act itself leads us to these open wounds

A world stuck in violence!

Violence a faceless ploy to cover up your
Vengeance and attitude playing into
Violence flow from the heart bleeding into
Vengeance and attitude playing [?]

What you seek is revenge
No matter who is put before you
What you seek is revenge
No matter who is put before you
