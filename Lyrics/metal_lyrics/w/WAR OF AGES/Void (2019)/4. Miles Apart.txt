This life is hell without you
My world is fading faster now

If you would search the bounds of time
To have me back for a moment
If I would turn away from the fire
Your strength would carry my soul

Drowning in my sweat
Retribution
If I live one more day without you
The shadows are more than I can bare
Take me from this nightmare

This life is hell without you
I would trade it all to feel you
My world is fading faster now

Find strength
Through the suffering
Skies turn black
But the sun will rise
Find strength
Through the suffering
Lord reign down, let your power fall

Biting on my tongue
Holding my breath
I will die and my heart will follow
Your death on the cross
Showed me true love
Set us on fire

Find strength
Through the suffering
Skies turn black
But the sun will rise
Find strength
Through the suffering
Lord reign down, let your power fall

If you would turn away from the fire
Your strength would consume my soul

This life is hell without you
I would trade it all to feel you
My world is fading faster now
