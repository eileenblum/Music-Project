I will fight for you
Take my hand
I will fight for you
Together we stand

Iron sharpens iron
As one man sharpens another
Carnally minded
Will lead you on a path to death

Lead me through this life of flesh
Through Christ we have been set free
We are led by His love
We are free from our fear

For we are saved by hope
Hope placed in what is not seen
We are free from our fear

Your glory shall be revealed in us

Reveal the Son of God
