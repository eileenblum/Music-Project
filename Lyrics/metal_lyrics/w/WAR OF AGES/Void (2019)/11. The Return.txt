A world covered in violence and crying out
Oh, the fear is never ending
I pray that soon his Son will return
Fulfill the promise of your spoken word

The sky rips open as we are faced with truth
Truth in judgment as He boldly makes war
Eyes set ablaze and on his head sits many crowns
You are the Word of God

He was dipped in blood
You are known as the Word of God
Blameless are the intentions
And faultless are the acts of war

Eyes set ablaze as you see the truth
And put your faith in something else
Built your strength upon the sands of time
And you knew it wouldn't last

Right from his mouth comes
Sharp words striking down every nation
As He rules them all with the rod of iron
The fury of his wrath striking down
From an almighty God

Eyes set ablaze as you see the truth
And put your faith in something else
Built your strength upon the sands of time
And you knew it wouldn't last

This is Your spoken word

A world covered in violence and crying out
Oh, the fear is never ending
I pray that soon his Son will return
Fulfill the promise of your spoken word

A world covered in violence and crying out
Oh, the fear is never ending
I pray that soon his Son will return
Fulfill the promise of your spoken word
