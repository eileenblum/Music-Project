More than you need
Your degree of intolerance
To control the power of life
Versus the want that plagues your mind

You've exhausted the basics
A never-ending effort to satisfy your needs
Crawling in the pit by yourself
Empty are your words as you reap what you sow

This is your symphony
I will stand and be somebody
Who will rise and meet you there
I know that you are able

You count the cost
Money won't buy you a spotless life
Greed will control every part of who you are

We won't lose control
