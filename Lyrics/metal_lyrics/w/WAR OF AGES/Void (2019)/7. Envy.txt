Close your eyes and kiss your faith goodbye
The lack in qualities will cause you to stumble

And emotion that's crippling your conscience
Gives way to a complex case of jealousy
Stirring the envy's stirring
Passion is set on the flame of desire
You want it all
And take what you want while others fail

Relive your lie
It's built on the backs of what others lack
Relive your lie
In pain at the sight of others misfortune

A sickness is growing from the inside
A failure of human instinct
A crossroad to avoid a state of aggression

Jealous envy fearful vicious nightmare
