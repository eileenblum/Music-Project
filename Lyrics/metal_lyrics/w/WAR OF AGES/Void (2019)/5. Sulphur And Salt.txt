Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
Pillar of salt in the making
You can run, but you can't hide
This is judgment
This is judgment

Step inside these walls and watch them crash down
The air is sucked out as these cities burn
Reminded of life and the way it once was
Harsh realities crimes against integrity

We'll rise
From the ashes
Standing in the midst of my mistakes
We'll rise
From the ashes
Standing in the midst of my mistakes

Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
Pillar of salt in the making
You can run, but you can't hide
This is judgment
This is judgment

I will be with you
When you pass through the waters
I will be with you
Approach the throne with boldness
I will be with you
When you pass through the waters
I will be with you
Approach the throne with boldness
I will be with you

I will, I will be with you
I will, I will be with you

We'll rise
From the ashes
Standing in the midst of my mistakes
We'll rise
From the ashes
Standing in the midst of my mistakes

When you pass through the waters
I will be with you
Approach the throne with boldness
I will be with you
When you pass through the waters
I will be with you
Approach the throne with boldness
I will be with you
