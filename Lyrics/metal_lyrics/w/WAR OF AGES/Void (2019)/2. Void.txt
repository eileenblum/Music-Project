Separated from darkness!

Bone of my bone
And flesh of my flesh
Created by the hand of God
The purest form of creation

Living water
Flowing from my soul
The future of my heart is with you
Living water
Flowing from my soul
The future of my heart is with you!

Out of the ground we were born after darkness
Round two but in the image of God
Free will but in the context of love
Foundation in faith, foundation in faith

Covered by darkness and formed into light
His breath of life flows through our veins
Never fail us, you will never fail us

Bone of my bone
And flesh of my flesh
Created by the hand of God
The purest form of creation

Living water
Flowing from my soul
The future of my heart is with you
Living water
Flowing from my soul
The future of my heart is with you!

Out from darkness!
Out from darkness!
