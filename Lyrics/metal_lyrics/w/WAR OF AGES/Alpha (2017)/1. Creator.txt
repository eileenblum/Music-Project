Creator
We are the hope
We are the faceless
We are humanity

Make me a god and turn us creator
How foolish am I
Look at us and what weâve become
Weâre losing sight of humanity

By the hands of man
Though you canât understand
Will it last you forever
You are full of lies
Denied by all of your pain
Will it last you forever

No more questions
So follow me
Stripped of consequence
No questions asked
Blinded by false hope
You are the great I am

Consequences stripped blinded by false hope
You see the face of their god
This creation has become the creator
You see the face of my God

We are the creation
You see the face of my God
