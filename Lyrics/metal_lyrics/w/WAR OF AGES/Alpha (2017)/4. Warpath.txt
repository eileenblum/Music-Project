Your spirit is in conflict
Idle hands are driven by your own design
Baptized in the blood of the innocent
Here's your god here's your god

You played your selfish game
And reached a tipping point
Enslaved by deception
My God is everlasting
Enslaved in a world of impurity

Here is your platform of
Mass destruction
Pointing your finger like you know me
Only believing in the one true God
And your pride shall come as they fall

We are bound by honor and integrity
God give us the courage on this battleground

You wanted to save me
You promised and told a lie
I feel like it's over
We are drowning

Cover me

The false peace only brought you pain
Shifting the blame and feeling the pressure
In the moment in every moment
These idle hands have made you a slave
