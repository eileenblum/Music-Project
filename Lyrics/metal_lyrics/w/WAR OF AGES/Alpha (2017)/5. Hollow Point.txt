I stand before you
We find ways to hide our attention
Fall down on your knees
Find fault in the lines of addiction

Cuts become the violation
Defined by the edge of a knife
And broken and worthless I am worthless
Defined by the edge of a knife
Will this nightmare end

Now turn away
Iâm dying inside
Iâm breathing without you
Iâve fallen before

Now turn away

Take the gun fill the clip your choice now cock it
You scream release
One life nothing more in this reality trip
You scream my God my God my God

Take a step back

We are the voice
We are the voice of the broken

Bow down to your knees
Burn through the ashes
