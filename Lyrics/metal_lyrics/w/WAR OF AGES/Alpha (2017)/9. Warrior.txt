The final conflict of our moral right
Expectations becoming dead straight to the core

Look into the mirror
I am responsible
Look into the mirror
My reflection is what I've become
Staring straight right through the heart

Liar plagued by your sin
Forgiven redeemed by the blood of the lamb

From the moment of creation
Our roles are not reversible
Society kills our relationship
Driving a wedge between us

I will never be held down
By your false belief
We rise to our feet
Making a stand
For the world to see

Stay the course
As the pressure falls on you
Never back down
Revived by the flames
As the heat holds you in

Fight through the emotion
Reaching the highest depth
Reach down to me
Set me on fire
Setting your spirit free
