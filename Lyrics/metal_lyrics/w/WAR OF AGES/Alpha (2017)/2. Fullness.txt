Welcome to the free world bear your cross
Through the lines of a mine field
Find a pulse beneath the dive bomb
Social reform will never bury me

God give me the strength to carry though
We'll battle on we will battle on
Stand firm in the light of his Son
We'll battle on we will battle on

It burns within us
Holding all we know
Let him heal you

So hold me in your arms
And let me dwell within your favor
Lead me through the fullness of you
Never let go

Even when my flesh takes over me
We'll battle on we will battle on
We trust in the heart of his Son
We'll battle on we will battle on

I will stand in the midst of his design
Culture revive humiliation of my condition
