Shut your mouth burst through insanity
Controlling the minds from the moment of conception
Holding the youth in the peak of their innocence
Crawling around in the dark for weakness
Shedding light in the home feeding corruption
Breathing death instead of life in full motion

Pride comes before the fall
Open your eyes before the lies sink in
God give them eyes to see
Dying inside burn through integrity

Will they ever see through deception
Balancing beneath insecurity
I will never lose my connection
Following throughout all eternity

Fill the void of the cross with broken dreams
It's a play to rip you from reality
Give us strength let them see what they've done to me
Don't let them be swept away by society
