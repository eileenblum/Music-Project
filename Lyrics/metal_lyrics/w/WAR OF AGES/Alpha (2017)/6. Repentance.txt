Choke you choke on the lies of perfection
Crawling back to the god you've become

What you face is a constant reminder
To the pain that you caused with your flesh

Severely devoted to myself
Revealing it all in a moment
Why can't you wait why can't you wait for me
And hold me through the storm

You'll pay the price
She's crawling back to you
You'll pay the price
Buried alive in the depths of a mine field

Choke imbalanced waves of imperfection
Your world has now been broken
Flesh is the breath of her affection
No rest when you're abandoned

Will you save me from myself before I break
I will surrender to your name before I break

Rip your soul from the inside
Looking at us to forgive to forgive
Tear your soul from the inside
Life is a trap when you're abandoned

It grabs your soul
While ripping you
From the inside
She's crawling back

Pride will be the curse of your destruction
The truth is buried within your heart
