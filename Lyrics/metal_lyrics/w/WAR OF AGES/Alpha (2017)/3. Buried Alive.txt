Rise and fall
Set me on fire
Kill the pain
Tear out my fear

Choke the fear from my heart
Falling through this world
Break the chains that bind me
Watch it burn away

Show me how we can protect them
Overwhelmed by hate
Will I learn how to reach you
Overwhelmed by hate

Fear of what the world will think
Shattered by death and truth
Crossed over the constant
Fear of my repentance

Blind by rage
Buried alive
Rise and fall
Carried through death
