The annihilation of our souls
Bring forth the last known resistance of lies
This is the re-birth of our systems failure
How quickly we crawl away from the masses
The distance has fallen, trusting in failure
How quickly we run fearing our death
You liar
Bleeding for nothing
Your healer
Dying forever
The vision is oh so clear if only we'd focus
The rising rebellion moves slowly
From reaction of fear
As the answers we're looking for begin to unveil
While death makes it's way through our lives
Leading to failure
Will we allow our fate to fade away,
In these passing days?
Take your place at his right hand
For we alone are faithful
We are the rising rebellion of lies
No place for the weak rising
