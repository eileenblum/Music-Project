For what feels like a life time I stood my ground
I felt nothing could touch me until now
Fall, and then you watch me, Fall
The warrior inside me is crying out
Set your face like a flint and stand your ground
Fall, and then you watch me, Fall
Never wanted, never wished for
My failures to hold me back
The only thing worth meaning
Is falling through the cracks
Will I find what I am looking for?
My very own existence
May cost me everything
My existence is overtaking me
I'm hoping and praying for a chance to live
The undying mistakes that I've made
Has set my life apart and now I'm free
Live for something, Hope for nothing
Regardless of what it's worth
The battle for something greater
Is crawling up your back
