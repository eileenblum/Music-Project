Desire is over taking me
Arousing the essence of my soul
Bow to the pressure
While tearing your life apart
Your denial causes
A simple pathetic plea
As you bow in honor and
Choke on your words
The lessons keep on coming
As desire starts to fade
As the healing hand of reason
Comes closer and closer
Will the answers still be the same?
Regardless of what it's worth
I'm holding still holding on
To the god of my mistakes
Rise from the pressures destroying the walls of Rome
Lies of deception eating away at your flesh
Fight the pain of deception
We are not alone
I Can always count on you
Fill the dying dream as your feelings begin to die
Your reason for living drowns every retreating nerve.
