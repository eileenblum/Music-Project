Failure to include an explanation
Our lives breathe no excuse of this
It's our fault if we don't amount to anything
How frequently we point the blame to our failures
Is this what we call freedom or liberation?
A distance far too great for words
Our focus is based off of what we say I had it all
As actions are a footnote of the past
I wanted something real
Hoping you would stay
As our voices fade
We'll find out what this means
I hear your calling reveal your heart
When pride fades
You need no explanation here's my heart
And I am yours
There is no greater gift then this
Our anger flows in every breath
When man made passion starts to fade
In fear will you be standing here?
When voices fade on passion
Will your hearts still burn through failure?
