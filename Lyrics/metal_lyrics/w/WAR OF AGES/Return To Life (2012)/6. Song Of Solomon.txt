I will never break from the promise, you failed to make
Redefined by hate of the broken come and ease the pain

I can't stop myself from falling over the hate you recover the restless
Ramming words down your throat as the image of hope holds itself to blame
how can you resist the burning in your soul to set the world of at ease
I felt peace in my heart from the moment your words came from out of the dark

Your words will fall upon the strength of man
We rise above the flames
As we pass through fear will the strength remain
We will rise through fear I remember when I was held down so tight
I never felt like I would breather again hoping you would remember me and now I finally see you again-
I broke down the moment I left you standing on the fence-
I never should have left

I release myself to the oncoming storm-
asking God to protect me maybe I'm ready to change
so I start with the past and work my way to the top-
see through darkness as I bend at the knees as you grab my hands-
I stand up and raise your hands, let it consume you

Your words will fall upon the strength of man-
We rise above the flames-
As we pass through fear will the strength remain again-
Hoping you would remember me and now I finally see you again
I broke down the moment I left you standing on the fence I never should have left
I will never break from the promise you failed to make redefined by hate of the broken come and ease the pain
