Arise, arise.
Will you remember me?
Arise, arise.
Only truth will set you free

Arise, arise.
Will you remember me?
Arise, arise.
Only truth will set you free

What am I afraid of?
I'm tired of running scared
I feed among weakness
My pain is wearing thin

The calling of life filled with fear
Every movie we make
We rise

Renew my strength
Renew my strength now
I held it in
Waiting for you lord

I've fallen asleep
Hoping death will give me rest
The loneliness without you holds me in

Renew my strength
Renew my strength now
I held it in
Waiting for you lord

I've fallen asleep
Hoping death will give me rest
The loneliness without you holds me in

We blame it on weakness
Instead of on yourself
Take a look at your world
Ignoring everything you felt

You've become the god you serve
Your foundation's built on glass

Will you remember me?

Arise, arise.
Will you remember me?
Arise, arise.
Only truth will set you free

Arise, arise.
Will you remember me?
Arise, arise.
Only truth will set you free

Renew my strength
Renew my strength now
I held it in
Waiting for you lord

I've fallen asleep
Hoping death will give me rest
The loneliness without you holds me in

Renew my strength
Renew my strength now
I held it in
Waiting for you lord

I've fallen asleep
Hoping death will give me rest
The loneliness without you holds me in

I will never turn my back on you
Bearing the weight of the world

I will never turn my back on you
Bearing the weight of the world

Will you remember me?
Will you remember me?
Will you remember me?
Will you remember me?
