The tide has met the sand covering footprints left for me --
Hope is gone yet you carry me
You're carrying me
God my flesh is weak oh it's battling me, it's battling me
I hold no regrets and yet you wait for me
You know my heart now
If these walls could talk would they reflect your name

God give me the strength I need
Light the path through the fear
Let it change your heart
I will not lose sight of you
I will not let this fall through

You were there for me through all the pain I felt
We lift you higher than ever
You are the same the great I am
We lift you higher than ever

Set my eyes to flames while the weight of the world is holding me back
I felt like I could do it myself
You knew I was wrong and yet you played it the same
Here we are at the foot of the cross asking god to bleed

God give me the strength I need
Light the path through the fear
Let it change your heart
I will not lose sight of you
I will not let this fall through

I am a slave to nothing nor am I of this world
As we rise to our feet we walk the narrow road

You were there for me through all the pain I felt
We lift you higher than ever
You are the same the great I am
We lift you higher than ever
