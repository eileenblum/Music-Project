As your world starts to crumble becoming your battleground
Will you stay silent, where is your faith now?
Over every wound, every scar that you earned
Will you stand up and back away or face the flames?

Now as you

Follow eyes up front as you hit the floor
Take from it strength this is what we were all made for
[x2]

Fallen I am yet bound by flesh why can't I face this alone
Or was I expected to break through the eye of the storm
Foolish you are and by your hands you'll never find out the truth
For you have been blinded and now you are lost in the waves of your lies

As your world starts to crumble becoming your battleground
Will you stay silent, where is your faith now?
Over every wound, every scar that you earned
Will you stand up and back away or face the flames?

Now as you

Follow eyes up front as you hit the floor
Take from it strength this is what we were all made for
[x2]

Caught by the tail with a gun and faithless
Will the answers come when the stuggles start falling again
Ignoring all the questions you built while the weight of the world rest on you
The crosses you'll bare the answers you'll find won't pull you away from the path
As you see this through all you have won't cross with the state of your mind
