We bring ourselves down and [?]
The final act we despise
We wear our scars as a constant reminder
About you Father we yearn

God give me the strength I need
Lift the weight from my path
Stand back as we pray for You
You are the reason we breathe

We break, we fall, and lose our breath
Sit down, your strength, and let it fill your head
Your house may fall but you'll bounce right back
We live and breathe, break up but bring us rest

The fate of the world rests on a prophecy
Then put the blame on yourself
I hope to God we will break this with honesty
You are the reason we bow

God give me the strength I need
Lift the weight from my path
Stand back as we pray for You
You are the reason we breathe

We break, we fall, and lose our breath
Sit down, your strength, and let it fill your head
Your house may fall but you'll bounce right back
We live and breathe, break up but bring us rest [x3]

We break, we fall, and lose our breath
Break and fall
We live and breath, break up but bring rest
Walk alone, we'll never walk alone

Break up but bring rest
