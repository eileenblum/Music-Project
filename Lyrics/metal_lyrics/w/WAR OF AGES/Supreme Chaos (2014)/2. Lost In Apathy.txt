Our favor burns like embers in the wake of fallen men
Why wonât you remember the vision that we had?

We are the face of a generation broken
Have mercy on us we hold the truth on the tips of our tongues
Cover me, you cover me

Iâm living life like Iâm free again
Without a care in the world
Iâm holding zero regrets
Not even God can save me

Come rescue my soul
Donât let me rot in the grave like the rest
Come rescue my soul
God reach down to me

Iâm shedding light on our focus
What I see is the reaction to a nightmare
I said I would stay if you listen
Now youâre gone and now youâre gone

We will fight
We are the voice of a nation
