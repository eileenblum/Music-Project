Why am I afraid of the fall?
Begging to hide every lie drifting further from home.
Now forced to feed from the bottom, I would die to be in your arms
Break free from your idols, break free from your fear
Put to death every concept that we were forced to believe

So shall I be saved from my enemies
The sorrows of death surround me
I cry out for you

Show your true self, laying the path to your grave
I laid the foundation now itâs time to breathe on your own
Forever is the cry of your heart now revealed
Forever every tongue will confess you are God

We are the fallen
