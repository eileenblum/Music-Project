Hold the bottle to your throat before you breakdown
Light pierces though the glass before you give up
Life is simple, living the dream
Holding my cup filled three fingers deep

We are the broken
Here for the moment
We are the broken
Here for the moment

We won't believe you are hopeless
Praying for you with tongues of fire
Look at me when I tell you
You were loved at your first breath

Broken promise starts to spread
Where only thoughts can hurt you
You won't let go until you're dead

You will never escape this
Unless you drop the act as if you wanted it
Life is a blur fearing the fall
The past is one thing I'm not afraid of

We are the broken
Here for the moment
We are the broken
Here for the moment

We won't believe you are hopeless
Praying for you with tongues of fire
Look at me when I tell you
You were loved at your first breath

Broken promise starts to spread
Where only thoughts can hurt you
You won't let go until you're dead

We won't believe you are hopeless
Praying for you with tongues of fire
Look at me when I tell you
You were loved at your first breath

We won't believe you are hopeless
Praying for you with tongues of fire
Look at me when I tell you
You were loved at your first breath
