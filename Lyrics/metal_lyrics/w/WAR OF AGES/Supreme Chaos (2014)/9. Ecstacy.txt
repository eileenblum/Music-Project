The world we crave bleeds perfect blood
We suffer from freedom, in every choice we make
And every wound we seek.
We couldnât wait for perfect love,
Finding what we needed in a blink of an eye
And a turn of the page

I feel like itâs over
Enraged through my dying shame

Burst, we burst through the cycle
The same song played over again
Screaming never again until my heartâs content
Who will save me from myself?
The look on our face reeks of pleasure and pain
Masked in endless shame

I gave her everything, she left me wrecked and on my back
I gave her everything, swallowed in hate that I created
