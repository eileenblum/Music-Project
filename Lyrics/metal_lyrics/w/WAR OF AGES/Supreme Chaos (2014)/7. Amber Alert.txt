When I held you in my arms
I knew you would be a reflection of the man that I am
I will fight for you, I will fight for you
Leading you through the fires of pain
I donât have a choice
I will not compromise

I will face myself, as the reflection in the mirror equals the pain I felt
You will last the dawn when you follow me
I know your heart is strong, but am I ready to accept what youâll become?
Take my lead Iâve been through it all

Take my hand say a prayer and come alive
Become a force to remember as our worlds collide
Thereâs nothing to fear
Nothing to be afraid of

Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil for thou art with me
