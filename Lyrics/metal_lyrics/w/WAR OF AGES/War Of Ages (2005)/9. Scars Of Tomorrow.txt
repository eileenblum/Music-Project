There's no one left with the strength to save the world from itself
Join in the fight
Your hands will bear the scars of life
Grab your weapons and rise
I'd give anything for one more chance to fight for the truth
I held so close now I'll never see the light of day
Is there anyone left to bear the scars
We're prepared to die for you
Here I am I will fight
Don't count me lost
We will live forever more
We release our pride
I will die for this
I will hold my ground
So bury me
Dead and gone
