Put my life back on its course and remove all doubt from my soul
You've left me here with false hope and now you sit back
And you watch me die tear me down with my undying breath
I risk everything obey the truth in this I trust in you stripped from shame
Without him all is lost reclaim my soul bring me new life
I'm not alone, free my soul here's my heart with this life I hold
You in condemned for all to unveil what you've become and
How you brought me down bow your head
