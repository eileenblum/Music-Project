We lie awake in our battlefields
One chance to prove ourselves
We will prevail
Our will to live is powerful and our strength will never fade away
To the weak who try to stop us
You don't have the strength
So save your breath
Stand your ground when our hate has been concealed
I'll carry it to the grave now that fate is revealed
My eyes begin to close
If we close our eyes and keep to ourselves in hope that everything will fade
away
We'll live in shame and wonder to ourselves if there will ever be a second
chance
With strength we'll never fall apart and in time we'll prove ourselves
My heart can't be broken for I'll never live in shame
With every breath and all that I am I'll make a stand
Until the end stand your ground
