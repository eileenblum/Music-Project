am broken before you don't turn away in fear of what I've become
Give me a chance to prove to you that I've changed
And no one can break me hear us we've been given a second chance
No one can stop us
Stand true until the end
Never fall
No one can stop us
Don't shelter us
You never gave us a chance to bring in the weak
And put the world to the test
Don't judge our worth on account of the way the others carry themselves
Now take hold of the truth you buried inside
Set yourself free
I am broken before you don't turn away in fear of what I've become
Give me a chance to prove to you that I've changed
No one can break me
Hear us we've been given a second chance
No one can stop us
Stand true until the end
Never fall
No one can stop us now
