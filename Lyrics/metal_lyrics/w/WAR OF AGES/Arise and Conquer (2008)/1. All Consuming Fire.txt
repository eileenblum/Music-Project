All consuming fire burn.

Lord ignite the rage.
Flowing through me.
Hear your spoken words.
Consume me oh Lord.

Release my selfishness.
We hold this unto you.
We battle through our days of irony.
Close your eyes.
Yet we never felt an ounce of pain.
Until now.

All consuming fire burn.

Straight to the heart God give me strength.
River of life flow through my veins.

I exalt your name.
Hold on to me. I'll never let go.
Consume me Lord.

All consuming fire burn.
