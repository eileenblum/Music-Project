Eyes blind to the death of the church, a fabrication of truth.
Burn the banner you call love and open your eyes.

You've awakened the warriors, march for we are the elite.
Our altars are stained with blood.

Here we are in the fight of our lives, why won't you listen, we bring
the angel of death.

God I'm on my knees, suffering, is this all I am.
Please fill my pain, lift me up and hold me close to your heart.
How could I fail you once again, your love is what sustains me.

Here lies another empty tomb is what you preach.
Fear the very thing you created, yet you're still blind.
Death to those who bear the mark, life to those who choose to fight.

As we gather in your presence.

God I'm on my knees, suffering, is this all I am.
Please fill my pain, lift me up and hold me close to your heart.
How could I fail you once again, your love is what sustains me.
