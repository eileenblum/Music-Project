[Originally by Ke$ha]Wake up in the morning feelingâ like PâDiddy, 
grab my glasses Iâm out the door Iâm bout to hit this city, 
before I leave brush my teeth with a bottle of jack, 
cause when I leave for the night I ainât coming back, 
Iâm talking pedicure on our toes, trying on all our clothes, 
âsceniesâ blowing up our phones, 
drop toppingâ playing our favorite CDs pulling up to the parties, 
trying to get a little bit tipsy

Donât stop make it pop, 
DJ blow my speakers up 
tonight Iâm fight till we see the sunlight, 
tik tok on the clock, 
the party donât stop no

Ainât got a care in the world but got plenty of beer, 
ainât got no money in my pocket but Iâm already here, 
now the girls are lining up because they hear we got swagger, 
but we kick emâ to the curb âbecauseâ they look like McJagger

Iâm talking bout, 
everybody getting crunk, 
girls trying to touch my junk, 
everybody getting drunk 
and we go until they kick us out, 
or the police shut us down, 
police shut us down, 
Po Po shut us down

[Chorus]

You build me up you break me down, 
my heart it pounds yeah you got me, 
with my hands up you got me now, 
you got that sound, yeah you got me

Now the party donât start till we walk in, 
âYou canât handle us, cause weâre so fucking scandalous, 
no one ever planned for us, Woe, Is Me 
get down with us, ATL, raise some hell yo!â

[Chorus]
