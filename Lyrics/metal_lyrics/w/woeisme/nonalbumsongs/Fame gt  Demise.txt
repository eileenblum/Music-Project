The devil and god are knocking at my door
I thought I had your word 
That a father dies before his son
Now the reaper and his men are marching away 
Straight to hell

All that you taught me to be 
Was a moper, a dreamer that only refused to dream
Oh save it please 
My voice is peaking through your speakers 
And Iâm speaking just to show you the way
How could you 
Shelter me out
Iâm much older now 
Youâre a chemical fiend 
You shatter like a beaker 
When I only want to show you the way

The architect, the creator 
Iâll build my way out of your demise 
These dreams are my castles,
Not the walls you built up around me

Oh when I look at my watch and I know 
Time is gold 
It canât be pawned and it canât be sold 
Now youâre running out of time, 
Better relapse and rewind 
Crucify your addiction so you can cross this line
Nothing can save you from the fate that awaits you

Disregard the signals 
Disregard the smoke 
Father donât believe them 
Just let them fucking choke

Now we lay you down to sleep 
I pray his hands, your soul to reap 
And if I die before you wake 
Then Iâve lost a bet, and for fucks sake, 
When all your cards are on the table
Pray the floor is still and stable and dance your life away

Your true colors are starting to get loud 
(so loud that it hurts my ears)
Have fun praying to your gray god now
Yeah, this war donât determine whoâs right 
This war just determines whoâs left standing tonight 
Stop handing me lights 
I can see what you are in the dark just fine 
Iâm not blind, Iâm bending the blinds 
Peaking through to get a glimpse of your anguishing life 
Youâre hiding like a vampire, here comes the strife 
This wonât hurt me cause I get a thrill from the bite

So place your bets
Place your bets
Cause through my eyes youâll reap what you sew
