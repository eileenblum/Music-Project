It's 3 AM and I can't sleep at all
I'm wide awake instead, so many thoughts have found their way into my head
I ask myself what it is that's making me feel uneasy
Why do I feel like this?
I shouldn't be feeling like this

Cause I am trying, I know you're lying when you say things are fine
But we both knew what we were getting into, this happens every time

These restless nights and hollow days
You feel no need to change your ways
And all this time, I failed to see
The things that I had hoped for were never meant to be

So what's it gonna take for us to figure all this out?
Cause I've only got two weeks left here and right now my head is filled with doubt
Don't take this time for granted, cause when I'm gone you'll wish you hadn't
And appreciate this for what it is, cause pretty soon you're not gonna have it

Cause I am trying, I know you're lying when you say things are fine
But we both knew what we were getting into, this happens every time

These restless nights and hollow days
You feel no need to change your ways
And all this time, I failed to see
The things that I had hoped for were never meant to be

You never know what you have until you lose it
If this is what you really want, then now's your time to prove it, this is your time to prove it
And all I wanna know is where did we go wrong
Cause I'm sick to death of losing sleep and I'm sick of writing sad songs

These restless nights and hollow days
You feel no need to change your ways
And all this time, I failed to see
The things that I had hoped for were never meant to be
