This is the beginning - of a new lease on life
This freedom,- this passion is how we survive
Only got one life - one chance
to show what I got - and nothing will ever
take this from me
You can never take this from me

Whatever happened to just - wanting to live your dream,
when no one cared about - the cover of a magazine
This is the price I pay - for the life I've made,
but I'm always finding a way to - Stand up,
can't you hear the - sound of - a thousand screaming voices,
eager to watch you succeed - Give them something real to believe

You'll try everything - to sell your soul for a quick buck,
so look at it this way
Tried to control my life - but I've got something to say
Your words, they make me sick,
mind-blown by all the constant bullshit
Go back to your pathetic life - and let me be

Whatever happened to - just wanting to live your dream,
when no one cared about - the cover of a magazine
This is the price I pay - for the life I've made,
but I'm always finding a way to - Stand up,
can't you hear the - sound of - a thousand screaming voices,
eager to watch you succeed
Give them something - real to believe

This is a song for the times I've failed
This is a song for the times I got it right
Maybe I'm just a boy - with a dream,
but my dreams are becoming a reality
This is a song for the times you've failed
This is a song for the times you got it right
Maybe you're just someone with a dream,
but your dreams are so close you just have to believe it

Stand up, can't you hear the sound, - of a thousand screaming voices

Whatever happened to - just wanting to live your dream,
when no one cared about - the cover of a magazine
This is the price I pay - for the life I've made,
but I'm always finding a way to - Stand up,
can't you hear the - sound of - a thousand screaming voices,
eager to watch you succeed
Give them something - real to believe
