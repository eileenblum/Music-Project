For the first time in a long time, all my thoughts are making sense
But you tell me that I'm crazy for all the time I've spent
Just piecing this together, while you're begging for attention
Accusing me of giving up, when that was never my intention

But I guess you'll never understand
Cause you always think you've got the upper hand

Before you go, I hope you know
You're turning into the person that you hate the most
Don't tell me I'm to blame
Cause you brought out the worst in me, why did it take so long to see
That I'm just fine without you, fine without you

So tell me, tell me who you're trying to impress
Cause once again your plans fell through, and I'm stuck here cleaning up your mess
You tell me I'm not being fair, I'm not being fair
Why don't you save all that for somebody who cares

And I know you'll never understand
There's no way in hell that we can just be friends

Before you go, I hope you know
You're turning into the person that you hate the most
Don't tell me I'm to blame
Cause you brought out the worst in me, why did it take so long to see
That I'm just fine without you, fine without you

I'm strong enough to say this now, you've got your head stuck in the clouds
And sooner or later, this world will chew you up and spit you out

Before you go, I hope you know
You're turning into the person that you hate the most
Don't tell me I'm to blame
Cause you brought out the worst in me, why did it take so long to see
That I'm just fine without you, fine without you
