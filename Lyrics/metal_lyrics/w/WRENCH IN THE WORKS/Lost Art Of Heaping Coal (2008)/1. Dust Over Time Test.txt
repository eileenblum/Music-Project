Running from every wicked little town is gonna run you down
To blame is to wear your heart on your sleeve What a wicked way our hearts deceive
Trying not to be the lost take
Of your everyday existence
The further that we dig, the shallower we become
The harder that we judge, the harder it is to budge
The splinters in the whites of our own eyes
Help me to find a place where love is not some half illusion
Dreams do not come to those who choose to see nightmares
Sometimes you get so used to screaming without making a sound
Believing the illusions of grandeur as friendly as they may seem
What a pretty world, what a pretty world of make believe
The wicked way our hearts deceive
Our hearts deceive
The further that we dig, the shallower we become
The harder that we judge, the harder it is to budge
The splinters in the whites of our own eyes
Pride's insistence, failure's persistence
