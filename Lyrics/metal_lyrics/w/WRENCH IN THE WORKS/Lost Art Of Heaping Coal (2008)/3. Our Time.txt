This time we've got to make things right
This time we've got to stand and fight for our time
Our time
We've built our homes, amongst the scattered shadows
We drink alone, although the cup has been offered
Our fears are met by our expectations
And I refuse to feed my fears tomorrow
We can't wait one more day
Our final hour has been selected
And every second somehow connected
This time we've got to make things right
This time we've got to stand and fight for our time
Our time
Build a fire inside your heart
Build a fire inside your heart this time
