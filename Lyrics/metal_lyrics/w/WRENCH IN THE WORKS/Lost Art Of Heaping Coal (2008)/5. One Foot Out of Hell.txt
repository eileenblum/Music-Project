A statue and a shell the angels wish us well
But praises don't come from sandy throats
With one foot in, and one foot out of hell
Another empty day, another wasted night
We've gotta hope for something more this time
Another empty day, another wasted night
We've gotta hope for something more this time
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
More love, more power
More of you in my life
More of you
Less of me
Another empty day, another wasted night
We've gotta hope for something more this time
Another empty day, another wasted night
We've gotta hope for something more this time
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
With one foot out of hell
A gift unnoticed
