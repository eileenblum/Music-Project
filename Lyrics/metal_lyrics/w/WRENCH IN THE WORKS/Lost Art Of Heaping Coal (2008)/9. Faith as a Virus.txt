A word of fire stands burning in your heart
As truth fans the flames
What's your heart's desire,
Will it always be the same
Or fall to the winds of change
Our foundations crumble
And are rebuilt again
But there is one that will remain
Faith is the dirtiest F word
That the world has ever heard
Faith is a virus that feeds on the ego
That feeds on me
Hope is the cure for my selfish design
'Cause faith is the dirtiest F word
That the world has ever heard
Faith is a virus that feeds on the ego
That feeds on me
Hope is the cure for my selfish design
A word of fire stands burning in your heart
As truth fans the flames
What's your heart's desire,
Will it always be the same
Or fall to the winds of change
Our foundations crumble
And are rebuilt again
But there is one that will remain
He calmed the waters
Rebuked the storms
That's got to stand
Stand for something more
That's why we stand for something more
