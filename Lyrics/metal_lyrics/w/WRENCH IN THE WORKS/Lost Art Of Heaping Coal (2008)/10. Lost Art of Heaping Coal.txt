We may never find true love
Because we're always leaving,
We're chasing something
And we may never be secure
Because we've left our jobs,
We've closed so many doors
When blood is needed nothing else will do
Where serpents strangle love-sick bones
Spirit allow us too
Spit fire
Heap coals
Revival is the time of fire
Spark a fire in the world
Bless a child tonight
Shine light in the darkest cities' life
Set ablaze the eyes on the blind man
Heap coals, shine bright
The angels weep tonight
We may never find true love
Because we're always leaving,
We're chasing something
But we would trade all this and more
For what the locusts devour we know you can restore
