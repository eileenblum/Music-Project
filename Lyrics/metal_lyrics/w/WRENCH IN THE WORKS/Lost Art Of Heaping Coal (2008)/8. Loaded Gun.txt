Such a lifeless way of existence
Oh what a lifeless way of existence
Toiling to serve what is sold
Striving for an image the media has sold
Such a lifeless way of existence
Oh what a lifeless way of existence
We buy because we are told
Deny the true selves that we hold
But I wanna be stolen
Waiting for the thief in the night
Light is the only answer
My only truth in darkness night
Sunbeam fresh water
Thirst meets its maker
Blessed be
For the taker
This debt has been paid
For the taker
This debt has been paid
For your debt has been paid
Let it be proclaimed wherever there is sound
But I wanna be stolen
Waiting for the thief in the night
Light is the only answer
My only truth in darkness night
Sunbeam fresh water
Thirst meets its maker
Blessed be. For the taker
This debt has been paid
For the taker
This debt has been paid
For your debt has been paid
Let it be proclaimed wherever there is sound
To follow you is a loaded gun to my head
To follow you is a loaded gun
My love/my lord
