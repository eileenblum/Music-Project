Call me out of the darkness and into the light
I am not of my own
I've become spiritually cold
Your grace wipes away my tears
With your strength I can vanquish all my fears
Some crowns of sorrow sit on a little world for a little hour
Take me
Drain me
Purify
Make me clean
Your crown will shine forever
And your grace abides forever
Our souls will shine forever
We can all live forever
