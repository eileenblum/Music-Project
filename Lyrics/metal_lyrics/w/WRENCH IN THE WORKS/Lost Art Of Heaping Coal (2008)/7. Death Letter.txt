An alarm waking me
The leaves dying off the trees
I medicate with whiskey to drown the fear of being me
Three A.M. I'm on a bridge
Gravity pulling my will to live
A saddened moon softly lights the scene. And reflects a ghost from the water to me
I don't want to live my life today
I'd rather burn out than just fade away
I don't want to live my life today
I'd rather burn out than just fade away
So as we live our lives, this song will be our suicide
And as we fight through life, this song will be our suicide
So as we live our lives, this song will be our suicide
And as we fight through life, this song will be our suicide
Death letter
An alarm waking me
The leaves dying off the trees
I medicate with whiskey to drown the fear of being me
Three A.M. I'm on a bridge
Gravity pulling my will to live
A saddened moon softly lights the scene
And reflects a ghost from the water to me
I don't want to live my life today
I'd rather burn out than just fade away
I don't want to live my life today
I'd rather burn out than just fade away
So as we live our lives, this song will be our suicide
And as we fight through life, this song will be our suicide
I can bleed through every note, with every word blood from my throat
In the end all is still, a fallen man who's lost his will
But this is just a song, as for life we must drive on
Music is a gift, it will lift the burdened soul
Life is a gift, a gift which we must fight to hold
Hold on, hold on
