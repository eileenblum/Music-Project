This time I won't hold on so tight
I will die first, I surrender
So that I may truly live
When you take me down I will rise
When you take me down I will rise
Disillusioned with the gentle path
Away from brightness and out into your nothingness, this nothingness
String me up and beat me down
When you take me down I will rise
When you take me down I will rise
Brokenness
