Why do you climb the walls at night? Because you've fallen from the light. You've fallen from the light. And every minute of every hour. Plotting our attack. Our attack. Your hate will be replaced by fear. Fear of failure, fear of death. Fear of shadows, fear for your last breath. Why do you climb the walls at night? Because you've fallen from the light. You've fallen from the light. And every minute of every hour. Plotting our attack. Our attack. And so this means war. Tonight, tonight is war. Tonight is war.
