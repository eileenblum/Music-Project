[feat. guest vocals by Levi The Poet]Preparing the way preaching repentance. The voice of one calling in the desert.

We are all just a brood of vipers whoâve been warned of the axe at the root of the tree.
We are all just a brood of vipers whoâve been warned of the axe...

Out of these stones will rise a generation.
Afflicted, abandoned, despised, refined by desperation.
Declaring the Word became flesh. Witness to mankindâs salvation...

"Suffer it to be so now"
I am not the Messiah, Elijah, a prophet â just a voice calling in the wilderness.
Purging, burning, baptized with fire. And the chaff will be burned.

"Suffer it to be so now" to fulfill all righteousness.
The time will come when the grain is tossed into the wind.

Just like him you can spend your last days in shackles,
questioning if your faith was in vain or truth.

We are all just a brood of vipers whoâve been warned of the axe at the root of the tree.
We are all just a brood of vipers whoâve been warned of the axe...
