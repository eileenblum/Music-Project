This is not your world. (Go...)

Unblindfold the truth. Donât forget to bleed â donât forget to breathe.
Hereâs one for the road. Blessed Are The Steadfast.

Grace will tear down the walls that mock your dreams.
It will work out fine â this is not your world. Youâre not the holder of time.
Blessed is your trial. Blessed Are The Steadfast.

Strengthen your heart â be set free. Let their world fall â fall apart.
Grace will tear down the walls that mock your dreams. This is not your world. Stop...
