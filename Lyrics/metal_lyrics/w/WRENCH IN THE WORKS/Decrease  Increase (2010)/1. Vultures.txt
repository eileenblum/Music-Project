The harvest of the earth is ripe and the sickle will swing.
Theyâll sell you freedom at the cost of your dignity.
Sugar-coated consequences.
Bar code scans and barb wired fences.
Prescriptions filled with pestilence.

No man knows the hour, the hour or time... (break)

Control is a cancer they will give. Devastation is our cultureâs creed.
As if the whole world had the same American dream,
or at least thatâs how our media would make it seem.

No man knows the hour, the hour or time.

What will come from the blind leading the blind?
Millions caught and stabled, stamped with a three.
One for the dragon, one for the beast, and another for the false prophet.
And those who refuse will be executed, deceased...

Where there are bodies there the vultures will feed.
Where there are bodies there the vultures will feed.
Where there are bodies there the vultures will feed.
