Living a life in the lost has been killing you.
This deception you give chase is a dream you will never run down.
Dreams fell from your hands like the dust of a desert season.
My heart asks for you. These eyes see your pain.

Disappointment is the daily grind. One more fix, another failure, one more time.
Life is full of seasons â and all seasons must come to an end.
The lights in your eyes grow dim. This salt will never fill... the holes in your soul.

Sanctification is the death that every saint must live through.
A trial by fire burning from the inside out with Truth.
Hope fail and struggle still breaking your will against the will of God.
My heart asks for you. These eyes see your pain. My soul believes itâs true.

Playing mistakes of pleasure and pain. Grieve the spirit, the Blood cleanses in the end.
The lights in your eyes grow dim. This salt will never fill... the holes in your soul.

Memories like a wrong...a wrong number in a long line of dead men.
These ruined years, this wasted mind.
Your life and glory are worth more than you choose to know.
Humbled under the weight of a mighty hand, to be lifted up in due time truly stand.

That face used to have such zeal. My heart asks for you.
These eyes see your pain. My soul believes itâs true.
