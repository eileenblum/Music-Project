[feat. guest vocals by Chris Grosso of From Bindu To Ojas]The face of war has never looked so young. Armies of enslaved daughters and sons.
Denied existence so the world may never know. Tiny foot soldiers of the dope machine.
Underground evil regimes, mistreating children, creating killers.

Machine gun clad merchants of death. Machine gun clad merchants of death.
These are innocents in our Fatherâs eyes. We must put and end to their battle cries.
He has heard their prayers, this is genocide.

Tiny foot soldiers. Give them a chance, give them a choice.
Give back their lives, give them a voice.
Not another one stolen or bought for a fee. Not another kid saying: "My gun was as tall as me."
