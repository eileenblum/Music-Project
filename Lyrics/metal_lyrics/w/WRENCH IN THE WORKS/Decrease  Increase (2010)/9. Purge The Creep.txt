We are no more than dry bones, lifeless and in need of breath.
There is none righteous â no, not even one.

I wonât stop reaching. I will keep seeking the Truth.
With more faith than reasons to give up.
I might be wretched, but I wonât stop reaching.
When my questions and prayers are unanswered, I will keep seeking.

Nothing short of my lips sown shut should keep me from speaking of Your love.
Burn away my flesh, so that my spirit may glow.
Carve away this clay, for a new vessel to be thrown.

Not looking for another deity image novelty.
And I have no need for one more rock n roll casualty.

I wonât stop reaching. I will keep seeking the Truth.
Quicken me for today â an example of Your integrity.
I wonât stop reaching.
Quicken me for today â an example of Your majesty.
I will keep seeking the Truth.
Quicken me for today â Your majesty.
