[feat. guest vocals by Donny Hardy of I Am Alpha And Omega]Pleading among the twisted trees:
"Father, please take this cup from me... But not of my own, but Your will be done."

A ready heart broken by grief. All the prayers in the world wonât save Him now.
Knees to the dirt, blood on the brow...

Piercing the paw of a lion, crushing the head of the snake.
The curtain was torn top to bottom. The heavens and history shake.
The Anointed broken to redeem the fall of creation...

The execution of an innocent man. Politicians wash the guilt from their hands...
"But not of my own, but Your will be done." They sent to die, Your only begotten Son.

Knees to the dirt, blood on the brow...

There can be no redemption without the shedding of blood.
There can be no redemption without the shedding of blood.
There can be no redemption without the shedding of blood.
