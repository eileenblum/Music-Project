You made me see right past myself
well beyond my fears
Realized I'm synchronized
far beyond my years
I'm so geared into them
I serve unto their souls
Now that I'm addicted
my hunger only grows

I'm a Child of the Damned
I follow where I go
Rigging to the cross
as holy as a whore!
I'm just a child of the damned

Witches' coven the time is come
for those sabbatical years
Revelation is the message
for all in all to hear
Prophets slayed mankind arrayed
into a mass submission
Evil's here and the lord of hell
gives you the proposition!

I'm a Child of the Damned
I follow where I go
Rigging to the cross
as holy as a whore!
I'm just a child of the damned

Give away your life's goals
your meaning and ambition
It means nothing to you
after all it's superstition!
Do not be afraid
the world is near the end
Is it better to rule in hell,
than it is to serve in heaven?

I'm a Child of the Damned
I follow where I go
rigging to the cross
as holy as a whore!
I'm just a child of the damned
