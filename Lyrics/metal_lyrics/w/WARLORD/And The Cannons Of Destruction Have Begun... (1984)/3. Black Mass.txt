on the eve of tribulation
before the morrow's wrath
it was then then that the covens gathered
for the final black mass!
the moon it was full
and the time had come for us all
the sun it was gone
and the people awaited their call
the devil was there
with the fire burning in the air
the demons they danced
and drank from the chalice they shared
nobody cared!

now the evil of man
had passed by the act of lucifer's kiss
and the evil broke loose
from the tombs of hell's fiery abyss
the devil was there
with the fire burning in the air
the demons they danced
and drank from the chalice they shared

now the prince knelt down
for communion of the time that he fast
and the father he blessed
his child with the blood of the black mass!
black mass!
