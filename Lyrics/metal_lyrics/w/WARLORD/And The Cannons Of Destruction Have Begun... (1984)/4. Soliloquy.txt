I feel the pain inside my heart
like a knife it tears me apart
My tears they shed I have no one
God, please tell me what i have done

I have no friends, no one who cares
nobody with love they can share
They laugh at me! I don't know why!
I lock the door and i cry!

I see myself I am a man
just like you and all of your friends
My heart so warm shattered like glass
don't know how much longer I can last

I have no friends, no one who cares
nobody with love they can share
They laugh at me! I don't know why!
I lock the door and I cry!

Alone again! I'm . . . alone again!
Alone again! I'm . . . alone again!
Well that's how it will be 'til the end.

So when I die no one will care
I ask you do you think that it's fair?
Soliloquy! Well that's my plea
Won't someone please believe in me?

I have no friends, no one who cares
nobody with love they can share
They laugh at me! i don't know why!
I lock the door and i cry!

Alone again! I'm . . . alone again!
Alone again! I'm . . . alone again!
Well that's how it will be 'til the end.
