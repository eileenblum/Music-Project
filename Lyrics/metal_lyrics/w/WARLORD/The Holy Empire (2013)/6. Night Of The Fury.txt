Soaring through heavens with fire and steel
The Predator spies out for enemy kill
âTis the night of the Fury, the nationâs at war
With Spirit and Nighthawk, a thunderous roar

And where does the terrorist flee?
Are his caves and his compounds free?
For the Night of the Fury brings Death and Hell

The Night of the Fury comes out of the void
With Hellfire missiles, the Falconâs deployed
Thereâs no sign of worry, thereâs quiet and still
Then out of the heavens comes lightning to kill

And where does the terrorist flee?
Are his caves and his compounds free?
For the Night of the Fury brings Death and Hell

A nation at war, then what must we do?
If war is for killing, then killing we do
Yes war is but cruelty and funeral bells
Destroyers we are, we send them to Hell

The Night of the Fury in darkness of light
The AC-130, a blistering strike
The Night of the Fury is the ultimate fear
For Jihadi commanders, spear after spear

And where does the terrorist flee?
Are his caves and his compounds free?
For the Night of the Fury brings Death and Hell
