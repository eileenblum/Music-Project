Insurgents have taken the city
Civilians have moved out of town
A city besieged, the death that will be
For men will be killed and be downed
For men will be killed and be downed

The skies are loaded with cannons
And Iâve been thrust into the throes
I smash and destroy the houses of those
And now I have entered the Kill Zone
And now I have entered the Zone

Soldiery is my life!
Strategy? Live or die!

Itâs Killing Time
Killing Time
Killing Time
Itâs Killing Time

The war it just rages for ages
The stench of the dead that I loathe
I feed my machine guns and I roar
Pouring out lead from the Zone
Pouring out lead from the Zone

Savagery is my life!
Butchery or I die!

The final assault on Fallujah
A mission to search and destroy
The foreign jihad has come here to fight
For Allah and Prophet theyâll die
For Allah and Prophet theyâll die

Explosives and Suicide Bombers
I storm through their hideouts unknown
I blow out their brains and scatter the floor
Shredding their flesh and their bones
Shredding their flesh and their bones

Slaughtering, I want more!
Annihilating, I am War!
