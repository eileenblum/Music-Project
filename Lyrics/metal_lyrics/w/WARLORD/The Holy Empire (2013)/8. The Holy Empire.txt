In the life that we live there is hardship and sorrow
The pain that we share is but one and the same
We fight to survive in a world that is hollow
But where do we go from here?
Yes where do we go from here?

In the life that we live is there hope for the morrow?
The stain of our sins, they have blackened our name
What will it be, should we beg, should we borrow?
The keys of the kingdom to be,
Yes the keys of the kingdom to be

By force and by chain, the world is enslaving
The source of our pain is the evil of man
There is no escape from the woes of this sorrow
So where do we go from here?

To âThe Holy Empireâ kingdoms fall
For âThe Holy Empireâ conquers all
When âThe Holy Empireâ dawns
We will live in peace with man and God

To âThe Holy Empireâ mankind falls
For âThe Holy Empireâ conquers all
When âThe Holy Empireâ dawns
We will live in peace with man and God
