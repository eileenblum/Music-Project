In the fields of the flesh there was battle
When the Sword of the Lord came to take me back
My spirit burned with fire, my eyes were full of tears

The Lord moved with power
He came to find me when I was lost
He took my sins to a mountain and he nailed them to a cross

In the years of my youth there was battle
When the legions of Hell led the main attack
My life was full of horror, my mind was full of fear

The Sword slew with power
The legions lay on the battle field
He lifted me from the mire and he clothed me with His shield

70.000 Sorrows, 70.000 tears
70.000 sufferings written across my years
70.000 Sorrows, 70.000 strays
70.000 epitaphs written across my face

70.000 Sorrows, 70.000 tears
70.000 sufferings written across my years
70.000 Sorrows, 70.000 strays
70.000 epitaphs written across my face

70.000 Sorrows, 70.000 tears
70.000 sufferings written across my years
70.000 Sorrows, 70.000 strays
70.000 epitaphs written across my face
