When I was young, I cast aside the shadows of my youth
And I lifted up my eyes to the skies
I spread my wings, I sailed the seven seas
For Glory and all that it seemed

And through my love, I passed inside the hallows of my heart
And I lifted up my cries to the heights
But no one cared, no one even dared
And Glory evaded my dreams

Now I tell you this tale, this story
When I set my own sails for my dreams
In the Author of Life I found Glory
And the honor and power of my King

Now in my age, Iâve looked beyond horizons of the past
And I realized that fame was but a thing
I wrote my score, I wanted even more
And Glory said âNoâ to my theme

Now I tell you this tale, this story
When I set my own sails for my dreams
In the Author of Life I found Glory
And the honor and power of my King

Now I tell you this tale, this story
When I set my own sails for my dreams
In the Author of Life I found Glory
And the honor and power of my King
And the honor and power of my King
