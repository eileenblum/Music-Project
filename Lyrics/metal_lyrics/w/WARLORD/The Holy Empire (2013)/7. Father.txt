Father, all I can be is a man
And all I can ask of you Father, my Father
How can I be in your plan?

Send me a sign from the heavens
In riddle or rhyme
Descend from the skies of forever
Pray give me a time
For I have reached the end of the line

Defender of truth and of freedom
Am I living a lie?
I render my fruits to thy kingdom
Pray give me a sign
For I am weak, how long can I fight?

Father, when I can see you again?
And when can I be with you Father?
You gave up your life for me then, and when I needed you,
Father, when can I see you again?
And when can I be with you Father?
You gave up your life for me then, and when I needed a friend.

Father, your Spirit I am longing to bring
In tears can I ask of you Father, my Father
To play your song through my strings?
