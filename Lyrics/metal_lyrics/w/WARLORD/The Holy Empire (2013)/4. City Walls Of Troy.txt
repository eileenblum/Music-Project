In the night I hear the sound
The City Walls of Troy are falling down
In the night I see its doom
The City Walls of Troy have become ruin

In the night I see the horse
Odysseus has won his final war
In the night I hear the lie
Odysseus has fooled them by surprise

Oh, great city walls, ruins of man
Oh, City Walls of Troy, the burning land

In the night I see the land
The City Walls of Troy no longer stand
In the night I hear them say
The City Walls of Troy have died today
