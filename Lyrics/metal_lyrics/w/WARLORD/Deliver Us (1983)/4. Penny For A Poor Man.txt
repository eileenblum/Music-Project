He was once a younger man, just like you and I
But times have changed for this old man, the story makes you cry

Now the nights are getting colder, can you lift a hand
Soon to die, I'm growing older, help me if you can

Just a Penny for a Poor Man
A poor man, yes I am . . .
Just a Penny for a Poor Man

An honest man with a heart of gold, stricken by his luck
All alone, not a single friend, and no one to love

If you had no food or shelter, just a place to stand
Would you ask for some assistance, would you need a hand?

Just a Penny for a Poor Man
A poor man, yes I am . . .
Just a Penny for a Poor Man

Will he live until tomorrow, or will he die today?
Can you feel the grief and sorrow that this song portrays?

Now you say you are a rich man, well show us what you have!
If your heart holds any riches, lend a helping hand . . .

Just a Penny for a Poor Man
A poor man, yes I am . . .
Just a Penny for a Poor Man
Just a Penny for a Poor Man
A poor man, yes I am . . .
Just a Penny for a Poor Man
