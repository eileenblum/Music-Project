The morning woke, the day was breakin' . . . she left me far behind
She was gone, I couldn't take it . . . no more tears to cry.

We gathered 'round her place of resting, for the last goodbye
She lay in white like a dream unending, the saddened clouds they cried . . .

Tears for all the joy we had
Tears for all the pain
All the years I have to live
These Winter Tears, I'll cry for you until we meet again

You gave me life, you gave me lovin'
Showed me what love could bring
And every night when I think about you
I begin to sing . . .

Tears for all the joy we had
Tears for all the pain
All the years I have to live
These Winter Tears, I'll cry for you until we meet again

Tears for all the joy we had
Tears for all the pain
These Winter Tears I have inside
Will always cry your name.
The years I have to live . . .
These Winter Tears, I'll cry for you until we meet again
