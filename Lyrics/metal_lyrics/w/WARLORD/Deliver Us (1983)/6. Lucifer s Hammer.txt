It comes through the heavens, on a mission from hell
A force of destruction, that nothing can repel
A story is born that no one will live to tell

The obliteration of man, now encased in its shell
At the push of a button, we all will go to hell
Who will be left to toll the funeral bell . . .

The Hammer will Fall on you!
The Hammer will Fall on you!

Devastation, destruction of all the nations
Annihilation, clouding of all the skies
Raise the dead from their graves, and throw in yourselves and hide

Save us - from ourselves
Save us - from ourselves
Save us - from ourselves
Save us - from ourselves
Save us . . .
