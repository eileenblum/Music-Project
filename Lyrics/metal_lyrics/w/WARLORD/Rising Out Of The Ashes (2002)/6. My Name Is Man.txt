My name is Man, from dust I stand,
A newborn song, a story.
Upon this land, Almighty hands,
Hath filled my eyes with glory.
The life I breathe, a Force unseen,
Reveals all that I am . . .
My Name is Man, My Name is Man, My name is Man . . .

Behold the crystal rivers feed the oceans
Celestial sphere of solar fire drinketh from the sea
And the fountains in the sky pour life on every seed.

Behold the womb of earth brings forth the mountains
The canyon walls so grand they stand, before the valley floor,
And the face of land and sea, they meet on seven shores

We are earth, we are heaven
We are flesh, we are blood
We inherit Thy kingdom
We are all, we are One . . .

We are earth, we are heaven
We are flesh, we are blood
We inherit Thy kingdom
We are all, we are One . . .
