We descend from the belt of Orion
Our life-giving star has come to an end
Civilization is dying
We deem to survive, we search for a land
And we've explored the galaxies
There is just one place we can live and breathe
So we will overthrow the race of man
His way of woe and hate command

We are Invaders from afar, a dying star
Arise and see, the earth in ashes . . .

We sail through the system Solaris
With thousands of ships in the speed of the light
Hail to our leader we cherish
Our weapons of war prepared for the fight
And we are far beyond his years
Man is just nothing but a beast, atomic spears
So we will make this earth our home, our sphere
This is our destiny so near

Through solemn war, our race it must survive
Yet with remorse, the race of man must die
Through laser forces, with humans we collide
There is no hope for mankind to survive.

We are Invaders from afar, a dying star
Arise and see, the earth in ashes . . .
We are Invaders from afar, a dying star
Arise and see, the earth in ashes . . .
