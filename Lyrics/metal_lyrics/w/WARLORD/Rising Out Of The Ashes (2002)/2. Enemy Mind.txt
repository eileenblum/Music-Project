Life, I know it so well
It's sorrow and tears and death
An abode of hell
My living hell . . .
Tomorrow I fear my breath
Will forever fail

Life, a moment in time
The years of a man they vanish
Into shades of night
The shades of night . . .
I fear my soul will be banished
To the realm of sighs

And who will descend to show me the light?
And who will remember me in my plight?

The sins of the soul will rise
The alien lie is in you
Forever you will fight
The Enemy Mind within you
Lie . . . in the fields where carrion dine

We are the Enemy Mind
We are thee, Enemy Mind
We are thee, Enemy . . . MIND!
