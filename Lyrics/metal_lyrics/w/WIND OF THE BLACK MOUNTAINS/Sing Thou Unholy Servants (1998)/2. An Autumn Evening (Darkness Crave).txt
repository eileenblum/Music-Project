I see around me, the sunset so grey
Stretching their shadows, so far away
Beneath the cemetary, my footsteps tread
Lie low and alone, the silent dead
Beneath the ground, beneath the mould
Forever dark, forever cold, demons rape
Immortal souls
As they laugh, the night is born
Strike down christ, with mournless blows

An autumn evening, darkness shall crave
An autumn evening, Satan has slain christ

I dream of those who are no more
Sweet darkness, are you there soul
Demons of hell, I see you again
As hanging children's arms, weep in pain
In the fiery fields, place my blackened soul
In his narrow cell, forever reign
And shed a tear of blood upon my coffin
From each fallen drop brings me my

Darkest autumn!
My darkest fuckin autumn
