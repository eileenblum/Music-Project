[Bathory cover]

Crusted blood on altar black
The rite of dark is done
The semen burn in sacred flames
The witches sing their song

The night is filled with joyous laughters
Orgy of the damned
Prepare for sacrifice by death
On my command

Infernal eternal
With the power in our veins
The rite of darkness

Candles glow with strength and glory
Blind the eye of sun
Demons rings the sabbath bell
The rite of dark is done

Naked bodies form the circle
Flesh and lust collide
Warm blood float and torrent faster
The wounds stand open wide

Sorcery blasphemy
Recite the words of spell
The rite of darkness
Deeds of Hell
