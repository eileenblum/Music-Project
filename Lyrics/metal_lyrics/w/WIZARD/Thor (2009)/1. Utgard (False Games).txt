[Thor:]
"This cat I will lift up from the ground
Is there no harder quest you give?
If this beast is bound by spells around
No one of you will live!"
The cat he grabbed and lifted high
But long and longer it now got
He was struggling with the loudest cry
Until a foot was lifted, not a lot
Loki fought against the fire
Thjalfi ran against a thought
No one ever lift the serpent higher
Against the ages all draw short

[Refrain:]
Utgard, Utgard, Utgard

The rage filled Thor and he did claim
To get another task to see
He danced with Elli and for his own shame
Was forced down to his knee
Now dirty tricks where all revealed
By magic they where fooled
Now as they leave the playing field
They know the way this games where ruled
