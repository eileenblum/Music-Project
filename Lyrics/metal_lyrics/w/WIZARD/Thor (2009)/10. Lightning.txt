Mjoellnir flies across the sky
And giants fall down dead
Lightning strikes with power
Crush them in their head
They fear the Hammer everywhere
The Thunder calls for death
No living thing will harm our god
Until the serpents' breath!
From dark clouds fire falls to us
A battle rages high

[Refrain:]
Lightning, Thunder, Wind and Rain

Hammer's crushing heads and bones
And lightning strikes his foes
Dark rain's washing off the blood
While the Wind of anger blows
So many giants flood the world
They'll never be all gone.
Whatever we might fear at night
The Thundergod will battle on!
Up the fight is going on
Fly, goatdrawn waggon, fly!
