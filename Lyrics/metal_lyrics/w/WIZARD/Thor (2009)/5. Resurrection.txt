Is it all gone when
the worlds have burned?
Who will be then
There when fate has turned?
Strongest god he fought so well
But time comes to us all
Thor is not afraid of hell
One day anyone will fall
A new world will arise
From ashes and remains
Take a look, open your eyes
Destroyed will be the chains

[Refrain:]
Resurrection
of Thor's Hammer
in the time
of the golden dawn.

Both Thor's sons have survived
Hammer's back, prevails
The new world now will thrive
Never will forget the tales
An end is always carrying
The seed of a new start
Just take a look at everything
Old and new not far apart
An end has come to Yggdrasil
All worlds are burned away
A golden time, oh don't you feel
Will follow up that day!
