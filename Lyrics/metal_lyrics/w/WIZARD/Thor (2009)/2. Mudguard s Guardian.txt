[Father:]
"First drops of the rain come down
Hurry home my child
The hammer swinger rides alone
His goats are gazing wild"
Protecting us from giant hordes
His hammer flies in rage
Destroying all the giant Lords
From now they will not age

[Refrain:]
Kill the troll is what he will
He hurries to the place
Goats are running, Hammer kill
Lightning shows his face

[Father:]
"Come on my child, we have to leave
Protector's passing by
Find shelter from the giants grieve
Redbeard's flying high"
A war cry scatters enemies
The giants live in fear
Mudguard's Rivers, Hills and trees
Are well guarded far and near
