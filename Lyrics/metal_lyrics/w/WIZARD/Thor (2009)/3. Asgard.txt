See the shining place,
high in eternal space.
Across Heimdall's bridge
you have to go.
Unreachable for you and me.
We will never see
the home of the gods.
This holy land.

[Refrain:]
Asgard, Asgard.
The home of the Gods
Asgard, Asgard
This holy land

Built with giants power.
In the center Odin's tower.
A stronghold tall.
But one day it will fall.
When giants are running,
Suturs flames are coming.
The gods will face
their destiny.
