Have you ever seen a unicorn in the dawn?
A shining creature of light
Should you have seen a unicorn in the dawn
You will never forget it's vision of light

But then one day dark creatures crossed the land
Aiming to destroy the beauty of life
They saw the lovely unicorns in the dawn
The white pearl of nature layed in their hands
They shot their black arrows at the unicorns
With but a few surviving this hell slaughter

Have you ever seen a unicorn in the dawn?
A shining creature of light
Should you have seen a unicorn in the dawn
You will never forget it's vision of light

Hence, the unicorns disappeared from sight forever
Where are they, where do they live now
Open your heart and you will see them across the world
In every flower, every animal their spirit lives on
Behold their spirits surrounding you
You may kill their bodys but you can't kill their souls

Have you ever seen a unicorn in the dawn?
A shining creature of light
Should you have seen a unicorn in the dawn
You will never forget it's vision of light
