The land, gloomy and cold; death lies in the air
Human prisoners of the world; it's hopeless, grief and rage reign
But four brave warriors will rescue the world
They will fight against the darkness
Searching for the diamond of freedom

Warriors of the gods - you are ready to fight
Warriors of the gods - hold your weapons high
Warriors of the gods - ride faster than the wind
Warriors of the gods - to save the world

It's a long hard way, full of pain
Beforehand they ride into the uncertain
They kneel in front of a fire and plead for aid
Lightning and thunderstorm, a mighty creature appears
It gave them a sword made by the gods
A sword full of splendour and steel

Warriors of the gods - you are ready to fight
Warriors of the gods - hold your weapons high
Warriors of the gods - ride faster than the wind
Warriors of the gods - to save the world
