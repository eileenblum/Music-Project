Metal rules the world
Metal is a force
It's more than a style
It's our life

Come in our arms
Brothers and sisters of steel
Stand together with us
Your sword will prevail

It doesn't matter what you wear
It doesn't matter who you are
The only thing that matters
Is that there is metal in your heart

Gladiators of steel, steel will prevail
Fighting for the metal sound
Gladiators of steel, steel will prevail
Fighting for the heavy metal sound

Our hearts will beat together
To the metal sound
We are proud to be in metal
We are proud to hear it loud

Gladiators of the world
Fight with us for metal
Bang your head of steel
To the heavy sound
It doesn't matter what you wear
It doesn't matter who you are
The only thing that matters
Is that there is metal in your heart

Gladiators of steel, steel will prevail
Fighting for the metal sound
Gladiators of steel, steel will prevail
Fighting for the heavy metal sound
