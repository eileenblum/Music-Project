We saddle our horses 'cause we must fight again
Liars and betrayers anew stand in our way
We drink the wine of anger mixed with our blood
A last look at our weapons and a prayer to our gods

We're made of power, we're made for war
We are made of thunder and steel

Spill, spill, spill; spill the blood of our enemys
Die, die, die; enemy die
Spill, spill, spill; spill the blood of our enemys
Die, die, die; enemy die
Enemy die

Like cruel dark knights we are hungry for a fight
We'll conquer every stage, enemies feel our rage
You cannot buy our mercy with gold, silver or money
But you can kiss our asses and eat our stinking shit

We're made of power, we're made for war
We are made of thunder and steel

Spill, spill, spill; spill the blood of our enemys
Die, die, die; enemy die
Spill, spill, spill; spill the blood of our enemys
Die, die, die; enemy die
Enemy die

Spill, spill, spill
Spill, spill, spill

Spill, spill, spill; spill the blood of our enemys
Die, die, die; enemy die
Spill, spill, spill; spill the blood of our enemys
Die, die, die; enemy die
Enemy die

Spill, spill, spill

We will spill the blood of our enemies
