We are four brothers, bound by metal and steel
The wizard of lightning at our side
We gave an oath to our masters
That no one can stand between us four

Only together we can win the battle of steel
Hold your weapons high for real metal

Bound by metal - we ride through the world
Bound by metal - sending a message to you
Bound by metal - we scream it loud and proud
Bound by metal - metal rules

The shackels of metal hold us together
And give us the power to play real hard metal
Warriors of the truth follow us into a world that
You've never seen before, let the fantasy be real

Only together we can win the battle of steel
Hold your weapons high for real metal

Bound by metal - we ride through the world
Bound by metal - sending a message to you
Bound by metal - we scream it loud and proud
Bound by metal - metal rules

Bound by metal, hail, hail, hail, hail
Bound by metal, hail, hail, hail, hail
Bound by metal, hail, hail, hail, hail
Bound by metal, hail, hail, hail, hail

Bound by metal - we ride through the world
Bound by metal - sending a message to you
Bound by metal - we scream it loud and proud
Bound by metal - metal rules
