A hammer made of unbreakable stone
A bow made of black wood
With a string of white light
An axe made of silver, gold and diamonds
And a sword made of steel
Tempered in the sea of the gods

Hail the new lords, chosen by the dragon lords
Hail them, who are fighting with the weapons of the gods

Hammer, bow, axe and sword; see the weapons of the gods
Hammer, bow, axe and sword; feel the power of their lords

Hammer, bow, axe and sword; hammer, bow, axe and sword
Hammer, bow, axe and sword; hammer, bow, axe and sword
Hammer, bow, axe and sword; the weapons of the gods

A dwarf smithed these four eternal weapons
With the help of the wizard he gave them magic power
It was a small gift for the mighty gods
But for the thunderwarriors it was the gift of power

Hail the new lords, chosen by the dragon lords
Hail them, who are fighting with the weapons of the gods

Hammer, bow, axe and sword; see the weapons of the gods
Hammer, bow, axe and sword; feel the power of their lords

Hammer, bow, axe and sword; hammer, bow, axe and sword
Hammer, bow, axe and sword; hammer, bow, axe and sword
Hammer, bow, axe and sword; the weapons of the gods
Hail the new lords, chosen by the dragon lords
Hail them, who are fighting with the weapons of the gods
