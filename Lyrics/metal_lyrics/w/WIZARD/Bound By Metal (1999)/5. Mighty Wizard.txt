It's a long way, a dark way, trees without leaves
The moon struggles to shine, it radiates blood red
Fear, she feels death but it's the only way
To reach the gates of the wizard, the border between the worlds

Now she's arrived, the mighty gates in front
Little creatures observe her from the other side
It begins to rain, crying and exhausted she falls to her knees

Mighty wizard - open the gates
Mighty wizard - open your world for me
Open your world for a lost soul
Mighty wizard - open the gates
Mighty wizard - open your world for me
Open your world for a lost soul

Warriors of death decimated her hole family
They drank their whole blood and ate their raw hearts
She cried and requested help
Revenge and sadness reflecting in her eyes
The mighty wizard comes out of the dark
Thunderstorms struck the village
With a dark voice he swears revenge

Mighty wizard - open the gates
Mighty wizard - open your world for me
Open your world for a lost soul
Mighty wizard - open the gates
Mighty wizard - open your world for me
Open your world for a lost soul
