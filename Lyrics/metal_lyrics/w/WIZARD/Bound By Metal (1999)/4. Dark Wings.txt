Hear the wings of destiny preaching pain
The pain to live forever in the night

The bite will give you life, a life of a black demon
A demon straight from hell, his hell will be your home

White fangs, red eyes, dark wings, vampires
On dark wings they fly through the black night

On dark wings they fly through the night
Vampires from hell - looking for a bite
On dark wings they fly through the night
Vampires from hell - frightened by the light

You crave the taste of blood, blood is now your life
Darkness is what you're giving to your virgin victims

Life is just a dream as is the road to your death
But your death is not eternal so forever you will dream

White fangs, red eyes, dark wings, vampires
On dark wings they fly through the black night
