Like a tornado we cross the land
Metal destruction is our command
With power and glory we fight for our right
The weapons of the gods are at all time by our side

Armed with steel we fear no enemy
Blessed by the gods we have no agony

See our wounds are bleeding, we take our last breath
But on our faces lies a smile, 'cause it's a nice day to die
a nice day to die, it's a nice day to die, a nice day to die

Thor and Odin will give us the sign
Thunder and lightning in the sky
They'll call us to battle, they'll call the LOD (legion of doom)
They'll call the einheriors to fight at their side

Armed with steel we fear no enemy
Blessed by the gods we have no agony

See our wounds are bleeding, we take our last breath
But on our faces lies a smile, 'cause it's a nice day to die
a nice day to die, it's a nice day to die, a nice day to die
