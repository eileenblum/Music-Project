The battle will come to you
Will come into your dreams
Fight against them all
Heavy metal rules

Together we are strong
Together we are proud
We come as warriors from valhalla

Fight the fight, believe in metal
Fight the fight, believe in swords of steel
Fight the fight, believe in metal
Fight the fight, believe in swords of steel

At dusk will be the time
For us to show the world
That metal rules for ever and ever
We will be victorius
There is no doubt
Together we will win the battle

Fight the fight, believe in metal
Fight the fight, believe in swords of steel
Fight the fight, believe in metal
Fight the fight, believe in swords of steel
