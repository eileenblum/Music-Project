A long time ago
my ancestor died
killed by witchcraft and magic.

A creature of evil,
a thing without soul.
he became in this unholy night.

I was a son
of a warrior for god
my father has told me our legacy.

to search for the man,
who's like cancer in this world.
Now he`ll face his desteny.

[Bridge:]
My hatred heart is the jail for my soul
My vengeance will be the key to the door.

To kill this mistake of the diviners plan.
to bring it to the end.

[Refrain:]
IÂ´ve searched throughout the land,
in the sign of the cross.
I`ve fought evil where it dwells,
in the sign of the cross.

IÂ´m a savior of this world
the last in line,
who held up the cross of my father high .

a holy anger
flows through my veins.
IÂ´m the rage of the holy church.

IÂ´m an angle of death,
on a holy crusade.
A sacred warrior called by god.

I wanna see him dying
Hagen von stein.
Now hear my mortal threat
