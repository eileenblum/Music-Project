The hood deep in her face
her old clothes blown by the wind
she' s a restless wanderer in time
the way is her aim in her life.

Her shadow disappear in the forest
changes into deep fog
she is a master of deception
you turn around and just hear her knock.

[Bridge:]
Thousand years she lives
to protect and heal
to hunt and kill
for the balance of the world

[Refrain:]
The old wise woman from the wood
you all know what she did?
she destroyed my life
this goddamned wife.

Now I want it back.

She is the breath in every spell
the whispering near a grave
silent murmurs full of might
witchcraft words in the night.

She is the abbys, darkest space
beneath the holy wariwulfe
the punishment hammer of god
to fullfill eternal laws.
