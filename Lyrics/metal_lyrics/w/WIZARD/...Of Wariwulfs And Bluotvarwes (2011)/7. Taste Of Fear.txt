Formed by evil Witches
and bloodlusting Bletzer
a wolf is born, mad with anger
and driven just by hunger

It hunts you down
It eats your flesh
and never does remember
that once it was a man as well

Lost all that was gentle
all humanity burned away
an image of hellspawn
and not of God anymore

[ref.]
Fangs and claws, a deadly dance
madness raving in their mind
for flesh and blood they ever lust
are humans nevermore

Their packs will kill
no mercy known
strength only do they love
and vicious is their core

when the moon rises
they come out
and start their evil hunt
for all not save inside

no prayer helps
no pleading will be heard
the last thing you will see
are their bloodied fangs

[ref.]
Fangs and claws, a deadly dance
madness raving in their mind
for flesh and blood they ever lust
are humans nevermore
