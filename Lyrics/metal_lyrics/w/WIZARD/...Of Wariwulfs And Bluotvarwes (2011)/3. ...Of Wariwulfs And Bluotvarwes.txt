Standing in the first line
waiting for the sign
lusting for blood and death again.
They are immortal
they live to fight and to kill

A brotherhood of warriors
blessed by the church
they live and die by their own laws.
Kill like you want
but never , never eat human flesh.

[Ref:]
...of wariwulfs and bluotvarwes
of bletzer and black vargrs
tales of violence we will sing
nightmares we will bring

There is no 8th death sin
but for a wariwulf
avoid this incredible deed.
Inexcusable.
he' ll feel the power of their law.

If he made this mistake
a hagre will lead him
from live to eternal pain.
An undead for all time
Than Bletzer is his name
