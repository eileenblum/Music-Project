I smell your fear when I opened your mind
come to my chamber of pain.

Your soul and your heart are broken and burned
your soul wants to flee from this endless pain.

[Bridge:]
Now your life will change , look to my innocent eyes.
This truth you now' ll see, brings you much more pain,
you have ever felt before.

[Refrain:]
I am your agony
I am your pain
I am your destiny
I am your messanger of death.

Deep in your heart you know what I' ve told you
but you don't realise that this is the truth.

I never was and I never will be
this innocent man, you wanna see in me.
