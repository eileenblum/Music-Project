Ulda

Ulda, sweetest of fair maidens
in Gods own house we met
expiation was what I searched
but love I found - in you!

We danced in the woods
two hearts beating alike
a bliss the almighty gave
but darkness struck again

[ref.]
Fair Maiden mine
forever we shall love
but mind the devils touch
for he comes to get us

When all is good, duty calls,
and honor makes demands
my sword and life for god
I must bring to the fight

When evil stirs in darkest times
no love can stay alive
yet never will my heart forget
what your face looks like

[ref.]
Fair Maiden mine
forever we shall love
but mind the devils touch
for he comes to get us

Through blood and sin I must persist
so I can return to you,
my wife, my friend, my lover
but your mind isnât true

An evil witch has brought you down
to hellfire and sulfur smell
and raped your mind to lay inside
a story so untrue

[ref.]
Fair Maiden mine
forever we shall love
but mind the devils touch
for he comes to get us

you cooked a meal,
of satans making
sweet but oh so rotten
with meat that is forbidden

and while the old hagr
makes me pay for sins
I did not know
I think about my son
