Like a whisper in a cave
like a spiderweb in your face
like fester is their hate
straight into your brain

The flavour of death in the air
the hope for mercy disappear
try to fight if you dare
like water to blaze they appear.

[Bridge:]
They are an ode to brutality
the sin of alife, full of agony
a creation to fulfill an unholy rage
the dawn of doom.

[Refrain:]
Bluotvarwes
the bringer of death
the mistake of nature
artificial Bletzer

Their hate will daze you
greetz from the other side
they bring you far away
to the coasts of sadness

They rush into your soul
to dash your fears and hopes
to left you back in darkness
oblivian and fairytales
