Their dark hearts lust for power
their dark minds search for might
their dark eyes see your secrets
their dark soul eats your mind

Theyâre loyal only to themselves
They follow their own rules
They take your life and freedom
They push you to your doom

[Ref.]
Hecetisse - evil witch
Hecetisse - Satans Harlot
Hecetisse - Mans corruption
Hecetisse - Darkness bride

You better look out
You have to take care
You never will know when
you will be caught

In their net of lies
In their dark magic
In their false beauty
In their hole life

[Ref.]
Hecetisse - evil witch
Hecetisse - Satans Harlot
Hecetisse - Mans corruption
Hecetisse - Darkness bride

Their craving knows no end
They will break your will
You will become their slave
in all eternity
