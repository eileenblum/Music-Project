Born in sin
living in shame
to atone for sins of flesh
and mind and heart and soul

on their knees they live
in the dust below
the feet of proud warriors
they once have been themselves

[ref.]
Lurkers in the dark
playing mindtricks endlessly
unseen but feared
mighty but unloved

Masters of the night

Once they will rise,
and kill without remorse
to become again
the masters they have been

The slaves will rule again
and they will eat our minds
so gods children will fall
and humans will be reigned

[ref.]
Lurkers in the dark
playing mindtricks endlessly
unseen but feared
unloved but mighty
Masters of the night

Their saviour is here
to lead them to the battle
but not in open warfare
they will meet

a dagger in the back
that is how Bletzer strike
and in the dark a single howl
will mark the wariwolfs end
