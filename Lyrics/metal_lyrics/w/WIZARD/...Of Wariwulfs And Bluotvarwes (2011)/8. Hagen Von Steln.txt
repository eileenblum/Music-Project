A long time ago
I grew up on a castle
By a wise Hagr
My life was for told

A warrior for god
A slave to the church
My aim is to serve
Not to rule since my birth

I see the world
With other eyes
My friend is a bletzer
So old and wise

He told me the truth
About my live
A man of the night
Borned to fight

[REF:]
Inside my heart light is apart
Anger and hate is my fate
Betrayers around me there is no trust
I am the loser of the dark

I learned to fought
For the holy church
An immortal warrior
For the glory of god

My passion was fighting
Raping and killing
Those who are wrong
With the false belief

They call us immortal
A brotherhood of death
The lost survivor
Of a holy race

I trust them all
My father, my mum
Now I now
They are all betrayers
