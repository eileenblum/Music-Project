No heart is pounding,
no lounges are breathing.
Cold as a stone,
through darkness I roam.

Creator and destroyer,
ruler and father.
My grief is my griend,
my grudge is my guard.

[Bridge:]
From god I was blessed,
far away from death.
A Hagre take my life,

brings me to the dark side.

[Refrain:]
A cradle but no grave
a beginning but no end.
Alife but no death.
(1) undead insanity
(2) endless pain

From dead I woke up
to life I was damned.
They gave me no choice,
they don't hear my voice.

Now I want it back,
that what they take.
A life with an end,
than all things will change.
