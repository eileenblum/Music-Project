I STUMBLE AROUND IN WALLS OF DEBRIS
IâM PERFECTLY ARMED, NO HAND LEFT FREE
EVERYTHING I WEAR IS DESIGNED TO KILL
FOR THIS JOB I LACK NO SKILL

I LAY LAND MINES OUT FOR THE KINDS
I RAPE ALL WOMEN AND SPREAD MY AIDS
I SLIT THROATS, CUTTING SLOW BUT DEEP
I KILL SOLDIERS IN THEIR SLEEP

WAR BUTCHER â I AM THE MAN! YES I CAN!
I JUST DEFEND RIGHT TO THE END
WAR BUTCHER â I AM MAN! YES I CAN!
TOO LATE TO REGRET, TOO LATE TO FORGET!

SO MANY PEOPLE, FATED TO DIE
THE REASON WAS, ANOTHER LIE
SURELY THEY ALL DIED, BY MY HAND
NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE TO ANOTHER LAND

I AM MAD BUT AT THE SAME TIME SAD
I REMEMBERED WHAT MY MOTHER SAID
PLEASE DONâT GO, DONâT SELL YOUR SOUL
YOUR GRAVE WILL BE IN DIRTY SOIL

WAR BUTCHER â THE LAST COMBAT HAS COME FOR ME
I PISS MY TROUSERS, CANâT YOU SEE?
WAR BUTCHER â I CANNOT SEE THE BULLET FLYING
BUT I FEEL THAT IâM DYING

WAR BUTCHER â WHO SAID I COULD?
WHO KNEW I WOULD?
GRAVE IN THE LAST ROW â RELEASE MW NOW!
WAR BUTCHER
