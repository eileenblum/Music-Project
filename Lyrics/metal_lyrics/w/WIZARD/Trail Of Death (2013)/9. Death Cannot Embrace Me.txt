ONCE THERE WAS A FEVER INSIDE ME
IT SET THE DEMON FREE
AND TURNED ME INTO DARK ETERNITY

I AM, I AM A CREATURE OF MANKIND
AND I LAY IN MY BED
FEELING LIKE A MESSENGER OF DEATH

A BROKEN SOUL IN A BROKEN BODY
THAT IS DAMNED TO DARKNESS
AND CHAINED TO SHADOWS

DEATH CANNOT EMBRACE ME
I DONâT KNOW WHAT ITâS FOR
I HAVE TO LIVE MY LIFE FOREVER
DEATH CANNOT EMBRACE ME
I DONâT KNOW WHAT ITâS FOR
MY BODY IS BURNED BUT IT WILL STAY FOREVER

I TRY, I TRY TO FIGHT THE DEMON
AND I FEEL, I FEEL INSANITY, INSANITY
AND I WAKE, I WAKE UP SCREAMING
AND THERE IS NO HATE OR LOVE I CAN FEEL

I CAN FEEL NO HATE, I CAN FEEL NO LOVE
EVERYDAY I WAKE UP WITH TEARS IN MY EYES
WHO CAN SAVE MY LIFE
WHEN I FEEL DEATH INSIDE
NOBODY UNDERSTAND THE PAIN OF MY LIFE
