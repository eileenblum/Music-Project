ITâS THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM
ENEMIES ARE WAITING
FOR THE FINAL COMMAND
HOW MANY LIVES WILL END?

THE SOUND OF DEATH AND HATE IS IN THE AIR
EVEN BRAVE HEARTS ARE POUNDING IN FEAR

NOW ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE
WITH THE BACKS AGAINST THE WALL
WE WILL TRY TO SURVIVE THIS END OF ALL
NOW ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE
THEREâS NO PLACE TO HIDE
SO RUN AND SURVIVE BEFORE YOU DIE

HUNDREDS OF IMPACTS
BURSTING IN THE NIGHT
THE FIRST HOUSES BURNING
FATHER DEATH WILL COME

THE SOUND OF DEATH AND HATE IS IN THE AIR
EVEN BRAVE HEARTS ARE POUNDING IN FEAR

NOW ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE
WITH THE BACKS AGAINST THE WALL
WE WILL TRY TO SURVIVE THIS END OF ALL
NOW ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE
THEREâS NO PLACE TO HIDE
SO RUN AND SURVIVE BEFORE YOU DIE

THE SMELL OF BLOOD AND SMOKE
TAKES OUR SIGHT
AN UNCHAINED NIGHTMARE
SEE YOU ALL IN HELL

NOW ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE
WITH THE BACKS AGAINST THE WALL
WE WILL TRY TO SURVIVE THIS END OF ALL
NOW ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE
THEREâS NO PLACE TO HIDE
SO RUN AND SURVIVE BEFORE YOU DIE
