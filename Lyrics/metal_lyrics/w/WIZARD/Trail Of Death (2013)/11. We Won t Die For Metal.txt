REMEMBER HOW IT STARTED, THE FIRST BLAST IN MY EARS
BURNING IN MY HEAD, I â WILL â BE â FIERCE
I FELT SO STRONG, INVINCIBLE, MY HEART WAS OPEN WIDE
THE SOUND OF METAL STRUCK ME HARD, I â START â THE â FIGHT

I SEARCHED FOE METAL MANIACS
A BROTHERHOOD FOR ME
I FOUND THEM ON THE STREETS, I â WILL â NOT â FLEE

WE WORE BLACK LEATHER JACKETS
WITH PATCHES ALL AROUND
WE LOVE THE STYLE OF LIVING, BANG â TO â THE â SOUND

IF OTHERS DONâT LIKE OUR STYLE
WE ONLY SAY, FUCK YOU
SO LET US RAISE OUR FIST OF STEEL WITH PRIDE

LET US FIGHT
LET US FIGHT
DEFENDERS OF METAL STANDING SIDE BY SIDE
LET US FIGHT
LET US FIGHT
WE WONâT DIE FOR METAL BUT WE LIVE IT LOUD AND PROUD

25 YEARS AGO WE BEGUN TO DREAM
LOUD GUITARS A METAL SHOW, OUR HEARTS BEGUN TO BURN
POUNDING DRUMS A SCREAMING VOICE, PYROS ON THE STAGE
OUR DREAMS BECOME TRUE, FEEL OUR RAGE

IF OTHERS DONâT LIKE OUR STYLE
WE ONLY SAY, FUCK YOU
SO LET US RAISE OUR FIST OF STEEL WITH PRIDE

LET US FIGHT
LET US FIGHT
DEFENDERS OF METAL STANDING SIDE BY SIDE
LET US FIGHT
LET US FIGHT
WE WONâT DIE FOR METAL BUT WE LIVE IT LOUD AND PROUD
