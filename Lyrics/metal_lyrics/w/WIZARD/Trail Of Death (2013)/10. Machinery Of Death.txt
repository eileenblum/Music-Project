ONE SUNNY DAY, I THINK IT WAS SPRING
I FELT LIKE A PUPPET ON A STRING
I OPENED A DRAWER AND TOOK A KNIFE
A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE SEDUCED MY WIFE

I KNIFED HIM DOWN, TOOK HIS EYES
I THINK HE WAS REALLY VERY SURPRISED
FORTUNE FAVOURS FOOLS, THEY SAY
HIS BROTHERS CAME ALONG THE WAY

MACHINERY OF DEATH I START
IMPRESSIVE, FAST, COMPLETE AND SMART
A RED HAZE LAYS AROUND MY MIND
I SHOW NO MERCY, I AM BLIND

THEY LENT A RIFLE FROM GRANDPA AL
I SURELY MURDERED THEM ALL AS WELL
REMEMBER, WELL BEGUN IS HALF DONE
I RAN TO HIS HOME WITH MY NEW GUN

THEY SAW ME COMING, PRESENTED A FLAK
BUT I WAS FASTER, AND BROKE THEIR NECK
THE NOISE ANNOYED THE NEIGHBOURS' EARS
POLICE CAME SOON AND THEY WERE FIERCE

MACHINERY OF DEATH I START
IMPRESSIVE, FAST, COMPLETE AND SMART
A RED HAZE LAYS AROUND MY MIND
I SHOW NO MERCY, I AM BLIND

WHAT SHALL I SAY IT SHOOK THE GROUND
NO HEART OF THEM WILL FURTHER POUND
SOLDIERS IN TANKS WERE SENT TO ME
FROM UNIFORMS I SET THEM FREE

THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS
THAT WEAPONS ARE NO GOOD FOR THIS
YOU BETTER TALK AND USE YOUR BRAIN
OR YOU WILL FORCE A DEADLY RAIN

MACHINERY OF DEATH I START
IMPRESSIVE, FAST, COMPLETE AND SMART
A RED HAZE LAYS AROUND MY MIND
I SHOW NO MERCY, I AM BLIND
