MY LOVING FATHER NAMED ME ZETH
IâM LIVING IN THIS LAND OF DEATH
THE ONLY GOODS THIS GROUND WILL BEAR
IS COAL AND FEAR WE HAVE TO SHARE

I KNOW THE MINES HERE ARE NOT SAFE
BUT OTHERS TOLD ME TO BE BRAVE
FOR YEARS NOW I WORK IN THIS TRAP
BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY, ITâS CRAP

THE ONLY WAY IS GOING DOWN
DARKNESS WILL BECOME MY GOWN
I FEEL YOU STRONG

I FEEL YOU STRONG, ANGEL OF DEATH
WHY DONâT YOU TALK TO ME, TO ZETH?
YOUR WINGS ARE WIDE AND PAINTED BLACK
EATING MY SOUL, EMBRACING MY HEART,
CLASPING MY NECK, ANGEL OF DEATH

IT FEELS LIKE HUNDRED YEARS HAVE PASSED
I HEARD A BANG ABOVE, SO FAST
THE CEILING CRUSHED DOWN ONTO THE FLOOR
I CANâT REMEMBER ANY MORE

I WOKE UP STUCK BETWEEN TWO STONES
NO CHANCE TO MOVE ONE OF MY BONES
BURIED ALIVE, WELL DONE, I THINK
AWAITING AZRAEL TO WINK

THE ONLY WAY IS GOING DOWN
DARKNESS WILL BECOME MY GOWN
I FEEL YOU STRONG

I FEEL YOU STRONG, ANGEL OF DEATH
WHY DONâT YOU TALK TO ME, TO ZETH?
YOUR WINGS ARE WIDE AND PAINTED BLACK

NO HOPE FOR RESCUE AROUND HERE
I LANGUISH, DIE OF THIRST, DONâT CHEER
IâD NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG
ANGEL OF DEATH IS SLOW AND STRONG

I FEEL YOU STRONG, ANGEL OF DEATH
WHY DONâT YOU TALK TO ME, TO ZETH?
YOUR WINGS ARE WIDE AND PAINTED BLACK
