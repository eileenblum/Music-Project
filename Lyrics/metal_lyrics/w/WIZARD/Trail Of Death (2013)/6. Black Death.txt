DEEP IN THE FOREST
IN THIS SMALL VILLAGE
THERE LIVE THE SURVIVORS
OF MY LITTLE GIFT

HARD WORKING MAN
MOTHERS AND CHILDREN
SWEET SMALL WHITE HOUSES
I DESTROY IT ALL

CAUSE NOW I CROSSED YOUR WAY
YOUR END IS NEAR DONâT PRAY
NOW YOU TAKE YOUR LAST BREATH
HERE COMES FATHER DEATH

IâM THE MASTER OF PAIN
BLACK DEATH IS MY NAME
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU SUFFERING IN MY ARMS
IâM THE MASTER OF PAIN
BLACK DEATH IS MY NAME
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU BLEEDING IN MY ARMS

BLOOD SPILLING MAN
SUFFERING WOMEN
LOUD CRYING CHILDREN
IS WHAT I WANT

FEVER INSANITY
BLOOD AND PAIN
ALL HOPE IS GONE
ONLY AGONY

COME TO MY CHAMBER OF PAIN
I WILL EMBRACE YOU
YOU WILL CRY AND I WILL LAUGH
YOU WILL BLEED
AND I WILL DRINK YOUR BLOOD
FEEL THE ETERNAL PAIN
