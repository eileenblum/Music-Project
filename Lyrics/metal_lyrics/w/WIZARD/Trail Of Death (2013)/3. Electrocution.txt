BY LAW AND ORDER OF THE STATE TEXAS
YOU WILL COME TO DEATH BY ELECTROCUTION
MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL

âDEATH PENALTYâ WERE THEIR LAST WORD
YES, I DESERVE TO LEAVE THIS WORLD
PARENTS CANNOT STAND MY CRIME
A CHILD DIED BY THE HAND OF MINE

IâM ROTTING ENDLESS IN THIS ROOM
AWAITING HERE A PAINFUL DOOM
EXCUSES CANNOT MAKE UNDONE
I DO REGRET, GO DOWN, MY SUN

OLD SPARKY IS A FRIEND OF MINE
I HEAR THE BELLS BEGIN TO CHIME
OLD SPARKY, I AM READY TO DIE
THE FINAL HOUR, I WAS FRY

QUARTER, CRUCIFY OR DROWNING
SHOOTING, STONING, GAS CHAMBER
THE GUILLOTINE, BURIED ALIVE
BURN AT THE STAKE, DIE BY THE KNIFE

MANKIND INVENTED SO MUCH WAYS
TO PAINFUL END A CRIMINALâS DAYS
I ASK MYSELF, IS THERE A SOLUTION
BUT I CANâT STOP ELECTROCUTION

OLD SPARKY IS A FRIEND OF MINE
I HEAR THE BELLS BEGIN TO CHIME
OLD SPARKY, I AM READY TO DIE
THE FINAL HOUR, I WAS FRY

OLD SPARKY IS A FRIEND OF MINE
I HEAR THE BELLS BEGIN TO CHIME
OLD SPARKY, THE CHAIR IS READY, I AM NOT
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS NO PLOT?
