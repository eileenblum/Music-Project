YOU CALL ME SAINT
YOU CALL ME SINNER
SOMETIMES YOU WANNA BURN ME
BUT IâM NOT GOD
AND IâM NOT EVIL

I AM AN ANGEL OF THE DARK

FOE SO LONG I WANDERED
AND SEARCHED THE TRUTH
IS THERE A SENSE IN THE END

MY FLESH IS IMMORTAL
BUT MY SOUL IS DEAD
NOBODY CAN IMAGINE THE PAIN

A DARK DESIRE INSIDE ME
NO WORDS WILL GIVE ME HOPE
DAMNED TO ETERNAL LIFE
NO WARMTH EMBRACES MY SOUL

I AM AN ANGEL OF THE DARK
I LIVE HUNDREDS OF YEARS
I SAW MILLIONS OF TEARS
I AM AN ANGELS OF THE DARK
I AM NOT BORN TO DIE
I AM NOT BORN TO CRY

ALONG TIME AGO
I FELL IN LOVE
MARIA, MY WARMTH AND MY LIFE

BUT IT ENDS LIKE IT STARTED
IT CRUSHED ALL MY HOPES
TO LIVE A NORMAL GUY

A DARK DESIRE INSIDE ME
NO WORDS WILL GIVE ME HOPE
DAMNED TO ETERNAL LIFE
NO WARMTH EMBRACES MY SOUL

I AM AN ANGEL OF THE DARK
I AM AN ANGEL OF THE DARK
I AM AN ANGEL OF THE DARK
I AM AN ANGEL OF THE DARK
I LIVE HUNDREDS OF YEARS
I SAW MILLIONS OF TEARS
I AM AN ANGELS OF THE DARK
I AM NOT BORN TO DIE
I AM NOT BORN TO CRY
I AM AN ANGEL OF THE DARK
