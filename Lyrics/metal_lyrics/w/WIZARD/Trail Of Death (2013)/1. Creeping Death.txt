MY LIFE WAS NOT EXITING
BUT ALSO NOT REALLY FRIGHTING
I DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE THINGS
WHATEVER FUTURE BRINGS
EXPECTED SURELY TO LIVE FOREVER
AT LEAST FOR ME TIMEâS RUNNING SLOWER
THIS CHANGED WITHIN SOME PAINFUL DAYS
THERE WOULD BE NO REDEMPTIVE WAYS
UNHEALABLE BUT FAST DISEASE
NO DRUGS WERE FOUND THE PAIN TO EASE

WHEN NIGHT COMES DOWN, FROZEN INSIDE
IâM PETRIFIED, I CANNOT HIDE

THIS AGONISING CREEPING DEATH!
HOW CAN I STAND THIS ON MY OWN?
OH MY GOD, IS THIS YOUR DRESS?
PLEASE DONâT LET ME BE ALONE!

THE PHYSICAL DECAY IS CLEAR
THATâS NOT WHAT I DO REALLY FEAR
BUT WHAT IS UP WHEN ALL IS DONE?
WHAT AWAITS ME, WHEN IâM GONE?

IâD GLADLY TRUST IN JESUS CHRIST
ETERNAL LIFE AND PARADISE
BUT IT IS SO HARD FOR ME
WHAT WILL I SEE, WHAT WILL THERE BE?

NOW IT IS NEAR, THE LAST GOODBYE
THEREâS NO TIME LEFT TO ASK YOU WHY?

THIS AGONISING CREEPING DEATH!
HOW CAN I STAND THIS ON MY OWN?
OH MY GOD, IS THIS YOUR DRESS?
PLEASE DONâT LET ME BE ALONE!
