Bondaged I laid in this room
Waiting for torture that will come
I will survive it 'cause I've done it before

I hear your steps, my heart was pounding
I hear your steps, fear around me

Your cold psychotic eyes
Break my walls and anger
Your mask was stripped down, I don't understand

Is it you - or not, why?
Father?

Nobody will hear your cries
Here in this chamber you will die!

Death is my life, oceans of time
I've sailed to find you

Now is the time and I look
I look into your black eyes
In a destroyed fortress that was your soul

Frozen inside, when I see you
Frozen inside.....

You never told me about
About these hours of agony
But I must do what I have to do

The voice told me, so I must kill you
The voice told me... kill her!

Nobody will hear your cries
Here in this chamber you will die!

Death is my life, oceans of time
I've sailed to find you
Here in this chamber you will die
Nobody will hear your cry
