I will hear your screams tonight
In this dungeon without light
Torturing your body without mercy
Breaking your bones, burning your flesh

I don't wanna hear your lies
I saw the evil sign on your skin
Tell me the truth you are a witch
A servant to Satan burn bloody bitch

Fire and blood - my fire
Fire and blood - your death
Fire and blood
Your blood is my sacrifice

The Spanish boot broke your leg
Glowing steel burnt your flesh
The whiplash on your back
Makes you scream
Tell me the truth or die

Your whispering I understand
You slept with Satan to the end
Riding with demons through the night
Die by the cross you will burn

Fire and blood - my fire
Fire and blood - your death
Fire and blood
Your blood is my sacrifice

You stand on the pyre
The fire kisses your flesh
Screaming in pain
And you look into my eyes
And that what you see, makes me smile
Cause you know that I'm Satan in disguise
