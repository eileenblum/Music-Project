We summon the power of those who dare
To stand in the first line

With fire and smoke in their hair
Screaming for metal

With those who survive this show like laughter
We will drink their blood

Of those who died in this night
Hail their might

In honour they died
In honour they'll live on
High in Valhalla
They'll make us strong

We are ready to conquer ready to fight
Heavy metal is our guide
We are ready to conquer ready to fight
Heavy metal is our pride
Heavy metal is our guide

We sit around backstage awaiting the sign
To come over you

Like burning rain in the night
A whirlwind of doom

Spikes and leather on the stage
Like roaring rage

This is the total domination
Of true metal
