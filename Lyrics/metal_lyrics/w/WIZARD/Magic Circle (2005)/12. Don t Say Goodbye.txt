Sometimes destiny calls you
To another way of life.
Sometimes you have to give up dreams
For a decision, you know that is right.

But it's better to say truth than to lie.
If others are shocked, it doesn't matter.
You must do what you have to do.

Don't say goodbye, brother
Across the mountains and the see.
We will ride together
When the sound of battle calls your name.

Don't say goodbye, brother
Across the mountains and the see.
You have to choose your side take your metal weapon....
Let's ride!

An end is everytime a new beginning
New chances for a new life
Believe in your power believe in your strength
Victory will be yours

But don't forget that there are three guys
Who are filled with honour and pride
To call you brother. To call you friend to ride with you
Side by side
