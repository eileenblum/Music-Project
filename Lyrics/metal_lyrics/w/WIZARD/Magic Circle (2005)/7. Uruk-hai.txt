Run for your life, (or) are you ready to die
For the kingdom of the shadows
Our black lord commands us to fight
To kill and destroy

We are Uruk-Hai our kind will survive
Thousands of battles in blood
Now we are here with fire and steel
To all the free folks, "you will kneel"!

We raise the flag of destruction
We raise the banner of pain

We're riding for the darkness
Death at our side
Demons and dark hordes
Like brothers we will ride

Our shields will not break
Our swords smelling blood
Muscles strong as a tree
Now we are here, the black lord calls
Middle earth must fall

The lust for slaughter in our eyes
We won't die of hunger
Your flesh our bread your blood our wine
Make your last sign the first one is mine

We raise the flag of destruction
We raise the banner of pain

We're riding for the darkness
Warriors at our side
Are demons and dark hordes
Like brothers we will ride
