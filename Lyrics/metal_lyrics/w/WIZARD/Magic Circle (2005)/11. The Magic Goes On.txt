Like an earthquake from behind
A storm from the front
The drums are pounding
The guitar burns

Four broken chains
Lay on the ground
Like demons from hell
We play our sound

Now it's time for wizard
We will conquer every stage
Now it's time for wizard
Follow our way if you dare

The magic goes on the wizard so strong
Defenders of metal yeah we will come
Four thunder warriors who will fight who'll die
For the true sound we play and prefer

We will thank you all our friends
For the trust you gave to us
The great time and your fire

As long as we have the power
We will never stop
Let's raise our arms for our dream

Now it's time for wizard
We will conquer every stage
Now it's time for wizard
Follow our way if you dare

The magic goes on the wizard so strong
Defenders of metal yeah we will come
Four thunder warriors who will fight who'll die
For the true sound we play and prefer

Four thunder warriors
Fight for true metal
In the sign of the wizard
Blessed by the gods

Four thunder warriors
Let the magic go on
Never kneel
Forever strong
