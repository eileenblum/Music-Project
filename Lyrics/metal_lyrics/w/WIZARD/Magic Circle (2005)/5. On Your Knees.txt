In the cold of the night
We look for a bite
We walk through the jungle of back streets and stone

You are the right
Give us your potion of life
It runs through your chest, take your last breath.

On your knees
Down on your knees we let you bleed
On your knees
Don't pray for mercy we do what we please

Buried alive
At day we must hide
But the new generation will walk through the light

Then they'll live by your side
There will be no place to hide
Better give up don't fight for your blood
