You are my hope, my love, my warmth
My refuge, my guard, my father
Father, father, father

Fear of the night like a never ending nightmare
I close my eyes my skin is so hot
This smell I know it is so close
Can't understand pain in my heart

I pray to god for mercy
But no-one hears my despair

Destruction in my thoughts
Anger in my veins
I will see you bleeding for the pain you gave to me

I ask you to forgive me
What have I done, what have I done
Every night the same dream
My grief is unbearable

I pray to god for mercy
But no-one hears my despair

Destruction in my thoughts
Anger in my veins
I will see you bleeding for the pain you gave to me

But the way out of the torment is near
The last chance of liberation
Our blood will set my mind free
Free..... Forever free.....
