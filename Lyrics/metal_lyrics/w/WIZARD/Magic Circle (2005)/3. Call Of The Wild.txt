Riding on the road to nowhere
Guided by the stars
Drinking, rocking, fucking chicks
Kick some bloody asses

Feel the power inside you
Let it free
With your bikes you will ride
Like thunder in the sky

Let us ride like one man
Let us hear the freedom sound

Hear the call of the wild
Deep from your heart
The call of the wild
That makes you smile

Give a shit what other says
Wimps you shouldn't care
Let them eat your burning wheels
Laugh about them when they creep

Do just what you wanna do
The road will burn
Turn the engine up to ten
Live with power to the end

Thousand bikes are roaring
Feel the shaking ground of the earth

Hear the call of the wild
Deep from your heart
The call of the wild
That makes you smile

We're riding free
Smell the gasoline
Yeah on the road
This is our home
