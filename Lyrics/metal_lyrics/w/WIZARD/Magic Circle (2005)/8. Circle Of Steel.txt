Where is your power
Where is your dominion
Throw away your prejudice

Can't you see it
We all have the same hearts
Pounding for a brotherhood of blood

Let's drink together the holy mead
Raise up the horns for the same we live

Come together to the circle of steel
Where the power and the strength will be hailed
Come together to the circle of steel
Where the honour and the truth will prevail
Celebrate with us in the circle of steel

Let us unite
Stronger than ever
Feel the power
Let the weakness die

Let's drink together the holy mead
Fight for metal till we bleed

Come together to the circle of steel
Where the power and the strength will be hailed
Come together to the circle of steel
Where the honour and the truth will prevail
Celebrate with us in the circle of steel

Metal heads come together
Where the power and strength will be hailed
Metal heads come together to the circle of steel
