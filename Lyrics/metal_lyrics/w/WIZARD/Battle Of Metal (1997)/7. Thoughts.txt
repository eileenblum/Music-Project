I'm sitting at the window
looking at the black landscape
Rain falls down at the window
like tears from my eyes

Thoughts fly through my head
thoughts about my life
about the world I live in
the seasons the winter

Awake and no bird was singing
the trees looked meaningless
Rain snow no flowers no feelings tired
I'm dreaming the time

Thoughts fly through my head
Thoughts about my life

Music wakes up thoughts
thoughts of the summer
the season I miss thoughts
which will help me in the winter

The winter I had lost a person
died in winter
tears are falling the person was funny
and enjoyed living
But a sickness destroyed his life
