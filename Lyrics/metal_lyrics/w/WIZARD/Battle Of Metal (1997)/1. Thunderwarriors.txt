Warriors made of lightnings
thunder and black steel
Armed with mighty weapons
for their destiny

To all who have betrayed us
hear the battle cry
You'd better run for your life
Or you will die

We fight we kill
We have no fear we feel no pain
Heavy metal devastation is our aim

Thunder warriors fight...kill...
...Feel their power

See our warriors the legion of doom
They are coming soon

When we play our metal
They will rule the hall
They are ready to fight
They are ready for war
