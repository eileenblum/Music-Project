Blackeyed giants with a skin of leather
With wings of steel and crawls of stone
Mighty black kinks high in the sky they fly
They have no weapons to win the fight

They're spitting fire burning so hot
Like the heat in hell fighting those
who betrayed them fighting for the law

Dragon lords high in the sky they fly
Dragon lords a fire in the night
Dragon lords defenders of the truth
Fighting for the metal law

Watchers of the universe warriors of the night
chosen by the gods to win the fight
In the last battle the battle of metal
they lead the thunderwarriors to the light

See their army
The legion of doom war is coming soon
Run for your life metal is coming
Bound by thunder and fire
Like one man we stand against this high society
We laugh about their lies and their false morality
The war for our way of life is our aim here tonight
We burn those down who stand against us
and blow their dust with our metal storm
