Hunted by your thoughts
Signed by your own sickness
You're asking why
Waiting for your death

You're praying to god plead for mercy
Your life was too short but nobody grants you

You prayed to god for mercy
You prayed to god for a sign
But in your last hour
You know he is not there

Your body will corrode
You lay suffering
Pumped full of drugs
falling in oyur last sleep

Death is coming now
The torture has an end
You are laying in your grave
"Thanks god for your life hah!"
