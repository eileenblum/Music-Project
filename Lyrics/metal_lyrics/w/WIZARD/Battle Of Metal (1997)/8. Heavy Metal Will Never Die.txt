Is the metal dead?
I don't think so
As long as we live
The metal will never die

We write metal history for us
and for all real metal fans
music makes us strong
It's vital for us

heavy metal will never die
heavy metal stands over all my friend

Who says: The metal would die
cannot be our friend
he may die in hell and then
he sees that metal is alive

He must come to our concerts
than he will hear the loud guitare
Burning in his head so loud
and fast like an explosion
