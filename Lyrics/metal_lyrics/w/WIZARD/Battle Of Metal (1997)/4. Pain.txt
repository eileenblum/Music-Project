After a long trip fought for my glory
signed by my blood I came along this village
to find my eternal freedom

It didn't take a long time
And I saw you full of beauty
My feelings told me immediately
That you are the right woman

Pain that's what love will give you
Sooner or later it will be regular

I never thought that I can love
Something more than my sword
The battle and blood
But there was you
I thought about you every day
Your picture in front of me a dream

It didn't take a long time to
demonstrate my affection
and we were falling in love
we lived our dreams night and day
But the end was close
