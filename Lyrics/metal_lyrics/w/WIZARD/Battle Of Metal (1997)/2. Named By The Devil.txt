I ride through the land
By my side a thousand of fighters
They follow me wherever I go

We ride through the land
With hate in our soul
Destruction is our commend
The extermination of one race

Murder is our performance
Convince is our task
Named by the devil we cross the land

The devil gave us the task
Human who believe in god
Must be exterminated signed by the devil

Woman cruelly raped and murdered
Set alight houses and killing men
Only the children will be spared
We indicate them the right way to hell

We ride through the land
Destruction is our command
Woman cruelly raped and murdered
Only the children will be spared
To praise satan
