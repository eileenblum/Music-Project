When we play our metal
loosers come out of their holes
They're telling shit about us four
But we don't care

Than we turn back to our amps
and burn them up to hell
to the brains of our enemies
give up their rotting lifes

No one can stop our battle of metal
Out of our way or you feel our steel

Our hate will burn you
Feel the power of our hearts
Riding lightnings in the dark
The day will come
when we piss in your face

Whenever liars and betrayers cross our way
They wonna fall us in the back to kick our ass
But before they can see we are turning around
And we take our weapons and smash them to the ground
