The hero rides through the silent night
The sky is black like hell
Out of howling of some wolves
and the noise of his horse is nothing he can hear

He is on his way to the kingdom of devil
His aim is to take his mistress out
Armed with bow armed with sword
he rides to set his mistress free

Through swamps and bush he must hide forward
The devils adherent try to stop him
But his sword shelters him
and the gods stand by him

Full of hate and pain in his heart
His body studded with scars
Remembers a love time with his mistress
He swears a vow vengeance against the ugly demon

Arrived the devil waited for him
He fought with all his power
Hit the devil with his sword
And set his mistress free
The dark world turned into a paradise of flowers
