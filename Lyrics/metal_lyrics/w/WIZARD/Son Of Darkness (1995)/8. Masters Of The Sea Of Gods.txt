There is a place on this earth it's called "sea of gods".
You will think there is water in it but it's only blood.
The blood of thousands fighters has filled the sea of gods.
When you want to drink it you'll get the power of them.

Fight and kill, warriors of the golden hall.
Fight and kill, masters of the sea of gods.

If you want to find the place you must fight the masters of
hell. I'll give you some weapons to win the fight. Herer is my
sword and bow. Only they can help you. And this is the card
of the forgotten land.
