It seems like a dream but when you open your eyes
you can see reality children are crying 'cause
they've lost their parents. Women are crying 'cause
they've lost their families. You asked yourself for
what is it good for. War is the name of this reality
game. All over the world there is a touch of this game
of this reign of death.

This is the reign of death
This is the reign of death

Children without arms, flames destroyed their faces.
Wherever you see blood and crying people. I asked
you god "where are you?"

Death!Murder!Hate!
Reign of death
