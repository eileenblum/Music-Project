You are a bitch, don't know who I am. We felt in love for some
years. But the last time I feel that there is another man.
No more love between us.

I fucked your ass, you sucked my dick, I take my gun and
I shoot you down.

But now I know it and I will kill you. You will get on your knees
and kiss my shoes. When I hold a gun on your head I will see
in your eyes when death came.

Line-up:
Sven DiAnna - vocals, keyboards
Michael Maas - guitar
V. Leson - bass, backing vocals
Snoppi - drums
