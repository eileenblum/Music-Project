We ride through the sky to find our aim of life.
We find it on the last day to fight the eternal darkness.
The gods are our guides like a shield in every fight.
Feel the power of their eternal force.

Death or glory, gold or nothing, this is our destination.
Fight the evil fight the darkness feel the holy satisfaction.

We are einherier on our way to the glory end on
the ida-fields. Our masters made us strong with a
mighty yell into the battle.
