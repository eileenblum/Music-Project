He saw the rainbow. It will show him the way, 'cause he must find
the way to valhalla. Odin trapped the wizard to oppres him kill
the serpent and the black wolfe or the wizard will die

Created by fire and ice. Burned for a thousand times. A lonely
black heart inside, only made to rule the world. Son of darkness

The world stands behind him, give him power with his horse. He
rides to the darksea. He finds the serpent, cut it into pieces and
the dark wolfe stands on the hill to fight with him.
