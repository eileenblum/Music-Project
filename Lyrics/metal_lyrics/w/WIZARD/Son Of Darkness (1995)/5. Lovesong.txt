Girl I wonna tell you how I feel. I love you more than all of the
world. When I see your smile like the sun or lips that speak
like a bird to me.

I can't stop loving you.
I can't stop thinking about you
'Cause you are the one and only girl I love.

You give me more love as anyone can give.
I know god has made us to live together.
I never want to lose you, 'cause I'm still loving you.

Girl I hope when I make a mistake you will forgive me
and I hope you will always love me for the rest of my life.
