We've heard the sound of heimdalls horn
It is calling us to battle
The iron war will come

Einheriers by our side
Valkyries in the sky
The legion of doom will rise

Brothers hoods of metal prepare for war
Fight with us for metal in the iron war

Defenders of metal fight and kill
Defenders of metal kill with steel

Thunder in the sky
Odin's ravens fly
It is a nice day to die

With the power of our weapons
And the help of our gods
We'll be victorious

Deceivers lay in their blood liars hang on the trees
We let the posers die; we let the posers die

Defenders of metal fight and kill
Defenders of metal kill with steel
