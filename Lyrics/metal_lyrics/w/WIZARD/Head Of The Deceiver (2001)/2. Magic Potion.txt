Show me your fist
Show me the muscles your
Bronze-coloured body out of control

Can you sense it can you feel it
It's like an apparition

You will resist temptation
Against every evil power

But there must be intention
Take your chance right now

Drink the magic potion
Brewed by the wizard mixed by the gods
The chalice stands prepared
The power can be yours

You will feel the blood in your veins
Approach the boiling point
Like a dragon high in the sky
Like a fire you will burn

The veil of magic around you
Like a creeper in the night
Your first and only chance

The destiny of us all is in your hands
