We have gathered around the table
To cleanse our weapons
Of the blood of deceivers
We killed in the battle of steel

But now this is reality
Fantasy is gone
We now prepare our minds
For the iron war

In the sign of the wizard
We will ride to victory
The banner of destruction
Our enemies will fear

(In the) iron war iron war
The philosophy of metal will prevail

We now let our spirits fly
Like an eagle in the sky
Across the mountains and the sea
We are flying high

People of the world
Come and face your doom
Warriors of metal
Are coming to you soon
