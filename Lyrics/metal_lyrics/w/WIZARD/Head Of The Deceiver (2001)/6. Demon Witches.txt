Brother stand up show us your power now
Don't waste our precious time
Your bloodsteel made by magic
Can help us in our pain

Can't you hear the bells tolling
A funeral procession death

The demon witches are on their way
The mighty flock of brutality
Ignite your power for the holy land
Your bloodsteel will help us to our victory

Like fog in the woods
They announce
Our death sentences
Please destroy their wicked magic
Let them feel your bloodsteel with all its might
