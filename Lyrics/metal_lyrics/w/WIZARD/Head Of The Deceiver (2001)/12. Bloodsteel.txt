Fire - iron - blood - steel

By the breath of a dragon the gods melted the steel
That had fallen from heaven as a fireball to the ground

With the mighty hammer of thor they forged a weapon
With the blood of a dead giant they blessed and tempered it

A mighty creature has granted it
To the thunder warriors
To fight against the darkness
For the eternal light

Hail - hail - hail hail the masters of the holy sword
Bloodsteel - the sword of the gods

They must find the diamonds of freedom in the dark world niflheim
Fighting giants to get these shining crystals

With these holy diamonds in their bag they rode to the battlefield
The crystal shining burned the demon shields

Evil creatures fled in fear of the shining light
But with the power of bloodsteel the thunder warriors struck
Maiming and crushing they wanted to kill them all
The bloodsteel sang its tunes of death
But they were few in numbers so in honour they died fighting

Line-up:
Sven DiAnna - vocals, keyboards
Michael Maas - guitar
V. Leson - bass, backing vocals
Snoppi - drums
