Don't trust anyone
Never show your blade
You don't know who is false or true
'Cos dirty rats are lurking everywhere

The true ones you will see
Standing beside you
In the loneliness of the battle
Protecting and saving your life

You are the scum of this world
You are the dust of the street
You are the dirt under our nails
And we let it roll

The heads of you deceivers
(The axeman is now ready)
For the heads of the deceivers

In the end
The glory will be ours
Proud of having lived the truth
Proud of having had no fear

After the valkyries
Brought you to valhalla
The true ones stand beside you
The false ones pierced on their spears
