Once a time without pain
Through spiritual darts
A time of untouched nature
No sign of hate in earthly hearts

Dragon wings in the sunlight
Silence in my dreams in my life
I sing I swear decorates to you
Your fireball a sign by the gods

[Bridge:]
But Dragons death comes fast

[Ref:]
Why â why do you have to die?
The spirit in the sky
Why â do you have to die?
I here your whisper in my dreams

But why you have to die
Dark clouds in the sky
The world have lost a
Magic sign from the gods

The spirit of fantasy in my eyes
If I live or not I canât say
A dark shadow is coming over me
Comes over the whole world
