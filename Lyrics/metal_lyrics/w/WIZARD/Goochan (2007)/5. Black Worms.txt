Created by a bad character â¦
Something was born â it shouldnât have.
Against nature, against all life.
Balthasar laughs and releases them.

Deep in the underground of time
Looking for vengeance and might
Violent flesh, demons of modern times.
No chance for a hereafter.

The metal of dominion is their aim.
To be found at the heart of the Earth.
The way is long, their powerâs destructive.
Mother Earth begins to die.

Like maggots in rotten meat
They trawl the Earth.
There is no protection, no end in sight.
Balthasarâs triumph is near.

[Bridge:]
Creeping and Crawling
Collecting and digging
Wherever they roam
Time stands still
Nature cries
Mother Earth dies
The grave of us all.......

[Refrain:]
Black Worms
- Balthasarâs answer
Black Worms
- Stop them
Black Worms
- The fight for the rule
Black Worms
But nobody can win .....
