Deep in the caves
Of hills and mountains
We are the string for blood
The first one on his throne
The conqueror of this world
Is our lord

[Bridge:]
He gave us the command
To kill them all
To take their ASP
To let them bleed

[Ref:]
We are the children of the night
(yeah) we dance on the grave â
We are the children of the night
Of those who died

Every day another town
Every month another land
Hide and seek is the game
Lust and torture
Pleasure and pain
Is our aim, donât be afraid.
