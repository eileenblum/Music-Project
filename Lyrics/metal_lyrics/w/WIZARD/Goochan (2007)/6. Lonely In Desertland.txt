Death creeps up,
So agonizing and slowlyâ¦â¦
The wine of death pours out of its wounds -
Slowly its source of life runs dry.

Pictures from old times:
âWhen he flew through the air with his brothers,
Majestic, mighty, awe-inspiringâ
- penetrate his brain, through a wall of fear of death.

[Bridge:]
He knows that he has to die.
Nobody can help him, that is the end.

[Ref:]
He is lonely in the desert land.

Darkness envelopes him, the pain subsides.
His heart leaves the rhythm of life.
His ancestorsâ souls quietly call to him,
A light in the distance shows him the way.

His life given for Mother Earth,
Sacrificed for a higher goal.
Pain dissolves, the end is near.
Darkness gives way to the distant light.
