Reborn by the power of the sword.
Revived at the magic halls of time.
With the might of the hammer,
the bow, axe and sword.

Neither fire nor ice, steel and stone â
No spell, no weapons of the world.
No one can stop the braves.
Newly-created to stand forever.

Ref.:
The last resort, the last chance
For warriors of thunder
A union of royal blood
reborn to die.
They are back, back for attack

Four kings - Four whirlwinds of ruin
Like force - Like forces of nature.
The children of the night
Feel their might.

No chance - The worms try to flee
They died - But nothing is save.
Nothing can stop the four
On their way to victory.
