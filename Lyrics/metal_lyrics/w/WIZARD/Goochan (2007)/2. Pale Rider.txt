From outer space he came to this world
To conquer and rule â nothing is safe
To suck it out like a spider a fly

By his mental strength he controls
The mankind and gave religion
But their gods are so far away

[Bridge:]
It doesnât matter how many will die
It doesnât matter how many will cry

[Ref:]
He is the Pale â Pale rider
The bringer of death, suffer and pain
Pale â Pale rider
The lord of destruction is his name

Behind the clouds their lives a tribe
In a cold world where all life will die
They wait for â for the helping hands
All treasure he found here on this earth
And at other planets he robbed too
In thousands of years of his endless pain

I am the Pale rider searching for superiority
The world where I live is like hell so dark
All hate around me I can understand
But my tribe is dependent at all energy you have.
