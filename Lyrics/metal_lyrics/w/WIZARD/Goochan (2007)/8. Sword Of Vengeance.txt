A last silent cry,
Cried out by millions of people.
The certainty to be close to death.

The souls escape from the dying ones,
They flee and come to terms with themselves.
They melt to an incarnation of power,
Formed like a sword.

[Bridge:]
Created in order to kill,
Created in order to free â¦..
From the claws of this beast which kills every life.

[Ref:]
The sword of vengeance
The sword of wrath
The power of peace
The power of death

The witch knows what to do,
She feels the power of the weapon.
Created in order to wreak vengeance.

She lets the sword shine above the world,
A sign for the return of the âthunder warriorsâ.
The âlegion of doomâ of modern age
