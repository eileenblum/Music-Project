Deep in a forest in a magic world
There lived a witch who heard the certain call
Of mother earth who dies and will fall
If nobody starts the holy war

[Bridge:]
For life â to survive
To save â â¦mankind
To destroy â the intruders
To heal mother earth

[Ref:]
She is the witch of the enchanted forest
Holy mother of nature forces
She summons the power of all that lives
To defend the world with nature forces

She tried to call help with mighty ancient words
She call it to the world that mother earth is hurt
The forgotten spirits brutal and raw
Come to help and start the holy war.
