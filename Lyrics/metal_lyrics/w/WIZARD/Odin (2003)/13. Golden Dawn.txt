A grey desert of destruction
Which survived this mortal end
Darkness black water around the world
Is what is left

New and old gods gathered
To make rules for this new world
A united mankind without war
Waiting for the one who'll come

(This is the) dawn of the golden age
(This is the) dawn of a new world
Eternal freedom, majestic pride
In the lost survivors eyes
(This is the) dawn of a new glorious world

Freedom and glory
Around the world
A new reign if gods begin

No war no suffer
No violence
Just peace and eternal love
