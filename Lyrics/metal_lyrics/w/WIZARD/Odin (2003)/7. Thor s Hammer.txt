He rides through the sky
To the northern border-line
Awaiting his enemies
Giants of Niflheim

His weapon is pounding
By his lust for the giants' blood
Armour for a god
And armour to kill

Smashing and crushing
A weapon full of power
The time will come
The giants last hour

FIGHTING GIANTS KILL THEM ALL
DEFENDER OF THE GOLDEN HALL
FIGHTING GIANTS KILL THEM ALL
DEFENDER OF THE GOLDEN HALL
FIGHTING GIANTS
THE HAMMER OF THOR
DEFENDERS OF THE GOLDEN HALL
FIGHTING GIANTS
THE HAMMER OF THOR
DEFENDERS OF THE GOLDEN HALL

He was the strongest
God in the golden hall
His father was Odin
The power-god

In the last battle
He killed and fought together
With his father Odin
The Midgard snake
