There'll be blood on his hands
There is hate in his eyes
An innocent boy
Like the prophecy told

The enforcer of the gods

Why did the gods want
The dark god to die
It was Lokis fault
That Baldur was dead
But they were blinded by their rage

He walked through the shadows he lived in the dark
Awaiting his destiny woven by Norns

God of the dark-where are you now
God of the dark-be afraid
Wali is our vengeance and your death
He can see in the darkness feel his breath

The gods sent the messanger
To the black world of hel
To force the queen of death
To set Baldur free

On one condition she would agree

The whole world should cry
To set Baldur is free
But the giant won't do it
So the light god must stay
So wild hate filled the gods
