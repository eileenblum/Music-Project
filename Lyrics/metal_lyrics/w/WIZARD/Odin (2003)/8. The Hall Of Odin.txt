A hall of gold, shines in the night
A hall for warriors, is our guide
For men and women, with honour and pride
Where the strong and brave lived inside

The hall of Odin shines in the night
The hall of Odin is my guide

So strong so wise is the lord of this hall
Power and greatness he brings us all
The one-eyed the wanderer, the provider of war
Hail him now give him all

The hall of Odin shines in the night
The hall of Odin
