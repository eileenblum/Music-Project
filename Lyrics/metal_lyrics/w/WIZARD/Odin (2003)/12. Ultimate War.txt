Now it's time for the final fight
Einheriers to death and doom they ride
Valkyries of Valhalla fly
With their father Odin through the sky

The king of the hall is riding out
On his horse of doom and death
The fire of destruction burns
In his eye and his soul

The cry of war on the killing ground
The god of thunder ready to pound

Ultimate war
Einheriers will fight ,giants will die
Odin will ride, ripping the sky

Warriors standing side by side
With their enemies eye to eye
They are roaring, the Battle cry
Fight for the honour blood and pride

Forces met with a mighty clash
Noble warriors fight 'til death
Total destruction is what will come
In the end when their work is done
