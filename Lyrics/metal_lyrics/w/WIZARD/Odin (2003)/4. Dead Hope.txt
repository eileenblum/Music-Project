Two souls now dancing
To the music of their dreams
Baldur and Iduna
Hand in hand they walk through Hel

Blinded by cruel darkness
They can't see what is around
Dazzled by their feelings
They don't hear the chaos scream

Two souls embraced by eternity
Brought together by a cruel destiny
Now they'll live 'til the end of time
In the realm of the death-queen

Baldur is dead, the god of life
Killed, bleeding in the sand
Baldur is dead, a poison arrow shot
By an evil hand

Cold tears, no emotions
Two living souls in a dead world
See the death-queen laughing
Don't care about their pain

Crying gods in Asgard
All hope is gone cold emotions
What stands in the future?
When all is said and done

Baldur is dead, the god of life
Killed, bleeding in the sand
Baldur is dead, a poisoned arrow
Shot, by an evil hand

Kill
Shot
Kill
