You will never see the sun again
There is no hope for you
Pay the price for that what you have done
Now your nightmare's coming true

This is your eternal pain
This is your punishment
Revenge of the gods
Pain without end

Chained to a rock until the end of time
'Til the beginning of the end

Torture and pain
His destiny's end for all eternity
Torture and pain, this is Lokis punishment

The deadly snake above your head
Venom in your veins
The ground of Midgard shaken by
Your cries of pain

Lokis wife is by his side
Embracing him in love
She knows that his time will come
