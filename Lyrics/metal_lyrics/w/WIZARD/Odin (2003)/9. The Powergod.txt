The incarnation of brutal power
The leader of the wild hunt
The highest god in Asgard
The master of death and glory

Two ravens on his shoulders
Two wolves at his feet
He is the lord of the golden hall
He is the god of wisdom
He is the god of rage
He is the god of unity and war

Odin - the power god

Now he gathers the Einheriers
He leads them to the final battle
Riding in the first line
Now his spear crosses the battlefield
