Practiced for a thousand years
They're crossing the rainbow bridge
Reaching the ida field
Where their destiny waits

The blood-lust in their eyes
Shines like a star
Their ground-trembling war cries
Wake up the dead

The march of the einheriers

Conviction in their minds
The will to survive in their hearts
Standing in silence
Awaiting the gods
Prepared for the attack
