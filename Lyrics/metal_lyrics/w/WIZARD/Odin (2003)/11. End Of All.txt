Odin knew the truth
But led them all to doom
Einheriers and gods
Trust in his words

Follow me to victory
Let us slay them all!
In his eye one lonely tear
Shows his mortal fear

The gods are dying, the world is crying
In this final war
The gods are dying, the world is crying
This is the end
The end of it all

With a smile on their face
They march into the blaze
Together for their holy land
They ride out to defend

Thousand wounds are bleeding
The gods are going to die
Facing their eternity
Under the northern skies
