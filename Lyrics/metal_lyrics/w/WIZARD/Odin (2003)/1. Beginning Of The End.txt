After Baldur was dead a cruel winter came
Three years long
Brother kill brother
Father killed son

No order no law a time full of war
Fear the night
Asgards cock crowed
The cock of hell too

Heimdall's horn sounds in the night
Einheriers are ready to fight

The beginning-Ragnarfk is coming
Of the end
The beginning
Of the end twilight of the gods

Fenris the dark wolf, breaking his chains
Chasing the sun and the moon
The Midgard snake
Has left the sea of sorrow

Loki rides on a ship made of nails
Right across the world
Satur the giant
Rises with his sons
