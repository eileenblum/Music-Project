Blood!

From the mountains to the plains
To the tracks there were never crossed
Dissension to be grounded
As blood spills upon the rocks
The shadows that we cast on
Stop growth on our own land
The land that we hold sacred
Will now die by our hands

Our friends in dark places
Dark places in our friends

Will our eyes be open when the pain begins
We listen for the children to say it's safe
Safe for us to pray
Prey upon the weak and bite the hand that feeds
Recite the words in vain, to further indulge in sin
Embrace my terror, my reign, Unleashed

And our souls cry out, and the fog blinds all

Blood runs through the hills
Death watches over me
Noose around my neck
Death will set me free

From the mountains to the plains
To the tracks there were never crossed
Dissension to be grounded
As blood spills upon the rocks
The shadows that we cast on
Stop growth on our own land
The land that we hold sacred
Will now die by our hands
We listen for the children to say it's safe
Safe for us to pray
Prey upon the weak and bite the hand that feeds
Recite the words in vain, to further indulge in sin
Embrace my terror, my reign, Unleashed

And our souls cry out, and the fog blinds all
And our souls cry out, and the fog blinds all
Blood runs through the hills
Death watches over me
Noose around my neck
Death will set me free

Burn... we burn we burn
We burn we burn

So these are the steps I take as I walk towards the fucking top
I lay my guns at your feet as you watch
We ask the dead if we can borrow as we take with no answers
Collect teeth from families and offer children cancer
A constant spiral freedom feels a quest for natural health
No belongings
We're all simple ones and now our pain is wealth

Burn.. we burn we burn
We burn we burn

In the mist of chaos, I will rise
To thrive on your fucking lives
A false Christ, I exist and strive
Your life means shit through my eyes
Tearing at your steel, your final stand
You die by my hand

Drown Drown Drown Drown
