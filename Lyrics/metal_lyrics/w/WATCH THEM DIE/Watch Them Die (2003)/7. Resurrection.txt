Everyday it's the same
You wake up
No end in sight
No way out
Nothing
Cold
And empty
And it never goes away...

Submission! Fear of God!
Watch them rise, we too will be alive

Like dogs of war from another world
We gather at the feast
A taste for blood a loss of life
We sleep with fire, awake at dawn
Running over the ground
Travel onward into the smoke

With the pack or all alone we surely will grow strong
Follow the steps taught to kill again
With the pack or all alone we surely will grow strong
Follow the steps taught to kill again

Resurrection! Resurrection!

Como perros de guerra, de otro mundo
Nos juntamos en la fiesta
Sabor por sangre perded la vida
Sin control de la beastia
Dormimos con lumbre, levantando nos temprano
Corriendo sobre la tierra
Via jando derecho, padientro el humo ni hasiendo ruido

God defiling, pees through the battered skies
We are the ones that fight them again
So we watch them, still through their bloody eyes
We are one
With the pack or all alone we surely will grow strong
Follow the steps taught to kill again
With the pack or all alone we surely will grow strong
Follow the steps taught to kill again
Resurrection! Resurrection!

Dreams are like castles, castles of our gold
There we all prosper, never growing old
Visions of innocence
Words with no lies
Welcome the new and say our goodbyes
A praise of elders bury our blood
Our land is sacred - with water comes mud
Exposing our strength revival to man
It's been forever, now just take its hands
Exposing our strength revival to man
It's been forever, now just take its hands

Sand down the throat, regression of man
Feast will be on and kill when we can
Feast not on fate's food chain
We are the sheep for the last time

Raised is the reason, reasons we are here
Plagued by the demons, the demons of our fear
Believe and bleed and fight for our piece
Ripping the flesh has been our release
Slaughter is seldom, feast when we can
Destroy ourselves, slaughter of man
It's been forever, just not take it's hands

Dreams are like castles, castles of our gold
There we will prosper, never growing old
Visions of innocence
Words with no lies
Welcome the new and say our goodbyes
A praise of elders bury our blood
Our land is sacred, with water comes mud

Like dogs of war from another world
We gather at the feast
A taste for blood a loss of life
We sleep with fire, awake at dawn
Running over the ground
Travel onward into the smoke

Resurrection, resurrection
Resurrection, resurrection

Submission, fear of God

Watch Them Die
We too will be alive
