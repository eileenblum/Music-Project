An ode to the sun, a master plan
Last one standing won't be, won't be man
Living estranged, a life in shame
We praise a god that has no, has no name

Ripping your soul, revealing it all to me
(To the way it was)
Burning a hole and revealing for all to see
(Welcoming the never)
Spinning in circles there is no honesty
(Words we knew not)
Ripping your soul and revealing for all to see
(Our spirits will know the truth)

Take in, take out, not faded by death
This age of pain now grasps for breath
Belittle the laughs and fade to chrome
We search for a black hole to call...
Black hole to call home

Ripping your soul, revealing it all to me
(To the way it was)
Burning a hole and revealing for all to see
(Welcoming the never)
Spinning in circles there is no honesty
(Words we knew not)
Ripping your soul and revealing for all to see
(Our spirits will know the truth)

Torn pages of history, we're living a lie
That we were taught as youth
Torn pages of history, we're living a lie
That we were taught as youth

Hole to call home (Let the darkness breed in me)
Hole to call home (Storm beneath my wings)
Hole to call home (Let the darkness breed in me)
Hole to call home (Storm beneath my wings)

I bleed tonight, behind closed doors
Branded my mind and I fought your wars
Forget the passion, remember the hurt
With me forever now buried in dirt
Last one standing won't be man
Last one fucking standing, won't be man
Hole to call home (Let the darkness breed in me)
Hole to call home (Storm beneath my wings)

I bleed tonight, behind closed doors
Branded my mind and I fought your wars
Forget the passion, remember the hurt
With me forever now buried in dirt

Blinded, by what you see
Last one standing

They're eyes - what you see, They're minds - what you see
They're eyes - what you see, They're minds - what you see

An ode to the sun, a master plan
Last one standing won't be, won't be man
Living estranged, a life in shame
We praise a god that has no, has no name
Ripping your soul, revealing it all to me
(To the way it was)
Burning a hole and revealing for all to see
(Welcoming the never)
Spinning in circles there is no honesty
(Words we knew not)
Ripping your soul and revealing for all to see
(Our spirits will know the truth)
Torn pages of history, we're living a lie
That we were taught as youth
Torn pages of history, we're living a lie
That we were taught as youth
