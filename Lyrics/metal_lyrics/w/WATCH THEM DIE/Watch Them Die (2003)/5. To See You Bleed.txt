Her eyes, see through mine
I take your soul tonight, forever
Forever
The lies, denial, burn my flesh please
Belial, Guide me
Tragic times of stress and grief, suffer pain beyond belief
Her eyes tonight, filled with fear and fire
You'll bleed for me
I gazed in wide wonder at the pain I've found
Delivered me into the ground

Perspective blown away, never like before
Perfection teased my soul, as fate walked out the door
Just like a running dream, destination now of zero
In the battle of the now, timings not the hero
Back of my head, bitch you burned a hole
Stained black by the flames, as dice proceed to roll
Not afraid to get the blade, not afraid to see you bleed
Just to see you bleed
Just to see you bleed

The sadist, journey of a madman
Demon to the winds of time (On my own)
The reaper, host to my flesh
Blessed by the dead (Justify)
The keeper of souls, the angel of death
A shadow among the living (Torment)
Born of sorrow, eternal fire
Haunted by dreams of desire (Let you die)

You lied to me and I believed
Believed in trust and was deceived
What it was, was blood through tears
Punishment through all these years
Awaken, open your eyes
You never thought you'd pay for your lies (on my own)
Laughter, laugh as you cry
And tear out your lips and eyes (Justify)
Now you'll be a casualty for fucking with my mind (Torment)
How does if fell to bleed and squeal?
And be a victim of mine? (Let you die)
I know where you are
I know where you are
I know where you motherfucking are

And so it stops with sadness
Cold as it ever was, closed to the shame
Degeneration, burn marks remain
Filling the feeling for the surface, pressure to rise, live to be burned
Buried to die
Saw it off, your fate awaits
Sawed off, your brains on a plate, terrorize
Cold as it ever was, closed to the shame
Degeneration, burn marks re-fucking-main
Rich foot walks, poor foot crushes
While you scream, your blood gushes
I can hear you breathe, as I taste your blood
It's the taste of your skins
That my demons want
You bleed for me
And the wind will writhe upon your flesh

With death at my side I rise with grace
To see you bleed, to see you deceased

Her eyes, see through mine
I take your soul tonight, forever
Forever
The lies, denial, burn my flesh please
Belial, Guide me
Tragic times of stress and grief, suffer pain beyond belief
Her eyes tonight, filled with fear and fire
You'll bleed for me
I gazed in wide wonder at the pain I've found
Delivered me into the ground
