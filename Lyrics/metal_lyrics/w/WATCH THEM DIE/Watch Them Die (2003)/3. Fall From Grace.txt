As children we sought wisdom, through denial of just that
We were raised by rage and envy
It was the elders that we fought
Distributing our energies, by ripping flesh
Torn between ourselves, and not wanting to regret
Day will end with the dropping sun, as we await the fall
The hands of time will reach the end
The end will greet us all
Existence is falling from grace, we grieve for the slain
For the anger that feeds on our pain, it drains, it's lost
Forever, forever on
Masochistic wings - they now carry us to the top
Flames reach out which we created, suspended now we drop
And we stare at the world from a fiery land

Drifting smoke on dancing flames, Eternal burns the skin
Scars remain where loved once lived, captured world of sin
Surface scraped as fate was raped, Bludgeoned and bled dry
Left for dead, impaled heads, paraded and held high
Words and bones were broken, sorrow and sun they set
Escaping our existence, as fog and mountains met
Nocturnal dreams of fire, the age of end at last
Ignite the world we entered, for our future is burning fast
Take our hands temptation, lead us all to the fall
Take our hands mass mordread, and lead us all

Take our hands temptation, lead us all to the fall
Take our hands mass mordread, and lead us all
Tearing through the years, and now sangre drips like wine
Anointing wounds with pleasure, as pleasure leaves us dying
Existence is falling from grace, we grieve for the slain
For the anger that feeds on our pain, it drains, it's lost
Forever, forever on
The steps we take are numbered
Our days are as well
Live them to the limit
For the future promised Hell
