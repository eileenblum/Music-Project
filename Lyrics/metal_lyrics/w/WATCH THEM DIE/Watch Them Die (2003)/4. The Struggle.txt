Desert the damage for it is done
A kinder world for you is told
As it stands now the angels are lovers
And even extinction is growing old
So we'll reap our stitches sewn
Decisions made with never in mind
We're leaving stones where they were thrown
For the beauty of vision has left us all

Blind

In a blaze of fire, the body burn
A soul was cast, cast down low
A family left, with dust and dreams
For reasons left unknown

Where will it be?
Which way will you run?
When it all falls...
Falls through the fucking cracks

We invest our fucking lives in a struggle... for the lost
Our struggle is forever damned but should be fought at any cost

Where will it be?
Which way will you run?
When it all falls...
Falls through the fucking cracks

In a blaze of fire, the body burn
A soul was cast, cast down low
A family left, with dust and dreams
For reasons left unknown

Where will it be?
Which way will you run?
When it all falls...
Falls through the fucking cracks

Struggle to see the lies (our reasons)
Struggle to not despise (our struggle)
But I can't help but hate you (left behind)
For your bloody ignorance (forever)

Falls through the fucking cracks

And so we wash our hands
With blood from the future
And lasting are the stains
The stains of life

We watch over, fear of what they will do
See them try to bring the warriors doom

We will live as long, as long as memories last
It's one of life's pleasures to let your life coincide with another's
One must deal with the fate of being left alone, when one's faded
Crawling from madness
Pressures on your mind
Crawling from madness and our...
Visions left us behind

Where will it be?
Which way will you run?
When it all falls...
Falls through the fucking cracks
