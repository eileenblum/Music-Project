Lead you to the edge and he will bleed you fucking dry,
you know your life is lost and still you fucking try.
Laugher filled insanity ignoring all you cries,
Response as to why this happens is everybody dies.
Beware of the bastard son, forced to fend for self, yes he was.
Relentless were the beatings on a man that hated man.
Cycle begins, a pattern to hunt to maim to kill,
a vengeful is in his blade, and death is now his will.
Writhing and fighting the struggle begins,
watch him as he destroys.
Ignoring the screams and pleas of you children,
their torment is what he enjoys,
forever lost, in the footsteps of you doom, this is your nightmare!
With every life taken, he will grow strong, surpassing the powers of man.
You'll gaze at the heavens as blood fills your eyes; the time of your passing's at hand.
Bastard son, Bastard!
