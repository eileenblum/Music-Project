I can't escape from this hell, I will not find salvation. These memories are a prison and I burn within its walls.
I've been staring out the windows of my soul but I'm still blind I can't see out. I fucking can't breathe.
This time I've failed you my son. This time I've lost my way. This time all I feel is hate.
In the night, dreams of death, destroying life with every step that I take. I watched them fuckers die.
Screaming at me, I'll show no mercy on this night. I'm on top again.
This time I've failed you my son. This time I've lost my way. This time all I feel is hate.
Demons try to destroy me dreams. They've tried to take my life.
They haunt me to this day, to this night. Still I rise!
Control I've had of no control and yes the clock still tics.
A craving I miss of blood filled palms and so my life it sleeps.
Behold the misery inside my heart. I know you see the hate in my soul.
I've been in hell for such a long time, now I see the light.
A quick form of sanity it pours from my insides. The calming of a bad seed and heavy grows my eyes.
I am a demon in an age of fire. A dream that causes thunder.
I have turned my back on the holy deity. I escaped through a painful door.
Through suffering I have earned the sacred knowledge. A wretched ring the circle completes.
Born to suffer and still I rise!
I raise my arms to the sky. My black existence pours from my hands.
In death I am cursed, but I will rise to ride the beast.
I've wandered now for far too long, It's time I get what's mine.
Ripping through your world of screams, pleasure in pain I find.
I am a demon in an age of fire. A dream that causes thunder.
I have turned my back on the holy deity. I escaped through a painful door.
Through suffering I have earned the sacred knowledge. A wretched ring the circle completes.
Born to suffer and still I rise!
