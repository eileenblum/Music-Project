My eyes are open, deeds yet to be done. Blind angel in darkness, my battle has begun.
Despised throne of lies, judgment brings misery. Pain I endured bestowed my enemies. Down!
Open wide the skies from the throne of God I fall.
A yearning for pleasure a quest for pain, a handful of razors I find.
Beginning to end my blood truly sends chills up and down my spine.
Memories real, carried to death, a father's words written on skin.
Loss of love presented by fear and the feeling of power.
Sequenced prayers and family tears, confirming the importance of time.
Judge the years by aging child and counting the friends that have died.
Don't believe! Don't believe! You are deceived! Don't believe!
Grip on life has just let go. Power! Fate delivers its final blow, a king has passed his throne.
In the night the eyes of the serpent, the darkness my world.
Blood-stained sun it sets my mood, mark failure with broken glass.
The empty, brought on by self, words and scars and aaauugh!
Sequenced prayers and family tears, confirming the importance of time.
Judge the years by aging child and counting the friends that have died.
Don't believe! Don't believe! You are deceived! Don't believe!
Grip on life has just let go. Power! Fate delivers its final blow, a king has passed his throne.
Beyond this world in which I live, is what I wish to know.
A bonding of family a passing of the time, a joining of arms and a meeting of the minds.
A memory revived, no stone goes unturned. Reunion of the buried, reunion of the burned.
Deliver us, that's what they believe. Suffering for their pride, that's what they believe.
Now we are never. Now we're on our way. Now we are all gone. Reborn ashes under flames.
