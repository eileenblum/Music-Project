A blast in the blistering age, a smell of rot now floats. Cursed the following few, chemicals drop down burnt throat.
My heart has taken over me, I'm lost my heart is black. With the wings of God behind me, unleash the unholy upon man.
Enemies are created, more with passing days, innocence knows not this sword, and bloodshed paves the way.
A fiery passage of time. Revealing a world unknown. Leaving the weak and the withered behind, in search of an emperor's throne.
These feelings of hate immortal, the feeling of pain forever; you shall receive what you desire. You will burn with the devils in the fire.
Countless lives laid to rest, as steal unites with skin. The cries of children fill the air as compassion turns to sin.
Nectar fluid of life, a saint's blood has been spilled. Feast on the bones of fallen kings as innocence is killed.
Starvation, mutilation, methods to kill time. Salvation, redemption, and punishment you're dying.
Lust, my heart is black, Hate, my soul is hollow. Sorrow, do you feel it inside you? My hell will you follow me to hell?
A blast in the blistering age, a smell of rot now floats. Cursed the following few, chemicals drop down burnt throat.
My hands around your throat bring an end to your agony. The suffering in you eyes, makes my pain, go the fuck away.
