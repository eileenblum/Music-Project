Shifted the minds of youth as elders seek the black.
Falling, falling fast, hot walls they burn the flesh.
Callow are the sheep that seek the shepherd's flock and hallow are the meek that believe the liar's book.
A messenger amongst all of you, deliverer of death.
The giver of your fucking life is now the taker of your breath.
Betrayer misleader there's a liar within, forever and never he will lead you to yourself.
The kingdoms are in ruin, they prophet from your being.
Taken by the heaven's and thrown to the dogs.
So now we bring to you, nihilistic offerings.
Strangled with your rosaries until you are all dead.
So will you follow or will you flee, believe in taking souls?
So will you follow, heed to the words or will you stand alone?
Tare the pages from you black book of lies.
Destroying creations that were set forth by man, burning all the churches while their laughing out loud.
Cursing and blasphemy it flows from their old tongues, deceiving with your black lies and deceiving all the young.
The kingdoms are in ruin, they prophet from your being.
Taken by the heaven's and thrown to the dogs.
So now we bring to you, nihilistic offerings.
Strangled with your rosaries until you are all dead.
So will you follow or will you flee, believe in taking souls?
So will you follow, heed to the words or will you stand alone?
Your search for the stolen hope leaves blood upon your hands,
Beneath your feet is shattered glass and blood upon the sands.
A dark embrace from the one it feared a man with no meaning was crowned.
A lifeless taste of murdered pleas and nothing holy was found.
Deliver evil and lust will follow, a universe screams from inside.
Meet a maker and follow a fool then look for a place to hide.
A God sent son, throne of lies. You lie yourself, throne of lies.
A God sent son, throne of lies. You lie yourself, throne of lies.
