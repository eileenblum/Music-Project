A flight at night forbidden journey she's on her way.
Believe her now while she's screaming at the dawn of day.
A voice familiar hear the sounds I felt her breath.
Behold the strength, awoke from sleep and arose from death.
She went untouched like nothing had changed. Her youthful presence it graced my skin.
She spoke to me like when I was young. Warned be cautious of mortal man.
The skies themselves will weep from loss. Project emotions her voice is heard.
Words of wisdom protect my soul. Never give up and fight for what's right.

She spoke to me like when I was young. Warned be cautious of mortal man.
The skies themselves will weep from loss. Project emotions her voice is heard.
She kept the circle strong, she held the family close.
Her presence will be missed. The woman we love.
