Silence everywhere
The time before the end
Now I am alone
The blow of my horn
Will not break the calm

The cry of the steel,
The sad wail of farewell
The black stone sparks tears
Of anguish in the air
I struck ten times
But the blade I could not break

Oh my sweet Durendal
Born in the deep of the sky
Clear and white against the sun
Please forgive me
I cannot leave you
In unworthy hands

A merciless ocean of hate
Ready to overwhelm us
Only a good death
Remains for us,
Remains for us

If no strength can't destroy you
Invincible sword
Then I will lay on you
And finally hide you from enemy eyes

I strike and strike again
My dance of death in battle
I strike and strike again
Sing for me when I'll be dust
I strike and strike again
My dance of death in battle
I strike and strike again
This sword I cannot break

Darkness begins to fall
And a veil of blood
Obscures my sight
A last blow in my horn
The delivering of my soul

A gloomy moan
Across the mountains
The sound of a glorious end

Wings of archangel
Merciful refuge
There I'll find the rest I need
And in the songs of echo will remain
