In the deep of your heart
I heard a whisper
I feel the silent breath of a hidden folk

Mother forest your life
Seems so asleep in the mist
Of your green embrace

The dying fire of Beltane is caught
In the tender dawn
And the falcon spreads its wings
To the awakening sun
There's immediate life between the leaves
Shining of dew
Here I'm lying waiting for a sign

Still in the daylight
He stands so proud
The king of deers
Is ready for the fight
For the fight...
