I was born in another age
In the kingdom of fear and pain
There was no light of civilization
Every dawn might be the last for me

Faithful steel was my only friend
When wild wind of war blew
A bright sword a magic shield
Followed me everywhere

Riding in search
Of power secrets
Through volcanic lands
Fighting of darkness
To break the curse

The seventh sword I stole
And the spell was broken
Furiously I ride
Spreading fire and iron
And the pain around me

Burns the fire of the anger
Rises the fury of the vengeance
Blows the wind of battle
Clangour of steel on steel
