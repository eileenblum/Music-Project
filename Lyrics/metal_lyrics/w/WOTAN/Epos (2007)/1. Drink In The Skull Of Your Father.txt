Dark eye sockets grim sneer
Empty astonishment to the sky
Where's the blue light of your eyes
And the wisdom of your smile
Be my heart a lifeless crypt
Temple of the hate
Mercy is dead vengeance is awake
I'll never forget his words

Oath of vengeance oath of hate
Swore on my father's sword
Like a fever in my soul
A dark demon without rest
Implacable fire burns
It's consuming me
I cannot forget
Until the last breath
The terrible words he said
Drink in the skull of your father
You will drink in your father's skull
Like a tree without roots
Now I am dead inside
But to avenge go on my life
I'll kill him before I die
Drink in the skull of your father
You will drink in your father's skull
