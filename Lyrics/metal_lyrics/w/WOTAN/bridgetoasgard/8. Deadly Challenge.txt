Dangerous woman
Invincible strength
Many warriors died
In this land

We came here
From the sea
To win her love
For the sake of the king

Untamed spirit
Of a never seen beauty
Look how she proceeds
In armor of gold and steel

But donât be afraid my friend
I will be by your side
With my magic cloak
Accept the deadly challenge

Hand over now your shield
We'll stagger together under her trust
And sparks of fire shall dance
But the warrior queen will be yours

We shall fight
And overcome
We shall fight
And overcome

We shall fight
And overcome
We shall fight
And overcome
