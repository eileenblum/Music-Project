Undefeated sword
Forged by the dwarfs
Dwelling in the bowels of earth

Undefeated sword
Swing in the air
Write my deeds
Every day

Cast for a king
Born in the magic fire
Made of a fallen star
You are deadly to the touch

Do you remember when I took you from the hands
Of the two kings of the land of Nibelungs?

Drink dragon's blood
Rout enemy hordes
Cut demon bones
Open to me the road of glory

Strike, Balmung, strike
Let me hear your song, hear your song
Strike Balmung, strike
Let me hear your song, hear your song

Strike, Balmung, strike
Let me hear your song, hear your song
Strike Balmung, strike
Let me hear your song, hear your song tonight

The sword and the cloak
And the dragon's blood
Make me invisible make me strong

I conquered the land
I captured the gold
Of the kings of Nibelungs

Strike, Balmung, strike
Let me hear your song, hear your song
Strike Balmung, strike
Let me hear your song, hear your song

Strike, Balmung, strike
Let me hear your song, hear your song
Strike Balmung, strike
Let me hear your song, hear your song tonight
