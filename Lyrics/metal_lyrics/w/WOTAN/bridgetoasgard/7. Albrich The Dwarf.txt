In the bowel of the mountain
Where a treasure lies
There's a dreadful warrior
He's the guardian of the gold
Small in stature big in valor
Faithful until death
The courage of a lion
The heart of a wolf, of a wolf

In the dark of a cave
Where the treasure lies
The survivor of a valiant breed
With his magic cloak
He braves me now
But I'll bend his will

In the depth of the earth
Where a fire burns
There is a fearful dwarf
He's the guardian of my gold
Small in stature strong in battle
Loyal until death
The power of a giant
The heart of a wolf, of a wolf

In the dark of the cave
Where my treasure lies
The survivor of a valiant breed
With his magic cloak
He braved me then
But I bent his will

From the dark of the cave
He will guard my reign
Tell the day of my return
With his mighty sword
He defends the land
The most loyal of my men

In the dark of the cave
Where my treasure lies
The survivor of a valiant breed
With his magic cloak
He braved me then
But I bent his will

From the dark of the cave
He will guard my reign
Tell the day of my return
With his mighty sword
He defends the land
The most loyal of my men

Albrich the dwarf
Albrich the dwarf
Albrich the dwarf
