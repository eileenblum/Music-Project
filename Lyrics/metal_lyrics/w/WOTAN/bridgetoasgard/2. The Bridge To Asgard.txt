When you're walking alone in the cold dark night
When you're sailing on the stormy waves
With no more light to guide your way
Donât give up, go on
Donât give up, go on

When the sky is a black veil without stars
When the wind blows strong along the path
And slows your pace along the way
Donât give up, go on
Donât give up, go on

Everything seems to be against you
And the world is a place full of ghosts
And the hand holding the sword seems so tired
There's no more light to guide your way
Donât give up, go on
Donât give up, go on

Look to the sky and you will see
The bridge to Asgard
The way through the clouds
Look to the sky and you will see
Where the valiant men will ride

Look to the sky and you will see
The bridge to Asgard
The road made of light
Look to the sky and you will see
Way of colour breaking the night

Look to the sky and you will see
The bridge to Asgard
The way through the clouds
Look to the sky and you will see
Where the valiant men will ride
