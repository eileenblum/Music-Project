Like an old wolf
Living in the dark
Yellow fangs body full of scars
Lonely and wild
Lost in the night
There's no future there's no past
Fight tooth and nail to survive
Muzzle in the wind to feel the storm

From the deepest dark
Red burning eyes
Watching the fiery lines of the city lights
The howl of the wolf
The cry of a soul
There's no place for me in your world

I'm the wolf coming in your nightmare
The lord of the cold winter nights

Outcast outlaw
Always on the run
Till the last day
White bones under the sun
No fear no cage for the lone wolf
A sadness in the eyes
Reflection of your doom

Chase, chase the lone wolf
Catch the lone wolf
Kill, kill the lone wolf
The spirit will survive

Outcast outlaw
Always on the run
Till the last day
White bones under the sun
No fear no cage for the lone wolf
A sadness in the eyes
Reflection of your doom
