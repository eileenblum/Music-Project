More heathen than the heathens
The last wild barbarian
Hagen knows no mercy
More fierce than the fiercest
The best in the fray
Hagen knows how to die

I strike you in the back
And I kill you like a beast
With my javelin son of hate

You have brought dishonor
To the name of my king's bride
So I have sworn to her
To make you pay

Donât call me a betrayer
I am an instrument of fate
I protect the honour and the reign
Of my king with every wicked deed

So die, Siegfried, die
Your secret now is mine
With deceit I stole your life

I'm the hunter you're the prey
Mortal race to your cruel fate
I'll shed your blood in this pure spring

Donât call me a betrayer
I am an instrument of fate
I protect the honour and the reign
Of my king with every wicked deed

Hagen can strike in the back
The enemy he hates
In the middle of the fray
He never left a friend alone

Faithful vassal of his king
He would die for an oath
Faithfull to his nature
To his last act until death
Divine creatures of the river
Told him of his final fate

As a slave to honour
He proudly goes to his doom foretold
With a fearless heart
He proudly braves his doom foretold
Because he knows
How to die
