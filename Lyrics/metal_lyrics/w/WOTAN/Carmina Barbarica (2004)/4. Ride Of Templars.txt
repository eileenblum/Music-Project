Riding and flying on the wings of storm
Under the shadow of the âBeauceantâ
In the solitude of this sea of sand
Steel may be a good companion

Templar knights come in the dawn
Like a white storm of blood thirsty birds
Breaking in the enemy camp
In a whirlwind of swords

Twenty two against one thousand
Cutting shields breaking bones
Furiously hammering in the bloody mist of battle
Under the red light of sky

[Chorus:]
Black and white, darkness and light
Death and life, pray and fight
Cross and crescent, evil and good
All this called âBaphometâ

Feel the sweet caress of the warm breeze of dunes
Hear the wail of wind through the mountains
The vision fade away
On the red hot sand
So close your eyes
Son of the northern mist
Awake the knowledge
Light on the torch inside
Man came from over the sea

[Repeat chorus]
