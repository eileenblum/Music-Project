The eyes like fiery embers
Smoking nostrils and flowing mane
Untamed steed of hell
Sent by death
This black mount as fast as wind
Will lead you to eternal flames
So furious you are riding
Black conqueror

[Chorus:]
Fly like arrow
Through valleys and plains
On the back of the demon horse
Towards the thresholds of the hades
Is the dark conqueror end

Through your kingdom you are flying
You are trying to pull the reins
But the beast is stronger than you
Mad race to the burning chasm

[Repeat chorus]
