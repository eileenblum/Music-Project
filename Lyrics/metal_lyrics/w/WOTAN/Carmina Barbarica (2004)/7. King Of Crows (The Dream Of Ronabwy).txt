You came here on the wings of a dream
In the heroes age
Little man of a future breed
Sleeping on an ox skin
Two armies are fighting
Before your unbeliever eyes
The crows and the dragon
Best warriors are falling
One by one today

You play a chess game
With the life of your men
King of all the kings
Listen to the king of crows owein
Or no one will remain

Your hands turn to golden dust
The chessmen of that foolish game
The battle is over
And now you are aware
Of your insanity

[Repeat 2nd verse]
