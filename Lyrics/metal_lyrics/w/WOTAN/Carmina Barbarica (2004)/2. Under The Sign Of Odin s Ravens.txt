Under the sign of Odin's ravens
Among the flags the wild wind is screaming
And the forest of steel
Shines there, shines there

The hissing cloud of arrows is like
Black deadly hail
Obscuring the sky
Whisper of death
Whisper of death

Behind the shield still we stand
Waiting to fight, then you can
Hear the voice of my sword
Forged by the dwarfs

Follow the sign of Odin's ravens
The raging horde without cravens
Restless heart, restless blood

But if I fall on the battlefield
Merciful daughter of Asgard lord
Make me fly to the sky
To the hero hall
