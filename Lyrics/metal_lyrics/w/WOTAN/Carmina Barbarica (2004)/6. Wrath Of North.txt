A flight of fire dragons
And awful storm in the sky
Were the dark omens
That announced the disgrace
The ride of many invaders
Was like the scourge of god
Came to punish
All the human sins

In the darkness of this age
There's no light of mercy
Deep is the abyss
Where the world has fallen
Oh lord save our lives
From the rage of the steel
Came to punish
All human sins

Fight, fight for your life
The northern giants came here to prey
Fight, fight to survive
But the Odin's crows,
The Odin's crows
Will fly away

Cry, cry your battle cry
The northern giants came here to prey
Cry, cry for your life
The creaming hordes you have to face
Cry, cry your battle cry
But the Odin's crows,
The Odin's crows
Will fly away
