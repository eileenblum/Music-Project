You can see the silver eagles
You can hear the marching legions
Let fall your sword in the dust
Cause it's time to close your eyes

The sacrifice of your life
Is the only way to survive
For your people, the Gauls, you know
It's the twilight of your age

[Chorus:]
Then go and meet your doom
Covered with your flashing steel
Ride through the marching legion
Shine as a god

But your name will be written
Forever in the eternal stone of legend
Forever you will ride on a wind
On the ages and the centuries

[Repeat chorus]

Before Caesar you will fall
King of the barbarians
So the Gauls will survive
But no mercy for you, only death
Without honours you will die

[Repeat chorus]
