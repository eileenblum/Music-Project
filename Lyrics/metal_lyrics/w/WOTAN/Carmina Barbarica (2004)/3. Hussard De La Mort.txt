No thoughts about tomorrow
Just the pleasure of the flame
In this night of starlit sorrow
Say a wish without shame

Wine and songs until the dawn
Because we cannot sleep tonight
Sing until the chill is gone
No rest before the fight

Thousand fires in the dark
Thousand lives on that side
In their hearts war leaves same mark
Fear and sadness to hide

Tomorrow we will turn the sky
In the horrid vault of hell
Like a wind of steel we'll fly
Sabre strikes hate's like a spell

Spur your horse towards the fire
In a challenge with the death
Shake the ground in a roar so dire
Glory sound, the thunder breath

[Chorus:]
Hussar de la mort, never wonder âwhy?â
Hussar de la mort, dark sister by your side

[Repeat chorus]
