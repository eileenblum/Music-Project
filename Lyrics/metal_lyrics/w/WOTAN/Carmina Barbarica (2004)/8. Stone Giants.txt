The stones rise in the foggy plain
Laid by giant hands
Gave us from a mysterious age
Silent witness of the ancient rites
Creatures of hell or mortal men
Who was the creator of this?
Whim of giants of human force
Only the ancestors know these secrets

[Chorus:]
Mighty stones for the gods
In a timeless place
Hymn of giants for the gods
Sanctuary of light

The stones are the dark message from the past
Laid by giant hands
The song of wind blows in the night
Voices in the dark

Sacrifice to the gods
Bloody cult in many tales
Holy place for many cults
It rose in the name of the bright god of light

[Repeat chorus]
