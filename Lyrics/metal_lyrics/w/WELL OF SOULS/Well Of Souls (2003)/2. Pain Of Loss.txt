Souls of the damned, relinquish this world,
My eyes divine, This soul's on fire,

Why can you not see
All, this pain, within me
Why can you not see
All, this pain within

Sadness has won, I just can't go on

Come with me or fall down trying
I alone am free of sin
Wicked are the ways of women
Tear you heart out from within

[CHORUS]
All this woe inside, I can't hide
These feeling they haunt me
What's to be, Is it my destiny
Can't you see, all this pain, inside of me

Darkness, comes into my mind..I can't go on
Acceptance, embrace the despair, I can't go on
I need your forgiveness, I just can't go on

Can you pleasem, Forgive me
Can you, please
Can you forgive me, can you, can you please

Can you please forgive me
Can you, please Can you ,please forgive me, can you, can you please...
