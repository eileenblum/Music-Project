Oh eternal Darkness covers the sky
Plead, they beseech unyielding eyes

Death can see, the funeral pyre, is burning bright upon the
Blackened sky
Fiery stallions carry spectral knights, enslaving all that dare to defy
They scoure the flaming villages on their quest to procure the
Dethroned King
Why doth they seek he.....it cannot be......

All can see the, pain and sorrow reigning from moonless sky
No hope or desire...Remains in their eyes
They see the pain and the sorrow reigning from a moonless sky
No hope or desire...Remains in their eyes

Sorcerer my name, Drowned by thee, inane
For ages I bide my time, But now vengeance is mine

And-With a gesture of his hand, before him their king did stand
Clenching-Fist deprives of air to breathe, And from his body
Life does leave

How can they go on.....When so forlorn.....

All can see the pain and sorrow reigning from moonless sky
No hope or desire.. Remains in their eyes
They see the pain and the sorrow reigning from a moonless sky
His wicked desire...Burns from hollow eyes

Tears of anguish
Streams from their eyes
Thoughts of vengeance awaken this night
To feel the sun
It burns thine eyes
No longer heeding the night
