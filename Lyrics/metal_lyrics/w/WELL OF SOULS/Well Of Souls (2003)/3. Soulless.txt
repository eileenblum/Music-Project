Can you see the soul inside of me, writhing in agony,
I could never see, Forever shall I be
Slave to Apollyon, I am his chosen one,
I could never see, Forever shall I be
Dwelling in shades below, drowning within the woe,
I begin to see, forever shall I...

The end ot time, ways heavy on my mind
The end of days, never becomes sublime

The noose circles my neck, a never ending trek
As darkness closes in, two apparitions appear within
For light and dark they stand, both claiming this soul at hand

Alone I stand, Grasping his hand
Follow me, alone never to be

Lost in this dream
Cry out
I can not choose the one
That is right for me
So much confusion
Then, theres a glow upon the angel of light
Then, I see the truth that the angel of light
Is really one of Godless minions

Can you see the soul inside of me, writhing in agony
I could never see, forever shall I be
Slave to Apollyon, I am his chosen one,
I could never see, forever shall I be
Dwelling in shades below, drowning within the woe, I begin to see
Forever shall I...
