Every time I hear your voice, it reminds me of the echoes. The torturous melodies a remittance to wake the dead. With the masses at the stare, I'm at a lost of words. Yet your full of despair, in the end I'll have my. In the end I'll have my revenge. I will have you in my hands. I will show the world, what I'm worth. Raising your head in victory. I wont be held down, I wont let you get the best of me. Serenade the queen, by suffocating her. She will be buried in the trenches.
