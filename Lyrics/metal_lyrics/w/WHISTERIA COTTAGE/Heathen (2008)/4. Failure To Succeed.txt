Our days are numbered in this day and age of destruction, where the weary and weak are slipping in a coma. The only safe haven in this world is our independence. Where we must look at ourselves in the mirror, to really see dominance in its final hour. We have a world full of options and we never take a second glance. We think this is such a sudden failure, did this come so abrupt? We will never see the day of light again, when we are shackled within ourselves. Choke the last witness that beholds the truth. Where do we look when we have lost all faith? Where do we look when we have lost the love to be happy within? Faced with the fact that the world is overgrown with malice. Where our economy is in a sudden downfall. There is no way to resurrect when we are flooded with anguish. When will there be a new day.
