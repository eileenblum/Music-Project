We are Born Into Sin.
But how do we crawl from a shallow grave,
Thrusted into a world of mindless slaves.
A consistent wave of debauchery.
Is this all society has come to be?
We are driven to extinction.
In a world of malice.
Incarcerated we are guilty of rape.
An aspiration of sexual desire.
We admire they confirm and conspire.
Is it the need to succeed or is it just greed.
You sell your morals short
Yet you will concede.
We live in a world of shame.
Where difference is considered treason.
I will never buy into this lie.
