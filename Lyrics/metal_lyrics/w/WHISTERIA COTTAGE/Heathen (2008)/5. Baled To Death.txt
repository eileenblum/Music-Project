Focus on the thought we wont survive when our freedom is contradicted. Even with the whips against our backs we will no longer be afraid. When your optimistic views are ravished maybe you will finally see your tyranny yet we will still have to face ourselves. Forever a fight of bitter ends. Where we feed the masses this lack of information. Where media fills our minds with temptation. This world drives me into asphyxiation. An injustice of actions demanded. We have to realize we must gather. In order to capture and devour. Never will we be the one's that are shackled down. We must break free of what, we once thought we were meant to be. Count the bodies as we destroy what they made us believe. I will hold my head high.
