What if the world was castrated and left with no dignity. Would we finally see everything we have taken for granted is no longer free. Why in the hell. Are we born to follow our idol's. We are baffled by the thought to be ourselves. But I am sick of seeing kids living in this addiction. How can I remain to see you the same. Our lives are ran by the thought of fear yet we will rise and persevere. But I still see this society come crashing down in shambles. Our way of life is meaningless of what you call this great vision. Do you turn a blind eye? Or do you consider everything you see a lie. We are born with misfortune in our veins, we are sickened with pain as you boast in vain. Infatuated with yourself your all the fucking same.
