Fear is a factor in the decision to bleed.
But don't you see its profaned creed.
Dressed up, to make you imagine you're set free.
Yet it's all wrong, We must look pass into the realization we're all trapped.
Some are so mindless. We build on others beliefs.
How can we be buying into this?
A society brought up on inculcation.
How can we, break free. It sickens me, the way we are brought into this life.
What we were once fed,was nothing more then avidity. Draining our life down to the bone.
We eat the bullshit from their hands, We crave every last drop.
Yet I'm worn out and distraught that this is what we are born into.
