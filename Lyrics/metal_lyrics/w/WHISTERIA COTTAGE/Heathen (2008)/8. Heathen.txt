Faced with a lifelong decision, that is a regiment of our disaster. We will shed your blood to excel ourselves to a higher power. I'm Looking behind the lines in a chase that is as distant as a god that walks the earth. Decimating the abundance of believer's that cant even begin to question. A Death? A simple opportunity for us to look back on a world that has crumbled so vastly. Where we can't even look in ourselves to continue we must rely on this faith I have lost. I will stand where my father once died, to see if he shall rise again.
