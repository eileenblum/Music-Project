Mental anguish is filled with fears of disapproval. 
Never was I accepted in your eyes.
With diminishing feelings of joy, you were never satisfied.
Always the cup close to your mouth, so we could never see you spill a drop.
Frightened with the thought of whether I would even awaken.
To dream reality, like an overdose waiting.
A full collapse.
To finally make something shine in your eyes.
A heartbeat ticks with timeless thoughts running around.
We crowd and begin to look down.
To see you embedded without a thorn crown. Are we disfigured in these eyes?
Are we the ones that create such stutter?
How do we awaken a beast, when all we have is one last wish?
Suffocating the last wishes and demands you could never let go.
I could finally overcome the atrocities that once held me back.
Staring into the eyes of the ones that beguiled me.
To rape and forget the ones you love, a life your too familiar with.
