Time to leave the dead behind 
Shed the weight suppressing me 
A dark beautiful, naked life at the edge of the sea 

Towards the sky I have been drawn 
But alone, too scared to fly 
Underneath her wings I was safe, 
Till the tears ran dry 

I've got a soul that she could not seem to reach 
She'll never know how I feel 
Brought down the wall, to her face I couldn't speak 
I'll never touch her that way again 

Cold up inside my body 
numb in my mind, somebody wake me make me 
Make me believe in love again 
Now that I'm free from the ice queen 

Her shoulder turned to let me fall 
The sirens wailed as she slid away 
In my head the demons came out to enjoy the day 

She's got a soul that I just can't seem to reach 
I'll never know how she feels 
Up in her castle with the Empire at her feet 
Shes rules her world, but not with me 

Cold up inside my body 
numb in my mind, somebody wake me make me 
Make me believe in love again 
Now that I'm free from the ice queen 

[Chorus]
