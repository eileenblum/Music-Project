Shot down in cold blood fever 
Spread the news as fast as you can 
Get it out to all the fine people 
They wanna know 
But they don't wanna understand 

Some kid, a little bit hyper 
Takes his medicine like a good boy 
Hard snap in his head one monday 
Spraying bullets with his new shiny metal toy 

Black Shadow Symphony 
Come whisper loudly in my ear 
With every little sound bite 
I'm more addicted to your fear 

Front page on every paper 
Television special report 
Soak it up like a sponge on steroids 
If it's bad, we only want to hear it more 

Hey you, the one in denial 
You can dream but you're never gonna sleep 
Take a hard look in the mirror 
Everyone of us is part of a disease yeah 

Black shadow symphony 
Come whisper loudly in my ear 
With every little sound bite 
I'm more addicted to your fear 

Everybody says put the kid in a jail for life 
Or better yet let the sucker fry 
He's an evil child 
Load 'em up and ship 'em off to another galaxy 
(there's) nothing wrong with our society 
The home of the well adjusted man 

[Solo-Chorus Out]
