Well it's a slow moving car baby 
Feels like I'm getting nowhere 
Got the top pulled down to catch the wind 
Blow the smell of you out of my hair
Well I've never been very stable 
Seems like wherever I am it won't be for long 
And I just don't know what I'm after anymore 
Cause what I thought I knew was right couldn't be more wrong 
You were a high wall to climb baby 
And I never quite got over you 
Yeah I knew all along I was slipping down 
From the bottom of your heart and into the deep blue 
Sometimes it's hard just to hold the wheel 
But I'm keeping my eyes on this road 
For my heart is a heavy load 
So I might just have to leave it with you
Everything that I want to do 
Comforts me tonight 
I been leaking my soul across your floor 
Sweeping my dreams away 
And even though I've been losing sleep 
I'm just keeping my eyes on this road 
For my heart is a heavy load 
Better know I'm gonna be alright 
Got a long way to go but I got a lot of long nights 
And everytime that I think of you, I'm gonna play my guitar 
And I'll sing a little happy tune 
Yeah my heart is a heavy load and that's why pretty girl I'm gonna leave it on your doorstep 
I don't need it where I'm gonna be, It's a big wide world and I'll get a new one for free......
