Once he loved her 
Once he could 
See her as a flower 
The days would rise 
And set in her eyes 
A sweetness he'd devour 
Slowly it took him over 
Seeds from the darkside 
Planted when just a boy 
Grew wild inside him now 
The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
Till beautiful means perfect in our minds 

Hated himself 
All his life 
Couldn't own his blessings 
Pushed aside every ray of light 
That photographed him shining 
Slowly he wanted more 
Than she could ever give 
With her he fantasized 
About a movie star 
The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
Till beautiful means perfect in our minds 

Slowly he went too far/ flame to the fire
His breath curling all the pages of a magazine 

[Chorus]
