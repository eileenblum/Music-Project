Well you know it's been awhile 
I keep letting go of things and people too 
Getting closer to the where 
But how and when I just don't know 
Till I get there 
Lately i really miss you 
Yeah I miss you all the time 
Feels like I should be with you 
But it's just my lonely mind 
Another sidewalk lies beneath me 
Glass and steel, places to go 
Still I'm not moving 
The city never sleeps and I'm tired 
Of keeping up with nothing to show 
Standing here in limbo 
Waiting for anything 
Can i really have control? 
Be the master of my destinations. 
It's just that when I start to fly
The stream of conciousness I indulge can stop me cold 
Lately I don't need a reason 
For the manic things I do 
I go off just to feel emotion 
Cause at least it's something new 
Another sidewalk lies beneath me 
Glass and steel, places to go 
Still I'm not moving 
The city never sleeps and I'm bored, 
Of playing games with people who cheat 
It's crazy here in limbo 
But I just can't seem to leave 
Everybody tells me what I'm doing wrong 
But I'm looking in the mirror 
They're the same as me, 
Not sad or happy 
Wanting somewhere to run too 
Well you know it's been awhile 
Letting go of things, 
And people too 
Lately i really miss you, 
Yeah i miss you all the time
