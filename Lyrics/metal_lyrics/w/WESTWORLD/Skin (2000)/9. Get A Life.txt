Is it right, the way we do each other? 
Talking cheap exploiting what's uncovered 
We're only human, you and I and the ones that we love 
If god is our witness then she'd say 
Why don't you get a life 
Get a life 
Why don't you get a life 
Get a life 
You think you know me, but I think you're on crack 
Since I met you, been pulling knives from my back 
We're in this together, you and I and the ones that we love 
If god is our witness then she'd say 
Why don't you get a life 
Get a life 
Why don't you get a life 
get a life 
We're only human, you and I and the ones that we love 
If god is our witness then she'd say 
Why don't you get a life 
Get a life 
Why don't you get a life 
Get a life
