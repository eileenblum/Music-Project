I don't feel the same today 
something turned around 
and I am different, 
everything has changed 
even pain has lost it's edge 
used to tie me up and hold me hostage 
but now I know it's game 
out from under me 
strange how beautiful 
this life has just become 
elastic I will be 
I'm blind and then I see 
it always comes to me 
when I can let it go 
been so long since i was here 
really in this place with you 
it feels good to know where I belong 
colors bursting at my eyes 
like a new born I'm infactuated 
I have to touch it all 
enter sanity 
open skies that never seem to ever end 
elastic I will be 
submerged and then I'm free 
it always comes to me 
when I can let it go 

[solo]

Out from under me 
strange how beautiful 
this world has just become 
elastic i will be 
I'm blind and then I see 
it always comes to me when 
I can let it go
