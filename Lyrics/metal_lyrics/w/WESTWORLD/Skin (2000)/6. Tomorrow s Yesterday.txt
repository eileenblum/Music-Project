Drowning in mindwaves 
Just below the surface of sane 
A star in a movie 
That plays over and over again 

Where did they go 
All of those dreams 
We had when we were young 
Wanted to be 
Something so pure 
They silenced the dreamer 

Got a lot of time 
And I'm here to stay 
In tommorow's yesterday 
And I feel alive 
In this moment I'm free 
The past is gone, and I'll never be..... 

Selling my soul out 
Spiritual prostitution you know 
The vulchers are waiting 
For any sign of weakness to show 

Why do we hear 
Only the lies 
That make us crumble 
They're too afraid to go that high 
And that's why they break us down 

Got a lot of time 
And I'm here to stay 
In tommorow's yesterday 
And I feel alive 
In this moment I am alive
The past is gone and I believe 

[Chorus]
