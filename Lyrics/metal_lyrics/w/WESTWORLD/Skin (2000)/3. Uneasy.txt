Holding my own, but sometimes 
I think I might break 
Fragile in one breath 
Then I'm strong and brave 

Still, like a dark chameleon 
Covered with time 
Wearing it well 
Though sometimes hard to find 

Blowing a storm through my world 
You change the way I feel 
Alter the light when you appear 

I don't know why you make me so uneasy 
When you're next to me 
Can it be you're the only one who can see me
So uneasy 
But I'll come around, just give me time 

Been on my own since I was 
Born don't you know 
People have come and gone,
Mostly they go 

So will you be here when I'm down 
Or leave to chase the sun 
I really do want to believe 

I don't know why you make me so uneasy 
When you're next to me 
Can it be you're the only one who can see me
So uneasy
But I'll come around, just give me time 

Blowin a storm through my world 
You change the way I feel 
Alter the light when you appear 
feed the atmosphere 
Leave the night unclear 

[Chorus]
