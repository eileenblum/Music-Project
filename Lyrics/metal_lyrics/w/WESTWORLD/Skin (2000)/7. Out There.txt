Acid mind trip on some enchanted blue star 
Heavenly bodies look closer than they are 
Some wasted bound to die person said 
You're living out of your element my boy don't you know 
Cinematic in ghostly angelic light 
Hypersensitive, to the words draped in white 
It's unbecoming to me now 
This acting so naive, when I'm old enough to know how 
There must be someone out there 
Behind the door to somewhere 
Waiting for me when I cross over 
There must be light at the end 
Sunsets on a warm horizon 
There must be someone out there for me 

I almost feel her hand on my face 
As I fall into this I release myself from the ground 

There must be someone out there 
Behind the door to somewhere 
Waiting for me when I cross over 
There must be light at the end 
Sunsets on a warm horizon 
There must be someone out there for me 

[Chorus]
