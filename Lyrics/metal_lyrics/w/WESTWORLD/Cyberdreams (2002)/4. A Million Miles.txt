Watch the sun go down
It's like a million miles
Like a million miles
Lies between us now
Like a million miles
Like a million miles

I wanted to know you, I did
I wanted to show you

This is not how it should be
This is not how it could be
This is not good enough for me

Cold enough to taste
Like a million miles
Like a million miles
God it's such a waste,
Such a waste of time my friend,
Goodbye...

I wanted to find you, I did
I wanted to feel you

This is not how it should be
This is not how it could be
This is not good enough for me
Something better's
Gonna to come of this
There's a lesson in here somewhere
Before you know it
We'll be yesterday
And yesterday's behind me
