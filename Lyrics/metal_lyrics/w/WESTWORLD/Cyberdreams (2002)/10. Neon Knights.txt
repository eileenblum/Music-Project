Oh no! Here it comes again
Can't remember when
We came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past
It always seems to come again
Again and again
Again and again, again oh

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us
From the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm
Sail across the sea of light

Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night
Holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell

Bloody angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows shining ever-bright

Neon Knight!
Neon Knights!
Alright!

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us
From the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm
Sail across the sea of light
Again and again
Again and again and again
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All night!
