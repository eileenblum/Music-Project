Try to breathe a deeper breath
You get choked up in your regret
It falls apart in your mind
You're stuck in what you've left Behind

On and on, the record's playing
Same old song
That you've been dancing to

It's easy to believe it
When nothing seems to change
And when you try to fake it
You lose yourself again
Lift your eyes and you might
Find the light of day
Just look to see,
It's gonna be alright

A photographic memory
She memorized the worst in me
Painted scars across my soul
Now they're pretty hard to show

And all we have
We have created
Good or bad
It's what we make it now

It's easy to believe it
When nothing seems to change
And when you try to fake it
You lose yourself again
Lift your eyes and you might
Find the light of day
Just look to see
It's gonna be alright

And all we have we have created
Good or bad
It's what we make it now

It's easy to believe it
When nothing seems to change
And when you try to fake it
You lose yourself again
Lift your eyes and you might
Find the light of day
Just look to see
It's gonna be alright
