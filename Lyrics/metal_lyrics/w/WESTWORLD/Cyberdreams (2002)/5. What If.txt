Can you open minds
Start revolutions,
Break new ground?
Can you change the world,
Do you believe in something profound?

Is it naive to visualize,
Utopia before our eyes?

What if we could turn the tide,
Flip the planet on its side,
Move a mountain if we tried
What if we could do
Whatever we believed,
What if we could?

Will you fight the power,
Look in the eyes
Of hate and suppression?
Will you stand-alone
For your convictions
And your obsessions?

Is it too much to ask for more,
Isn't that what we came for?

What if there was no disease,
No addictions, no enemies
What if everyone was free,
What if we could have
Whatever we believed
What if we could?

It's all a lie
The reasons why
It's do or die
This time

[Solo]
Is it naive to visualize,
Utopia before our eyes?

What if we could turn the tide,
Flip the planet on its side,
Move a mountain if we tried
What if we
Could do whatever we believed?
Oh yeah!
What if there was peace tonight,
Not a bomb within our sight,
Just a sea of candlelight
What if we could have
Whatever we believed,
What if we could?
