Looking for a light
Just a little sunshine for my soul
I'm sick of everything
And I don't want to die here
In this hole
Oh no

It's always give and take
Mend and break put out the fires
That's the way life is
We talk in dreams -
Are we just liars?
I don't want to say when I'm old
I never really tried

I could find another me
You could find another you
Turn this whole thing around
Have a different point of view
If they say it can't be done
They're just scared it might be true
It's just misery loves company
So I'm trying something new
(I've got better things to do)

Don't tell anyone
Keep it to yourself until it's real
And if they ask you why
Tell 'em that it's really no big deal

It's always win or lose
If you choose to be that shallow
That's the way it is
But they don't know
'cause they just follow
I don't want to say to my children
Daddy could have been....

I could find another me
You could find another you
Turn this whole thing around
Have a different point of view
If they say it can't be done
They're just scared it might be true
It's just misery loves company
So I'm trying something new

Well you gotta believe it
Before you can see it
And if you can't even dream it
Then you'll never unleash it
And if you say it, better mean it
If you really wanna be it
Yeah you you gotta believe it
Oh before you can see it

It's always win or lose
If you choose to be that shallow
That's the way it is
But they don't know
'cause they just follow
I don't want to say to my children
You know Daddy could have been....

I could find another me
You could find another you
Turn this whole thing around
Have a different point of view
If they say it can't be done
They're just scared it might be true
It's just misery loves company
So I'm trying something new
