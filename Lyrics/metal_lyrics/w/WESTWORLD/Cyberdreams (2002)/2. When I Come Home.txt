Don't make me feel
It's better when I'm numb
Don't make me reach
I don't need anyone
Don't make me look
It's just too glorious
Don't make me try
It's too laborious
I'm not ready though I'm falling down
I don't want to be found

I can almost hear the sound
Of my ego dying
I just realized my fate
Now there's no more hiding
Looking out from where I stand
On the edge of where I'll be
When I come home

Don't let me dream
I'm not supposed to fly
Don't let me know
I might just question why
Don't give me faith
I'll find my own way
Don't tell me how
I'll get there someday

Everybody's got something to say
Wish they'd all go away

I can almost hear the sound
Of my ego dying
I just realized my fate
Now there's no more hiding
Looking out from where I stand
On the edge of where I'll be
When I come home

[solo]

I can almost hear the sound
Of my reasons dying
I just realized my fate
Now there's no more fighting
Looking out from where I stand
On the edge of where I'll be
When I come home
When I come home
When I come home
When I come home
