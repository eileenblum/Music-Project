Woke up in an timeless space
A star I had become
She was watching from above
Her eyes were like the sun

I was in an orbit she controlled,
I could feel her, I couldn't touch her
Something strange was happening
As I began to rise

And I rise
And everything is love
And love is everything

In a simulated night
I feel my body sleeping
And somehow she controls my mind
But only when I'm dreaming

I am only what she thinks I am
A Perfect soldier, cyberdreamer
All the fear just falls away
As I begin to rise

And I rise
Everything is love
And love is everything
And we rise
And we rise
And everything is love
And love is everything

Take your soul from this place and go free. Free of fear and anger, hatred and pain.
I have seen what you have seen through your eyes. I have run through your fields, lived
through your life and dreamed through your dreams. We are one, we are love, we are everything.

And I rise
Everything is love and love is everything
And we rise
And we rise
And everything is love
And love is everything
