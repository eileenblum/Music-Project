I'm on a trip
Across the universe tonight
Are you with me?
Yeah cause I won't be
Going back there anytime
Nothing for me
I'm a shooting star
That's never burning out it's flame
And I am so alive
I'm never gonna be the same
And like a superhero
I can do anything that I want

Yeah this is how good it feels
To love you
Oh better than anything before you
Yeah this is how good it feels
To love you everyday

High on a psychedelic wave
And I'm not scared
Are you with me?
Yeah it's a mystical adventure
We can share
If you trust me
I am nothing but a servant
To this thing inside me
All the bad things in my life
Have fallen down behind me
There is no one in this world
Could ever knock me out like this

Yeah this is how good it feels
To love you
So good that I can hardly wait
To show you
Yeah this is how good it feels
To love you everyday

[solo]
I'm a shooting star
That's never burning out it's flame
And I am so alive
I'm never gonna be the same and
I'm a superhero
I can do anything that I want

Yeah this is how good it feels
To love you
Oh better than anything before you
Yeah this is how good it feels
To love you (yeah)
So good that I can hardly wait
To show you (yeah)
Yeah this is how good it feels
Yeah this is how good it feels
Yeah this is how good it feels
To love you everyday
