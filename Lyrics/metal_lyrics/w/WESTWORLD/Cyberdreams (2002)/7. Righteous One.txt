You say I never give what you need
Stop lying
God knows
There's something your hiding from me
I'm fighting
Back in the daylight again
Feels good
Trying to start from the end
So good
Look in the mirror
Is anything clearer to you my dear?

You gotta be right
I'm gonna be real
You better get ready
For what you might feel
Why don't you come clean?
Would that be too much for you
Righteous one?

One day your gonna be all alone
Nobody
But I know you'll still be guarding your throne
Too funny
What will you do when I'm gone?
Lose it
Guess you'll believe that I'm wrong
Prove it
I hope someday you might wake up
And see what you've done

You gotta be right
I'm gonna be real
You better get ready
For what you might feel
Why don't you come clean?
Would that be too much for you
Righteous one?
I used to get high
And you were naive
But you were high too
From watching me bleed
Why don't you come clean?
Would that be too much for you
Righteous one?
Back in the daylight again
You lost your power
The end
