I'm all lost I'm out of reach
Somewhere in my head
Burning bridges, slamming doors
Sometimes I wish I were dead

Can't run
From the things that I can't hide
No way I can ever lose this fight
I'm exposed
Underneath the burning sun
From myself I can't run

There's one truth that I can see
Mirrors all around
Faces that reflect on me
By spirit we are bound

Can't run
From the things that I can't hide
No way I can ever lose this fight
I'm exposed
Underneath the burning sun
From myself I can't run

I'm not alone in this dirty world
But sometimes it feels so damn cold
And when I get down I just run away
It's the only thing I know

[solo]

Can't run
From the things that I can't hide
No way I can ever lose this fight
I'm exposed
Underneath the burning sun
From myself I can't run

Can't run
From the things that I can't hide
No way I can ever lose this fight
So exposed
Underneath the burning sun
From myself I can't run
