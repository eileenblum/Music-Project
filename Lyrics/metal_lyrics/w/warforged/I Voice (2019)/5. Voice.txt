...blurry faced thing staggered out from the trees. It walked through the mud and muck right past me. It leaned its wet skin against the decaying bark. I tried to scream, can't you hear me calling from the dark?
Standing right there â it was standing right there (in the rancid mist). Staring at me â it was staring right past me. A grimace behind the blur crumbled into deep rooted dread as the paralyzation forced me to close my eyes. The hag, again...
Body, breath, throat, skin, drift, drown, writhing, water, don't leave me... please don't leave me here...
...here, writhing, drift, skin, face...
...earth swallowed my memoriesâ¦ the swamp...
It was poisonedâ¦ it was blindâ¦
