The world turned on its side as I emerged from behind the cellar doors. Gold light eroded to a cool groan â radiance replaced by the fireflies' glow as the sun hid behind the trees.

Nightfall came againâ¦ And againâ¦

Radiance emerged from the cottage window. I hid, this time, in fear of the light. Familiar warmth, familiar fear. As I tucked myself away, a shadow lurked behind the frame. It stepped through the doorway. I stepped out of my skin.

Skin, woman, deeper into the treesâ¦ further away from meâ¦ The trees grew closer and the fireflies gathered around as I grew closer to her.

A pace turned to run, the trees into vines, and as I reached, she trembled, she melted.

I saw a face, "Hey!" Familiar warmth, familiar fear... "Hey!" I saw a shriveled, contorted phantom in the mist staring back at me.

The world began to shake. I saw a strange, hideous face in the dark. I can't move my arms. I can't feel my legs. Fear. Only fear. Brother. Still here.

Nightfall came againâ¦And againâ¦

Ghost, essence, hag, body
