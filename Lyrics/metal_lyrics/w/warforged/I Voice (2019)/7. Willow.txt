Echo of an illusion, what I lived for days I had lived for none...blurry faced thing slumped over a fallen willow tree.

Forgotten friend witheringâ¦ I touched its deflated skin - wrinkled from the water.

The sun advanced to the horizon and its radiance replaced by nightfallâs glowâ¦

[Solo: Peters]
Vines, young seedlings grew old, turned to seed, and againâ¦ and againâ¦

Time tore by, and the sun and moon danced around the world. Hope an intense blur, the body swallowed by greenery.

[Solo: Kiburz]

Forgotten friend begotten: birthed of a disturbance in time &amp; flourishing rot - flourishing in rot, swallowed by rot. The constellations bellowed, my sorrow drowned by their laughter.
