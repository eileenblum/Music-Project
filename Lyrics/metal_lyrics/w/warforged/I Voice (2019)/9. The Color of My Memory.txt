I crumbled the world with my fingertips. The cave collapsed and the cellar caved in. The cottage gave way and the pond spiraled into emptiness. I shattered the world with my fingertips. And with the remaining pieces was a vague, foggy abyss once more.

[Solo: Kiburz]

I pulled my creeping hand from his mind and into the darkness I stepped back, I vanished.

It's time to leave the land from which I grew.

I let you go.

It's time to leave the land from which I knew.

I'll let you go.
