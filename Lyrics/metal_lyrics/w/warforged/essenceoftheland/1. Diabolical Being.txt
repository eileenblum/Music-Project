A slight misstep
And Kaura fell of the edge
And into
The swamp waters below
What could I do? Depart and get help
"Just hold on"
The only words of comfort I could muster...
Tearing through the thick and winding muck
I escaped the marsh and made it to my Father's home
Every night the fireflies' dance spoke for the essence of the land
