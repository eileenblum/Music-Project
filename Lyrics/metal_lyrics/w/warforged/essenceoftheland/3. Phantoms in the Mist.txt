A voice rang around me, gurgled
"Have you returned so late to deliver me"
From this dreary shelter of poison and murder

I held on to the creeping vines
With the bit of strength I could still muster
And as you fell from sight the stabbing pain of
Isolation began to set in
Sensing my struggle the roots tightened their grip and pulled me under
And even through the muck
I could still hear the earth's shrill shriek
It's grip tightened the swamp waters pulled the air out of me
Poisoned and blind, the swamp acted
And tightly hid my body to decay its dark tainted heart
Brother I am still here
In isolation I was murdered

The shrieks ceased and
Through the rancid mist
I could barely make out a cavity in the mud
His body was gone
Silence
I was alone again
Alone with my thoughts
I am alone again

Was any of this even real?
Or just phantoms in the mist?
I'm still here waiting still here...
Waiting...
