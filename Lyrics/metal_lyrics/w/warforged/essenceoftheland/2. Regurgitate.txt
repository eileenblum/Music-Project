Their glow casts shadows
And their shadows told tails of pain and isolation
When just down the road came a shrill shriek
A flurry of green light
And they vanished but through my window
Came a groan. A whisper...
Calling me to return
Holding my oar tightly
I pulled myself deeper...
Deeper into the heavy coat of mist and...
Night fall came
And the taunting glow of fireflies
Was the only
Apparent trace of life I could see
Sunset and sunset again
The murky murmur
Of scurrying swamp things
Gurgled and beckoned me.
Dizziness, discomfort, and nausea
The guilt was overwhelming
The sense of isolation
Began to set in
The thought of finding a
Bacteria eaten
Water rotted corpse

Brother are you here, hiding
In the mist
Hiding in fear

Regurgitate
Release

Nightfall came
And the haunting glow of fireflies
Revealed
A boiling pool of muck in the mist
The insects drew closer
The trees began to shriek
I held my lantern out to see through the mist
He bubbled up to the surface
The cloud of insects grew
Spewing forth mud and mangled by the swamp
