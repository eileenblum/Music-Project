Concealed by stone and ash the last known remnant of our champions, now exposed
Through activation, it's corners rupture; and released: a shrill howl

The flurry of light, the whirlwind of panic: vanished before me
Towering, beckoning, the apparitions' image clouded by mutilation

Crawling, hounded by prolonged torture and misery
The tainted throne commands the undead
Stained with insurmountable evil
His necromastery consumes our might and fortitude

Trapped in an endless chasm,
Our powers torn away
Oh, slaves to madness
We accept our fate, order is restored
But now we leave this mortal plane

Convulsing and churning in his grip, the powers that be assemble us to carry out their commands

Compelled to vanquish, to eradicate
We slowly advance to the hidden fortress
Stricken, and exhausted, with his last shred of power
Our triumph, our world distorted by necromastery

Now back in the physical realm, we can no longer continue to exist
Wither away wither...
In one last whimper our champions ceased existence, but left behind
A storm of malice now more powerful than ever

Terror shatters my perception of reality, somatic torment
Convulsing and churning I submit, my body now a servant to malevolence
