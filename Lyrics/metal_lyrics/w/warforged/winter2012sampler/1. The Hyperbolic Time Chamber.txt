Eras of deception, the errors of their celestial design, nearly discovered and exploited to secure our dominance
As time presses on, panicked, and under surveillance, we cannot let our fate slip into the hands of the gods

Our mortal enemies have caught sight of our plan
Seized and cast into imprisonment

Drifting through consciousness, in Spartan confinement I uncover a shrine to the father of gods and men
Inching closer, a hidden mechanism is triggered, propelling me into the heavens

Lurking in the frosted heights I continue to grow nearer to their Ichor
Adapting my virus accordingly I will not let our fate slip into the hands of the gods

Hidden, I find a point of injection to disgrace their "immortal" name.
Introducing the virus he spews and belches gold blood as heaven collapses on itself

Descending into the mortal realm
Disoriented, our threat erodes
Murdering the gods, leaving humanity in control
The heirs of prayer become myth
