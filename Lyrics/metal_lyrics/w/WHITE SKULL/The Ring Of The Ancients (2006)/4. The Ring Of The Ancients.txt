Lost in a middle of the forest painted black
Hundred knights praying bres
Can you hear their singing voices
Ascending to the moon
Here's the gates of Annwn

Lifeless my limbs torpid my tongue

In purple robe sits a warrior old
Telling stories of dead comrade bold
Their bodies fell as their spirit rose
To the home of the heroes Herjan's hall

Mystic riddles, symbols of the stones
See the ancient rites, never known before
Revelation, come black sun
Burning inner fire, never felt before

Oh when time has come, rise your fist
Feel the power that comesfrom the past

Ring of the ancients calling
Deep down inside my heart
Ring of the ancients calling
Proud warrior never die

Creep iron serpent, come almighty bress
Sacred pictures drawn of wood
Shadows dancing around almighty stones
Marching skeletons on battlefields
