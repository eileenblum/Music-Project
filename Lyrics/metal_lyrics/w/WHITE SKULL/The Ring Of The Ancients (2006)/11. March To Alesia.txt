Roman legions marching on
Hills are burning
Tribes divided, cowardry

Warriors strength warriors faith
Are lost, desperate fightings
Once united, now divided
People is dying
Run like ghosts in the middle of the night
To save our children

Cesar's glory, Casar's lust
We're gonna take it

Marching marching marching to Alesia
Hundred legions wait around the walls
Marching marching marching to Alesia
Rising power of the mighty Rome

The chieves are blind for power
The druids have lost the way
And Cesar waits
The tribes will fight each other
The brothers fight each other
Like a civil war
One by one the tribes are falling down
The march of roman army

Merciless Cesar's game
Legions are moving
The last chieves will be put in chains
Vercingetorix
