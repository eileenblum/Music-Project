Fight for the glory, defend your land
The day of the battle has come
Axes and swords hear the clang of the shields
The fields like a pool of blood

On the hills burning fires
On the fields blood and steel

Legions of Romans encircle our men
Celtic will break the lines
The second assault is rejected with strength
Withdrawal for Cesar's men

After the battle the haul of war
After the battle we drink a lot
Drinking on and on

Celebrate the victory with sweet hydromel
Warriors and women are drunk
One of the chieves steals half of the haul
But the second one rises his sword

... who fucks with the haul?!?

The drunken chieves fight for the haul
Now tribes divided... will fall...
