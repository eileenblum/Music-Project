Rising powers black in the way
In the forest spirits are dancing
Dancing on and on

Forgotten legends hidden secrets
The book of shadows open wide
The fields are burning, children crying
It's just a vision of coming times

Secret rites, pagan knives
Seven nights before the blood red moon

Guardians protecting the faith
Guardians defending the light
Guardians keepers of solstice
Guardians power that comes from the sky

Black wings of death coming through the trees
The wind is frozen and the eyes are weeping
A darkened scent of fallen leaves
The end is coming the end is near

In to the night on the fairy hill
Spirits are calling
In to the night on the fairy hill
Future is now revealed

Lost in time the knowledge supreme
Druids are falling down in misery
