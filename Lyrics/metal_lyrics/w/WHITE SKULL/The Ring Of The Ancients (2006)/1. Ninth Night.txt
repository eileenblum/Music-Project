The winds blows through the forest
In an iced winter night
Frozen trees like spectres in the dark
The old man stand in circle
Silence all around
Hands to the sky
The gate of power is open wide

Magic knowledge, dancing fires
Ninth night, this is the ninth night
Can't stop the mystic visions, secret voices
Dana's between the fires
Dana's between the fires

Fires burn in the forest
Fires burn in the night

Hands draw secret symbols
In the wind, in the air
Frost and flames on the sacred soil
Mortal sight is faded, unveiling the world
Second sight is rising the future is now revealed

Magic knowledge, dancing fires
Ninth night, this is the ninth night
Can't stop the mystic visions, secret voices
Magic knowledge, secret fires
Inner power flowing on and on
