Can you hear the voice of the silent trees
Of the mystic river that flows inside you?

When the rain fall on the wall
And your heart is full of sadness
When you feel the chains of hecate the queen
Darkned visions will come

Ogam gives you strength
Mystic writings on the stones
Ogam sacred signs
Find the way to eternity

Blood! No one can save you
A sentence of death, paralyze your mind
Silent moor behind your eyes
Prey the ancient monoliths

Ogam gives you strength
Mystic writings on the stones
Ogam sacred signs
Find the way to eternity

When the evil tricks with serpent's kiss
And your soul bleed for sorrow
When the endless night makes you blind
An inner light you can find

Ogam gives you strength
Mystic writings on the stones
Ogam sacred signs
Find the way to eternity
