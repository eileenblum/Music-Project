Find the path of immortal sun
Hear the call of the morrigans
Walk among the ancient trees
Feel the power from within
Way of the warrior
Death is singing on the hills
Braves don't fall

Head hunters
Skulls on their belts
Head hunters
Looking for prey
Head hunters
Lost in the dark
Crimson stars burn on a deadly sky

Torches lighten mighty stones
Sacred rites cobald blades
Iron, velvet taste of blood
Dreadful masks beneath the hood
Frozen tears
Crumbling on the ring of steel
Echoes of drums

Flowing fear inside your veins
End is coming end is near
Heavy steps surrounding you
They look for prey, the prey is you
Lost in the forest
Death is calling, death is real
Falling down
