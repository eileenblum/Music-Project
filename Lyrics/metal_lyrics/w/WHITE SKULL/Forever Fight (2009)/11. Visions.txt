In the land of dreams he tried to be pure
But visions and nightmares were raping his mind

When he was a little child nothing seemed to be so cruel
But life can be a killer of feelings and dreams

Visions steal him in the darkness
Once he tried to be a man
But he fell into a black maze
And started wanting more and more

Dead men walking before his blinded eyes
His army goes on and his warriors move on

His lust was stronger than all and
No one survived to his arch but
Legions of dead men will come for his soul
