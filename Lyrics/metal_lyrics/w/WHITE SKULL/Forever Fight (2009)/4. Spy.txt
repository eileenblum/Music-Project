War can even make you lose your pride and control
It happens when surviving's your primal goal
There was a clever woman, proud to be free
That was a time too wrong for peace

She left her man but she liked love
So she became an exotic dancer to live
She dominated leaders and kings

Reality and fiction mixed up and then
She played parts and she had no scruples
She went too far and finally she was processed
Erotic games are dangerous, she was arrested!

Executed as a spy
Staring proud at warriors
Pointing at her
Ice in her eyes, never trembling
You will never kill
My courage

What the hell is going on, they're pointing at me
But I'm a mistress and soon they will see
That all I want is to break all their plans
And all the gold will fall in my hands

Dangerous seductress
Spy or just a dancer?
She had to meet her fate
And no one would claim her body
