In the ancient times a king was falling down
His queen rose up to power with honour
Boudicca her name, a striking looking woman
The stare of eyes most fierce, she was a terrifying queen.

Alliance betrayed by the avidity of Rome
Lands and treasures were plundered with contempt and greed
They couldn't know her courage, warrior queen of Celts
They really shouldn't face her, Boudicca will avenge!

So start the fire!
The flames get higher
She was ruler and
War leader of the Celts rebellion
Start the fire!
The flames get higher
A mother's revenge
Give no quarter, warrior queen!

Then Romans came, no pity and no respect
Boudicca was flogged and her daughters were raped
So it was clear, it was time for revenge
She led people in revolt and they slaughtered all Romans

She took no prisoners, she wanted to kill them all in flames
She was a woman fighting for her honour and her pride
They couldn't know her courage, warrior queen of Celts
They really shouldn't face her, Boudicca will avenge!
