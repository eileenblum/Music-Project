Coming from the north
They break into the south
The Roman empire will fall!
Riding like hell
They want to raze
Raiding through lands and through sea

Vandals are coming
And they spare nobody
Like fury of the Gods
Pirates came from hell
Demons without reason
This time we're gonna fall!

"Save your breath, my warriors
Spare yourself to pillage
Hope and pray to survive
Follow me, we will raid
Save your breath, my warriors
Spare yourself to pillage
Tonight we're leaving
And let the invasion start!"

Fight, fight, fight - forever fight!
Fight, fight, fight - never ending fight!

The leader of the tribe
Is talking with no sense
So will we ever survive?
Riding like hell
They want to raze
And we are more weak every day
