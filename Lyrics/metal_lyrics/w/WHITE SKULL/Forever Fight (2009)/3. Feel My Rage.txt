When the enemies came I was a little boy
I couldn't understand why
My village was destroyed
My father killed, my mother raped and slaughtered
My people died in flames
What will become of me now?

Feel my rage now
It's gliding on me
It shakes my feelings
Slowly sucking all my power
My angry tears and my loneliness will break
The walls of my oppression
The walls of desperation
Oh revenge make me strong, now!

Your eyes on me, they start judging
You'll never know why I'm killing
I will avenge I will destroy
Enemies fall under my sword under my hate!

I have grown alone with my thoughts of death
My body much too strong
My mind was filled with anger
Now I've avenged my people killing their enemies
I've reached my final aim
Now I can even die!

There are feelings deep inside my soul
I've never shown them, never spoken...
My eyes burning, my heart broken
I'll never understand the slaughter
Wonder why I survived that night
