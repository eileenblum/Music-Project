Warriors fight for me another time, maybe the last
Rise again and fight for honour as much as victory
Roman lust has gone so far
Nor even age or purity are left unpolluted
But heaven's on the side of a just revenge

Our legion which dared to fight has died
And the rest are hiding themselves
In their camp to survive
In this battle you will conquer or will die
You can reach your freedom or you'll all be slaves

End of all, Boudicca was defeated by a Roman army
And most were killed
But she chose honour instead of shame
And poison flowed in her veins...
