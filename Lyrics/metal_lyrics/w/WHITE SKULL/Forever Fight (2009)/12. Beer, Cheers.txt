[Bonus track]

Watching the fields, all the flowers and colors
Come, take the tables, put the benches on the grass
Battle has gone and we'll celebrate the victory
Fighting is over, now it's time to have some fun!

Take my hand and we'll dance around the tables
Prepare the banquet, don't forget something to drink

Beer! Beer!
Give me one more beer
Cheers! Cheers!
Raise the tankards filled
Give me one more beer
And we'll dance until the end
Raise the tankards filled
All the enemies have died!

Sun's coming down slowly on the fields and hills
Women and men with red cheeks start to fall
We've deserved the banquet to forget the battle's pain
Now the night is coming and we're falling into sleep
