Brothers and sons, come and listen to me
This is the night of rising steel
We shall unite and together we'll fight
Proud to defend our wives and rights!

The future is coming, the time's close to an end
Your armours will shine, we'll fight for revenge!
Rise, brothers and sons, come and listen to me
This is the night of shining steel!

Heavy Metal Axes
Shining in the night
Heavy Metal Axes
Enemies will die

Shouts, cries, sprinklings of blood
Axes, swords will rise to kill
Fight, brothers and sons, don't be scared, rise your head
This is the night you won't feel no fear!

Heavy Metal Axes
Shining in the night
Heavy Metal Axes
Enemies will die
Heavy Metal Axes
Fire in the sky
Heavy Metal Axes
Time to kill and die!

Rest in peace, rest in peace and lay down here, son
You've not died in vain, the Gods will shield you
Rest in peace and your honour will survive
And we'll pray, and we'll pray for your soul

Heavy! Metal!!
