Running through fields
And the enemies follow, don't want to die.
My breath is broken
But desperation will save me!

I WISH the moon wasn't full tonight
But the light is bright.
Enemies calling, enemies run
I want to survive!

Falling down, falling down
My life before my eyes
I go down, I go down
Oh God please save my soul
Falling down, falling down
My life fading away
But my fate will not come tonight!

My wish to live is too strong
All my desires
Give me the power to run far away.
They will not come
They won't get me
Forest I pray you, hide my body and soul

I am the only survivor tonight
All the rest have died.
I heard the cries
And saw the village completely blazed!
