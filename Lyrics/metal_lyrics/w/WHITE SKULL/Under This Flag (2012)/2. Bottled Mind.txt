What
What Is This I See
A Mirror of Me
Heading Out the Gate, Each Day
A Smile, to Me

Canât You Hear Me Struggling â Fighting Within

The Smile I Wear Is Fading
With All the Thoughts Iâm Weighing
No One Can Help Me Now
They Try But They Will Fail
They Look at Me with Sorrow
They Lead but I Wonât Follow
They Look but They Wonât Find
Till They Open Up Their Bottled Minds

One, One Man Falls
Youâre Still Standing
Blinding Light Right in Your Head
No Oneâs Believing

Canât You Hear Me Struggling â Fighting Within

The Smile I Wear Is Fading
With All the Thoughts Iâm Weighing
No One Can Help Me Now
They Try But They Will Fail
They Look at Me with Sorrow
They Lead but I Wonât Follow
They Look but They Wonât Find
Till They Open Up Their Bottled Minds
