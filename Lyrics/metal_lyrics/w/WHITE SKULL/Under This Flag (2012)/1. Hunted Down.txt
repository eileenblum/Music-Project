Running from Mass Deportation
Caring for My Own Salvation
This Is All Too Real â Waiting on My Kill
Rumors Lead the Way That Iâll Be Taking
We Must Flee from Here

Silence â Greetings â Hidings â Sit Ins
They Care What Clan You Belong

Where Do We Go â Hide and Seek
Will You Go Away with Me Now
Starving Changes Me, Hit by Disease
Will You, Will You Be Coming

Darkness, Cover, Cruel Starvation
Try to Save Whatâs Left of My Nation
Weak Gets Left Behind
Waiting Just to Die

Silence â Greetings â Hidings â Sit Ins
They Care What Clan You Belong

Where Do We Go â Hide and Seek
Will You Go Away with Me Now
Starving Changes Me, Hit by Disease
Will You, Will You Be Coming

Hunted Down Like Dogs They Call Us
Night Assault Bestowed Upon Us
You Wonât See My Fear, Bitter Struggle Here
Waiting for Our Time, No Hesitation
Soothing of Life Is So Near

Silence â Greetings â Hidings â Sit Ins
They Care What Clan You Belong

Where Do We Go â Hide and Seek
Will You Go Away with Me Now
Starving Changes Me, Hit by Disease
Will You, Will You Be Coming
Where Do We Go â Hide and Seek, Will You Be Coming
Where Do We Go â Will You Be Coming
