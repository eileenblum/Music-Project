Seems to me, as the night comes
Packed and ready to go
Lying here, angel beside me
Listening to all of my fears
So afraid, this night
Wondering if my prayers are raising
On high, vicious way
To leave the one close and near

My, my angel of death
Angel of death come to me
No one can save me by now, oh angel

The voices are out, the danger is here
Nobody's safe, hell is right here
Waiting for days, days upon end
Wanting it over but it's just begin
I gave it all up
So you have your dreams
I gave up my life
You know what that means
Hatred that builds, inside of my head
Now I must ask

Why, my angel of death
Angel of death come to me
No one can save me by now

My, my angel of death
Angel of death come to me
No one can save me by now, oh angel
