Another night to myself without
Your wishes to me
I will now admit it's over me
As I say to myself I got to wade
Thru this storm
I know it's so crazy to believe

You walk alone in the shadows
You hide
I dream of you lying here by my side
We are apart that we have to abide

Another day to myself
Without your touch
So comforting
I will now just walk away
From here
Counting down the steps
To walk outside
This burning hell
The silence is now getting to me

Singing for my soldier
Lost or killed
Singing for the words that never
Were meant to hear
Begging for the sound, the touch, the feel
Singing forâ¦ I am so lost alone

Another day to myself
Without your touch
So comforting
I will now just walk away
From here
Counting down the steps
To walk outside
This burning hell
The silence is now getting to me

Singing for my soldier
Lost or killed
Singing for the words that never
Were meant to hear
Begging for the sound, the touch, the feel
Singing forâ¦ I am so lost alone

Singing for my soldier
Lost or killed
Singing forâ¦ I am so lost alone
