Look at you so high with power - insane
Everything you take is so in vane - you choose
Look at you
Ruling lives without shame
We live in hell under your name - you choose

Seek for you story
Create your own glory
Stand for your future -
Glory, fury

We won't stand for
The violence and mistrust
Never shed one single tear for us -
You choose
Do what you want
We have nothing to lose
You'll rule the day

For every year of abuse -
You choose

Seek for you story
Create your own glory
Stand for your future -
Glory, fury

You never cried for me
You never bleed
Never gave a damn for me
Now you must die
You never cried for me
You never bleed
Dictator obeys no rule
Who will now die
