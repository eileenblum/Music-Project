What you wish tonight
Holding all the stars
Let go all your fears

What you wish tonight
Will be granted
Holding all the stars
We're coming
Let go all tour fears
They're faded
All the wasted tears
We're coming

Unto you the night is coming clear
With vengeance
Unto you your night will come

Under this flag
White skull will stand
A nation that was to be heard
Under this flag
White skull will stand
Fight for your right to be heard

All you here tonight, this meeting
Strength will rule the night
You hear me
The rush you feel is right
Believe me
For all of this we fight
It's all too real

Shouting thru, shouting thru
You'll follow white skull too

Under this flag
White skull will stand
A nation that was to be heard
Under this flag
White skull will stand
Fight for tour right to be heard

Unto you the night is coming clear
With vengeance
Unto you your night will come

Under this flag,
White skull will stand
A nation that was to be heard
Under this flag, white skull will stand
Fight for tour right to be heard
