Running to save our lives
We will be
Running to save our lives
All of us must unite
Ready to see the light
We are now, ready
To see the light
Scarred with war atrocities

What can I dream of
From now on
The horizon is so far
From me
Dreaming
The horizon
Yeah me
I want to be gone

Save the prisoners of war
No one is keeping score
Prisoners of war
For whom they're fighting for
Prisoners of war
It 's more than lost in action

Ready for this night
Are you now
Ready for this night
Bombs will fall
We must flee
Waiting to see the sign
Hope gets high
Waiting to see the sign
I'll turn around
My destiny

What can I dream of
From now on
The horizon is so far
From me
Dreaming
The horizon
Yeah me
I want to be gone

Save the prisoners of war
No one is keeping score
Prisoners of war
For whom they're fighting for
Prisoners of war
It 's more than lost in action

What can I dream of
From now on
The horizon is so far
From me
Dreaming
The horizon
Yeah me
I want to be gone

Save the prisoners of war
No one is keeping score
Prisoners of war
For whom they're fighting for
Prisoners of war
There's more martyrs

Save the prisoners of war
No one is keeping score
Prisoners of war
For whom they're fighting for
Prisoners of war
It's more than lost in action
