Freedom is not free
Hundred souls
Sounds like a toll to me
Whispers of death
This I heard in the final take

Freedoms not free, will you see it
Eyes of the angels never saw
This cruel world we got into

Shut, you got to see
You want them with no sorry feels
Rulers want dominion
And crave for damnation

Freedoms not free, will you see it
Lies that trigger
The final sacrifice
For the greater good

Souls are lost
How much do you want
Souls are lost
For freedom
Called to serve
How many get killed
Called to serve
For freedom
