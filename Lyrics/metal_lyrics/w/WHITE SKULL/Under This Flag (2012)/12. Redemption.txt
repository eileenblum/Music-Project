There's a breach in their mind
Tonight
Feeling the frightened thoughts
Up high
Breaking into
The early morn of day
Willing to fight
You'll be there

I feel seizures -
Lives are threatened
Well being your time has come
Master they loathe
Master they mind
My stare divine

Redemption
Now you will be crying
Now, the battle's begun
Shoot me now
That we're face to face
Leading to misery -
Death is coming
Clash so loud
Like thunder in a rage
Round for round the blood
Will stain the day
One in all they start
To fall its clear
I can almost feel
The victory is near

I feel seizures -
Lives are threatened
Well being your time has come
Master they loathe
Master they mind
Mt stare divine

Redemption
Now you will be crying
Now, the battle's begun
Shoot me now
These the words I say
Look what I have
Become - 
Death I'm wanting

Death - come to me -
Shut up

I feel seizures -
Lives are
Threatened
Well being your time
Has come
Master they loathe
Master they mind
My stare divine

Redemption
Now you will be crying
Now, the battle's begun
Shoot me now
That we're face to face
Leading to misery - 
Death is coming

We fought for long years
To end what we began
So much was lost
Lives taken and now
It is silence
