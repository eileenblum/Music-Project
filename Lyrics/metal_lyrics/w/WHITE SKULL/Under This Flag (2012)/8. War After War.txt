War after war, I can now see
Secrets and games, deceiving
Fear of the dark
Who wants to play
Winning for me or my country

They lived in the fear of the year
With the conquerors sole domain
Lives so demeaning all screaming
For meaning the world in chains

See the fighting
Over and over again
See us dying war after war
With no end

Building hopes and better future
Only lies it's all deception
There's no end
This war stops another starts
This world is full
Of bleeding hearts
Minds with one function
Only destruction

It's the same line over time
It's all mine
They're so blind to see
Power and greed all they see
Make believe and justify
The means
See the fighting
Over and over again
See us dying war after war
With no end

Building hopes and better future
Only lies it's all deception
There's no end
This war stops another starts
This world is full
Of bleeding hearts
Minds with one function
Only destruction

War after war, I can now see
Secrets and games, deceiving
Fear of the dark
Who wants to play
Winning for me or my country
