We've caught another witch
We want to know the truth
The torture room is ready
She must say the truth

We've caught another witch
And now we know the truth
The pyre and fire are ready
She is the...

You can fly like an eagle
Having the features of the beast
Bringing lightning and storm
Perverse mind of evil
Sharp woman of the night
You don't know morality

[chorus]
The witch of the cheat, the ghost of the night
Is mother and wife during the day
Without this faith you want to live having sin
While your baby is sleeping
The trip of corruption begin
There are two split sides of you
instruments of the Devil

Orgiastic rites in your meeting
Dance and banquet for the Sabbath
Worshipper of pagan divinities
No one knows the magic secret
And the reason of your transformation
Children's fat on your skin

[chorus]

I've left my bed to fly away
Every night I've haunted these places 

You are the cheat, ghost of the night, Devil's woman
