I was forced to confess a guilt
That I have never committed 
Thirty minutes of fear
My executioner is here

Every time he starts again
And he tries to know the truth 

[chorus]
Torture time to save the soul
There's no blood to give the words
Many times you've heard the screams
Innocents haven't left the signs

Flat-nose pliers incandescent
To tear the flesh without blood
The wheel begins to stretch
The water in my throat

Every time he starts again
I feel the pain across my body

[chorus]
