We have got for you
Another book of rules
The Inquisitor's handbook,
He has written it 
To understand the law,
And how to bring it

He had the mission 
To pacify the North,
Italy was infected,
Kill the heretics to
To consecrate the world,
A battle against the blasphemous

Bernard Gui your name means atrocity
You get pleasure from the death penalty

[chorus]
Come with me, Yes we fight
Another mission on the prowl
Day by day, everywhere
We'll arrive to purify
Tell me why, you've sinned
The witch gave me an ointment
You denied the holy law
I've nothing to repent
