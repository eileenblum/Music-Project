Called from the Pope 
I was named inquisitor
It was the beginning of my empire
Court of Seville, court of Madrid
"I'll bring the law of God"
Everyone will have something wrong to hide

I was a Dominican and now with the money
Of the Christians I am...

[chorus]
Tomas De Torquemada
Was the Grand Inquisitor
Over and over Spain
Terror and fear all days everywhere

I live with the horn of the Unicorn
I want to eat and it saves me from poison
I'm rich, I'm scared
Someone wants to kill me
My bodyguards are fighting for my life

I was a Dominican and now with the money
Of the Christians I am...

[chorus]
