While the black smoke of the stakes Inquisition
was spreading his fetid Pall over the Spain
The terrible and ancient Papal Inquisition
Continuing his activity all over Europe

His power is everywhere

The darkness of the forest to the Christians faith
Was closely linked to the Devil's house
City and village, monastery and abbey
Spiritual places for the Christianity

Fear to admit
That you believe in the old divinity
Sunday in the Church 
Night in the wood
This masked faith
Celebration the Sabbath to quiet
The Devils

[chorus]
We are forced to believe in your God
There is fear
We can't profess another faith

Every Village had his own Witch
Who helped people to predict the future
Philtre and Love potion we need to live
You are condemning the pleasures of this world

Fear to admit
That you believe in the old divinity
Sunday in the Church 
Night in the wood
This masked faith
Celebration the Sabbath to quiet
The Devils

[chorus]
