It was the century of the inquisition fear
The dark days of fire were just begun
In the name of Church they imposed fanatic rules
And those days were bringing mad ideas 'n' fear

You mortal men don't kill the innocence
My name is God don't kill your brothers

[chorus]
Burn burn fuckin' burn you're killing
Fight fight, for your pride you'll die

They were looking for people with culture
Was the most important catch of the witches 
The inquisitor decided to prosecute them
With the torture machine they executed your sentence

You mortal men don't kill the innocence
My name is God don't kill your brothers

[chorus]

Torture - You want the glory - Force your rules
You burn the heretics - The doctor is a wizard
You kill the science - You want the power
You kill the culture - You burn the land
