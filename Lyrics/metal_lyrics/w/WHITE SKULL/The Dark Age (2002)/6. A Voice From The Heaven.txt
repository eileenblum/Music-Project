My eyes perceive the blind
Continue on my earth
My heart can't believe
And understand this story
You must stay alive, and carry on my way
I'll be with you forever every time you need

[chorus]
Sweet sister of my life now I can hear your voice
My heart will bring with me your strong love forever
Try one more time to see the right way in your life
One day you'll be with me to see the story from the heaven

Many times I'm lookin' for
A miracle of God
The Angels call me from the sky
To give me a new command 
Can you give me another trial to understand your world
I want to know the reason why the church was killing me

[chorus]
