I canât wait another night in the gloom
The queen is eager
To cut off my head
When the morning dawned all my friends
Were dying she should know
Iâm still alive
Thereâs no fear inside myself
New troops are coming here
The hall is set on fire
Blinded by the smole I stay
In the burning hall
I slay my thirst by drinking blood.

My name is Hagen the cruel
Heart of stone.

Sick at the sight of the carnage
Was the poor king Etzel
Only god would know his grief
Secret orders gave the queen
To kill the enemy
That strongly entrenched was
I canât wait another night in the gloom
I knew well
I was never to return
When the morning dawned all my friends
Were dying she should know
Iâm still alive.

My name is Hagen the cruel
Heart of stone.
