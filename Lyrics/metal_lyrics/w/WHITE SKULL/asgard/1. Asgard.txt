Norsemen hearts belong to you
Ancient god of war
You have created a sacred world
In Asgards is your throne
Time has come to praise the god
Crazy beings were living here
In superstitious fear
Angry gods would ever cause
Pestilence or war
Time has come to praise it has come
Do it over and over again
Praise him for the upcoming war
You wonât feel astray
Heâs got power in his hand
So cry aloud his name
Odin used to overlook
From the exalted throne
Gazed towards south and west
The goal of all the hopes
Time has come to praise it has come
Do it over and over again
Praise him for the upcoming war
You wonât feel astray
Heâs got power in his hand
So cry aloud his name
Asgards protects the warriors
Asgards shelter of gods
Evil grew among the gods
Holy Asgards fault
No one praise it started now
The twilight of the gods
Time has come to praise it has come
Do it over and over again
Praise him for the upcoming war
You wonât feel astray
Heâs got power in his hand
So cry aloud his name
Asgards protects the warriors
Asgards shelter of gods.
