Flash in the night like in a thunderstorm
I crash my car in on a stone
I saw an alien in front of me
A lot of people have the same dream
Donï¿½t talk about it, but believe and save your life
I lost my wife and I want the truth
Search for the meaning for that incubus

But I donï¿½t understand how to smell the death

[Chorus:]
Prophecies we are not dreamers
Mothman is the voice from the space

Drive and drive in a land so far
Another place where people die
I arrive but I donï¿½t know where
Here I breathe a strange atmosphere
Watch the nightmare and the world is in your hands
Every night Mothman appears to you
Evil creature shows you the truth

But I donï¿½t understand how to smell the death

[Chorus:]
Prophecies we are not dreamers
Mothman is the voice from the space
Nightmare shows us the future
Itï¿½s not a dream itï¿½s the prophecy

Darkness, sadness and lots of nights
Another vision is coming soon
Screaming, water, fire and blood
A lot of people trapped on the bridge
I see him the Mothman wants to tell me
Save the people from the tragedy
Is the last prophecy
