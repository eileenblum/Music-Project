We are here not sent by God
To check mother earth
1000 light years from home
Thereï¿½s some work to do
Save the humans from destruction
You are near the end

If you fly high, you will see
Youï¿½ve done damage
And we are here to repair

[Chorus:]
Fly, fly to see your earth from heights
You have to think of a better life
You have to work and work to have a better world

You are far away to pacify the world
Fight, war, everywhere
You want to use nuclear bombs
they will get you to the end
