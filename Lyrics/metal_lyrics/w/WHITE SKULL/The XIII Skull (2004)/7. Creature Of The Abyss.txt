In the highland, there is a hiding place
In the highland the monster lives
Under the water it is concealing
Creature of the water we want to see

[Chorus:]
Survivor from earth attack
Hidden in the sea and lake
You are the only one
Creature of the abyss
Monster from the lake

Monster living on the earth
Aliens willing to killï¿½ em all
Conquerors of mother earth
Throw the bombs on the surface

This new place is good for you
Men from space are conquerors
From the sky you came to fight
all of you burn like in hell
Stellarian fighters are ready to strike
The monsters will die

[Chorus:]
Survivor from earth attack
Hidden from sea and lake
You are only one
Creature of the abyss
Monster from the lake

Now you are only one
The survived of your fate
Scotlandï¿½s legend now you are
The last creature of the earth
You appear sometimes out of the lake
and tales go on

[Chorus:]
Survivor from earth attack
Hidden from sea and lake
You are only one
Creature of the abyss
Monster from the lake

Legend of the North
