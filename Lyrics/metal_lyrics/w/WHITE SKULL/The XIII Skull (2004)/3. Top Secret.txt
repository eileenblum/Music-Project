You have seen a light from the sky,
burning
Heart a big crash on the earth
All the people are searching for the death zone,
searching
But the area was just closed

Another mystery, the people want to know

[Chorus:]
Secret, secret, is falling from the sky
All the people think, who was, and why
You know that there is another life coming from the stars
From the sky

1941 was the year of the crash down
The spaceship was moved to another place
Magazines were talking about that all day
The authority was talking about an accident
