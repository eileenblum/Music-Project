We are ready to leave the earth
We are ready to fly away
We will conquer another world
We are gods without a throne

They are not ready to know the truth
They think that weï¿½re the gods
From the sky from the stars

Clever minds build the skulls
All the power is inside
Throw the skulls on the earth
Someone will search and someone will find them

[Chorus:]
Leave the earth and the Skulls
On the earth somewhere
All the secrets are into the skulls
And they will know the truth

Thirteen Crystal Skulls
Power Hidden Truth
Thirteen Crystal Skulls

Union of the crystal skulls will reveal you the truth

Thirteen Crystal Skulls
Power Hidden Truth
