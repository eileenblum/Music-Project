Itï¿½s midnight in a lost time
The stars are brightening in the sky
The victim is on the altar of God

The sacrifice is starting
The men are dancing around the fire
Now it is time to call the God of the sky

We are believing in the God from the sky
With a spaceship he arrived

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, kill the victim
Sacrifice for God
All we drink her blood from the skull
Blade, blade hit the body
All the people drink
God drink with us her blood from the skull

There is fear and terror
Spaceship is brightening in the sky
All people are looking outside

God is out for blood
Hungry for a fair sacrifice
Someone will shed tears for fear

Your soul is flying among the stars
Bright for us near your sisters
Somewhere out in space
Weï¿½re proud of your sacrifice
Quite is God
filled with blood
