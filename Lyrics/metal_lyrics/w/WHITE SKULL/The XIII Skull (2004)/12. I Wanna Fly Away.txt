Iï¿½m so down and lonely
No one will understand why
Iï¿½ve it all but Iï¿½m alone
Thereï¿½s an angel voice that
Calls me in my mind
Itï¿½s coming from space or another earth

[Chorus:]
I close my eyes
I want to sleep
A blond angel appears to me
She is not a dream
Come in my land she asked me
I left my heart out
I am alone
Iï¿½ve nothing to lose
My eyes are blind and
I donï¿½t believe in love anymore

I want to go but I donï¿½t know
How follow my angel in the sky
I want to fly but I have no wings
Follow me into a new life
Now itï¿½s time to say goodbye
Unchain me, my body is floating high now
Silence broken in my head
Itï¿½s not some fake disease
