We see you, but you donï¿½t see us

We are sailing day by day
We are searching for the land
The connection from East and West
That no one has ever found

Losing direction, we are seeing
Only water everywhere
Over the ocean, following the Stars
The right place is here

Feel it in the air, Atlantis isnï¿½t far

[Chorus:]
Mysterious land you keep
Your treasures concealed
Hiding between continents
Impossible to Find

Under the Oceans
With all your secrets
You are the center of the world
And now we know
That you are
The missing link between two worlds
