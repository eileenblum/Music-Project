I never saw it in the past
But Iï¿½m sure what I feel
There is a lot of magnetism
A lot of big designs
Visible only from the sky
Only when you fly so high
South America, England, Europe
And so on lot of
Signs in the fields

Perfect designs on the ground
not by man drawn

[Chorus:]
These signs are coming from the sky
Men donï¿½t know why
Universe is talking with us

Scientists threw out
Some messages and hoped to find
Someone to hear them
Genetic trees traveling in space
And weï¿½ve received them from another place

Signs, more, signs with message Aliens wrote
Signs, more, signs we want to know the code
Signs, more, signs, but we donï¿½t understand
Signs, more, signs, we think it ï¿½s a joke
