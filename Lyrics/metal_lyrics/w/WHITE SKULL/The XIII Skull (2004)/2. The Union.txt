Every day you think of tomorrow
You fear for your end
To know the future of the earth
Is the key of life

Someone left us the key
But we donï¿½t know where itï¿½s at
To know the future and our past
Could be dangerous for all

[Chorus:]
Light, the power is coming from their union
Fly, all the skulls are overhead
Shine, itï¿½s time for revelations
Bright, the ancients come from the stars

Crazy men want all the power
And the last skull theyï¿½ve found
In Atlantis it was buried
With the secret of universe

All the skulls are in their hands
And they know how to use ï¿½em
Good and evil are fighting again
But we know who will win
