Form the holy river came a race I've never seen
Black earth gave birth to the 30 dynasties
And all the people venerate the almighty God
Supreme divinity are the pharaohs

Devoted priests watch over temples of the dead
The celebration of the burial never end
Embalmed bodies lay down, mummies 'R' alive
The body rest, the soul enter a new life

[Chorus]
Precious gift the earth gave to the man
Egypt land it's glittering around
Hail to you Valley of the Sun
Egypt land it's glitterin' around

Look at the pyramid a world is closed in it
In Gizah plan you'll find the greatest graves
Don't touch the jewels or the skeleton arise
The malediction of the mummy will survive
