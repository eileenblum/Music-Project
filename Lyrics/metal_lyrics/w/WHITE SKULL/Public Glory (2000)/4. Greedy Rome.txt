First of all I wanna talk about the Roman hero
Yeah, Caesar was indeed
He was known as son of Rome who have hanged heroes
And enemies
Caesar knew the army cult he was born to win all wars
Oh, he never failed
Jalous men will not love him so they've slained their
Mortal enemy

Holy Rome your sons are strong bonded to be heroes
Yeah conquerors of steel
Day by day your limits change you're winning all your
Hardest enemies
Stand this town in sacred soil blessed by the heaven
Yeah, the capitol of lust
Noone knew a better town plentiful of threasures
Wrapped on silk

No, kingdoms are clay
If there's no chief
All falls in ruins
Greedy Rome, immortal town
You always kill the ruler you'll need     Oh

Holy Rome your sons are strong bonded to be heroes
Yeah conquerors of steel
Day by day your limits change you're winning all your
Hardest enemies
Stand this town in sacred soil blessed by the heaven
Yeah, the capitol of lust
Noone knew a better town plentiful of threasures
Wrapped on silk
