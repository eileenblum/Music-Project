Animal form or God concealed in
Animal body, since ever you know
It's up to you, welcome the dead one
Watch over them in the pyramid hall

In the book of dead your priest have written
The other world host deities
So many doors to the gloomy region
Animal Gods where's your realm?

Osiris Ra head of a hawk
Isis the wind renew it all

[Chorus]
Anubis the jackal protector of the dead
Evry wall represents your holy image
Anubis the jackal, you're the one I prefer
Half a wolf half a man which part will prevail?

Well I've been told the aliens came
From far away the new technology
In Gizah plain so many tracks stand
Where are you form Anubis the jackal?

Osiris Ra head of a hawk
Isis the wind renew it all
