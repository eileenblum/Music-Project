Victorious men walk thru' the land
Shadows huddled in the groins into the maze
Where are you chief? Your soldiers wait
Once again the Romans want to extend its edge.

Hard tiring days and sleepless nights
Marchin'on thru' hasty lands and evil hill
Rain of sharp spears fall upon them
Once again it's time to attack the enemies

Give them money and glory
They will follow Caesar and threat the enemies
just follow him     painting from exitement
don't turn down in anger
Caesar change the world in the kingdom of Rome

[Chorus]
Raise The Roman Empire It's shining so bright
