Southern throne is this your fast realm
Shinin' sun, wherever she stands on
It's glitterin' around, Egyptian star
Deep in love with Caesar the oppressor
Full of hope winnin' all her hardest

Oh bring me on
to your soul your world let me know

[Chorus]
Cleopathra daughter of the Sun
Mother bride 'n' ruler of the Egyptian land
Cleopathra daughter of the Sun
Soon you will become the new deity

The baby's in her arms exclaiming all his rights
Still stands on looking at the Roman faces
Full of pride, she will divide
Caesar love it's not enough to her now
She needs more, she in need to
Face her destiny and became the Egyptian guide
