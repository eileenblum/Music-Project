Deep in the desert is hidden a sun
Only the stars know what it's for
Seven symbols in position crack the code
Egyptians know the score

[Chorus]
In the sky The Mangler

The alien found out the way to the earth
Human creatures were easy to rule
But the newcome God was dangerous and bad
The Stargate must be closed

[Chorus]
In the sky The Mangler

Just beware the ancient profecy
When the mangler will be back

Hieroglyph writting point out the fate
In the next future he will be back
Never try to let this alien come again
This Rha is not the sun
