On the morrow he'll be dead
I've smelt the ambush down in Rome
Beware the ides of march
But he's not gonna well
There's no telling who'll be next
Let this consuls come to me
I'm going to pick a fight
The sky is turning bleak

They want my Blood
This Romans want my blood
Nest of scheming snakes
You deceived the brave

[Chorus]
The Roman king has perished
All his lands will fall into my hands

Caesar watch out at your back
And beware your son in law
Brutus wants to see you dead
Cassius don't you love at all
Oh Metellus
Don't trust Trebonius
Decius Brutus loves you not
Casca Cinna are traitors
All these men are closed to you
And they stab you in the back
Oh great Caesar
Waht have they done to you?

They want my Blood
This Romans want my blood
Nest of scheming snakes
You deceived the brave

Tu quoque, Brute, fili mi

[Chorus]
The Roman king has perished
All his lands will fall into my hands
