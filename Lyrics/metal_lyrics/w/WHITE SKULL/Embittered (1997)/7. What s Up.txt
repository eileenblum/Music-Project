25 years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great
big hill of hope
for a destination
I realized quickly when I
knew I should
that the world was made up
of this brotherhood of man
for whatever that means
And so I cry sometimes
when I'm lying in bed
to get it all out what's in my
head then I
I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the
morning and I step outside
and I take deep breath
and I get real high
then I scream from the top
of my lungs
what's goin' on
and I say hey... hey...
I say hey, what's goin' on
and I say hey... hey...
I said hey, what's goin' on
Oh, ooh ...
Oh, ooh ...
and I try, oh my God do I
try
I try all the time
in this institution
and I pray , oh my God do I
pray
I pray every single day
for a revolution
and so I cry sometimes
when I'm lying in my bed
just to get it all out what's in
my head then I
I am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the
morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath
then I get real high
then I scream from the top
of my lungs
what's goin' on
and I say hey... hey...
I say hey, what's goin' on
and I say hey... hey...
I said hey, what's goin' on
and I say hey... hey...
I say hey, what's goin' on
and I say hey... hey...
I said hey, what's goin' on
Oh, ooh , ooh ...
25 years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great
big hill of hope
for a destination .
