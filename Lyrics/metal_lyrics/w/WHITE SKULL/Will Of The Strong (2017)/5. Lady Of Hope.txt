Darker were the pampas dust, poor and lone gorgeous Latina Cinderella's born leave behind the shadows walk straight to the spot lights and movie stages where your soul belong

Argentina, here is your Evita (tsarina) for the nation I will fight and win when the lights were low came a brand new hope a child of poverty sought eternity from the heart I spoke built the bridge of hope in my destiny Argentina free

Powerful her speeches high above the crowds illness stroke the woman but the legend goes

Argentina, here is your Evita (tsarina) for the nation I will fight and win when the lights were low came a brand new hope a child of poverty sought eternity from the heart I spoke built the bridge of hope in my destiny Argentina free
