Tonight we fly, get on the plane
The flight is long there is no rest
War is real
For motherland we came here
To show we're strong and fear no one â sky is clear

Free your life we steal
Tonight the bombs are real
We don't spare with fire and steel
The hope has wings, night witches seek revenge

The searchlight blinds, the airplane crash
I never felt the breath of death
So close to me
Will I became an hero, or just another fallen child?
Witches burn

Free
Your life we steal
Tonight the bombs are real
We don't spare with fire and steel
The hope has wings, night witches seek revenge

Hit them now
In the night time
Take them down
Drop the bomb now
1. set on fire â tonight
2. the frozen land will burn your plans to stay
