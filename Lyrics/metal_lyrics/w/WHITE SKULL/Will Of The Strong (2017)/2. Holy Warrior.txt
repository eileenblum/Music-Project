People come and hear me a light spoke to me clearly

We must defeat the English power to save France from the invaders

A warrior maiden driven by power of believing to most of them I looked insane I was the chosen saint

My voice is known to be free I got not fear nor dismay to carry out the godly plan the king of France will reign

A white dress I wore to war for death came without a sword to many battles I will ride Iâm not alone godâs on my side get up stand tall for the holy warrior when your god calls you stay strong holy warrior

People come and hear me your torture made my mind clear I choose to burn Iâm free from sin the end I did not fear Joan of Arc was driven by the power of believing the holy warrior faced her death by being true to herself

Get up stand tall for the holy warrior when your god calls you stay strong holy warrior
