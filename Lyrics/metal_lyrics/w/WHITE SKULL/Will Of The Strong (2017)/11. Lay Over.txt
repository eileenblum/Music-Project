The house I rule is hard to fight the people's standing by my side I swore the pope, my protection for the journey and when he came he looked so dull there is really nothing he can do bow your head, show your penance to the great ones

Lay over the time has come to kneel, there is no retrieval get over the kingdom's mine draw back your efforts to mess with me

The wedding ties were never right I sit now at the opposing side my domains will never be the price for my resolution to be strong the independence that I own let alone, the emperor suspicion

Lay over the games are done go back I am stronger than ever get over the kingdom's mine draw back your efforts to mess with me

I. I rule the holy reign and there is no way you tame so much power I know there is no way you challenge my domains without power

II. What's up with Matilde di Canossa did you see Matilde di Canossa

Lay over the time has come to kneel, there is no retrieval get over the kingdom's mine draw back your efforts to mess with me lay over the games are done go back I am stronger than ever
Get over the kingdom's mine draw back you mess with the evil
