Trial in the field there's no more hope for me I've been alone but anchored in my gods have I thought to seal my heart from love? My heart filled with lies I'm too strong to abide some night some day

One more thrill before I cross this field one last breath and I am gone where gods and warriors are

Sacrifice, a thousand million times are we now free from pain? Sacrifice, it takes a warrior's life to see a change of fate

Lies they feed, to keep the people fear what is known to be wrong will never make me turn when I die the legend will survive
When I die hope will arise

Sacrifice, it's set for me tonight I feel my time is near come to me pain I do not fear no no uh now your time to sacrifice all you have now time to sacrifice don't let them dim your light and seek in yourself your beliefs when your realize how much strong is your kind say you will find the strength to be free at the end of your days you will realize that your legend will be born tonight
