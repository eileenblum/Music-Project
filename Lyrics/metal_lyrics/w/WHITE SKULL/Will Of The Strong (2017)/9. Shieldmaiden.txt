It's my life it's my fight I'm burning on and on it's my life it's my pride shieldmaiden

Straight for you straight for you I'm heading straight to the heart

Here is my mission invading the western settle my people become the earl raising the shield and slain in the field

Rain pour all over me wash away the stains clear the path to Odin's land Frey don't give up on me give me one more chance one more child is all I ask

It's my life it's my pride shieldmaiden on and on

Straight for you straight for you I'm heading straight to the heart

I aim with precision but lacking in numbers for I must follow the will of the gods I only fear the word of the seer

Rain pour all over me wash away the stains clear the path to Odin's land Frey don't give up on me give me one more chance one more child is all I ask

I aim with precision but lacking in numbers for I must follow the will of the gods I only fear the word of the seer

Rain pour all over me wash away the stains clear the path to Odin's land Frey don't give up on me give me one more chance one more child is all I ask
