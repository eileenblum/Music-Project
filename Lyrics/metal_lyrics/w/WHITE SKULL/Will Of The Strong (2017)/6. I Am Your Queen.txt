Stuck up in my mind the winds of war are blowing stuck up in my mind two queens hating each other stuck up in my mind the legend and the sword stuck up in my mind --- a new queen's coming his child she's now bearing she walks straight to me I don't take it lightly say why you came forth what are your plans now --- my trust has been broken the gods have now spoken betrayed â I'll be waiting I won't be forgiving fear my revenge now in time I will state how

I am your queen my lord the prophecy foretold the children born
I am your queen my lord in bloody fields we fought shieldmaiden

Stuck up in my mind the winds of war are blowing stuck up in my mind two queens that hate each other stuck up in my mind the legend and the sword stuck up in my mind --- I am not like my father I am not like my mother my sons will be rulers I am part of his saga I had no choice but to follow the god's word

I am your queen my lord the prophecy foretold the children born I am your queen my lord in bloody fields we fought shieldmaiden
