Tribes were living peacefully rejoicing their homeland mother earth would give them birth the father shelter them power from within, all one with the land, living, united

White man felt in danger when they saw the gods we chose different from the one they praise, soon after war arose mother give us strength, spirits guide our hand, fighting united

Little sister lozen knew what ussen would have said spread her arms and point the way the soldiers built their stead power in her hands, fighting in defense, hiding to strike

Riding hard as they gave chase in the apache land what lies in store, they don't know yet, they're coming to their end rifle in the air, few warriors in the plains, fighting to life

I earned the right to stand, to fight and ride beside the man I'm a wild and strong metal Indian I ride the wind, foresee the attack, the spirit is my guide I'm a wild and strong I'm an Indian
