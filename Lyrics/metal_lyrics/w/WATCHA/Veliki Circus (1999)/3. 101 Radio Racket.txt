101 radio racket, bonzo Butcho on the air, ready to set the night on fire!
Yep! It's the D.day duds!
The final countdown before the fateful hour two triple "O"
The golden age, where cars are supposed to fly!
And goddamn
Everywhere around us symbols of the end of the world!
Oooooh I'm scared!
Repent yourself and save your soul, alleluia!
So right now pick up your phones, somebody on a line...

Look what we've done, mother earth is gone
Cut the crap man or you'll die alone!

Why don't you take the time
To look all around, see the optimistic side
Enjoy, no sweat my friend!

[Refrain:]
All I breathe is depressing me!
What a bullshit man!
Nothing is mine!
All I breathe is depressing me!
What a bullshit man!
Nothing is mine!

You're still listening to 101 radio racket!
Def! Well... our buddies seem to be rather pessimistic and tortured!
He, my goombahz!
What's coming down?
Down beat! Easy going!
We're not on CNN international!
We celebrate the year 2000!
Fab! Frantic! Wild! Froody! Radical!
Wailing! Right now a new listener...!

Look what we've done, mother earth is gone
Cut the crap man or you'll die alone!
Look what we've done, mother earth is gone
Cut the crap man or you'll die alone!

[Refrain]

Don't feed me that line!
Don't take me for a lorg!
Things get worse and worse everyday!
Don't feed me that line!
Don't take me for a lorg!
Things get worse and worse everyday!

[Pont:]
Blitz on my head when I hear you just say: come on and celebrate! No! [x4]

[Refrain]
