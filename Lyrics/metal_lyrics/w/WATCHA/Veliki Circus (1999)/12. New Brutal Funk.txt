[Intro:]
Brothers and sisters, life is a gift
And as a gift of heaven
How can someone or any kind of profanes
Reappraise god's creations?
Bow to the power of lord and hear my words of wisdom
Because at the very beginning god's created:
Adam and Eve...

Well...what about Darwin?

I don't wanna listen!
I don't want to talk about it!
I don't wanna listen!
Darwin was a liar!
I don't wanna listen!
I don't want to talk about it!
I don't wanna listen!
Darwin was a liar
I don't wanna listen!
I don't want to talk about it!
I don't wanna listen!
Darwin was a liar!

Hi, dear what a real pleasure to talk with you at last
What on hell are you talking about I'm astounded
You make my blood run cold
Why do you refuse to face up?
The fact when it's in front of you?
It's so drap! It's so sad!
There's a gab what a bullshit!
Stop to arse around!

[Pre-Refrain:]
Tell me where do we go?
A leap backward?
I don't know
Tell me where do we go?
A leap backward?
I don't know

[Refrain:]
Give it up [x2]
Don't wanna hear you talk! Make my day now!
Give it up [x2]
Make my day now!
Give it up [x2]
Don't wanna hear you talk! Make my day now!
Give it up [x2]
Make my day now!
Give it up [x2]
Don't wanna hear you talk! Make my day now!
Give it up [x2]
Make my day now!
Give it up [x2]
Don't wanna hear you talk! Make my day now!
Give it up [x2]
Make my day now!
Make my day now!

Always in a bygone age, immutable and no more range!
All the words that you preach and proclaim are so slanderous for humanity
Maybe I'm wrong I don't know
But one thing is sure: gets a life!
If you think that the world is the same
I can say that: you're completely wrong!

[Pre-Refrain]

[Pont 1:]
Give me a go-by

[Pont 2:]
Oh lord I abide by what I said
No compromises, no rest, no peace for my enemies:
Profanes, this drives me insane, insane!

[Refrain]

[Pont 3:]
What is the straight law? [x18]
C'mon! Make my day now!
