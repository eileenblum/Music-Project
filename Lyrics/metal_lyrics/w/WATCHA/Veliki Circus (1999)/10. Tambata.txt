Roads I took are strewn with cobblestone hills and cliffs
Sometimes high, but I often go down in flames

[Pre-Refrain:]
Salvation watch over me and my dreams
Everybody's got a little music inside
Salvation watch over me and my dreams
Everybody's got a little music inside

[Refrain:]
The bus stops I think 'bout Tambata
Everybody's leaving but I'm staying inside
The bus stops one more time

Rough ordeals make me stronger and suspicious
No more choice, I've been way too far
There's no way back.

[Pre-Refrain]

[Pont 1:]
I've learned how to live and how to find my way
The one for me because I don't look back
I don't look back "biriama" back on my past
All alone without a helping hand, I've learned!
Doesn't matter what the people said all alone x 3

[Refrain]

[Pont 2:]
I don't wanna wanna wake up with my frustrations
my own demons all around, to live on my past!
No ! I fallow my road to Tambata

[Pont 3:]
The bus stops everybody's leaving but
I'm standing inside my way. (my way is my ride!)

[Pont 4:]
And I fly

[Fin:]
My Tambata, (what?)
Is hard to reach (what?)
Is hard to get, (what?)
Don't wanna give up no!
It's hard to reach; (what?)
It's hard to get! (what?)
It's hard to reach
My Tambata blow me away
The bus stops bring me to Tambata.

[Refrain]
