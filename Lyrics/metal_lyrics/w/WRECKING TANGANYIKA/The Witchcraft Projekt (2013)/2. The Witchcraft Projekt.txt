I made a promise
No-matter the change we always stay inside our suffer-ring
Hekate returns this day is damned onto our suffering
You cannot know it's me [x2]

Hekate returns decayed flesh and broken bones
I wake up from the lies we're bleeding 'bout to die
The paradogma left us for witchcraft (life)
You wake up to your end and death is clearly sent
With blood it's in your veins you repent, you repent

Bring me back
Bring me back to life i'll kill you with my fucking knife
The blood will drip from your own life
Bleeding, burning your end is me [x2]

Not so long ago it was blood you adored
It was death you had lured now your blood has been boiled
(your blood has been boiled) bleeding, burning your end is me (argh)
Seconds from the end what's it gonna be (pull the trigger bitch)

Bleeding, burning your end is me
Hekate returns decayed flesh and broken bones
I wake up from the lies we're bleeding 'bout to die
The paradogma left us for witchcraft life (witchcraft)
