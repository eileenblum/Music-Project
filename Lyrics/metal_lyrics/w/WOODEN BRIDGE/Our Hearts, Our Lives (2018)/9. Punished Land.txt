Holy thunder from the skies
Enlighten our hearts, our lives
Stormy rain from paradise
Revive our land let it back to life

If you come with me, I will show the way
I'll show the way out from this world disarray
This dry land is our curse
For distrust on the gods

Beyond this weary hills there's a chance for life
Our life can be again filled with hope and pride
Pain step aside, shame we'll leave behind

Behind our dreams there is a faith
But now we are living a nightmare
And we cannot awake

Punished by the sun our earth seems (to be)
The land has died by our own sins

Dry is our land, if you give me your hand
I will take you to a magic place
Believe it's true, a sea of blue
Dry is our land, if you give me your hand
I will take you to a magic place
Believe it's true, a sea of blue

The journey has begun
A long, long way to run
To find our peace again we'll go until the end
Our home we've left behind

With no remorse we move
There's nothing left to prove
Survival is our goal, there's nothing left to know
Hungry and thirsty we are

Dreary lands we walked, not so much to talk
Cause the pain was so much deep
The sun was angry with us
Wanting us dead

Holy thunder from the skies
Enlighten our hearts, our lives
Stormy rain from paradise
Revive our land let it back to life
