The way of the damned
Calls your soul
The only way to follow
Covered with ice and snow

There is blood
There is pain
The sad sky sends the red rain

Death brings despair
Darkness brings the cold
The voice inside my head
Of a hundred stolen souls

The endless battle takes our gold
Sins of the man, slave of precious stones

Fight for honor and fight for pride
I will fight until I die
At this moment I must fight
My axe brings the ashes of life

It's raining again
It's raining again
