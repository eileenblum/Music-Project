We are the ancient ones
The elves who guard this wooden bridge
Introduce yourself
And tell me what is your will in this magical place
What's your will in this place?

This forest you want to come in is our home
Protected with our lives from the rest of the world
For centuries now we are living in peace and freedom

We can take you to our king
But be warned it won't be easy to convince him
You should have a free pass in this magical place
What's your will in this place, anyway?

The animals sing to us every day
The Dryads are sweet, comfort us in our way
Noble Centaurians help us with good intentions

But it haven't always been like this
For peace we struggled hard
The bloodiest battle we fought and we won
But took so many lives

The history of our people is so sad and so cold
The freedom we earned, we won't toss it away
Be warned, be warned
Be warned, my friend

My good man, no one comes in or come out
Without we all know
So don't try to fool me, you'll only fool yourself
For us this is no joke!

We have no intentions to harm you
But just give me one good reason!
I'll load up my bow before you can blink
Don't doubt, don't doubt
Don't doubt my word

This forest you want to come in is our home
Protected with our lives from the rest of the world
For centuries now we are living in peace and freedom

The animals sing to us every day
The Dryads are sweet, comfort us in our way
Noble Centaurians help us with good intentions
