Inside the darkness
Through the snow
A knife in hand
And my wooden bow
In the silence
Walking alone
The night sings my hunting song
It sings my hunting song

The stars are shining and the cold wind blows
In every mountain, through every stone
Felt the night like we're both one
And the night still sings my hunting song
Sings my hunting song

Prey in sight and it starts to run
Arrow in hand, the hunt begun
Under the skies, beyond the sun
Blood in hand, my work is done

My prey is dying and panting slowly
No one to rescue
Death comes lonely
We live together to die alone
And I'll always sing my hunting song
Sing my hunting song
