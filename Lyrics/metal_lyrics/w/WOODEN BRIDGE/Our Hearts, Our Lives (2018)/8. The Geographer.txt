Noble friends
I don't want to disturb your tranquility
Listen well

I'm just an explorer from outside this world
I carry no weapon, only my books
My sword is my pen and my shield is my flute

Let me see what's in these woods
Let me see what's in these woods

Let's shake hands
And I promise I'll do no harm to your land
Trust in me

I'm just a geographer and I wanna know
About this amazing place that you live in
I wanna see the trees and behold the magic lights

Let me see!
Let me see!
