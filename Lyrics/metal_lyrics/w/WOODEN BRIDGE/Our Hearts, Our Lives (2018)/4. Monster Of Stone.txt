An empty heart
A loveless soul
Dark as the night
Cold as the snow

Why are you here? (Why are you here?)
I'm your worst fear (Fear me!)

I've come to see you
I've come to feel you
I've come to know if you are real

I am the monster of stone
I am the king of my own throne
Beast, but I was once a man
And here I make my stand

Kill, kill, kill the monster!

Cold heartless demon
Let my magic bring thee the light again
And never forget, inside these rocks there is a man

Don't be a fool (cold heartless demon)
The darkness in me shall never leave
But never forget (but never forget)
That your efforts will be remembered one day
