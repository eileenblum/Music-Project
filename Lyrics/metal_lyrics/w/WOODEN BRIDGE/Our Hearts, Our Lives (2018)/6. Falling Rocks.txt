I wish this fight could stop
I wish it had an end
For long I've waited this day
I wish I could have stayed

My brother, my sister
The hope is in your hands
Lor-Minoir

Beyond the hills, it is our last sunrise
Yes, we fight at morning
To bury them at night

My brother, my sister
The hope is in your hands
Lor-Minoir

Fool of a mage who made a stupid trick of falling stars
Heaven's curse on me
He said he could cast some magic to create a pass
Between the canyon which divided us from Ror-Modin

We believed in him, it was our last choice
How could we have known that he would make a rain of rocks
He failed the spell, it fell upon us all
We die, we die, we die!
