From the hills of Lindor
A song of love and war
In the forest of Lindor
There was a man called Maglor

In the village of Lindor
There was a princess ready to fall
On a crusade towards her throne
Run to Ror-Modin!

Then she left her old house
Walking sneakily just like a mouse
She was going after her throne
Run to Ror-Modin!

"I can help you", said Maglor
But Ceres, the princess, wasn't too sure
"I don't know you, what's your name?"
"I am Maglor, that is my name"
"I'm Sapphire, just an elf"
She thought that was better to lie about her fame
Shame, shame, shame!
