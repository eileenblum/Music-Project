[Alchemist]:
Pain lies inside my heart
It's my mistake that tears us apart
All my sorrow, all my pain
All my knowledge, will it be in vain?

[Narrator]:
The mighty alchemist that fails in his art
Covered in shame, murderer of his wife
Guilt and regret are hard to endure
It might be unforgivable

[Alchemist]:
Just a miracle could save my love
Just a miracle could bring her back to life
Just a miracle could erase that night
Just a miracle turns my hell into paradise

I'm on the edge
Chills in my spine
Looking for a name
He is the knight
Living to fight
Could he know a way?

[Knight]:
In my life of pleasures
Swords and axes
Come with me and forget about her name
We can ride our lives
And ladies sing to us
You could have it all and your soul would be free

[Alchemist]:
Sorry your life is not for me
My soul is far away from here

[Priest]:
Oh, sorry! I wish I could bring your woman back to life
But it's easy to trust on the gods... when you need them
When they wanted you, you said no
We could have good use of your science
Please don't misunderstand me
Good gods don't want your hate
You just can't change fate

[Alchemist]:
Pain lies inside my heart
It's my mistake that tears us apart
All my sorrow, all my pain
All my knowledge, will it be in vain?

[Shaman]:
Maybe I know of an ancient way
But then let me say that the price is too high
I know that you've lost all in your life
If you wish to go on, it will demand a sacrifice

[Wife]:
I know my dear that you miss me
[Alchemist]:
I'm sorry soon you will be back
[Wife]:
I have to learn to let you go
[Alchemist]:
And so do I, it hurts me so...
[Wife]:
I'm moving on towards the light
[Alchemist]:
Give it in to time, we shall be one
[Wife]:
In life or death, there is only you
[Both]:
We'll meet again someday!
