Close your eyes, make me last forever
Hold inside, immortal mine
Close my eyes, lay me down in heaven
Embrace my lie, your soul in time

Won't you take me up inside you
Am I more than you can take
I'll be your father's heart of darkness
When you wake
Black blood is pounding drive your
Heart through my stake
Slide up inside you till your
Hearts start to break

Is it taste of bloody kisses
Is it more than you can fake
Feel me deep inside you
Is it your faith that I shake
Forgive me father for your
Sins that I break
My hand to the promise land
Your soul that I prey

Won't you take me up inside you
Am I more than you can take
Hide me deep inside and let me
Be the one forsaken
Won't you take me up inside you
Cause there's no more I can wait
Hold me in your eyes until there's
No more of you that I can take

Take, take, take
No more of you that I can take
