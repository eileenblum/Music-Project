I'm gonna take you, lay you face
Down on my bed
On bloody roses see you smile
Ooh your screaming heart is bleeding
Black and beating loud
You got no prayer nowhere
There ain't noway out tonight

I feel your face embrace the sweat
Fall from my head
My name is vain and flames you cry
Ooh and your bloody lips you raise to kiss
Away goodbye
You wicked bitch I'll take you
Take you away and make you mine

I'll make you cry for mercy
I'll make you cry out loud
You're gonna lie and curse me
Hurt me, burn me now
Gonna make you cry for mercy
Nobody never gonna hear you now
I'll make you mine but first I
I'll make you cry out loud
Out loud
Ooh out loud
Ooh out loud
