Hang man coming better run to save your
Kids, your wives, your lives, your babies
Hang the wire round the necks of liars alright
Rain man on fire from the hells of Hades
I see your face inside the blazes
Hang'em higher come breathe the fire all night

Oh run, run Daddy got a shotgun
On your knees tonight
And never return
Oh run, run Daddy's riding shotgun
On your knees to die
The devil's begging to burn

You better run
Hang high your burning man of prey
You're gonna burn
Ooh, hang your burning man and pray
You never live to see him burn again

The seed you sow coming home to hate you
Breathe your greed is there non to save you
Hang the liar red with fire alright
A great seal to kneel for domination
Kill their king you think they'd save you
Give me fire and kill the liar all night

Ash to ash, dust to be
Face in flames, your effagee
The night time sky and see
The burning man's a liar
