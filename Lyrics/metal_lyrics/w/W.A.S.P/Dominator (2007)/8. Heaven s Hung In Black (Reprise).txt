I can't take anymore
I have no more wings
I can't take anymore
The gates of heaven sealed

See my angels
Too Insaingels
See my Insaingels
Are never coming back

I can't take anymore
Our walls are black and bleed
I can't take anymore
No rooms here for your screams

See my angels
Too Insaingels
See my Insaingels
Are never coming back

Do you know what it's like
When Heavens hung in black

No don't you leave me to die
Don't you leave me to die
No, don't you leave me to die
Oh my Lord, don't you leave me to die

And you'll know what it's like
Painting heaven black
And you'll know what it's like
Hanging heaven black
