Now I lay me down
A crown of thorns falls from my head
My lord you see my knees I fall
There's never been no time I ever been denied
Almighty lord
Ooh, God in heaven gonna give me
All I want
It's all right, all right, It's all right, all right
It's all right, all right, It's all right, all right
It's all right, all right, It's all right, all right

I'm a chosen one, I'm Lazarus
Rising from the dead
My bloody feet and knees I crawl
And my tithes he give me seven times
Gonna give me all I want
God in heaven gonna give me
All I want

My God's gimme, gimme
All the heaven's blessed
And everytime give me everything I prayed I'd be
My God's given to me all the heaven gives
And everytime give me everything I believe I need
