Where you gonna turn to
Burning Bush's lie
God he's listening to ain't mine no
Big oil is wicked master
Slave god of gasoline
Ride the Armageddon mile

Sow your seed asunder
Kill you for a smile
Knead your beast and watch it rise
Feed your children to the
Halibutron war machine
Game is fixed and you're all blind

But still to get along we gotta
Long, long way to go
Oh, oh, oh no nearer to God we gotta
Long, long way to go
You sing a bloody song, you gotta
Long, long way to go
Bastard, bloody bastard
Bastard, bloody bastard
