I heard the rhythm
I was rocking at two
I had the Rock &amp; Roll Blues

I had a vision
Down at the crossroads
To give the Devil the news

Gimme a name
And all the hell I can raise
No I had nothing to lose

I wanted fame but now
The price that you claim's oh
My soul be given to you

Cause I won't make no deal
With the Devil tonight
No I won't make no deal
To give him my life
Cause I won't make no deal
With the Devil tonight
No I won't make no deal
To give him my life

I got a pain and I
I got a band
The road to paying my dues

A million times he shoved that
Dotted line at me
To sing away my Blues

Oh, the pen he had
Had my blood on his hands
For all Eternity too

Don't sell your soul to
No Rock &amp; Roll Crossroads
He'll come collecting his due

There ain't no deal
No there ain't no deal
No deal no Devil here tonight
There ain't no deal
No there ain't no deal
No deal no Devil here tonight
No I won't make no deal
Oh, tonight
No I won't make no deal
No tonight
