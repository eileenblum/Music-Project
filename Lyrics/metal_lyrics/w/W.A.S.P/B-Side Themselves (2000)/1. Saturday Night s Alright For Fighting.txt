[Elton John cover]

Anything for you
Is what you told me
The day I sat there with you.
So I know
nothing lasts forever.
When will we realize it's gone?

Anything for you
Is what you told me
The day I sat there with you.
Do we understand
that words were not enough?
You said to me that this would last forever.

Why did we rely on
The time when I lied,
The time when I said I can't live without you?

It's all over now.

Why?
You walked away.
Why?

You said that I,
You said that I don't wanna work it out.
You know that I tried.
I do that sometimes.
We're just wasting time.

Why did we rely on
The time when I lied,
The time when I said I can't live without you?

I know you to say to me that things have changed.
I look in your eyes
And I know that things will remain the same.
You said that I,
That I follow you.
We've lost it all again
