[Led Zeppelin cover]

If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break,
If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break,
When The Levee Breaks I'll have no place to stay.
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan,
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan,
Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home,
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Don't they make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home,
You don't know which way to go
If you're goin' down South
Then there's no work to do,
And you're going on to Chicago.
Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
Ooh, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move.
All last night sat on the levee and moaned,
All last night sat on the levee and moaned,
I said left my baby and my happy home.
Going, go'n' to Chicago,
Go'n' to Chicago,
Sorry but I can't take you.
Going down, going down now, going down.
Don't they make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home,
You don't know which way to go
If you're goin' down South
Then there's no work to do,
And you're going on to Chicago.
To Chicago
Going down, going down, going down
