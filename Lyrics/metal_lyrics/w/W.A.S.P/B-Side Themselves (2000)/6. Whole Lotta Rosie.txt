[AC/DC cover]

Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
I come to lovin'
Oh she steals the show

She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Fort'two thirt'nine, fiftysix
You could say she got it all

Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doing all the things
Doing all the things you do

Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bones
But you give it all you got
Weighin' in at nineteen stone

You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman

Honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one who turn
Only one who turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
Ooh, to my surprise
Rosie never stops

She was a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman

Oh you're a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're a whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
