[Jethro Tull cover]

In the Shuffling madness of the locomotive breath,
Runs the all time loser, headlong to his death
He feels the piston scraping steam breaking on his brow
Old Charlie stole the handle and the train that watched her go
You know he couldn't slow down
No he couldn't slow down
He sees his children jumping off at stations one by one
His woman and his best friend in bed and having fun
Crawling down the corridor on his hands and knees
Old Charlie stole the handle and the train that watched her go
No he couldn't slow down
No he couldn't slow down
He hears the silence howling catches angels as they fall
And the all time winner has got him by the balls
He picks up Gideons Bible open at page one
I thank God he stole the handle and the train that watched her go
You know he couldn't slow down
No he couldn't slow down
