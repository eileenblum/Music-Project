I'm a liar and I'm a cheat
I have no morals and I'm a thief
Pillage and plunder, curse those who enter
I am a killer and tormentor

Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)

I'm a sinner, I kiss the breast
I am a sadist that whips the flesh
I'll take the women, curse those who enter
I am a killer and tormentor

Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)

I am the lord of liars
And I command the force of Fire

Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)
Tormentor (tormentor)
