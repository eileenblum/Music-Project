You hear the cries of love, a sad tune
And feel the salt-lick stingin' loves wound
Those tears that you cry leave a blood stain
They fall to the ground like a sweet rain
Cos bad girls they do

B.A.D.-Bad, make your mom and daddy sad
B.A.D.-Bad, It's the bloody fix you do Oh, Look out

You see what's in your head, fantasy
And need, but you can't have B.A.D.
Call a spade a spade only if you want to
Cos by any other name it's taboo
Cos bad boys they do

B.A.D.-Bad, make your mom and daddy sad
B.A.D.-Bad, It's the bloody fix you do, the bloody fix you do
B.A.D.-Bad, make your mom and daddy sad
B.A.D.-Bad, gonna drive you raving mad
B.A.D.-Bad, make your mom and daddy sad
B.A.D.-Bad It's the bloody fix you do
