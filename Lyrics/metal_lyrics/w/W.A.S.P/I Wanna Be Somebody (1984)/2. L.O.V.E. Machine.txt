Lady, have you known me? The
Perfect love machine. Iâm
Virgo my Leoâs rising,
Venus made me king.
That chain of broken hearts -
They all belong to me.
Magic runs through my fingers,
One touch - you'll see!

[Chorus:]
L.O.V.E.
All I needâs my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I needâs my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I needâs my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E.
All I needâs my love machine tonight!
Tonight!

What can I do for you? Am
I your wildest dream?
What do I move in you? Am
I what I seem?
My eyes they lie and you cry,
Love brings you pain!
And if you try to love me,
You'll not be the same!

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
