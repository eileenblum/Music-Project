My eyes are burning, bells are ringing in my ears
Alarm clocks wailing, class bells screaming, I can't hear
A text book mad-house, twelve years
I'm here in a rage
A juveniles jail
And I'm here locked up in their cage

School Daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time
School daze, school daze, my age is my crime
School daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time
School daze, school daze, I'm attending hell high

A blackboard jungle toed the line the rulers made
A homework hell-house screams at me - make the grade
Tick tock, three o'clock, I'm sitting here and counting off the days
A firebell is ringin' hell and I'd sure love to see it blaze - BURN IT DOWN!!

School Daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time
School daze, school daze, my age is my crime
School daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time
School daze, school daze, I'm attending hell high

I pledge no allegiance and I bet
They're gonna drive me crazy yet
Nobody here is understanding me
I pledge no allegiance and I bet
They're gonna drive me crazy yet
I'm dying here and trying to get free

School Daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time
School daze, school daze, my age is my crime
School daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time
School daze, school daze, I'm attending hell high
