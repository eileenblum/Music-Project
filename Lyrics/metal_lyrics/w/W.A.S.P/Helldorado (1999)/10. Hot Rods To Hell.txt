Pitch fork in my hands
Horns in my head
There ain't no more to say
I sold my soul a long time ago
That's the price I paid
It's alright, it's alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I made a deal
Signed and sealed
He took my soul to go
I met him down by the crossroads
Oh so long ago
It's alright, it's alright

Hot rods to hell take me to where
The Devil's there, Helldorado
Hot rods to hell, I'm going down
Forever there, Helldorado

I'm on the road yeah
I gotta go yeah
Gotta roll it down the way
I got it rolling yeah I say
It's alright, it's alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
On the road to Hell, gotta roll it
Helldorado gotta roll it
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah I'm gonna roll it
It's alright, it's alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gonna roll it baby, gonna roll it
Helldorado I'll roll it
Yeah, yeah
It's alright, it's alright
