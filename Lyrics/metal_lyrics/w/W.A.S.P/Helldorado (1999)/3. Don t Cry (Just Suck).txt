Tell me are you nasty
Then I got what you need
I'll show ya something dirty
Cause I'm perverse you see
Don't cry for mercy no, no
Cause I don't wanna know
No, not for nothing
I'll never let ya go

I'm gonna make you nasty
You'll be my little whore
Come on and do me until I'm red
Like a dick on a dog
Don't stop for nothing no, no
Cause I don't wanna know
No, not for nothing
I gotta let it go

Don't cry, just suck
And don't get no cramps in your tongue
Oh come on and do nasty, yeah!

Don't cry, it ain't much
No you're never too young
Oh do your nasty
All over me

I know, I know
Where you wanna be
Oh yeah
It's down on, down on
Down on your knees

I know, I know
You're no baby
Oh yeah
It's what you need
