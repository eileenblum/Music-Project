You see me, a man and machine
All my life so hungry and lean
Watch me bleed and I feel no pain
I'm going wild, and slowly insane

[REFRAIN:]
Mantronic, I'm on the loose
Bionic, my neck in the noose
Mantronic, I'm still the king
Bionic, half man and machine

One fast lane on top of the world
Balls of steel, mechanical pearls
I pay my dues and suffer alone
Feels like hell and cut to the bone

[REFRAIN:]

Be careful now
Because what you wish for
May just come true
If you look
Behind that door

[REFRAIN:]
