There's never a day,
That's passing my way
That I never need it
My hands on the wheel,
My foot's on the steel
'Cause I gotta feel it

[Refrain:]
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah

It blows through my veins
Like thunder and rain
And I can't live without it
I scream for the crowds,
And turn it up loud
'Cause I gotta shout it

[Refrain]

Six string and lightning strikes
Come make me blind
Ooh burn it up
Bring down the pedal to the metal

[Refrain]

Forever never stop
