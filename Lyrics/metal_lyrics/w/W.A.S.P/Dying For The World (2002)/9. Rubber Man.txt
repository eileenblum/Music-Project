The man of steal is
Master of lies
This rubber mother's
Tied to me for life
Heart breaker the snake
He'll do it to you
Oh he's killing me alive

I'm tied to rubber
I'm tied up for life

I'm dying from pain
Let me go
Here he comes I'm hiding my hole
Don't give me your grease
I'm dying for rubber
I'm dying from pain
I'm dying no
Don't give me your love
Get down on your knees
And give me your rubber

The son of Charlie
Morgue of liars
Don't let him get ya
Oh or he'll sodomize you
Ball breaker and raper'll
Do it to you
Rubber man's a fucking liar

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
