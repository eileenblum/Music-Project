There's a thousand voices in my head
Long ago
Come inside, see yourself tonight
Let me in, floating in the wind
Oh, I don't know
The sounds you hear
Are silent in the night

Take me down to the trail of tears
Where tomorrow never knows
A resurrection closer to a
Light I've never known
Play the game existence to the
Living end I go
Take me down to the trail of tears
Where tomorrow never knows

The lost road of destiny
I ride away home
Head to lay on velvet nails tonight
And will I lay down to close my eyes
Oh, I don't know
Spirit wind with broken wings to fly away home

[Repeat chorus]

My feet are raw from the
Trail where I've been
Oh God these tears are evermore
My heart is gone
Oh to never come again
I'll walk the stars
On my way home

[Repeat chorus]
