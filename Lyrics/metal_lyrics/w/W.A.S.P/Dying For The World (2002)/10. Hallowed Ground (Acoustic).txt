Come and take me down the dark beyond
And take me there where I come from
Take me down to the place where I'll kneel
And let me lay my shadow down
In through the eyes of a child's inner me
No pain to heal my bloodied brow
There is no rain to save this silent town
There is no rain to save at all
There is no place to save this silent ground
There is no place to save at all
Oh Father take me unto where I'll lay me down
On Hallowed Ground
Oh the sky is falling
And I don't know where my home is now
My Hallowed Ground
Oh and can you take me
For I have tasted Hallowed Ground
Oh all around
Father - do you hear me
This pain I will not cry aloud
Father - I know you hear me
My head is bludgeoned but unbowed
