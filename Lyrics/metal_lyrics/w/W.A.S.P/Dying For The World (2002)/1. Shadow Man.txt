Asleep in black
There's no light in the crack
The crooked fingers for you
No don't ya dare say a prayer
It's just the nights in your mare
Oh the long forever you'll do

No mercy - no coming back
No mercy - forever fade to black

Oh where's the god that made you
Oh you're superman
Going down forever - to never land
Oh where's the God you pray
Forsaken again
Never knew forever
The Shadow Man

Oh free at last
With a heart in the black
Forever shadowing you
Don't you swear to the terror
Your god never cares
Oh come oh whatever your do

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat chorus]

Where's the god that made you
Oh you're superman
Going down forever to never land
Don't runaway or hide again
No gates of Heaven
