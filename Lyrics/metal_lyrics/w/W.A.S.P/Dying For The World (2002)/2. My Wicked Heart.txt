Am I free
Am I done believing
Oh God Jehovah
I've never known religion
Lost in the darkness of my memories
Deep in the darkness of my heart
Coiled in the grasses that torment me
There lies my serpents in the dark

Father I'm here in the dark
And I know it's forever night
Ain't nothing gonna change forever
My wicked heart
Father I'm here in the dark
And I know my heart is the darkness
Oh tell me can you claim me never
My darkest heart

Am I too far beyond forgiving
A borrowed soul ain't never known believing
Lost in the dark can you forgive me
Deep in the darkness of my heart
Coiled in the grasses that torment me
There lies my serpents in the dark

[Repeat chorus]

Because nothing can change my wicked heart
Nothing can tame my wicked heart
Nothing unchains my wicked heart
