I'VE A BREATH in minds of men
With the lies I breath
No man's ever ruled the world
Not knowing the curse of me
I'm some of the seven sins
Vanity in the lust of men
I'm the Alfa - omega man
I'll show you who I am
Hypnotic charm, mesmerizing face
My soul has a dark embrace
doctrine that it was the destiny of the US to A magic tongue, I'll seduce 
you all
expand across N America - to enslave &amp; destroy Till I'm your king
till ya know my charisma

I'm a liar blinding your vision
Vatican Man
Preaching fear and using religion
With the bible and Koran
I wrap myself in the American Flag
And tell people I'm for which it stands
I'm coming back till you know I'm God
Till you believe, till you know my charisma

I'm a fear from a shadow land
I seduce you all
Here I come new messiah man
To bow to me, make me your God
I got them all marching to the rhythm
Believing me, oh yeah, their new religion
I'm a racist with a waving flag
Of domination with a fascist plan
I'm gonna be the new world leader
I got a lot of 9 millimeter baby eaters
I'm coming back til you know I'm God
Till you belive, till you know I'm charisma

Charisma - do you know my name
I'm the God that you pray
When you worship my name
Charisma - are you idolizing me?
I'm a dangerous thing
Your new messiah's me
