TELL ME NOW who slayed oh my
Little Baby Jane
Rolling down the stairs
Her Little head has rolled away
Put it in my hands
Cause it feels so bizarre
Can Baby Jane come out to play?
Show me all you got
You don't wanna know - No you don't
wanna know
No you don't wanna know -
No you don't wanna know
It wasn't me I know -
No you don't wanna know
Who slayed Baby Jane I know-
No you don't wanna know
No you don't wanna know -
No you don't wanna know
I wasn't me I know -
No you don't wanna know
Who slayed Baby Jane
Can I rock your cradle?
Oh, I love it when you scream
Oh, I love that fixed and dilated
Look that's in your eyes
I'll make you worse and more perverse
Than when you were alive
Oh, I'll wear her face
With a big demonic smile
If only she could scream
The she'd get me off tonight
No You don't wanna know -
No You don't wanna know
No You don't wanna know -
No You don't wanna know
I wasn't me I know -
No You don't wanna know
Who slayed Baby Jane I know -
No You don't wanna know
No You don't wanna know -
No You don't wanna know
I wasn't me I know -
No You don't wanna know
Who slayed Baby Jane
Can I rock your cradle
Oh, I'll love it when you scream

Goodbye Baby Jane
Who slayed Baby Jane
She's all right, it's alright oh my Janie

No it ain't so strange
You got no pain Baby Jane
So goodbye, goodbye oh my baby
