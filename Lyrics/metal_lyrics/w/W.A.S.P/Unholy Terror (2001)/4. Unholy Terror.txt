I WAS HERE when time began
I was in them all
A wicked one magician's hand
I'm what John had saw
I'm a thing that lives and breathers
With slaves to worship me
There are many that are born of me
Anytime there are many me's

Crowned messiah, I crucified him
And still ya don't believe
I am Kings - I am queens
Unholy terrors me

I'm the feces of the species
Still you're all in awe
I'm something a prophet saw
Hister with a rise all fall

Obsessed with Lennon
Manifested Marx
I'm incest in the hearts of dark
I'm riding on some atomic bomb -
To blind you all into King-dom-come--
I am - I am - I am - I am
