ANGEL OF ORLEANS in me
I'll tell you no lies
Ravens have bore me wings to fly
King of the night time forever
It's all I'm living for
I'll embrace my immortal
Forever night

One crimson kiss is bleeding
My raven heart
Tales of the darkside here is all right
Bring me the nighttime forever
It's all you're dying for
Take me hand and I'll show ya
Forever night
Raven - say you want me to
Rain the dark on forever you
Raven heart
No there ain't nothing dark that I won't do
My raven heart'll bleed all over you
