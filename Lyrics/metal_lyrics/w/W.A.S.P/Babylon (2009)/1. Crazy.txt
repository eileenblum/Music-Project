You look at me and
Think that you want me
Ooh love's a liar
That claims to be lonely

No, you're never gonna see
No, I'm never gonna be
What you want me
No, I'm never gonna feel
All you're ever gonna be's
Insane if you want me

You gotta be crazy to say you love me
No, I don't wanna know no, no
I don't wanna
I'm never letting you say, say you love me
No, I don't wanna know no, no
Don't ever let it show no, no

The heart's wicked wild
Ooh you can't hold me
Ooh lie to yourself
And think that you own me

You gotta be crazy to say you love me
No, I don't wanna know no, no
I don't wanna
I'm never letting you say, say you love me
No, I don't wanna know no, no
Don't ever let it show no, no

Not want you want
Never gonna be
You're never gonna see
I'm not want you want
I'm never gonna be
No you're never gonna see
I'm never gonna be
What you want me
You gotta be crazy to say you love me
No, I don't wanna know no, no
I don't wanna
I'm never letting you say, say you love me
No, don't ever tell me
Don't ever tell me no
No, no I, I said I know I
Oh I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
