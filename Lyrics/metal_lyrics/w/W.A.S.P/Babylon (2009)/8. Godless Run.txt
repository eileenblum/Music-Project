Lost on this road to be
Someone I would find
Pride for the fall to be
The heart becomes blind
I rise my eyes to see
A mirror that lied to me
Find time's gone and made me be
Afraid of the younger man
I used to be

I did not run to you
Lost on my road of ruin
I did not run to you
In my Godless run

Long had I gone to be
A slave to my eyes
Lost at that cross to kneel
Amazing grace saved my life

No, I cannot breath no more
No, I cannot breath no more
No, I cannot feel for sure
No,no  I cannot breath no more
Oh how long Lord
Did I kneel at the crossroads and run
Oh, bow down now
My king, my God I come

Oh I will not run from you
Lost on my road of ruin
No I will not run from you
In my Godless run
No, no I will not run
I'll not run, I will not run
Oh no, no I will not run from you
Oh no my Godless run
