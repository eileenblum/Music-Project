Look out baby
Time to wake up
Make up your bed
Storm's a coming
Got a fire that's right on your head

Oh, get up, get up, get off your knees
Get up, get up and rise
The seas are on fire
Oh, get up, get up get on your feet
Get up, get up tonight

Sky's on fire
And the hills are all running red
Babies crying there's a rider come for your head

Say hello to the judgment seat
Say good night, it's all right
Say hello to a fiery sea
The stars all fall down tonight

Sky's on fire
And the hills are running red
Babies crying there's a rider come for your head
