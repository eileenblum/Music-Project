There's a creature coming born
Of your pagan blessed
There is thunder coming down
Around your head
Ride the fire now momma
Thunder's come again
A soul to flame and rain down on ya
Red rider said

The hills are running red
Better hide under your bed
Hide your children mother
Thunder red
The hills are turning red
Get on your knees and beg
Thunder red's a-coming
Thunder red

You're reaping nothing more
Than your shamelessness
Then sew it all together
When he comes
Ride it down now momma
Fire's come again
Come to claim the souls to blame and
Riding off with them

The hills are running red
Better hide under your bed
Hide your children mother
Thunder red
The hills are turning red
Get on your knees and beg
Thunder red's a-coming
To get you red

Fathers and nuns, nowhere to run
Four horsemen riding on the wind
Momma hide your sons
Daddy get your gun
Four hooves of thunder's come again
Oh, run red

Red thunder's coming home
For your blamelessness
And rolling you forever in your dust
Ride the fire now momma
Thunder's coming again
Ain't no time to hide and cry, get
On your knees and beg
