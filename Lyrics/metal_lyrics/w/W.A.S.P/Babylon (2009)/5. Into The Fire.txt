Give it to me slow
Give now to me
Scream in my ear
Give it loud to me
Ooh come feel confusion
Its illusion it ain't real
Your love your lust
Could never feel
Their thief in my eyes
Oh I come to steal
Ooh I gave it all to you
Give it all to me

You gave into the fire
Don't blame it on me
Your devil's your desire now
No, ain't no shame on me
Give into the fire
Get down on your knees
And fame's your desire
Don't tell it, don't tell it to me

Your lust I can feel
don't cry my name
I don't wanna hear it
You passion, you pain
Ooh my name is fame
And I don't claim
To be real
I take it all from you
Give it all to me

You gave into the fire
Don't blame it on me
Your devil's your desire now
No, ain't no shame on me
Give into the fire
Get down on your knees
I don't want you to love me
Just give it all, give it all to me

Laid down in the fire
You gave into me
Face in desire, oh my
Shame ain't no thing to me
Led you to a liar
Never gonna see
Fed you to a lion, trying
See in me what you thought I'd be
Oh it's all about lust
Say what you will
Say it
Say fame's all you need
Say things you believe
Can you say that you don't need?
Say that you don't bleed?
You're burning up up up
Say you're up up up, take me
Up up celebrate me, made you take me
Made you break me
