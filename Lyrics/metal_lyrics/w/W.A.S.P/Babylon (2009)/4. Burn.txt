[DEEP PURPLE cover]

The sky is red I don't understand
Past midnight I still see the land
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
The city's a blaze the town's on fire
The woman's flames are reachin' higher
We were fools we called her liar all I hear is burn
I didn't believe she was devil's sperm
She said curse you all you'll never learn
When I leave there's no return
The people laughed til she said burn
Warning came no one cared
Earth was shakin' we stood and stared
When it came no one was spared still I hear burn
You know we had no time we could not even try
You know we had no time
You know we had no time we could not even try
You know we had no time
The sky is red I don't understand
Past midnight I still see the land
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
Warning came no one cared
Earth was shakin' we stood and stared
When it came no one was spared still I hear burn burn
