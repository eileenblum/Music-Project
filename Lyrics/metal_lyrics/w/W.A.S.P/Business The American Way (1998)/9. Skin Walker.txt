Show me once more, I cannot hide
Cause I am here now but I'm lost inside
Voices I hear but cannot see
Cause I will never be free

No good, darkened through, I walk this line
Skin walk my darkness, skin me alive

Two in me we can see who we are
Take me and rape me alone in the dark
Two inside there's a scream in my ear
Skin walk my head ain't no way out of here

Is there no corner where I can hide?
To suffer in the silence of my mind
Two in me we can see who we are
In my dark cranium

No good, darkened through, I walk this line
Skin walk my darkness, skin me alive

Two in me we can see who we are
Take me and rape me alone in the dark
Two inside there's a scream in my ear
Skin walk my head ain't no way out of here

Oh try to scream but I can't speak
Silent tongue of deceit
Oh the torture don't stop
My head's chained to the rock
Can you help me?
When I awake dreams have closed my eyes
Dancing shadows, black in my mind
It crawls my skin where I cannot see
Will I ever be free?

Two in me we can see who we are
Take me and rape me alone in the dark
Two inside there's a scream in my ear
Skin walk my head ain't no way out of here
