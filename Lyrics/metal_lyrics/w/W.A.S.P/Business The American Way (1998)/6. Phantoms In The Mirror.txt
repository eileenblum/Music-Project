Come look at me do you like what you see?
If you smash the mirror you'll still not be free
Look in the glass and you'll see who you are
And you'll run but you'll not run far
If you talk to me maybe I'll talk to you
We'll tell lies together but never the truth
Just you and me and I'll see what you do
You'll watch me, and I'm all over you

Come to the mirror my boy
I'm the face that you see
When the face isn't yours
A Phantom, I'm hiding inside
Yes I'm what you see
When you see in my eyes

My doctor said listen I'll help if I can
But you're psychosomatic so I'm not your man
The head doctor made me, give you what you need
Some sedation to stop what you see
But no one can help me
I hide in my room, but he moves and lets loose
My Four Doors of Doom
Just let me out, you'll see who I am
I'm controlling the man

Come to the mirror my boy
I'm the face that you see
When the face isn't yours
A Phantom, I'm hiding inside
Yes I'm what you see
When you see in my eyes

Don't act surprised
I see what you do
Can't let your....? And kill off the boy that's in you
Trust me you fool
The price that's inside you

Two will kneel
They can't see who they are
A reflection is cast
On a conscience of war
I am the mirror
The plaything of men
The true alter ego
The phantom within

Come to the mirror my boy
I'm the face that you see
When the face isn't yours
A Phantom, I'm hiding inside
Yes I'm what you see
When you see in my eyes
