A scream unlocks the cage
The roars rock the stage
Hunger of the animals are calling
Thrive upon the rage
Paw prints on the page
The room's going wild, walls are falling
Lights shine illumination bright
Reveal all the madness here tonight

Welcome, I bid you welcome to life
Inside the electric circus
Hang on, hang on for your life
The animals are all insane- God help us

Electricity to burn
Amplifiers churn
Three ring madhouse calls the action
It's life upon the road
Insane asylum grows
Night after night, the main attraction
A strange world that you might wanna know
When it comes alive- crank up the show

Welcome, I bid you welcome to life
Inside the electric circus
Hang on, hang on for your life
The animals are all insane- God help us

Welcome, I bid you welcome to life
Inside the electric circus
Hang on, hang on for your life
The animals are all insane- God help us

Welcome, I bid you welcome to life
Inside the electric circus
Hang on, hang on for your life
The animals are all insane- God help us
