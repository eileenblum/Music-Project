[Judah to Jesse] 

You'll be so far out of control 
You know, the ones you saved 

[Jesse to Judah] 

Look in my eye cause somehow you 
You don't realize what I made 

[Judah to Jesse] 

You can't run away from me 
Don't deny your blind believers 
And hide your Devil's keeper 

[Jesse to Judah] 

Take your love away from me 
Cause I will blind your heathen reason 
And ride us on your broken wings for love 

[Judah to Jesse] 

True we are disciples lost 
You know the promise you made 
Look in my eyes and tell me why 
You realize the price that you'll pay? 

[Jesse] 

# 9, # 9, # 9 
I'm still inside of 
The 9 asylums 
Am I Messiah? 

[Judah to Jesse] 

You're the only God they know 

What are you running from 
Wasn't this enough 
Aren't you satisfied? 
They're all at your feet 
The Lord to sheep 
Oh, are you sanctified?
