[Lawless]

There's a flame, flame in my heart
And there's no rain, can put it out
And there's a flame, it's burning in my heart
And there's no rain, ooh can put it out
So just hold me, hold me, hold me

Take away the pain, inside my soul
And I'm afraid, so all alone
Take away the pain, that's burning in my soul
'cause I'm afraid that I'll be all alone
So just hold me, hold me, hold me

Hold on to my heart, to my heart, to me
Hold on to my heart, to my heart, to me
Oh no, don't let me go 
'cause all I am you hold in your hands, 
Hold me and I'll make it through the night
I'll be alright, 
Hold on, hold on to my heart

Hold on to my heart, to my heart, to me
Hold on to my heart, to my heart, to me
Oh no, don't let me go 
'cause all I am you hold in your hands, 
Hold me and I'll make it through the night
I'll be alright

Hold on, hold on to my heart
