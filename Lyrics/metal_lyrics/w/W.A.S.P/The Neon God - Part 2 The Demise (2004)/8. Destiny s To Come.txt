[Judah to Jesse] There's a new world 
I see it, coming here after you 
If you knew where 
And when it was coming 
Maybe you'd know 
Know you're through 
New world, it's all been changing 
There's nothing you can do 
It's a new time 
Disciples arranging  
The Pay-Per-View end of you 

You were forewarned 
I'd betray you for everything 
That you'd do 
You're leaving this world 
Don't let me stop 
Your destruction of you 

Could you do more 
Oh, if only someone 
Ever loved you 
You could've been someone 
The world's waiting 
Oh, testament of your truth 

New day  
A new world is coming 
No Resurrection's due 
Oh, well give'em tickets 
To the crucifixion  
Oh, the last of you 

Goodbye my Neon Dion my Darkness 
My Neon God of Eden's so blind 
Because I wish away all of your sorrows 
I wash my hands of your life 
Ain't nothing that can change a thing 
Nothing can blame your death to be 
Nothing can change our destinies 
To come 
Destinies to come 
Destinies to come
