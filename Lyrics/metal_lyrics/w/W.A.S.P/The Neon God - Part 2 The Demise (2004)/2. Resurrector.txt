[Jesse to Congregation] Fall before me 
And bring me love 
In here we are all pagan 
Naked celebrations of 

[Disciples to Congregation] Oh, we are the dark descending 
Feel the magic  
The never ending son 
Oh, we are the lost ascending 
Last of Eden 
Never ending heathen love 

[Jesse to Congregation] Show me your  
Blind submissive love 
Paint my name across 
Your face in everlasting blood 

Won't you come to me 
Don't you believe in your god of love 
I'm your god you need 
I'll give you heathen love 

Oh won't you believe 
I come to breathe life into your doves 
And I'll make you see 
Make all believe neon 

[Congregation to Jesse] Change us all forever 
Claim us all for life 
Take us all to your heaven 
Change us all for love
