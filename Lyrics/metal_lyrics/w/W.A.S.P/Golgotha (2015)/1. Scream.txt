Was I your one, gonna love
Incense rising from your flame
To worship one and to run
Your gods of war are yours to blame
'Cause I want you to scream!
I want you to scream my name,
Come on and scream!
I want you to scream my name

Come on and scream if you love me and make it bleed if you want me,
Here comes heartbraker taking your heart
You gonna cry if you want me
You gonna lie if you love me
Ooh, Get up! Get up! Get up! Get out! 'cause I don't want to know

Do you believe, do you see the graven idol of your love
And pray to me and to feed and bow down to your dangerous God
'Cause I want you to scream!
I want you to scream my name
Come on and scream!
I want you to scream my name

Come on and scream if you love me and make it bleed if you want me.
Ooh, here comes heartbraker taking your heart
You gonna cry if you want me,
You gonna lie if you love me
Ooh, Get up! Get up! Get up! Get out! 'cause I don't want to know

No lies,
Ooh, no lies for you to feed
All we touch turns to dust, so helplessly
No eyes, oh no eyes could never see
No broken idols of mad passions make believe
No! No! No!

Ooh, scream my name (scream, scream, scream)

Come on and scream if you love me and make it bleed if you want me
Ooh, here comes heartbraker taking your heart
You gonna cry if you want me
You gonna lie if you love me
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get out! 'cause I don't want to know
Your eyes, no your eyes could never see
How long you gonna wait forever, idols of stone listen never NO!
