The morning glory poured down on me
Stars were in my eyes
Desperate a babe in teens I
was scared to death of
What I'd find

On borrowed beds of nails I wailed
And I'd lose control
So shamelessly so starved to be
Down this orphan's road

If time runs away tomorrow
There's nowhere left to hide
To the promised land 
The roads I ran
But nowhere left to ride

The last runaway tonight
Has come home
And I'm running from the night
Oh, from where I roamed
It was the best days of our lives now
The world was ours to run
The last runaway tonight
(The last runaways alive)
I'm coming home

The price of pride bled down on me
And ransomed my soul
A broken boulevard of dreams
Like misfits and their broken toys
A runaway a slave in chains
I'd lose control
So painlessly, so hard to see
Down this beggar's road

In the land of lost and make believe
We shelter from the cold
Lay down my head
And hear no voices
My face so bold
Turn my back
And feared redemption
Like a thief I stole
Escape this place to erase my shadow
Lord don't wanna lose my soul

And help me Lord to make it
This weights too great to lift my soul no more
Just one last chance to change it
Give me back my life I can't wait to live
Na, na, na, ooh, na, na ,na
Oh, na, na, na, ooh, na, na, na
