And so, again we meet
You've changed

I heaven't changed
You have changed!
I have not changed!

The idol, the great crimson king
You can't even see what you've become

Become what?
I have not fallen yet!

Oh, really?
You're dead, and don't even know it yet!
You just heaven't stopped breathing
It's 8:59 Jonathan
