I was born the orphan scorned
And raised to be some king
This throne I've known
I've wished on no one
A fool's crown I've reigned

I claimed the world
To lose my soul
Empty so it seems
A thousand ways to lose my tomorrows
Hanging from the headlines' screams

Hey mama, hey mama
Tell me why'd you make me
Hey mama, hey mama
Oh tell me why

I'm the lost boy
Can you help me?
Where is this love to save me
Come set me free
I'm the lost boy
Can you help me?
There's a son belongs to no one
Mama, it's me

Is it just the peace I seek
The truths between your lies
Hey mama, can you read me
From behind my crimson eyes

If there's a note that I last wrote
For all the world to see
"Dead noses smell no roses"
Hanging from my crimson strings

Hey mama, hey mama
Tell me why'd you make me
Hey mama, hey mama
Oh tell me why

I'm the lost boy
Can you help me?
Where is this love to save me
Come set me free
I'm the lost boy
Can you help me?
There's a son belongs to no one
Mama, it's me
