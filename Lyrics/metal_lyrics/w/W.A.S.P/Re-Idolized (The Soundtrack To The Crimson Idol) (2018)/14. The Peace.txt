Is there no soul that I can borrow
A way to be another me
Free of pain
All I want is
The peace I'm passing now
Save me from what I can't change

Show me one - ooh
Better world to come - ooh

Give me peace, give me hope, give me love
All I need in all my life
Love

Lord, when will we ever see
Wipe the sorrow from our eyes
And let me see
I lay my dreams
And the broken wings on peace
Down at your feet

Show me once - ooh
All I need is love - ooh

Give me peace in my life
Give me hope in my heart
Give me love
Give me peace in my life
Give me hope in my heart
Give me love

Can you free my soul?
Can you make me whole?
Will I ever love again?
Heal my broken heart
And maybe hope and wash
My forever tears away

Is there some soul now that I can borrow, yeah
And free me from this pain
All I want is
The peace that's lacking now
Some days of grace and pouring rain

Do you love me now
Do you want me how
To take away what I can't change

Is there love somehow
Is there hope for now
Unchain my breaking heart
