Demolition, mission-man
The old boy's hating me
I've become the one they warned me about
Oh he's gonna die before me

Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy
Long live, long live
Is there no love?

I am one
The side you see is the nasty me
I am one
Love
I am one
I got something to prove
And nothing to lose
Oh, I am one

18 bloody roses, each a year that bled my soul
18 and numb, I'm somebody's son
Mama, look what I've become

Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy
Long live, long live
Is there no love?

I am one
The side you see is the nasty me
I am one
Love
I am one
I got something to prove
And nothing to lose
Oh, I am one

Is there no love to shelter me?
Only love, love set me free
Is there no love to shelter me?
Only love, love set me free

Will he take me down to the gallows
And kill the boy inside the man?
I'm just a rock-and-roll nigger
I know he don't know what I am

I don't see my face in the mirror
Any more or understand
Why am I the chosen one
I'm the crimson man

Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy
Long live, long live
Is there no love?

I am one
The side you see is the nasty me
I am one
Love
I am one
I got something to prove
And nothing to lose
Oh, I am one

Oh, baby, this stuff is great
It's better than great: you do enough of this stuff and you can be a ... of the universe.
Jonathan, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Tania.
Jonathan, Jonathan, what the bloody hell is going on here?
Well, if it isn't the world-renowned Alex Rodney, the best manager money can buy?
You've got all the friends money can buy?
You know damn well you're supposed to be in the studio tomorrow and here you sit with these leeches all around you. You don't stop all this debauchery I'm leaving you. You got it? This little party is officially over. Get out, everybody, get out.

Hello?
