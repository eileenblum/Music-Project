Some people never go crazy
What truly boring lives they must lead?

Is there no love to shelter me?
Only love, love set me free
Where is the love to shelter me?
Only love, love set me free

I don't know where I'm going, but I can't wait to get there
All I know is I'm just going

I ran away from home last night, gone forever
I was running for my life
And I've heard the words of what I should be
Live, work, die,
I am the orphan of the night

Take me down, I'm coming home,
The road to ruins inside the pleasure dome
Take me down, I'm coming home,
Arena of pleasures where I belong

I'm in the eye of my rage, where no hurricane dies

I'm in the eye of my rage,
Where the hurricane lies
Oh, a storm's in my eyes
And like the beast that's in my soul,
I'm the restless child
Ah, mama, I'm running for my life

Take me down, I'm coming home,
The road to ruins inside the pleasure dome
Take me down, I'm coming home,
Arena of pleasures where I belong

I was sixteen going nowhere.
Will I see seventeen alive?
And I was running from the nightmare
I stand at the promised land with fire in my eyes

I'm at the crossroad of my destiny and desire
Oh, God, what will I be?
But my obsession is the gasoline to feed my fire
Oh, it's burning in me

Take me down, I'm coming home,
The road to ruins inside the pleasure dome
Take me down, I'm coming home,
Arena of pleasures where I belong

Don't waste the tears
On my wasted years
Mama, I'm outta here

The poisonous snakes with double tongues
Horny hedgehogs who do their wrong
Death men and blind worms they'll be not seen
They are pawns and rooks for a crimson king
They are the government with a parliament of whores
Can you hear the screams from the fame machine
Down in Chainsaw Charlie's morgue?
