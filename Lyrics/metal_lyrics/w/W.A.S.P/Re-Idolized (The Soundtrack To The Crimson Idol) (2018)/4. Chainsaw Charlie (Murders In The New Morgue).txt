[Charlie to Jonathan:]
O.K., boy, now here's your deal
Will you gamble your life?
Sign right here on the dotted line
It's the one you've waited for all of your life

[Jonathan to Charlie:]
Ah, will it feed my hunger
If I swallow lies right down my throat?
Or will it choke me 'til I'm raw?
And tomorrow when I'm gone
Will they whore my image on?
I'll will my throne away
To a virgin heir and Charlie's slave

[Jonathan:]
Murders, murders in the new morgue
Murders, murders in the new morgue
See old Charlie
And the platinum army's
Making me their boy
Murders, murders in the new morgue
Murders, murders in the new morgue
He'll make you scream
For the cash machine
Down in Chainsaw Charlie's morgue

[Charlie to Jonathan:]
We'll sell your flesh by the pound you'll go
A whore of wrath just like me
We'll sell you wholesale, we'll sell your soul
Strap on your six-string and feed our machine

[Jonathan to Charlie:]
Ah, will it feed my hunger
If I swallow lies right down my throat?
Or will it choke me 'til I'm raw?
And tomorrow when I'm gone
Will they whore my image on?
I'll will my throne away
To a virgin heir and Charlie's slave

[Jonathan:]
Murders, murders in the new morgue
Murders, murders in the new morgue
See old Charlie
And the platinum army's
Making me their boy
Murders, murders in the new morgue
Murders, murders in the new morgue
He'll make you scream
For the cash machine
Down in Chainsaw Charlie's morgue

[Charlie to Jonathan:]
Welcome to the morgue, boy
Where the music comes to die
Welcome to the morgue, son
I'll cut your throat just to stay alive

Ah, trust me, boy
I won't steer you wrong
If you trust me, son
You won't last very long

[Charlie to Jonathan:]
I'm the president of showbiz.
My name is Charlie
I'm a blood-sucking rat's hole.
That's what they call me
Here from my Hollywood tower I rule
I'm a liar with a monster.
The chainsaw's my tool

The new morgue's our factory to grease our lies
Our machine is hungry.
It needs your life
Don't mind the maggots and the ruthless scum
Before we're done, son, we'll make you one

I'm the tin man.
No, I've never had a heart
I'm the tin man,
But I'll make you a star

I'm the tin man,
No, I've never had a heart
I'm the tin man

[Jonathan:]
Murders, murders in the new morgue
Murders, murders in the new morgue
See old Charlie
And the platinum army's
Making me their boy
Murders, murders in the new morgue
Murders, murders in the new morgue
He'll make ya scream
For the cash machine
Down in Chainsaw Charlie's morgue
