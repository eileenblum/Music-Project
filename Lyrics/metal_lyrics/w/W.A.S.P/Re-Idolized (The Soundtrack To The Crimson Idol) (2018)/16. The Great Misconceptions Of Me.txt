[Jonathan to the audience:]
Welcome to the show the great finale's finally here
I thank you for coming into my theatre of fear
Welcome to the show, you're all witnesses you see
A privileged invitation to the last rights of me

[Jonathan to his mother:]
Remember me? You can't save me
Mama you never needed me
No crimson king, look in my eyes, you'll see
Mama I'm lonely, it's only me, only me

[Jonathan to all:]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million eyes, of a million

[Jonathan to all:]
I am the prisoner of the paradise I dreamed
The idol of a million lonely faces look at me
Behind the mask of sorrow, four doors of doom behind my eyes
I've got their footprints all across my crimson mind

[Jonathan to the king of mercy:]
Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy
Long live, long live

[Jonathan to all:]
There is no love to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
No love to shelter me
Only love, love set me free

[Jonathan to all:]
I was the warrior, with an anthem in my soul
The idol of eight thousand lonely days of rage ago
And remember me when it comes your time to choose
Be careful what you wish for, it might come true

[Jonathan to the king of mercy:]
Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy
Long live, long live

[Jonathan to all:]
There is no love to shelter me
Only love, love set me free
No love to shelter me
Only love, love set me free

[Jonathan to his father:]
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy
The straps cross my back

Red, crimson red, no, I was never to be
Only one crimson son, no, it never was me

[Jonathan to all:]
Living in the limelight little did I know
I was dying in the shadows and the mirror was my soul
It was all I ever wanted, everything I dreamed
But the dream became my nightmare
No-one could hear me scream

With these six-strings, I make a noose
To take my life, it's time to choose
The headlines read of my demise, of my suicide
My suicide

[Jonathan to the king of mercy:]
Oh sweet silence, where is the sting
I am no idol, no crimson king
I'm the impostor, the world has seen
My father was the idol, it was never me

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, no I don't wanna be
The crimson idol of a million eyes

[Jonathan to all:]
No love to shelter me, only love
Love set me free
No love to shelter me, only love
Love set me free
