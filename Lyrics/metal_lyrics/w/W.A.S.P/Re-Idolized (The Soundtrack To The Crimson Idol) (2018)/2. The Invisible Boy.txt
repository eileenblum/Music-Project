[Jonathan:]
I was the boy unwanted, a prisoner I'm born to them
My brother was the one, that couldn't do no wrong
And I was there dying in the shadow of him

[Jonathan to his father:]
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?
Feel the strap, cross my back
Yeah I'm the new whipping boy
Who am I
The orphan son you would never need?
Who am I
'Cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees
Who am I
The slave you gave just the air I breathe?
Who am I
'Cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees

[Jonathan:]
Oh I got the same old reruns, horror movies in my head
And I can't rest, they scare me to death
But if I'm not alive, how can I be dead?

[Jonathan to his father:]
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?
Feel the strap, cross my back
Yeah I'm the new whipping boy
Who am I
The orphan son you would never need?
Who am I
'Cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees
Who am I
The slave you gave just the air I breathe?
Who am I
'Cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees

[Jonathan to the mirror:]
Oh, why me?

[The mirror:]
Why him

[Jonathan:]
Can you tell me?

[The mirror:]
It's confession again?
Come talk to me, I see in your eyes
Titanic misery, ashamed that you're alive
I'm the face that you see
When the face isn't yours
I'm the mirror my boy

[Jonathan to his father:]
Who am I?
The orphan son you would never need?
Who am I?
'Cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees
Who am I?
The slave you gave just the air I breathe?
Who am I?
'Cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees
