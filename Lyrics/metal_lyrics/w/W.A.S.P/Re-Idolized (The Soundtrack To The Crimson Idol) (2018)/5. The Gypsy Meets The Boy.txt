[Jonathan:]
"The tarot is fate," said the gypsy queen
And she beckoned me to glimpse my future she'd seen

She said,

[Gypsy to Jonathan:]
"Do you see what I see? Be careful to choose.
Be careful what you wish for, 'cause it may come true.
When I lay the card down will it turn up the fool?
Will it turn up sorrow? If it does then you lose."

[Jonathan to the Gypsy:]
I'm the lost boy. Can you help me?
Yeah, I'm the lost boy. Can you help me?

Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan.

[Gypsy to Jonathan:]
Then the illusion was real. A crimson idol I saw
But the higher he'd fly, then the further he'd fall

She said,

[Gypsy to Jonathan:]
"Do you see what I see? Be careful to choose.
Be careful what you wish for, 'cause it may come true.
When I lay the card down will it turn up the fool?
Will it turn up sorrow? If it does then you lose."

[Jonathan to the Gypsy:]
I'm the lost boy. Can you help me?
Yeah, I'm the lost boy. Can you help me?

[Jonathan to the Gypsy:]
I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be
The crimson idol of a million
I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be
The crimson idol of a million eyes
Of a million
