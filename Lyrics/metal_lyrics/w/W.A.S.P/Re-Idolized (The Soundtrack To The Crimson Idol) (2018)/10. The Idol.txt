Will I be alone this morning
Will I need my friends
Something just to ease away my pain

And no one ever sees the loneliness
Behind my face
I am just a prisoner to my fame

If I could only stand and stare in the mirror could I see
One fallen hero with a face like me

And if I scream, could anybody hear me?
If I smash the silence, you'll see what fame has done to me

Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
I'll never know if love's a lie
Ooh, being crazy in paradise is easy
Do you see the prisoners in my eyes?

Where is the love to shelter me?
Give me love, come set me free
Where is the love to shelter me?
Only love, love set me free
Set me free

Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely
I'll never know if love's a lie
Ooh, being crazy in paradise is easy
Do you see the prisoners in my eyes?

Where is the love to shelter me?
Give me love, come set me free
Where is the love to shelter me?
Only love, love set me free
Set me free

I had finally made it to the top of the mountain, but when I got there, I looked around: there was nothing there.
