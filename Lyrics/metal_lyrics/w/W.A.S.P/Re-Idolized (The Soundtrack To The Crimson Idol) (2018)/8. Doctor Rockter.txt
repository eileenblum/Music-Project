[Jonathan:]
He's the king of sting,
Mr. Morphine, my friend
Uncle Slam, the medicine man
And I'm a junkie
With a big King-Kong-sized monkey
Crawling up and down my back

[Doctor Rockter:]
Oh, I'll help you, son, to rearrange your mind
Oh, I'll help you, son, but you gotta buy this time
I'm your doctor

[Jonathan to Doctor:]
Help me please, oh Doctor, help me please
Doctor Rockter, you know I need you
Doctor please, my M.D.,
Fix me in my time of need
But can ya see the fire that's in my eyes

[Jonathan:]
It's the mirror from the wall, it's on the table
Feeding me little white lies
And I'm wasted in a wasteland, I'm a junk man
I got tombstones in my eyes

[Doctor Rockter:]
Oh, I'll help you, son, to rearrange your mind
Oh, I'll help you, son, but ya gotta buy this time
I'm your doctor

Help me please, oh Doctor, help me please
Doctor Rockter, you know I need you
Doctor please, my M.D.,
Fix me in my time of need
But can ya see the fire that's in my eyes

Ah, help me, Uncle Slam,
The beast claims another man

Codeine, Cocaine, 714,
A Tuinol blindfold just what I need
Help me, help me, help me

Help me please, oh Doctor, help me please
Doctor Rockter, you know I need you
Doctor please, my M.D.,
Fix me in my time of need
But can ya see the fire that's in my eyes
