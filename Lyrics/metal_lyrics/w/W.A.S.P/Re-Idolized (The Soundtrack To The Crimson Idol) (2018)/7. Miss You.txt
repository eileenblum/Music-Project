Lost inside a room
A priest at the door with news
Said you're gone
Now I knew
My world was broken in two
I pray that you were here
To hold my heart
I'd hide myself in your bed
And cry myself numb

Oh, God, I miss you
Tell me can you hear me
Oh, God, I miss you
Can't scream and I can't speak
Show me now
Will I ever be free from you?

Lost inside my head
I closed my eyes and fled
No pain
No gain
No death no more
I drown myself in flesh
Is there no way out
No way how
Would you even know me now?
I've found this thing that I make sing
Can you hear me now?

Oh, God, I miss you
Tell me can you hear me?
Oh, God, I miss you
I can't scream and I can't speak
Show me how
Will I ever be free from you?

Oh, God, I miss you
Tell me can you hear me?
Oh, God, I miss you
Can't scream and I can't speak
Show me now
Will I ever be free from you?
Oh, God, I miss you

Why did you go and leave
Now I'm running away from my home
No they'll never know I'm gone
You don't know how
Know how

Should I kneel here and pray
When there's no one to save
Is there no one to show me love
Where are you now?

Can you hear me now?
Can you see somehow?
Is there no love from your great beyond?
Can you hear me now?

Oh, God, I miss you
Tell me can you hear me?
Oh, God, I miss you
I can't scream and I can't speak
Show me now
Will I ever be free from you?

Oh, God, I miss you
Tell me can you hear me?
Oh, God, I miss you
Can't scream and I can't speak
Tell me how?
Will I ever be free from you?
