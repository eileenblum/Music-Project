[BONUS TRACK]

Big mondo fun, the land of the rising sun
A monster rising in my eyes
My eyes are red with blood
And I can't see the sun
Come with me and you're gonna die

There ain't nowhere to run
Tokyo's gonna burn
The devil is here in my eyes
And you better run Banzi Itchi-Ban
Cause Tokyo is burning all night

Itchi-Ban of sin I'll be the night time king
Take me to the devil's hole
And let me feel your roar
Your demon alcohol
My monster ain't got no control

There ain't nowhere to run
Tokyo's gonna burn
The devil is here in my eyes
And you better run Banzi Itchi-Ban
Cause Tokyo is burning all night

Tokyo's on fire
Tokyo's on fire
Tokyo's on fire

There ain't nowhere to run
Tokyo's gonna burn
The devil is here in my eyes
And you better run Banzi Itchi-Ban
Cause Tokyo is burning all night

Tokyo's on fire
Tokyo's on fire
Tokyo's on fire
