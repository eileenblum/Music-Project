Lead your forehead into my kiss
Embrace me, careful darkness
All the love fades away
Little Death's reflections of
Who's the darkest motherfucker on the planet
Fiction tied to death I know I am it
Immortal love

Hey, Hey, Hey, Wanna set you free
Hey, Hey, Hey, Would you die for me

Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, Oh, Oh
Fuck it up to death it ain't so tragic, no.....

Hatred will, immortal wings
Vampires and Blackened Children
Kiss of the blood from my lips
Death we are, death we've always been
Who's the darkest motherfucker on the planet
Just so close to death I know I am it
One Demon son

Hey, Hey, Hey, Wanna set you free
Hey, Hey, Hey, Would you die for me

Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, oh, oh
Fuck it up to death it ain't so tragic, no....
Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, Ahhh gimme something
Come feel young and special gas of magic

Lead your forehead, into my kiss
Embrace me a careful darkness
Death we are, death we've always been
Who's the darkest motherfucker
Lead your forehead, into my kiss
Embrace me a careful darkness
Death we are, death we've always been
Who's the darkest motherfucker

Who's the darkest motherfucker
Darkest motherfucker on the planet
Just so close to death I know I am it
Demon son

Hey, Hey, Hey, Wanna set you free
Hey, Hey, Hey, Would you die for me

Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, oh, oh
Fuck it up to death it ain't so tragic, no....
Gimme Little Death it's so romantic, Ahhh gimme something
Come feel young and special gas of magic
