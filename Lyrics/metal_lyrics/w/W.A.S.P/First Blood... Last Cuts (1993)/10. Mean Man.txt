A tattooed madman, I am hell on wheels
Born a wicked child left alone in the fields
My father was the wind, my mother was fire
Raised by the wolves and I grew up wild
A kamikaze man, a hollering 'Banzai'
Never crash and burn, never gonna die
Cannibal it's me, you squeal and shout
I chew you up and spit you out

Storms a c-c-coming and it's gonna be me
Here comes Trouble with a capital "T"

'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all the way
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned
All they way, all the way, all the way

Chewbacca in the rye, the water of fire
A terror in the flesh, a killer for hire
California man I'm white line, "Homer"
The unruly one they call the "Blond Bomber"
Scooter gypsy, I'm a renegade
An orphan of the road, a live hand grenade
Never gonna quit before my time
When the moon gets high then I'll be blind
Mad dog 20-20's king
I drink that stuff and start getting obscene

'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all the way
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned

I'm a motorcycle man
Don't never give a damn
I lie when the truth serves better
The Marquis de Sade, I cheat and steal and rob
A heavy metal creature
All the way, all the way, all the way

'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all the way
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned
All they way, all the way, all the way
