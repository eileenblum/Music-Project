Father come save us from this madness we're under
God of creation are we blind?
Cause some here are slaves that worship guns that spit thunder
The children that you've made have lost their minds

This monster that we call the earth is bleeding
Cause the children have been left alone too long
This thing that we've made is fat and feeds on the hate
Of the millions that it's taught to sing the song

The Headless Children
The screams that fill the night, fill the night, fill the night, fill the night
The Headless Children
The madness steals the light, steals the light, steals the light, steals the light

Time bombs in the hands of all the wicked war babies
Light the fuse of temptation and we all burn
Four horsemen sit high up in the saddle
And waiting and ride the bloody trail of no return

Sleeping in the arms of a nightmare
And wake to find we've been away too long
This Frankenstein of flesh stitched together back from death
And preying on the souls of everyone

The Headless Children
The screams that fill the night, fill the night, fill the night, fill the night
The Headless Children
The madness steals the light, steals the light, steals the light, steals the light
