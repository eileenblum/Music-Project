Donât try to hide it from me
Itâs in your eyes and easy to see
That you are fighting so hard
You keep trying to touch me
But tell me how much we need to cry âtil the tears come to an end
I hate to know why we must still pretend

I know what weâll get burned
Branded with the letter A
We got what we deserved, oh
The red letter A

I know what I should do
But I canât tell you that we are thru
Too many lonely sleepless nights
Iâve been waiting for someone
To tell me that we are done
Feels so right and still it is so wrong
Just one night Iâd need to stay strong

I know what weâll get burned
Branded with the letter A
We got what we deserved, oh
The red letter A

I know what weâll get burned
Branded with the letter A
We got what we deserved, oh
The red letter A
