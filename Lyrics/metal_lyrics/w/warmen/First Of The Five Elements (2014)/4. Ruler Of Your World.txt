If I could back time thereâs a lot of things I would do
I wouldnât waste my time on living my life with you
Your constant need to put me down in your only reality
It has made me sick driving me in to insanity

When the time has come to get rid of you
I wonât do it nice or clean
Your chance to feel the pain and get what is due
Itâs my time to be the king

Now the time has come for me to lay down the rules
I have been living a life that has been narrated by fools
The plan is now in motion â thereâs nothing more you can do
Youâll wish youâd never met me, I tell you that much is true

When the time has come to get rid of you
I wonât do it nice or clean
Your chance to feel the pain and get what is due
Itâs my time to be the king
Iâm the ruler of your world
