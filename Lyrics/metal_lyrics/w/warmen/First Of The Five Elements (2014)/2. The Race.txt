I have walked in the valley of dead
And seen the twisted sign
I have talked with the demons of Hell
Didnât know what I would find
I have heard the whispers of the night
That we would actually do
But the only thing that keeps me alive
Is the thought of you

Too many places
Too many faces
So many times I tried to live
And just say ânoâ

I have tried to be someone else
Someone who is good and kind
I have tried the night of the night
Thinking I would lose my mind
I have said this is the last time
And last time will never come
But I know I am what I am
And when you win you lose âem

Too many clumsies
Too many chances
So many times I tried to live
And just say no

Iâm on the run
To seal my sun (oh...)
I hate what I become (oh...)
There is no reason why I feel this way (oh...)
The race has just begun

Too many places
Too many faces
So many times I tried to live, no...

Too many clumsies
Too many chances
So many times I tried to live
And just say ânoâ

Iâm on the run
To seal my sun (oh...)
I hate what I become (oh...)
There is no reason why I feel this way (oh...)
The race has just begun
