Here she comes with a smile and deception in her eyes
Nothing is what it seems, sheâs the devil in disguise
Youâre blinded by her innocence, believing all the lies
Sheâs not revealing her wicked mind
Everything she touches dies

Sheâs as cold as ice
Sheâs the darkness, sheâs the night, the killer of the light
Sheâs the bringer of misery
Sheâs gonna steal your soul, sheâs your destiny
Everything she does is mean

Youâre the king of the fools
You didnât see it coming, oh...
(Donât try to hide)
Sheâs gonna make you cry
You donât even know why!

No matter how you try, sheâs always on your mind
False hope deceit and lies it all has made you blind
No matter how you try, sheâs always on your mind

With her crushing blow you will find and wish that you would die
Youâve been suffering for a long time
You have lost your will to fight
Now you know that your time has come everything you had she stole
Her deception has got to you, she has killed your soul

Sheâs as cold as ice
Sheâs the darkness, sheâs the night, the killer of the light

Youâre the king of the fools
You didnât see it coming, oh...
(Donât try to hide)
Sheâs gonna make you cry!
You donât even know why!

No matter how you try, sheâs always on your mind
False hope deceit and lies it all has made you blind
No matter how you try, sheâs always on your mind
