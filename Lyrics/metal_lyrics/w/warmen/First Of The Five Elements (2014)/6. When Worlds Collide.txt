They knocked on the sky today
A few had heard the sound it gave
Something had answered back
An unseen divide

They wish for a chance to see
Some unknown dark entity
Knowing are at a place
Where two worlds collide

Standing against a threat
Unsure how it all could end
Neither will make a move
Only one can survive

They could not bring themselves to fight
It wouldnât be justified
Both knowing how it would end
When two worlds collide will collide

No time to live, no time to die
When worlds collide
Our time to live, our time to die
Will the world survive?

No time to live, no time to die
When worlds collide
Our time to live, our time to die
Will the world survive?

No time to live, no time to die
When worlds collide
Our time to live, our time to die
Will the world survive?
