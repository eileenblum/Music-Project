[originally by Alice Cooper]Youâre with your baby
And youâre parked alone
On a summer night
Youâre deep in love
But youâre deeper in the woods
You think youâre doing alright

Did you hear that voice?
Did you see that face?
Or was it just a dream?
This canât be real
That only happens, babe
On the movie screen

Oh, but heâs back
Heâs the man behind the mask
And heâs out of control
Heâs back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole

Youâre swimming with your girl
Out on loversâ lake
And the wind blows cold
It chills your bones
But youâre still on the make
Thatâs a bad mistake

But the moon was full
And you had a chance to be all alone
But youâre not alone
This is your last dance
And your last romance

Oh, but heâs back
Heâs the man behind the mask
And heâs out of control
Heâs back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole

If you see him coming
Get away if you can
Just keep on running
Run as fast as you can
Heâs a dangerous, dangerous man

And heâs out tonight
And heâs watching you
And he knows your house
No, donât turn out the lights

Oh, but heâs back
Heâs the man behind the mask
And heâs out of control
Heâs back
The man behind the mask
And heâs after your soul
Heâs back
Heâs the man behind the mask
And heâs out of control
Heâs back
The man behind the mask
And heâs after your soul
Heâs back
Heâs the man behind the mask
And heâs out of control
Heâs back
The man behind the mask
And heâs after your soul
