[Janet Jackson cover]

All the lonely nights I spend alone
Never 'round to love me, you're always gone
'cause you're hangin' out, breakin' the rules
Oh the man has come lookin' for you

You're a rebel now, don't give a damn
Always carrying on with the gang
I'm tryin' to tell ya boy, it's a mistake
You won't realize 'til it's too late

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Black cat nine lives, short days long nights
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die
Heart beat real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

You're so together boy
But just at a glance
You'll do anything
If given the chance

Scheming, plannin' lies
To get what you need
So full of promises
That you never keep

Don't you tell yourself
That it's okay
Sick and tired of
All of your games
And you want me to stay
(aww) Better change
Makes no sense to me
Your crazy ways
