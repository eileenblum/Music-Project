Don't ask for the reasons why
I will turn every truth into a lie
I am sinful by nature
I have no regret, I only aim to please

You are looking for sympathy
Dim the lights, feeling only the breeze
Set your worries aside for now
And come with me into the dead of night
I can take away reality for a day
Wiping out the fear that makes you insane
I'm the Devil's Mistress
Follow me and I'll make everything right

Await a moment
You can see how it all could be
I am here to save you from
Your weak and frailed mortality
And I offer you salvation
In my deep and endless dream
Now you know the reason why
I have turned every truth into a lie
It's the sin in my nature
I have no regret, I only aim to please
I will give you my sympathy
Dim the lights, feeling me with the breeze
All your worries have disappeared
So stay with me forever in twilight
