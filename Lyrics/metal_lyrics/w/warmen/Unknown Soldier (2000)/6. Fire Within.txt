I can't take it anymore
So this is the end
Cam you feel my fire
That is burning within?
I have broken every chain
That you have put me in
I am free, so now it's
Time to let it begin
They're not worth the pain
Slit my wrist again!

Broken glass the key
To find my final release
Jagged edge upon my flesh
It feels so complete I've been searching so long
For a way out of here
Eyes wide open now it
All seems perfectly clear
Take my hand and join me
There is nothing to fear
Die with me my love
And we'll forever be near
The only way to be free
