My casket stands alone in the rain
Even after I'm gone, I'm forgotten and ignored
I never thought it would end like this
I had nothing to give, the world abandoned me

So I just threw it all away
I couldn't take another day
This was meant to be

I hoped I'd leave a legacy
I guess it was only a dream,
A wish left unfulfilled.

Where did it it all go wrong for me?
I guess I was blinded by pain
That burned inside my heart

So I just threw it all away
I couldn't take another day
This was meant to be

I'm soaring high above the clouds,
Where the rain can't fall upon my dreams anymore

I step into the afterlife
And start all over again
The beginning of my end

I'll make some changes on my way
So they'll remember me now
As it's drawing to a close

So I just threw it all away
I couldn't take another day
This was meant to be

I'm soaring high above the clouds
Where the rain can't fall upon my dreams anymore

And overhead I see a light 
It is pulling me so close
I feel so heavenly

I'm soaring high above the clouds
Where the rain can't fall upon my dreams anymore

And overhead I see a light 
It is pulling me so close
I feel so heavenly
