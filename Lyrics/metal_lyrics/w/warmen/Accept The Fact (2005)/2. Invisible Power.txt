As I close my eyes
It's like opening them for real
I'm not in disguise
I'm not lying 'bout what I feel

No need to hide
There's no-one that can hurt me
The strippings inside are
Opening up to fly free

Invisible power
Is growing stronger each night
Invisible power
It's taking a hold of me tight

So many years
I wasted on vain tears
I drift away
To reach the surface of the dream
Come what ever may today
I feel I am supreme
