You give a kid some candy
He will always ask for more
You give a man some power
And off he goes to war
So many strings tightly attached
He seems like he is lost
He makes a fine new decision
Whatever be the cost

I see images that cull
Up on our deepest fears
Just when all seems well
The puppet appears

Take me to silence
I don't want to hear
Bring me to blindness
I don't need to see

He'll pay no heed to his neighbour
He'll pay the price to rule
Only greed will bring him pleasure
And make him king of fools
