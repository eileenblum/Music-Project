Look at me mess we've made
Open your eyes to see
This endless gap through eternity
Waisting the flame of time

Elbowing through your life
Your heart is not a home of sad regrets

Sounds of the new dawn
Hanging in the air
Just too faint for you to hear

Leave your life in our hands and you'll see
We'll consume more than you could ever give
Forsaken into the waters of Lethe

Lost in the golden age
Drowning your soul to hate
You'll never make it to the final straight
