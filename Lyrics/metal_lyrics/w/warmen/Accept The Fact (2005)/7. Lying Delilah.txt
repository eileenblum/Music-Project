I know you're a hurting kind
You shone to blind my eyes
Smooth words and soothing lines
Sweet smile concealing a lie

Calling me lunatic
You claim that I am crazy and sick
Casting hooks into ym soul
Forcing under your control

Lying Delilah
My truth shall make you free
Lying Delilah
I may let you live, if you kneel
Lying Delilah
I'll make you bleed

You need security
A wall surrounding your privacy
You are laughing in your dreams
Until I wake u to make u weep

Anyone could feel the fear
Underneath your frozen mien
Now is the time to reveal
Every turn of this intrigue
