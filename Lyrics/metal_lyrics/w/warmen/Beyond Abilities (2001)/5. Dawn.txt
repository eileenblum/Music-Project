You think your life is gone.
There is no reason to be.
Thinking all the time that same thing:
"What am I doing here?"
Stop thinking like that!
Get yourself together
Or I shall kick that shit out of you!

It's easy for you to say!
You don't know what I am dealing with.
I have tried "nostrums" and shrinks
"No effect for me."
I am too tired for this normal bullshit.
Just leave me alone!

May you live to see the dawn?
A new day will come, you'll be reborn.

Oh! What a loser!
What has happened to you?
You are not the same person I used to know!
Motherfucker!
Let those nightmares go and
give yourself a second chance 
because you deserve it!

May you live to see the dawn?
A new day will come, you'll be reborn.

You search for your destiny from a crystal ball...
You will find your path, when your time has come...

May you live to see the dawn?
A new day will come, you'll be reborn.
May you live to see the dawn?
A new day will come, you'll be reborn.
[Repeat]
