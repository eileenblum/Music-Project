[Originally performed by Heart]

I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
no answer on the telephone
and the night goes by so very slow
oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
and now it chills me to the bone
how do I get you alone
how do I get you alone

You don't know how long I have wanted
to touch your lips and hold you tight
oh, you don't know how long I have waited
and I was going to tell you tonight
but the secret is still my own
and my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
and now it chills me to the bone
how do I get you alone
how do I get you alone
Alone...

How do I get you alone
how do I get you alone
Alone...
Alone...
