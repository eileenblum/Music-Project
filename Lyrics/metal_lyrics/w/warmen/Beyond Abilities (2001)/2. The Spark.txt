I feel the pressure building up
I've been waiting for the sign
Will it come?
Will it be something divine?
Another day has just begun
Still my mind's empty nothing's done
Should I run away from the city?
Or go to the bar and have some fun

Once again I need to find the spark
I will search all night long
Even though I need to wonder in the dark
I know I have to finish this song

The day is over the paper's empty
I have to ask advice from Mr. Beer
He shows me some of his visions
And suddenly everything is so clear

Once again I need to find the spark
I will search all night long
Even though I need to wonder in the dark
I know I have to finish this song

Once again I need to find the spark
I will search all night long
Even though I need to wonder in the dark
I know I have to finish this song
[Repeat]
