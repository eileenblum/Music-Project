Waking up into reality
Fading away from a dream
A shelter for me
Listening to the voices through the wall
Trying to figure out the place
Where I am though I've seen them all

Remembering yesterday
How we pulled it off again
And later hit the highway

As I take the stage I realize
That my life has meaning

Here I am
I have to sing it out
The feelings I had have inside 
for so many years
Here is my chance
I have to take it
Reaching out to the people
Who have come to see the show

I see the hands in the air
Feeling the energy
That we share

When the day is done
And I'm on my own
I feel tired and satisfied

Here I am
I have to sing it out
The feelings I had have inside 
for so many years
Here is my chance
I have to take it
Reaching out to the people
Who have come to see the show

I see the hands in the air
Feeling the energy
That we share

When the day is done
And I'm on my own
I feel tired and satisfied

Here I am
I have to sing it out
The feelings I had have inside 
for so many years
Here is my chance
I have to take it
Reaching out to the people
Who have come to see the show
