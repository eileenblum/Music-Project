She's running scared doesn't dare to confess her sins
So unaware of the danger that she is in
moved on ahead, never tried turning back for you

She ignores all the signs, head faced to the ground
Catching up for the kill, waste no time

Every day she tried to stray towards the evil within her, yeah
The darkness feeds on her greed and it's taking the form of her insanity
Losing control takes a toll on goodness within her, yeah
Forget the past gone at last and look to the extinction of humanity

As time goes by she must lie to protect her name
The enemy chose to see this is just a game
Fatal mistake now they pray as they beg for mercy

She ignores all the signs, head faced to the ground
Catching up for the kill, waste no time

Every day she tried to stray towards the evil within her, yeah
The darkness feeds on her greed and it's taking the form of her insanity
Losing control takes a toll on goodness within her, yeah
Forget the past gone at last and look to the extinction of humanity

Every day she tried to stray towards the evil within her, yeah
The darkness feeds on her greed and it's taking the form of her insanity
Losing control takes a toll on goodness within her, yeah
Forget the past gone at last and look to the extinction of humanity
[Repeat]
