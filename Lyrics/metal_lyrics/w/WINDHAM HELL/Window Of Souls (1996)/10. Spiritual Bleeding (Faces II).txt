The arm I removed from my body
Lies in the green chair

[Solo: Friesen]

(The ceiling fan is turned on full power as the awakening souls
spill forth from the shattered glass bleeding their essence onto the carpet)

(Crimson flow thickens around the black post standing in the woods
next to the black post standing in the woods next to the pine)

[Dual Solos: Windham/Friesen]
