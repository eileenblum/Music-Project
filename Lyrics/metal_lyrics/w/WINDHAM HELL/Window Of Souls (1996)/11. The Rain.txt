[Solo: Windham (wet granitic ascent)]

(The) rain falls slower
Blood drips cold
Compendium of terror
Never to be told
Death has senses
Which burn and enlight
Clawing at the darkness
Unprepared for the sight

Rain

[Solo: Windham]

Liquid isolation
Eyes frozen closed
Blindness breeds deception
Feel fire walk your toes

Reign

Watch yourself get buried
Then your soul is torn away...

[Solo: Friesen]
