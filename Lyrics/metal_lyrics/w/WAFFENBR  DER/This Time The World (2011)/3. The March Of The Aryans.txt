Aryans march in the enemy's land
And sing the Aryan's song
A sentinel stands at nation's shores
And silently he hums along
Up or down we whistle,
And the whole world may
Curse us or hail us
Whatever it pleases to do

Wherever we are, let's go forward
For the Aryan laughs like this:
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
We're fighting for a White World
We're fighting for the White Race
We'll give the subhumans no rest

We have already fought in many battles
In North, South, East and West
And now we stand ready for war
Against the subhuman plague
The Aryan will destroy all
So none will halt our rise
And when our ranks are thinned
For us there will be no retreat

Wherever we are, let's go forward
For the Aryan laughs like this:
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
We're fighting for a White World
We're fighting for the White Race
We'll give the subhumans no rest

[The March of the Aryans is based on the Waffen SS march SS marschiert in
Feindesland or SS marches in the Enemy's land.

The Waffen SS became renown for their fervour which led them to win a multitude
of decisive campaigns against almost insurmountable odds. They were honoured as
being a ruthless force, that did not take prisoners but totally annihilated its
enemies.

"To give death and to receive death."

- SS motto]
