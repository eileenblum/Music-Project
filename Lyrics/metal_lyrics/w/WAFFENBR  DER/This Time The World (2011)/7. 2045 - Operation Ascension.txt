One hundred years marked
Since the fall of Holy Berlin
A day of reckoning arrives
As the Holy Swastika rises!

One hundred years marked
Since the rise of the tyranny
Our nations have crumbled
Under a reign of hypocrisy

One hundred years marked
Since the rise of the tyranny
On this day of reckoning
We shall fulfil our destiny

One hundred years marked
Since the fall of Holy Berlin
Where will you stand on that day?
With us or marked for death by us?
