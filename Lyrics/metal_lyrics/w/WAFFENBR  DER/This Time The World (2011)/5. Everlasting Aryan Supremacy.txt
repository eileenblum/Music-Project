Since the crowning of our nobility
Upon the throne of the Universe
We have sought our equals
Amongst the Galaxies

For millenia we sent forth envoys
Into the vastness of our realm
We brought light to a million worlds
All devoid of worth

We were always received as Masters
As we had conquered all
So we sought to find the reason
For our Supremacy

The answer was found deep inside us
Our Supremacy is our Blood
The Aryan, in life and death
Is a God!
