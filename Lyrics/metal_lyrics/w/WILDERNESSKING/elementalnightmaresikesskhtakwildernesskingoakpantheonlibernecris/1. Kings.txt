[performed by Wildernessking]In the wilderness we come apart
Relinquished as animals, let the fables unfold

Overcome by the trees who speak our name
Nestled in the woods, cloaked in auras of intrigue
Upon oaken thrones and the gathering of the wind
Howling at the sun, from here weâll never leave

Kings, hidden lives in the sand
Kings, these roots are your hands
Kings, blessed under banners of night
Kings, at dawn you lead the way

Purveyors of natureâs mystique
Hail to the overlords
