Beneath the highest of tides 
Ghostly figures stir 
And awaken the void 
A call to roam the seven seas 
Towards the shore 
The lore of the deep 
A spell is cast 
Emerge from waves 
White horse 
Celestial force 
Hooves tread in the southern light 
Through winter cold, ablaze 
And torching the way 
Equestrian excellence 
An abundant and fruitful life 
Ancient heartbeats 
Rooted in earth 
Ride on
