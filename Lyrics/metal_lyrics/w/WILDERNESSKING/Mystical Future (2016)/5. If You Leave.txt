You say goodbye and wonder why 
Did you want me to go? 
Will I ever know? 
Walking away with heavy eyes 
Down the path I chose tonight 

Felt the chill in my bones 
As I watched them drown 
In the lake of your eyes 
Lamenting still 
But the night is young 
And the worldâs asleep 
Why did we take to the streets 
With heavy, hollow hearts? 
(You) Pull me in 
(The worldâs asleep) 
Iâm a lost child swimming in my dreams 
And youâre the fleeting memory 
Come over in spring 
I canât believe itâs been 
So long 
So long 
Slumber forged in weeping millennia 
If you leave 
If you leave 
Return to the void 
The distant constellation 
Goodbye 
Oh sweet darkness 
Solitary maiden 
The oceans you must cross 
Farewell 
Nocturnal flower 
In the silence 
My soul nests and pecks at your love
