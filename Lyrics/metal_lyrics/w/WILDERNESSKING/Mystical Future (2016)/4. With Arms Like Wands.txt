Deep into the sea of night I heard you sing 
Your presence eluding me yet I still dream 
To drink of your wines, to run the rivers dry 
I have found myself begging for more 
With arms like wands you rise from the cold earth 
With arms like wands you gather all the moons 
With arms like wands, stranded in your mystery 
With arms like wands, the folly of a thousand lifetimes 
I follow you 
Surging waves of grief 
Frozen winterâs will 
Stretched out on the floor 
When and whereâ¦ did you go? 
Return to me
