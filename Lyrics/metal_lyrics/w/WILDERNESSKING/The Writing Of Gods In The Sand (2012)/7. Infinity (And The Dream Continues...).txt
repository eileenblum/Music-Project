And rest comes swiftly
In the prime of our days
Underneath the night in gathered thought en route to
INFINITY
So now we voyage
On the stars, the celestial ships
Nostalgia my dear old friend, truly, you've been erased
A tune etched in the crystal spring
A tune for the slain we left in our wake
Trampling, the stride of giants
Trembling, no more
Looking on, the grand opening
Looking on, with vision clear
Looking on, our carriage awaits
Looking on, 'til the end...
Seizing the throne as we announce the death and doom of a
dead world
Fireflies flicker, flaring with grace and hope just as we came
Winter cometh without a need to hold on, unlike before
Our lives have just begun, in the wilderness kings we have
become
