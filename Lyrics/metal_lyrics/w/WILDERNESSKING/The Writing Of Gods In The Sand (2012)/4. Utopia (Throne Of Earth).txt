Naught we are
Among the tallest trees
That sail to the sky
With twilightâs pride
Signals sent out from above left us to gaze in drunken joy
And heartbeats gallop exquisitely to the sound of a calm never known
All limbs in tact and the shadows we shed turns to ash and becomes one with earth
Now we submit to a life lived only in our restless dreams
The logs are lit
Gather âround the fire
We wonât breathe again
In frail human flesh
Devoid of grief, a toast to you my friends
Freedom has called us, weâve answered with action
Devoid of suffering and regret
There are many sights left for us to see
As we create art with our scars
Painting revolution
In UTOPIA
