The morning sky glazed in timeless blue
Brings about an awe in our eyes
As it adorns a kingdom unveiled
And pays homage to the wild seas of our DISCOVERY
This is the day, come all ye reapers
And reap in (reap in) abundance
This is the day, the past is eclipsed
Memories anew, desperation exiled
These are the times of change from the roots to our veins
Onwards through ecstasy, spiritual poetry
These are the times, burn bright in us flames
Of the sacred animals, speech of the kings
Oh mountains high
In your reach we are safe
No more barren lands
No longer in search of the truth
Aeons of splendour at hand
Fertile ground at our feet
So soar we must
There cannot be a better way
Feel! Feel!
The dawning, the rapture
See! See!
The writing of gods in the sand
