The holy water flows
So sound your horn
In this golden age
Where I find you again
The essence of gods resonate throughout
What consumes this place, footsteps in fascination
Deep is the void and long is the road
Knees to the earth, the devil dwindles
So far have we come with the rags on our backs
Through the years living, ageing, weeping
Who we were now obsolete
Breaching the border of existence
From the RIVER we drink
The ale of time we drink
On and on and on and on
In attires of finesse
The great secret made known
Downstream where life's forever
Transcendental, above the cold, sick world
As we travel on
Thirsts are quenched, souls are cleansed
And all shimmers in the sun
Awaiting the moon
The essence of gods
Trickling down our bodies
What consumes this place
Endless fruition
Deep is the void
But deeper the heart
Knees to the earth
Purification
