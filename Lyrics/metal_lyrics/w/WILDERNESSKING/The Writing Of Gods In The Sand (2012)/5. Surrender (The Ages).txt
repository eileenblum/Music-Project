When we were frail
And we were lost in the haze
Never imagined the path we'd walk
We were cursed as rats
Flesh ripped from bone to bone
Desperate in the darkness
Dead leaves in the wind
Dripping with blood from every hole
No tongue to speak of your diabolical deeds
Woe burns deeply
And woe, in your tomb I reside
Naked and crippled in the perverted truth
Awakening of summer sighs
There is nothing for us in the world of man
Withering away
This fragile tall tale
And we must SURRENDER
Past, present, future
When we woke from the horrors of yesterday
Eyes open to dreams
And all will be well
Now growing older with the guidance of gods
And the freedom of birds
Our heads on high will REVEAL
