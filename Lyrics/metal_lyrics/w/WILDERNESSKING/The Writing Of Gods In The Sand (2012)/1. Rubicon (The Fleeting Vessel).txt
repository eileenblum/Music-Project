There was a time in which we claimed our lives
Declaring no return to days of old
Then came regret and grief, but grieve no more, we are alive
And when we rode with grace, calloused hands to the sky
Shattering the mould and constructing the crown
From the abyss rose the sun
As we crossed the horizon of life
'Til the end...
Newborn we yield the fruits of our youth
Earthly delight
Intoxicates
Newborn we cast death down to the dumps
Dreams unearthed
Emancipate
Mist abolished
Ripened land
Daylight splendid
Boundless beauty
Our home is built in season's bloom
The path is carved into the night
Mere skin and muscle we journey far
Through fields of wealth until the end
Now we bow before the RUBICON
