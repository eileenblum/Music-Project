Downtrodden, what follows you again? 
The same old face pining for more 
Beautiful in that misery I know so well 
I guess my letter didnât resonate 

Youâve unleashed your hounds 
Theyâve barked at the moon 
Full circle ritual 
I drop my head in shame 
In time soon to forget 

And weâll meet again 
The devil knows where 
Take flight 
A soundless longing 

The leather of your skin 
The grace of your curve 
Iâm writhing 
A soundless longing 

Too many days you weep 
Too many nights weâve seen 
The same 
Staring at the ceiling 

Too many days you weep 
Too many nights weâve seen 
The end 
The stars donât align
