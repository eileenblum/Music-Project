Lurker, stalker, devourer of night 
The graves are empty, nocturnal supremacy 
What once was flesh, now a vessel for the devilâs deeds 
Primordial rites below the moon 
Carved into bone 
Entranced by lust 
Deep in the shadows 
Total madness triumphant 
Sing, heathen, sing 
In celebration of all perished 
And when you are to return 
Strip this world of fucking man
