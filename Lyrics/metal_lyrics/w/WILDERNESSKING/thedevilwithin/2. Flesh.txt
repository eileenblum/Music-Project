When I was flesh 
I dreamt of death 
The sweetest end 
Pale and lifeless 
But then I rose 
With eyes devil red 
Swine of tomorrow 
Malignant will 
May we feast from empty sockets 
Come hyenas, come vultures! 
Let it rain 
Let it rain 
Wash away 
Wash away 
A howl for blood 
In atrocious form 
Language so old 
So sick and vile 
And it must be said 
And it must be done 
A spirit awakened 
Here we are flesh 
Remember! 
Grip of fangs 
Rip of beaks 
Honour the call 
Cover the bones 
In the bowels of despicable man 
All nightmares have now come true
