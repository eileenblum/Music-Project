We drift into dream
Where prying eyes cannot see
We soar the heights of earth
A waltz, our dance to the death
And the night swept us away
Further away
How fickle the flight?
And the night swept us away
Further away
To start again
And my arms like branches surround you
And this body, a kingdom I have left for you
Oh holy sovereign
To you treasures abound
Oh holy sovereign
To you, surrendering
Into the sea our secrets, our cesspools
Into the grave our hearts, our limbs
On foreign shores
Drifting deeper
Dauntless we gallop
Divine departure
