[Lyrics by F. Krynojewski]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

Unveilng the truth upon us all
We're awaiting the genocide
Another decade of hatred arises
While the tides are changing slow

Horrible ideologies and awful minds
Reign the supremacy of chaos
Ungodly abominations are still alive
Caused by the ways of decline

[REFRAIN:]
The demons' breed is what we are
The terrible side of evolution
Originators in the purest form
Crawling like snakes on this world

Breathing the wave of fire
It has come to crush all human souls
Until the final, endless night
Covering the earth forevermore

There's nothing that we can do
To change our certain fate
We sit and watch alone
Our last nocturnal rising

[REFRAIN]
