[Lyrics by F. Krynojewski]
[Music by F. Krynojewski and V. Frerich]

I've seen your whole race drowning
Into the sea of blood and tears
I was there to hear their yearning
When the dead walked over rotten fields
With every single cry, it will feed on all my dreams
I am the undefeated, the rapture and disease

[REFRAIN:]
Let the dust reign over the landscapes
As the legions follow my call
Realize your final moment
I've possessed uncountless souls before

My powers have grown stronger, by pain and misery
I've blinded you with deceptions, for now it's hard to see
Gathering storms and poisoned winds
I send into your world
I am the undefeated, the last one and the third

[REFRAIN]

I've seen your whole race drowning
Into the sea of blood and tears
I was there to hear their yearning
When the dead walked over rotten fields
With every single cry, it will feed on all my dreams
I am the undefeated, the rapture and disease

[REFRAIN]
