[Lyrics by Volker Frerich]
[Music by Volker Frerich and F. Krynojewski]

Some say our world will end in fire;  some say, in ice
What if it silently fades away, for nobody to recognize?
When compassion gets lost in vulcans of rage
The last prayer seems like an icon of a lost decade

[REFRAIN:]
Some still try to avoid the darkest day
The fight unnoticed of the masses that have fallen
Can you see the light that points out of the darkness?
Or have you surrendered yourself to total hatred?

The world may end in a whisper, not a thunderous roar
But it may be as dead as after the atomic stroke
When caring about others disappears in clouds of dust
We will dwell alive in a grave the size of this earth

[REFRAIN]

When did we lose track, was it right from the start?
But that we did is for sure, no one can deny
When the last of the fighting kind gives in
We see our own demons dance 
Among the tears that we cry

[REFRAIN]
