[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

Out of the chaotic times, there grew a beast
A form of terror to strike down openly
The ultimate form of cynism that ever stalked the earth
Had left us wondering what lurks inside of us

[REFRAIN:]
The realm of torment - an admonition of eternity
Terror beyond belief - a warning of history
In the realm of torment, the mirror reflects black
No limitations for the evil that men do

The battered earth lies in ruins and ashes
Underneath the ground, traces of his reign of terror
Mass destruction as a routine act of warfare
Darkened souls lost the battle with conscience

[REFRAIN]

Decades later, this age of damnation stands uncovered
But the human mind is still not able to understand
The ultimate force of cynism that ever stalked the earth
Had left us wondering what lurks inside of us

[REFRAIN]
