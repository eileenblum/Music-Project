[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski and V. Frerich]

Convulsions of fatal emphasis shatter your pale existence
You reach out for safety as the horizon becomes an illusion
Twilight interventions combine with undefined melancholy
You never figured one could fall so deep
Without ground in sight

[REFRAIN:]
If your intention is to defy the dark
Be prepared to step into the flames of damnation
Behind the walls of doom
You'll expect to meet your "saviour"
Or all hopes of remedy will disintegrate forever

"To believe in purity and absolution needs total proof.
If I'm unable to find such, why not try the opposite?
When there's light and salvation, there needs to be darkness
And in the dark, I now want to wander recklessly."

[REFRAIN]

Defy the dark - become an inmate to the fire
Be sure that you wil not find your way back
Defy the dark - burn for all eternity

Convulsions of fatal emphasis shatter your pale existence
You reach out for safety as the horizon becomes an illusion
Twilight interventions combine with undefined melancholy
You never figured one could fall so deep
Without ground in sight

[REFRAIN]
