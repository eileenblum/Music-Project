[Lyrics by F. Krynojewski]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

Through a world made of stone
All faith has frozen over
On the passage of our doom
A hell on earth is what we have created
Who will survive these ruthless times
When belief has failed and nothing's left
In the heat of a thousand suns
The nuclear winter emerges

[REFRAIN:]
Beware the tempter of destruction
Fiend of slander and hate
Beware the tempter of destruction
Destroyer of fate

The thorn of anger is rising
And the revelations become true
Armageddon's descent is real
There's no remorse for the traitor
We made the false decisions
Constellation leads into the dark
Ashes will fall upon their heads
When there's no tomorrow for the sinner

[REFRAIN]

Worldwide damage means nothing to us
In our greed for strength and power
The curse is lasting on us all
Now there's nowhere left to turn

Storms destroy the landscapes
Woods and fields drift far away
Illusions of peace are buried
And darkness surrounds us forever

Beware
