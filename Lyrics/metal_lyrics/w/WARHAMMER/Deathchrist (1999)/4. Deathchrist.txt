[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

He's creeping this living graveyard
On the search for negativity
The darkest souls provide him with infamous energy
Rotten thoughts, envy, jealousy, and hatred serve him well
He captures all evil that passes by along the way

[REFRAIN:]
Deathchrist - the sinister lord of reprisal
Just a travesty of what you like to believe
Deathchrist - an unrelenting hand to grab you
You will never learn greater treachery

No redemption from your sins - he consumes them
When you think salvation is near - he abuses you
The decline of your existence is already sealed
When you feel combustion rising within yourself

[REFRAIN]

Deathchrist!
Deathchrist!
Deathchrist!
Deathchrist! 

His harvest will be the terrible fate of mankind
When his ambition is satisfied, the mission is concluded
The spawn of dispersal will soon be spit out
Armageddon is just a thousand deaths away

[REFRAIN]

Deathchrist!
Deathchrist!
Deathchrist!
