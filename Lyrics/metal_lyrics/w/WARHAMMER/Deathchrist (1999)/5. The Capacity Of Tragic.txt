[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Frynojewski and V. Frerich]

On barren wastelands, the distress lies uncovered
Discrepancy between the factions called for collapse
The root of disgrace lies in every single being
That ever stalked this earth so unworthy

[REFRAIN:]
Mankind will surely drift over the edge
The legacy of reproval intensifies itself
No more fertility, only interments expand
Forever we'll drown in pools of red

What makes a determined sinner try to believe
That the capacity of tragedy is unlimited
When we speak our sad and vain valediction
Who will be left to listen to this malediction?

[REFRAIN]

On barren wastelands, all perception fades away
The panic settles down, a form of stillness sets in
We wait for absolution that will never be given
And forever we'll drown in everlasting oblivion

[REFRAIN]

We will drown in pools of red
