[Lyrics by Volker Frerich]

Fragments of the past are covered by the sands of time
Innocence is lost again, the path of peace is left behind
Distorted, enraged voices
They vanished from all our twisted minds

Are these decades of fear and hate the answer to our own seclusion?
The written word has turned to dust only to rise again
Now the great eclipse is here and falls over the cold wasteland

Segments of the future are hidden by the clouds of shame
We've followed absurd dreams, be sure that you're awake now
Distorted, enraged voices
Are never to be heard around here no more
