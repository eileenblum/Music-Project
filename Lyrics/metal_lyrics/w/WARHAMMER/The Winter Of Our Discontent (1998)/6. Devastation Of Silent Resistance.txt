[Lyrics by Volker Frerich]

Follow the journey up the stream of madness
Enter a world of misty and unbalanced tragic
Leave behind your certain, miserable existence
And sagacity will greet you in the cruelest of forms

Witness the jungle fall to pieces
Man's mind is lacerated and disintegrated
Discord with one's inner self
Leads to extreme defense mechanisms

Out here the hunger for divinity dwells
It's so "goddamn" easy to get carried away
Reciting poems of a twisted, worn out mind
While the dissolution crawls up all of their awaiting necks

Witness the apocalypse here and now
The stench of decay is already filling the air
Discord with one's inner self
Leads to devastation of silent resistance

Devastation of silent resistance
Devastation of silent resistance

Follow the journey up the stream of madness
Enter a world of misty and unbalanced tragic
Leave behind your certain, miserable existence
And sagacity will greet you in the cruelest of forms
