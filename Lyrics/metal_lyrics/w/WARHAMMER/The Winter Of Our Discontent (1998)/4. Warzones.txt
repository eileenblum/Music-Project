[Lyrics by Frank Krynojewski]

The emanation of destruction goes on
Fortune is buried under walls
What is left behind our lives
Are the ruins of a global starvation

The result of a deadly ecology
Reverses the order of things
Nothing will prevent the age of chaos
And the premonition won't be heard

Warzones - Under a burning sun
Warzones - The recapture of nature begins

The recreant still try to ignore
The forthcoming downfall of a crumbling earth
Oceans filled with blackened poison
Now rivers of blood run cold

Ashes bombard the hallowed ground
Detonations burn the dirty air
Apocalypse progress towards completion
Unloaded dustraids through awesome fires

Warzones - Under a burning sun
Warzones - Fall into the flames of anguish

Within the everlasting silence
The dreadful claims for the crown
When anything that had ever existed
Lies trembling on the burned ground...
