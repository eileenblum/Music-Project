[Lyrics by Volker Frerich]

Welcome to the new age of terror
Hatred's here like you've never seen before
The madness has settled over to stay
What we can't stand, we kill anything that's in our way

Decadence defines the existent chaos
Trapped are we with ruthless servants
The image in the mirror is weakened
Watch as life in every form is cheapened

Emotions are frozen in the blink of an eye
The sky has to burn, I forgot the reason why...
My memories are fading, what started this insanity?
Walk with me through the forest of morality

We've passed the chapter of chaos just this second
Silence outside - I'd like to dwell in this moment
When emptiness is your longtime companion
You lose yourself in everlasting oblivion...
