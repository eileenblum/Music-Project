[Lyrics by Frank Krynojewski]

The terrible noise of machine-gun fire
Destroys the arctic silence
A new generation of high-tech assassins
Follows the footsteps of their ancestors
Stranded to kill without remorse
Cruel slaughter goes on
This world has been haunted uncountless times
Our history of bloodshed does proof

The end has come through a burst of storms
We're damned to extinction, the guilty will burn

Existence is worthless on our march into doom
Man's fate was buried long ago
Driven by a martial, perverted desire
The individual doesn't belong here anymore
The environmental overkill has reached a new dimension
Through the last pale century
The crusade leads to the final entombment
Nothing will be forgiven

Mankind drifts into the forthcoming chaos
Unknown of the horrible truth
The abolished instincts gather strength
And invert the civilisation
The balance of power is lost
Without prospect to hide the default
Under the sentence of death
We'll welcome the funeral exhaustion...
