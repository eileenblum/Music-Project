[Lyrics by Volker Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

Have you ever been so scared
That you nearly couldn't breathe anymore? 
The fear of the unknown
And also of what's sure to come

[REFRAIN:]
Necrophobia - the ultimate paradox
Death gives meaning to all living creatures
Necrophobia - life's questions unanswered
Death's the ultimate reason to exist

The shivering of the body
Reaches unbearable dimensions
You freeze, and at the same time
You're burning up inside

[REFRAIN]

The black hole seems like a fever dream
Unable to recognize the most certain things
I fear the reaper coming nearer and nearer
But I invited him myself for dubious reasons

When you cannot sleep
The mind begins its' tyranny
In the end, the fear makes you think
About taking your own life

[REFRAIN]
