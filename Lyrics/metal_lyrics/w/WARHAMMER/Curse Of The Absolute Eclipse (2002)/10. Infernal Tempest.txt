[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

The final battle is over; the earth has been burnt down
No more beauty left; what remains is dark ground
Smoke is still in the air; poison is the atmosphere
Ten billion dead; no one to tell the tale

[REFRAIN:]
The earth no longer breathes life
Nothing left to sacrifice
We scorched our planet to the core

Centuries of terror ended during that disastrous night
Bombs of death were falling from the sky
The last ones to die were hiding underground
Death caught them, though they believed they would survive

[REFRAIN]

Wastelands of doom are all that is left
The howling winds carry the message of death
Terror ruled their malicious hearts
Now everything is torn apart
Every form of life exterminated
Now the earth is totally eradicated

[REFRAIN]
