[The song is based upon the Babylonian/Assyrian death cult; the incarnation of the evil spirits Pazuzu and Lamashtu, and their eternal yearning to have power over the living...mr-e Pr-zu-zu dumu Ha-an-prlugal lu lil-lr hul -a-mes...]

[Music by F. Krynojewski]

Winds introduce the slow nightfall
Dark vibrations, the nuclear dawn
Evoking up the dead as the ritual begins
Haunting fog escapes the ground

[REFRAIN:]
Horus returns from forgotten times
Apocalypse unleashed, dethrone mankind

Evening falls onto deep water
Toth-Amon rides the wings of Sabbath
The goddess of wars descends near
Apocalyptic dreams she whispers

[REFRAIN]

Deadly clouds eclipse the sun
Necronom's alive, buried in the dark
Infernal storms upon the horizon
Lights are drowned, Lamashtu's near

[REFRAIN]

The tempter walks on Earth again
A hellish crown made of bones
In carnage arises the burial season
With temples made of human flesh

[REFRAIN]
