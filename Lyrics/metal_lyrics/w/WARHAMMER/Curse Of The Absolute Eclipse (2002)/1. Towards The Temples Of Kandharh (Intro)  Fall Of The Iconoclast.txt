[Lyrics by Frank Krynojewski]
[Music by Frank Krynojewski]

In times of current decay and slander
History repeats again
We've watched the balance distorted
And another struggle began
The chapters of chaos have opened
For those who are able to see
All that was buried underneath
The graveyards of the century

Assassins pray salvation
Hell released by man
They lead into mass genocide
Revenge for all dead children
Flowers of the doomed Messiah
Have poisoned their holy kingdom
Ancient predictions have turned
Into a rotten form of wisdom

Hope, respect, and innocence
Dedicated to the flame
Resistance, hate, and anger
The servants of nocturnal reign
No remorse shall be
The judgement of tomorrow
Inquisitors of the holy war
Emerge without any sorrow

Bathed in blood and cruelty
They rape the sacred domain
The flag of hate has now become
The shroud of the insane
Terminate the ignorant
Live for pure damnation
A last request of those who died
On the altars of the buried nations

Assassins pray salvation
Hell released by man
They lead into mass genocide
Revenge for all dead children
Flowers of the doomed Messiah
Have poisoned their holy kingdom
Ancient predictions have turned
Into a rotten form of wisdom

The fall of the iconoclast
