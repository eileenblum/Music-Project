[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

He feeds on the ones that died in the battle
When the sunlight sets, he creeps out of his cave
The smell of rotten flesh excites his insane mind
The stench of decay fills the fiery air

Dawn of the cadaver ghoul
Only the dead satisfy his soul

He likes the sight of all those broken bodies
Decapitated corpses are lying all around
What's disgusting to us, he finds of beauty
The absolute horror is represented through him

Dawn of the cadaver ghoul
Wicked, awful creature just waiting for you

The wars fought by mankind supply his eerie needs
He's the king of predators, the instinct of evil
The legend passed on by the children that he went insane
The perfect mirror for the wrong that is done in this world

No one sees the demon when his work is complete
Is he just a ghost of all wild stories that are told?
Or will he come back when more blood is shed?
And will the fear never ever go away from here?

He feeds on the ones that died in the battle
When the sunlight sets, he creeps out of his cave
The smell of rotten flesh excites his insane mind
The stench of decay fills the fiery air

Dawn of the cadaver ghoul
Only the dead satisfy his soul
