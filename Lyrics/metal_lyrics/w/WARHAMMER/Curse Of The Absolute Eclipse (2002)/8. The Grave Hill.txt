[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

Mysteries surround the forsaken and doomed grave hill
They say it's the place where you meet all of your fears
Where the dead cannot rest in peace
And the wicked ones appear

[REFRAIN:]
The earth will open soon
The hunt for flesh under a full moon
They are the children of the night
So there will be no place left to hide

People have vanished there without any trace
The place where it's always cold
And fog hangs in the air
The true secret will never be released
By the rulers of the dark

[REFRAIN]

The grave hill - punishment for their sins
It will never let you sleep at ease
The grave hill - the tortures of the past 
The earth on this hill is cursed eternally

You will not be able to see clear in the darkness
The summoning of all your nightmares is here
The blood of the innocent runs
Through the veins of the ground

[REFRAIN]
