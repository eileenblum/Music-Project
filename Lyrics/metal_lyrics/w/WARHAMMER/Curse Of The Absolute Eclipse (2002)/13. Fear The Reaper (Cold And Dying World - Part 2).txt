[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by Marko Hoffmann and F. Krynojewski]

Horror reaches out to grab our vicious souls
We will sink down in that eternal hole
In death, mankind is finally equal
No more bargains and cheap deceptions
Do you see the blood on our masters' hands?
Too late to wash it off, hear the cries of the damned

[REFRAIN:]
I told you, it's time to fear the reaper
Apocalypse is here to crush the non-believers
Hold your breath and fear the reaper
No more gods or servants, and no more leaders

Decaying bodies fill the capitols, where blood runs red
The holy men, they try to find refuge 
Turmoils shatter every place that once looked safe
Nowhere to hide for the snakes of double tongues
Destruction, collapse, epidemics, and doom
This is worse than any old transcription

[REFRAIN]

Run, you fool, in the hope for shelter
What you'll get is certain death
You pathetic, miserable, weak disciple
Sure to drown in anguish and wrath
Ashes to ashes, and dirt to dirt
Welcome the rise of the archangels
