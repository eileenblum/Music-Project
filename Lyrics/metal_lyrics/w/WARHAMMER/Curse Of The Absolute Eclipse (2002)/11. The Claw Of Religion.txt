[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

Since the beginning of time
A weapon was built and protected
To keep the balance in line
To guard the "forces of the light"
Do you hear the cries of all the ones that fell?

[REFRAIN:]
The claw of religion
No one will escape
The warriors of the cross

Through the different eras
The sword was sharpened to kill
It cuts all the disbelievers
Leaving only the serpents alive
Never was an instrument of power so distinct and evil

[REFRAIN]

Can you feel their hate and hostility?
For their will, thousands march into battle
The cross that they try to defend so much
Will one day only be seen at graveyards

Since the beginning of time
A weapon was built and protected
To keep the balance in line
To guard the "forces of the light"
Do you hear the cries of all the ones that fell?

[REFRAIN]
