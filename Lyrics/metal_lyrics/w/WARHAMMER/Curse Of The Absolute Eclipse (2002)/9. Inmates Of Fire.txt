[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski and V. Frerich]

The last days of mankind have arrived
All the prophecies of doom are true
Damnation is coming for me and you

[REFRAIN:]
Insane destruction - the human race has fallen
Ignorant and weak - and now you're crawling
The living dead start to march

As thunders roar through the dead of night
In the shadows of twilight, you're trying to hide
The sword of Mars will cut you into half

[REFRAIN]

Look into the face of death; it's finally here
The graveyards come alive with unforgiven souls
The good and the bad will become inmates of the fire

[REFRAIN]

The living dead start to march
