[Lyrics by V. Frerich]
[Music by F. Krynojewski]

The quest for power led to unbelievable deeds
Politics and religion - the cruel force to rule
He rode through the country, without feelings and shame
And when one village was done, he left broken hearts and pain
To satisfy his lust with the young ones, was his aim
The conqueror worm - Matthew Hopkins, the name

[REFRAIN:]
Fear the witchfinder general
Torture was his game
Beware the witchfinder general
Terror and torment under God's name

Dark souls reigned in the old days, with blackened hearts
No place to hide, the mighty decided at will
He represented the hypocrisy, the lies, and the hate
The corrupt, wicked one decided people's fate
Starved, burned, and quartered behind iron gates
The poor ones in the dungeons, forgotten and raped

[REFRAIN]

The quest for power led to unbelievable deeds
Politics and religion - the cruel force to rule
He rode through the country, without feelings and shame
And when one village was done, he left broken hearts and pain
To satisfy his lust with the young ones, was his aim
The conqueror worm - Matthew Hopkins, the name

[REFRAIN]

Under God's name
