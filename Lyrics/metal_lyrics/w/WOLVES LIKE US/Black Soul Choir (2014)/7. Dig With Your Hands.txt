If you want to get to Bottom,
Get in the Dirt
Dig with your Hands
Clean thru this Earth
When you get to Holy water
YouÂ´re not even close.
ItÂ´s when you stop believing
That's when it hurts most

We are so close
We are so close

Just get Better At Dumping me
Feed me the Poison
Then forgive me

Brothers in the Backdrop cooking up the Plot
Poisonwing The Shadows, a Story told too much.
Please donÂ´t think about it
Please donÂ´t get up close.
Because when stop believing, ThatÂ´s when it hurts the most

If you want to get to Bottom,
Get in the Dirt
Dig with your Hands
Clean thru this Earth
When you get to Holy water
YouÂ´re not even close.
ItÂ´s when you stop believing
That's when it hurts most

We are so close
We are so close

Just get Better At Dumping me
Feed me the Poison
Then forgive me

I gave you less than you deserved
I gave you less than you deserved

Freedom from the words
Meaning over turned
From the Light of Day Faith will
Fadeway

Freedom from the words
Meaning over turned
From the Light of Day Faith will
Fadeway

Freedom from the words
Meaning over turned
From the Light of Day Faith will
Fadeway

Freedom from the words
Meaning over turned
From the Light of Day Faith will
Fadeway

Just get Better At Dumping me
Feed me the Poison
Then forgive me

IÂ´ve gave you less than you deserved
IÂ´ve gave you less than you deserved
