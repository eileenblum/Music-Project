DonÂ´t waste Our Time IÂ´m ready
And IÂ´m Leaving if youÂ´re not coming.
For How Long was I Lost?
Now we still do sharpen our knives
And we Teach Each other Lies
Oh Love I know you so

Out we know it when we have stabbed love.
When its bleeding and it needs stitches
what matters is how
well we walk thru the fire.

If youÂ´re losing your soul and know it
then you still got a Soul
left to lose
I know you

Out we know it when we have stabbed love.
When its bleeding and it needs stitches
what matters is how well you walk thru the fire.
