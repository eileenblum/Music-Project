Ask The Devil You Know.
Or Get Him To Leave You Alone For Once.
ThereÂ´s Thunder in The Shadows.
I Should know Better, But IÂ´m Back For More.
A Small Cost, And IÂ´m Lost .
Scare Heraway, Now The Days grow cold. The City Gets Quieter. When People Have Less to Say. They Shout

Untie Yourselves
Remove the Blindfold.
Your Paradise Lies in the Shadow of Their Swords.
Explain Yourselves
The Lies Your have told.
Those holy words are poison to us all.

IÂ´ve been good you know,
We wonÂ´t bleed unless we fight.
IÂ´ve been good you know,
Shake off the Slumper YouÂ´re Born in to the Days start to weight more. Like My shadows turning to Stone.
Where is your Saviour now
They fed You this Poison All your Life.

Untie Yourselves
Remove the Blindfold.
Your Paradise Lies in the Shadow of Their Swords.
Explain Yourselves
The Lies Your have told.
Those holy words are poison to us all.
