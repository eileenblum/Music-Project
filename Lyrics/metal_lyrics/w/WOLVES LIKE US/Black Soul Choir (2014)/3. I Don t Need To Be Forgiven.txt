I walked cut my teeth in Anger
I know IÂ´ve Enough About it.
Slept in Flea Ridden Beds.
Made up Stories in my Head,
Heard The High Heels clicking in Motel Hallways.

Save me, Oh Save Your Air
Brother Please Save your Air.
I Got up from my Hands and Knees.
Sister Please Save Your Air.
Because IÂ´ll never say it again.

I walked cut my teeth in Anger
Scared of Ever thinking
That IÂ´ve got this Life for Free
Now WeÂ´re all taking Turns to see.
Who can get the most, whatever the cost.

Save me, Oh Save Your Air
Brother Please Save your Air.
I Got up from my Hands and Knees.
Sister Please Save Your Air.
Because IÂ´ll never say it again.

I DonÂ´t need saving
I DonÂ´t need your help
IÂ´ve found the way out myself
The Path to your Truth is all to often used.
so save your poison words.
Because I need to be Forgiven

Save me, Oh Save Your Air
Brother Please Save your Air.
I Got up from my Hands and Knees.
Sister Please Save Your Air.
Because IÂ´ll never say it again.
