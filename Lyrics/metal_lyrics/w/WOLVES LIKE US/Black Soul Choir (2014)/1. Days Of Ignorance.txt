WeÂ´ll turn to Dust in Due Time,
WeÂ´ll Be Deal Our Fates.

WeÂ´ll turn to Dust in Due Time,
WeÂ´ll Be Deal Our Fates.

Like Friends Rust and Turn Corrubt.
Our Broken Hearts Kept Us Awake They Broke us Down, But We Got Up.
With Empty Pockets, We downed these Shots.
We Cried As Brothers, And Spoke Like Friends.
Deciphered Lies of Religion
Now Give me Something New to Tell.
ItÂ´s sin my child, Her eyes Are Wild.

WeÂ´ll turn to Dust in Due Time,
WeÂ´ll Be Deal Our Fates.

WeÂ´ll turn to Dust in Due Time,
WeÂ´ll Be Deal Our Fates.
