I walked with you, with that swagger Like we were weightless.
We DidnÂ´t Believe in Anything, smoked by the creek.
You were all poets And I wanted to be Like you.
I sat Listening and watched you paint the Room with A Song

Oh where are you now, Brothers?
We survived the Night Lights Together
We survived the Bored
We were Blood
Oh we were Blood.

This Boy has something, saw it in his spidery hands
Now even IÂ´m sold.
I had that Devil stare,
I was told
In a Second, I had a whole Life Time of Experience.
My Hands were Shivering,
It was a miracle IÂ´ve never shared

Oh where are you now, Brothers?
We survived the Night Lights Together
We survived the Bored
We were Blood
Oh we were Blood.

ItÂ´s been years where we donÂ´t speak
ItÂ´s been years where we donÂ´t speak
ItÂ´s been years where we donÂ´t speak
Thanatos wins again

I walked with you, with that swagger Like we were weightless.
We DidnÂ´t Believe in Anything, smoked by the creek.
You were all poets And I wanted to be Like you.
I was a miracle when we were Blood.
