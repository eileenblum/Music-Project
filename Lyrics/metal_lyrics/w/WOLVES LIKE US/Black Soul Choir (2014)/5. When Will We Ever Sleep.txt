Shake thru A Fantasy
Once More Thru the Night
Will we ever Sleep?
See thru Dark Water
From my Bleeding Teeth
Have I Gone too far?
If I go too far, Stop me
Have we gone to far, to stop now?

Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?

If I go too far, Stop me

Oh my Bones are sick
From This Lack of Room
Now where are we going?
You Came crawling back
Even thought you knew where it has going
How did we lose the good in us?
Whats keeping you From Reaching Out?
My Bones are sick
From This Lack of Room

Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?
Will we ever Sleep?

If I go too far, Stop me
