You Seal Our Fates
With Secret Handshakes
So Strike Your Deals with the fucking Devil
IÂ´ll fight you to my Death Bed
And I will Sing at your Hallowed Altars

You Seal Our Fates
With Secret Handshakes
So Strike Your Deals with the fucking Devil
IÂ´ll fight you to my Death Bed
And I will Sing at your Hallowed Altars

These Symbols Lie, The Mouths Betray
So Form a Line, Stand in The Fire

You Seal Our Fates
With Secret Handshakes
So Strike Your Deals with the fucking Devil
IÂ´ll fight you to my Death Bed
And I will Sing at your Hallowed Altars
