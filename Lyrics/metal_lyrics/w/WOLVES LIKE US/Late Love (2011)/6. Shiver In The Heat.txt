Tie The Knot Loose so he can Suffer
As Above so below And
My Shaking Voice Spoke Drunken Wonders
Use Your Magic, Now use Your Powers
You canÂ´t escape this.
You canÂ´t will it Away
Standing Done on the Gallows Floor
Your Tragedies will release you Son
Just do as you always did before
Just lie and cheat and steal and whore
Be on your Way Now
Newborn Slave
Let he who is without Sin Dig The First Grave
Be on your Way Now
Wicked Son , Twisted one
Show us our Day Has Just Begun
