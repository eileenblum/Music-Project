Like Smoke Through you Fingers
It Lights like A Paper Rose
I Make Love Like A Dancer
Fighting His Injuries
There are Still some Sparks Here
Far Down in The Coal
Leaning At the walls
Trying to Light Matches

Like Smoke Through you Fingers

I Make Love Like A Dancer
Fighting His Injuries
There are Still some Sparks Here
Far Down in The Coal
Leaning At the walls
Trying to Light Matches

To Rekindle My Memories
IÂ´m trying To The Best
To Rekindle My Memories
Love I know I Shake so
But could You catch to me?
Love I know I Shake so

To Rekindle My Memories
