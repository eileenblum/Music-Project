Yes what a Shame
Yes you got no right
To leave this Place
Is what I Thought
When I laid there bleeding
Lived fucking looking Backwards
Tried drowning these suburban Days
Jesus left us wanting and knowing now what I did not know then
If I could, IÂ´d do it all again
Take all the Fights
IÂ´d take all the Dirty Truths
Just to be here Again
At the same old Place
We went to Dust
