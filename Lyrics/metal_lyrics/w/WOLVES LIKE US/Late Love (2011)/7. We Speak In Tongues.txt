Head like a Gaping Hole
Eyes Black like a Widows Home i Know
Walk the Streets while we Speak in Tongues
With clenched Fists and Ringing Skulls
Glass looks from Half-Hearted Sons,
An end has to have a Start, I know
Please Sleep tight, Just don't tell lies - YouÂ´ll be Alright
But this Contract was Already Signed in Blood
And This Contest
About who's most Free
I swear itÂ´s Gonna kill me
