Oh Point your Finger Son
You know All the dirty Lies
Makes No Difference in My Eyes
WeÂ´re Snakes And WeÂ´re Sharks
Conmen playing Easy Marks
Makes No Difference in My Eyes
Who let first Fists fly

Oh Snake Charmers IÂ´ll take my Thirty coins
And Watch Another one Die

Oh Snake Charmers IÂ´ll take my Thirty coins
And Watch Another one Die

WeÂ´ve been cheated
So donÂ´t cheat yourself Boy
WeÂ´ve been cheated
So donÂ´t cheat yourself Boy

WeÂ´ve been cheated
So donÂ´t cheat yourself Boy
WeÂ´ve been cheated
