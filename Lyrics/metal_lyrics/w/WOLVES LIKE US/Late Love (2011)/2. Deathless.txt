The rows of bottles they speak no truth.
They lie and cheat you, but some lies are welcome.
And it depends on the liar too, on which snake you choose to devour you, devour you.

As the room turns into air, you float
With temptations of the flesh
YouÂ´re weightless, and lifeless
And then inward your eyes will close
The magic has run its course
YouÂ´re breathless and deathless

The rows of bottles they speak no truth.
