Just to be with you, Love
Oh Child your Fathers Shaking
Just to Breathe in your Love
Oh Child your Fathers aching

I Did not call Because of The Money
On our knees And Out of Luck
The Ground it Feels like Quicksand
Between A Fight and A Fuck
I`m still your Filthy Lover
Now that We are Family?
IÂ´m Paranoid and IÂ´m Speechless
IÂ´ll commit Sin After Sin

Just to be with you, Love
Oh Child your Fathers Shaking
Just to Breathe in your Love
Oh Child your Fathers aching

Just to be with you, Love
Oh Child your Fathers Shaking
Just to Breathe in your Love
Oh Child your Fathers aching
