You Speak to me
with spitting teeth
Like itÂ´s the rapture
so torn between two Worlds
I made my own little Rats Nest

You Speak to me
with spitting teeth
Like itÂ´s the rapture
so torn between two Worlds
I made my own little Rats Nest

Let us speak freely now
Because weÂ´ve been marred
By good Intentions
Oh Mother, Oh Father
I Took so long to love you

I thought we would be left Behind
And that Belial would take me
