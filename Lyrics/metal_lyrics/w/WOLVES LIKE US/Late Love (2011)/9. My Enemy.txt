I hear the whispers, baby
If what they say is true
They say I killed the brother
To fall in love with u

These words I heard them once before
A conversation I believe
How does a man begin 2 fall
When he does practice 2 deceive?
There was a voice behind my back
His face I could not see it clear
The voice was so familiar, though
I knew my enemy was near

The sun is gone
And the sky is black
So get your ass out from
Behind my back
I told u once
And I told u all
And I told it like it was (sic)

U can't
Have me
If u can't
Catch me
Out of your mind bent on revenge
To think I once called u my friend
U want the dog? I'll let him out
Come and get some baby
