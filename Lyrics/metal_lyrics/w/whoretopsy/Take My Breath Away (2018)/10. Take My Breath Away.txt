Dale was a sleazy cunt
Always trying to cop a feel from his co-workers
He had his eyes set on Steph the cleaning lady as she was kind of hot
She only worked after hours when no one was around
The perfect time to flirt
"Let me just masturbate in front of you" Was the final straw
"I knew you were a weirdo, but this is fucking fucked"
She threatens him
"I'm reporting you to Mr Stanley, your career's over now"
Dale panics and instantly regrets approaching her

"Please let's just forget this ever happened my darling Stephanie, I have been under a lot of stress"
"You're gonna regret you ever said those words to me"
"Seriously, can't you take a fucking joke?"

The next day Mr Stanley calls Dale into his office
"I've received complaints about your behaviour
I'll have to let you go"

Dale loses his cool and lunges over the desk, strangling his boss till he passes out
He stabs Mr Stanley in the neck with a Bic pen
Watching the blood flow out
"Looks like I've let YOU go"

As Dale comes home he is whacked over the head with a cricket bat

He comes to an hour later strapped to a chair in his kitchen
"You sick bastard, I heard what you did at work"

Reaching for the Dyson
"You love the cleaner how 'bout I clean you out"
Shoves the Vacuum down his throat and sucks the life out of the prick
The sickening gurgle of blood and guts swirling gives pleasure to his wife

In the last moments of life he shuts his eyes thinking about Steph and cums
As Dale lies there lifeless his wife vacuums the floor around him, opens a stubby, goes back to the couch to watch 'The Bachelor'
