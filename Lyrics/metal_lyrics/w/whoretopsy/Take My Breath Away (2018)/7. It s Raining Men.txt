"Fuck you cunts you're coming with me"
He said just before he croaked it
Glen, so misunderstood
A dopey looking weird cunt only five foot, with a face a mother couldn't love
"Fuck's sake, I should've worn the glove"
Said Frank, a devastated father
Gave poor Glen a beating everyday
"I'm so ashamed I created this abomination"
Twelve toes, a second head sprouting from his neck
Little bogan kid from a country town
Almost nineteen with the mind of a child
"Dad could we go down to the lolly shop please"
"No, you unloveable spud
You never keep your bag on and you always shit yourself
We're not going. Here's fifty bucks, head down to the servo and get the gas bottles changed over"
He can't stop sobbing
Grabs three bottles, a box of redheads for dads BBQ
"Fire up them snags, my famous pork ribs
Oi how sick are my chicken skewers?
So fucking tasty"
Frank brags to his mates, all truck drivers throwing beer cans at his mutated son
"Fuck you Dad I've made a bomb"
Gun powder filled milo tin

"Die!"
The fuse is lit
Body parts, fresh organs, shit on the patio
"Ahhhhhhh!" Screams from the kitchen poor mother is wailing
"Fuck! There goes two thirds of my Centrelink payments
What a waste of snags"
Crafty little Glen has died with a smile on both heads
