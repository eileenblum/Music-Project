Alice was a teacher in the secondary education system
A decade of torment, broken her completely
Copping sexual advances daily have taken its toll
A decision has been made, drastic career change

She has always found corpses exciting
"I want to be a mortician"
Years of study
She is ready
Job interview - she nails the part
Time to pursue her dreams

"G'day love! My name's Robbie, Please let me show you around"
Paperwork, chemicals, instruments, cadavers
Surprisingly aroused by the smell of death in the air
She imagines cold dead fingers on her clit
"Time to get to work, here's the newest arrival,
I hope you're ready to handle your first stiff"

She sees Mr Flynn from way back when she was still teaching high school
The dead man has tented himself with his rock hard ice cold cock
She moistened up at the sight of her old crush on the table
grabs a scalpel from the table and drives it deep into Robbie's neck
Blood spews out onto the tiles, Alice mounts Mr Flynn

Lividity ensures his sunnyboy stays erect
"I was a really hot girl way back then, Why didn't you want me?"

Congealed semen shoots deep inside her from the erupting corpse
Alice queefs Flynny's weepings over Robbie's head
After disposing of the bodies she flees the country
Nine months later Alice gives birth to a boy that she adoringly has named Flynn
