"A croc just ate my kids"
Screamed Janelle, a lovely local Mum
Hysterically crying at the patrons of the pub
"He took them straight from the tent, got my sleeping kids in one single bite! Snapped up and then dragged away, I tried to run but the prick was too quick"
Screams from her sons pierced the air leading into the swamp
Whole pub stood still
"Fuck me, gotta kill this cunt"
Brad, a local chippy and a hero at the footy club runs straight out the pub
Swag in the ute, pedal to the metal
"Don't forget your lunch"
His mum throws a vegemite sanga into the tray
"Thanks mum, you bloody legend"
Shouting to his mum he drives away from pub in his decked out sick looking hilux
Smashing down a tinny, diesel smoke in the air
Absolutely fearless

He parks the ute just by the billabong
"Yuck, he sure was a big cunt. He made a fucking mess"
Setting up camp twenty feet from the water, surrounded by a dozen traps
"I'll get this cunt in the morning I'll be right tonight since the pricks already eaten"
Brad wakes from rumbling water
The biggest salty grabs his rifle
Darting out of the water, he catches him off guard
His jaw clamping down on poor Bradley's private parts
"AHH, you scaley fuck"
He puts a round right in the crocs brain and starts to bleed out
Driving back in agony
"Help me, he got me good, he stole my fucking manhood"
Everyone in the pub laughs
Pulls out the rifle and shoots the lot
Brad severs old mate's king kong to replace his missing schlong
Have a geez
