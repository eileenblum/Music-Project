Chelsea West London âOh my word loveâ.

âWhat is it Pete my dear?â

âCome here and have a fucking look at this thing on the TV thatâs blocked the sewer.

It is all the âWet Onesâ weâve been using to get the yellow off our anuses, mixed in with fat and oil tipped down the sinkâ.

You see, this gorgeous couple love to have their special cuddles on filth. The filthier it is, the wetter she gets.

They have done it in a slaughterhouse and a pig sty before and that time at the shit farm.

Fuck did they get crook, spent a week in hospital farm from a nasty E.Coli bacterial infection. Peteâs wife nearly died.

They run down the street giggling like schoolgirls.

Pete lifts the manhole cover, they climb in and start wading downstream.

They embrace each other when they the massive pile of quivering filth.

It smells like a fish and chip shop mixed with shit tonnes of faeces.

Stripping off his clothes, climbing the brick wall onto a ledge,

He does a mad horsey into the fatberg. âCome here my loveâ.

Using a baby wipe covered in grease to lube up his wifeâs date as she enters her.

âOh god yes, this is so hot. Fuck this place is so putrid that itâs good. Iâm comingâ.

Pulling out and shooting a load on a wipe covered in matted hair,

His wife swoops in and lick the âWet Oneâ clean while Pete growls her giney out.

Security guards, spot them with their torches.

âFuck off you lot!â
