Huey Davies is harmless, âsure he is still a little wobblyâ. âBut he wouldnât hurt a flyâ they would say.

All the ladies at the Colca IGA like to treat him with a free slice of Don Strasburg.

You can see him on the weekends drunk as fuck and shadow boxing on his front deck. Either dressed as Batman or some fucking super hero.

Twelve Red Bear cans stuffed into his original Jurassic Park bag, heâs proudly owned since 1993

Spotting his neighbour get out of her car so Huey cross the road.

âGâday Jenny Roberts, do you wanna come and have a drink at my place? We could Connect 4. That would be so fun!â âSureâ

âPlease sit down at the dining table.â âHuey shows Jenny his Milton Bradley board game collection. Jenny Playâ¦â

Fully touches his arm while they play Connect 4, Huey gets the wrong idea and tries to kiss her.

âIâm sorry I have to go homeâ âLetâs watch âThe Notebookâ. Oi get back here Jenny Roberts Hee Yaâ

A velociraptor backpack that is weighted with cans, instantly kills her as he hits her over the head. He touches her genitals.

âHuey goes to the jail nowâ
