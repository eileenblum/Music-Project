Since peter was a 30 year old newborn baby girl forever getting lots of compliments from everyone at day care
"Look at all that hair," they would say,
"She's so cute," "isn't she just divine, isn't she a little doll?"
"I just want to take you home and eat you,
Oh, yes, I do, I want to eat those chubby lil legs of yours!"

Now Peter's a toddler.
A cheeky 2 year old who pushed the fetish to the limits.
This sheet metal worker has spent all of his holidays and sickies at the daycare,
She just loves to wear her nappy, that feeling of piss swirling around her duct-taped scrotum
"Sweetie, it's time for you to enjoy mummy's titties,"
She's sucking for ages, her milk is non existent.

Peter's upset, bites his mummy and spits her nipple on the floor.
Judith's screaming in pain, "Call me a fucking ambulance now!"
"No! No you frigging stop it talking, mummy, stop it fucking looking at me you is stupid."
Peter gets the safety scissors, stabbing her so hard the plastic snaps the blade is deep
"Sorry, mummy," crawling into the corner, she craps herself a beauty
