Just say my fucking name cunt
With sheer hatred he smashes her face
Her skull softens under white knuckles

You never notice me
You never smile or say hello
For over seven months
We work at the same Woolies bitch!
I love watching the way you use those tongs
The way you shove them up the chickens bumholes
When they're done and then you slip them
Into sweaty zip bags

What the hell would you see in a cunt
Who restocks the fruit and veg
Look at this photo that's me and Manu
From My Kitchen Rules
We met at Crown Casino
Who's a stupid motherfucker now?

At least I got to keep your hair net
That you left behind in the tea-room
Oh God it smelt good
Please accept my little gift
Mal's penis is quite short in length
But has amazing girth
I'll replace all the bad memories
When I fuck you like a chook

He wallops the Bejesus out of her
While he taps up a doughy
Firm enough to stuff
Into her unconscious body
Building up a sweet rhythm
He reaches climax
You fucking idiot
You should've added me on Facey
Make me a promise
That you won't hurt anyone ever again
Anyone ever again
You look disgusting
If I were you I'd stay in bed
You should ring Phil and ask for time off
