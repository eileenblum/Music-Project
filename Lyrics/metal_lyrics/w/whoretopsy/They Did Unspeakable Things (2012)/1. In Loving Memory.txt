He sits, fingering his foreskin. He hides behind his monitor and smells his fingers.
This year he has missed six deadlines, so Mr. Robinson is like, "Glenn, you're fired!
I've found these things. Copies of 80+ mag, kid's toys that reek of piss,
elderly women's clothing, vials of urine. What the fuck?"

Glenn squeals and runs to his locker. The damning evidence is thrown into his bag.
Fumbling, a vial falls and shatters. The richest tang of urine overwhelms the room.
Tears fill his eyes. "Security, please get this fuckwit out of here! You really need some help!"

Sobbing, he shuffles home. He phones the escort agency and asks for Ruth.
"You're in luck, sir, she's available. Expect to see the sassy Ruth within an hour." "Good."
Bursting into his flat, he runs and quickly changes to his sailor suit.

He lays out his grandmother's nightclothes. She has been dead for 17 years.
All he has are fading memories and some soiled clothes.
Ruth arrives and Glenny makes her slip the garments on. "Hi, Granny.

"Now soil yourself, please. Piss, you slut." Glenny cares for his Gran, bathes her,
then he's rewarded with sex. This time he becomes so enraged. "They found you at work.

"You stupid, old woman. I told you to stay put at home. You never ever listen,
I'm going to drain you of life. I love watching you die, the lights turning off in your eyes.
Dear God, what have I done? I love you, Gran. Rest in peace."
