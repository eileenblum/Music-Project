Colin never liked his mother. Since early childhood, he was always bitter, distancing himself from her.
He never noticed girls at school. Colin only ever bit one, barking at her like a dog.

By the age of 33, he's so sexy. He spends many hours a day masturbating to pictures of moots.
He crops them out of pornographic books. All the clippings of curvy bodies and mammoth breasts
are now burning in the fireplace. He can't stand them, they all remind him of his mother.

He wants to have sex but he feels sickened when a woman slowly unbuttons her blouse.
He waits till dark. He waits for her. He hides in the scrub. He flies out, tackles her, cuts her wind off.

Machete held aloft his head.
He hacks into her torso and legs. He makes himself a perfect ass and pussy to sew his wild oats to.

He thrusts twice and it's all over.
