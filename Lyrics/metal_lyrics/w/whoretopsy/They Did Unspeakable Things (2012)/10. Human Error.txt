Enter room 19. Blood from floor to ceiling, a pretty little thing lies twisted on the bed.
Hands and feet have been cable-tied, stab wounds cover her upper body.
Her breasts hacked off with a steak knife.

Her hair and face have been removed, her perfect manicure ripped from her lips.
Labia and anus flayed, peeled off in one piece.

Laughter spills from the en suite. Police enter, "Freeze, you son of a bitch!"

They arrest a man with lovely hair.
He has much younger-looking skin.

A bra, holding lumps of bloody breast tissue, is ill-fitting. Red fingernails stuck to his.
Vaginal skin patch glued to his penis.
