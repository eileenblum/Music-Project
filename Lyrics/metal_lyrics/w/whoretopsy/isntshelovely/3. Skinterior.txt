Mr Jenkins is not the full quid and stands about 4ft 10.
Since he was the tender age of 13 he was always keen to help at Rob Morrison's shop.
Rob's the local butcher and part time taxidermist to some of the hunters and fishermen in this quiet little town.

Rob's not right. He's fucked up. He loves to head to the cemetery and snatch a fresh corpse.

Mr Jenkins is small, but he's really strong and good at digging holes.
The bodies carried to the wagon, they cover their tracks as if no one was ever there. 

Rob is a master at removing skin in one whole piece. He gently flays the skin around the genitals so they're intact.

Mr Jenkins helps by holding the skin. He hands Rob the sharp knife. Prepares the skin for tanning.

This cute home is full of human cushions, rugs, and lamp shades.
Each curtain is made from three people cleverly sewn together.

Mr Jenkins hobbles to the toilet. Rob wonders why he's gone for twelve minutes.
He finds him in the lounge with the curtains. "You fucking wobbler!!! Cut that shit out now."

He is sucking on a leathery dick while masturbating.
Rob gives him a proper flogging.

"Don't ever suck my stuff off again!"
