[Music: Robert Haven, lyrics: Ivan Rodgon]

Divinity is sunken
Into the ashes of our lies
Their dragons have fled their pens
And the grace is sundered
Into dark

You, scavenger of these frozen ruins,
Release me from this pain
"Ghosts of your creed"
Look down on me and curse
"In the grave of Gods"
There's no sorrow and no mournâ¦

The echo of existence,
The reminiscence are loud
Erased chapter of time
Ossuary of creationâ¦
Without bones

You, scavenger of these frozen ruins,
Release me from this pain
"Ghosts of your creed"
Look down on me and curse
"In the grave of Gods"
There's no sorrow and no mournâ¦
"Dive" in the grave of your old God
There's only a hollow in the ashes of untold.
