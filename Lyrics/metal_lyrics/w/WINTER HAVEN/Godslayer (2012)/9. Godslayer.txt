[Music &amp; lyrics: IvÃ¡n Rodgon]

So loose your legion do the mayhem,
Be ready to fall!
Your wave of shadows shines like ember,
But it's not more than a cry
Stolen in the night.

Night falls and so it begins,
Come to the death bringer
Show to me what you can greed.
Light comes and the battle rages,
Raevers fall and your wrath increases,
Your caprice blinds your gift
All you'll see it's only your grief.

Daughter of the gods,
Hollow deity, crawler of the storm.

The army crawls on your rotten dreams.
All your desires are aimless,
And grief is far from prayers.
Your twisted pride drives you to the end,
Huntress divine, bleed the silence,
Screaming!

There on the ground now you lay,
Devastated in silence.
Behold your stupid remembrance,
Far beyond heaven close to the fiends.
Die by the hand of someone else
You're not my command
A bastard son is hidden
Waiting for (your own) downfall.
You will see all the lies of the Gods.
You will see at the endâ¦ no dawn.

"The requiem's begun,
Daughter that no ones mourn,
Your stubborn existence has gone"
Mortals have forgotten all the gods.
"A pantheon collapsed.
All the deities dismountâ¦
The stallion of eternity!!!"
Phantoms of time vanished by their pride.

Die by the hand of someone else
You're not my command
A bastard son is hidden
Waiting for (your own) downfall.
You will see all the lies of the Gods.
You will see at the endâ¦ no dawn.
