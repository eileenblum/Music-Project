[Music: Ãngel Montagner, lyrics: Ivan Rodgon]

Spirits of despair, grow as a legion.
I've seen it in your face, only a lethe.

Hate is growing inside you,
Dead moon is insane
Bleeding all the darkness around
Scratching all the heart

Third â¦ moon eclipses silver and red
Light is fading out, the God arise!
Crawl empty hearts, madness will rise!

These sins in your will,
Look for redemption
Running throughout the flames
Of last damnation.

Draining all the betrayers
Claiming what he hates,
Silver eye is blinded by now
Innocents re dying.
Third â¦ moon eclipses silver and red
Light is fading out, the God arise!
Crawl empty hearts, madness will rise!

The black one is closer to the light.
Shaping itself, as a great mother of death.
Showing itself, the great black one is alive

The black one is closer to the light.
Now sinners and saints
Behold the blinder
See the chromatic rain,
The third conjuration.

Draining all the betrayers
Claiming what he hates,
Silver eye is blinded by now
Innocents are dying.
