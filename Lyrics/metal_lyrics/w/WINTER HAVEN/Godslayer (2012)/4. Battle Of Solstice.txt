[Music: Robert Haven, lyrics: Ivan Rodgon]

Oppressor of the human freedom
Crawler of the fear, your time has come
All your believers are professing sadness,
Here under your cloak.
Bringer of this frozen threshold.
Ravens (will) fly over your drained blood.

"I reek no soul, undead whore,
Watch this soil, harvesting sorrow.
Breath my curse, empty corpse,
As your lunges, get frozen by the storm"
War lust burns in my essence, 'till I see you fall.

Death will dance with us in battle
Earth will tremble
And the serpents coil into left hollows.
Get asunder the pride from core,
And bleed only the scorn.

Cannibal of your own race!
Wither king of many faces
Eater of the human race!
I will never give up!
