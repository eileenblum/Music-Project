[Music &amp; lyrics: IvÃ¡n Rodgon]

The gates of Endra-La have been tore
Down,damned will be as heavens
Death has incarnated
In a dead man with one aim.
The end of all gods,
The slayer of gods.
Bringer of tears,
Over deities throne.

The goddess is dead,
The guardians tamed,
At the gates of Endra-la

Endra-la bri an-da kelamonbretz,
Praver tende â ra yetz
Cre vore cre nare,
Deri Katy-o nore nabare,
Ezt rid krum kaynea
Zor ne vatre kor ne krebura
Kor ne kebura

Everon fa kayna,
Kivare verietz,
Bretz zandy Endra-la.
