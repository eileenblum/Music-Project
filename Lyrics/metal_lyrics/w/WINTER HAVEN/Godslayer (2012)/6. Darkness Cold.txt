[Music: Robert Haven, lyrics: Ivan Rodgon]

So the memories brought some tears,
Consuming the remains,
Remains of sadness, love and war.
Then you came by twilight,
Singing to the night,
Fate is cruel sometimes
But this time is like death!

"Faiths gone to emptiness
To oblivion's garden.
The cup of tears are overflowed"
Drowning all the dreams
"Came once more by twilight,
Sing to me in the night,
Fate is cruel sometimes,
But it's never like bell"

This darkness cold, where kingdoms fall,
It's where the gods: has drown or love.

So the rhyme of ancient cries of time
Sings dull without a point
With empty characters, full of hope
Condemn to the void
Pain and love at twilight
Sadness in this words
Fate is cruel sometimes,
But it's always the same

This darkness cold, where kingdoms fall,
It's where the gods: has drown or love.

This darkness endures by the cold!!!!
