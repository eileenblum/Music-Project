[Music: R. Haven / I. Rodgon, lyrics: Ivan Rodgon]

Taste the mouth in the cold silence
Burning lips your weakness can't control
Pain and suffering lies over its tongue

A paradise you can't control
A burden lies over the Gods

Watch the pantheon of disaster
All it's greed just secrets fear
And words came unspoken from the mouth of advent storm

Singer of vengeance bring the song of the dragon
Huntress of vengeance there's no prey to be hunted
Seeker of sorrow, blinded by your own pride
Mouth of desolation, prey of advent storm

Wounded God, bring the twilight to your fate!
As the sky light cries by the night the downfall will raise

Crimson eyes!
Blood of Goddess!
This is your chance, regret your mouth
Or behold the pain where you will dive!!
