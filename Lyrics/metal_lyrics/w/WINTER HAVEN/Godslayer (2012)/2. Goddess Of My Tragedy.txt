[Music: Robert Haven / Ivan Rodgon, lyrics: Ivan Rodgon]

Another time or another life
With words well spoken,
Another time or another life,
Our hearts would've been closer,
Cry, tears drowning my heartâ¦
Beloved maiden cry.

Once your temple fell in darkness,
I've returned forged by the pain and nowâ¦
See what I've become.

In a fiend that you have one loved,
Forgive me my sin tonight,
Forsaken me in time
Every time my eyes watch over your dreams
Remember my essence
Is sunken in your heart

Now I shall slay the Goddess,
Leave this flesh,
Release her from this pain and now
See what I've become.

In a fiend that you have one loved,
Forgive me my sin tonight,
Forsaken me in time
Every time my eyes watch over your dreams
Remember my essence
Is sunken in your heart.

Hunger Goddess you must die,
You were who tore us apart
Maiden of the spear
Bring me back my heart

In a fiend that you have one loved,
Forgive me my sin tonight,
Forsaken me in time
Every time my eyes watch over your dreams
Remember my essence
Is sunken in your heart
