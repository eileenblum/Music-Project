I cry for love and seek shelter
For my bewildering mind
Only your shadow can prevent
My soul from fading away
My veins will burst

I fade away at your scent
Surrounds my senses
I'll break your spell
You are my shelter

There's a shadow hanging over me
As flowers wither
The shadows takes my hand
And I find shelter

Me from fading away
Into the nightfall eclipse
With your beautyful scent
Surrounding my senses

I - I cry
For the lust that you give
I - I cry
For the love that you give
Away  - in blasphemy
I take control
