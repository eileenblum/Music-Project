Pitful emblems
Stillstanding, lonely, wounded

Odious I feel towards my pitful emblems
My disgust grows as I foresee
Sowing my shell with enough courage
As I understand

Pitful emblems
Stillstanding, lonely
Wounded in my soul
Pitful emblems

To evade my frame mind
Like colourful illustrations
Seen with the eyes of a blind man

The quiet light
The tender illustrations
The dreadful, hidden emotion

The quiet light
I know so well
From before, hiding is not possible
