Dear passengers, take seat, the ride will procred
Never look back, never see why you ever get joyless
Never think twice, never step onboard the joyless journey
Never take seat, now you are a part of the joyless journey
Never look out, now the journey has begun

All that you need, we take it all away
The ride on the joyless journey
All that you need, you give it all away
The life on the joyles journey

Dreaming about sorts. Seeing what needs to be seen
Never look back, never see why you ever get joyless
Never think twice, never step onboard the joyless journey
Never take seat, now you are a part of the joyless journey
Never look out, now the journey has begun

Fourteen, longing, about. Seven, avenues, distant
Sombre eyes, sore. A matter of minutes, again...
Wild and without barriers

Never look back, nothing known of the distant joyless
Never think twice, to heights never realized joyless journey
Never take seat, nothing known of route joyless journey
Never look out, in the dreamless sleep

Never look back, never think twice
It all gets back to you now
Never take seat, never look out
You now are the dreamless sleep
