Face down, resign, weed out whatever takes shape
Breed, reclaim, clean the gene
Breed, reclaim, destroy the shape

All that is faced now is this order it's not working, is it?
We need to discover a quite thrilling mind bomb, not?
So all That I tell you, all that I tell you now
All that I teach you, all that I preach for you...

If you breed whenever you kill
How do you think the world end

All that is faced now is this order it's not working, is it?
All that I teach you, all that I preach for you...

If you breed whenever you kill
How do you think the world will feel

Face down, resign
Weed out whatever takes shape
Reclaim the genes
Pull back, as you trusted me too late

As the dying reduces the cleansing takes form and I'm begging you to 
see
Face the lying trust and I'm begging you, begging you, begging you 
to see

All that is faced now is this order it's not working, is it?
All that I teach you, all that I preach for you...

If you breed whenever you kill
How do you think the world will feel

Face down, resign
Weed out whatever takes shape
Reclaim the genes
Breed out, as you trusted me too late
