Won't you let her leave today inject the holy spirit in her
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your mercy inside

Won't you let her taste herself
And sterilize the sickness

Won't you let her breathe today inject the holy spirit in her
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your mercy inside

She goes down, she goes down
She goes down in suite 304
She goes down, she goes down
She goes down, the sacred whore

As the skycrape imge cies, in neon lights it peaks itself

Won't you let her breathe a recipe for drugs to see clear
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your grace inside

Won't you let her breathe today inject the holy spirit in her
Tell her what she needs to hear and let her feel your needle inside

Won't you let her taste her sins
And sterilize the sickness

She goes down, she goes down
She goes down in suite 304
She goes down, she goes down
She goes down, she bows in neon lights
