Succumb your inferior fright - razorblades
Empty the cosmic glass - cut the stream
Taste my organic vengeance - razorblades
Have a look at yourself - in the night of shame

Taste my organic vengeance - razorblades
Be ashamed of yourself - in the night of shame

I stand before you
With stains in my mind
The pain, the sorrow
In the night you never came

The pain, the sorrow
In the night you never came
The lies, the horror
In the night, the night of shame

Taste my organic vengeance - razorblades
How can you live with yourself - in the night of shame

The pain, the sorrow
In the night you never came

The pain, the sorrow
In the night you never came
