I told you twice so many times these day
I told you all I had to say

Under water I can't love you, like I told you twice
Inder water when I touch you,
my hands freeze to ice

I see you now, I see you walking now
I see you walking now, walking on phantom ice
I told you twice so many times these days
I told you all I had to say

Under water I can't love you,
like I told you twice
Under water when I touch you,
my hands freeze to ice

I see you now, I see you walking now
I see you walking now, walking on phantom ice

Whatever I do, whatever I say, I won't make
this nonsense remain seated anyway
Whatever I see, whatever I hear, I won't be
walking this phantom path anymore
Whatever I feel, no matter how much I drank
I won't make it this time anywhere
Whatever you claim, whatever you offer,
I know you don't mean it - no more

Under water I can't love you, like I told you twice
Under water when your eyes glance,
I am about to die
Under water I can't love you,
like I told you twice
Under water when I touch you,
my hands freeze to ice

I feel you now, I feel you walking now
I feel you walking now, walking on phantom ice
My lungs are filled with water as my body
starts to cease
I wonder if these crysatl mountains
are meant for me
