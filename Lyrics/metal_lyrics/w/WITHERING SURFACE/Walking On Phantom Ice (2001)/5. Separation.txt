Seperate my soul and damage it to yell
Seperate my state and pull out this noise
Seperate the volume of my neurotic mind
Seperate me from this peaceful frottage bomb

Seperate my soul and damage it to yell
Seperate my state and pull out this noise
Seperate the volume of my neurotic mind
Seperate me from the cyanide blasting rose

Seperate my soul and damage it to yell
Seperate my soul, from scornful laughters realm

Separation - down this dirty hole where niosy beauty become 
separation
Down this dirty where cheerful become hypotonic
Down this clean sober hole piss stained ears pray for seperation

...damage it to yell
Seperate my state and pull out this noise
Seperate the volume of my neurotic mind
Seperate me from talking test tubes, press play

Seperate my soul and damage it to yell
Seperate my state and pull out this noise
Seperate the volume of my neurotic mind
Seperate me from talking test tubes, press rewind

Separation - down this dirty hole where niosy beauty become 
separation
Down this dirty where cheerful become hypotonic
Down this clean sober hole scalpelsm patterns cut seperation
Seperate from me
