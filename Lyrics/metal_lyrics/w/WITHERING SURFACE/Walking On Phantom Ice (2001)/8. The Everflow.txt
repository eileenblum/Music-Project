I scream into the everflow
And I'm begging for mercy
The silence of the magic wife
As my life lies in his glass of faith

Whenever I scream, I pray inside
Whenever I scream, I break inside

The words of whisper from his mouth
But in his eyes
I see what I want to see
Looking, reflecting

A serpents eyes
Senseless, take me to the other side of righteousnes
Please now, guide me, take me
Looking, reflecting

The colour of black makes the white disappear
Sadness, I'm rubbing in the wound so deep
Raping, deceiving, the sense of delay
Oh, Josephine, did I really need to know?

I scream into the everflow
And I'm begging for mercy
The silence of the magic wife
As my life lies in his glass of faith

Whenever I scream, I pray inside
Whenever I scream, I break inside

The words of whisper from his mouth
But in his eyes
I see what I want to see
Looking, reflecting
A serpents eyes, senseless
Take me to the other side of righteousnes
Please now, guide me, take me
guide me to my destiny
