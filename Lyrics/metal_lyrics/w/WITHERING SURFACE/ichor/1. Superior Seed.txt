Illustrated thoughts undescribable foams
Shadows of blue scrapes
Selfish, unprevailed, to everflowing extinct
Cells, cocooned, protected

Tissues, illustrated, visionable by
Black everflowing sense,
Unknown species take human form
Desired - into uncanny demise

Selfish, unprevailed
Tomorrow already looks
Better than yesterday
Worse than ever

And though everything remains
Features, creatures now
Tomorrow already looks
As a dying illustration

Drawn, written and calculated
Basic values have
No age, eventhough it shapes
Six above the calculated
Tombs, of my Armageddon
As the moonlight shines
