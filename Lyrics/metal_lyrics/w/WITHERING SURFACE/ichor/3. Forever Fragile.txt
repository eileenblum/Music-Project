A Photo In A Frame
Old I Dwell Here Sad
The Clock Keeps Ticking Still
Blisfully Ignorant

The Mourning In My Light
A Passage Through My Fright
The Shape Of My Inside
Is Wounded And Fragile

Forever Fragile - Eternally Yours
Forever Fragile - Eternal Divorce

The Mourning In My Light
A Passage Through My Life
The Shape Of My Inside
Is Wounded And Pure Fright

Finally I See
What Was Meant To Be
Please Give Me Hope
Let Me Die Fortunate

Forever Fragile - Eternally Yours
Forever Fragile - Eternal Divoce
Forever Fragile - Eternally Yours
Forever Fragile - Eternal Force

My Blissful Ignorance
Like Veins Cut In Wood
Reflecting Endlessness
Of My Longing After You/Truth
Waiting For Your True Self
