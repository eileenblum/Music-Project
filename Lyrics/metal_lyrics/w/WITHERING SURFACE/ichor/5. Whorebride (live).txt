As She Enters The Church
In Her White Dress Ready To Burst

The Whole Crowd Spelled By Her Charm
Not Knowing She Cause Such Harm

Cuttling To Hhe Fathers Protection
Knowing She Will Never Face Rejection

But Can She Decline And Protect Her Pride
No, She Is The WhoreBride
She Is My WhoreBride
Til' The End Of Time

The Rings That I Bought
The Flowers That I Gave
The Presents That I Brought
To My Future Wife/Bride So Fake

She Is My WhoreBride
I'm Cursed For The Rest Of My Life...
