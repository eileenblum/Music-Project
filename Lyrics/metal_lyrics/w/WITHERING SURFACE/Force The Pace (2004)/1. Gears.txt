Letâs put this work horse in gear, canât wait to see where it goes
One two, look back, this is where it all begins
Three four, and more, to make it happen
Five Six, give it all it takes to get me there.

Loading in all the gears to get me there
Giving up everything to get me here.

All I ever wanted was to be like you
And all I ever needed was to fall with you

All I ever wanted was to be like you
And all I ever needed was to fall right through
