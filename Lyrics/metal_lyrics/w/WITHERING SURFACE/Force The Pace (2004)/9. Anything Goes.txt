Sign this piece of paper, youâre useless, I steal your ignorance
Business is business and business is war.
If youâre not in for real, youâre out, get it now, you stupid fuck.
This is not your game, because anything goes.

Anything Goes â get it now
Anything Goes in this game, and this game you lost.

So tell me Iâm the one without views
Tell me Iâm the freak, not you, but me
Tell me Iâm the one to be tied up,
Tell me Iâm the freak, not you, not them
Anything Goes

So tell me Iâm the one to be disgraced
Tell Iâm the freak in this practical theory
Tell me how it is when it comes down to it
Tell me right into my face
When anything goes
