Youâre stripped, vulgar - your pulse points none
Useless talent - deprecate us from your talent
Take your broken pride, exhaust your basic quote
You lying thief, youâre stripped to the bone

Morality by all means, a favour to us all
So heal, and show us how

Out of shape, out of mind and out of time

Morality by all means, a favour to us all
Go reach your purity

Take off all your clothes.
Iâd like to see who you really are. Again.
Force The Pace. Ignore the speed limits.
I know you hate who I become.
So do I, sweetheart.
Donât write home about it

Youâre stripped, vulgar - your pulse points none
Draining your pathetic body for energy

Out of shape, out of mind and out of time
Draining your body for energy
The fluid acid end up being no good
