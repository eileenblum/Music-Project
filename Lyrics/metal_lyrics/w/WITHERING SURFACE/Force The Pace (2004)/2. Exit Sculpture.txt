Have you ever felt the way I feel?
Have you ever been down the road like me?
Where you stand, you turn, you feel like me
Start to smile and pray for ecstasy

Stop bringing the bad news
Whatever comes your way
You know the feeling as it comes my way

What you see is what you get
Lie down, donât pretend
Things will get better
They will not

You have to exit your sculpture, exit sculpture
Exit sculpture as it all comes down
Exit sculpture, leave your void
Exit sculpture, as it hits the ground

Waiting, seeing, upon the seven shores
Waiting, seeing, abandoned, I rise
