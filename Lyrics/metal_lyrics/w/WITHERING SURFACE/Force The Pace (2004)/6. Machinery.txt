Deep inside of the machinery
You know you have to wait
Deep inside of the machinery
You know you have to fake

Facing all your enemies
Compel whatever it may seem
Compel whatever it shall be

So many times you tried
Or are you just wasting time
And all the bullshit, all the lies
You know I did what I needed to
You know I did get a grip

So many times I wondered why
Are you just wasting time
Is it bullshit, is it lies
Do you do what you did
So many times you tried
Are you wasting time
You know I did what I needed to, you know I did get a grip
