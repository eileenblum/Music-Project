Look around you, is this what you want.
Look for a compromise and all you get is laughter.
This is not what anyone deserves.
This is not culture.

Crawl against the stream
Traffic jam of dreams
Your nose is bleeding
Fudge along, a ticking bomb

Take me down the alley of dreams
Where the future is free, the dope is clean
And now please let me in
Take me down the alley of dreams
Where the future is clean, the dope is free
So please let meâ¦

Look around you, is this what you want.
Look for a compromise and all you get is laughter.
This is not what anyone deserves.
This is not your culture.
Comprehensive, a wide screen TV of nails

Aspire the atomistic spines

Aggro-culture, apprehensive for and to majorities

Look around you, is this what you want.
Look for a compromise and all you get is laughter.
This is not what anyone deserves.
Discrete the gravity.

Take me down the alley of dreams
Where the future is free, the dope is clean
And wonât you please let me in
Take me down the alley of dreams
Where the future is clean, the dope is free
So please let meâ¦
