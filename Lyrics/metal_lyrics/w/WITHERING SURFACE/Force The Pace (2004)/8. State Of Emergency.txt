Keep indoors, a million excuses
Bash through the cellophane
Feel as if itâs no good
Wrapped up and tried like a freak
Displace the supplant, canât hardly see
Is this freak not just you and me?

Expounder this trampled soil of shit
Foil the obligations and disturb the views

Didnât you see the news today?
Heaven and earth will burn andâ¦
The angel of doom will fall from the sky
Didnât you face the truth today?
Heaven and earth will burn andâ¦
The state of emergency will ask you why

What we need is a state of emergency
Is it a wonder this place leads to denial
A state of preparation, a neutral state of shame

Expounder this trampled soil of shit
Foil the obligations and disturb the views
What we need is state of shame
Is it a wonder this place leads to denial

State of Emergency, a neutral state of shame
State of Emergency, a tramped, toxic soil of shit
