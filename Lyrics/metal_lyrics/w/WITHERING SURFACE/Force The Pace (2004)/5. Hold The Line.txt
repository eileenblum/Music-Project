Accept this tender breeze breaks you within these walls
Your image thaw the freezing walls, flavours break the frost

Hold the line
Confess your freedom
Take the time
Donât go off the rails

Hold the line
You need to paint this image
Take the time
These walls need flavours

Wisdom is strength and strength is freedom
Put yourself in this box now
Prove your faith was not foreseen
And touch your paintings, touch them now, touch them now with melting kisses

Will your invisible army defend you?
Will they take the time? Confess you need to rest

Ease down your moral ethics, face yourself, your strength
But hold the line, donât let it melt, as your life goes on

Wisdom is strength and strength is freedom
Put yourself in this box now
Prove your faith was not foreseen
And touch yourâ¦ all the way now

Somebody, somewhere may place you in center
Prove your faith was not foreseen and feel it
All the way now, all the way, all the ways with melting kisses
