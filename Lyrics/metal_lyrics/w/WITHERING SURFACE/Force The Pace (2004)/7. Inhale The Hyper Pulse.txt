When you thought you stood in line, was when it all fell down

Sub seed the lead, the conscious of your greed
Sub feed, so weakâ¦

Excretion of morality
Deplore the purity
Makes wounds infiltrate
Survival of the fittest
Into jet-sets of disease

Control the spine of your engine
Control the spine of your god
Black out the leech in your pulse now
Inhale the hyper pulse

When you thought you stood in line, was when it all fell down
Sub seed the lead, the conscious
