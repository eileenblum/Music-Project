SHE Gave Me KISSES
That Let My Soul
Right Out Of My LIPS
The Sound Of HER Breathing
Made Flowing FIRE Burn Me Up

HER Glowing Blushing
An Unknown Will To Satisfy
Rather Than Gleaming Bashfulness
SHE Will Defy

SHE Will Defy
SHE Will Defy HER Will
SHE Will Defy
SHE Will Defy My THRILL

Let My Eyes Devour HER
Let Me Touch The UNSEALED

With My Eyes
I Stole All HER NAKED Grace
Wishing To Keep This Sight
And Leave No Trace

SHE Will Cry
SHE Will Cry For HER Will
SHE Will Cry
SHE Will Cry For My THRILL

HER Trail Of Tears
SHE Will Deny
HER Trail Of Tears
HER Sweet Little Lies

HER Trail Of Tears
HER Sweet Little Lies
HER Trail Of Tears
Will SHE Defy

Of Your Eagerness
Do Not Be Scared
Ask Yourself
Have You Ever Dared?
To Let Anyone Come This Close?
I Am The First, You Arouse?

SHE Gave Me KISSES
That Let My Soul Right
Out Of My LIPS
The Sound Of HER Moaning
Made All My Senses
Freeze So Deep
SHE Will Deny
SHE Will Deny HER Will
Will SHE Deny
SHE Will My Thrill

SHE has Defied.....

"No matter how hard I try,
the dream of us never seems to
fade"
