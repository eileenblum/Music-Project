Breathing, I'm Breathing
All The COLOURS Of My Mood
Breathing, I'm Breathing
YELLOW As The LIES
Breathing, I'm Breathing
GREEN As SHE Once Could

The End Of The Sun
COLOURS All Around
To The RAINBOW I Run
Breathing,
I'm Only Breathing PURPLE Now

The End Of Myself
COLOURS All Around
To The End I Run

Only Now I Know
When I See The Landscape
Convered In SNOW
That The ROYAL Thieves
Will Thrimble Me Down
From The OVERFLOW
Of Will For Letting
Lettering Me In
And Crawl Inside Of HER
My COLOURFUL Breath
Prevents Me Now
I'm The PURPLE PRINCE
Of Carelessness

I Ride In My PURPLE Coach
GOLDEN In Its Own
Shape And COLOUR
On The Way
To A COLOURFUL CARNIVAL
I FEEL Like All Is In
BLACK And WHITE
PURPLE Creatures Carry Me
To The Origin Of The Almighty
Who PAINTED The Univers

And All Because Of HER

Breathing, I'm Breathing
All The COLOURS Of My Mood

Breathing, I'm Breathing
YELLOW As The LIES

Breathing, I'm Breathing
GREEN As SHE Once Could

Breathing, I'm Breathing
BLUE As HER Lying EYES

Breathing,
I'm Only Breathing PURPLE Now
Breathing,
I'm Breathing PURPLE As THINE

If we could let colours decide our
destiny, the world would be a
better place"
