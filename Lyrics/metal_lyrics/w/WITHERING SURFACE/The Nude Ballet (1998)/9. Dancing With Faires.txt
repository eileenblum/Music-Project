Unspeakable TRUTH
The Coming Of WAVES
The Coming Of WAVES
From The Unhidden Cage Of Your
Mind
Increadibly BLIND
The Coming Of LUST
The Coming Of LUST
From HER WIDESPREAD THIGHTS
But Why Care Less, cos

On The HOLY Ground
You Won't Hear A Sound
As I'm DANCING
With FAIRIES All Around
On The HOLY Ground
My NEW LOVE Is Found As I'm DANCING
With FAIRIES All Around

On The HOLY Ground
My Keen LUST Is Ground
As I'm DANCING
With FAIRIES All Around
On The Deceased Ground
In LOVE FLOWERS I Drown
As I Close My Eyes
And FAIRIES Make Me WISH

As It WITHERS Down Through
YEARS
The Mourning In My TEARS
The Coming Of LUSTFUL WAVES
A BLIZZARD Turns To A FLAKE
An Ancient COLOUR Now Awakes
Before My Eyes
On Stars I DANCE Away
SPREAD My Wings Anf Fly, Fly...

On The HOLY Ground
My Keen LUST Is Ground
As I'm DANCING
With FAIRIES All Around
On The Deceased Ground
In LOVE FLOWERS I Drown
As I Close My Eyes
And FAIRIES Make Me COME

"I have been much of a
dancer muself, really,
but an invitation like this
is hard to resist"
