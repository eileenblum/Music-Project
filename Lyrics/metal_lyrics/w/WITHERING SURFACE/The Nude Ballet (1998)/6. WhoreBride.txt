As SHE Enters The CHURCH
In HER WHITE DRESS Ready To
Burst
The Whole Crowd Spelled By HER
CHARM
Not Knowing SHE Cause Such HARM

Cutting To HER FATHER's Protection
Knowing SHE Will Never Face
Rejection
But Can SHE Decline And Protect
HER PRIDE
No, SHE Is The WhoreBride

SHE Is My WhoreBride
Til' The End Of Time

The RINGS That I Brought
The FLOWERS That I Gave
The PRESENTS That I Brought
To My FUTURE WIFE/BRIDE So Fake

SHE Is My WhoreBride
I'm Cursed For The Rest Of My
Life...

"Nothing can express how much
harm me beautiful bride caused
when her inner beast let lose its
whore"
