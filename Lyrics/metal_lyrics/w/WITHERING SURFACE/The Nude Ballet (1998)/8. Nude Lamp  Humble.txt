NUDE &amp; Humble
In Your FOOTSTEPS I Stumble
NUDE &amp; Humble
When I FEEL You I Tumble

Let Me Steal This Moment From You
Now
I'd Make A DEAL With God To Make
It TRUE

NUDE &amp; Humble
In Your FOOTSTEPS I Stumble
NUDE &amp; Humble
When I FEEL You I Tumble

Oh, It Gets Dark
Oh, It Gets Lonely
On The Other Side From You
I FALL Through WITHOUT You

NUDE &amp; Humble
In Your FOOTSTEPS I Stumble
NUDE &amp; Humble
When I HEAR You I Tumble

The Sort Of BLUE Between CLOUDS
When The SUN Comes Out
The Sort Of Blue In Those EYES
I Get Hung About

The Sort Of Blue Between CLOUDS
When The SUN NEVER Comes Out
The Sort Of BLUE In Those EYES
I've ALWAYS Been Hung bout

NUDE &amp; Humble
In Your FOOTSTEPS I Stumble
NUDE &amp; Humble
When I ADORE You I Tumble

Let Me Steal This Moment Now
I'd Make A DEAL With GOD To Make
It TRUE
Let Me Steal This Moment From You
Now
I'd Make A DEAL With GOD To Make
It THROUGH

NUDE &amp; Humble
In Your FOOTSTEPS I Stumble
NUDE &amp; Humble
When I MEET You I Tumble

Oh, It Gets Dark
Oh, It Gets Lonely
On The Other Side From You
I have FALLEN Through WITH You

"You are the only one who knows I
have lost myself"
