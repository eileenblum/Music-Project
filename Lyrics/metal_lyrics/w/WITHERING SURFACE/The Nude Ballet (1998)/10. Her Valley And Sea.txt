Rising Up In HER Valley And HER
Sea
I'm Going Down, Down Between
HER Valley And HER Sea

And HER Virtousness
Cause WELLEQUIPPED Perfection
HER WELLTRAINED WHISP
In My POSSESSION

Rise In HER Valley And HER Sea
I'm Going Down In
HER Valley And HER Sea

HER Scratching Hunger Inside
Thy FEMALE Thou Not Lack
A FLUID Approaching
A WOMAN's Attack
Cause Revolution

HER Scatching Hunger Inside
Thy FEMALE Thou Not Lack
A FLUID Approaching
In My POSSESSIOn

I'm Feeling Oh So Gone
So Gone, So Gone
I'm Feeling So ALONE
I'm So ALONE, So LONELY

I'm Rising Up In HER Virtousness
And We're WHOLE

But I'm Gone, I'm Gone

HER Valley And Sea

I'm Feeling So ALONE
ALONE, So LONELY
I'm Feeling LOVED
LOVED, SO LONELY

"I will never feel like this again,
you have ruined every pleasure"
