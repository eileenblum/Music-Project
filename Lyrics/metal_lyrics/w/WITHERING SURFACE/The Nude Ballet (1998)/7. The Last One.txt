I forgot to breathe
When we passed away
And our lovely shades
Turned to threatening skies
I forgot to breathe
As our lovely shades
Turned to threatening skies
Wishing to swallow us

I'm looking through the wind
Wishing to let you in
I'm looking through the wind
Wishing that you break in

You are the last one
You are the last one here

I forgot to breathe
When we passed away
And our lovely shades
Turned to threatening skies
I forgot to breathe
As our lovely shades
Turned to threatening skies
Wishing to swallow us

I'm looking through the wind
Wishing to let me in
I'm looking through the wind
Wishing that you break in

You are the last one
You are the last one here

The last one, the last one, the last one here to stay

I forgot to breath the day my life passed away
Your beautiful shadow turned to threatening skies

I forgot to breathe
As our lovely shades
Turned to threatening skies
Wishing to swallow us

I'm looking through the wind
Wishing to let me in
I'm looking through the wind
Wishing that I break in

You are the last one
You are the last one here

The last one, the last one, the last one here to stay
The last one here to stay

I let you in, I let you break my seal

You are the last one here to stay?
