WHITE And PURE
An ODE To Him
Who Patience Is A GIFT

WHITE And PURE
An ODE To Him
Who Acting Is A GIFT

WHITE And PURE
A GIFT OF HER
Who Is A WHORE

Once Shining So Dark
Through The Magic Of HER
And The Glancing Sun Touches
The Wet SKIN

Once Shining So Dark
And The Glancing Sun Touches
The Wet SKIN Of It

This Is An ODE
This Is An ODE For You

This Is An ODE
This Is An ODE I Made For You

Inside Me Is FIRE Burning
The Forest To The Ground

I Weep For Innocence
Of What Made My World Fevered
Vanished Is The Forest
And Fire Breaths Darkness
In My VEINS Cut Up
By The Horned One

This Is An ODE
This Is An ODE I Made For You
WHITE And PURE
An ODE To Those
Whose COLOUR Is A GIFT

"We hail those who know they
were born to be superior"
