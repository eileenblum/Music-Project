Alone
In the night so cold
In darkness I walk
Led by the light of the moon
And him

Lord of the night
Darkness and hate
Guide the blade, spill the blood
The sacrifice is yours
Solitary winter night

And now I stand alone
Alone in the night
In this world that holds nothing for me
I shall be... Satan take my soul

Damnation, endless night

In this solitary grave to be
Alone in the woods
Death creeps in like winter

Cold merciless death
Solitary winter night

Lord of the night
Darkness and hate
Guide the blade, spill the blood
The sacrifice is yours
Solitary winter night
