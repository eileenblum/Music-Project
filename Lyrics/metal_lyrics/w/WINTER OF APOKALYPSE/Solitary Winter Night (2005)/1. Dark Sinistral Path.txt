Construction by moon
This dark and sinistral path
Lucifers continuum

Cleansing me
In undead nature
To be etched in rancid soil
An empty blackness, DEATH

Scarlet eyed
Bloated with black hatred
Hell descending
From mist wreathed stars

Sprawling
In the dirt of the trail
A flame eyed demon
Stained black
In fire and starlight

Driven by furnace wings
Through a backdrop
Of blood splashed night

I choose
This dark and sinistral path
Into existence
All unseen
