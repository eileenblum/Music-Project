Black as the night, cold as death
Our darkness spreads it's wings
Across the Earth
To rape the soul of man
With the hate of the beast
Against the lives of the holy
This war we wage

Like the spike that bound your lord to his cross
And the spear that pierced his ribs
We are in the spear in the wound of the world
Black Metal of death
Unholy weapon of satan
Possessing the youth of the world
Commanding his will upon hordes

Hail the mighty king of hell!
