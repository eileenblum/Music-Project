I sit here alone and watch the sun die
A raven spreads its wings across the sky
Like wolves among sheep
Sent here to destroy gods throne
And in the sky, a horde in demonic flight
Our swords are for satan
Sent here to destroy gods fucking race

Alone, walking
Through these paths of death
A thousand warriors scream the name of satan
I walk this path at dusk... at dusk
Light the fire, let death reign... death reign
I sit here alone in the darkness of night
The howling of the wolves sends chills through the air
Your holy sons blood has been spilled

As I walk with satan
Prince of fire and night
We shall start the fire

As I walk with satan
Lord of nature and pain
We will reign eternal
Eternal years of sorrow, hate, pain and death
As I walk with satan
Prince of fire and night
We start the fucking fire
