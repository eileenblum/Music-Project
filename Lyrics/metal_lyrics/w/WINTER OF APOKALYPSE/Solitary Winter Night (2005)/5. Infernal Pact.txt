So I have seen the future
And walked the path of death
Over mountains with the devil
In the canyons of hell
Spread your black wings
Through frozen rivers of blood
Slit my wrists for you

So take me on the journey
Beyond the stars
Where shadows die
The infernal pact is ours
Take me away

I've seen the future and past
Dreams I've dreamt
Over fire hell
My soul turns black
Follow me servants of hell.
