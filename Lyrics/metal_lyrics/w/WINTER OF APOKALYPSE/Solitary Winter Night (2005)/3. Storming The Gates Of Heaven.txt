Onward we ride
Vengeance burning in our veins
Hell we bring
And death we fucking wield
The holy shall taste our fucking wrath
Gates divine
Blessed throne of knight
Ravaged, raped, defiled
And stained with the blood of your lord
That hate of satan burns your paradise
His flames... the only light

Bringer of bloodshed and evil
Master of the demons in hell
Swing the weapon of the reaper
Bestow thy plague of death beyond the gates

No light shall ever shine again
In this place once called heaven

We invert the cross of the holy
And desecrate all in the name of satan

Horns of the infernal beast
Shall cast its shadows over heaven
Forever
Darkness enshrouds the holy land
Satans endless night
