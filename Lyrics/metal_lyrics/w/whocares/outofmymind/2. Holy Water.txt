Change in the weather
Changing weather
It gets no better

Room for improvement
Room for rent
Needs money spent

I got no sense of purpose
I sit alone, I sit alone
Got no sense of belonging
Gettinâ nowhere, canât go home

Thereâs no one here me to help me drown my sorrows
With just a splash of holy water
And I canât see a thing beyond tomorrow
Thank the Lord for holy water

Born to be guilty
Born to be bad
Canât miss what canât be had

Itâs time for reflection
Time to think
Time to have another drink

I got no sense of purpose
I took the blame, but I felt no shame
Iâve got no sense of belonging
Itâs gettinâ late, canât simulate

Thereâs no one here me to help me drown my sorrows
With just a splash of holy water
And I canât see a thing beyond tomorrow
Well thank the Lord for holy water

I got no sense of purpose
I took the blame, but I felt no shame
Iâve got no sense of belonging
Itâs gettinâ late, but I canât go home

Hey brother, come and help me drown my sorrows
Iâm getting low on holy water
I donât wanna see beyond tomorrow
Bless the Lord for holy water

Thereâs no one here me to help me drown my sorrows
Oh, just a splash of holy water
I canât see a thing beyond tomorrow
Bless you all for holy water
