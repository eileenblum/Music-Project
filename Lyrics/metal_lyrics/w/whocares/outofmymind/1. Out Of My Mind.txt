It took a while but it drove me senseless
Now they say Iâm non compos mentis
Little wonder Iâm still here at all
Staring out from the guilt free on the wall

Itâs what happens when you mess with matches
Everythingâs reduced to ashes
Now Iâm lost and brokenhearted
My dreams had barely started

Youâre never gonna drive those demons
Out of my mind
I know youâve gone, but youâre never
Out of my mind
Still see those pictures of hell, sends me
Out of my mind

My memoryâs photographic
Some of those images stopped the traffic
It wasnât me, it wasnât you
Feel that itâs nothing new

Iâm not guilty, but Iâm conscious
A bad net weight on my conscience
Another thing I have to mention
Sadly thereâs no redemption

Youâre never gonna drive those demons
Out of my mind
I know youâve gone, but youâre never
Out of my mind
Still see those pictures of hell, sends me
Out of my mind

I want a lonely life
I want a lonely life

Youâre never gonna drive those demons
Out of my mind
I know youâve gone, but youâre never
Out of my mind
Still see those pictures of hell, sends me
Out of my mind
