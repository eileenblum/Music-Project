In the system of humanity
Spreads a prejudiced disease
The suppression of each generation
By the previous idealogy
To voice their opposition
To our ever-advancing culture
In varying forms of objection
Yet we continue to progress -
We must

Social fears
Fears of the righteous
We will fight their fatuous ideals
Social fears
Fears of the righteous
Smash down the walls that they erect and crush the restrictions

Social fears
Fears of the righteous
We will fight their fatuous ideals
Social fears
Fears of the righteous
Smash down the walls that they erect and crush the restrictions

In guise of political conservative
Or evangelical saint
The epitome of corruption
They become most dangerous
When legislative power is granted

They make laws of their morals
We must prove ourselves as formidable enemies
To this injustice and defend our civil freedom
The moral majority are victims of social fears
