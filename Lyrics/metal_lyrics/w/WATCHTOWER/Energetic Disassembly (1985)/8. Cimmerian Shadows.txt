Stifled screams fill the chamber
Bleeding minds flow through the door
Fallen kings have lost their power
Withering knights look upon in horror
Innocence captured, chained, and beaten
Minds strong, but bodies are weak
Innocents march toward their destruction
Suspecting their fate but unable to speak

With hands of red and hoods of black
They kill the leader then take the pack
Driven by greed and hungry for power
Like vultures they strike at man's darkest hour

The world grows cold and silent
Darkened by tainted ambition
The world is clouded by hatred and greed
Cimmerian darkness and evil condition

The silence is broken by the clash of swords
The masses revolt as vexation grows
With the oppressor's defeat man's world is saved
Til' the victors' intentions are the same as their foes...
