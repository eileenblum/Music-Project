Oceans push forward - Oceans recede
Continually altering the masses of land
Continents shift with massive force
And spread chaos among our crumbling cities

In retaliation we reap the land clean
Of it's wealth and resource
Only to mask it with oceans of concrete
A better environment?

This world we inhabit is in constant motion
Natural changes on a grand scale
While we live our lives and petty matters
Of human interaction and social stupidity

Violent change

Blasting away the dust of this earth
Are the winds of majestic power
Smashing our dwellings with no regret
Unpredictable and merciless

Scarring the ground with our machines of steel
Our extensions - our weapons
The cycle is complete
The battle is constantly fought

Violent change
Violent change
