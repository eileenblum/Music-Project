Theres an air of urgency, the wail of sirens pierces the night
The damage has already been done, irreversible accidents, security's tight
This is not a drill, it's a drastic tragedy to cope with
Time is the worst enemy, to those who play with the fate of man

Breakdown, warning - Nuclear nightmare, reality
Breakdown, warning - Contaminates society
Breakdown, warning - Radioactive atmosphere
Breakdown, warning - Mistakes are now becoming clear

Meltdown - Becomes a word of panic
Meltdown - Radiation burns the skin
Meltdown - The public has yet to be informed
Meltdown - Invisible killer closing in...

Breakdown, warning - Nuclear nightmare, reality
Breakdown, warning - Contaminates society
Breakdown, warning - Radioactive atmosphere
Breakdown, warning - Mistakes are now becoming clear

Geiger counters crackle in a frenzy, useless meters to prove our danger
An enemy that man created, how ironic that he cannot fight
Technology beyond control, build up of waste, no safe disposal

Breakdown, warning - Nuclear nightmare, reality
Breakdown, warning - Contaminates society
Breakdown, warning - Radioactive atmosphere
Breakdown, warning - Mistakes are now becoming clear to us!
