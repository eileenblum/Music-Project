Twilight undisturbed - a formidable silence
The mind rampant in its solitary depression
Vacuous feelings - the sudden strike of fear
Drawn into the nocturnal empire

A shadow strikes in the absence of light
And molds the terror into insanity
Hands claw at familiar faces - running from the unknown
Is there now something real?

Resist the unseen - the obscure
Resist the panic - painful foreshadowing
Destroy yourself - inflicted apprehension
Awaken subconscious to the primal fear!

Intrusive misery - the darkness closes in
Frantic fit of self-preservation
Impulsive action - screaming confusion
Imagination overpowers reason
