Human influence shapes human thought
Few question, few answer, praising innovation
Society seeking conformity
Society thriving on regulation
Observe and repeat, observe and repeat
Maintain the standard
Life is simulation, revision and impulse
Absence through presence

Still there is crime, still there is defiance
Conscious and manner scream for diversion
Controlled by confusion, confused by control
Control and Resistance

Control and Resistance
Control and Resistance

At an early age you were forced into submission
By your elders and school administration
By your peers you are pressed to Resist
And pressed into rebellion and indecision
Now you are food for the mental machine
Breeding acts of ignorance and despair
Men plotting their own demise
Through oblivion, through greed, through hypocrisy
Some of us are blind, some of us are frightened
And some cynical

Contradiction, revolution, controversy, centumacy
Self-preservation and malevolence
Feed the fear of death
Law and resistance in accordance with uniformity
In the thick of the fray
Yet violence and change by privacy
By freedom, we must Resist
