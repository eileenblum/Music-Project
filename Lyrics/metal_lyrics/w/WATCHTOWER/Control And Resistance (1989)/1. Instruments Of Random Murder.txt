Fast, safe, aspirin-free relief
The simple end to minor discomfort
Used by millions for years
No association with danger
Scattered across the land
Arose instances of unexplained deaths
Autopsies reveal the presence of --cyanide

Then by coincidence the facts are revealed
Connections between the deaths are made
Somewhere in the chain from factory to shelf
The capsules were tainted

We must question the motive of a killer
Who kills without vengeance, without apparent reason
And leaves death upon the innocent
Was it hatred for the entire human race
Or an attempt to destroy a corporation?

The small bottle of relief - the discolored capsules
The acrid odor of bitter almonds
Goes unnoticed into the body
It is soon absorbed into the blood
And destroys the human system
The victim falls to the floor
And dies in a matter of seconds

The search begins as the shelves are cleared
The horror spreads through the press
The murderer will most likely escape discovery -
And perhaps strike again!
