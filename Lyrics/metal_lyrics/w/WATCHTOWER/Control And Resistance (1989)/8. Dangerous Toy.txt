Can a device read your mind?
To be accused of misinformation
Is the subject clean, and machine
Guilty of distorted imagination?

A psychological change
Assumes relation to the act of deceit
Not legally accepted
Human judgement is considered

A pleading man Resists malicious observation
The electric chair misinterprets lies detected
A voluntarily accepted examination
His freedoms, rights, and privacy neglected

Could a dangerous toy be infallible?
An assembly in a state of suspense

Why should we account for its mistakes
And suffer the consequence?

A question of Control
Will produce the fear of anxiety
Further abuse of security
We ignore implications for a free society

The slightest glitch proves fatal - if swallowed
Calculated emotions and expressions
Claims of accuracy diminish
Inconclusive evidence left to its discretion
