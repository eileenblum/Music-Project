Maintaining a safe social order
Is one of our system's greatest chores
We're afraid to walk the streets alone at night
Our society sleeps behind locked doors
Lurking beneath the shadow's surface
Hiding under exterior silence
There exists in every individual
The potential for criminal violence
Crime after crime - conditioned criminality
Timed after time - randomized brutality
Reminds us we must live in fear

As we are held prisoner by the fear of assault

Our freedoms are compromised
As we are held prisoner by the fear of attack
Our freedoms are victimized
A psychopathic killer
A common teenage vandal
Both victims of instincts
They cannot handle

A fearful population rests
On the brink of insanity
An unfortunate aspect of human nature
Crime will exist as long as humanity

Some find they must resort
To predatory ways to survive
Some find they must kill
In order to stay alive
