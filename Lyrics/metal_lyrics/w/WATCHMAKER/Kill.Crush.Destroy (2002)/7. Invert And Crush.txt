stand upon nothing. preaching weak man. i have come to crush you. come deny me my stand. for crushed you'll
be. you and your beliefs. underneath my feet. wither and bleed. bleed beneath my feet. god is nothing but a
foundation upon which the weak stand. i will crush this foundation. and upon nothing again will you stand.
standing upon nothing. you are nothing but a man. i will kill you.
