the darkness of mere being. is the darkness of forever knowing yourself. but in being too blind to see it. too
blind to stop it. from running through your shaking fucking hands. only to taste it. what is left on your
fingers. to be sustained. by only the memory. the memory of what could have been. cloaked within darkness.
never to see the light. of your own beauty. but blinded by the fire of life. the darkness of mere being is the
darkness of never knowing yourself. but in being too blind to see it. you let it run through your fingers. not
to be touched by you ever again. this darkness has eclipsed your life. you are trapped within this shadow. this
shadow of being.
