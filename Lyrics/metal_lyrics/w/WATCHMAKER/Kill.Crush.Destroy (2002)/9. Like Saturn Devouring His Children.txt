i hate this past I once created. past events are all my wretched children. i hate all of my children. and I
like saturn will kill and eat them all. now they all must be devoured. past events are all my jealous
offspring. like children to be devoured by saturn. your home is now oblivion. here in me lies all of my
children. here in me lies oblivion.
