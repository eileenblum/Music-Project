salt. on fertile earth. stunting all growth from the inside. salt from my blood. labor of life. dead where I
stand. i have sown earth with blood. blood soaked earth yields nothing but dust. dust now my crop. from blood.
brings not but dust. i have sown earth with blood. blood soaked earth yields nothing but dust. i have killed
myself. i have sown earth with my own blood.
