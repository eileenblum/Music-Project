sow the seeds in our hearts. that will flower into evil. the beauty that cannot be touched. nor attained. and
that is its purpose. to create want where there is no need. fleeing our own gardens in pursuit of a single
petal. falling. falling this petal. fall from grace. you die just to touch it. for that which never existed.
sadly we flee our own gardens in pursuit of that which never was. never bearing witness to the fruits of our
labor. nor the flowers of our love. sow the seeds of evil. starve the seeds of love.
