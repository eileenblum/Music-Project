dear watchmen of all of our lives. we've gouged out our own seeing eyes. so that we may remain blind. and give
powers of vision to you. now lower your sight upon all. be masters of all our affairs. but who do you answer
to? and who indeed watches you? who watches the watchmen? i do. And i can see you. for what you are. and I can
stop you. dead. i. with gunscope renewing my sight. have targeted you with my eyes. and under your gaze and
your guise. i will drop you wherever you stand.
