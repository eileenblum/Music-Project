"We die to rise, the game begins"
We learn twilight from allergic sun
To run away, far away
Losing ourselves in allergic sun

Call my name through the darkness
And don't follow this allergic sun
Just one try...Try to find salvation
From allergic sun

You should know that the dream still lives in
My hatred to the sun
Try to find...Try to find salvation
From allergic sun

And as the fire meets the rain
We fall out of grace from the life began
Wondering how is it made?

We die to rise, the game begins
We learn twilight from allergic sun
To run away, far away
Losing ourselves in allergic sun

Call my name through the darkness
And don't follow this allergic sun
Just one try...Try to find salvation
From allergic sun
