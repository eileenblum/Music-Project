Spending...All your time
Screaming with emotion
Defending...Your selfish lies
It has bothered me
Searching...Occasion to
Deduce me from itself
There's nothing left to say
I declare silence now

I don't want any silence in the room anymore
Because my nerves are strained and I can't let it go
I can't bear this indifference from you never more
There's a curse between us, so this suffer is our cross

I don't want
To waste my life
Finding out the reasons

Forgiveness
Is a piece of thing
Which can't be in this room
