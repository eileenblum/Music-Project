Tonight we bury our truth
Which was lost from artistic lies
How many times I opened your eyes
But now it's time to say that it all dies

Give...Just...Trust...

Don't try to tell me what to do
I'm not your judge, you're not mine too
Those who went with me, I take away
And Let the Lie become your game

I move my way

We walk under one sky
I believe that you can feel
Just remember one thing
One will reap what he will sow
