You didn't learn and I said lies
That it's easier
I'm down again
On my brought down knees

I wish
I will 
I'll be this endless laughter
I wish
I will
Be patient for this after

The young man's depression
In wide and gloomy milky way
Embracing my shoulders
To leave all...My suffers

Beyond your doubts
You lose nothing
Let me in
And I'll justify your lies

Forgive nightmares
We are new games
Let me in
And I'll justify your will
