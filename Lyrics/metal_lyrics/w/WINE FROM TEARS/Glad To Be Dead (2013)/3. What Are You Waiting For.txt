And I open my eyes
from the shuttered dreams
for past away
I'm not going to pray

I won't justify
All of our sins
From me and you
We ain't gonna strain

Reduce the truth
As the last foundation
I'd give away
All that I have got

Here I stand on my knees
Facing your pure eyes
My guns are unloaded guns
Can't you see?

What do you wish?
What do you want?
I'm broken man inside!
What are you waiting for?

So, what do you wish?
What do you want?
Don't you see I'm broken?
What are you waiting for?

What is the pride, what it makes you feel?
What is the faith, when no one believes to you?
You know, everything I have
Is in my arms here

What is the pride, what it makes you feel?
What is the faith, when no one believes to you?
God knows, everything I want
Is you, is you, to come and save me!!
