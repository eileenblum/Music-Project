We've betrayed us
And no one left to blame
Ashes rise to heavens
No light from heaven falls

Twilight leaves nobody
The sky dries tears away
The sun is going out
The flash erases our names

The light goes down tonight
Live your latest night

What do you see?
At the end of your days

What have you done?
To save your soul tonight

And when the light goes down you see
the light at the end of this world
And you're soothing your pain
By a shotgun in your head

And all that you have done turns nothing
Like pure dreams of your youth
Like a circle in water
Transparent and smooth
