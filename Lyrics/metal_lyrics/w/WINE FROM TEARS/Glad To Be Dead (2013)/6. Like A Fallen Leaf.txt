Decide...I decide
It will...That it will
Suffice to suffer...To suffer

Dislike...I dislike
When you...When you
Spit in my...Spit in my soul

You're in my mind, You're in my mind
Take place no More, Take place no More
And for my heart, And for my heart
You're just a wound

Trample...Trample my soul
Like a fallen leaf
My dream breaks off the walls
