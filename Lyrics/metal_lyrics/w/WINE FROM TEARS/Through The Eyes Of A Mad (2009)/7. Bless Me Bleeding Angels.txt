Lay with me...
And take my hand...
Black birds above my head
Wild blood escapes so diligently

Nightlines are broken down
Adiposity of sadness
It's never early to escape
Bless me bleeding angels

I refuse severe sun
This artful light I damn
Leave my blood to run
Bless me bleeding angels

Here... devilry reigns
From the beginning
But on heaven, as well
We don't have a place
