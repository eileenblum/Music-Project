Bury my face in your arms
'Cause tonight I'm sinner
And when she says that she is right
She doesn't know the meaning

Follow my names when you sleep
Search for another fool
Don't try to trick me again
That's all that I wanted to say

Search... for a church
It overloads my madness
Forgive... all your dreams
I'm going to take you with me
... you'll see
