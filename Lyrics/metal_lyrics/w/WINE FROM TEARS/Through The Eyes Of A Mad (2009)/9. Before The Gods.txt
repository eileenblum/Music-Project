There was the times
When we lived so free
We had what we wanted to be
Before the gods...

Here comes the night
So deep inside
We used to love It
Before the gods

Before the gods
Before the gods, who reign this days
Before the wars
Before the wars, without pain
We had souls, inside our minds
Before the gods

Before the gods, a holy shit
Before the cages
Before the cages, that now we live
We dreamed to fly, we rise and die
Before the gods

We dreamed to fly
Now we`re dead inside
My arms are tired
Your eyes are blind

We used to live
Live out our lives
No one will bare
The laws of gods

Before the gods
Before the gods, who reign this days
Before the wars
Before the wars, without pain
We had ourselves, inside our minds
Before the gods
