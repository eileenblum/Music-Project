Once... my tears came across, before
My eyes... could send farewell to the sky

Accept the pain that you left to me
And let, just let me be me again

My desire!
All for nothing...
Escapes tonight
But still my lover

Haven't you heard about sunshine?
Haven't you seen these angel faces?
What have you done, my little dirty thing
This is my tears, and they, and they belong to you...
