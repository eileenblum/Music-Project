Beside myself the shadows creep like old memories
And cruel winds, they laugh at me, they are my enemies
I sit in the corner, feel guilt and wrecked,and wait for them, and they come back
My weakness sell my soul to them, to seven rounds that reign in hell

One... I only want to touch the sun
But I'm drown, and I can only feel disharm

I'm close to katatonia...
No light around,no voice of mercy
And my surround is mindless corpses
My body doesn't obey me
Alone like a stone, so proud but free..
