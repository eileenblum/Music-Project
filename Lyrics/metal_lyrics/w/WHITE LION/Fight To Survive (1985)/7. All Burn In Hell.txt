Oh, why don't you just leave me alone
Your the kind I choose not to know
I don't want you to see you I am
Your the kind that just tries to (command)
You try to fool me and make me look so blind
And you told so many stories
But the lies you told were only in your mind
Now I ride into the glory

[Chorus:]

All burn in hell
You're choosing well
All burn in hell
You fall and (fail)

If you think you're still in demand
Look inside you're a small frayed end
Now you don't want to be left alone
I know your rotten (goal) will unfold
You (demand) me the things I can (obey)
Now you're begging me for glory
Seems to me this has always been the way
The final chapter of the story

[Chorus]
