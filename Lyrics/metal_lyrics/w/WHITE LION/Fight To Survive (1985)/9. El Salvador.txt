He could barely remember
When the fighting began
It was early September
When he lost his old man
Soon the time came to leave there
And to start a new life
How it seems so unfair
When they gave him a gun and a knife

[Chorus:]
So he fights with a gun in his hand
For what reason he can't understand
Yeah, he fights with a gun in his hand
For the freedom (of their land)

Can you hear them crying out
All the people in El Salvador
Can you hear a distant shout
From the people in El Salvador

As he stares at the ceiling
He thinks back quite aways
It was him that was dealing
Tell you those were the days
As he stares at a white dove
Tears roll down on his face
And then once filled with love
That only God himself can replace

[Chorus]

Can you hear the crying out
All the people in El Salvador
Can you hear a distant shout
From the people in El Salvador
(cross your heart and hope to die)
For the people in El Salvador
Still they kill not knowing why
All the people in El Salvador

Can you hear them cry?
Can you see them die?
Can you tell me why?
All the people in El Salvador
