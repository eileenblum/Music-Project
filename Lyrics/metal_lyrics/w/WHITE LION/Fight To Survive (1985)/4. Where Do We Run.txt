Stare down at the river
Look up to the trees
There are signs of confusion
They are frightening me
The glowing, the blue light
The raise from the sun
They're already changing
Or has it begun
We are people all over
Wanting only to live
(It) is life we are seeking
Hey you must be barely come true

[Chorus:]
(Where do we go)
When there's no place to (run)
When it's hot without sun
Tell me where do we run?

This is not an illusion
It is truly (a scare)
All our lives in a frenzy
All our hearts in despair
There are times when we wonder
Will it be life or dead?
And is light we are seeking
Hey you, must be barely come true

[Chorus]
