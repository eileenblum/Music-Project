And it all began the day that he was born
The boy looks up the sky's blue the sun so warm
At time spent (that's numbered)
The young ones on the loose
And the clock keeps turning , times start spinning fast
Cooling off his burning fire, through his soul
He brings on hope, fight for survival
You saw the frantic and he sees it falling down
He feels the emptiness that pushes him towards the ground

[Chorus:]
Oh, bring out your shield
Raise high your sword
Fight to survive
Run, plea for your life
Look toward the sun
Fight to survive

As you walk along the shore
Your thoughts run by
The questions are your empty thoughts
thoughts deep inside and you feel like thunder
Since you are on the loose
As the times keep going lives fly by fast
Then you feel you're growing tired
You say no, look toward the sun, fight for survival
You saw the frantic and he sees it falling down
He feels the emptiness that pushes him towards the ground

[Chorus]
