Let's pack the bags and head on our way
There ain't no reason for us to stay
We have done everything we can do
Now it's time for me and for you

There is a big world waiting for us
I hope we find what we have lost
Look ahead and don't be afraid
Where there is love there won't be hate

And where there is a rescue
There shines a light
So we both can find the way
From wrong to right
And into the fire
We touch the flame
And always remember we are the same

I will
Run through your fire and into your hell
I will
Cause I am your father
And you always be my son

So much stuff that we have done
So many memories so much fun
There ain't no limit to what we can do
And I will listen and follow you

These chains can't be broken
These walls won't come down
And you have a place right here
In this old town
Right from the beginning
A promise I made
That we'd be together through love and hate

I will
Run through your fire and into your hell
I will
Cause I am your father
And you always be my son

My shining star my brave little one
What would I do if you were gone
I have given my life for you
Do you know that I love you

I will
Run through your fire and into your hell
I will
Cause I am your father
And you always be my son

I will
Run through your fire and into your hell
I will
Cause I am your father
And you always be my son
