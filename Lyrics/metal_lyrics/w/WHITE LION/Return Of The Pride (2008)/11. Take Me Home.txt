[European Bonus Track]Stand on the outside looking at you
Trying so hard calling for you
I had been given a place in your heart
Now there is something that torn it apart
Wandering far blind to the lies
Now can't you see that I've opened my eyes
Out in the rain I'm calling for you

To take me home
Out of the cold
Back in the warmth of your arms
Take me home
Love me to death
Hold me like never before

Somebody told me they saw you alone
Looking so empty eyes like a stone
Far in the distance I called out your name
Hoping that somehow you I'd do the same
Wasting the time wasting the day
Trying to reach you but you're far away
Deep in the night Ik'm waiting for you

To take me home
Out of the cold
Back in the warmth of your arms
Take me home
Love me to death
Hold me like never before

And why was I such a fool
That really didn't know
You tried to show me many times
And let me know
Now here I am again knocking on your door
Showing you this man is not
The way he was before

Wandering far blind to the lies
Now can't you see that I've opened my eyes
Out in the rain I'm waiting

To take me home
Out of the cold
Back in the warmth of your arms
Take me home
Love me to death
Hold me like never before

To take me home
Out of the cold
Back in the warmth of your arms
Take me home
Love me to death
Hold me like never before
