I have seen it
With my own two eyes
I have tasted it
Like a million times
I have walked it
For miles and miles
And in the end well I wasn't quite sure
Just where I began

If you ask me
Was it all worth fighting for
If I told you
That I don't know anymore

Hey, hey, hey
Gonna do it my way
Gonna do it today
Like I did yesterday
Do you hear what I say

I've been through it
And I barely got out
I was helpless
And I screamed and shouted
Then I gambled
And I lost it all
But when you come from the streets
Then the streets are where you belong

If you ask me
What the hell is going on
I will tell you
That it's only just begun

Hey, hey, hey
Gonna do it my way
Gonna do it today
Like I did yesterday
Do you hear what I say

Hey, hey, hey
Gonna do it my way
Gonna do it today
Like I did yesterday
Do you hear what I say

Hey, hey, hey
Gonna do it my way
Gonna do it today
Like I did yesterday
Do you hear what I say

If you ask me
What the hell is going on
I will tell you
That it's only just begun

Hey, hey, hey
Gonna do it my way
Gonna do it today
Like I did yesterday
Do you hear what I say

Hey, hey, hey
Gonna do it my way
Gonna do it today
Like I did yesterday
Do you hear what I say
