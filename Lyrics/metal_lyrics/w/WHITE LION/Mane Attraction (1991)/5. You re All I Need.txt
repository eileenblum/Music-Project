I know that she's waiting
For me to say forever
I know that I sometimes
Just don't know how to tell her
I want to hold and kiss her
Give her my love
Make her believe
'Cause she doesn't know
She doesn't know
You're all I need beside me girl
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart
I know that she's always
There when I need her loving
I know that I've never
Told her how much I love her
I see her face before me
I look in her eyes
Wondering why
She doesn't know
She doesn't know
You're all I need beside me girl
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart
Say, say that you'll be there
Whenever I reach out
To feel your hand in mine
Stay, stay within my heart
Whenever I'm alone
I'll know that you are there
You're all I need beside me girl
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart
You're all I need, etc.
All that I need
Is for you to believe
All that I need
Is you
