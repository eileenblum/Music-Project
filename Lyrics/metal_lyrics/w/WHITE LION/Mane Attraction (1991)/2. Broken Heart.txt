Here I stand
All alone
Trying to fight the pain
From a broken heart
Why she left me
I don't know
It really doesn't matter anymore
I thought that love could last forever
But here I stand lost and all alone
There is life
Even after a broken heart
Broken heart
You can fight
The pain from a broken heart
Broken heart
Start a new day
But not alone
I'm gonna break away
From this broken heart
I'll meet a woman
I'm gonna take her home
I'll pick up the pieces
And start all over again
I know that life will be much better
I know the sun will shine again
There is life
Even after a broken heart
Broken heart
You can fight
The pain from a broken heart
Broken heart
I know that life will be much better
I know the sun will shine again
There is life
