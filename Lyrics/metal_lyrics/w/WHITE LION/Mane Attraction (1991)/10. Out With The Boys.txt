I've been looking Johnny I've been looking for you
I know that you're out there doing what you shouldn't do
I've been calling Johnny I've been calling for you
The streets didn't answer me 'cause they know that you're through
I still recall the nigh when you almost took your life
And we all were staying up all night
To be right by your side
Yeah we were out with the boys
We were out to make some noise
Yeah we were out with the boys
We were out to make some noise
I was searching Johnny, I was searching through town
I heard that someone saw you lying around
I was running, Johnny I was running out of time
When I suddenly found you beat up and fallen apart
I thought about the days when we were young 'n' wild
When every girl out on the streets
Turned when we walked by
Yeah we were out with the boys
We were out to make some noise
Yeah we were out with the boys
We were out to make some noise
If I could make a wish I'd take you back in time
And we could be the way we were
When we were out with the boys
We were out to make some noise
When we were out with the boys
We were out to make some noise
