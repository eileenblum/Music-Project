I went to a party
With a friend of mine
Had a couple of beers
And a bottle of wine
There were plenty of women
Dancing everywhere
They were dressed to kill
And knew what to do
She was so outstanding
I just had to make her mine
She could read me like a letter
I had one thing on my mind
She's got everything and I want it
Every little thing she's got is fine
She's got everything and I want it
Every little thing she's got is mine
So we left the party
And went to her place
You could see excitement
Written on my face
So she took me upstairs
Laid me on her bed
When she god undressed
I just lost my head
There were twenty years of woman
There was more than I could eat
She was ready, ripe 'n' willing
I just knew she's taste so sweet
She's got everything, etc.
She was like a fire
She burned like a flame
She cried out my name
In her claim to fame
Then I saw her smiling
From her pretty eyes
She said little boy
We've got work to do
Put the log into the fire
And bullets in the gun
You'll get what you desire
'Cause the night has just begun
She's got everything etc.
