I don't care if you don't like the way I look
Can't you see this ain't no Sunday School
I don't really care about your in 'n' outs
Can't you see I ain't nobody's fool
What is this, what is that
I don't care how you wear your hat
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don't you free me
And leave me alone
I don't care if you don't want me in your house
I just come 'n' go as I please
You can sing your song about when you were young
I can start a war when you want peace
Close the door, just ignore
But you won't tie me down no more
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don't you free me
And leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don't you free me
And leave me alone
I don't care if you don't like the way I walk
You don't stop and listen when I talk
I can see that you don't want to understand
Playing in a rock 'n' roll band
You object, you expect
But you don't give me no respect
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don't you free me
And leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Why don't you free me
And leave me alone
