Well it's time to say goodbye my friend
I'm glad you stayed until the end
I hope that you've enjoyed the time we spent
Though I know that I will be back again
I don't know just how soon my friend
Until we meet again just think of me
I'll think of you
It was easier to say hello
Than to say goodbye
Now the bus is leaving once again
I bid farewell to you
Oh oh yeah
I remember all the fun we had
And all the tears when times were bad
But you were there when we were down 'n' out
And I know that I will not forget
What was written and what was said
And who was there when we were not on top
Of the world
It was easier, etc.
Yes it's time to say auf Wiedersehn
Sayonata 'n' ciao my friend
You'll always have a place within my heart
And rock will come and rock will go
The scene will change and time will show
But still I hope that I'll be there for you
Be there for me
It was easier, etc.
