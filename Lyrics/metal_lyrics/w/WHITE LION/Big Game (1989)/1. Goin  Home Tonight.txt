I've been in this hell forever
I don't even know how long
And there were times I thought I never
Would hold you in my arms again
But now that everything is over
And I'm finally out of here

I'll be goin' home tonight
And everything will be alright
Cause when I open up the door
You'll be waiting
And you will keep me warm at night
And you will make me live again
Yes I'm going home tonight and
You'll be waiting

I know I always will remember
Every word we said that night
And when the morning came I had to go
But I didn't wanna say goodbye
As I leave this place behind me
There's a smile on my face

Yes I'm goin' home tonight
And everything will be alright
Cause when I open up the door
You'll be waiting
And you will keep me warm at night
And you will make me live again
Yes I'm going home tonight and
You'll be waiting

[Solo]

Cause I'm goin' home tonight
And everything will be alright
Cause when I open up the door
You'll be waiting
And you will keep me warm at night
And you will make me live again
Yes I'm going home tonight and
You'll be waiting
