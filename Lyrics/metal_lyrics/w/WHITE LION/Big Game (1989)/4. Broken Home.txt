There's a sound from the kitchen
And it's the sound he has heard a thousand times before
When he hears his mother crying, he runs away and hides inside his room

But there is no escaping the echo in his fathers voice
And when the tears are falling
He falls into his knees and prays

Just hold me, and love me
Trash this child of love
And try your best and save this broken home

His little arms are black and blue
And there's a little cut, right under his eye
Every night he lays awake
And from now to it
Fighting stars again
Have you forgot the reason, why this little child was born
'Cause if you go on fighting, you destroy this family, yeah

Just hold him, and love him
Trash this child of love
And try your best to save this broken home
Stop fighting, stop hurting, try to love again
And do your best to save this broken home

If you ever hold him tight, let him feel your love again
You will make him smile, yeah

Hold him, and love him
Trash this child of love
And try your best to save this broken home
Stop fighting, stop hurting, try to love again
And do your best to save this broken home
