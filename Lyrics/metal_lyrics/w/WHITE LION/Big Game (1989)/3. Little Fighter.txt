Are you crying tonight?
Are you feeling all right?
I told the world that you were down on your luck

You were one of a kind
One who'd never give it up
Even when they put a price on your head

Has anyone heard the tales you tell?
Or seen the scars you wear?
Did anyone speak up when you fell?
Does anybody care?

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
Shout again little fighter
And don't let it impair the things you do

And you were one with the courts
And a reason to be
You were a fighter for peace on this earth

And you were never afraid
You put your life on the line
And you were always so long out on the sea

Without a weapon in your hand
You came to fight a war
They took your life but didn't know
That you will never die

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
Shout again little fighter
And don't let it impair the things you do

Are you feeling all right?
Cause I care, care

[Solo]

Run along little fighter
Oh cause I was there beside you
Never stop believing, so rise
Rise
RISE!

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
Shout again little fighter
And don't let it impair the things you do

Rise again little fighter (Don't stop believing)
And let the world know the reason why
Shout again little fighter (And keep on moving)
And don't let it impair the things you do

Yea, don't let it ever end the things you do
