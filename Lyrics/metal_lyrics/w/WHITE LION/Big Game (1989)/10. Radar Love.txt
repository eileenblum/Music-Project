I've been driving all night, my hands 're wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
And my baby calls says she needs me here
And it's half past four and I'm shifting gear

When she gets lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
We don't need to talk at all

We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a wave in the air radar love

Radio's playing some forgotten song
Brenda lee's coming on strong
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm spinning into a new sunrise

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need a letter at all

We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a line in the air radar love

[Solo]

No more speed I 'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care
Last car to pass here I go
And the line of cars goes down real slow

And the radio played some forgotten song
Brenda lee's coming strong
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh, one more radar lover gone

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need a letter at all

We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a line in the sky
We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a thing that's called radar love
