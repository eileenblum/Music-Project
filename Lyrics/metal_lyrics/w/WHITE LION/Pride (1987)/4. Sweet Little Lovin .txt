Little miss dee's got a dirty mind
All around the boy's she's one of a kind
If you wanna good time you can take her home
Cause everyone knows she is good in bed
In a minute or two she'll make your dreams come true
She takes you to the top, you never wanna stop

Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving

Late night work in the sleezy bars
Driving down the boulevard in the fancy cars
She don't care what her daddy says
Cause all that matters is how much it pays
For two hundred down you get a hell of a time
She takes you to the top you never want to stop

Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving

I wonder why she never cries
I wonder why she never cries

Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving
Sweet little loving
