Are you feeling down
Are you all alone
Have your dreams been shattered
Have you lost all hope
All you need is music
It's your destiny, it sets you free

Whoh, oh, oh, oh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoh, oh, oh, oh
Whoh, oh, oh, oh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoh, oh, oh, oh

You can raise your hands
You can stomp your feet
Get down and turn around
You can do it all cause there ain't no rules
When you feel the music
Just move your feet, to that heavy beat

Whoh, oh, oh, oh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoh, oh, oh, oh
Whoh, oh, oh, oh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoh, oh, oh, oh

Whoh, oh, oh, oh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoh, oh, oh, oh
Whoh, oh, oh, oh
All you need is rock'n'roll
Whoh, oh, oh, oh
