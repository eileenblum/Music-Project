Are you tired of working 9 to 5
And are you fed up with your boring life
When your master tells you what to do
Years you wasted looking back at you
When life is driving you crazy
You feel your losing your mind

Don't give up, don't give up
When the road gets rough
Don't give up, don't give up
Even when it's tough

Making money you never have enough
Never-ending bills are building up
And the tax man stalking at your door
Never giving always wanting more
You feel like changing the times
To get some peace in your mind

Don't give up, don't give up
When the road gets rough
Don't give up, don't give up
Even when it's tough

Don't give up, don't give up
When the road gets rough
Don't give up, don't give up
Even when it's tough

Don't give up,don't give up
Don't you ever give up
Don't give up, you can make it
Don't give up, you can do it tonight
Don't give up, you can tell 'em
Don't give up, you can show 'em alright
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't you ever give up
