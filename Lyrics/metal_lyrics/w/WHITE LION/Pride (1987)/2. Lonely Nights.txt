The little girl standing in the rain
On the corner of 42nd street
And she's all alone on the bad side of town
Cause there was a little boy
That she loved with all her heart
But he's far away with another girl
Now she's searching for a friend
Just to hold her when she cries

In her lonely nights, lonely nights
Where no one seems to care
In her lonely nights, lonely nights
You better beware

But baby you try and you try
But it seems that it doesn't work
Cause love is a game that they play
So baby hold on to your heart
When they tell you that they care
Yeah now that you know that the winner
Takes what he wants
But she's searching for a friend
Just hold her when she cries

In her lonely nights, lonely nights
Where no one seems to care
In her lonely nights, lonely nights
You better beware

And somewhere in the night
There's a little cry
A girl who says
Hey I wanna die
There's no one here who cares
But if there's someone here who understands
Just someone here who'll try to lend a hand
And bring her home tonight, tonight

In her lonely nights...
