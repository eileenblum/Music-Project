Lady of the valley
Can you hear me cry
In the stillness of the night
I have lost my brother
In the fights of the war
And my heart has broken down

In the night I cry but no one seems to hear
I step into the light but all I feel is fear

Lady of the valley
Can you bring him back
To the days when we were kids
Once we were together
We stood young and strong
now it seems so long ago

The golden key is at the end of the chain
How it hurts oh lady free me from this pain

In the night I cry to the lady of the valley
Cause I'll die without the lady of the valley
In the night I call to the lady of the valley
On my knees I fall before the lady of the valley

In the valley lies the treasure
And the lady guards it well
He who bears all the pressure
Is the one to break the spell
There's a sign that I've followed
And it has led me to your seat
I have brought my fallen brother
And I've laid him, yes I've laid him
At your feet

In the night I cry to the lady of the valley
Cause I'll die without the lady of the valley
In the night I cry to the lady of the valley
Cause I'll die without the lady of the valley
In the night I call to the lady of the valley
On my knees I fall before the lady of the valley
