Wait just a moment before our love will die
Cause I must know the reason why we say goodbye
Wait just a moment and tell me why
'cause I can show you loving that you won't deny

Wait and show your loving like it was before
Cause I won't let that feeling walk out through the door
Yeah wait just a moment and try once more
Cause babe I need to hold you like I did before

So if you go away I know that I will follow
Cause there's a place inside my heart that tells me
Hold out, hold out, hold out

Wait - wait
I never had a chance to love you
Wait - wait
If only our love could show you
Wait - wait
I never wanna be without you
Wait - wait
No I never had a chance to love you
Now I only wanna say I love you
One more time

[solo]

Wait - wait
I never had a chance to love you
Wait - wait
If only our love could show you
Wait - wait
I never wanna be without you
Wait - wait
No I never had a chance to love you
Now I only wanna say I love you
Wait...
