We keep our past inside our reasons. We never gave up on us (on us)
Now we are the grateful bleeding that live today.

I put my trust in poison, to teach me how to live.
I put my trust in darkness, to teach me how to see.

I put my trust in poison, to teach me how to live.
I put my trust in darkness, to teach me how to see.

I put my trust in poison, to teach me how to live.
I put my trust in darkness, to teach me how to see.
