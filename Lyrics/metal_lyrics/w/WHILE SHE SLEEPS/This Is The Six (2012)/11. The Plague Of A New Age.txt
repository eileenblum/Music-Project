What's become of the wars they won? A price idled population
Speak up for the life left inside our nation. The river runs red
It's black at the bottom and there we know nothing
Where the souls of the forgotten are resting in need,
But the human race and the fate on which they prey are dying today,
In the plague of a new age.
Pile the bodies up, burn them when they're young
We'll still be singing, the sorrow lives on
Take your part of the blame.
Find your fix, take what you can, steal from the palm of a dying hand.
We bleed on the flag, we murdered the land, broken our way, it's time to take your part of the blame.
Cancer feeds, Hatred breeds, the children cry themselves to sleep.
I'll hold my own, unbroken and better off,
Our plight to save, reside the stray, there's nothing left but tyranny
I'll find the truth in the end, I'm not dying again, I'm hurt but surviving decent,
It's black at the bottom and there we know nothing,
Where the sould of the forgotten are resting in need,
But the human race and the fate on which they pray are dying today.
In the plague of a new age,
We've got nothing to lose, we've got nothing to gain,
We've got nothing to lose, we've got nothing again
