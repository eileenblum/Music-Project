I've lost too many times to see. This crooked cross will never save me
I'm glad I'm on my own, I'm glad I'm on my own

I've lost too many times to see (I've lost too many times to see)
This crooked cross will never save me (This crooked cross will never save me)
I look to open skies and see, (I look to open skies and see)
the net of safety tied down on me (the net of safety tied down on me)
I'm glad I'm on my own, I'm glad I'm on my own

The force-feeding, false freedom.

Our guided are given, fed to the sun for all you're worth without reason
The force-feeding, false freedom. Let's find the meaning of peace
Let's find a reason to live
