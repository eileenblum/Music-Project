They gave their selves to the streets, they saved.
They took the challenge to keep the faith.
We can't imagine the way. We can't imagine the day
They put their hate in the waves,They put their heart in the way,
They gave their selves to the streets, they saved, they fought to keep our faith,
Cut their life away from safe, to save, Leave the blind alone in the reighn.
But i know I couldn't be taught to die with pride,for queen or country,
I know I couldn't be taught to die, not another slave to the hive,
I've seen the names, I'm not young and afraid, the numbers the same,
We could decide when we die but we decide what we defend
We sing the sorrow of the dead from our souls.And hope that they found peace, dying alone.
Cut their life away from safe, to save,
The mindless freedom puts our nation to shame. Are you greatful of the graves?
I speak the words of a weathered man, there's blood on the streets my son walks down
If we suffered for this, it has to change,
They gave their lives to the streets, they saved. They took the challenge to keep our faith
