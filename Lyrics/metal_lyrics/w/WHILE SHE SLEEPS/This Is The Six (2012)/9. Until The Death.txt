I put my trust in poison, to teach me how to live.
I put my trist in darkness, to teach me how to see.
I chose my pain alone with honesty
My home, my hate, have grown inside of me.
We keep our past inside our reasons. We never gave up on us
We are the greatful bleeding that live today.
Dictations reigns in, our hope will never change a thing.
I chose six until death, not a slave into the world,
I chose sickness over health and it saved me every time,
I chose this until death, not a slave into the world,
I chose sickness over health and it saved me every time.
Not alive with a reason, not hit by the need to refuse.
I got called into freedom with the lost hordes and the blackest of youth.
I put my trust in poison to teach me how to live,
You're following to find your way into a worthless victory.
Six until the death. Not a slave into the world
I chose sickness over health and it's saved me every time,
When I can't breath I know it's got the best of me.
When I can't breath, the six will set me free
I put my trust in poison, teach me how to live,
Our hate inside out peace.
I put my trust in darkness, teach me how to see,
The hate that swallows the streets.
