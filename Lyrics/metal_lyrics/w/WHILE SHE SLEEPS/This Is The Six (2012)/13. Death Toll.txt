When the siren cries again, pull the living from the dead.Â 
Save hearts for fools and livers for the graves.*Â 

Death toll, keeps rising the terminal breed.Â 
Alone, we're rising like the pulse of the street.Â 
Spit my f*cking words away, I took back my life today.Â 
We're not bitter just bitten with rage.Â 
We're not sick we're just ridding the plague.Â 

Eye for eye, survive.Â 
Suffer with the pain, keep revenge in disguise.Â 
Your minds, decide.Â 
How you pull the pain or cut your cores in life.Â 
We're not bitter just bitten with rage.Â 
We're not sick, we're just ridding the plague.Â 
Bad blood, stand up.Â 
You can't drain the life from us.Â 
You can't drain the life from us.Â 

Every window down this f*cking street looks dead to me.Â 
Start the healing of society.Â 
Before the sky is filled with ashes of hate.Â 
Pollution of pride.Â 
Line up.Â 
Line up to save yourselves.Â 
Line up to save yourselves.Â 

We'll perish or save our fight, the darkness will hide us.Â 
The crooked, the fake, won't reign.Â 
The death toll is rising.Â 

Eye for eye, survive.Â 
Suffer with the pain, keep revenge in disguise.Â 
Your minds, decide.Â 
How you pull the pain or cut your cores in life.Â 
We're not bitter just bitten with rage.Â 
We're not sick, we're just ridding the plague.Â 
Bad blood, stand up.Â 
You can't drain the life from us.Â 
You can't drain the life from us.
