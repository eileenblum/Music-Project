When all the bodies will burn. 
Iâm grieving for the minds of the missed, but if you won't miss forever, then all the bodies will burn into the hands of a broken heart. 
We are the black youth, try and tear us apart. 

I donât belong in this, this is the furthest I can get to try and deal with it. 
And after all the pain they inflict, we have no blood but we have a purpose. 

Can you feel it take, take, take?
All you fucking do is take, take, take.

And the fools at the front slide their guns through the gates. 
You call this a messiah but were not broken, you've got problems but you won't solve them. 
Broken, like the back of the bastard youth. 

So fuck the law we wrote the order.

We might be the gutter of society but to ourselves we have a promise to keep. 
Call us worthless, call us cheap but we know we can and we will if we're told no again,
we should but we won't because we're in it for them. 

Fuck the law we wrote the order. 
Fuck the bridge because we built the borders. 
I'd rather take my life than believe. 
I'd rather rot with the answers.

Fuck the law we wrote the order. 
Fuck the bridge because we built the borders. 
I'd rather take my life than believe. 
I'd rather rot with the answers. 

And you take, and you take, and you take.
And you take, you always keep taking, always keep taking from me.

Can you feel it take, take,take?
All you fucking do is take, take, take.

And the fools at the front slide their guns through the gates. 
You call this a messiah, well I call it a murder.

Can you feel it?
This is a personal promise, the burden upon us.
Can you feel it?
This is a personal promise, the burden upon us.

Fuck the law we wrote the order. 
Fuck the bridge because we built the borders.
