From hospitals to honesty and everything you need of me, I'll be there (I'll be there)
From hospitals to honesty and everything you need of me, I'll be there (I'll be there)
(From hospitals to honesty and everything that you need of me, I'll be there)
My inspiration, My guidance, My home
My inspiration, My guidance, My home

I will look up to the stars, so you will forever see, the best part of you still lives in me,

The time took for granted, the before and the after,
For question and your answers, our courage, our cancer
The time took for granted, the before and the after,
For question and your answers, our courage, our cancer
