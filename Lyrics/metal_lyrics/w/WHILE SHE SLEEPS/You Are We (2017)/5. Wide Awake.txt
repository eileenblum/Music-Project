Make sure you work to save, to pay the wage
To get the raise, so fuck today away
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake

Make sure you work to save, to pay the wage
To get the raise, so fuck today away
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake

Make sure you suffer, recover and learn to forgive
Mother, Mother Earth our only exorcist
You want fame, well they're watching you anyway
You haunt, you hide, you victimize
Creep like you're unseen and paralyze

Are you waiting for the glass to break and fall at your feet?
To say you knew that it was coming now you know it's too late
You turned the page, it's a world away
Another dose of ignorance will kill the pain

Keep our attention for long enough to cover up
The truth that we're all corrupt, we fall like dominoes
What they told us to trust will keep us all alone
Please don't think outside the box and

Make sure you work to save, to pay the wage
To get the raise, so fuck today away
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake

You haunt, you hide, you victimize
You want fame, well they're watching you anyway

We're just killing time
We're just killing time

The sorrow is our expression a seldom promise we keep
The struggle learnt in the lesson to only live by our means
Is that all we'll ever be? Not me, not me, not me

Keep our attention for long enough to cover up
The truth that we're all corrupt, we fall like dominoes
What they told us to trust will keep us all alone
Please don't think outside the box and

Make sure you work to save, to pay the wage
To get the raise, so fuck today away
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake

Two days to dream, after five routines
Seven days to think of what we could've been

Is it too late to try, escape or redefine?
The safe, the sound of life before it goes
Watching others live to kill the time
Why don't we live like we're alive?

I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake

We swore to Death that we'd never die
Haunt the ghosts of a paradise I am yet to find

Make sure you work to save, to pay the wage
To get the raise, so fuck today away
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake

Make sure you work to save, to pay the wage
To get the raise, so fuck today away
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake, wide awake
