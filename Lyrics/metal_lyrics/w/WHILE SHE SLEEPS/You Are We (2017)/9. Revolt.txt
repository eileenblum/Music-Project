Calling all heathens to the fire
Our only hope is built from the ashes below
Our leaders won't save us
Your queen is dead

Just my luck, it's never been enough
There's only black clouds when I look up
It'll take thirteen nails to hang me from this cross

Trade labour cocaine, blood in the sink
Wash it down and forget what you've seen
Punch drunk in a world of knives
Unscathed to the naked eye

I'd chase the sun over the horizon
If you believed the light would guide us
Towards the fight but away from the sirens
All I need is the air inside my lungs
So hold your head up high

Revolt, this is revolting, revolt, this is revolting
I'll let the state of the world speak for itself

Malignant rituals of apathy
You have the guts to point the finger at me
I don't care what they say
I am your eulogy in this state of reckoning

I'd chase the sun over the horizon
If you believed the light would guide us
Towards the fight but away from the sirens
All I need is the air inside my lungs

You want the bad news
We're still waiting for the greater good
I'll let the state of the world speak for itself

Don't try to convince me
That you're speaking for the rank and the file
While we stand and you hide
We'll be heard for miles
Speaking with the voice of a giant
No borders or sides
No evidence of a trial
There's no escape from their lies
It's just a crooked alliance
Where the wrong lead the right
If we're strong we'll survive
And realize that we will never
Step forward if we're standing in line
We'll never step forward if we're standing in line
So hold your head up high

Revolt, this is revolting, revolt, this is revolting
I'll let the state of the world speak for itself
