[feat. Oliver Sykes of Bring Me The Horizon]Where is your heart
Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders break the walls
Together as one
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit are we free

Are we all alone
If you're gonna accuse me of pouring too much salt in the wound
We have just proved that they can pollute our heads with the news
They will manipulate the masses again 
If you're gonna accuse me of telling you what you already knew
Its the same song sung with a different truth and all of us forget it 'cause our heads inside the noose
They will manipulate the masses again yeah yeah we won't forget it

You better pray for absolution 
You can change but you can't deny
A new wave in a terror nation
Why do we ignore the warning signs
Board it up the borders are shut
The blood of the innocent is under the rug
White lies in a world corrupt
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes
War will cease when we refuse to fight

Where is your heart
Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders break the walls
Together as one
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit are we free

Are we all alone
Are we all alone

Hope widows shattered windows
Restriction without effect
Dead lines in silhouettes
Why do we ignore the warning signs
Cold calls to derelict homes
Needles at the side of the road
Wires and liars like thorns that won't let go
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Tell me where is your heart

I think the silence speaks volumes
Now we march to our drums
They're only singing what they want to be sung
Hates become the new anthem
How could you when did our veins run numb
We treat our species like a fucking flood
Hates become the new anthem

The longer I live I learn that we don't belong
We've taken more than we can give and you'd do better on your own
The longer I live I learn that we don't belong
We've taken more than we can give and you'd do better better on your own

Are we all alone

Tear the borders break the walls
Take us back to when we're all 
Together as one
Taught to love born to live and let go
Tear the borders
Take us back to when we're all
Together as one
Taught to love born to live and let go
