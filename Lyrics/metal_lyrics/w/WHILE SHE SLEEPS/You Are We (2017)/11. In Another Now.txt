In another now
The words we speak
Will fade away
And mean nothing to me

We are an avalanche of doubt
Suffocating in the wake
Passed the point of no return
The rivers like the devil's veins will guide the way
Our chrysalis in chains
We've outstayed our welcome under a thirstful sun

Like an island lost at sea
Naive to science the water eats away
And all we do is preach a way
To cure what we can't keep

In another now
The words we speak
Will fade away
And mean nothing to me

It means something to me

I climb to the top of the mountain
And found another towering over me

At the edge without intention or sense
To find a destiny kept behind the fence
That she tempts us to ascend
Lock gate, hide the keys
Take the pain that we feel and call it hope
Why do we destroy everything we try to love?

Take the pain that we feel and call it hope
We destroy everything we try to love
Again and again our vice tradition
When will we learn our rapture is our prison?

Like an island lost at sea
Naive to science the water eats away
And all we do is preach a way
To cure what we can't keep

And mean nothing to me

It means something to me

It's mine but it's probably stolen
Paid the price but it's probably free
For a life unprescribed, an escape from the lines
I can survive if I know you are we
