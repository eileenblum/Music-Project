Here lies our addiction the price is a truce
To hide the afflicted right under our nose
Tyrants deprivers of truth
Take what you can we've got nothing to lose

So come and get it
We've got nothing to lose
Yeah I fucking said it
Deprivers of truth

To be honest they force this upon us
Show us the path paved with glass
Sentiment at last
The knife behind your back

Our smoke will paint the sky
Cover up the lights that guide us
Celebrate decline
We made our bed and I will lie to you
That everything's alright

We'll damn the river
We'll damn the river and try to
Hide from the water
Pre creation it's a reign of sin
If the land has been swallowed
We'll learn how to swim
Begging for our sorrow
The tides are turning

You want your countless wars
We want to count less wars
You want to point the blame
At the heretics but you're the hypocrites
It's only hate you preach and when we call for peace
You call it anarchy
I hope your god can save you as your devil leads your way
Yeah

We've got nothing to lose
So come and get it
We've got nothing to lose
Yeah I fucking said it
Deprivers of the truth

It's like raking dead leaves in the wind
It's like saints living life without sins
It's like digging our graves in the sand
It's like raking dead leaves in the wind

Our smoke will paint the sky
Cover up the lights that guide us
Celebrate decline
We made our bed and I will lie to you
That everything's alright

You are we
You are we
Lucifer
You are we
