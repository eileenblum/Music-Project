Said the skeptic
Born and bred negative
No peace for the calm collective
There's a cold war coming in
1 2 3 Go

Please let me know when its gone
Its not really the best of times
And all we've got is guided by this light within
I'll hold us both until the smoke clears
We're suffocating

Sick of our society
Sick of trying to fit inside a life I cannot lead
Sick of always following
Sick of trying to be another cog in their machine
Sick of running on empty pushing the blame
Waiting for tomorrow to save us from today
There's no profit in poverty and I'm running on empty
I'm running on empty running myself into the ground

Said the skeptic
Born and bred negative
No peace for the calm collective
There's a cold war coming in
Go

I feel the need
Its a darkness disease
In this dead town lights out
The creatures come out in the streets
My eyes are burning in this circle of eyes
Close the curtain and hide the knife
We're stacking up we're piling high
We've gone too far to recognize salvation
This is civil isolation

The bitter truth of the world is fucking sickening
Yeah

Tear my eyes on your barbed wire facade
Divides of color and small talk
Medicate for patience
Dig up the graves for our saviors
Civil isolation

Its all gone right to my head
Wondering why we're not all dead
Its safe to say I'm not alone in this
There's something deep within we miss

There's a line in the sand that we won't look past
A cure for the pain but its out of our grasp
If all we love will leave us asking why do we deserve disaster
Let me know

Please let me know when its gone
Its not really the best of times
And all we've got is guided by this light within
I'll hold us both until the smoke clears
We're suffocating

Sick of our society
Sick of trying to fit inside a life I cannot lead
Sick of always following
Sick of trying to be another cog in their machine
Sick of running on empty pushing the blame
Waiting for tomorrow to save us from today
There's no profit in poverty and I'm running on empty
I'm running on empty
I'm running on empty
Running on empty running myself into the ground
