We've always been kept in the dark
A vision of our sanctuary
Overshadowed by deceit from the start

The lie within belief
All our thoughts and uncertainties
Are mirrored by a grieving plea
The breathless wind the verse of debauchery
Scorched by the tyrants of industry
She cries "what do you want from me"

So I will beg the feeble question our divided species asks
If we're gunning for this but we know its diminishing fast
Can we at least enjoy it while it lasts

The tidal waves of fear are bearing down on me
Our confusion connects us 
Our deception unites us

Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know
Our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I know
Never say nihilist of modern day
Never say nihilist of modern day

Let's feel
Let's feel this together
We are a species of course we fight
Fighting started life its time to rectify
Stop living in your fantasy lives
Don't let your body be a graveyard for your mind

Go

Turn it up
Turn it up
This is a broadcast brought to you by the rank and file
Not the back of the room
Exploit our minds and keep us idolizing ignorance

There's a spark in the fuse
There's a fire inside that'll guide us through
The remains of a nation divided
Divided

Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know
Our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I know
Never safe in a black market democracy
Never safe to no avail we turn the other way
To no avail we turn the other way

Let's feel
Let's feel this together
Let's feel this together

All of my struggles 
Like steel trying to become wood
But seeing it in others is a forest fire
All of my struggles
We're still trying to become one
When will we learn that all we have is enough

Said the nomad to the sea
What is home without these streets I know
We're blinded by our needs our destiny is at our feet
We can march without this beat I know
