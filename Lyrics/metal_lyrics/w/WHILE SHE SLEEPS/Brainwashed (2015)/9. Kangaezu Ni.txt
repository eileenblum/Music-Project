[Instrumental][Without Thought]

The times we live in can very easily be drowned in stress, confusion and disharmony. The way we perceive our thoughts plays a very significant role in the rise and fall of our emotions and can be the difference between suffering or blissfulness. Maybe, everyone now and then can be âKangaezu Niâ and sink into the here and now.
