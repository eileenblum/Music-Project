We'll choose our lives with blind intent
Haunt ourselves with fear of change
Struggle, save, watch time repeat
Let them treat our innocence
Take our freedom, take our rights
Teach us how to conquer life
By the book, by guiding light
Within the lines of modern minds
Too many misery victims born and raised
Drip feed the casualties
Turn it off, turn it off; fuck the company
No faith, no faith, no faith in me
Thereâs no time to waste
Landmines in the graves
Holding on to youth
Refuse

And all you wanna know is where we go in the end
Transfixed, dope sick, time to waste
And how do we get out of this hell that we live
My hatredâs pulling me in
Weâll choose our lives with blind intent
Haunt ourselves with fear of change
Struggle, save, watch time repeat
Let them treat our innocence
Take our freedom, take our rights
Teach us how to conquer life
By the book, by guiding light
Within the lines of modern minds
Donât give up, give up, give up on yourself
Brainwashed like everyone else
Donât bottle your dreams, hide them away
Cold future, no escape

Donât speak knives
Donât speak knives
Donât speak knives on what our future could be
