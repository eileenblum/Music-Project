Three years gone,
Iâm still searching for the future of the broken young
This isnât living, surviving with hope
Hold on, protect everything that you love and know
We are all victims of our own evolution
We suffer together, but we all die alone
We shame our nation while itâs on its knees
Stretched to breaking point with new disease
Won't you sing this with me?

Weâve strayed too far to be saved.
Iâve been told
The fastest growing sickness lives inside of me
Cut or suffer,
Beg or differ.
Canât you see?
Itâs in the minds of the weak
Who think theyâre better than the shit weâre living in

Black our eyes
Take our tongues
Weâre paying for the way shit should have been done
Fuck it
Weâre paying for the way shit should have been done
And still we beg
But still we beg
With our head in our hands to a myth with a message,
But no escape plan.
Suffering show us what we should have done
Weâre overdosed, weâre overrun
Our pride, our triumph
Trophies of violence

Always deceived by a false allegiance
To feed the ones that give in
Tear down our idols
Trophies of the violence

Weâre back to set the record straight
Weâre rage romantic and full of hatred
Some inspiration right now would suffice
This whole world is dreaming of a better fucking life

Thirsty parasites
We're dead behind the eyes
Of mindless genocide
We cannot stomach in our vile pride
It tastes like shit
But most of us donât care
And the rest will never hear this,
The flat line criticals
We clot the bleed and cauterise
Just to get by
Predisposed and true to form
We rape the world of all it holds
We got the earth of all it has call it hell when canât give back

We are a living abortion, a vile creation
But letâs make the best of a bad situation
Letâs make the best of a bad situation

Black our eyes, take our tongues
Weâre paying for the way shit shouldâve been done
Fuck it
Weâre paying for the way shit shouldâve been done

(You think you're nothing like these creatures)

Suffering show us what we should have done
Weâre overdosed, weâre overrun
Our pride, our triumph
Trophies of violence
Always deceived by a false allegiance
To feed the ones that give in
Tear down our idols
Trophies of the violence
But itâs not the end of the world
Yet.
