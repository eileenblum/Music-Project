This oneâs for the gutter rats and the underdogs
For the have and the have not's
For the sinking ships and the hopeless
Guilty are the filthy rich
For the broken homes for the debt
For the sick and the deadbeat
For the sleepwalking who think their living the dream

YOUâVE GOT NOTHING

We are the souls whoâve been forgotten

This is a dead society
Built on sorrow, weâll beg steal or follow
Control, consume
What the fuck are we to do
Weâre being led to the slaughter

Pride, conviction, of a life, much to weak
Weâve been failed, by the system
Built to kill, they never listen

For freedom of speech, thereâs not much to be said
Cut off your tongue and stand instead
You might get answers from them

(Believe in nothing, but yourself)

Souls whoâve been forgotten
Sing this with me
How can we live in fear of a mystery that weâll never see?
Souls whoâve been forgotten, sing this with me

I put the bullet back in
Broadcast the reason
We wonât suffocate
This is your evolution
Donât wait to be saved

Destroy, what destroys you
Weâre been captured
Weâve been branded
Our lives were the mad mans slaughter
No future vision disorder
Donât look up, look forward

DESTROY WHAT DESTROYS YOU

(Believe in nothing, but yourself)

Souls whoâve been forgotten
Sing this with me
How can we live in fear of a mystery that weâll never see?
Souls whoâve been forgotten, sing this with me

I put the bullet back in
Broadcast the reason
We wonât suffocate
This is your evolution
Donât wait to be saved
