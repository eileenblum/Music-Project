We confide, they confuse, they resist, they refuse
We're the product of the feud
Where's the unity?
Defy the rules, we can decide for our self
Deprived of truth
Where's the unity?
With nothing left to lose we're singing:
No sides, no enemies
We're searching for a place where
We'll never be deceived

We'll win by understanding
Not reacting; it's my ship that's sinking
On our world not theirs

We'll lead the blind
Choose to read between the lines
Are you haunted by the future?
Are you afraid of the answers you need?
Are we loyal or have we fled?
The notes are dirty we will wage the debt

Sick of thinking what we could've been
Saving up to fund the bitter end
Tied to blame
Sick of thinking what we could've been
Tied to blame
Saving up to fund the future, the bitter end

Tied to blame for the pain inside
Sworn to change like the guilty on the line
No sides, no enemies
We'll never be deceived

Tied to blame for the pain inside
Sworn to change like the guilty on the line
No sides, no enemies
We'll never be deceived

Tied to blame for the pain inside
Sworn to change like the guilty who lie to survive
No sides, no enemies
I'm surrounded by the people I need

Don't take your time for granted
Don't chase your life away
It's not coming back
Take what is yours; demand it
We're gripping tight at the reigns

Are you drowning in the shallows?
Are you to blame for you actions?
Carry the banner, I hope you know:
There's a world outside that could be yours

There's a world outside that could be yours
Where's the unity?
There's a world outside that could be yours
Where's the unity?
This is our protest song, you're not alone
Where's the unity?
There's a life proscribed but I want more
Raise your fist if you're for it
Raise your fist if you're for it
Raise your fist if you're for it
