If you want words to live your life by,
Walk the graves, walk the graves.
Itâs written on the head stones.
If you want words to live your life by,
Walk the graves, walk the graves.
Itâs written on the head stones,
Time waits for no one.
We are living proof of a world gone mad,
But this is all we have. We spin in cycles, we drift in the dark.
Our world falling apart.

Chance made us brothers,
Loyal to the last breath I take.
Our legacy wonât be wasted on me.

Side by side through thick and thin.
In the darkest times together weâll be,
Searching for life in all we have left.
We won't be servants of time, not alive in regret.

Live every moment as if it was your last,
Honour the past, but never look back.
I should count my blessings for all I have,
And the fact I ever had the chance made us brothers,
Loyal to the last breath I take.
Our legacy wonât be wasted on me.

Weâll be singing from the fire with smoke in our eyes.
Coalition deprived, we are alive at night.

If you want words to live your life by,
Walk the graves, walk the graves.
Itâs written on the head stones.
If you want words to live your life by,
Walk the graves, walk the graves.
Itâs written on the head stones,
Time waits for no one.

Our legacy wonât be wasted on me.
Chance made us brothers,
Loyal to the last breath I take.
Our legacy wonât be wasted on me.
