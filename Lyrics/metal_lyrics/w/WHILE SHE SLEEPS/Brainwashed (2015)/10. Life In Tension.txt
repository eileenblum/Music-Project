Look me in the eyes, I am no oneâs fool
Victim of nothing, prey to no one, cut the noose
Thereâs an escape route, but Iâm not gonna take it
I wonât let it win
Our Saviourâs in our head, itâs in our hands but we burn the candle at both ends
Two fingers to the world
Fuck your life of suffering
Iâve got nothing to prove
They say âThe best way out is always throughâ

Walk the rope, walk the rope
from everything to nothing
Hope you know, hope you know
this music is our therapy
A song for those who never give up
And walk the rope, walk the rope
We will overcome

Cornered by a life in tension
Take my hand, we will overcome
Living out a life in tension, cure us of the pain
Realize weâre all afraid
Real life is not for me
Iâll die singing:
âDreamers, we live the nightmareâ
This crisis all inclusive,
survive on poor excuses
Youâll get out what you give in

Thereâs an escape route, but Iâm not gonna take it
I wonât let it win
Do you feel like the rain is following you?

Donât be the prey!
Donât be the praying hands.
Donât be the prejudice
of a life weâre yet to live.

Walk the rope, walk the rope
from everything to nothing
Hope you know, hope you know
this music is our therapy
A song for those who never give up

walk the rope, walk the rope
From everything to nothing
Hope you know, hope you know
This music is our therapy
A song for those who never give up
And walk the rope, walk the rope
We will overcome
