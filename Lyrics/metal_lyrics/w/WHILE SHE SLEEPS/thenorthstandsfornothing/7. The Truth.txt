I'm gonna tell you straight, the only reason I have this is you.
I didn't always tell you the truth, I didn't want to make your pain worse.
Did it work?
And it has been fifteen years, fifteen fucking years since I let my guard down.
And I know exactly were to point the blame.
Please listen when i say....
You always gave us more than we deserve.

I'm gonna tell you straight, to you I have to prove nothing.
And If I could have, I would have bought all your roses.
When I stumbled you broke the fall.
You always gave us more than we deserved.
Youth and dependency dies away, but I will never forget the sacrifices you have made and will make.
