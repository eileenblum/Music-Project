Stop resisting, hands by your side.
I'll take the swagger from your stride.
Cover your eyes, face to the skies.
Your conscience, my freedom, you're fucked if you try.

The lies, the lies and torment,
That grew inside these forces,
We didn't even try to fight, but you still brought this.

This is our call for safety, can you hear our cry for help.
A victim of every pain you felt can find a cause from somewhere else.
Our coins can pay for the crime but your faults are yours for a lifetime.
I am beat but far from bleeding.
But that's the best that you can do about it.
We have nothing to loose.

Take one step closer I'm not afraid,
The more the mayhem the more I get paid.
I call you failure, you call me fake.
I'm at the end of the path you will take.

Stop resisting, this is a challenge to me.
Never again, this will be the last time luck will ever be there at the end.
Never again, this is a part of me, the part my heart wants to forget.

And if we pull together we'll break these fucking chains.
This is the time we win, hands raised for an opening.
Though I have sinned, there's still chance for a new beginning.
There's still chance, still chance for a new beginning.

This is our call for safety, can you hear our cry for help.
A victim of every pain you felt can find a cause from somewhere else.
Our coins can pay for the crime but you faults are yours for a lifetime.
I am beat but far from bleeding.
But that's the best that you can do about it.

Is that the best you can do, because I'm still standing.
Is that the best you can do?
