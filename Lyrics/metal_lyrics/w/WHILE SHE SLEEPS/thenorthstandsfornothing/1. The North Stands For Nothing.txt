The salt deep in my wounds makes me feel I've got something to prove.
Safety takes time, I know you're far from acceptance.
You call this your home, I know it's not where you started.
Take a look at what you're becoming, these walls are getting closer to falling.
There's more than just pride in a promise, there's more than belief in becoming.
Remember you're in this for yourself.

The north stands for nothing, the true and the trusting.
The east's everlasting, the cracked and the rusting.
The south is the salt that will seal your sores.
The west is the weakness the strength to defeat us.

I know you're in this for yourself.
Raise your flag high and hope that we don't tear it down.

We'll stay never divided, always to protect our own.
We'll stay never divided, through the thick and the fucking thin.

The north stands for nothing, the true and the trusting.
The east's everlasting, the cracked and the rusting.
The south is the salt that will seal your sores.
The west is the weakness the strength to defeat us.
