I'll hold your presence, your gift and your grace.
Forever remembered, for never replaced.
You paved the paths, the roads i take.
You are the lessons learnt from my mistakes.
Your tools and your trophies will never rust,
Your ashes shine golden like jewels in the dust.

Remember when we rode with horses.

I can only persevere your past aside my promise,
your gift in guidance.
And i will hold my own, if you leave me strong enough.

I will hold my own if you ever leave me strong enough
I will bear the shield you left above my head.

I will never forget this.
I can only protect what you gave to me.

If we could have our time again,
Hearts aside our horses.
A father and a friend,
An honour.

You were the answers.
And I can always see safety in stone.

I know that you were the answer.
I hope that you can hear me.

And I will carry your legacy and finish this,
So sleep tight knowing you're missed.
I hope you know you're missed.
