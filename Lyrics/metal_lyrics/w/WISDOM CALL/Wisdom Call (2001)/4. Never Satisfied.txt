I'm asking why I'm doing this
I'm feeling empty all the time
I'm looking for love, I'm looking for Peace
I'm feeling empty all the time

Feeling so unclean in front of you
Help me to see the way
Feeling so unclean in front of you
Turn my darkness into light

Always wanting more, wanting more
That is what I need
I'm never satisfied, never satisfied
Please set me free, yeah set me free

I'm playing games with my liege
I want to be number one
My selfish thoughts fills my mind
I'm losing focus all the time

You are the reason why I live
You are the reason why I breathe
You'll never say goodbye to me
Only you can set me free
