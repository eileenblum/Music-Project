It's hard to live my life n' frustration is all I feel
The pain carves me with it's knife only you can make me see
It goes on and on, confuses my mind
I'm longing for tomorrow to leave the past behind

'Cause there's one way out for the human race
We need love for this crazy place

My castles are falling right in front of my eyes
I'm looking for the answer just to destroy all my lies
It goes on and on and on confuses my mind
I'm longing for tomorrow to leave the past behind
