Storm wind coming, please help me now
Take my hand, my lord I'm so weak
I know you'll never, leave me alone
I feel secure, in your presence

Love is your sign, you give me peace of mind
You're my captain, until the end of time, time.

I've got nothing, nothing to lose
Cause the price, it's already paid
On the cross, you took my sins
Yeah you washed them away

All tickets for free
Love is your sign, you give me peace of mind
You're my captain, until the end of time, time.
