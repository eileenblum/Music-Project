I look around and what do I see it's desert land all around me
I need your sacrifice I'm lost without you
Tell me how long will I be running?
'Cause I'm running

Through fire like a long distance runner
Through fire will I see the end?
Through fire like a long distance runner
Through fire will I reach the end?

I hear you calling, calling my name
But your sweet voice is so far, far away
I need you know I can't take this any longer
Tell me how long will I be running?
'Cause I'm running

Give me your bread, your wine
It will satisfy my soul
