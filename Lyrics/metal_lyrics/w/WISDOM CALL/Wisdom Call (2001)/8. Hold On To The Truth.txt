It's a misty morning
And I'm searching for you
Where am I going?
So many things I've been through
I'm lost in the shadows, lost in the dark once again

I'm looking for places
Where I'm feeling safe and calm
I hear a voice saying
I'm the one you're looking for
Come on rest in my arms

I've paid the price for your soul

So hold on to the truth
And do what is right
So hold on to the truth
See the light

I have followed you since you were a little boy
Every step you have made
Every move you have done
I'm the spirit who's guiding you right in your life

Listen to my words and listen to your heart
And you'll find the answer
I am the way, the truth and life
Trust in me and you'll find peace in your heart
