The world we live in is full of sorrows
Hard lies seems to surround our lives
Just live for the moment
I don't care 'bout my brother
This is the words from this coldhearted world

Our lost generation
Is worth fighting for
Innocent creation
The way we were born

The sand in the hourglass is falling
Doomsday bells are calling
Don't we hear the warning

Just live for the moment
We don't care 'bout our brothers
Where are we going?
The whole world is falling

Dare I believe that we can change this world?
A promising future for our children
So many false Messiahs in this world today
They try to lead them on the highway to Hell
