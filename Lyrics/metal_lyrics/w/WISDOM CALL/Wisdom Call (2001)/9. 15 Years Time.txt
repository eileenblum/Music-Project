Read the news about yesterday, five people were killed
It was a tragic massive massacre, killers on the run
Fear comes hysteria, looking for a scapegoat
Four innocent people, judged for the crime they hadn't done

Speaking lies, conscience gone
Fifteen years, nothing has changed
In this crazy messed up world
Fifteen years, nothing has changed

Look back in history, when the carpenter was killed
It was a tragic massive massacre, but victory was born
Fear comes hysteria, looking for a scapegoat
He was an innocent man, judged for the crime that he was cosigned

Speaking lies, conscience gone
Two-Thousand years, nothing has changed
In this crazy messed up world
Two-Thousand years, go in peace and sin no more

Fifteen years, nothing has changed
In this crazy messed up world
Two-Thousand years, go in peace and sin no more
Two-Thousand years, nothing has changed
