See the stars up in the sky
See your creation watching over me
You blesses me with a voice
An open channel for your Kingdom

Yeah I wanna sing, yeah I wanna tell
What you have done for me
You've paid the price
You've light up my eyes
This is my song to you

'Cause I believe in God almighty
He's my King
The keeper of light

Teach my heart to know
Give me sight to see, yeah
