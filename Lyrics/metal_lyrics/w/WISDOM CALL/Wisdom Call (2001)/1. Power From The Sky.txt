Energy running through my veins
Music with power screaming out loud tonight
Look to the sky
Believe what you see
This is the sign from above

Power from the sky
Power
Makes me feel alive with your power

We love to play Power Metal from the sky
See the audience is shouting and banging their heads tonight
Look to the sky
Believe what you see
This is the sign from above
