I just can't let it happen
I can't let it fall away
But my heart keeps on saying
That there just isn't any way
Apprehension overshadows
Hope of my sole desire
I look at you and ask myself
"How can you feel the same as I?"

One day it will be too late forever
As I leave each day behind
I'm haunted by words unspoken
I've so much to give, more than you'll ever find
I have to find within myself
Courage to let you know
As I dream of all that could happen
I let depression take control
I love you
