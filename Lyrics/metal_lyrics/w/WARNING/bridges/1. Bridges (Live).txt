In the darkness I unravel new truths I have suffered for so long to embrace, they will change me from here on. But I can't share it with anyone; I wish you were with me tonight. When I am not alone I sever silent memories; building bridges with meaningless words, but only feel the distance further. Remember being happy in our silence? I wish you were with me tonight. 

I don't need a reason, there's nothing to explain. I can't reproach your leaving to justify my pain. But can I really understand? I wish you were with me tonight. 

I read over all you wrote me; the words mean so much more these days. They echo in my soul. They sting me like a burn. Can someone feel too much? I wish you were with me tonight.
