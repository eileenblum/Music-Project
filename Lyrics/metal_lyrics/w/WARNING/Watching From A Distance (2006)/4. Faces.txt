I want to be master of my own emotions with a fire that fills me,
but I don't understand myself and I don't know, I don't know what my heart is anymore.
I don't want to be standing in this war through pity and responsibility.
So come into my life with your violence and pain,
'cause I feel the depths of a love I've never known. Take a hold of my life,
make it into one that I want it to be. Make a whole of my life, make my faces one that I want you to see.
I can't stand to see confusion in your eyes, when I drift away sometimes,
could I ever be more faithless in my life?
For all the hope I've found in these days.
It's always frightened me how some things lose their meaning,
how some things changed direction with a breeze. Don't ask me where I am,
I am trying to come home, but I can't keep myself from drifting.
Take a hold of my life, make it into one that I want it to be.
Make a whole of my life, make my faces one that I want you to see.
Sometimes it makes me feel feelings which I never hoped to find.
Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm living out of time.
Sometimes it makes me feel feelings which I never hoped to find.
Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm living out of time.
