Sometimes when I watch you, you seem like the same person that I once knew.
And watch from a distance, but never able to do more than I ever would.
Looking at you, I find again I am starving in your mystery.
So far away and some kind of helplessness.
And then I remember that I know you love me, I know you do.
Sometimes when I listen to your fearless voice, it's the voice I once heard.
I want to know you and understand you more than I fear I do.
To keep the wonder, the moment you seem like a stranger to my heart and me.
And all at once, in an instant I see you perfected again.
Though you never change, please remember when you ever think of me.
