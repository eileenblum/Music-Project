A bridge between sun and form:
to cross through shade,
to cross along passages of lesser light

Along these, shapes arrange shadow:
details lost to grey,
intention lost to absence of light

Expressions seeming dulled, denied.
Left to the imagination,
the mind lets loose its worst.

A passing sense of intuition doubted for the dark,
for the worst and for the grey - 
a passing memory: secure, serene, sublime.

The between memory &amp; storms,
when shadows are never still
between fierce design &amp; overkill - 
a passing memory of lightness
is but a likeness which our minds arrange,
for joy or sorrow passing - for all our efforts lost or won,
for forms to shade, design to grey,
intention lost to the absence of light.

Passages arrange, by nature, reemergence.
It is true of passages of shade.
