"Behold our land 
Where we have walked since ages past 
A fortress built from soil and tree 

Behold our land 
Devoid of falsehood, only unyielding nature 
Convalesce within the aegis of quintessence 

And now my brothers! 
We will die again and again 
Together we'll repeat the circle" 

Unarmed and bleeding I'm forced down on my knees 
A stalwart gaze fixed on the gibbet tree 
Yet unbroken and proud I accept my fate 
I close my eyes and reject your blind faith 

Will we die alone? 
Beneath ravens and bones 

I watch the firmament rearrange 
...and gods in deep slumber awake 
Taste the wrath of a million years 
Crack the shell of this celestial sphere 
...and gods in deep slumber awake 

The torn banners of my forefathers 
Lies here scattered from the slaughter 
My corporeal form sway under the sun 
My life's journey has just begun 

Will we die alone? 
Beneath ravens and bones 

The bones 
The signs 
The stars 
All align
