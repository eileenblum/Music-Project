Quench my thirst for endless death 
Liberate my skin beyond our time 
Aphelion, come to me 
My sail is torn under waves of led 
Neptunian abyss, siren's allure 

Relinquish my sight from all pride 
Anchor my form, reliquary of souls 
O Perihelion, come to me 
I can taste thee, I feel thine flesh 
Immolate me under your breath 

I summon thee 
The Boneless One 
Destroyer of ships 
Deceiver of man 

I invocate thee 
The Boneless One 
Devourer of stars 
Douser of light 

I am no longer bound 
Release my ship 
Without my sails, I am free 
I begin my journey 
My sight is clear 
Without my bones, I am free
