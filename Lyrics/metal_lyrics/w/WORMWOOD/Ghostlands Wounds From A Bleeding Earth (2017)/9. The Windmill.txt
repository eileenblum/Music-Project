Each day darker than the one before 
I stand hopeless, empty and alone 
The light from the great afar 
Nothing but smouldering human char 

Watching from a distance 
How life effaced from existence 
This life which could never be 
I drift away within my sea 

From the Windmill, I see it all fall apart 
Light the black flames 
Revelations of the black arts 
...and thus spoke the abyss to me 
Light the black flames 
Revelations of the black arts 

The last sanctuary for mankind 
Upon this darkened hill so confined 
One last flicker from the fire 
Before the impending quagmire 

As men, women, children stood 
In apathy, burning like wood 
My doors are impenetrable 
And I feel no remorse... 

From the Windmill, I see it all fall apart 
Light the black flames 
Revelations of the black arts 

Stain the world colorless 
Stain the world in solitude 
And that which I can not see, means nothing to me 
Stain the world in solitude
