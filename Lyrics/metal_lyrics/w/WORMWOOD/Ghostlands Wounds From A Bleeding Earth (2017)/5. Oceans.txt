Waywards the ravenpath do lead 
Echolalia sounds through these empty halls 
Left and forgotten by a time now gone 
Nothing left but ashen memories 

Creating ways to lead you astray 
Breaking waves 'neath these sky so grey 
I will bleed like the ones before me 
So take heed and witness the end 

We left our home 
Not in fear but in stride 
We won't return 
Until the last one is burnt 

We sail away across all of the seven seas 
Yet we drown before we take our leave 
We take part of a journey that cannot be 
Yet we are judged before we are set free 

These pallid faces which I once knew 
Have turned into a well of lost souls 
The scars from the past have turned the nails of time 
Never to return to brave gone by days 

All we have are scattered recollections 
Now stuck in an endless loop of despondency 
Away from the oceans of woe we foregather 
To rejoice in these final hours 

We sail away across all of the seven seas 
Yet we drown before we take our leave 
We take part of a journey that cannot be 
Yet we are judged before we are set free 

We leave this world through our incomparable deeds 
A nautical journey devoid of fear and greed 
As a spectral concord thrashing like a crest 
Just like the tides of life we'll never get to rest
