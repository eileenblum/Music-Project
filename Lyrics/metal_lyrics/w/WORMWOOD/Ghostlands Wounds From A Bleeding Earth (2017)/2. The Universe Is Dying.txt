Just like they foretold 
At the fires, speaking tales of old 
The boundless welkin 
Autumns wind from the deepest within 

Drawing maps in the sky 
This endless vastness that we can't defy 
A lingering radiance 
Languid songs in saturnine cadence 

In timeless eons I waited 
To see the grand collapse 
The voices from my veins 
Showed me the end of time 

Just like we foretold 
Everything imploded and grew cold 
Fragments of the past 
Feel the darkness grow and outlast 

Our hearts went nova 
Leave behind this frail and dim soma 
The aurora enthralls 
Periastral imminent downfall 

Sing me to sleep 
I shall return 
For we are unborn 

In timeless eons I waited 
To see the grand collapse 
The voices from my veins 
Showed me the end of time 

The universe is dying 
Traces of man undone 
The voices from the void 
As we merged into one
