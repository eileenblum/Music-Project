To worship the land we adore 
Is to feel your soul swept ashore 
On woodland thrones and bones 
We build our homes with stones 

Gods known and unknown 
See my disheartened tears 
My body longs for thee 
At heart you are my only shining dream 

To worship the mountains high 
Is to accept your fate and die 
On the peaks of NordlaniÃ¦ 
We sing as one aria 

Transcend and taste the wind 
Pillars of creation, I peer 
To die in the arms of your kin 
We set sail even though the end is near 

Archaic words and songs 
Pathos to my sullen soul 
Bury me with the last stars 
As they shine no more 

To worship is to claim your firmament 
To worship is to read your last sacrament 
On these shores my brothers have bled 
We weep as the last word is said 

Fly, take me to the sky 
Die, I am forever 
We are the weaves of this cosmic tapestry 
Cry, as the last star is gone
