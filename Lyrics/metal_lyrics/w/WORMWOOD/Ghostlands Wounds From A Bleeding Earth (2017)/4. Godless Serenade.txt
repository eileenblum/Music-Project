We are the wounds from a bleeding earth 

Over thickets, groves and glades, 'neath the valley deep 
The lush verdant hills have been draped in snow 
In the heart of wilderness, nightfall walk with me 
Here I depart from myself, nightfall sing for me 

"-We are the void" 

Telltales of dead winter nights 
My song will usher out the light 
Over natures colonnade 
Behold my godless serenade 

We are the coalescence 
of a billion stars 
Just like restless souls 
Waiting in endless rows 

When the world turns into cinder and ash 
"-I beckon thee, my formless creator 
I am the fire and the sea my vindicator"
