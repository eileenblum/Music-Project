You'll never know unless you survive. You'll never know unless you survive, believe in me as I believe in you. These feelings are mutual. Take the plunge, because this is absolution. The absolution of negativity. No longer will we be casualties. To an unrelenting world. Replenish your resolve. Let life pour from your eyes. Rejuvenate, rejuvenate. Let strike fall by the wayside rejuvenate, rejuvenate. You'll never know unless you survive. Let life pour from your eyes.
Rejuvenate, rejuvenate. Let strike fall by the wayside.
Rejuvenate, rejuvenate. You'll never know unless you survive. Believe in me as I believe in you. These feelings are mutual. Take the plunge, because this is the absolution. The air that you breathe is all that you need. All you could ever need. Be the current that carves the stone. With force with persistence. Be the heart that weathers the storm. With strength with resolve. Self doubt can plague you control you, subdue you, but we are the unbroken and this is our song. We are unbroken and this is our song. Let life pour from your eyes. Rejuvenate, rejuvenate. Let strife fall by the wayside rejuvenate, rejuvenate.
