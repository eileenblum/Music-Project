I feel so numb. So stale, so confused.So cold towards the life that I've built.
Stuck in the mud as the rest pass me by. I do my best to keep my mind occupied.
Repeating this is fine, this is fine. So let the fire rise.
I've spent so much time up on the fence, just to see which side was greener.
My vision is blurred, my speech is slurred, and I'm only getting deeper.
To walk away and separate completely. No I've gotta finish what I've started.
I feel so torn, so worn, so detached, so cold towards the life that I've led.
With every rise there is a fall. Trust me I've seen it all. I've spent so much time up on the fence, just to see which side is greener. My vision is blurred, my speech is slurred, and I'm only getting deeper to walk away and separate completely. No I've gotta finish what I've started. Never have any regrets, because at one time or another they were exactly what you wanted. This is exactly what you want. Let the fire rise. Cause everything, everything is fine. Let the fire rise, cause everything is fine.
