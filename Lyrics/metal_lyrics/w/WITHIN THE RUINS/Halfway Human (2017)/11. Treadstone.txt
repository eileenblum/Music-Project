You found me when I wasn't looking. Having no interest to pursue.
Something so tried, something true. You consumed me, yet I owned you. We've had our time, now I send you off. You're no longer mine. This is goodbye. You made a believer out of me, a soul aflame and extinguished. While wrapped into one entity. I've adored you. I've explored you, but this is where I must leave you. I've loved you, I've endured you, but this is where I must leave you. We've had our time, now I send you off. Nothing left to give, nothing more to say. We've had our time, now I send you off. You're no longer mine. This is goodbye, I've adored you. I've explored you, but this is where I must leave you. I've loved you, I've endured you, but this is where I must leave you. I found you when you weren't looking. Having no intention to pursue something so tried, something so true. You consumed me, yet I owned you. We've had our time, now I send you off. You're no longer mine. This is goodbye. We've had our time. This is goodbye. You're no longer mine. This is goodbye.
