False gods! There are more criminals among us. Than behind cold prison walls. They stand on podiums above us. False promises masked in their calls, powers that lead. Fail to set precedent. Lie, cheat, fake, steal. Paint themselves in innocence. What will we do? 'cause the fire is in our own backyard. Powers that be, fail to set precedent. Lie, cheat, fake, steal. Dress themselves in abhorrence. How can we, can we change? What does not want to change. How can we have a voice? While our mouths are sewn shut. False gods! A simple smile can only hide so much. This behavior is predictable and must be treated as such. They'll always use our hope as their crutch, powers that lead. Fail to set precedent. Lie, cheat, fake, steal. Paint themselves in innocence. Powers that be. Fail to set precedent. Lie, cheat, fake, steal. Dress themselves in abhorrence. What will we do? 'cause the fire is in our own backyard. How can we change, can we change? What does not want to change, how can we have a voice? While our mouths are sewn shut. We'll shrug our shoulders and accept the fact that we're all just fucked. We're all fucked. What will we do? 'cause the fire is in our backyard. We're all fucked.
