It all started with an embrace. While ill intents were put into place.
Tongues intertwined so neither dare to speak. Boiling beneath restless skin.
Nerves begin to tingle, and hearts syncopate to the beat of the drum.
Covetous hands cradle the flesh. Destroying the fragile, destroying the weak.
Accepting the beautiful, the beautiful in agony.
This is a display of true power, this is to the ecstasy riddled submissive.
It all started with an embrace. While ill intents were put into place it all started with an embrace. Now staring eyes drift into space, a seductive spell cast unto the most deviant at heart.
A forceful caress causes skin to shiver. These four walls ashamed by what they've seen. But they do not have a choice, and hearts syncopate to the beat of the drum. Covetous hands cradle the flesh. Destroying the fragile, destroying the weak. Accepting the beautiful the beautiful in agony. This is a display of true power. This is to the ecstasy riddled submissive. Do it!
It all started with an embrace. While ill intents were put into place. It all started with an embrace now staring eyes drift into space. Oh my god. Paralyzed. This is true power. This is true ecstasy. Oh my god. Paralyzed.
