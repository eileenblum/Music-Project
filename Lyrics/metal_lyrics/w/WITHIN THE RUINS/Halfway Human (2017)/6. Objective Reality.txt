I need time, time to heal. I need to feel a place where I am free.
My mind goes blank with no chance of a spark. All recent issues inhaled by the dark. The pressure of the world comes barreling down. Crushed beneath it's weight I can hear no sound. A glimpse of light pours down. I gravitate to it's height, but I don't like what the fuck I see. I see a world in decay. A tragedy strikes everyday. Just keep me here. I need a space to think, a space to feel.
A space where time, time is irrelevant. I need a place to think. A place to heal, a place where I am free. This is where I want to remain forever. Indulging in my thoughts. Reveling in their splendor. The pressure of the world comes barreling down. I welcome it's weight, and I refuse to hit the ground. A higher state of consciousness. This is where I stay where I remain. Just keep me here. I see a world in decay. A tragedy strikes everyday. I need a space to think, a space to feel. A space where time, time is irrelevant. I need a place to think. A place to heal. A place where I am free. I need time, time heal. I need to feel a place where I am free.
