Hey tell me have you heard the good news? Your ego is dead.
Swinging from its noose. Repugnant. I hope you wake up sterile and dry. To put an end to your pitiful bloodline. I hope these words burn cause I'm not fighting clean. Unbreakable. I often have a recurring fantasy, of your dreams dying while you watch dejectedly. Back and forth we go. Where we'll stop, no one knows. At first glance it is you that I loath, but it really is just brotherly love. The time has come for you to give up. Step down, die slow. We've both had enough. Had enough. Your methods archaic, but yet effective. Display a true theory of domination. In sovereign pain is where I leave you to rot. In desolate pain is where I leave you to rot. Back and forth we go. Where we'll stop, no one knows. At first glance it is you that I loathe, but it really is just brotherly love. This is my only true, true aspiration. That this becomes your reality. This is my only true true aspiration.
