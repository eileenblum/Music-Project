Born with a purpose. The walking miracle. A soul unlike any other
The world was not ready for this. Now I scream to split the sky, just to reach you. I scream, now I reach for you, it's all for you. We weren't ready for this. A warm embrace gone cold, but I still feel you with me. Grasping cold hard ground, yet I feel you beneath me. Despite the tears that hit this page. I smile knowing you are at rest. With every breath that fills my lungs. Your legacy lives on in all that we do. Now I scream to split the sky, just to reach you. I scream, now I reach for you. It's all for you. I'll smash the earth, just to reach you. I am with your ghost now. I am with your ghost now. We weren't ready for this. A warm embrace gone cold, but I still feel you with me. So many words fall silent, yet I still feel you hearing me. Despite the tears that hit this page. I smile and with this I digress. Now I scream to split the sky, just to reach you. I scream, now I reach for you. It's all for you. I've met with familiar smells. Nostalgia has gripped me. I am with your ghost now. I am with your ghost now. Now I reach for you. I am with your ghost now. I scream to split the sky. I am with your ghost now.
