I disgust the people that make this planet so ugly. I despise the
people who make us, make us so weary. To the liars, cheaters, and fakes. The
ones draining any sense of dignity; Go ahead and tell me I'm wrong. The greedy,
the corrupt and religious rite. Just three more examples of who I spite. Anyone
of them would see you die, all you have to do is name a price. So name your
price. Anyone of them would see you die, all you have to do is name a price. So
name your price. People dying to survive right outside your door. It's not you,
so fuck it right? My hatred will outpour. I scream so can you hear me. Can you
fucking hear me? Greed has poisoned the soul of man, barricading the world with
hate. Humanity in misery. Underneath your prophecy. You will see the savagery.
You will follow me. Irresolute reality. Shrouded in hypocrisy. Blinded by
disparity, my misanthropy. The bad outweigh the good. The corrupt dominate the
pure. This is the world in which we live; this is my justified misanthropy. And
so it goes.
