Fear is the mind controller
Fear is the mind destroyer
Instill fear into the mind of the weak
And obtain the power that you seek
A method used since the dawn of time
Bet your ass you will fall in line
Fall in Line
Pain was granted to those who tried to stray from order
Trust is a flaw in every man's design and you are not worthy of mine
Worthy of mine
This is not
This is not the life I had in mind
This will not be the way I carry on
This is not the life I had in mind
I will not live under this veil
This is not the life I had in mind
I will not live under this veil
Over all that is spread out before me
I exist, above dismay, above fear
Over all that is exposed before me
I exist. I exist.
Fear in nothing, no man, no god
Fear in nothing, no words, no creed
Fear in nothing, no man, no god
Fear in nothing, no words, no creed
Over all that is spread out before me
I exist, above dismay, above fear
Above dismay, above fear
Over all that is exposed before me
I exist
It's time to separate yourself from the grip of this oppression
