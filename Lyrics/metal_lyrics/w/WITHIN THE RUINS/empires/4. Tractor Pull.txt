Not for nothing, but you'd give it all. My heart is blackened with your lies. Bury me in an unmarked grave. You have destroyed everything. Living in the past is now. Some things will never change. You wore out your welcome. You've overstayed your time so get yourself together. Some things will never change so let's destroy. Fucking destroy your fucking life. No one wants to see the fucking truth. I didn't take part in the demise of thousands. I promise you'll get yours. Sooner or later. I promise. Sooner or later. Judgment will be paid. The price will be paid. Our hearts could never weather the storm. Who were we kidding? How long can I go before I take myself out? How long can I go? You wore out your welcome. You've overstayed your time. Some things will never change. Living in the past is now. Throw me in an unmarked grave.
