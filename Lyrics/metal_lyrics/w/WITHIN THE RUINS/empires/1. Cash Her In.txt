By now I can hear the sirens. They're getting close now. Just hold one more minute. Time is against us now. Someone call for help. Save her she's going to die. Turning. Replaying it all in my head. Walk onto death and let the stars be your compass. Pray for stars. Don't close your eyes just yet. Faster now. We're picking up speed. We're set to crash. You're dragging your feet again. So walk onto death. With words unspoken I've given up. I've given up on you. By now I can hear the sirens. They're getting close now. Just hold one more minute. Time is against us now. Someone call for help. Save her she's going to die. Turning. Replaying it all in my head. Walk onto death and let the stars be your compass. Brace your fall.
