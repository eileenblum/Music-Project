We're going down into churning waters and we will plunge through the great divide and we will be buried in the water. We will be buried in the water. Buried in the water. Swallowed by the mouth of God. Caught in this single form. I will take your fury. She got the taste of blood in her mouth so feed her to the sharks. The water is building up. The water is building in her lungs. Drown. The water is rising. The water is building up. The water is rising so hold your breath and drown. Just let me go because you'd give up everything for nothing. You'd give up everything for nothing. You'd give up everything. Pushing my head underwater. Could you imagine pushing my head underwater? We're going down into churning waters and we will plunge through the great divide and we will be buried in the water. We will be buried in the water. Death tides carry the bodies ashore. As I walk closer to the end. Is this the only thing we have to try and stay above the churning water? Is this the only thing we have to try and keep from drowning? I'll count the bodies you have left behind. Drown. Walk onto death. Hold your breath and drown. She got the taste of blood in her mouth. Blood.
