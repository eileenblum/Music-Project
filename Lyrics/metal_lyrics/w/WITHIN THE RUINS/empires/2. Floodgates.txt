Tonight early dusk will bring you fear that I'll be gone. Like a shadow with the dark. Fleeting like the northern winds. Catch me as I pass you by. Will you follow me as the wind blows through the open window and crosses your face will a cool breeze. I'm all around you. I am everywhere. How does it feel to have the tables turned. What compels you. Is it courage or fear that drives you. I hope you're finally happy that I've gone away. We'll be swept away. When I open the floodgates. We will be swept away. Open the window and let in the night air. Release me. Into a world not so cold. Not so cold. Do you know what it's like to breath through someone else's lungs. Follow the trade winds. But they won't bring you sleep. To find the place where I lay my head. The prevailing winds will bring us down.
