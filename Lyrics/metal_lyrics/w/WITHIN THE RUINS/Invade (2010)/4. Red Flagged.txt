War screamed from your mouth
as we sat and watched patiently
while madness began taking over.
This was a red flag screaming
we were cast out and ignored,
and then the bullets began streaming.

I can lift my hand and make it all new again.
I can speak one word and you will never hear again.
I send plagues of weapons to eliminate your kind.
But we never asked, we never asked for this.

We do not fear what you have done,
we fear what you have become.
We do not fear what you have done,
we fear what you have become.

Try to save.....yourselves.

When it rains, it will pour
dissolve all, all of our reckoning.
When it rains, it will pour
dissolve all, all of our reckoning.
Reckoning.

A spark of deviance
will shatter any glimmer of hope
and all will become submissive,
you will become submissive.

This is what we feared,
I'll be your architect of doom.
This is what we feared,
I'll be your architect of doom.
