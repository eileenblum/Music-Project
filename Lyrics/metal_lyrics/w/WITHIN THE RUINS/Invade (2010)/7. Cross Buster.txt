I'm getting something off my chest,
see I never liked your religion organized.
I've learned to keep my mouth shut,
I've learned to hold my tongue,
but this has gone way too far.
How can you preach unity
while practicing segregation?

He's never coming
no resurrections.
He's never coming
because he did not exist.
I believe what I believe
so don't force your faith on me.

We're in this world together
saints or sinners,
it makes no difference.
I'm free to speak my mind
because nothing is sacred.
You add to our decline
while holding the hand of God.
You add to our decline
while holding the hand of God.

Faith is just a crutch to lean on
so fear what you don't know.
You're just blinding yourself
with false security.
Living a life of lies,
I hope you take offense to this!
You have passed judgment on me,
Now I'm judging you.
