A wise man once told me
I reminded him of himself
when he was young.
He saw the respect in my eyes and said
"Stop at nothing and I will see you again one day".

I have stood where you are standing
I have thought what you are thinking.
Now I stand before you
sharing my story.
There is nothing wrong
with chasing a dream
There is nothing wrong
with chasing your dream.

These words might be simple,
but they will change your life.
You will gain everything
and regret nothing.
Regret nothing.
Remember how you got here
something no one can take from you.
Experiences to last a life time,
and no one can take them from you.
Take them from you.

Just live and don't look back,
if it seems that you have failed
dust yourself off
and wipe the sweat from your head.

Set the stage.
Scrape my bones from the pavement.
Light the fuse and run.
We're all in danger
The clock is ticking and our time will soon expire.
This road can kill you but its worth every mile.
I'm never leaving here.
I'm never coming home.
