Digging through trenches still
but our work is not done yet.
Forcing ourselves
through all who oppose.
We are not afraid to get our hands dirty,
not afraid because we were always filthy.
Knee deep in what we love,
but our work is not done yet.
We've got a job to do.

Never turn your back on us.
We stand tall, we stand firm.
Now it's time to hit them where it hurts.
Walk towards us
and stand in our shadow.
Walk towards us
and be the ones that follow.
We've gotten our hands dirty
and we wont stop now.
We've gotten our hands dirty
and we wont stop now.

To think that we would stop
you must have lost
your fucking mind.
We are continuous,
We are never-ending.

We'll give you something to believe in
let us be your breath of fresh air.
Now breathe us in.
We are bringing life into something stagnant.

You lost your fucking mind.

We will stand aside,
one by one
watch you die.
We (we will) will stand aside,
one by one
watch you die.
