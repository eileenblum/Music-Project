If God is real than he's an evil motherfucker
He's watching his greatest creation
die before his eyes, dead before his eyes.
There is a war outside, so wake up!

If God is real he's probably kicking back
enjoying the show.
As his greatest creation cries before his eyes,
cry because he lied.

Here I am with arms wide open.
I'm calling you out!
Show yourself, I'm calling you out.
Show yourself, I'm calling.
I'm calling you out.

If God is real than he's an evil motherfucker
he's watching his greatest creation
die before his eyes, dead before his eyes.

Fuck your mysterious ways
Fuck your "gift" of free will.

This is me versus him.
This is me in my finest hour.
I'm calling you out.

This is me versus him.
This is me in my finest hour.
I'm fucking calling him out.

With him you are godless.
With him you are fucking hopeless.
(Fucking hopeless)

This is me versus him.
This is me in my finest hour.
This is me calling him
calling him, calling him.
