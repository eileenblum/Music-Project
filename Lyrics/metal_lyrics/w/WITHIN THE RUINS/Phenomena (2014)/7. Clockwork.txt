Oh what to do, what to do when a city had run amuck
can't tell the surviving from the dying
can't tell the corrupt from the pure
The gutters are full of blood
from the sex, scum, politics, and whores
Like a beaten child this city
whimpers backed into a corner with no one to save it
But there are still few who believe in blocking the hands that bleeds that bleed this city dry
suck it up for the ones that deserve to be alive
Justice coming to all of us
no matter what the fuck we do
This is not a conquest of men,
but of the evils that beset them.
It's all so confusing, but yet so simple
The American Dream is condemned and we're all going down.
The gutters are full of blood
from the sex, scum, politics, and whores
Like a beaten child this city whimpers
But there are still few who believe in blocking the hand that bleeds that bleeds this dry
suck it up for the ones that deserve to be alive
Judgement will come not with a gavel, but with a nuclear blast.
This utopia was built on horror
It's all so confusing, but yet so simple
The American Dream is condemned
and we're all going down.
