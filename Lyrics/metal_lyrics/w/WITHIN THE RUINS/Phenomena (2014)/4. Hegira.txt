Whatever life holds in store for me,
I will never forget these words
With great power comes great responsibility
This is my gift, my curse
My story is not for the faint of heart
an entire life built in tragedy.
And if was all my fault.
Some say they don't want to own it
People like me.
we don't get a choice.
Take what's thrown at you head on. Head on!
My story is not for the faint of heart
an entire life built on tragedy.
This means everything.
The love, the horror and all in between
This means everything.
The love, the horror and all in between
Whatever life holds in store for me,
I will never forget these words:
With great power comes great responsibility
This is my gift, my curse
Courageous, self sacrificing
I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength,
makes us noble, and allows us to die with pride
My story is not for the faint of heart
an entire lie built on tragedy
I must answer my calling
It is what's expected of me
