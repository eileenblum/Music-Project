I am a new class of evil a cynic, a thief / a criminal with no sympathy / I will smile. My insidious smile. / My anarchist living dream / I am an agent of chaos / I am a force, a force of nature / I will smile. / My insidious smile / Live just to watch it all burn / No
plan no code no reason why / I relieve you of the burden / Of your failed an useless lives. / As your world crumbles / Your failed and useless lives are fucking done / m chaos spreads faster / Than a virus running from its cure / I'm a infectious  as the next  Welcome
the sickness / And all in in love with it / I will carve a smile into this pathetic world / All it takes is one bad day / To deliver a man of lunacy / And today is that day / I will carve a smile / Into this pathetic world / With my insidious smile / I will carve a smile
into this pathetic world.
