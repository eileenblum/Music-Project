Crash against her and be broken
Lying dormant in the depths of her consciousness
she always knew I was there,
kept me away, kept at bay
witness the birth of a goddess
What do you know of unlimited power
She's all she could want to be
She is fire! Life incarnate! now and forever
She is the rock of the eternal shore.
Crash against her and be broken
Hunger for the feeling of ecstasy
I crave the ultimate sensation
Lust for the feeling,
Lust for the feeling
of this destiny,
it consumes me
Crash against her and be broken
She is fire! Life incarnate!
Now and forever
She is the rock of the eternal shore.
Crash against her and be broken
An essence of beautiful terror Her power is a strong within herself
Ask not for pity, there is none in her
Ask not for mercy, there is none in her
Crash against her and be broken
What do you know of unlimited power
She's all she could want to be
She is fire! Life incarnate! Now and forever She is the rock of the eternal shore.
Crash against her and be broken
She is fire. Life incarnate.
She is fire. Life incarnate.
