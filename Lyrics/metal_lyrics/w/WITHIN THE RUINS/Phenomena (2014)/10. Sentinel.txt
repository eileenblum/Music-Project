Born into a life of luxury
Born into a life of war
Seeing what my genius was used or
I've decided o give something more.
my mind, my body, my mortality
I've found purpose I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
Looking
I can now reach and touch the sky.
What really makes a man a man?
Is it love? Loss?
or his will to survive.
I've put these people in danger with the weapons I create
One the merchant of death
now an advocate of peace
my mind, my body, my mortality
I've found purpose I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
Looking in
I can now reach and touch he sky.
Sentinel
My creation and I are in sync
My creation and I are in sync
My purpose I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
Looking in
I can now reach and ouch the sky.
Sentinel
My creation and I are in sync
My creation and i are n sync
Bound the soul to the machine
Born into life of luxury
Born into a life of war
Seeing what my genius was used for
I've decided to give something more.
my mind, my body, my mortality
I've found purpose I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
What really makes a man a man?
Is it love? Loss? or his will?
What really makes a man man? is love? loss?
or his will to survive.
Looking in
I can now reach and touch the sky.
