What lies underneath?
a symbol of your hope
a symbol of my fear
A product of a man raised in shadows
Some say you can't fight fate
some say you can't survive alone
But it's what i do
Its what I do that defines me
never falter
Never suffer
under any atrocity
never falter
Never suffer under any enormity
You'll never see me coming
I am the dark monarch
I must disguise my terror.
This mask created what I am.
My disguise must strike terror.
This mask created what I am.
You'll never see me coming
I am the dark monarch
A product of man
raised in shadows
