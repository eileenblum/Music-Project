They drew first blood
Just like I knew they would
Fearing what they donât understand
We are evolution

They drew first blood
Just like I knew they would
Fearing what they donât understand
We are evolution
We are gods

We were more than friends
That all changed with a spark of insanity
But I dream of a perfect harmony
Gods walking one with humanity
But I ask not for friendship or love
All I demand is fear and blind obedience
Cease your revelry and heed me

Let me in
Let me in

Free your mind
Trust in me
Iâll show you what it is to feel complete
Free your mind
Trust in me
Iâll show you what it means

They drew first blood
Just like I knew they would
Fearing what they donât understand
We are evolution
We are gods

Oppression is no excuse
For vengeance forgive and forget to live in harmony
Inconceivable your dream is dead
Because they drew first blood
Just like I knew they would

Please let me in

Free your mind
Trust in me
Iâll show you what it is to feel complete
Free your mind
Trust in me
Iâll show you what it means

I ask not for friendship or love
All I demand is fear and blind obedience
Cease your revelry and heed me
Cease your revelry and heed me

Free your mind
Trust in me
Iâll show you what it is to feel complete
Free your mind
Trust in me
Iâll show you what it is to feel complete
Free your mind
Trust in me
Iâll show you what it is to feel complete
Free your mind
Trust in me
Iâll show you what it means
