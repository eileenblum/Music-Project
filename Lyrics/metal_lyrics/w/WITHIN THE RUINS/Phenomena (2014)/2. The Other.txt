I've never felt so alive / was nothing until I found my other half, my missing parcel / Crept into the deep of my mind a villain's strength now amplified / To know us is to love us / Welcome to serenity / Welcome to our complexity / We are infinite / There is only
carnage / We'll kill you most mercifully we choose our victims most carefully / There is only carnage / My body is aged but my spirit is free / I feel nothing but contempt cold and empty. / Never wound what you can't kill / I am the ultimate insanity / I was hollowed out
inside empty. / Welcome to our insanity / Welcome to our complexity / We are infinity / We'll kill you most merciful we choose our victims most carefully / There is only Carnage / My body is caged but my spirit is free / I feel nothing but contempt and empty. / There I
only carnage / We'll kill you most mercifully we choose our victims most carefully.
