Everyday is exactly the same
woke up by memories
and all these twisted dreams
Not sure how I got here
Not sure where I belong
Though one thing is certain
I've survived through it all.
I go where i wanna go
I see what i what to see
Always on the run,
but I'll never forget loyalty
I've survived through it all.
Still I continue on
Never try to cage the beast.
For it's what sets you free
Rely only on instinct
for it's what sets you free
The blood of thousands are on my hands, but they all deserved it.
They fucking deserved it.
I set them free
I'm still here
I go where I wanna go
I see what I want to see
Always on the run,
I go where I wanna go
I see what I want to see
but I'll never forget loyalty
Never try to cage the beast.
For it's what sets you free.
Rely only on instinct
The blood of thousands are on my hands,
but they all deserved it.
They fucking deserved
I set them free
I'm still here
Everyday is exactly the same woke up by the pain felt through all these years.
I've died a thousand times
This is my burden
This rage is my savior
This rage is my cure
This rage is my savior
This rage is my cure
This rage is my enemy
It is how I endure
