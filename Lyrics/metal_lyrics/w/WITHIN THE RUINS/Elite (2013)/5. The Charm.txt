Tonight's the night, and he's ready for a thrill
He's got a plan in place, and he's dressed to kill
Tonights the night, and he's dressed to impress

She never knew what she had coming
He seemed so charming, so promising

Any fool could see his intent
How could she be so blind?
How could she be so blind?

Now she wakes alone and confused
Now she wakes up alone and confused

He walks away, his mission's been fulfilled
He changed her life, in the blink of an eye

Now the predator, has become the prey
I'm hunting scum, that's all there is to say
I can't wait for his throat to fill my hands
I will squeeze and ignore all demands

Vengeance is what fills my eyes
I follow his every step, close behind
The chance to be alone is finally here
Can't turn back now, my motives are clear

Tonight's the night, and I'm ready for a thrill
I've got a plan in place, now I'm dressed to kill
Tonight's the night, and he's dressed to impress
Without, without a shred of innocence

Strap him down
This night of torture begins, now
He awakens and begins to struggle
Sees my face and begins to buckle

This is violence
This is revenge

This is violence and revenge (this is violence)
This is violence and revenge (this is revenge)
This is violence and revenge (this is violence)
This is violence and revenge
This is revenge
