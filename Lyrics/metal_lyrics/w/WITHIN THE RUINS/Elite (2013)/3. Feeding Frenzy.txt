You're eating yourself alive
Alive and you don't even see it
Accept the signs
You can take it or leave it

Whatever happened to integrity?
Whatever happened to sincerity?
A feeding frenzy
A monstrosity

Leeching on to a host and never letting go
You're bleeding it dry
Draining it of any growth
Once a leech now turned into a ghost
The feeding frenzy has left you all alone

So now it's time to let go
So now it's time to let go
So now it's time to let go

The only thing a fool knows
The only thing that is visible
Is what has been put on the pedestal
The only thing a fool knows

Leeching on to a host and never letting go
You're bleeding it dry
Draining it of any growth
Once a leech now turned into a ghost
The feeding frenzy has left you all alone

Their sights are set
And now they feed
Their senses are numb
But still they feed (but still they feed)

Forgive them for they know not what they do
This is all they know
Their senses are numb
And still, and still they feed
And still they feed

They're eating themselves alive

So now
(It's time) It's time to let go
(It's time to let go)
Let go (it's time to let go)
Let go (it's time to let go)
Go
