Imagine opening your eyes to a world defiled (to a world defiled)
A black, scorched earth
And a blood-filled sky

This is nothing more than a fascination
An extremely morbid infatuation
This is the end of humanity existing
Painful to say, but we had this coming

In this absolute hell
Is where I thrive
In this absolute hell
Is where I feel alive
In this absolute hell
Is where I thrive
In this absolute hell
Is where I feel alive
Feel alive

Cities will crumble
And the world's worst will become humble

It seems today is the day that you will die
So tell me how you feel about your life

Now imagine everything you love
Engulfed in fire

Hopes and dreams are melting
To the devil's choir

In this absolute hell
Is where I thrive
In this absolute hell
Is where I feel alive
In this absolute hell
Is where I thrive
In this absolute hell
Is where I feel alive

I can tell you
That I will embrace the end
Consider my journey fulfilled

Everything was all worth while
And as I gently smile
I become one with a world defiled

As I gently smile
I become
I become one with a world defiled
Become one with a world defiled
