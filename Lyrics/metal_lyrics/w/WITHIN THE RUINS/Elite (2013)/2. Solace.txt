The luster is now gone (now gone)
I know where I belong
A vagabond by nature
A life only I can endure

I find solace, I find peace
I find peace in the unforeseen
And now my satisfaction is achieved

Welcome filth, accept uncertainty
Comfort in knowing I am not alone
Passion is shared, hardships endured
Learn from this, and fucking grow

Grow

Live, eat, breathe, bleed
Striving to reach the peak
Sweat, grind, break, bleed
Satisfaction achieved
Live, eat, breathe, bleed
Striving to reach the peak
Sweat, grind, break, bleed
Satisfaction achieved

I find solace, I find peace
I find peace in the unforeseen
And now my satisfaction is achieved

This is a statement to always try
This is a statement to never die
Now I boldly say
I can never die

Live, eat, breathe, bleed
Striving to reach the peak
Sweat, grind, break, bleed
Striving to reach the peak
Striving to reach the peak

Fuck the impending
The condescending
This is what I live by
A testament to always try
Defy, defy, defy (defy)

I can never die
Never die
Always strive
Never deny
I was built
To survive
