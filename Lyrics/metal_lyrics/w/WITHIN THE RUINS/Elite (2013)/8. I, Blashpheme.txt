It seems I'm the anti-Christ
It seems I'm the devil's child
One look and it's clear to see
This is a mockery
I was sent to poison your minds
Denounce your faith and exploit the lies

Just take one look and it's clear to see
The only one laughing is me
(I've followed in those foot steps
I've strayed from that broken path)

You are my never-healing sore
A cancer I can't seem to shake
Seething, breathing, swarming, transforming
Seething, breathing, swarming, transforming

I'm merely here to speak no lies
Shed some light and open some eyes
Not all of us are born with an open mind
And some are bred into unfair lives

You are my never-healing sore
A cancer, that I can't seem to shake
You are my never-healing sore
A cancer, that I can't seem to shake

It seems everyone is out to criticize
All your judging will lead to your demise
I'll never be the one to watch my words
I will never be silenced
I live to get a rise out of you all

This is a mockery

You're wasting your time
Focusing your hate on me
I'm just a man
Now turn your cheek
Just as you've been taught
For it is you
That I blaspheme

You are my never healing sore
A cancer, that I can't seem to shake
You are my never healing sore
A cancer, that I can't seem to shake
You are my never healing sore
A cancer, that I can't seem to shake
You are my never healing sore
A cancer, that I can't seem to shake...
