This is for you, my beloved, my blood
The ones that I hold dear (the ones that I hold dear)
This is for you, my brothers, my blood
The ones that I would die for

I would never trade any of you
Allegiance proven through and through

We are forever

It would be a disservice
To say you didn't deserve this
After all you have done for me
You all deserve this

We stand at each other's side
We stand at each other's side
No matter what, in you I confide

You all deserve this
You all deserve this

Years have bonded our sense of pride
We share a bond that can never be broken
These words, better sung not spoken
These words, better sung not spoken

We give the shirts off our backs, we'll give you everything
Giving each other a reason to live
But only for our own, but only for our own

This is for you, my beloved, my blood
The ones that I hold dear
This is for you, my brothers, my blood
The ones that I would die for

Times will change
People will too
This is my ode to you, to always stay true

No matter the roads that lie ahead
You will never be a weight that's too heavy to carry
No matter the roads that lie ahead
You will never be a weight that's too heavy to carry
