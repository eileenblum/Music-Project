I am here to invoke the beast in you
Tear out the pain that you've consumed
Trust in me as I stare into you
I recognize all that you've been through
(All that you've been through)

Because I have been there too
Because I have been there too

Provoke what makes you torn
Now flip that switch and transform

We are fucking elite
And nothing can ever touch us
We are elite
As for the rest
Obsolete

Within these walls we are defiant
Look at this as your therapy

Lose yourself
In this moment of cleansing
Lose yourself
In this moment of intensity

As for the rest, obsolete

We are elite
We are elite
We are elite

Shed your mortal shell
Let those inner demons free
Close those eyes and dig deep

Clench your fists
And with me say

What makes your hair stand tall
What makes your blood boil
What makes your skin crawl
Channel these feelings and erupt

(Now we're rigged and set to explode)
We are elite
This is where you belong
We are elite
This is where you belong
We are elite
This is where you belong
