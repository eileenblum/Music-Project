We have dethroned the King so you could step in. Who do you think you are? You are just a man, you are. You are just a man. No such divinity. You are just a man. You have destroyed the Book of Books to replace it with your lies. Pray for your life. Pray for your life as you preyed on us. Pray for your God. Pray. Choose a side. You walk the line. We chose our own path. We chose our own path. We chose our own life. You're all like the rest. Stand in line. Deceive us and lead us into the dark. Deceive us and lead us. Deceive us and lead us into the dark. Deceive. You could never bring us down. We have dethroned the King so you could step in. You have dethroned the King. Reveal yourself to the ones you falsely lead. Reveal your face. Watch over and set me free.
