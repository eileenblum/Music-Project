Silence. Falls upon the room he condemns. All eyes ahead. Now that I have got your attention. All eyes to the front of the room. Listen closely. Now that I have got your attention. Listen closely. I won't repeat myself. Read these words. I speak these truths. Watch them bring us down. I speak the truth. You will be know for nothing. You will be left for dead. You will be know for nothing. You will be left for dead. Devour the sick and spit out the weak. Sell the poor to the slaves. Devour the sick and spit out the weak. Sell the poor to the slaves and extinguish them. Chapels burn and rooftops crash. Chapels burn. Rooftops crash. I hate the world. I hate the world so let it hate me back. Now that I have your attention. Believe what you want. You're just better off living in the darkness. Believe what you want. Is this what you want. We believe in what we want. We don't believe in any of your shit. No. We believe in what we want. We don't believe in any of your shit. Why. Why am I the one who suffers from your choices. You decided my fate. Living amongst the men that have perished. Let the whole thing burn. We built this land on glory. Save me from the end.
