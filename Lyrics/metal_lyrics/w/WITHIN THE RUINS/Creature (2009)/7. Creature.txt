I've seen how it goes. You've played this card before. I've already seen your hand. You deserve the hand you've been dealt. I'll be laughing all the way to the bank. You deserve the hand you've been dealt. We'll see who comes out on top in the end. All eyes on the sky. You better sleep with one eye open. It creeps in, in the night. Wake up. Wake up the plagues it's coming tonight. Hurry to the door. Shut the windows. Don't say a word. This could be our last night. It creeps in the night. Have the tellers call the cops. There's a whore on the run. She's headed your way. Wait for it. I know you're dying to hear my side of the story we seem to tangle ourselves in. I'll try to clear my lungs. I'll be resuscitated. I've struggled against the tide. Try to sink this ship. Is that all you've got? Now believe my story. Sucked to the depths. I lost my crew. I lost it all.
