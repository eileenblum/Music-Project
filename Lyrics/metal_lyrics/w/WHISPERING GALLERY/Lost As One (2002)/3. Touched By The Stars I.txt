I was born,
On this planet earth.
Civilization was so far away.
Had to struggle,
To survive on my own.
But they told me
I was raised by the gods.

It's my destiny;
Here is where I belong.
Is there someone for me?
Will the stars reach out
And guide me far away.
All my dreams fulfilled,
I shall be the one.

Oh, how I want to free my mind.
And I want to free my soul.
Although I wonder,
Will I ever reach her?
The distance won't tear us apart.
Will the stars reach out
And take me far away.
All my dreams fulfilled,
Shall I be the one.
