Look deep inside of me.
Where the darkness awaits.
Come a little closer.
Don't take your eyes of me.

I am your mistress guardian.
Everywhere you go, I will follow.

Now you know me better.
No, you can't run and hide.
When your time has come.
I will comfort you.
Your feared and suspicious mind.
I am everywhere you look.
Reach out your fragile hands.
I'll take you to another world.

Now I am in total control.
Sence my presence, hear my voice.
Reach out your fragile hands.
I'll guide, I'll teach you.
Your life depends on me.
No, you can't hide your soul from me.
Your life depends on me.
No, you can't hide your soul from me.

When I am controlling you.
Anger becomes your deepest fear.
Time is running out.
And no one can hear your screams.
Come out play with me.
I will mean no harm.
It's so imposable.
For such an easy prey.
