It all happened at a cold night,
A clear sky filled with stars.
When I saw a mysterious light
In this mystic drawing nearer.
A rain of falling stars
Were shining in my eyes.
Now I really want to know...

How to free my mind,
Free my soul.
Although I know...
How to free my soul,
Free my mind.
Although I'm never
Going to reach her.

Watching all those years go by.
In my own captivity.
Listen to my lonely prayers.
Thinking about the ones I've lost.
Suffering from the pain inside
Touched by the stars
And there shining light.
Only the stars
Will guide me to the future.
All those years of isolation.
Is this the moment,
I've been longing for.
It isn't worth to wait
For another thousand years.

Take my hand, feel my heart.
Watching all those years go by.
In my own captivity,
Listen to my lonely prayers.
Suffering the pain inside.
Touched by the stars
And there shining light.

How to free my mind,
Free my soul.
Although I know...
How to free my soul,
Free my mind.
Although I'm never
Going to reach her.
