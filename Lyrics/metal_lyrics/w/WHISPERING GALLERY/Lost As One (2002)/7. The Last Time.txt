I didn't realize,
Reality so dazed.
The world was in my head,
Spinning around in my body.
Heating up my soul,
Feeling the warmth of your body.
But unaware,
It was the last time.

Devastating silence,
A serene chaos.
It's hard to accept,
I feel the pain.
Your presence,

Though not physical.
Is still here,
'cause I can feel it in the air.

So now I realize,
Reality was dazed.
You were in my head,
We were body to body.

Feeling the warmth of your presence,
And knowing there won't be...
A last time...
And now I realize,
Reality was dazed.
The world was in my head,
Spinning around in my body.
Heating up my soul,
And feeling the warmth of your body.
But now aware,
It was the last time.
