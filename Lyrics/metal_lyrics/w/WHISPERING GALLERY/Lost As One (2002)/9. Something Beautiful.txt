I want to escape in the night.
Disappear into the echo
Of darkness.
Howl with the wolves
For the loss of something untouchable.
With only one answer...
The silence of the night.
Oh... let me scream.
Let me feel my pain.
Let me cry all night.
My tears will feed the earth
So something beautiful...
Something beautiful may grow.
