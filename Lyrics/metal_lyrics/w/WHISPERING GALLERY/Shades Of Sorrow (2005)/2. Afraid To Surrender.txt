[Lyrics by Pascal Spierings]

Freeze me with this pain of a dying soul.
Let me fall into your arms to see myself wither away.

In a lengthening of time.
I'm carried away to the portals of the fallen.
Where only I can pray.

Why be afraid to surrender to your faith.
The sorrow and the grief are filled with pain and tears.

There were my blinded eyes can see.
and my lifeless heart can feel.

I'm there where my heart stopped bleeding and my wounds are healing.
I'm there where death conquers my empty soul and leave me all alone.

Why be afraid to surrender to your faith.
The sorrow and the grief are filled with pain and tears.
