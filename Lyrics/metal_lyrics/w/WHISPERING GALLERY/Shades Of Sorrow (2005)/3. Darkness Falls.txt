[Lyrics by Hubert Termeulen]

I'm gonna tell a little story.
About a man who sold his soul.
All he wanted was some glory.
All he wanted was control.
He was fighting in this war.
Without pain, without remorse.
Yes, they all stood side by side.
In an everlasting night.

Left his heart behind,
darkness fills his mind.
Left his heart behind alone...
Left his heart behind,
darkness fills his mind.
Left his heart behind alone...

Will you keep him warm?
Will you calm the storm?
'Cause this night he seeks tenderness inside.
Can you make him strong?
Let him know that all along.
You'll be there by his side.

Watch my shadow as I turn around.
The enemy won't see...
Deep in the heart of foreign land.
Death comes along with me...

As I aim the darkness falls.
This night belongs to me...
Just a flash into the night.
A victim far away...

When I fall into the arms of encountering enemy troops.
I hope my soul can get away.
Or my thoughts for never free...

Will you keep him warm?
Will you calm the storm?
'Cause this night he seeks tenderness inside.
Can you make him strong?
Let him know that all along.
You'll be there by his side.
