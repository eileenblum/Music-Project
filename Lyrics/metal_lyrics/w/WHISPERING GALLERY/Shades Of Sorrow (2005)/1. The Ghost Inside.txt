[Lyrics by Reinier Vreeswijk and Hubert Termeulen]

I have seen my life,
relive it many times.
Still there was no hope of a point of contact.
Still hoping to regain my long lost memories.

Strange things happen somewhere hidden in my mind.
In the dark and out the reach of time.
Out of time...

I feel blind,
but maybe time will open up my eyes.
It sets me free, destroying my disguise.
My disguise...

I keep telling to myself,
forgive me for my sins.
And the silence spoke to me...
And an answer never came.
I keep asking for truth,
the truth behind my mask.
And an old man stared at me
and the silence remains the same.

Surrounding mountains I try to climb,
to catch a view of life.
So much deeper I will fall...
Into oblivion.
To treasure the words of love and hate,
I will never understand.
But no one ever taught me...
It leaves me beyond redemption.

I was never born to live,
who was the one who gave?
But no one gives an answer...
An answer to behold.
I keep searching for my death,
release me from this pain.
But my blood is still boiling.
In my cold and frozen hands.

Strange things happen somewhere hidden in mind.
In the dark and out the reach of time.
Out of time...

I feel blind,
but maybe time will open up my eyes.
It sets me free, destroying my disguise.
My disguise...
