[Lyrics by Hubert Termeulen and Reinier Vreeswijk]

The night is gone and they are tired.
But the taste of victory is strong.
Marching past those dreadful fires.
Longing for a peaceful home.
Where candles burn instead of men.
Burning for their fallen friends.
And children play with wooden swords.
Pretending to be one of them.

Streets are filled with hopeful wives.
Who all proudly raise their heads.
Are their loved ones still alive?
Or will they sleep in empty beds.
On pillows soaked with silent tears.
Full of dark but lucid dreams.
Now the time is almost there.
To see what's become of all their fears.

When I open up my eyes.
These Images reflect the darkened skies.
I try to hide insanity.
Still trapped inside this tragedy.
It's difficult to accept this new reality.
Start believing my own lies.

I want to believe...
So listen to your heart!
Is there something left... a sense of life?
There is still hope...
But where can it be found?
You must search your entire soul!
I shall try so hard...
There is still some good inside

In this world I really can't exist.
In the end there's nobody I've truly missed.
The shadow of my past, it conquers me.
I've chosen the easy path of war.

Don't you walk away from me!
It's the only way to be...
Think of the love we're giving you.
It feels so damn cold inside!
But all we give is warmth.
It burns my soul deep within!!!

My eyes are filled with hate.
The fear in their eyes will bring them to their fate.
No one will ever escape my pain.
I feel so much rage, blood and agony.
Killing all of them, it's like a monstrosity.
All of them will soon be mine.

It seems to be the fear is gone.
Somehow they let the past go free.
But it's the silence before the storm.
Because some wounds are deepening.
Leaving scars inside his mind.
Shades of red which turn him blind.
He feels the moment's almost there.
To leave humanity behind.

Although used to feel the pain. (I want to believe)
He's too scared to kill himself.
But the urge runs through his veins. (There's still hope)
He exists for no one else.
Hating men's mortality.
While he steps beyond the light. (For love!)
Everyone he used to love.
Now becomes his enemy...
