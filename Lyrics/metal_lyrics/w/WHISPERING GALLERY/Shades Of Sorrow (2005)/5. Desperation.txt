[Lyrics by Hubert ter Meulen]

Every night I'm scared.
Will tomorrow be the same as today?
In my dreams I don't care.
But when I'm awake.
My thoughts are always there.

I'm wandering again.
In a night without an end.
But there seems to be another day for me.

I have lived the past.
And I'm afraid to see it all again.
Distorted images move fast.
And blur my vision.
Like an old and loving friend.

I'm wandering again.
In a night without an end.
But there seems to be another day for me.

I'm searching for myself in everyone else.
Is there someone to show me the way?

I'm wandering again.
In a night without end.
But there seems to be another day for me...
