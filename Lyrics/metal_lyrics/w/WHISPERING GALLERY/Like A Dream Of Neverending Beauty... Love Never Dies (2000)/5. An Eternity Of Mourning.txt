A cold wind touches my soul...
As reality takes control.
It builds in my dream an emptiness.
It hides all my feelings of loneliness.
In this mist of dreams far away...
Lies ahead my future to stay.

Lost, like a ship on the sea,
It's so painful. Images, they come and go.
They let me know, that I miss you.
And my love is gone, and faded away.
My broken heart, turned into stone.

Now I'm lost,
Like a nightmare come true.
The thought of losing you.
Stops my heart from pounding out,
From pounding out your name.
And crash into my mind,
Like a hurricane.

Why have you forsaken me?
In my moment of hope, love... regret.
Am I to fall into the arms of infinity?
And cry myself asleep in the night.
Hold your body like a hollow dream.
Countdown the days of my life.

The sun will never shine again,
The deepest cold shall be my friend.
In this world of everlasting silence
I shall waste my days in endless pain.
You my friend left me alone.
My sleepless beauty, my unborn child.

Sleepless beauty, unborn child.

A cold wind touches my soul...
As reality takes control.
It builds in my dreams an emptiness.
It hides all my feelings of loneliness.
In this mist of dreams far away...
Lies ahead my future to stay.
