Here I stand like a statue.
I feel the blood run through my veins.

As I cry I can see you.
Reflected in my tears.
Though I am trying out to reach you.
But you're never coming near.

Like a shapeless silent statue,
I shall slowly disappear.
Because the darkness reaches out
And grabs me by the hands.
Hides me far away,
Just like a memory of decay.

As I cry I can see you.
Reflected in my tears.
Though I am trying to reach you.
But you're never coming near.

Let the darkness reaching out.
It grabs me by the hands.
It leads me far away.
Like a memory of decay.
Let the darkness reaches out.

Hold me tenderly, caress me.
My sweet night of loneliness.
"Make me your family"
Make me a part of this world.
"Make me your family"
I long for infinity.

Sing to me, comfort me,
Make me aware.
Lift me up, hold me close,
My fortress of the night.

Hold me tenderly, take care of me,
My sweet night of loneliness.
Sing to me, comfort me, make me
Aware of my senseless life and
Lift me up to immortality.

The earth starts to shiver
And the clouds starts to break.
Mountains lose their face in
This world of immortality.
