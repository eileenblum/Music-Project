A bridge in the mist
Leads my path through
This world.
Silence behold my darkest thoughts.
In a far distance a rainbow's shining.
A glance in the depth there's
Nothing in my sight.

As holy words speaks,
Giving me answers...
Of my prayers, I cannot fear.
Words of lies don't heal the pain...
Only the salvation of my soul
All the reasons of my comming home...
Are for those who left behind.

I can't see the heaven anymore.
All what's left is a shining light.
Clouds of darkness leaving me.
I'm heading straight down to earth.

I can feel myself again,
Without the hand of a mighty angel.
I'm pulling towards my destiny,
Entering the edge of earth...
