If Joane of Arc had a heart,
Would she give it as a gift.
To such as me, who longs to see,
How an angel ought to be.

She dreamed to give, her heart away,
Like an orphan on a wave.
She cared so much, she offered up,
Her body to the grave.

If Joane of Arc had a heart,
Would she give it as a gift.
To such as me, who longs to see,
How an angel ought to be.
