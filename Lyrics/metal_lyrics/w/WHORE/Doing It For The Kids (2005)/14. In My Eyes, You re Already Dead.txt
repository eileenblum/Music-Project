My Eyes are glaring at you
They're burning with a bloodlust
Craze your twitching expressions
Are giving your secrets away

As we sit and talk for hours
You plot before I can act but
The first time I saw you I was
Always ready for the attack

Your gonna wish that you got
To me first because as you sleep
I will slash your throat the blood
Will soak into the sheets as you
Awake gagging from your dreams
