Bend over and open up your ass
And feel the long arm of the law
My Crisco fists will go in you deep
Let's just hope that you don't bottom out
My fists slam in and out of your ass
Like being punched in the face
As your hips shudder in ecstasy
Your organs I'll rearrange
Double fisted exploring your intestines
You start to go into shock
Blood and shit pour out your ass
As I begin to pull your insides out
Convulsing, vomiting blood
The pain is too much for you to endure
And right now you're looking really sexy
And I think I am in love
