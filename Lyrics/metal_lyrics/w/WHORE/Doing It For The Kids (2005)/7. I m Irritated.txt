You there in bed weeping
Crying because I beat your ass
Well your a stupid bitch
You should've done what I said

I told you to shut the hell up
But you had to prove your point
Putting your finger in my face
Was your first goddamn mistake

Bam and it's all over
My fist slams into your face
But you had to try and fight back
Which only makes me more pissed
I grab your shirt and slam
Your head into the wall
Then I punch you in the face again
The blood pouring from your mouth

I said goddamn you look bad
Giving up? Is that all you have
I guess it's one of those days
Just another romantic night
Ah the baby is crying it must know
We are fighting you better shut
It up now I fuck it up too
