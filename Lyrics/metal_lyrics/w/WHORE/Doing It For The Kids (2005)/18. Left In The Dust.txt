Stabbed again and again my cock covered in your blood
Howmany times will this go on?
I'm beginning to wonder if I'll get caught

I'm sick of this crap but I feel so incomplete
And so the killings go on searching for what I am missing

And so I drive down some endless road
Leaving no trace of my victims
They are all just worthless whores
And daddys little girls won't be coming home

Is this my callingin life to be? A travelling man
Cruising them killing whoever crosses my path
No signs of stopping green light means go
And no end in sight just endless road
