You ugly bitch don't you look at me
Your face makes me want to puke
You'll probably look a lot better
After I get done beating on you

I have some questions for you
Why are you so goddamn disgusting?
Who in their right mind would even like you?
How can you even leave your house?

I'm suprised you can even function
Have a life outside your home
My dog is better looking than you
Maybe I should give you a bone

Goddamne you're ugly
