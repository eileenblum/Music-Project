I saw this girl at the bar she looked lonely and sad
I asked if she wanted a drink
Then she tells me she left her man

I saw her as my next victim the weak always easy prey
We played pool and had a drink
Then we left to back to my place

I stayed at a hotel downtown and it only one room
Big enough for the both of us and what I'm gonna do to you

Stripped killed then raped
You should've ignored me bitch now you are dead
After I left the maid came to clean the room
And found you lying under the bed
