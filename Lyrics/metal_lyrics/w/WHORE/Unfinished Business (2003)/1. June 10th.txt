You dead fucking whore/ you stink now more than when alive, but I remember strangling her/ looking into those dying eyes. What are you going to do defenseless fucking skank? All you can do is struggle and choke/ drop dead on the street.

I took your purse just like I took your life and now you're dead, and short changed. When they come to identify you, they'll need your fingerprints to know your face!

Lately when I walk around town/ I'm seeing pictures of you. Now that you're dead, everyone cares/ before they wouldn't help you.
