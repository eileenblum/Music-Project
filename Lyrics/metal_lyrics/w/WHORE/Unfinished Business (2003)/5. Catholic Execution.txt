Damned to forever burn in hell/ to walk endlessly among the dark/ to feel your flesh hooks separate/ the torment unleased upon your soul

Crucified to a barbed wire cross/ wrapped lovely razor wire. Where is your God to help you now?/ babbling your false prayers

Blood pours from your eyes
Your skin blisters and pops
Flesh runs off the bone
As the barbed wire burns red hot

I spit in the face of your God/as he hangs upon his cross
We rape the virgin Mary/and we shit into her mouth!
