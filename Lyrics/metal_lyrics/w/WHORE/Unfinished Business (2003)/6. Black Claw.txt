The black tree's a forbidden place where ancient evil awaits

A massacre took place there/ where those who were slaughtered were natives

Drums and chanting are sounding from underground
black claw's spirit will be reborn in human form

They dug up their artifacts and desecrated his graves
Only to then be killed by the Indian spirit they've enraged.
