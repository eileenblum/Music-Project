[Narrative:]
Survival depends on defiance of law
The rejection of sanitised, obstructive causes
Reversion to primitive, instinctive impulse
The thrill of the hunt, the encompassing rush

Those who deviate from common bounds
Must suffer the scorn of a nation enraged
And those who would inflict this barbaric transgression
Will face no reprisal removed from confession

Heed well this warning of due darkness told
Hear now this story of two darkened souls..

[Lyrics:]
This friendship bold, alliance strong
Upon this path we've strayed too long
The Autumn air bears nought but calm
Not mute despair, nor mild alarm

As dusk ensues, we walk still more
Retracing paths from days of yore
The bonds of brethren strengthened still
Beneath this weathered house on Hollow's Hill

Unaware of what abounds
Oblivious to what surrounds

Darkness collects, the cataract manifests
The son is overwhelmed, the Sun beaten back
Attacked by the blackest, immodest hate
Two souls unburdened by morality

Spite centered, ungendered spawn
Of Hell's merciless abyss
Grasped by fingers of strengthened ire
Forged Mephistophelian beings of dark desire
Dragged are they to the house above
Taken away from all that would brave this tumult

So here begins the end of Summer's light
The death of all
Glorification of the unholy, the night

The clasp of iron holds me tight
My throat contracts with gut-wrenching fright
Sick visions fill my head
Am I alive, or am I fucking dead?

Tight shackles brace my wrists
Flesh held, molested, binding unstitched
As dolls made and broken
We children of Goshen
Torn screaming from plenty
To pastures abhorrent and empty

If walls could talk, an endless horror told
These four boards of unknown ages old
This house removed from time and space
A loveless void God cannot penetrate
Still ever more sickening this torment becomes
More stitches removed as we slowly come undone
Exposing the moist innards of the prey

Together in life we shared a bond
Forever in death we suffer alone
Our bodies carved to the bone, unprotected
The warning of common sense here attested
These two kindred spirits, molested and ingested

Beneath an empty sky, a deed here done sublime
The Godless stars forever baring witness to our crime
Satisfied are we..

Satisfied are we.
