[M &amp; L: J. FredÃ©n]

Out in this world of hatred and sin
The young ones are supossed to live by thir fear
Th violent abuse, we've seen too much
Dead there he lies for beliefs and his race
When will we realize that it's time to stop?
Stop all the fighting and talk it all out
To learn our children what's wrong or what's right
Instead of teaching how to win in war

I'm not the same as you are
Respect me for the one that I am

[CHORUS]
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can not see them, who makes me feel bad
I know that I'm not God's prodigal child
Spread your eyes, open and understand

Into the world of future unreal
I hope it will be soon someday
A better place for you and for me
To rise our child's, it may take us a while
Is it a wish, or is it the truth?
Ask someone else, 'cause I don't have a clue
Now it's the time to make up your minds
The way of the world depends on your choice

I'm not the same as you are
Respect me for the one that I am

[CHORUS]

Understand...
Understand...

[CHORUS]
