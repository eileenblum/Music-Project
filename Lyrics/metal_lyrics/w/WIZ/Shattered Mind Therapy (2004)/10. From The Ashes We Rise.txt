[M: J. Weicht; L: F. Persson]

This is the end of a dream
This is the end as it seems

But somewhere deep within our minds
We've kept this golden dream alive
Forever

[CHORUS]
Ashes, from the ashes we rise
Thru' sadness we've been paying the price

Once, almost dead now reality
Now we are here, where we wanted to be

'Cause somewhere deep within our minds
We've kept this golden dream alive
Forever

[CHORUS]
