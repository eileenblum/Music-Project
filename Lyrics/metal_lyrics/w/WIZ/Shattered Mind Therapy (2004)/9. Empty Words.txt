[M &amp; L: J. Weicht]

A dream in the night
Wakes a voice from the past
Screaming my name
Burning my soul
Memories arise
And awakes my confusion
And as I fall
Wraps me in consciousness

For better of for worse
You told me you would be there fo me

The time is running
But frozen inside
Moments of a past
Trepped in my mind
Somehow, someway
On the crossroads of life
The story's been told
Over and over

'Til death will do us part
You told me you would be there for me

[CHORUS]
You're just a memory, a dream
Caught up inside
And you are just a love letter
Empty words on a note

[CHORUS]
