[M &amp; L: J. Weicht]

Child of Poseidon
An island of blessing
A city of silver and gold
Mountains and valleys
Paradise gardens
A kingdom of wealth and grace

Five walls in circles awaits intruders
Atlantians on a crusade of greed

The wealthy wants treasures
The wealthy wants power
The wealthy is blinded and more wants more
Over the ocean
Towards the Antique
Leaving a kingdom they're searching for

Five walls in circles awaits intruders
Atlantians on a crusade of greed

[CHORUS]
Atlantis is rising
Returning from the sea
Return of Atlantis
An untold history

Attacking the Antique
Child's of Olympus
Betraying the Gods brings punishment
The ground started trembling
The sea started raging
Dragging Atlantis to final rest

Five walls in circles awaits intruders
Atlantians on a crusade of greed

[CHORUS]

The legend lives on...
Guarding the one
Sunken and gone

Five walls in circles awaits intruders
Atlantians on a crusade of greed

[CHORUS]
