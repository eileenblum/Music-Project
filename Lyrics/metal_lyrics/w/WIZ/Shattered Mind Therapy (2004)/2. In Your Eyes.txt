[M &amp; L: J. Weicht]

Some day
Somewhere
Some how
You'll be there
Beside me
Friendly
You read me
I want you to see
Please won't you let me inside

Your eyes say more
Then thousand words
You precious one
Look at me
A million to one
That's what it will be
To find someone like us
Like you, like me
Please won't you let me inside

[CHORUS]
I see dreams
Inside your eyes
I see dreams
Hiding in disguise
I see dreams
Inside your eyes
Though you tell me lies

The wait in vain
The games we play
Those crystal eyes
Reflects your soul
Black diamonds
Theatre
So beautiful
Ans still we lie
Please won't you let me inside

[CHORUS]

You don't trust my eyes
Do you see your lies
You don't trust my eyes
They reflects your lies

[CHORUS]
