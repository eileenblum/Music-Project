[M &amp; L: J. Weicht]

I fly above my self
So cold and beautiful dead
I've crossed the point of no return
And now you understand

A life in misery
So full of sorrow and pain
I couldn't face it no more
I hope you'll always remember me

[CHORUS]
No pain, I'm free at last
In paradise, sun moon stars

Regret you were mean to me
And regret that you sat me free
Life depends on love
And I depend on you

[CHORUS]

I lived for you
There's nothing to say or to do
I cared for you
Then please realize that we're thru'
I love you
I no longer feel as you do
I can't live without you
But I can live without you

[CHORUS]

And now when I am gone
I live forever inside of you

And now when I am gone
I live forever inside of you
