[M: J. Weicht and F. Persson; L: J. Weicht]

See he wind blowing in the trees
The cold wind bites my chin, freezing breeze
Looking out my window every day
I'm tired and broken down, here I'll stay

'Cause I'm
Broken down
Landed hard
All alone along with my thoughts
Broken down
My conclusion
I'm hated, soon she forgets

Thru'my window same thing every day
People passing by, not a soul to stay
I feel so forgotten, no once calls
Depressed and down I am, my spirit falls

'Cause I'm
Broken down
Landed hard
All alone along with my thoughts
Broken down
My conclusion
I'm hated, soon she forgets

[CHORUS]
Why do I let my self fall down?
Why do I let my princess wear her crown?
I kneel and bow my head, she brings me down

I'm a prisioner in my own broken soul
In my life I've always had a goal
To live beside my princess every day
She made me falling down by going away

'Cause I'm
Broken down
Landed hard
All alone along with my thoughts
Broken down
My conclusion
I'm hated, soon she forgets

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
