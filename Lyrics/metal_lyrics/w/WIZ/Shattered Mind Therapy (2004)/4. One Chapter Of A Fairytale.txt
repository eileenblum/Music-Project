[M &amp; L: J. Weicht]

Day by day as the years goes by
Same shit different day, every time
In middle of nowhere, in middle of all
In middle of nothingness I stand tall

Lonely can be strong

I hear a woman's voice echo in my mind
Daydreams, nightmares and visions of you
Blinding moment hurts my eyes
Stumbling in darkness as time goes by

Lonely can be strong

[CHORUS]
Time to try your wings
Spread them in the wind
And ride on the winds of change
How many days?
How many dreams?
One chapter of a fairytale

Shades of night fall upon the ground
Shining star, shadows start to rise
Dreaming, thinking for to long
Crossroads to nowhere will lead me home

Lonely can be strong

[CHORUS]

Now the time has come
To say goodbye

[CHORUS]
