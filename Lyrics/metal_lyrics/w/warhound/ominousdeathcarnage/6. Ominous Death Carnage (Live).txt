Centuries have passed
I've waited too long
In this pit of fire
Now my curse is gone

I shall rise
From the depth of Naraka
I'll terrorize
The future from the past

Tempest torment
Souls condemned
As the remnant of thousand years of war

Infernal bloodline
Rise of the wicked mastermind
Enter my realm
Defy the divine

For I am the desecrator of human race
I am carnage, the ominous death

Legions of fire
Blessed with the darkest desire
Emerging from the chasm of earth
To discharge the enslaved humanity

My shadow force
Commence the final attack
Kneel not before the throne of lies

Infernal bloodline
Rise of the wicked mastermind
Enter my realm
Defy the divine

For I am the desecrator of human race
I am carnage, the ominous death
