[Inspired by the scattered scriptures of the ancient Kingdom of Gangariday. In the first century AD, Alexander conquered much of north and west part of India. But he was bound to stop at the riverbank of Ganga because his soldiers denied his order to cross the river for they were terrified hearing about the unified army and fierce weaponry of Gangariday. This mighty realm of antiquity later became Gaura then Banga and much later Bengal.]

Watchful night stalks the lone spirit
That wanders through the wilderness of the deepest east

Rivierine tribes are ready to fight with the piercing armament
Under the darkening light none shall pass the gaze of the sentinel

Across the waterway
Enemy awaits
To intrude,to manipulate our savage race!

Unite our fierce force
Unleash them unto the Aryan hordes

Drive them off the shore
Into the tortorous core
Let the blazing flame ignite them

The overlord of the riparian lands possess four thousand war mastodonts
Spearhead on the colossal tusker rides forth to devastate

Over the encroaching tide
Slavonic soldiers awaits
Frightened to confront their concealed fate

Unite our fierce force
Unleash them unto the Aryan hordes

Drive them off the shore
Into the tortorous core
Let the blackening flame devour them

Fucking torn them apart
Crush their eccentric skulls

Retreating legions of the west
Skeptical their shaken faith
Incinerate them intrusive infidels
