[Based on the Bengal invasion of infamous Turk slave general Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji in 1206 AD.]

Axies of the faith
Master of the slaves

I was denied,defied
My vision shattered for your purblind mind

But I have foreseen
The conquest of eastern lands

Where wisdom dwells,monks meditates
They seek salvation through spiritual transcendence

I must lead the way to subjugate the realm of sages
Only few rode with me to crush the sacred sect

Seeing their death in blood and flesh
The seekers of knowledge couldn't comprehend
The bold yet barbaric desolation of their beloved Nalanda

Prodigious sphere of age-old wisdom burned down to ashes
Now I shall usurp the flourishing kingdoms of Banga
The decrepit swayer of Gaura shan't withstand
The strike of ruthless Ironborn

I am the unremitting force of rupturing iron and steel
My sword athirst for blood of the inglorecreant king

Spreading dread with their slashing blades
Ironclads breed bloodshed
Sena's fled leaving the throne for trade
Scarpered from their forthcoming death
