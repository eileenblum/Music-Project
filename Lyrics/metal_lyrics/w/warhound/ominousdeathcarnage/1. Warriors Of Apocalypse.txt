Amid the mortal wreckage
Emerge the ancient ones
Brings neither peace nor salvation
Survives to protect the primal law

Four horsemen will ride forth to restore the balance

Riders of immense power
Shall ride across the deepest depths of hell to enforce
The will of Charred Council

Strife of mortal race
Fury shall prevail
Death of depraved divines
War will desecrate

The seals have been broken
Summon the apocalyptic warriors
