They came from ten thousand feet,
on a possibility street
It was the law of the land,
turned castles into the sand
When it's only kingdoms a turning,
when I've got to find out some learning
Even the people so small,
wanna see the tyrant a fall, oh yeah
You could be, what you see, anytime, this time
Could it be, what you see, you could be, in time
Your love, my love, our love, in time
Your love, my love, our love, in time
It was the law of the land,
turned castles into the sand
Somehow the machine prevailed,
another tyrant's tale
It's only kingdoms a turning,
watching the factories burning
Even the mountain so tall,
will see the tyrant fall, oh yeah
Anytime, you could see, what you be, in time
Could it be, everything, that you see, is fine
Your love, my love, our love, in time
Your love, my love, our love, yeah in time
Take, the time, to see, the other things in life
Are all around, you never get the time
To see, all this, about me anyway
Your love, my love, will stand in time always
