You wanted love, you wanted love but it's not what she was thinking of.
You step to the left, you step to the left on your dancing feet now.
Dancing feet, I can't compete now with your dancing feet now.
Somebody gotta try and get to know now
Somebody gotta try to say it's alright now
Say it's all right now.
Dancing feet, I can't compete now with your dancing feet now.
Some people stare, they can't compare, when you're not over here you're there.
You see Coco, she say "oh no", another boy would like to know
Somebody gotta try and get to know now
Somebody gotta try to say it's alright now
That it's all right now.
She's got the white feather,
To get you through the night.
She got the white feather,
To make you feel alright.
Dancing feet.
Somebody gotta try and get to know now
Somebody gotta try to say it's alright now
That it's all right now.
