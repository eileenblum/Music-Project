Would you like to walk into the kingdoms of the sun?
We could walk into the fields to see where it begun,
She could be the answer to your everything,
She could take you anywhere that you have never been.
Staggered along,
Into the crowd,
Could not be define,
She's sitting down,
Beneath the crowd,
Drinking her wine.
And all along,
The answer to everything,
And all along,
It's another way out,
I'm only looking for a way out,
They're only looking for the way out.
Would you like to walk into the kingdoms of the sun?
We could walk into the fields to see where it begun,
She could be the answer to your everything,
She could take you anywhere that you have never been, oh.
Staggered along,
Into the crowd,
Could not define,
She's sitting down,
Beneath the crowd,
Drinking her wine.
And all along,
It's another way out,
And all along,
It's another way out,
They're only looking for the way out,
They're only looking for the way out.
Would you like to go into the kingdoms of the sun?
