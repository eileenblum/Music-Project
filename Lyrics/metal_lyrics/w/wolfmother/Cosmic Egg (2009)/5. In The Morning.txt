When you wake up in the morning and look into her eyes
And everything you're dreaming of is far beyond the skies
I believe we're going on into the open void
Far across the sky, never wondering why
Oh, my little girl
Look into the other side, you'll find the time
Everybody's got a story, everybody's got their own
Do you feel any better when you find you're not alone?
As you lay on down and look into the sun
And you see somebody that reminds you, of where you're coming from
Oh, my little girl
Look into the other side and you'll find you've begun
Never have I felt like this before though sometimes well I've seen an opening door
Just like a stone, until its thrown, listen to the tone where the truth can make itself known
Said the sun to the mountainside
You will never find out 'til you try
All their words cut like a knife
You're gonna have to stand up sometime
Wondering how did it all ever turn out this way?
Even those who stand so tall can no longer say
Anytime you've fallen down, anytime you're far away
May you never need to justify, everybody's got their own way
Look into the other side and you'll find you've begun
Never have I felt like this before though sometimes well I've seen an opening door
And everywhere you look, when you look into the book
Well I can't believe that you've never been here before
Said the sun to the mountainside
You will never find out 'til you try
And all their words cut like a knife
You're gonna have to stand up sometime
