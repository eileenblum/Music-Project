Illumination inside of you
Simplicity is in all we do
Like a landslide falling beneath you
Look to the future is all we can do
Like a phoenix rising in the sky
We will run into the morning light
Highly recommended by someone
With an inclination to enjoy
Misinterpret such a simple life
With one eye to satisfy
Like a phoenix rising in the sky
We will run into the morning light
Like a phoenix rising in the sky
We will run into the morning light
Like a phoenix rising in the sky
We will run into the morning light
