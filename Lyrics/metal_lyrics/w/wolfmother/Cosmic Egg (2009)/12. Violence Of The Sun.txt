Look into the sky
Never wondered why
The violence of the sun
See all the little games of
Think they all fall apart
What they have become
Could you see another way? I don't need to say
Well I've seen another way and I need to explain
Look into her eyes
See it's a coloured sky
What we have become
All the little children
Playing the game of life
The violence of the sun
Well I've seen your other way out of everything I say
Well I've seen another way when I look into your eyes I see your heart
May you never believe me
Well I woke up and tried to see me
Well you gotta know, what you gonna say
