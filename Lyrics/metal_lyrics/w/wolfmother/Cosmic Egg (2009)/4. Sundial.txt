In time, you will find, many things found in the ordinary
Could it be, what you see, many things are extraordinary
Every time when I look at you, well I seem to find another thing behind the story
Every time when I look at you, well I seem to find another dream behind the glory
And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders
How could you see nothing at all?
The sundial wonders on
Took a walk, in the park, walking all around in the after wall
Sometimes, keep it light, to take away all your love and power
Every time when I look into, well I seem to find another scene behind the story
Every time when she looks into, well I seem to find another dream behind the glory
And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders
How could you see nothing at all?
The sundial wonders on
And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders on
