Have you been to the carnival
I would like to see you
Theres a whole lot of people there
Who would like to be you
With the white unicorn, across her shoulder
Makes you think that she might of been
Someone who's older, ah yeah

And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpents vine
Now we live in another time
We could live together

She lives on the borderline,
That they call hazel
And the tent that she lives in has the name of her lover,
As she lays down to rest, she dreamt of another
Of a time when she once had

And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpents vine
Now we live in another time

Sister can you tell me when the day turns to night
She left without a word and wondered inside
How many day's must I still wonder why
And see her face in every passer by

We could live together

And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the vine
That we drank from the serpents vine
Now we live in another time

We could live together
