Can you see it's full of lightning,
All the futures that I see are whitening,
See the time of yesterday,
Become the time that we have today,

Oh I'm looking for a hidden meaning,
Can you tell me if it's just a feeling,
See the light is shining in your eye's,
Is it love in disguise,

I saw the light shine out today,
I saw the light shine out today,
And it told me that you're not the one for me,

Can you hear the ancient calling,
See the empires we've built are falling,
All we have is the human touch,
The clock is ticking even as we rush
