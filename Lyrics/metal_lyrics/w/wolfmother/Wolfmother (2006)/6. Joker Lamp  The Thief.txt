I said the joker is a wanted man,
He makes his way all across the land,
See him sifting through the sand,

So I'll tell you all the story,
About the joker and the thief of the night,

Always laughing in the midst of power,
Always living in the final hour,
There is always sweet in the sour,

We are not goin' home,

Can you see the joker flying over,
As she's standing in the field of clover,
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away?

What you see well you might not know,
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow,
The vagabond is moving slow,

So I'll tell you all the story,
'bout the joker and the thief of the night,

All the people that he see in the night,
Hold their dreams up to the light,
The old beast is searching for sight,

We are not goin' home,

Can you see the joker flying over,
As she's standing in the field of clover,
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away?

Tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
Of the night
