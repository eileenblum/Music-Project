I fell down in the desert baby
I had nothing but a piece of a paper, yeah!
I had to write something down
And I found myself alone
But then I let go of everything
Into another dimension

I didn't crash on the hill tonight
I got a feelin' everythings gonna be alright
Then a horse came runnin' to me
Said were gonna go to the sanctuary
Then I stop again to blow
Into another dimension

Purple hazes in the sky
See the angels with an eye
All these things we must try
'Till we see the reasons why

I fell down in the desert baby, yeah!
I had nothing but a piece of paper
I had to write something down
Then I found myself alone
But then I let go of everything
Into another dimension
