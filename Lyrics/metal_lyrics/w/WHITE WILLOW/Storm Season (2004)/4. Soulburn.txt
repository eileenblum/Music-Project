Looking for a way out, for a stirring in my soul
Trying to remember things you told me long ago
So long have I waited for a riddle to unsolve
People call me crazy, they have left me in the cold

But I can't leave it all behind
No I can't leave it all behind
How can you leave it all behind?
Oh I have touched it with my mind
Oh can you touch it with your mind?
Oh can you touch it with your mind?

Frozen by the fire I have looked into the flame
Now my eyes are crystal that will melt if I forget
Cannot turn away now, cannot shield my blinded heart

For I have touched it with my soul
Yes I have touched it with my soul
Oh I have touched it with my soul
And I can never walk away
No can you leave what you have found
No I can never walk away
