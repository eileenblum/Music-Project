I feel the push of a stormfront, look to a darkening sky overhead
See as the first drop of water pierces electrified air
Turn back to the thunder that calls
Now the swallows fly low to the ground
She smiles in the dead of the night
And the lightning rides high on the storm

I see the black clouds in your eyes
Clouds in Eden, drowning paradise

Heaven has opened it's flood gates, rain has been pouring for days
Telephone lines are all dead
Sally, by candlelight, stares
She stares at the fire that burns, while the world is extinguished by gales
Sally, with a joyful despair, is the storm that has laid my heart bare

I see the dark love in her eyes
Eden's nightside, new paradise
