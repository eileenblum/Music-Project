The end of the night seems so long and hard to bear
And the blood upon my hand cannot be my own

Wait for the chance that has been given to you
Now leave this obstacle of fate

Walk across the field of light
Leaving no traces on it's ground
Dream tomorrow, come inside with us

For this second is now captured and frozen
In a secret place, hidden from the day

Time is everything
It stands it's strain
Feel the darkness drawing near

Breathe it's air
Like the rain that falls
Broken up yet frequently...

Just one last touch
As the curtain falls down

To halt the wheel in it's endless spinning
Hold twilight until dawn
To stop the stars in their skyward crossing
And the sun from growing cold
