Moor the houses, lay low all masts and poles
Shear down the trees, anchor your barks
Gather your children and pray that they will be there when dawn breaks
Sound all your warning bells, cry for the lost sailors at sea
They are the first who will know what a storm can be

You will remember me, you will remember me
I am the scar upon your soul

I am the voice that speaks, I am the voice that speaks
I am the silence that precedes

The turning, the end of everything
All you have loved, all you have built
All that you are will be taken away by me
Who loved you with ever rising force
I will not stop what I unleash
Mine is the fire that devours what it most desires

Lost on a raging sea, lost on a raging sea
I am the voice to lead your home
