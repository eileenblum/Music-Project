So glad we found you
Under the open sky you wind your way through the meadows
You are the road that will take us to in between day and dream

We hold the compass, you hold the promise of life yet unlived
We grow boulder, speeding along to discover an endless science
Road race with time

Will we feel the passion, will we feel the pain
Will we touch forever, in the other lane

Sally is smiling, time is a shower of light through her hair
Trey is flying, white knuckled hands on the steering wheel
I greet the sun, speaking it's language

Everything is still now, we have turned the key
And the race is run for Sally, Trey and me
