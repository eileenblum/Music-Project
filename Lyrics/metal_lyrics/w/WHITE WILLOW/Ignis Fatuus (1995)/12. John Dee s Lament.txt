It was twilight by the river I lay lazing with my love We were wondering and dreaming Of the starlit worlds above Where the crimson turns to purple And the purple turns to blue How we wished that we could dive into That strange unearthly hue

Distant moonwhispers and starsongs Dance like fireflies at night So dark and rich in melody So sad yet filled with light Where the blue comes out of purple Where the black succeeds the blue The air vibrates a wistful song I have not seen my love for long
