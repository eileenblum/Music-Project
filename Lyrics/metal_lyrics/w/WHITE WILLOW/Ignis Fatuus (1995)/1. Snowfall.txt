Frost in a churchyard, silent falls the snow Silent on gravestones cold, on stories old So softly spoken, whispers from below Heard by a searching ear

A mocking voice calls, calls from Limbo's gloom "In time the living die, the dead remain" The snow will cover living men and dead All in its pure white cloak
