Come dance with me through the mists of night To the dark and slumbering woodlands Where roam the nocturnal, spectral beasts Drawn by their master's calling

Black ivy climbs up the broken walls Where a castle once presided The glare of the stars through velvet sky Lends life to rotting ruins

Of dew and mold we shall spin a dream That will match a demon's fancy A whisper from ancient hollow stones Of fairy rings and phantoms

Keep close to me for the wind is still And the Lord of Night is calling A gift I have brought on New Moon's Eve Of innocence and pale skin
