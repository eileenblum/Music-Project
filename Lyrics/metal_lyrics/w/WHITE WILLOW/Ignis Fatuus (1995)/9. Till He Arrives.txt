When summer nights are warm and bright And fill the gardens with delight When morning still is out of sight Pale orchids glow with lunar light And you won't make a sound As I lead you all the way

When summer nights are warm and bright And fill the gardens with delight I wish you may I wish you might Reach out and touch that hollow fright Then I won't shed a tear As you lead me on your way

Well, summer nights are warm and bright And fill the gardens with delight But cold and dark are autumn nights And gardens pale with frosty white And you won't turn around As He leads you down that way
