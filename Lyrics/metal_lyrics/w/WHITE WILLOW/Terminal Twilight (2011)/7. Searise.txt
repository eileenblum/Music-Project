Tears on her pillow
Slumber is hard to resist
Sleep takes her by the hand
Opens another door
Time passes slowly
One day so much like the next
When did he say goodbye
When did the lights go out

She sees the laden sky
Wonders if he's alive
Oh since the waters rose
She has had no repose

Watches the branches
Weave in and out of the waves
She never thought she would
Live with an ocean view
Something approaching
Is it her brave sailor boy?
Heart beating faster now
No, just a drifting corpse

She sees the laden sky
Wonders if he's alive
Oh since the waters rose
She has had no repose

She is alone now
None but the vultures remain
Tuesday the last folks left
embarked from the roof of the downtown mall
Everything's sinking, or is the tide on the rise?
She has been thinking
Of rowing her boat to the western hills

Up where the land is dry
She'll find her peace up high
Ever since Edward left
She has felt so bereft
