Birds on a sandy bank
And the tides wash away
All the season's remains
Scents on the wind
Autumn is here
Red leaves on water
And mists rolling in

Here, at the water's edge
Where the undertow beckons
to shadowy depths
Here is where all
comes to an end
Time ticking slower
Colours that fade

Red leaves on the water
Time is ticking slower

No-one saw it coming
Like a shadow across the land
Will you stand here with me
Hold my hand and you will see
Brace for heavy landing
And the sky will come crashing down
And the stars will drown
Hold my hand and you'll see

Time here is running out
Not a wave on the sea
And the air frozen still
Sand on the wind
Stuck in mid-air
Sound is suspended
In infinite loop

Red leaves on the water
Time is ticking slower
No-one saw it coming
Like a shadow across the land
Will you stand here with me
Watch the very end with me
Brace for heavy landing
And the sky will come crashing down
And the stars fall all around
Let the end credits roll
