As I walked out into the woods one day
I saw the earth was awaiting
No leaves were moving and the beasts were still
I held my breath 'til I swayed

As I rowed out onto the sea one night
I heard the water lamenting
Not even ripples touched its deep blue skin
I listened long to its song

The drifting snow
That hides the violent sea
The drifting snow is me
The howling wind
That strips the forest bare

That howling wind is here
