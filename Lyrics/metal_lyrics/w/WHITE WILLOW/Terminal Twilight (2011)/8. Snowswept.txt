And the snow that falls tomorrow
Like a blanket pure and white
Will erase the thousand crossroads I have found
And the blindly staring scarecrow watching over his dead field
Will keep vigil over restless wolves at night

I will stay with him
In the snowswept din
And when I am cold
He will be my fire

They are calling it a white-out
All the experts on tv
"Snow is general from Waikiki to Qatar"

But they do not know what scarecrow
Whispered in my frozen ear
Here's a winter that the spring will not relieve

I will stay with him
In the snowswept din
And when I am cold
He will be my fire
