the guilts, the aches, the almost starts
the songs that break a million hearts
the slowly taking you apart
your mother's voice, your father's hands
the long abandoned teenage plans

those country boys just left you cold
the local girls, they acted old
your mother's lips, your father's eyes
you'll never hear your baby cry
