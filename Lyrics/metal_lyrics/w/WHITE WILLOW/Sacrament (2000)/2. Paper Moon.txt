A paper moon on fire Sheds ashes on the sea It's closer now than yesterday As close as it will never be

An hour left to dreaming Of moments lost in time And seconds of lucidity I thought would not abandon me

I have a faded picture Of joy in amber light As instant burnt away too soon Like visions of paper moon

Hold on paper moon You came, and left too soon
