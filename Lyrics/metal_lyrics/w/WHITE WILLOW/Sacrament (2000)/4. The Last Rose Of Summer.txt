She sits by the window Gazing at the frozen river Her hands clasped tight above her heart A tear runs down her cheek She starts to shiver

Memories that haunt her Summer nights that came and went Like winds that move the willow's leaves Today the last leaf fell The tree is bent

Once there was a springtime With flowers of the deepest blue And he came from the south-land Bearing gifts of love And hope so sweet

Now summer is long gone And gone those eyes of deepest blue And hope lies withered on the ground As will the last red rose Held to her breast
