I have seen Fields of green Dark skies glowing Rivers flowing And I have felt their yearning And I have known their secret

Nature's pain Falls like rain Feel her beauty Know her duty Mirror me Make me see Lead my longing To belonging I will remember skies I once knew And in the fullness all things anew

If silence is a word If heaven is a voice I once heard Tie me a ribbon of golden thread

If summer is a place Of twilight stars and shimmering haze Tie me a ribbon of golden thread

If sadness is a key To lullabies the wind sang for mee Tie me a ribbon of golden thread
