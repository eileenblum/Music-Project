Towers tall Stand before me As I leave the hall To heed this call

High above Roses climb As evening's hours die A distant cry

I must leave All behind Shed all those ties that bind My tethered mind

Darkened light I must take care Never shine to bright Stay out of sight

Once, on a windswept shore I stood alone Sensed that far cry Across the reach

Tool the bell For this sad world Was my prison cell A pleasant hell

End this pain End my time In this blind god's domain Of brutal claim

Fragrant night Give me shelter From these stars too bright And hide my flight
