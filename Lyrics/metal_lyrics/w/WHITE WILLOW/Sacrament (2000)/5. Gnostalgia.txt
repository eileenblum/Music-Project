Faintly as the shadows Of evening gently fall Across the fields and meadows A raven sounds its call

Carried by a current Of pain and memory Across the seas of slumber Its calling reaches me

And I must follow This voice of longing Past fields of sorrow And no tomorrow

Wrapped in shades of nightfall The stars will light my path Forever flying homewards On wings of broken song

And if their light should flicker The voice will carry on As echoes in a quiet land Where spirits may go strong

I lift the veil of ashes To find the road to heaven And in blindness find my sight I drink the silence of light

And when this cup is empty The sky will burts upon us And its waters wash away All but our sky-bound way
