dusk city where the light is wearing thin dull fire in an auburn sky

one fire casts a shadow where I stand one hour till my world falls down

nothing stands in my way nothing stands in my way to ruin but the city remains and the ghosts of the lost and lonely

silent strangers, wraiths of the neon glow souls so dim and pale I am drawn to where I can fade away here at twilight's end

dusk city where the river has no name where hours pass like centuries

rust lingers as it swallows up the day one fire it will burn you down

I won't stand in your way I won't stand in your way to ruin let me lead you astray follow me to the lost and lonely

silent strangers, wraiths of the neon glow souls so dim and pale I am drawn to where I can fade away here at twilight's end

snow of ashes, leaves of a shredded sun memories washed away no regrets now, never a safe return to what might have been
