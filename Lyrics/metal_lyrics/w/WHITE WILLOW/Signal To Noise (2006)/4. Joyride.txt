turn the brights up it's too dark to see the curves that lie ahead this is not a good idea

but i like it cause the roads are clear and no-one's out tonight we are all alone

driving through this wasteland atmospheric fluctuations change conditions nothing here is ever what it seems and the weather's getting strange

oh turn it up they're playing that song the signal is strong

oh tune it out the noise of the day is fading away

voices far or near whispers on the air spellbound by the dashboard lights

drive on, don't slow down we are westwards bound nowhere else that's left to go

can you feel it there is something here that makes the world recede sound and vision breaking up in a frequency drift

first the silence then the music of the night then you realize the beauty that the noise has blotted out

driving through this wasteland atmospheric fluctuations change conditions and reception here is crystal clear up the signal down the noise

oh turn it up that music they play is making you sway

oh keep it up you know we could stay for just one more day
