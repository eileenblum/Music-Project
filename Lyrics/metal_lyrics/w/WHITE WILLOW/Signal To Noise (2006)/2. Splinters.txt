Evie with her dark refrain contemplates the fall pictures on a faded page all that went before

distances and destinies separate us all seasons of forgetfulness wipe away our soul

and when the morning comes will you know what came to pass and when the morning comes how can you recall shards of a broken glass pieces scattered on the floor sharp pain reminds you of the sweetness of the wine

now the day is growing old shadows all around engine revs and taillights fade swallowed by the night

she is left without a clue visions fade in shades of blue whispers of a dying day evie turns and walks away

there are splinters scattered on the floor and inside her soul forever more and outside the trees are stripped and bare and the darkness gathers everywhere
