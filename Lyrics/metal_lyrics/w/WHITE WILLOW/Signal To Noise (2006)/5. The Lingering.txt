I feel your kiss on my warm lips I taste your lips on my tongue I touch your trembling hand I see the tear in your eye

the world lights up when you're near me the night comes down when you're gone a chill descends on my heart the thrilll of loving is gone

oh the smell of your passion like roses of blood haunts me, set me free the shattering pain of your absence remains with me let me be oh the smell of your passion like roses of blood haunts me, set me free the shattering pain of your absence remains with me let me be in your memory

kiss me lightly hold me tightly love me sweetly and completely

and every word that I whispered and every caress you gave the radiant light of your face the cryptic curve of your smile

oh every moment still lingers hard as I try to move on but truth cannot be undone my battle will never be won

oh the sun that drowned in a shimmering, burning sea set me free the tingling flesh of a body that yearns, I plea let me be oh the smell of your passion like roses of blood haunts me, set me free the shattering pain of your absence remains with me let me be in memory
