burn all the bridges let me feel the wind will you save my soul tonight follow the ashes no-one ever will can I hear you sing tonight

autumn is coming evenings growing cold and we still have far to go far goes the memory further than the road and the fields that lie beyond

and every word I have said, I have sung every fragment of meaning has gone but I turn around to the dust left behind where the threads of the rhyme come undone

you came a-knocking stranger at my door will you be my friend tonight turned down the lights and said my last goodbye and I left my house behind

and though the sky it was dark it was cold and the wind tore the rags off my back you came along and your cloak it was shelter for two who were lost in the storm
