black rain falls heavy on the ground dark water shadows crowd the sky and the raven flies as the light slowly dies but the lighthouse still stands where the earth meets the sky

and as the ships pass lit up with lanterns they fade in the distance like embers that die and in their wake trails the silence of absence that slowly will swallow the earth

follow me we will sink or swim dark water swallows everything sink with me to the ocean's floor please let me open up the door and the raven flies as the light slowly dies but the lighthouse still stands where the earth meets the sky
