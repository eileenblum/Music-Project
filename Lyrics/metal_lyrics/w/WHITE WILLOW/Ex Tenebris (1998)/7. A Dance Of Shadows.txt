I have seen a dance of shadows darker than the darkest night touched by madness I have swirled the pirouette of death

wakened by a black rose blooming in the frozen fields of sleep I have known such pain and pleasure ecstasy and fear

I have seen a strange procession mourners of the ice-kissed soul I have known and I have suffered at the hands of truth
