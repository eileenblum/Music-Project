Come and meet me by the river meet me down where the willows grow let us walk amidst the flowers with their colours all aglow let us watch the waters flow

and forget our fear and suffering and forget our throes of pain watch the clouds so softly gliding by with promise of light rain may we never part again

still the world keeps spinning round and round and the stars watch from the sky and they don't care if we live or die their angel's eyes are blind we were lost and never found

thus immersed in incognicity we must rise from the blackest deep and emerge above the waters freed of demiurgic sleep we shall soar where we once did creep
