Silence in Thanatos' hall whispers behind his great wall as dreams of atlantis, a call from afar soft words we can never recall

waking beneath this vast dome drawn by a voice that is home I glide like a shadow cross starlit terrain not knowing my nature or name

take me over the waters of Lethe bring me safely to shores of remembrance see as seeing recovers our dreaming dream as dreams may deliver our freedom

knowing what darkness must hide I draw you close to my side the river is close and a boatsman is there he speaks with a voice made of sand

leaving the silence behind tracing the paths of my mind the temples of Hypnos recede in the haze our eyes are ablaze like the sun
