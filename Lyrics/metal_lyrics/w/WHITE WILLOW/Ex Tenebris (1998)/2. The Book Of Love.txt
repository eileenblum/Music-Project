radiant pinpoints, they sting my hand I grab a fistful, a gift for the breeze who will carry them far and away with case

stars in my heaven, they turn and turn like holy fires they burn and burn and in their pattern my love is spelt like a sigil of grace in the womb of space

ever as time goes on and on and on these stars will burn forever ever as time grows heavy-headed, wan ever ever as life goes on and on and on my heart is yours forever ever as life grows tired and forlorn eve
