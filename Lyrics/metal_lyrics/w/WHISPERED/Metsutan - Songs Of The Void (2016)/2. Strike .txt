He stands in the form so total
Even gods are watching in awe
Essence of calm, pure concentration and
Perfect void of the mind
Everything from the years of training
Will array in a technique pure
Years dancing with steel, we'll see
What he has been living for...

Rise up - and see beyond the eyes
Rise up - and gain the focus which gives no room for ties

Sound hands holding the blade,
Eyes fixed to his grip inferior
Roar of the battle withers to silent clatter
Time slows down to motion
Where stir of the dust can be seen
One year, a second in this moment
Of bloody scene, and he moves...

With the swift pace unrivaled
Unseen by the aspirants' eyes and
He knows in his heart so unbridled
That he'll soon execute the flawless...

Strike!
Strike!
Strike! Through the laws earthly, break them!
Strike! With the power of a content mind

[Solo: Mikko, Jouni, Kai]

First the silence breaks yet time stands still
He flows through the air, through the adversary's form
Through enemy's frame

Perfect execution leaving in scorn halved shadow of a man
Startled confusion starting to breed in the midst of the horde, and he moves...

With the swift pace unrivaled
Unseen by the aspirants' eyes and
He knows in his heart so unbridled
That he'll soon execute the flawless...

Strike!
Strike!
Strike! Through the laws earthly, break them!
Strike! With the power of a content mind
