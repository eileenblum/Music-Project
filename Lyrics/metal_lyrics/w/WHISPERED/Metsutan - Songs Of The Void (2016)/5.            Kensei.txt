The call for a challenge heard
From dishonored, untried man
Now eyes closed in silence he waits
For the moment to reign bringing rival to shame
Young yet fire-hearted and ready to sacrifice all
Through challenges built on his path
He'll never give in for the sickness of wrath

His destiny shall be aflame through honors affair

The feat which begins now
Shall echo in all coming times
Scriptures for the art of Ken
Teachings of heart, life's true reward
Hidden in a gust of wind
Is the truth that makes us see
We aren't here to glorify our being
We're here out of mercy to be

Alive!

By the scars of battles fought for years
He still recalls the fight
The fight that banished his fear to die

Immortal fable shall be born
The true aspect for a sword
Youth conceded for a path
Which shall take all and everything he's ever had

Dedication â life sacrificed to a cause
Damnation â awaits those who cross his laws

[Solo: Jouni, Mikko]

Ken-sei!

By the scars of battles fought for years
He still recalls the fight
The fight that banished his fear to die
Every moment in his life has lead to this
The true revelation of it all
As he writes down the thesis of how to never fall

Enshrined views of the adept
Will forever inspire them all
Yet death has claimed his body
His spirit has been reborn!
