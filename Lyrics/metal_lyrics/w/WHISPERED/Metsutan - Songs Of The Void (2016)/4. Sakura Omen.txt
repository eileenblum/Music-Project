There is an ill wind
Howling through walls
Voices grim calling my name,
Inception of sorrow and hate

Darkness is claiming
The rays of the sun
By closing my eyes I realize,
I can't recognize what I've become

Bushido's bearing
Nothing but words
Shadows of shame draw me,
Imposter, a traitor of blade

The depths of the bleak mist
The realm of the void

I heard Izanami's voice hollow luring,
But I won't follow

Silently the rivers stay still,
Nor light or dark emerges from the nothingness
Silently my sword aims for the kill
Dancing like a petal in storm, cutting through blight

Sakura slowly fall from the sky glowing faint, dark light

Stillness is gained only through the absence of dread
Fear of death is nothing but an obstacle for a perfect strike

My mind is trying to keep me sane, I'll run away
My heart is bound to meet my fate, dying through my foes diving blade

If one only studies the strategy of war, one only becomes a mere student of war
By knowing the shallow, the deep, the small is the only way to evade the fall

Sacred words of will and dare now fade away
The meaning for my path is vague and in my rage
I'll take the trail to my disgrace to run and hide
But my soul is bound to see the end to fall and die

Silently the rivers stay still,
Nor light or dark emerges from the nothingness
Silently my sword aims for the kill,
Dancing like a petal in storm yet, now crushed to shards
Sakura slowly fall from the sky glowing blood-red light

Izanami revealed
Her face torn and lurid
Depths revealing under, all oaths broken
Burnt blossoms on the ground,
I should've seen the true Sakura omen

Horizon with these abnormal sights,
Disfigured beings screaming gods
Yet I embrace my fate, my downfall
For the battle of mind and flesh is now gone

Redemption is done.
