Canvas painted with blood
Images of tainted mortals
Inspiration bizarre
thrives in misery

I've killed my creations
with savage executions
I've given birth to death
with the brush as a vessel of pain

Representations of violence
follow the loss of innocence

Havoc enclosing the cities
violent notions in motion
These times shall be produced
in my murders with a verse

I've seen my creations
reach the floating world
These days provoke to create
but new insight just blinds the way

The ways of late will take control,
prestige of the craft will lose its soul

Gods! Please witness this offense by men!
Slaying of genuine expression begins

Exiled - by false refinement crushing the worth of art
Exiled - by times renewal means to kill the old
Insanity still grows within

No-one can see what I can
I dance under the moon cursing the sun

[Solo: Jouni, Mikko]

Respect for my conception is gone,
deficient approach to all that is done
I'm drifting away from reality,
Aspects of the moon - total vanity

Gods! Please witness this offense by men!
Slaying of genuine expression begins

Exiled - by false refinement crushing the worth of art
Exiled - by times renewal means to kill the old
I've fallen from the floating world
