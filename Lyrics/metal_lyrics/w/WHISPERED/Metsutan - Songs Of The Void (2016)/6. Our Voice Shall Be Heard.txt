Inhuman greed over worthless gain
Spiteful aim to reign over hallowed
Despite the signs so clear of the godless bane
And the forthcoming outcome of deprivation

They'll shiver as their reverence grows thin
They'll hear our screams when they sleep
As the last home of ours is destroyed
We'll haul their lands to the yomi's void

Kutabare, kiero!

Echoes haunt the shrines in the vale
As greed overcomes the sense of faith
Hands ruled by craving overblown
Commence to raze our sacred stone

Now we breed in the corners of the night
Inside the walls and in their mind.
"Our being glares from all things true
From lanterns and kettles to shadows and rooms..."

Their blood will soak the hallow ground
This is our voice, it shall be heard
When the night turns to cavort of chaos and gore
Spirits shall curse this land forevermore

[Solo: Mikko]

Shattered to the ground our abode
The last hearth of life, now burning with rage
Oh, how Otoroshi cries, duty eternal destroyed
Never shall man roam this land for we are their deaths convoy

Their blood will soak the hallow ground
This is our voice, it shall be heard
When the night turns to cavort of chaos and gore
Spirits shall curse this land forevermore

Kutabare, kiero!
Shinitamae, kiero!
Kutabare, kiero!
Konoyo wo deteyuke!

Our voice shall be heard!
