Years obliging code of a tyrant
Whose honor and worth grows grim
All weak to counter verdicts so blatant
Innocent blood wasted to the ground
I've seen thousands
Follow his orders corrupt
I've served the demon as his right hand
And my time as a mere puppet is gone

The spirits of the buried
Please witness this forthcoming deed
Tonight my blood shall reveal the lost way
No longer shall I obey
Even though I might die in vain...

Shadows form the gathering of deceased
As the stage for the deed is set
Life given to build a novel heart
For a man who has lost his own... so long ago

As the last branch of autumn grows barren
He is enclosed by the shades of the fallen...

To see this moment of sincere atonement
Banquet of Yurei are dancing here tonight

[Solo: Mikko, Jouni, Mikko, Jouni, Jouni, Mikko]

Silence surrounding the outskirts
Eyes of the wraiths staring from the dark
Kneeling and facing this twilight,
I'll use my blade for the last time

The spirits of the deceased
Please witness this forthcoming deed
Tonight my blood shall reveal the lost way
And save his soul from astray
Even though I might die in vain...

Shadows draw the gathering of deceased
As my shaking hands guide my sword towards me
Life given to mend a broken heart
For a man who has lost his own so long ago

Fifty years migration of disgrace
Oh how I hope my demise will bring some peace
In the heart so bitter and so cold
I know this day won't ensure the change
But I fathom my story shall be told

Please repent...
