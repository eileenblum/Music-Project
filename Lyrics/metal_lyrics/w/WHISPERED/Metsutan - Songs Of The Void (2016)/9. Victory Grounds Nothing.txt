The breeze wipes the fields and trees and sings
For the fallen and those who keep on returning to battlings
One cup of tea, the deer scarer's silent note
Harmony within withdraws the restless soul

Riding till the ancestors holler from far beyond
These years turn to days with the buoyant dawn
Enlightenment gained by the strain resonates back
To everything that mind discerns, nothing stays back

Follow!
Conceive!

The art of life, art of ken

Sensou!
Heiwa!

Serenity: one and all

Age of strife has finally turned away
Fear so strong and sound fades to bliss of the day
Bloodstains on the sword will scene the tale
Manifold test of might, honor, verdict and pain

Subete ga owaru

Age of strife has finally turned away
Fear so strong and sound fades to bliss of the day
Bloodstains on the sword will scene the tale
Manifold test of might, honor, verdict and pain
