"Eye for an eye" said the old man
For mankind's sake has he cried

Wisdom of what to become had been
blessed into his mind

Me myself I'm sick of trying
to help this land evil to the core
For now I'll be an observer
I'll say a prayer, nothing more

Wrath of Heaven sets, the world is cursed
by all the answers written by man (it's all in vain)

I despise the question of 
"why, what we have done to earn this
All that's forgotten has returned as the 
Wrath Of Heaven

[Solo: Mika]

Yes the Wrath of Heaven sets, the world is cursed
by all the answers written by man (it's all in vain)

I'm gazed by them now, it is me they want to blame
But they don't see in my heart's concealed something
They'll never take away

I don't fear anything anymore,
I know, I'm just a sculpture made of glass
I've reached my end and lived as I am until this day
We stand on the edge of the world now, prepared to fly to eternity
I know by the wisdom of all, there's no death for us by the Wrath of Heaven
by tIt stands besides us til' the end
