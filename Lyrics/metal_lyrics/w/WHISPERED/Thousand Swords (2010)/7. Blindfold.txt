Welcome to my realm, twisted but real where no one can see
Where cold gets stronger, grows everyday it flows through thee

Eyes all around you not watching a thing, blindfolded by lies

No word can be said, they hear but themselves
My silence keeps them alive

Not a word that you hear them say will ever be true
Like a blade it pierces and makes you blinded too

They follow their path having no sight
Their steps guided by blind

Don't want to hear it spoken out loud
That their lifes are filled with lies
Helpless I stand here, day after day, trying to stay sane
I don't feel the hatred, neither the grief, but I live in their pain.

Not a word that you hear them say will ever be true
Like a blade it pierces and makes you blinded too

They say that nothing good will last, yet they're living like everyone
How can one lie in such way and kill all dignity?

They say that nothing good will last, yet they're living like everyone
How can one lie in such way, if they live for dying?

[Solo: Mika, Jouni]

They say that nothing good will last, yet they're living like everyone
How can one lie in such way and kill all dignity?

They say that nothing good will last, yet they're living like everyone
How can one lie in such way and kill all honor?

Oh, lie in such way -
Wearing blindfold
