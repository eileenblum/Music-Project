Wretched is the empire inside out, wretched the people within
Soulless searching, sky's fading , hope's gone into hiding

No one wants to see what's to come
The rising chaos even now on every single one

This is the final curtain call 
Final chance to rise, to stand to forge an iron heart

No, for my will never changes
In this life, I won't die , I won't dear to walk through night

Face all and everything trying to weaken me
I'm conscience bound, to stand my ground, shout it out
Fear never within. No never within.

Trees wither, green turns gray, darkness only left to hoard
Bravery lost, weak mind guides hands too weak to even grab a shield or sword

Once called men, these wrecks deserve no word to be wasted on
Sad I feel , riding through the plains, even stars lose their shine one by one

Right!

I do want to see what's to come
I'm not afraid to see the chaos in every single one

[Solo: Mika, Pepe, Jouni, Mika]

No, for my will never changes
In this life, I won't die, I won't fear to walk through night

Face all and everything trying to weaken me
I'm conscience bound, to stand my ground, shout it out
Fear never within.

No, no, no, no, no fear!
