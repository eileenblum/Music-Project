Demon to others, angel to no one
those seen him for real haven't lived to tell
Lives by the sword, bathes in blood, seeks for trouble
It's said "face him, hear your funeral bell"
Born after 18 moons,
stained with dishonor
Evil from birth, cast away by his parents,
Oniwaka - The Devil's Child
"Enemies shiver and flee,
though he faces armies alone"
Death through this deformed figure
"Ruins he leaves behind him, chaos he sees
to come"
Seeking one to set him free
"One by one even those calling
him a companion disappear"
Going on until defeat
"Alone, he stands, daring to challenge even
the gods themselves"
The blood of his own
solely smothers the flames that burn within
Year after year saw him trying
to satisfy sword's endless hunger
Wall of blades surrounds him,
one for every fallen victim
With each won sword he whispers
"Is there no one worth the wait?
Deaths countless showing proof to me
But ten by ten by ten I want to see."
Years he stood still (a tale of 1000 swords)
Waiting for someone to lift the weight away
The last blade sacred (a tale of 1000 swords)
to define if he's a master or a servant
Years he stood still (a tale of 1000 swords)
Waiting for someone to lift the weight away
The last blade sacred (a tale of 1000 swords)
to show if he's to walk above gods or beneath man

"Nightfall sets, stars revealed -
a pale shadow on the treeline
reveals nothing about it's master.
A blade on his side, a smile in his eyes
as he approaches the wall of steel.
All grows silent, time stands still
as it was foretold by the sakura's omen"

Years he stood still (a tale of 1000 swords)
Waiting for someone to lift the weight away
The last blade sacred (a tale of 1000 swords)
to define if he's a master or a servant
Years he stood still (a tale of 1000 swords)
waiting for someone to take the burden away
The last blade sacred (a tale of 1000 swords)
to show if he's to walk above gods
The last blade sacred (a tale of 1000 swords)
to show if this path sets him free
