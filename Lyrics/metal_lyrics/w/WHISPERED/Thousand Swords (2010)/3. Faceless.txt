I've lost myself, can't find but wrath inside
So bitter, to everyone and every single thing in life

I'm all eyes - searching something to be hated even more
I cry a river red, hope the'll all be pulled down they drown and

I'll haunt their dreams imbued with vanity
Honor, I'll show them. Respect, by slaying them all 
Carrying their the mark of cursed forevermore
My touch , made of pai, made of thorns and nails to tear you down

For I cannot change my fate I scream
Let soul go on ahead

For I cannot change it all
Please just set me free

Slave of his own, will bound to hate
Madness creates bittersweet, fading, darkening harmony
Demigod, false truth, scale balanced be within
Breeding my wrath even more... and

Oh, how I find myself again
Together standing there, still all alone

Oh, how I hate myself again
Falling once more with the tide, it makes me blind and

Still I see, how I fool myself again
Whisper out the words to hold it down

Oh, how I praise myself again
Pierces through the skin but still I seem faceless

For I cannot change my fate I scream
Release the flames inside

For I cannot change it all
Please set them free

For I can not just stay down
No way I could set it aside
For I crush you be set free
Though I'll die, freedom never will

Oh, how I find myself again
Together standing there, still all alone

Oh, how I hate myself again
Falling once more with the tide, it makes me blind and still I see

...fool myself again
Whisper out the words to hold it down
Oooh, how I praise myself again
Pierces through the skin but still it burns

Now, forced to see reality
Under this skin dwells a human heart

Oh, still this pain remains the same
Pierces through the skin but still I seem faceless
