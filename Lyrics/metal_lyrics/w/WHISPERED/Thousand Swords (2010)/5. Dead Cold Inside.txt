Tired from the war is the warrior's heart
The wind keeps still, it whispers words somewhere far

This moment brings tears into his tormented eyes
Memories of home, the reason why he joined the fight

Winter has been winning this battle since it's first day
Fear's already friend, it keeps me raising up my blade

All this time I've fought for everything that has meaning
I've had my share of grief, so many deaths I'm forced to see

In my heart I've sheltered everything I need
To walk through this blood rain, even if it's me who bleeds

No wasted years behind - this war could never be over
Being still alive makes me feel dead cold inside

In my heart I've sheltered everything I need
To walk through this blood rain, even if it's me who bleeds

No wasted years behind - this war could never be over
Being still alive makes me feel dead cold inside

In my heart I've sheltered everything I need
To walk through this blood rain, even if it's me who bleeds
No wasted years behind - this war will last forever
If alive I feel dead cold inside
