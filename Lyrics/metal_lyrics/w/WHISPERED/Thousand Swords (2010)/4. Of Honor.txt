Once again, story torn must be told
It shall erase the lies spoken of others (Those eyes don't see their owners)

So much we've shed hate that there's no one left to blame
All is one and one is all, shouldn't we all be the same?

Honor and pride are still worth nothing
It's a curse set upon us, it shall be broken
So much we shed tears for our useless inner fear
The time has come, to see and hear how once again the end is near

Gaze to the path before,
Not sealed anymore
See everything from within,
Confront your inner being

Of honor I must speak, these words in which I believe
Thou shalt shelter my words in thy heart

Of honor I must speak words forgotten, still real
Thou shalt search for my words in thy heart

Just listen.

[Solo: Pepe, Mika, Jouni, Mika]

Gaze to the path before,
Not sealed anymore
See everything from within,
Confront your inner being

Of honor I must speak, these words in which I believe
Thou shalt shelter my words in thy heart

Of honor I must speak words forgotten, still real
Thou shalt shelter for my words in thy heart
