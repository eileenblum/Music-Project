[Part I: Sakura's Omen]

[instrumental]

[Part II: A Master and a Servant]

Scars of countless number
Carved with the knife of time

Gone are fights for pain inside
Flames smothered by defeat

Once was he invincible
Once walked above the gods
Beat by unlikely champion
Now he kneels before a man

All was changed, a fateful night 
Battle for the thousandth blade

Humble mind over haughty matter
In a master a servant revealed

Flakes cold, white slowly fall
Grows silent the land again

Leaves wither, speak the words unheard
Yet true for a tormented soul seeking answer

Flakes cold, white slowly fall
Grows silent the land again.

Silent are the woods, silent are the waters, 
Silent is the bridge once surrounded by a wall of steel
One arrived, two walked away, nothing stayed the same
To feel the life in every breath, every soul he takes
That is the way of a warrior.

Stars so far away, alone they stay, like now my blade in the snow
No more there's a need to ask the questions

Stars they guide me, they give my peace, as I leave my blade in the snow
No more there's a need to find an answer

Stars so far away, alone they stay like now my blade in the snow
Now I've found the path, now's there a meaning for my war

Free from all, he joined a war
No longer one his own

Once alone, now gives his swords
To serve his master's cause

[Solo: Pepe, Jouni , Mika, Matias]

[Part III : Betrayal and standing death]

Traitor, a betrayal, a fallen among them
Serpent, poisons me, it's venom my own blood

Despair, defeat draws near, no way to change the course
Only one, after nightfall still stands on his feet.

[Part IV : River Sanzu / Birth of a legend]

[instrumental]

[Part V : Blade in the Snow]

Stars so far away, alone they stay, like now my blade in the snow
No more there's a need to ask the questions

Stars so far away, alone they stay, like now my blade in the snow
No more there's a need to ask the questions (please give me peace)

Stars, they guide me, they give me peace, I leave my blade in the snow
Stars please guide me

Flakes cold, white slowly fall
Grows silent the land again
Earth, mountains, rivers - hidden in the nothingness
In the nothingness
Earth mountains, rivers revealed
It is our path defining our desires
Our desires defining our goal
Our goal defining our deeds
Our deeds defining who we are
Spring flowers, winter snows
There's no being or non-being , nor denial itself.

I've been set free
