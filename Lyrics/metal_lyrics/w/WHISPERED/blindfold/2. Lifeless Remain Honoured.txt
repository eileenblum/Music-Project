Never there has been a memorian for honour
in my time of life.
Soul should keep heart for those who've fallen
by the winds of fight.

Forgotten is the word's meaning.
For that is true I assure you.
It's buried with the hearts,
that once shined for the passion
for a sword and true devotation.

Wasted this all, and death can't claim
Grief from the all of us, so pure so plain
Wasted this all , and death can't claim
If only someone would life for everything that's gone

Lifeless remain honoured!

Bring me the first one that made the way,
for the useless thoughts and values that roam.
In everyone's life there's a place
for creation and valor, new heritage

Wasted this all, and death can't claim
Grief from the all of us, so pure so plain
Wasted this all , and death can't claim
If only someone would witness that lifeless remain honoured!

Wasted this all, and death can't claim
Grief from the all of us, so pure so plain
Wasted this all , and death can't claim
If only someone would life for everything that's gone

Wasted this all, and death can't claim
Grief from the all of us, so pure so plain
Wasted this all , and death can't claim
If only someone would witness that lifeless remain honoured!
