Welcome to my realm, twisted but real
where no one can see

Where the cold gets stronger, it grows everyday
as it flows through thee

Eyes all around you not watching a thing
they are blindfolded by lies

No word can be said they hear but themselves
my silence keeps them alive

Not a word that you hear them say will ever be true

Like a blade it pierces and makes you blinded too

They follow their path with having no sight,
they are misguided by blind,

Don't want to hear it to spoken out loud,
that their life's filled with lies

Helpless I stand here, day after day
and trying to stay sane

I don't feel the hatred I don't feel the grief
but I live in their pain.

Not a word that you hear them say will ever be true

Like a blade it pierces and makes you blinded too

They say that nothing good will last,
and yet they're living like everyone
How can one lie in such way and kill all dignity

They say that nothing good will last
and yet they're living like everyone
How can they lie in such way, if they're living for dying

They say that nothing good will last,
and yet they're living like everyone
How can one lie in such way and kill all dignity

They say that nothing good will last,
and yet they're living like everyone
How can one lie in such way and kill all honor

They say that nothing good will last,
and yet they're living like everyone
How can one lie in such way and kill all life

They say that nothing good will last
and yet they're living like everyone
How can they lie in such way, if they're living for dying
