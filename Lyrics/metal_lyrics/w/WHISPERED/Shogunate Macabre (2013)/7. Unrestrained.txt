A haze of doubt surrounds my thoughts as I hide
from my fate, for I'm not ready to die
I've given my heart and soul for my sword,
but the path seems obscured
Was the vow I've given for my life absolute lie

Shameful acts create a void
tearing me down

I try to reach my pride
But I just run
I try to be so strong,
but I fail

One must never flee, (if the world is burning)
you will find a comrade of your blade, do not hesitate
One must never fall, (for the views of the weak)
by giving your blood for the steel, you're reborn, saved, unrestrained

The end of the line, the end of me draws nigh
Rage flows through me as I wonder why
I cannot hold my hate, I'm condemned in shame
For the code of war I am merely a man

One must never flee, (if the world is burning)
you will find a comrade of your blade, do not hesitate
One must never fall, (for the views of the weak)
by giving your blood for the steel, you're reborn, saved, unrestrained
