Left to rot by our actions unspoken
Her flesh consumed by times of ignorance
No-one gave her glory for the light she brought upon us
our fates sealed by her hatred burning forever

Flames upon myself
for I didn't bow for her brightness

No food grows in the land burnt to ashes
no water flows in a world where her fury has ripped the soil in half

Please hear our cries, forgive us oh goddess
Tears in your eyes, shame on us oh goddess

Fallen
The goddess of sun
Fallen
The mistress of light
Fallen by our souls,
which gave her no hope
Fallen by our eyes,
which gave her only lies

The goddess of the sun
We'll see thy will be done
We serve you, righteous one

Please hear our cries, forgive us oh goddess
Tears in your eyes, shame on us oh goddess

Fallen
The goddess of sun
Fallen
The mistress of light
Fallen by our souls,
which gave her no hope
Fallen by our eyes,
which gave her only lies
