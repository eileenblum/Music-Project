Prominent I stand as I lead my men to war
With banners held high "we'll waste 'em all" I swore
I seek within myself, find no fear as we march
God of eight banners by our side, the soil beneath our feet will parch

Ahead!
I scream as we draw our swords

Tonight!
Death claims every single soul
but mine

The blood stains the ground
But upon my honor I'll return!
The blades cut so deep
But upon my honor I'll return!
Five thousand arrows pierce me
But upon my honor I'll return!
The light before me fades away
but Upon my honor I'll return!
Victorious we'll return!

Impaled I stand they
want to see me fall
Their hands tremble,
I'm ready to face 'em all
Smile on my face, I approach
their formation weak
One by one they turn around,
scared, I made them retreat

The cries of men held a sweet promise
of their defeat
I walked among the chaos witnessing
the August Star O Heaven coming down
The earth shook as he laid his feet to the ground
watching me with pride, for I brought him
a true harmony of blood

Ahead!
I scream as we wield our swords

Hold the line!
I shout as we face their hordes
Ahead!
I scream with blood filled lungs

Tonight!
We will claim every single soulÂ 
with pride

The blood stains the ground

The blades cut so deep

Five thousand arrows pierce me
But upon my honor I'll return!
The light before me fades away
but Upon my honor I'll return!
Victorious we'll return!
