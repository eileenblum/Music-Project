Screams from deep bellow,
the foul air smells of death
The townsfolk gathered to pray
for the last hours of their lives

As the night falls, fear grows
locked doors won't hold back
the one who craves for
fresh human blood and your newborn children

The sacrifices weren't enough,
to keep it in its watery realm
judging the fate of all,
this being twisted now arises

When the night falls demise of man
cannot be put aside
No mercy upon our kind,
when the skin scaled is upon sight, the time has come to die

From the depths of the waters, the child of river will rise
Lifeless eyes of the creature reflect the dark of the night
Bring yourselves for the Kappa, the ancient lord of black waters
Bring your children for Kappa, fresh human blood for the Kappa

The last ones running like hell,
hunted, scattered and scared
The ground is stained red,
as it pursues forth to kill

Savaging the last of the women,
crunching remains of the men
Ripping remaining pieces of their flesh
leaving living ones choking on their own blood

From the depths of the waters, the child of river will rise
Lifeless eyes of the creature reflect the dark of the night
Bring yourselves for the Kappa, the ancient lord of black waters
Bring your children for Kappa, fresh human blood for the Kappa
