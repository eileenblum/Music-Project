Frozen figure stands in the storm
Flakes of snow embrace the essence of her earthly form
Her eerie song heard through dales and mountains far away
Brings a curse on those who dare to listen

Floating above the plains she wanders in her realm
Hearing screams of her prey draw closer
She gazes upon the fields where battle rages eternally
Waiting for warriors weakened to fall in her arms

In their eyes they saw her presence grim float above the ice
Wounded still they crawled towards her call
They hoped to find salvation from her arms, white and pure
But the storm grew strong as they closed her figure

Cursed be this woman
The lady of the wind

Night casts its shadow on the field of battle
Few still breathing but the air turns cold
She appeared like a spirit of death
Blizzard veil in ground around her
Embracing the last of the living with her hands
Young and cold as ice

In our eyes we saw her presence grim float above the ice
Wounded still we crawled towards her call
We hoped to find salvation from her arms, white and pure
But the storm grew strong as we closed her figure

Cursed be this woman
The lady of the wind

In our eyes we saw her presence grim float above the ice
Wounded still we crawled towards her call
We hoped to find salvation from her arms, white and pure
As we reached her gown we felt her hands slowly sweeping our lives away
