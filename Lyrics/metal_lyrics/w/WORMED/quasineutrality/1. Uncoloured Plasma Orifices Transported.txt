Accelerated by gravity
In this erupted dimension
Effulgent lights emanation
Geodesic dome disintegration absolute

Massive transition without radiation
Crossing the prohibited lines

Emitted

By meta stable levels
Exploring the gelatinous surfaces

Dynamic propulsion
Of my old system

With magnificent, convulsions
In the atomic crystal, reflections
Over the fatal status, tech-stone
I'm an entity, collapsing in the time

Transforming the new voxel

Charged with tons of antimatter

Blasting the holes of obscurity
Blasting the holes

Absorbing the last cell in this unfavorable corporeality
Black density around and harsh molecular, unexplained phenomena, intolerance
intolerance!

Poisoning the universal matter, Gravity
Electromagnetism, and strong, Weak
Nuclear forces, are
An united entity, flow

Nuclear forces are a united!

I have to escape of this Euclidean space
Where I can test this fictitious impression of depth? Impression of depth?

In this machine where the reversibility is non absolute

Krighsu! Krighsu! Contemplates me
Krighsu! Krighsu! Contemplates me

From the fissure

Trying to avoid thy intellectual encumbrance
Tons of oblate spheroids

Tons of oblate spheroids (gravity)

Rotating about the minor axis of this hole
Tried to find the area under the curve a paradoxical navigability

The number of vectors is equal to the dimension
A new geodesation operation under the influence of gravity

A solid cut off between two parallel planes
Charging the orifices with my own proton-electron mass ratio

Six billion light years away pulverizing the old plane
Beyond the confines of your single galaxy

Your eight-dimensional cosmos is right now succumbed

Virtually unlimited
