The call listener
Entering the floating transporter
The journey turned out to be a long one
Physical laws are no longer exist
Tuning last radio messages sent from earth
Breaking the barrier of spacetime
I shouldn't listen to them
Solar system terraformed
Unfavourable alternatives
Testing all the elements
Unfavourable alternatives
Testing all
What is the use?
What are the worth, now?
What is the use?
What are the worth!
What is the use?
What are the worth, now?
What?
Through the arch of supernova who remains still
is maintained unvarying in time collecting and compressing hydrogen
From the interstellar medium thermal equilibrium
I would have become extinct here Fardepth
It's all over
It's all over
Through the winding paths of the stars
My feet never more will tread the land
Distressed with magnetohydrodynamics
This have to be solved simultaneously
Either analytically or numerically
Entropy of the fluid, element reconditioned
Conductive and radiative pathways approaching
Source is clear
Earth is doomed
