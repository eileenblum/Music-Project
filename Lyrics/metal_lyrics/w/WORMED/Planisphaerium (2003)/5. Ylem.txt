State of the matter before
(The) primary explosion

In the cosmology of the big-bang, this is
The extremely compressed neutrons
Of the primary substance
In this dimension

The space while
I am not inside
It will be paralyzed

Marked by a common rule i travel
Toward the center, toward the infinity
Ina reference point near Ylem

I am the point zero
I am the center of the cosmos
I am in all directions

I am Ylem
I am Ylem

I am the point zero
I am the center of the cosmos
I am in all directions

I am Ylem
I am Ylem

External Inside The Outside
Beyong the last mirror of the infinite

Infinite

Covered by plasma
Regroup new explosion
Concentrate all black matter
From inside
