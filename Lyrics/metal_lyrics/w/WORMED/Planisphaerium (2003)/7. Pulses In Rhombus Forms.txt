Unbalanced breeze distortion
Unbalanced container abstraction

Distance is something we understand
In a primal way

I feel (symmetry?)

In the light year limitation
One will arrive

Just one
For the edges form

All rhombus in expansion

Crack on the cubes, loud
Linear ray crosses, my cloud

Above the inferior human life

Despite the struct limitation of volume
Quantum line can take most extreme structures

Extreme structures

Inside the rhombus, closed angles
Multiplied by my edges
Between the others vertex fused
Expanded once again

When the box is checked
The various internal rhombus appear
Randomly, one by one

Two dimensions used
Plus strange cosmic hole

Organism likes sepctra fusion
In this strange rhombuillusion
