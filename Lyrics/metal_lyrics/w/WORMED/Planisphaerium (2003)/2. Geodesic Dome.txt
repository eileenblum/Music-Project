Eclipsing cosmic waves

Inside the dome zero gravity
Now the reality portal is totally open

Swallow me, revolting organic being
Dome i can see, waiting me
Twisted, Eight iconospheres
Dome i can see, waiting me

So much light-years that they had served in the dome
In order to terminate today
The dome is swallowed by the black hole

This is the end, the creation of Kirgshu
I advance, on the apparently,
Endless black hole

The already aspect of black mass, decaying

Fragmentation of real dimension
Regeneration of the decaying dome

Vast turbulence of meteors and glactic dust
Parallel undefined measurements
Time has new form, life has new form

DEL NOS HEX UNDE NOIX RE O SUHE UNDE NOIX

Decaying

Accept, Revolting organic being
Dome i can see, waiting me
Twisted, Eight iconospheres
Dome i can see, waiting me

Paralysing ovum noise
Like embryonic complete tranquility

(The) Dome complete his wor

Parallel undefined measurements
Time has new form
Life has new form
Now i realize that the meaning of my life are wrong
