Decomposted gas on ions
And electrons recombination
The dissociation and ionisation is
In dynamic equilibrium

Cosmic substance group between
Interstellar material light

Six millions, of light-years calculating
There isnt atmosphere

Powerful electric conductivity dimness...
I look for an exit
Powerful electric conductivity dimness...
I look for an exit of this surface

Cause: orbit is raved,
The non defined quadrants
Liberate a chaotic droning, deffect
The voxel is damaged

Extreme radiation

Disintegrate part of the light protection rings
I cant sigh the end of
This horrible astral plane

Vibrations, extreme crash blow

Voided

Grandiose spheres around me
The empty ones deformed stars
Eternally suffering without back
No return

Vibrations, extreme crash blow

Six millions, of light-years calculating
There isnt atmosphere

Concentrate a lot of energy
Can obliterate me at this speed
