Organic material tunnel
Embryonic stellar drones
Heat

Visions flashes shiny chaos
Loud flickers of light repeated
Worm skinholes around me
Stellar frost inserted again

Emanating form the depths of hole
I have arrived in pieces
I am the incubator now
One stellar insect

Why everything is so empty? Empty
Why the light is going out? Going out
Why the end of horizon are here above my?

Emanating from the depths of hole
I have arrived in pieces
I am the incubator now
One stellar insect

Multiple voxels, the edge
Is the only that i could see
This black hole, deep
Distorting the endless space

Voxel

Lines, infinite, here for special reason
Volumetric space subdivided into voxels

In our minds eye, our mind...

Emanating from the depths of hole

Immense crater
Mitosis is now finished
Accumulating all energy
Of ions scab, petrified

Depth is not far, descent is short

Inside it / millions / degrees / under / zero
I couldnt feel human form
Crack sounds spiral of noise

Depth is not far
