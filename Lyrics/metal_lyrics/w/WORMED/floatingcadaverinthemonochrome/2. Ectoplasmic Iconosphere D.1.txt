Drag of crime in the path of dupe
Crushing the brief of human counts
Anger; hate is the blame
Ghastly sounds stun my fear

Stun my fear

Abysmal lunatic nuclear gallows
Abysmal lunatic nuclear gallows

Under gorgeous neutron
Central nerve cell
Under gorgeous neuron
Lubricate the sphere

Blasting the repurcussion
Thoughts of repitition
Blasting
Codes of steel
Inorganic life falls
Codes...

Suffering, in the master sphere
Nucleus, of shiny burning light
Electrocute the mystic plague
Dreaming in black, the grave is near

Their own chants intrude
An archaic broken measures
They shall be unknown
In the cold deformed majestic horizons

Chaos, bizarre hard world
Fire, of burning crime
Plasma, intensify the pain
Metal, sign of the ectoplasm
