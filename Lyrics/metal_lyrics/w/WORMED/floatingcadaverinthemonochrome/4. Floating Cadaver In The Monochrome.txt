Metric collosus of pain violator
Agonizing sorrow chasm in the light
Burial around the slave of mirrors
Floating cadaver in the monochrome

Floating cadaver in the monochrome

Blackened abyss of tubular rays
Bastards guide the hopeless faith

Virtual trance among the stars
Only dreadful shadows rising
Bells of hatred in the maze
The corpses never find the exit

Blackened abyss of tubular rays
Bastards guide the hopeless faith
Corporate prison of cold ice
Somebody stole the pain of my eyes

Stay forever in the black maze
Dimensions of metallic structures

Percentages near the absolute...
