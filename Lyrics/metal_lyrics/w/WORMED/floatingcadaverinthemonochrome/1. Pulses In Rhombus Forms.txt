Unbalanced breeze distortion
Unbalanced container abstraction

Distance is something we understand
In a primal way

I feel
(Symmetry?)

In the light year volume limitation
One will arrive

Just one...
For the edges form

All rhombus in expansion

Crack on the cubes, loud
Linear ray crosses, my cloud

Above the inferior human life

Despite the strict limitation of volume
Quantum line can take
Most extreme structures
Extreme structures...

Inside the rhombus, closed angles
Multiplied by my edges
Between others vertex fused
Expanded once again

When the box is checked,
The various internal rhombus appear
Randomly, one by one

Two dimensions uses
Plus strange cosmic hole
Organism likes spectra-fusion
In this strange rhombillusion
