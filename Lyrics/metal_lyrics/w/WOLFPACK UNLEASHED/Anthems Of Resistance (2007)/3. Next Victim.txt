Selected, sight is clear
In focus, ending's near
Target locked within view
Pull the trigger, killing you
Vindicated far beyond crime
No doubts, feel sublime
All hatred only decline
Eliminate all mankind

You don't know them nor their name
Another victim in his grave

Next victim -- taken life -- another victim -- zeroed life

Endless pain of battles ago
Just statistics -- numbers they know
Another victim in my sight
Don't need reason -- end this life

No regret, no conscience, never repent
While there's any next victim to find, I will not end
