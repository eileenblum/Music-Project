Legions are marching to the battlefield
Crusaders of the white light
Valiant they're storming on, knights of the cross
Courage feeds their pounding hearts

Although our lives fade, still our honour remains

Together we stand to challenge death
Where the iron cross grows
A tale of honour forged in steel
I'll show you now where the iron cross grows

Swallows are gliding through the crimson sky
Tigers are ruling the ground
Panic stricken enemies fleeing in fear
Dark legions victorious

Summon for the attack
Decisive assault begins today

Honour the dead who gave their lives for us
Requiem mass for all those with pride in their hearts
