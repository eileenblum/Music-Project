Silent veil is all around me
Not a single noise
I can't hear the bird's bright singing
Nor somebody's voice
Hopeless illness torments me
I'm forced to face my fate
Amputation of my talent
Caving out my pate

My hearing is fading -- my music is shading
The deafness is growing -- sweet notes are bowing

Dices have rolled -- darkness called -- embracing the dark
The only tones -- I can hear -- are there in my heart

Misanthropic being, I am hiding in my room
Fleeing into composition, symphony of doom
