Straight on in the face
For others just disgrace
Created zero five
New monster is alive
Clean and fast the attack
Precise machine gun blast
All must bow at last

Within their hearts there is no mercy
They'll never stop, they're thrashing till the end

Every single strong and proud
Individuals in a crowd
Masters of their class
To rise above the mass
Together fronting you and firing off their groove
Prepare on their appearance
Pack's here to thrash the lands
