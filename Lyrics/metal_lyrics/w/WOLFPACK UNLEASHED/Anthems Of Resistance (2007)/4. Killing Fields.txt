There's no time for thinking and there is no time for resting
Cold and hungry stare through the lens
You shoot on everything that moves

There is no sense in what you see
There is no chance for victory

This is the land where no one's home
Got company, but still alone

This is the land where no one dreams
Killing fields
What can be lost what can be won?
Just forwards, you're marching on
Killing fields. Forward

It's not who's right or wrong
It's only who survives

This place is old as age itself
And it has called for a million lives
Some can escape but they'll return
Weapons change, but death's the same
