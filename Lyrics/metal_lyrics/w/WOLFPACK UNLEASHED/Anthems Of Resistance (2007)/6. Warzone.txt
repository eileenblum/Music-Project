Burning scar in my soul
My love has gone -- she left a hole
I feel so let, let flow my tears
It's agony and it's all fears

A war zone in my heart is tearing me apart
No one can hear my cries
The pain is choking me
It sucks the air out of my life

There's only misery
My hands are longing for the knife

I thirst for you, for your warm breath
You promised me to love till death
My torture has reached it's peak
Sharpened steel brings what I seek

Ned you
Torture
Hunger
Agony
