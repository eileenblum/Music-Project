Fight all those who don't believe in me
Make them bow and fall to knees
Praise me for I'll be your saviour
Receive my words and my behaviours

Because you benefit from my grace
So follow my trace, hear my call!
Religion of control

Gathering disciples with no will
Teach them how to pray and how to kill
Cleanse the earth of all those running sores
Worldwide domination I adore

Truth is, I'm not god, but you can't see
Lying to you keeps you feeding me
Censored information reaches your ears
So I keep on, feed your doubts and fears
