Welcome to the Eternal Inn
Wher all the ages of times have been
Warriors sleep, farmers have drinks
And everyone just come to sin
After the fight, after you've done
Finally enjoy a mug of mead
We know you have slaved yourself
Just for a time of mead and meat

And we all know why you have come
Masters and slaves came for the same

Enjoyment and peace at the inn was your will
Why have you the been fighting for
Battles and many blood on the way
Looking for mead and a warm plate of meat
Enjoyment and peace at the inn was your will
Why have you the been fighting for
Battles and many blood on the way
Looking for the pagan hordes united

So hang your coat, leave your boots outside
Join us and dance all around the place
We are the hordes from the all times
Just be our brother and enjoy the fire
You know as well what really mind
Violins and flutes are about to speak
Bare feet dancing with the pagan tunes
We are the pagan hordes united

And we all know why you have come
Masters and slaves came for the same

Enjoyment and peace at the inn was your will
Why have you the been fighting for
Battles and many blood on the way
Looking for mead and a warm plate of meat
Enjoyment and peace at the inn was your will
Why have you the been fighting for
Battles and many blood on the way
Looking for the pagan hordes united

Pagan hordes united
