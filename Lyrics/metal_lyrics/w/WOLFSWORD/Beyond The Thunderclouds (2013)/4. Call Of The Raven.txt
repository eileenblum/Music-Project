A blackened dawn lights the sky above me,
The winter winds blow cold across the sea,
Carrying the words of the mighty one eyes god
His vengeance shall be wrought this day,

I hear the wrath of the raven's call
Echoing in my soul
Binding me to him forever
Until victory or blood defeat

All shall fall before us,
Until we are
Proven worthy
In the eyes of Odin

No enemy shall stand before our axes,
Our blades even hungering
We walk the path of the All father
In light of day and through darkest night,

I hear the wrath of the raven's call
Echoing in my soul
Binding me to him forever
Until victory or blood defeat

All shall fall before us,
Until we are
Proven worthy
In the eyes of Odin
