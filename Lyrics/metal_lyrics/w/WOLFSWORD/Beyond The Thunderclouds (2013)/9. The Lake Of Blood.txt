Coming through the empty sky
Cracking branches and dead leaves
A trail of blood
Resound of a horn

Orion in rise, Hunter's moon
and your fate is sealed
your soul will be engulfed
Resound of a horn

Join us and ride in the Lake of Blood
your soul will be forgotten
Hear the call of the wild
Join us and ride to the Wild Hunt
One fate time one bind
hear the call of the wild

I am the one, chosen to follow
I am the howl of a spear in the night
I am the wind, the last breath of Autumn
I am one of you, I'm the Wild Hunt

The season of blood
Winter is upon us
Ride in the night
Hern by my side

Orion in Rise howl to the skies
nothing to fear nothing to lose
Taste the scent of blood
Resound of a horn!

Join us and ride in the Lake of Blood
your soul will be forgotten
Hear the call of the wild
Join us and ride to the Wild Hunt
One fate time one bind
hear the call of the wild

I am the one, chosen to follow
I am the howl of a spear in the night
I am the wind, the last breath of Autumn
I am one of you, I'm the Wild Hunt

I'm the Wild Hunt

Join us and ride in the Lake of Blood
your soul will be forgotten
Hear the call of the wild
Join us and ride to the Wild Hunt
One fate time one bind
hear the call of the wild

I am the one, chosen to follow
I am the howl of a spear in the night
I am the wind, the last breath of Autumn
I am one of you, I'm the Wild Hunt
