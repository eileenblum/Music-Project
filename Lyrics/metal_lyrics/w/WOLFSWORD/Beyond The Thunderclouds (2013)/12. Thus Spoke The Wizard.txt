Hordes of chaos have come
Angered, wielded steel blades with power
They're all sloodthirsty
Hate in their eyes
They're bringing your doom

Drums of war,
Screams, loud warsongs of power
Barrels of fire
Battering rain, storming the wall

The air raises its backles
The winds scream death, fire and metal
A bright figure raises
On battlements cracking fire and metal

Thus spoke the wizard

Light, columns of fire
Chains lightings of mystical power
Bruning the flesh
And talking death to all

Feared units
Doomed, running away from the lava
And rains of fire
From the wizard unleashed might

The air raises its backles
The winds scream death, fire and metal
A bright figure raises
On battlements cracking fire and metal

Thus spoke the wizard
