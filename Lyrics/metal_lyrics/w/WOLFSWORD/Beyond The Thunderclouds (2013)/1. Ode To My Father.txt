Since you left this realm of living, Time has ceased existence. Your memories remain with me for eternity. An eternal sleep shall stir your immortality, until we one day shall meet under the stars. For your star once shined for all to breathe, it now shines forever in me, and in the midst of my heart. Your words of wisdom ehich you instilled upon my soul shall forever flow through my veins, until one day we shall reforge our alliance and carry on our quest through time, and towards the stars....
