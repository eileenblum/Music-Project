Passing through the sands of time
Cascading down lifeâs hourglass
Treading the footprints in your mind,
Legacy of the ancient ones,
But in our dreams they are defined,
They are within our blood,
For the line runs deep and true
To brave new worlds beyond the sun

These are the times, swords shining in the sky
Our pagan hearts shall carry us along
Stars in the night, victorious in sight,
As we sing of warriorsâ songs,
We shall be strong, forever carry on,
Across the moors we trail through the night,
So raise up your horns and all sing along as we drink for glory and might

Through endless nights of misery,
Our force shall not be reckoned with,
Riding on horses strong and proud,
The sound of battle shakes the ground
With the thunder in our hearts 
And the stormclouds high above,
A sacred vow in battle forged
Hammered into our hearts

These are the times, swords shining in the sky
Our pagan hearts shall carry us along
Stars in the night, victorious in sight,
As we sing of warriorsâ songs,
We shall be strong, forever carry on,
Across the moors we trail through the night,
So raise up your horns and all sing along as we drink for glory and might
