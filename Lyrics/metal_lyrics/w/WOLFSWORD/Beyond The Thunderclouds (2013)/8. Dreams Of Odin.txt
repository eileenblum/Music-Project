Eight hoof falls sound across midgard, heralding his passing,
The hanged wone, all father of the Asagods
Eternal all seeing one eyed wanderer,
On Sleipnir into battle he rides

Odin, Allfather,
Most ancient of the gods,
Odin, Allfather,
Ruler of the nine worlds

Pierced to Yggdrasil and yet still unbowed
Lord of men and the victorious dead
The Einherjar in Valhalla watch as
On Sleipnir into battle he rides

Odin, Allfather,
Most ancient of the gods,
Odin, Allfather,
Ruler of the nine worlds
