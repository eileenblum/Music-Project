Woods and green was the heart of his home
Cold and dark was the core of this soul
He didn't know about the peace of mind
Something raging from inside of his chest

Pushed to run into the deep
Blood and anger into his eyes

Claimed by the reign of the lonely wolf
Marked by the sign of the Red Moon
Raging at the night howling to darkness
Bare feet on the fresh cradle of leaves

His desire of run
Into the deep of the trees

And he wielded eyes of fire
His voice full of growling howl
Turning the back from his people lies
Running again into the deepest wood
