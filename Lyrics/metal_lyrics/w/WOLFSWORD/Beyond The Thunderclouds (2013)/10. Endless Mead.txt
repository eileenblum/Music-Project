From the mist covered mountains to the vast forest of the east,
Men seek the answers to life but many forget the simple truth,
Come my friends, time for another drink,

From coast to coast,
May the mead flow true,
And the dawn never come,
Until we are done,

Once again the candlelight flickers, come on, while the night is still young
Time to quench our mighty thirst, with our brothers fallen or no,
Come my friends, time for another drink,

From coast to coast,
May the mead flow true,
And the dawn never come,
Until we are done
