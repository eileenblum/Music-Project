[Words: J. Moore, R. Rose Words: J. Moore]

Your pulse is racin' and your temperature starts to rise 
Any every ounce of fear, is showin' in your eyes. 
You grab on tight as the coaster starts to roll. 
If you think you're in a dream, you're nothin' but a fool! 
[CHORUS:] 
You're in a nightmare! 
Nowhere to run to, in a nightmare. 
Nocturnal dispair, in a nightmare. 
Where will you run to, in a nightmare? 
And all at once your world is filled with light. 
And you see reality passing out of sight. 
A grand illusion unfolds before your eyes. 
You turn to run away, then you realize ... 
[CHORUS:] 
You're in a nightmare! 
Nowhere to run to, in a nightmare. 
Nocturnal dispair, in a nightmare. 
Where will you run to, in a nightmare? 
And through the fog there lies a mystical light. 
The catacombs of fear, will be explored tonight. 
Shadows of death, fight to take your soul, 
Surrounded by darkness, you're in too deep to know ... 
[CHORUS:] 
You're in a nightmare! 
Nowhere to run to, in a nightmare. 
Nocturnal dispair, in a nightmare. 
Where will you run to, in a nightmare?
