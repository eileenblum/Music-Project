[Music: V. Rose, R. Rose Words: T. Pack, R. Rose]

You have pushed me, you think I'm weak, 
Your mouth is open, but you don't speak. 
Expect no mercy, you did me wrong. 
All of my wounds now sing your song. 
[CHORUS 1] 
And heads will roll, Blood will flow. 
Your life of lies, takes its toll. 
Heads will roll, Blood will flow, 
and you shall reap just what you sow. 
You don't know me, but I know you. 
I'm not here to judge you, that time is through. 
I am made righteous, by all I do. 
Don't have any time for the evil you do. 
[CHORUS 2] 
And heads will roll, Blood will flow. 
Your life of lies, takes its toll. 
In the dark the thunder rolls, 
and You shall reap just what you sow. 
Listen now with your heart, hear what I say. 
I'm a wicked Angel, you're gonna pay. 
I hear your words, you are a liar. 
How does it feel? To play with fire. 
[CHORUS 3] 
Heads will roll, blood will flow, 
your life of lies takes its toll, 
in the dark, thunder rolls, 
terror grips your very soul, 
Heads will roll, blood will flow, 
and you shall reap just what you sow!
