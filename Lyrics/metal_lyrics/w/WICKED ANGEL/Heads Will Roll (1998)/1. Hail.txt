[Music: D. Sifritt, Words: R. Rose]

And I saw myself standing before the throne, 
and a loud voice cried out Behold! 
Then I saw a fiery steed clad in battle reignment and he that sat upon him was God's 
own warrior come to do battle with the children of the beast. 
Get on your feet, or on your knees, all hail Wicked Angel!
