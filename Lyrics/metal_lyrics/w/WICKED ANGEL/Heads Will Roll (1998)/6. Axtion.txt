[Music &amp; Words: R. Rose]

Well you've heard the songs of heaven. 
And you know the songs of hell. 
But do you know which kind of lover 
Has you under her spell? 
Is she a princess, a whore, or a black-lace bitch? 
As a sacrifice you'll rise, when she goes down! 
[CHORUS:] 
Black Lace queen, lover from hell! 
Can't wait to get you behind closed doors. 
Then the axe comes down, your head spinnin' round. 
Then the axe comes down, on you! 
She's a maneater, a mean mistreater. 
And let me put you wise, she has the devil's eyes. 
She's got a body that will drive you wild. 
Oh what a way to die! 
[CHORUS:] 
Black Lace queen, lover from hell! 
Can't wait to get you behind closed doors. 
Then the axe comes down, your head spinnin' round. 
Then the axe comes down, on you! 
She's a huntress on the prowl, her love will make you howl. 
And your demise awaits between her silken thighs. 
Her appetite is endless, 
and you won't stand a chance if she gets her claws in you! 
[CHORUS:] 
Black Lace queen, lover from hell! 
Can't wait to get you behind closed doors. 
Then the axe comes down, your head spinnin' round. 
Then the axe comes down, on you!
