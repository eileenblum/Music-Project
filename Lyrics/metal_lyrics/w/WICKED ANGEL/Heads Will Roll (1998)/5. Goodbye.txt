[Music &amp; Words: R. Rose]

Goodbye! I'm ready for laughter. 
Goodbye! I've had enough of the pain. 
This time, when you turn to leave me, 
you won't hear me callin' out your name. 
This time, I won't let your memory, 
drag my heart out in the rain. 
[CHORUS:]
And I will be strong, and carry on; 
Till love shines on me again! 
Goodbye! I'm searching for true love. 
A love, that's real from the start. 
This time, I can face being lonely, 
cause there's a song, deep in my heart. 
This time, I feel like a new man. 
Go on! I want you to go! 
[CHORUS:]
And I will be strong, and carry on; 
Till love shines on me again! 
And I will be strong, and carry on; 
Till love shines on me again!
