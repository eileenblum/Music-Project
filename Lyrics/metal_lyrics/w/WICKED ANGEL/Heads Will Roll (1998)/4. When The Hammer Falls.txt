[Music: v. Rose Words: R. Rose]

You see the anger burnin' in my eyes. 
Past the breakin' point, sick of your lies. 
Promises made, then quickly broken. 
It's time to pay for the lies you've told. 
[CHORUS] 
When the hammer falls, there's no more lies. 
When the hammer falls, someone dies. 
We're no more a pawn in your foolish game. 
You fucking vipers, you're all the same. 
We won't be a cog in your fame machine. 
Watch you carve a nightmare out of our dream. 
[CHORUS:] 
When the hammer falls, there's no more lies. 
When the hammer falls, someone dies. 
[BRIDGE:] 
Thanks to you, my heart is black. 
You've pushed too far, I'm pushing back! 
Fiery rage burns in my head, when I get done, you'll wish you're dead. 
No more peace, now it's time for war! 
Wicked Angel, ain't your whore. 
We won't give in, fight till we fall. 
This song is our battlecall! 
[CHORUS:] 
When the hammer falls, there's no more lies. 
When the hammer falls, someone dies. 
When the hammer falls, on your head 
When the hammer falls, you're dead!
