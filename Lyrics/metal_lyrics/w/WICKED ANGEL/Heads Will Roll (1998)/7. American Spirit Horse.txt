[Music &amp; Words: R. Rose]

Runnin' down the winding road, my brothers by my side. 
Spirit as unbridled as the Harley that I ride. 
They brand me an outlaw, cause I don't play by their rules. 
Fear has made them die inside, they're the bloody fools. 
[CHORUS:] 
Ride hard! 
Live free! 
American Spirit Horse, inside of me. 
The spirit of America, is what drives me on. 
To see all this great land of ours before it is all gone. 
They're selling out America, you see it more each day. 
But I'll be damned if I'll ride rice, made in the USA. 
[CHORUS:] 
Ride hard! 
Live free! 
American Spirit Horse, inside of me. 
Ride hard! 
Die free! 
In the wind, where I wanna be. 
America she called on us, and we served her well. 
I know that we're all goin' to heaven, we've done our time in hell. 
You can see the fierce pride, I carry deep inside. 
A spirit as American, as the steel horse that I ride. 
[CHORUS:] 
Ride hard! 
Live free! 
American Spirit Horse, inside of me. 
Ride hard! 
Die free! 
In the wind, where I wanna be.
