[Music: V. Rose Words: R. Rose]

I come a stealin', out of the night. 
I won't bow down, I will stand and fight! 
For heavy metal, the life I choose. 
You won't break me, just try and you will lose! 
[CHORUS:] 
Ohhh Under the Gun 
Metal outlaw, under the gun. 
A steel defender, live by the knife. 
Just try to break me, and I will take your life. 
Live and let live, that's what I say. 
But mess with my life, the price you'll have to pay. 
[CHORUS:] 
Ohhh Under the Gun 
Metal outlaw, under the gun. 
[BRIDGE:] 
Live your life the way you want to. 
I'll live mine! 
If you try to rearrange me, you've crossed the line ... 
Now. I ain't no badass, I'm just a man. 
Fight when I have to, I will make a stand! 
Live by my conscience, not by decree. 
Don't hurt nobody, unless they fuck with me!!! 
[CHORUS:] 
Ohhh Under the Gun 
Metal outlaw, under the gun.
