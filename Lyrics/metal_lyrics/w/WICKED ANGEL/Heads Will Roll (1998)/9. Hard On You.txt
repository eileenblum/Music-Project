[Music: V. Rose Words: R. Rose]

Look out I'm comin' at ya! 
Comin' hard on you. 
You threw down the gauntlet! 
Now what ya gonna do?! 
[CHORUS:] 
Straight from the heart, 
Heed my words well! 
I won't sell out! Just give ya hell! 
I'm a metal warrior. 
Clear through my soul! 
Don't buy the shit they're sellin'! 
Don't give up control! 
[CHORUS:] 
Straight from the heart, 
Heed my words well! 
I won't sell out! 
Just give ya hell! 
Stay the fuck out of my face! 
Don't get in my way! 
Though these times are changin', 
Wicked Angel's here to stay! 
[CHORUS:] 
Straight from the heart, 
Heed my words well! 
I won't sell out! 
Just give ya hell!
