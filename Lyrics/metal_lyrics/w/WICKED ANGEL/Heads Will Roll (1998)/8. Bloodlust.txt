[Music: D. Framer Words: R. Rose]

Hiding deep in the shadows, away from the light. 
Now living in the darkness, children of the night. 
Once you had a clear vision, you lived for your dreams. 
Now living in a nightmare, none can hear your screams. 
[CHORUS:] 
You're living a lie, that you'll never die! 
It's in your head, cause you're already dead! 
Behind a shroud of darkness, cloaked in deadly fear 
None can sense your sorrow, or see the blood-red tear! 
[CHORUS:] 
You're living a lie, that you'll never die! 
It's in your head, cause you're already dead! 
Seduced by the love of power, your life's become a lie. 
Now you'll curse the sunlight, till the day you die. 
[CHORUS:] 
You're living a lie, that you'll never die! 
It's in your head, cause you're already dead!
