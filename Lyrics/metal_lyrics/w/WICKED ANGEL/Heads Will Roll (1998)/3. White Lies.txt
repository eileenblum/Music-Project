[Music: V. Rose Words: R. Rose]

Oh white lies, wear a thin disguise. 
Oh white lies, see it in their eyes. 
Don't let her in! 
She will always win. 
[CHORUS] 
Another shot in the dark, senseless violence 
Another shot in the dark, break the silence. 
Another shot in the dark, man lies bleeding. 
Another shot in the dark, who are you feeding, 
with white lies, alibis, can't disguise, damned white lies. 
Oh white lies, I hear your victims' cries 
Oh how you bleed, just to feed the need. 
Under her dark spell 
Life's a living hell. 
[CHORUS] 
Another shot in the dark, senseless violence 
Another shot in the dark, break the silence. 
Another shot in the dark, man lies bleeding. 
Another shot in the dark, who are you feeding, 
with white lies, alibis, can't disguise, damned white lies. 
Oh white lies, takes away your dreams, 
Oh white lies, she ain't all she seems. 
Oh white lies, Oh white lies. 
[CHORUS] 
Another shot in the dark, senseless violence 
Another shot in the dark, break the silence. 
Another shot in the dark, man lies bleeding. 
Another shot in the dark, who are you feeding, 
with white lies, alibis, can't disguise, cocaine lies.
