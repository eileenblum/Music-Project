This night is alive with the smell of insane
Its reaching for me and its calling my name
I beg for silence to drown out their weep
How did this asylum become where I sleep

So ashamed of waking
All my life you failed to keep me safe
My whole world's forsaken
Won't let you destroy my faith again

All my Questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
Mommy come get me out tonight
All my Questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
Mommy come get me out tonight

So close I almost could taste my own grave
My moment of selfishness caused by your pain
Almost threw this life you gave me away
In this institution for you now I pray

So ashamed of waking
All my life you failed to keep me safe
My whole world's forsaken
Won't let you destroy my faith again

All my Questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
Mommy come get me out tonight
All my Questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
Mommy come get me out tonight

Forgive me
With wings adorn me
So I can fly 

All my Questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
Mommy come get me out tonight

All my Questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
Mommy come get me out tonight

Mommy come get me out tonight
