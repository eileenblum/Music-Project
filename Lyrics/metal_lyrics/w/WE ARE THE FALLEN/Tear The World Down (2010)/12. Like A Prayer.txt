[B-Side]Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.
I hear you call my name and it feels like
Home.

[Chorus:]
When you call my name, it's like a little
Prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you
There. In the midnight hour, I can feel your
Power. Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing.
I have no choice, I hear your voice, feels like
Flying. I close my eyes, oh God, I think I'm
Falling, out of the sky. I close my eyes, Heaven
Help me.

[Chorus:]
When you call my name, it's like a little
Prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you
There. In the midnight hour, I can feel your
Power just like a prayer. You know I'll take
You there.

Like a child, you whisper softly to me. You're
In control just like a child, now I'm dancing.
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning.
You're here with me, it's like a dream. Let
The choir sing.

[Chorus:]
When you call my name, it's like a little
Prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you
There. In the midnight hour, I can feel your
Power, just like a prayer. You know I'll take
You there.

[Chorus:]
When you call my name, it's like a little
Prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you
There. In the midnight hour, I can feel your
Power just like a prayer. You know I'll take
You there.

[Refrain:]
Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.
I hear you call my name and it feels like
Home.

[Bridge:]
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me
There. Just like a muse to me , you are a
Mystery. Just like a dream, you are not what
You seem. Just like a prayer, no choice,
Your voice can take me there.

[Intermediate:]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there. It's
Like a dream to me. Just like a prayer, I'll
Take you there. It's like a dream to me. Just
Like a prayer, I'll take you there. It's like
A dream to me. Just like a prayer, I'll take
You there. It's like a dream to me.

[Medley]

[Bridge:]
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me
There. Just like a muse to me, you are a
Mystery. Just like a dream, you are not what
You seem. Just like a prayer, no choice,
Your voice can take me there.

[Intermediate:]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there. It's
Like a dream to me. Just like a prayer, I'll
Take you there. It's like a dream to me. Just
Like a prayer, I'll take you there. It's like
A dream to me. Just like a prayer, I'll take
You there. It's like a dream to me.
