Tonight I'm without you,
The raindrops are falling,
With candle light burning,
For you, I'll be waiting.

[Chorus:]
If all of the days have no more light,
And all of our dreams are lost tonight,
The stars can all fall
And everything turns to grey,
I will stay.

Graceful and loving
Tearful and soothing
Can't breathe without you,
There's no life without you here.

[Chorus]

Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.

[Chorus x2]
