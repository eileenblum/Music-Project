[B-Side]Memories flood through my brain
Tears drown my heart filled with rage
Blinding silence takes your place

Broken forever by this life
Why

Wake from where you lie 
Don't say goodbye
I'm praying for more time 
Don't sleep tonight

Heaven hear me, hold them safe
Time stands frozen, no more strength

Broken forever by this life
Why

Wake from where you lie 
Don't say goodbye
I'm praying for more time 
Don't sleep tonight

Lay low, peaceful dreaming,
Your last breath shall die
