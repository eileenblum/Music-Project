Memories fade into the silence,
Haunting me tonight,
With hope's last breath I take this moment in,
It will be the last.
The morning breaks,
and sunlight takes the pain away.

Ever after never came,
And I'm still waiting for a life that never was,
And all the dreams I lay to rest,
The ghost that keeps me, after all that I've become,
I am only one.
I am only one.

I close my eyes and bleed this empty heart
Of all that longs to die,
When faces lie and love will falter,
I'm left with only time,
And time will break
the dreams that take the pain away.

Ever after never came,
And I'm still waiting for a life that never was,
And all the dreams I lay to rest,
The ghost that keeps me, after all that I've become,
I am only one.
I am only one.

I'm on my own here,
and no one's left to be the hero of
this fairy tale gone wrong
as night will fall, my heart will die alone.

Ever after never came,
And I'm still waiting for my heart to beat again,
And all the dreams I've laid to rest,
are ghosts that keep me
after all that I've become,
I am only one.
I am only one.

I am only one.
