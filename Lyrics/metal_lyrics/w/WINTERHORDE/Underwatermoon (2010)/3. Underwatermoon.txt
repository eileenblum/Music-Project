Agsint the destiny, in the name of Nemesis
For the taken innocence 
She's going down the ocean sands

Impossible to understand
Why father despises her for being raped?
He rather would see her dead,
Than caring (sic) that weight, so miserable fate

No time to regret, 'till rumors aren't spread
Veins or depths, dishonor or death
Last time on this path with stone on her chest
Away from herself to the eternal rest

From now only waves will embrace her
The Ocean will hide her from danger
Away from the cruelity and hatred
For all the eternally lay there
A few more steps and she made it
How cold is the stone that she carries?
And no one is there who could save her
That soul is eternally damned

No time to regret, 'till rumors aren't spread
Veins or depths, dishonor or death
Last time on this path with stone on her chest
Away from herself to the eternal rest

Away, away, away!

Your soul will never fine the rest
Until there's a stone upon my chest

Against the destiny, in name of Nemesis
And no more enemies, 
The ocean keeps her safe and cold...
