Dirty hounds of fate are barking at my door
My daughter's suicide I can bare (sic) no more
I have to make it right I have to make it
Just to see the fading life in the eyes of murderer
Shoot him in the chest, avenge my daughter's death
Spare him from the life, hear the final breath
Fate demands his blood, spilled onto this soil
I'll do as she commands, 'till send his soul to...hell!

There is no place, where he can hide
From the death, when my time will come
To the death, when my time is done
I'll send his soul, to serve the goat
Back to hell, let him rot
Back in hell, where he belongs.

Track him through the rain, his footprints in the mud
Rain is trapped within, tears of wicked god
Smell his stench in dusk, smell of walking death
Swallow your disgust, shoot him in the chest

There is no place, where he can hide
From the death, when my time will come
To the death, when my time is done
I'll send his soul, to serve the goat
Back to hell, let him rot
Back in hell, where he belongs.

Blood is streaming down the hill, spilling

When fate with laughter blows her horn
Hunting the human
Revenge is close at the dawn is born
Hunting the human
To kill the pain, to leave (sic) again
Huntnig the human to feel complete and sane again
His death will calm my soul
This pain will torture me no more
This night of judgment ends with trail of...

Blood is streaming down the hill...

Their shadows blurred in smoke,
Their figures dimmed in fog
Is the killer dead,
What if I've been wrong?
How could I be so blind,
Oh, fate and wicked night
The body of his friend,
Is where the bullet stroke?

Hunting the human
When fate with laughter blows her horn
Hunting the human
Revenge is close at the dawn is born
Hunting the human
To kill the pain, to leave (sic) again
Huntnig the human to feel complete and sane again
