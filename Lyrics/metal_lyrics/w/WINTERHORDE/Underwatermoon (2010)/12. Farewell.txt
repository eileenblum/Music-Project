Heaven colored skin, wounded by burnings... and still Covered by slime and by silt
I leave you forever
Heaven colored skin, wounds in my soul, not by steel
Covered by lies and by filth
I damn you forever
Heaven colored skin,
Burned through the soul my guilt
Condemned for my crime and my sin
I'll rot here forever

When the moment of silence destroys the shore
And the sun gives its pledge to the sea
Only then I could leave the flesh
That's imprisoning me
Shw was watching me from the unknown, I felt
as her voice still rings in my ears:

"You are trapped here forever unless you set me free"

So I turned to the rocks, to leviathan's bones
That rest in their watery graves
Have they seen the one that I seek, 
But no one would say?
Where she's laying alone, 
Enchained to a stone,
which holds her spirit enslaved?
So I begged the ivory moon to show me the way

"Breathless, cold shiver down my spine
As it was for the first time I saw her alive
It was worth to die for that moment to see her again
'Cause what costs life without knowing death
(What death without knowing love?)
The flow pulled me down to the illuminated darkness And there she was...
I took the stone, it's my burden now..."

Farewell my soul!
I'm redeemed of my sin, my conscience is clean
Her spirit is finely free
The curse of gypsy is loosing its grip
I'm no longer a ghost, I'm bones and dust
And I sink to shimmering deep, my fate is complete

As the moment of silence destroys the shore
And the sun reborn from the sea
I awaken her soul from eternal sleep
She rose up to heavens like feather, 
And smiled through the clouds at me
And I found my rest on the bottom of the wide open sea
