"17 of august 1854
Port of Vigo, Galicia, Spain
Exhausted by the long sail, I was dreaming to forget
Everything on the bottom of the pint 
In this goddamned town
But these dreams were stronger than reality..."

Thirteen summer nights
I see the same vision in my nightmares
Wreckages of our ship 
And someone in my oblique stands behind me
Pale dead man's eyes 
Are staring through my body in the darkness
Twisted gruesome share or consciense
In the coat that finally broke free...

From me / I foresee / Death is near / The ghost is me

We stepped ashore and walked in search of tavern
Through dark and narrow streets that lead to nowhere
She came across and smiled like an angel
A wounded heart began to pound, 
My mind predicted danger
I tried to folloew her, but she escaped me
By night I fonud her on the shore
With necklace made of sea-shells
She screamed and cried in my embrace, 
But no one heard it
Just silent echo entangled in the hanging down cast net

Spanish august night enveloped 
Bloody sand with dusk and silence
Episodes of fear 
And silhouette of rapist froze in her eyes
Who possessed my soul 
And let my body do this heartless crime?
Shall I take the blame for ruined maiden fate 
Or just deny it?

Wreckage ghost 
Leave your host 
Wreckage ghost
A soul once lost
