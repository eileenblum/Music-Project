A time to depart
Before us a long way back home
I'm feeling the heat from inside of my body
Like flames that are licking my bones

Black was the night
As we challenged the ocean
Orphaned was moon as the stars disappeared
From the midsummer skies

Feverish blood
The doctor said : "He would die"
If innocent's murdered because of my honor
so now the turn will be mine

Black was the night
As we challenged the ocean
Orphaned was moon as the stars disappeared
From the midsummer skies

Strong were the waves
That were pulling us downwards
Straight to the silent and motionless
World away from the light
Rain and fire, raging inside
Drowned one's crying, is twisting my mind
Here they come through
The walls of my room
Morbid figures of smoke
Of the dead men from my past
And they're calling me home,
To the place I belong to,
But the waves are getting higher and higher

"Awaken!!! It's time to take your medicine...
Let me see: the heat is much lower.
It's a miracle!!!
I thought we would never talk again...
Bloody weather, it's been raining since the last eveninig
And as it seems it will not stop soon...
Holy Hell..."

I must find the way to save my soul...
I must find the way to save my soul...
