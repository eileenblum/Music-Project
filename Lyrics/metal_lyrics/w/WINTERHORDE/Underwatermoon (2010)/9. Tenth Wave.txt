Through the core blasting winds
The battleship is sailing
On the darkened waves of endless sea
Lay in haze, fat away from the shore
Metal plates, blazing guns
Shimmer as tarnished silver
In the grasp of agonizing sun, morbid star
Wishes death to us all.

The second day we're still alive
It was pure hell to stand that night
Our captain say he'd never seen
In all his years, waves just like these...
They strike the boards, like hungry souls
To slice our throats, to crash (sic) our bones
They champ and moan, they scream and squeal
Hysterically to get their meals

Tenth wave!!!

The crew is gone, I stand alone
On rotten wreck that's now my home
For thirteen days and dozen nights
The ocean led the men to die
They fought with teeth and claws drawn out
To see once more the sky unclouded
To feel the grass, under their feet
Today they rest in ocean deeps
They fought with teeth and claws drawn out
To see once more the sky unclouded
To feel the grass, to walk the ground
Their bodies are scattered miles around

Tenth wave!!!

Like all the demons of the sea
Arrive to put me on the knees
To steal my soul to ocean deeps
The gods of fate are set to kill

This is the end, I am the past
I dared to live in Kingdom Death
I saw the sharks torn off their flesh
I an the next one on the dish
I hear as Moon is calling me
Beneath the surface of the sea
The thirteenth night has came, I've lost
That goddamn ship to Wreckage Ghost

Tenth Wave !
