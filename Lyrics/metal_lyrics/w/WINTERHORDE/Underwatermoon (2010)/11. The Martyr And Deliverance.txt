Where am I now?
How, have I died?
Is this gruesome dream or underground?
Where is the sun, where are the stars?
They vanished behind! 
Oh! 

This endless dawn
Where, am I alive? Was it a lie?
Will I see the night and open skies?
Perhaps I am blind? Could I be blind?
Though open my eyes!
But there I see - a star is shining
So bright, I can't bare (sic) its light

One star 
On the dakrest of skies
One soul 
As alone as mine
I believe it now!

Martyr I tread the sands of death
I feel no pain or fear
The lifeless corpse with rotten soul within
Moon by moon, the torments path
New scenes of hell revealed
I'm cursed to find the celestial one
In those gloomy, suffocating deeps

Oh, deliverance
I hear the angels call but,
Heavy chains of burden pull me down
Oh no, my mind in trance
Will I see the light of day,
Until the underwater moon is shining?

Martyr I tread the wasted lands
Of riffs and dancing sand
Inside me raging emptiness
When night is dying slow
And nothing seems to change
I'm damned to find deliverance

Martyr
Deliverance
