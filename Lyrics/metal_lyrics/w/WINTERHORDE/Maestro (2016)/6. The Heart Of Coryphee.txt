In the darkness, deadly silence
Years come to rust among these walls
There's a closet, full of moth
It's rotten and old, like all this world
Deep inside, in the secret drawer
Gathering dust for more than decade
Lays the present from beloved
Once corps-de-ballet, now coryphee

In the darkness, deadly silence
Years come to rust among these walls
There's a closet, full of moth
It's rotten and old, like all this world
Deep inside, in the secret drawer
Gathering dust for more than decade
Lays the present from beloved
Once corps-de-ballet, now coryphee

As evening dies in lantern lights
The ballet starts to come to life
All Prague's elite is here tonight
To feast upon the swan's demise

As sharp as dagger
The baton is ready for attack
Unleash the anger
Straight into the bottom of her heart

Without feelings
The only force that drives you- hate
White swan is bleeding
Her blood is your power to create

As sharp as dagger
The baton is ready for attack
Unleash the anger
Straight into the bottom of her heart

Do you remember how we used to be?
Waiting for the sunrise in the mist
I'm seeing it so clearly in my dreams
Before you left and took away this bliss
The voices told me that you have to die
So, see you someday on the other side
You will dance with angels tonight
While I supposed to run away and hide

As sharp as dagger
The baton is ready for attack
Unleash the anger
Straight into the bottom of her heart
