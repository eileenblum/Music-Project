I am the wind, that howls in water spouts
And hides in tress
I am the swish of falling on the ground
Brown maple leaves
Like a restless child, who fears to walk alone
These somber streets
I'm back again to the place where I belong
But no one's there to answer my "Hello"
And nothing left, but a fierce October cold

Cold is the earth for the vermin
Cold is the earth for those, who are from below

One shot for courage, another for the road
The night is dark and cold, excitement overload
Shadows are growing in the Opera House hall
The time is running low, the time to start the show

As eleven times in row
Ancient clock rang on the wall
Five dozens, dressed as one
Has appeared like ghastly swarm
Take their seat and warm the hands
Grand orchestra of the dead
Chattering teeth, they cry for warmth
It's too cold for them on Earth
Light the candles and decor
Let them burn for evermore

Cold is the Earth for the vermin
Cold is the Earth for those, who are from below
