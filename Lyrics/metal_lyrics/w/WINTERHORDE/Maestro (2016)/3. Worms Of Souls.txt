I saw two angels with the burning torches
Stand before me
Their flashing light was cutting through my eyes
They grabbed my dormant body into chariot of fire
Injected poison into vein
And struck with lightning through my heart

Won't you say your prayers, father?
For my flesh is dying
Watch my spirit is flying higher
While my heart is food for worms of soul

Worms of soul
Worms of soul

White maggots crawling through
The black necrotic frozen tissues
Devouring lifeless skin
Engulfed by flies
I fell the stench of death
But nurses say, "It's only visions."
I'm trapped within a dream
As someone else is playing with my mind

Yellow walls
Overdose
Out of mind and beyond
No control
Haloperidol
And the worms are gone

In professional terminology,
This case is referred to
So called "Somatic Delusions"
Where affected individual
Typically complains of infestation,
Deformity or ugliness of body parts...

Yellow walls
Overdose
Out of mind and beyond
No control
Haloperidol
And the worms are gone

Worms of soul
Worms of soul
