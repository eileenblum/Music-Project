Through the Opera House narrow corridors
He walks alone
Leaving an empty stage and vivid lights
Forty three years old, but nobody's at home, as he returns
To drink his desperate love away tonight
As every other night....

God has turned your back to me
Why can't you see?
I'm alone in this world
And this world is so cruel to me
Ah... Broken fantasies
Torn in between
The embodied dreams and illusive reality

Boring Hell
Satan asked for an orchestra
Boring Hell...

Giving a languid glance at gathering fancy crowd
As every night
In the royal box, like the ghost from distance past
Her precious and indifferent face in a faded light

Like an ancient mask
Had blown his mind away with sudden blast
Forgotten pain of lust...

Under the autumn skies of Prague
Completely wet and drunk
On roof, concealed by rain and fog
Speaks tete-a-tete to God
"I begged for mercy every night
But you denied my call
You're deaf and selfish Antipath
Let Satan take my soul"

God has turned your back to me
Why can't you see?
I'm alone in this world
And this world is so cruel to me
Ah... broken fantasies
Torn in between
The embodied dreams and illusive reality

Boring Hell
Satan asked for an orchestra
Boring Hell...
