I see the skies are torn like an old photograph apart
By serpentine of stars and red industrial lights
Insomnia is my only friend tonight
Come drown with me in this Bohemian wine
As attic walls are closing in 
Room is full of smoke
No air to breathe
Dark Stygian sights
Enshroud me from behind

They came with eyes of fire
And burned my soul inside
All dreams and memories
Are gone like bitter smoke of white
They came with eyes of fire
Like needles through the spine
And left my hollow shell
To merge with cold celestial darkness

I see the world is crumbling under my feet like ice
Fall into abyss of inner emptiness

Three sleepless days and nights
Of writing all in vain
Through litany and pain
From strings to humans hearts

They will remember my name

From the darkest chimerical depths of imagination
Seven figures in black came to chant in unspeakable tongues

Genius' way mus be covered with suffering and bane
Everything starts when the nothingness ends

Three sleepless days and nights
Of writing all in vain
Through litany and pain
From strings to humans hearts
The Master heard your prayers
You're chosen for this role
He doesn't want your soul
It's lifeless anyway

They came with eyes of fire
And burned my soul inside
All dreams and memories
Are gone like bitter smoke of white
They came with eyes of fire
Like needles through the spine
And left my hollow shell
To merge with cold celestial darkness

They came with eyes of fire
And burned my soul inside
All dreams and memories
Are gone like bitter smoke of white
They came with eyes of fire
Like needles through the spine
And left my hollow shell
To merge with cold celestial darkness

I see the skies are torn like an old photograph apart
By serpentine of stars and red industrial lights
Insomnia is my only friend tonight
Come drown with me in this Bohemian wine
As attic walls are closing in 
Room is full of smoke
No air to breathe
My beautiful swan
Your wings are in chains
We shall not dance again
