Out!
Never more!
Run like demon
Light!
Corridors are screaming
Air!
Smell of death
Flows along the wind
Can't escape the voices in my head are telling me to kill

The night when baton swings
Transfusing blood to suffering
Which is the key to genius reigns in me
The night a life will end abrupt by fat, the vengeful hand
Her final breath will heal
My chronic death

Crescendo pulse, heart is beating fast
The feet just found the path, led from above

Reliving humid suffocating grief of loss
Since you've been gone,
No single note I wrote
So let her go forever!

The night when baton swings
Transfusing blood to suffering
Which is the key to genius reigns in me
The night a life will end abrupt by fat, the vengeful hand
Her final breath will heal
My chronic death

The summer butterflies of past
Had burned away, turned into dust
Somatic hurricanes of lust
Abandoned empty bed

Poetic dreams
Within pathetic real
And nothing move to feel
But the heart is still going on and on and...

Diagnosis: chronic death
When your life is worse than dying
Kill to save your skin or kill yourself

Run away from paltry essence
To the worlds of scales and passages

There is harmony and no one
Stands behind your back
Chronic death
