Suburban grey,
Pariah's lair
Cocktail of sorrow and despair
I'm drinking for you

Dark-leaden clouds, October rain
Which lasts forever like this pain
I'm thinking about you

Cruel mortal love I left behind
This fall is my eternal bride
For I am her groom

Tomorrow I'll forget your sight
With shiver waiting for that night
When I'm leaving you

Fire!
Embrace me with your flames
Give me all your warmth and strength
That drive me to create
Almighty fire!
Release me from this dream
Satan pulls my nerves like strings
In hellish symphony

I'm tired of being a clown, a barren shadow
Joker in the hand of diamonds
I'm fed up with you
Where yesterday's profane was scorned
Tomorrow's master takes his throne
I've seen it all through the eyes of...

[2x]
Fire!
Embrace me with your flames
Give me all your warmth and strength
That drive me to create
Almighty fire!
Release me from this dream
Satan pulls my nerves like strings
In hellish symphony

Fire!
