"That night in Prague was warm and loud
Old firefighters said with pride
Orchestra could not make a sound
Unless he burned it all around"

In the ashes, the orchestra still playing
To bid the farewell to the fallen soul
In the ashes, the trumpets blow fanfares
To celebrate the new Maestro's birth

Ashes in the sky
Adorned this grim October eve
Flames are raging high

As pillars are falling on their knees
Cinders cracking moan
In consonance with howling winds
Satan and his entourage
Just left this bloody feast

In the ashes, the orchestra still playing
To bid the farewell to the fallen soul
In the ashes, the trumpets blow fanfares
To celebrate the new Maestro's birth

Dancing in flames, we'll be together again
