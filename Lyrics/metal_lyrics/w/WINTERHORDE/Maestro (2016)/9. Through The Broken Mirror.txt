Take a look in the mirror
What did you expect to see there?
Piteous shadow or brave childhood's hero
Lonely aging comes from nowhere
Spirit fumes wake the ulcerous hunger
Dusty shelves are just like salt on the wound
Everything is dead, but the anger
Born to light from it's cancerous womb

No return to this life, it's too late
No regrets for this miserable fate
In this world of Materia, we are all slaves
Of mental decay
No more fear of the new coming day
No more care what the others will say
The reflection in fragments of mirror will show
The time of your play

You won't reach to the stars
Standing on crumbling chair
Envy cockroaches and mice
For no burden to bare
And the hunger prevails
Piercing the guts like a nail

Like a primordial beast
Chase the prey on the run
One inaccurate step
And you bleed on the ground

Disgraceful blunder
Has marked "eleven" on your forehead

"No return to this life, it's too late
No regrets for this miserable fate
In this world of Materia, we are all slaves
Of mental decay
No more fear of the new coming day
No more care what the others will say
The reflection in fragments of mirror will show
The time of your play..."
