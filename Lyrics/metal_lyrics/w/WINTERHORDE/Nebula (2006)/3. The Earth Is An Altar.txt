Rats of the slavery, wounds of the whip
Betrayers are feasting the innocent's guilt
No fruit's forbidden, the new idol enthroned
Degradation

Scent of the burial ground in the air
Hybrid deceases (sic), suffocating of spheres
War of millenium, infection of seed
There is no future

The earth is an altar
The earth is an altar

The is a beast inside my mind
On his trigger sick mankind
No will, no future, iron chains
The earth is an altar
The earth is an altar...
Die

Spreading our hate under banners of pure
With honor we'll fight more then (sic) flesh can endure
When the man falls on his knees there's no cure
The earth is an altar

I see the people as herd of the sheep
Celestial shepherd crucified like a thief
Waiting for victim to be scarified
The earth is an altar

In our eyes - hellish fire
In our souls - morbid skies
In our hands - pure damnation
In our hearts - brutalized

The earth is an altar
The earth is an altar and it will be burned

"We will change the World's orders
We will put the end to chaos and desperation
We will breed the spirit of purity and forgotten glory
For all who have lost the belief in justice and better life..."
