I am the cancer of human race
I am the evil that dwells inside
I am your death when you alive
I am your worm when you are dead

Serpent spelt the blood of shepherd on my hands

World of nebula world of your infernal dreams
Lust for fever opened eyes but you can't see
Blood of shepherd I am your eternal sin

Blood of shepherd on my hands...

I am the gore in your angel's eyes
I am your blood, betraying you on snow
I am your thirst when the throat is dry
I am your barbed wire when you have to run 

Behold! The blood upon my hands
The witness of your will
In flames to pay your price, you're damned
A wounded beast the Cain's strain
May your flesh rot down in here?
But souls forever burn in hell....

I am your conscience when you kill
i am your nails when you (sic) crucified
I am your reason for suicide
I am your rusty blade which cutting down your veins

Serpent spelt the blood of shepherd onto hands

World of nebula world of your infernal dreams
Lust for fever opened eyes but you can't see
Blood of shepherd i am your eternal sin
Blood of shepherd fuck your lord with blasphemy 

Fuck your lord with blasphemy...
