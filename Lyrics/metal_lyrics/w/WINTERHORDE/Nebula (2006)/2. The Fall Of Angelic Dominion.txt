"...When the Nebula descended upon the Earth
Came grace and enigmatic silence
...and Winter reigned it's throne
Forever..."

Thy marble glance of darkened eyes
Regained guilt of paradise
The fear and chaos, thorns with spikes
Were demonized, this is demise

Another sun, but the same light
Another day, but the same fight
Another god, but the same fear
A razor, veins, the end is near

The fall of angelic dominion
We celebrate where angels die
The fall of angelic dominion
They're paralyzed and fall like stars

Upon the shores of endless time
With pride we stand
We hold the power
As lucid sun is setting down
Thy lord has gone with tragic final

The bloody clouds and black horizon
Will turn the page and god has gone
And melancholic dark malice 
Embraced it's (sic) throne, satanic throne

I see what have never seen before
Is it a harmony or war?
Or kind of magic in my eyes
This is demise?

The fall of angelic dominion
We celebrate where angels die
The fall of angelic dominion
They're paralyzed and fall like stars

Awaking from eternal sleep
Forgot my name oh... who I am?
Or am I mask without a face?
Or am I him?
