Paint the face of god
With eyes of suffering
Woth colors made of blood
And mixed with dirt of war

Paint the world in white
As white as winter snow
Forever fighting for
Supreme serenity

Avenge with hatred destroy their mind 
Avenge with hatred kill their god

I will hold forth from the mount of my hate 
So all the secret born, bastard sons will hear my pain
Engrave this world on marble scrolls, on heaven's doors
So they remember all forever on

Paint the crystal stars
Are flickering our way
Our way to victory
In the name of pride

Avenge with hatred destroy their mind 
Avenge with hatred kill their god

All races of the world, orphaned children of the god
Born enslaved to self destruction
Your hate is all you've got, in your flesh you slowly rot
Grim decades of degradation

Scum of dying generation
Scum of dying generation

Saint hate pain decadence
Death is a proud way to victory
Faith slave wrath desecrate
God brings war
So join our... hate parade
