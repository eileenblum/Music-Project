[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Javens]

Running down this maze
I'm learning the unknown, now
Reaching out the skies
My brain is looking for a guide
A promise at this stage
A vision, no lies
Racing in this maze
Feels like I'm lost, and darkness cries
Crossing the limits of my pride
Trying to believe the world
A place beyond the sky
We need to come back into the fight
Psycho maze
Psycho maze
Life is a mirror
I've been watching the rise
Of a day
Psycho maze
Psycho maze
Life is a mirror
I've been watching the rise of a day
I've never tried to be a savior
Of my strive
I've never tried to know what I mean
But maybe that
I've never tried to be a hero, I know
I've never tried to go away
We live in pain
Psycho Maze
