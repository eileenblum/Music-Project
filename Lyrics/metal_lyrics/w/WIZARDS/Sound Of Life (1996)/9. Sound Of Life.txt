[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Pedroso]

Travelling through time
Here I am I just don't know
Anybody but myself
How can I live alone
People used to sing, they sing no more
The songs of past, no time to hear
No time to hear the sound of life, the sound of life
Tell me that you'll let me hear the sound of life
Cradles without dad and mom
Poor children don't know lullaby
Of childhood like you and I
Have a nice dream and wake up
The songs from the past, no time to hear
No time to hear the sound of life, the sound of life
Tell me that you'll let me hear
Tell me that you'll let me hear the sound
I'm gonna cry it out the sound of life
