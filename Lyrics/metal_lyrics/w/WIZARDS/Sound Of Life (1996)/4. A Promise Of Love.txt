[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos]

I'm searching and looking
For the light, it must be you
I'll be there
We're at a never ending party
Smiling at an eternal spring
And the strong wind will blow again
Come back to me
The sun will no longer shine, a promise of love
Come back to me I give you no choice
It's burning in my heart
I'm searching and looking
For the light, it must be you
I'll be there
That I want to give it all to you
I wanna live my life for you, my love
I was made for you, for loving you
I can't stop believing
Now I see what it means you and me
A promise of love, my baby
I want you, I need you, I love you
