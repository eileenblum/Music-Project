[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Dalla]

They are fooling you
(Forcing their false sins)
Spreading all their blues
(Forcing their false sins)
Like a weird merchant of souls
(Forcing their false sins)
So fight
And soon your thoughts are gone
Will be all gone
Reach out, feel the fire
Find out the meaning of your life
They will be gone, forever more
You just got to fight
Vultures taking you
(Forcing their false sins)
Giant ruins of bones
(Forcing their false sins)
Like a crown of thorns
(Forcing their false sins)
So fight
