[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos]

In my dreams I can't take the spirit's way
In my mind I can feel they're left aside
I can't see anyone anywhere
The end, my friend
It's up to me to decide
I am on a dangerous way
On a dangerous way
I am on a dangerous way
Dangerous way is the only way
Dangerous way is my only way
Dangerous way is the only way
Dangerous way is my only way
