[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Dalla]

Marching in line
Souls side by side
Rise from their lairs to be lonely
Heading for nowhere
Feel they're asleep
Gotta let them
Grow like a seed
Sinking in pride
Future deny they crucify
We know they will swallow their pride
Wizards rise again
From their eyes a stain for
The ones in pain, see their pain
