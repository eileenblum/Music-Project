[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Pedroso]

I can't believe, why don't you trust me?
Every night feeling so lonely
I believe you'll trust in me someday
I can't believe, why did you trust him?
All the lies, envy and rage
I believe you will forget him someday
I'll believe
I'll believe somehow
Strong is the doubt in my way
My way
