[Music by Passos]

I'm without your pretty world that
Belongs to a nice reality
Belongs to, belongs to a safe world
A safe world with pride and glorious hope
I believe, I believe in hope
Surrounded by mistakes, I have no chance
To change my world
To change my real world
Surrounded by mistakes, I have no chance
To change my world
Black city
Black city runs inside my veins
Black city
Black city and I
