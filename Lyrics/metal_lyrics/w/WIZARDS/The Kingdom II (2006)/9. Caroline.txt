Can't you see what it means to me?
Donât leave me alone tonight
'cause I'm in love
I am still in love with you my love

I'm gonna tell you
Right way
Tomorrow may be, may be too late
I donât wanna wait to show you

That I'm ready for more
Side by side we have love to carry on
We made the dark into the light
Now there is nothing for us to hide
Now I see the sign
I finally see the light

Caroline
I'm gonna tell you
Caroline
That I'm ready for more
Caroline
Tomorrow may be too late

Caroline
Can't you see
Caroline
I'm in love
Now I (see) the light
