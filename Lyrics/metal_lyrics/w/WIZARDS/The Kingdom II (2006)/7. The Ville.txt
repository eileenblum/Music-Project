Well that is it
Welcome to land
And now what are your plans
I am going to the ville
That's good for you
Itâs a great land
But now what are your plans
I'm going to the ville

The stop is right over there
It is the best, a magic place
I've got to catch another flight to ville
Good morning may I help you?
Yes I'm going to the ville
I've got to catch another flight to ville

Oh when did it start
Night before last
Have you been taking anything
Oh no I cant say (it), I'm not sure
I donât remember, I have no memories

Oh welcome to earth
Who are you?
What are your plans goohoo?
I want to go to ville
Thatâs good for you
It's OK
But now what are your plans?
I'm going to the ville
I'm going to the ville

Without memory
Without memory
Without brain
