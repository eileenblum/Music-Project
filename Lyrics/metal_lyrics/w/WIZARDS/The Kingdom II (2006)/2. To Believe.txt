What you gonna do for me?
What you gonna do for them?
I'm waiting for the answer all the time
Looking at the sky I pray
Praying to you lord I ask
Begging for the answer all the time
What you gonna do for me?
What you gonna do for me?
I'm waiting for the answer all the time
Can it be I'm afraid, I am afraid?

I believe in all your creation
We've to pray for our indulgence
(this) why I need to pray
(this) why I need to believe
Oh my lord
Hey you know my name
Still it is the same
You promised to me
The land of the free
So I believe in you
You promised to me
The straight of the see
The light of the sky
The way that will bring me some peace
