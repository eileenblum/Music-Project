YouÂ´ll never be the best
If you never try
I can guess
YouÂ´re afraid, I can fell in your eyes
You donÂ´t need to hide, I know you

Learning the game youÂ´re gonna be yeah invincible
Learning the game youÂ´re gonna be invincible
You only have to play the game

TheyÂ´ll become your slaves.....my king
TheyÂ´ll become your slaves.....my lord
TheyÂ´ll become your slaves...you know

YouÂ´ll never be the best
If you never try
I can guess
YouÂ´re afraid, I can see in your eyes
You donÂ´t need to hide, I know you

You always change your mind
I canÂ´t understand why
Why you believe in everyone who plays the game?
The game of life that I told you
You only have to play this game

TheyÂ´ll become your slaves.....my king
TheyÂ´ll become your slaves.....my lord
TheyÂ´ll become your slaves...you know

You only have to play the game
