Just take a look around your world
You gotta leave it all behind you (yeah)
Just take a look around your life
You gotta live it all behind you (yeah)

You have to work hard, sometimes  bleed
But in the end you re gonna win
Oh I'm not lying
Oh I'm not lying
You have a friend
Thatâs gonna help you always

Thereâs only one
One way for you
You got to believe yeah
Please can't you see?
This is your last chance
Show me your pride
Again
