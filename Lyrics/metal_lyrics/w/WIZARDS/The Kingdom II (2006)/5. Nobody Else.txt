I'd like to run away from you
But I can't
I'd like to go to another world
But I can't..
You make me sad
You makeâ¦ me cry
You make me mad
You make me die
Please set me free

When I gave you my heart and my soul
I yearned for your love
When I gave you my heart and my soul
I waited for you

I love you more than myself
I'm being so crazy
I donât care about nobody else

I felt my heart start to cry when I look in your eyes
You are the reason I wake up everyday

I love you more than  myself
Iâm being crazy
I love you so much
You stoled my soul
Oh oh oh

Please set me free
Please set me free
