You are longing for me
And I knew that will be long together
As the world turns around
And the distance made itself much closer

Felling you closer everyday
I'm longing for you
And the world is turning, love is burning
Time is running onâ¦ onâ¦ and on on and onâ¦.

Keep on loving me
Keep on dreaming high
And eternally
It will be you and me

Won't the memories fade away
When the breeze remain a silent prayer
I remember the love we had
And I dream of you coming home

Keep on dreaming high
Keep on loving me
Till the end of times
It will be you and me
Till the end of times

It will be forever forever more
