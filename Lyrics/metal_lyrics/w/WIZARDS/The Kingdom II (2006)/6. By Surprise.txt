Come on we can find
Find a way

Weâll open the door
Breaking the law
I'm gonna take you by
Take you by surprise
I donât wanna wait
Wait another day
I'm gonna take you by
Take you by surprise
I donât wanna lose you

I donât wanna wait
I donât wanna wait another day
I'm gonna take you by

Take you by, surprise!!!!!!!
