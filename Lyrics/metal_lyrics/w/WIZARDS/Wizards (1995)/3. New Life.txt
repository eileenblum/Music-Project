[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Xavier]

Just take a look around the
World and what do you see
Death surrounds our lives
And we always have to fight
Fight for a new life
Fight for survival
Every place you walk,
You walk alone
In a place of death your
Body turns into bone
You couldn't think,
You couldn't walk,
You couldn't talk
Say your pray and save
Your life for you
Have to find a new life
Pray and fight, use your might
For us you are always demed a guide
Pray and fight, use your might
For us you're always guide
Let me offer you my prize
