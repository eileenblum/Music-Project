[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Pedroso]

No more, explosions by the Jewish doors
No more, fear in the air
No more, anguish in the heart of the earth
No more, hungry mouth crying for feed
No more, fighting for your meal
No more, anguish in the heart of the earth
Can't live like this, no more
In this terrible way, who can show us a light
Show me why, come on, oh, Lord!
Haven't you time to be fair?
Just shall, not deny
Get in line, feel the sign
Can you forgive a lonely soul?
Right to the end
How can the future be fair?
Just live, are we at the point of no return?
We're living on the edge
