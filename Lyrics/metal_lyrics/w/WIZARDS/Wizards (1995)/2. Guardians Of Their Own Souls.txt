[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos]

Here is the magic mirror
I can't believe it's happening now
Here is the reason of my life
I'm working on being mad
And as these days go by
A cold fever reaches
My soul no, no, no ...
See the losers winning
Now they're not afraid anymore
Hope was always in
Their hearts to be
Guardians of their own souls
Trying to keep alive fighting to be ...
Right, I can feel it come
From nowhere
Crawling around , I can feel it come
I can feel it come to be our guide
