[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos, Waisberg &amp; Stulman]

I can't remember how many times I've
Looked to the sky
My pangs of death return stronger
And I need to scream it out
What's the best solution?
What am I gonna do?
Triumph is next to me I can
Lose the real chance
To show my endless power for
Everyone who won't believe in me
I have a mission that's gonna alter the
Meaning of your thought
And it will show the wizardry
That ever lived with
Wizard's age, wizard's dreams
Wizard's law, wizard's face
In the wizard's kingdom the white magic
Is the air you'll ever breathe
And the feeling surpasses the run for
Money and the run for evil power
It's time for revolution
The wizard's gonna lead
Triumph is next to me
I can't lose the real chance
To show my endless power for
Everybody who won't believe in me
I have a mission that's gonna alter
The meaning of your thought
And it will show the wizardry
That ever lived with
Wizard's age, wizard's dreams
Wizard's law, wizard's face
The world has another son
Certainly you'll hear about them
The magic is your flame
They are ... The Wizards
Along the time the things you wanted
Happened lucidity in this world
You remain thinking of the
Meaning of the errand
And you won the hellish fight
