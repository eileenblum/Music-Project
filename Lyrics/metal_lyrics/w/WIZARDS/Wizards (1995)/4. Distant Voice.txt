[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Pedroso]

A song came from nowhere
I don't know why lies inside my head
Talking about love
A distant voice saying you
Must wait for him
To look inside his pure love
And see how he cares ...
Love me crazy
You gotta leave it all behind you
Forget your sorrows
You gotta leave it all behind you
Like a poem that believes
In a dream come true
Like a shout in the dark
Waiting for somebody to hear me
Living, not to easy for me now
He'll make me good, a real
Reason for my life go on and go
Looking back in the mirror
Pray for mercy to my Lord
My way, the only way
He'll come back in my mind
Love me crazy
You gotta leave it all behind you
Forget your sorrows
You gotta leave it all behind you
Like a poem that believes
In a dream come true
Like a shout in the dark
Waiting for somebody
Love me crazy
You gotta leave it all behind you
Forget your sorrows
You gotta leave it all behind you
Like a poem that believes
In a dream come true
Like a shot in the dark
And no one hear my cry in the night
Lord, can you hear me?
Please rescue me
But there is a time that we
Make mistakes in our lives
