[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Pedroso]

You can live without love
You can live without fate
You can rise and fall
You can grow old
Life is short, not always sweet
You must work, sometimes bleed
But in the end you can find
The reason of your life
On your knees you will
Pray for your soul's sake
On, on your knees you
Will pray to your own God
Rock and roll forever
Rock and roll forever
Pray by my side, pray to your God
You know, my friend
Rock and roll never dies
