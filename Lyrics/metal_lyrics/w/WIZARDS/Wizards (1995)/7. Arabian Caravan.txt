[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Pedroso]

Living to fight for gold
Running through unknown sands to
Reach the bright soul
Breaking rules and walks,
Warring for pleasure
Trusting on the stars
Ride the wind away, war time
Comes and vanishes just
Like dust storms, see footsteps
Blown out from the sand
Ride, the desert can reap you tonight
This is the time to hunt for gold
No one can stop them now
Guided by stars in the sky
Die and praise the blood, enemy
Run to live, to survive
During the evil storms
Collecting treasures
To reach the bright soul
Killing like a game
They have no measures
To reach the bright soul
