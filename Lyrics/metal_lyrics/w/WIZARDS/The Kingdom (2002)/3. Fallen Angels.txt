Can you hear the call? 
Can you hear Him calling us all? 
Tons of elder souls, 
Sons of an old distant world 
Ancient fallen angels whirlwind 
We're the ones denied in paradise 

Hey ! Fallen angels fall 
Hear us shouting out loud 
Now, Fallen angels fall 
Surrender to the call 

Call of fate, Taking our wishes away 
Call of fate, Telling us this is the day 
Call of fate, Leaves us to pieces to decay 
Everlasting debt to pay ! 

If we could fool him, If we could fight 
If only shadows could bring the light 
We would alight the steps yet unknown 
Back to the light... 

When the night has come, the light has gone, we're all as one 
Fallen angels 
In agony, we're gonna be, eternally 
Fallen angels 

For when the night has come 
And when the light has gone 
We're gonna be as one 
Fallen angels 

Living in agony 
We'll always gonna be 
Now and eternally, 
Fallen angels fall, fall, final helping call ! 

Falling down, falling down, falling down 
Falling overboard into the seas of doubt, into the seas of doubt ! 
Falling down, falling down, falling down 
Falling overboard into the seas of doubt, into the seas of doubt ! 

Hadn't heard the call, wouldn't have had to fall 
Now we've lost it all 
Nothing's left and time has passed us by 
Haven't got a door to the room before 
Heaven yet adored 
Ain't no turning back, it's all past now
