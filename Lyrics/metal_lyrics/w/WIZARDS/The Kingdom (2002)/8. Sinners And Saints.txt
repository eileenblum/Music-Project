Right from an ancient time 
Crawling through ages I might bring the light 
Hiding in wrecked shrines 
So that by pieces combined I could rise 

The time has come, stare and behold 
My shining coach of gold 

Sinners and saints exchanging holy domains 
Dark and light blending into me 
Sentenced by thy pleas I have come 
Say thy prayers 

Those who can, join in my cast 
'Cause forever the play is bound to last 
Live the part you're to play, rise and decay 
For the story I tell brings the light, believe me 

Through a hundred thousand years I have come 
And the pieces all combined merge into one 
Sinners and saints, dark and light 
And the play I've come to show is bound to last 
For the day has come for me to bless the cast 
Sinners and saints, dark and light 

Fools shall be wise, sinners and saints arise 
To redeem in delight 
Dark and light blend into me 
I will now ease you of pain 
For I have come, rise and pray
