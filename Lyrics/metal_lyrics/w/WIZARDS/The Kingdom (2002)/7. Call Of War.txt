Another soldier 
Another hopeless wasted life 
Now you are told what to do 
A mental boiler 
Melting the weak and troubled minds 
In need of hearing the call 

The call of war 
You're in need of hearing the calling of war 
The call of war 
You're in need of hearing the calling of war 

Now you are blinded 
And you can't tell what's right or wrong 
You got a lot to regret 
You speak through others 
They speak through you, that's all you've got 
You hear the call in your mind 

The call of war 
You're in need of hearing the calling of war 
The call of war 
You're in need of hearing the calling of war 

And at night when all the lights are out 
You may think of all that could have been 
If you only had another chance 
Would you have made it just the same? Just the same? 

The call of war 
You're in need of hearing the calling of war 
The call of war 
You're in need of hearing the calling of war
