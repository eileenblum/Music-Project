Epic golden deeds 
The blood of warriors now is feeding the dry seeds 
A hundred thousand bodies 
Rest and rot in peace 
Too many battles had been lost but not this one 
The army is about to be crowned, to be remembered 

Distant foreign land 
From where the soldiers came to step onto our sand 
The golden coins were bright and 
Fed their starving eyes 
Now the clay fortress is about to kneel and die 
The foretold kingdom has arrived though many souls died... 

Dividing, uniting 
Conquering, taming and ruling 

Gathered in a feast 
The raging anger was well hidden in the mist 
For many centuries we'd 
Known the secret rhymes 
To sing together when the moment showed the signs 
We fought the battle brave and wise 
Defeating evil lies.... 

Dividing, uniting 
Conquering, taming and ruling 

Dividing, gotta fight, got the right, got the might 
Uniting, conquer the clay fortress by the night 
Taming and ruling, yeah! 
The secret rhymes, the showing signs, so brave and wise 
Threatening lies forever doomed 
Tales of epic golden deeds, yeah 
The threatening lies are doomed, 
Now that the kingdom's arrived 
Taming and ruling
