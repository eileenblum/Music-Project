Dark and shiny though far and close 
Hiding in the thoughts yet it shows 
Travelling in the speed of light 
Where all sadness become delight 

Death and mercy show tears and laugh 
All in one to end at last 
Ride, riding the might 

Distant echoes hardly ever heard 
Sounding so crystal clear to me 
In this timeless charade I live 
And this fearless belief I breathe 

Heal and hurt while come and go 
Oh, embrace and disgrace the world 
Ride, riding the might 

Riding the twilight 
Riding the twilight 
Riding the twilight 
Riding the twilight till the morning light. 

Fire and lighting from above are shown 
And the one last drop of consciousness left 
Has me do what I hadn't ever dreamt of 

Riding, riding, riding 

For the blend of light and dark I long 
And they strike on me and in one we merge 
For as long as my soul is a twilight my wounds are blessed 

Riding, riding, riding 
Look at me now 
I'm floating around 
Riding, riding, riding
