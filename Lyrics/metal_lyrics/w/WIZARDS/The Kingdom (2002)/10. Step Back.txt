Noise pollution 
Mass illusion 
Mind corruption 
All around 

Politicians 
Sacred missions, stop! 
How can we live with it all around? 

Step back! 
Give it all a thought 

All lies won't deceive us 
All cries can't convince us 
We'll fight and a new world 
Will arise 

Prejudice 
Compassion pleas 
And lack of justice 
All around 

False religion 
Blind ambition, stop! 
How can we live with it all around? 

Step back! 
Give it all a thought 

For so many years 
All we had were fears 
As a guiding line 
Now the time has come 
Wait no more
