Stillness, healing bless 
The silence leading my life 
I lay down, still and calm 
And I just keep on faking dreams 
Am I fooling myself ? 

For the silence and still fill my heart 
Living ain't fun like rest and dream 
And forevermore in the silence of daydreaming 

Sigh, take a last breath and free your mind 
Sigh, take a last breath and free your mind 

Tranquil and thankful 
I'm slowly giving in 
Now I am freed of the old days 

For the silence and still fill my heart 
Living ain't fun like rest and dream 
And forevermore in the silence of daydreaming 

Sigh, take a last breath and free your mind 
Sigh, take a last breath and free your mind 
Sigh, take a last breath...
