Words got lost in time 
So did the days of my life 
Cruel fate of mine 
To heal the wounds in my mind 

'Cause when the hope is gone, I'm alone 
Behold my dusty throne 

I'm to whom they'd bowed 
Before the cry hit the world 
All I had was sold 
Became the blood out of gold 

And in a cold recall, throw me a ball 
Dance in my wrecked hall 

My part is over now 
My heart is broken down 
Crown gone to waste 
Feelings so bitter to taste 

Farewell beloved land 
They've come and tied my hands 
Trespassed my reign 
Laughing at the sound of my name 

Pages meant to be read 
Were torn apart, look at me now 
A king without a crown 

Starving my people die 
Shadows demanding light 
How come it got this far? 
No more is for me to be done 

Deprived of all my might 
Denied the slightest pride 
Onto nowhere I roam 
To find some place and call it home
