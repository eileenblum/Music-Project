I'm living in memories 
The way that it used to be 
We tried but our try was in vain 

Our love I can still recall 
For overall I've cried 
But the silence remained 

Now the night is cold without you by my side 
'Cause from memories I know I cannot hide 
They're inside 

Calling me, haunting me 
I can't live with your voice in my mind 
Calling me, chaining me 
To my knees I face my future denied 

Still living in memories 
Old pictures of you and me 
Stilled sighs of the days you were mine 

I'm leafing through books that I keep 
Deep inside my heart 
Stories of you and I 

Now the night is cold without you by my side 
'Cause from memories I know I cannot hide 
They're inside... 

Deep in my heart I need you 
Need you by my side 
Though many miles are between us 
And though no love can redeem us 
I keep on hoping for a miracle 
And that's you... 
Stories of love to recall
