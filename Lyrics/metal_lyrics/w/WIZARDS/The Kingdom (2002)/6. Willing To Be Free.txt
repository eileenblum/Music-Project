What you wanna do 
Where you wanna go 
Who you wanna meet 
You are the one to know 

Don't let anyone 
Tell you what to do 
Tell you where to go 
Tell you who to meet 

Doin' what you want 
Goin' where you want 
Meeting who you want 
You are the one to know 

Don't let anyone 
Say what you should do 
Say where to go 
And say who to meet 

You should live 
Doing whatever you please 
Life is all you've got 
Make it the best, start living now 

Wait no more 
There is no point in feeling bored 
Let dreams lead your way 
Live for today, living for now 

And there will be no sorrow 
Leave it for tomorrow 
And all will be real in no time 
And all your dreams will be real 

No more made up fears will harm us 
No more made up sins can stop us 
We are willing to live in a free and better way
