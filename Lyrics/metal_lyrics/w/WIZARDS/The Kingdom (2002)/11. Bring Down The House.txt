[bonus track]

My thoughts are all in line deep in my blank mind 
They never show, I can't find the words 
To heal this silent world 

But if I had them brought back to me one last time 
Then I would find all the words I can't find 
And I would write the song laying asleep inside 
Deep there in my blank mind... 

Trapped in a world where I have no voice, yeah 
Not a word, not a single story 
Far away I hear people sobbing 
Oh, look at me! 

I was caught on the enemy fields 
And I can't find a way to go back 
There had been a sign I would have seen 
There had been a dream I would have dreamed 

All alone where I have no rights, yeah 
Hope is gone, the end of the glory 
Prisoner inside my own mourning 
Oh, look at me! 

I was caught on the enemy fields 
And I can't find a way to go back 
There had been a sign I would have seen 
There had been a dream I would have dreamed 

I hear a voice from far away 
But against my will I had to stay 
Every night and day wishing I were back... 
I hear a voice from far away 
But against my will I had to stay 
Wishing that I were back... 

But I will come out so strong 
That the ghosts of the failure will vanish at once 
And then the words of my song 
Will bring down the house!
