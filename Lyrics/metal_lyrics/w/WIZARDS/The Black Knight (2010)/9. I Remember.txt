[Music by Passos and Dalla]
[Lyrics by Dalla]

Always in a dome
I have lost myself and now Iâm always so alone
I have lost myself within the echoes of my home
Just the memories of the days when I could carry on

But the end has come
And the disillusions cut my flesh down to the bones
All the grand illusions have become a hiding dome
And I can no longer face the man I have become
How to carry on?

Now! I can remember now
Time, time was the loss of my hope
Oh, How could I help surrendering?
I remember

Once I had dreams to rely on
When hopes were so bright
At the reach of my hand
Nothing to fear not a tear I should face
All set in pace
I cherish deep in my heart
Those days were meant to part

Suddenly despair
Suddenly the air was bitter, more than I could bare 
Wasnât meant to be the sinner, How could no one care?
Deeply sad to see I dread the man I have become
How to carry on?

[CHORUS]
