[Music and lyrics by Dalla]

Last, oh night, as no dawn may rise 
Iâm your dream and older days I bring
Far away, where has led the way
I have come and only dreams remain

Now the willows are grown and still
And the distance has done its will
If no longer I live I can still have your kiss
Every night in your sleep

Mine are the tears in your eyes
Yours is the heat in my heart
I know time wonât be kind
And the sunlight will come at all
I curse the early dawn
For the day is so long and the waiting is so long
So please last, oh night

Last, oh night, never long for light
Rest in peace and heal my bleeding bliss
Give me time, hear this plea of mine
Bless her sigh and let me breathe inside

Now the willows are grown and still
And the distance has done its will
If no longer I live I can still have your kiss
Every night in your sleep

Mine are the tears in your eyes
Yours is the heat in my heart
I know time wonât be kind
And the sunlight will come at all
I curse the early dawn
For the day is so long and the waiting is so long
So please last, oh night
