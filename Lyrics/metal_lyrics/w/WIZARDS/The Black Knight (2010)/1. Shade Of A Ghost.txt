[Music and lyrics by Dalla]

Petals are falling! Shadows are calling!
And I can only live as a shade of a ghost

There is a garden of shadows hiding from the light
Where the reality is but a gap of days and nights
And every color is but a shade of grey
Every living leaf decays
âTill the petals fall like tears in the rain

There was a time when the moon would bring the dew so pure
And by the morning the sun would taint the skies of blue
But if the day had been longer than the night
There would be no cries inside
Now the bounds of fate are holding me tight

Now I roam and thereâs no return
Thereâs a ghost everywhere I turn
Telling of the past

The fire, the fire deprived in my soul
Desire, desire has gotten cold
The liar, the liar who stole my world
The fighter, the fighter is no longer bold

Petals are falling down
Shadows are calling now
Petals are falling down
And I can only live as a shade of a ghost

Now that the night is so stilled the dawn is pushed away
And as the shadows remain to veil the light of day
There in the blink of an eye where time got lost
Everlasting inner frost
See the will to dream about to exhaust

Now I roam and thereâs no return
Thereâs a ghost everywhere I turn
Telling of the past

[CHORUS]
