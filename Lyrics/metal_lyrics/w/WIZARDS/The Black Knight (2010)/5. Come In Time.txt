[Music by Passos]
[Lyrics by Passos and Dalla]

Iâm trying to keep alive fighting to be
The one whoâll bring your soul some harmony
But I need your help my friend
I have done all I can to save your life
And working hard I know weâll do it right
But I need your help my friend

Never give up keep believing inside
And the meaning of life will come in time

So many times you looked up to the sky
The tears you cried for all you left behind
Sometimes you have to pray
And thank for all youâre given in the end
âCause many times youâre taken by the hand
But I need your help my friend

Never give up keep believing inside
And the meaning of life will come in time
Live all the dreams you have cried for
The answers you prayed for, surrender
Theyâll come in time
