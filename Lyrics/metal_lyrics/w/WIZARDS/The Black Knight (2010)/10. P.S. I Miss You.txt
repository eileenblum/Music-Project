[Music by Passos]
[Lyrics by Dalla]

Every morning upon waking
I still wonder how youâre doing
Are you sorry? Are you happy?
Or who knows you might feel lonely
I sure do
P.S. I miss you

I go over days when you were close to me
Those are memories Iâve carried all the way
So I swear to all the angels
Should they bring you back
I would kneel and thankâem all until the end
Oh I, I miss you

From the early morning
âTill the nightfall moaning
In a restless waiting
Wishing you would come in

But if youâre not mine
I still hope youâre fine
Thatâs all.
P.S. I miss you
