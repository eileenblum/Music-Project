[Music by Passos]
[Lyrics by Dalla]

Now open your eyes, how does it feel there where you hide?
Tell me, is it cold? Has it the taste of failed hopes?
Does it have a door showing the way to evermore?
Were you all alone or were your doubts hiding along?

Tell me what itâs like
In the place you hide

In a distant inner binding
Overwhelming place you hide in
Far away from this battle strife
Does it have a shelf beside you
With your days displayed, oh can you say
What itâs like in the place you hide

I heard thereâs a wind keeping you safe, leading the way
Some say itâs your soul begging to lead you back home
Now open your eyes, how does it feel there where you hide?
Tell me, is it cold? Has it the taste of failed hopes?

Tell me what itâs like
In the place you hide
(Say what itâs like there where you hide)

In a distant inner binding
Overwhelming place you hide in
Far away from this battle strife
Does it have a shelf beside you
With your days displayed, oh can you say
What itâs like in the place you hide
