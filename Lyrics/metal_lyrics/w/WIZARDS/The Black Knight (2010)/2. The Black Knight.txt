[Music and lyrics by Dalla]

Hands towards the horizon
She is waving goodbye
Her hands are cold, her words ainât bold
An empty heart was torn apart

Her will fades out in the distance
A shadow blown in the wind
Sheâs there just waving goodbye eternally

And days and nights go by
Itâll last until she dies

Hands towards the horizon
She is waving goodbye
Her hands are cold, her words ainât bold
An empty heart was torn apart

Her will fades out in the distance
A shadow blown in the wind
Sheâs there just waving goodbye eternally

Like a still life she has nothing left inside
Just a stoned mind which of wish is now deprived
Like a black knight he went on, left her behind
See the sun rise just to praise her grief and blind her belief 

Silent as the night he stole her mind
He stole her mind
And as the days went by her eyes got dry
A thousand tears trapped in a sigh

But his geed was high, he enslaved her mind
Never let her go
But his geed was high, he enslaved her mind
Never let her go

Like a still life she has nothing left inside
Just a stoned mind which of wish is now deprived
Like a black knight he went on, left her behind
See the sun rise just to praise her grief and blind her belief
