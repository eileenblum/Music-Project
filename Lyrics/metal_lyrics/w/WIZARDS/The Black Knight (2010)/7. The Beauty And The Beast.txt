[inspired by the Jean Cocteauâs 1946 movie âLa belle et la bÃªteâ]

[Music and lyrics by Dalla]

Break the spell!
For the feather falling petals in the castle
Break the spell!
For the better never let her tear apart your heart you gotta
Break the spell
Beast of  the mirrorâs cell

I saw crystal tears on the ground
I saw misty fields all around
As a cold reflex youâve stood beyond
The beauty and the beast... you and me

Break the spell!
For the feather falling petals in the castle
Break the spell!
For the better never let her tear apart your heart you gotta
Break the spell
Beast of  the mirrorâs cell

I saw torches flaming at the gates
I saw shadows caving in my fate
As a thousand voices cried the doom
The beauty and the beast .... cease!

Oh, beloved time
Now Iâm drowning in your arms
As the petals fall
And the rust covers the crown

My hindmost hope
Come alone, come through the mist
I give my soul
To the one whoâs learned to love the beast

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
