[Music by Passos, Dalla and Quesada]
[Lyrics by Dalla]

Once again the pages turn
And itâs time of moving on
When the dawn of a new day
Seems to burst along the way

You may wish all were the same
You may curse all was in vain  
But itâs over now!

All the sorrow and the pain
Putâem back and start again
Youâd better close the door
Reset the scoring

Better forget
Better to move on than regret
Straight ahead, donât look back
Head up high!
