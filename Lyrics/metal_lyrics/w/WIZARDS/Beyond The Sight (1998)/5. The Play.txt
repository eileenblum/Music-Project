[Music and lyrics by Dalla]

Lost in the silent charade
Time is the lifeblood of fate
Calmly behind a stone face, I'm bleeding
So it's the end of the play
Packing and leaving no trace
Slamming the door of my face, I'm freezing
As all the lights fade away, I call it home
So many fighters I've played, now they're all gone
Tearing away through my heart, shadows become
And the night has begun undercut
So the stars are all falling and falling away, it's so cold
When the morning come calling my name, I'll start again
The life's play
Over and over again
I tried the harder I can
Found out the wounds were too deep, I'm bleeding
Staring at all in the eyes
Wearing the same old disguise
But all the furs were too thin, I'm freezing
As all the lights fade away, I call it home
So many fighters I've played, now they're all gone
Tearing a way through my heart, shadows become
And the night has begun undercut
So the stars are all falling and falling away, it's so cold
When the morning come calling my name, I'll start again
The life's play
