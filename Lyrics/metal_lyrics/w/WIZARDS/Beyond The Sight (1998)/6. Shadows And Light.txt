[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Dalla]

Meadows undercovered by the thinnest ice
Frozen are my blinking eyes
Wounding ways throughout the thin ice
Days ago the day ahead were but a lack
Underestimated fact
Now beliefs do hang on my back
Searching through the Lorien to find a spell
Mothermeant Galadriel
Gave away her golden leaf belt
Ashes of an elven lost nobility
Puzzled faked memory
Of the trees adorned by thee, so hear my plea
When I call down shadows and light, mornings and night
Flow in eternal glow lighting up miles away
Though dark and stilled my soul is now
I rise once again
Meadows undercovered by the thinnest ice
Frozen are my blinking eyes
Wounding ways throughout the thin ice
Ashes of an elven lost nobility
Puzzled faked memory
Of the trees adorned by thee, so hear my plea
When I call down shadows and light, mornings and night
Flow in eternal glow lighting up miles away
Though dark and stilled my soul is now
I rise once again
