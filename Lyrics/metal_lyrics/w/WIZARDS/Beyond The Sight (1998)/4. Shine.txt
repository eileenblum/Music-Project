[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Kipersmit]

Halloween
Living with no boundaries
In a dream
Walking round the memories
Halloween
Reaching for the never seen
Dreaming on
Getting used to get(ting) along
Leaving from here
Getting to know you
Carrying the light all through the night
Over and over we watch the way open
For weÂ´ll never lose
All the shine in our eyes
Over and over we show the true colors
And do it for fun and for good
Making waves
Striking every single rock
Being brave
Dreaming of the highest top
Halloween
Reaching for the never seen
Dreaming on
Getting used to get(ting) along
