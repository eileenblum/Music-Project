[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Dalla]

Thunderbolt
Clash of the tempest
And I heard the sound loudly crying:

Gather, IÂ´m the failure redeem
And the secret within
IÂ´ll be fleeting for IÂ´m everlasting
IÂ´m the shame of the proud
IÂ´m the symptom and the cure of all

IÂ´m the morming light slaved in each sunrise
And the hidden counting time bomb in your soul

I am the light slaved in each sunrise
IÂ´m a set up times bomb in your soul
