[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Kipersmit]

LetÂ´s fly all around
Get an overall view
Look down on the street
ItÂ´s so grey and rather cold
I donÂ´t want to hear the cry
Keep the light for us alive
I donÂ´t want to be vanished
See our enemy
Running aimlessly
Feel him going nuts
Can you, dare you guess the end
I donÂ´t want to hear the cry
Keep the light for us alive
Let us try to think higher
Find and assign to your mind
Something big not just light and remind
Everyone this time
I ainÂ´t safe to forget when you
Find and assign to your mind
Something big not just light and remind
That can change forever
The meaning of life
