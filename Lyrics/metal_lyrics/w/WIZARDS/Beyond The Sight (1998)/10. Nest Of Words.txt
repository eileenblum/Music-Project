[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Dalla]

ThereÂ´s a rumor rid of sound
Waiting elsewhere to be found
The day words find out itÂ´s saying
- I wander, canÂ´t find at all
ThereÂ´s a dream of color gray
Where the palletÂ´s gone astray
The night rhymes find out their saying
- I slumber, no rhyme to call
ThereÂ´s a place beyond fear
Where day light and dark night are near
ThereÂ´s a question to be asked
Where all answers wear proudly a mask
Shelter me, time ivy
Cover me fast, build me a nest
Where I can rest
Collide! (words rite)
All false and true dance into my mind
My doubts and certainties collide!
