[Music and Lyrics by Dalla]

Older was the way I couldnÂ´t recall
Stilled I keep forgetting all but the fall
Lacking of a time when silence was free
And all was meant to be
Blown against the wind my words were in vain
Faded like a rainbow build in the rain
And wordless I flirt with the wind
For memories I need another day of cloudy gray
I grab all ages gone with the wind
IÂ´ve been denied the light of primal dream
I lay awake, the morning breaks
When suddenly I find out itÂ´s too late
I ran away, fallen disguise
The days are left in shadows of the night
Falling, calling: Lead me home
Holy home in Avalon
Falling, crawling: Outta home
Show me holy Avalon
Older was the way I couldnÂ´t recall
Faded like a rainbow build in the fall
Lacking of a time when silence was free
And all was meant to be so 'til the end, to promise land
The rivers in my eyes will long and tend
The curtain falls, IÂ´m in the crowd

I had it all and now I'm all without.
