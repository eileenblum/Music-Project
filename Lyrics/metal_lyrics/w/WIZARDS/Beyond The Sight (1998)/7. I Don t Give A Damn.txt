[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Passos &amp; Dalla]

You need to be the winner
Is what I always have been told
It's been a long hard road
And so the race is over (now)
I didn't win the cup of gold
They never taught me so
And won't they ever realize
That it don't matter if I'm first
Or if I'm last in the line
It's not a game of right or wrong
A game of peace, a game of war
But I got to say:
I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn
Don't tell me how I should be
You are out of your mind
I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn
Cause I don't care what you say
You are loosing your time
