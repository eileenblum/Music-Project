[Music by Passos, Lyrics by Dalla]

By the open door, saw you walking off
As the morning broke I was alone
Not a single note, not a last good lie
Just another hope waving good-bye
Broken hearts playing lonely parts
What am I supposed to hang on to?
How could I pretend to be all right?
Closed eyes to so many fights
Never thought that it could get this far
Hurry home, just say what you want
And IÂ´ll know what I gotta do
Because IÂ´d move the mountains
Never-ending loveÂ´s a killing blues
If you ask for the fountain
Of eternal youth, I would give
And over is my part, my broken heart
I close my eyes, so many fights
Never thought itÂ´d gotten this far
