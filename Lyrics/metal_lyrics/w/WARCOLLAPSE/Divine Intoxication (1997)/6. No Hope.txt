You can't fool no one... death is near
See it in your eyes... filled with fear
Despair over life... no dreams are left
Living in the dark... nothing left

[Chorus:]
Keeping up the mask
Dying slow
Burning up inside
Devouring glow

Time is over... time to give up
Praying for release... Christian crap
Laying on your bed... moaning in fear
Where is God now?... he was never there
