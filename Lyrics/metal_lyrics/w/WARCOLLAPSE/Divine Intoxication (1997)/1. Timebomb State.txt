Sirens scream hunting blue cars
In panic people run in city wars

[Chorus:]
This societic timebomb state
Self-destroys in murder and hate

The alarm is set to detonate
How much more can we take?

Violence keeps pressure maintained
Masses can see no end
Arrested citizens are found dead
Rubricated as legal bloodshed
