I can barely catch my breath
A will to lay and rest
Shivers in my chest
The locked door draws my glance
Am I finally safe
It has been a long dance
Now it's time for acceptance

Without any question
You stir my obsession
Soft transgression
I am your possession
Invading your discretion
Bleak confession
You're my sweet depression

What shall I give to end my pain
What can I do so far from rain
How can I be with him again
Memories I should have slain
Are buried in my brain
Lost between grief and bargain

A thirst of psychopath
Like a spell has been cast
On me to last
Fighting for outlast
I am an outcast
My heart of glass
Has been shattered by my wrath

I refuse to be shy
Let me go in a sigh
I can't trust my eyes
Ghost hands laid on my thigh
He's still here, by my side
Drowning in my deny
I'm here with you, theater of mine
