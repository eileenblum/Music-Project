What now
How dare you stop my show

Ain't you aware it was my dreams, my expectations
I've been awaken in the worst of the worlds

Let your life flow away
There will be just less in it

You dyed my soul with the venom that's killing you all
You live by clambering a pile of rotting dreams
You can't achieve the most by hoping the least

There's a fire in my eyes and in front of me
You burn to flames my past and what I have built

Let your life flow away
There will be just less in it

You dyed my soul with the venom that is killing you all
You can't achieve the most by hoping the least
