I've been hiding day and night
Alone I keep writing to clear my mind
This door is locked I can't see why
I'm not guilty, trapped in a lie

I can hear moving outside
Their trampling steps are driving me mad
The door handle shivers sometimes
And so I keep closing my eyes

Deeper and deeper I dive
In search for a place where all won't end the same

I merge myself within the night
Because growling darkness enlights my mind
They're after me, I don't know why
I should move on and flee their lie

I wish I could just run outside
Be far from here, this world looks so mad
I don't look back, I should sometimes
And so I keep closing my eyes

Deeper and deeper I dive
In search for a place where all won't end the same

I build myself among the mistakes of a world that gave me nothing
Fighting against a stream of alienating thoughts in this hopeless war

There won't be any door in my confined prison
I am my own mistakes split between light and darkness

Above a glade, the moon lights the night
With sap and dust and with my confused mind I start to draw, can't figure why
Some eerie curves as cure for lie

This glade has walls. Am I outside
It can't be Real. And if I'd have gone mad
A strange-shaped branch shivers sometimes
Maybe I should open my eyes

The door's finally opened on my confined prison
Where I'm crouched on the floor split between darkness and light
They clutched my flesh and bones dragging my spirit out
Eerie curves of my blood only remained on the ground
