You're my concealed outcast of an ignited past.
Can I be with you again, shattered theater of mine

My disclosure

Death calls, on my stained frame my ink, my blood runs
It started in a spark now it's the end of the show

Behind shivering drops of my soul
Dancing under a dry sky the void's pouring inside

My disclosure

And if I've gone mad, torn apart, who am I far from you

unveiled emotions but from the cinders
Smell of the rain awake my confined delusion

Engraved by the blade, cleansed from my mistakes,
Not able to live our life, I give up, I resign

I wish we could share one more breath
I'm unborn and hollow in your absence
Far from rain I die
