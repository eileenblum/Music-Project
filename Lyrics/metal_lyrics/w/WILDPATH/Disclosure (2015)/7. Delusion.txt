You make me crawl but my body ain't my soul
Can't you see I can't change, your chemical cage is pointless
You're afraid by what you can not restrain
Just a shadow behind what you have chosen not to be

In my veins, your truths are poisoning my heart
Turning cold. Shall I fight in your faithless trial

Did you ever look at what we've built
While you were lost in your dreams
Alone in your world, you're no help for others
How can you believe you see while everyone's blind
How can you struggle while I try to save you

There's shapes and lights leaking out of my mind
Whispers of schizotypy go thought the walls of my cell
Emotion, twin sister of delusion
Leans on the crackled branch of my neurosis
Torn apart

World's a stage and my lies are stories to me
Where'd I go if I'd let the curtain fall

Did you ever look at what we've build
While you were lost in your dreams
Alone in your world, you're no help for others
How can you believe you see while everyone's blind
Your sick sight can be cured

But did you ever look at what we've built while
You were lost in your dreams
Alone in your world, you're no help for others
How can you believe you see while everyone's blind
How can you struggle while I try to save you

In my veins, your truths are poisoning my heart
Turning cold, shall I fight in your faithless trial
