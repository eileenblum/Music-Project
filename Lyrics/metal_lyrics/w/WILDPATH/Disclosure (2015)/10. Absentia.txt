Sitting with him while you(re away
My unknown man with bleeding heart

I can't get your out of my head
Though I fear the day I'll be apart
In front of his door you shout and stand
Please be forever gone when it opens

With him
I feel safe
I dive
In his arms
He cries
In this rain
We die

You follow me on every way
Alone with you, I dream, I faint

I am deafened by your torture
I am defined by your nature
I am the doll that shares your room
I am the puppet of your wrath

Near you
I am scared
I drift
In your embrace
You are
Absentia
My love

Far from sense you've torn my world

As I wait endlessly for you to come
Here I remain among the decaying shades
I witness the world fading to nothingness
Memories and stories born in your absentia
