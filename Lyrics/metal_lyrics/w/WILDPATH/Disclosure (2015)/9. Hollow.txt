Embers and flames into your eyes set ablaze my skin
Each and every time you lay them upon me

Shattered tears scarring my face drops of dying truths
Gathered in an embrace when it rains upon you

I wish we could share one more breath
I wish you could give me one more chance
Behind the wall, Begging forgiveness
You are my love, my other self

If I go, will you follow
I'm leaving you, hollow

I'm alive but to you I'm nothing else but a shape,
I have to step away from you for you to go, for you to mourn

After what I've glanced, what I've witnessed you still ignore me
Deep in your cell you still stand in our hearth

Keep wondering if you survived running away from me
Dripping on a blank frame your wrist has stained my heart

I wish we could just share one more breath
I wish you could give me one more chance
Behind the wall, begging forgiveness
You are my love, my other self

I'm alive but to you I'm nothing else but a shape,
I have to step away from you for you to go, for you to mourn

I wish we could just share one more breath
I wish you could give me one more chance
Behind the wall, begging forgiveness
You are my live, my other self

If I go

Will you follow

I'm leaving you

Hollow
