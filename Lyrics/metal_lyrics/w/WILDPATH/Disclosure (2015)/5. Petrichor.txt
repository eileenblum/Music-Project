Last call
Cold lasts
The void is pouring inside
Time has collapsed
One more breath to share

The world bleeds
Dancing while
We are just begging forgiveness

My rough guilt
Has been drained
My only remaining piece of insanity

You're lost in my past
I cry under a dry sky
Waiting for the fall

Against the time
I with to turn back this world
Where hope rise from dust
I learn from regrets, my backward mistakes
Forgive me

Against the time
I've turned back
How hope turns to dust
I've learned
Living regrets, mistakes
Forgive me

Between ebb and flow
A lone star breaks the shadows
Vanishing lights
As we are
Gathered in the rain

Take me into the mist
Shattered drops of my soul
The warm embrace of
Our deepening hearth stirs our fate
Reality falls upon your legacy
Behind the wall
A shivering candle
A moving door
