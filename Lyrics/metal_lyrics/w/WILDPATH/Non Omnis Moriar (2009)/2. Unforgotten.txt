Crystal panes shiver under a pouring rain
The large hall is lifeless and I'm alone
Lost in the unknown in search for a sign
Breath of death has blown life from the huge hall's tree

Under the glimmering candle lights I glimpse dancing shadows
Am I sleeping
May my deepest fears not to become real
House is calling me I must unearth its secrets

May unforgotten ghosts open the gates of my mind
I've to find the keys of my fears
Storm in my soul I mean to rest in peace
Within my darkness I claim for light

I'm afraid, I have opened Pandora's box
I'm doomed, I have to face its nightmares
In my twisted reality
Inwardly screaming
Resigned to dare further

May unforgotten ghosts open the gates of my mind
I've to find the keys of my fears
Storm in my soul I mean to rest in peace
Within my darkness I claim for light
