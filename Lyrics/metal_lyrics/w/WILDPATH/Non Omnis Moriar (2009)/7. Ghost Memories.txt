Ghost, I am dead but this child is alive
Tell me again, there's a realm beyond the stars
In my mind, so much tales that are fading away
Damn my ghost memories cause the stories never end

I just want to close my eyes, so I won't see
My life's just a dark path, indeed
I can't stand this fate, faceless faith
As doomed butterflies in a chest

I just want to sleep and dive in my dreams
In a world where hope has a meaning
Please tell me again your story
Just to get back forsaken feelings

Feel it and dream it forever, memory fantasy together
But obviously, rest into fantasy
The world has gone mad, you're right
Why should you leave ? Stay here forever lying
Back from the gloom to you're childhood

Why soul I have to choose? My passion is alive
I won't give up, carry on, itâs up to us to be freed from our fate

Non omnis moriar multaque pars mei vitabit libitinam

Oh I'm locked in the dark, a light inside my heart
Have I opened my eyes, only memories
Remain sitting with my light
I have to realize with eyes opened wide
Do I really want to leave my own dreams

And I keep closing my eyes, so I won't see
My life's just a dark path, indeed
I can't stand this fate, faceless faith
As doomed butterflies in a chest
