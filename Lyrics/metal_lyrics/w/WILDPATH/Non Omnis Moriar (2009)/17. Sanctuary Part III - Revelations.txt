Here is my place, I found it, my love's safe
Deep in my chest my shadows dance

Butterflies're turned into rays of warming light
My secrets case's filled with innocence

My unforgotten ghosts, you gave me a last chance
To unearth my light heart

Remains of lust will avoid the time engraved in your soul

Dancing with your ghosts memories
Relentless
You were my child, my porcelain doll
Destiny

You were my lover and my love burning inside me
Inside me
Death did us part but you won't die entirely
