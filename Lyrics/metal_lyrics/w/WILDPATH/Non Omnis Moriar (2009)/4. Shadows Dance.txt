Trapped in this reality. Can delight deny their foolish will
Locked in my own world fulfilled with emptiness
And I'm still here, Soul sealed in loneliness
Dismissed heart in this mess

Seeing dancing masks around me, blind figures
Deceivers cannot feel what's within me
Will somebody ask me my name
Their shadows cover and rush my flesh ... Mirrors shout at me

I'm misplaced, I lost it, I'm loveless
My eyes see the Shadows Dance around me
Let me be within my quiet place, I'm safe

My reflection in her eyes, a star's encaged
Darkness hiding the truth, could it be revealed
This little girl stares at me
The glass reveals why do I feel so scary
Let me out

I'm misplaced, I lost it, I'm loveless
My eyes see the Shadows' Dance around me
Let me be within my quiet place, I'm safe

I'm misplaced, I lost it, I'm loveless
I won't let this shadows dance without me
If I were out of my quiet place, would I be
