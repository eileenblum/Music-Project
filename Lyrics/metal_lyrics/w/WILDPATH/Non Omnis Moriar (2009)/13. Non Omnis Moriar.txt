Surrounded by books, I'm looking for just one name, just one truth
Parts of lives, forgotten
Who are you to choose who's to be forsaken

A name can open a door but your soul is its power, is its core
Awake it, make it live

Memories last forever in history individual
Has power to make a future so, memories last forever more

No one ever find a way trapped in oblivion
A piece of soul on a paper swear eternity

Relentless destiny, my words can break out of this lifetime
I won't be a slave of this fateful destiny my name can break out of my lifetime
I won't entirely die

In this gloomy library everything seems to shun, turns to dust
Seed of my own decay, under my black shell a dying angel light

Can't you see my love as the time flies
Can't you feel my will burning inside
Can't you hear the cries that I hold back
Can't you light my heart with desire
Can't you warm my skin with your touch in your memories non omnis moriar

I'm the heart of my story and the books are filled with pain, filled with hope
Butterflies, ghosts of mine you'll teach me how to face my destiny

Can't you see my love as the time flies
Can't you feel my will burning inside
Can't you hear the cries that I hold back
Can't you light my heart with desire

I have found my way freed from oblivion
A piece of life in memory swear eternity

Relentless destiny, my words can break out of this lifetime
I won't be a slave of this fateful destiny my name can break out of my lifetime
I won't entirely die

Can't you see my love as the time flies
Can't you feel my will burning inside
Can't you see my love as the time flies
Can't you feel my will burning inside
Can't you hear the cries that I hold back
Can't you light my heart with desire
Can't you see my love as the time flies
Can't you feel my will burning inside
Can't you warm my skin with your touch in your memories non omnis moriar
