Mind: a curtain hiding the fool
Blind men can't see they're doomed
Now my sanity fades to dark fantasies
Jester laugh will show us our fate

Heart: Sparkling stars outside
Sad cold and dead inside
What could I call home in this treachering world
Jester laugh will lead us to sleep

Growling behind me the beast swallowing innocence
Growing within me, sealing destiny and forget what really matters

Bring the sunrise to life
A world where feelings aren't lies

Open my eyes  to believe again
I can't breath within your darkness
My love won't burn under your rain 

Trapped in the night, the moon, my witness
At last I found it, Insanity
Blame your shadow for kneeling before me
Inside your eyes I'm your tears
I'm the blade, you're my hilt

Want to dive in my dreams
Here love blossoms on the hills

Open my eyes to believe again
I can't breath within your darkness
My love won't burn under your
Reign of terror shall end
With my tears
I'll find one way leading to four gates
That lost way I can't forget
It's hard to make a choice with wide opened eyes
