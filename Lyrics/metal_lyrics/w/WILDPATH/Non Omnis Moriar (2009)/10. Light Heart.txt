Butterflies falling from the trees
Like green ghosts keeping memories
Raining gold flowing down the blooms
Lightening my feet Dancing with the root

Feeling safe, wind has blown the clouds
My dark thoughts're away from the woods
Sanctuary, full of fantasy
Healing within me innocence relic

No fear no sorrow, my shelter is pride no more
But just true feelings

Lost I Hope I Will never get back to that home
I'm alone freed from the fate
That used to be mine

I'm under shines of fireflies
As I lay on a bed of grass
And my soul floating above me
Showing in my dreams how the world should be

No fear no sorrow, my shelter is pride no more
But just true feelings

Lost I Hope I Will never get back to that home
I'm alone freed from the fate
That used to be mine
