Deep in my heart, memories spread their wings
Tears in my eyes whisper I'm alive
I used to keep my feelings safe in an Ice Rose
Now the flower's turned to a blade

And the waves will take me on and the sky may cry and...

Shine again I have still in me so much to share
I'm afraid to go to shore

Will unknown streams bring me back to childhood
Years of madness I've crossed have left timeless scars
Is there no way to live without pain, without regret

Can you here the call of my soul that claims innocence
My dreams are not lies but promises
Can you open my secret's case buried in my chest
My ghosts became wounds, locked in my heart

Looking for light deep in the night I've lost my way
Finally I've met myself again in her little girl's eyes of porcelain
Her child heart has chased my fears away

Deep in her eyes, my future spread its wings
Her pure heart whispers I'm alive
Feelings are safe in her secret's case
Now the unknown has a name

And the waves will take her on
And the sky may cry and...

Shine again she has still with me so much to share
Not afraid to go to shore

Can you here the call of my soul that claims innocence
My dreams are not lies but promises
Can you open my secret's case buried in my chest
My ghosts became wounds, locked in my heart
