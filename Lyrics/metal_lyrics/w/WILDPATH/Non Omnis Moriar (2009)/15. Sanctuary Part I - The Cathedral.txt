With no fear, I disappear within the frame of my unconsciousness
My nightmares are my dreams in disguise
Carrying my home with their promises

From my balcony, my melancholy looks at a world I wish would be mine

So fragile happiness I mustn't stain this magic place
I'm not a part of them but I refuse to hide in loneliness

So I keep running, whatever I fear, however, I feel, I'm alive
My shadows won't dance without me

What does life mean when our dreams became true
Orphan soul with a frozen heart
Far beyond my love's gone
In the mirror widow's eyes
Tell me tales of a girl whose heart's in porcelain

So fragile happiness I mustn't stain this magic place
I'm not a part of them but I refuse to hide in loneliness

So I keep running, whatever I fear, however, I feel, I'm alive
My shadows won't dance without me

What does life mean when our dreams became true
Orphan soul with a frozen heart
Far beyond my love's gone
In the mirror widow's eyes
Tell me tales of a girl whose heart's in porcelain
