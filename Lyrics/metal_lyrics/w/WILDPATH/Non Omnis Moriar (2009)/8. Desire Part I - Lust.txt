One step ahead I fall
My loneliness in his arms, my pride

White roses turned to red
Rain hides the tears of a deceived bride

Reviving candle lights
Whispering warmth of a last embrace

One last dance tonight as our love turns to dust
One last dance to cry on faint hopes in our eyes
One last touch to hear the warm sighs of our skins
One last kiss burying remains of our lust

Take my love and I'll fill in with pain
Fallen soul, should I believe in vain

Silent as his closed sight
My memory's awake for my love's sake

Dancing with silk and spikes
I am a doll with a porcelain heart

One last dance tonight as our love turn to dust
One last dance to cry on faint hopes in our eyes
One last touch to hear the warm sighs of our skins
One last kiss burying remains of our lust

Take my love and I'll fill in with pain
Fallen soul, should I believe in vain
Take my love and I'll fill in with pain
Fallen soul, should I believe in vain

Remains of lust eternally engraved in our souls
