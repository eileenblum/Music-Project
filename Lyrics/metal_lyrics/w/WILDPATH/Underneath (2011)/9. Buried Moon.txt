No lights to guid them,
as long as the moon won't rise;
this must be an evil charm
from the lady by the lake !

She keeps on stealing starlight
reflecting from the sky.
This witch is a plague,
prevention is their duty.

Moon in the sky be our guide
and light our way through the darkness
of the night won't blind us,
as long as we'll stare at the stars !

Stars won't fall
and in the silence I will wait
for my blessing day to come !
In the depths, 
I'll dive to find my deceased light,
a moon reflecting in the sky.

Stop this masquerade
by reaching her house by the lake,
in the starlight fulfilled
museum, no one's there ...

Standing on the shore
she's pouring a shiny stream
that rekindles a sunken moon
reflecting in the sky again.

Moon in the sky be our guide
and light our way through the darkness
of the night won't blind us,
as long as we'll stare at the stars !

Stars won't fall
and in the silence I will wait
for my blessing day to come !
In the depths, 
I'll dive to find my deceased light,
a moon reflecting in the sky.

Stars won't fall
and in the silence I will wait
for my blessing day to come !
In the depths, 
I'll dive to find my deceased light,
a moon reflecting in the sky.
