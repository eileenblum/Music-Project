Why did you take him ?
Oh... Why can't I forget him ?
Oh... Why was he born in this mad family ?
Who took my love and his life from me ?
Is there a way to fade my pain away ?
Is there a way to bring him back to me ?
If I could change the past...
Oh... I would twist the time !
"Oh, you can save him from his destiny"
Said the strange old man from nowhere.
"Go back in time, and grant your deepest wish"
I will be soon by your side my love !

Trapped in time,
our love will never shine, even just for a while.
Keep me by your side, together we could live
out of time,
killing eternity by breeding a new fate.
And each glance we may share are just stops 
to our end.

Freed from your family,
Oh... You should be in my arms !
Yet, nowadays I can't find you again.
It looks like you never even existed.
Fate chase between our love and your life.
The strange old man thanked me, shedding a tear.
Trapped in time,
our love will never shine, even just for a while.
Keep me by your side, together we could live
out of time,
killing eternity by breeding a new fate.
And each glance we may share are just stops 
to our end.
