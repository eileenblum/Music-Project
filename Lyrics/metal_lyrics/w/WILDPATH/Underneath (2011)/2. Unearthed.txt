I've ever been waiting
for my unenclosed life to begin
Out of there fateful
room killing a dream a day
On my doorstep,
a message inviting me to go away
today
I can't wait to open up my way !

[REFRAIN]
One step beyond,
our mind is trapped in reality
but flowers
should live unearthed...
This sick world
envies our dreams.

So I've let darkness
cover my steps,
I've crossed the woods to meet
my fate.

hen a light,
coming from the night,
Dazzled my eyes and pacified my mind.
Blue flowers on the mound,
Called me to pull it up !

[REFRAIN]
One step beyond,
our mind is trapped in reality
but flowers
should live unearthed...
This sick world
envies our dreams.

Dignity has been taken,
the World will sink into oblivion
at the bowels of the
Earth shall open

[REFRAIN]
One step beyond,
our mind is trapped in reality
but flowers
should live unearthed...
This sick world
envies our dreams.

Falling, foolish mind
Sinner, you shall repent
Dying, your burden is banished...
Forever...

Falling, foolish mind
Sinner, you shall repent
Dying, your burden is banished...
Forever...
