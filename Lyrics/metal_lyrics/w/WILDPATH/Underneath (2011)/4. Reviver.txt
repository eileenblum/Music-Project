My Judgement day has come, should I fear the way I've been living.
Now I have to face my memories burning my brain through my eyes.

Struggling to breath last among this barely known crowd sunking in the oblivion sea.
Tearing my flesh, brambles that I've made with lies and shame !

My past has gone, I should embrace the end of my old day.
I'll have to forsake my regrets to free this mind from my fate !

Catching the air from the sweet souvenir of a warm house unearthed from my thoughts.
Facing the Judge, under the glance of my own reflection !
