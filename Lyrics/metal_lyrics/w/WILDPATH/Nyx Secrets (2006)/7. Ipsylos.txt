Ever dream of a sunbeam, ever wish to go away
Now I'll try to reach the sky, just want to find my way
I was told, in the mountain highs, there's a place where we can touch the sky
Want to fly with angels, want to taste this real life

On the green hills of Ipsylos we'll find paradise
No pain, no suffer, a land kissed by light

Led by a sun ray, I'll find my own heaven
Let the freedom guide me to my new home
Follow the dream flight, and soar out of this world
And here together we will live forever
Fading to my dreams, the world seems so real...

Ahead of me, just in my path, I have just to change my sight
Find the world of my thoughts, step in paradise
Forgotten of everyone, Ipsylos, my fairyland
Oh, please catch me in your hills and fill my heart with bliss

On the green hills of Ipsylos we'll find paradise
No pain, no suffering, a land kissed by light

Led by a sun ray, I'll find my own heaven
Let the freedom guide me to my new home
Follow the dream flight, and soar out of this world
And here together we will live forever
Fading to my dreams, the world seems so real...

On the green hills of Ipsylos we'll find paradise
No pain, no suffering, a land kissed by light

Led by a sun ray, I'll find my own heaven
Let the freedom guide me to my new home
Follow the dream flight, and soar out of this world
And here together we will live forever
Fading to my dreams, the world seems so real...
