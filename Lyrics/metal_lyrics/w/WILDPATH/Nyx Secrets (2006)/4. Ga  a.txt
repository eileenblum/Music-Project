Wind blows in trees, the breath of each dawn
Wings in the sky, spark of a new hope
I stand on the cliff, freedom heals my mind
Shining ghost of innocence, the sun light's so kind.

I can't stand bitterness, no more charmed by lies
Halo of peace around my soul, I should close my eyes
I want to find respite, and stare at the sky
Why have we to touch our Death, just to feel alive.

Ride the wind of eternity,
Leave the life open your eyes and see,
Charmless beauty in a dying world,
In this place our love is your sword

Want to be one with the earth,
Let me have my rebirth,
And hold in my heart,
My soul's eternal spark
Don't want to cry all my life
I'll never leave my love
And keep in my mind
All hope

Dusk fallinâ on my life, sadness is away
Dazzled by Gaia, I walk down the valley
Iâll be one with eagles, at my firmament
Canât believe in the future, my last fear moment.

Ride the wind of eternity,
Leave the life open your eyes and see,
Charmless beauty in a dying world,
In this place our love is your sword

Want to be one with the earth,
Let me have my rebirth,
And hold in my heart,
My soul's eternal spark
Don't want to cry all my life
I'll never leave my love
And keep in my mind
All hope
