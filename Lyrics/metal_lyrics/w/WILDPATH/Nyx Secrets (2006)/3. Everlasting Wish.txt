Battle rages on the field and great dragons fly
The shadow of the evil forces will now rise before our eyes

Take your sword to defend your world
And you'll get your victory
Keep the fire flames heal your veins
And you'll reach your destiny

Lightning bolts' tearing the night and blood fills the sky
Flames of revenge will dry this pain they inflicted to our land

Take your sword to defend your world
And you'll get your victory
Keep the fire flames heal your veins
And you'll reach your destiny

In the name of love, on the wings of hope
May my spirit be set free
Everlasting wish, can't hide what I feel
In the freedom I believe

Cold is the wind that's gnawing my flesh
The endless pain of the wounds that are fresh
Can't contain my cries, eternal tears of sadness
Looking for the spark that will light the darkness

One day will come, from the snow we will rise
By the force of anger, for all tears that we cried
For the glory of belief we will fight till the end
We will trust in our dreams till we make our last stand

Reach for what you aim, even if your are blinded by the rain
Sorrow will disappear if you still carry on
Forever, take my hand and follow me till the end
Our wish ever will last...

Blood is flooding my holy land, I'll never surrender
Kill me you won't have me, stay blind cause you'll never understand

Take your sword to defend your world
And you'll get your victory
Keep the fire flames heal your veins
And you'll reach your destiny

In the name of love, on the wings of hope
May my spirit be set free
Everlasting wish, can't hide what I feel
In the freedom I believe
