Facing the fate as they reached the cave
Looking for glory, fighting for their king
Bleeding for faith until their last breath
The keeper is beaten, their kingdom'll be proud
They ruled the fight and they'll get the reward
Spread an evil curse on the world

Keeper of love, spirit of the earth
Every life are balancing on the string of fate
As we sail with the wind across the sea
We shall thank the god for the gift to be free

The treasure have been cursed by gods
Damnation eternity only weeps remain
They've been dazzled by their faith and pride
Forgive them mercy a dreadful destiny

The keeper returned and he healed our wounds
Finally evil has no meaning
Dust of stars in an ocean, mother earth's watching over us
Dwelling with stars between black and white
Brightening our hearts with shadowed light

They understood that they committed a fool
May a shining sun light the way

No peace in life without sacrifice
Carry on struggling and get your paradise
Glory will shine since you keep in mind
To be free neverending story of mankind

Keeper of love, spirit of the earth
Every life are balancing on the string of fate
As we sail with the wind across the sea
We shall thank the god for the gift to be free

Keeper of love, spirit of the earth
Every life are balancing on the string of fate
As we sail with the wind across the sea
We shall thank the god for the gift to be free
