Trusting the light, afraid by the night
Led by their creed they're freed from dark sins
Lost in the light the prophet ruled their faith
Threatening their fate if they venture in darkness

Life for days or life for nights
Worship the sun, don't loose your mind
With the dawn the hopes arises
With the twilight comes fears and cries

In the heart of men there are light and darkness
By choosing a side we are killing ourselves
Together we stay in the name of the oath
Forever we will be defending human worth

Prophecies of light and darkness keeps the seal of the life's secrets
Together we hold that quest and forever we'll keep the faith

A new arrival in the land of the sun
A blind man predicting an era of changes
The Dayâll turn to night, the sun'll turn to black
The truth of the world will enlighten your eyes

Life for days or life for nights
Worship the sun/moon, don't loose your mind
The hope comes with the twilight
Since the dawn thereâs only cries

In the heart of men there are light and darkness
By choosing a side we are killing ourselves
Together we stay in the name of the oath
Forever we will be defending human worth

Prophecies of light and darkness keeps the seal of the life's secrets
Together we hold that quest and forever we'll keep the faith

Buried into night for the first time as the moon ruled their sky

Both fear and wonders dancing deep in their eyes
The eclipse opened the gates of their bright prison

Life for days and life for nights
Worship them both, don't loose your mind
Without dawn no life in eyes
Without twilight no peace inside

In the heart of men there are light and darkness
By choosing a side we are killing ourselves
Together we stay in the name of the oath
Forever we will be defending human worth

Prophecies of light and darkness keeps the seal of the life's secrets
Together we hold that quest and forever we'll keep the faith
