Cold, silently, a magic snowâs falling and I see
A faint light, leading my steps in this unknown place
Fantasyâs surrounding my thoughts as I reach my new home

Every time the sun lights the sky
An Ice Roseâs waiting for my heart

Whoâs behind this night spell, making ice eternal
This winter angel Iâve been waiting for
Iâve to know, want to find, Iâm waiting for a sign
During the whole night, your dreams are mine

Iâm dancing with your soul, to keep our feelings safe in an Ice Rose
Making this love last forever, within the ice no pretender

Every time the sun lights the sky
An Ice Roseâs waiting for my heart

Whoâs behind this night spell, making ice eternal
This winter angel Iâve been waiting for
Iâve to know, want to find, Iâm waiting for a sign
During the whole night, your dreams are mine

Iâm dancing with your soul, to keep our feelings safe in an Ice Rose
Making this love last forever, within the ice no pretender

Iâm dancing with your soul, to keep our feelings safe in an Ice Rose
Making this love last forever, within the ice no pretender

Iâm dancing with your soul, to keep our feelings safe in an Ice Rose
Making this love last forever, within the ice no pretender
