Utter darkness, my mind yields to madness
Iâve met the master now Iâm a creature of the night
How could I live without you by my side?
Iâve got no choice I have to hide from the sunlight

Iâve been waiting for so long in the night
Donât you know Iâll love you till the end of time
One day Iâll have to face my destiny
My old dreams are lost for eternity

Nobody can understand, nobody can hear my pain
Memories canât leave my brain
Oh please take me by the hand, and give me a kiss again
In your arms until the end

Now as the night disappears,
A sunbeam lights your face
I donât want to leave this placeâ¦ no moreâ¦
Now as I climb to the sky with tears in my eyes
Your real love heals my heartâ¦ againâ¦

Donât let your life trample down all your dreams
Wake up and find the meaning of your life
Together weâll be stronger to beat our fate
Trust your feelings and fight until the end

Nobody can understand, nobody can hear my pain
Memories canât leave my brain
Oh please take me by the hand, and give me a kiss again
In your arms until the end

Now as the night disappears,
A sunbeam lights your face
I donât want to leave this placeâ¦ no moreâ¦
Now as I climb to the sky with tears in my eyes
Your real love heals my heartâ¦ againâ¦

Now as the night disappears,
A sunbeam lights your face
I donât want to leave this placeâ¦ no moreâ¦
Now as I climb to the sky with tears in my eyes
Your real love heals my heartâ¦ againâ¦
