Pages of an old book
Tales of the wise and fool

Stories come from the past
To build honour and faith

Fantasy and reality together

A pure heart can hear heaven's call
To open the secret door
Let light impregnate your soul
Feel it

When the dragons touch the sky
All legends come back to life
For eternity, there's a light in your nights
Your soul now is free to dream of infinity

Old secrets of the world
In the heart of a Child

A shadow in the sky
Just in front of his eyes

A pure heart can hear heaven's call
To open the secret door
Let light impregnate your soul
Feel it

When the dragons touch the sky
All legends come back to life
For eternity, there's a light in your nights
Your soul now is free to dream of infinity

A pure heart can hear heaven's call
To open the secret door
Let light impregnate your soul
Feel it

When the dragons touch the sky
All legends come back to life
For eternity, there's a light in your nights
Your soul now is free to dream of infinity

When the dragons touch the sky
All legends come back to life
For eternity, there's a light in your nights
Your soul now is free to dream of infinity
