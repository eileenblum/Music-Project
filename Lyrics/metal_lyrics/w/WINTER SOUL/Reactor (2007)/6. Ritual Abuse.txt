And we live to believe
That we can be saved
Bred for a solution
It's the way of the slave

Divided in life, as in death
As decreed by this page
Our confused existence
Ignorance, our cage

Raised to condone and accept
The ritual abuse
Enslaved nations
Children of the curse

Pay with your life
Embrace the suicide
None survive
Surrender you soul
For a lie

Pre-natal infusion
The propaganda in it's Sunday best
Enforced opinions
You enslave the rest

I reject your truth
And you reject mine
Then let's go to war
And let our gods decide our fate

Pay with your life
Embrace the suicide
None survive
Surrender your soul
For a lie
For their lives

"Encore
The ubiquitous masquerade
A danse macabre
No.Free.Choice
Foreknowledge and pre-ordination
Semper Idem
Recycle your god"
