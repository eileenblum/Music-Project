Humanoid apocalypse
Destruction's cause
Nocturnal snare
Born of the wars

Manipulation, control
The souls she steals
All infected lie

Conflict's her drug
Flowing through her veins
Extracting opium
From our remains

Evil's shadow
Disease of this place
Black Widow hates

Evil's shadow
All hope from this place
Black Widow takes

Treacherous pretense
Decadent lure
Inquisition obscure

All the trusting
Now set aflame
Her conflagration
To entertain

"Have you met this creature?
She goes by many names
A thousand incarnations
Yet they are all the same

They weave their web around you
To capture and ensnare
Consume you and forget you
Like you were never there"
