Past almost forgotten
In a life I did not choose
Torn away
I was removed

One final token
The token of regret
Then swept into deserts
I did not want to forget

Corners of our eyes
They evade and obscure
Lurking in shadows
There is no cure

Devouring the ages
Spirits of decay
All has turned to ashes
All, as dust, now blown away

As we lay dying
They sweep in to claim their prize
Grabbing hold of the remnant years
Await the closing of eyes

Daylight fading in children's eyes
Twilight closing in
To drag you away, drag you under
How could I let it end this way

"Returning to a windswept plain
Splinters of familiarity
Embedded in time's patine
Remnants
Why can't I remember"
