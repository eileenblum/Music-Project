Spectre to beguile
Defector, a spy
Under interrogation
No answers when you ask why

New tactics employed
Infiltrate to destroy
Minefields, your mind yields
To advances of the enemy

You are the enemy
You hide, I see
Release the chaos onto our streets

You are the enemy
You hide, I see
Now captive
You will never be free

Intent on sabotage
They got inside
Claiming pure intentions
Another lie

Not forgive, not forget
Not forgive, never forget
Not forgive, not forget
Not forgive, never regret

We are the bringers of revenge
We will be your end
We do not forgive, we do not forget
We do not forgive, We will never forget

"And what shall we do
With each others secrets?

Mutual Assured Destruction

We never forget"
