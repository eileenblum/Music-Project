Fringes of acceptance
Is this the norm?
Passion or obsession?
Borderline perception

Given over to the android ghost
Utopian lover
An engineered hope

You're my creation
Resurrected your ghost
You are the icon
Of the things I loved most

I am the Bokor
I re-animate
I exhume remembrance
It's never too late

You'll live forever
In your zombie state
I am the Bokor
I re-animate

"You've been here a long time
Maybe sometime soon
I'll unwrap your bandages
And place your soul in a living body
Just for a while
Just to see if you've changed
I hope not"
