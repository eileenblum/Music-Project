Lacerations, you hide from the world
Fear etched into your flesh
You cover your bruises, manifested rage
Blow by blow to forge your soul a cage

Drained of power, see yourself corrode
And empty shell, depleted electrode
A thousand horrors, a life you regret
Selective memory makes you forget

She tried to end it, this time a razor blade
Never speak, never tell:
Abusive cycle of hell

Isolation, alone in your world
No penetration, where your soul resides
A posion that you couldn't find
Hidden in the silence in the back of your mind

"An Installation
Repelling all who seek understanding
Live on lust, live on fame
But when you're alone
The splinter in your conscience
Still whispers to you"
