Cold war's land of desertion
Comrades fell under glowing skies
Black Cloud
Radioactive
Toxic ashes burned their eyes

Under glowing skies
A city dies

I walk the deserted streets
I walk the poisoned woods
Witness the place of ruin
Where homes once stood

Again
Never again
Forever drained
Forever to be the same
The cost remains:
Guilt and pain
A world insane

Fire of Prometheus
Enslaved to generate
Freed itself from it's concrete tomb
To irradiate

Collective amnesia
They closed their eyes
Death toll's a secret
How many died?

From across the union
600,000 came
For liquidation
No-one Remains
