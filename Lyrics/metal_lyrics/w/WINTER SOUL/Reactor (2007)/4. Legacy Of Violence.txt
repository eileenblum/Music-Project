Ambiguity rules
Unwilling, initiate the game
Prediction, fulfilling itself
You judge them all the same

Malefactor obscure
He had nothing to lose
You want to see something really intense?
I've got a ghost for you

Deceive me
Treat me with contempt
Delete me
Why do you fear?

Grey, grey
A shroud of ashes
You try to pray

Question it all
Explain us away
As your soul decays

"With glazed eyes
And mirror smiles
There he defiles
And she beguiles

And one falls, as the cord chokes the color
From both, from one, or from the other

From soul of one or souls of two

My deepest art is exquisetly wasted on you"
