Again I dreamt I could save your life
I'd drink your poison, take your knife
I'd bear the world's pain meant for you
Embrace this stake they've tied to you

Look to your stars when pain returns
My hands are tied, your barricades burn
Celestial gazes are misplaced
In this heartless, moonless place

You chose from the earliest time
To let them burn you within
They left behind this orphan heart
And addicted you to their sin

Drink in all the pleasure
Won't get you out
You're still alone
When it all runs out

You're still alone
When the lights go out

"My star has failed to guide me
For stubborn is my way
I'll take a pill, another drink
Pretend that it's okay"
