I wish to wake up in the hall of sleep surrounded by the calm listen to the sounds of things
I haven't heard before my footsteps have stained the way it seems an endless time
I spent thousands of hours, but not enough to die
I wish to walk the Seraph's way, if there's something to show
I want but I can't believe there's secrets to be told
Ornaments of Heaven don't light up my useless days
Under the throne of angels crying I sleep my time away
...and the waves of my time wash me ashore
...ashes, dust, and tears are in my throat, and the waves of time sweet me away,
they take all my borrowed days they just come to leave, and wash me ashore...
