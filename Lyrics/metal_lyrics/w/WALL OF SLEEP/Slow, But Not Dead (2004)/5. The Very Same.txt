We're forced to be the riders of stained glass skies
Anyhow, anyway
We're forced to be the bridlers of flight of minds
Every time, every way
We're forced to be bolts in a mechanism to run its own way
Cogwheel brains, petrified phrases
Functional powerslaves
Different times, different ways
Flaws are the very same
We are breathing warheads of mind terror tactics
Anyhow, anyway
Deep space metamorphs drive us frantic
Hyperlies come into play
We're forced to be bolts in a mechanism to run its own way
Cogwheel brains petrified phrases
Functional powerslaves
Different times, different ways
Flaws are the very same
