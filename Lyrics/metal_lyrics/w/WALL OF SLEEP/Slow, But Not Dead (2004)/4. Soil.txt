Soil means the beginning
Soil means the end
That is my departure and I'll arrive at soil homeland
Feeds my mind with wise words
I'm protected in their arms
It's always warm like ember's fire
Even death can do us part
What have I got to leave?
Just words, by will to you...
What have I got to leave?
Some words and some tunes...
What have I got to leave?
All my hidden grief...
Before I fall like a withered leaf...
A shape appearing from a daydream
A memory from a swoon
An ancient river of dignity bringing eternal calm very soon
A new bud of the old tree beats under dead bark
Soil means the beginning and 'till death I wear the mark
