Years draw the madness years draw the smile on my face
The coast I've been leaving behind
So far as the coast of the grace
This doubt always shields me
Covers me up with its veil
Between sunrise and sunset
There is a life coloured with pain
Far away from sunrise
Far away from sunrise
Tears feed my sorrow
I come and go I'm arrived and left
I have been living for nothing
For a couple of days torn to shreds
Far away from sunrise
Far away from sunrise
