Sunrise breaks up the coffin of day throws me on my way to roll my life at the end of the strings...
Two steps up, two days rolling down all the life round never seen stone-faced golems break my wings I try...
till the end of the stiffened moments I try... till the end of the stiffened days I try...
till the end of the stiffened moments I try... and I lose my way...
Steps to the nowhere, bitter smile, a blindfold fly a lame man's ride at the end of the strings
Two steps up and always rolling down all the life round well known stone-faced golems clip my wings
