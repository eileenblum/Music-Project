That's why they transform minds
That's why they retch hate
That's why they try to disguise that it's too late
That's why they scream louder
That's why they can't cry
Heavy rain of lies falls from the sky
That's why they raise anger
That's why words die away
That's why mouth is open and nothing to say...
That's why it's time to speak now
That's why it's time to learn
That's why it's the last time for us to turn
That's why... it's time to lose again and again....
