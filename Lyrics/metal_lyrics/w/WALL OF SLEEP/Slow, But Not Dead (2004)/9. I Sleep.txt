I sleep through the endless time
A distant look through veil-clouds I don't know what I am to do
I've just realized I've been half through...
I'm so far from the Start maybe far from the End
These pictures are shown by the
Time I have spent
Painted happiness to fill my days
Slow, but not dead I carry on my way
I can feel my cell a fragile globe of time a pulsing crystal womb where I try to bear to die
I can feel my cell a fragile globe of pain
Under a breathing crystal skies soaked in silent rain
