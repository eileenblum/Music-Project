My world is burning!
Everything sticking in flames
Purify by fire
Needed to change
To change...

God is looking at me
My god want me to be alive
My god piercing me
So deep with his mighty eyes

You are the torch that led me
To the end of the line
You are the endless darkness
You are the strongest light
Dead wind pass in my heart
Through the carnage fields
Leading me to nowhere
With the undead hearse
Torches burn up bridges behind me
There's only graves of weak ones
Here I am - god with bones and flesh
I'm not the tamed one

Release from chains
Release my veins
Take all blood you need
Take all flesh to feed

Now die in the grip of devil!

My sin, my son, my sun is rising!

My sin, my son, my sun, is rising

Brightening like Greek fire
On the blue sky
Blinding disbelievers
Now they want to die

Brightening like Greek fire
On the blue sky
Blinding disbelievers
Now they want to die
