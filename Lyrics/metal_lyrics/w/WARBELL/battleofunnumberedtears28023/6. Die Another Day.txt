When heart changes
The world changes too
The only one could make it
Is you
There's just one life
I won't trust you twice
I will laugh
At your demise

It's all your fault
It's all your blame
You deserved to die
So die...
It's all your fault
It's all your blame
You deserved to die
But die another day

It's all your fault
It's all your blame
You deserved to die
So die...
It's all your fault
It's all your blame
You deserved to die
But die another day

Now you cannot turn back the clock
It is time for my turn
Close your cold eyes
Open heart let it burn
