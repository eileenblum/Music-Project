Dark clouds are on Thangorodrim
Warriors lose their hope and might
But Turgon army is coming
We will fight!

Hundreds of armoured men
With shining swords and spears
Are coming fight arm to arm
And help with all our tears!

Morgoth horsemen
With blind Geilion's son
Are come to our fortress!
Gwindor chase them
And kill them both
And that's a sign to charge!

Army of Hilthlum come from hills
Unstoppable, with rage in hearts
Making hundreds deadly deals
Straight into the Angband gates!
Morgoth has prepared a trap
There's no way to run
So they stand without fear
And fight to the last one!

Many lives has been lost
When Fingon's army fight
But human disloyalty
Defeat all heroic effort!
We will fight
To last drop of blood
We will make
Our final charge!
