Kill
Burn
Maim
Destroy

Take innocence
Rape and ravage
Contaminate the world
Cut flesh
Spill blood

(create a mark of death)
Create a mark of death
Designed in flesh
Decorated with offal
Sacrifice them within'
Inside the unholy circle

Innards torn out
And eaten by demons
The soul within' calls out in pain
Screaming
Begging
Pleading for remorse

Rotting death
Is all that's left
Organs are gone
No flesh remains
The world is black
And all have been killed

Create a mark of death
Designed in flesh
Decorated with offal
Sacrifice them within'
Inside the unholy circle
[2x]
