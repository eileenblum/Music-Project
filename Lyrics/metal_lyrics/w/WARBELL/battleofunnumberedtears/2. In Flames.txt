Smell of petrol surrounds me,
I don't understand your words,
I don't want to stay here,
And petrol will help me!

[Chorus 2x]
The flame is coming to me,
But I don't want to run,
My legs stands in flames,
It's too late for anything!

I can't hear my own scream,
My hands stands in flames,
I can't touch my own face,
And now I am like a torch!

[Chorus 2x]
The flame is coming to me,
But I don't want to run,
I'm a fucking torch,
It's too late for anything!

I'm falling down to ground,
My body is still hot,
But my mind is gone...
Gone!
Gone!
Gone, my mind is gone!
