Thor!
Give me the war
Give me the strength
Give me the heroic death

Guide us through the seas
And through the lands
Straight to rich enemies

Lead our swords
And our spears
Into flawless victory

Fallen brothers
Take to Valhalla
To beautiful Valkyries

Sea is dark
And deadly rough
The ship will soon be wrecked
But Oden's son
The mighty Thor
Will guide his lieges to the land

The sky became blue
And land appeared
Our ships survived the storm
The battle is near

Hundreds of brothers
Ready for their final stand
With wrath in eyes
Are waiting for my command

Thor!
Give me the war
Give me the strength
Give me the heroic death

Guide us through the seas
And through the lands
Straight to the rich enemies

Lead our swords
And our spears
Into flawless victory

Fallen brothers
Take to Valhalla
To beautiful Valkyries

Death is in the air
Night spread it's wings
Gloom fills warriors hearts
But Thor will lead us to win
Charge!

Like plague we fall
With no mercy for all
Call of death and blood
Is all that we want

King was executed
City burned down
No one escaped
I'll wear the crown

I fell to my knees
So did my men
We thanked the gods
For an epic charge

Thor!
Give me the war
Give me the strength
Give me the heroic death

Guide us through the seas
And through the lands
Straight to the rich enemies

Lead our swords
And our spears
Into flawless victory

Fallen brothers
Take to Valhalla
Lead us to win
