Human race what you gonna do?
Hiding behind the scars
I'll bring you to the ground
And ill show how spend your life
People of the world what you gonna do?
Still hiding from the fear
Coming from the gates of oblivion
There's no hope for the promised new day

There's no master to follow
There's no god to believe
But I will live... live forever!

I am created in the image of God
But have no power in my tied hands
The sun rises every day and burn my skin
Let the humans evolution begins!

Your inner fears I feel in my beating heart
Your inner fears mostly spring to my mind
When I see you bleeding out all the sorrow
We will live to see tomorrow!

There's no master to follow
There's no god to believe
But I will live... live forever!

There's no master to follow
There's no god to believe
But I will live... live forever!

There's no master to follow
There's no god to believe
But I will live... live forever!

Your inner fears I feel in my beating heart
Your inner fears mostly spring to my mind
When I see you bleeding out all the sorrow
We will live to see tomorrow!

There's no master to follow
There's no god to believe
But I will live... live forever!
There's no master to follow
There's no god to believe
But I will live... live forever!
