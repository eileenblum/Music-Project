I stand alone
On the bottom of the world
With scars on the body
Cold eyes touch the Sun
I straighten my fingers and lift them up
Sweet Mother, the Earth
Is burnt to the ground
Every day we dance on the edge of desire
We are fearless nation so spread the fire!

Now! We always want war!
Now! We always want more!
To the last drop of blood
To the last tear that left
To the last one true god
To the day of our death!
To the last drop of blood
To the last tear that left
To the last one true god
To the day of our death!

Now we stand together
On the top of the world
With scars on our bodies
Moonlight buried in our eyes
We are rising
The endless mass with hearts cold as ice
Children of the Earth
Are crying tonight
Screaming to the sky
Between oceans of hate
We have ruined their fate
They lost the faith!

We will bring The Old World Order
We will burn all to the ground
all what we hear and all what we follow
is the war bell sound!

Now!
We always want war!
Now!
We always want more!
To the last drop of blood,
to the last tear that left
to the last one true god
to the day of our death!
To the last drop of blood,
to the last tear that left
to the last one true god
to the day of our death!
