Into battle we march.
With pride and our gods.
Brutal struggle we want.
with a lot of enemy's blood.

Mighty Thor
...give us strength.
Master of War
...lead my axe.
Thunder god
...heroic death.
Fearless One
...eternal fame.

Scarlet rain,
now sand is red.
Dead bodies covered all the shore.
Death is everywhere!!!
...but Thor's Warriors
never scared.

The sound of crushing shields,
screams of dying foes.
Swords cutting air,
is that what we want.

Mighty Thor
...give us strength.
Master of War
...lead my axe.
Thunder god
...heroic death.
Fearless One
...eternal fame.

Now, the battleground
Is a quiet place.
You can hear only hauling
of wounded men.
We're burying our brothers
on the ships from oak.
They died like heroes
and now they're going home.

They died like heroes
and now they're going home.

Mighty Thor
...give us strength.
Master of War
...lead my axe.
Thunder god
...heroic death.
Fearless One
...eternal fame.
