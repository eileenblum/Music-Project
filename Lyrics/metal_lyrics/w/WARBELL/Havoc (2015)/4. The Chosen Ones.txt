Heart as stone
Eyes so blind
Fearless boy
With controlled mind
Army of children
Grown in pain
Total war machine
Released from chain

Is that world we are fighting for?
Never-ending nightmare!
Is that world we are waiting for?
Never-ending slaughter!

We are sons of sky
We are drown in lies
But no matter what
We will stand our ground
We are sons of hell
And time will tell
Who will lead the crowds

Is that world we are fighting for?
Never-ending nightmare!
Is that world we are waiting for?
Never-ending slaughter!

Bloody fog
Bloody smell
They are coming
Creatures from hell
Hunger of flesh
No remorse in eyes
Hold your guard high
Or be ready to die!

Is that world we are fighting for?
Never-ending nightmare!
Is that world we are waiting for?
Never-ending slaughter!

We are sons of sky
We are drown in lies
But no matter what
We will stand our ground
We are sons of hell
And time will tell
Who will lead the crowds
