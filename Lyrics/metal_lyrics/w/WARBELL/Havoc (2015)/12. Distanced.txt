You think I do
Everything you want
Will I die in your arms?
I don't think so.

I'm damaged, worn-out,
Run-down and ruined!

I will die alone
Like every time
Cause you're no longer here
By my side
I gave you everything
I was ready to give you more
But I won't make the mistake again
I am not so naive anymore!

Time has passed, nothing has changed
Except my mindset, I'm bit distant
Quite skeptical and ruthless

I'm still damaged, worn-out,
Run-down and ruined!

So I will die alone
Like every time I do
I don't anyone at all
I'm not a fool
What I gave you once
I'll take it back someday
I'll look into your eyes again
With all of my hate!

I'm damaged, worn-out,
Run-down and ruined!
I'm still damaged, worn-out,
Run-down and ruined!
