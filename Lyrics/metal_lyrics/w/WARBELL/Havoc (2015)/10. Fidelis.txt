Blinded by your greatness
Crawling in the shadows
Screaming is so hopeless
On the hell's meadows
Kissing your cold limbs
Creeping under your feet
Licking up bloody lips
Do you know how I feel?

Oh kill me, please wreck me
Suck all my life!
I beg of you, make me forget
Oh make me high
Oh kill me, please wreck me
Suck all my life!
I beg of you, make me forget
Oh make me high

I deserve this, I want this punishment
Serving you as my atonement
You may even tear off my hide
Just let me stay by your side

Oh kill me, please wreck me
Suck all my life!
I beg of you, make me forget
Oh make me high
Oh kill me, please wreck me
Suck all my life!
I beg of you, make me forget
Oh make me high

I deserve this, I want this punishment
Serving you as my atonement
You may even tear off my hide
Just let me stay by your side

Oh kill me, please wreck me
Suck all my life!
I beg of you, make me forget
Oh make me high
Oh kill me, please wreck me
Suck all my life!
I beg of you, make me forget
Oh make me high

Just one thing, please tell me
Why did you fucking betray me?
Why did you fucking betray me?
Why did you fucking betray me?
Why did you fucking betray me?
Fucking betray me?!
Fucking betray me?!
DIE!
