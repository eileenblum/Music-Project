Black screens
phone lines are down
behind curtain
death wearing a crown
I will be dead
before you come
why didn't you stop me
when I was at home?!

I'd rather be dead
than chained to your bed
go out of my head
with lies overfed

Take me back to the hell you made
Let the past and the future fade away

One room
Me myself and I
addiction insanity
Am I gonna die?
Looking in the mirror
I can't recognize this face
Let the body burn
I will leave no trace

Take me back to the hell you made
Let the past and the future fade away

I'd rather be dead
than chained to your bed
go out of my head
with lies overfed
