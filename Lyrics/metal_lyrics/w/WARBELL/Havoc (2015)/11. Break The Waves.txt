I am The Mighty One
I am The Conqueror
I am The Prophecy

I am The Mighty One
I am The Conqueror
I am The Prophecy

Break the waves
Cross the sands
Into the wild
To find my sense
My heart will follow
The breezing wind
Dancing on the sea
To find my peace

All I wanna do
Is to heal my wounds
â¦Is to be alone

Break the waves
Cross the sands
Into the wild
To find my sense
My heart will follow
The breezing wind
Dancing on the sea
To find my peace

I am The Mighty One
I am The Conqueror
I am The Prophecy

I'm tired of people
I'm tired of lies
I'm tired of civilization
Bring me back to life
