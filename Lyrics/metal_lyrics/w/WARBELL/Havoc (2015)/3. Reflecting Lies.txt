Plague of infected people
hordes of living zombies
Fed by propaganda
And television truth

Led by fake messiahs
And their fake promises
mindless creatures
Controlled through satellites

Exploited to the bottom
To last drop of money
Too broken to revolt
Too weak to rise

Come, join the masses
Work, reproduce and watch TV
And scream:
"We are free"

The red eyes
Infected by death
Glued to TV screen
Completely brainwashed,
Mindless creatures
Taught that they have to be happy

You are the god of your fate
So do what they want you to do
Don't try to show your hate
They know what is good for you

You are the god of your fate
So do what they want you to do
listen closely to what they dictate
And be part of their world view

And when the twilight comes
The only lights are windows
Reflecting lies of the screen
Showing your biggest dreams
New dawn will be same as previous
Cause you have no power here
So shut up
And vote again!

So be kind and smile
Don't try to rebel
Or soon you will die
