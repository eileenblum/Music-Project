Cold feet on the cold floor
The distance is long,
Too long for the shadow on the wall
Neons are everywhere
Breath of toxic air
Living space is too small

People's dream about peace
Is nothing but fiction
They don't know freedom
They are just slaves of the law

Running through the city of darkness
Running through the city of night
Catch the life, chase the light
Reach the stars, go and fight!
Catch the life, chase the light
Reach the stars, go and fight!

Visions overlap themselves
You can't recognize them
Which are true or false
You must throw your hide
Find the power inside
That will ruin the walls!

People's dream about peace
Is nothing but fiction
They don't know freedom
They are just slaves of the law

Cold feet on the cold floor
The distance is long,
Too long for the shadow on the wall
Neons are everywhere
Breath of toxic air
Living space is too small

Running through the city of darkness
Running through the city of night
Catch the life, chase the light
Reach the stars, go and fight!
Catch the life, chase the light
Reach the stars, go and fight!
