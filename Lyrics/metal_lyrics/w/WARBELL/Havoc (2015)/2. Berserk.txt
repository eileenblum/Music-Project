I am born again
In my own blood
In half poison
Of your deceiving love

I am Berserker
Escaping from the Light
Chasing Death
To the end of life

I will walk my way with shadows inside
Between two bonded worlds
There's nowhere to hide
Carrying love and death on my arms
Oh look at me - The Hand of God
I'm still alive!
I'm still alive!

I will live, I will never die!
Look at me - The Hand of God
