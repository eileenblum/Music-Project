Gate to second earth
Somewhere in the desert sands
Eternity, immortality
My name is life
Servant of god of sun
I'm creating symbols
Still in burning heat
Key to all minds
Gate to universe

Everlasting contact
Cosmic supervising
Architects from stars
Secret meetings
Greatest key to outer space
Giant transmitter
Gate of madness
Gate of agreement

Alien domination
We are they are
My name is life
For how long
Mystic connection
Biracial contacts
Labyrinth of graves
Grave in labyrinth
Second earth is waiting
Among stars and planets

Where is the key...?

Brothers will return
After ages of curse
Six thousand years
To rebirth they plan
To clean universe
And birth new race...
