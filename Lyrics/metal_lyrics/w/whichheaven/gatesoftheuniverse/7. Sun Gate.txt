Gate of sun made of stone
Among the sands of Latin lands
Place of cult like mirror reflection

Day equals night
Day equals night

Gate of sun not man made

Sun gate remembers star voice?
Cyclopic buildings and the star dust
Night and day lighting inside gods house
Presaging day of the arrival
Equals night with night
Unknown dimension artefacts

Like a copy ideal model
Gate of sun in sunless domain
Unknown thought of unknown architect
From the nowhere

In nooks, corers and the windows
Like an ancient calendar
Cosmic style and perfection
Gate of eternity threshold of chaos
