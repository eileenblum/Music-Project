Arise, arise
Come from far away
Turn around and come
Arise and come
To my body
Your wickedness may rise from stars
Like smoke of time like dust

Arise
From galaxies to my body come
Don't return come

Arise
Don't come near come to me
Be commanded by Tiamat the mighty

Arise
Be commanded by Cthulhu the strongest
Be commanded by Marduk great

Arise
Woke up from grave on eons in the sea
Be commanded by god of fire great destroyer

Come, come to my body
Let the stars overpower me

Let the stars hold my back
Let the stars conquer me

Let the stars cover me

Arise
