Ktulhu Nefilim

Born of the stars at the day before days
Landed on Earth at he time before time

Born of the stars at the day before days
Landed on earth at he time before time
Spawned human female and began our line
Great water covers remains if his plan

No one knows where did they come from?
Figures whose faces couldn't recognize
With bodies made not from the earth clay
Greatest ones who came from the sky

First one Nefilim
Giant Nefilim
Spawned by Nefilim
Born of Nefilim
Tiamat Nefilim
Kingu Nefilim
Ktulhu Nefilim
I'm Nefilim

First cosmic era since fire gave light
The ones who came on earth from the sky

Nefilim giant anunnaka
Spreading their knowledge, spreading their spawn

Building objects we can't dream 'bout
Naming things we fear to dream 'bout

Between deserts of mud and mountains of rain
Greatest Spaceport Jerusalem
