Slept in the core
Waiting for the call
Hundred miles below
Wrath of one who's old

Temperature is rising
Pain is growing
Pressure is rising
Pain can't be hold

Like a poisoned fruit
Pain is growing
Pain of old masters
Who once loose their crown?

Earth is shaking flood sink the earth
Kings fight for throne power obsessed

Through gates of time volcanoes of fire
Liquid hate arrives drop by drop
In spaceships, manuscripts and lost files
Ancient knowledge spreads over us

Fulfil brains and hearts with fear
Fear of gods on chariots of fire

Fear of ones slept under water
Slept for eons wait for one sign
