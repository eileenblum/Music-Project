My name is road leading world to salvation
I'm the one who holds control over space and time

Locked in the grave
In the city of R'leh
My bolts strike dead
The one who were and will be

When I've died seas buried me
Far beyond anyone could stare
Far beyond Earth's space and time
Deep under tons of water of life

My home stone cold silent as a tomb
Cyclopic pyramids where I'm the lord

Creatures of dark, beasts serve me
The only one who once rule this deep

But I know the time I'll raise deep will came
And I'll set my wrath against enemies of the ones
