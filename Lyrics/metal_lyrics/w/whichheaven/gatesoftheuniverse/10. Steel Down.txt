First time when you open eyes
After night when fire lick the sky

You recognize your enemies died
You recognize you the only one

You don't know why
You don't ask why
You sentenced to live on burial ground
In the world that woke up with steel down

Windows eyes staring deadly
Cars wracks, air still trembling
Radio died creeping silence
Steel down, grey sadness

Why you survive you asking why
Cities like tombs, world burial ground
No hope, just delayed die time
Lead earth, lead water steel down

You curse the day you open your eyes
You curse the day of great light

You curse the day enemies died
Cause the same day your family died

Steel down burial ground
What goes around what comes around?
