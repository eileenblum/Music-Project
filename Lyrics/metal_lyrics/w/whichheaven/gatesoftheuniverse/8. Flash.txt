Flash the sky fire
One moment change everything into dust
Steel angels from agelessness
Sneak attack - total conquer

No remorse the earth must burn
Annihilation living dead

Colonization growing new man
On the graves grew new race
One flash of our end
That flash that make us dead

Annihilation living dead
Radiation new quality man
The conquer universe changes
One flash and everyone is dead
Just sand skeletons of shelters
Our faith seems so hopeless
Suffering become endless
New race on the graves of earth

Alienation through experiments
New salvation new quality man
Two hands one head new brain
New orders man become a slave
Galaxy not far as ago
New master's full control
One flash to burn our souls
One flash to made the earth blows
