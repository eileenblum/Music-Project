Black ones above us
Like eye of god like hand of fate
Black ones above us
Watching, searching, infiltrating

From nowhere they came
From stars of hate
New, strongest opponent
In this game
Soulless black monsters
No longer you'll be anonymous

Black monsters like eye divine
Black monsters silent assassination

DNA code scanned, samples of you
Data base of human race
No emotions just bio-tech
For brain just organic computer

You'll hear them like bass string
You'll see them like giant dragonflies
Highest tech for highest targets
To infiltrate and exterminate danger

Our race
