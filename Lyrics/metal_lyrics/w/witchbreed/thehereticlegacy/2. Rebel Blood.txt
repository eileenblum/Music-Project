The scent of lotus invading the reign
Sweet and warm embrace
A dream of a landscape so old
A temple inside yourself
A halo ground of devotion
The keeper of Eden's gate

Never die alone follow me through immortal lands
Let me be the mirror of your pride
Fortune favors the Bold [x2]

A missing piece from the riddle of woe
The myth of sharing grave
A hallow of ancient domain to lure and deceive

All the tears drain from your eyes
All it's laid to rest

Never die alone follow me through immortal lands
Let me be the mirror of your pride
Fortune favors the Bold [x2]

Bring down the fire that purge all sin's away
A false God's desire
Sentence and seal forever
Chained to the deepest voids
Nailed to the skin of suffer

All the tears drain from your eyes
All it's laid to rest

Never die alone follow me through immortal lands
Let me be the mirror of your pride
Fortune favors the Bold [x2]

Fortune favors the bold
And I never die alone
