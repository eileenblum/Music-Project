So long the sun was gone
Eternal the crown of shadows and deception
Forsaken by the light
Gemini of the wolf, fed by the Witch

Hell fire's wrath
Unleash the dogs of War
Pray for your life
Rise from the Dark

Erase the primal desire
Stalk he woods in the Night
Brotherhood of Fang and claw
Of fang and claw

Rise from the wastelands of woe
Follow the scent of innocence
Feed from the flesh
Cry, like an angel of Holocaust
Phantom of my revenge
Seal the faith of the blind

Blind

A cry heard through the night
Terrorizing ancient legacy of Fear
Kneel on the ground and pray
They are coming tonight
Shades of white and grey

Undo the work of God, fragile and vain
Legends that are still alive [x2]
Of fang and claw [x2]

Rise from the wastelands of woe
Follow the scent of innocence
Feed from the flesh
Cry, like an angel of Holocaust
Phantom of my revenge
Seal the faith of the blind

Legends that are still alive

Phantom of my revenge
Seal the faith of the blind [x2]
