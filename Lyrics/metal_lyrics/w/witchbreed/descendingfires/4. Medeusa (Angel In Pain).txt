Inside The Veils of Madness
All My Blood Drifts Ashore
On Descending Fires
Dark star Shine Again
Behold the Midnight Sun
Draw a Hole in My soul
Torches Lead the Way
A new dawn will Prevail

Forever Bound In Pain
My Loving Angel
Together In Bloody Embrace
Eternal Suffering

Inside me you're Divine
The Highest and the One
Wounds so fresh and Scars so Old
Devoted to You
Angel in Pain
Inside Myself you're Divine
Angel in Pain
The Strength and Will to Resist
Angel in Pain
Inside Myself you're Divine
Angel in Pain
Devoted to You
Angel in Pain

So Dark the Nameless Void
Awake For The First Time
A Lifetime Of Phantoms And Lies
Scattered By Your Sighting
Dance To The Sound Of Mourning
Shiver To The Touch Of Blade
Like a Moth Dancing To The Light
I Surrender Myself To You
I Deliver My Naked Soul
Stripped Of All Disguise
A Slave for You to Bound Forever
Nail Me to Your Heart

The wait remains uncertain
I Become Nature's Desire
Fear is a Silver Bullet
A Strange Guest in my heart

Forever Bound In Pain
My Loving Angel
Together In Bloody Embrace
Eternal Suffering
Inside Myself you're Divine
Angel in Pain
The Strength and Will to Resist
Angel in Pain
Inside Myself you're Divine
Angel in Pain
Devoted to You
Angel in Pain
