I Pray to the Moon
I Call Upon Her Mercy On Me
The Ones Before and After Me
She Flies With No Wings
I Walk On Four in Her Darkest Dreams
Swallows And Reaps the Sea
Devours the Sun Yet She Bows to Me

Oh What I See is Not What I've Longed
You Ease the Way for the Pain Inside

With Hands so Cold I Touch the Ground
A Voice so Loud the Black Star Sound
a Sacred Place for Those Who Left
In Shallow Grave I Shall Not Rest

Ice Burn My Eyes
All Lights Are Fading Fast
Like Walls of White
Lowering the Skies
God burn my eyes
All Lights are fading fast
Like walls of white
Darkening the skies

She Carries the Black Flame
A Silver Ring With My Wolf Name
A Sign of Wisdom to Follow
The Ones Before and After Me

Slave and Master
Hand in Hand through the Mists of Lust
Hang the Sword and Drop Your Guard
Surrender and Vow

With Hands so Cold I Touch the Ground
A Voice so Loud The Black Star Sound
A Sacred Place For Those Who Left
In Shallow Grave I Shall Not Rest

Ice Burn My Eyes
All Lights Are Fading Fast
Like Walls of White
Lowering the Skies
God burn my eyes
All Lights are fading fast
Like walls of white
Darkening the skies
