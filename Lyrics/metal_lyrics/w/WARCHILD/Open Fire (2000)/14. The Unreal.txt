[Bonus Track]
[Vocals by Markus Roth &amp; Andrea Graupeter]

There was a time before, when everything was real
No lies and no regrets, cold inside but I can't feel - Emotions I once thought were real

One day when I woke up, I knew it was a dream
I felt inside that things have changed, deep down inside of me - Is this not reality?

This is the world we live in, no feelings no love inside
This is the world we live in, my cold soul has closed her eyes

And now the time has come, to look back at what we've done
Destroyed the passion deep within, a war inside that I must win
Can't understand what's going on with me

This is the world we live in, no feelings no love inside
This is the world we live in, my cold soul has closed her eyes

[Solo: Kubon, Stichler]

Hear the words and you can know, all what is going on
Another world was born, without love and hearts of stone - Can you imagine the unreal

This is the world we live in, no feelings no love inside
This is the world we live in, my cold soul has closed her eyes
