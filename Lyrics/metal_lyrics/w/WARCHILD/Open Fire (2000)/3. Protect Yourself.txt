Damn life to do what other people are telling you
Damn life to follow the straight rules of society
Damn life to be under this political force
Damn life not to realize, your own way
Don't dream your life, live your own dream - 'Cause that what you want, is what you feel

I protect my imagination while I'm looking at my self
I don't follow the signs to the outskirts of my life

I protect my imagination behind those giant doors of steel
I'll drive to my visions on a Mainstreet of this life

Don't dream your life, live your own dream - 'Cause that what you want, is what you feel

Do what you want, live up your life - it takes little time but you'll be surprised
Just take a chance, see what you get - feelings they don't know, which you ever had

Don't dream your life, live your own dream - 'Cause all that you want, is what you feel
Don't dream your life, live your own dream - 'Cause that what you want, is what you feel
