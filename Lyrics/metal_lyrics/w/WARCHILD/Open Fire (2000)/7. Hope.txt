In a city not far from here, lives a man and he is alone
Because he's searching for things in the world, for that he believes
Everytime the people disagree, for something that it has to be
Why they don't know and understand, that it has to end

Freedom will come in, right at the end - People are crying, when they know that it's too late

No one is now satisfied, in this world full of fear
No feeling and no trust around, in this land of tears
That what you see is reality, it's not a dream
We cannot live with this loneliness and this destiny

Freedom will come in, right at the end - People are crying, when they know that it's too late

I hope this old man finds what he searches
A place where he can trust someone
Everyone of us need it too, if we try to be best

Freedom will come in, right at the end - People are crying, when they know that it's too late

And after that we will know what is going on
Another world was born without faces of stone
That what you see is reality it's not a dream
We cannot live with this loneliness and this destiny
