Locked inside these walls - shame and regret,
Alone with others as my brain starts to melt
Empty my evil thoughts - shame and regret
By myself I never knew how to feel

Burning inside my mind - locked away from others - Disease infested now I die - die

Sickness takes a hold of me - living a lie,
Say goodbye to my past, I cannot break free
no escape on a Christian way - living a lie,
Learn to understand, there will be another day

Burning inside my mind - locked away from others - Disease infested now I die - die

[Solo: Kubon]

Lie awake in the night - cold sweat on my skin,
As I knew this is the end of those days
Which way to go now - cold sweat on my skin,
And the fear of another sunrise

Burning inside my mind - locked away from others - Disease infested now I die - die
