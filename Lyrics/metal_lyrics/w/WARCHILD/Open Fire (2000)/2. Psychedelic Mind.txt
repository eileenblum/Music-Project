Welcome to the devil's night, when the city burns you can see my might
Hide your eyes from the burning manor, hide your face from the evil glamour
Feel the pain of the hungry flames, see the demons brake their cages
One with fear can't you feel the desire, Caution! 'Cause you play with fire
Are you really feeling still alright? Meet the architect of hell tonight
Wrap your shoes I hope they're fine, for another death trip on a cocaine line

Don't talk about my cruelty, your life's a small part of my destiny
It's like a game show that you play, the prize is bigger the longer you stay
Fait votre jeu and try to win, the excuse to plot out your sin
Congratulations you've finally won, a one-night-stand with the devils son

Are you really feeling still alright? Meet the architect of hell tonight
Wrap your shoes I hope they're fine, for another death trip on a cocaine line

In the devils night burns a little liar, Don't play with me, 'cause you play with Â

In the devils night prays the one who cries, In the devils night for the one who dies
In the devils night burns a little liar, Don't play with me, 'cause you play with Â

In the devils night prays the one who cries, In the devils night for the one who dies
In the devils night burns a little liar, Don't play with me, 'cause you play with
