Far from the safety walls, to ride along the hills
Into the darkest forests, where I was not to see
A light shines bright behind, oak pillars majesty
Her eyes like lightning struck, set my desires free
So make the fairy queen lend me her hand - rising up high with me to wonderland

When the curtain opens wide, see the audience delight
forget the time and let the play begin
And the phantoms of my soul, disguise their faces play their role
A silver shadow on a golden beam - Midsummernightsdream

I slowly walk towards, close to the fallen star
She lay between the leaves, I'm careful like a thief
I want her soul to take, and make her body mine
Lay down beneath the dream, so close before a crime

So make the fairy queen lend me her hand - rising up high with me to wonderland

When the curtain opens wide, see the audience delight
forget the time and let the play begin
And the phantoms of my soul, disguise their faces play their role
A silver shadow on a golden beam - Midsummernightsdream

[Melody: Ruby / Stichler]

So make the fairy queen lend me her hand - rising up high with me to wonderland

When the curtain opens wide, see the audience delight
forget the time and let the play begin
And the phantoms of my soul, disguise their faces play their role
A silver shadow on a golden beam - Midsummernightsdream
And the phantoms of my soul, disguise their faces lay their role
A silver shadow on a golden beam
