In the land before our lives - we had peace and no crime
Honesty was always there - Goodness was everywhere
Kindness was the first law - nobody wanted more
The dreams of today - were never needed before

Look what we have here now - people betray themselves
Violence all over the earth - breaks the trust in ourselves
Pain and stress all day long - the government treats us wrong
No time for feeling and dreams - destroys the human beings

Change your mind and save your life - before it is too late
Because what we do means we don`t have a future - Can we only pray ? Oh, pray! Oh, pray!

[Melody: Stichler]

If we don't find a way out - the hell will always be there
The devil takes our souls - and our hearts turn to stone
Give us a chance to be alive - we don`t have much more time
This whole unreal place - is beginning to die

Change your mind and save your life - before it is too late
Because what we do means we don`t have a future - Can we only pray ? Oh, pray! Oh, pray!

Change your mind and save your life - before it is too late
Because what we do means we don`t have a future - Can we only pray ? Oh, pray! Oh, pray!
