In this life full of hate - you'll be by yourself
No one to help - they only look the other way

In your life - you'll be alone - in your life - you're on your own

You have to live this life - do whatever to do
Create your own style - make every dream come true

In your life - you'll be alone - in your life - you're on your own

Trusting no one around you - in this world you're going through
For it seems you stand alone - and deliver by your own

I'm loosing all control - can't choose a way to go
Deep in my heart I know - it's just the fucking show

In your life - you'll be alone - in your life - you're on your own
In your life - you'll be alone - in your life - you're on your own
