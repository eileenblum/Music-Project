Tanks rolling out on the ground, when the soldiers fire another round
People dying by their own hand, blood drampeled into foreign land
Fighters blasting our cities down, our families lay on the ground
Oppressed people hiding every where, survivors left wounded and bare

World war, can`t be won anymore, tell me what are you fighting for

Jump into combat, In the arms of death, Bullets stolen every single breath
Deprived life killed without thought, people are sold freedom is bought

World war, can`t be won anymore, tell me what are you fighting for

[Solo: Ruby]

Long after the scares are healed, stories told secrets revealed
Learn and understand! Don`t live in fear! Exchange your guns for some cans of beer!

World war, can`t be won anymore, tell me what are you fighting for
World war, can`t be won anymore, tell me what are you fighting for
World war, can`t be won anymore, tell me what are you fighting for
