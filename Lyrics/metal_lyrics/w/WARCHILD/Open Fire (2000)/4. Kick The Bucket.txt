In the silver glance of moonlight, shining blood sprinkled teeth
Muscels filled with adrenaline, kill the word in which you believe
Feelings you have buried, private graveyard deep inside
And the girl that you have married, tears bodies flesh up wide
The beast hunts through the city, no mercy deep within
The natural born killer, let the dance begin
The doberman's sweet kisses drink blood instead of wine
The harvester won't miss, a strike I'll bet a dime
The beast hunts through the city, no mercy deep within
The natural born killer, let the dance begin

You were running on a thin line, run between black and white
Nine double 'M' won't stop you, 'cause you're one with the night
Take every life that crosses, the way at the wrong time
You never care deadlosses, no one can make a rhyme

The beast hunts through the city, no mercy deep within
The natural born killer, let the dance begin
The doberman's sweet kisses drink blood instead of wine
The harvester won't miss, a strike I'll bet a dime
