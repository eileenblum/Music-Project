Five minutes and counting
I've just began to thirst
Anxiety crashing through me
Adrenaline burst
I hear the sound of thunder
A deafening mad roar
Apocalyptic chaos
I hear the sounds of war

I grab my Ax- six string attack

Hurried into the frenzy
Commanding tactfully
Bashing heads around me
A violent ecstasy
A means to crush the torment
To lash out of control
Banging skulls, swinging fists
Fighting to overthrow

I grab my ax-six string attack

A cry goes out for freedom
A man steps in- a hero
He takes the pain away-fulfilling lives today
A savior from the alternative

Dark paradise
