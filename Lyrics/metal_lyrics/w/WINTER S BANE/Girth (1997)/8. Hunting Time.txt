For everyday I live I get closer to my end
My youth stolen from the hands of time
What I took for granted has haunted like a phantom
Now a ghost that hides in the recess of my mind

The more I search for my prey
Slips through my grasp elusively hunting time
Withered and decaying alive but ever changing
As the years pull the flesh from my bones

The more I understand the enemy of man
I curse that wretched beast I loathe
The more I search for my prey
Slips through my grasp elusively

How could I lose the one thing that I dreamed
To become a man and kill the child I once believed
To think that I am dying slowly day by day
To feel its warm embrace like moths to a flame

The more I search for my prey
Slips through my grasp elusively

Hunting time
My youth has passed away
Hunting time
I didn't want to change
Hunting time
Don't let it slip away
Hunting time
Nothing stays the same
