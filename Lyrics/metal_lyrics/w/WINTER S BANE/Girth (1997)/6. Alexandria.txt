With a seductive smile and a hypnotic gaze
I broke the silence and asked her name
She whispered in my ear
That there is only fear
Without hope or love for each other
I didn't need any hope I wasn't looking for love
I just needed a fix someone I could touch
I wasn't taking a chance on any type of romance
I just needed something
I bought the hotel room I knew that she was doomed
Like all the ones before another countless face
Caressing her pale skin
As smooth as porcelain
She undressed to reveal black lace
Pulling her close I felt her flesh
My not breath kissed her icy neck
Shot a chill down her spine
I knew the time was right
I will follow my intuition
Hold on tight and won't let go
With every breath I feel the tension
I just don't let it show
Each thrust, in time
I think I've crossed that line
I'm ready I'm ready
I'm gonna blow
To my surprise she knew the game
A selfish act, just wanted laid
Quietly she moaned John it's your turn
I thought what could it hurt
I wasn't fully aware of her sadistic intent
'Till she pulled out a whip then I knew what she meant
She tied me down and lit candles of red
And unleashed her fury
Each violent strike opened a wound
In ancient tongues she was consumed
On the wall a pentagram
While she took the seed of man
Alexandria you're a demon whore
A succubus a black hole
A deep void filled with passion
A wicked bitch a love assassin
An evil twist I can't resist the mistress of the damned
The stakes are high now I am damned
The stakes are high now I am doomed
My soul's at hand
Alexandria
