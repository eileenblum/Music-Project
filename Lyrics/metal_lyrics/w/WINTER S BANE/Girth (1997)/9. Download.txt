64 terabytes of living memory
Integrated with genetic code
The entire race isn't free

Linked up to the INTERNET
A network holocaust
Now life is spent in cyberspace
The human soul is lost

Giga bauds of information
Transfer at light speed
Security retina scanned
Fiber optics is the way

Nana bots that alter life
That attack like germ warfare
Through the gates of big brother
The micro god is here

I won't take the implant
A barcode's not my name
Worldwide revolution
Through an ISDN
I run the streets like a dog
An outcast without hope
Carrying the virus
Destroyer of the code

I will download, download
