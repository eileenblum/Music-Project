Sitting on the edge of mother's bed
I realize damn she's dying
Sometimes I wish that she was dead
I'm sick of mother crying

When they take her away will I still feel the same
There's a feeling of doubt inside me
Will confusion remain will I suffer the pain
Will I run through the light that blinds me

Why me conceived by thee
Kill procedure

I lie awake at night the enemy I feel inside me
Rotting beast destroying me
I think it's time for dying

When they take me away will you still feel the same
There's a feeling of doubt inside you
Will confusion remain will you suffer the pain
Will you run through the light that blinds you

Why me conceived by thee
Kill procedure

Like worn leather a tired old man
Contemplates what's at hand
Like his friends before him then his wife
He's sick of living a lonely life
