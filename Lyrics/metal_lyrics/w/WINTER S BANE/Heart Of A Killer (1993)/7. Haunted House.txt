In a creepy old house on a stormy dale lane
There's a run down sing that says : Enter if you dares
I opened the gates and took a deep breath
and climbed down the decaying stairs

The chilling gray fog made it hard to see
but I noticed the silvery moon
A twisted little fellow, which I thought was a man
Whistled a nightmarish tune
He held out his hand and hissed for his fee
pointed the way then disappeared

It's been too long - there's no way out
I'll die in here - in the haunted house
Glass walls consume - concealing my fate
Is dying worth what I paid - In the haunted house

It's only a small price to pay for my fetish
A hellish scare
I entered for the first floor it reeked of death
Cobwebs everywhere
Down a dark hallway distorted faces on the wall 
chanting my name, crying out loud
It was more than real

Trapped in this maze of glass
my soul's been abandoned
Now I scream your name
crying for help I call
My voice is mutated
now I'm a twisted face on the wall

It's been too long - there's no way out
I'll die in here - in the haunted house
Glass walls consume - concealing my fate
Is dying worth what I paid - In the haunted house
