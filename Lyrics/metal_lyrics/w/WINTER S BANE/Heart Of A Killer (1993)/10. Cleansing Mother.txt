The ice has melted at the polar caps
as Mother Earth gives in to destiny
The warning signs already passed
cleansing all impurities
The Earth rumbles like a growling lion
ready to feast it's prey
Stars are spinning in the sky
as the night turns into day

Volcanos erupt - spilling earth's blood
Belching out lava - destroys all intact
Tidal waves crash - killing as much
floodind the land, changing the map
Tornados touch down - reaping the whirlwind
leading to mass devastation
Tremors throughout - the earth tilts to its side
Leading to man's extintion

Darkened clouds all over head
like thundering hooves of nightmares
The sun now travels north and south
screaming in the air
Prophecies told a shift of the axis
killing all the evil from the world
Just like Lemuria and Atlantis
when a man destroys his hearth, it's cold

Volcanos erupt - spilling earth's blood
Belching out lava - destroys all intact
Tidal waves crash - killing as much
floodind the land, changing the map
Tornados touch down - reaping the whirlwind
leading to mass devastation
Tremors throughout - the earth tilts to its side
Leading to man's extintion

Volcanos erupt - spilling earth's blood
Belching out lava - destroys all intact
Tidal waves crash - killing as much
floodind the land, changing the map
Tornados touch down - reaping the whirlwind
leading to mass devastation
Tremors throughout - the earth tilts to its side
Leading to man's extintion
Extintion...
