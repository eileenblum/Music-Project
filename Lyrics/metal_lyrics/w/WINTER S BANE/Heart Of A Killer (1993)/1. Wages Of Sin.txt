On the hours of execution
a spiteful soul, awaits his death
sobbing, he tries to tell them, that he wasn't there

Psycho how does it feel - Just think you're about to die
for the murders that you've committed
The final judgement has been made
Eight families will see their justice done

Tears : From his pale blue eyes
Can't : Mask hatred inside
His fear : Will not subside
To death : He will succumb

Psycho now it's time to go - just think you're gonna die
We haven't received the call
we haven't heard nothing yet
the priest is here to give you your last rites

The wages of sin is death (my son)
you've gambled on your life
I know it's hard to see (my son)
The light that shows the way

It's the killer that's kicking and screaming
I don't want to die (no-no), judge cohegan
I'll haunt from hell
I'll get you i swear by my last words

The wages of sin is death (my son)
you've gambled on your life
I know it's hard to see (my son)
The light that shows the way:
