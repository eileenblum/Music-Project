Cohegan is arrested for the murder of his wife
Cohegan stands in the courtroom
with his fate in the jury's hands
We the jury, find the defeandant, Mr. Cohegan
Guilty of murder!
Guilty!!!

As I write these last words
A message to my family
I'm all alone - can you please forgive me

As the twilight fades into the distant sky
a shooting star steals my breeth away
from my one last wish is to feel loved again 
to have my heart freed - freed from sin

Now I face my deepedt fear
Not of death or what's beyond
But the memories that left me disgrace

Oh how my eyes deceive me
Doesn't anyone see?
Is that the blade in the mirror or a reflection within?
Is that the blade in the mirror or a reflection within?

Walking trought - the darkness
His last rites are read
Asking for a mirror
Was Cohegan's last request

Oh how my eyes deceive me
Doesn't anyone see?
Is that the blade in the mirror 
It's been a reflection within
Oh how my eyes deceive me
Doesn't anyone see?

Why isn't the blade in the mirror
It's been a reflection within
Why isn't the blade in the mirror
It's been a reflection within
