I awoke from a bad dream - just to live in a nightmare
It's been six months and 
I still fear voices from the past
One by one they call to me, and say the killer lives
His victims cannot rest in peace, until the heart is dead
Why are they haunting me?

Grim reminders of the brutal murders from seeing my reflection
Everywhere I look I see the murderer's obsession
A madman that stalked in the night
living out of the fantasy's rage
Tortured the innoncent in a mirrored room
seeking out pleasure from pain

No one can hear the voices - calling to come nearer
I only hope they'll leave me alone 
when i look away from - the mirror
We search for all the answers - as time slowly passes
Life becomes less to me - after the horror glances

I finally realizes, exactly what's been done
I received the blood and soul and the killer still lives on
I'm remembering someone's memories
and I'm accusied of being there
I'm the one who sentenced his death
and justice has prevailed

No one can hear the voices - calling to come nearer
I only hope they'll leave me alone 
when i look away from - the mirror
We search for all the answers - as time slowly passes
Life becomes less to me - after the horror glances

The blade just stands there, in the corner of my room
Guess who Cohegan (here I am again)
I brought along some toys of mine
That might help you sleep, should i use a blindfold
Or let you watch as you bleed
Come now Judge it's only death

Gripping the sheets white knuckled and pale
Cohegan couldn't move
He gasped for air - his fingers went numb
as the unholy terror grew

No one can hear the voices - calling to come nearer
I only hope they'll leave me alone 
when i look away from - the mirror
We search for all the answers - as time slowly passes
Life becomes less to me - after the horror glances
