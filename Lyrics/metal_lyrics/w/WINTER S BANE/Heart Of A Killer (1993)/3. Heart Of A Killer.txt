Please relax and take a deep breath
You're about to go under
Think about something peaceful
before you sleep and soon it will be all over

I heard they found a donor at the last minute
He was on his way to be - executed for murder
I even heard this is the Judge
that sentenced him to his death
He must never know - where is heart came from

No he must never know - Heart of a killer
We can never tell a soul - Heart of a killer
No he must never know - Heart of a killer
We can never tell a soul - Heart of a killer

Judge, Judge Cohegan - can you hear me
the transplant was successful
soon you will be up and walking
You will be here with us - just a little longer
Go back to sleep and then you are free to leave

No he must never know - Heart of a killer
We can never tell a soul - Heart of a killer
No he must never know - Heart of a killer
We can never tell a soul - Heart of a killer

Oh,no! Something's wrong - why do i feel this way?
What has happened - What did they do?
Why am i fading away?
