Hey Cohegan - this is the end of your worthless life
A shocking reality - it's a struggle within your mind
It's a tug-of-war between innocent and guilt
A question of your inner truth, a definition of yourself!

The judge could not believe his eyes
as the blade was coming nearer
Frozen as if crystallized - there was no way to win
A desperate act from a desperate plan
a cry let out from an insane man
Cohegan frumbled trough the drawer

The lights came on
Cohegan couldn't see the shadows danced
so he believe - he raised the gun 
with an angry stare and no regrets
To terminate the eternity, to kill the silouette

His mind was wrecked but a tormented smile arose
When the hammer slammed into steel unleashing a lethal dose
The judge laid their denial as his kids stood in the hall
it was then he realized his wife lay there dead
Oh, she's dead

The lights came on
Cohegan couldn't see the shadows danced
so he believe - he raised the gun 
with an angry stare and no regrets
To terminatethe eternity - to kill the silouette

The lights came on
Cohegan couldn't see the shadows danced
so he believe - he raised the gun
with an angry stare and no regrets
To terminate the eternity - to kill the silouette
