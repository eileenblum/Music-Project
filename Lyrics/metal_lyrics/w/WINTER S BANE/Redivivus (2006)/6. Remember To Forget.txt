I don't believe that I'm the one and only seer
"True Messiah" you will find out now what's right
I don't pretend to be the eyes for all mankind
So fall down to your knees and pray for mercy's speed
These words that they have tried to read will last forever
You will watch
Burned in hell
Called to the trial
Always on my mind
Feed the flames
Your book of lies

Secrets of the past
Are haunting heresy at last
The guilty who have sinned
Let me forgive his past
All "sins" cleansed by god
Pray to him
Or do without

Remember to forget
Secrets in your mind
Leaving visions of our lives
Can't you see

I don't believe that I'm the one and only seer
I can't see the future
For I'm not chosen to
Believe the prophets
Or follow your lies
Oh these visions must be denied
Secrets of the past
Are haunting heresy at last
The guilty who have sinned
Let me forgive his past
All "sins" cleansed by god!
Pray to him, or do without

Remember to forget
Secrets in your mind
Leaving visions of our lives
Can''t you see

We could live in harmony
Just like love it will be real
Close your eyes and you will see
My visions will be free
And you'll realize what you have done
You will see when I have gone

Remember to forget
Secrets in your mind

Leaving visions of our lives
Can't you see
