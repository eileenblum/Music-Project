Would you really stand in front of me
I don't believe it
Thought you were no longer a part of me
Pure deception

Caught in a web
Cannot live this life again

Don't put this life in my hands
A lie soon parted
No longer working for your twisted game
I'm done and leaving

Caught in a web
Cannot live this life again

Now you're standing
Alone in front of me
No one's here
To help you with your fate
My eyes upon you
Staring at your face
It is time
For the master to die

Caught in a web
Cannot live this life again
Said I needed to be free again
To find redemption
Traveling across both land and sea
Away from you

Caught in a web
Cannot live this life again

Do not weave me in your tangled web
My final warning
Realize this is my life to live
Or yours I'm ending

Caught in a web
Cannot live this life again
