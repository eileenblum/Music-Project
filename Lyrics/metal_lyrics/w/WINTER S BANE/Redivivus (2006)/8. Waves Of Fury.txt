I feel the fear
As the fury opens before me
Like a ship in the tempest
Thrown against the rocks
I will die

War and pestilence
Divides the world
To separate the weak
And control your soul
Drawing the lines
Between good and evil
Awash in the battles of your blood and sin

This time
This time
This time
They won't deceive us
They are coming for you
This bloodlust of the enemy
Arising now on the waves of fury

The battles are lost
And the ground is broken in rage
Soaking in blood
They will come to take me away

War and pestilence
Divides the world
To separate the weak
And control your soul
Drawing the lines
Between good and evil
Awash in the battles of your blood and sin

This time
This time
This time
They won't deceive us
They are coming for you
This bloodlust of the enemy
Arising now on the waves of fury

Choked all around
It seems there's no escape
But through the power of my soul
I can fly
Arising now on the waves of fury

This time
This time
This time
They won't deceive us
They are coming for you
This bloodlust of the enemy
