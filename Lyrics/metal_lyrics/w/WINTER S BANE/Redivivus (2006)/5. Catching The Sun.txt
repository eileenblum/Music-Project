Now is time to be king of the land
O I come cross the sea
A part of life it will be what it seems
A chance for them
You will see
Don't try to awake cause there's vengeance in me
Your fear!

Cold steel in my hands
You will feel the pain
Sleepless at night
Fall on a country that's restless with kings
The time has come now to be
I know the fight in a man's dying tear
Unlocked the shackles on me
Practice the thrust
Or be dead in your quest
Of freedom

Cold steel in my hands
You will feel the pain
Sleepless at night

Losing my name
Never knowing the reign
Of the land without pain
Lost in the twilight
I am catching the sun

Now is time to be king of the land
O i come cross the sea
A part of life it will be what it seems
A chance for them, you will see
Don't try to awake cause there's vengeance in me
Your fear

Cold steel in my hands
You will feel the pain
Sleepless at night

Losing my name
Never knowing the reign
Of the land without pain
Lost in the twilight
I am catching the sun
