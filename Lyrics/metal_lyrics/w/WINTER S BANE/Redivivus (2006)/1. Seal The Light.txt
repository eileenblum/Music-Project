Cast the spell like a thunder in the storm
Don't believe it is me not only you
Fight in helms deep will be the only way
Climb the stairs always on the run again

Roaring thunder lightning in the sky
See confusion in the urikye
Try to find the sign of life

Don't seal the light, treasure of your own misleading
Don't fear the dark
Alone you fight this evil war
Pounding begins and no one can believe the scene

You are the one
The hero of this fallen land

Chosen one will be here by dawn
After all that Sauron sees we can't flee
Band of riders mount now it's time
Charging through the enemy until we die

Roaring thunder lightning in the sky
See confusion in the urikye
Try to find the sign of life

Don't seal the light, treasure of your own misleading
Don't fear the dark, alone you fight this evil war
Pounding begins and no one can believe the scene
You are the one, the hero of this fallen land

Cast the spell like a thunder in the storm
Don't believe it is me not only you
Fight in helms deep will be the only way
Climb the stairs always on the run again

Roaring thunder lightning in the sky
See confusion in the urikye
Try to find the sign of life

Don't seal the light, treasure of your own misleading
Don't fear the dark, alone you fight this evil war
Pounding begins and no one can believe the scene
You are the one, the hero of this fallen land

The hero of this fallen land
Hero of this fallen land

Don't seal the light
Don't fear the dark
As you fight this evil war
Don't seal the light
Don't fear the dark
Don't seal the light
