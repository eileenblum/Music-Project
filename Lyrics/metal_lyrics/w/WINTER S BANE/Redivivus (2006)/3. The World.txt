Ignorance weeps from your mouth
Begging to consume more than you need
Growing weak on the fat of this land
Always taking with nothing to give

Like the swine in filth
You would feast on the bones
Of this world
And leave nothing
But the flies to rot

The world chokes on your waste
Greed to swallow her life
Gray shades of ash and of dust
And tomorrow dies today

Drinking the milk and sip the honey
Bury her at the end of the world
A barren waste is all that is left
For we live at nature's expense

The world chokes on your waste
Greed to swallow her life
Gray shades of ash and of dust
And tomorrow dies today

Like the swine in filth
You would feast on the bones
Of this world
And leave nothing
But the flies to rot

The world chokes on your waste
Greed to swallow her life
Fray shades of ash and of dust
And tomorrow dies today

Now in the end
The pigs all will starve
Ripping and tearing at their own flesh
To turn their eyes
On the angry sun
And die blind
From their ego rage

Ignorance weeps from your mouth
Begging to consume more than you need
Growing weak on the fat of this land
Always taking with nothing to give

Drinking the milk and sip the honey
Bury her at the end of the world
A barren waste is all that is left
For we live at nature's expense

Now in the end
The pigs all will starve
Ripping and tearing at their own flesh
To turn their eyes
On the angry sun

As the world
As the world
Is reborn insane
