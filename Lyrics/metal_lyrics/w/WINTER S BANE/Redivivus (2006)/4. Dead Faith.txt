Hypocrites
Basking in the name of god
To wash away the sins of another day
Praise be to me
And the glory that i make
Unaware of the darkness that eats at your soul

Blind to the sins you commit
Scales of the devil hide your eyes
Perform your selfless acts
And reveal a heartless design

Close your mind
And open your heart
To find the answers you seek
All the questions in your life
Will be answered by your faith

A demon's faith
Is born of the lie
Anger and arrogance
Despising the throne
Rejecting love
Rejecting peace
Rejecting all that was
Your salvation
Knowing your faith
Not wanting to change
Feeling the pain
For the lack of god

Close your mind
And open your heart
To find the answers you seek
All the questions in your life
Will be answered by your faith

Through the steps in the sand
We are the burden of our faith
Always seeking salvation
To be before our eyes

Born again
In light and blood
The saving grace
Of the sorrowed soul
Accepting truth
Accepting peace
Accepting all that is my salvation
Given the path
To knowing god
Given the chance
I will live forever

Close your mind
And open your heart
To find the answers you seek
All the questions in your life
Will be answered by your faith

Oh oh oh oh oh...
