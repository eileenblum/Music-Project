In the dark of the night
Through the valley's of silent skies
On the wings of the black
It appears there's no turning back
Try to kindle the light
And see the vanishing bright
Tell his messenger
That you will not be a part of cruel dominion

Burning bridges
Beating wings
Are fanning the flames
And the tyrant's are calling
Evil mind
And then black is the heart of a killer

Try to hide from the beast
To be silent not to reveal
Time to flee the feast
To steal this life
You unleash
Just quicken the pace
Run for your life to escape this maze
You have to open your eyes to end this dream of terror

Burning bridges
Beating wings
Are fanning the flames
And the tyrant's are calling
Evil mind
And then black is the heart of a killer

Soaring with the talons of hate
Surrender to your death

Raptor of hell at your call
You must face your fear or flee
With the eyes of a crimson flame
And the voice of a jackal
You make the tyrant's call
You make the tyrant's call

Burning bridges
Beating wings
Are fanning the flames
And the tyrant's are calling
Evil mind
And then black is the heart of a killer
