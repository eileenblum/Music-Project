From spark to flame
And fire to fame
It doesn't matter to me
To create my soul
In the name of life
I don't need my world in your eyes

You ride the high
And you know the low
It's all part of the game
To make the line
And say the words
To move a million voices

The spark that lights my flame
Pushes me beyond the same
Forces me to become
Something better
To evolve into what you see
And to share what I have to be

And give you everything that i am
Speak my mind
And be myself
To show an honest voice
Open the door
To let you in
And see the world
That I have built

You ride the high
And you know the low
It's all part of the game
To make the line
And say the words
To move a million voices

The spark that lights my flame
Pushes me beyond the same
Forces me to become
Something better
To evolve into what you see
And to share what I have to be
And give you everything that i am

I don't care what you say
I don't need your approval
To make it right
Or make it wrong
It all comes down to me
The beginning and the end
Are all that we are given
So buy the ticket
And ride the ride
No sympathy for the devil

The spark that lights my flame
Pushes me beyond the same
Forces me to become
Something better

To evolve into what you see
And to share what I have to be
And give you everything that I am

You ride the high
And you know the low
It's all part of the game
To make the line
And say the words
To move a million voices

I don't care what you say
I don't need your approval
So buy the ticket
And ride the ride
No sympathy for the devil

No sympathy
For the devil
No sympathy
For the devil

The spark that lights my flame
Pushes me beyond the same
Forces me to become something better
To evolve into what you see
And to share what I have to be
And give you everything that I am

Spark to flame...
