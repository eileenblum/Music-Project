Infernal devastation. Followers of Satan's force.
Sorcery, blasphemy. Feel the presence of the Lord.
Drink the blood of the dead to be stronger than before.
Gods' revenge comes to earth; we will fight in Satan's name.

[Pre-chorus:]
Help me I'm possessed by the essence of the evil gods.
Die and turn in your grave, feel the spells of the damned.

[Chorus:]
Fall to your knees and bow to the Dark Lord.

Metal rule. Kill the fools, they will cry for mercy again.
Invincible kind of evil; no boundaries, pure damnation.
Take the bitch, fuck the witch; lust is rising from within.
Satan's hand crushes the land; you will die at midnight time.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
