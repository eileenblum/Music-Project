The time has come to reveal the reality of pain.
And to arrive to the world of the last horizon.
Swallowed by the night her punishment makes me feel.
In the dead of the night you can hear my last breath.

[Chorus:]
Hear the cry of million souls.
They cry for mercy to the void.

To hell and back, I've walked again and again.
Carrying with me the pain of thousand lives.
Chained to torment like a dog is chained to pain.
In the void of the pit of the dark I laugh my fate in vain.

[Chorus]
