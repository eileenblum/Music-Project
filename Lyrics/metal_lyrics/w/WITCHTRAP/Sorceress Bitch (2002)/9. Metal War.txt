Night of doom. Fight with all.
Living fast. Hair so long.
Feel no fear. Crush the bounds.
Chaos plan for battlefield.

[Pre-chorus:]
Keep on pounding battle heads.
A lot of spells march with you.
Keep on pounding hammer drums.
For metal war you'll fight.

[Chorus:]
Death and Destruction. [x3]

The nightmare waits to take revenge.
Kick the heads, kill the fools.
Their fucking death feeds your hate,
blowing their heads off as loud as hell.

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
