His face shows torment and hate.
Into his burning eyes, watch what future says.
The victims walk in the streets with fear.
Falling from heavens death and destruction.

[Chorus:]
Behind his mask, waiting the time
to swing the axe and slice your throat.
In the crystal ball your death awaits.
Face the Evil - Face the Evil.

Your final breath makes him strong.
The tasted of blood is sweet as hate.
You can't escape his only will.
His hungry of death attacks again.
