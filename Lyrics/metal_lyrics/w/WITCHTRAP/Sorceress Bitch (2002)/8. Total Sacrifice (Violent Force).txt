When the setting sun has stopped to shine and the night
comes down. And we see in the moon a pentagram and a
funeral fog. Witchery is all over of this town. Victim fate is to
die. Spell of Dark Lord rises from hell. Total Sacrifice.

[Pre-chorus:]
Feel the rush. Cast the spell. Satan son.

Possession of evil wrath over me. You're the chosen one.
You must spill your blood and soul for the mighty king.
The bloody ritual has begun; you will pray to die.
Waiting for the end to kill again. Violent Force.

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
Screaming the hate and the pain. Violent Force.
This is the Total Sacrifice.
Your torment will never end. Violent Force.
Welcome to die.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
