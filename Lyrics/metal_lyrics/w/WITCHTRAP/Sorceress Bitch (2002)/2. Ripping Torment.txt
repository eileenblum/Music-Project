Afraid of the ripping screams in this forgotten ways.
By the restless creatures of the night dismembering the killed ones.
Killing metal wolf comes walking behind your back.
Sepulchral voice of hell. No escape from fear domain.

[Pre-chorus:]
They come for your blood and soul.
Death pain. Are you afraid of the dark of the night?

[Chorus:]
Ripping Torment [x3]

Don't turn around the corner, death awaits for you.
Nightmares of the living dead are tormenting your mind.
Bad smelling sluts of hell start to suck your bloody gore.
It's hour of final breath, you're trapped in the night.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

Death comes with the pain. The night becomes strong with your fear.
Within the grave fog, rise hungry jaws for your blood.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
