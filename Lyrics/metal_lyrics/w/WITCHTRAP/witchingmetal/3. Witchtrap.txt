Occult in the shadows of the night
Decapitating heads that doesn't bang
Possessed by the infernal sounds
And violent forces of metal war

[Pre-chorus:]
Die by the edge of the razor attack
Suffer because the Dark Lord will has no mercy to you

Warriors of hell will fight till death
Unbounded horrors for metal gods
Awakening with the war
An eternal martyrdom that overtakes us

[Chorus:]
Pain torment soul sacrifice
Sin hate winds of death
Curse and rites call the demons blood
Witch bitch burn insane

The realm of chaos comes from Sodom
Proclaim the victory of the power of Witchtrap
