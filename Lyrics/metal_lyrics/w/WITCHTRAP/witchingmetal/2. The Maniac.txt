Nightly hunt for a godless warrior
Victim's blood satisfies your hungry for the dead
Satan's legate builds your weapons for to kill
There's no rest for a killer zombie pain

[Chorus:]
The night has come and your victim walks alone
Madness curse impulses your knife to crush the flesh
Ritual that feeds your bloody passion of a serial killer

Criminal attack with the power from hell
Infernal design causes pain to your mind
And your face is totally horrified
No escape from the razor of his hand of death

His brain is in war of torment and pain
And his eyes are burning and blood red
Victim blood is spilling for the street
To condemn to the hellish endless pain
