Destroy your enemies
and see their women and children cry
Put their heads on altars like a sign of victory

[Chorus:]
Troops of ghosts and millions of dead
in recompense for his blood sacrifice
Blood running free all around of the earth,
nowhere to run and nowhere to hide

The mark is within in my mind and
my soul and my weapon ... desire to kill!
Four winds of evil hear my call ...
Oh! I kill with power!

In the night I turn to be a demon to defeat the
god of love and his fucking heaven's dreams
Satan the ruler of the land screams
with his iron voice in hell
The call of war is rising from the crypts ...
Obey his commands of wrath
