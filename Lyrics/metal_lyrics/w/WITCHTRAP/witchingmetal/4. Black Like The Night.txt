You awake and the metal attacks,
eats your mind and you reveal it.
Make horrible things till your death
and will no rest for a black eternity.
The hell awaits for the Satan's wrath,
there's no escape because your heart is
so black like the night.

[Chorus:]
Possessed enter the flames of the hell
Possessed your brain will consume to the end

Satanas will be in your corpse, you will
lose control trapped by demoniac force.
Metal edge blood runs through
your veins, insanity merciless desires.
Terrible look of assassin,
twisted mind of lunatic.

Don't try to escape, you are Satan's slave
and the metal mighty force forever will be in you
