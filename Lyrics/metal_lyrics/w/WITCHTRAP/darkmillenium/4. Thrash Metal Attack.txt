[originally by Savage Aggression]The Thrashâs return, this is the hour 
Prepare your minds, feel the bore
Violent sound, devilish strings 
Destroy your hand, the war began

Thrash Metal Attack
Thrash Metal Attack!

Raise your guitar, Kill a priest
Stab his heart, and listen to their cries
Theyâre like Thrash Metal
You canât escape to their rites
Their invocations of the evil gods
In name of the Thrash

Thrash Metal Attack
Thrash Metal Attack!
