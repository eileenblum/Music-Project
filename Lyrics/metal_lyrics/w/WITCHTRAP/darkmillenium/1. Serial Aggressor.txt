Know the nonsense war of my natural balance
From my killing personality thereâs no escape
With hatred I laugh and feel the intense pain

Of my dark existence and my life in hell, Hell!
Iâm on the hunt your life is lost
And your reality is agony and pain
I canât be seen, and a disguise is what I am
Fight for your life and make a stand if you can

Can you hear the one thousand thoughts whisper evil in the night?
The dark abyss that you behold is the eye that watches me.
Macabre illusions. Disastrous end. A lunacy preacher is what I am.
Collected bodies. Delivered souls. More will follow once you fall.

Now is your darkest hour and with my knife Iâll force you
Through the fog in the streets, itâs time for the extreme terror
Iâve smelled the adrenaline that floods all your veins
Prepare to die and face your extinction. Die!
