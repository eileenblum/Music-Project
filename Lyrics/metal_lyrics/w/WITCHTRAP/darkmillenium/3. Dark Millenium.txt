A new day is born. Human catharsis is on the go.
New generations without disguise. They are willing to take command.
Itâs time to kill, itâs time to purify. No holy water, but a burning pyre.
They choose their side into a chaos pool. The rumors say the world will end today.

Pray! Theyâre aware of the true of it all.
Hear the fear that echoes from your guilty mind.
Cursed are your forefathersâ souls for what they did.
Load your guns! Now the law is in everybodyâs hands.

Hypocrisy. Power games. Numbers, hope and deception.
Ancient times. Golden realms. Ruins, mummies and dust.
A god to pray. Rules to live, fuck, laugh, work, sleep, shit and die.
Prepare for war. You will win or lose. Four thousand years beneath the sand.

Tomorrowâs children arise today. Theyâre out from jail. They were always free.  
Mankindâs fear gasps for air. Apocalypse is lost and never found.
Torches feed on human flesh. Inquisition in the wrong hands.
Fed up with hunger and misery, their legions want you to know theyâre awake.

Pray! Theyâre aware of the true of it all.
Hear the fear that echoes from your guilty mind.
Cursed are your forefathersâ souls for what they did.
Load your guns! Now the law is in everybodyâs hands.

Illusion. They told you lies. Illusion.
Suffering. They gave you pain. Suffering.

Debate the mystery of life. Do you really care?
Live today tomorrowâs child. The mirror wonât victimize no more. 

Live right away! A new millennium starts today.
Live right away! Forgotten shades burn behind.
