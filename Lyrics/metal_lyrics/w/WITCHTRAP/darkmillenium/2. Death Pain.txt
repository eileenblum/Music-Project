Guilty for sinning and practicing heresy
Cross examination under the laws of the faith.
Nobody can save you even god wouldnât be able.
The verdict has been taken by sadistic brains.

Morbid ejaculation and sadistic lust
The Priest of sin is deluding your soul.
He's making you suffer, He's letting you bleed
youâre begging for mercy and the ending of your grief.

[Pre-chorus:]
The dreams has gone, the nightmare just begun
The Deathpain is in command to deliver you from hell.
All Hope is lost, all torments are born
The Deathpain is the judge that sets you free.

[Chorus:]
Death pain, morbid torment.
Hellish pain, satanic rites.
Death pain, bawdy blood lust.
Hellish pain, sadistically insane.
