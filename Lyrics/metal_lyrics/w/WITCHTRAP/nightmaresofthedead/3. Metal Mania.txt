Come to the show of metal daze
Rise your fist, scream at night
Blackened leather is your uniform
Chain and knife are your weapons
Cut their throats to all the posers
Kill them pigs, take their lives.

Pray to all metal gods and feel the whip of our metal law
Banging your heads like hemmer boring machines
Shout with devotion to hear this black rock &amp; roll.

Metal Mania

Black arts and blasphemy
Metal wizards cast the spell
Atomic blast of sonic sounds
Bestial chants, thunder drums
Mayhemic razor, earthquake roar
Metal load to blow your head.

Pray to all metal gods and feel the whip of our metal law
Banging your heads like hemmer boring machines
Shout with devotion to hear this black rock &amp; roll.

Metal Mania
