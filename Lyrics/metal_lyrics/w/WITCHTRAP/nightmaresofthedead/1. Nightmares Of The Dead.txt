This is the night of full moon rites
The gates are opened in the sky
The warlock begins the call of Kthulu
Final Armageddon the hell will win.

Satan stole your soul from your grave
You can't escape the eternal pain
The demons have a place in your dream
And you feel the nightmares of the dead.

The black witches fly on your grave
Your mind possessed by hell
The torment will never end
Back and face this fucking pain; this is your fate.

Satan stole your soul from your grave
You can't escape the eternal pain
The demons have a place in your dream
And you feel the nightmares of the dead.

The dark and shadows lay an ambush for you
The dogs of hell run behind you, you're pent up in arms of Satan
Don't cry, don't scream; there's nothing to do
Your soul is lost and the mighty snake devours your rotting corpse.
