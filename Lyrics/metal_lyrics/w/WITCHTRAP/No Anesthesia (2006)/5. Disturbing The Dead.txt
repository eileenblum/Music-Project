Profane the sacred grave of the priests and lies
Witches fly around the graveyard as death arises from the ground
When their ashes fly the wind the unborn child is old
Jackals of mine, attack! The better preys are there.

Desecrate them!

Throw the dust and get the soul for the one who cannot die
Never fail or the beast of the Styx will eat your heart in hell
Declaration of war, Armageddon. You must read the spell tonight
Open the coffin, lift up some bones to break the rest beyond.

Desecrate them!

Screams in the night. Watch your back
Your are in danger tonight
Servants of mine will come soon
Straight through the seven gates of hell
Oh! You're messing with evil
Oh! You're messing with death

Defy your gods, open their graves
Take their heads without fear to lose
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Await the children's cry from the underworld.

Oh! You're messing with evil
Oh! You're messing with death
