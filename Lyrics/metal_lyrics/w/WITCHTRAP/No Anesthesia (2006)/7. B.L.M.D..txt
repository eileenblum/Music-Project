Crash of war from the grave by the harlots in leather of hell
Before the dawn of Armageddon our boiling metal is boiling blood
Apocalyptic amps to kill'em all sent for a witching metal strike
Thrashing madness you'll feel around as we inject the poison of our sorceress will.

Black Leather Metal Damnation
Black Leather Metal
Black Leather Metal Damnation
Black Leather Metal

Power of thunder power of storm
Metal and blood come together as one through the heart
Metal invaders and Satan warriors will attack this night
With fury they'll crush the ground

Satan rides the hell's stallion like the lightning flies in the sky
For a metal vengeance kill the posers, in our vendetta, like a dog they will die
Thrasher, fight till death! Delivering the force of the devil's attack
Churches of metal arise from hell as we pray to eurynomous.

Power of thunder power of storm
Metal and blood come together as one through the heart
Metal invaders and Satan warriors will attack this night
With fury they'll crush the ground

Damnation!
