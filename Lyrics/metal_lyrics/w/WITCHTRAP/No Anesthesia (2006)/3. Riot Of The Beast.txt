Witches and wizards joined for preparing the apocalyptic attack.
Tortures and insults to take revenge on the unholy altar
Killers and demons are crazy to fight, no one can't stop their assault
Bullets, cannons and atomic bombs, massacre and destruction

They come to kill â A painful death
To take your life â Riot of the beast.

Cities and bodies burned everywhere their pain will never stop
Priests and monks are praying for mercy but there's nothing to do
Soldiers of hell are coming again destroying the rest of the earth
Nowhere to run and no where to hide you must wait for your death

You can't escape â To die in pain
The damage is done â Riot of the beast.
