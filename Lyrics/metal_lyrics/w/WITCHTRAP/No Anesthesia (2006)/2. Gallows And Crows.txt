The gate of hell is opened. This country is in disgrace
Apocalyptic madness. Hellish pets and plagues
There is no one to blame, but someone here must pay
Thousands will die burnt, hung or killed by the sword

Gallows and crows and rats everywhere
A terrible curse has fallen here
You'd better get away or else.

Children of Satan's creed recite the spells of death
Nobody can't escape this creepy hand of doom.
This land is wasted now. Your prayers were not heard
There's only darkness, there's only death.

Gallows and crows and rats everywhere
A terrible curse has fallen here
You'd better get away or else.

...You're damned.
