[performed by Witchtrap]There was a hole; a hidden door to escape from hell.
Religion failed to keep him tied. Just pay attention and hear him laugh.
Pray, pray, pray! Because heâs nearer, nearer, nearer!
Sentenced to constriction; Satanâs grasp infliction.

The witches let him go. Now the devilâs on the loose.
Heâs lurking out somewhere. Now he will rape and kill.
All children are possessed. All young girls gasp in lust.
So keep on praying to God, but heâs not here tonight.

Drunk on the carnage. Never satisfied with the rampage.
Chaos after the sabotage. Master plan of the damned ones.
Cry, cry, cry! Heâs in command, command, command!
Poisonous bite attack; Luciferâs jaws in your neck

The witches let him go. Now the devilâs on the loose.
Heâs lurking out somewhere. Now he will rape and kill.
All children are possessed. All young girls gasp in lust.
So keep on praying to God, but heâs not here tonight.

So keep on praying to not avail.

Pray, pray, pray! Heâs nearer, nearer, nearer!
Cry, cry, cry! Heâs in command, command, command!

The witches let him go. Now the devilâs on the loose.
Heâs lurking out somewhere. Now he will rape and kill.
All children are possessed. All young girls gasp in lust.
So keep on praying to God, but heâs not here tonight.
