Finally we have received the power from beyond
After sacrificing countless victims
The gods of death have granted us their force
No nation shall stand our lethal onslaught

Blood and steel - Apocalyptic evil storm
Wake up and see the world begin to die

Breathe the WINDS OF WAR
And death !!!
Breathe the WINDS OF WAR.

This damnation is taking its course
Our hatred rages battle after battle
We will feed on the hearts of those defeated
And our dark lords will claim their graveless souls

Blood and steel - Apocalyptic evil storm
Wake up and see the world begin to die.

Breathe the WINDS OF WAR
And death !!!
Breathe the WINDS OF WAR.

Finally we have received the power from beyond
After sacrificing countless victims
The gods of death have granted us their force
No nation shall stand our lethal onslaught

Blood and steel - Apocalyptic evil storm
Wake up and see the world begin to die

Breathe the WINDS OF WAR
And death !!!
Breathe the WINDS OF WAR.
