All of you who are laughing still
are gonna know the price to pay.
A merciless treatment awaits you.
You'll feel the hammer of our law.

Under my hand you'll cry in pain.
You'll never see me broken hearted.
All metal forces will take revenge in war
With Satan killing in command.

You'll have to taste my knife
and PAY IN BLOOD.
You've got to die tonight
In pools of blood.

Your mockery has fed our hatred,
But our pride is sharp as steel.
As we march like rabid dogs
Anyone can't stop us now !!!

No chance to fight you are to lose.
My spite I spit at your face.
All metal forces will take this goddamned town,
With Satan riding in command.

You'll have to taste my knife
and PAY IN BLOOD.
You've got to die tonight
In pools of blood.

Blood !!!

Under my hand you'll cry in pain.
You'll never see me broken hearted.
All metal forces will take revenge in war
With Satan killing in command.

You'll have to taste my knife
and PAY IN BLOOD.
You've got to die tonight
In pools of blood and gore !!!
