A lot of years ago, I was attacked by some nightmares
In which some awful fiends involved me in the arts of sin.
Since those days, I led many through the dark ways of hell,Â 
Receiving as payment, all kinds of riches in this earthly life.

Take my hand future Satan's child.
Follow me and receive this new life.

I am spell bound and DAMNED TO THE CORE.
Hell bound I am. In hell I will burn. [x2]

Letâs Burn!

I've been dealing with Satan in black masses and rituals
He gave me the power and made me king to destroy any bound.
All this might be yours, just chant with me this forbidden rhyme.
And follow the sign that leads through the path to win.

Take my hand future Satan's child.
Follow me and receive this new life.

I am spell bound and DAMNED TO THE CORE.
Hell bound I am. In hell I will burn. [X2]
My soul will burn.
