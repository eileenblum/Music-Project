A damnation of death from satan's domain
Has come to this world to bring a destructive boiling hell
By a nuclear ghost mankind will die
Possessed by the flames, obssessed and insane. Die Now !!!

A choir of angles cries on the throne that god has left
There is no way to escape and save your soul from hell.

Ride to Hell !!!

Solitude and despair. there's no hope to survive
Useless prayers have rotten as mortals are lost in a grave.
So the acid attacked and corroded our bones
and burnt all remains, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

A choir of angles cries on the throne that god has left
There is no way to escape and save your soul from hell.
