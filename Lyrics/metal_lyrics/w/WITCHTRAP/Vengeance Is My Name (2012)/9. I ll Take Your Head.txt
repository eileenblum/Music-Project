Vengeance, hatred.
Poisoned arrows I'm casting tonight.
Sacrifice rituals.
Powers of Hades exchanged for blood.
Times of war, times of death.
Like a hammer I'll grind the bones of my foe.
No god can save your life
while I am in search for the secret of steel.

Friend of no one, you have come too far.
Disbeliever, you betray to win.
Shameless bastard, your eyes will feed the crows
Hours after I have pulled your head off !!!

Secrecy, conspiracy.Â 
Your only weapons are useless to me.
With sword in hand loyalty I've sworn
To my brothers and sisters of metal tonight.
No gate of hell, no guardian
can keep me apart from the powers I claim.Â 
You're better off hidden well,
but anyway there's no chace to survive.

Friend of no one, you have come too far.
Disbeliever, you betray to win.
Shameless bastard, your eyes will feed the crows
Hours after I have pulled your head off !!!

Consider the bastard dead !!!

Friend of no one, your rummors came to an end.
Disbeliever, now your home is cursed.
Shameless bastard, there's piss upon your grave
Days after I have got your head off

Off !!!

Vengeance, hatred.
Poisoned arrows I'm casting tonight.
Sacrifice rituals.
Powers of Hades exchanged for blood.
Times of war, times of death.
Like a hammer I'll grind the bones of my foe.
No god can save your life
while I am in search for the secret of steel.

The secret of steel !!!
