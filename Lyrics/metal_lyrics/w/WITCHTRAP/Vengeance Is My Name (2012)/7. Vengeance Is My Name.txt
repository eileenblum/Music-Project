My mind was born from deceit and treason.
I was exiled from my realm and my home.
Their mockery hurt my pride and my name.
Thereâs a price you will pay.

I will come back to take revenge,
Because VENGEANCE IS MY NAME.

Iâm stalking you in every place night and day.
Your blood will run over my arms when Iâll see you die.
The last thing you'll see will be my foot stomping your face,
âcause now itâs my turn.

Now I am back to take revenge,
Because VENGEANCE IS MY NAME.

VENGEANCE IS MY NAME. [x2]

VENGEANCE IS MY NAME. [x2]

All of youâre gonna die.
You shall die by my hand.
You will die.
AAARRRGGGHHH !!!
