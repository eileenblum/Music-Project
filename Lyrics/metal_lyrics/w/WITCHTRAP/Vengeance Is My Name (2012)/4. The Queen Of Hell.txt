From the depths of the Styx, beyond the human mind,
A loving curse on me makes me blind and kneel.
Her sweet flaming skin, her eyes of a snake.
A hellish caress takes me to the deepest dream of lust.

A succubus lover - Sheâs THE QUEEN OF HELL.
A sexual possession - Sheâs THE QUEEN OF HELL.

In the forbidden books, in the unknown charms,
A tempting magic touch embraces all of me
On the altar of love, at the most lustful time.
Iâll lose my soul forever in her body hungry for love.

A succubus lover - Sheâs THE QUEEN OF HELL.
A sexual possession - Sheâs THE QUEEN OF HELL.

A succubus lover - Sheâs THE QUEEN OF HELL.
A sexual possession - Sheâs THE QUEEN OF HELL.

Sheâs THE QUEEN OF HELL.
In the forbidden books !!!
