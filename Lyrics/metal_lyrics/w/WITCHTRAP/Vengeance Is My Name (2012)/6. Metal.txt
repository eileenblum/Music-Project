A hidden land in the shadows
from beyond the underworld.
A secret metal army legion
is rising in fury from the unknown.
Hundreds of long haired metalheads
dressed in jeans, leather, boots and chains.
They appear like an evil pest
when the sun is coming to an end.

Metalhead, where are you going to go
No one knows, if that's hell or worse
With your boots on stand up and survive
Metal Maniac, you praise the albums
You praise the songs of METAL.

Somewhere in the city's depths
no one goes out from the alley.
You can hear through the thrashing air
rocking screams of a metal crowd.
All of them rise their iron arms
with the sign to defy the sky.
A stampede of many metalheads
tearing down the morals of your town.

Metalhead, where are you going to go
No one knows, if that's hell or worse
With your boots on stand up and survive
Metal Maniac, you praise the albums
You praise the songs of METAL.

Bang your Heads !!!
Here it comes M.E.T.A.L.
Once again M.E.T.A.L.

Metalhead, where are you going to go
No one knows, if that's hell or worse
With your boots on stand up and survive
Metal Maniac, you praise the albums
You praise the songs of METAL.
Alright !!!
