Dark void swallow me whole, drag me to the darkest hole, deep down into the ground, so my body can never be found

I take a breath but i choke on dust, i start walking in to the emptiness

In the cold hard earth of hell, i have found my place of rest, let me ssuffer let me stay, please devil, let me lay

[Chorus:]
When our bodies have turned to dust,
Left with nothing but this putrid mess
Sinking further into the abyss, humanity will not be missed

Wake the monster, from the sea, a killing machine from the coldest deep
As he rises, the ocean parts, he has come to consume your heart

I am the black, hand of death
Chioke you cold, cease your breath
Butchered like a pig
For the wolves to feeeed
