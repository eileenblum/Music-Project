Flares from the dying sun
Drill a hole into the ocean floor
Seething the surface of waves
As smoke erupts
From the cave

I tried I tried to appease the evil
Growing fast in the bottom of my heart,
But I know It will devour me,
Use my body to feast.

Lurking over my every move,
Wish for my time to come
Praying praying that I lose my hold
But my blood will never run cold.

Over and over I make the same mistakes
My soul is ready for death to take
The stones guarding the devils crypt
Will rot away in a flood of filth

Nail my body to a tree and let the crows devour me

Black blood drips from my throat but I'm still breathing,
In the last month of daylight, when the darkness comes none will survive.
