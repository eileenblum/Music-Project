Searching in the ever lasting abyss for a cure for this scourge
Only complete nothingness can absolve this curse
Murder of the cardinals the sacred rite will burn
Only the blood of child can save this earth

Rise of the damned

When the son of death, lays his head on the earth where we rest, listening for a pulse or a sign of life there will be nothing to hear
When the wolf of hell, spurts her fiery breath

Do you believe in the afterlife, that in the end, we don't just die
Dark creature from the hole, please take my dying soul

My breath is cold if i draw breath at all, and my skin is made of stone
I grow so old but i will never die, i will live on until the end of time

Searching in the ever lasting abyss for a cure for this scourge
Only complete nothingness can absolve this curse

And ill be free to roam, when death takes me home.
