I am ready, ready to die
So put your coins over my eyes
I hope to god they manage to bury me,
In the chasm at the bottom of the sea.

I'm not sorry for everything
That I ever did to you
But no one will find the pieces
No one will know the truth

Save me from becoming, the demon from which I'm running
Scared to sleep close my eyes my demons follow right by my side
Dogs of the older gods,
Petted like the hounds of war
Guarding the throne of the vanquisher.

Who'd have thought life could be so cruel
I wish I could have choked in my mothers womb

Save myself from the pain of living
In a world where loved ones die
And I just keep on breathing

I will burn will a loving smile
As I'm melted into the ground
In time you will come to learn
Why this filthy earth will burn
