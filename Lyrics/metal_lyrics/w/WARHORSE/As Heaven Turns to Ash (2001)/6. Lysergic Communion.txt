[Music-Hubbard, Orne/Lyrics-Hubbard] 

Alter of dawn, bury me in light 
Crimson eclipse, blood and body ignite 
Lysergic communion, thy cup runneth over 

Ascend through the trees as the landscape fades 
Disciple of the sun, the red horizon cascades 
Burning away the masks meant to hide 
Writhing becoming the demon inside 

The battel rages for the church of the sun 
Victorious, I dethrone the chosen one 

Defeated cast the weak to the sea 
Perched upon my throne, immortal deity 
My kingdom of flames, my servents the stars 
A prophecy revealed through all of my scars
