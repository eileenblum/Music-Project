[Music-Hubbard/Lyrics-Hubbard] 

Razors scrape away the decay 
From the inside 
Until this shell is empty 
The stench of failure is cleansed with hate 

Bound 

Have nothing 
Need nothing 
Am nothing but scars 

Lost and forgotten pile of shit 
Glaring up from the bottom 
Feed hunger, consume it whole 
Scribble disdain with blood upon the wall 

Vomit belief, struggle to suffer 
Leave me alone, I'm at one with grief 
Save your pity for someone who needs it 
Purged of the will to live 
I'm better now 

Have nothing 
Need nothing 
Have nothing but scars
