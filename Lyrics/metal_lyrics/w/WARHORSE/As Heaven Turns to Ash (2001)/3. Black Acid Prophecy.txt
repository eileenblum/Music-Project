[Music-Hubbard, Laskowski/Lyrics-Hubbard, Orne] 

The narcotic priest vows vengeance 
Upon the righteous, with chalice held high 
Crushed by the cross held to dear 
Betrayed by their faith as they cry 

Communion complete, the masses helpless 
Servents in the eyes of the new god 
The temple resounds with hymns of allegience 
On your knees and witness the birth of a king 

Black acid dreams, the moon turns to blood 
Black acid dreams, the deafening silence 

The mind's eye weeps the blood of a thousand ancients 
A chasm of infinity awaits, helpless and broken 
A serpent's kiss, eyes of blood, wings of fire 
Follow him to the Anti-Eden, Piper of the wicked 

Black acid concubine, your soul is mine 
Melting temples echo with the hymns of doom 
Prophecies become existance 
Cower and behold the death of hope 

Black acid prophecies 
Guardian of forever
