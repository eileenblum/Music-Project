[Music-Hubbard, Orne/Lyrics-Orne] 

Might King Osric 
Lord and usurper 
Solemn strength of times gone 
Great triumphs mean nothing 
Noble pillar stands 
Stone pride defines time 
Ever all knowing time 

Following endless serpents of Jade 
Weary travellers on the crossroads of life 
Driven by hatred braided with hope 
Searching for truth past 
Appolonia... 

Sing to the winds 
Where the earth meets the sky 
Sing to the winds 
Scream to the sky
