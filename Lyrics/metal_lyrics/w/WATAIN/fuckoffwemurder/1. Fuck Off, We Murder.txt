[originally by GG Allin]Here I sit alone with a bullet in my gun
On it is the name of everyone
I hate you, I wanna kill you one by one
Worthless human flesh that I kill
I'm the untamed animal

Do I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
No I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!

The act of killing you will be my high
Every life I steal, I multiply
Fuck off bastard, fuck off bitch
They'll find you full of maggots rotting in a ditch

Waiting with my mind, the things I hate the most
People pass me by, I see nothing but a ghost
Now it's time to cast the shadow of a doubt
I'm here for bloody murder, I'm here to wipe you out

Do I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
No I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!

The taste of blood takes me further
The taste of blood takes me further
Do I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!
No I feel compassion? No!
Do I feel love? No!

Fuck off, we murder
Fuck off, we murder
Fuck off, we murder
Fuck off, we murder
Fuck off, we murder
Fuck off, we murder
Fuck off, we murder
Fuck off, we murder
