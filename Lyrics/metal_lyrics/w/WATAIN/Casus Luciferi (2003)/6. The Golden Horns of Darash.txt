All ysop burnt, all fruits are poisoned 
Zaddik failed and Zebaoth lost, 
The lambs are banished, the temple is soiled 
March on white ruin, infernal host 

So come forth, Lord of the triple number 
Rise, oh trinity of DEATH, DEATH and DEATH 
Burn this vermin world in its most deep slumber 
And to all of Sheob, give the sulphur breath 

Blacken all their ghastly colours 
And freeze to scorn their charity warmth 
Smear our sin to their most pure innocense 
And nail them all to the cross!!! 

For they live to die, we die to live 
Our beginning is their end! 
While they fall with twelve, we rise with seven 
So wake the astral serpent by Thy pale hand!!! 

All ysop burnt, all fruits are poisened 
Adonai failed and Elohim lost 
The lambs are slaughtered, our temple shines golden 
Crawl on your ruin, seraphic host ... 

And my tongue speaks ancient names 
Forbidden psalms above the flames 
My heart pumps but void into my veins 
My puls runs slow, too slow for chains 
For chains that tie me down to earth 
For chains that keep up this organic curse 

...for I see horns... 
...golden horns... 
...for I see horns... 
...HORNS!!!!!!!...
