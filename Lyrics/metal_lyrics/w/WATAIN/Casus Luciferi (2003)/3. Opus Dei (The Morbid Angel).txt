And all that is holy, holy shall be... 
Let the light bless and 
let these words proclaim the blessing. 
Let the seal be broken and let the light prevail; 
Let the earth be scorched and let the light prevail; 
Let the wrath cleanse the world from opposition... 

...and let heaven spew brimstone on sin! 

And all that is holy, holy shall be... 
Let alive the word's proclamation, 
Let the laws of The Books be the laws of the earth; 
Let humanity be sin and let denial be bliss; 
Let the wars cleanse the world and 
let their fear show their path. 

Let the Light reign over Man and beast, 
let the Lord strike the sinners with plague, 
let the Lord our God reign for eternity; 
and all that is Holy, Holy shall be... 

For the carnal and earthly mouths of Christ 
He has made blind and as vices they are 
Let their words and acts be spears and be chains 
Tormenting the weeping face of their god 

From the valley of Sodom to the hill of Harmageddon 
Behold the holocaustclouds and heed the trumpet's roar 
A Charge more forceful than ever witnessed 
May the Angels of Heaven shed the blood of Man 

Behold, the new and true Gospel, 
the words come from the Lord himself, 
Redemtion through death! 
Salvation through fire! 

And all that is holy, holy shall be... 
Let the light bless and 
let these words proclaim the blessing. 
Let the seal be broken and let the light prevail; 
Let the earth be scorched and let the light prevail; 
Let the wrath cleanse the world from opposition... 

...and let heaven spew brimstone on sin! 

Let the prophets of double voices free 
And in Gehinnoms splendour eternally 
Let them BURN for their true majesty 
And all that is Holy, Holy shall be!!!
