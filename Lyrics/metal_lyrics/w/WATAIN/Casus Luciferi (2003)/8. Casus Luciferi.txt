From the vaults below the deserttemple 
To the throne among the stars 
In the hearts of us, your children, oh divine luminary 
Thou shineth! 
Like sunbeams penetrating the foundations of the earth 
Thine grace ignites the seeds of creation 
And in our veins is stillness, as your shadows come to life 
For they are like whispers speaking of 
...death in heaven 

Behold the black cloud of corpselike birds 
Their wings are on fire 
And their song has turned backwards 
A morbid cacaphony singing of... 
A new dawn! 

Burn my flesh, thou light of lights 
Most eminent perfection, most magnificent of sights 
Mark me with thee, stainless Ar 
Most real, so clear and bright they shine both eye and star 
Descend upon the dead, black sky 
By a grace of just one glance they all shall die 
Pour the bitter wine of salvation into our blood 
And let our scars form rivers flooding the kingdom of their god 

Let the immense gates of heaven open 
Let the dawn of justice come 
When a thousand pale and silenced faces 
Turn towards the sky 
To behold in fear and wonder how the firmanent turns dark 
By the sound of a lonely trumpet calling 
And countless birdlike carrions falls reeking from above 
Embedded in a red glow telling of... 
A burning dawn! 

For this sunrise shall not wake you by the foul light of Christ 
But by Satan's fire burning in your eyes 
And the thundering voice of a lion over the plains of man 
Shall proclaim the horned phoenix final rise 
For it is not rain that falls tonight from the black, ominious sky 
But sulphur tears from the last flock of birds 
And the wind carries the smell of death, from the agony in their hearts 
As the fly in nameless fear towards... 
Luciferion!
