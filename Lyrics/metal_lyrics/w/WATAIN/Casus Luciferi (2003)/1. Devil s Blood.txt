Ageless, eternal in grace 
Behold the snake of temptation! 
Eyes gleaming with wisdom 
Tounges telling of truths inversed 
I have swallowed the hanged mans semen 
With necrophageous delight 
And let the Devil enter 
With all his might 

And in unbearable shame, enlighted by your fathomless dark 
I kneel unto thee, father, i am opened 
Let your daggers pierce through and their poisonous grace be unleashed 
through these hungering veins 
The impurest of blood, the greatest of pains!!! 

The Devils blood 
The curse of salvation 
The odious essence 
of His holy revelation 
It floats from the garden of eden 
In malevolent grace 
The Devil's blood 
Through the pentagram's maze 

To open the gates to where deformations form 
To unearthly mysteries and fire 
From stigmatized wounds now the river of gnosis runs free 
In the glorious light of the five point star 

Darkness, starlight in eyes 
The path reveals so clear now 
I drink my own blood yet the taste is not mine 
I behold my reflection yet noone stares back 
Driven by a lifeless hunger 
Must have it stilled 
Drop by drop, curse by curse 
Until all three cups are filled 

This soul prayeth not for victory, but for loss 
This body kneeleth not in vain, but in blood 
These eyes seeth not nil, but truth 
These words are spoken not by me, but through 

The Devils blood 
The curse of salvation 
The odious essence 
of His holy revelation 
From the tounges of the serpent 
Into chalices three 
The Devil's blood 
Runneth through me!
