He lives through me 
All of what I am 
The needle of hamartia 
Injected in the flesh of man 
With the soul of a carrion 
Sleeping, yet awake 
For underneath this skin 
Crawls eden's cursed snake 

Hic est draco caudam suam devorans! 

You may have felt it's cold 
Carressing down your spine 
Gently yet with strength 
And with a morbid touch 
For its real shape is a razor 
Smeared with the Devil's seed 
And infected with it's plauge 
Are the scars from which I bleed 

I am the earth 
Chained to horns 
Its ground is my flesh 
Pierced by Holy thorns 
I am the earth 
Burning deep within 
It's water is my blood 
Blackened by my sins 

Swallowed by His mystery 
Lots within it's maze 
The bridges behind they burn 
from the pyres of Hell's grace 
One after another 
The stars fade into black 
He has called my name 
There is no way back... 

Pierced by His will 
Trapped within His lair 
My flesh shall be the sign 
Of that fires are to fear 
For those who walk upon me 
Shall be punished for their turns 
I am the earth 
And within me the Devil burns! 

I am the earth 
In the shadow of the Lord 
A crucifix of flesh 
Yet sinfully adored 
I am the earth 
As your life with me does blend 
I am His truth 
The world without end... 

The world without end.
