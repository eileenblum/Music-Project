I ascend.
As thy light descends -
Darkening the I to reveal the Self.
The rays of Gnosis are burning yet liberating.
In a blissful imposition of the primal paradox.
Ultimate and all-embracing.
For as above - so below.
As I am lying beyond where mental winds blow.
Release me now, oh saviour of Anti-Cosmos.
Ignite in me the fire of the storming triple 6.
Now oh god of wrath,
Unchained in you to burn,
Rape and destruct!

Astaroth open my eye!
And let the beast regain his sight.
A gift from Azerate.
A path way back - to thy Thoughtless Light!
Legions of the Black Light!
Chosen sons of snakes.
A burning wrath reveals the Black Sun.

Black Sun Ascends. Forevermore.
Granted to the elected is the key to Chaos core.
Judge me now oh shining one, by blood and fire.
To wield thy sword, oh Lord and Master.
The eleventh and the first.
Whose wordless word echoes Chaos!

Oh firebringer of the Nightside.
Thy light illuminates our Temple,
As we march towards the Other Side...

Legions of the Black Light.
Chosen sons of snakes.
A burning wrath reveals the Black Sun.
Legions of the Black Light.
Chosen sons of snakes.
A burning wrath now unveils the Black Sun.
