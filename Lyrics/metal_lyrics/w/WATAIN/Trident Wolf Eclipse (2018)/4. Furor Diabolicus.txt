Come winds of force, brandish your scepter
Slash through the cobwebs of time
Blow the dust away
From the tombs and from the shrine
Like riots that stir in the heart of men
Such must be the work of our kin
Peaceless, restless, ceaseless
Destruction!

Of all that tie us down
Whatever blocks the path

Riotous procession from the abyss
Predatory pilgrim fiends
Stalwart leather rebels stamp
Triumphant satanist march
Subterranean outbreak, upheaval of submission
And their inevitable fall

Black rattle the banner
Against the heavens of the heart
Where demons soar
And thunder roars
At Satan's call

Furor diabolicus - eruption's ascension
Furor diabolicus - wrath of the gods

No escape and yet you fly
A will to live that soon will die

Furor diabolicus - madness of the abyss
Furor diabolicus - breathing chasm depths

Wild and fierce, the storm is coming
No time for when and how
Did you think it would wait forever?
The time is now

Come winds of force, brandish your scepter
Slash through the cobwebs of time
Blow the dust away
From the tombs and from the shrines
Like riots that stir in the heart of men
Such must be the work of our kin
Peaceless, restless, ceaseless
Furor diabolicus
