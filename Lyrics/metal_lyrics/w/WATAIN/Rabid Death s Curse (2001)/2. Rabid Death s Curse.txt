Born into a fatal illness
Ascension unto a graceless sphere
Yet the chain forged in sulphurfires
Emerges with them through labias lair
The stench, the curse, the sacrilege divine
The enduring of rupturing cold
Brought to life, crushed to dust
By an impenetrable presence of dark

Incarnation of plagues and of longdead pests
Fornication of all brought to life
Shadow majestic, spell infernal
At the core of mankind as a lifefeasting tumor

This curse if to haunt and to kill and to crush
For it's claws are the flesh of all life
It's eyes are the souls that burns at hell's heart
The ones who are blessed from it's strife
This plague is to die and again to be reborn
Through eternity and beyond
For it is life, the rabid death's curse
Cast by the firstborn, never to be gone

Of sharpened steel and of hanging ropes
Is the cure of this illness made
For all lives that walk are possessed by a curse
And in the end it all shall fade

Blessed from the filth
Touched by the mystery
Caressed by the dark
Left as a snake to crawl and to curse

May the seas they boil
And the napalm rain
Let mankind fade
For still it shall reign
Behold the burning of earth
And your feeble creation
Still cosmos shall tremble
Beneath his domination
