Show me the face of uttermost madness
Reveal the mystery of time reversed
For in chaos lies mights forgotten
From which we all have emerged

Crawling from wombs - a vast reflection
A rupturing from deformed flesh
Yet a false revelation, a pointless effort
For the truth of all life is Death.

For your bodies form a giant shape
That cast shadows across all lands
Filled with the greatest of emptiness
Falling as it stands
A crucifix of flesh and bones
Lifeless, yet trembling in fear
For as sulphurflames are it's conscious
And the smothering is near

Emptiness spawn, pale stillborn breed
Blinded at birth and forever to be
His tusks pierced through eyelids and tongue
Not even Death can set you free

..sense the smell of burning flesh

A titanic symbol of death's overture
Impaled on behorned pain
The limb crucifix, built on remains
Of the cursed breed of Cain
It cries and it suffers, burning within
Reaching towards the sky
Anguish shaped by bloodstained flesh
A shadow of Satan, longing to die
