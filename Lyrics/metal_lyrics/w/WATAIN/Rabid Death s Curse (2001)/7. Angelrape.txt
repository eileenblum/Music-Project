Feel the coming of a storm
Of wrath burning red as blood
Thundering forth
With poison in veins and death in the eyes
Under banners as mirrors reflecting
The darkness above and below
And the eye...
The eye that is him

Bonecrush, bloodlust
Behold the remains of Jehovah in the dust
Suffocate, Desecrate
For Satan's return - Angelrape

Warlust fill my veins
As bullets in the heart of humanity
Darkness drown me
As carnal shreds of light soaked in blood
Cursed to wander
And to eternally despise
Forever to stride
For evil never dies...

The beauty of destruction
The passion of death
Immortalized
In your ashes

Bonecrush, bloodlust
Behold the remains of Jehovah in the dust
Suffocate, Desecrate
For Satan's return - Angelrape
