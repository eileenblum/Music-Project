Created by them
Yet reborn through Him
Blessed from life and lie
For the cunts that are licked
By your gentle tongues
Are raped and cursed to die
So far beyond
Your rottening grace
Yet trapped in smelling chains
For the bodies you caress
I have cursed
And put cancer in their veins

The blazes in the night called stars
Are reflections of your kind
Pallid and fading lives
Spawned and guarded by darkness behind

For what dwells behind those flames
Is hidden for your eyes
And just one single glance
Would transform your smiles into cries

There is a war in my heart
While yours is thorned by my nails
For you are nothing but dead
Beneath those carnal veils

Rejoice as emptiness grow thicker
Feel it's grasp around your neck
The hour has come to release
And to welcome the razorsharp fate

Feel the jaws of the snake
Slaves under cosmic contempt
Mortem sibi consciscere
Your key to achievement
