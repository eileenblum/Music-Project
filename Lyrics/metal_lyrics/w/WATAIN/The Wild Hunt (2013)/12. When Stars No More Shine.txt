[Limited Edition Bonus Track]Lucifer
Fallen seraphim
I call your name
The sum of the forces
Of blackening malice
Akin once again

When stars no more shine
Weeds shall rime
When sun no more smiles
Upon christian ground

We are those who dwell in the days
In the heart of the utmost darkness
We are torn to savour the arts
Of Satans majesty

A notion of God
Is there to behold
Burnt ashes
In their black graves

No lights to be seen
Forever, stars away
As this words
His majestic ways

We are those who dwell in the days
In the heart of the utmost
We are torn to savour the arts
Of Satans majesty

When stars no more shine
Weeds shall rime
When sun no more smiles
Upon christian ground

We shall gather when
Stars shines no longer
Bring damnation upon us
And we will grow stronger
