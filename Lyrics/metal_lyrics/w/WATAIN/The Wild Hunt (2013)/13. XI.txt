[Wolf Wear Edition Box Set 7" Track][Performed and recorded by Watain during the WILD HUNT sessions.][Music and lyrics by Jon NÃ¶dtveit and Set Tetian]

Awake!
GeburimÂ´s blood screeams within my veins
pumping free, fierce and proud
Resounding the Key
Of the Eleven
Roaring aloud...

+VEDAR-GAL-TIEKALS
SOMDUS-AZERATE+

Harbringers of a higher justice
Which knows no laws
Now bow your heads
In fear and Awe
Bow down your heads
In terror and Awe

Elevenfoltd curse
Upon traitors and enemies
Of our Gods and creed
We have NOT forgotten...
And we wonÂ´t forgive!

Your spilled blood shall be the wine
Of the wrathful ones
Quenching their thrist
It shall open wide the gate
And hasten their return!

Hail unto Our Master far beyond the stars
Who plougs them all
Annihilate the enslaver
And all his hosts

(As) The Eleven Angels I call upon:

MOLOCH
BELZEBUTH
LUCIFUGE
ASTAROTH
ASMODEUS
BELPHEGOR
BAALTZELMOTH
ADRAMELECH
LILITH
NAAMAH
SATAN

H. â Drums
P. â Guitars
E. â Vocals, Bass
