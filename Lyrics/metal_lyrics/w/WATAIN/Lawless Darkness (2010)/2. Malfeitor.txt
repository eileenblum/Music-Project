By the blessing of shunned Gods
the cord of life was deformed, twisted into a noose
to strangle the miscarriage of the I
upon which he shall feast that was spawned
by the semen of horror's fertile
as his many limbs extend across the Abyss
thirteen horns and a million tusks
in a thousand jaws that breathe
only to chew the chains that tie him to Assiah
and titan is their strength

Metamorphosphordus malformation
your's is the call I follow
astride the wings of Death
to the crossroads

Malfeitor, the master and servant in unity
at one with the Abyss when in your possession I am
against the blindness of men
thine eyes have been granted immunity
so that my sight be clear when wielding the Sword of the Damned

For I am begotten of the virgin whore
as truth and torment, priest and warrior
now behold as I pervert and destroy their law
as the image of my philius moists the labia of Shekinah
for dark are the desires that dwell within my heart
and the Devil is in my kiss

Yes he is

Malfeitor!
in your possession I am
twilight god of transformation
at the crossroads we meet again
I'll pace the path of madness with your banner held high
to the death's head true
yes, I am of my father the Devil and the lusts of my father I will do
