A virgin of divinity
raped in disgrace of the sanctuary
betrayed by the worshiped one
no longer can she bear this on her own
this blasphemous deceit
of the fallen one

And as she collapses on her knees
the blood pours out of the womb

Confined in the darkest pit
incarnating all who oppose her
and in this endless wrath
she is crowned the empress of death

Kneel before thy lord
the dark one hears not you pray
and your bright god
slaughtered by the fallen
bringer of eternal pain

Slaughtered by the fallen one
the bringer of eternal pain

Your god slaughtered by the fallen one
the bringer of eternal pain

The Almighty tremble with fear
they beg for mercy
which they did not receive
as she rips and she tears
through their skin and their flesh
disfigures what is left
of their corpses
and she spits and she chews
the remains are in bits
blessed corpses

Kneel before thy lord
the dark one hears not you pray
and your bright god
slaughtered by the fallen
bringer of eternal pain

Your perfect god is dead
slaughtered by the fallen one
the bringer of eternal pain
your perfect god is fucking dead
