A sequence of events
has led us to a point
this point of no return
we are unable to look back

Finally our calls are being answered
for what we have craved so long
at last they have arrived
the ancients from afar

The portal twists the space and time into a bridge of an anomaly
a passage through our world to the depths of the beyond
it is a space of standstill where our laws do not apply
a single glimpse into its hollow pit forever lost in time

Our calls are being answered
for what we have craved so long
at last they have arrived
the ancients from afar

Now blinded by the light as the gates begin to glare
a substance of unknown combines to form a shape
paralyzed we slowly drown into its empty void
dying out faithfully our pathetic race

A sequence of events
has led us to this point of no return
we are unable to look back
Finally our calls are being answered
for what we have craved so long
at last they have arrived
the ancients from afar

This was our last warning
annihilation of our worthless kind
blacked out erased from existence
replaced by its superior

As the final moment draws
the secrets of our life revealed before our eyes
a single tear withers in the abyss of emptiness
our life is drained and lost for an eternity
This was our last chance

The ancient overseers
the creationist of our own
their malevolent hands manipulating our world
yet now we are scorned
no remorse for this race or this home we've squandered
humans are shunned
humans are worthless
our negligence is deserving of our ill fate
