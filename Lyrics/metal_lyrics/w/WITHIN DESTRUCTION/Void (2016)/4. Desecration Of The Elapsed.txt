A barren wasted tomb
where I subsist my mournful soul
through a haunted habit
that slipped into oblivion

This is no obnoxious deed
it is my only need to live
the dead Iâve forgotten
now I cut them up to feed

A stinging thrust pierced through the chest
dissects the perfect pale skin
as the urge to feast bursts through my veins
one simply could not resist

And as the urge to feast burns through my veins
one simply could not resist

This urge is unbearable
To feast upon the flesh of your breathing carcass

This demon of corruption
nestless in my soul
it whispers in the daylight
redirects me through nightfall

On that dreadful nightfall
I tore your limbs apart
I felt the warmth of your entrails
washed down my throat

This demon of corruption
nestless in my soul
it whispers through daylight
redirects me through nightfall
