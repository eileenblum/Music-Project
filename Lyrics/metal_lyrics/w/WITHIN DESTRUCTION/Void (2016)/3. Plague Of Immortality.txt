In this place of being with celestial pride
stands a monument of eternal sin
devoted to our false perception
of what awaits beyond the gates of doom
all hell breaks free

The dead stand up from their grave
they slaughter the living and feast on their flesh

And above the ocean of rotting corpses
I shall place my blackened throne
the disciple of the false creator
to rule this endless night

Veins of thorn break through the wasted soil
sky collapses beneath dark veils
as the world fades into decay

In this place of ruin now the shadows dwell
stained by the plague of immortality
they are addicted to absorption
of the dying pitiful one
