A splice of the ascendant with a mortal detestation
blighted by the stigma of the disaffected roots
with no aspiration for the grace of our creation
it flows beneath the skin with affection for damnation

Bring forth the hellfire from within
bear witness to the assembly of a bastard god
gaze at the sky burned in a blaze
hear the scream of a hopeless cry

As the closing relic of all life dissolves
And the rot scatters through the heart
the dissolution of existence
is relinquished over time

Behold the up rise of an ancient
a celestial, manifested from the ashes
and a rebirth of an inverted world
cleansed with the sickness of the parasite

And a rebirth of an inverted word
a rebirth of our dead word

Bring forth the hellfire from within
bear witness to the assembly of a bastard god
gaze at the sky burned in a blaze
hear the scream of a hopeless cry
