You deserve better than this
my last words to her
my conclusion to our coexistence

Why must you suffer here
why must you suffer

Let me make it easier
this will only sting a bit

Why did you have to suffer

And she did not refuse
I watched her throat
paint the floor red

Always wanted to
look into her eyes
while she was dying

Is it wrong to bleed tears of joy in this moment
I felt her heartbeat slow down and her soul descend to hell

Started digging
her resting place
with my bare hands
made a perfect burial
just for you
made a grave for two

Let me make it
easier for you
