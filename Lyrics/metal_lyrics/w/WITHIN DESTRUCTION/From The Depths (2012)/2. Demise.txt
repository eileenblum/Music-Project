How can you be
so plain and simple
canÂ´t you see
this is all an illusion
everything that revolves
around us

CanÂ´t you see
this foul
revolting
agony

Oh my god
what have you become

But does it even matter
disappear from the edge of the world
and see who gives a fuck
you're just another grain of sand
let me give you a hand

Why can't you see the filth
are you really so plain and simple
oh, the apathy

What do you do
when there is nothing left
to hold on to

When your heart is turned
in to stone and every breath
is a demise of your soul

Why is all of this unraveling inside of my head
when in the end all I want is to be dead

Oh my god
what have I become

No
