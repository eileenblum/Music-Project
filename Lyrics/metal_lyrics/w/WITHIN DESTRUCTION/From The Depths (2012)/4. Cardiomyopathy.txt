Why do you hesitate to spill your own blood,
when this will save you from yourself.
Would you rather become another slave,
Or would you rather fly away?
This pillars of hatred are now to strong,
the fusion with your heart has begun.

let me save you from yourself,
I'll make you wings from your flesh.
Abandon the essence of life,
consume my fire the failure of heart.

Let me save you from yourself.

Would you call this poison or would you call this cure
Snake pit grows inside your heart.
Abomination crawls through your veins.
Control is lost leaving you nameless.

let me save you from yourself,
I'll make you wings from your flesh.
Abandon the essence of life,
consume my fire the failure of heart.
