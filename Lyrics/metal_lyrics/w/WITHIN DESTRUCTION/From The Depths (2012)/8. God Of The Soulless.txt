Better days will come he says
just follow my divine ways
your life trapped enslaved by God
you're just a puppet made of flesh and blood

You 'll wash your hands in your own blood
you 'll be forgiven of every sin
there's just a price to all of this
before you are given my bliss

You feed them lies
rotten bread with flies
no one refuses to eat from your hand
suffocating them with poisonous sand

Drowning in your prayers
don't you think this is too much to bear
the light of God has made you blind
there s nothing left in your mind

For salvation comes from within
prepare to fall
prepare to sin

Prepare to fall

For salvation comes from within
free yourself from this shackles
drown in filth and you 'll be clean
the most beautiful thing in this world is to sin

Prepare to fall
