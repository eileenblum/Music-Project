The venom spreads through me
can't feel my heartbeat
my limbs are cold
I cannot breathe

Yet somehow I've embraced where others met the end
my soul is reignited my body resurrects

A lifeless shadow
now roams these lands alone
in search of purity
left in this dying world

From the brightest dawn the sun sets so dim
Its faceless figure obscures so grim

It cannot bare to witness this any longer
the last grain of compassion corrupts from within

There shall be no pity
noone shall be spared

Decay in my hand
receive me
behold
you are free

Now rise my subjects the time has come
receive my blessing we'll beat as one

The soil once so bright and green
now soaked in blood and sin

Bow down, to me
