This misery

Why must I carry,
this burden in my chest
It fills my mind,
with sentiments.
Memories that blur my mind,
I don't need this.
For the brightest soul,
gives no heat,
gives no beat.

Cut me now,
set me free,
undo this misery,
inside of me.

So come on,
Open me,
take out,
this blasphemy.

Flesh and blood shall be spilled,
veins will cry tears of joy,
light fades out of my eyes,
a gory shadow is left belove.

I can hear you call my name,
that cold breeze around my neck,
sending shivers down my spine,
you're embracing me with love.

Cut me now,
set me free,
undo this misery,
inside of me.

So come on,
Open me,
take out,
this blasphemy.

Now I see with my own eyes,
this world is to much to bare,
it has so little to obtain,
there 's not much more to gain.

I can hear you call my name,
that cold breeze around my neck,
sending shivers down my spine,
you're embracing me with love.
