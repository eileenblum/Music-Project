Now it's the time for me too see,
what's it like to be free.

I'll take one last deep breath,
and descend to my cold eternal sleep.

Pull me down, wake me up,
let me choke, for the crown,
see me rise, from the see,
thousand flies, worship me.

Is this how it ends
Is this what the presence of death feels like
What if there are flowers at the bottom of the sea
What if there is still a way for us to be
For us to be.

The more I drown the better I see.
No more bad dreams, disappointed mornings.
This is the fucking reality.

The water starts turning into ice.
Frostbites slowly take the pain away,
is this how the chosen ones decay

See me rise, from the see,
thousand flies, worship me.
