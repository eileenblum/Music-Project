No more painful words will you hear from my mouth.
My heart is silenced forbidden to shout.
Take my hand and let me lead you to your grave.
Forget your loved and remove every memories of them from your heart.

So many sacrifices have to be made.
To reach infinity in every aspect.

Fall in my hands, pray with me.
Lets dance this dance of death.
I'll free you from your misery.
This will be your final breath.
The sky below is now your home.
Forsaken that's what you'll be.
This is the price of heresy.

I am nothing but a mirror,
and you are my broken reflection,
and yet it all seems so beautiful,
united we could burn the earth.

Of all the devils,
you've chosen me.

Fall in my hands, pray with me.
Lets dance this dance of death.
I'll free you from your misery.
This will be your final breath.
The sky below is now your home.
Forsaken that's what you'll be.
This is the price of heresy.
