I need to hurt to feed my sanity
I need to bleed to feel alive
I need to hurt to feed my sanity
I need to bleed to feel alive

Self-hatred burned into my mind
My thoughts are fuelled with rage and delusions

I need to hurt to feed my sanity
I need to bleed

All this vision frying my perception of reality
Canât distinguish apparitions from the real world
Losing all sense of moral control
I slit my wrist to feel alive once more

The euphoria bursts through the veins
My heart is burning can you hear it beat
Streams of pleasant warmth run down my hands
I cleanse my face covered my own decaying blood

I need to hurt to feed my sanity
I need to bleed to feel alive
I need to hurt to feed my sanity
I need to bleed to feel alive

One last time I close my eyes as darkness fills the room
A single exhalation marks the passing of my soul
Finally I am free from the clutches of this conscience

No more suffering in this shell of devastation

I need to hurt to feed my sanity
I need to bleed to feel alive
I need to hurt to feed my sanity
I need to bleed to feel alive
