I will not survive this night

Scraped of my vesture confined in a dungeon of sludge
Reign of whips sink their fangs into a helpless frame
Body marked with filth-stained blood

A shrieking scream resonates within chambers of anguish
The mind has succumbed to this torture ritual
Wrists are blistered from the cold sharp chain
My torso lingering over the cradle of bloodshed
I will not survive this night

Slowly declining to my inevitable doom
Torn apart and gutted by impalement
My eyes turn white as I throw up my interiors

Head faints down the chest as I take my final breath

You will not survive this night
You will suffer this torture ritual

Screeches fade into the night
As the henchmen perform their act
No one can see my atrocious martyrdom for salvation
No one can see my atrocious martyrdom

This is my last night
My final hour drawing nearer

Head faints down the chest as I take my final breath
Head faints down the chest while I suffer this torture ritual
