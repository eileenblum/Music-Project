Behold the rise of a wretched dawn
Death, blight, eternal darkness, possession, corruption

Piles of decaying flesh
Rotten straight through the core
The masochistic desire to gnaw on your remains
The stench of spoiled meat
Excites the inclination to feast
Upon your own debris

Losing consciousness
But still you chew the withering corps
No prayer can save you now
There is no liberation

Through flame and void you shall be reborn

You shall be reborn
To cleanse this pestilence
The epidemic of putrid scum

This is the rise of the wretched dawn
The fall of darkness
And the end of life

Behold the wretched dawn the fall of darkness and the end of life

Through flame and void you shall be reborn

Cleanse the pestilence the epidemic of putrid scum
Behold the wretched dawn the fall of darkness and the end of life
No prayer can save you now there is no liberation

Of what relevance is our existence
If we are only given the will to die
We are given the will to die

Death awaits us all
