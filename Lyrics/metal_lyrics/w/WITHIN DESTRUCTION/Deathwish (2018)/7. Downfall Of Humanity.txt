Nation is gobbled straight through dermis
Eyes red wide open staring upon the apocalypse

I watch their fragile limbs snap like burnt branches
crushed by devouring fangs of ruin
You scum, you worthless piece of rotten meat
Stockpiles of decaying flesh
Slaughtered like the livestock you bleed
Cut down processed meat

No remorse for pitiful miserable irrelevant human existence
Annihilation of this disgraceful society
Witness the downfall of all humanity
Tearing the guts out of every living being
Behold your obsolescence
Welcome to the downfall of humanity
Downfall of humanity
The downfall of humanity

Conception of life forever forgotten
Void of despair consuming all matter
The formation of god â the god of death
An eternal engravement

Downfall of humanity
Annihilation of this disgraceful society
