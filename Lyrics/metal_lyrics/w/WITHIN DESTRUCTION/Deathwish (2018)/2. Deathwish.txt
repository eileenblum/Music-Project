We are all banished to eternal suffering and punishment

Deathwish on my mind
Bodies torn apart with no morality
Deathwish on my mind
We all shall die without a trace
Deathwish on my mind

Within interlacing spheres and substance
Prevailing over the continuum of darkness
A prevalent existence of an inconceivable potency

Swallowing the opposing matter
A debris nebula cast into a fading oblivion
The providence of a dominant subsistence
Extermination of the insignificant contemporary

We are all banished to eternal suffering and punishment

Deathwish on my mind
Bodies torn apart with no morality
Deathwish on my mind
We all shall die without a trace
Deathwish on my mind

I want to die

As the shadows of desolation embrace our realm
A horrifying halt takes over the remaining fragment
One last look into the pitiless dark formation
Ruptured and consumed by the gulf of devastation

Deathwish carved in our mind
Deathwish on my mind

[Duncan Bentley of Vulvodynia:]
Yo motherfuckers this is Vulvodynia/Within Destruction 2018
Bring it the fuck in or get knocked the fuck out motherfucker

Deathwish on my mind
I want to die
Deathwish on my mind
It's a curious thing the death of humanity

Eventually all of us will end up decaying underneath a pile of dirt

Never to wake up
Oh sweet bliss
