Walk through the shattered realm - face your creator

Face your creator

Observe the formation of time - Omnipotent existence

The embodiment of a lifeless soul
Conceived through chaos and misery
Existence shall be erased
Your existence will be denied

This will be the end of human population as we know it
And there will be no second chances for salvation nor redemption

Dead people walk among the living
They subdue the Earth
Behold the fourth kind

Bow down before your new born god
The architect of time
Omnipotent existence

Watch them perish one by one
The circulation of life and death

This will be the end of human population as we know it
And there will be no second chances for salvation nor redemption

When the balance of existence will collapse
The harvesting collectors will clutch the earth
Filled with worthless human rot

They will recreate their own design
They shall create the fourth kind
