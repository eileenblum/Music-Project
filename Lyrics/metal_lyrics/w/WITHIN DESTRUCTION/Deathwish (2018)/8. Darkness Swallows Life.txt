Cut your throat undo the pressure of enslavement
Let your blood flow down the skin
Surrender your body to a frantic ecstasy
The only salvation to your pain is self-destruction

The fiery hellhound preys your home for adolescent flesh
Piercing Incurable wounds through the chest of the elders
Ripping and tearing the throats of your daughters
Sliced on the threshold submerged within crimson liquids

Twilight waves shall rise from the oceans of ruin
Above the Azure clinging over the sprouting fields
Disengaging the light through the sphere of consciousness
Darkness swallows and withers all life

All the horror and misery sealed within our brain
One does not think twice when contemplating suicide
After all a single eager slit of the feeble fibre
Unleashes eternal salvation and redemption

Darkness swallows and withers all life
One does not think twice when contemplating suicide

Darkness swallows life

All the horror sealed within our brains
Sealed within our brains

Cut your throat undo the pressure of enslavement
Let your blood flow down the skin

Surrender your body to a frantic ecstasy
The only salvation to your pain is self-destruction
