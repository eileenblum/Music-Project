This lifeless wretched realm
Where no light shines
Shall be your grave of despair
The cradle of your sins
Unholy redemption

This all is worthless your benevolence will be forgotten

Striving for a life less cruel
Hopelessly awaiting salvation
Abandoned with a devastating defeat

Worthless blinded followers
Futile baffled worshiper of boundless suffering
Worthless, Godless, Desolated
Blinded, Groundless, Worshiper

Placed on the pedestal of martyrdom - boundless suffering

Your last vivid vision will be a blackened crater in the sky
Captivating and erasing all materialistic existence
Your perception of reality shall be forever lost
Sinking deeper in the pitiless abys of endless dusk and suffering

Sinking deeper into the abyss of endless suffering
