Bloodshed carnage raging down upon men
rotten bodies cram this forsaken land
and with this necromancy coming to life
all of humanity falls into apprehension

What eyes saw that night
constrained in shedding a tear
with such horror and despair
unholy power fed upon fear
what else is left, only blood you can bleed
when suffering is the air that you breathe

With the moon eclipse of the night
the altar claims its sacrifice
draining all hope injecting despair
ablating the body submitting affair

Imagine the pain of a thousand souls
ripped in to pieces to be sown as one
each limb preserves its finest formation
the maker unites this foul damnation
he cuts the stitches makes sure they are fine
removes the trocar this seizure is done
just one more deed he needs to complete

A flick of the switch engages its heart
now live

Rise, see what you've become
a devilâs incarnate, a monster, a fiend

Pain conquers this cursed temptation
Its disfigured body falls down on the floor
there is no blessing in this sensation
a blood-curdling cry is screamed in its grief

What eyes saw that night
constrained in shedding a tear
with such horror and despair
unholy power fed upon fear
