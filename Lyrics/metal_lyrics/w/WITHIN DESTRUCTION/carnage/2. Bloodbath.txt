Insane
transformation is at haste
unleashing inner beast of prey
taking inhuman form

accursed possessed and haunted
perpetually my everyday
every fucking day

darkening mind yearning to slay for its own pride
I cannot withhold when instinct becomes my only guide

and nothing can stop me now

my claws cut
your insipid skin
tearing thin tissue
ripping out joints

as the blood-scent
duresses my mind
all that I carve for
is to kill

my fangs will bite
your rotten flesh
snapping brash bones
deforming remains

this is my bloodbath
it cleanses my body and soul

but all I can taste
is this sickening filth, such a disgrace
annihilate this pity defect
we call the human race

this is my bloodbath
my slaughter
and my death
