My mental mortar is cracked. 
Degraded, weakened to black. 
I alone will undertake, 
because alone I destroyed, 
to reconstruct and to replace the void. 
Itâs structures have collapsed, 
without I will not get back. 
With change as my nails, 
and wisdom as my stone, 
I will rebuild a city 
that represents my integrity. 

I will restart and renew. 
I will patch the holes 
that Iâve torn in this existence. 
An architect in my own right, 
my metropolis will be one of harmony 
where negativity will neither be seen nor created. 

Comes from the heart that brings me life. 
Deep in the thoughts that left me behind. 

Work will not cease, this will be complete. 
For until perfection I cannot return. 
To manufacture my serenity 
is through labor, strife, and sweat. 
To fabricate tranquility 
I am closer to subduing debt. 
An architect in my own right, 
my metropolis will be one of harmony. 

Comes from the heart that brings me life. 
Deep in the thoughts that left me behind. 

The steel of my conscience 
will become towers and monuments. 

Iâve spackled the walls 
to make them seamless 
for the righteous, for the shameless. 

Comes from the heart that brings me life. 
Deep in the thoughts that left me behind. 

I will not rest till my life is whole.
