Sever the bond, so I am one! 
My trust has fallen short 
of what youâve made. 
Invaded my mind to rot this world thatâs mine. 
Betrayal has consumed your every word, 
as my malice rains, your sky is falling down. 
Deception has absorbed everything, 
as my malice rains. 
I prey on your soul. 
Hate seeps through my pores. 
I know what is mine. 
I trust you no more! 
Consumed by my malice, 
your life is the only one to save. 
So dig your fucking grave. 
Breath malevolence and spite. 
Negate good will. 

Iâm trying to cut the noose, 
but itâs always tied to you. 
Youâll drop while the rope is loose, 
with just your neck to break the fall. 
Betrayal has consumed your every word. 
As my malice rains, your sky is falling down. 
My hatred rips through every nerve. 
Twist the knife and drain your blood upon the ground. 
Youâve reached the point of no return. 
I am your executioner. 
Iâm trying to cut this noose, 
but itâs always tied to you. 
Youâll drop while the rope is loose, 
with just your neck to break the fall. 

The link has shattered.
