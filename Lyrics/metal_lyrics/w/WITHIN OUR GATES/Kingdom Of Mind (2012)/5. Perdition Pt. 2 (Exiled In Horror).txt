Terror rushes through my veins. 
Fear is the spawn of my hatred. 
Horror is a vicious laceration, 
thatâs bleeding the violence of my own creation. 
We have come for your world, 
built on lust, seduction, bringing death and destruction to all. 
Itâs an insidious rite of passage to devour 
the survivors and stack the dead in the masses. 

Uncompromising thoughts of ill restraint 
that bring me hatred. 
Unrestricted thoughts of death 
that carry me to the gates of hell. 
My spite will cast you to the lightless corners, 
and leave you with suffering. 

Terror rushes through my veins, 
fear is the spawn of my hatred. 
Horror is a vicious laceration, 
thatâs bleeding the violence of my own creation. 
We have come for your world, 
built on lust, seduction, bringing death and destruction to all. 
Itâs an insidious rite of passage to devour 
the survivors and stack the dead. 

You fight as if I am tangible, 
mocking you to frustration 
that wears you down. 
A childâs play, a infants crawl. 
This world is mine to burn. 
This man is mine to burn. 
Crushed and beaten, exiled forever. 
You will be mine. 
Your fear brings me life. 

Horror is a vicious laceration, 
that is bleeding the violence of my own creation. 
We have come for your world, 
built on lust, seduction, bringing death and destruction to all. 
Itâs an insidious right of passage to devour 
the survivors and stack the dead of the masses
