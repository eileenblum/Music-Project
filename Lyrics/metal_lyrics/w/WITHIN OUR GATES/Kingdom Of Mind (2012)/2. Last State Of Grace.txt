Bring me all that I need to truly be. 
At peace, I am one man, 
one mind to believe that 
I am the reason I live and 
I am the preservation of self. 

Feeding the flames 
of my deepest desires. 
Awake in a dream, 
a blissful eternity. 

The sun has set upon my 
every word and action, 
yet content, I live, 
I love the end will state that 
I am, the reason I live and 
I am the preservation of self. 

Feeding the flames 
of my deepest desires. 
Awake in a dream, 
a blissful eternity. 

This stress is not an option, 
selfishness has taken over. 
He embraces the intoxication. 

The allure has left him blind 
to the quest one must endure. 
Unknown he is bound 
to the demon that will procure. 
Hatred toward all those 
whom which we want to love.
