A quarrel ensues, 
a man against his mind. 
You canât look away from your destiny. 
You will fulfill. You will conquer, 
even if you are a selfish piece of shit. 
Please try, to rise, to your expectations. 
Iâll decide on my, final resolution. 
Before Iâm dead in the Earth. 

Iâve lost all faith in happiness, 
You are the reason spite exist. 
Falling down from the sky, 
I hold this pride no more. 
Fighting to turn this tide thatâs 
crashing upon the shore. 

Away from your self-righteousness, 
learning from my nothingness. 
Tearing me from propriety, 
leave me to my life I lead. 
Actions do have consequence, 
burning me with all your sins. 
Refusal lies in ignorance, 
expectations of nothing less. 
Youâve lost all faith in happiness. 
You are the reason spite exists. 

Falling down from the sky, 
I hold this pride no more 
Fighting to turn this tide thatâs 
crashing upon the shore. 

A silhouette set ablaze. 
Arose from the ashes, 
I looked to him and screamed. 

Iâve seen your worth, 
but now youâre a 
worthless piece of shit. 
My mind is the demon. 
I am the reason for 
the prevision of this land. 

Falling down from the sky, 
I hold this pride no more. 
Fighting to turn this tide 
thatâs crashing upon the shore.
