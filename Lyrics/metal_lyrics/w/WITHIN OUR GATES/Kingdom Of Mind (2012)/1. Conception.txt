An Impact, a force so fierce 
it shakes the earth. 
Beginning tremors; 
this is conception. 
The shock leaves him faint, 
Surrounded by ruin, 
fire, and destruction. 

This man lies naked and alone 
in a crater that he 
seems to have created. 
He comes to, 
looks at his new surroundings 
as if he was just conceived. 

âHere I am, standing alone 
at the threshold of the world. 
These colors so vivid, 
no longer the cynic, 
Iâm the prophecy foretold.â 

This pit, for ever so brief, is called home. 
But is only within armâs length, 
for beyond what he can see is unknown. 

A dark cloud with a silver lining 
gazed into his heart and spoke, 
He climbs to the ledge 
of his abyss with anticipation. 
Step by step scaling the wall, 
he rises to see the plain of his existence. 
A dark cloud with a silver lining 
gazed into his heart and spoke 

I see its symmetry that is unparalleled. 
Like a childâs first sight of heaven, 
Like a manâs first sight of hell. 

âHere I am, standing alone 
at the threshold of the world. 
These colors so vivid, 
no longer the cynic, 
Iâm the prophecy foretold.â 

A prophecy thatâs 
instantly incomprehensible, 
A fight to see, 
that seems to be impossible. 

âHere I am, standing alone 
at the threshold of the world. 
These colors so vivid, 
no longer for the cynic, 
Iâm the prophecy foretold.â
