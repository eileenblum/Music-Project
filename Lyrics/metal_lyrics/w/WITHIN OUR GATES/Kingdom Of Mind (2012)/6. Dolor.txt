Defeated and left in desolation, 
I am overwhelmed. 
Traveling through this darkness, 
feeling memories that were once had. 
By me or by another? 

Alone in this place, 
Iâve become one with these thoughts. 
Visions of evil, visions of hatred, 
visions of corruption 
which has not been felt in this world. 
Walking in a possession. 
Existence is my question. 
What is this life? 
Where is this life? 
Overcoming, this is who I am. 
I turned from a saint into a sinner. 
Overcoming, this who Iâve become. 
I am the transgression of a prodigy. 

The ashes of my thoughts surrounding me. 
I have brought myself into the fire. 
The wake astounds me, I stagger onto the ground. 

Bombarding my mind, these recollections 
compiling to orchestrate my variance. 
My past is overpowering my soul, 
deepening the depression of my life as a whole. 
Trying to assemble the puzzle of his past. 
Recollect the life once had. 

The ashes of my thoughts surrounding me. 
I have brought myself into the fire. 
The wake astounds me, I stagger onto the ground. 

Iâm a fucking disgrace. 
On the brink of surrender, 
he lays down to sulk.
