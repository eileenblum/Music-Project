Get up! 
This man should be left to rot. 
Taking comfort in self pity. 
But I know this is not it. 
My past will be slain, 
I will capture the life that is intended to be. 

He stands in determination, 
collects all his strength for the encounter. 

I see my life is slipping away, 
I donât know where to turn. 
And all my thoughts are running astray. 
Iâm seeking sanity. 
Cause deep in thought my mind will fall. 
For all thatâs left in me, 
thereâs nothing left at all. 

Thereâs nothing left but your fall. 
Iâll embrace the violence for retaliation. 
My world will be at peace 
when I rid of your company. 

Face to face, you wonât have a chance to speak. 
Controlled me for far too long, 
fear has since left. 
Reformed by building your cell. 
Fuck you and enjoy hell.

Tear out my heart 
to show you my scars. 
Iâll rip out your heart 
to vanquish your farce. 
Iâve overcome destruction 
to master creation. 
Iâd die a thousand times 
to see what is true. 

And after all these things Iâve been through, 
it turned out better than I 
hoped for, prayed for, lived for.
