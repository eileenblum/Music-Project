The world is created from my mind 
and there is only pain outside. 
I will choose this as my home, 
even if I am left alone. 

Like a king to his throne, 
I have made this my own. 
Like skin to the bone, 
separation will be unknown. 
Like a master to the slave, 
shackled and bound on the plain. 
Flaws of one are flaws of all. 
One sin and the kingdom will fall. 

Specifications met in tact, 
fantasies transformed to fact, 
the ideal place for me. 
Is my time running short? 
For outward is nothing to live for. 

Like a king to his throne, 
I have made this my own. 
Like skin to the bone, 
separation will be unknown. 
Like a master to the slave, 
Shackled and bound on the plain. 
Flaws of one are flaws of all, 
one sin and the kingdom will fall. 

Infatuated with what was earned. 
Captivated by the aurora of how I turned 
this depredation into solace. 
Ascendancy to my highest plateau. 

Now the years come and go, 
and my reign holds true. 
Months pass like days. 
Thy kingdom come. 

The beauty has dissipated, 
heft returned to weightless mass. 
Itâs lush terrain now barren soil, 
I want to leave at last. 
All the flowers color seemed to fade. 
The greens of the grass 
and the blue of the sky 
lost their luster and elegance. 

Iâve pressed decades under thumb, 
thought my time had just begun. 
I may have made decisions wrong. 

Like a king to his throne, 
I have made this my own. 
Like skin to the bone, 
separation will be unknown. 
Like a master to the slave, 
shackled and bound on the plain. 
Flaws of one are flaws of all, 
one sin and the kingdom will fall.
