Feels like Iâm ready to implode 
from all the fears and lies Iâve known. 
See my conscience shatter like glass, 
bringing you to your collapse. 
And Iâm getting stronger every step I take. 
Skipping through every scene, 
couldnât tell if you were friend or fiend. 

Thereâs wellness for tomorrow 
from the fight against my sorrow. 

To whom this is addressed, 
to whom this may concern: 
Your reign of discontent will finally burn. 
To admit is to confess, 
to forgive is not to forget. 
Stained in my memory, 
wisdom gained in misery. 

Let the rain wash down 
and cleanse my soul, 
Iâve puzzled the pieces 
to make me whole. 
My mind is a dreamscape 
that one day now will seal my fate. 

Torn between my past and present, 
looking for my rightful return. 

Iâm getting stronger along the way. 
I wonât be held down, 
trapped in this world so divine. 
Iâll let it burn. 
I wonât be held down. 

Let the rain wash down 
and cleanse my soul. 
Iâve puzzled the pieces 
to make me whole. 
My mind is a dreamscape 
that one day now will seal my fate. 
My mind be right, 
my soul have sight 
to finally see with clarity. 

Iâve overcome my sorrow. 
Lost all control. 
Counting down the day 
till life starts over again. 
Capture my soul. 
Counting down the day 
till life starts over again.
