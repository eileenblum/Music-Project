[Matthew 27:33-56, Mark:15:22-39, Luke 23:32-49, John 19:16-3]
Nails hammered through His hands and feet, blood spraying from His veins and His body's weak.
Lifted up, a mangled spectacle for all the world to see, beaten and ridiculed lying in agony,
His blood has set us free.
Each breath is harder than the last. Our sin clinging to His body, now it is finished.
He felt forsaken, He felt all alone.
The earth begins to shake, graves are opened their bodies are awake.
Our sin clinging to His body, now it is finished. He felt forsaken, He felt all alone.
