[Acts 1:9-11, Revelation 1:3, Acts 17:31, Matthew 24:4-14, Revelation 18:8]
As He left is how He shall return, separating the sky. It's up to you.
What choice will you decide? Will you live or will you die?
Many things are written, written in His word, prophecies being fulfilled.
Suffering and pain for the wicked ones, but peace for those who have been sealed.
Time is short now count the cost. He will come back to judge the lost.
Earthquakes and famines, a world that's filled with pain.
Hatred and war, the suffering begins. Earthquakes and famines, a world that's filled with pain.
Vengeance and murder, the earth is at its end.
As He left is how He shall return separating the sky.
It's up to you what choice will you decide? Will you live or will you die?
