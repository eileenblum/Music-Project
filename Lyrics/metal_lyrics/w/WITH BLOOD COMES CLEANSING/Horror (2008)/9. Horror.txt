It's written in the pages. You have been warned for years.
Armageddon's coming, the sum of all your fears. You chose whom you would serve.
You chose your side, now you get what you deserve.
You chose your side, now pay the price.
The battle lines have been drawn, knee deep in blood we'll sing our victory song.
War like this world has never seen; the time for mercy has passed.
Evil shall triumph no more. This world wins no more. It's written in the pages.
You have been warned for years. Armageddon's coming, the sum of all your fears.
