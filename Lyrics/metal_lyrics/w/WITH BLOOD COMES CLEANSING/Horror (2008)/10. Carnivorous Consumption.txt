[Ezekiel 49:17-20, Revelation 19:11-21]
Carcasses will be everywhere, left to decay, enough flesh left behind, for the birds to feed.
The armies of the beast shall wallow in defeat, their mangled bodies rotting, left for the birds to eat.
Carcasses will be everywhere left to decay.
The armies of the beast shall wallow in defeat.
With the sword of His mouth He will slaughter the wicked.
He'll be riding on a white horse, His garments dipped in blood, Heaven's army following, wrath poured out like a flood.
King of Kings and Lord of Lords, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
Carcasses will be everywhere, left to decay, enough flesh behind for the birds to feed.
The armies of the beast shall wallow in defeat, their mangled bodies rotting, left for the birds to eat.
With the sword of His mouth He will slaughter the wicked.
