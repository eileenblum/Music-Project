[Revelation 20:1-10]
One thousand years you will be bound up. When set free you will deceive.
God's judgment on you will come quickly; the flames will gladly then receive.
Then your pain shall bring us comfort.
We shall rejoice as you suffer in the flames.
Into the lake with the beast and false prophet, there you'll receive your eternal damnation.
We shall rejoice as you suffer in the flames.
One thousand years you will be bound up. When set free you will deceive.
God's judgment on you will come quickly; the flames will gladly then receive.
