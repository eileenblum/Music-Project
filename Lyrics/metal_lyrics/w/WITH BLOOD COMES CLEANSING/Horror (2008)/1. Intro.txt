[Romans 3:10-18, Revelation 14:7]
There is no one righteous, not even one; no one seeks God.
Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.
Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark their ways, and the way of peace they do not know.
There is no fear of the Lord before their eyes.
Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come.
