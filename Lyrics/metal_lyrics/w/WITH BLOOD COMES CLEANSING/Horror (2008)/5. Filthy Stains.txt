[Matthew 27:57-66, Matthew 28:1-20, Mark 15:42-47, Mark 16:1-20, Luke 23:50-56, Luke 24, John 19:38-42, John 20-21, Ephesians 4:8-10, Colossians 2:14-15, Revelation 1:18]
The sin of the world was placed upon Him, leaving our filthy stains.
His holy body was placed in the earth for three days and three nights.
He descended low into the earth, the place where spirits where held.
He took the keys of hell and death, plans of the enemy failed.
Into hell and back again, capturing captivity. Into hell and back again, openly.
The battle has been won. The tomb is empty; He's alive. He ascended on high.
Arisen from the grave now we all can be saved the price for sin is now paid.
