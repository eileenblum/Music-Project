[Revelation 21 and 22]
Destroyed by fire, many things will pass away.
A new Heaven and new earth will stand for eternity.
Destroyed by fire, many things will pass away.
No more sorrow, nothing left to fear.
God our father shall wipe away all our tears.
No more darkness, no more night, His holy presence shall be the light.
Behold all things are new.
Only those whose name are written in the Lamb's Book of Life, shall live forever in this city, where there no longer will be strife.
No more sorrow, nothing left to fear, God our father, shall wipe away all our tears.
No more darkness, no more night, His holy presence shall be the light.
Behold all things are made new. All things are new.
