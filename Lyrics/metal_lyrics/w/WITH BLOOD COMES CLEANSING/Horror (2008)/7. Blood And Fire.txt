[Revelation 6:12-17, Revelation 8:8-11]
The sun will blacken and the moon become as blood. The stars will fall from space.
People will flee to the mountains, to hide their bodies from His face.
The sun will blacken and the moon become as blood. The stars will fall from space.
The day of His wrath will come, on wicked men.
The day of His wrath will come, who shall stand? Blood and fire shall burn the earth.
Woe to those who inhabit the earth, in His wrath they won't stand.
The day of His wrath will come, on wicked men. The day of His wrath will come, who shall stand.
Soon the mountain will be burning with fire. Soon the water will turn bitter.
The day of His wrath will come, on wicked men.
The day of His wrath will come, who shall stand? Blood and fire shall burn the earth.
