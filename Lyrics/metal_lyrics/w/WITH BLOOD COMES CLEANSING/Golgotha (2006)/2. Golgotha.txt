This is the place of the skull where terror reigned,
A crucifixion of agony and pain,
A crown of thorns pierced his skin,
Bound by the wages of sin,
Mercy so undeserved,
We cursed our god. While he suffered
The skies grow dark and the earth shakes,
And for a second your heart breaks,
Eloi Eloi Lama Sabacthani,
Our souls lie in Golgotha,
Prophecy fulfilled in Golgotha
