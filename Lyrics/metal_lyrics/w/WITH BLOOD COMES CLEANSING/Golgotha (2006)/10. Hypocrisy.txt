You are faithless, You'll reason with yourself. You'll feed off the ashes of your hell. Your lifeless decisions will all fail. To taste of the freedom that we feel. Desperate lies at the tip of your tongue. See through the eyes of a foolish son.
You'll mock our God. Hypocrisy.
Your fake peace cant come to the wicked.
Judas you're weaker than the enemy.
