When the darkness doesn't cease.
I long to feel your peace.
Your arrows falling down to pierce the demons brow.
Your voice echoing loud amongst the thunderous clouds.
God, I need your help now.
So much at one time.
How can this be?
My mind
My love
And My friend.
When the darkness doesn't cease.
I long to feel your peace.
Your arrows falling down to pierce the demons brow.
Your voice echoing loud amongst the thunderous clouds.
God, I need your help now.
Unwanted things inside my mind.
Does absence make the heart grow fonder?
I miss her sweet face, her sweet face, in eternity's brace.
When the darkness doesn't cease.
I long to feel your peace.
Your arrows falling down to pierce the demons brow.
Your voice echoing loud amongst the thunderous clouds.
God, I need your help now.
