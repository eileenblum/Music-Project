I seek the face of Jesus Christ.
In a world where death's existence is what surrounds
And I watch as they strip us of our beliefs and we let ourselves be over taken by our enemies.
At the presence of God every knee will bow every tongue will confess he is lord.
Persecution
Blamed for my faith.
The wrath of evil poured out in these last days.
This war will not end.
Hold fast to your faith.
