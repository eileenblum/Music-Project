I see His angels rise before me, and His glory shown about,
I stand firm in my faith when all else is gone,
cause in my weakness I will be made strong.
Set yourselves apart; in my name be lifted up.
Set yourselves apart; in my name be lifted up.
Don't be faithless. This is your destiny.
Defeat your weakness in your victory. [x2]
I will give my all when there's nothing left. [x4]
I see His angels rise before me, and His glory shown about,
I stand firm in my faith when all else is gone.
God your all I have.
Take my everything.
I owe it all to you.
[x5]
