Destroy, the thoughts that plague my mind
The battle within myself hidden inside.
My spirit's willing but my flesh is weak.
My spirit's willing but I am weak
My spirit's is willing but my flesh is just so weak.
My flesh is so weak.
Everyday goes longer.
Everyday your heart grows weaker,
And before you know it you're back to your addictions.
Will we ever find peace can we ever find joy.
Getting rid of our strongholds is the only way,
It is the only way we will ever destroy.
My spirit's willing but my flesh is weak.
My spirit's willing but I am weak
My spirit's is willing but my flesh is just so weak.
My flesh is so weak.
Destroy.
(Destroy)
Destroy.
(Destroy)
Destroy.
(Destroy)
Destroy.
