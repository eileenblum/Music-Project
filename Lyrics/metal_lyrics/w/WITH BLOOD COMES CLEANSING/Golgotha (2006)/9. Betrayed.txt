Blood thirsty, blasphemous, deceiver.
Blinded by the sin.
The eyes of betrayal, the heart of a fool,
useless abominations, calloused confused.
You said you would change, change for yourself,
you're hidden in a world of disaster, leading a life of regret.
The eyes of betrayal, the heart of a fool,
useless abominations, calloused confused.
I can see through you, I know who you are.
Blood thirsty, blasphemous, deceiver.
