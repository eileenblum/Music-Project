A spirit rises with a legion at its side.
To take the souls of human life.
Helpless and weak it takes away the visions we seek.
Our minds play tricks as we watch it decease as if we are helpless.
Fight back; this is your time to attack.
Fight back; this is your time to attack.
Helpless and weak it takes away the visions we seek.
Our minds play tricks as we watch it decease
As if we are helpless.
As if we are helpless.
Release.
Release the powers within us cease.
Take the enemies captive and settle the score.
Battles are over.
We're still at war.
Bring out your dead.
Bring out your dead.
Bring out your dead.
Bring out your dead.
Bring out your dead.
