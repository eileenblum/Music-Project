Unleash your demons, let us begin
The horrid dance of the buried.
Come join us, carve your epitaph with nails.
Then awake to fear of not awaking again.

Face yourself. Face your nightmares
And only the walls echo your empty screams.
Hell is behind, below, ahead and above you.
No use to reach for light. You'll find only your shadow.

Drown into the open wounds of infinity,
Lungs filled with fire, mouth frozen to scream.
Nameless creatures feeding on your fear
And you just can't understand what you're lost inside.

You will never find the endings,
The mirroring walls are closing in.
