Kill  for  pleasure
With  lack  of  morality
Inability  to  control  impulses
After  seeing  all  immoralities

A  product  of  society
An  attempt  of  punishment
No  behavior  has  changed
No  learning  from  experience

Authorities  can  not  control  this  violence
This  impunity  won't  be  taken

Antisocial  personality  disorder
Shaped  by  reality
Perceive  the  world  differently
Towards  bloodshed

A  product  of  society
An  attempt  of  punishment
No  feeling  of  remorse
No  sense  of  responsibility

There  is  no  turning  back
No  place  for  forgiveness
Through  all  this  violence
To  show  no  mercy

All  this  impunity
All  this  hipocrisy
All  this  disorder
All  this  paranoia
Kill  it  yourself

Kill  it  yourself
Kill  it
