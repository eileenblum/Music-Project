The day is about to rise
And death has not ceased yet
On the battlefield we canât choose not to fight
All the chances you have are only die or die
Death dwells around me
The last march is about to begin

Here I come to their pain

Here I call death AKÂ­47
And they call us the servants of hell
We destroy their future
We destroy their past
They canât break the resistance
We are their last nightmare

In the last march
You will die, you will kill
No second chances
This field shall be your grave
In the last fight
You will rise, you will fall
No second best
You have to be more than all

Kill, kill, kill them now
Blood, gore, this is the war
This day we fight
We wonât forget it anymore
Faces, faces, they have no faces
Never, never, the second best
You have their lives
Donât let them get yours

When you feel the terror closer
Your hate runs in your veins
Thereâs no sign of hope
Thereâs no sign of fear

In the last march
You will die, you will kill

No second chances
This field shall be your grave
In the last fight
You will rise, you will fall
No second best
You have to be more than...
More than us all

This is the end.
