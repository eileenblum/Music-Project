Destroying minds
Annihilating all your freedom
Making you live blind
Without any wisdom

You'll be in my hands
Through your own force
You'll destroy your land
Forever under my command

I will win this fight
Using your own soldiers

You will defeat
All their resistance

You'll be forced to ruin
their own empire

And I'll be in my throne
Waiting to conquer your land

Make them believe
In all these words
So you will reave
And kill your lords

You will use violence
I will use your minds
You'll kill them
They'll never kill you

I'm taking control
Of all your power

You destroy their stand
As they watch helpless
You are killing
All their supremacy

I'm leading you
Choking you in your own strings

Your land is mine
Your throne is mine
All that ever was
All that will ever be

"Suddenly they stormed the gates
Cursed, fearless, our own kind
A strange glow in their eyes
The fall of our kingdom
We witnessed a bloody massacre.
And dropped. One by one. "

"A dark figure approaches.
Bringing all his shadow lords.
Surrounded by fear, I stare at the tyrant
Death is upon me.
My crown is lost"

I have the control
Of their now powerless empire

You took everything
but their last breath

Forever defeated
their existence has vanished

I'm your master
You'll never forget all my lies

Your land is mine
Your throne is mine
All that ever was
All that will ever be

Forever
On my command
