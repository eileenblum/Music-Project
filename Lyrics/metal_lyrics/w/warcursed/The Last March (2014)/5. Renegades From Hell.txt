You  feel  that  hate
Itâs  inside  their  minds
You  know  thatâs  your  fate

We  canât  have  mercy  for  them
You,  you'll  cry  your  blood
We  are  the  cause  of  this  rage
We,  we  are  renegades  from  hell

You  see  that  rage
All  that  is  for  you
Itâs  coming  to  destroy  your  race

We  bring  this  new  age
You,  you're  just  ashes  on  the  dust
We  are  not  a  new  god
We,  we  are...

Our  resistance  is  taking  power
The  empire  will  be  ruined
No  more  a  slave
You  are  the  leader

Bring  them
And  all  your  weapons
You  will  need
More  than  this  cross

We're  Renegades  from  hell

Our  resistance  is  taking  power
The  empire  will  be  ruined
No  more  a  slave
You  are  the  leader

The  power  is  yours
Your  old  master  is  your  thrall

No  more  a  slave
You  are  the  Renegades  from  Hell
The  Renegades  from  Hell
