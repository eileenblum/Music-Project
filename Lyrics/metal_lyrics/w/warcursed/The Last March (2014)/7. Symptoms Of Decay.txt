Living in lie without leader
Living in chaos with no future

The nation is totally corrupted
Following their own rules

Degeneration of all minds
Destroying all your lives

They use their force
To take things you hold dear
No one sees, no one lives in decay

All past is lost
No future near
These are all symptoms of decay

Living in a constant struggle
The system is broken and diseased

What did you expect?
There is no chance for all

Every minority is dying
All the masters are lying

Chaos and rage
Are weapons of domination

Fear and disease
The people are suffering

Pain, misery
Is all that is left for you

Fall in disgrace
Until you fade
