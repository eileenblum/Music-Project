You control their minds
For your weak cause
You try to control me but
I am stronger
I donât believe
In your freak gods
And I donât fear to be
Pursued by your demons

We are the same blood
Destroying our world
Just for our faith
To live in our sweet chaos

We all live in this rage
Through centuries and centuries
Defeated by the same weakness
In constant resistance
Betrayed by our own allies
This disease will never die
Living in a Temple of Destruction

All people's lives
Are so innocent
You manipulate their path
Just through fear
Creating bizarre creatures
For their belief
Changing their faith
Just to live in this curse

While you try to destroy me
Iâll keep on changing
All this whole world
With my grievous faith

I'll expose your deceit
Until no one will ever
Believe your lies and
Turn their backs on you

These illusions are the same
Destroying their minds
Just for our faith
To live in our sweet chaos
