[Music and lyrics are by Richard Senko]

I am so tired, walking down the street
I need a bar to take shots and beer.
I want to get drunk and find myself a girl
Just to relax and have some fun

I want beer, I want girls
Now I have tons of beer and a woman to drink a lot and fuck in my car

Splatter on the road

She wants me, I want her
Let's find some place where I can go deep between your fucking legs

Sun in the morning wakes me up but I can't move
Am I in handcuffs? Where is she now?
I look around and don't see my car
I was stolen by that fucking bitch

I will find her, I will hunt her
Cut her in pieces and throw on the street where no one can find

Splatter on the road
This is my car,
Now it's my revenge
Now you will suffer so deeply until I hear your soul bleeding

You thought you pulled a fast one on me
What a pity!
I'm a natural killer
I am sick of listening to all these threats
I'm a murderer, now I will kill you

Now you are dead
You are dismembered and I am insane talking to your head

Splatter on the road

Look at you... oh, you can't!
You are in pieces, spread on the streets
Your heart, still in my hand
I throw it away, I know I'm insane, but no fucking one can drive my car.
