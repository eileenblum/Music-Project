[Music: Richard Senko/Marsell Senko, lyrics: Richard Senko]

I retain their liberty trapped inside rigid bodies.
They must be controlled, ordered, they need a guide
All ideas will break like their inflexible corpses.
With my hands and my will, I suffocate all voices.

All free ideas should be killed by me.
There is no reason to let them think
They have to believe that freedom is a sin
They must know all is ruled by me

You follow me, you obey me, I'm the mighty one
Your life is mine, your mind is mine, you live in rigor mortis

I create icons, just so they follow
If they don't, they shall perish in eternal sorrow
I have their lives, souls, minds and all freedom
I will not leave alive anything that breathes

They just feel fear, because of me
They'll never know who took their lives

We have your soul, you are a miserable mistake
You kneel now, behold I am the Snake
We have your soul, you are a corpse without a face
You kneel now, behold your fall from grace

The existence is not for you
You are living in my world
All this disgrace it's all for you
You are living in my chaos
