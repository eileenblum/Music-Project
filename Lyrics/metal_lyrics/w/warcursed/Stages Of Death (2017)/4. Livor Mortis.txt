[Music, lyrics: Richard Senko]

See all vicinity, there is just us
Believed we had all the knowledge
We fell in a storm where we lost our minds
We lost, we failed, now we live in misery

Why don't we rise and fight against those who trapped us here?
Why are we afraid, if they only have a simple cross?

Behold this chaos, enough of these strings
Look into my eyes, I'll show what is real
We are stronger, you will see
Let's put them to living misery

We lost the signal of our lives
We fell in the same web of lies
We'll take our minds, feel our roar
We'll fight for it, we'll leave this livor

Feel their fear arising, just from your questions
They don't have answers
Make them feel your mind taking control of all your life
They lost a slave now

They'll try to take control of all your freedom
We have to fight back, not lose our stand
Knowledge is all they don't want to see
Letâs fight with honor for our fierce victory
