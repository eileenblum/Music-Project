[Music: Richard Senko, lyrics: Luciano Miranda/Richard Senko]

In the silence of society, struggling for my existence.
They are faceless without will
I try to scream, but they silence my voice.
Ravenous beast craves my mind

Many souls crying, my body is now dying.

My life falls from my hands.
My heart crosses the border of the end.
Death embraces me, my last sin
Gaze petrified, pale skin.

Pallor mortis.

Thousands of bodies, not one soul
Tearing all lives, burying all in holes
Controlling all minds, taming the beast
Obliterating until all are deceased
My hands are tied, my eyes are covered.
The sheet that covers me into insignificance
Falling in the arms of intolerance.
Our hollow world

Death embraces me.
My curse.
Gaze petrified.
Pale skin.
