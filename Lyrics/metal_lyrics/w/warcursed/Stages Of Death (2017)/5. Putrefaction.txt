[Music: Richard Senko, lyrics: Luciano Miranda/Richard Senko]

It was my body.
It belonged to me.
Cells and dead fibers.
Just something rotten that I can see.

False words of hope.
False words of peace.
Attacking my dead neurons.
A great hatred to release.

Transmutation of brain
Tearing the cohesion of my cells in pain.
Worms consuming my soul again.

My eyes out of eyelids.
Each sacred page immolates.
Knowledge you want to forbid.
What remains falls in putrefaction.

Look at me, tell me what do you see.
Just a void, only thing that can be.
Lust for power and leave it all to die
Everything you have smells like lies.

All this anger scorching my skin.
Tearing the tissues, infected like deadly sin.
Laying my body on a bitter bed
Defy

Draining, rotting all from my flesh.
Taking all my life, rip, cut and slash.
You just want to exploit me.
Your lies.

It is my body.
It belongs to me.
Cells and fibers.
Rotten, I see.

True words of rage.
True words of hate.
Attacking until you ceased.
A great hatred is released.
