[Music: Richard Senko / Marsell Senko, lyrics: Richard Senko / Luciano Miranda]

You're just the shadow of an ancient fear.
See what's left of it now.
Seeing his true pale form.
Breaking the chains with his fall.

Impositions destroyed, releasing the clones
See all his fear, it's reflected in his bones.

Open your mind, open your eyes.
Question the old rules of old bones.
Reject the discipline of buried gods.
They're nothing, just dead stones.

See what remains of your chest.
Your rotten heart still beating.
Seeing his cold face, psychological warfare
We can fight, we can defy.

Break all bones, face The Death.
We'll resist, we'll fight

Come all, break bones, make your weapons.
Release from the god of blue light.
Refuse to be just a number in the crowd.
Believe in you, know yourself, stand and fight, follow your heart.

We will burn this meaningless life.
Old patterns that limit our individuality.
Tearing old orders that stole our souls.
Sweeping the dust of what's left of the old society.

"Freedom is never given by the oppressor it has to be won by the oppressed."

Show your face
Know your power
See your massification
End your skeletonization.
