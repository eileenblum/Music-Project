[Music: Richard Senko/Marsell Senko, lyrics: Luciano Miranda / Richard Senko]

Deep inside, I can feel.
Eating and crawling through my veins.
Ripping my skin, cold as steel.
Devouring from feet to brain.

Thoughts rotting in my head.
Worms absorbing individuality.
Feeding on the tissues of my lungs.
Dragging me to the grave of society.

Liquefying all feelings, enslaving to submission
Treading the steps, I do not want, my decomposition.

You want me as a dead slave.
Without soul, without will.
No voice to scream.
Just another to kill.

My face wears a mask of happiness.
Disease attacking all dead cells.
Desires are useless.
Corpse cells, useless rebels

Lies, fear, sorrow, terror, pain.
