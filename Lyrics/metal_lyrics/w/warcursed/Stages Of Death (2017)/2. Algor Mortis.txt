[Music: Richard Senko/Marsell Senko, lyrics: Richard Senko]

Your world there are no more walls
Fell 'cause you believed the laws
You showed the same apathy
Coldness is all in the end

See what you left behind
It's not just your mind
Fading all your flame
Leaving them to use all your life

Minds are lost
Algor mortis
Draining all humankind
Leaving you in darkness, blind
Freezing all within your mind
Algor mortis

Raised inside a utopia
Created to be a slave
You thought you controlled your life
But they've guided you to die

Fall for the same old lie
Without any light
Trapped in the same old way
Persuaded to live with a rotten mind

Coldness
Draining all your strength
Lethargy
Useless being

You fought for false theories
Believing in every rule
You lost all your future
You lost all your life

Reflect on your forlorn life
These fights for fool reasons
Idolizing puny gods
These gods just want your mind

You are imprisoned with blindfolds
For them to consume all your mind
You are in the last march of your life
They wrote your last line

No more reason to fight
We are side by side
No ideologies
We live surrounded by lies
