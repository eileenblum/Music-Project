[Music: Richard Senko, lyrics: Glauber Ancelmo]

The iron bird flies above heaven
Dropping fire from its wings
A weapon of mass destruction
Bringing Hell to Heaven

You know youâre gonna die
Your world will be gone with you
It's a dead end way
The bird goes restless, merciless
See the spread of fire

Corpse hit the floor
Death satisfies with blood
Shed from the innocent
The Iron Bird

That follows the weapon of slaughter
For a second that shine
Makes your life fade away
The fire scorches the earth
Your homeland, the heaven
