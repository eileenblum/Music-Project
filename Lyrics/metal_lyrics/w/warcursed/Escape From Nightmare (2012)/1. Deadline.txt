[Music: Richard Senko/Jean Philippe, lyrics: Glauber Ancelmo/Jean Philippe]

They all think of death
As a deadline
A deadly fate
As a great mystery

And they are right
But there is more
It's also the dawn
Of a great pain

The feel of loss
The greatest regret
Sometimes not worthy
The remorse crawls on your chest

Burning restless
My apologies
We are sorry
No one feels like you do

You lost a piece of your life
Never to replace it again
The scars mark your flesh
Forever they will stay

Nothing and no one
Is able to change it
He will not return on the third day
Don't even consider that

They all think of death
As a deadline
A deadly fate
As a great mystery

And they are right
But there is more
It's also the dawn
Of a great pain

Be different from the most
Get rational
Realize that
It is only true in fairy tales

Accept reality
The harder it can be
Raise your head, savor life
Because soon it will be your time
