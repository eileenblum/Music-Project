[Music: Richard Senko/Marsell Senko, lyrics: Glauber Ancelmo]

What can our eyes see?
Unfortunately the limits are short
We can see structures
With no remark of true and false
Our vision confuses us
Everyone can see
The truth before our eyes
Have the strength to see it

Freedom satisfies you
Let it flow
The last drop is always the best
Free your most crushing images

To understand the true human nature
This is our greatest challenge
To overcome our limits
The true pleasure
Is to choose where to go
Live while youâre alive
Is it sin or immortal life?
False ideology

Society lives
In unreal hope
Creeds = fake help
Life is yours

Admit no interventions
Control your own fate
Hypocrisy is brutal
Look at the true reality

To follow this is to be blind
Still there is time
To make the certain choice
It is in your hands

Inside you there is no soul
Just a voracious craving

You are better alone, believe that
Dive in the abyss of truth
This universe awaits for you
Feel deep the might
The real life is yours

Eye of Judgement
