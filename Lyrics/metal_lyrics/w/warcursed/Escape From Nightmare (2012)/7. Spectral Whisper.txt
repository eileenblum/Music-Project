[Music: Richard Senko, lyrics: Glauber Ancelmo]

Closed within my curse
Only myself and my hate inside

No fear touches me
Nothing controls me
There are no innocents
No innocents in here

Stand alone, forceful, furious
Mortal silent weapons
No fear, no light, no life
No law, no sin, no God

This silence makes me create
Create to destroy
Destroy to live
And live to kill

Close my eyes and hear the spectral whisper
It is in silence I perceive the most unholy weapons
We live in a black alliance
The spectral lord has the key to reasoning

Spectral Whisper

In silence, everything is more fierce
More blood, more pain
A cursed kingdom
Filled with damned beasts

Look into my eyes
There is no hope
The end is coming
Nothing left to lose
