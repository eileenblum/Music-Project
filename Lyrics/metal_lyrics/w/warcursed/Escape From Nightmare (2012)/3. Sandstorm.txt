[Music: Richard Senko, lyrics: Richard Senko]

Night falls and the war begins
When you're alone
Besides the cold and heat
The fear has already taken your shadow

I never know if time runs fast or slow
My path is always the same
Tonight I will wander again
Searching for a new way

I never felt the pleasure of the life you took from me
I never saw the hope because the sandstorm always hides it
I always see the fear pursuing me to torture
I always see the door of death, the entry for a life

When you open your eyes and nothing changes
You are really alone
The lonely desert is the gun that will take my soul
And this is what eternal desert wants
To taste impurities of my flesh
But my freedom is also eternal
And the desert will only feel the smell of my pain
