[Music: Richard Senko/Jean Philippe, lyrics: Glauber Ancelmo]

The inner peace gives in to fear
Through this fear we are helpless
When we see everything around us
We witness the onset of war

The gates open with tempest rage
Hate is your force
Force that leads to carnage
Chaos violates my mind

Did it have to be this way?
Is it God?
Is this the life?
Why did I die?

We don't know our fate
We only know death is coming
Men fall at their sons' feet
Dreams stay behind

Lives are thrashed
Death forgives nobody
Justice is a non existing word
The enemy reigns

In this war there is no
Victim or villain

There are only two opposite faces
Taken by
Hate and pride

Fighting for what is right
Fighting for their lives
Dying for nothing

With no mercy
They destroy
One by one

Those who stayed lost their pride
And turned to slaves
Of a repressive law

That's where everyone perceives
In war there is no
Victory or defeat
