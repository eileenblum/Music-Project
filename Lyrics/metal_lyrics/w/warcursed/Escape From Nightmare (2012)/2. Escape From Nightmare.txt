[Music: Richard Senko, lyrics: Richard Senko]

In the darkness
Where my eyes deceive me
My fears become real
The curse is everywhere

In this darkened world
The search for an exit
Am I trapped
In a dream or another life

The only thing that I know
The exit is my sacrifice

Escape from Nightmare

Amid pain screams
Death and blood everywhere
And when I close my eyes
Try to run from the nightmare

I feel something approaching
Veins tie me to shadows

Escape from Nightmare

Blowing the cold wind of freedom
The end of the nightmare
Now I feel a peace that I devour
In the touch of death

I feel my freedom
Cold wind of consolation
