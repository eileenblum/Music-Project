No class, no meaning, no doubts. No questions and no coming-outs. No reasons, but still on the prowl. No glory, but ruling the crowds.
Nothing to say but you're still proud. With entertainment in mind and dressed in clouds.
Nothing to give that I need to get. Nothing to sell that I never had. This is mass media and you don't stick out.
The more things change, the more things strange, our community decays, the more things change, the more thing strange, are we damned to fail?
The more things change. The more things strange.
Nothing to give that I need to get. Nothing to sell that I never had. Nothing! How couldn't I question art? How couldn't?! How couldn't I question art? How!?
