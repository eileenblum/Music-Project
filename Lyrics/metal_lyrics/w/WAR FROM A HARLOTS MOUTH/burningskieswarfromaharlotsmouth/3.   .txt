Switch on your god, sit back and relax, all there is and all we need, is an addiction at our own fingertips.
He covers us in fear, blow up the charades! Telling us that we can't keep up, trash the charade!
On and on end on and on, now it is my turn, I want to wash your head with gasoline.
On and on end on and on, your empty talk is an abandoned forest, I'm chopping it down.
You're not free now - you never were, on and on end on and on end on...
