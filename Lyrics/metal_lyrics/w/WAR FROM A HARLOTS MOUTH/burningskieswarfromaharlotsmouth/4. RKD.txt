[originally by Burning Skies]Rape 'em, kill 'em, dump 'em. It's what happens on a daily basis, there's nothing to stop it happening, so they try and try to prevent.
Always the case, due to sexual urges, finding it fun, not wrong.
Vanish in the air!
Pollute the skies, the clouds will clear the nihilism, sucking the shit off your mind, forget your impersonations.
You've made a name for yourself, you're what we call scum.
Anger excitement rapist, or whatever you may be.
You've made a name for yourself, you're what we call scum.
Send out the search parties, for another case of RKD, on and on for centuries, just another RKD.
Rape 'em, kill 'em, dump 'em, it's what happens on a daily basis, and there is nothing to stop it, stop it happening now.
