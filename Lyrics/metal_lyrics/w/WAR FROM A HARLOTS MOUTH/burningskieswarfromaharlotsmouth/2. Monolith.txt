On a stranger's floor a thousand miles astray, I want to leave this place to fall and decay, my cold heart is missing home tonight, but 20 more days and no end in sight.
I'm counting the days, and the change that remains, can't stop eating all the shit that I hate... haven't got payed a few nights in a row, still Mr. Important is asking for gold.
His service ain't got us the smallest snack, it's his achievement there's no place to crash, he's just holding out his hands, we still have to pay for losing cash.
