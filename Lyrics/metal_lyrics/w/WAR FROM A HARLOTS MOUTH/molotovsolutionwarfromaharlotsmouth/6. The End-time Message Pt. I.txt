lay down the decision it has been decided!I've never felt finished off but now it's coming to an bitter end used to try-tried to let me fall in cries of shame...cast in nowhere a slave to his own sins is standing a knife in his hand he will bleed, maybe sink down withnevertheless freedom will come...day by day the same procedure a neverending storyjust show me the alternate end I dreamed the black nights falling the prison to feel falling upstairs again and again
