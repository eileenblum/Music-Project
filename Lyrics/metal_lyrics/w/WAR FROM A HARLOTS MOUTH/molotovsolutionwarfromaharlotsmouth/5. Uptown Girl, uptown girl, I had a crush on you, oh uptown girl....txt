love...is my everlasting war!it was easy to give-in to temptation to glorify you and become dependent and you continued to fail to provide clarity and clarity the signals were easy to misinterpret yet strong enough to attract my hopewhat burden have I loaded on my shoulderseven the strongest back threatens to collapse beneath itdo you hear me?do you hear me?you are out of reach but visible!will this distance lead us together?it isn't easy to forget who you are but please...please don't limit me!
