It's not that I wonder
No, I'm not impressed
You gained some cheap respect

But now it's time to collapse
Surprise! No, I'm not dead yet

But I was calculating with wrong varibales
Clarity comes like a shot to the head

This is life
And the beat goes on
My point of view has changed
But you still want me
To be weak

I'm not down with that
So you are losing your part in "Us"
