overrated

someone got identity
and now you fake it
you created a chain
and i'd love to break it

concepts you bite
cause your identity ain't tight
tryin' to be something you're not
like pullin' a knife at a gunfight

i stick to my guns
and to my artillery
you're the boy who lacks creativity
but still you try hard to be

a motherfuckin' hero
but, both we know
you'll stay a zero
there you go...there you go...

i stick to my guns
i won't let it go
