The irony of process
You just sit there,
Watching yourself from nothingness
Thinking of nothing specific

It is hard
To imagine a philosophy
By someone
Who might not even be able to think

Entertainment from the
Slaughterhouse
We are the architects of daily
Madness
We chew up meat with our teeth
And destroy things that are better
Than us

While seeing your world grow
He remains a child
And now he sees what you are doing
And can't undestand

But you actually really don't know
What Charlie thinks
Because he didn't say anything about
Himself

We chew up meat with our teeth
And destroy things that are better
Than us
