Lazy and convenient she is
The mother of the nation
The mother of creation

She spends more on commercialising a cause
Than she does on feeding her products

Forget about the news
News are her advertisement
Speaking too many cold words chopped her lips

Forget about the news
Speaking too many cold words chopped her lips
