You're under surveillance
But they force you to smile
The grin of suppression
Makes the face of regression

Understand what situation you're in
And ask the right questions

You still give up
What will never become

Self-determination
Vs. higher income

Your freedom has a price
And you pay it from the taxes

Which pay their coup d'Ã©tat
The rise of the establishment
Operations under false flag
Are their power, your retirement

You rather buy things you don't need
From money you don't have
To impress people you don't like
Who keep the job 'inside'
