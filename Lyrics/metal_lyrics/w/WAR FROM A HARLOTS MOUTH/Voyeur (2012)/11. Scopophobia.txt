Leave me alone
Swarm of drones
With compound eyes
I wish they were blind

Leave me alone, alone

Thousands of receptor units
Flooded with my awful sight
They are everywhere
I cannot hide

Be afraid
Be very afraid

You cannot trust the parasites
You cannot trust the parasites

I dreamt they were men
But the insects are awake
They're after me
I'm mammalian prey

Leave me alone
Swarm of drones
With compound eyes
I wish they were blind

Leave me alone

They are insects disguised as men
They are parasites
They are feeding off of men
No compassion
No compromise

Poetry of flesh
Poetry of scopophobia
Morbid fear of being gazed at
Poetry of hide and seek

Be afraid
Be very afraid

You can't trust, can't trust
