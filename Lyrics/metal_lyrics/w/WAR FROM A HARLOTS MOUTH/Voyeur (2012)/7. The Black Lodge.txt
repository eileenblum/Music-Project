I am waiting for you!
Fire, walk with me!

When you see me again
it won't be me.
This is the waiting room,
I will see you again.

One and the same.
Wrong way.
I am waiting for you,
Doppelganger!

I saw the face of the man
who killed me!
Who killed you?

I saw the face of the man
who killedâ¦
â¦you must be mistaken!

I'm alive!

I saw the face of the man
who killed me!
Who killed you?

If you give me your soul,
I will let her live!
He can't ask for your soul,
I will take his!

Be quite!
I did not kill anybody.

Fire, walk with me!
