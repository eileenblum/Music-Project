The truth, the truthâ¦
there is no truth!
You can't bring these men
to justice.
They know no law.

They are the engineers
of your future.
They only fear one thingâ¦
Exposure!

Expose them and their crimes,
expose them!
Destroy the destroyer's
ability to destroy.

All is going to hell!

And it's gonna take more bullets
to win this game.
But one bullet
and I can give you a thousand lives.

When you go undergroundâ¦
A war is raging,
Fight or die!
Listen carefullyâ¦
â¦you have to learn to
live with the rats!

There is one law:
Fight or die!
There is one rule:
Resist or serve!
