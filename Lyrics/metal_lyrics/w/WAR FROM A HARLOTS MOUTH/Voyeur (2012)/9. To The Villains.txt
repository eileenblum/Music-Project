Another end
of a random day,
my head aches
and I can't sleep away.

The dreams reverse
and the nightmares awake,
to reality,
as in the things you create.

With crossed out ears
i wander around,
to see you turn
your inside out!

I am cursed!

V, from the neck
to the vomit that bursts,
from the limp fellowship
and its virtue lost,
to the villains,
who make profits of those.

Knowing that we are cursedâ¦
I am cursed!
â¦preparing for the worst.

I am cursed!

And the bomb keeps ticking.
If it could only go offâ¦

To shed some blood and tears.
