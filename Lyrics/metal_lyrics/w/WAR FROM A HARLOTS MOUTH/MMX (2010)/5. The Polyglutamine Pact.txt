No bounds you could recall
No knowledge that remains
Everywhere you go you don't belong
And nothing familiar awaits

...don't belong

While you're with us
Words are flying out of our mouths
You're staring after them

With the eyes of a ghost
And you're trying to catch up
Until infinity though
To you every sense seems lost

No bounds you could recall
No knowledge that remains
Everywhere you go you don't belong
And nothing familiar awaits

Now you are wandering aimless every night and alone
Let it go!
This place once was but never... (let it go! just let it go!)
...will be your home
