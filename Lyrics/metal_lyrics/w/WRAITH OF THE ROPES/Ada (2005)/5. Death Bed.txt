[music &amp; lyrics by Hearst and Rottinghouse]

There is a light at the end of the tunnel
My silhouette stands so clearly
And some holy presence that longs to embrace
Draws back it's caress as it nears me

With only darkness laid out in my path
I've resigned myself to the sensation
The flames of the liar sing hymns of despair
And I offer myself to damnation

Will anyone discover
My corpse beneath these rotting covers?

Am I on my death bed now?
I lift my eyes towards the tower
Emotionless I wait for death
With bitter thoughts of what I've left

Desperate to glance at the faces once more
Beyond the fever-dream door
The future dissipates
Mocking my hideous fate

Breathless, was I ever anything?
I try to hold onto the life I'm leaving
Breathless, was I ever anything?
I try to hold onto the life I'm leaving

Am I on my death bed now?
I lift my eyes towards the tower
Emotionless I wait for death
With bitter thoughts of what I've left

With fear I transcend reality
Longing only to live again
Desperate to relive my memories
And slip into another dream
I cannot escape myself
I cannot escape Hell

Fear destroys solitary life, in ruins
Straining my eyes to see
The deceased walk along
These corridors of misery

Will death bring me peace?
Or will the inferno engulf me?

Now the nightmare drags me under
Howling wind and crashing thunder
Waking now brings only anguish
rustling leaves of rotting forests

And do I sleep, is all life gone?
I wake up to horrors of dawn
The moon holds sway, must I remain
In bloodshot pain, or may I stray

Twitch and shake am I awake?
My clouded dreams are taking shape
Sleepless nights could lead to this
I reminisce, I can't resist

Known by the moon more than the sun
Where have I been what have I done?
I'm haunted by their silent screams
In memory of misery

In memory of misery
In memory of misery
