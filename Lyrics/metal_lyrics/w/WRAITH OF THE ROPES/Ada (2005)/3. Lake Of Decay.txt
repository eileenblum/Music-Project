[Lyrics by S. Rottinghouse]

Blackened laughter, what we're after
Winds of change will, bring disaster
Broken limbs will, lie in ashes
Legions form from dying masses
Pain... never-ending pain...

Limbs of clay will drift away
What's insane will stay the same
Waves of pain will cure the brain
Connect our veins to the lake of decay
Life after life, reborn revived
The living die, but the dead survive
Yellow fingers reach for the sky
From decay, the dead will rise

Spread the plague, await the grave
Within our shells, spirits depraved
In this form, fate demands
Death will form where we lay our hands
Limbs of clay will drift away
What's insane will stay the same
Waves of pain will cure the brain
Connect our veins to the lake of decay
Our broken frames that bare affliction
And tearless eyes that seek salvation
We grind our teeth, and bleed infection
We see our fate in the lake's reflection
The curse of the wretched
The breathless, and sickened
To crawl below heaven
And writhe with the wicked
Casket bound, in tattered skin
I ache to let the maggots in
I don't deserve this
I crack the surface
Draining blood, in flesh of canvass
Armies march with static eyes
Wondering if we're alive
