Seven years ago
You chose to let me hang on hollow grounds
Destroy what was yet to become
Unbreakable
So that you could keep
Circling around from a nest to another
You need to get ghost

The creatures of the past walking beside me
Showing the way, the directions to take
And for this one time
In this crowning moment
I want to separate the foe from the hero

I can feel the white light
Dying down in my fragile and forgotten body
I will never be the same again
You contaminated me
When I was at my weakest

Vague purposes
A milestone of mine
was a steppingstone for you
What I tell you now,
Carve it to your fucking mind
I will never let it go
You took everything I value in life
First time for everything
But this sure as hell was the last for me

The pain
Brighter days are dust in the wind
You stole my time
I would even give my tongue to get it back
Words ainât gonna help me find myself
from this labyrinth of deception
I want to fall asleep
Knowing that I have days before me
I close my eyes and hope you wake up

Seven years ago you already lived my life
In a heartbeat it was gone
Seven years ago you already lived my life
In a heartbeat it was gone
