Why am I wasting my days to breathe?
When there are only eyes on the gallows
Waiting to see, trying to feel,
Waiting to start to heal

What could I do to face my fears
When my roots are growing in
I cannot find a way

Every second that Iâm with my horrors
Who the fuck took my voice
The remnants of my moving tongue
Every second that I live my life

Times ainât waiting for us to follow
While the thread is burning out
What is said now will never get done
Under the curse of this world

Every second that Iâm with my horrors
Who the fuck took my voice
The remnants of my moving tongue
Every second that I live my life

I learn
To be dead behind the eyes
I learn
To be dead

Times ainât waiting for us to follow
While the thread is burning out
What is said now will never get done
Under the curse of this fucking world

Am I dead?

Now that Iâm wasting my days to breathe
I am disappointed

With broken knees I climb the stairs
Reaching to something behind that wall
So many nails have been scratching the door
But none of them, none of them
With broken knees I climb the stairs
Reaching to something behind that wall
So many nails have been scratching the door
But none of them will find the light
