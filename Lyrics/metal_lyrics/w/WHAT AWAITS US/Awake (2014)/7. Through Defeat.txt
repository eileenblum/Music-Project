When the days are darkened
A new breed is born
The strong become weakened
Struck down to one knee

Gazing to the heavens
To see a glimpse of a silver lining
The way the world once stood
Exists no more

Catastrophic incidents
Will end an era for someone
Thereâs water everywhere
What do we have to gain
In order to help the helpless
Those in struggle,
those in need for a better tomorrow

Weâve got to fight for this
We need to get back on our feet
We need each other
To be born again from the ashes filling the air
Give me a word and say
I wonât be left alone in this mess
In the moment of weakness
We need to wipe the faces of strangers

In the breaking of dawn
As the light finally shows a peak of itself
The sight of a total devastation is etching, overwhelming
You need to take our hands
cause we are still shaking of fear
Broken moon draws a tide to itself

Flood! Flood! Flood
There is water everywhere

We are only individuals 
Walking on the face of the earth
Taking little steps
Until we hit the shore
With the burning debris and day dreams torn
No one to lift us up
We cry for helping hand
Helping hand
