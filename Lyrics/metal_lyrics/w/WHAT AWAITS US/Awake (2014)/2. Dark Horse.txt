Stand up and fight for the things
That matter the most to you
Youâve got to take whatâs yours
And never give in for
What they ask nor what they tell you to do
It only drives their own fucking interest

We wonât be defined
We wonât be criticized
We wonât be defined by you

We might get washed away from the lifeline
The courage we need is right inside us
Stand against a sea of enemies
They can't fucking break us

We won't be compromised
We won't be condemned
We won't be compromised by you

You can draw a line in the sand
But it's easy to step over it
We gotta do what really is necessary
Unrest out of dissent

We bring the silence
For what comes to our lives
We bring the silence
Right back into your mouth
We bring the silence
Though we stand alone
We bring the silence
Right back into your heart
Into your heart

We cast the stone to tremble the temple
It will shake for the sake of threat
They gotta face the unpleasant aftermath
Unrest that's what they said

We bring the silence
For what comes to our lives
We bring the silence
Right back into your mouth
We bring the silence
Though we stand alone
We bring the silence
Right back into your heart
Into your fucking heart
