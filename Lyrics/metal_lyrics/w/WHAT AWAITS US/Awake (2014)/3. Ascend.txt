Rose leaves on a palm of a hand
Exposure will make them ascend
Careful not to clench too tight
They lose color
And leave just a memory behind

These days are a dime a dozen

Run-down shelter gaining strength
From troubles' demise
Gaunting thoughts will step aside
One less but the leaves will bloom

Can one perfect day
Compensate all the grief I've felt?
Can one thriving leaf
Replace a withering crop?
Can one perfect day
Compensate all the grief I've felt?
Can one thriving leaf
Replace a withering crop?

When all the others are lost

All this time
I've filled my hands with emptiness
A swirl of wind has taken them
All this time
I've filled my hands with emptiness
But from this point forward
I'll remember to keep them safe and sound

I won't forget
what it is to stumble through the dark waters
I won't forget
that in the deepest abyss I still have red in my hands

Red in my hands
In my hands!

All this time
I've filled my hands with emptiness
A swirl of wind has taken them
All this time
I've filled my hands with emptiness
But from this point forward
I'll remember to keep them safe and sound

All this time
Emptiness
But from this point forward
I'll remember to keep them safe and sound
All this time
I will remember
