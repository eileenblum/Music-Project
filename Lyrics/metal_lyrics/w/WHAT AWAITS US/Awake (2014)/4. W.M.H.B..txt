Another night poured down the drain
I am tired to feel numb of everything
A long time ago I made a pledge
How I would set the sticks on the board

So it seems that I have lost them all
In ruins lie the dreams that I once built
I know these words have been said before
But I donât know who the fuck I am anymore

Can you look right through me?
Is there something you can see?

I have always resent self-pity
And I thought it was a fix
To feel something else
Than what it represents
I have never felt this lonely

Surrounded by the people
Who love me but I canât give it
The respect that it needs
This mask has started to
Live a life of its own
It is wearing me out

Sometimes a person canât exist
Without letting others down
I am not an exception
They say making mistakes
Gives us a key to deliverance
I just want everyone to know
that I am sorry for everything

Tangled by these vines of hate
I lost the game and closed my eyes
At nights when I canât really sleep
The feeling of inadequacy takes me
In a way Iâm exhausted by shame
The darkest hour will cover it all
I deny and I forget
Never had the chance to feel regret

Sometimes a person canât exist
Without letting others down
I am not an exception
They say making mistakes
Gives us a key to deliverance
I just want everyone to know
That I am sorry for everything
