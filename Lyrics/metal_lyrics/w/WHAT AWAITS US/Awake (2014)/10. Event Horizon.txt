Sinister wind brings the final breath
To this smothering city of fear
Collective regret made them face
The impending tempest

Everyone looks so pale and faceless
Pale and faceless
The old haven has no walls
It has no walls

Time has come for father to clear the path
For mother to show her wrath
Give us the black rain we deserve
In the eye of the storm you can be heard

The brooding sky, itâs getting grimmer
Dance in the rain turns into a hide and seek
Untouchable, we have all lived in illusion
Now we bow in front of the storm

The cityâs glow is a light house
guiding its way to shore
Departing water is dragging
the shoreline under her fierce care
The breeze before rain
is a sirenâs cunning call to arms
She summons her forces
to pull us back where we belong

The brooding sky, itâs getting grimmer
Dance in the rain turns into a hide and seek
Untouchable, we have all lived in illusion
Now we bow in front of the storm

Canât escape it
They stare at me
Bodies on the ground
Iâm losing it
They scream at me
Now
Silence breaks!
