Silence is not a sign
Of my fucking compliance
These depraved walls
Are on the verge of coming down
Leaving traces of bittered bricks
To remind us what we were built of
The artifact of hope
Through its cracks I can see it now

Dodge the bullet one more time
And I promise I'll shoot you myself

I won't stay in this sinking ship
'cause I know it won't hold much longer
If you point your finger at me again
I swear I'll break them all
Cracking of bones is a soundtrack
As I am making this even
Instead of me it will be you filling lungs
In this endless sea of shit

Swim against the tide

I won't be a victim
I won't get casted aside
I reclaim my self-respect
So sleep with the
Sleep with the fishes bitch!

How am I supposed to be
Everything you force me to be?
I only have one choice to make
Fight back or get left fucking dead
What am I supposed to feel
As I pull this knife out of me?
Eyes covered I'm walking the plank
But I have some dignity left in me

Fuck you!
