The morning extends its arms
Refuse to take what it offers
Lifeless light paints the walls
A hard beginning makes a perfect ending

This dawn gives a new chance
Will you take it?
Form the chaos,
build it up and claim the power
The ruins and the ghosts
Are far behind you
A day of turmoil in your hands
It can be found by crossing over

Hereâs a toast
to the nights we wonât remember
With the friends we will never forget

WE ARE here for this
UNITED against the legion
WE ARE venom for the weak
UNDEFEATED, united
WE ARE here for this
UNITED against the legion
WE ARE venom for the weak
UNDEFEATED, united


Never give up and never give in
Give them hell with the burn within
Night is your bitch you fucking paid for it
Itâs here and now so make it count
For this time that we are given
Live the moment donât look back
Tear the walls down surf the crowd
Fuck the rules just make us proud

When the night falls
The armada appears
Children of the night come together

Hangovers will last a day
But the memories we make tonight
will last a lifetime

WE ARE here for this
UNITED against the legion
WE ARE venom for the weak
UNDEFEATED, united
WE ARE here for this
UNITED against the legion
WE ARE venom for the weak
UNDEFEATED, united

As one we are
Unstoppable, unfuckwithable
Strength in numbers is control over this
Our family means that no one gets left behind
With these words in mind
Fuck this place up!

WE ARE here for this
UNITED against the legion
WE ARE venom for the weak
UNDEFEATED, united
WE ARE here for this
UNITED against the legion
WE ARE venom for the weak
UNDEFEATED, united
