From now on I lay in the shadows
These traps are set once more
As far as I know
The purity will blacken again
Harvest the fields of this golden age

Without true purpose
Iâm deceived
By the ones who once
Once set the walls up

Iâm the one pushed against the wall

Out came the wolves
These lives are filled with lies
Burned for nothing
Youâre not the only one

Donât walk out
Donât turn a blind eye
Donât walk out
Donât walk away

Now two of us stand on the edge
Purifying rain will wash our faces
The paintings will soon be wiped away
And the true colors will shine once again

Look into my eyes and say it loud
That youâre not the one to blame
Undisguise yourself

Out came the wolves
These lives are filled with lies
Burned for nothing
Youâre not the only one
Out came the wolves
These lives are filled with lies
Burned for nothing
Youâre not the only one

Which side youâre on?
This kind of life,
Life is worth nothing
Finally Iâm relentlessly
Fighting for nothing
