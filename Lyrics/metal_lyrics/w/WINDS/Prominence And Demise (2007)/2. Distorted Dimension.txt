Channeling my thoughts to another dimension
Searching for symbols of cosmic intervention
Entering thoughts of subliminal emotions
They are like waterfalls of desert oceans

I exit this mindset and enter actuality
An everlasting reminder of a distorted reality
Trying to make it out from a distance
Listening for sounds of a meaningful existence

The call is like a faint noise distorted yet clear
The answer to the riddle still out there somewhere

Back and forth again to find the right course
Encountering signs of a creationistic force
Fragments of space-time in a pocket universe
One step ahead to take another in reverse

The call is like a faint noise distorted yet clear
The answer to the riddle still out there somewhere
