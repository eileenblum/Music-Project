I choose you to be my noble redeemer
The last shred of hope for a timeless dreamer
A guiding light through life's propulsion
The reason to exist in a world of revulsion

The passion is found, time starts anew
By this I am bound, my virtue is you

But I also know light and its treachery
I've tasted the glory of life
Infinite wisdom I possess
And I know its hypocrisy

For I have walked the darkest path
I have seen the bitterness it reaps

Things are not always what they seem to be
Trust not all they tell you to believe
Know the impression is as false as the messenger
Wolves in sheep's clothes are out to deceive

I choose you to be my savior in grace
My undying hope in this lonely place
But now I release you from your chains
So free me now and claim my remains

The passion is gone, time is ending
None shall be spared, for hell is ascending
