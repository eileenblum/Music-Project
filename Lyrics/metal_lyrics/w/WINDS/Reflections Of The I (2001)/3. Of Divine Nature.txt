I am now at the edge of my being
God of my eternity
I am the will of fate
Forever and beyond
What I desired above all

Within is the path to find my way
I search the inner depths of my soul
Yet how I would find my serenity
I never could foresee...

I seek to find the balance

And within my reflection...
The ways of mind

I am at one with existence
Foundation by my hands
I am the will to create
Perfection in my own image
