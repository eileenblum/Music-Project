In a fate beyond the mind's eye
I see no reasoned foresight
Whether eyes can envision the trace
The sun will cast light any way

And when I arose from the heavens
I found this to be true
For who was I to foresee my waning
Time's presence has passed

And in the darkest hour of my existence
Vanity was still my demise

As silence arrives to fill my world
I realize my stillness of mind
While beyond the dreamscapes
Echoes revolve from afar

I can hear their voices, speaking of angels
Whispering thoughts of a kingdom divine
To me, the fallen...
