Of thoughts to my being I wonder
I contemplate my inner self
My senses' only assailant
In this reality

So I rise above my creation
Into my mind beyond my perspectives
I release myself from my inner chains
To free my soul from damnation

I convey my essence of spirit
As it shines upon me
How beautifully tragic it is
Yet with a glimmer in its eyes
