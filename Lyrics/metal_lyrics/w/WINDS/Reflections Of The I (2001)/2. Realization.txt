Truth to existence...
I found in my dreams
Yet I saw, in the fields of souls
Doubt in the glints of an eye

Among the many I found the few
And none could foresee the coming of their fate

Bewildered by confusion
Fearing what they never knew
They chose to remain...restrained

Grieved I was to the depths of my soul
For I could not reserve the tide
By tragic mourns for the vile
I cleansed my essence, and thus became divine
