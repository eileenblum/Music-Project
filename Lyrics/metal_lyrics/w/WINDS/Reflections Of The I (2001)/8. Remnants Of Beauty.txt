Beyond the world I wandered
To find a birth in my death
And at the crown of my journey
I saw dawn from far away

Scattered remnants of beauty
Behind ruins of decay
This is the fate of the fallen soul
Destined to walk alone
With none at side and none above

My time has come, yet again
To be the soul survivor
What a lonely existence
In this cosmos of mine
