As time extends its shadow
I reflect the final view
As the sun sets for the last time
I mirror the dusk of night

Darkness falls into my world
As I breathe in the essence of life
I clench to my spirit in wonder
As I take in this end of mine

From their burst of flames I came to be
And to them I shall now return
Beyond all horizons...

Until the creation mists sparkle once more
And then amidst the glow of radiant stars
I shall arise again
