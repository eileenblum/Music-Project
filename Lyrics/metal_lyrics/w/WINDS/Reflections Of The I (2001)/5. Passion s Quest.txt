In the time of silence
I saw a trace for my will to be

While in the remnants of my heart
I saw them shine through clouded eyes

In the depths of the night
I reach beyond the brightest stars...

And I touch your wings with my remorse
As I drain my fountain of spring

My deepest reverence
My exposed serenity

From the depths pf my boundless heart
I pledge myself to thee

My days of novelty  have decayed
I find myself at the end of infinity
I gaze to see the angels...
