If there is only this one existence
Be this the darkest of my days

If i am meant to indure
Let the world falter
Beyond the confines of man

Too bound to see the light of the world
In this earthly paradise

Where truth shall rise above all
This is where i belong

All that search and question
May they find and know
As opposed to eternal bliss
In the confines above

This one existence, mirrored in time
This one entity of a mind
Upon a world of despair,
seeking for its place
What is to become of it all?
