I stand upon the portal
Mirrored in the reflecting water
Watching my own image, as i ask myself
What am i doing here?

I came slowly into the night
From unknown corners of the universe
I tried to find the ways to wander
But my mind is torn between the two

While this river flows down the past
I dream it all away - for you
While my thoughts wander into the coming
Fallen are the stars - for you

As the sun sets into the water
I dream it all away - for you
As the skies darken the world
Fallen are the stars - for you

I drive into oblivions wonderalnds
Of timeless moments in a mind's mystery joy
They came silence - as never heard before
As for the first time i heard the angels cry
