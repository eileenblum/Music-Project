In an instant our fates were sealed
With no option of repent
In the night, so far away
Out of harms reach, is this where i belong?

Here i stand in the midst of it all
While i look behind
And all i see is that broken tree of old
Alone in the cold

Cast aside by a moment in time
Derived by a quest in wonder
I see shadows against the stars as they draw nearer
The moon like a painting in the water

What do i seach for in the distance?
This memory haunts me still

The memories i once had
Dreamlike shadows
Now washed away by the rivers of time
The darker side of the two

This is the reason why
It is all written in blood
