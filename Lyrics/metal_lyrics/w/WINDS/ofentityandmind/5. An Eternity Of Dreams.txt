Before the silence was broken - i looked through the eyes of time
In the earliest days of memory - back when the days were young
Foresighted by forgotten memories - from a different death
I learned my ways - and still i wander

My reflection becomes pale in the dense light
Over the water of drowning souls
From tears cried by a fallen angel - for a fallen souls
Where the heating hands of garce failed to reach

Searching for the keys to unlock doors
That can solve the hidden mysteries of the soul

As i enter through the portal and await the new days
I look behind for nothing more to see
A veil of stars is waiting - for me to join them
Into an eternity of dreams...
