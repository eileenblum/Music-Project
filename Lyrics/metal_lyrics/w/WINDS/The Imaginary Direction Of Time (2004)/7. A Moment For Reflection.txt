A shadow covers me
I see a distant star in the cold sky
For a single moment, time stands still and becomes an eternity of lost dreams
I'm looking at that dark place, somewhere out there in the universe
I awake from my trance: reality is still intact, still unharmed and unbroken
Not even my last resolve can change its will

Each moment ahead is completely in the dark
We know nothing of what's to come and fragments of memory is our only gift
I take a step further into the night, having remembered, but still I remain
The source of this design is unknown,
Yet walking in circles seems to have meaning somehow
