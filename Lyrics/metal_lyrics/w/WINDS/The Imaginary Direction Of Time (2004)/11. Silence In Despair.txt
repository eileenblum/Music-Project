In splendor it lies before me
Awaiting my final return
Like a desolate moon
Floating around in nothingness
I am a wanderer, alone
In endless search for answers

I follow the sun
Through ocean of stars
Yet in this dark place of matter
Darkness prevailed

I return to the shadow
By which I am destined to dwell
Beginnings and ends are the same here
And everything else passes in silence
