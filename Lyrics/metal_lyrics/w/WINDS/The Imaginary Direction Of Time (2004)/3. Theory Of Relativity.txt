Where lies the wonder in all I see
Surrounded by a phantom dream
I question my fate in this existence

In my view are my deepest thoughts
Bound together by that which isn't real
In this kingdom truth lies hidden

Existing through infinity and space
Where fate is concealed and matter released
The deepest secrets of my world
I open my arms and welcome their demise

Yet they will never seize to be
Expanding everlasting beyond limitation
Created and recreated with no conclusion
