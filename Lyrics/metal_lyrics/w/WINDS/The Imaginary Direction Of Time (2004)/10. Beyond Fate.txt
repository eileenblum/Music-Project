An awakened moment of revelation
Proceeded by times of revolution
In light of an excess phase
An era of time without space
Time and again I look beyond
Counting the chance of fate

Time and again I look beyond
Questioning chance of faith

I see the light of that sunny day
I feel the caress of love
I now know what ugliness is
I seem to recall
