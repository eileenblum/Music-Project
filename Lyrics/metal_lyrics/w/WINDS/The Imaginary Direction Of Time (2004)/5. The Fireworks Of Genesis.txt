We reach toward the untouchable
Streams of endless light surrounding our embrace
But those flames burned cold long ago
Left are only remnants of time and space

These are the things we're only meant to feel
In fragments beyond time's mighty reel

Feed the fire before the fire feeds on us
It's the way of life as we know it before it comes to pass
This is the ultimate paradox

The fireworks of genesis are at play
We're given life only to have it taken away
If the dice is rolled when truth be told
Then sit back and watch the game unfold
