Can you hear the stepping on twigs?
Can you see the heart of the dark?
Can you smell the scent of vigor lost?
Can you feel the gust of cold?

I can show you what beauty is
But needed is a heart of trust
We ignite the spark of sound
And seem blinded to the enlightened

The sting of rot is our perfume
Where god's icy wind will blow

When I smell the roses humanity smells
When I hear the voice of belief
When I see the light of a sunny day
And when I feel the caress of love

Remind me what ugliness is
I cannot seem to recall

Charmed by the smell of the roses
Feinted by the voice of belief
Deceived by the light of a sunny day
And lured by the caress of love
