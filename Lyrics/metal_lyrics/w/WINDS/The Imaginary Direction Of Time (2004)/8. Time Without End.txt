I look through the hourglass waiting for time to pass
The hours are like old traces of lines in the sand
It seems I've strayed from the path somehow
Lost in the memories of old tomorrows

Not recalling where I am, I stop for a moment in thought
A voice calls out to me in the darkness of my imagination
Take my hand and walk with me, for I will show you the way
Take my hand and walk with me, for I will lead the way

You dream of that which lies beyond, but once you're there, there is no turning back
When you walk with me, your fate has been sealed until time without end
Desiring to be enlightened at every cost, no matter the consequence
A weakness greater than you will ever know, for the means justify the end

A moment seems like a lifetime in this mindset
As if time stands still, yet the sand seeps down at a steady pace
I bend my thoughts in contemplation, challenging accepted insight
In deepest thought I am as time runs out
