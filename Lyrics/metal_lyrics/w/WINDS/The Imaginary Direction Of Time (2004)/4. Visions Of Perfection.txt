I speak through my silence
I let my stillness wander
I stagger across the end of forever
Taking me to my home
Where nothing ever ends
A place so far away
In the midst of the heavens

Spread your wings and fly
Fly towards the open sky
Be free

By the sun and its fire
My burning desire
Nothing can take me higher

Before my eyes in all its wonder
Beauty presented in all its awe
Visions of perfection wielded by sight
To which my reverence will never yield
