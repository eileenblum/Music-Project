Here we are afraid to give
Here we are afraid
Afraid to live
Largest nations in the world
They kill, atomic missile, I hear unto

The U.S.S.R. just fights us off
With their crazy words
For you know, you know the red stain hurts
Don`t they know the next world war`ll be the last one
The dying country on it`s knees
Goes 'n drops the atom bomb
And that`s the end of our world

What kind of country is Russia
People dying, truth doesn`t lie
Communism`s lost every meaning
`Cos capitalism`s all in their mind

Warn these words I say what`s the point in this life
Remember I say
This life
