From the doors of the dungeons you know
Down to the bloody gates of Hell
Men on their knees dying
Rather than to rabies smell
Will we survive? I say
From this one and only evil, Invade
The love and the friendship you know
The Lord God above once made

When the dogs lie dead
Yes silent they pray
Women and children
Yeah they die in dismay
The foaming of mouths yeah the sinking of teeth
The people who are left must get on their feet

Will the world as we know it ever be again
Full of people like me and you
A bullet I say is the only way to survive
From the pain and the anguish
Those dogs have arrived!

From the doors of the dungeons they came
Down to the bloody gates of hell
Men on their knees still dying
Rather than to rabies smell
Cold bed of hunger I say
The hand of doom points go
Men on their knees praying
The Lord God above said No

When the dogs lie dead
Yes silent they pray
Women and children
Yeah they die in dismay
The foaming of mouths yeah the sinking of teeth
The people who are left must get on their feet

Now the dogs are dying, time they lay
People surviving, none are away
No more are dying from the rabies smell
The dogs are a dying, they cheer as they...
As they burn!
They burn!
