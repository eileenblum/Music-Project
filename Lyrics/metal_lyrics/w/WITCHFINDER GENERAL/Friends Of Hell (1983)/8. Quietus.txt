You're going nowhere
What you gonna do on the run?
I'd hate to be in your shoes now, you've got to run
He's gonna find you, he's gonna get you on the run
He's right behind you
Don't look round, he's got a gun

Servitude you escaped from
Now you've got to hide
His servitors are coming in from the other side
A quick disguise, you get away, just one more time
He keeps on coming, Oh you know he won't resign

You lie awake at night hard a-thinkin'
You must not sleep just keep your eyes a-blinkin'
Frightened he might come Oh when you're sleepin'
Listen in the bushes, Is that him creepin'?

Irrationally you walk the streets at night
Your mind is irrevocable by daylight
He has a plan to get you it's a treat
He's got you where he wants
You bit the bait

You lie awake at night hard a-thinkin'
You must not sleep just keep your eyes a-blinkin'
Frightened he might come Oh when you're sleepin'
Listen in the bushes Is that him creepin'?

A sudden move the bullet yes it hits you hard
He's impeccable you know he caught you off your guard
A sudden move, another shot Yeah you provoke
It seems to me
It was the death finishing stroke
