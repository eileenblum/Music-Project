Destitute and empty
Can't stop thinking of you
You've turned my blue skies all cloudy grey
Oh I loved you but lost you
You were so untrue
Yes I loved you but lost you
Why didn't I listen to you mama
Emotionally you broke me when you went away
Condemning me to loneliness like only a woman could
Contemplating suicide
My mama said you'd be untrue
Oh I loved but lost you
You were so untrue
Yes I loved you but lost you
Why didn't I listen to you mama
