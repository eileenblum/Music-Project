Are we here or is this really the end?
Are you real or just a vision they send?
I see you now, but are you really a friend?
When I switch off Is this really the end?
The bubble of life confuses me
I need to know just why
My thoughts are just abusing me
Oh why why do we live to die?
Could it be we're only here to amuse
Oh I wish I did know their games,
I'd try and confuse
Do I think or is it there in control?
What purpose have I?
I need to know my role
The bubble of life confuses me
I need to know just why
My thoughts are just abusing me
Oh why? why do we live to die?
I'm trapped inside my head, with only my thoughts
I just keep on aging no-one ever consults
My curious mind it never seems to rest
Maybe I'm programmed
Just put down here for the test
