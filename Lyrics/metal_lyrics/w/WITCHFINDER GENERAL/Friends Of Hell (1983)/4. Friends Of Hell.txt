Midnight approaches
A circle is formed
Their faces are evil
Their minds are deformed
They preach to their demons
Sacrifice is prepared
She's placed in a circle
Oh and a dagger is beared
I've caught them all a-gathering
To commit a blood crime act of madness
Their evil possessed minds
Can kill with only gladness
To sacrifice a young one
To Satan on that day
And perish after death
The Satanist's on their path
Human corpses from the grave
Used in worships I am dismayed
Satan pleasures yeah deaths and treasures
Must be ready no not delayed.
The sacrifice is prepared
Her naked flesh was pure
They wrap her in some red vines
No sight for good I am sure
Then shout their words of evil
Brainwashed into their minds
The sacrificed dagger
'Tis placed in hands which bind
Devouring human flesh just to spill his blood like rain
Satanists rage against mankind
Take away his brain
They've sold their souls to Satan
Their witchcraft it is obscene
To be a dedicated disciple
To Satan this does mean
But I am here, They see me and they freeze
I shout the words of sacred scrolls on my knees
A steaming stench, their flesh it runs like oil
I hear their master shouting from under the soil
