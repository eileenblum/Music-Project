Would you step inside my time machine
Come see places you have never been
To Vortex Hill of eternal life
Or back in time, to see the strife
Where do we come from now?
Where do we go?
Just follow me now and I will show
You the beginning and the end
You think they're happy but you know they only pretend
Now all your people you know they are perverse
Turn time round, no, it's in a reverse
Got no logic, got no respect
Their minds and brains, they don't seem to connect
