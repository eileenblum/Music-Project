My life's been abused, my mind is confused
Best must have passed by
So now I must die
Writing these words now, finding it hard
To tell you my problems you'll just disregard
To these words I write
Oh lend me your ears just for tonight.
Love it is something could never understand
Alcohol it seems is all I demand.
Deeper and deeper depression sets in.
You don't understand now the way I have been.
To these words I write
Oh lend me your ears just for tonight.
You say you'll pull through
You don't really care
To you I am scum
Just a flea in your hair
He pays you no money
The boss wants it all
Oh answer him back
Redundant you fall
Redundant you fall
Oh go on they say now through rough and grim
They don't understand the state I am in
I'm lonely and cold now, got scars on my wrist
I know if I die I would not be missed
To these words I write
Oh lend me your ears just for tonight
I'm on my own now, I stop day and night
Or out on the street I get into a fight
Sorry for myself Yeah maybe it's true
I'm cooped up in my room with fuck all to do
Now I'm unemployed
I blame it on them, but I cannot win
Holding the knife now to plunge in my chest
I ain't got the guts maybe it's best
