When I was a young boy
Rock became my life
Sixteen I married it
Then it was my wife
Dreamt of making records
Thought it would be fun
To make you people happy
Each and every one
I need music
Oh yeah I do
I need music, every day
I need music
Oh yeah I do
I need music, every day
Oh at the age of 18
Lyrics I did write
A friend he wrote some music
Sometimes we'd fight
Then we got things sorted
Saw things eye to eye
Now I know that writing music we will die
I need music
Oh yeah I do
I need music, every day
I need music
Oh yeah I do
I need music, every day
I need music Rock it is my way
I need music
Oh yeah I do
I love music, every day
Oh yeah I do!
I love music, every day
I love music, oh yeah I do
I love music every day
I love music my music
I love it every day
