I look all around me what do I see? Man's greedy minds in a sick society,
my life is a struggle a battle with time, no chance to sleep in a city of crime,
problems have gripped me I can't run and hide - grass isn't greener on the other side,
each day I awake I'm faced with the same, the treadmill of life has left me insane.

I slowly feel my body ageing,
a stranger inside me so hard to disguise,
I'm not the man that was once created,
please help me God, it's hard to die.

The rent's in arrears I'm well overdrawn, I've lived on the breadline since the day I was born,
if there's a friend out there who would understand, we'd share the burden both hand in hand,
but I search for that love, it's something I'll never find, I'm trapped in illusion leave reality behind,
I glance in the mirror my father looks back at me - his face tells a story of his sad son's insanity.

I slowly feel my body ageing,
a stranger inside me so hard to disguise,
I'm not the man that was once created,
please help me God, it's hard to die.

Now it's time to free the bitterness in me,
a better life I must find, to leave the world behind,
God will take my hand; show me to his promised land,
to find love eluding me in peace joy and harmony.
Destroy the devil I have made, to my chest I plunge a blade,
as the knife goes in, I feel a pain within
my body now it's time to rest, when the steel leaves my chest
my evil spirits start to show, to this new life I must go.
