Spawned from the primordial infernal black
to a world of hypocritical predictions
denying the very essence of purity
oh, how blindfolded they are
their grand halls are crumbling
oh, how they falter whilst spewing lies

Excel above the throne of god
gaze down with everburning might
Cathedrals laid to ruin
the shadows whisper your name
obey or dismay

My omnipresence eclipses the sun
Foretelling!
With guile and vice they gather forces
to grow stronger, to surpass

Against the blinding light we strive
abysmal sons of night
turncoat, betray your master 
the veil of grace is burnt
and all the world shall witness
the disgrace of a true idol

A spearhead in the welkin war
we prepare for the final hour

Excel above the throne of god
gaze down through the burning night
the fading voices whisper a name
evanescent, never to be remembered
never to be remembered
