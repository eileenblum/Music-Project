Vibrating dreams
of portals in darkness
of a gate in the stars
when the circle is closed
the howling of black wraiths
Lilith reborn
now ascend to the altar
submit and change form

With unblinking eyes
in a circle of flame
beneath sacred seals
the betrayer awaits

Darkest of nightmares
Brightest of stars
Enchanting and wistful
Mistress of night

On the throne of a serpent
in the eye of the storm
reaching into the void
and corrupting the core

Anointed in blood
man and beast alike
crossing the threshold
in the flickering light
To kiss the lips
of the sightless one
mother of all abomination
Underneath desert sands
a mirage reflected
in the eyes of the damned
staring in silence
awaiting the command
surrounded she stands...
in the nothingness
above the heavens
illuminated by
the everburning black flame
