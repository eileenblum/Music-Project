Scorching the flesh from your skin
Burning embers of unspeakable pain
Screaming our in redempton
Erupt in redempton
Sell immolaton
Cornbust in spleandour

Set your soul ablaze, a bliss form below
Decaying vigor, entandle for all the

Ashes and ghosts
Purify yourself

A vacant torrent leading in
to a storm of bitter emotion
Rise up from the ashes, reborn

Scorching the flesh from your skin
Burning embers of unspeakable pain
Screaming out in anguish, conflagrate
Erupt in redemption
Self immolation
Cornbust in splendour

Erupt in redemption
Self immolation
Cornbust in splendour

Ignite your mortality
Catacylsm supremacy
New era holocaust
