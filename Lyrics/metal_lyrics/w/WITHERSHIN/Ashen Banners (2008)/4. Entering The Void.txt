Daemon eyes
staring through the endless void
searing your mind
transforming your soul

Dissonant voices
calling to your inner fears
breeding hate
burning crimson tears

Liars in wait
answer the call
the world will burn
the gate shall fall

Unwanted truths
maddening apparitions
descending into
enlightened madness
Unseen portal beckoning
with obsession
no longer man
demoniac possession

Liars in wait
answer the call
the world will burn
the gate shall fall
