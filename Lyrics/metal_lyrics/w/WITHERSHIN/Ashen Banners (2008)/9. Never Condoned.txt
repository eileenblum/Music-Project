From the ivory throne
to the gallows
the keepers of power
are not to be trusted
the clerical collar
an iron shackle
for those, who oppose

From the marble balls
to the dungeon
he who speaks lip
wiill be cast out
the cardinal sin
of liberation
will not be condoned

Hymns of oppression
psalms of oppression
hypocrite laws
threat of damnation

The robe and the scepter
the hammer and nails
temples of fear
on Foundations of lies

The pyres are burning!
piles of  dead at the crossroads
pestilence flows
from the open wounds
self proclaimed saviours
drawn like morbs to a black flame
