Spiteful and vile
I'll spit at your grave
I recreate your tragedy

As you strive for vie
you poison this land
Slithering little lamb

I despise you
I abhor you

A burden of crows
stealing your endless crown
Engrossed by selfish grandeur
Ten shades of despair
an ominious glowing glare
Your mind, hollow and sunder

I despise you
I abhor you

I'm sworn to scorn
Harvest of flesh
Reap the impurities

A godless image
depraved from the world
Nothing but endless, sickening thoughts
Hiding in clad of white disgusting mess
I revel in your glorious eternal misery

Repugnance my guiding light in this hell
The sixth circuit, impending, embracing
This world which you created, benighted
Sky of crimson the downfall of a dying world
Welcome to the end, nemesis infirmus

We hate you
We reject you

Reap the impurities
