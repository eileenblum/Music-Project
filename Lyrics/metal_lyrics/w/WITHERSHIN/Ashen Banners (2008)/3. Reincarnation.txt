Reincarnation reign
Premonition seen

Pale complexion
staring at the 
composition
of lifeless memories
with dead eyes

Flowing through
another reality
reanimated heart
pumping hatred
descending into
deafening mandess

Reincarnation feel
Pure submission kneel

Charcoal Writings
on skin
scarred yet
dreaming, screaming
denying the principles
of time

Unborn never seen
Illuminating
the brooding
everlasting sky
Descending into
deafening madness

Reincarnation reign
Premonition seen

Lifeless feelings
Dreaming pitch black
Lifeless meaning
Set mee free
