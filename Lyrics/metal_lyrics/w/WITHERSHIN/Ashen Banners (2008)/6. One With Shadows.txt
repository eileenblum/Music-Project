Where no light reaches
Dreams die and are buried
in ashes and coal
the dust of aeons now gathers
and morphets into form

One with shadows
watches, moves
rings on the water
timeless echoes

A scorching gaze from
obsidian eyes with
unlimited wisdom
pierce the curtains of time
Traveling in silence
from beyond the stars
through blackened dimensions
transcending the spectrum

One with shadows
whispers, Breathes
changing form
Rape thw world

Time has no meaning
life no beginning
death echoes
across the canvas
the sun turns black
stars bleed and fade
to nothing, as...
