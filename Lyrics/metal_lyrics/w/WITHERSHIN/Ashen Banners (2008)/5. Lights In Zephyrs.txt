Through crevice and rave
dark poetry flows
crystalized songs
of inyielding force
Shades of the past
sifted through sand
sons of the watcher
ever shall stand

The scent of the earth
that covers the dead
where sorrow is king
all hope has fled
Lights in Zephyrs
Reflected winds eho
From ages ago

Devoid of emotion
the blind onces ust see
