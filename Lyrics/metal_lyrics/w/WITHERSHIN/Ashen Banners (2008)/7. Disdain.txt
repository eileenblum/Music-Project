For I am sin
Bow Before me in awe
For I am sufferng
Your anti-god

An ill-fated Farewell to a world
slowly decaying into meaningless shit
Brought to our knees
in divine submission
to an ethereal image

Dreams turning into cavaging aces
tearming your mind forever asunder
Bark, oh bark the voices who
will bring you enlightened fulfilllent

The day of judgement, continual suffering
in bombastic brilliancy
Har magedon overshrouds this
starless sky, consuming, devourcing
A seething stigmata overture cascading
into an austere godkiller abomination

This turnorous cancerous growth, which you bequn
us, we replay in death

For I am sin
Bow there me in awe
For I am sufferng
Your anti-God

Profanity from the bowls the beast
Blood-painted canvas symbolize
Life burning nebula, caught in a
flashfire, we burn this world to our likes

For I am sin
Bow there me in awe
For I am sufferng
Your anti-God
