Open the gates
to masonic kingdoms
rivers of blood flow
let razors preach
Manifest God
revel in the madness
hollow faces wither
the truth at stake

In death, new life
new anger and fear
delusions of grandeur
guiding the blade
Artist of terror
knee deep in shame
death as a cloak
religion means pain

Soar now, blood angel
touched by the fever
perform the great work
the master has set for thee

Beneath silent towers
homage is paid
scripture in flesh
ordeum nex christi

Cathedrals of bloodshed
carnal devotion
death, my firmament
austere divination
order of serpents
cloak, dagger and lies
the art of ascension
the end of all strife
