Fear nothing but your thoughts
They shall corrode and manifest
A programmed cyborg, without a thesis or worth
Your body, is not worth the mass it takes
Insanity, self destructing human
Passage of time lost with the mind
Look deep inside, your cancer runs through your spine
You believe in all your lies

Such torture and mental collapse
Now drink the blood of your slit wrists
Torture, mental collapse
Now drink the blood of your slit wrists

Taste what you've always wanted

Enigmatic confusion
No use for earth, Valleys of Sadness
No use for life
Pitiful Human
