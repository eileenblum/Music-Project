The visions of the chaos take form inside
Devoid of such light, tasteless as my soul
Embrace the coming of the end

I no longer feel a soul inside
Ive wandered to find nothing but stale corpses of life
Truth gnarled as the roots of empty words entwine in my thoughts
Witness the death of the earth.......

The winds of plague take me with salvation
Free my spirit of unfilled desire
I stand alone......

My eyes are blind to see the light
Its faded away into the darkness
No hope..the death of this earth
I look to the sky, I am home

The years have passed me by and all i have felt is pure hate
Reopen the scars of my flesh, remembrance
Rememberance...
