Feed my hate
Repulsion divine

Abomination of surreal resistance
Trampled under foot and swept aside
Embezzled morality has degraded all thats left and all hope to become
one inside

Hate, lies, within these lives
Inherit their loss of fallen abandonment
The rains of fortune shall wash away their shadows
Leaving no trail of them behind
Kill, conquer, destroy

Fading of memory, collective thought is lost
Yet still I dream of constant murder, and suicide
The dark will rise to shatter all that breathes
Beings of light will be torn apart
Ignorance of truth
