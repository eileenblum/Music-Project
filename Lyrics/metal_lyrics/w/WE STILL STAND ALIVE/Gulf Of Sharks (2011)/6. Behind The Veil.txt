With constrained eyes
You go ahead
You see only image
Of unfilled dreams
Leave everything in the past
But live in the present
Don't to dare to forget
Some people to care

Realization of plan
Obtained by the
Ignore of principles...
Having turned back to back
Spitting out some faithless words
Could you see its real image
Real image of nothing

But what have you got now?
Without looking back
You're searching for the keys
For the starwell
You have lost in their crowds

With constrained eyes
You go ahead
You see only image
Of unfilled dreams

How can't you see?
How can't you see
That everything you loved has turned to ashes?
And everything you knew has turned to dust.
To dust.

But what have you got now?
Without looking back
You're searching for the key
For th starwell
You have lost in their crowds

And now your house is burning fire.
You remained at an impasse.
There are none.
You are alone.
