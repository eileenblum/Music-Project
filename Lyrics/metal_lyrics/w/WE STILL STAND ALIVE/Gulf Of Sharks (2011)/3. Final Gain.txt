For heart, for pure heart I came through ocean and back!
Now i know this way!

You know you have some debpt
that should be payed
I know you have some soul
that must be graved

This torment break my breast I cant stand back
I burn myself to search the truth. Stained gallows on my neck.

Like the storm in the seas
I'm buried under your tears
Weight of cares.
So mighty. I can destroy you now.
You're Thought that you are playing with me.
You're wrong.

Beneath the shining stars
We know
This curse on our souls
Is our final gain!
Nobody will blame
Nobody will pretend
I gave my all for you so I am here with nothing.
