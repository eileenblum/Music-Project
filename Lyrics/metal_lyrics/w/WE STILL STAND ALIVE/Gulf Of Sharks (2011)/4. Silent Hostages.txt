So I will never forget it!
I will never erase these scars
I wont even ask a question
Why
We
Scarlet soldiers of darkest skies
We are searching for an answers
And we'll get them right now

Every day we drive a nail into the sole of our boring existence.
Hot earth such as lava beneath our feet In the first day of heavenly prison
We prayed to the dark before the day of judgement. It will break us into the small pieces.

It is impossible to breathe the air of burning lead
It is impossible to breathe the air of burning lead

Raise hands! Say goodbye!
Our vice is flowing away!
Raise hands! Say goodbye!
Our picture is not at end!

So we still stand alive for the broken sunrise

This is not the end
This is just a begining

So I will never forget it!
I will never erase these scars
I wont even ask a question
Why
We scarlet soldiers of darkest skies
We are searching for an answers
And we'll get them right now.
