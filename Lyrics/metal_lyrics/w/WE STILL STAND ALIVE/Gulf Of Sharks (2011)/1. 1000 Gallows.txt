Wasting... Wasting your life.
Standing alone all night.
Watching through transparent doom
That this world is sick of you.

Tears and blood streaming through these burden streets
Leaving every piece to decay.
Lungs are filling up with sorrow.
Hope resurrect the next day.

To keep the silence
You don't need
To swallow your tongue
Or cut it.
This world of violence
Can make that
Your scream will never be heard.
Your suffer never be short.

Stand in line
Wait your time
Stand in line
Wait your time

Like a merciless storm eating your ship
The abyss of despair eat you from diary's sheet.
Your scream will never be heard.
Your suffer never be short.

To keep the darkness
You don't need
To close your eyes
Or fall asleep
Don't close your eyes
Or fall asleep
'Cause you won't face the truth
'Cause you won't face the truth

Love. Is it eternal?
This question's permanent.
How could something that have never existed
Have it own end?
