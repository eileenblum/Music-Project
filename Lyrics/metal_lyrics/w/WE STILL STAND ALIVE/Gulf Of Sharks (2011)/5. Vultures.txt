She looks at me every second
Hoping to find there anything new
But she see all the same
Even uglier

Walking along the street
And Envying all those around here
You're devouring things
Loking more expensive than your
Diamonds are brighter
Than you have
All that you have

Do you have something more important
Than your beauty
beauty of you

She always spits on the sooouls
Hunting for money as vultuures
Life your life dirty
Spitting on all
Dressed as whore

Walking along the street
And Envying all those around here
A man in devil mask
Will push you to the wall
Forced to remember all
Than you have done
All all that you Have done

No remorse No regrets

But its beauty lies in the tomb
It will remain in the mirror shrapnel.
