That night I didn't think
I will wake up tomorrow
That light Could only bring
a hope to moving forward

Abyss
Full of a cruelty
Full of an anguish
Engulfing Me

Only belief in yourself will help to
disperse these seas. From the outside.
So many victims has died
In the depths of the seas.
It is not a barrier for you.

You showed your teeth
My deepest fears have justified
As sharp as sharks has
These lacerated wounds will never be healed
As sharp as thousand knifes
How could I be so blind?

Abyss
Full of a cruelty
Full of an anguish
Engulfing Me

Abyss
Full of a cruelty
Full of an anguish
Engulfing Me

That night
I didn't think I will wake up tomorrow
That light
Brought me a hope so I could sail these seas
These seas.
