The oblivion's gone.
And my heart still barely beats.
I found myself laying in shatteres dreams.
A transmission with all I ever loved,
Was broken by her selfish thoughts.

Buried alive.
Without any sense of regret.
Laying face down.
Hoping to forget.
All This beautifull pictures painted in my head.
'Cause all these scenes are already dead.

So she is staying on her knees praying for mercy.
But all my feelings restrained.
There is only a malice.

I wanna hear As you bitterly crying.
I wanna see As you fucking dying.

Shattered dreams murdered hopeless.
This is all that I have now...
Burning bridges, closed gates.
So seek when you are have bound

Days and nights were spent on these fucking lonely streets finding answers.
Which show me the way i was always seek
Way which to serenity...
To serenity...
To serenity...

I wanna hear As you bitterly crying.
I wanna see As you fucking dying.

Your words have never been a truth.
If I needed three you spoke two.
So I ask you -For what this curse
Have you placed right in my broken hands

I am just a man
With a beating heart
Inside my chest
So it's my turn
To have a rest.
