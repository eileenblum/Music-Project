MY LIFE! MY FUCKING GRAVE!
IF I GAVE UP NOW AND I HAD NEVER LET YOU DOWN
WHEN I WHERE THAT CROWN, MY BROW HANGS HEAVY ON A CROWD
THEREâS NO GIVING UP! IM NOT LETTING THEM WIN.

IN EVERY YEAR THEREâS âONE DAYâ
WHEN SO MANY HAVE PASSED I FEEL THAT WHERE IS NO WAY
AROUND THIS... IM GETTING A ROUND.

COURAGE! COURAGE! YA CANâT KEEP MY HANDS AWAY FROM THIS !
TOO MANY YEARS CLENCHED IN THESE FISTS.
BROW HEAVY, FACE PISSED.
IT IS URGENT! IâM LETTING EVERYONE KNOW IT.

IâM GETTING A ROUND.
IâM GETTING A ROUND.
IâM GETTING A ROUND.

AND WHEN MY FATHER SAID, âKID YOUâRE GETTING IT NOWâ
WELL, I AM MY FATHERS SON (HEY! HEY!) AND IâM GETTING A ROUND.
COME LIFT THIS WEIGHT UP OFF OF ME.
BROW HEAVY, FACE PISSED, COME LIFT THIS WEIGHT UP OFF ME.
BROW HEAVY, FACE PISSED, COME LIFT THIS WEIGHT UP OFF ME.
BROW HEAVY, FACE PISSED, COME LIFT THIS. COME LIFT THIS...YEA

IâM LETTING EVERYONE KNOW IT.
IâM GETTING ROUND. IâM GETTING A ROUND.
IN EVERY YEAR THEREâS âONE DAYâ
WHEN SO MANY HAVE PASSED I FEEL THEREâS NO WAY
AROUND THIS.. IâM GETTING A ROUND.

AND WHEN MY FATHER SAID, âKID YOUâRE GETTING IT NOWâ
WELL, I AM MY FATHERS SON (HEY! HEY!) AND IâM GETTING A ROUND.
