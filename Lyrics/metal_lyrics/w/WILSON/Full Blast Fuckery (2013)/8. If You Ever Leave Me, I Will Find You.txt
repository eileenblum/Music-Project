Have you forgot where you came from?
Or these hands that put a name on your grave stone?
Well, Lord help you.

Where will you go when youâre called? When youâve abandoned all hope with a mouth full of gold.

When this ends and youâre thinking youâre free, I will tie you back down and turn you right into me.

If you ever thought youâd leave meâ¦
Please believe me, itâs so easy for me to find you.
And If you ever were to leave me, just believe me, itâs so easy for me to find you.

Where will you go on your own? These hands have you now, you canât breathe all alone.

If you ever thought youâd leave meâ¦
Please believe me, itâs so easy for me to find you.
If you ever were to leave me, just believe me, itâs so easy for me to find you.

I will find you. I will find you. I will find you.

When this ends and youâre thinking youâre free, I will tie you back down and turn you back into me.

If you ever thought youâd leave meâ¦.
Please believe me, itâs so easy for me to find you.
If you ever fucking leave me, just believe me, itâs so easy for me to find you.
