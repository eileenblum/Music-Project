We must head for the hills before it spreads any further on.
We must head for the hills before it spreads any further on.
Iâve been running all day.
Away from this line away from the grind that has been haunting me.
We must heads for the hills before it spreads any further on.
We must head for the hills before it spreads any further on.
So raise your weapons high and carefully shield your eyes.
Raise your weapons so fucking high
and carefully shield your eyes.

When we came into this town, I felt a sense of fear,
a hope of wrought in your air.
I said âNo, Iâm not scared.
Why? I have seen your fucking ghost!â
In towns aborted by the light they look into my eyes.

Donât look into my eyes. Donât look into my eyes.
