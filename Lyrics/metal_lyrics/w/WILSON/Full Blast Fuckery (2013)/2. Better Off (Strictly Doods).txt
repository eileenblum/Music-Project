CIGARETTES, ASHES SPENT, THE SHIPS SAILING.
THE BIGGEST BRIDE LEFT WITHOUT A FIX ON ME
THE STROM IS COMING, RAISE YOUR DEAD.
WALK ON WATERS, I KNWO WHERE YOU LIVE
AND I KNOW NOW THAT YOU ARE NOTHING.
ARMED WITH LOOKS THAT FEEL FILTHY TO ME.

THE BIGGEST BRIBE THAT I EVER TOOK WAS THE DIRT OFF YOUR BACK
WHEN YOU GAVE ME YOUR SHIRT.
WHO ARE YOU NOW? WHO ARE YOU? WHO ARE YOU NOW?!
TRUTH, LIKE RAIN, DONâT GIVE A FUCK WHO IT FALLS ON!
I CAN SEE IT NOW IN FACE OF FLAWS THAT YOU PUT ON.
CLEAR MIND, CLEAND HANDS, I KNOW ITS WRONG.

YOUâRE BETTER OFF NOT KNOWING. ITS BETTER, BETTER LEFT AND UNSAID
YOU CAN KEEP ME DOWN, IâLL TELL EMâ IâM NOT WORRIED.
CAUSE IâM BREATHING NOW, SO TELL ME LOUD, WHO ARE YOU? WHO ARE YOU NOW?

FILL ME UP, IT FEELS FILTHY TO ME, TASTE THAT TONGUE, KNOW YOUR HISTORY.
ITS ALL WRONG.

YOUâRE BETTER OFF NOT KNOWING. ITS BETTER, BETTER LEFT AND UNSAID
YOU CAN KEEP ME DOWN, IâLL TELL EMâ IâM NOT WORRIED.
CAUSE IâM BREATHING NOW, SO TELL ME LOUD, WHO ARE YOU? WHO ARE YOU NOW?

YOUâRE BETTER OFF NOT KNOWING. ITS BETTER, BETTER LEFT AND UNSAID
YOU CAN KEEP ME DOWN, IâLL TELL EMâ IâM NOT WORRIED.
CAUSE IâM BREATHING NOW, SO TELL ME LOUD, WHO ARE YOU? WHO ARE YOU NOW?
