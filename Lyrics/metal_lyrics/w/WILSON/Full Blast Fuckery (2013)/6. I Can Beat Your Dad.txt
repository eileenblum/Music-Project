Take his statement, go get his pulse,
take his good name and make it yours.
Iâve read your books, and oh dear Lord, your father knows by now and youâre all mine.
No oneâs alone here, no oneâs alone.
Tear off a limb and bleed a new home.

Follow me down, donât say you wouldnât.
Youâre just as tragic as the worm you have born.
Mama say it sadly, now Mama say it low, âThereâs no blood like the blood of your ownâ
Are we in? Are we in?
When we were young we believed in our sins.
Like I could be the âoneâ
Yea, I will be his son.
Mama say Mama say âget out get outâ

Iâm shaking at your tree!
Your familyâs begging down on their knees!
Iâm tearing out your love.
I Can Beat Your Dad, I will be his son!

When we were young, when we were young
we just sinned to get along.

Get Young! Get Along! Donât say you wouldnât. Get Young! Get Along. Donât Say. Donât Say It.

Mama Say it Sadly, Mama Say It Low.

Iâm shaking at your tree!
Your familyâs begging down on their knees!
Iâm tearing out your love.
I Can Beat Your Dad, I will be his son!
I Can be your son! Donât say we wouldnât
I can be his son! Donât say we wouldnât
