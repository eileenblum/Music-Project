All I See is men who donât believe in anything!
This is another abolishment!
A man gone metaphor who chooses to believe weâll take the village back!
âOh, Lead us to the place where weâll finally bleed
Weâll make the killers sing..â

Take his mouth
(he will hold his tongue)
Cut him Down
(The monster meets his fate)
Send him Off
(Pariahs of the Wake)
Send Him Off
(Send him Off)
Weâll take his mouth
(he will hold his tongue)
Cut him Down
(The monster meets his fate)
Send him Off
(Pariahs of the Wake)
Face To Face
Surrounding Us All!

All I See is men who donât believe in anything!
Weâve come to play to take away
TAKE TAKE TAKE
Weâve come to play to take away
(bring back what we have lost)
Weâve come to prey and take away
I have seen the worst
Weâve come to play to take away
Well, I have seen..

Take his mouth
(he will hold his tongue)
Cut him Down
(The monster meets his fate)
Send him Off
(Pariahs of the Wake)
Send Him Off
(Set him Off)
Weâll take his mouth
(he will hold his tongue)
Cut him Down
(The monster meets his fate)
Send him Off
(Pariahs of the Wake)
Face To Face
Surrounding Us All!

Hey hey Hey
Câmon take his mouth
Hey Hey Hey
We Will Cut him Down
And send him off

Take his mouth
(he will hold his tongue)
Cut him Down
(The monster meets his fate)
Send him Off
(Pariahs of the Wake)
Send Him Off
(Send him Off)
Weâll take his mouth
(he will hold his tongue)
Cut him Down
(The monster meets his fate)
Send him Off
(Pariahs of the Wake)
Face To Face
Surrounding Us All!
