WHOA..... HERE IT GOES

WHEN I DIE, I WANNA STILL BE ME.
SCORNED, TORN AND BURNING DEEP.
A STUBBORN THORN IN SOCIETY
SCORNED, TORN, IâM BURNING

AND IF I DIED BEFORE I WOKE
I TOLD THE LORD THATâS MY SOUL TO TAKE
NOW IâM BURNING.

IF IâM GUNNA BREATHE
GET A GRIP FEEL MY HEART BEAT
ALL I NEED IS SPEED (WHOA OH WHOA OH)
FIRE BURNS INSIDE OF ME
ALL I SEE AND ALL I NEED IS PASSING ON THE LEFT OF ME
(WHOA OH OH WHOA OH)

WHOA, NOW IâM BURNING IN COLD SWEAT. I CANâT SLEEP.
IF IâM BURNING. MY HEARTâS SET. I NEED SPEED.
LETâS FACE IT WEâRE NOT BREATHING, CANâT MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME
BUT YOU, MY PASSENGER, HOLD TIGHT THEREâS GLORY ON THE LEFT OF ME.
GET A GRIP FEEL MY HEART BEAT

IF IâM GUNNA BREATHE
GET A GRIP FEEL MY HEART BEAT
ALL I NEED IS SPEED (WHOA OH WHOA OH)
FIRE BURNS INSIDE OF ME
ALL I SEE AND ALL I NEED IS PASSING ON THE LEFT OF ME
(WHOA OH OH WHOA OH)

WHOA, HEAR IT GO.

AND IF IâM GUNNA BREATHE (WHOA OH OH WHOA OH OH)
ALL I NEED IS SPEED (WHOA OH OH OH)
FIRE BURNS INSIDE OF ME
ALL I SEE AND ALL I NEED IS PASSING ON THE LEFT OF ME

(WHOA OH OH WHOA OH)
MY HEARTS SET, I NEED SPEED.
