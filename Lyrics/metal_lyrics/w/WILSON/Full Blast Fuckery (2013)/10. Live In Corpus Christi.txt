Sick of watching this go on.
Sinking one foot down the other off.
Oh my god, just choose a side and keep your steady strong, cause one of these days Iâll catch you off your guard.

Just honest, I swear,
one of these days you will wish we were there.
Back-bitter, I donât care. It was you with your hands in the air.
Ok get loud, get loud. Defense now.
You coward, your teeth, they shake when you speak.

Back-bitter, you stole, you swore there were secrets to keep.
Back-bitter, we knowâ¦.the grave is shallow,
we can see where you sleep.

One of these days everyone you know
will be gunning for you.
Every single face that you thought
you knew will be turning on you.
Weâre all laughing at you.

This was once your home. And these were your friends.
Who are you know? Where are they now?

You coward! You stole! You coward!
Back-bitter! You stole! You coward!

Where are they now? Where are they now?

One of these days everyone you know
will be gunning for you.
Every single face that you thought
you knew will be turning on you.
Weâre all laughing at you.
One of these days everyone you know
will be gunning for you.
Every single face that you thought
you knew will be turning on you.
Weâre all laughing at you.
