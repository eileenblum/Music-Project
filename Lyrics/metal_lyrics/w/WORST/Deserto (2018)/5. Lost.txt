I'm alone
I lie on the sand
Is me and myself
Need for this isolation
My mistakes have only driven me away from reality
Am I insane?
I know I'm not insane
But my actions only make me sure
That I'm lost in this fucking game

Now I feel my sorrow
Just have to face this nightmare

And find a shelter
In this desert

Lost in my desert
I heal my pains
Lost in my desert
I face my fears and throw them away

I cannot escape now
This is the truth that I always looked for
Nowhere to escape now

This is my ordeal
This my test
I'm armored to be able to see
What I wanted to forget

But I know is part of me

I'm armored to be able to feel
What I needed to regret
But I know this is real

Now I see the light
I was ripped I was tested
But I never lost the focus of this path

On my way in this storm
I look to the sky
What was destroyed yesterday
There is nothing left to leave behind
