Dawned again
My eyes are possessed
My soul is torn
Looking outside
I can't see anymore
My blood boils inside of me
The only remedy for me to deceive myself

The years go by and anger increases
Inside of me this anguish became a disease

You 'll never
You'll never
Will see the light again
The endless darkness is gonna be your fate
The endless pain
Remains the same

I like to see your suffering
You're a coward
I don't want you to live
I hear you cry
And watch you rot
I'll show you the way out

People like you don't deserve to live
The dirty work was assigned to me
I was chosen to do the dirty work
This is the monster that you've created
