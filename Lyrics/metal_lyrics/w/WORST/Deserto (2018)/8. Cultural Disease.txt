Herd effect
We try to do the right thing
But this system force us to cheat and lie to ourselves
Lie to ourselves

Contagious and degenerative
Cultural disease

This fucking country
This fucking laws
Created to benefit
The stake of society

They look on the side
There is only shit and betrayal
This is Brazil
Here you born to lose
And die in misery

How much is the price we pay?
We didn't ask to be born here
It's stuck in our souls

Is inside me
It's inside everyone
Cultural disease
