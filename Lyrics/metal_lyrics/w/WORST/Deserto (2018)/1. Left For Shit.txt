Inside
I have this feeling inside
Reject this feeling inside
I have this feeling inside

I despise you
I can't control myself
When I see you walking around
With a fucking smile
Acting like a role model
Unable to look in my eyes

But anyone see
The kid that you left behind
The mother that you left for shit
The family that you never helped

I just wish you to suffer
You fucking piece of shit

And I feel this hate
I breath this hate
I live this hate
Because I don't understand
Why a motherfucker like you
Is still alive

And he will hate you
For all his fucking life
