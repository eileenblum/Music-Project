I can't take it anymore
You're fucking draining me

You told me things
I'll never forgive
You used to be another person
But now I see
What we've become
A sickness of sorrow sadness and deception

I won't give you space
To destroy my life
I won't give you time
To tell more lies

We suffer for each other
It's making me insane
I'm like a mirror for you
'Cause we're all the same

Who are you to fucking judge me
When you're the one
Draining my energy
We almost killed each other last night
I won't give you space to destroy my life

After everything we've been through
This is the reason why I hate you
I won't be here waiting to cry
I turn my back away and say goodbye

Drain my energy
I won't t give you space to destroy my life
I won't give you time to tell more lies

I can't take it anymore
You're re fucking draining me
