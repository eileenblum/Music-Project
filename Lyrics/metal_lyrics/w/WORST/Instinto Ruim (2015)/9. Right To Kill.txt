Worst in english
For the first time
For all my hardcore brothers
Around the world
For you to understand
This muthafockin
Way of life

Here in Brazil
Its not like on tv
The lies they sell to you
Are the same shit we dont believe
The worms in power living like kings
We are ready to change
With blood bath on everything

We can't give up
Its a matter about our kids
Our dreams our families our beliefs
Corruption has no cure
Solution is to kill
To kill to kill

The only way for them to learn
Is the violent way
Politicians dont get better
Just depend on us
Im the chosen one
Give me my gun
i show you revolution
Give my right to kill
