In the old days one believed in Triesenberg when one went to church at midnight on new year's eve one could see all the deceased from the previous year
And then someone read their names and that person then was the next one to die
A curious man went at midnight of new year's eve into the church and hid up in the choir loft
Fifteen ghosts entered the church in succession and gathered around the pulpit
A living read their names but at the end he said you come too you who has hidden up in the organ
Pale as death the man snuck to the ghosts and suddenly everything disappeared when his wife wanted to wake him on new year's morning he laid dead in bed
