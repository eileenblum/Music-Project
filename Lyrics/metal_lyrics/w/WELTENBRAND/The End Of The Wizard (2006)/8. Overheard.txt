A farmer late at night left the tavern to go home
Then he saw the people of the night and heard them praying out loud curiously from behind a corner in order to see the ritual
Soon the procession moved ahead and as they passed where he was before
But because he knew that it's not good to come upon the group of ghosts he fled behind a house and stretched his head
They prayed only quietly and disappeared behind the next road curve
Only when in bed he recalled who had walked last in the line
The old woman who lived in the house in front of which he had seen the worshippers
When the farmer awoke in the morning his head was so swollen that he could not show himself among the people
The old lady however died four days later of a stroke
