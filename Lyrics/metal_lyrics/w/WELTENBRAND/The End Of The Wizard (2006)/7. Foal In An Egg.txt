Once a plankner climbed down from the height of his village into the valley
There he saw big pumpkins
Strange things for him which he had never seen before
Bewildered he asked the owner of this field what this was
These are horse eggs answered the farmer
The plankner requested to donate him one of them
Gladly the farmer gave him one of his horse eggs
Full of delight about his present the plankner climbed up again
Already half the way up he started to hatch the supposed egg but he wasn't careful enough
It slipped away and rolled down the hill
Frightened because of this a little rabbit jumped out of ab bush
The surprised breeder thought it was a young foal and shouted - now I'm father
