In the old days every person knew that the night ghost could be encountered frequently
This ghost asked a question
If you can solve it you are rescued
If not I'll put you under a spell and you have to die very soon
One night a man was on his ways when the night ghost asked him the question
To whom does the night belong
It does not belong to you nor me
It belongs to him to whom it is vital
And that was answered correctly and the man was free
