In the old days the mountain meadow Lida was a farmer's settlement belonging to the village of Balzers
Although the farmers could not use the land up there for much agriculture, they still enjoyed good times
On the lush alpine pastures grew a weed
The best feed for the cows that produced unearthly quantities of milk
Whenever they grazed on the zyprio the youngsters from lida often enjoyed themselves down in the village at a dance and just as it is today
The time for them passed much too fast
They had to return to milk the cattle because the overabundance of milk made this necessary
Then one day a young lad let escape the curse
Cursed and damned be the zyprio one has to leave a dance to go and milk as from the moment on the prosperity vanished
