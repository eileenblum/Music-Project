In former times many women from Triesenberg worked at the factory down in Triesen
One lady from Steinort had one day looked at the clock and thought that it was high time to go work
On her way she heard some muttering
She continued to walk then heard people pray and she suddenly was among the people of the night
It was impossible to emerge from the procession and she simply had to cross the street with them when the people of the night passed the church the daybreak bells rang
And suddenly she was once again alone on the road and it seemed to her as if the people of the night had disappeared at a slant through the ground
The next day a young girl from Steinort was dead
