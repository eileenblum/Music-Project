In Mauren lived a lumberjack who on a daily basis covered the long journey to the Maurer Berg to perform his hard work there
He entered into an allegiance with the devil who gave him a hazel twig
With this magic stick he could without any effort slide the heaviest timber down into the valley
One day the lumberjack was together with boys and girls preparing some corn
There was a knock at the window
One boy went outside and in front of the house stood a stranger who asked to speak with the woodcutter
He became very agitated and was afraid to leave the room
It knocked a second and third time and then he was gone
Inside one heard only a frightful scream
Nobody has since seen the ill-fated
A boot and a clump of hair was all that was found of him
