A farmer had misfortunes in his barn and he also could not produce any butter
Not for years
So then one day some gipsy's came and stayed at his farm overnight
Among them a woman who explained to the farmer you will not have any luck as long as your barn stands but there's a remedy
Dig where I will show you
The farmer dug under the barn door and found a tuft of different hair as big as an egg with a small bone from an innocent child hidden inside
The gipsy woman said she had to carry it to wherever it came from
Then she left and the farmer followed her
He saw that she went to the home of the woman whom he'd already suspected that she was inflicting his damage
