[Limited edition track]

Two neighbours got entangles in a fight because the one had expelled the other's child from her house
Soon thereafter the little one developed a spot over his nose and in fourteen days the whole skin and all hair were inflamed and the child suffered great pain
The doctor in Hirschensprung who always knew remedies in such cases gave powder and ointment ordered however that no one be allowed to visit the child during the next week as it will be that someone will come to inquire how he is doing and so it happened three times the neighbour came and three times she was turned away
The remedies helped and the child fully recovered
The father however went to Vaduz and reported the witch to the judges
