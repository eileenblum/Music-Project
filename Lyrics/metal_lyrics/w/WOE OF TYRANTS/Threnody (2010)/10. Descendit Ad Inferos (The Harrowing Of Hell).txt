Freefall into black chambers,
I can hear the weeping choir.
I land at the gate exhausted and pained.
He leaves me behind,
And I view through the open door the multitudes
Of those in eternal gloom.
I see their faces strained
In utmost fear staring into those fiery eyes.
How did he find me?
I look around in curiosity 'til
I see footprints in the sand,
Running next to a trail of tears.
He came to the gateway, taking my place.
Heard me crying desperation.
The screaming of demons inside
Of the fire unleash upon those that will house them.
Beasts turning vocal exploding the screams,
A battle that's already won.
But they will find that the brightest
Of fires cannot blot out the burn of the Son.
Aware of the efforts they pose being in vain,
Their anger explained. He appears in the doorway,
With something under His arm,
A bag overflowing with sacrifice
I could never fully comprehend.
No need to escape by my own strength,
As I am carried away. Flight towards the heavens,
With Venus in mind, strength of a second chance...
The screaming of demons inside of the fire unleash
Upon those that will house them.
Beasts turning vocal exploding the screams,
A battle that's already won.
But they will find that the brightest
Of fires cannot blot out the burn of the Son.
Aware of the efforts they pose being in vain,
Their anger explained...
I look in His eyes with tears in my own,
As He drops it in the ocean, never to be seen again.
