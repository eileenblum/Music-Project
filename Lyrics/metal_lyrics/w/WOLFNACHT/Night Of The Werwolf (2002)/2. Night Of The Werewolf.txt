Entering the woods in the night
Enslaved by the full moon's eerie light
He fell into the werewolf's madness
He vanished into the total darkness

Night Of The Werewolf
Night Of The Werewolf

Wandering through the foggy lands
With human blood upon his hands
Guardian of the forest gate
Bringer of death, terror and hate

Night Of The Werewolf
Night Of The Werewolf

Lurking behind the rotten trees
He felt the cold winter breeze
The morning light had struck him blind
He will return this night

Night Of The Werewolf
Night Of The Werewolf

Night Of The Werewolf
Night Of The Werewolf
