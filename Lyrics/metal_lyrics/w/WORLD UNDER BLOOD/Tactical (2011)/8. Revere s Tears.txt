George Revere has lost his life
He has no idea that he has died
They found the body with the eyes open wide

His medical breakthrough raised red flags
And let the healing cat out of the bag
Fixed in a stare no one knows that he's there
Committed to secrets he'll reveal to heal despair

Put these madmen in their place
Keep them quiet, simplify the human race
Dying is a business that cannot replaced

His medical breakthrough raised red flags
Just pack him and ship him out inside a black bag
Fixed in a stare no one knows that he's there
Committed to secrets he'll reveal to heal
At least the pain is over

Did you think they'd pray you'd slip away?
Utilizing inside skill murder was employed
When he was killed.

[Solo: Jaeger]

George Revere has been denied
The last request a moral to exemplify
Do not try to save their lives
