Maybe a work of fiction
And the friction that it's caused is sickening
The devil's dog and the evidence has no one thinking
A celebrity perhaps, at worst a novelty.

How can you speak his name with a straight face?
More than a passing phase
Less than reality
Commercial icon shoves the world into insanity
Prying eyes, dishing lies
Mainstream misleading franchise
Pay to praise his name with a straight face

Always credited for victory yet never for tragedy...

Greed feeds the grasp for fame
Narcissistic arrogant and vain
Everyone's a link in this idiotic chain
I cannot stand his name
I can't stand his name...

[Solo: Jaeger]

Greed feeds the grasp for fame
Narcissistic arrogant and vain
Everyone's a link in this idiotic chain
I cannot stand his name
