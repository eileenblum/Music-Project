Lights out
Before you even knew that
They discovered that your alibi is a lie
You come to within a room
Without a clue of what's inside
Silence then a scream
Fused to an artificial respiration machine

Upon the second floor paralyzed with blinded eyes
You cannot rid you of yourself or all of those surrounding you
Punishment they all say has fit the crime
Deep in your mind will be your former glory
In the purgatory dormitory

[Solo: Jaeger]

Anesthetic local removing cords of vocals cannot speak
Notice that your hearing's stifled
Extinguished explanations that you seek
Every nerve submerged in procaine
In every vein
Now you're just a brain

Upon the second floor paralyzed with blinded eyes
You cannot rid you of yourself or all of those surrounding you
Punishment they all say has fit the crime
Deep in your mind will be your former glory
In the purgatory dormitory

Laden with guilt and injected with shame
You don't know the names of these empowered saints you blame
Can't feel the cold, cannot feel the flames
Cannot feel the presence of your bodies weakened frame

[Solo: Jaeger]

Upon the second floor paralyzed with blinded eyes
You cannot rid you of yourself or all of those surrounding you
Punishment they all say has fit the crime
Deep in your mind will be your former glory
In the purgatory dormitory
