Drifting response, slow reaction
Conscious and comatose
Sleepwalking through every event
Injecting maximum dose
Transparent sickness
Visible rivers
The pale of flesh, the chill of sweat
Function depleting, agony leeching
Eroded figure in pain and... dead

Taking all blame, sense the shame
Dead and still in pain
A damned creation, dissimulation
Dead and still in pain
Blissful end, attempted again
Dead and still in pain
Sick of the same, taking the blame
Dead and still in pain!

My fleeting rapture, no emotion
Limited human abilities
Waving my hands in front of my face
Sight forever locked in stare....

[Solo: Miller]

Taking all blame, sense the shame
Dead and still in pain
A damned creation, dissimulation
Dead and still in pain
Blissful end, attempted again
Dead and still in pain
Sick of the same, taking the blame
Dead and still in pain!
