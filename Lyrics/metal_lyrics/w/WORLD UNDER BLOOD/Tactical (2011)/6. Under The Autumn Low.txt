Embrace the end of August
Counting down the hours
My pulse is racing to the freeze of the breeze
Always dreading Summer's conclusion
Into Autumn's intrusion
It begins the swelling of this twisted disease
Bone broken, glass smashed
Vein is open, skin's slashed
Exhausting all solutions to the highest degree
Chemicals collide, tainted inside
Awoken in the dark by the tremors consuming me
A poison chosen, polluting the essence to be
A temporary fix to mask the agony
Kill me at once, because that's what it wants
An anxiety increase beyond a person's belief
Panic stricken, body sickened
Razors deepen, red seeping
I utilize my being for inflicting battery

Under the Autumn low
Misery destroying the beauty of life
Under the Autumn low
Intuition deceived by the threat of homicide

Living in chains without the words to explain
Existing in the past where only memories remain
Focus unclear, a stagnant exercise in fear
Without an answer, gut reaction...the end is near

Under the Autumn low
Misery destroying the beauty of life
Under the Autumn low
Intuition deceived by the threat of homicide
Save me
