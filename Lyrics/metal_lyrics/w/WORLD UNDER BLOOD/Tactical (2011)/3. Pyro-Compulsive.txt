A supernatural threshold to pain
Will come to your defense
When appendages go up in flames
A strike of a match, the stench of kerosene all you remembered
Before your quarters and possessions hosted human ember
The seizures, the lust...
The blackouts kill your recollections
Scarring flesh feeds infection
Arson obsessive, pyro-compulsive
The singeing, the scorching,
The smoldering through third degree
Has been and will always be

Pyro-compulsive at high frequency
Self inducing blackening anatomy
Pleasure from pain and untold misery
Psychoanalysis the law demands release
Pyro-compulsive at high frequency
Psychoanalysis fire always sets them free

Consciousness is lost
While everything you own
Goes up in smoke
Dying ventilation,
Inhale the incinerating toke
Under the dermatome 
And placing graft on top of graft
Addicted for as long as it lasts
Just one more time before i pass
The seizures, the lust...
The blackouts kill your recollections
Scarring flesh feeds infection
Arson obsessive, pyro-compulsive
Burning fantasies in gasoline
As heat consumes your entity
Torch your own identity

Pyro-compulsive at high frequency
Self inducing blackening anatomy
Pleasure from pain and untold misery
Psychoanalysis the law demands release
Pyro-compulsive at high frequency
Psychoanalysis fire always sets them free

[Solo: Jaeger]

Burning fantasies in gasoline
As heat consumes your entity
Arson obsessive, pyro-compulsive

Pyro-compulsive at high frequency
Self inducing blackening anatomy
Pleasure from pain and untold misery
Psychoanalysis the law demands release
Pyro-compulsive at high frequency
Psychoanalysis fire always sets them free
