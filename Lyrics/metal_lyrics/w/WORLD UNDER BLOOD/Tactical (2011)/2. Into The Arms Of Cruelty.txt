There's no real way to make the best of the worst
We are sentenced at birth onto a prison we still call the earth
The pre-adolescent mind records
And stores all that they see, feel and hear
And the actions of adulthood at best are carried out in fear
A figure of neglect stands above the shape of innocence
Succumbs to insecurities and issues cruel punishment
Unqualified, yet socially identified as symbols of poverty
Entitled to our cognizance

You can burn in hell for knowing what you know
Projections of a bastard, reaping what you sow
Feeding the illusion, a child's faith erodes

A new soul, a blank face
An innocent expression already erased
A new soul into the arms of cruelty
A blank face into the arms of cruelty
An innocent expression into the arms of cruelty
Already erased

There's no real way to make the best of the worst
We are sentenced at birth onto a prison we still call the earth
Why can you ignore the warnings?
And how can you truly welcome the product of yourself
Into the arms of cruelty?

Feeding the illusion that you want them in your custody
The helpless child trusts the arms of cruelty

[Solo: Jaeger]

A new soul, a blank face
An innocent expression already erased
A new soul into the arms of cruelty
A blank face into the arms of cruelty
An innocent expression into the arms of cruelty
Already erased...
