To all the fallen...
Your goals will never be achieved
In light of what has happened...
Filthy vermin invading every right to believe
Your lavish order is now disorder...
In my dreams, or sick fantasies
Bodied bags, toes tagged
In delight of a nation growing sicker
A cheap imitation of life takes over
Thriving forward, absorbing yours and making it mine
Slowly forcing souls to my side

A god among the waste...you pray to get the story straight
A god among the waste, we should never have to live this way
A god among the waste
A highness to destroy this state.

To all forgotten...your strategy is received
But its not as you expected
You can't match my hatred
Evading every issue unseen
No common knowledge or fortitude in-between

[solo: Miller]

A god among the waste...you pray to get the story straight
A god among the waste, we should never have to live this way
A god among the waste
A highness to destroy this state.
