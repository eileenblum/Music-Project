FÃ© vÃ¦ldr frÃ¦'nda rÃ³gi;
fÃ³Ã°esk ulfr Ã­ skÃ³gi

RÃºnar munt Ã¾Ãº finna
ok rÃ¡Ã°na stafi,
mjÃ¶k stÃ³ra stafi,
mjÃ¶k stinna stafi,
er fÃ¡Ã°i fimbulÃ¾ulr
ok gerÃ°u ginnregin
ok reist hroftr rÃ¶gna.
[HÃ¡vamÃ¡l 142]

Ãr er af illu jarni;
oft leypr rÃ¦inn Ã¡ hjarni

Ãurs vÃ¦ldr kvenna kvillu;
kÃ¡tr vÃ¦rÃ°r fÃ¡r af illu

Ãss er flestra fÃ¦rÃ°a;
fÃ¶r, en skalpr er svÃ¦rÃ°a

Nam ek upp rÃºnar, Ã¦pandi nam...
[HÃ¡vamÃ¡l 139]

RÃ¦iÃ° kvÃ¦Ã°a rossom vÃ¦sta;
Reginn slÃ³ svÃ¦rÃ°et bÃ¦zta

Kaun er barna bolvan;
bol gorver mann folvan

Hagal er kaldastr korna;
Herjan skÃ³p hÃ¦imin forna

NauÃ° gerer nappa kosti;
naktan kÃ¦lr Ã­ frosti

Is kÃ¶llum brÃº brÃ¦iÃ°a;
blindan Ã¾arf at lÃ¦iÃ°a

Ãr er gumna gÃ³Ã°i;
get ek at Ã¶rr var FrÃ³Ã°i

SÃ³l er landa ljÃ³mi;
lÃºti ek aÃ° helgum dÃ³mi

TÃ½r er einhendr Ã¡sa;
oft vÃ¦rÃ°r smiÃ°r at blÃ¡sa

Bjarkan er laufgrÃ¦nstr lÃ­ma;
Loki bar flÃ¦'rÃ°ar tima

MaÃ°r er moldur auki;
mikill er grÃ¦ip Ã¡ hauki
Mikill er grÃ¦ip Ã¡ hauki...

Nam ek upp rÃºnar, Ã¦pandi nam...

Laukr er, er fÃ¦llr Ã³r fjalle;
foss en gull ero nosser

Ãr er vetrgrÃ¦nstr vÃ­Ã°a;
vant er, er brennr, at svÃ­Ã°a

[English translation:]

Wealth cause dispute among friends;
the wolf lives in the forest

Runes will you discover
And meaningful staves,
Very powerful staves,
Very strong staves,
That the wise high-storyteller gained
That the higher creative-powers crafted
That the Hroptr of Gods carved.
[HÃ¡vamÃ¡l 142]

Slag comes from bad iron; the reindeer often races over the frozen snow.

Giant causes women's sorrow;
few are cheerful from misfortune

River mouth is way of most journeys;
but the sheath is the one of swords

I took up the runes, crying aloud I took them...
[HÃ¡vamÃ¡l 139]

Riding, one says, is for horses the worst;
Regin forged the best sword

Ulcer is fatal for children;
death makes man pale

Hail is the coldest of grain;
Herjan shaped the world in olden times

Need leaves you little choice;
the naked freeze in the frost

Ice we call the broad bridge;
the blind man must be led

Good year is a blessing for men;
I say that Frodi was generous

Sun is light of the land
I bow before the holy

Tyr is one-handed among the Ãsir;
often the smith must blow

Birch is the limb greenest with leaves;
Loki brought success of deceit

Man is increase of soil;
mighty is the hawk's claw
Mighty is the hawk's claw...

I took up the runes, crying aloud I took them...

Water is what falls from the mountain;
but of gold are the jewels

Yew is the greenest tree in winter;
it often singes when it burns
