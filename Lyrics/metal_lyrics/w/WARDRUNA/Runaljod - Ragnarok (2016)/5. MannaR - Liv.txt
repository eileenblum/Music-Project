â¦Unz Ã¾rÃ­r kvÃ¡mu
Ã³r Ã¾vÃ­ liÃ°i
Ã¶flgir ok Ã¡stkir
Ã¦sir at hÃºsi,
fundu Ã¡ landi
lÃ­tt megandi
Ask ok Emblu
Ã¶rlÃ¶glausa

Ãnd Ã¾au nÃ© Ã¡ttu,
Ã³Ã° Ã¾au nÃ© hÃ¶fÃ°u,
lÃ¡ nÃ© lÃ¦ti
nÃ© litu gÃ³Ã°a;
Ã¶nd gaf ÃÃ°inn.
Ã³Ã° gaf HÃ¦nir,
lÃ¡ gaf LÃ³Ã°urr
ok litu gÃ³Ã°a

Eismall-sut og vervill
Tils eg rÃ¥ka deg
MaÃ°ur er manns gaman

[English translation:]

â¦Until three of the Ãsir
assembled there,
strong and benevolent,
came to the sea;
they found on the shore
two feeble trees.
Ask and Embla,
with no fixed fate

They had no breath,
they had no spirit,
neither warmth nor voice
nor fine complexion;
Odin gave them breath
Haenir gave them spirit
Lodur gave them warm life
and fine complexion

Sorrowed by solitude
and astray â until I met you
Man is man's joy
