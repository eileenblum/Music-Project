The desert mist
Inferno rise [Infernal rise; Infernal eyes]
The tyrants of oppressive life [No tolerance of oppressive life]

Grant us strength in this journey
Chaos my destiny
My palace of wisdom [My powers and wisdom]

Acting on minimal instinct
Gates of steel secure my fortress

Grant us strength in this journey
Chaos my destiny
My palace of wisdom

Swirling winds by moonlight
Cries of birdsong at dawn

Dreaming eyes of destiny
Storms of Northern winds
Eternal screams of twilight hope
Enchanted apparition seek eternal life

A restful sleep embodies me
Like hourglass sands
Clench [Glance] souls obscured[?]

Grant us strength in this journey
Chaos my destiny
My palace of wisdom
