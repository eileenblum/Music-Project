The place all frozen still [The glaze of frozen steel]
Upon the body laid still
Extracted by sorcery
Once there was a myth [Once temples of myth]

Rivers of fear run cold
Ice castle formation
Frozen tears escape eternal frost

Hope and desire fade
Fury in the emperor's eyes
Cast here for eternity
Season of the damned [dead]

Rivers of fear run cold
Ice castle formation
Frozen tears escape eternal frost

Forbidden land of sorrow
At last the winter winds sing
Scattered ashes of kings
Gaze at the fallen walls [fallen ones; fallen world]

Rivers of fear run cold
Ice castle formation
Frozen tears escape eternal frost
