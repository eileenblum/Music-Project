Tolling death bells of the hands of time [lands of time]
Numbing minds forced in thought
Unheard cries of whimpered breath
Penetrating steel
Illuminations fade

Sacrosanct of another life leaving me
Tombs gone rampant [not sure about this]
Abominate like plagues [not sure]
Of negative [magnitude]
Pointing comparability
Confirming unknown

Corrupted minds who act for self
Logic seeds born as life
Pods [plants] from the [something indecipherable] grown reliant
Unending quest for hope

Storms of hooded horsemen
[Something indecipherable] through dying eyes
The ashes blow - torrent winds
Unanswered cries, for darkness is near
