Take me out for the super future
Tellin' you man I'm a goin' ta use her
Let me go and I'll slide like rayon
Stuck with you and I'm stuck with nothin'

Take me out to the universe
Ya know ya can't stop me from lovin' you
Take my heart let the pieces fall in
The star bright sky and a piece of you

Check out baby she's a ridin' the missile
Fall out trigger crazy pull on the pistol
Last year happy just a rulin' the scene
Now they're blowin' their brains to pieces

Take me out to the universe
Ya know ya can't stop me from lovin' you
Take my heart let the pieces fall in
The star bright sky and a piece of you

Yeah man, you know I'm sick to death right now
Can't believe it
What the hell is wrong with you
All I believe in take the pretty pill
Man I'm ridin' the wave in

Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision

Take me out to the universe
You know I'm movin' too fast for the human racin'
No one sees me when I'm falling
Take my heart and a piece of you

Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision

Screens like mansions on concrete steeles
Break the will and ride the people
New gods give for you to heal
Too bad you will never feel
Get down - I wanna ride the wheel right now
And if you see me
Drop a line and help me out
Ridin' a vision
Take a look man for the new incision
Ride a vision you're on a mission
Crawl like a dog and beg for forgiveness
Take me out to the universe
You know I'm moving too fast for the human racin'
No one sees me when I'm falling
Take my heart and a piece of you
Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision
Television you got a vision
