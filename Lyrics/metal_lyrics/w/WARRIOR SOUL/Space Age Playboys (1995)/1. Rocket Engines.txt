Get down little scene mistrater
You love but ya can't believe her
Breeding the atomic freedom
Burnt out like a dead religion
There's no time for heaven

You got everything ya wanted
Now you're just a past performance

In the bedroom wasteland

Trip out on the fascination
Blast off to the moon to pray on
Winter freeze all forever
You want but she won't deliver

It's a bad love situation
Rocket engines love and Coca Cola
It's a bad love situation
Situation low

Get down like a plastic preacher
Your love's an elastic feature
Joy school for those who make it
You're like an abandoned baby

Corporate sin god lover
So what style you're naked
Place in time forever
Race the comet's trail

Beyond in the Avalon kingdom
Light rays come and kiss the mourners
Survive for the dead desire
Worship and design the fire

It's a bad love situation
Rocket engines love and Coca Cola
It's a bad love situation
Rocket engines love and coca cola

We don't need you
We believed you
We don't need you
You don't love me baby

Flash out of the lovers crying
Conscience in eternal blackout

Ceaseless is the dream of crashing
Backward to the call of screaming
Break off of the handle levers
Creaking to the horror subject
Message of the shorting shocker
Electric all matter bleeding

It's a bad love situation
Rocket engines love and Coca Cola
It's a bad love situation
Rocket engines love and Coca Cola
