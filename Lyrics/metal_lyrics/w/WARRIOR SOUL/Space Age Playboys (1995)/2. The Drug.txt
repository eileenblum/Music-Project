You wanna live forever inside the beauty crawl
You wanna sin together inside a bathroom stall
The line of fire blazin' into desire run
We're all a shakin' anticipating fun

It's so frightening
Carry a heavy load
Hits like lightning
That's just the way it goes

When love is a drug
Love drug
When love is a drug
Love drug
When love is a drug
Love drug

The walls start shakin', your heart goes boom boom
Your head is breakin' and time goes zoom zoom

It's time to get up and a start shakin'
Cause all the babies last seen were wakin'
Desire beautiful inside it zero
Cause mass appeal is our last hero
It's so frightening, carry a heavy load
Hits like lightning that's just the way it goes

When love is a drug
Love drug
When love is a drug
Love drug
When love is a drug
Love drug

The walls start shakin', your heart goes boom boom
Your head is breakin' and time goes zoom zoom

Mortal life is fun, kill fast die young
Super shine forever but you're not together

When love is a drug
Love drug
When love is a drug
Love drug
When love is a drug
Love drug
