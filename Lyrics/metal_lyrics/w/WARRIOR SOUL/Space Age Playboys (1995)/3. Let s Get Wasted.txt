I'm moving faster into your cold heart
This is a dream rock battered in rage
The sensation over dearranged
Your body is covered in vain
I'm a message, I'm a bastard
I'm a bitch with a ticket to love
You're a crashin' on the fashion
I'm lookin' up to supergod
You wanna die ya so what
No one cares if you're a suicide
You want everything but still not enough for you tonight
We're out trippin' the system
Cause a riot on a doomsday ride
Ray guns radic blastin' it's a fast lane fire fight

He's restricted
You're an explosion
Now you're addicted

Take a ride out into the sunshine
A breakin' laws cause it feels so good
I don't need it any martyr
Is just a jerkin' off four Holywood
All you eic stars I'm happy of you
Gee I wish I could be that good
We're not tired, I'm a blowd like the heart of the sun
Shooting skyward I don't leave until I have me some fun

Through the fallout all you people wanna kick me around
Eat your heart out I'm on target with the city sound
It's an explosion, bleed like lights rays
Dig the emission, you're looking for the superfun
A come on baby ya you get enough
I'm coming back in for some satisfaction
And you're looking like the main attraction
You're on fire a little baby with your head kicked in
We desire another world devoted sin

Let's get high get wasted
Let's get high get wasted
Let's get high get wasted
I want fun and I'll make it
Let's get high get wasted
Ya the pigs can't take it

Let's get high get wasted
Let's get high get wasted
Let's get high get wasted
Let's get high get wasted

We're having fun now, we're not supposed to
Isn't it lovely, I'm a telling ya it's chronic, you're a tragic hipaholic
I'm a giving all I can girl, now it's time for me ta show ya
You wanna die ya so what, no one cares if you're a suicide
You want every thing still, not enough for you tonight
You're trippin' on the system cause a riot on a doomsday ride
Ray guns radic blastin' you're a hit at the fire fight

Let's get high get wasted
Let's get high get wasted
Let's get high get wasted
Let's get high get wasted
