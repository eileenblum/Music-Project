We're in love
We're in love
We're in love
We're in love with ourselves

You love the pretty faces
You put your burnin' faith in
We live in the coke culture
Advertised faith is our future
Saturate until ya blitz out
Candidate for a teenage breakdown
Makin' love on a one way jet ride
Engines on and we're ready to fly

We're in love
We're in love
We're in love
We're in love with ourselves

I feel you comin' away comin' away ya
I want to believe again believe again

We're in love
We're in love
We're in love
We're in love with ourselves

It's not reality man
Just because we're American man
You think we're goin' somewhere
Well we've already been there
Load the ships we're ready to go go
Get the brain for the sonic blow blow
Get shot with a plastic gun
C'mon man we're just having some fun

We're in love

We reject t. v. screen
We reject t. v. screen

It's not reality, man
It's not reality, man
It's not reality, man
It's not reality, man
It's not reality, man

We're in love

You love the pretty faces
You put your burnin' faith in
We live in the coke culture
Advertised faith is our future
Saturate until ya blitz out
Candidate for a teenage breakdown
Makin' love on a one way jet ride
Engines on and we're ready to fly

We're in love
We're in love
We're in love
We're in love with ourselves
