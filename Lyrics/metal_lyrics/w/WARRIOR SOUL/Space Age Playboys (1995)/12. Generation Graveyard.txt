Bombs away - for the nation
Bombs away - into the graveyard
Bombs away - our generation
Bombs away - another graveyard

We're a bad generation
We're the talk of the nation
We don't care about nothing
Now I'll tell you something
As our lives get cheaper
The violence gets deeper
We all die in dreamland
Fly American

The protected do what they're told
The rejected searchin' for their souls
The reflection looks like you
Break the mirror down 'cause we don't want to

Bombs away - for the nation
Bombs away - into the graveyard
Bombs away - our generation
Bombs away - another graveyard

Save room for us
We're a bad generation
We are born ans wasted
Our lives are space ships
Through skies we're blastin
'We ride on rockets
We thrive on profits
We don't care about you man
Nova scene from the heartland
Blown away

Bombs away - for the nation
Bombs away - into the graveyard
Bombs away - our generation
Bombs away - another graveyard

Save room for us
We don't care about nothin'
We are bored and wretched
Time is gone ya so what
We all die ya sometime
Just be calm it'll pan about
Come on man we're a phase out
When they took the future
They took our future
I'm OK

Bombs away - for the nation
Bombs away - into the graveyard
Bombs away - our generation
Bombs away - another graveyard

Save room for us
