You want to tell me now
How it's so beautiful
If you can't make it fun
I call it pitiful
All of the little boys
Chase little girls down
I just want to ride
The earth around the sun

We're the people that are fightin' the wars
We're the people that are fightin' the wars
We're the people that are fightin' the wars
Not everything that glitters is gold
We're the people that are fightin' the wars

You want to tell me now
How it's so beautiful
If you can't make it fun
I call it pitiful
All of the little boys
Chase little girls down
I just want to ride
The earth around the sun

We're the people that are fightin' the wars
We're the people that are fightin' the wars
We're the people that don't count anymore
We're the people that are fightin' the wars

We're the bottom of the human well
We bleed and scream like hell
We're the ones they are kickin' down
We're the ones they don't want around
You want to tell me now
How it's so beautiful

We're the people that are fightin' the wars
We're the people they don't need anymore
We're the bottom of the human well
We bleed and scream like hell
We're the people that are fightin' the wars
We're the ones that don't count anymore
We're the ones they are kickin' down
We're the ones they don't want around
We're the people that are fightin' the wars
We're the people that are fightin' the wars
