We come through the windows Webust down the door
We cut through the ceilings And pop up on the floor

The children are angry And they come pouring in
We're searching for justice From our goverments

In every face in this place I see trouble
In every face in this place I see trouble

Let's rumble

We tear down the paintings We tear down the sculpture
You call it destriction Yeah, but that's what ya taught us

Busted dreamland The country roots
This is your payback For three trillion bucks

In every face in this place I see trouble
In every face in this plkace I see trouble

If any pigs outside Do not hide we will rumble
In ever face in this place I see trouble

Let's rumble

Superpower dreamland [x8]
It's a superpower dreamland You're livin'in a dreamland
A superpower dreamland A superpower dreamland
