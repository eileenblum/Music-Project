Have you ever wanted To be someone you're not
But you look into the world And you see what you've got

There's nothin' there But brains and guts
Finally open the door And then it shuts

Look to the center And i'll think you'll find
The people that are gettin' They are blind

You changed the channel And there's nothin' there
You weren't born pretty And it isn't fair...

Here's to the losers
The substance abusers
To the rejects
All the imperfects

'Cause i think we're beatiful
'Cause i think we're beautiful
'Cause i think we're beautiful
No matter what anyone says
I think we're beautiful
The most beautiful in the world

You try for jobs But they say you're strange
You're sportin' a style That they call pain

So you get in trouble And your brain is gone
You're cryin' out man But the words are wrong

Here's to the losers
The substance abusers
To the rejects
All the imperfects

'Cause i think we're beautiful
'Cause i think we're beautiful
'Cause i think we're beautiful
No matter what anyone says
I think we're beautiful
The most beautiful in the world

I know you're tierd Of being put down
And all the crap that's said in town
But you're a person thatmatters most
I raise my glass, And make a toast

Here's to the losers
Substance abusers
To the rejects
All the imperfects
To the retarded
And the broken-hearted
To the starving masses
And the lower classes

'Cause i think we're beautiful
'Cause i think we're beautiful
'Cause i think we're beautiful
No matter what anyone says
I Think we're beautiful
