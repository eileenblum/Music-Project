The cash flows out The drugsroll in
The nation rage While the children sin

Officials addicted to dough The bankers grin
But we all know They can't stop it
'Cause they're linin' their pockets

We're blown away in the U.S.A.
We're blown away every single day

They can't stop it 'Cause they are buyin'
Their rockets

We're blown away in the U.S.A.
Overseas They love our green
Keep us happy With your little machines
We live on credit We live on dope
Ther's no promises When you're livin' on hope
We're blown away in the U.S.A.
We're blown away every single day
Kiss the sunshine
