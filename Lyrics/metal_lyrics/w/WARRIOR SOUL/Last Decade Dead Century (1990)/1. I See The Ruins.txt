I am the child of the new generation The product of total frustation
Lost in the void of social soup Yesterday's plans went away
I saw ya standing there cold So i picked up on the usual topic
I feel the pain of athousand wars I got no problems man
I got no problems man I got no problems man
I live in TV land I'm an electronic image
Beamin' out to you

I see the ruins I know we are losin'
We love our weapons Blown into heaven

We're out of time We're out of mind
Completely blind to nature's sign And we got nothing

Wasted in prison A bad decision
You run to nowhere You're blown forever

We stand confused On hard times
Can't break away From our crimes
This is the world You have no choice
Now you're gone

We play the fools We break the rules
We rape the earth,a blinded purge And we got nothing

Hate is a fire It does not fire
You run to nowhere You're blown forever

We stand confused On hard times
Can't break away From our crimes
This is the world You have no chioce
Now you're gone

We stand confused On hard times
Can't break away From our crimes
This is the world You have no choice
Now you're gone

I see the ruins I know we're losin'
We walk the wasteland Stripped down from God's hand
We live confused Completely used
I love you Wasted
