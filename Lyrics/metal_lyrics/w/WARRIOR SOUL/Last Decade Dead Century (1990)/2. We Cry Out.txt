People hear what i say Childnation she's blown away
Bravery is our distinction Goodbye rock generation Goodbye

Become one and you know We will live through the show
When our world is dead Questions rock your head
When all boundaries die, Lord all men realize

We cry out
Rock culture
We cry out
Rock culture
(And the words of truth got by)

War child Baby we lived hard
Finally know how strong we are Oh, yeah

Dying leaders You can stay at home
Our new culture Stands on it's own
On our own

Become one and you know We will live through the show
When our world is dead Questions rock your head
When all boundaries die, Lord all men realize

We cry out
Rock culture
(Can you hear me)
We cry out
Rock culture
(And i know we're out there
We cry out
Rock culture
We cry out
Your future
We cry out
Rock cult
Rock cult
Rock cult
Rock culture
