In conclusion Say a prayer forus
We must say goodbye If we meet again
Please remember Why we say goodnight

Take good care now All earth's children
Learn from wisdom's cry

Hear the unspoken
See without sight
Learn yourself inside

Goverments hide behind religion
Kids like us get thrown in prison
We come to We come to
We come to conclusion [repeat]
In conclusion Please be wary
Where authority reigns Control tightens
As we sleep A false security

All our leaders Answer to silent bosses
Where profit fills their greed

Think before action Learn before acceptance
Decide what you should be

Media children pacified Crosses stand where the dead man died
Goverments hide behind religion Kids like us get thrown in prison

We come to We come to
We come to conclusion [repeat three times]

Say a prayer for us That we don't lose our way
While freedom lies there dying
We are there to hold it's hand

Take all the children holy To the river of dead
Make them drink it's waters Lonely so they can learn what we had
