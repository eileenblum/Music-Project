Go to sleep In my arms
A soul to keep From all harm

I lie awake In a crystal calm
Your face so sweet til The end of time
A lullaby Makes you feel better
The world's all but died But we're together

A lullaby Makes you fell better
The hatred outside, really doesn't matter...

Go to sleep my baby
Go to sleep right next to me

You found the way From what you've lost
The pain is great As you pay the cost

A lullaby Makes you feel better
The worlds all but died But we're together

A lullaby Makes you feel better
The hatred outside, really doesn't matter

It doesn't matter [9x]
