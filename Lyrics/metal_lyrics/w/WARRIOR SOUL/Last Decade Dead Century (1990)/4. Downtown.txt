I've been out all night thinking got in a fight
There's a hole in my arm My bitch is alarmed

I was at the bar Where i'm a superstar
Livin' on free drinks Hey man, your band stinks

That's the way we live Downtown
Our feet never hit the
Ground
Ground
Ground
Ground yeah!

' Cause i hate my mother
I hate the world
I told my father
Some more bull
I hate the system
And i break the law
But i'm at home
When i'm Downtown

It's saturday night My boy's are wound up tight
Slip on a skin Put the sucker in
5 Minutes to go Ya got a Marlboro
Bust in some joint Maybe find some points

That's the way we live Downtown
Our feet never hit the
Ground
Ground
Ground
Ground, yeah!

'Cause i hate my mother I hate the world
I told my father Some more bull
I hate the system And i break the law
But i'm at home When i'm Downtown

I came i conquered- Escaped the the slaughter
I live undaunted

Let me take you with me I think you'll dig the scene
'Cause

Ya hate your mother
Ya hate the world
Ya told your father
Some more bull
You hate the system And break the law
But i'm at home when i'm Downtown

That's the way we live-Downtown
I'll be seein' ya around
Round
Round
Round, yeah!

'Cause i hate my mother I hate the world
I told my father some more bull
I hate the system And i break the law
But i'm at home when i'm
Downtown [9x]
