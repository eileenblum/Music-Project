In Detroit, There's a manHe's in charge of the action
Put a gun, in your face And he gets a reaction
Has a beeper, and a car I was his driver
Runnin' drugs across the country I was the survivor
I'm innocent, of anything I'm innocent, but he's coming
Charlie's out of prison
Charlie's out of prison
Charlie's out of prison

In Detroit, they make guns Lotsa cars, lotsa criminals
You get big, you get hard But you don't get to successful
Small time world, small time racket Push yourself to the brink
Just to sell another packet

I'm innocent, of anything I'm innocent, but he's coming

Charlie's out of prison 3 XBroke doors, broke windows Brokenreasons of my mind
Weakened by, desperation The seduction of crime

Meaning of daeth, means nothing, When you need to survive
Caught beliving, in my life, A flash in eternal time

Yeah Yeah!
Charlie's out of prison
