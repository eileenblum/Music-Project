No more pain I'm almost there
I'm a cellophane pioneer

I'm ridin' hard I'm takin' off
You look so pretty when you're near

M.D.M.A.
Trippin' on ecstacy
Trippin' on ecstacy
Now i'm free

My planet's dead And i'm the king
I'm in love with everything I'm losing weight
My mind's a wreck But i'm in touch with my feelings

M.D.M.A.
Trippin' on ecstacy
Trippin' on ecstacy
I'm trippin' on ecstacy
I'm trippin' on ecstacy
Now i'm free No one can catch me

Look at me again I can see again
Look at me agin I can see agin

Hit the motherlode Drop two more hits
I'm on a power drive

I don't get sick I can touch the sky
No one know's i'm alive

M.O.M.A.
Trippin' on ecstacy
Trippin' on ecstacy
I'm trippin on ecstacy
I'm trippin' on ecstacy
Now i'm free

Look at me agin I can see again
I'm out there again man
