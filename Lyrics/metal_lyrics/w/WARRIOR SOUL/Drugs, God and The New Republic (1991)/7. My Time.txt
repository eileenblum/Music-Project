violence killin' my world silence from all the girls
fired....the boss is a prick tired....the nation is sick

I'm exploding yeah I'm rejoicing 'cause

this is my time medecine on line
plastic sunshine the pleasure's all mine

hated 'cause I love rock'n roll bankers love the money they stole
gassed out on yesterdays dream no one brother is blowin' my scene

I'm exploding yeah I'm rejoicing 'cause

this is my time medecine on line
plastic sunshine my time, get down
