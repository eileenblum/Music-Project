my power got the cut off I can't afford a phone
but you know that I'm electric when I go out alone

you're comin' on like nitrous you're loaded to the bone
you're looking like a princess and now i'm sliding home

my eyeballs are burnin' I got a head rash
once I blast off you know I'm burnin' all my gas
'cause I'm a rocket rocket 88
'cause I'm a rocket rocket 88
livin' in the city the city is my home
ya know i dig the chickness ya know i like to bone

'cause I'm a rocket rocket 88
'cause I'm a rocket rocket 88
