needle boys in the park rotten cops after dark
politicians underground no light can be found
all the pimps all the whores all demented religious wars
evangelist so corrupt arm out palm up

jump for joy oh jump for joy
worlds end
jump for joy oh jump for joy
worlds end

all the oil that you pump my world's a garbage dump
land developed by the pigs you consume everything
bronze iron turn to steel eat your plastic at every meal
drink the water then you choke your bank account you're broke

jump for joy oh jump for joy
worlds end
jump for joy oh jump for joy
worlds end

populations multiply there are holes in the sky
tv man shit on you you love to be screwed
packaging maniac guarenteed money back
a no-money superstar the u.s. on credit cards

jump for joy oh jump for joy
worlds end
jump for joy oh jump for joy
worlds end

silence descends as i walk astray god please keep me straight for just one more day
times are bad I hurt what can I do I just need some time alone with you

here we are back again we have come to the end
no use for you to cry
