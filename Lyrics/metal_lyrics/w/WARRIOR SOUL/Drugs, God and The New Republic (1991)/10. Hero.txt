hey, hey boys won't you hold the line we'we been down here a long, long time
big wheels turning and I don't know why I stand here to defy

hey, hey boys bravery on my mind my head's been splittin' from this 9 to 5
when the grind knocks me into my feet these are the words that I repeat, now
I'll be a hero in my own time
I'll be a hero in my own time
if I stand I know I'll shine
I'll be a hero in own time, in my own time

hey, hey boys workin' on the line we work metal to survive
but day to day pressure on my soul i have to scream when it's out of control, now

I'll be a hero in own time
I'll be a hero in my own time
if I stand I'll shine
a hero in my own time, in my own time

hey, hey boys hear the wistle blow a hard day's done and it's time for you go
as i walk out to the street crack a beer and my mind repeats, now

I'll be a hero in my own time
I'll be a ero in my own time
if I stand I know I'll shine
I'll be a hero in my own time, in my own time

I'll be a hero in my own time
I'll be a hero in my own time
I'll be a hero I'll be a hero
I'll be a hero I'll be a hero in my own time
