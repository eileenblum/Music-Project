this fight's for you and me in the land of the free
the rock minority against hypocrisy
they crucify our words but they don't understand
we wan't a better world and a share of our land

they point at us but we're their children
we fight because they thaught us to be free

the land where our fathers died the land of the pilgrims pride
forced us to decide if we stand or if we hide

belive in me we'll fight forever
until we're free
we'll fight together oh , ya come on down
children of the winter walk into the springtime

the fathers fought a revolution a fight for what we belive in
our rights sown there's no confusion
I don't need to be forgiven to be forgiven

the land where our fathers died the land of the pilgrims pride
my hatred I can't hide I'll kill before they take my rights

come walk with me we'll go to heaven
the world will be our dream toghter
come take my hand rejoice forever
the promised land if we remember

children of the winter
walk into the springtime
