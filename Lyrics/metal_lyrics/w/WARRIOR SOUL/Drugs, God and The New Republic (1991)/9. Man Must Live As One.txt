coming down 2000 years elements deep inside me
eternal man conflict finds the tears wars opposite is understanding

man must live , live as one
man must live , live as one
the humans war has just begun
man must live , live as one

boundaries change and boundaries kill the dead in fields allaround me
defied heroes in the hills told me they died to let us live free

man must live , live as one
man must live , live as one
the human war has just begun
man must live , live as one

people run from a world in danger many consumed by their fear and anger
say a prayer for all our nations that we will live through our confrontations

man must live , live as one
man must live , live as one
the human war has just begun
man must live , live as one

man must live , live as one
man must live , live as one
the human war has just begun
man must live , live as one

man must live as one
