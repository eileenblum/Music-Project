I don't need your big money I don't need your girls
I don't need your rules and thats cool

to succeed I won't whore
if you wan't to rock I give you more

'cause i'm the real thing come on down,and get the real thing
I'm the real thing come on down and get the real thing

I push the law and push the mind our government well I like to criticize
you shot me down but yet I survived never got nothing in thislife
without a fight and that's right

push me down 'cause i wan't the truth
I'll keep on hittin' till I get through

'cause I'm the real thing come on down and get the rael thing
'cause I'm the real thing come on down and get the real thing
I'm the real thing ya come on down
I'm the real thing ya better come on down
