population psych-out someone feed em flies and death and sex to hide their dead world
softly singing through memories of truth killing is our buisniess
cash for the cruel

drugs,god and the new republic
drugs,god and the new repiblic

boards use capital gains lie on on our goverments trust
to pay off corporate mistakes statues of lincoln cry disciples
eternal now I'm dead let the frequency phase out

drugs,god and the new republic
drugs,god and the new republic
drugs,god and the new republic
drugs,god and the new republic

cosmic fire dropouts gasoline injectors sonic prophets screaming right on
standing at the crossroads showered in cast stones the truth willbe known
as we kick the king right off his throne

I'm the anti , anti king I'm the anti , anti king
I'm the anti , anti king I'm the anti , anti king
