plastic leaders seem like insects tortured cities lost beyond
pleasure films of landscape dirt on royal gowns

the man said to cop religion alls I wan't is peace
he said this was the land of freedom but it's not for free

but I found the answers
but I found the answers

yeah to the problems they're in my head man destroy the system

heavy metal fire fading lost again until the dawn
psychedelic friction healing statues carved from gods

searching for our true belivers please count me as one
but you know I can't be your saviour 'cause I need my own

but I found the answers
but I found the answers

yeah to the problems they're in my head man kill the administration

heavy metal fire fading lost again until the dawn
little sister she's been saying plastic prayers to god

heavy metal fire fading lost again until the dawn
little sister she's been saying plastic prayers to god

find the answers yeah to your problems
find the answers yeah to your problems
I've laid down lord
I've laid down lord
visualizing a cool breeze demolition and sacred fevers
on rivers weeping insanity builders of cities destroyers of
worlds kings of extinction I am no longer yours
