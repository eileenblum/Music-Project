I'm so gentle
Gentle and Cute
Don't want to hurt ya
But I got the noose

The painting is running
Picasso is dead
Your Pollack is dry now
While expression turns red

Let Me Go

Lords of Expression comin' after you
We're workin' Chill Pill, Its just what we do
Got no time for jerkin', I got no time to chat
Pay ya back in full when I'm breakin' the bank

Comin' to ya hard like you know I would
Challenging the mind I think we're understood
Psychedelic music for the New York Age
This time brother, hear what I got to say

Let Me Go
