Inside, Inside my mind

Feelings thought evolution left behind
Look out at the shattered weeping billions
Destroyers of your own civilization

Look out at the dead outside my window

In the hard land of the inner city winter
The dying, their empty fingers wave
While riding a world they cannot save

Love the dying

Species slowly disappear
For the canyons of the concrete frontiers
All races of the suicidal species
Drawn faces shine, smile at their babies

Love the dying
Burnt, stoned, crying
