Please reach off this tarnished hour
Drink peace again only for my own
Brave season lost in love
The brilliant branches touching all
Warm branches touch bodies cold

We lie clutching our human toil
Thee Prey of Love, stands in fertile soil.

Come, oh please oblige me
I will show you what pain will cost
Come see what riches could blind me
And I'll show you what we have lost

Scattered across the western lands
Flickering, the light lost gone
The fury of the whispers calls so hard
The scenes destroying your heart

Come comfort your heart
Come comfort your heart
Come comfort your heart
The coffin, your heart

The Truth is Simple and Soft
