Inside Passions lie
My only feeling tears
When the body died
I felt that no one cared
The crime now is now
The pigs just pulled away
The truth all forgotten
Is tomorrow's loud reply

Why I live on
In my darkest doom
The sky awoke the sun
But the light escaped the womb
My work gently dies
The man asks for the fare
Tomorrow's loud reply
My only feeling tears

God Bless America

The slaughter lingers on
I fill my heart with sand
The dreams come with boredom
Of what I could of had
Your cities golden paved
Or so I've heard um say
As long as you eat it
They say made the grade.....

I'm from Mars, mom. I'm from Mars, mom. I'm from.....
