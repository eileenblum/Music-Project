Inside Passions lie
My only feeling tears
When the body died
I felt like no one cared
The crime now is now
The pigs just pulled away
The truth is all forgotten
Is tomorrow's loud reply

Why I Live on
In my darkest doom
The sky awoke the sun
But the light escaped the womb
Well I get by
With what I can
I took to the light
That's in my hand

If I ran the world
Tell you what I'd say
All religions for one God
Now put your guns away

The slaughter lingers on
As I fill my heart with sand
The dreams, they come from boredom
Of what I could of had
Your cities paved
Or so I've heard um say
As long as you eat it
They say you made the grade

I'll take the High Road
If you take the Low
And I'll take the Low Road
If ya give me some Hope

I'll take the High Road
If you take the Low
And I'll take the Low Road
If ya give me some Dough

Well I get by
With what I can
I took to the light
That's in my hand

If I ran the World
I tell ya what I'd do
I'd make it a Kingdom
For me and you.......
