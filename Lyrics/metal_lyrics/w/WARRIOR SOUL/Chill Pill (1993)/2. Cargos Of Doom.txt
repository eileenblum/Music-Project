Oh, shattered sky ya my life
The sea of faces just keeps marching on
Oh, never die
I feed from marshes, bushes
Hard concrete marsh.
Oh, come away, come away
This art calls in the passionate heart

Ah, summer days the daze slip away
Like our father's souls depart

Criminals kiss and hands are one
Behind false flags are the drugs and guns
Evolution shines like Pollack Paint chips
Fall touching Golden Tongues

Ah, the demon cries from spaces hard to know
Far into darkness time walks naked into Godless Tombs

No weeping for the Godless Heart
Shield the temper of your exploding God
Rip away screams like torture

Fake the dance, for the ceremonies love...
Fake the dance, for the ceremonies love...
Fake the dance, for the ceremonies love...
Fake the dance, for the ceremonies love

Star gazing into pedestrian painted
Red bald erection his crown
Art phasing, silent wind this direction blown
Crimes of conscience all paid in full

The ships great masts conceal, Cargos of Doom...
Cargos of Doom
Cargos of Doom
