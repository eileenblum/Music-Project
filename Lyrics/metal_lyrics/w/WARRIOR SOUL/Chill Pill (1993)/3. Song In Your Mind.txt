I've seen it all before
Turn your life in for gold
It reaches down to my soul
The taste of dust and devil

This is the sign of my time
The sound of children marchin'
Tomorrow's Dream Forgotten
All my Dreams Forgotten

An empty sky looks at me
This long course forgiven
All I wanted to be
Like autumn leaves all falling, falling downward

This is the song in your mind
Never forget what you've done
In this twilight time together
In the lonely place we've come to
When I'm gone please remember
I only wanted to be with you

This is the song in your mind
Never forget what you've done.
