She don't care, she don't care about you
She's a tough little bitch-a
She can rock til the night goes down
And you can never rich her
You can feel
Yeah everyone does
But you're just a picture
Of a lost child inside
Decaying in the mirror

Come on be polite
You're just her little parasite
She's the queen
You want love
But she won't give you nothing bro

Junky stripper
You're my love
Junky stripper

You see her face
Yeah all over the place
You know you'd like to unzip her
It turns you into a mental case
Until you hit the liquor
Spinning on a silver pole
Into the vortex that heaven owns

Come on be polite
Try not to be her little parasite
She rocks you hard in every way
Now it's time for you to pay...
Lay your money down

Junky stripper
The girl's no good
Junky stripper
You're my love
