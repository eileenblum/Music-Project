[Written by Kory Clarke]

As we light all our bonfires
Our faces glowing red
As we plot all our desires
to end corporate government
and the big bad pigs who own us
in soon their graves they'll lay
Like the Nazi scum before them
Their bodies reek as we hang them high

Light your bonfires
Let freedom reign
Light your bonfires
Rebellion is on the way
Light your Bonfires
Make the Empires shake
Light your bonfires

America had a constitution
a constitution fair and brave
but they tore down their towers
so they can make you their slaves
Please listen all religious people
And hear your hearts this day
Don't listen to the false prophets
Light your fires to find the way

Light your bonfires
Rebellion's on the way
Light your bonfires
And make the Empires shake
Light your bonfires
Let Freedom reign
Light your Bonfires
It's Guy Fawke's Day!

Now all the saints that came before us
And the ghost of Cromwell
Did they drive the snakes before us
or did they leave us all in hell?
And all the armies of Napoleon
And all of Hitler's dungeon cells
Have you had enough of despots?
Inside yourself your kingdom dwells

Light your bonfires
Let freedom reign
Light your bonfires
Rebellion's on the way
Light your bonfires
Let the Empires shake
Light your bonfires
it's Guy Fawke's Day

As we stand around out bonfires
Our faces glowing red
As we plot our heart's desires
to end corporate government
and the big bad pigs who own us
in soon their graves they'll lay
Like the Nazi scum before them
Their bodies swing as we hang them high

Light your bonfires
Let freedom reign
Light your bonfires
Rebellion's on the way
Light your bonfires
Make the Empires shake
Light your bonfires
it's Guy Fawke's Day

It's Guy Fawk's Day!
Light your Bonfires
