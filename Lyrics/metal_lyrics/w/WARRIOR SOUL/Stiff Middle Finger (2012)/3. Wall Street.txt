She sifts through her diamonds
Like grains of sand
She don't have no favorites
They all look the same
Slip on a sense of security
Her jet black dress accents beautifully
Looks in the mirror,
can't see what she used to see
Only lonely eyes that search for apologies

Insane as it seems
Yeah it's hard to believe
Living on easy street from your richness
Of your list and greed

No more easy street for the rich bitch
Starving selfishly
No more easy street
While the rich bitch
About what they need

No second chances
Yeah you used to say
Living on the edge
Yeah it's hard to take
Never gave to poverty
No second chances for you and me

[Chorus]

That same old feeling is seeping in
Darkness into daybreak into night again
I saw you swinging from the chandelier
That is why you came back here

You let money be your only friend
Conventions logic with a spin
Easy to forget when you pretend
Never to live these lies again

[Chorus]
