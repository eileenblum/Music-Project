[3x]
Freedom
Occupy
Fight on
Right on

Days are hard
Nights are cold
Your head's busted by a billy club
Caesars guards are cracking down
Electric whip, taser sonic sounds
They make arrests but we fight on
Taking back the worlds hollow ground
International rebellion
City to city
Town to town

Lord knows what we will pay
Like rolling Dallas in a motorcade

[2x]
Occupy
Occupy
Freedom

Occupy had just begun

Pay the pigs to infiltrate
Challenge the corporate power state
Demand the tariffs to be raised
On products built by labor slaves

Hold steady don't give way
When the police come to play
Stand and fight
For the truth
Occupy for me and you

[Chorus]
