It's 2012, it's 2012

So what are they spraying up in your sky?
Can you see the crosses
look up and deny
I'm sure it ain't good for us
yeah nothing they do
is ever good for us
look, we just got screwed

It's 2012, 2012
It's 2012, 2012

They scan your eyeballs, squeeze your nuts
body, x-ray scan, put your d*ck in their vice
airport security douchbag c*nts
would like to meet you outside on the street f*cker
and kick your ass

it's 2012, 2012, it's 2012

Your bullshit prime ministers,
and your ass kissing presidents
as they destroy the world
for their shadow governments
which consists of bankers
and wall street slime
credit card debt makers
and phone companies
insurance scumbags
pharmaceutical wankers
bloated oil boys
yeah septic tankers
let's bring them to justice
and treat the fair
unlike what they do to us
while our families
are in despair

it's 2012, 2012, it's 2012, 2012

if you're looking for someone
to cast blame
look in the mirror
and the Nazis and Budweiser
Lloyds of London, Barclays and Ford
GM, Nixon and the devil worshippers
Bank of America
and the Saudi C*nts
Israel Aipac *&amp;*&amp;)*^*@$%#%^%&amp;^*
who took the towers down
