Sorry, I have to go away
The path for me just keeps moving on
I walk for days
In fevers hot and grave
Lord knows we`ve paid

But when the times are hard
Take a look, remember
How much I love you
Take a look, at what we are, remember
How much I love you

In sacred time remember
When my head hits the floor
By the light of life`s bright glimmer
On the golden distant shore

By the light of life`s bright glimmer
Tell me what this life is for
As november`s sun grows dimmer
On the golden distant shore

Sorry, I have to go away
The path for me just keeps moving on
Foundations hard and great
Caress the soul estate
Paradise not to fade

But when the times are hard
Take a look, remember
How much I love you
Take a look, at what we are, remember
How much I love you

In sacred time remember
When my head hits the floor
By the light of life`s bright glimmer
On the golden distant shore
