I live on in world war 3
Look at untourched faces smile
(Look inside the mind)
People like the walking dead
Lead us to the womb and cry
(The truest thought you find)
heavy girl you`re all alone
Now is now your father`s call

The bloodless slaughter lingers on
`Til reality hits your soul

Come on and shine like it

A thousand cabs just pulled away
The rain was hard and clear
(Feelings that you borrow)
Fingers of my outstretched hand
Dying on the frozen fear
(Won`t last tomorrow)
In so far the hottest star
Is the man with the machine gun
(The population`s sorrow)
Now the sign the violent time
And the decade has just begun

Come on and shine like it

Some say life is nothing new
The heart of man is gone
(Believe in something now)
But evening came, now I`m awake
And the new age begins at dawn

Come on and shine like it
