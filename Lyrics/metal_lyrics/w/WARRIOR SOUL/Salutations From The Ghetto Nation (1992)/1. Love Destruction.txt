Far out scenery, the year 2000
You like destruction, well let`s get started
The country`s broke, the kids retarded
Crime stained lovers, in cities rotted

Love my hatred, love my treason
It`s what you wanted and that`s my reason
Caught you livin` the empty feeling
A corporate handout to you is pleasing

You love destruction
You love destruction
You love destruction
You love, love, love, love, love, love

Love my hatred, love my treason
It`s what you wanted and that`s my reason
Caught you livin` the empty feeling
A corporate handout to you is pleasing

So what maggot, you rock star moron
You make me vomit, now pass the bourbon
I don`t take shit, I bow to no one
Don`t pledge allegiance to flags, I burn `em

You love destruction
You love destruction
You love destruction
You love, love, love, love, love, love
You love destruction
You love destruction
You love destruction
You love, love, love, love, love, love

Love destruction
Your love corrupt
Love destruction
Your love corrupt
