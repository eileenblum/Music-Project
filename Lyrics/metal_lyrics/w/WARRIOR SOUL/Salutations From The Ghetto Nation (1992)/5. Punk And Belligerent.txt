I`m going out tonight
And I`m going out drinking
Don`t bother waiting up
`Cause I`m coming home stinking

I`m tired of sitting `round
Watching my world going down
Gonna get kicked out
Of every bar in town

Cause I`m a punk and I`m belligerent
And I get drunk, now baby get in bed
Cause I`m a punk and I`m belligerent
And I don`t give a, give a, give a shit

If you mess with me boy
You better start thinking
Cause I`m a mean little sucker
And I`m coming out swinging

I`m coming down the street
And I`m lit up like a rocked
If I see your face again
Boy I`m going to sock it

Cause I`m a punk and I`m belligerent
And I get drunk, now baby get in bed
Cause I`m a punk and I`m belligerent
And I don`t give a, give a, give a shit

I`m tired of paying taxes
And footing all the bills
For all those fat slobs
Up on the capitol hill

If the president and cia
Don`t want me around
Get the dea cover and come
Shot me down

Cause I`m a punk and I`m belligerent
And I get drunk, now baby get in bed
Cause I`m a punk and I`m belligerent
And I don`t give a, give a, give a shit
