You yell at me
When the dishes aren`t done
But when we`re in bed babe
We`ll have fun `cause I love you
I am broke, the depression kicked in
But when we`re alone babe
I`m ready to sin `cause I love you
When I got you close, next to me
I`m making love like it`s world war 3
`Cause I love you
We walk this dying land
Children of the damned
`Cause I love you
Never wash the walls, never wash the floor
But when you`re in bed baby
You`re my whore
`Cause I love you
The president`s a joke
Government`s corrupt
I`m ready to rock, are you ready to suck ?
`Cause I love you
We walk in silent rage
No hope, no pay
`Cause I love you
Destabilization starts at the top
When I lie you down, I`m gonna shut you up
`Cause I love you
I`ll stay with you for the rest of your life
As long as you don`t look like
The president`s wife
`Cause I love you
