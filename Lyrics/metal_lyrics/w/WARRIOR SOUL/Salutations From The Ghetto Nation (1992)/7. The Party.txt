Go with the flow
Ya just let it ride
We don`t care if ya live or die

We suck of the companies
We suck like a whore
If we need oil, we just suck some more

We define success
And we don`t sin
Got the nation in debt
About four trilion

Infrastructure is wasted
And we`re deaf to the crowd
Nothin` left for the children
It`s ok, we won`t be around

Welcome to the party
The republican party
Ya havin` fun at the party
The republican party
We`re havin` a party, right now

We stack the courts
And we tax the poor
Got Johnny Lunchbox
To fight our wars

Tax him to his knees
And make him love the flag
We get corporate freedom
He gets a body bag

We`re makin` a killin` 
You know we kill so well
Cut the country to pieces
And we`re havin` a sale

We take it all
Just like ya knew we would
Hell we even got Nixon
Lookin` pretty good

Welcome to the party
The republican party
Ya havin` fun at the party
The republican party
We`re havin` a party, right now
