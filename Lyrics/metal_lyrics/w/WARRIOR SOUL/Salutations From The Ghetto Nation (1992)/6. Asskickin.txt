I come bangin` through the bedroom door
I been runnin` with a two-bit whore
Behavior is bad but I`m out of sight
Suckin` on a bottle and I`m ready to fight

I`m just ass-kickin` rock and roll

No one`s gonna keep me out of the bar tonight
Gonna keep on drinkin` `til I feel alright
There`s no place I`d rather be
Smokin` babes, a bottle and the bros and me

Just ass-kickin` rock and roll

If you dig the government I wish you well
I say them suckers they can go to hell
You say man, Kor., what did they do
Tell you one thing it wasn`t for you

Cause you`re ass-kickin` rock and roll

It`s a drag all alone locked in silence
Stand your ground fight the world in hard defiance
Take a look in your heart, fist to the sky
A spirit that lives to fight, remember will never die

I like runnin` with a two-bit whore
I like tootin` other people`s blow
I like a bar on an empty night
I like whiskey and gettin` tight
I like a bike on the boulevard
I like life and I live it hard
I like rejection and not fittin` in
I think it`s time that we begin
Some ass-kickin rock and roll
