Who is sick, of this war
And the one party system, oil company whores
Aren't you sick of endless corporate lies
from Washington to Pentagon &amp; the London banking tribe.
Fight back on every front, trash all the cameras
Stick to your guns

Mass media controlled by
defense corporations that send your kids to die
All good soldiers they do what's right
Don't follow illegal orders

Stop the rise of the Fourth Reich

They build detention centres for all you decenters
To die from torture and disease
it's time to fight back, it's time for us to act
And stop this corporate war machine
They start locally where we have authority
Before the bodies are you and me

Destroy the War Machine
With the truth from 9/11
Destroy the war machine, live in peace

The neo cons brought the towers down
They planted bombs three months before

Stop the rise of the fourth reich
Destroy the war machine
Live in peace
Stop the rise of the fourth reich
With the truth of 9/11
Destroy the War Machine
