The wave comes crushing my men
Creatures from the abyss will be our end
The storm has hit us, my fleet is in ruins
Our death is imminent, I'll be joining you soon

The enemy overruns my ship
I have to slay them all, saber through the flesh
Their blood stains the deck, it's beautiful to me
Our curse is rising from the deep blue sea
My ship is falling into the abyss,
Whirlpools of death will be my bliss

I have seen my men crushed by the force of tidal waves
Creatures from the abyss try to make the sea my grave

Reload the cannons, blow them all to hell
Friend or foe, how are we to tell?
If it moves you must decapitate thee
Send the enemy down to his knees
Faster than anyone can see, enemies falling by my swing despite the sea violently quaking

I have seen my men crushed by the force of tidal waves
Creatures from the abyss try to make the sea my grave
The untimely arrival of this destructive storm
Time comes to a halt until I reach the shore

The waves consume them, the sky turns red
Beneath me is nothing, but this is not the end
Life isn't a luxury to be thrown away,
But it's all or nothing to end this plague
