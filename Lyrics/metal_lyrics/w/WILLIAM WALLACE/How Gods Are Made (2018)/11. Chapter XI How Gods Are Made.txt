My wounds all healed, and my power raging
My mortal life is at an end
I feel the power of the flames in my veins
My sovereignty will soon begin

I instantly obliterate the shadow lord
The pagan god will wither and fade away
A result of my insurrection
Time to begin your resurrections

Peace on earth shortly shall ensue
This lasting life I'll bestow upon you
From their demise the dead shall rise
Ruler of all in this revelation

I lost my family to the evil tyrant
My fleet to the Octobeast
Felt the warm embrace of the Ascendant Realm
Knelt at a pagan gods feet

To defeat the wicked shadow lord
My life I gladly gave
Across the galaxy I did travel
And that is how gods are made
