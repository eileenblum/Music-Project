On the sea I lose myself
My mind spills upon the waves
In the distance there is an oncoming storm

Returning home from a battle won
Women raped and slaughtered
The horrors I've seen
would make your eyes bleed
Bodies torn asunder

On the sea I lose myself in darkness
I fade away (fade away)
I have seen my family laid to rest
And I know that I will soon be with them

As I depart from sanity
Compelled by vengeance inside my heart
As I think back to the terrors I've seen
I promise you my loved ones this
I will destroy everything
That enters into my path

My blade comes to vanquish thee
My enemies will fall to their knees
Blood will destroy everything
I will take them to their final resting place

Soon my revenge will take its hold
When I finally unsheathe my blade
My memories will be avenged
But the storm stands in my way

Revenge will come my beloved ones
Revenge will come by my hand
Revenge will come the almighty one
Revenge will come fall into the hands of grace
