When I'm summoned to the tyrant's god, he reveals his godliness is fading
With no one left to worship him, he will cease to exist

Bring food of gods to make him immortal
Before I go he transfers his power
I make my way through the portal
First things first the Octobeast will cower

The monster has taken my life
But I will now satisfy my thirst for blood
It consumes me
Let the onslaught commence

I take my leave I am now a demigod
As I get sent back I've spawned to where I died
A battle with the beast I shall have vengeance
This time it's not my life that will end

At the edge of the abyss, once again on the other side
The beast opens his mouth, it's his turn to die
This amazing power will let me slay the beast
As I descend upon him it's my turn to feast

As the beast comes forth tentacles reach the skies
He consumes me whole, swallows me alive
I run down his throat to reach his heart
From the inside out I will tear it apart

I stab through the heart of this mighty juggernaut
I leave behind a crimson tide the Octobeast has died
