The ambrosia is in the wasteland of Abbeleth
Guarded by the shadow lord and his undead
It's pitch black as I make my approach
I cannot shake this feeling of dread

I pass through the gates and the dead begin to rise
As their flesh begins to fall off their skeletal remains
In the darkness I can see the glow of their eyes
The mere sight of this would drive an honest man insane

My blood thirst cannot end
It will carry me through
With each life I take I can feel my will grow
Demigod strength will aid in this fight
I will end them all on this moonless night

I crossed swords with the shadow lord one night
As fate would have it I escaped with my life
To defeat him I would need the strength of a thousand men
I embrace my powers now their lives will end

How can I kill what is already dead
Tear them apart with my bare hands instead
When the last body finally falls
I take comfort becoming enthralled
The carcasses all burst into flames
The shadow lord will suffer unto me
This attack on my life was in vain
Entering the tower I am the deathly plague

The carcasses all burst into flames
Shadow lord I am coming for you

I have always feared returning here
Now I'll slit his throat from ear to ear
There will be no honor in his death
The shadow lord will be the ultimate test
