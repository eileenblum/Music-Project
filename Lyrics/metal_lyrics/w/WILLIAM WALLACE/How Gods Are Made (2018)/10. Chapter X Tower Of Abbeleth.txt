I walk through the doors with no fear in my eyes
I smell the flesh of the rotting inside
The shadow lord comes from the dark
The creator of wars, guarding the ambrosia

With my bloodthirst fading
How can I go on with this reign

I feel the cold from the blade
The lord thinks he's won
(Think again)
With my dying breath
I eat the ambrosia
A god I've become

I'm fighting for my life
As my blood hits the floor
I feel the death in my hands
The light starts to grow
Hope seems to fade
But I cannot stop
It's with deep regret
That immortality comes

The altar of the gods
The fruit that holds it all
