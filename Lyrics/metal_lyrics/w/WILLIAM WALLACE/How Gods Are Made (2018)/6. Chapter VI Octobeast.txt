Staring into the abyss as the waters swirl below
The beast opens its mouth to inhale us all

I've seen true evil, rising up from the drink, god help us see
I shall smite thee, our cannon fire lights up the sky
The Octobeast reveals its unholy skin, it blocks out our sight
Tentacles break the mast, the battle has just begun

My men's bodies, are being crushed by the beast, my blood runs cold
I grab my sword, fight back with all my might, this is my fate
I stab its eyes out, hear its ungodly shriek, the time has come
I'm able to accept the truth, my life will finally end here

Mass and mayhem, the giant devours my fleet
The time has come for one of us to live or die

My quest is done, my vengeance won
If I die than I die it's the way it must be
I hear my wife, I hear my son
From the Ascendant Realm they are calling to me

Fury and flaying, hacking and hacking
Iâm the only one left to stop the killing
