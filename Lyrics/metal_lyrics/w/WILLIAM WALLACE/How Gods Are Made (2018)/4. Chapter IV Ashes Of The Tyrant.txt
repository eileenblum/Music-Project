Slaughter thy enemies, your kingdom will fall
Ashes of the tyrant, I will rule them all
Instrument of death calling his name
I see you are evil you must be slain

All hands on deck prepare for war
It's nothing we haven't dealt with before
Finish the rum before the massacres begun
You may not survive make right with your god

In this time of peril the tyrant stands strong
When this battle is over there can be only one

As we reign down their bodies pile high
They will bow before us then we'll take their lives
When the end is at hand you must make your stand
Your army is vanquished no one will hear your cries

I will see your head fall
Your corpse standing tall
Morbid memories
From my broken dreams

In this time of peril the tyrant stands strong
When this battle is over there can be only one
I am the one

Slaughter thy enemies your kingdom will fall
Ashes of the tyrant I will rule them all
Instrument of death calling his name
I saw you were wicked you have been slain
