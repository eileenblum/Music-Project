fear
the world
is crushing me
revulsion is the air
iâm breathing its violence
systems clamping down like a tourniquet
swollen limbs
too tired to move

dread pervades the day
i am powerless
inertia exacts shameful complacence
in truth, i never had the agency
in shadows, i choke
on silent indifference

and i relent to power
and i relent to fear
and i relent to every force
that tramples without care
and i regret the meaning
ascribed to every life
the loss compounds completely
abject in defeat

terror
the world
has broken me
crumbling away, my body is failing
conflict rules the day,
death controls the night
never escape
my place in the gutter

control, endless control
abject in defeat

and i relent to power
and i relent to fear
and i relent to every force
that tramples without care
and i regret the meaning
ascribed to every life
the loss compounds completely
abject in defeat

but still, i remember
just who i meant to be
before hate so vicious
claimed its fee
the future full of wonder
all paths led out to sea
and slowly i discovered
this world is not for me

abject in defeat
