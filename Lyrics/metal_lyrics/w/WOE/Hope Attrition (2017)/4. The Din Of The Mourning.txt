the din of the mourning
roaring in tongues

rattles every organ
no sound escapes
the sky as cathedral
never unheard

screams bleach the skin
make ghosts of fears
bodies stacked high to defend the pale

scavengers appear
to pick apart the bones
feasting in the mountain of horror
scavengers, they wait
they glower at the thrones
together in their isolation

sever now your reason,
abandon all your sight
so lost to tales, all logic fails
and ignorance commands your fealty

blind leading blind
dead commands the live
children howl while elders scowl and flesh
is carved to stave off decay

from the shadows, the preachers call
vomiting doomed condemnation on all
bold declarations, the vision of paul
first sight reveals that their lies are failures

i praise the end! i praise the end!
barred the gates
panic reigns
your cries the only lamentation

scavengers appear
to pick apart the bones
feasting in the mountain of horror
scavengers, they wait
they glower at the thrones
together in their isolation

torrents and torrents of shit
the din of the mourning

suffer
worthless in life, hopeless endeavor
wasted
nothing remembered, death as in life
shameless
every single word is a weapon against
yourselves
injured
always the victim, never to blame
bleeding
hemorrhage together, dig at your wounds
dying
every failing a reflection of your stagnation

wasted
worthless
bleeding

i fear the mourningâs call
failure
scars silently corrupt
we wait too long forever
we wait too long for life
we wait too long forever
now the time for change
has long since died

the end of every joy
we are our own undoing

i praise the end! i praise the end!
youâve barred the gates as panic reigns
last breath unmourned and unheard
