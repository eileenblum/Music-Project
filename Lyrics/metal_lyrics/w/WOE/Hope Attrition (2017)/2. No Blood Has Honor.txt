faith condemns 
faith condones 
faith creates fearâs traditions 
fear consumes 
fear controls 
fear belies your ambitions 

fear preserves 
fear demands 
fear the fall into depression 
lose control 
lost control 
shrinking down into submission 

do you remember losing your child eyes? 
colors fading, edges jagged 
ripped your gaze from the sky 
into starving darkness 
did hatred deliver the hope that died? 
when you killed for that adventure? 
when you stole the joy that 
you were denied? 
will you outrun all your failures? 

and when you close your eyes 
how do you close your eyes? 
what could you know about honor?

blood without honor 
no blood has honor 

dead fathers 
dead sons 
what could you know about honor? 
dead mothers 
dead daughters 
what could you know about honor? 
dead children 
dead loves 
what could you know about honor? 
lost youth 
dead hope 
what could we know about honor?
