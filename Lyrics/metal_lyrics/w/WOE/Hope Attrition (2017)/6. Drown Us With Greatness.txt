demand
demean your foes
the stench of fear is rising

the folk
the fools
the flies that buzz
they fuss and cling to words
to words like dirt
that works its way in cracks that spread
throughout the face and deep into the hole
that pit where once dared beat a heart
now rots
now hates
now loathes
in absolute disgust

disgrace
decry the earth itself
if ever
it dared to turn against the tide that
...drags at the future
...drowns us with greatness

a man beyond a man
a man who bore a movement
like a drill into the head of peace
a movement of god
for only god could wreak this vengeance

a rising fist towards
the living
the dying
awake and free from the shackles of hope
be the seething
the writhing hurt
the ending that we deserve
the scheming
the lying
the promise that hate will
smother the truth
is this seething
this writhing hurt

he reaches down inside
thereâs nothing there to grasp
a vacuous existence
a ravenous demand for power strangles
every action
consumes his every breath
the viciousness propels
him to the point he wishes
that there never has to be an ending
detests the worth of peace
reminds him of his worthlessness
beyond the world of conflict
and bereft manipulation
he wallows in despair
unsure of how to soothe his swollen ego
he screams out

see the collapse of all people
feel the dead grip of decay
hear the last gasp of this era
taste the sour air of defeat
smell the rot leap from our leaders
know the dread freezing them cold
rocks line the cliffs of the futureâs shore
to the edge we march and hell below
