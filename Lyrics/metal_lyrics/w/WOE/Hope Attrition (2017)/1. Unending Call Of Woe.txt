this is a failure
and every wretched word
is broken, enfeebled
never to be heard

this is surrender
all history consumed
by the tomb of oppression
that is this living world

in the dead gaze of the future
roars the great furnace of time
renders ash all dreams of purpose
blacken every bone, blacken every hope

we awoke to find this
poisoned land unchanged
and the world beyond our
blood-shot eyes still horror
every thought a ruthless circle
every word a vicious stone
every effort wracked in violent degradation

feeble forms, the spirit broken
ground to dust by the
weight of nothingness
death compels all hopeâs attrition
desperate throes of the human condition

we renounce all hope and
all the days to come
will be the coldest reinforcement
of our failures

held below the surface and
caressed by probing jaws
our bodies claimed as grist
to feed the futureâ¦

stripped to the bone

absolute emptiness
held captive by doubt
razed
forgotten
irrelevant unto the end

crumble in solitude
this is the end
devoid of meaning
irrelevant unto the end

[solo - cg]

this is submission
a final repose
this is submission
to the unending call of woe
