[performed by Woe]It's growing in my core and never goes away
Wish for sleep, wish for death, wish for anything to calm this jagged edge
You're never far away
No water can wash away this stain or calm my heightened nerves
No pill to take to fight the pain that's in my skin and never fucking leaves
It never fucking leaves
I hate what I've become
I hate who I've become
I hate this life I never cared or felt a thing about
I hate what I've become
No water... etc,...
No hope for peace of mind to wish for such is death in life but still I yearn for something that is just beyond my grasp
Satan, arise, be one with this pain

I summon that which controls the bitter waves
and hold onto the fire which burns within my veins
It twists and squirms within my claws but never will it leave
I now control the rage that builds with every waking dream
Behold the flames of Hell
Behold all that I make....
