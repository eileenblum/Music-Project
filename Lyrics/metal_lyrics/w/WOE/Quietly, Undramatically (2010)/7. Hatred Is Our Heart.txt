surrender to this reason / my words will hang you high / this noose of cold indignance / will choke you till you die / your art has proven hollow / dull masks you can't sustain / cause once the show is over / you change your fucking names / as flies flock to the rotten / you feed on putrid shit / living out your fantasies / and bragging about it! / see how far they run / watch them as they cry / ants, they run for cover / see how hard they try! / the stupid / the boring / the fair-weather friends / pretentious / obnoxious / they strive to pretend / with costumes / and gimmicks / they angle to shock / like children / they cherish / the lies that they bought / we will stand and continue to lash out / and you'll know our names because / hatred is our heart / and / when the sun reappears and casts away the dark / we will rise and know that / hatred is our heart / and / we will rejoin the world and will walk amongst the crowds / but we will know that / hatred is our heart / and / there is no mask, no fake name, no poetry to hide behind / there is no game / yes, / hatred is our heart / / when these words are long forgotten / and these songs have gone away / i'll continue what i started / and stand behind what i say / see how far they run / watch them as they cry / ants. they run for cover / see how hard they try! / condemned as our prey, there's nowhere to hide / for this is the future you must realize / the hunters (unholy) have removed their masks / there's no use for chains or rules of the past
