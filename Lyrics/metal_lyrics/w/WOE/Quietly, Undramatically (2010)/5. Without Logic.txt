summon your reasons / someone to blame / something that happened / it's always the same / i hate the world i live in / i am the key to the end / life stifles me with reason / i will no longer pretend / my hate exists without logic / my rage was never explored / you should have seen this coming / now i will not be ignored / sanity's rational chains come undone / i feel no pity, you will receive none / patience exhausted, no time to explain / all that i'm feeling and all that i say / a rational existence has taken its toll / the world's been explained at the cost of my soul / a predictable planet's preferred by the weak / i look deep inside and refuse now to think
