the triumph of power exists as a lie / its control, a figment of all it denies / with pitiful gestures, we jump as it tries / to salvage the notion it comes from the sky / what knowledge precedes us, what failures held high / with this i admonish the longing that dies / they'll tell you of battles you'll exit alive / but know that these fragments of hope are all lies / we end and begin / outside and within / reduced to skin / the truth is thing / what hope shall change the flow of time? / this bone is lead, this curse is mine / here i stand, the lord of all i see / this kingdom is fire, it answers not to me / strained and torn / this i know: all that we are is but a blaze / we're nothing but disciples of the wind / here i stand, the lord of all i see / this kingdom is fire, it answers not to me
