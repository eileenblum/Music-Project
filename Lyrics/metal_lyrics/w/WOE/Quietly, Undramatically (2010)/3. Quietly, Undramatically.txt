i threw my last years away / to focus on reality's thread / and when i collapse i know / the string will continue to wind / and with these words i make an oath that silence will outlast me / it stretches far beyond the place that history will know me / for as i sit, secure in what i know is now before me / i focus on the end and how i know that it will take me / quietly / undramatically / when you're gone / frozen images dissolve, discarded / with certainty / the struggles that we face disappear, uncaring / with disregard / quietly time shuffles through the room, unknowing / with disregard / undramatically we'll fade and then this won't matter / breathe in, breathe out / no triumph to be found / like a stone cast to the sea / i will be forgotten / let this fade as a whimper against time / i will be forgotten / i will be forgotten / we will be forgotten
