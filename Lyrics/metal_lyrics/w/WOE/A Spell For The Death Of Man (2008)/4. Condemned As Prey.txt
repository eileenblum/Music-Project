Sorrow chokes the air and fills the lungs with such noxious fumes.
"Breath deep," she says, "For I am forever throughout this world."
She is the creeping shadow cast by every winter's moon.
Frigid darkness to chill the fragile skin of man, condemned as prey to her unyielding hunger.
The world is cleansed by Sorrow's touch.
Devoured, flesh. Devoured, bone.
Condemned as prey.
All hope dismissed as fallacy, a truth known beyond words.
A curse upon Serenity, who clings to shallow truths.
This ghost will stalk reality 'round every darkened curve.
The true face of humanity, we get what we deserve.
Sorrow chokes the air and fills the mouth with words of anguish.
"Speak with ease," she laughs, "for I will always guide your tongue."
Sorrow chokes the air and fills the lungs with such noxious fumes.
"Breath deep," she says, "For I am throughout this world."
Condemned as prey.
