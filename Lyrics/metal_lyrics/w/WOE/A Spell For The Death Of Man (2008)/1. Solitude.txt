Cackling past, I curse your echoing voice.
I have become the air that was so cold.
The final form surrounding that which we never have known.
So bleak it is that nothing will escape.
The enemy of all that was and all that should have been.
The unfeeling Earth was never this aware.
A piece of me is dying and I somehow do not care.
No victory or strength to battle this and hope for life.
We hold our breath and close our eyes and now lay down to die.
I question that which guides my every step.
No God exists to place the blame, it solely lies within.
My feeble heart is blackened from the worthlessness of life.
I hold my breath and close my eyes and now lay down to die.
Do you still ring with the pain of the words not forgotten that hide in my shadow like so many faded days?
How your anguish persists, it still gnaws at my heart.
These memories will chase me eternal and grant me no... Solitude.
A single voice still lingers.
