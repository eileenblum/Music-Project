I carry the weight of unyielding loss.
A future perplexed and I fear its true cost.
Blacken the depths of the heart.
Wake in mourning, surpass the most unspeakable odds.
Decisive its menace, I sink and depart.
Black the depths of the heart.
I can't inhale, no strength exists.
To rise and continue as this anguish persists.
Another sacrifice to some rancid god of Time.
No footnote to write in the great book of life.
Cold barbed wires, the poisoned hand of time.
The sun slowly opens its funeral eye.
Tired expression to soothe all the lies.
A patient reminder of all that must die.
I carry the weight of unyielding loss.
Behind me, the night and all promising thoughts.
Blacken the depths of the heart.
No door, no key, no great escape.
We live in search of freedom but are only guaranteed pain.
I carry the weight of unyielding loss.
A future perplexed and I fear its true cost.
Blackened the depths of the heart.
