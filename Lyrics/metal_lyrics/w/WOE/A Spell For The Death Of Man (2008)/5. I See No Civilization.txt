Please grant me this one wish: This skin will never burn.
Let the bones collapse like every body must but let the form escape the ravage that come.
A guarantee of every interaction.
Necessity, perhaps, of this human complication.
This world breed pain and suffering.
I fear this dedication.
Await the day my name is changed to meaningless distraction.
Perhaps we've seen too much.
Perhaps we've gone too far.
Perhaps we've seen too much.
Perhaps we've gone too far.
A first against the collective hopes of man.
One crushing blow for every glorious stance.
If hope is truth, failure is fact.
Despite our dreams, conflict is true contact.
Wait for the day when my name becomes a curse upon your lips.
It will dig into my core and haunt me as I walk, a ghost upon this Earth.
A voice still lingers when I wake.
The promise is loss.
The shallow mind of man is still animal at its core and he is unable to control it, no matter how much 'knowledge' he tells himself he possesses!
I see no civilization.
No triumph of the will, for strife is all man seeds.
A tree of hate that flower not but on our pain it feeds.
Compassion feigned by selfishness, command all life to bleed.
This body aches from all it's seen but a force is strong within.
