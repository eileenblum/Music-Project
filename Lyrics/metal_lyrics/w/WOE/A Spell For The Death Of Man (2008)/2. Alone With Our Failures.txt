Faceless summer night.
I call out from the shadows.
Empty now, the barren streets summon scenes.
Here a blackened future lies.
Condemn this shallow world to wallow in its sadness.
Broken now, the city bleeds a noxious blood and slowly dies.
I pretend that I am more.
A rotten pretense to the chains I wear.

An empty lie of sullen safe from the claws of the beast of which I am part.
And here is no sound acknowledging darkness.
We stand on hollow ground.
And scream the hopeless.

We live as cancer breeds.
Can you see beyond your eyes?
There is no renewal on this Earth.
No solution beyond a mass grave.

A spell for the death of man.
A spell for disease we've never known.
Dispel all myths of hope and joy.
Unleash the beast we hold within.
A spell for the death of man.
A spell for disease we've never known.
Dispel all myths of hope and joy.
Unleash the beast we hold within.

Alone with our failures. [x4]
