Every yearning glance.
Every tender touch.
Every calm exchange.
Every hopeful plan.
Every peaceful day.
Every joyful yell.
Every distant hill.
Every faithful friend.
Every open sky.
Every laughing voice.
Every cherished hope.
Every patient smile.
Every soft embrace.
One day fades to silence.
Momento Mori.
