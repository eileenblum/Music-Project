Where do we go from here? When all lasting visions fade to scenes of how we've failed? When emptiness supplants promises made to last? When the road to progress drops away, reveals itself as a cliff to dive from? I have decided to leave. But with every hour, each answer leads to more questions asked. At what point is departure a worthy path? And with silence cast, how far reaches the fire left in my wake?

I see the color fading from your eyes.

I concentrate on the end. On nonexistence, the nothingness one cannot know. silent expanse stretching endlessly beyond time. An unending black meditation.

To the dark I flee, eyes drawn to the night. I scream out but the words escape me. All the reason flees, nothing pure survives. Alone, I feel the energy envelop me. to the end I'm pulled, eyes drawn to the void, offering its union, silence, without price. voices floating near, faceless in the sky. A battle in my consciousnesses to push past all the doubt. Abandon all positions and seek solace in the ground. Melodramatic premonitions that the end would offer peace. Is it hope or is it terror that wards off this cold that summons me?

To nothing we return. The final cost that life incurs, locked away to memory's shackles. Where I go, there's only loss. Chilling waves surrounding me, horrified by love's embrace.

"Death is all we can know
Finality of what we've sown
The aeons pass, all hope denied
To the darkness joined with starless skies
Death is all we can know
As time goes on, complacence grows
In servitude we waste away
As if these things matter, as if anything lasts"

I see the color fading from your eyes. Fear the unknown of the other side. Something's got to change. I'm learning not to care. I'm never coming back. All bridges burned.
