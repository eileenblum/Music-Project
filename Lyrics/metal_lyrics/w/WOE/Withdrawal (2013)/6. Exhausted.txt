Waste away, I'm breaking down. Who am I and how did this happen? Never thought I'd be this way. The ceiling's low, I'm growing taller. Each day seems to be still longer. No escape, there's no escape. Close my eyes, my head is pounding, searing knives that slice my skin. Every moment still worse than the last.

"Fury, my friend, here we are again. You were never far away. Nothing's really changed. The sky is still the same. The same dead fixtures, a different name.

Hate draws you in, wishing for an end. How I plotted and I schemed. Living a lie, failing though I try. Teeth are falling out in my dreams."

Nothing matters.
Nothing...

It's a fraud, it's a lie, nothing matters, still we try.
Exhausted.

I scream it with open arms.
I give up and fade away to silent sleep.

[Solo: BB]

Hatred lights the way. A torch through the dark.

Death can't help but laugh and taunt us with eternal slumber. All our hopes and our dreams are sand beneath our feet.
