Need, she hides in the silence. Fantasizes about how you'll touch. The warmth of your tears as she draws you near, over and over again.

And you
                    seeping
                                      wet mass
Falling
                    again
Spilling out
                    to circle
                                      the drain.

She drinks you down and spits you out into so many pieces. Puddles of your ego. Stains of who you thought you were. 

Obsession stands just behind you, whispering into your ears. Knows all of the ways to guide you to relive your fears.

Consumed and penetrated, compromised and beaten down. Alone and medicated, anchored tight to help you drown. Deep in this living tissue, frozen claws compel the mind. Some slaves, they choose their masters, others are born into their lives...

Gather the wind. It won't lift you up from where you've landed. Consumed by guilt. Faceless forces drain you empty. Covered in scars. Who can see the hooks that guide you? Helpless to change. Forced to kneel forever in the dirt.

And in your proudest moments, swore you'd grow, swore you'd change. Such grandiose convictions. Who then, now, is left to blame?

Eaten alive. Flesh torn from bone. You're left a shell. Condemned as prey to compulsion's ceaseless jaws.

Need, she hides in the silence. Fantasizes about how you'll touch. The warmth of your tears as she draws you near, over and over again. Obsession stands just behind you, whispering into your ears. Knows all of the ways to guide you. She knows all of your fears.
