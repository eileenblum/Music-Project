Spit from the river, we floated, adrift in yearning waves. An unending torrent of desperation. Emptiness, a raft. We clung with feeble hope, sweat into the air, screamed into the night. In pursuit forever, just drifting ever onward, no words to make this right.

Warm in our hands were the tools of our destruction. Desire dripping from all pores. Waiting inside were the keys to raise the gates from every dam. Desire dripping from all pores.

A yawning void with a furious pull. A secret demanding you learn. Heart pumping fast with the nearing of the kill. Desire dripped from all pores.

Unrestrained violence propelled us through the night. The vicious degradation that robbed us of our pride. The fear; the power, hysterical hatred was thrusting ever forward. A pulsing presence that would be not be denied. A vulgar acquiescence to the horrors of the mind. for then, for always, a potent reminder that life is exploitation. I feel the terror both awake and in my dreams. the world has become smaller and I can't escape your screams. The need, the horror, the compounding judgement of...

Eyes are wide with fear and clothes are soaked from terror. Knowing death is near, their eyes are filled with horror. Every cell inside is calling my a liar. Nothing dulls the pain. Your eyes were filled with fire.

Eyes are wide with fear and clothes are soaked from terror. Knowing death is near, their eyes are filled with horror. Every cell inside is calling me a liar. Nothing dulls the pain. Your eyes were filled with fire. Carnal pounding in my chest, a new desire. Everything was wrong. My words have become daggers. Fear replaces hope that drives you as a child. There is no turning back until this world is on fire.

Carried by waves to remorseless shores of the truth.

A predator lives inside of every man. It victimizes everything it can. It justifies its needs at your expense. We all fuck each other, there is no defense. We're all fucked. There is no defense.
