Homesick never meant a thing
Till I heard your voice, till I heard you sing
And it takes me back, back to a time
A smile came so much easier
Puts the fight back in my heart, fight
I never realized we spent so much time apart
And another thousand miles down this road
Only meant good memories
Sometimes it seems thats all I got left
And I almost forgot
I hope they never fade
Opens up my senses
Cleans my soul
Dreams resurface
