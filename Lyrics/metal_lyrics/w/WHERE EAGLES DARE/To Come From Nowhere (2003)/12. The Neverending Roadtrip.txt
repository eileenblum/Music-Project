Busted knuckles, broken hearts
How do I say this, where do I start?
Con yourself into thinking it's what you need
She'll skin you alive and watch you bleed
So say goodbye to greener fields
And its a concrete heart that knows how you feel
This city gets brighter the closer we get
Its one hell of a drive, but we're not there yet
Roll that window down, and shut your eyes
Let go of the wheel, you know it feels so good
Sleep is sparing, but I'm not quite caring
Screaming engine, lick of flame on the hood
Trace this landscape with no tread on these tires
Burned it all off, pointed at the sun
Tarnished silver lining, cold shoulder riding
Cracked windshields and crooked smiles
The odometer flipped with the loveless smiles
