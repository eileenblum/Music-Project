What can I do to make you smile
Ease the pain or kill the hurt
How many times can this world come to an end
Come crashing down to destroy everything
You whisper you're ok through a quivering voice
We've been through this before, you and I
We've been through this before
You and I gotta stick together
And we'll make it through again
Because love and pain are the same damn thing
Open your heart and someone fills it with gasoline
Throws in the burning torch and they dance in the orange flame
Just remember I'll be right by your side
To sift through the ashes and rebuild whats left of you
And when you reach out through clenched and crying eyes
Know that my hand is the first thing that you'll touch
And I'll pick you up till you can stand on your own again
Strong and proud
The way I know you best
And this burning sadness
Will form a friendship
Even stronger
