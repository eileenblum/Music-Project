Who needs to pick a lock
When a crowbar works just fine
Rip this padlock from its hinges
Unveiling what was mine
When you find the time for me
I'll make the time for you
The frailty in that smile
Just leaves me on the floor
And you'll just let me lie here
I know thats what you'll do
Because you never cared for me
how come i never knew
Who needs to pull a trigger
When six inches of steel
Will lay me down just the same
Or a click to the dialtone
Who needs to light a match
And set this whole world aflame
When after everything has burned
Nothing will ever change
