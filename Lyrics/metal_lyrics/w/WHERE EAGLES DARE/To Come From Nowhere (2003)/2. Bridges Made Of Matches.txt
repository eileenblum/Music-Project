The boards of these matches
Still creak beneath my feet
I'm already lighting that match
Already burning it down
It's getting harder to look in the mirror lately
Afraid the gears on this clock are going to stop turning
Before i figure out just what I'm doing here
Sometimes its all so certain
Sometimes its so unclear
This melody in my mind slows down sometimes
My dance quiets to a shuffle 'cross the floor
Nights go out and my friends go home
And I'm left standing behind this lonely door
The same silence where i find my sanctuary
Locked away my silent prayers for comfort
Waiting for that sun to shine
Down on me
That warmth on my skin starts to burn
Behind these iron bars
Through this open window
I'm waiting for that sun to sun shine
Wish these scars could form a name across my heart
At least then I'd know who to blame
As I look through the haze of my selfish ways
It starts to look alot like my name
