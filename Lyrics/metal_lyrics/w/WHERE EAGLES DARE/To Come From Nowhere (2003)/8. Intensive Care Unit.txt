The next time that I see you
I'm going to lose my voice
Screaming at the top of my lungs
That I love you
Rip open my chest and throw my heart on the table
For you and God and everyone to see
This is my only bet, this is my only wager
And there's no way that I'm going to lose
It's more than respect
So much more than love
Whenever its you that I'm speaking of
After all those times we shared
Endless nights fighting for a hopeless cause
When you looked me in the eye
And said cut all the losses
It's been too long since I've heard your voice
Far too long since I've seen your face
Once a year just ain't enough
But it's all i get in this forsaken place
Through betrayal and through love lost
Sometimes I wish you were here
Just so we could talk
But after all is said and done
I'll still be screaming love
The next time that I see you we're gonna conquer the world
Now I know the strength of a prayer and a smile
