So what am i supposed to do with these lies?
You better believe things are changing
And I'm almost mad at myself 
For letting it get this far
Once again my heart's on the shelf
And i still don't know who you are
But I'll look past this and I'll turn the page
Keep my eyes on whats ahead
Take it day by day, lets go
I'll look past this
Keep my eyes on whats ahead 
Take it day by day
Never will I understand why you just don't come clean
Go, whoa, stop!
