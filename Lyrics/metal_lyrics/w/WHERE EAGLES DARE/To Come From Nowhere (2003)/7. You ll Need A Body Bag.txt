You'd have to drag me out of here
Kicking, screaming, it's times like these
I can't hear the noise
When all I want is
Nothing you could offer
All I want is nothing from you
Will you ever understand
Sometimes what I need most
Is your absence and I'll spend time
With these old ghosts
These angels without eyes
Put myself as far away as i know how
Take advice from that old song and enjoy the silence
If you only knew how much closer this brings me to you
No friend or lover could be as comforting
As this empty room, this unsung melody
So realize, when I finally
Break beyond the confines of this comfort
How much you mean to me
