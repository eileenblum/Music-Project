Summon the dead
prepare the ritual
Kill on command
Offer to the master's throne
Mortals falling down
At the crack of doom
Mortals, for evil to consume
Blood splattered walls,
Scene of a massacre
Shredded flesh and bone
Mark of the beat written in fire
upon the altar's stone

No! No one left to kill
No one left to kill
Intensive violence, outbreak of death
Killing time begins
Raining bloody chunks of meat
A barrage of mutilated limbs

Await the time of sacrifice,
Offer to the damned
Laughing as I slay the weak
Slaughtered by my hand
Evil visions fill my mind,
Chills you to the bone
Take the life force from your soul,
Satan claims his throne

Satan claims his throne!
Mortals falling down
At the crack of doom
Mortals, for evil to consume
