City in panic, missiles launched
The world has not a chance
The war is over just as it began
Nations turned to ash
Nothing is left, save a few
Now struggling to survive
Radiation culls the weak
Only the strong don't die
Born of the ruins, mutated flesh
Twisted creations of man
The planet perverted, skies of blood
Are crying rains of fire
Under the surface survivors hide
From certain death on high
Earthquakes rage, cities fall
The planet cleansed of life
You! Born of the ruins of earth
Your life has no worth
Fear your demise at the hand
Of radioactive land
Run from the ravenous beast
On you they will feast
Now with your backs to the wall
You all shall fall!
