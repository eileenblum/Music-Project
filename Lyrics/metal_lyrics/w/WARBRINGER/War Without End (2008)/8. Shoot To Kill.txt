Awaken from beyond the grave
The walking dead arise
Silently they head your way
With dead and empty eyes
Bar your windows, lock your doors
Before the sunlight fades
You cannot fun you have to fight
Send them back to Hades
Yeah, Shoot to Kill!
Fire at will
Out from the dark the hordes advance
Screams break the still of night
All alone you're bound to die
Before the sun's first light
Yeah, Shoot to Kill!
Fire at will
Yeah, Shoot to
Kill them all one by one the wicked fall
Fire at will
KILL
Tortured and beaten, death and decay
Covered in acid, your body melts away
Torn apart skinned alive, screaming out in pain
Feasting upon you, 'till nothing left remains
Yeah, Shoot to Kill!
Fire at will
Yeah, Shoot to
Kill them all one by one the wicked fall
Fire at will
