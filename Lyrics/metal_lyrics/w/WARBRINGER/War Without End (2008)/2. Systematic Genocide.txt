The orders given
The time has come to kill
Dispatched in silence
Commanded by psychotic will
TIME TO DIE Systematic Genocide
time to end your life
SAY GOODBYE Systematic Genocide
none will survive
Incinerated cities falling
A burning waste
Carred lands, devoid of life
Radiation waves
Death squads, hunting the streets
Leave none alive
You know the end is coming soon
Nowhere to hide
TIME TO DIE Systematic Genocide
time to end your life
SAY GOODBYE Systematic Genocide
none will survive

Time to die - Genocide
Time to die - Genocide

Epidemic, millions die with no hope of a cure
The infected start to rot, torment they can't endure
As one their dying souls cry out
to gods that do not hear
Murderous depravity, death is drawing near
Cities slowly pounded into dust
Populations run in terror as they die,
spill their blood
Merciless destruction, cause of death
spirits fall to hell, eternally condemned
Terrorize with deadly force
Spare no lives, there is no remorse
