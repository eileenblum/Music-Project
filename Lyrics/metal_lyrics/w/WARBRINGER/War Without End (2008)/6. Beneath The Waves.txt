Running silent ten thousand below
Paranoia strikes at your mind
Claustrophobic fear takes hold
To the depths, you are confined
Trapped beneath the waves, no escape
There's no hope for you, it's too late
Upon the surface the enemy awaits
Seeking souls to claim
Haven't seen the sun for weeks
Slowly going insane

Trapped beneath the waves, no escape
There's no hope for you, it's too late
Brace for impact
Explosions rip the hull
Bodies dashed against the sides, shattering the skull
Cracks appear, water rushing in
The vessel sinking lower and engulfing all within
SHARK ATTACK!!!
On those who try to flee
Gnashing teeth, shredding limbs,
Blood runs through the sea
Chilling screams, echo through the depths
The ship strikes the bottom
As you take your final breath
Trapped beneath the waves, no escape
There's no hope for you, it's too late
To the depths below, you descend
Trapped beneath the waves, it's the end
There's no way out
Nowhere to go
A watery grave
awaits you below
