Forced to kill without a cause
Into death's cold gaping jaws
The code is red, missiles fly
Shot out of the sky
Savage tribes locked in the past
Die where you stand, asphyxiating gas
Hostiles surround, soon to be dead
When dread command comes
It leaves with your head

Left here to die you're alone
With the savage from hell
Eviscerate all who oppose
Or in torment you'll dwell
Taking them down in a blaze of death,
Justice is done
When dread command strikes,
There'll be nowhere left to run

Wither in pain
They die this night
Struggle in vain
Say your goodbyes

Left here to die you're alone
With the savage from hell
Eviscerate all who oppose
Or in torment you'll dwell
Taking them down in a blaze of death,
Justice is done
When dread command strikes,
There'll be nowhere left to run
