Instruments of torture, of death and of pain
They're coming to take you away
Locked in a chamber, bound up in chains
Hid from the light of the day
Terrified victims screaming with fright
The walls made of stone now entomb
A glint of steel shines in the night
Confess or meet your doom

Blades begin to slice the flesh
Slowly bring you to your death
Ropes stretch at the skin and the bone
Cry out for help, but still all alone

Cries of torment echo from the grave
Satan laughs, your soul cannot be saved
Instruments of torture
Neverending pain
Instruments of torture
Life slipping away
Instruments of torture
Shackled in chains to the floor
Hear the screams echo forevermore
A screw is turned with increasing force
To crush the skull with no fucking remorse
Skin is peeled from the eyes
Punctured by the iron maiden's spikes
Why won't they just let me die!

Instruments of torture, of death and of pain
They came and they took you away
trapped in a coffin, buried alive
Hid from the light of the day
Terrified victims dying and dead
The walls made of stone now entomb
A glint of steel shines in the night
Now they come for you

Blades begin to slice the flesh
Slowly bring you to your death
Ropes stretch at the skin and the bone

Cry out for help, but still all alone
Cries of torment echo from the grave
Satan laughs, your soul cannot be saved
Instruments of torture
Neverending pain
Instruments of torture
Life slipping away
Instruments of torture
