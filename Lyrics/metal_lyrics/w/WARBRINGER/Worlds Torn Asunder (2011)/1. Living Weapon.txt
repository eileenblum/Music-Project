Open Fire!

Speeding like a bullet
High velocity
Dealing out death with cutting edge technology

An agent of the government
Their orders absolute
They decide who lives or dies deciding who I shoot-

You're next!

[Solo - Laux]

Lazer-guided weapons
A storm of molten lead
The cutting edge of science is the sciences of death-

We strike!

Peace agreements shot to pieces
In a sudden flash
All around you burns to ash

Resocialized
Now I have no fear
Hiding right behind you
But you won't see me there

Infrared vision
I'll hunt you day and night
My orders are to murder and I've got you
In my sights

Living Weapon
Now I have become
Living Weapon

Open fire!

[Solo - Laux]

Drive the foe out of hiding
In the open they are slaughtered
Rounding up the population
Wives and children, sons and daughters
Stand facing the firing squad
With orders to be executed
A sudden, blinding flash
ALL AROUND YOU BURNS TO ASH!

[Solo - Carroll]

I am chained to the gun
Living weapon
What have I become?
Living! Weapon!

LIVING WEAPON!
