Spitting bile
Spreading lies
A warped perverted mind

Words that bite
Words that bind
Words that cannot ever be undone

The virus spreads and infects again
Treacherous! Treacherous!
The infection spreads like venom
Treacherous! Treacherous tongue

...That ties
Tongue that lies
Only spreads deceit

Open mouth
Closed fist
The hammer of justice will strike you down!

The virus spreads and infects again
Treacherous! Treacherous!
The infection spreads like venom
Treacherous!
Treacherous tongue!

Crawling in the dirt like a snake
How much more can you take?
Cannot rest until I see you chained
Retribution strikes, and you endure the pain
Nothing Gained!

[Solo - Laux]
