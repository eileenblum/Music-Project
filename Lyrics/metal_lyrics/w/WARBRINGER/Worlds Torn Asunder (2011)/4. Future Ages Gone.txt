Creating a better machine
Rendering ourselves obsolete
Will science betray us at last?
The age of man fades into the past

Ever pressing forward
To a new and unseen dawn
No turning back
The future age is gone...

GONE!

Higher intelligence, created in our place
Progress that disconnects us from human ways
A cybernetic future, Living synthetic life
Conscious becomes a signal, trampled by the march of time...

TIME!

We have crossed the threshold
Of a new and unseen dawn
Lost what could have been
In the future ages gone...

All gone!

FUTURE AGES GONE!

[Solo - Carrol]
[Solo - Laux]

Creating a better machine
Rendering ourselves obsolete
Science found its singularity
That's taken away all that's left of me
