Through the years
I have watched your lives unfold
Behind the veils of night
The ending is foretold

There will be no warning
When the blackness comes to take you
The eye of terror opens
And draws you... Within!

Ages pass
Change in ways we do not see
Forever we are lost
In demonic ecstacy

Before me the portal opens
Calling my name
One step beyond the threshold
In horror, cry out...

MY SOUL IS NOT MY OWN!!

AAAUUGGHH!!!

Swallowed by the abyss
Eternal blackness
Open wide the gates
Seal... your fate

The soul tries to escape
But it is caught in a black embrace
You are then one who bears the mark
Face to face with the gathering dark

The dark!

Soon time will come for all to be undone

Undone!

The soul tries to escape
But it is caught in a black embrace
You are then one who bears the mark
Face to face with the gathering dark

SWALLOWED BY THE ABYSS!!
ETERNAL BLACKNESS!!

Open wide the gates
Seal... Your fate!

Take one last look at the light
Tomorrow there will be no dawn... No dawn!
