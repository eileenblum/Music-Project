Lurk beneath the surface, yet hidden in plain sight
Forbidden thoughts shall be revealed, initiation rite

From out of the darkness, step into the light
Rid yourself of the lie...
THE LIE!!

Behold!
That which has been denied
Through time and space
That which has been...

Lost and damned forgotten, for a thousand years
The plan is set in motion, all will be made clear

Come out of the darkness, bringing forth the light
Break the chains of the lie...
THE LIE!!

Behold!

COLD ARE THE STARS AS THEY LAY FAR BEYOND THE NIGHT SKY
LOOKING DOWN ON US, WATCHING, AS WE FADE...

As we fade away!

An echo
Echoes.. AGH..
Echoes from the void!

COLD ARE THE STARS AS THEY LAY FAR BEYOND THE NIGHT SKY
LOOKING DOWN ON US, WAITING, AS WE FADE...

FADE AWAY!!!
AWAY!!!

Have we been betrayed?

[Solo - Carroll]

The secrets
That they have lost
We have kept...
At what cost?
Knowledge will remain
Another day
Even as our souls pass away!

Far beyond
All the keepers
Are all gone
Nothing will remain
All destroyed
Just an echo...
An echo from the void!

Still it presses on... an echo
Echoes.. AGH..
Echoes from the void!
