Life in a civilized society
Can't you see that it has made you weak?
You wouldn't survive in the world alone
A life without hardship is all that you've ever known

Return to primitive ways
Ruling with might
Kill or be killed
FIGHT OR FLIGHT!

Live from the land
Obey no command
I have no master
I have only the strength to kill and subdue my prey

Stalking you down, day after day
Baring my teeth, raising my spear
The call of the wild has cut away all the fear

Cut by stone
Tearing at the carcass
Stench of death
No life left

AAAUUUGGGH!

Broken bones, shattered teeth
Kill to be, savagery
Animal, wild beast
We descend into savagery

Seas spread like locust
Consuming all in their path
The skies are getting darker
The seas are turning black

[Solo - Laux]

The lands are ravaged
In mindless persistence
The species must devolve
To preserve its own existence

Cut by stone
Tearing at the carcass
Stench of death
No life left

Broken bones, shattered teeth
KILL TO BE, SAVAGERY!
Animal, wild beast
WE DESCEND INTO SAVAGERY!

We descend eternally!
