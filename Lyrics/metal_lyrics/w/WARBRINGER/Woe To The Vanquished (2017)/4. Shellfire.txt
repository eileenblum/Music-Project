I can't remember why the war started here
But the bombs started falling, year after year
The soldiers, they charge bravely into to the fight
But the incoming bombardment buries them alive

A lost generation dies by gunshot to the head
A forward advance over mountains of the dead
An outstretched hand reaching up through the wire
Can't hear the scream through the endless shellfire

Fire
Fire
Fire

We obey our leaders when they order the attack
With our honor and our glory, we live among the rats
The warriors, so valiant, drowning in mud
And forever these fields will be stained with blood

Every single day, the barrage raining down
Nothing I can hear, but the horrible sound

Incoming

A lost generation dies by gunshot to the head
A forward advance over mountains of the dead
An unseen hand, the voice of the liar
Will bury the world under endless shellfire

Fire
Fire
Fire
Shellfire

I'm cast aside now that I've played my part
I lie in the street, I beg not to starve
I'm crippled, disfigured, you just look away
The war you forgot, the price I have paid
