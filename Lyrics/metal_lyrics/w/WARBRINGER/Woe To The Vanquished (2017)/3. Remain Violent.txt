Get on the ground, put your hands where I can see
Lie face-down against the concrete
I am the predator, you are the prey
And you will respect my authority

That's what they want
For you to say
To remain silent
Now
You have the right
To remain
To remain violent

Violent
Violent
Violent
Remain violent

The constant threat of a shot to the chest
But defending yourself is resisting arrest
City streets that I called my home
Are starting to look like a combat zone

That's what they want
For you to say
To remain silent
Now
You have the right
To remain
To remain violent

Violent
Violent
Violent
Remain violent

That's what they want
For you to say
To remain silent
Now
You have the right
To remain
To remain violent

Violent
Violent
Violent
Remain violent
