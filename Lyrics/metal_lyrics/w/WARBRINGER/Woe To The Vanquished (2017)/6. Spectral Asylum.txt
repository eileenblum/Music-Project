Waking into nightmares
All I see is black
I am trapped inside
A chamber for the mind
The voices will appear
Once I shut my eyes

Fall into the shadow
Enter the beyond

Spectral asylum
The walls are closing in
I am locked inside
A dungeon of the night
There's nowhere I can run
When the killer lives inside

Fall into the shadow
Far, far beyond

Spectral asylum
Spectral asylum

Voices fill my mind, they are gnawing through the cracks
I see my own reflection and another face looks back
Searching for release from the darkness in my mind
I close my eyes to sleep, and all I see are knives
I can't get outâ¦
