Through the dawn of time and space
The legacy that we create 
The children of technology
The masters of the world

From clay
To steel
And stone
Transcend the flesh and bone
And watch 
And wait
For a new age 
On the shoulders of giants we look to the stars
For we see beyond this small Earth of ours
My life may be short
And soon I'll be gone
But knowledge lives onâ¦
And that is the power of flesh

They cremate us
Annihilate us
We fall
But our monuments stand tall

Until the end of time
The mind is the divine

[Solo: Becker]

On shoulders of giants we look to the stars
For we see beyond this small Earth of ours
My life may be short
And soon I'll be gone
But knowledge lives onâ¦
And that is the power of flesh

We're cremated
Annihilated
Another scar
But our mind's eye sees so far

I can see our destiny
To leave this world of ours
I see our future history
Written in the stars

[Solo: Carroll]

From high in the cosmos, we look down on Earth
For we have transcended our small universe
My soul will not perish
Long after I'm gone
My words will live on!
Divinity!
Divinity of flesh
