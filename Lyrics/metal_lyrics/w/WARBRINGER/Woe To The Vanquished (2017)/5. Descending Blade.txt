Lie in wait for the target
Stalking down the prey
I've come to collect the price on your head
A mission to assassinate

Watching in the night
With a telescopic sight
Look to the left
Look to the right
I am always right behind

Scanning through the infrared
Operate in secrecy
The orders are given by encrypted transmission
Now we know the target's nameâ¦
Descending blade

[Solo: Carroll]

On your back like a shadow
In position for the kill
Waiting for the moment to strike
And it might be tonight

Everywhere you go
I see you through my scope
All your dreams, all your hope
Disappear in the gunsmoke

Now closing in with sharpened knives
Death comes before the pain
Another laceration, with surgical precision
And their blood is washed away by the rainâ¦
Descending blade

[Solo: Carroll]
[Solo: Becker]

Just try to run
Cause we will find you all the same
By poison of the viper
Or bullet of a sniper
They are never seen againâ¦
No moreâ¦
Descending blade

Descend!

Just remember, the blade has a second edge

I see my own face in the crosshairs
A red dot between my eyes
There's only one second 'til the instant when I die
I never saw the bullet
Never felt the impact
Just the sound of the rifles crack
And everything went black
