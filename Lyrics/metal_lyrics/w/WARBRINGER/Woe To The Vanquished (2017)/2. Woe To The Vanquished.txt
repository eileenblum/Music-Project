To the victor goes the spoils
Sound the drums of war
Raising high our banners
The legion marches forth
On a trail of conquest
We are the sons of Mars!
We desecrate their shrines
Annihilate their Gods

They burn
The tomb of civilizations

On the endless march
We set afire the town
All who oppose 
The Gladius cuts them down (down!)
They call out for mercy
For refuge they seek
But the deafening roar of battles
Silences the weak

They fall
The fall of once mighty nations

The sick, the dying, the conquered, the slain
Forget their faces, forget their names
Vae Victis
Woe to the vanquished

Cities fall to the barbaric horde
Watch your family put to the sword
After the conquest men are enslaved
Children are butchered, the women are raped
Waters that once gave life run red
Your language, your culture, way of life dead
Each of your sons I shall murder at birth
'Til all of your people are wiped from the Earth

The tomb of civilizations
The fall of mighty nations
Woe to the vanquished

[Solo: Becker]
[Solo: Carroll]

The battle you have lost
The blood that falls like rain
Now your temples lie in ruins
Your people are in chains
Woe to the vanquished
Woe to the vanquished
Woe to the vanquished
Your line dies with you
