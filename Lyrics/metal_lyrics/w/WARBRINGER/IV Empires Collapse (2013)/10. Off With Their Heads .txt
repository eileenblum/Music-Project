Burn down all the towers
Tear them to the ground
Their time is at an end
The time to strike is now

Off with their heads!
Those who have lied

To us about the past
They lied about tomorrow
They promised us a future
Brought only pain and sorrow
Liars!

Off with their heads!
Those who have lied
Off with their heads!
The axe is coming down
