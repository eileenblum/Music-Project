In my mind I hear a rising whisper
A transmission from the other side
Getting closer drawing nearer 
Now my thoughts becomes so clear...

Death becomes the reason for my prayer
I call to you but no one is there
Tell me there is more than this
I cannot face the nothingness
Confronted by a truth I can't deny

I must break these chains
That lock my mind
No more mysteries
To hide behind

Ohh....
The truth can't be denied

Now I will surrender to the flames
To the flames
To rise again
We stand upon the threshold, nothing of the old shall remain

Broken horizons
Transcend the limits of my sight
Broken
Broken
Horizon
