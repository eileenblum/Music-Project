Denied every chance to succeed
What else can they take away from me
Someone owns the air that I breathe
Nothing left to take away... from me

In the corner of my mind the clock is ticking
Can't slow down the pace is unrelenting
Must obey commands of the master
Running but the wheel keeps turning faster

Day after day, year after year
All I can hear is the turning of the gears
Day after day, year after year
All I can hear is the turning of the gears

Turning....
Turning...
Turning...
Someone make it stop!
Day after day, year after year
All I know is I can't hide from the fear
Another day, Can't face another year
When all I hear is the turning of the gears
