Infinite
Incarnate once again
Know I have been summoned
By the voices in your head
And know it was your priest
That gave me human form
Corruption of the innocent
They wait for my return
Weakening the minds
Blinding of the eyes
You kneel before the altar
And now you are mine

[Chorus]
Eternal dark i will descend
Where there is light i am the end
Cause in the shadows of the night...
Witness the dying of the light!

Its secret warns the blood is spilled
You reap what you have sewn
The kings send mortars to their deaths
From high atop their thrones
Behold the wasteland
Where no more life exists
Welcome to the world you have created

[Chorus]
Eternal dark i will descend
Where there is light i am the end
Cause in the shadows of the night
Witness the dying...
The dying of the light!

The earth opens beneath your feet
Unleashing FIRE... AHHHH!!!

From the books the word is spoken
At last i have been made whole... AGAIN!

Dying... Dying Light!
Witness the dying of the light... LIGHT!!!!
You've brought back what was once concealed
And now... Your fate is sealed!
