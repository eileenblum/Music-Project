No... this can't be happening
Trying to forget, what I've become
Why? I fight with all my strength
But still the scars remain
Still they remain...
Searching for something that I will never find
How... was I so blind?

Another life is washed away
Nothing is left but pain
There is no change
Time heals nothing
Scars! 
Scars remain
Scars remain
Scars remain
Time heals nothing

Pull me from the gutter, away from all the lies
I cannot face reality, the fear that grows inside
My heart is rising, and soon it will turn black
Once I step across that line there's no way to turn back
Rolling in the vomit, the blood and the filth
Blinded by the alcohol, the drugs, and the pills
I fight another battle, the violence begins
The enemy is me, so how can I win?

Another life is washed away
Nothing exists but pain
There is no change
Time heals nothing
Scars!
Scars remain
Scars remain
Scars remain
Time heals nothing 

Rise out from the shadow
Leave the old self behind
Within lies the strength
To triumph, above all
Above!
Rise!
