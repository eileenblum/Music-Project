I can't believe what I see
What happened to society?
Can you believe what you see? No!
The time has come to raise your voice, now
We're so sick of all these lies
That show their face with no disguise
Fighting wars across the sear
But back home, the bank owns me
That ain't right!

All these wolves don't want you free
So there you are with your TV
Watch the news and be afraid
Should they tell you who you should hate?
Well...
Doesn't matter what you believe
It looks the same when you bleed
It's one dimension
One dimension! One dimension!
Whoa-oh
One dimension
Under the sun
All are one
They're tearing us apart and it's only just the start
And they say who lives or dies 
But they don't know who we are
ONE!
Only one!

Hey man, that ain't no solution
Judge, jury, execution!
Doesn't matter what you believe
It looks the same when you bleed
It's one dimension
One dimension! One dimension!
Whoa-oh
One dimension
Under the sun
All are one

Makes no difference what you believe
Cause tonight everyone bleeds
For one dimension
One dimension! One dimension!
Ohhhhh yeah!
One dimension
All are one
All are one!
