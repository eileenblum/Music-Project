Drowning! I descend
Sinking endlessly
A light is shining from somewhere far below
A pale glow reflecting
From lost temples of stone...
A thousand years
Since the day they saw the sun
Secrets of Atlantis, forgotten no more
Far, far beneath the ocean
The temples are emerging
And the monuments arise
Leviathan approaching
At the coming of the tides

Out from the depths
Out from the depths below
We drown
Drown

Titans walk upon the earth again
Skies are cracked, the sea rushes in
Cities fall beneath the surging tides
The ancient gods shall rise

Out from the depths
Out from the depths below
We drown
Drown
