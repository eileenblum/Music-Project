Coming to your town tonight
Another day out on the road
We're turning up the power
Gonna make some heads explode... RIGHT!
Then we're outta here!

Volume screaming through the air
Heads start to collide
There's gonna be a meltdown
Maximum overdrive

They came to us and asked
What the hell we're doing here
We're gonna play it loud
And drink some shitty beer!
YEAH

IRON, IRON CITY!
IRON, IRON CITY!
ALL RIGHT!

The show is done
The gear is packed
And now it's time to rage
I think I'm seeing double
So now there's twice as many babes, ha!
They came to me and asked
What the hell I'm doing here
I said just shut your mouth
And drink your fucking beer!

OH
IRON, IRON CITY
IRON, IRON CITY
YEAH
IRON, IRON CITY
HEY
IRON, IRON CITY
YEAH!!!!!

IN... IN GOD WE RUST!
