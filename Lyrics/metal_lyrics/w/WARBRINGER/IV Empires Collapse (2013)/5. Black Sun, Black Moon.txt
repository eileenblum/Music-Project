One thousand miles of highway, and zero points of light
The road stretches before me, no end in sight
I tear across the valleys dividing space and time
I look upon this world and I know that it is dying...
A new sun rises
Another...
Descends into the night, at terrifying speed
Smoke rises from the desert
As the lines begin to bleed
Together in the blackness
With presences unknown
Another thought is in my mind
But it is not my own

Desolation
Isolation
Behold the ascension
Of a new star

I need to find the key
Unlock the hidden door
And lift the veil so I can see once more

Across endless deserts
Beyond... the skies
Black sun, black moon
Rising hiiigh!
