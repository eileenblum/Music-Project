Ultimate power
Is all that they crave
Taking everything away
We are enslaved

All consuming never ending reaching to the sky
Coils wrapped around the throne of lies

Towers... Towers!
TOWERSOFTHESERPENT

They speak with poisoned tongues
And think with poisoned minds
They seek the jeweled crown
And cannot be denied
The knife twists in my back
My mind under attack
The power over flesh
A gleam in the eye of set

Higher... Higher!
Tearing through the clouds
No end in sight
'Till all have bowed

Infidel defilers
Drown in lakes of blood
Witness your new masters
The men who will be gods

Towers... Towers!
TOWERSOFTHESERPENT

They speak with poisoned tongues
And think with poisoned minds
Their words will draw you in
Don't look into their eyes
The dagger in my back
The venom in my veins
Who controls the flesh
A gleam in the eye of set

A gleam in the eye!

Never turn your back
They deceive and they beguile
There is a way for every father taught
There are fangs behind each smile

I've seen the golden ages past
The glory days long gone
A nation hangs in tethered sorrow
Exiled from the sun
The vultures circle overhead
Towers that blaze with fire
Picking at the bones
Of our fallen empire
