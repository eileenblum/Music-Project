Hunter, seeker
A liar and deceiver
Hiding behind my sight
What is that sound?
From somewhere out there in the night

The darkness creeping in
It's watching from all sides
Cybernetic talons are reaching into my mind
Nowhere to hide

Hunter, seeker

I rise another day
I awaken as a slave
The eye is watching me
For my own security

I feel the wind across my back
I hear as the blade is drawn
Programmed to assassinate
A silent oblivion

Hunter, seeker

You are being watched
They are always watching, watching, waiting
The eye never sleeps, never
You are being watched

[Solo]

I rise another day
I awaken as a slave
Operation prism
Turned the world to gray

I feel the wind across my back
I hear as the blade is drawn
The knife is closing in
A silent oblivion

Hunter, seeker
