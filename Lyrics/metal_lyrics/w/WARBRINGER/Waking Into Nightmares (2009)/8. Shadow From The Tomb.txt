Forming vicious impressions of hate
Redemption of birth it is never too late
Enraging due to obliviousness
Anger from my catatonic state

Ferocious
Repulsion

Voices scream, mind erodes
Cerebral cortex shatters, explodes
Forcing my thirst onto the land
Will never be quenched by my raging hand

Atrocious
Nightmare

I will prevail
The beatings will never cease
I will prevail
The beatings will never cease

Don't give a fuck about the way of change
Until the voices find their peace
Bring me to annihilation
From your rehabilitation
Should've gave me stimulation

Took away my basic freedoms
Told me I don't fucking need 'em
Dope fed through television

The time has come, my conscious has told me to kill
The time has come, the weak submit to my will

A shadow from the tomb

I will prevail
The beatings will never cease
Don't give a fuck about the way of change
Until the voices find their peace

Tie up all the fucking brats
Children of aristocrats
Beat em' with a wooden bat

I show no remorse, women and children are first
I show no remorse, masturbate to the screams
of the cursed

A shadow from the tomb
A SHADOW!

AH

OH
