Indiscriminate killings
Lacking reason why
Hunting you down from the sky
A trail of destruction
Afflicting plague and strife
Leaving the sick ones to die

SCORCHED EARTH
SCORCHED EARTH

Without mercy, without regret
Got you in my sights for the kill
Pull the trigger and you fall
Cadavers of the slain lie there without number
I pile their bones into my throne
And drink from human skulls

SCORCHED EARTH
SCORCHED EARTH

Indiscriminate murder
Exterminating life
The masses cut down to size

Relentless shotgun violence
You're caught in the crossfire
Instant annihilation
Pierced from every side
SCORCHED!

Scorched Earth
Scorched Earth
