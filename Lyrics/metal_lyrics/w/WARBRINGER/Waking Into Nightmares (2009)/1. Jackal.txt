Born with the soul of a liar
A murderer, bred for the kill
Out from your mouth comes forth nothing but deceit
I want only to see it shut

After what you've taken away
There can be no forgiveness
An eye for an eye
Will make the whole world blind

Still I want you to die!
Tack back what is mine
Still, I want you to die
Thief who steals life

JACKAL!

You were the hunter...but now I'm hunting you down
You were a sinner...but soon you will sin no more
Cannot escape...I never rest, I never desist
Feel no remorse

You lose! I gain!
From all your suffering
Now your lying tongue has been cut out

Deed is finally done
What have I become
Hate what is myself
Two jackals burning in hell
