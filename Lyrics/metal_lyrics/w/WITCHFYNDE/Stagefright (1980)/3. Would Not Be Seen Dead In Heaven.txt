Well there's one place that I don't wanna go,
And even if I went there,
there'd be nobody that I know,
No, I can't see myself with halo &amp; wings,
I wanna go below where they do horny things,

You know, I would not be seen dead in heaven,
You know, I would not be seen there at all,
You know, I would not be seen dead in heaven,
You know, I would not be seen there at all,
Not a chance, no way, no how,

If heaven's so great, then why don't you go,
I'd rather fry, than be part of your show,
I'm not a little angel I never will be,
I'm not a little devil, not yet, but I could be,

[Repeat chorus]

Up there chasing pretty angels, is just no go,
Instead of arrows I'd rather shoot my cocoa,
Don't wanna join their choir, I wouldn't get far,
I'll form a helluva band, and play lead guitar,

[Repeat chorus]
