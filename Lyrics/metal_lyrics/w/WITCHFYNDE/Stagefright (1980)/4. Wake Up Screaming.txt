Evil eye I can't see why - I'm burning - burning
Timeless vault - here inside - imprisoned within,
Midnight phantoms - they tear apart - the edge of my mind - edge of my mind,

They're clawing me - Demon grasp - from a future time

Wake up screaming - every night - I'm screaming - screaming
Suspended here - rest of my life - between Heaven and Hell

I'm in flames - I'm in flames - go away - go away

[Repeat 1st verse]
