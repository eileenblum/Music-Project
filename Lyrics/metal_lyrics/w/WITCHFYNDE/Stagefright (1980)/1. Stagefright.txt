Hand at my throat, they're ready to strike,
I serve those demons buried alive, buried alive,
I'm just another victim to feed the night,
I need you - to survive,

Like a man possessed, still I search,
I steal, all that I will need, I will need,
I'll travel the four corners of this Earth,
Never to know - if I'll succeed,

The first notes of music, you're on the floor,
Spotlight taking hold of me,
But as the band give you more and more,
My eyes - no longer see,

Spotlight - stagefright
Spotlight - stagefright
Stagefright - fright

I hear my voice, it's not the one I know,
Forgive me, if I start to choke, I start to choke,
My neck feels tight, I try to turn and go,
I'm caught - by their rope,

The first notes of music, you're on the floor,
Spotlight taking hold of me,
But as the band give you more and more,
My eyes - no longer see,

Spotlight - stagefright - fright
