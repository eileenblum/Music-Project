See the moon above the stars
Bright lights shining in your eyes,
You're off on a night ride now
She's got us all hypnotised,

Have you ever tried to hold her
Could you gaze at her forever,
If you cross your heart of gold
She'll cross your palm with silver,

There's no reason to doubt it,
There's no reason to doubt it,
It's moon magic, moon magic,

Some night when you're all alone,
And the lights playing tricks,
Don't be afraid if you turn cold
You'll know it's only moon magic,

It's the force of the heavens,
Always looking after you,
Ask the man, Ask Isis,
It's moon magic, it's nothing new,

[Repeat chorus]

Moon, moon, moon magic
