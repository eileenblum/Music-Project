Everybody's out tonight
They look so happy,
All having a good time
Wish it could be me,

Even now I remember
What I want to forget,
Keep telling myself now
It was all for the best,

Am I doing the right thing,
Can't make a mistake,
Am I doing the right thing,
Don't say that it's too late, too late,

I just sit here waiting,
Feeling like I used to do,
It's cold outside and it's raining,
But I want to come and see you,

How could I let you go
Say goodbye so easily,
The best love I've ever known
I need you beside me,

Am I doing the right thing,
Can't make a mistake,
Am I doing the right thing,
Don't say that it's too late, too late
