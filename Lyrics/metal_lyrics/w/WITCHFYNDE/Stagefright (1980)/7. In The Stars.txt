Does your head rule your heart
Are you lucky in love,
Do you look to the devil
Or the heavens above,

Well you know there's a chance,
That your dreams will come true,
Just wait for the sign,
And it will happen to you,

Do you believe what you read in the stars,
Do you believe what you read in the stars,
I'll tell you all of the secrets
That you'll ever want to know,
Do you believe in the stars,

Do you live by superstition
Would you be number 13,
Do you trust in this magic
Or only what you've seen,

Is it just make believe
To live forever more
Oh gaze into the crystal
Then you'll know for sure

[Repeat chorus]
