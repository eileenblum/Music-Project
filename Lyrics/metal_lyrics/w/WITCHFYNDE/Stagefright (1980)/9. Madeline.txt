If most things don't last forever,
Then don't want to believe,
'cos always thought we'd stay together,
I felt you really loved me,

Madeleine smile, let me love you Madeleine,
Don't cry, let me hold you,
Madeleine smile, let me love you Madeleine,
Don't cry, let me hold you -

Remember the time I walked out,
And just left you left you crying,
I know it looked as if I didn't care,
But deep down inside I was dying,

[Repeat chorus]
