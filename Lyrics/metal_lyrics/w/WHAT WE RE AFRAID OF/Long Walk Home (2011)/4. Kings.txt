Would you crown me king if I sold mine out? Lines of kings for miles, all
claiming revolution, beheading my brothers and sisters. But, when all is said
and done, we've just reached the beginning, as long as we stay the path. Now,
there can be only one they call king, and I'll give Him praise that we bear His
name. We will be men without a finish. So, "off with his head," 'cause I'll
never fall in line.
