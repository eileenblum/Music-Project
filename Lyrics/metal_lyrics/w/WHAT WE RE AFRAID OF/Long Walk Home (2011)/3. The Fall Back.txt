Sheep will turn to wolves as the last of our kin fade out, just like a ship
that's lost its anchor will float away. Keep that lighthouse in view.
Everything with matter holds weight, but that doesn't mean it's not
transparent. You know black from white and left from right. Witness the ocean
in its fury. Back and forth, the crashing waves erode cliff walls. Don't make
the mistake of hitting the rocks. That harbor light has been there the whole
time. You're the ship. Come claim your anchor.
