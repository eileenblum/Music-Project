Through this, we're saved; with blood on our faces. "Religion is flawed because
man is flawed, including this one." Show me the difference between my angels
and my demons, for pitfalls are often confused with safety nets. Sometimes your
world must be shaken in order for the dust to fall. And, once again, we fell
asleep in the lion's mouth. Trade back the laws for love. Oh God, this story
has no end. We've turned what's pure into a diluted mess. Please forgive us
all.
