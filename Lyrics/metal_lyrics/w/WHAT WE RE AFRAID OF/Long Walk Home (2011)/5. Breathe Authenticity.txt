Show me something real, 'cause up until now it's been shadows of what should
have been. Make no mistake, we need a firm place to rest our feet. So, why do
we float through space, disconnected from waking life? Face facts, this is
paper thin. The current's demanding, swim sideways; search for the shore.
You're worth more than this.
