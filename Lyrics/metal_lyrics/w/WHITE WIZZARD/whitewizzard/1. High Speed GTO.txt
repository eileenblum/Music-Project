I thought I knew you
But mind negates the soul
My heart's spinning round
Like a thousand times before

It's been so long
I feel I shouldn't leave
So instead I'll take a ride
I JUMP INSIDE

Soarin' in a High Speed GTO
Holdin' onto what I used to know
Rollin' like a madman down the road
Wishin' you were here like once before

I still feel you
Underneath my wings
It's too bad 'cause
Now we're far between

No pretending
I can't take this no more
So now it's ending
I'm out OUTTA SIGHT

Soarin' in a High Speed GTO
Leave it all behind, I don't care no more
Rollin' like a madman down the road
Life unchained I'm leavin' you stone cold

So glad I got away
No way I'm gonna stay
There's nothin' you can do
I'm movin' fast â I'm leavin' you
