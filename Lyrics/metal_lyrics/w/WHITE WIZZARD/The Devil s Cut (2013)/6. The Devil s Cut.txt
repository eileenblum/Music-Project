[Verse 1:]
Metal surge roars out loud
With that awesome magic sound
Radio waves of electric power
Spreading all around

Thunder rolling in your ears
As the music lights the sky
Super sonic waves of light
Like a demon riding high

[Pre Chorus:]
POWER IN MY HEART
OCTANE IN MY VEINS
FUEL MY INNER FIRE
FLY AND BREAK THE CHAINS

[Chorus:]
VINYL CRACKING HURRICANE
IN A SURGING SONIC SEA
A DEVILS CUT - TO SET MY SPIRIT FREE

DON'T NEED NO GOD OR RELIGION
OR A GHOST UP IN THE SKY
MUSIC IS THE TRUTH THAT FLIES ME HIGH

[Verse 2:]
Into your mind comes the fire
To give you will to live
The truest art that can inspire
The purest gift to give

So fire the engine
rocket off to the highways of the night
star crossed comet racing fast
Bathed in the musics light

[Bridge:]
KALEIDOSCOPE
COLORED MIND
ANTHEM CHARGE
NO LONGER BLIND

RACE ACROSS THE SONIC STREAM
BANGING IN YOUR HEAD
RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL RISE A LIGHT
THAT NEVER WILL BE DEAD

TRUTH AND FIRE
BURNING REAL
THAT NO GOD
CAN EVER STEAL

IN THE LIGHT OF MUSIC'S ENERGY HOLD
THESE TRUTHS SO DEAR
THINK FOR YOURSELF AND IF EVER WEAK
BLAST ELECTRIC SUN INTO YOUR EAR
