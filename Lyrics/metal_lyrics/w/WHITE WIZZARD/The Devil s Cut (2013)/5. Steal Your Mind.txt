[Verse 1:]
Music plays-across the airwaves
Sinking teeth into your brain
Demographic hypnotized
In a trance and mesmerized

Lost Minds-in an altered state
Zombified with no soul
Don't let yourself fall to this fate
Stand up and fight for control

[Chorus:]
DON'T LET THEM STEAL YOUR MIND
STAND YOUR GROUND AND BE TRUE
THE TRUTH INSIDE YOU FIND
WILL BE THE LIGHT THAT GUIDES YOU THROUGH

[Verse 2:]
The beast it feeds upon the weak
With crosses and dreams to sell
Manipulation of the meek
Religious vipers push heaven and hell

Everyone will try to control you
Tell you how and what to do
Spit in the face of those that try
Break the chains let your spirit fly

[Bridge:]
THINK FOR YOURSELF AND DON'T GIVE IN
OR LET MACHINES EAT YOU WITHIN
THE SOUL IN YOU IS ALWAYS TRUE
GUARD THE LIGHT INSIDE OF YOU
CHAINS INSIDE WILL FALL AWAY
CAST ASIDE THE DARKEST DAY
IN THE SUN THE BEAUTY LIES
LIKE A PHOENIX YOU RISE

TO FOREVER BE
OH OH OH INTO ETERNITY

OH OH
DON'T LET THEM STEAL YOUR MIND......
