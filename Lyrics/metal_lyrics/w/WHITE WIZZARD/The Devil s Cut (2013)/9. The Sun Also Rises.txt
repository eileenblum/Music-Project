Seeking hope within the darkness of death
In the dusk of life's crimson sunset

[Verse 1:]
As the moon is rising
Tears shed crimson rain
Your soul now in the heavens
Far above this pain

[Pre Chorus:]
SEEKING ANSWERS ALL AROUND
I PRAY TO SKIES WITHOUT A SOUND
CANNOT SEEM TO FIND OUT WHY

WE ALL MUST TAKE THIS BITTER PILL
TO LIVE A LIFE WITH DREAMS FULFILLED
ONLY THEN TO WATCH IT ALL FADE AWAY
AND DIE

[Chorus:]
EVEN WHEN THE LIGHT WITHIN US DIES
THE SUN WILL STILL AGAIN SURELY RISE

[Verse 2:]
Your life burned like a candle
and dreams provided flame
Your story but a memory now
To the stars I scream your name

[Pre Chorus]

[Outro:]
I feel your souls twilight
awake in the heat of the night
Set in motion to take flight
You're forever burning
Like a comet racing fire
Burning skies to inspire
Stars above elevate you higher
To the heavens you fly

after image of your life
a picture that I hold so dear
forever locked inside my heart
How I wish you were still here
Your flesh has died but your soul lives on
Inside my heart your beating strong

Your memory burns in me so strong
For your light my soul it longs
In spirit we shall never part
Our journey written in my tears
The sky is dark as I seek your flame
To the stars I scream your name

On the darkest day when the light inside dies
The sun will still again rise
When we need the strength to face another day
The rising sun keeps hope alive
