[Verse 1:]
I was born of stormy skies
power of life burned in my eyes
now destined to rule the night
When I touched the magic string
power to make my spirit ring
Now.......I hold the light

[Chorus:]
IT'S LIKE LIGHTNING IN MY HANDS
AN ELECTRIC SUN AND STEEL
TO BLAZE ACROSS THE STARS
LIFE IS ALL I FEEL
MUSICAL BOXES CHIMING SOUNDS
AMPLIFIED ENERGY UNDERGROUND
I AM INSPIRED TO STAND AND RISE

[Verse 2:]
Now I ring the magic chord
Rock the metal overlord
God in every note I play
My fingers tap the rocket fuel
ignite the fire in me and you
ringing light into the darkest day

Magnetic pulse in a silver sun
Bringing light to everyone
Sun in my hands guides the way
