[Verse 1:]
Chasing the eye of a hurricane
a storm rider running free
Light the flame running high octane
Blasting across the sea

[Pre Chorus:]
METEOR SHOWERS IN THE SKIES
FIRE RED FLASHING IN MY EYES
LIKE A COMET IN THE NIGHT

[Chorus:]
LIGHTNING STRIKE ON SATURDAY NIGHT
STORM CHASER ON AN ENDLESS FLIGHT
ROCKING HARD INTO THE CITY LIGHT

BLAZING FIRE ON A CRAZY TRAIN
HOT LIQUOR RUSHIN' THROUGH MY BRAIN
FIREBALL RED BLAZE TIL I GO INSANE

[Verse 2:]
Tornado twisting power surge
Cloud bursts shake the ground
Rocketing high across the stars
Supersonic sound

[Bridge:]
STORM RIDER RIDING HIGH UPON THE BLOWING WIND

SILVER SURFING THE SKY
SUPER HERO NEVER GIVING IN
