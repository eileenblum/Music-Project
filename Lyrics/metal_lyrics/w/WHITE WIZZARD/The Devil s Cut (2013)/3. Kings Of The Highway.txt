[Verse 1:]
Riding down the boulevard
Leather angels rocking hard
Aces held within their metal hearts

Smell of smoke and gasoline
As the motors burning super clean
Born to lose and feeling extra mean

[Pre Chorus:]
DREAMERS JET FUELED FLIGHT
CHROME REFLECT STARLIGHT
IN THE MYSTIC NIGHT
METEORS BURN BRIGHT

[Chorus 1:]
THE KINGS OF THE HIGHWAY FLY
FISTS HELD TO THE SKY
OCTANE GYPSYS RIDE THE WIND
RUNNING FREE UNTIL THEY DIE

[Verse 2:]
Wind races across the plain
As the desert sands reflect sunrise
Rolling lost horizons flicker by

Easy riders make time pause
Rebels without a need or cause
Live to ride under a jet blue sky

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus 2:]
THE KINGS OF THE HIGHWAY FLY
THEIR FISTS HELD TO THE SKY
OCTANE GYPSYS RIDE THE WIND
RUNNING FREE UNTIL THEY DIE

THE KINGS OF THE HIGHWAY RIDE
THEY RULE THE STARRY NIGHT
DREAMERS ROLLING TO THE SUN
LOST SOULS ARE BURNING BRIGHT

[Bridge:]
BORN TO LOSE BUT NEVER GIVE IN
FREEDOM IS THEIR ONLY VICTORY
IN THIS LIFE THE ONLY WAY TO WIN
IS TO RIDE THE SKY AND LIVE YOUR
JOURNEY FREE
