Like a rose in winter
Cause your soul to splinter
Tear you down
Until your body cannot fight

So I carry on
Through the icy fog I feel the night
Though my journey's long
I'll fly the skull and bones and hold on tight

Haven't long to live before we die
Then suddenly we step into the night

Where shadows fool your eyes
We'll harken down the road into the night

With the broken back
From the heart attack
I've gotten on a road
And drag it down again

My colors fly ablaze
I find the longest days and make my plan
In solar heat of day
I lay these weapons down in bloody sands

Summoned to the dark by its command
It beckons you to step into the night

Only evil lurks inside
Where heroes run and hide

Into the night

Many times I've tried to fight
But heart is turned to right because
I step into the night

Where shadows fool you eyes
Only evil lurks inside
Where heroes run and hide
We'll harken down the road into the night
