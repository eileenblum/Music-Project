Into the line of fire
Demons passing
Bullets flashing by

Oh yeah
nanana nanana na oh

We're here to serve our country
We don't see why we fight
Now we're killin' innocent enemies
Is oil worth the price of life?

For which they cry

Into the line of fire
Demons passing
Bullets flashing by

Wow yeah

nanana nanana na

The pentagon goes hungry
This was a mighty price
The government just sits there watching
As mothers' sons prepare to die

[Chorus]
Freedom fighters
Storm the desert skies
Airborne soldiers
Fly on wings of lies
Ordered by a bastard
Filled with pride
Purge a race
With fire and genocide

Into the line of fire
Demons passing
Bullets flashing by

[Chorus]
