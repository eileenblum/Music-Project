Denizen of creep seas
Born of ancient depths is he
From the world of heinous beasts
Beady eyes a thousand teeth

On the horizon
A mighty fin appears
Screaming to all
The creature of the sea is near

Twisting and thrashing
The necks of his prey, yeah
Death to all
All who dares cross his way

Across the land
Beneath the sea

Now the water clouds and rain
Mass of blackened cartilage

Savory feast is wrought with pain
Creature turns and strikes again
Stomachs drifting guts and fins
Eat your heart out from within

Jawing the flesh from the life of his foes
As he brings a taste of the terror below

Across the land
Beneath the sea

Flashing in and out of sight
Death upon the sea tonight
Bones afloat on murky stew
Hope for life is leaving you

Bound to be a stomachful
Crushed inside his giant skull
Caught amongst the horror stench
Tender finds are no defense

And before the time he strikes again
For now you'll know
That death is certain, yeah

Carry on you won't survive your destiny
Megalodon
Nightmare running after me

Across the land
Beneath the sea

Now the water clouds and rain
Mass of blackened cartilage
Bones afloat in murky stew
Hope for life is leaving you
Flashing in and outta sight
Death upon the sea tonight
