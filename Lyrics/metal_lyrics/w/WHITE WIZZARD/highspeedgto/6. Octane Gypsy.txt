Open road â now it's time to fly
Shifting gears â I'm free to ride the sky
Need for speed â it's time to break the chains
Adrenaline â the fuel inside my veins

[Pre chorus]
I'll try to beat the sands of time
I'm gonna shift into over drive

[Chorus]
Octane gypsy â you're the baddest motor king
Octane gypsy â feeling mean out on the scene
Forging power between the wheels
Metal heart of iron and steel
Octane gypsy â you're my rock and roll machine

Winds of change â blowing in my hair
Electric ride â soaring through the air
Runnin' hard â I'm leavin' all my fears
Feelin' high â my freedom's finally here

[Pre chorus]
[Chorus x2]

You're the baddest motor king
You're my rock and roll machine!!
