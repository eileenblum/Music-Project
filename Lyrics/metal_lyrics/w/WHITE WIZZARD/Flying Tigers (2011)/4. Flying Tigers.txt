Into the cloudbursts
a liquid crystal sky 
Hells angels screaming do or die

Like sharks in flight
P-40's show their might
A razors edge
Speeds through the night

Wings of hope will rule the sky
Battle angels flying high
Bravado in their eyes...

Like steel dragons soaring ever high
Entering battle unafraid to die

Across the sky, soaring high
Still they ride, the tigers fly
War hawks fighting
so the dream can stay alive

Into the fire fight
the battalion rages on
Surgically striking to the dawn

Sunsets behind them
knowing they will die
They carry on into the crimson sky

Blood of heroes running strong
River of hope - an anthem song
Still the band played on

A bond of brothers
In a field of hopes and dreams
Lives forever changing history
