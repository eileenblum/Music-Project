Man prays to the sky searching for an answer
Glass reflects a soul searching for truth
Conflicted by evil running in his ancient veins
history of his past troobled with pain
Demons on his shoulder dancing with temptation
To walk the road of greed like many before
Light he feels inside his soul seeking revelation
Hiding in the shadows of violent wars

Screaming at the sky
Why must all men die
Where is eternal life
Is there a god in the sky an almighty on high

Praying to the stars he sees a Light so bright
flickers like a candle in autumn moonlight
Brings an image of a man a son of the Gods
Hoping he can save his soul from being lost

Praying tp the skies
Lost men blind their eyes

We all seek a messiah to show us the way
A Lord on high to take the darkness away
Where is the light that we seek
Lost in the void as our minds grow weak
Forever lost in a quest to be reborn

Where is our star man's son
Our god - our chosen one
Will he save us all
Or have we missed the call

There is no messiah or king on high
The only answer remains in you and I
We must join to rise up and quest to be free
So love can conquer-fulfill destiny
Our light will shine and live to carry on
We shall illuminate burning so strong
A new sun will rise up into brighter day
Hope forever living on truth lights the way
