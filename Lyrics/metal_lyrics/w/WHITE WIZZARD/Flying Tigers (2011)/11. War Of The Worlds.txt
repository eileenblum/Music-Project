Shot down from above
Deadwing black dove
Demonic blitzkrieg fire
Dark Deadly funeral pyre

Valiant me would fight to save
and guard the fragile light within us
On the wings of angels - they will fly
Risking their lives to saw us

Fire fight in the sky
So many more to die
Atomic clouds and fire
Now blackened everywhere
