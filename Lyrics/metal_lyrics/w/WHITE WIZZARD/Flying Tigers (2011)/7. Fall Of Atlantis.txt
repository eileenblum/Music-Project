Alien ships race from dark empire
seeking utopian eden
crashed to the earth in a ball of fire
Forever bound and imprisoned
City was built under crystal sea
So would rise a society
Alien race that sought freedom from
The dark beings and evil ones

Arise - City undersea
Atlantis came to be
In magic ocean spray
A brighter day
But darkness awaits - at hell's gates
Death would arise bringing their demise
Soon all were dead - aliens are bred
Man would arise - the immortal soul will die

Demons imprisoned bang on the gates
Souls of the damned are screaming with hate
Smelling the blood of these souls of light
Hungry to rape them and take their lives

In the desert plains demons ride
Calling for the dead to rise
Trumpets blow and serpents glide
Souls of light meet certain demise
Evil free to rape the light
A new race conceived in the night

To the city now they ride	.
Stallion of fire on deadly stride
Harvest souls - one by one
DNA of the chosen one
Now the light they manipulate
sewing in the seeds of hate
