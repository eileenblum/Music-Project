Driving west on the boulevard
watching the sunset in the sky
Good times all around me yeah
I'm feeling free and flying high

Girls dressed to kill walk by
as the moon is rising
Streets alive with the glitter
of hopes and dreams
and fantasizing
The Santa Ana
winds are blowing
through my soul
Makes me want to
lose all self control

The rainbows rocking and
the boys are ready to go Oh Oh...

Rocking in the streets
and I'm feelin' alright
My soul is a rollin' in the neon lights
Riding the stars on a West LA night,
West LA night
The place where rockers used to rule
You still hear that magic sound
An earthquake of those crazy times
Shakes it's energy all around

Everyone gambling one more time,
shooting for a royal flush
Magic flowing through your veins
in the night you feel the rush
Dreams are always golden
and they always shine
City of Angels you'll
always be mine
