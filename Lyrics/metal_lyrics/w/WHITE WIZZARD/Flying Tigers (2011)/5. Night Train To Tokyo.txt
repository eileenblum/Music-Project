Walking streets on a summer night
See her there under neon light
Lipstick, Leather, Silky skin
My body burns My head it's spinning

Possessed by fire - I can't control
Feel the devil - in my soul
Demon prowler - takes my mind
In the night - I'm gonna make her mine

Oh she's got me, Yeah she has me
Chasing her down like a crazy dream
Got me spellbound, spinning around
Mind turning evil, the devil inside yeah

She's a dynamo
In the fires of sin we go
and she's swinging low
On the night train to Tokyo
Night train to Tokyo

Lookin'at the girl with jade green eyes
Puts me in a trance and mystifies
Night wing lady riding the wind
Dressed to kill and in for sin

Going down the alley
My midnight goddess
Walking in the shadows of dark abyss
My love is ready to strike her down
I creep up as she turns around
Pulling her close I bring her in
Kiss those red lips taste like sin
Submissive angel going down
Dreams of love as we hit the ground
