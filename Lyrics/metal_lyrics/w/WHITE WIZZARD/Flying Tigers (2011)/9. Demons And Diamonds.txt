[Part I]

Floods and famine rape the dusty land
Devils orchids bloom in desert sands
Power dynasties and monarchies
Shaping the new worlds destiny

Kings and Queens wage bloody wars
Power and gold still seeking more
Enslaved by greed and tastes of sin
The new world order shall begin

Light that once was inside of men's souls
Black with greed and demonic control
Dark alien looks on from afar
Awaiting the rise of the seventh star

[Part II]

Demons scream as seeds are sewn in sin
Men enchanted by the devil's grin
Blood on the hands of all now sets the stage
Eve of a new time and of a new age

Religion and power a dark possession
Gods and idols a lost obsession
Seeking a key the gates of Babylon
Demons took man on a carpet ride
Diamonds blinded him from the divine
Forever a slave the curse goes on and on

Men consumed as lust for power grows
Storms of war bring forth a blackened rose
Centuries pass the song remains the same
Men still chasing Gods with different names
