Now comes an age when men will seek the stars
From andromeda to fire red sands of mars
Pyramid eye seeks realms beyond the sun
Searching to find a God-a chosen one

Stars possess the minds of men
Seeking answers in the sky
Conflicted in his alien blood
The beast inside shall rise

Thirst for greed and power now mans fate
as the seeds are sewn by fear and hate
Men forever cursed in lust for Gold
The serpents rise - the power takes it's hold
