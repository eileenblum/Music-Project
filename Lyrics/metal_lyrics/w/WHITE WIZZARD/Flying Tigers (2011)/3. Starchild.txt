An angel of my dreams you are
A song of sirens evermore
Blessing for my weary soul
Beautiful star child I adore

A love so sacred in your eyes
Sent to me by Gods on high
Forever the one I shall embrace
Seeds sewn in eternal grace

On dragons wings
We touch the sky
Because this love we have can never die
Forever on high we climb
Forever you and I

In your eyes I have found honesty
In your voice I hear a calming sea
In the light of truth you shine so bright
A beacon of hope in the misty night

In my darkest hour you came my way
Color these shadow shades of grey
Giving me light for a brighter day
On stardust our souls will fly away
