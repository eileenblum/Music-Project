Oh father where art thou soul
Was it left on the battlefield...
Awash in deadly waves
A soldier's fate was sealed
Oh lord where is your light
Would you shine it for me to see?
To men who died on front lines
We owe our freedom eternally

Fearless
God willing they sail away
To fight for a better day

Giving life for freedom for all that live
And die in the USA

Marching into fire
Eagle soaring higher

They
Set out
To fight
For truth
God speed will see the raiders through

Brothers
Taking an oath to fight
For what they know is right
The gods hold candles for them
Burning flames on horizons so bright

They shall stand tall and rise
Bringing freedom for all
Stoking the flame and guiding with its light
Burning liberty through the darkest night

The sun will guide them home
The sun will guide them home
As they march out of the fire
Blood-soaked fists raised high

Bullets fly
Exploding sky

Freedom forever
Never surrender
America - still stands strong
Red, white and blue
Standing so true
All as one - under the sun
To those that died
Standing with pride
Never forget - blood of heroes
Band of brothers
Marines to the death
You left it all - on the killing fields
