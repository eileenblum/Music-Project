Corporate politicians
Pig head kings and queens
Taking you for a ride
Illusion behind the scenes
New world order rising
Coming to eat your brain
Whore us all to the machine
We're all lost and insane

Straight to hell
We all nosedive
Shifting gears to
Infernal overdrive

On and on
As the beast grows more
Brainwashed fools lost in nevermore
Wake up see before too late or the
Evil machine will own your fate

Thinking we have a choice
Lost in constant lies
Reality is all gone - and now here come the flies
Mired in our shit
Lost in computer screens
Ignorant fools here it comes
The evil war machine

Straight to hell
We all nosedive

See them
Illuminate the disguise
Take your
Soul right from under your eyes
