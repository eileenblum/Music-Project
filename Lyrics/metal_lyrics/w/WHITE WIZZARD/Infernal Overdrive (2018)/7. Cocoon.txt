Moonlight
Sparkles on the dewdrops
Pearls of life
Star bright
Angels soar above you
Metamorphosis

Ashes
To dust now into Pupa
To be reborn
Chrysalis dimensions
Colors rush
Your wings firelight

Death shall not be the end
Your soul now dances in the moon
From ashes you now transcend
Spreading wings from the cocoon

New life
Butterfly violet orchards
Heaven's sunrise
I feel
Your heart is beating in me
Forever and ever

May your colors always paint the skies
And wash the pain in my eyes
I pray to see your soul's return
Torching the skies with a fire that burns
