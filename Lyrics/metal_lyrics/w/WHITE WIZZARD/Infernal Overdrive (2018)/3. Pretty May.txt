Pretty May took the needle and she blew away
Took a shot stop the pain to a better day
Run from shadows haunting her in the night
Opiate to launch a final flight

I know your soul is crying
And I know that you long for another
Way to feel
And I know your heart is dying
Oh hey hey don't let go pretty May

Surf the sky feel a high up to the moon
Feel the stars burn a bigger rush coming soon
Dance away the pain running straight to the sun
Burn your tears and disappear
