My soul into hibernation
Growing into new rebirth
Manifest reincarnation
To rise up from a sleeping earth

With wings of fire I am reborn
My soul of light into the sky
The snake charmer sings me higher
Into new dimensions I fly

Arise the gods to bless my flight
See me through on blue starlight
Finding my way to new lands
Power of the night in my hands

My time has come
Deaths grip undone
I am now one
With stars and sun
