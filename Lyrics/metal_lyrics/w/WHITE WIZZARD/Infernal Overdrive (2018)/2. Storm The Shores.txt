Sail away
Sail away
Forging ever onward
Into the seven seas of death

Forward - the overlords
Firing their guns
Into the seven seas of death

Don't let their glory fade
O the sacrifice they made

Storm the shores with cannon shell
Where the bloody heroes fell
Eagles fly into the mouth of hell

Fighting in the jaws of death
Smell of horror on Satan's breath
Battle cry at the gates of hell

Flashing bombs fill the air
Gunners ripping without care
Blood-soaked never showing fear

Plunging in the blackest smoke
Right through battle lines they broke
So darkest time can swing its final stroke

Don't forget the price they paid
Or the sacrifice they made
