[Part 1 - the quest for light]

The trail begins to dark
Into the forest I hark
Echoes dance but no return
Seeking a distant child
Magical and running wild
Lost answer for which I burn

Seeking eternal flame
She's the one with n name
Dream manifested in my mind
To fall in trance entwined
Arms wrapped in velvet twine
Eternally bonded for all time

Hands of time race across skies
Illusions tears burn my eyes
Losing faith in finding her
Colors of life begin to blur
Road of hope left unpaved
To this quest I am enslaved

Beauty chasing in the night
Lost love blinded by its light

To stars I pray to find
Spirit to be my guide
Are you just imagined too
To find the final rhyme
Lost somewhere in time
A love I seek that is so true

Running into abyss
Seeking a lover's bliss
Euphoric spell from just one kiss

Melting the candles red
Spell cast wake the undead
A love that cannot be unwed

Lost in the rhyme
Somewhere in time
I must fly away
On angels wing
Lost love I sing
Siren to the sun

[Part 2 - a galactic dreamscape]

You are the nighttime in my mind
Escape within a velvet moon
The angel holds us in his light
Soar on a rainbow's misty flight

Until the gods will
Show their face
We sing a song out into space
Illusions of time flow their sands
Passing magic stardust
Through our hands

Now we are sunbeams in god's eyes
A spirit sprite shall be our guide
The life force lightning in our souls
Galactic sun burning black holes

Soaring into crimson night
Magnetic energy and light
Transform as one illuminate
Reincarnate reborn we are as one

[Part 3 - final requiem]

Star light star bright
The dragon's wings in flight
Twilight tonight
Our fusion will ignite

Power power
Our love will set the stage
Devotion emotion
Our souls become engaged

We fall into the trance of mystery
The love we found fulfils our destiny

The illusions that I fear
Still haunt me everywhere
But when I stare into the
Dancing light
Now I see you there
