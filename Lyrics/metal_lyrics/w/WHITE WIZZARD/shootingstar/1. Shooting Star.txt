[Verse 1]
See the dragon's tears that fall
For the one that brought such light to all
In a flash of dawn you rode the wind
Into the sun to a higher call

Your voice a siren in our hearts
An eagles flight that soars so high
A mystical place within us all
Where magic and dreams can never die

[Chorus]
YOU NOW FLY IN A BRIGHTER SKY AND YOUR MAGIC WILL NEVER DIE
A MEMORY BURNING IN OUR HEARTS-A RAINBOW RISING HIGH
FORGED OF STEEL IN THE MIGHTY POWER
OF METALLIC ELECTRIC GUITAR
YOUR SONGS FOREVER BURNING BRIGHT
IN THE LIGHT OF A SHOOTING STAR

[Verse 2]
Metal Gods can never die
You'll always be flying high
Now were all stargazers
Watching you rock with the Gods on high

Up above there's now a rainbow
As your soul soars rocking in the skies
In the light of your song the magic lies
So every day the sun shall rise

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

LOOK TO THE HORIZON AS THE COLORS SHINE SO BRIGHT
MEMORIES THAT STILL REMAIN BURNING IN THE NIGHT
RAINBOW EYES LOOK UP THROUGH TEARS
AS THE ANGELS SING YOUR SONG
FOREVER ALIVE IN THE SOULS OF ALL
YOUR METAL HEARTS STILL BEATING STRONG!!

UP IN THE HEAVENS
I SEE A RAINBOW
THE SUN IS RISING
YOUR SOULS NOW FREE TO RIDE THE SKY...
