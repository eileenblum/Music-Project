The wizzard steps into the light
White dragon standing by his side
Dark sorcerer summoning demons
On wings of blackest angels he shall ride

On through the night
Killing the light

His sword is raised into the sky
Thunder of the gods in on his side
The dragon spits his fire into the night
Sorcerer of hell will fall and die

The wizzard screaming retribution
Dragon spreads his wings in victory
The darkened land now burning bright
Surrounded in a brilliant neon light

Into the sun
We are as one
