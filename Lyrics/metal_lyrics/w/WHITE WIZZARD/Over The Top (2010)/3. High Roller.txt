[Verse 1]
Roll the dice â Feelin' good tonight
Loaded and high rollin'
Blackjack gun â shootin' 21
Whiskey river flowin'
Roll through town like a stone
Playin' another show
On the run â A demon's son
Comin' to steal your soul!

[Chorus]
Shooting stars blastin' through your town
Fueled by the devils fire
Light the sky â Now we're gonna fly
Fills you with desire

Rollin' through the night

[Verse 2]
Good times metal blasts away
Ready to take over
In your head flames burning red
Spell taking you over

In a trance â You start to dance
I'll be your star tonight
Taste my sin â Crank it up to ten
Until the morning light

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Come the dawn I have to go
But I'm still lovin' you
Songs entranced â Deep in your mind
A spellbound witches brew

In my dreams â I'll see your smile
Burnin' like a flame
I'll be back again next year
Callin' out your name

[Chorus]

Rollin' through the night [4x]
