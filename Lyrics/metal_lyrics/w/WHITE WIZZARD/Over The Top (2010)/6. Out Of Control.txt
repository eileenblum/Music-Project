[Verse 1]
White Wizzard's here to rock you all
In a raging metal storm
Riding on the second wave
Of a new electric storm

Rebel souls and rivet heads
Will make the hammer fall
Break the chains and go insane
Heavy metal is the law!

[Chorus]
Lets Go!
Hail Rock and Roll
Metallic overload
We're gonna spin your soul

Out of Control!

[Verse 2]
In '79 we were left for dead
A new movement was born
Neal Kay â Saved the day
Air guitar's in a crazy swarm

Lightning strikes the same place twice
It's coming back again
The Earth will quake to make your ear ache
Now crank the amps to ten

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The anthems sound a new rebirth
A sonic blast across the Earth!

[Verse 3]
Motorbikes and muscle cars
Will own the roads again
Leather spiked denim warriors
Dirty women dressed to sin

Get on your feet and march in the street
Shout at the devil proud
Storm the gates in a bloody rage
Stand up and scream out loud!
