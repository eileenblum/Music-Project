[Verse 1]
Bonded and bound â We fight for metal
Brothers in arms â We swing the axe
Chained armor and platinum sword
Riding on a serpent attack

[Bridge]
Legions â Of Hell
Angels â Of Light
Stand â Up for metal
Stand up ready to fight

[Chorus]
Can you feel the strike of the viper
6-6-6 [2x]
Come and join the cult of the snake
Satan's calling you
Come and join the legions of Hell
Fight to keep it true!

[Verse 2]
Devil dogs and sordid sinners
Blackened whores enslave the night
Demons dance as the moon is rising
Witches dance by hells starlight

Fireballs of molten metal
Meteor flame across the sky
Rocketing to another dimension
The dark angels wings fly high

[Bridge / chorus]

[Verse 3]
Wasted youth bring the rebellion
And the power of the night
Anthem of the revolution
For the light of truth we fight

Blood brothers bound together
As one we'll ride the wind
Metal soldiers marching into fire
Now the movement shall begin
