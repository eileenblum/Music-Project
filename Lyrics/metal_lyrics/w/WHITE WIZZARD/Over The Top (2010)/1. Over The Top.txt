[Verse 1]
On the horizon
In the killing fields
You have to fight to carry on
Look to the starlight
See your destiny
Never give up the will to be

[Bridge]
You're gonna make it â You've got the fire
Flames of your destiny â Burning with desire
You've got the dreams â You're burning higher
On wings of steel you soar to heights that will inspire

[Chorus]
OVER THE TOP!
The magic in us all that will survive
The fuel that drives to keep the dream alive
Over the top

[Verse 2]
Out in the cold night
And on the darkest day
You have to fight against the grain
Look deep inside you
Find out what is real
Honesty and truth will be revealed

[Repeat verse 1]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
