[Verse 1]
Out in the city â On streets of fire
I feel the power of the night
Fire and octane â Leather and metal
I'm burning under neon lights

[Chorus]
I'm shifting gears to ride the sky
My metal heart will never die
Forged in the fires of hell â My pistons fly
40 deuces running high

[Verse 2]
Dark dirty women â Whiskey and cold gin
Getting high and never coming down
My engines fire â Fueled by desire
Like lightning striking all around

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
Set 'em up and knock 'em down
Rock the night away
Deal the cards â Roll the bones
Lady luck will find her way

[Bridge 2]
Buy the ticket â Take the ride â Pedal to the floor
Gonzo lust for life â Kick ass! Alive forever more!!

[Verse 3]
Out on the pavement â I'm burning rubber
Good Time Overdriving to the sky

Into the sunrise â I'm riding shotgun
Devil driving â Never gonna die
