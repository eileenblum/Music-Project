[Intro]
Rock on! Live free! Or die!

[Verse 1]
Patriots of freedoms fight
We the people shining the light
Illuminate our dreams in neon nights

Free to be who you want to be
From sea to shining sea
United in truth and destiny

[Bridge]
Rock on and live to fly free
And you'll be...

[Chorus]
Oh...
Fly high â High in the sky
Live Free or Die!!
YEAH!
Live Free or Die

[Verse 2]
Fly the flag and fly it proud
Scream for freedom â Shout it out loud!
We are the keepers of the dream

Land of the brave â Home of the free
The light of lady liberty
A beacon of hope and unity
