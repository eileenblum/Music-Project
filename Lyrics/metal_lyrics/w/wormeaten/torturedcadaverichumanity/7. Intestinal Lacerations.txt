INTESTINAL LACERATIONS.
My skinconsumed by putrefaction, my opened injury.
INTESTINAL LACERATIONS.
I feel a barbed wire torturing my stomach,
I have vomit in my face,
purulent tears in my eyes and green blood in my body,
this is my slow agony, hunger.
Rats are my food,
horror is my only memory,
suffering was my childhood,
hunger is my history,
death and torture are my destiny,
rats are my food, horror is my only memory,
suffering was my childhood.

I feel a barbed wire torturing my stomach
I have vomit in my face and purulent tears in my eyes.
My stomach is rancid flesh
And I'll die today
I feel a barbed wire torturing my stomach.

INTESTINAL LACERATIONS.
