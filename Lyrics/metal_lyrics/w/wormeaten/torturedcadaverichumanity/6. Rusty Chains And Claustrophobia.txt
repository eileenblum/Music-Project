Corpses and moans stuffed in four asphyxiating wall shouting without being listened to;
pleading for fresh air.
The eyes of their freedom only can see rusty chains.
In their fleshes there are pus and infections.
Locked up and hit - the rats begin to devour their fleshes.
Dirtiness begins to dry out their corpses covering them with repugnance.
Their injuries are filled by mud, their minds are flooded with panic.
Light doesn't exist to them, just the isolation and dirtiness.

Asphyxiated victims by the claustrophobia, pleading for their freedom.
Asphyxiated victims by the claustrophobia.

I hate this fucking reality.
I feel devoured by Worms of hate
I don't want to see more torture!
I don't want more insanity and shouts.
My mind will exploit in desperation.
Really I hate this bastard world

Asphyxiated victims by the claustrophobia, pleading for their freedom.
Intensive pain, claustrophobia, mud, rats and chains
Isolation, shouts, fear, insanity, asphyx.
Shouting without being listened to;
pleading for fresh air.
