The repugnant smell of the rotten flesh,
broken bones, melted skin,
blood spilling in the walls
Pale and cold faces of pain
brutalizeds, grounds without mercy
slowly quartered
The echo of their screams
the memory of their lives all their horror
and suffering torture me.
Ground human flesh
I still see the explosion of their blood
I still see them shouting by the pain
They are putrid flesh and the vultures eat their putrefaction
And worms enter to my mouth
Ground human flesh
