Scenes of violence, brutal deaths,
blood and suffering
The bales get in victims' heads destroy the brains and melt the skin
Their amputated arms with unmerciful rifle gunshots
Their legs exterminated by the mines
Their opened chests, with removed organs
Their blood-mixed with carrion visceras are covering the floor.
Bloody barrels, goreality;
Brutality disfigured men repugnance and brutality in the children's eyes dismemberment in their minds.

DISMEMBERMENT

They are crying cadaverine, vomiting
worms and I have worms on my hands
