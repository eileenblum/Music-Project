A long time ago, death wishes are born
Now it's time to destroy them wishes of death,
Pleasure of blood, sick mind, total insanity
Absense of mercy, rotten fellings rotten brains
The voices say now it's easy they will be yours,
Rotten fellings rotten brains;
Now it's locked your wormeaten body, whip your skin,
Your rotten soul, tied extremities, your rotten flesh popped eyes
Your rotten mind spread the venom in their flood
They'll suffer slowly, add lethal poison wait and after enjoy,
They are rats they will die,
Bastards they will die, rubbish don't think more about it,
Kill, do it now; they are rats they will die
Bastards, they'll rest in peace rubbish don't think more about it
Kill, do it now, tied extremities, your rotten flesh popped eyes
Your rotten mind, fucking mother,
Terror and hate in their faces, in their bodies;
Fucking sinner
Thief of innocence, without soul beach mother
