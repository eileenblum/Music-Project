Advance!!! Advance!!!
Spear!!! Spear!!!

Brights, our swords will spirt blood of the  enemy
Do not delay, brothers in arms
Wodan's fury took hold of us
Your sons, like the Ulfethnar

We don't feel pain
Will not arrest
Until the foreign usurper will drown in
blood and mud

That black horde smells of incense
Shines gold and jangle with clarion bells
That black horde rises 
high in the sky its symbol of oppression (symbol tyrant)

we see it
as they saw it our fathers
and their fathers before them

Here is that advances 
Soaked with a belief away our land
That white vexillum will not make us bend down
Now that's finally com e down to us

PARTE DI ARPA:

They speak of sempiternal lands
Where Christ's light kiss in the same way the oppressor and the oppressed
Where forgiveness is given to the unjust
The whip is bathed in the blood of the righteous

Why this gruesome fate?
Powerless again until the fading of the days

Urd, she who weaves the source and not decreed the end

Verdandi, fateful (fatal) fate have brought us
But what was now is

Skuld, We hide in shame more awry (pronunc."r(u)ai")
or with glorious limelight in the halls of our fathers, 
head-on we will be welcomed as guardians of the ancient wisdom
