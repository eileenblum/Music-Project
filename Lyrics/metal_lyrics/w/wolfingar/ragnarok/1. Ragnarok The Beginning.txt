Age of swords, age of axes
The fate of war awaits
Human, wolves against themselves
Before the end of us all

Einherjer, hand of the gods
Kneeled before the golden Kidskjalf
Einherjer, there's a war to win
Let the battle begin!

Snow of this winter
Will cover the earth
Snow will darken the light
Time of wind, time of wolves
Before the universe's fall
No mercy, nowhere to run
Stars fall upon us all

The wolves run, devour the sun
The chains are broken, the flames are stoken
This night won't be overcomed
Wish of the norns will be done

TIME HAS COME
BLACK IS THE SUN
HEAR THE CALL
TIME HAS COME
BLACK IS THE SUN
READY FOR WAR!!!

Blood paints the shade in the dusk of the gods
Before the battle of asgard
Shields will be broken, hopes fade in the dark
Whispers in silence and sorrow

TIME HAS COME
BLACK IS THE SUN
HEAR THE CALL
TIME HAS COME
BLACK IS THE SUN
READY FOR WAR!!!

Blood paints the shade in the dusk of the gods
Before the battle of asgard
Shields will be broken, hopes fade in the dark
Whispers insilence and sorrow

Blood paints the shade in the dusk of the gods
Before the battle of asgard
Shields will be broken, hopes fade in the dark
500 warriors will open the gates of Valhalla
