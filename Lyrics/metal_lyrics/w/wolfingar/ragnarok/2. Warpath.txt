One winter, legions came
Killed my breed beneath a frozen rain
for foolish pride
THEY'VE BEEN SACRIFIED
Human passion never stay
It doesn't even matter if you pray
I won't deny
STOLEN INNOCENCE

This is a story about a man
robbed of the greates wealth he had
in the first century, the converted romans
killed the pagan enemy
in the name of the crucified nazarene,
but now one of those pagan
is looking
FOR VENGEANCE!

Battle shields and thunder on a spear
AGAIN! PAIN!
screaming for agony!
fight 'till the end of the days
when Valhalla's doors will be opened wide on my soul!

I've seen men bleeed victims of a senseless destiny
once again
i've seen men fall
i cried runes carved for them all
deep in my soul
painfull memories

painfull mamories! [con vocalizzo]

Battle shields and thunder on a spear
AGAIN! PAIN!
screaming for agony!
fight 'till the end of the days
when Valhalla's doors will be opened wide on my soul!

No tears anymore!
I will deep my hand in Christian Gore!
I'll slay them all
That's my offering!
Ancient Spirits by my side
I will soon be here to hear their cries
I'll see their eyes
when they all will die!

Vallhalla awaits me!
(I) can feel my people watching me
again! AGAIN!

Blood still flows into my veins
wishes of vengeance suffering and pain!
they are calling my name

calling

my

NAME!
