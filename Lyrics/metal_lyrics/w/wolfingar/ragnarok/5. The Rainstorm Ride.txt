[Tutta growlleggiata esclusa la parte melodica]

King of lonely mountain (you were) 
the austere king of your treasures 
The king under the mountain

Proud and haughty, the shining armor by the skill of your ancestors
The thick and long beard tucked into the belt
Wielding the mighty ax you protected your silent palace

Elapsed the day
Elapsed the night
The wind changed
The air was dark and dreary
A long scream
the army impend over
clothes with steel breastplates, the long sword hung from his belt.
the kingdom of the past is risen again!!!

Dark clouds slipped fast in the sky
The highest peaks lit by the roar of thunder
The black horde advancing with the wind swirling
Hint of death, their rotting breath
Rode wolves
Rode wolves

The alliances lost reconciled 
between the echo of arrows and the screeching of metal on the black blood

Elapsed the day
Elapsed the night
The wind changed
The air was dark and dreary
A long scream
the army impend over
clothes with steel breastplates, the long sword hung from his belt.
the kingdom of the past is risen again!!!

[Inizio parte melodiha]

Sussurrato - (âIf more of us esteem  food, fun and songs over the treasures of gold, this would be a happier worldâ¦â)

Old and stingy (greedy) war has slipped away like rain and blood on the metal of our swords and armor 
Never again, my brother, you will slide dying in the mud 
Grab my hand
Under that single banner
Because I will never cease to scream at my enemies 
Together, now
Weâll go forwards without delay, brothers of this beloved land

King of lonely mountain (you were) 
the austere king of your treasures 
The king under the mountain

Now rest
The eternal sleep will rule your golden palace
The time of treasures is over
The swords will sheate again and the blood will washed away
The rainstorm is coming!!!
