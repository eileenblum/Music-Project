Long is the way
With the breeze upon the sail
Sea is our past
Weâll be back to the bay we left
We rule the tide
We have sailed with the swords beside
From frozen fjords
To the End of the World

We passed the storm
For the will of the mighty Norns
Pursuing a dream
Under a frozen wind
Many have gone
For a journey with no return
Bound to the sea
But now weâre free

I wonât die like a man in decay
Runes carved for me will remind you my name
Give me back on a ship to the sea
Weâve been so far but now we are...

Vi drÃ¸mmer on nordiske tiger
vi drÃ¶mmer on nordiska tiger
Unelmamme on pohjoisen tiiker
We are back to the north lands
