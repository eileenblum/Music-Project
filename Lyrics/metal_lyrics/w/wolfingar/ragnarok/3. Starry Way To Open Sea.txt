Arise! Brothers
Set sails under breeze
Proud navigators
Bound to sail across the Sea
Waves' clamour
Plays the farewell symphony
Longships are leaving
Built for glorious destinies

Bright comets
Chase each other by the way
Northern Wind's breaths
Push the ships out of the bay
Odin! father
show the secure course to sail
Guide us through the mist
And the fury of the waves

Still we sail
On our way
Many days

Leave the shore
Lightnings fall
Out with tide... we go!
Violent storm
Thunder roll
Out with pride

We don't know where we go
Wealthy shores that we'll find
Make us bound to unknown
We sail blind through the storm

Till the night fades away
Starry brights light the way
Sullen roam, lands forlorn
There we've gone, far from home

Black Ravens
By the course to Vinland's bay
Follow the ships
Through the vesper's distant blaze
Flames waver
In a starry open sky
Mould the horizon
Make the darkness move aside

Now, brothers
Comes again the time to leave
Far and beyond
Sail to meet our destiny
Death, reather
Than a life too long for me
My own desire
Is a starry way to open sea

We shall sail another day
Through the ocean's froze waves
With the mist and thunder's rage
Reach the glory

Wait for Morn to let us leave
Under Rain and stormy breeze
Pass the whole eternity
By the northern sea!
