I've seen the wonders of this world,
I've heard the music, the choirs
That even angels could not even have thought of,
Born in the soul and the tears and the essence of our lives,
Destined to be forgotten when the time has come.

Haven't you seen these men
Waging war on their brothers?
Haven't you seen these men
Dying for the glory and the power?

It's much too late
To hear the prophet's cry in our heart.
It's much too late
To prove that we were right from the start.
It's much too late
To save what we've been fighting for.

We feed the hope of our lives
With the same old ephemeral quests
And glorious dreams and ordinary lies.
Now tell me, what are your glory and your power worth
When a child is dreaming in your arms?

I've seen so many people landing their hand to me,
Trying to help as much as they can the child that I used to be.
How can it be that someone dies under our eyes
While we move on pretending to be blind,
Living in our own paradise?

How can it be that people are dying right under our eyes?
Haven't you seen these men daying so far away from our heart?

It's much too late
To hear the prophet's cry in our heart.
It's much too late
To prove that we were right from the start.
It's much too late
To save what we've been fighting for,
What we've all been fighting for.

We feed the hope of our lives
With the same old ephemeral quests
And glorious dreams and ordinary lies.

We feed the hope of our lives
With the same old ephemeral quests
And glorious dreams and ordinary lies.
Now tell me, what are your glory and your power worth
When a child is dreaming in your arms?
