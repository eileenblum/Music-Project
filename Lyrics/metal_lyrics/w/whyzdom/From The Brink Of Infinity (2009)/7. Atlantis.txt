I was born too soon, eager to enter the world.
I grew up too fast, I forgot to be a child.

This is a race against time I have to win,
Don't stand in my way tonight.
Whatever the price to pay
I am the runaway, runaway.

I tried to fly away but forgot I had no wings.
I tried to reach Atlantis but forgot I had to breath.
I tried to touch the fire but I got my fingers burnt.
I tried to win the race against time but forgot the one I loved.

I was thirsty for freedom, thirsty for love and passion.
I ran away trying to find the answers to ridles torturing my mind.

Appearances and attractive colours
Don't try to deceive my eyes.
Now I need to cut off the strings
That are tying, tying me down!

I tried to fly away but forgot I had no wings.
I tried to reach Atlantis but forgot I had to breath.
I tried to touch the fire but I got my fingers burnt.
I tried to win the race against time but forgot the one I loved.

This is your way, this is your life,
This is your voice, this is your choice.
This is your way, this is your life,
This is your voice, this is your choice.
This is your way, this is your life,
This is your voice, this is your choice.
This is your way, this is your life,
This is your voice, this is your choice.
Haven't you heard the deadly siresn call?
Haven't you heard the warning sings at all?
O Mother, please, forgive me!

I can still hear my father, unable to see the light in my eyes.
O Mother, forgive me,
How could I be blind to your own tears?

This is my choice, my fight, my struggle for life,
I will hold on against all the winds.
Whatever the price to pay
I am the runaway, runaway.

I tried to fly away but forgot I had no wings.
I tried to reach Atlantis but forgot I had to breath.
I tried to touch the fire but I got my fingers burnt.
I tried to win the race against time but forgot the one I loved.

I tried to fly away but forgot I had no wings.
I tried to reach Atlantis but forgot I had to breath.
I tried to touch the fire but I got my fingers burnt.
I tried to win the race against time but forgot the one I loved.

I tried to fly away, to reach Atlantis
(To reach Atlantis).
I tried to touch the fire but I got my fingers burnt.
I tried to win the race against time but forgot the one I loved.

This is a race against time I have to win,
Don't stand in my way tonight.
Whatever the price to pay
I am the runaway, runaway.
