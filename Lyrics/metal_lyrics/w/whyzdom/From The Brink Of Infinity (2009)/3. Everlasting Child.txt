You left me in and endless garden
With blossoming flowers and the wind
Singing throught the leaves
And the trees and the branches.

You gave me my heart,
You gave me my senses,
The laughter, the joy and the love.

I turned them to black,
I turned myself to darkness.

I am your blood,
I am your flesh, your spirit,
Your everlasting child.
God, why have you left me here?
Why did you turn your back on me?

I saw through lies,
I learned to read between the lines.
I reached the other side of the sea,
I touched the moon, the starts,
The skies and the mystery of life.

You gave us a life
Growing up in my belly,
My heart and my soul.
Now don't pretend he's yours!

I am your blood,
I am your flesh, your spirit,
Your everlasting child.
God, why have you left me here?
Why did you turn your back on me?

You gave us a child
Growing up in my belly,
Growing up in my heart and my soul.
He's forever mine and I am his
Till the end of time.

I am your blood,
I am your flesh, your spirit,
Your everlasting child.
God, why have you left me here?
Why did you turn your back on me?

I am your blood,
I am your flesh, your spirit,
Your everlasting child.
God, why have you left me here?
Why did you turn your back on me?
