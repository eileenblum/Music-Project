We, the people, we've been so proud
Of our cherished freedom.
We, the people, we claim our right
To spoil the riches of this world.
We, the people, we are so sure
Of our convictions
While the Earth is bleeding.

But anger is roaring in Mother Nature's heart,
Chaos is just waiting to spread over the land.
The time has come to reap what has been sown
By humankind.

We, the people, we've been hiding
Behind a wall of lies.
We burn candles
To ease our conscience blind.

Why are you closing your eyes?

Is there a god watching us
Spoiling the beauty of his Earth?
Can you hear him crying?

The Devil's laughters are filling up the skies.
A whirlwind is howling to celebrate the rise
Of Mother Earth's righteous wrath
And the fall of God.

Blood! Anger!
Blood! Anger!
Chaos!
