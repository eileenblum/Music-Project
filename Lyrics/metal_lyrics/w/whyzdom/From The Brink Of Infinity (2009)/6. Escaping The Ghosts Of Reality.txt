Just saved when you were lost,
Waving the world goodbye.
Just lost when you were saved,
You've got to face their eyes now.

You've got to find a better way,
You've got to hold on and face the devil's eyes.

I've run for so long now
For so many years.
Even remembering my own name
Is so hard to me.
I've run for a thousand years
And I can't even remember
Where I'm heading to.

And though my footprints in the sand
Are now the only proof that I am alive,
Unconsciouly I try to leave as many as I can.

Just saved when you were lost.

I'll find a way, I'll find a way
To reach out through the dark.
I'll find a way, I'll find a way,
I'll find a way
To break the silence through the night.

Just saved when you were lost
Inside the maze of your mind.
Just lost when you were saved,
At last finding your way back.

You've got to find another way,
You've got to hold on and thwart the devil's plans.

No one seems to really look into my eyes.
How can they be fooled by my diguise?
It's like a weird theater where I'm surrounded by mannequins.

Every word that I say sounds so meaningless to me.
Every blink that I make has its own purpose.
It's like a huge theater and I am surrounded by mannequins.

Just saved when you were lost,
Don't let the years go by.
Just lost when you were saved,
It's not too late to come back.

You've got to find another way,
You've got to fight and exorcise the pain

I'll find a way, I'll find a way
To reach out through the dark.
I'll find a way, I'll find a way,
I'll find a way
To break the silence through the night.

I'm so alone.
I feel so cold.
I've lost my hope.
I'm so afraid
Of you.
Escaping fromthe land of my dreams.

Back again in my home,
Far away from the chains
That I'll leave behind:
That's where I want to be.

I am escaping from my ghosts and illusions,
The wind of freedom in my face.
Escaping the ghosts of old friends and enemies.
Wait for me, I'll be there with you!

Escaping the bonds of all my childhood fears.
Wait for me I'll be there with you!
