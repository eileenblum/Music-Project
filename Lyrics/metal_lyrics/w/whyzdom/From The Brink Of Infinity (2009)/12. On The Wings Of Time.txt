Never look into the mirror
Unless you're ready to face the crude reality:
Just close your eyes and let it be.

Years are lingering across my cheeks,
The fear of time slowly passing by
Hidden in my eyes.

Tears are falling upon my hands,
As dry as the desert under the burning sun,
The left on my lips, the taste of sorrow and pain.

Time will spread its wings and fly
Like an eagle through the winds.
The tide will wait for me until I'm ready to be free,
To be free (to be free), to be free.

Through your fingers
Time is flowing like a river to the sea,
Just like those tears from your eyes.
Through your fingers
Your life is flowing like a river to the sea,
Just like the lines of your hands.

I can see a young girl that I will not ever be again.
So hard to think that she was me,
So fragile and innocent,
Looking for shelter in the wrong arms,
Breaking the bonds that helped me not to stumble and fall.

Time will spread its wings and fly
Like an eagle through the winds.
The tide will wait for me until I'm ready to be free,
To be free (to be free), to be free.

Through your fingers
Time is flowing like a river to the sea,
Just like those tears from your eyes.

Through your fingers
Your life is flowing like a river to the sea,
Just like the lines of your hands.

Your youth will fade away
Like the echoes of singing bells in the dark.
Your memories will turn as pale
As old photographs loosing theis colors
As time passes by.
How long will it last?
Only a fool would say.
Never look into the mirror
And listen to the bells of oblivion.
