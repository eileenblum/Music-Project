Every morning there's an old man in the park
Sitting on the same old wooden bench,
And all the birds are flying around his head,
Singing again and again.

He's gathered all the breadcrumbs he could find
In his bag to throuw them all away
To his only friends.

Sometimes I can see there's a tear in his eye
And then I can feel the burden
He's been carrying for so long within his heart.

The old man in the park did not come this morning.
I wonder where he's gone now.
Will I ever see him again?
And now I'm missing him
Like a wise old friend gone without farewell.

And when the rain is falling down in the park
I still can see his shadow through the dark
Proudly standing in the wind.

Sometimes he seems to be smiling at me
Watching over me throughout my life,
And it's been soothing me,
Like the touch of an angel.

The old man in the park did not come this morning.
I wonder where he's gone now.
Will I ever see him again?
And now I'm missing him
Like a wise old friend.

The old man in the park did not come this morning.
I wonder where he's gone now.
Will I ever see him again?
He used to shine so bright
In his daughter's eyes.

The old man in the park was my father,
He died so many years ago
Leaving nothing
But sadness in my heart.
And I'll be mourning him
Until my dying day.
