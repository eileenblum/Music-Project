Freedom, freedom,
Freedom, freedom, freedom.
Freedom, freedom.
Can't you hear our call?
Freedom...
Such a hopeless word
Turning in our soul.

Improbable freedom.
The words that are turning in your head,
Are they yours or theirs?
Impossible freedom.
The hope that we buried in our heart
Will survive our soul.
