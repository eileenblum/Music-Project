There are shadows around me
And a void inside my mind
There's a black sky through the window
And no star to guide me
Through the night

I am sitting in this howling train
And we're diving in the dark
And my own voice won't be heard
When I try to ask where it is leading us all

Is there someone around here
Tell of are these souls alive
Or only faint ghosts of an ancient past
Tell me am I just another one?

O please someone now tell me
Are we all just the same
Are we just all lost here in this train
In a tunnel with no end

My heart is strong
Much stronger than theirs
Can't you hear it?
My heart is strong
Much stronger than theirs

I am running through this crowed train
Trying to find reason and rhyme
No I won't give up tonight
No I won't let my life slip through my fingers

Can you hear a distant call in the night
It just awakened all my senses
It's my own voice celebrating
All the gods, the devils, the spirits
I've been denying

Is there someone around here
Now I can see it in their eyes
They're only faint ghosts of an ancient past
I'm gonna get out of here and live

O please someone now tell me
Are we all just the same
Are we just all lost here in this train
In a tunnel with no end

My heart is strong
Much stronger than theirs
Can't you hear it?
My heart is strong
Much stronger than theirs

Give me back the light of the sky
Give me back the warmth of my heart
Wake me up from this nightmare

In the cold I will rise
I will draw tears from your eyes
Myself myself, will shiver and thrive
Myself myself, slyly warpped
In the mist of the night

Not now, it's too early
Don't tell me I already reached my destination
I want to stay here! I want to stay here!

Gloria In Excelsis Deo
