DIES IRAE! DIES ILLA!
Calamitatis et miseriae
Dies magna et amara valde

Take my hand and dance with me
Let us now defy the shadows that we used to be
Let us now ignore the turns of fate
Together again

Tell me about your life your sorrows
I want to know your deepest thoughts
And your wildest fantasies
Now it's time to share your burden
With me tonight

The spirits of the night are welcoming us
The spirits of the night are sheltering us
From the crude cold light
They will dim the colors of reality

I'm the Daughter of the Night
There's no way out of my grasp
I'm the Daughter of the Night
Just come and rest in my arms
Sweet dreams and nightmares are my realm
Nothing seems impossible
If you give me your hand

Shapes and shadows and distant voices
Way too far from you
To hear your desperate silent call
Faces you can't even remember
Are just want I want you to see

It's not a game there's no prize to fight for
It's just a choice
And I am of no help in guiding you
You mus cling to a hope
Or join us in the abyss

Where the spirits of the night
Are welcoming us
The spirits of the night
Are sheltering us
From the crude cold light
They will dim the colors of reality

I'm the Daughter of the Night
There's no way out of my grasp
I'm the Daughter of the Night
Just come and rest in my arms
Sweet dreams and nightmares are my realm
Nothing seems impossible
If you give me your hand

I'm the Daughter of the Night
Sweet dreams and nightmares are mine
I'm the Daughter of the Night
And I'm holding you in my hand
I'm the Daughter of the Night
The sweetest confessor you will ever find
Now tell me about your pain
Your sorrows your life
Before I read them myself from your eyes
