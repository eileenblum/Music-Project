[Music &amp; lyrics: V. Leff]

Deus Dominus
Sanctus spiritus
Occulta tuas lacrimas
Deus Dominus
Misereatur nostri Dominus Deus
Where are the angels of Destiny

Lost in an endless nightmare of pain
Wherever I turn my eyes I see children slain
Hate and despair has spread in our hearts
Fire is raining down over humankind

Where are your trumpets
To overcome these walls
Where are your miracles,
And the hope we're dying for?

Where are your angels of Destiny?
Where are the Saviours of your soul?
Where are your white Wings of Mercy
When you're lost in despair
While blood is pouring down
Like red rain all over the world?

We spoiled, we looted the treasures of Earth
Soiling, corrupting anything that we touch
We turn our eyes from the seeds that we sow
Knowing the harvest our children will have to reap

Mankind is bound to
Vanish from the Earth
Too late to shed our tears
Satan's waiting for the feast

Where are your angels of Destiny?
Where are the Saviours of your soul?
Where are your white Wings of Mercy
When you're lost in despair
While blood is pouring down
Like red rain all over the world?

Where are the angels
The saviours of our world?
Where are the angels
The saviours of our souls?
