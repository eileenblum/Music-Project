[Lyrics: V. Leff, music: M. Ruhlmann, V. Leff, R. Morin]

There's a jar hidden in the shadows
Waiting in the silence of the night
Pay attention to the writing on its side
Made of blood of suffering and of lies

Have you felt its call in the dark
Have you heard the hoarse breath of hell's guards
Have you seen the darkness kill the light
Have you felt destruction and death inside?

Never trust the gods and their angels
They like to play with your desires and your life
They put a deadly toy in your innocent hands
Scoffing at you as you opened the jar of lies

Pandora's tears have fallen on the world of my dreams
Pandora's sin has seeped into the blood of our veins
Pandora's legacy is carved in our hearts

Lying on the ground with that box in your hand
You could not read the warning signs at all
Â«Open meÂ» said a voice inside your head
Â«Let me grant you eternity and loveÂ»

It's a lie don't open that jar
Can't you see the obscene treachery of gods
It's a like don't you know what's inside
You're to unleash the curse of Human Kind

Too late, it was written in the stars
If only I could change the choices of the past
But you would be surprised
By what's hidden between the lies
Since hope remained hidden inside the cursed jar
