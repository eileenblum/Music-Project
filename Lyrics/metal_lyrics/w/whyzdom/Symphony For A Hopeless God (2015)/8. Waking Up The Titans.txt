[Music &amp; lyrics: V. Leff]

GaÃ¯a Ouranos Atlas Prometheus
Chronos Hyperion
Come to me now

Â«Viens avec nous
Viens donne-moi la main
Souffrir ne sert Ã  rien
Ton combat est vainÂ»

This battle was lost from the start
No truce with that enemy inside
I fought that war before
The same wounds
And the same deadly conclusion

Wake up! Titans by my side!
Break up God's curse of humankind

O hopeless world
O hated gods
O Wake up the Titans
Stand up and fight

The riddle was rigged again from the start
No key it's just an illusion
I've read this all before
The same book
With the same foolish stories

Stand up! Read between the line
Speak up! Reject all their lies

O hopeless world
O hated gods
O Wake up the Titans
Stand up and fight

Lost in a world between death and life
I'm not afraid of the darkest night
I feel so cold inside
I'm waiting for your light

I've seen their face of stone in the dark
I don't believe in heaven or hell
I lived that life before
The same Gods
With the same foolish beliefs

Wake up! Titans by my side!
Break up God's curse of humankind

O hopeless world
O hated gods
O Wake up the Titans
And let Gods die
