[Music &amp; lyrics: V. Leff]

Can you see the walls all around
Can you feel the strings right on your arms
Can you hear the roar of the crowd
They're all waiting for their dreams to come alive

Will you drink that bitter cup of wine
To the dregs of regrets remorse and lies
The air is cold and it's freezing your mind
The room is dark and you can see no way out

We lost the key
But still we're waiting
For the answers

We lost our words
But still we speak
And still we argue

We learnt to cry
We learnt to hide
We learnt to lie
We learnt to die

Take me away from this hideous madness
Far from the Asylum of Eden

We are all prisoners in a gilded cage
Waiting for our destiny
Betrayed by our beloved gods
Why should we care about what we'll become in the end
We have nothing left to lose and even less to gain

Can you hear that voice in your head
Telling you what to think, to feel, to say
Don't you know that you lost your free will
Long ago, thrown to vultures, gods and devils

Can you feel how they're controlling your mind
You're the toy of a temperamental child
But you're trapped with no hope and no way out
Welcome to the Asylum of Eden

We lost our mind
But still we hope
For our redemption

We lost our faith
But still we hope
For our salvation

We learnt to howl
We learnt to whine
We learnt to fight
We learnt to die

Let me escape from the walls
Surrounding my mind
Let me have a dream
That's really mine

We are all prisoners in a gilded cage
Waiting for our destiny
Betrayed by our beloved gods
Why should we care about what we'll become in the end
We have nothing left to lose and even less to gain

We lost our gods
But still we strive
To stay alive

We lost our dream
But still we're looking
For its meaning

We learnt to hope
We learnt to love

Let us deny the shadows
Surrounding our dreams
We will find a way to overcome our fears

We are all prisoners in a gilded cage
Waiting for our destiny
Betrayed by our beloved gods
Why should we care about what is to come in the end
We have nothing left to lose but forever hope remains
