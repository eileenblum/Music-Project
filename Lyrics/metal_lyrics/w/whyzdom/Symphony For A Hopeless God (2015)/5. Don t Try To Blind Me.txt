[Lyrics: V. Leff, music: R. Morin, V. Leff]

In a world drumming another beat
In a stride of a different pace
I can't believe in God my friend
I can't believe in angels
I'm not afraid of going to Hell

Don't try to blind me with your light
Don't need a god to lead me through time
Don't need a friend to cut through the night
Don't try to blind me with easy promises of afterlife

But strangely there's a void inside my mind
Nothing seems to help me fill the gap
I've lost my faith in God, disgusted by religion
I lost my hope in Humankind

Don't try to blind me with your light
Don't need a god to lead me through time
Don't need a friend to cut through the night
Don't try to blind me with easy promises of afterlife
