[Music &amp; lyrics: V. Leff]

Jour de colÃ¨re que ce jour lÃ 
Qui rÃ©duira la Terre en cendres

If there's a god somewhere in the skies
What does he think of the mankind he crated
If there's a god somewhere in this world
What does he think of those who kill in his name

Â«why are you killing each other in my name?
What are these words you say I did proclaim?
How did you think that you'd be saved on
The colour of your skin the colour of your heartÂ»

See the tears of a hopeless god
As he silently grieves in the dark
While we sowed the wind
We broke his very dreams
Too late the dice have been cast
It's all carved right into our hearts

If there's a heaven somewhere above us
Is it really worth the pain and the dead
If there's a hell somewhere below us
Is it really worse than the mass graves and the camps

How could you ever remain silent and blind
To the atrocities the torture and the pain
Why have you crated man in your own image
How could it justify the slaughters and the crimes

See the tears of a hopeless god
As he silently grieves in the dark
While we sowed the wind
We broke his very dreams
Too late the dice have been cast
It's all carved right into our hearts

Miscreatur nostri deus. Sicut erat in principio.
Et nune et semper et in saecula saeculorum

A seed of dream in a hopeless world
Has been carefully sowed in our hearts,
While we threw our beliefs to the wind,
And reaped the whirlwind.
Let's give it a chance to grow now.
Despite all odds we might rekindle a flame in the night.

See the tears of a hopeless god
As he silently grieves in the dark
While we sowed the wind
We broke his very dreams
But still inside our heart
A flame of hope is burning right here in the night
