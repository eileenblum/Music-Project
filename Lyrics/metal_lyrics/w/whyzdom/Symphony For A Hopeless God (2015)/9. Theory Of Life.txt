[Lyrics: V. Leff, music: X. Corrientes, M. Rouyer, V. Leff]

Theory of life, divine intervention
Of result of chance
Statistical happenstance?
Time after time I wonder why we're here
Lost in a world bound to collapse on us

Science â will you help us to survive?
Science â of destroy the Human Kind?

When I was a child I used to be afraid
In a world endangered by the reckless pride of men
In a world where profit egoism and thoughtlessness
Are a plague and the common roots
Of what they call Â«progressÂ»

Born in the wealth of our western world
I never suffered from hunger of from thirst
Closing my eyes I can't erase the pictures
Of suffering and pain of agonizing children

Silence â for the good of Human Kind
Silence â until the end of time

When I was a child I used to be afraid
In a world endangered by the reckless pride of men
In a world where profit egoism and thoughtlessness
Are a plague and the common roots
Of what they call Â«progressÂ»

Look at us now
Your own creation
How we grew up
Stronger than Gods and Devils

Theory Of Life,
Cradled by fear of death
We're mortal toys
In your hands.

Tell me it's not too late to change
The plot of that absurd tragedy
Don't tell me it's already sealed
Everything's written by the hand
By the hand of men

When I was a child I used to be afraid
In a world endangered by the reckless pride of men
In a world where profit egoism and thoughtlessness
Are a plague and the common roots
Of what they call Â«progressÂ»
