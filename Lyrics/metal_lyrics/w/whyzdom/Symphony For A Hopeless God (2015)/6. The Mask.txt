[Lyrics: V. Leff, music: R. Morin, M. Rouyer]

They've been cheating you from the start
How could you be so blind to all the signs
It was all written in their eyes
And now you stand alone and betrayed
By the puppeteers behind

They had it all planned in their mind
They virtuously played their favourite part
They sowed the doubt inside your heart
To isolate you from the real life

They show you nothing but a mask
Their beautiful words and their smile
Are nothing but a hideous lie
Oh they tell you all you want to hear
Now tear down their mask and let's see

You were too young much too weak to fight
So vulnerable fragile and innocent
An easy prey for those who feed
On the human distress of our lonely lives

They show you nothing but a mask
Their beautiful words and their smile
Are nothing but a hideous lie
Oh they tell you all you want to hear
Now tear down their mask and let's see

My heart is bleeding as I see
What you've become now they control your mind
Oh how I'd like to break the spell
And hold you tight again, my long lost friends

Now tear down their mask and come with me
