[Lyrics: V. Leff, music: M. Morin, V. Leff]

DÃ©mons Dieux et Diables
Idiles de pierre et de marbre
Le sang et les larmes abreuvent la soif de vos armes
Combien d'enfants faudra-t'il vous sacrifier encore?

Broken by a world that doesn't walk
The same pace as mine
Broken by betrayals, treacheries and lies
Broken by the fear of what's waiting for me
Beyond my terrestrial life
Broken by those one track minded moralizers

Can't we break free from superstition and lies
Why are these men putting
These strange ideas in their mind?

Let's play with fire tonight
Let's pretend we don't feel the burn of our skin
Let's play with winterly ice
Let's pretend we don't feel the frost on our lips
Let's play with devils and gods
Let's pretend men could leave religion to the past

Broken by puppeteers pulling the strings
From beyond the sky
Broken like a doll too worn and torn apart
Broken by the hatred and the howling injustice of men
Broken is the trust I put in Human Kind

Can't you see we are all the same in this world
Why do we need those crutches
To stand up and face our life

Let's play with fire tonight
Let's pretend we don't feel the burn of our skin
Let's play with winterly ice
Let's pretend we don't feel the frost on our lips
Let's play with fire and sparks
Let's pretend we don't feel the bite in our flesh
Let's play with devils and gods
Let's pretend men could leave religion to the past
