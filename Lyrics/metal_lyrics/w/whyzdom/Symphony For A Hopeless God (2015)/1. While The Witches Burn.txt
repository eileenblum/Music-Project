[Music &amp; lyrics: V. Leff]

While the witches burn
Sacrificed on the pyre of lies, ignorance and greed
Hide deep in your heart, your secrets,
Your thoughts and your life
If you want to stay alive

Be humble and submissive
This is your only right
Without a cry
Without a sigh
Without a word of pride

Be patient don't breathe a word
You are too weak to fight
You have no choice
You have no voice
You have nowhere to hide

[The Inquisitor:]
Â«Confess your sins Daughter
And now behold the Light
Let the Holy flames purify your soul
And pray our merciful LordÂ»

Don't let the Witches burn
Sacrificed on the pyre of ignorance and lies
Witches burn
Can't you see you're as guilty as their persecutors
Don't let them feed on your primal fears
Don't let them feed on the blood of innocence and tears

All my power lies
In the magic of bearing a child
In the magic of giving life.
Why do you hunt me down,
Perpetuate that ritual crime
Quenching your thirst for cries

Now look right into my eyes
I have no spell to cast
I am no witch
I am no devil
I am no slave of God

[The Inquisitor:]
Â«Confess your sins Daughter
And now behold your Lord
We'll break your resilience
No matter how long you fightÂ»

Don't let the Witches burn
Sacrificed on the pyre of ignorance and lies
Witches burn
Can't you see you're as guilty as their persecutors
Don't let them feed on your primal fears
Don't let them feed on the blood of innocence and tears

[The Inquisitor:]
Â«Confess your sins Daughter
Don't resist
You're a slave to our power
Granted by our Lord
We'll break your resilience
No matter how long you fightÂ»

Don't let the Witches burn
Sacrificed on the pyre of ignorance and lies
Witches burn
Can't you see you're as guilty as their persecutors
Don't let them feed on your primal fears
Don't let them feed on the blood of innocence and tears
