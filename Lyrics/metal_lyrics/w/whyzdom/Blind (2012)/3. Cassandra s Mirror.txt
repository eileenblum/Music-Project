My name is Cassandra
Iâve been foreseeing things for as long as I can remember
I saw my parents die
But there wasnât anyone to listen to the childrenâs tales
I saw my children die
Before I even conceived them

Donât cry, oh donât
Donât trust, your eyes

Iâm damned if I tell you what is written in the stars tonight
(Talk to me, talk to me)
Iâm damned if I donât try to ignore the lines of your hand
When I cannot read but sorrow and pain in your eyes

I met you once before
You were standing in the rain
Overhanging on the cliff of a distant shore
You asked me who I was
But the truth was in my eyes
And you knew it to tell well from the start
You are me and I am you
But years have been tearing us apart

Donât cry, oh donât
Donât trust, your eyes

Iâm damned if I tell you what is written in the stars tonight
(Talk to me, talk to me)
Iâm damned if I donât try to ignore the lines of your hand
When I cannot read but sorrow and pain in your eyes

I donât believe in you
Please stop talking to me now
I want to turn away
And be free to choose my path

I donât believe in you
Oh please now vanish from my dreams
I am just a child
And I will ignore your lies
