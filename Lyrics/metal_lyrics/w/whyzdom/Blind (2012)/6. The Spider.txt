âTrust me, open your heart to me
Trust me, feed meâ

She caught your mind in a endless game
She spun her threads all around your legs
She wove her web all around your arms
She drank your blood and fed on your soul

She hid herself in the corner of your mind
She shut your eyes to the colors of the light

Sheâs here, canât you feel her venom in your blood
Sheâs here, canât you see the strings that tie you down

The Spider is crawling on her web
She caught your mind, she trapped your soul
Youâre hypnotized, cannot withdraw your eyes from her
The Spider is patiently waiting for you to fall down on your knees

You shut the door to your real friends
You closed your eyes to dodge the lies
You drank the words she poured into your mind
You lost control over your life

You thought she wanted to guide you through the night
You thought it was the path towards the light
Look down, rosesâ thorns have fallen to the ground
Look down, canât you see your bare feet bleeding now

The Spider is crawling on her web
She caught your mind, she trapped your soul
Youâre hypnotized, cannot withdraw your eyes from her
The Spider is patiently waiting for you to fall down on your knees

âTrust me, open your heart to me
Trust me, feed meâ

You liked so much the sweetness of her words
You like so much the whispers of her voice
Look now, canât you see how you destroyed your life
Too late, there is no escape from the trap

The Spider is crawling on her web
She caught your mind, she trapped your soul
Youâre hypnotized, cannot withdraw your eyes from her
The Spider
