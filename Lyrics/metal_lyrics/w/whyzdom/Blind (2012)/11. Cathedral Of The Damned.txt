Domine, quare obdormis? Domine ne repellas in finem!
Domine, quare obdormis? Domine faciem tuam avetis!
Circumdederunt me gemitus mortis, circumdederunt me dolores inferni
Circumdederunt me gemitus mortis, circumdederunt me dolores lacrimae

Thereâs a secret fortress in the desert
Bathed in a golden burning sun
With a crackled earth and barely a sign
Of water ever falling from the sky
Will I ever find my way
Through the riddles and the trials

Holy cathedral of the damned souls
Iâve been searching for a sign
Holy cathedral of the tormented hearts
Iâve been looking for your shrine
Iâve been waiting all my life for the call
Of your bells, your choirs and your grand organs
Listening to the wind all around my heart

There are poisoned sources and illusions
Viciously abusing your mind
There are winged and frightened idols of marble
And men kneeling in front of their holy swords
But canât they see the blood
Still shining on their blades
But canât they hear the storm
Now rising above their heads
For we lost our souls
In the search of that illusionary shrine

Holy cathedral of the damned souls
Iâve been searching for a sign
Holy cathedral of the tormented hearts
Iâve been looking for your shrine
Iâve been waiting all my life for the call
Of your bells, your choirs and your grand organs
Listening to the wind all around my heart

Holy cathedral of the damned ones
Where do your bells and your spires hide?
Donât blind me with your lies
Holy cathedral of the damned ones
Donât let ambition devour my heart
And my soul

Holy cathedral of the damned souls
Iâve been searching for a sign
Holy cathedral of the tormented hearts
Iâve been looking for your shrine
Iâve been waiting all my life for the call
Of your bells, your choirs and your grand organs
Listening to the wind all around my heart

This is the last minute Cathedral
Right under my eyes
This is the last minute Cathedral
Right in my heart
This is the last minute Cathedral
Right under my eyes
With its deafening silence howling inside my heart

This is the last minute Cathedral
To light my wasted life
This is the last minute Cathedral
Turning to sand...
