When I was a child
I used to wish that I could fly
Like a bird from tree to tree
High above the land
Spreading my wings to feel the wind of freedom
Climbing into the clouds so white and so pure
Gently caressing my feathers and soothing my soul

But they broke into my dreams
Tearing all apart
But they burnt my wings
Pulling me down
And they shouted and they howled
To teach me their lies

I am the Paper Princess
So fragile and so sad
I have been crumbled
Iâve been torn by their lies
So if you take my hand
And if you dive into my eyes
Iâll welcome you
In my paper wonderland

When I was alone at night I used to wish that I could dance
With the flakes of winter snow flying all around
I used to play with immaculate unicorns
Riding across the grass, the fields and the streams
Waltzing with the leaves that fall down from the weeping willows

But they told me it was love
And they did it for my own good
And they said it was my fault
Hitting me down
And they shouted and they howled
Until I endlessly cried

I am the Paper Princess
So fragile and so sad
I have been crumbled
Iâve been torn by their lies
So if you take my hand
And if you dive into my eyes
Iâll welcome you
In my paper wonderland
