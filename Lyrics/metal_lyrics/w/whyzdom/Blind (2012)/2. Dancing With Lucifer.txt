Earth, water, fire and air
Hell, heaven, destiny
God, Satan, devils, angels
Crushing our souls in their hands
Earth, water, fire and air
Hell, heaven, destiny

I met Satan in the realm of dreams tonight
He said: What do you want from me?
Eternal youth and power?
Do you want fame?
Do you want love?
Do you want eternal life?
All you need to do is to give me
A signing in your own blood

Dancing with Lucifer tonight
Is such an exalting experience
Fire is consuming my soul
Freeing me from the bonds of human kind
Too late to take me back home
Now that Iâve tasted the sweetness of the wine

Earth, water, fire and air
Hell, heaven, destiny

I felt the joy of his overwhelming power
He smiled at me, took my hand and closed my eyes
Are you tired of lies, are you tired of tries
Of violence and pride
Will you come with me to the edge of time?
Leave the flock of lambs behind

Dancing with Lucifer tonight
Is such an exalting experience
Fire is consuming my soul
Freeing me from the bonds of human kind
Too late to take me back home
Now that Iâve tasted the sweetness of the wine

I am here alone with Him
Standing on the brink of infinity
And as a drop of blood flows from my vein
Iâm signing my name across the page

Memories of what was once given to me
Remotely echo in my head
So sad I can see you talking to me
But your words never reach my mind
The shadows are waiting for me
Goodbye love, goodbye family

Vade retro Lucifer
Non draco sit mihi dux
Vade retro Lucifer
Amor sit mihi lux
Vade retro Lucifer
Sunt mala quae libas
Vade retro Lucifer
Ipse venena bibas
