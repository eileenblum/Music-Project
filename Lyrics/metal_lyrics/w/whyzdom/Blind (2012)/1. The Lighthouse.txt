Can you hear the wind that's rising in the night
Can you see the clouds gathering in the sky
Covering the sparkling stars

I can feel the storm that's rushing in my sails
I can feel the waves erupting like bursts of white flames
But it's too late to turn back

Deeper than the tears
Deeper than the seven seas
Darkness covers the flows
Darkness swallowed my hope

Oh, the lighthouse was shut down tonight
A storm is rising on the seven seas
Don't rely on faith or destiny
Ride the crests of the waves
And cut through the wrath of Leviathan

Can you hear the mermaidsâ soothing lullaby
Are you looking at her arms opening wide
Lost in the blue of her eyes

I can see the typhoon swirling in the night
I can see the lightning revealing the fear in our eyes
As we see there is no way back

Deeper than the tears
Deeper than the seven seas
Darkness covers the flows
Darkness swallowed my hope

Oh, the lighthouse was shut down tonight
A storm is rising on the seven seas
Don't rely on faith or destiny
Ride the crests of the waves
And cut through the wrath of Leviathan
