On these lonely roads Iâve been travelling for so long
Trying to find shelter from the pain
Iâve been searching for the sound and the smell
Of the rivers and the young trees

Now that it seems that I know each path
And each crossroad and each flower and each tree
I am sitting back on the ground
Looking back over my shoulder vanishing away

On these lonely roads Iâve been searching for so long
For the arms to keep me from flying away
From the ancient memories of old wounds that Iâve been
Trying to ignore then to heal

Now that it seems that I know each rose
And each of their thorns, and each color they wear
I am standing on the road again
Looking far away to the horizon
Pretending to make out an aim

Ah, will I ever find peace in my heart
Ah, will I ever find a reason to stay
Somewhere I can call my home
Far from the storms
That have been raging
Inside my heart for so long

On these lonely roads
When twilight has come down
On the desert of my soul
Iâve been feeling so hard
The bite and the cold
Of the winter of my life

Now that it seems
That Iâve known too well
The sorrows and deception and tears
I am lying down on the ground
Looking high above in the sky
The stars are waiting for me

Ah, will I ever find peace in my heart
Ah, will I ever find a reason to stay
Somewhere I can call my home
Far from the storms
That have been raging
Inside my heart for so long
