A shroud of snow had covered the land for so long
The cold biting my flesh to the bone
The sky was dark and the sun turned to black
As I saw a shape moving in the corner of my eye

A furtive shadow was lingering over my fragile heart
Cast by the flickering glow of the moon
The devilâs own eyes were staring at me
Casting a shroud of fear over my soul

I saw a wolf enter the town
Threading its way through the night
Where all the souls are blurred in a constant haze
Silently looking for its prey
And it was young, and strong and full of rage
Ready to jump on your face
And to cut out your throat
And feast on your blood

Donât live your life within the walls
Of the fortress build around your heart
Donât be afraid of the dark
Donât let the wolves feed on your secret fears
If you just close your heart
If you just close your eyes
If you just let the wolves enter your world
They will devour your soul

A manic movement insidiously did grow inside the crowd
Desperately trying to find the guilty goat
Prey to their fears, men turned on men
Starting to hunt down the stranger and the lamb

I saw the wolves enter the town
Threading their way through the crowds
Where all the souls are blindly waiting for the day
Theyâll find some leaders to obey

And they were young and strong and full of rage
Ready to jump on your face
And to find out how far
They could feed on your fears

Donât live your life within the walls
Of the fortress build around your heart
Donât be afraid of the dark
Donât let the wolves feed on your secret fears
If you just close your heart
If you just close your eyes
If you just let the wolves enter your world
They will devour your soul

Live your life
Face your trials
Do not hide yourself from the world
Leave your doubts
Leave your fears behind
