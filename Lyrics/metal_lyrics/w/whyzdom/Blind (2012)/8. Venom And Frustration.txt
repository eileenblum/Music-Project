You were so strong, so brave and so arrogant
Young blood on the edge
Eager to prove to yourself that you were the One
Eager to fulfill old promises

Naive and full of foolish pride
Focused on proving you were right
What will remain of yourself when you lose
When youâre stripped of your innocence

I saw in your eyes an endless dream
A desperate will to end the game
I saw in your eyes an endless pain
Scars lingering across your chest

Venom inside your blood
Frustration in your soul
Venom inside your blood
Resentment will never bring you love
Open your mind
Donât let your eyes be blinded by the light
Donât let it spread, donât let it poison your heart again

How many times were you told not to play the fool
Fires spread much faster than you thought
Now look around, ashes surrounding you
Remains of your childhood dreams

I thought youâd really learned by now
The treachery of wine
Acknowledge defeat, itâs your only hope
And leave your pride behind

I saw in your eyes an endless dream
A desperate will to end the game
I saw in your eyes an endless pain
Wounds burning inside your flesh

Venom inside your blood
Frustration in your soul
Venom inside your blood
Resentment will never bring you love
Open your mind
Donât let your eyes be blinded by the light
Donât let it spread, donât let it poison your heart again

I saw in your eyes an endless dream
A desperate will to end the game
I saw in your eyes an endless pain
Wounds burning inside your flesh

Venom inside your blood
Frustration in your soul
Venom inside your blood
Resentment will never bring you back to life
Open your mind
Donât let your eyes be blinded by the light
Donât let it spread, donât let it poison your heart again
