Iâve been raised with a blindfold over my eyes
Iâve been denied the right to think with my own mind
Iâve been listening to their nonsense and rhymes
Too young too soon too pretty to say anything right

They say:

How do you dare to speak
When you donât know the words of wisdom from the past?
How do you dare to sing
When you donât know the melody of life?
How do you dare to think
When ministers lead the holy flock of lambs?
Now do you understand what faith is all about?
Donât leave me now lost in the dark

Thereâs a wind that constantly
Throws us all down on our knees
There are nightmares spreading darkness
In our children hearts
Thereâs a bed of thorns that is waiting for me
Each and every night

Theyâve been praising divine ignorance and lies
Clinging to the only hope of salvation in another life
They were telling me that I needed a guide
While they were blind and I was the one to see the light

They say:

Now will you listen
To the tiny voice in the corner of your mind?
Now will you pay attention
To whatâs written between the lines?
Now do you see the shadow
Patiently waiting for you behind the light?
Now do you understand the truth
Hidden beneath the lies?
Donât let the blind show you the light

Thereâs a wind that constantly
Throws us all down on our knees
There are nightmares spreading darkness
In our children hearts
Thereâs a bed of thorns that is waiting for me
Each and every night

Why donât you ever listen
To the words of wisdom from my mouth?
Why donât you ever pay care
About whatâs standing out to my own eye?
Why donât you ever have a doubt
About your old beliefs and silly signs?
Now will you dare to face
The consequences of your lies?

Thereâs a wind that constantly
Throws us all down on our knees
There are nightmares spreading darkness
In our children hearts
Thereâs a bed of thorns that is waiting for me
Each and every night
