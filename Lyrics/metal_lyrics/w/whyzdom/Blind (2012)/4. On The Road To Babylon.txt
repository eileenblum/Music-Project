Babel ad caelum culmen pertinet
Babel confusum est labium terrae
Babel ibi confusum est labium terrae
Babel dispersit eos Dominus

Babel lÃ -haut mâappelle, des Ã©toiles plein les yeux
Babel, fiertÃ© humaine, maudite des dieux

What are you going to do now your God betrayed us
Breaking us all down confusing our language and our souls
Scattering the People, defying him over the world
Waging war upon refugees, deaf, hopeless and blind

What are you going to do when the Tower falls down
You were so brave, so high
So close to the sky
Did you really think
You could rival with God
And not incur His wrath

But a wind of change has blown
All the pieces of this game away
The rules have changed
Let us build a new dream
From the ruins of today

On the road to Babylon
A shroud of confusion did blind us
And covered the souls of the Proud
On the road to Babylon
Thereâs a wind of misunderstanding that blows our will away
We were building a city so strong and so high
It could even embrace the stars

What are you going to do now your God breaks down
Watching all the flocks of sheep diving right into the sea
Following their leaders and your pathetic church and ministers
Trying to canalize the deepest instincts of human kind

What are you going to do when your children wake up
On a world of fear, of war, of tears, and madness
Do you really think thereâs a durable way to hide
The bloodstains on your hands

But a wind of change has blown
All the pieces of this game away
The rules have changed
Let us build a new dream
From the ruins of today

On the road to Babylon
A shroud of confusion did blind us
And covered the souls of the Proud
On the road to Babylon
Thereâs a wind of misunderstanding that blows our will away
We will build a city so strong and so high
It will even embrace the stars
