Flashing thunder rides the night sky
We were born to rule the universe
The Kingdome of us all.
You can't see us we don't exist
It's just imagination, it's just your own creation

We come from far away beyond the stars
We have traveled the seven skies

Signs of circles burned be night lights
Experimenting the human kind
Experimenting with your minds.
You can't see us we don't exist
It's just imagination, it's just your own creation

Today is the day we will make up our minds
Tomorrow might just be to late.
Follow your hearts and confide in your selves
This is the truth of our universe fate...
