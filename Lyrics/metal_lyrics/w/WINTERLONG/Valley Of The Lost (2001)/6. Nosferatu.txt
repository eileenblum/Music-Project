Far beneath you, under ground
I am waiting to be found
I am ugly, I am wild
Nosferatu a vampires child

[Chorus]
Vampire nation, blood generation.
When fullmoon rises so will I.
My creation, you obligation
Knock on wood, It's bleeding time...

Far above you, in the air
I am watching, in despair
I walk among you, in daylight
I'll come into you, in the night

[Chorus]
Vampire nation, blood generation.
When fullmoon rises so will I.
My creation, you obligation
Invite me in, It's feeding time...

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Vampire nation, blood generation.
When fullmoon rises so will I.
My creation, you obligation
Open up, It's needing time...
