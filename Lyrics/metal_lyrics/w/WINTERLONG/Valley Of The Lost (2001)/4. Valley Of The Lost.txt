Beyond reality in flames of desire
I watch you die in another life
We danced around in silence
Only deamons sang our song
Together we were bound for eternity
On the eternal path we walk, in the endless night we dwell
Blinded by ominous souls.

We were born to face another life!

[Chorus]
Come and join us and be the guardians of the night
Followthe ancient ones into the Valley of the Lost
Come and join us and be the guardians of the night
Followthe ancient ones into the Valley of the Lost

I gazed at the sky, who am I now?
Screaming of pain, anger and hate!

[Chorus]
Come and join us and be the guardians of the night
Followthe ancient ones into the Valley of the Lost
Come and join us and be the guardians of the night
Followthe ancient ones into the Valley of the Lost
