Don't say a word, don't make a sound...
[Cause] It's midnight, again.
Deep in the dark if you'll listen, you can hear,
The mystery madman is playing his song.

Down by the river, a stone was his home.
Shadows where dancing, a twist of the dead.

[Chorus]
For the goblins and blackelves, and witches and trolls
They all had a part in his nocturnal play.
Some say he was evil, the Devil himself,
He fooled all with passion, and led them astray.

Daylight, again.
The forest is silent, the mist tells of murder,
In the dark!
The mystery madman is playing his song again...

Down by the river, a stone was his home,
Shadows where dancing, the twist of the dead.

[Chorus]
For the goblins and blackelves, and witches and trolls
They all had a part in his nocturnal play.
Some say he was evil, the Devil himself,
He fooled all with passion, and led them astray.

[Solo]

Down by the river, a stone was his home,
Shadows where dancing, the twist of the dead.

[Chorus]
For the goblins and blackelves, and witches and trolls
They all had a part in his nocturnal play.
Some say he was evil, the Devil himself,
He fooled all with passion, and led them astray.

So the goblins and blackelves, and witches and trolls,
Went into the river all dazed by the spell,
Don't say he was evil, nor Devil below,
He fooled you with magic and led you astray!
