Nights of thunder, nights of pain
Baptised in bloodshed a warrior was born
Raised by evil chained by death
Brought to this world by the reaper himsel

Fighting alone until the end
For Freedom his sword shall be held!
Burning in hell for all time
A judgement that he can't unveil

[chorus]
From heaven to hell is a journey, a journey of time
In punishmend and pain in seek of salvation
Another night awaits

Ancient magic casts a spell
A fate of the undead, and a name remembered well
Laughing down under, goddness of Hades
Fallen from grace she demands blood ravenge.

Fighting alone until the end
For Freedom his sword shall be held!
Burning in hell for all time
A judgement that he can't unveil

[chorus]
From heaven to hell is a journey, a journey of time
In punishmend and pain in seek of salvation
Another night awaits...
