I hear you I fell you
You can't run away from me any more
Who are you leaving me alone
Your destiny!

[Chorus]
I'm leaving you all behind
My journey has begun
Driven by Insanity a voice from inside my mind.

Behold my work of art
I'm send from above to slay all your sins
My master has spoken to me
I am the chosen one.

[Chorus]
I'm leaving you all behind
My journey has begun
Driven by Insanity a voice from inside my mind.
