The city lights begins to glow
Another dusk has come to show
Silent voices from the past
This is my journey (but) is this my call?

Will I ever get to know!

[Chorus]
For every sigle drop of rain
Mu life seems to slowly fade away
Still the sky remains the same
Like the wind I change my way
And as a spark becomes a flame
Still the stars remains the same

When the holy ghost has spoken
It makes me shiver down mt spine
Blackened thoughts, dilutions crave my soul
Am I a morbid man or trick of the tail?

Will I ever get to know!

[Chorus]
For every sigle drop of rain
Mu life seems to slowly fade away
Still the sky remains the same
Like the wind I change my way
And as a spark becomes a flame
Still the stars remains the same

The spell has been broken
I can see it so clear
Light's all around me
I'm finally there

Another Mystery of Life!!?

[Chorus]
For every sigle drop of rain
Mu life seems to slowly fade away
Still the sky remains the same
Like the wind I change my way
And as a spark becomes a flame
Still the stars remains the same
