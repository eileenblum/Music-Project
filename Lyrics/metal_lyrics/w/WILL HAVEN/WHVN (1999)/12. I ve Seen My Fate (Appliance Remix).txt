Crown me - I am Godlike.
Crown me - I am Godlike.
Now I will reign.
Now I will reign.
Over the decay. The sun will burn
My kingdom of dust. All my subjects:
Slaves to machine. My throne is bleak.
I inherit hell.
Now. Now.
Now I will reign.
Crown me - I am Godlike.
Crown me - I am Godlike.
My throne is bleak. [repeated]
Crown me - I am Godlike.
Crown me - I am Godlike.
Crown me - I am Godlike.
Crown me - I am Godlike.
