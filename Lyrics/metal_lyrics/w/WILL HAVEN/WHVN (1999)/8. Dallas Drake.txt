Virtual razor blade
Kill yourself with a man made
Failsafe troubleshoot
It's time we peel away

Everyday it seems we bind ourselves
Locked in our chairs we fade
Into a landscape enclosed
The machine it ingests our lives

Believe keyboard
who's punching your buttons
We entrust our minds and our pockets
Unto a box guess who's listening
The webs have been spun and we're
All dancing in the silk
Waiting to be sucked dry
But I'll sign on for more

Exorcise the possessed

And at times I get so tired of hearing all the hype
I wish I could feel the warmth of another body
And to shed this shell of bitter-sweet isolation
To think I share this chair with so many

Eyes glued, peel away
Eyes glued, peel away
