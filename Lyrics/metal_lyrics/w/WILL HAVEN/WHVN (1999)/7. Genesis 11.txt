Faith's foundation
Feeding the need
To build to
And exist in

Unite. Build. Reaching.

The masses, one machine
Breeding, a common goal

Unite. Build. Reaching.
Unite. Build. Reaching.

Raining down
Splitting the tongues
Raining down

Unfulfilled souls stuffed on
Their scripture, our greed will burn

Unite. Build. Reaching.

The hand of God will destroy
Evolving face, He babbles thy speech

Unite. Build. Reaching.
Unite. Build. Reaching.

Raining down
Splitting the tongues
Raining down
Splitting the tongues

We'll fear, We'll fear
We'll fear, We'll fear
We'll fear, We'll fear
We'll fear, We'll fear him

Unite. Build. Destroy.
Unite. Build. Destroy.
