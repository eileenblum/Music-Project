Let's go for a walk and paint the stars
In constellations of cruelty
Can you dig the moonlight?

Pass around the cleavers
So we can cut each others hearts out
Let us dine without love and make it easy
And keep It meaningless
Only to disintegrate any ground we shared
Can you dig the moonlight?

Paint me your sorrow and I'll make you famous
Show me your happiness and I'll forget you exist
In my book the characters bleed for what they desire

Dream with me so we can ignite / defuse wear friendship thin
Smother lust, I do not want what is not mine, I never did

I knew what I wanted
but filled time with additives
To block the pain of Rejection
I spent too much time worrying about me
I am so selfish, I destroyed us
And any common ground
But half the fun is rebuilding
