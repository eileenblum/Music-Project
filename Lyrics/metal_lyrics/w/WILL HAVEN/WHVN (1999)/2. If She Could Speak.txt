Will you embrace me?

I wish you Godspeed
Why are you waiting?
What are you looking for?
Did you even think?
But did you know
I bet you don't
I bet you don't
Not even

I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing

Build your own camelot in dreams
Without will I've stepped outside
To hide myself in someone else
To hide myself in someone

I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing
I've got nothing for you
I've got nothing

How am I to protect my home
When you've broke my seclusion
No, I never asked to be put on your cross
No, I never asked to be put on your cross

Who will save you?
Who will become you?
I've made my court
My throne is full
Who will save you?
Who will become you?
I've made my court
My throne is full

I'm not your Christ, I will not die
I'm not your Christ, I will not die
I'm not your Christ, I will not die
I'm not your Christ, I will not
I will not die for you
I will not die for you
I will not die for you
I will not
