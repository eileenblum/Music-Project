This body feels frail
What have I done to deserve
This constant bombardment
And now it's time to stand

Do you want a piece of me?
Do you want a piece of me?
Do you want a piece of me?

I will serve it up to you
I'm standing up to you
What do you think of that?
With a torch in my hand
And I will put you down

Do you want a piece of me?
Do you want a piece of me?
Do you want a piece of me?

I will serve it up to you
Violence wouldn't be a cure
To my hate for you
But I bet it'd feel good
To put you down
I'm standing up to you
What do you think of that?
With a torch in my hand
And I will put you down

This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song

This body feels frail
What have I done to deserve
This constant bombardment
And now it's time to stand

Do you want a piece of me?
Do you want a piece of me?
Do you want a piece of me?

I will serve it up to you
I'm standing up to you
What do you think of that?
With a torch in my hand
And I will put you down

Do you want a piece of me?
Do you want a piece of me?
Do you want a piece of me?

I will serve it up to you
Violence wouldn't be a cure
To my hate for you
But I bet it'd feel good
To put you down

So I will serve it up to you
Yea, I will serve it up to you
Yea, I will serve it up to you
Yea, I will serve it up

This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
This is my fuck you song
