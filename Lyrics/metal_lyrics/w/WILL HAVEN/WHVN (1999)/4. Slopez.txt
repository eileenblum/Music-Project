I see angels in your eyes
Innocence is your beauty
Lose that, what will you be left with?

Go on and find yourself
In the vastness of your world
But when it divides you always can...

Come back to innocence
Everyone loves a good child
Behave and never swear
At the hand that feeds
We will never be able
To hide behind those eyes
So just bat your lashes
And we'll always be safe
Until we find a new cause
And we'll always be safe
Until we find a new cause
