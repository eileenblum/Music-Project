Today I awoke my eyes were blind to the colours of this beautiful world,
Which scares me because I've planned to paint a self portrait of my world
Do you remember my asking your opinion of me?

The answer was so beautiful and inspiring
So I prayed to the brushes to see my values
But they had a conspiracy against me
Which is my own theory
But how can I prove it on speculation
Oh Courtney I love you, for being her my saviour

But I can pretend to be suffering in between the brushstrokes
and they will gather to see my work goals achieved
Because of you you my darling

I'm choosing the colours
I'm choosing my colours
To my self portrait
I'm choosing to my self portrait
I'm choosing
