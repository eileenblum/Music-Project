I'm stale
What's happening?
So stale
What's happening?
The fear of falling behind
The stagnant fills my bowels

I'm frozen
I'm frozen
I'm frozen
I'm frozen boy
I'm frozen
I'm frozen
I'm frozen
I'm frozen boy

Love it's drained right out
Who will save my soul?
I need to crack
The ice and breath
Again I'm stale
What's happening?
So stale
What's happening?

I'm frozen
I'm frozen
I'm frozen
I'm frozen boy
I'm frozen
I'm frozen
I'm frozen
I'm frozen boy

The cardboard faces stare straight through me
Do you think they can feel the life I'm neglecting
Why don't they have anything to say?
What are they thinking?
When I carry on monotonous

Or do they know?
Or do they even know?
Or do they know?
Or do they even know?
