Cascading silhouettes of evils past
Forgetting will not drown the demons
Old wounds that never heal with time
Abrasive words spit from the serpents tongue
Vows of redemption which will never
Which will never come but echoes throughout
Throughout his mind, the pain enslaves
Enslaves him in his own, own misery

War of the heart
War of the heart
War of the heart

Sorrow is all he's to show
Sorrow is all he's to show
Sorrow is all he's to show

Hate keeps crashing at the wall of denial
Will she be happy with the guilt?
He will never live with,
But he did not take her son
He chose to walk
And walk he did believing nothing
He has set out to find his own truth
And capture life

War of the heart
War of the heart
War of the heart

Hate has been been an anchor
Hate has been been an anchor
Hate has been been an anchor
Hate has been been an anchor
Love is all he can pray for
Love is all he can pray for
Love is all he can pray for
Love is all he can pray for

He can't go on
Kicking the dog
He can't go on
Kicking the dog
