Yeah sign me up I want to run with the pack
Yeah running, yeah running
Hey make me one cause I want to be part of
Something yeah running yeah
To think I will congregate and I'll be someone
Yeah running yeah running
But you must coat it, it's got to be easy to
Swallow yeah running yeah

I thought sucking on a part of this would solidify
My existence, my existence
Everyone will be known to jump in without me
Now you can't - you will find yourself running
No more losing you sacrificed to
Our collector your number yeah

Lose your virginity only to become open to this world
give up identity and you become a slave and take one for the team

I'm gone and broken for kicks
stand on my two feet
I've gone and broken for kicks
Stand on my two fucking feet

This life defined me the shoes that I never wanted to feel
This life defined me the shoes that I ever wanted to feel

But I must please and I will
Yeah, I must please
I will perform for mother ghost
I will perform for mother ghost
I will perform for mother ghost
I will perform... I will perform...

I want to lose my number in this way
of my own because I want to be...

Lose your virginity only to become open to this world
give up identity and you become a slave and take one for the team
