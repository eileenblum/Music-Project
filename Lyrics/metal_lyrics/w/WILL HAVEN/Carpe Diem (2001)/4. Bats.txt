Ducking through the wave
He's closing his eyes
Cleansing his brain of a sensory
Holding all his breath
Collecting his thoughts
To focus on a goal
To focus on...

I'm under and going down
I'm under and going down

Fooled by the foam
Setting himself free
But the saltwater chokes
Robbing him of his feed
He's growing numb to this
Or is this bliss
Can he be blind to
What he hiding from

His brain can't remember
That memories never fade
Question never answered
What was the purpose
Of his self, self inflicting pain
What was the purpose
Of him

I'm under and going down
I'm under and going down
I'm under and going down
I'm under and going, I'm going down
