He cut his nose to spite his face
Because he thought it would bring a change
And clean his heart of all its ugliness
And we just watch him bleed
And we just watch him bleed

He is, he is a boy who hates himself
He is, he is a boy who hates his surroundings
He is, he is a boy who hates his future

Gather around and watch him bleed
Gather around and watch him bleed
He is a boy who hates me
He is a boy who hates me

How long can we all stand by
And pretend all is alright
How long can we all stand by
And pretend all is alright

By turning our heads we drive the nail
We might as well give up on ourselves
By turning our heads we drive the nail
We might as well give up on...

And so is life
And so is life
And so is life

By turning our heads we drive the nail
By turning our heads we drive the nail
