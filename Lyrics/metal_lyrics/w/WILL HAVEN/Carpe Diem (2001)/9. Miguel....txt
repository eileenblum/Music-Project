Try and destroy - you've already failed
Seek only truth and trust your heart
Betray all your thoughts - you've already failed

Seek only truth and trust your heart
Betray all your thoughts and dive to denial
Stand like a man or limp with a crutch

Of being alone and embrace it
Open your mind to the discomfort
Of being alone and embrace it
Open your mind, open your mind
Set out to fail and embrace it
Set out to fail and embrace it
Kneel - down into the circle
Down into the circle
Down into the circle
Down into the...
