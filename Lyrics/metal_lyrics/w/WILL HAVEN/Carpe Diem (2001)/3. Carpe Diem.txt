Time, how much have i wasted
I never grasped a clock
Till he passed away

Greed rules what we make of ourselves
Ourselves, from the beggar
To the chooser who survives
At the end of the trail, the trail, the trail!

Who has lived life to the fullest
Ask yourself have i even breathed
Or are we all riding life out
To tell the truth i'm in, i'm in the backseat

Now's the time to take a look
At what surrounds
And embrace the hearts
Of the ones in your life
Spark the fire that will
Torch the numbness inside
If you look to far ahead
You'll lose sight of today

Carpe Diem
Carpe Diem
