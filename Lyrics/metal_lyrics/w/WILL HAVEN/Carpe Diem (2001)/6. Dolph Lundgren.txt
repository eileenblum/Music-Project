When your pathetic life spirals down to the final solution
Which you can not pick up and dissolve selfish intentions
How do you carry, do you pick up your broken spirit

From the ashes, through the tears of self-pity
Who can show, show me the road back home

Who can perform a procedure of disembowelment
I don't even know how or where to start the incision
But for now I will dig the grave
Because who knows how long I can afford the plot

The headstone will read here lies all the bottled thoughts of a man
Too frightened to be corked
These contents may be buried too deep for all of his fears to...
To be audible

Sweetheart I'm counting on you to see through my soil
And raise me to the surface
Please pick up the shovel and dig
I request this of you to set this fool free
Raise my spirit to the sanctuary of our union let, let us praise
Life into my dead soul

You can see me through the smoke
You can see me past the mirrors
That I dance around
You can see me through the smoke
You can see me past the mirrors that
I dance - that I dance around!

Bring this dead soul back to life
And set your fool free
Bring it back to life
And set... set your fool free
