Scraping away at a wall that
I thought was built so, so strong
But I guess we put our masks on
And carved a smile
And carved a smile

Confusion
Disintegrating emotions
Thought ever so strong
But roots give away to saturation
We put our masks on
And carved a smile
We put our masks on
And carved a smile

I'm left with empty feelings of...
Where did I go...
My heart is choking, gasping for air
Where did I go...
I'm left with empty feelings of...
Where did I go wrong?

When does trust slip away
And not even matter any more
respect loss
How can we rebuild
What's been broken before
What's been broken before
What's been broken before
What's been broken before
Broken before
Broken before
Broken before
Broken
