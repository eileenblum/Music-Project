Justice for the enslaved

Our minds are showered by ideas projected
Our lives are material, lived through misguided obsessions

Your thoughts and feelings are not yours
They're someone's bought air time
It's time we turn off

Our lives, influenced by special interest
Our lives, influenced by special interest

We watch, we die
We stop, they die
We watch, we die
We stop, they die
