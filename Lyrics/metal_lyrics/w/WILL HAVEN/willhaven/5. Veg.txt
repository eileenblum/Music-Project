Head to toe draped in your skin
Needless death, where's your compassion
Why can't you see while stabbing your meat
That you don't need to kill

And still we keep killing
And still we keep killing

Taken from or bought from farms
Locked away in labs which our taxes pay
Scared and frightened awaiting the next test
They need a voice, a voice that liberates

And still we keep killing
And still we keep killing
And still we keep killing

From factory farms to your dinner table
You need your protein, do you eat your vegetables?
And you deserve a break today
Are the lies, are the lies

And still we keep killing
And why are we killing
Killing ourselves
