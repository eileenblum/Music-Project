Is there light at the end of...
That's all I can hope for
When it seems so endless
I'm sinking into myself

My fears they over, over come me
My fears they over, over come me

There is nothing and no one
This candle has burnt out
It's not the attention
My moment has come

My fears they over, over come me
My fears they over, over come me
I'm all alone
I'm feeling left out
I'm all alone

I had to make a choice
I choose to remember
That this will all pass in
All pass in, in time
You're not alone
There's others you can count on
You don't have to go through this alone
I'm here for you
