Soaked by your thoughts or better yet
Excretions from your, your rusted minds
Showering soot covering and blackening
All my thoughts and my beliefs

Your impressions lie on my skin
No need to burn to be washed away

Your lack of respect for me and my views
And those of others it only shows
The ignorance of your insecurities
What you have created should be for you

Your impressions lie on my skin
No need to burn to be washed away
I walk a path that i've made for me
Why is it so hard so hard for you

I have the right
I have the right
I have the right
I have the right
The right to Life
Life
Life
Life

Soaked by your thoughts or better yet
I'm drowning in your your rusted minds
I don't need your opinions on my beliefs
They're my beliefs

No need to burn to be washed away
No need to burn to be washed away
