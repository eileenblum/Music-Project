Stepping aside to look at what I've made for
Stale flowing, where's my progression?
I'm so quick to motivate
While I falter toward

This is my endless struggle to find

You can be so bold to let your expression show
While I'm content with habitat
Or will seasons bleed migration

This is my endless struggle to find
This is my endless struggle to find

Life always seeking for something higher
Why can't it be so simple
As only the strong survive
Strong survive
Strong survive
Survive
