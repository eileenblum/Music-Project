You have a handicap, it's an extension of...
That you use instead of exposing your feelings

You're staring at me through crosshair eyes
You're staring at me through crosshair eyes

Your thoughts are powerless to the death that you hold
In the palm of your hand, it's your false sense of security

I can control everything
I will give you your life
I can take it away
I will pass my judgement

But who will protect me if I won't choose your way?

I put this gun in your hand
I put this gun in your hand
I put this gun in your hand
I put this gun in your
In your

You should do the right thing and turn this gun on yourself
For the sake of society and do us all a favour

I dare ya!
I dare ya!
I dare ya!
