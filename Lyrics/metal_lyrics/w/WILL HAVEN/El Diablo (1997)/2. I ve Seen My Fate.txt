Blood of wounds will fill the streets with
Her tears sorrow saturate dry wells
My sicken flesh carries our burden
My cross to bare for my sins

Crown me I am godlike

Now I will reign over the decay
The sun will burn my kingdom of dust
All my subjects slaves to machine
My throne is bleak, I inherit hell

Crown me I am godlike
Crown me I am godlike

I've seen my fate

I inherit hell
I inherit world
I inherit hell
I inherit world

Blood of wounds will fill the streets with
Her tears sorrow saturate dry wells
My sicken flesh carries our burden
My cross to bare for my sins

Crown me I am godlike
Crown me I am godlike
