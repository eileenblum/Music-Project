The starters pistol fires
Your game is afoot now
And the clones cheer you on
You radiate intimidation

Don't you think she can sense your eyes pierce
To the flesh or does your ego...

You paint a pretty picture of yourself to her
An abstract portrait regardless of the truth
Don't you think she can sense your eyes pierce
To the flesh or does your ego
Block out the emotions of another?
Block out the emotions Of another!

You'll eat her existence
A slave to your game
You'll eat her existence
A slave to your game
You'll eat her existence
A slave to your game
A slave to your
A slave to your game

Another's pain and fears is spelled out in her eyes
But will the child's ego ever let go?
Another's pain and fears is spelled out in her eyes
But will the child's ego Ever let go?
For the sake of being loved?
For the sake of being loved?
