Hate consumes me I search for release
Time is the only answer

My conscience weighs so heavily
On my soul, so heavily

I will continue alone
Share nothing

Pierce my eyes
Dreams I only wished for
Secrets never anyone else's

Careless and pointless
Followed the temptation
To the wrong destination
Deflection of the truth
Staring back at me
Strength under the sheets
Decisions make themselves
Forget to love
No feelings
They will never come
This will never fix it
It will never fill the moment
