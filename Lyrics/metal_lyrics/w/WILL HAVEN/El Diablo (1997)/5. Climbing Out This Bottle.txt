Bound by this liquid
It's masking thoughts and ideas
My actions this is not me
it's my sickness, my alter ego
Fuelled by the fear of the truth
Pass down through Generation after...

I'll climb out this bottle
To look at a bright sunny day
I'll climb out this bottle
To look at you're bright happy face
I'll climb out this bottle
To look at a bright sunny day
I'll climb out this bottle
To look at your bright happy face

Eyes clouded by friendship
You offer no answers when I bleed out questions
But you can't change who does not want to change,
I don't want to change

Frighten by actions I run and hide from myself to numb my feelings
But I can't hide forever as my liver dries up the truth
It's found its way to the surface in your eye
It's found its way to the surface in a friends eye
