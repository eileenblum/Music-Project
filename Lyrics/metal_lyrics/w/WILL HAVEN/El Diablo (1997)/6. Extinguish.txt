I'm going to begin to burn down this house
That we built together
I will ignite each room one by one

My heart will not feed my flames

What led you to this betrayal of my feelings?
You want to be so strong and hold
To your selfish convictions
What about our commitment?

How can I fill this grey spot in my heart?

I thank you though I'm frightened because I'm sinking deeper
You've locked the door to my seclusion
My own cell, I hate everything, everyone, including myself

My heart will not feed my flames
That I've ignited to erase

How can I fill this grey spot in my heart?

No clean break, no clean slate
Just a dusty chalk board
No clean break, no clean slate
Just a dusty chalk board
