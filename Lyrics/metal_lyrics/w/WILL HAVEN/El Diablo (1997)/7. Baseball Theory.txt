Have I asked for too much?
If I did please forgive me
Please allow me another favour
Peel my flesh and grab the twine
And run, unwind me
I want to be undone for you

You're getting what you want
Because my guard is down
Which seems to run in cycles so
You better hurry before this one's up

Do you want to get to the core?
I wanted to let you in from the start

I'll be the water to pour over concentrate
Your windshield poetry has loosened my seams

Beware though, this ball has seen
Many games and has never worn down
After centuries of playing mascot
To my familys legacy
A trophy Or a symbol
Of our mind's fortress
