when a world comes to this
for a one eyed god
put a headlock on death
with a book of love

choose your faith
take control
just for frills
rebel up
cure your heart
real eyes

and all we take, winds up in fire

when a corpse for rent
is giving your life hell

and the world is cut off
you're drivin back to l.a.
back to l.a.
we're back to the grave

choose your faith
take control
just for frills
could it be
that's what's wrong
realize

one eyed god in our world comes to life
pushing closer
every time that you think you're on your way
give it your all
opening more doors than a bomb
the candy man can
written out of all the history books
and hollywood
everything that eye saw, blows your mind
triumph over
time to head to vegas on a roll
over and over again
(give pints of blood)

now you will fly, and you will hope
give your left eye, on your way home
