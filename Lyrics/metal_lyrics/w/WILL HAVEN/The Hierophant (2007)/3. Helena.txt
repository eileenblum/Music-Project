in a winter's tale
rattled off to all in vain
seduced into torture

here stands a monument
of a womanizer's fold
from diamonds to clowned
sunken down

those tender lies you bleed
deep within
paralyze this movement

she is who gains
from the broken sails of a man
clawing out the passions
only tides will know

a watery tomb
cleanse the name
outer shell melts away

what goes around
i could never feel your pain
through eyes pale

we are the chosen, to sail on

as we set sail, on a winter's tale
rattled off to all in vain
seduced into torture
she'll not shed a tear
for heartless souls
