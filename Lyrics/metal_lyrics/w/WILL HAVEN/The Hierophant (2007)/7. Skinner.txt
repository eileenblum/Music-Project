"understand stagnation is a choice, so trade in comfort for vitality... the unknown"
the lovers. temperance. judgment. death.
"on thing's for certain, this is no fool's journey. it's perfecting madness and rebirth."
the lovers. temperance. judgment. death.

to your own misfortune chasings cures
nothing is pure

fucked up homes, boarding schools, factories of
droves, drained-out souls

turn it off, abandon, the false
truths, heroes, fools

in solitude, start a new, clean the slate of guilt
the road is home

the hour strikes to unsheathe this blade
give it a stab
