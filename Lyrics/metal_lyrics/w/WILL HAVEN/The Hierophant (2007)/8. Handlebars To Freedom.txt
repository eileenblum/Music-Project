let's dance, the come around
the figure that dies
rockin' rebel
what a given

reveal the way
from the weak and the coven
what a stage

last chance, your wreckage
you're weaving downfall
like a wheelbase that's coming untied
dawn the new day

we will wreck it all the way
and when given the choice
from the vagrant that claws
now we wont fake it

what a play
what a player

i laugh all the way

and proud yourself with ends
and proud yourself to death

i found the way... tower!

the precious to protect
the prejudice who kill

i found the way
