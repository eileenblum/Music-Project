hey i won't get upset
now bee stings are all raw
burn these snakes cover my glare
and took my heart, claws

you're like a dirt burglar
traveling down death row

lone, lazy, due to give
blood from the cowboys
i'm done, this was never my intent
i can't give up on this

raging i would be
everything is turned
on its head in progress
i can't let them go

"but i gotta stand back, i gotta step away,
it's all swirling around in my mind... and i can't!"

give up on me

"time and time again, i can't see why i gotta be
what i don't want!"

as we cover all of this
of this facade
that i bleed
cuz we're broke

these snakes wrapped around my hands and feet

"and i turn, and i can't see straight,
and i can't see anything!"

i implore, open your mind little boy
for now i need everything
from the guard tower of hell
i need all of this open

i will work
i will walk
