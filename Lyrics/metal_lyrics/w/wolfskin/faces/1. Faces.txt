Crawling through the wind and sand
We are all born
In the same land
With different laws we became gods of our small universes
Inside our souls.

When there is nowhere to go...
Where will you be?
What will you believe?

Now, that we are far away
And there is no return (no return)
I've lost my faith and my hope (and my hope)
Now that we are far away, and there is no return!
Faces is all I see but intentions lay behind the skin!

So I look at the sky searching for a signal to survive
We will pay the price with blood

Cursed existence!

When there is nowhere to go...
Where will you be?
What will you believe?

Now, we are far away
And there is no return (no return)
I've lost my faith and my hope (and my hope)
Now that we are far away, and there is no return!
Faces is all I see but intentions lay behind the skin!

You have to see
You are on the edge
Show your real face to the world
Your real face!

Faces is all I see
Faces is all I see
Faces is all I see but intentions
Lay behind the skin.
