Day by day, time goes by
And it's not waiting for you.
The minutes are destroying the life you built
You cannot run from your past
Your choice will follow us.

You'll be back, where you started
On your knees, empty handed.
Will every passing day be wasted?
Is this enough for you?
Is this enough for you?

Just realize you're not right
But my feelings makes me run
Against the wind I will...

Never give in!
You will never give in!

Until I know why this can't be...

Just realize you're not right
But my feelings makes me run
Against the wind I will...
Never give in!

I've been through this for so long
Walking alone with no direction
Worrying about what I didn't do
But the answer was always inside me
To make this life gets better
Now it's the time, so don't waste it.
Because it will never be back...

I'm not alive... I'm not alive...
I'm dead inside...

Just realize you're not right
But my feelings makes me run
Against the wind I will...
Never be back!
