We were just chillin' on a Friday night. Just the BFL crew, no trouble in sight. I got a call from my man and he sounded distressed. He got jumped at a party and his face was a mess. He said, "I hope you're down to fight. I know Ghost Army's always down to fight." He said, "Somebody's getting stabbed tonight." That night got fucked up. I wish I could rewind back to BFL chillin' on a Friday night.
