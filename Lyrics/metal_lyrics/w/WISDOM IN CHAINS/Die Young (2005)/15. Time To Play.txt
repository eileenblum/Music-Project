When I fight, I fight alone and I don't run cause there's nothing to run from. When I'm out I stay with my boys. We our thing and we try to have a good time. When I work I work alone and when I get home I call my friends. Have some fun and try to make up for the hard times. When they over the hard times end. 12 hours a day and I wanna go home. Working all day now it's time to play.
