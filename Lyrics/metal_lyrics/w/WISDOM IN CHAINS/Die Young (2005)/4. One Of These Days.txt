GO! Sometimes when I'm driving I think to myself, "I should just pick a direction and go." Just drive until I can't no more. Try to kill the hate somewhere on the highway. Big plans, they get lost and big plans they get crushed. It's my fault, my self destruction. GO! Street lights show no pity. Another town, another city, and still I just keep on driving. GO! Aim my headlights toward the twilight and turn off the radio. Cracks in the road break up the silence. As the mile markers pass me I try shake my demons somewhere on the highway. Big plans they get lost and big plans they get crushed. It's my fault, my self destruction. GO! Street lights show no pity. Another town, another city and still I keep on driving. GO!
