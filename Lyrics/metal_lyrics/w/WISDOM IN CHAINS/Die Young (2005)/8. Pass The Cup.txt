When the sun shines I question my beliefs sometimes. I lost all faith in mankind cause a sunny day for me means someone else's misery. What's it all worth? When you add it all up you got shit. Shit for memories nothing but misery, nothing but a cold and empty hole inside me. What if the tide starts rising up and refugees start lining up and it's your turn to pass the cup? What will you decide? I need a new religion. Cause this one ain't working out. When the sun shines I question my beliefs sometimes. I never had faith in my life. No matter what they said I always did the opposite. What's it all worth? It never meant shit to me, just phony repetitions. Nothing but fake hugs and fake smiles. Siphon the mind out of your child. What if the tide starts riding up and refugees start lining up and it's your turn to pass the cup? What will you decide?
