Build your team. The strongest survive so leave all the weak ones at home. We have to win for the survival of our way of life and to give our children something to believe in. Murder is acceptable because God is with us and he always helps us prevail. Leave all your values at home and brace yourself for the pain. DIE FOR US! DIE FOR US! DIE FOR US! The honor and the glory will all be yours and no one can take that away. This is the game. The rules don't apply. Who's ready to take their turn? This is the game of war.
