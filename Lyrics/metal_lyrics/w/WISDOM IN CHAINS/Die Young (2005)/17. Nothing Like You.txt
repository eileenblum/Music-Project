I've been shunned since day one never saw eye-to-eye cause I'm nothing thinking like you. Yea. Maybe I'm fucked up but maybe you're fucked up too. They tried to tell me I'm a bad seed cause I'm not thinking like you but I made my mind up, I'm never gonna be like you. I lost all faith in you a long time ago cause I'm nothing thinking like you and I'll never trust your version of the truth. I guess there's just no time for a guy like me cause I am nothing like you. So keep an eye on the ones you love maybe I'll get them too. Left out, out of the picture. Locked down all my brothers and sisters. Locked out, but I'm gonna get you. I've been so long and I don't even miss you. What's the point in getting close if I'm not thinking like you? It's sad because I know you feel the same way too. But I guess I've grown to expect this kind of shit from narrow people like you. I've seen it a thousand times and it has cleared my view. You took it all away from me as a punishment but I'm not thinking like you so it backfired and now your worst nightmare is dreaming on you. How many times did you tell me at night if I said my prayers it would be all right and I believed you? I believed you and it never came true. No more facades, no more lies. I just wanna be straight with you. This i s me. What the fuck am I supposed to do? If you don't know than I don't know and I guess we'll leave it alone and see what happens in time. Maybe I'll get some peace of mine. I hope someday I do this ain't no way to live trying not to think about you. I never wanted to live like this but this is all I do.
