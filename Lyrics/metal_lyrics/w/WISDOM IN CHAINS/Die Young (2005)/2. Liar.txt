You're a liar, you phony piece of shit. You're a liar and now I have to bust your fuckin' lip. You're a liar, a liar. You're not my fuckin' friend. You're not my boy now and you never were then. You're a liar, a liar. You act so fuckin' fake. You tried to act surprised when I cracked you in the face. You're a liar, a liar, you dirty little rat and now you got nothing. Tell me what you think about that. You're not my brother now and you never really were. You said you were sorry but I don't believe a word. You spit in my face and disrespected my name and then you wanted pity when the beatdown came. You're pathetic, a whiny little bitch of a man. Wont look me in the eyes but you try to shake my hand. Not today son, I had enough of that shit. You dissed your crew now it's time to deal with it.
