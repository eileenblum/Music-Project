Change direction one more time. Change your looks and change your mind. I don't believe a single word. You're not a part of what I love. We would be better off if you just leave. Watch them fade like you know it had to be. I'll still be doing the same old shit that I was yesterday. Fade away cause we knew you couldn't stay. We see it all the time so we'll sit back and watch you fade away. I've taken my bumps, I've taken my falls. I've been knocked down and through it all this one thing always stayed the same. I've seen them come, I've watched them go so I'm just trying to let you know this is for the ones that still remain. Where are you gonna be tomorrow? Where did you lose yourself today? Watch them fade like you know it had to be. I'll still be doing the same old shit that I was yesterday. Fade away cause we knew you couldn't stay. We see it all the time so we'll sit back and watch you fade away.
