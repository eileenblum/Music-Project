I saw my mother so I asked her, "What's the end for your fuckin' bastard?" I lost it long ago and that's what I am. No happy ever after. I'm gonna hang from a fuckin' rafter and swing to the beat of my cold dead heart. Oh yea. What became of your only daughter? What became of all your sons? You let them leave without a reason. And now you're left with nothing but the same of an empty home. The tree of love is out season. I saw my brother so I asked him, "Do you think about the past and does it keep you up at night like you're all alone?" He said, "Man, I shed some tears and all I got was wasted years so fuck the world and all the bullshit that's in it." I try not think about it cause it only brings me down but on a day like this it's the only thing on my mind. I don't want sympathy. I don't you to agree. I justs wanna smash the system that fucked it up for me.
