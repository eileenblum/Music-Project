We're going nowhere, nowhere. There's no e scape from the nowhere bullshit world we live in. NOWHERE NOWHERE You try to say you're gonna get away. But it doesn't make a difference. NOWHERE NOWHERE We all wanna get somewhere in this life but we never go. NOWHERE NOWHERE Is it ever gonna change? No beliefs, no control. Now I'm stuck living in this hole. And here I'll be until I die. Lonely, old, and cast aside You're going NOWHERE NOWHERE You never had and you never will cause you're nothing and you come from NOWHERE NOWHERE Yes sir I've been beat down, knocked down, that's the breaks when you're NOWHERE NOWHERE I wanna know how did I get stuck with this fate of NOWHERE NOWHERE And is it ever gonna change? No beliefs, no control. Now I'm stuck living in this hole, And here I'll be until I die, Lonely, old, and cast aside. It's never gonna change, Always scraping the bottom of the barrel just to stay broke. And whenever you feel like you're getting ahead you get slapped back and choked. They lied about my false religion, lied about my education, choked out all my dreams. I guess I'm gonna be stuck in the hole forever. NOWHERE NOWHERE NO NO NO NO NOWHERE
