You're hawking me from across the room. I pray to God that you make a move. I see it in your face. You're not ready and I don't think you're ever gonna be. Motherfucker, I'll break your whole shit. I'll fill up your mouth with teeth and bloody spit. I'll kick you in the stomach. I'll kick you in the knee. Do yourself a favor, walk away from me. What's the matter? Can't you speak? Your voice is cracking and your knees are weak. Next time you better think before you raise up and try to fuck around with me. SMASH YOUR FACE I'll punch you in the ribs. SMASH YOUR FACE I'll bust your fuckin' chin. SMASH YOUR FACE I'll split your fucking lip. I'll smack you with a bottle like them London kids. SMASH YOUR FACE You should have saw it coming. SMASH YOUR FACE Now you're fucking done. There's nothing you can do. You never had a chance. SMASH YOUR FACE You never had a chance.
