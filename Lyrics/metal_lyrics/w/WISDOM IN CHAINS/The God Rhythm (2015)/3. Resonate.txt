You fucked up but thatâs OK.
Iâve been there myself so I understand.
But you sneak and hide, wonât look me in the eye.
Insincerity is emotional charity.
Your apology came too late. Something doesnât resonate.
You did me wrong but made me wait.
Whyâd you fucking hesitate?
Too much time, grow the fuck up.
Youâve known me too long. You owe me too much.
Itâs only getting worse, the longer you wait and I feel my tolerance turning to hate.
Your apology came too late. Something doesnât resonate.
You did me wrong but made me wait.
Whyâd you fucking hesitate?
You apology came too late.
