You want it.
You want it.
You think itâs going to set you free.
When you make it whatâs your next step?
Will you quit the chase?
All you ever wanted is there in your hands.
All you ever needed.
All you ever need whenever you demand.
Any way you want it. Any way you can.
The power of the people, the power of the people at your command.
All you ever wanted is there in your hands.
All you ever needed.
All you ever need whenever you demand.
Any way you want it. Any way you can.
How far will you go?
