Did you ever think about forever?
Itâs an obsession of mine.
At times Iâve been so deep that it made me cry.
Could the world keep turning in the absence of time?
Could I even exist if Iâm not yours and youâre not mine?
When I was 5, 39 was a very long time.
I imagined myself dead and gone long before I arrived.
But Iâm still waiting for the apex of my life.
Iâm so glad Iâve waited. So glad I proved you right.
Iâll wait forever if Iâm waiting for you.
If It takes forever Iâll wait here for you.
All the time since I was 5 went by in the blink of an eye.
Forever is ahead and never behind.
If I could bottle this moment in the back of my mind, I could spend forever living in your light.
Iâll wait forever if Iâm waiting for you.
If It takes forever Iâll wait here for you.
All we are, all we are is what weâre waiting for.
If I could spend it with you, I only want you.
I donât think I can love you more but Iâve been wrong every time I said that before.
I truly adore you. This love is the truth.
Itâs the heartbeat of light, the god rhythm is the night.
Youâre my forever, Iâm glad I got to spend it with you.
Iâll wait forever if Iâm waiting for you.
