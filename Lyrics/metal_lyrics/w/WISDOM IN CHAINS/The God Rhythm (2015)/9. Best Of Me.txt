Real as earth and sky above.
The realest thing I ever felt was love.
When I hold you in my arms I know itâs true.
We are born adrift in this endless mist of loneliness.
just hold on tight to me, Iâll hold on tight to you.
Weâll make it through.
My shining star. Youâre the best I ever did.
And you know Iâll never quit on you.
You lift me up so high above it all.
Youâre the best I ever did.
It pours from my pores and pools on floors on a stage and a mic at night on tours.
I spit it in the face of all my friends. I spit it in a sea of angry men.
So full of love, so full of hope.
For years I thought I lost them both.
My heart is so full.
you save me from myself.
My shining star. Youâre the best I ever did.
And you know Iâll never quit on you.
You lift me up so high above it all.
Youâre the best I ever did.
