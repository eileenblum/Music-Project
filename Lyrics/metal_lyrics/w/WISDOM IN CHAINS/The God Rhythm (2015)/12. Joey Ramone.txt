When I think of the beginning, he was singing how to pay for memory.
Half forgotten, half remembered, always cherished because I paid for memories.
I was walking in the moonlight, he was with me when I paid for memories.
13, laying in my bed, covers pulled up over my head.
Joey Ramone rocking in my head. Uh oh, Iâm already loco.
13, with a bad bad brain. A lost boy in Pennsylvania.
Joey sang so sweet to me. Uh oh, Iâm already loco.
Thereâs a danger when you pay for memories.
Itâs a long way back when you pay for memories.
Gabba gabba hey! Gabba gabba ho!
I met him once at a punk rock show.
He shook my hand and he shook my soul.
Uh oh, Iâm already loco.
Too tough to die but when I leave, sprinkle my ashes on Rockaway Beach
Lifeâs a gas, at least for me. Uh oh, Iâm already loco.
Here today, gone tomorrow?
Why not make a memory?
Here today, gone tomorrow?
Why not pay for some memories?
