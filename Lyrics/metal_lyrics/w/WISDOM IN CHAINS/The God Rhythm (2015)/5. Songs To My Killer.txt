I just sat and I stared after I have become aware that my bed and my room was my coffin and my tomb.
If itâs the universal plan. If itâs out of my hands Iâll embrace my fate.
Save your tears Iâd rather celebrate.
I could meet you when Iâm done but halfway is much more fun.
So Iâll gather all my people, we can eat, drink, sing, until weâre done.
At the moment when I die I look my killer in the eye and I smile, so he sees.
He tried but he couldnât take this from me. No!
Save your tears Iâd rather celebrate. Whoa!
Iâll smile so he sees he tried but he couldnât take this from me.
Letâs celebrate, sing songs to my killer. Raise a glass to the death of me.
Letâs celebrate, drink drink to my murder.
Dance with the one who lays me in the deep.

Letâs celebrate, drink drink to my murder.
Dance all night with the enemy.
Sing these songs to my killer.
Wonât you help me celebrate?
Drink drink to my murder.
Dance with the one who lays me in the deep.
Celebrate.
Dance with the one who lays me in the deep.
