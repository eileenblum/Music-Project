Grew up fighting, swinging hard.
Protect your brothers, protect the yard.
We played with sticks and rocks for toys.
4 little violent American boys.
Why are we violent?
Iâve got no excuse.
Culture of violence, when will we let it loose?
My fatherâs blood is African, my motherâs is Bavarian.
Poverty mixed with competition makes violent Americans.
Why are we violent?
Iâve got no excuse.
Culture of violence, when will we let it loose?
Are you the same as me with some undiscovered source of all this rage?
And you canât stop it. You canât cap it and you canât contain.
Because you donât know why you feel this way.
Like somebody else is pulling your strings.
From centuries ago, some genetic memory.

But we keep running. Weâre running from the flood.
Violence is in our blood, itâs in our blood.
Weâre running from the pain.
If we canât stop ourselves we just repeat again.
