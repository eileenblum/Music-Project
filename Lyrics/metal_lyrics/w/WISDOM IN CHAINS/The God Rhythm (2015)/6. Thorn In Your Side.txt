I was born to let you down. I was born to disappoint you.
I always tried but never failed to fall short of your expectations.
You wanted me to be, what I could never be.
So when I became what I wanted you never wanted me.
I started to believe that I was meant to be nothing more than a thorn in your side.
I was born to let you down. I was born to disappoint you.
I always tried but never failed to fall short of your expectations.
For years it bothered me, I could not accept defeat.
Could not accept the pain, could not resist the hate.
But now I made my peace and itâs so clear to me.
It isnât what I wanted but itâs OK.
I was born to let you down.
