In my life Iâve met a few steady proper skinhead crews.
But in â92 there was a crew that banged, a wild untamed skinhead gang.
I was young but I knew better, they claimed âwhite powerâ and they fought whoever.
These skinheads were out for blood.
Thought they were invincible. Casino in Mount Pocono.
They ruined Airport Music Hall. A time bomb ready to blow.
July 15, 1992 they murdered a homeless dude.
Beaten and stabbed to death.
Lynch turned stateâs evidence.
Ritchie Krutch lost his tooth. Kicked in the face by skinhead boot.
Neil Rappley lost his life. Stabbed to death by skinhead knife.
To all the skinheads old &amp; new, donât end up in a bonehead crew.
Respect the culture, respect your roots.
Be a steady proper skinhead crew!
