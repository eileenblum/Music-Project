Weâre incomplete. The world is sick.
Half the earth is fatherless.
A missing piece of broken soul.
Try, but you can never find it all.
Searching for approval.
on the fence of false confidence.
A motherâs arms and a mothers love.
Try to fill the void where the father was.
Fatherless child.
Yeah, you want it.
Yeah, I know you need it bad.
Break the cycle. Care for the fatherless child.
