In this life people die, you can cry all you want and ask yourself why but youâll never know.
Thatâs just the way it is.
You get that call late at night.
Your eyes will swell, youâll grip the phone tight.
People die, thatâs just the way it is.
You think youâll live forever, but trust me you will die.
I wish my words can comfort you, but people they all die.
Take these words, and take them from me, people die thatâs just reality.
Youâll sit and watch everyone cry, you canât change anything so you donât even try.
You think youâll live forever, but trust me you will die.
I wish my words can comfort you, but people they all die.
Pain and loss, Iâve had my share.
Some lose hope and some use prayer.
Me, Iâll just maintain until death looks my way.

Fall in love, have some kids.
Find your passion, truly live.
Cause people die, thatâs just the way it is.
Youâll sit and watch everyone cry, you canât change anything so you donât even try.
The end is coming, itâs almost here.
People die.
