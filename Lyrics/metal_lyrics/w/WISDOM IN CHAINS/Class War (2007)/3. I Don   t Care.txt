listen up, i donât trust you, i donât know why, maybe itâs your smile or something in your eyes, but who cares? I donât know you at all so it really doesnât matter anyway. i donât care about the shit you telling me, itâs probably all bullshit and fantasy, and if itâs not it makes no difference to me cause it doesnât really matter anyway. something aint right in the back of my mind, why are you so happy all the motherfuckin time, shut up, just get up and leave, why are you talking to me, i donât wanna know your problem they donât matter to me, i donât care, i donât give a fuck about you, you donât give a fuck about me, letâs stop wasting each otherâs time, i donât care, i donât think your being real to me and i donât care enough to find out so letâs part ways before it gets ugly. i donât care
