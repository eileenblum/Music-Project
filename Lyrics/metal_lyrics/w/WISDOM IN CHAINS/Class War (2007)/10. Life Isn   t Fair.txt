I had a teacher back where i was in school. he talked down to the little joey like a fuckin fool. he said :âlife ainât fair. your gonna find out quick. if you ever graduate you aint gonna be shitâ it was hard to concentre cause i have tourettes but iâm as smart as a motherfucker. donât forget i said to him â yeah youâre probably right. i guess you better start locking your shit at nightâ i was a nerdy little kid with a heart of gold. but this type of bullshit made my heart turn cold. I always had a hate for authority but now iâm over the edge. i wanna smash shit break shit. i was 11 and i wasnât gonna take shit. your life is over and your making me pay for it. that night his car got smashed with a brick. unfortunate but he found out quick. life isnât fair. life isnât fair if it ainât fair for me then it ainât fair for you
