no justice for the working man. we works our fingers to the bones of our bleeding hands for the crumbs of the rich and priviligied and they wonder why iâm filled with bitterness. I hate the system put in place to keep my people down. Theyâll never understand the reasons why hard times force crimes out of honest men. iâve seen it again and again and again. weâll never win and thatâs how it ends. iâll work my hardest till the day i die to provide for my family. If I get rich by a stroke of luck would you keep a close eye on me? and if I become what i hate the most. please shoot me in the fucking face. cause in all my years iâve learned one thing. thereâs no justice for the working man
