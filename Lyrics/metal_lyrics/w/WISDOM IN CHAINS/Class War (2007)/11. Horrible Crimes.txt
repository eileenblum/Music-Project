I Know about secrecy. iâve witnessed horrible crimes. iâve seen shit that litterally made me sick to my stomach But I canât tell sometimes the truth is a curse. You marry a secret for better or worse. iâve been privy to a few such things iâll carry forever and ever with me. you should never tell some secrets cause it could surely mean your death just push them out and shut your fuckin mouth until your final dying breath i know. donât say a word i never told
