He was burn to a world of pain. left on a doorstep out in the rain. the first of 7 kids starving in the hood. he never met his dad and his mom was no good. The neighborhood swallowed up many soul. itâs hard growing old in a world so cold but the world keeps turning. The smart keep learning the strong survive and hit the ground running. WOAH, Another survivor from the bowels of the ghetto. I didnât know he barely made it alive. thatâs why he said âSon, we gotta get out of here, thereâs no smile in the ghettoâ. He only wanted to give my family a life. thatâs my father. His mother married a child molester. ** ** was a son of a bitch. He brought an whole new level of fear. Drugs and rape and shit you donât wanna know. So He grew up fighting everyday. A futile attempt to protect his family. My dadâs a rock and I know why. I never saw him break and I never saw him cry. WOAH, Another survivor from the bowels of the ghetto. I didnât know he barely made it alive. thatâs why he said âSon, we gotta get out of here, thereâs no smile in the ghettoâ. He only wanted to give my family a life. thatâs my father. What more could i want to be than a man who would die for his family
