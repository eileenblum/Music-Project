Up above us the sky is falling, but the earth where we stands keeps growing and the second hand keep on going. never stopping. never slowing. weâre always working and working just trying to get paid.do what you want youâll never had it made. time never stops and death wonât wait. itâs countdown to our ultimate fate. you think itâs funny i play in this band, never making no money, living mouth to hand. iâve seen thw world with my best friends while you were in an office slaving fo the man. Uh oh gotta get anotherday job cause you canât afford to keep your lights on. Final secondes before your lifeâs gone. what the fuck did you waste your life on? weâre always working and working just trying yo get paid. weâre killing time everyday. itâs a countdown to the end of days
