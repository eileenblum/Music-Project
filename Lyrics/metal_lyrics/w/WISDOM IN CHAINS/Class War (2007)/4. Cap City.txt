hereâs another story bout a friday night, it was cold february ohio night, we were headed 80 west not a pig in sight. Trying to get columbus by daylight. quick stop in clearfield to pick up skams. NIck Giocka was there and the rest of the band. but friday night never go as planned. it was the last great trip in the wisdom van. we left town on a friday so we could reach cap city by saturday. Now weâre thinking hard cause we really gotta find a way to get back to stroudburg by sunday. Pulled up to Joey Knuckles at 3 am Richie Krutch crashed out in the back of the van but when he started sleeping the city started creepin. Richie woke up to the sound of rubber screechin. My dog is a soldier so he jumped up. some dude was driving like he paid for the truck. Richie grabbed him by the throat and began to smash cause heâs the type of brother that willgo out blastin. we left town on a friday so we could reach cap city by saturday now weâre thinking hard cause we really gotta find a way to get back to stroudsburg by sunday. Richie Krutch woke up in a fight today and the van got smahed on the highway. you donât wanna test Richie on any day. but thatâs enough of columbus for one day. donât sleep when youâre in cap city. itâs bad luck cause they creep all day. donât sleep when youâre in cap city if you do theyâll make you pay. We left town on a friday so we could reach cap city by saturday now weâre thinking hard cause we really gotta find a way to get back to stroudsburg by sunday. Richie Krutch woke up in a fight today and the van got smahed on the highway. you donât wanna test Richie on any day.but thatâs enough of columbus for one day.
