I donât wanna live in a world where i canât keep my children safe. sometimes i lie awake in the dark cause i canât stop thinking about it. Iâm surround by lunatics and racists always trying to test me. trying to test my patience, i know how hard this life can be. It can be lot harder that itâ was for me. whatâs the point in trying? is there and point in trying if you really canât change a thing? When i take a look at life I got the answer seems quite clear to me. i donât wanna live if i canât be with the people I love and the friends iâve made. So let it be known if i die today yâall mean the world to me, if i die today did i say all the things i had to say? if i die today how will the world remember me? if i die today to all my friends and family please understand why i say that i donât wanna live, not here. iâm not ashamed. this is who i am, my heart on my sleeve and blood on my hands. my youth is over and i had my fun. but now i gotta live for my little ones Until iâm gone iâll do wathever i can. i swear it over and over and over again. fuck you if you donât understand. too many of my homeys died for no reasons. thoses days are over and i myss my friends so i promised i would die to protect my fam..
