Jesus donât walk through the alleys. He must have forget how to find me. He used to hang around my family. but he never really understand me. God donât come around no more. I donât see a trace of him in this world. Poor men fighting in a rich manâs war. cause god donât come around here no more. too many murder on tv. too many babies in poverty. religion ainât shit but money. Priest in your pocket like a fuckin thief. God donât come around no more. I donât see a trace of him in this world. Poor men fighting in a rich manâs war. cause god donât come around here no more. The Devil comes walking softly. He always stands right behind me. I try to run away but he finds me. I wish that god would talk to me. God donât come around no more. I donât see a trace of him in this world. Poor men fighting in a rich manâs war. cause god donât come around here no more.
