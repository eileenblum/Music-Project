This is the sound of the end. itâs like a crushing destruction, smashing everything in sight and itâs coming for you, itâs gonna hold you, embrace you, squeeze you thight around the neck till you canât breathe no more. this is the sound of the end. There will be no shelter. no hiding, you can pray to god for help but heâs not listening to you. itâll be too late for redemption just accept the fate that we create,. itâs all that we can do this is the sound of the end
