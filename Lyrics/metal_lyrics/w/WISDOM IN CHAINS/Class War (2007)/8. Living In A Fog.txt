are we all living in a fog? narrow, misses and close calls plague is all. Blurry perception powerless against the inevitable fall. how many times is the right choice wrong and your chance is gone itâs harder to stand tall than it is to crawl. Just a roll of the dice and your life is gone. itâs all gone. everything you love dies and goes away. everything you love is temporary. everything you love dies and goes away.everything you love, you lose it all someday. love it while you can because one day itâll all be gone
