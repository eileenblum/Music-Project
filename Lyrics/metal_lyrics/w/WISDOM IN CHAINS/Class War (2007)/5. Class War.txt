One day I opened my eyes and I saw the world in a whole new light. There are barriers everywhere that go unseen. man made borders falling in between. lines that separate blacks and whites, browns, yellows and reds. We all should unite. the real line separate the rich and the poor and money is the root of every single war. letâs start a class war. it could be the last war weâll kill all their laughter when we kill off the masters. weâve been getting shit on since money was born and now i got kids, so it hurts me more. fuck your authority it doesnât mean shit thereâs no power like a working man fist. I swear iâll always be true to the cause and steal my bread from a rich man paws. iâll take what i want till i want no more and never give a fuck about rich man laws.letâs start a class war. it could be the last war weâll kill all their laughter when we kill off the masters.have you had enough? cause iâve had enough. letâs start the fire to burn babylon. itâs not fair but nothing ever is. so whyâs the apple always on their side of the fence? take what you want from the greedy pig pockets and cut them back down to size
