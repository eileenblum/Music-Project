It was a perfect kind of day
The kind you never want to end
Not a cloud in the crystal sky
Yea right what a bullshit sentiment
In a room with the curtains drawn
As the seconds ticked away
He contemplated life
To the guidance of a snub nosed .38
It was a perfect fuckin day
The kind of day you can't escape from
When the world feels dark and gray
And you know It's never gonna feel the same anymore
You can never push away the pain
Don't even try

The harder you push
The farther you drift off into space
I can hear him cry as the seconds slipped by

3 more ticks and I'll be just fine
2 more ticks and It's all behind
1 more tick to the borderline
No more ticks now your pain is mine

Now your pain has become mine
On a perfect kind of day
It was a perfect kind of day
