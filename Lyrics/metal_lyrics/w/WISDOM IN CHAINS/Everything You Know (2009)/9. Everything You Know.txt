Look what you've become
Gaze on your disgrace
As a nation with a sickness
Rotten down to the core
And we're way beyond remission
The perfect American life
The addiction to distraction
Education, force fed lies
Religious lullabies
Everything you know
Is a fucking bullshit lie
You swallow it down
And so did I
