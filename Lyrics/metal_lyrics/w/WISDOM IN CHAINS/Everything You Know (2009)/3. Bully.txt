Hey bully
You're nothing but a bully
A bully in blue and you're always scared
You might fool some with a badge and a gun
But no one on one
No you can't fool me

You're not the good guys who serve and protect
You're just another gang wit your foot on my neck
You trample our rights to look out for your crew
But nobody's left to protect us from you

Hey bully
You're nothing but a bully
A bully ind blue and you're always scared
You might fool some with a badge and a gun
But no one on one
No you can't fool me
One on one in the street
