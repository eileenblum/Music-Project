You have been found guilty
Guilty of being a typical ordinary human being
Guilty because you need to be told what to think, what to do
You need to be told what to say, how to live
You are guilty
Because everything you know is a fucking bullshit lie
You will be sentenced
To live a foul displacable disgusting life amongst filthy souls
You will be condemned to drown in an ice cold ocean of lies
You will watch as all your peers disappear and die around you
One by one
There is no hope for you
Your lungs will be filled with rhetoric of your leader
