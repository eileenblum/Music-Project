I gotta tell you some things before you get to old
Nothing makes me happier than playing in the road
We play basketball and skateboard morning noon and night
Throwing the football and learning how to fight

She's my hardcore girl, she's strong and beautiful
He's my hardcore boy, never listens to the rules
You're my hardcore kids and even when you bad
You make me proud to be your straight edge dad

I love you so much, I wanna teach you everything I know
About Hardcore, Punkrock, Rap and Rock'n'Roll
Stay away from drugs and always stick together
When the world turns it's back you can count on each other
That's real
