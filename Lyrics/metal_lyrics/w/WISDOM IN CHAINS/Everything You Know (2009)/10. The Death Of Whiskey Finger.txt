The first time I heard of him
I was no more than 5 years old
He beat up some old lady
Took the cash and left the body in the road
They called him Whiskey Finger
He was born for the slammer
He treated everybody the same
Always down to brawl he said
"Fuck 'em all, just remember my fuckin name."
He took whatever he wanted
With no remorse or shame
He said " You wanna come strong you better come heavy
or I'll make you learn my fuckin name."
So one day Whiskey snatched some rocks
From a kid on the block
And he hid him in the weeds behind the bank
But the kid was juiced and when he turned him loose
He was getting his revenge anyway
He said "Motherfucker your time is up
I'm gonna snuff out your flame."
Whiskey said "Me and you, do what you gotta do
Just remember my fuckin name
My name is Whiskey and I was born in the gutter
I'll do anything for the fame."
But when the brothers come strong
You know they come heavy
Now he's nothing but a fucking name
