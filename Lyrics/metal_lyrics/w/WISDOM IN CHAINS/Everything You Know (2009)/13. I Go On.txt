Can you follow me if I fly
Will you give up life if I choose to die
Will you say my name when the time comes
Or betray your own words just to please some
Building a life only to be torn down
Pleasing the masses and bowing to the crown
Not me cause I don't care if I win
In this life I'll question everything

Woah I go
I go on and on

It could all be over as quick as you can blink
Did you ever stop and wonder?
Did you ever stop to think?
Do you really need possessions?
I don't think they matter much
My only true desire is for something I'll never touch

I got no time
No time for worrying
I got no time
No time for wasting
I got no time
No time for hesitate
I got no time
Cause it ain't my time to waste

If I could subtract a single breath
From every day that I got left
Could I ever repay that debt?
Give me an answer if you know the answer
I tried to take this world on my own
I thought my heart was made of stone
But I found out recently
The world a whole lot bigger than me

Woah I go
I go on and on
