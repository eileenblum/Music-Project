Who's running this world we live in
We keep screaming but nobody listens
How many times can I swallow my pride
And let blood soaked dollar control my life
keeping order with bullshit rules
The educated demons run the educated fools
The working class, we're non educated tools
They're gonna beat you down until you give in

Born in captivity but how I dreamed of liberty
I've never felt equality in this life
I've never seen morality
And I can't take it anymore
I give them everything but they still want more
The blood and sweat and tears are free
But the cost of living is killing me

Homeless sleep in their homemade coffins
But working class sees a home less often
If I was in charge like I wish I was
I'd reprioritize the world
We spend a trillion putting men on the moon
But we're dying in the streets of our capital
We gotta get out
We gotta break shit burn shit to the ground
Make them fear us when they hear the sound

Born in captivity but how I dreamed of liberty
I've never felt equality in this life
I've never seen morality
And I can't take it anymore
I give them everything but they still want more
The blood and sweat and tears are free
But the cost of living is killing me

You want power? Let's take it!
If they try to stop us we'll break them
You want power? Let's take it!
If they try to stop us we'll tear the system down!
