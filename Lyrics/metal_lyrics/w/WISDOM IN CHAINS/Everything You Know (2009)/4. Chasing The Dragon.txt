I've been hooked since the first hit I ever took
They warned me not to go inside but I had to take a look
I stepped down into a smokey room
I'm getting stared at hard so I kept on stepping

Right up to the line just to wait my turn
I started to sweat and my eyes were burning
When I felt him through the smoke just out of sight
He said, "Son are you ready for the rest of your life?"
I said, " Gimme gimme please gimme please Mr. Pusher Man
I don't think you know what it means to me
I gotta gotta have it. Do you understand?
I gotta know how it feels when your mind is free."

Now I know how it feels to fly
My eyes are wide open and my soul's on fire
All those years I was living a lie
But last night Hardcore saved my life
There's nothing I can do and there's nothing I can say
I'll be chasing the dragon till the fire goes away
It's the truth in the anger and the feeling in the sound
For the rest of my time on earth I'll chase that dragon down

Now I'm grown and I can't past it
The way I get chills when the music's blasting
I never found nothing that could move me like this
With a fist in the air I must resist
Young and old, boys and girls
In every color around the world
We gather together every couple days
To honor the ones that paved the way
Oh no I can't stop
I got marks on my skin and I'm ready to go
It's in my veins and it's in my soul
I love Hardcore Punk Rock'n'Roll

Now I know how it feels to fly
My eyes are wide open and my soul's on fire
All those years I was living a lie
But last night Hardcore saved my life
There's nothing I can do and there's nothing I can say
I'll be chasing the dragon till the fire goes away
It's the truth in the anger and the feeling in the sound
For the rest of my time on earth I'll chase that dragon down

It's like my soul's on fire
For the rest of my time on earth I'll chase that dragon down
