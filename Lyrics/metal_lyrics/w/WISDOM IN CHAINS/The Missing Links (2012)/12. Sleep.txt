Your eyes starts drifting away
And times keeps slipping away

Sleep, it never comes easy if it even comes at all
But that's probably for the best
You can keep you rest 'cause I don't want it anymore
It steals my time
A waste of life
A waste of breath
A drain on my sanity
I walk alone at night
Just waiting for the day

I'll never sleep again
I don't want it, I don't need it anymore
[x2]

I never sleep
I lie down, I toss and turn all night
I get up and pace the floors
Until the dark turns into night
I never sleep
She's coming, she's trying to steal my breath
But I stay strong
I won't be charmed by the cousin of death

Sleep, it never comes cheap
Believe she's coming to harvest the weak
She whispers softly with gentle sighs
If you lie down never close both eyes
That tired feeling isn't real - It's a trap
The devil needs a soul to steal
It's a battle of wills, a nocturnal fight
You gotta outlast the night

I'll never sleep again
I don't want it, I don't need it anymore
[x2]

I never sleep
I lie down, I toss and turn all night
I get up and pace the floors
Until the dark turns into night
I never sleep
She's coming, she's trying to steal my breath
But I stay strong
I won't be charmed by the cousin of death

Stay awake
