Thinking back on a promise I made a lifetime ago
I look in your eyes and I know I'm home
The world's falling down around us
This world is always testing us just to see
How much we'll take until we break and fall apart
But I've never been a weakling
So I'm telling you now like I told you then

Whether we laugh or if we cry
Make no mistake, I want you by my side
I'll do whatever it's gonna take
To give you what you need, I'll keep you safe
If it's mine, then it's yours
There's no separation anymore because we came together
That's how I wanna leave
I'll carry that burden till my heart don't bleed
And I ain't going out without a fight

A simple resolution has become who I am
This is my constitution
It goes deeper than paper and pen
Much deeper than words
It means more now than it did back then
Life is cruel if you can't rely on the ones you love
But I've never been a quitter
I told you then but I'm gonna say it again

Whether we laugh or if we cry
Make no mistake, I want you by my side
I'll do whatever it's gonna take
To give you what you need, I'll keep you safe
If it's mine, then it's yours
There's no separation anymore because we came together
That's how I wanna leave
I'll carry that burden till my heart don't bleed
And I ain't going out without a fight
