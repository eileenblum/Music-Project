My friend if I tell you one thing in my life, let it be this
You have to stick by your family
And know the difference from your friends and from your enemies
You have to be strong and pay your dues
You have to stand up for yourself, and never be used
You need to know you're loved and I care
Remember one thing
I'll always be there

Whoa my friend
Times may change, it all may end
Whoa my friend
Look what we got - we're here again
I don't need much, just my family and you
Be there for me, and I'll be there for you
And I promise you
We'll fight our way out with our backs against the wall

Not much is more important
Than true friends in this life
You may move on and go your own way
But I'm telling you that's all right
Because you know when I need you
You're just a call away
And I know you'll do the right thing
And drop everything to be with me

Whoa my friend [x2]

You know what
It's hard to even imagine
Not having you guys around

I don't need much just my family and you
You're gonna be there for me, and me for you
I'm gonna tell you how I feel once and for all
We will fight with our backs against the wall

Whoa my friend
Times may change, it all may end
Whoa my friend
Look what we got - we're here again
I don't need much, just my family and you
You gotta be there for me, and me for you
And I promise you
We'll fight our way out with our backs against the wall

Whoa my friend
