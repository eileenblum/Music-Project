I'll fucking kill you
And I'll kill everything you love if you ever try to fuck with me again
This is our story
So don't think for a second you're immune to the common flaw of man

It goes âpeace to my family, death to my enemiesâ since the human race began
We are loyal and protective
But violence and vengeance
Can steer us directly to an end

So peace to my family, death to my enemies

Peace to my family
And death to my enemies

Peace to my family

Death to my enemies
