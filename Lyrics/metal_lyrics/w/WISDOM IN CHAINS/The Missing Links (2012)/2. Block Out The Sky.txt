Don't you dare try to look away
You burned the sea and torched the sky
You drilled the earth and sucked it dry
You killed the world, you let it die
Don't you dare try to look away

Outside you're a demon, inside you're a ghost
Revered by many, unseen by most
You murder nations with no remorse
Don't you dare try to look away

Don't turn from the damage that you've done
Black out the sky, black out the sun
Twisted faces looking back
They see you have no honor

A prison planet on its knees
Imprisoned people, everyone
We are the dominant disease
Black out the sky, black out the sun

No, don't you dare try to look away
