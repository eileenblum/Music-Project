Let me tell you about a friend I knew
I loved Buddy and he loved me too
Let me tell you about a friend I knew
And now I see reminders in every room

We locked eyes as he passed away
Just like we locked eyes on the very first day
Let me tell you about a friend I knew
His love was unconditional

Whoa - Ghosts of Buddy are all I see
Whoa - But I don't mind the old boy haunting me

Let me tell you about a friend I see
I feel you standing next to me
Let me tell you about a friend I see
I get chills every time that I see your leash

In the bedroom, in the floorboards
In the gravestone where we buried you in the backyard
Let me tell you about a friend I see
When I close my eyes you're running through my dreams

Whoa - Ghosts of Buddy are all I see
Whoa - But I don't mind the old boy haunting me

Hey! I heard you sigh in the night and it woke me from a dream
Hey! One time I swear you were scratching at the back door
Hey Hey! Two times I saw your shadow sitting at the foot of my bed
Hey! I hope you find peace
And one day run with Nase through fields of green

Whoa - Ghosts of Buddy are all I see
Whoa - But I don't mind the old boy haunting me
