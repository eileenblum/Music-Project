The hard truth is better than a comfortable lie so
Who are we really, I'm feeling so deprived
Give me the answers I've always tried to find
Through books written way before my time

Those tales of men who were so wise
Manipulating a truth so well disguised
Those tales of life after the tides wiped it all away
Mistakes they tried to hide

Who were we before Eve gave us life
And who is Adam, an experiment, a guise?
Who am I, an experiment, a lie
I feel we're all blind to the truth but where does it lie?

It's all written but we won't look or listen
There's too much pain in the truth, in that wisdom
We're all links in a chain, but something's missing
Maybe the answer's in a place not so distant

Where do we come from, that's the plight of humankind
Are those ancient ruins a reference, a time line?
Did they come to ruin us or help define
What we would ultimately become in due time

If those stories of gods enslaving minds
Holds any weight then I've defied my kind
There's no glory in tainting human life
But I'm no follower so I still search to find

Some sign that there's more to this life
The folklore and religions that divide
It's all true or it's all a fucking lie
It's all proof none of us know where our souls reside

It's all written but we won't look or listen
There's too much pain in the truth, in that wisdom
We're all links in a chain, but something's missing
Maybe the answer's in a place not so distant
