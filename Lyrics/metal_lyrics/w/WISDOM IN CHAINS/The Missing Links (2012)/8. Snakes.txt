You dumb motherfucker
You sold it all for a bowl of beans
Now you gotta live with it

I'm done with you, I'm writing you off
You tried to fake me out, but dumb motherfuckers get caught
It's a small-small world and I got eyes and ears that's everywhere
You can't talk to people that talk to me
About shit you don't want me to hear
Cos when it gets back to me I'll be madder than a motherfucker ready to fight

Fuck you! You never should have lied to me
I remember every word that you ever said
Fuck you! You never should have lied to me
Why you wanna be my enemy?
Fuck you! I can't believe the shit you do to a friend again and again
Fuck you! You never should have lied to me
I don't trust you fucking snakes

If you believe in the good book
History says that a snake told the very first lie
I guess you chose your path
And now you have to live with regrets
And the shame that comes with your name until you die

Fuck you!
We should have been like family
But you saw it differently
Now there's nothing that I can do
Fuck you!
Do you got something to prove?
Or maybe you don't like the crew
And you thought you had to choose
Fuck you!
We can take it to the streets
If you really wanna settle the beef
But I'm content with letting you keep your fucking distance
Fuck you!
I don't follow scene politics
I just really love this music
And I got no time for the extra curricular bullshit

If you got no time for me than I say that we let it be
I know hardcore from beginning to end
It's the same old story again

You never should have lied to me
I remember every word that you ever said
Fuck you! You never should have lied to me
Why you wanna be my enemy?
Fuck you! I can't believe the shit you do to a friend again and again
Fuck you! You never should have lied to me
I don't trust you anymore
I don't trust you fucking snakes
