I never liked to wander
Far from my home
But sometimes my bones get restless
Like they're telling me it's time to go
So if you can't reach me
And wonder where I've been
Baby please don't worry
Please just smile for me cos I'm traveling

But you know that you're with me
For every step I take
And I will never walk alone
You're right here with me all the way
And I carry inside me all the love you ever gave
And it keeps me warm at night
Whether I'm close or far away

I never liked to wander
Far from my home
But sometimes my bones get restless
Like they're telling me it's time to go
So if you can't reach me
And wonder where I've been
Baby please don't worry
Please just smile for me cos I'm traveling

Then it happens when the time comes
When I'm lost and all alone
A reminder, a momento
Gotta find my way back home
So I reach out to the unknown
Cos I know you're always there
Always pulling me back to you like a signal in the air

When I leave this body
And I reach the stars
There's no need to worry
Don't cry for me cause I'm traveling
