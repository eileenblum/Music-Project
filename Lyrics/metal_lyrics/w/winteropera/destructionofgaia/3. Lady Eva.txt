I fall, have I loved?
Did you say it was forever?
All  the lifetime and everywhere
The dream of you is away forever
Life has changed, in a better way
Who had said you'd be the one for me?
Only one lie, you and me
Take my breath and go away with him

Oh Lady Eva
You've nothin' to give
Oh Lady Eva
Much more I can feel
Oh Lady Eva
Without you I can live
Without you I can live

Nine cycles, crucified
My life drowns in what you called a game
All my past time has been denied
Seasons change and things remain the same

Oh Lady Eva
You've nothin' to give
Oh Lady Eva
Much more I can feel
Oh Lady Eva
Without you I can live
Without you I can live

Oh Lady Eva
You've nothin' to give
Oh Lady Eva
Much more I can feel
Oh Lady Eva
Without you I can live
Without you I can live

Oh Lady Eva
Without you I can live
