Like a spirit he rides
'till the night becomes light
Always fights where he must
He cannot deny
But he lost his old past
He forgot
He remembers only a word

Evil carries inside
So many lies
Always at war
With the angels of life
The wolf is creepin' inside
Of your soul
And he's tryin' to stay alive!

Fight the night
The sorrow, the pain
Holy power
In your holy name!

Gabriel
Your true name it is
Don't forget
The will of God
Gabriel
Just fight forever
And save us
From the unknown

As a mirror reflecting
The light of the night
You gave us new life
Became our guide
Conceived to be child of Rome
And to be
Servant of the holy church

Fight the night
The sorrow, the pain
Holy power
In your holy name!

Gabriel
Your true name it is
Don't forget
The will of God
Gabriel
Just fight forever
And save us
From the unknown

Gabriel
Your true name it is
Don't forget
The will of God
Gabriel
Just fight forever
And save us
From the unknown
