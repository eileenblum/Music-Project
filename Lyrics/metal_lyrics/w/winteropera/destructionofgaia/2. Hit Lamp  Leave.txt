One land
One brave man
One outline on the sand
Bringer of woe
He comes to claim the land
He wants to kill again
Lonely oath
And blasphemy
Dead creatures from Hell
The burnin' flame
A struggle in the night
You'd better run away

And the voices of a dark lord
Of a lightning in the night
Never feared so much a man, a demon
Feel the touch of his dark vengeance
It is like the frozen blade
Of a demon with a bloody name

I hit &amp; leave
With my sword I
Will destroy your world
Wastin' your souls
I will last
'till my death

A settlement
I'll taste
The sweet flavour of men
Their foolish mind
I will take the whole night
To quench my thirst with them

And the voices of a dark lord
Of a lightning in the night
Never feared so much a man, a demon
Feel the touch of his dark vengeance
It is like the frozen blade
Of a demon with a bloody name

I hit &amp; leave
With my sword I
Will destroy your world
Wastin' your souls
I will last
'till my death [x2]
