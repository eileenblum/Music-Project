I'm lookin' the moonlight
Lost in the place where ice burns
I'm leavin' the moonshine
I don't know where i will go
And in the shadows
Defeat the plunderer forces
I've lost my pleasure
Feel people's tears in the world

Destruction of Gaia
Destruction of world
Destruction of Gaia
Destruction of world

And lost through shadows
I look for my way
And lost in blindness
I'll finally be safe
And lost through shadows
I look for my way
And lost in blindness
The hammer of faith

I'm ridin' my journey
Now I know what's to be done
My armour is brightenin'
Under the light of the gods
And in the shadows
Defeat the plunderers force
I've lost my pleasure
Feel people's tears in the world

Destruction of Gaia
Destruction of world
Destruction of Gaia
Destruction of world
