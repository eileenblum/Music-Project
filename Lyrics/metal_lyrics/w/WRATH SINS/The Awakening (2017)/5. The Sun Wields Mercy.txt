Cast me aside as it breaks behind the veil
The colours and temptation where scorched skies bore no change
How many time can you take the strain! Endure the pain and do it all again
To avenge isolation of this heart hidden away

When rivers flood and break obscurity
The horizon burns through the clock ticking
Light burns out from my only star! Suspending

Building the walls to enclosure us in! That beheld the flames
When I was giving in it was what kept me sane
Watching heart grow with desire! Forbid the sins! The fire!
While the sun kept the dark away it shined the truth so grey

When rivers flood and break obscurity
The horizon burns through the clock ticking
Light burns out from my only star! Suspending...

Illusions between the lines
I'm looking up into the sky
The sun wields mercy in your eyes

How many times I wished to fall asleep
To find a way out to reach
The dust won't settle until the land it's flood
Until her hands are filled with my own blood

Illusions between the lines
I'm looking up into the sky
The sun wields mercy in your eyes
