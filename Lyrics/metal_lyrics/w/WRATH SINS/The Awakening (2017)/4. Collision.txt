Master of disguise set who bares the suffocating sight
Emerging in light through the blackest of the seas
Turn away from the sun, impurity of the chosen one
Shapes through every flaw ungraved setting you on your knees!

As the voice of the voiceless remain
Confined remains! The cold still burns the heart away

Colliding drift me into sleep
Inhale towards the enemy!
Throughout a thought collides
And drifts me into sleep!

Immersed in darkness, transparent boiling way
To expose this vile creature upon the light of day
What remorseless emperor commands your lying being
Erupting the snake upon the beauty of your skin

Brought from the cruelty of desire
Collision bears love and pain
Will dark be bright? Will cold be warm? Will it be someday?

Colliding drift me into sleep
Inhale towards the enemy!
Throughout a thought collides
And drifts me into sleep!

The cold still burns the heart
As gravity holds it down!
