Paralysed over the silence around this venomous maze
Spreading through what I've become, as promise not to break
The truth becomes so clear now that faith has died
Now see what waits for you on the other side

With no reflection it drifts away
The light to follow through and touch the light of day
With no ascension the dream is gone
In search for solitude now that we've become one!

It wasn't meant to end
Through this passages alone I'm closer to death
Behind the mask let the stones drop over

Venom lingers upon his tongue to mask the fear of the unknown
Confined in darkness while looming screams become dethroned
Misleading figures contend the purest minds
Where light does not tread and death makes it blind

With no reflection it drifts away
The light to follow through and touch the light of day
With no ascension the dream is gone
In search for solitude now that we've become one!

It wasn't meant to end
Through this passages alone I'm closer to death
Behind the mask let the stones drop over

Let the stones drop over, let the pain run it's course
The sun will rise between the lines
Until death takes over
