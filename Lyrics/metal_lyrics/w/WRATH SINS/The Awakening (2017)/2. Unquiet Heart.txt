When all the darkness took the light
Blinding the truth we kept inside
Rewriting rules that now we bend
To overcome this riddle's end

Lost between the cracks in silence
An unquiet heart lives on his own
The haunting shadows search for blood
Into the mirror I used to know

Let the silence speak! Throughout illusions breathe

When all love was devoured
Like the fall of an avalanche
The skies turned black! The candles burned!
Piercing the flesh!

I've searched through and through
Into the blurred lines I once knew
Who hide the stone you called a heart
Lost for the wicked below

Let the silence speak! Destroy the past and start anew
I'd rather fade away that be dreaming awake with you

Where does all the light go? I'm hiding inside, until it starts to show
While the sun does not appear to this unquiet heart!
Where does all the light go? I'm trapped inside, I can't let go
From the mask that I most fear! To this unquiet heart!

Silence! Heart the beat of this unquiet heart!
Look beyond! And you'll see the pointers on the clock restart!

Where does all the light go? I'm hiding inside, until it starts to show
While the sun does not appear to this unquiet heart!
Where does all the light go? I'm trapped inside, I can't let go
From the mask that I most fear! To this unquiet heart!
