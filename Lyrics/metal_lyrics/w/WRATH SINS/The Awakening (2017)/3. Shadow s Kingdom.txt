Forsaken by the gods that shaped me through
The sands of time in complete misery
Lost in myself I bare the weight lost from within
Igniting the flames the shadow awaits the dream inside of you

Enough to see your halo fall
To bring and end to it all

Slipping away through my hands
As the tides run I wonder where we are
The sun it's burned out black
Slipping within my hands

Burst out of this tangled kingdom which never sleeps
I asked for death but instead I'm awake waiting for defeat
The frozen cold corroding the inside
Look in my eyes I need to see them through and what they hide

Enough to see your halo fall, to silence your words
To bring an end to it all, we watches down his throne

Like time it's standing still
The mask breaks as the snake frees itself and turns real
The hourglass I face behind those raged eyes
It's ceasing to deplete as I walk the fallout

Slipping away through my hands
As the tides run I wonder where we are
The sun it's burned out black
Slipping within

The sun is rising through the black within
As the tides stopped running, within my skin
