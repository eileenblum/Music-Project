Deeper and deeper rot to the bone as we'll continue to fight in my dreams until you'll die alone
Ice cold, hands shaking! Your world it's fucked and it'll be mine
As I'll be taking over
Nothing is hidden that will not become evident
Secrets concealed and sealed upon
Doubts against this deathless endless mask
Pressurized within and forcing to react

Open your eyes!
Let the sun right in! Pull your old sin, into your awakening!

Breathe in, breathe out, breathing the lies
That I can't inhale through vengeance and breakout
From my own grave I watched but now I truly see
The sun as shade turning love against me

With eyes open wide! It hides no more!
Though I found the end, the start was at the door!

Open your eyes!
Let the sun right in! Pull your old sin, into your awakening!

Nothing is hidden that will not become evident
Secrets concealed and sealed upon
Doubts against this deathless endless mask
Pressurized within and forcing to

Open your eyes!
Let the sun right in! Pull your old sin, into your awakening!
