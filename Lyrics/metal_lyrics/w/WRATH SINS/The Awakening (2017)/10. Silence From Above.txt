Breaking the path where light surrounded me
Throughout the past reborn i hear them devouring
Cleared the fog that was veiled with selfish rites
At the end the promise of one more chance in life

From the edges of the void dark words are spoken
Circling around unvoiced fear creates itself
Unbroken! The strength! To get finally free
Taken from the time you've stolen love from me

Show me the light! Let it sink in by the shadow of the night
Show me true light!

Betrayer of my thoughts the snake shows no repent
Darkness devours the light and sets to forget
As near you fear to stand by the wisdom of mistakes
Never right never wrong but always ours to make

It's said the past it's written in the skies
As shadow collides with the heart beside the light dies

Show me the light! Let it sink in by the shadow of the night
Show me true light! Silence from above that shines so bright
To this unquiet heart meet the the light!
