Tired eyes shocked into a daze
A shattered hope thrown to the ground
The clouds turn into the blackest grey
To glaze the rain pouring down

How quick the seasons change
The horrors seen through a thousand lies
When every breathe hurts I'll arrange
To breathe deeper sever the ties

Shrouded in darkness when all control it's lost
A snake amongst has soured the soil that we've been crossing
We've been so long here, a curse haunting through which dawn
It has formed a wreath around, no bound, no escape for us

Ascend! Above! From the ashes of this world
Embrace the loss! The flickering hidden ghost
Ascend and watch as I control
Embrace the fall over the path I laid for you

Silence screams between the cracks around the stones apart
Where rest my heart to find the fear of the unseen

Sacrifice! Mesmerize! The voice that poisons and chokes inside
Break the shackles! Break free from the sound
Hear the heart beat and face the fears to make them drown

Silence screams between the cracks around the stones apart
Where rest my heart to find out the fear of the unseen
