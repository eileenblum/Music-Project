Ignites the existence to where the waves break
Colliding with decisions impossible to make
Contradictory pieces of an insufficient frame
Unraveled into realities where I became

Motionless relying on the flip of a coin
As subjective nature rejoins

Embodying a life that is to live forward
Why do we understand it on reverse
We began in patterns so fuckin' uncolored
And we're bleeding through a reality so adverse

Every step I collide with glass
Every move outcomes the last

Arms of sleep embrace
Multi-dimensional place
Seeing my existence fade
To where the waves break

There's no constraint when the walls cave in
No sense of purpose to begin
It suffocates inside all I used to rely
Disturbed state of consciousness
Evolving due the lack of time
It suffocates inside all I knew and applied

Arms of sleep embrace
Multi-dimensional place
Seeing my existence fade
To where the waves break
