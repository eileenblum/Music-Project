All the screams i screamed unheard
Never ending streams colliding
Tired of sleepiness which is not enough to sleep
Too much grains of sand in the hourglass to keep

Struggling to find the truth beyond the lies
My life was a lie that became true
Buried thoughts distant from reality
Gave birth to my insanity

Wounds inflicted a bloodstained soul
Like a bird without wings
Choirs of devastation sings in sight
Flashbacks turn into daylight

Hope it's a remedy but so far it didn't heal
Have I fallen in oblivion to my god
Inner voices speak embraced
Is this the race of the human race

Suspension! Of reason
Reflection! Of my own prison

Untying the strings that rely upon my dreams
Eclipsing my own path
Bleak shades become familiar replacing my interior
Breathing life out of me

Crawling towards a bitter end
Emerging ghosts which I tried to mend
Crawling towards the upcoming sunset
Unable to reach that silhouette

Suspension! Of reason
Reflection! Of my own prison
