Final sunset descending into shades of lament
Depraved words uttered beneath my cold fragment
The blackout foreshadows the chaos blurring way
Fighting through oceans of adversity and decay

Draining the light as the fortress is caving in
Sewing the seeds of doubt within
Sleeping through life, unable us to dream at all
Misleading the wildfires to stand tall

The sting of reality crashes a tangible insight
As the first sound approaches, then the lightning strike
Craving for comfort in powers beyond control
Confined to the horrors severed from the rivers flow

Draining the light as the fortress is caving in
Sewing the seeds of doubt within
Sleeping through life unable us to dream at all
Misleading the wildfires to stand

Severed! Beyond what eyes can see
Torned open lifelessly
The sun behind us hides! Where my oblivion dwells

Darkness breathing life, piercing my every bone
In oblivion we dwell, as we turn to stone

Against the current in a never-ending maze
We watch the colours fade
Through your garden's grey as the rain builds the trails
To flower better days

Through the dawn as the vultures circle around
I clench my fist to amend this broken bound
Tunnels of light capture the symbols in the stones
Imprisoned reality from the dreams

Where My Oblivion Dwells
Where My Oblivion Dwells

Severed! Beyond what eyes can see
Torned open lifelessly
The sun behind us hides! Where my oblivion dwells
