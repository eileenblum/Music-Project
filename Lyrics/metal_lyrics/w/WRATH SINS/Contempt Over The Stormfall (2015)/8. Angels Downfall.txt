Foretold through ages of fear
As I stand paralyzed and near
From the voices who silent scream
And terrorize the most chocking dream

When reality draws to halt, the vision becomes clearly tied
Echoing through the dawn as new light breaks the sky

Digging! Behind these broken walls as the world falls
Into The Fire! Angels crash the ground!
Say farewell when it all falls down!

Open your eyes
Bursting inside from all this ties
Converging as this path leads straight
Cycling through blood this endless hate

The Skies will conspire against you when the days grow colder
Crawling under your skin as you become the beholder

Digging!! Behind these broken walls as the world falls
Into! The! Fire! Angels crash the ground!
Say farewell when it all falls down!

Shatter what's left from the sky, possessing the archetype
Who drags us to the depths of core and to this endless war
