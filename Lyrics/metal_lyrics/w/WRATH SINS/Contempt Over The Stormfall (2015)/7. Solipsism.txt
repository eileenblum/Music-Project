Flooding from the oblivion we combust
Inside while sky burns to dust
The scriptures they heed
Mislead them to neglect a thirst no wind can disconnect

Rivers run to take away
The whispers of truth between us for display
While concede rises
For us to reclaim what it's ours to remain

Bleeding through this lacerations
As we try to feed the pain
As cold inside as it can be
There's no turning away

We are the thorn! The shadows cutting all you fear
We are the thorn! In the shadow's mist you'll disappear

Beneath and through time reborn
Within change and haze this ghostly place we scorn
With a deathly haze
A pressure so dense wrapped us in suspense

Dystopia consuming the mind
Becoming the purpose for us to confine
And turned away
From the sun and lies who obfuscate what's left inside

Bleeding through this lacerations
As we try to feed the pain
As cold inside as it can be
There's no turning away

We are the thorn! The shadows cutting all you fear!
We are the thorn! In the shadow's mist you'll disappear!
