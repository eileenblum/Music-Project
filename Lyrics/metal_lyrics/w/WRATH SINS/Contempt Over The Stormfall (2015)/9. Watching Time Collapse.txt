I think therefore I am
Human imminent collapse
Weakness of sick minds
On the path to not believe what blinds

Hours of regret to realize
And see life flash before my eyes
Possessed by deeper sense
The answers fall beneath consequence

Casted into this damnation
As I reside between this lines
From the pages of desolation
We watch! We fear! We feel time collapse!

Searching blind for answers near
More ideals turn to sand and fear
I have seen through others eyes
Such things I fear to see with mine

The wire of eternity twists around
All answers already to be found
No matter how tightly I hold on
I still slip on the pattern we construct

Casted into this damnation
As I reside between this lines
From the pages of desolation
We watch! We fear! We feel time collapse!

Paralyzed to breakthrough
Seeing my path divided in two
The clock is ticking so damn fast
Erasing me bit by bit until the last

No place where to run as the night will overcome
No place where to run as we get closer to the sun
