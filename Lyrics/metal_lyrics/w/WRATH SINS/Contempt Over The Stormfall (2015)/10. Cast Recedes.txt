Against the stream we swim, oppressed to desecrate
Shades of reasoning, corporations of hate

Numbing decay sucks will of life away
Fate is cruel when dreams, like candles fade
Bankrupted hearts use philosophy in vain
When there's nothing left to gain

As the curtain calls and the cast recedes
The fire deep inside! Hold in a shacked web of conspiracy
Imposed by a masked, imposed by tyranny

Blank their state of mind, broadcasted false pacifies
Programs align to hostage our minds

Numbing decay sucks will of life away
Fate is cruel when dreams like candles fade
Bankrupted hearts use philosophy in vain
When there's nothing left to gain

As the curtain calls and the cast recedes
The fire deep inside! Hold in a shacked web of conspiracy
Imposed by a masked, imposed by tyranny

Numbing decay sucks will of life away
Fate is cruel when dreams like candles fade
