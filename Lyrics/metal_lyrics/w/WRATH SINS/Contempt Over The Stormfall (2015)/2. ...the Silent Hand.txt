Submit to me and embrace the path to be
Silenced and numb for what is yet to come
Echoing through the stones where the wind chilled my bones
Blindfolded and locked peering through the trees concocted

All the times we denied slipping further side by side
Drained of all belief like that one last falling leaf
A search that never ended a remainder of pain
The footsteps getting closer I'll see your ghost again

Suffocating! By the silent hand
Eradicated! Perishing through the sand

Terrified to realign the silence burning in my mind
Buried dreams will wither dry with sorrow as my guide
I will reclaim what is mine with vengeance in my sight
Making blood spill over night as the storm rolls the light

Suffocating! By the silent hand
Eradicated! Perishing through the sand

Inherent through the sands of time
Twisted by the torment to re-align
From the nightmares of thunderous skies
In the realm of the one who defies

The silent hand! Reaching through harbors of purity
The silent hand! Beyond all the blood pulsing inside

The end is near
The end where the end begins to fear
