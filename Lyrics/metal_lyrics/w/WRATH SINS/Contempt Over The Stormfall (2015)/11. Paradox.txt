Movement lurking
Imprisoned dreams paradoxical
Many ways, many words slipping through
Every unnamed lusted obstacle

Behind blur it disarrays
This disillusion displays
As this dreams come to its grim end
A thousand winters faded grey

Memory is the sadness that we keep
Seeing past the veil we found the weak
Love and grace settling the score
With the odds stacking up

Opened mirage
Soothes your sense new environment
Behind the shadows the reckoning
Of cowards newest ornament

Stone gardens in decay
Standing before on the patched way
The sightless wait oblivious
Slipping through a different scent to stray

Memory is the sadness that we keep
Seeing past the veil we found the weak
Love and grace settling the score
With the odds stacking up

Ascending! As the cycle repeats
The same mistakes we struggle to defeat
The winds of change don?t change a bit
For us or the snakes of truth we try to keep

Sickening sights of the same old skin
The same victims, the same sins
The voice heard it?s the voice of gleam
As it unleashes a tormented fucking scream

Terrified! By the visions of our demise
And realise! Through silence my fears arise
