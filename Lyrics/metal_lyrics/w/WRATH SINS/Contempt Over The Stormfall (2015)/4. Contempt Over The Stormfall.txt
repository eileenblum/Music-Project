Chaos is order yet undeciphered
From those who are broken like cipher
Coming through exile and through exile alone
As deaf ears listen to the evil shown

The darkness you feel! All you feel it's real
Tis the contempt over the stormfall
The feels you deny! Beneath a sunken sky
Tis the contempt over the stormfall

Imprisoned in obscurity I blend
Crawling towards my own bitter end
What could have been but never was
Listen the world til' it is no more

The darkness you feel! All you feel is real
Tis the contempt over the stormfall
The feels you deny! Beneath a sunken sky
Tis the contempt over the stormfall

Contrive! As fire built the mind
The chasm is growing
Alive! As fear sets to wind
The storm is forgoing

Visions accelerate beyond the curse of time
Projecting our fears on death to survive
The sky rips open, the oceans rise
Breaking into the storm for my own demise
