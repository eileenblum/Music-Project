Denounce the emptiness defined through
The dark mask descending upon you
Captured in a sea of consequence
Dragging myself engulfed in
My own seeds of wrath

Spinning webs of timeless confusion
Whose clocks tick beyond...

The story that unfolds as the twist holds
Still unscathed the drawings still last
Inside painted over your black sky
Swallow that pride before it swallows you

Spinning webs of timeless confusion
Whose clocks tick

Free! Yet held inside this place
Where my nightmares I come to face
Pulling the trigger when it?s all at stake
Here I am to dominate

Confined to this endless hate to realise
you were never truly alive
Never awaken from this dreams
Always tackled by the means because?

Textured vengeance is near! Mechanized by fear
Clawing on my thoughts again
Emerging horizon consuming my soul
No shackles and no control

Sealed up on unmarked grave
As we try to rupture the pattern of the wave
As the blaze ignites spiring in all it can be
From green to grey the leaves will turn and fall free

Spinning webs of timeless confusion
Whose clocks tick

Free! Yet held inside this place
Where my nightmares I come to face
Pulling the trigger when it?s all at stake
Here I am to dominate
