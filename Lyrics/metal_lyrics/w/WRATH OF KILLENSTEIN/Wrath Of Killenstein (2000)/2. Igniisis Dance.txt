In the part of hell where little dead kids go
I could see Igniisis dance through the deep black hole
Beating on the drum of the suicide clan
Bad kids jump in fire just as fast as they can
Time to burn
Sianara
Down we go now
Dance in the Flames
Dominus Sodimus
Flames burn higher
Gates of hell deliver diabolical fire
Feel the burn
Sianara
We're gonna jump down
Dance in the flames
