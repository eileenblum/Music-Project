Come to me on this night my, demon love
Deliver your gift, your sinful touch.
I am waiting for you, Whorella
My flesh is screaming for you.

I feel your tongue
I know you're here
In the dark I lie awake
Let down your wings
Please re-appear.

I only want it with you
Forever waiting for you, Whorella
My flesh is screaming for you

I crave you
Pray for you
Slay for you
Slave for you

Heal this aching, burning flesh,
My wicked one
On this sinful night I summon thee
Why won't you come?
I am waiting for you, Whorella
My flesh is screaming for you.

I crave you
Pray for you
Wait for you
I'll rape you

I crave you
Slay for you
Pray for you
I'll rape you
Wait for you
Play for you
I'll suck you
I hate you
