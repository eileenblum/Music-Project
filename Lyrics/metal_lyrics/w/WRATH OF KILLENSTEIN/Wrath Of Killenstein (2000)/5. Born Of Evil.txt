I was born of evil yes it's true
Bred by the demons these horns grew
Forged in fire raised in hell
I am the black one spreading doom

Four hundred years I searched in ruins
Queen for the kingdom that I rule
Taste my venom give your soul
I'd take a thousand lives for you
I'll make your darkest dreams come true

Night turns to black
Spread wings of evil
Undead attack - hide your neck

A castle I shall build for two
 From the bones of those that I once knew
Reign in fire play in blood
I am your best nightmare come true
I cast a wicked spell on you

Pray
Fear
Evil
Draws near.
