In solace and pain,
I've been trying to hold.
White light, shifting to grey.
In solace and pain.
I fade.
In hope and despair.
I fade.
Only prayers remain.
Hear me and see.
A shade, I long to be.
I fade.
Father, grant me my three nails.
Force fed faith/fate and wishes come through.
No stars will fall. No wars will end.
Father, grant me my three nails.
And nothing will change.
I fade.
