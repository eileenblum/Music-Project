Your hollow words mean nothing to me
They mean nothing to me

Your ignorance pushes me to my breaking point 
Selfish and senseless  
Portray and witness
The corrupt mind takes away the truth

Father, forgive them, they know not what they do
Father, forgive us, this is not the path to you

I refuse to be a slave any longer 
I will walk my own path
As I bow to no man  
I will not fall

There is a far better place than this
My justice is within the hands of my creator
Welcome to the new Roman empire
To rise and fall
To be forgotten and left in ruins

My God
My God will stand forever
His kingdom will reign
