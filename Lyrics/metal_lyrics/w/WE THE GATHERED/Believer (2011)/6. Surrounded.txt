I can finally feel your security
As it wraps around me
I can breathe freely now that I'm not drowning

The scars left from the past still haunts me till this day
But I must keep my head up

I will fight this war deep within my soul

The silence brings comfort to my weary heart (my weary heart)
I will fight this war within
I must fight this war within

The sacrifice that was made stopped my extinction

I keep searching for the strength

Look into this heart
Let loose these roots that bind me here
Make me the vagabond that I am meant to be

I'm Surrounded by your existence
As I gasp for air let loose these roots that bind me here
I'm surrounded by your existence
As I gasp for air, you are all I need
