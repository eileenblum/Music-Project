When everything seems to make sense
Your actions speak for themselves

The judegemnt you pass fall on deaf ears

Only God can judge our lives
Never back down
Never compromise

We all live by different means
No one is the same
Even if we don't see eye to eye
Things still have to change

With answers so clear
The war we fight
The ending is near
In our line of sight

Until then
I have had enough

I can't led this stand
This ends before it starts
You'll only lend a hand
To tear this world apart
