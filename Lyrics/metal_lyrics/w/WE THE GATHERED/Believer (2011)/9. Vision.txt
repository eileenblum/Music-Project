I cant see straight
Because my hands are shaking 
I don't know if I can go on like this

Where are you
When I need you the most

These sleepless nights are getting to me
The thoughts keep running on repeat
Is it worth it
Worth it

Can anyone see me
Can anyone hear my plea

Or am I a ghost

Walking a thin line between life and death

(between this life and the next)
I can not find this state of mind 
I was content
I was once content 
Nothing can fill this void
Nothing

Where can I find the peace
That I found before
