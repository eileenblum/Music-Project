I will never be like you
This reflection looks darkest, from one side

You are my antihero
you're consumed by what you have gained
you are my ANTIHERO
stray from all you have known

When i reached out for forgiveness, you turned away
I will never forget my captive
My captive, you turned away

Lines remain unspoken, yet they stay all the same
give to the weak after we have given ourselves

Lead me to my burial
I won't take park in our demise 

In the end, all will be just fine
the final judgement will lay on you
