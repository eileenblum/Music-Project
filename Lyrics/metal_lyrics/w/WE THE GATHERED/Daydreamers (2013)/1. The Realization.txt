The realization of what we have become is killing me.
Men have stood in the face of giants
Now hiding behind the shell of what they were.
Is this a dream or has this become our reality?

The walls around us begin to crumble.
What can we do?
What can we do?

What can I do to save the steps we've made?
What can I do to save us all?

I know we will, we will stand forever
I know we will, we will stand forever
We will stand forever
We will stand forever

But in the end is it all for nothing?
The ills of man will be tested.
We must rise above what we have become.

If we don't fight for ourselves no one will be there to save us.
If we don't fight for ourselves the progress we have made will be nothing.
Will be nothing.
