Summer bleeds its last shades of green 
To the darkened pool of dead emotions 
Pond of decayed dreams and withered love 
Why should I carry on, when all hope is gone? 

Come the autumn, come the rain 
Wash away all the bitterness and hate 

Fall - Come the autumn 
Fall - Come the rain 

Carve it to the firs, carve it to the oaks 
Scream it to the stars, shout it at the world 
Dwelling in self-pity, in self-caused pain 
All bridges burnt, the only way is down 

Come the autumn, come the rain 
Come the nightfall, welcome death 

Fall - Come the autumn 
Fall - Come the rain 

Fall - Come the end.
