Longing, yearning / wishful, dread 
Plaintive, mourning / woeful, weary 
Cruel be the wind that carries this tune, 
Song Clad in mourning veil. 
Deaf be the ears that it falls upon, 
Sorrow so overwhelming. 

Forever and forever more 
She'll haunt these moors 
Eternally and even beyond 
She'll dance in the early morning mists 

In autumn, in summer, in spring 
In winters chilling wind 
Over moors and beyond lakes 
It echoes ever mourning 

In autumn, in summer, in spring 
In winters chilling wind 
Over moors and beyond lakes 
The Sad song of the Woods 

Longing, yearning / wishful, dread 
Plaintive, mourning / woeful, weary 
Cold be the mind and cold be the soul, 
Cold as glacial waters in late autumn. 
Cold be heart that carries such wounds, 
She grieves, unsilent. 

Forever and forever more 
She'll haunt these moors 
Eternally and beyond 
She'll dance in the early morning mists 

In autumn, in summer, in spring 
In winters chilling wind 
Over moors and beyond lakes 
It echoes ever mourning 

In autumn, in summer, in spring 
In winters chilling wind 
Between the seasons it echoes 
The Sad song of the Woods.
