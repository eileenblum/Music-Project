The sun sets below the foam of the ocean 
And the shore is fast asleep 
I stood on the mountain and sang 
When my verses hit the water they were already dead 

I know where the sun sleeps at night 
Down in the lonely sea 
I know where the sun hides at night 
Up a tall spruce-tree 

The song vanished behind the pine-trees 
And the dusk cried it away 
Below the depths of the ever storming sea 
My song of something that will never return 

I know where the sun sleeps at night 
Down in the lonely sea 
I know where the sun hides at night 
Up a tall spruce-tree 

Struck by your words like stones 
The grief comes like winters cold, cutting breath 
I want to turn the sun and the moon from their paths 
And press the countless stars in my fist 

I shall curse this world 
Turn back the sun 
Turn back the moon 
I shall curse this world 
Turn back the day 
Turn back the night 
And when I have trampled it all underfoot 
Smiling I'll turn my back on life 

I know where I'll sleep tonight 
Down in the lonely sea 
And when the dawn has blown upon its fire 
I'll rest deep below the depressing sea.
