Enter my inmost night 
As Pestilence I'll arrive 
A plague upon your Christian beliefs 
Malignant disease with no redeem 
A wolf, feasting on the sheep's 
Black as pitch, cold as ice 
Traveller of darker paths 

Vargtimmen - 
Even darkness dims 
Welcome despair and pain 
Overwhelming grimness 

This is my hour! 

The moon lays hidden 
Behind the northern gale 
I am the unseen eyes of thunder 
The cold, freezing touch of winter's veil 
An icy breath of melancholy 
Upon your heart, upon your soul.
