Still Holding on to a memory (of a dream) 
Clung to a ghost of the past, 
I am entangled in a maze (of the self) 
With no way out 
...Alive 

Tired of the empty promises of a new brighter dawn 
Tired of all your fucking lies, that you keep preaching on 
Tired of all the hypocrisy, all the scorn, and double morality 
Only refuge is in a dream, but the dream always dies 

An image of a desolate meadow (it's a dream) 
All black, dead and barren, paints itself unto my cornea (it's for real) 
I know, I've seen it before 
...In a dream, maybe? 

The drugs don't work anymore, immune to all the pills 
Too afraid to sleep, too tired to live 

Can't sleep, the visions haunt me 
Should I close my eyes, would I dare?, dream, my last sanctuary 
Now twisted into a morbid nightmare 
...Without an end 

The fever's getting higher, burning inside me like fire 
The shadows are getting deeper, oh dawn, why won't you come? 

Tired of being alive, of thinking, of breathing 
So why not just end it? Right here, right now 
The sickness burns in my veins, working like a daze 
Yet I am too scared to end my days
