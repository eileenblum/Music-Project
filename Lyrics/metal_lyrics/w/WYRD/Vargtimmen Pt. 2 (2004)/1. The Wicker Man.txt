The rain pours down with pain, dampening the straws of hay 
Flowing down my face, mingling with tears 
Tears of despair and rage, years of emptiness and hate 
Soon swept away by the flames, mouldering ashes 
All that remain, is a pile of charred bones 
Raising dust for the wind to carry far away 
The rain pours down with pain, yet they sing and dance 
Floating in a trance like state, bewitched by the chanting 
Masked faces far below me, laughing mockingly 
The first torch is lit, soon followed by others 
This is it now, it will all end, on this solstice's night 

Flame, come take me, swallow me 
Oh great nothing, devour me 
Light it up, burn it down 
May the gods, accept our sacrifice 
Flesh to touch, flesh to burn 
Do not keep the wicker man waiting 
As flood I'll return, I am your sacrifice 
Your corpse will rot into the fields, you'll famish and starve 
As plague I'll return, going to destroy your world 
With fever you'll burn, and I'll save none
