In the woods not far from here, stands an age old dead tree 
On a meadow once green, nothing grows now 
They used to hang people from this oak, or so they legend claims 
Beneath the shadows of these branches, witches and heretics have burned 
The ground is dead and stained black with blood, 
the sorrow of centuries it bears 
No man, bird or beast dares to wander here 
Even during daylight hours darkness always seems to be near 
The soil is poisonous and swarming with snakes 
Oh, I tell you, it's a cursed place 
Here meet the pale and the dead, here the most coldhearted will dread 

The pale and the dead, ghosts from times long gone 
Relics of past dread, they walk beyond the sun 

When the night falls, the mist rises from the depths of the dead, cursed soil 
Damned, forgotten souls, centuries of old, 
wake from their cursed sleep of empty eternity 

The pale and the dead 
wretched souls that prey on living flesh 
The pale and the dead, 
souls unset, forever doomed to haunt 
The pale and the dead, 
beyond dawn and daylight the stalk
