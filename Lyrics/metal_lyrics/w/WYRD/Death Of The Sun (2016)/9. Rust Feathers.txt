down they came, sparrows and crows
down they came, with blackwings unknown

falling down like icy rain
sang to me of summers end

rust on black feathers
under the dying sun
rust on black feathers
bathing in the greyest light

down they came, dreams and hopes
swallowed by dark autumn dread

dreams once dreamed are all now dead
blown away by the freezing winds
