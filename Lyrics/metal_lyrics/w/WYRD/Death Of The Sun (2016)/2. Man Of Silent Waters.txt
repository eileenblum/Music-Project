i lie beneath the flame tonight
i bow before my death
beginning now meets end
and the water whispers my name

over bleak, darkening waters
and bottomless depths
towards the solemn shores
towards places unseen

from the grey came rowing
the man of silent waters
his boat glides across the lake
nothing stirs in his wake

over the unforgiving water
silent, black and calm
towards forgotten lands
towards the great unknown
