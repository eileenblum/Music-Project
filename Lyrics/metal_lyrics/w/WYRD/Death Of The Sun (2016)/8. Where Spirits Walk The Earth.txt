these woods have no pathways
where spirits walk the earth
with heavy steps that leave no footprints
by an old burial ground, a shimmering chant

from the depth of these mists
whispers from a black river
sense of movement in the still forest
the restless sleepers leave their eternal beds

trails unseen to mortal eyes
where spirits walk the earth
where the undead walk beyond the night
once great, great once more

words and songs of the swamps
long ago sunken again surface
runes and spells once carved
ablaze again on the now fallen trees

your pride is gone
singer of songs
yet in your tunes
still is your glory

carved in these woods
whispered to the winds
within each line
your everlasting story

your colours faded
soil for singers
in these meadows
and in these trees

reclaiming  past glory
in these woods
forever more
your wisdom lingers
