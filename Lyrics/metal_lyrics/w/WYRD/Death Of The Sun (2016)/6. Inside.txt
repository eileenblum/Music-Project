dreams fade in the daylight
but its always dark on the inside

I have lost my way â no devotion
I have gone too far â no devotion

on the inside
the light will disappear
one the inside
it was never here
on the inside
unredeemable sins

doomed to walk the night alone
some ghosts just refuse to die

runes once carved, still aflame
galders once sung, still echoing
path once chosen, coming to an end
no turning back, I am going all the way
