the haunts of men, beneath the dying sun
swarming with creatures, echoing with emptiness
build with sorrow and tears and human dust
lost in the ocean of nothingness

cursed be the men
and their haunts
cursed be the gods
above and below

the haunts of men, beneath the dying sun
places of worship, death, pain and suffering
build from the ashes of man and oak and pine
never ending circle, the vipers swallows its own tail
