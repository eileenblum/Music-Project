sleep brings no joy to me
the shadows of the dead
which my waking eye
may never see

my soul is given unto misery
the memories never die
my soul is given unto misery
and lives on in sighs

sleep brings no rest for me
in soundest of sleep they come
with their nightmarish imagery

my only wish is to forget
in endless sleep of death
yet my harrassed heart still beats
the sleepless and the dead

sleep brings no hope to me
the shadows come alive
they wait. Patiently.
They wait. Wait for me.

My only is wish is to forget
in endless sleep of death
yet my harrased heart still beats
the sleepless and the dead
