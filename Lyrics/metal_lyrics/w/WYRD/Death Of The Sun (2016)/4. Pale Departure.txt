through the wintry lamp light
fell sleek white snow
a lone gull, december pale
with wings cleaving the chilled air

above the mist clad harbour
where time stands still
she stares at the pitch black sea
lost in its grim beauty

like an angel of death
the white veil shadows her black soul
long beyond hope
the snow covers all memories

a pale departure of hope
these bleak days seem like years

radiant as a haunting spirit
in the frost white light
the gull swept past her and disappeared
into the deep black sky

a pale departure of hope
these bleak days seem like years
in the dark rivers of the heart
a pale departure of hope
