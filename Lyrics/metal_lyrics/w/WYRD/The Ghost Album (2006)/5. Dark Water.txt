Fall upon the dark waters
Floating down the coal-black currents
Through cataracts and rapids
To the tombs of Tuonela

How to bear the stings of serpents,
Tortures of the reed of waters,
How to bear the stings of serpents,
From the streams of Tuonela

To the blackest of all streams
To the waters of Tuoni
To the falls of the deathland
To the waters of Tuoni

Fall upon the waters
Floating down the coal-black current,
Through the cataracts and rapids
To the tombs of Tuonela.

How to bear the stings of serpents,
Tortures of the reed of waters,
How to bear the stings of serpents,
From the stream of Tuonela

From the death-stream a serpent,
From the water a dream
She is forever gone, forgotten
My torment is all that remains
