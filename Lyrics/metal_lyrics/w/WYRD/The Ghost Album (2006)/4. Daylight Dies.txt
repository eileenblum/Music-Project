When the winter nights grow longer
And the days have no returnings
When the long nights shimmer whitely
Over the icy wastes and woods
When the northern winds grow colder
And the days of man come to an end
When the stars flicker one last time
And then die

Losing tomorrow
Forgetting yesterday
Daylight dies
And life withers away

When my mind finally betrays me
And all my nightmares become reality
When They finally reach me
I'll be together with her again
Daughter of the forest
Together we'll sway and dance
On these unhallowed marchlands
For all eternity

Losing tomorrow
Forgetting yesterday
Daylight dies
And life withers away

Lose a life
Gain eternity
Daylight dies
And death devours me
