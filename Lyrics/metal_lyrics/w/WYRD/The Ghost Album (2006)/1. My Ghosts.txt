The doors are locked
And curtains drawn
But there is nowhere to hide
From the demons that dwell inside
Always fear the nightfall
Yet the dawn never brings solace
I throw another log into the fire
But can't seem to keep the cold outside

Where ever my path may lead
My ghosts will always follow me
Trapped in the darkness of my mind
Never more than two steps behind

The darkness is closing in
Shadows seem to dim
The flame flickers once and dies
The coldness creeps inside
Life will never be the same again
The old days will never return
So I'll just keep walking on
And never return

Where ever my path may lead
My ghosts will always follow me
Trapped in the darkness of my mind
Never more than two steps behind
