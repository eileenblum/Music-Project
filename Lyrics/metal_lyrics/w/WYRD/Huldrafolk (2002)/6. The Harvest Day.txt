Crush the faith of weakling followers,
burn down their filthy shrines
Desecrate and mock their petty values,
avenge the deeds of history

Never forget. Never forgive. I shall haunt you as long as you live
Never give up. Never give in. Stand your ground, strike down the enemy

700 years is not long enough, forever itself would not be long enough
Recognize the signs in the world? Smell the rage in the air?

You shall reap as you have sown.
And you have reaped nothing but misery.
