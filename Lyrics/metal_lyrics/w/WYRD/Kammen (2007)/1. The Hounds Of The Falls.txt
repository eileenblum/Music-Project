In the dying light of the demon moon
By the falls of the hounds
Their shadows dance in the eerie gloom
The damp night air is thick with their howls

Ageless voices carried with the winds
As darkness creeps upon the falls
Countless songs wailed into the night
Echoing in the dim moonlight

Bodies drowned, spirits alive
As ghosts they'll haunt these falls
Even the roar of these dark waters
Can't hide their nocturnal calls
