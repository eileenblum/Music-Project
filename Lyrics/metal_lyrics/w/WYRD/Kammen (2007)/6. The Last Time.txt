Watching the world pass me by
Nothing ever goes my way
Walk alone through this cold life
The never ending burden of time

Watching the world pass me by
No turning back
Dare I even ask for hope?
The never ending pain of life

Let me try, one last time
Just one more chance, to live my life
Give me hope, one last straw
Before death claims us all
