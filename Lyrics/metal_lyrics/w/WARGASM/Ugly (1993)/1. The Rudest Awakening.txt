"Tell me what you think I don't want to hear
I've got this masterplan for the next few years
Kill a little time maybe kill a few beers
Wash away my hopes along with my fears"

Dreams lies one and the same
Realize your big chance never came
Dream and lie find someone to blame
Real life you don't wanna play

Frozen as you feel the terror of the real
The jolt of the true is just too much for you

Rude awakening they can be very ugly things

Time will come for you to search your soul
Maybe you'll find out that you're not so bold
Life's too rough left you out in the cold
Try to get a grip fool try to grab a hold

Dreams lies one and the same
Realize your big chance never came
Dream and lie find someone to blame
Real life you don't wanna play

No this is not a drill no scheme to test your will
You don't get it do ya? Just stand there as they screw ya

Rude awakening they can be very ugly things (wake up)

Somebody screaming "someone help me"
Sounding echoes in the empty
No one answers no one's there none come running
No one cares
Addicted to your apathetic ways
Kept you at the bottom the bottom's where you'll stay
Suspended animation locked inside your head
Will it be any different when you are really dead?
Show me the future am I afraid?
Is this what I was given or what I've made?
I watch what I say
I watch what I feel
Yeah I'm alright but I'm no big deal
Head's on straight so I know what is real
Hard earned glory too easy to steal

Frozen as you feel the terror of the real
The jolt of the true is just too much for you

Rude awakening they can be very ugly things
