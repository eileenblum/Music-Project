Sweat dripping down from my face
Contemplating my relevance
Worthlessness disgrace
Realization has made me sad
My idiosyncrasies are yours
No reactions are of my own
I fight a battle inside myself
Tortured by the constant
Longing to be whole like you
My core is the mangled elf
How is it everybody else can have their own beliefs?
Why is it no one else suffers from this emptiness?
Tried to offer my own ideas
But the threat of disapproval had terrified me
No more my soul I will reveal

You don't know it but I see you
You don't know it but I know you
You don't know it but I sense your essence and suck it in
You don't know it but I am you

I've found that people need themselves
Mutual agreement comforts them
Without it they're in my cell
Perhaps in that way I help
I'm the catalyst that will allow your peace
But who helps me from this hell?

You don't know it but I see you
You don't know it but I know you

I don't want to disappear
At times it works out well
I gain a personality I desire
Briefly out of my hell
And as I venture away and towards another case
My automatic defense is strangling me
Color change takes place
I'm on a leash owned by who I'm with
Thrown around in circles
My emotions are changing fast
Confused I'm losing my grip

You don't know it but I see you
You don't know it but I know you
You don't know it but I sense your essence and suck it in
You don't know it but I am you

Chameleon
