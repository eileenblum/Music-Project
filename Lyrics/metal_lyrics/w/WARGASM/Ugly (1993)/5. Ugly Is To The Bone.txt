You file through my world throwing popcorn and beer
With hatred so blind that it's all I ever hear
Everyday hundreds are welcomed inside
To point at me laugh at me question my pride
But if I were to show up on your doorstep tonight
Would you open your door? Would you let me inside?

Enter and see nature's misery
Enter and feed sick curiosity
Come inside and behold as horrors unfold
Enter and see nature's misery
I've played in your game long enough
From the sorrowful day of my birth
But my god in heaven above says
"The freaks shall inherit the earth"

I'm the missing link between the real world and yours
The ugliness you hide from behind your locked doors
Seeing me makes you feel safe and secure
You go home and thank heaven it's not you or yours
I am labeled a monster though I am your brother
Look away from me there'll always be anotherï¿½

Enter and see nature's misery
Enter and feed sick curiosity
Come inside and behold as horrors unfold
Enter and see nature's misery
Was this all destiny's intent?
To live my tortured life in this tent?
It's a roll of the dice you see
That's separating you from me

One or more of me in your family tree
Look into the mirror for the enemy not me
Feel my pain
It's the words that we speak that make a man a freak
The attitude the ignorance the reasons that we seek
Feel my pain
