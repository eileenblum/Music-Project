Thought I left this all behind I was there again today
Seemed a thousand years ago and a million miles away
Suddenly I lost it all it was real I swear
Somewhere out there warfare

Now it feels like hell in my head
I'm a one man army

Always fighting with my mind I hold the past at bay
Secret wars in a private hell more and
more they come each day
Memory reality they've become one and the same
Somewhere out there warfare

Now it feels like hell in my head
I'm a one man army
I got hell in my hand
I'm a one man army

The war within me never felt so real
The war will win me too hard to conceal
All the horrors of warfare I just couldn't believe
Once you've lived there you will never leave
It's coming to me now it won't be long
It's gonna take me back where I belong
I see the enemy all around seems like they're everywhere
A panic builds inside my gut but my mission remains clear
Take them all out one by one 'til the last man falls
Somewhere out there warfare

Now it feels like hell in my head
I'm a one man army
I got hell in my hand
I'm a one man army
