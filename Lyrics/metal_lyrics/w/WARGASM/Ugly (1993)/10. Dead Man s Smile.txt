On parole out of the hole a free man once again
A law was passed you're out so fast laws were made to bend
Twisted brain feels no pain the system could not mend
Time to reap what others sow a predator you ascend

Criminal frustration building up inside
Rehabilitation a drop against the tide
Social deviation societal suicide your twisted mind
Locked away in a tomb for a while
Committing your crimes with a dead man's smile

My time is here barely a year a temporary stall
I was a slave I learned to behave In the end I fooled them all
People's fear that put me here those people seem so small
I am reborn forever sworn to make those people crawl

Criminal frustration building up inside
Rehabilitation a drop against the tide
Social deviation societal suicide your twisted mind
Locked away in a tomb for a while
Committing your crimes with a dead man's smile

Where's your mommy? Where's your daddy?
I won't hurt you have some candy
