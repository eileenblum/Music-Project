Tear down who I was before
Tear down feelings at the core
Sold me lies right before my eyes
I won't buy them anymore

You've taken my trust (the enemy)
Pounded it into dust (the enemy)
Now I've started to see (the enemy)
You look to me like the enemy

True or false are you friend or foe?
True or false I have to know
Thought I knew you saw through
Want to see your true colors show

(The enemy) You've taken my trust
(The enemy) Pounded it into dust
(The enemy) Now I've started to see
(The enemy) My enemy

They tell you "Know your enemy"
It took me much too long to see
You built the perfect gleaming lie that I deny

You swim uncharted waters in shark infested seas
The next thing you know your legs end at the knees
You're lying down with dogs

You're waking up with fleas

You couldn't wouldn't see

The forest for the trees liar
Now that I feel I've found all that I fear
I need one more simple truth to appear
Did I willingly forbid myself to see
Hearing what I wanted what I needed to hear

(The enemy) You've taken my trust
(The enemy) Pounded it into dust
(The enemy) Now I've started to see
(The enemy) My enemy
