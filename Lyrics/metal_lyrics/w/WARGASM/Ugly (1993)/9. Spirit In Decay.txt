Thrown into this room so long ago
Seems I've lost track of the time
Exactly where I am I do not know
This is their homeland not mine

Thrown down your hands bound make not a sound

Food and water scarce if anything
Little English spoken here
It's hard to remember anything
Before this constant state of fear
It's too late accept your fate deteriorate
They manipulate the truth I'm a lost forgotten soul
They say I'll end my life here in this hole
They're pushing these ideas into my head
But I don't hear a thing I know I'm already

Agents of the free turn your back to me
Freedom I await the day
In my heart I hold a hope that tears my soul
Spirit in decay
It's getting harder every night
To summon up the will to fight

To those of us who chose to forget them:
How can we constantly refuse to go get them?
I don't believe a filthy stinking word they've said to me
I don't believe my family thinks this is the end of me
I don't believe my country won't attempt to rescue me
I don't believe a word no

Agents of the free turn your back to me
Freedom I await the day
In my heart I hold a hope that tears my soul
Spirit in decay

Those at home no doubt sleep well
Worlds away from this living hell
