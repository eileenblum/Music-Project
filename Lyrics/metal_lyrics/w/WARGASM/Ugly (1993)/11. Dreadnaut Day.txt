No emotion here vague sensation: Fear
One thought loud and clear: No one gets near
See the cold stare but look past
Peel away the false face mask
Ironclad the die has been cast

Ran away until today the man who was is gone

Human flesh safe warm weather every storm
Watch this man transform watch his face deform
Pounded into shape altered inner landscape
Twisted head mind rape

Now you see machinery is all there is to me
Is all that's left of me
Today is dreadnaut day I can see the only way
Is dreadnaut day chew you up spit you out
Now get the hell out of my way
You've given up control of your fate
Now you are what you hate  Step aside

Gone spark will to be all humanity
Destined now to be a one way machine
Self destruction mode deliver payload
Time bomb snap explode

Now you see machinery is all there is to me
Is all that's left of me
Today is dreadnaut day I can see the only way
Is dreadnaut day chew you up spit you out

Now get the hell out of my way
