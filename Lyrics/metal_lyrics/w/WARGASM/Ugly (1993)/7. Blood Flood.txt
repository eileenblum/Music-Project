Dripping onto their tongues flowing into their lungs
Quenching soulless bloodthirst up and down their throats
Growing fat and bloating filled up to exploding
Throwing up your fluid drinking up again
Suffering is so slow watching our own blood flow
Hearts are pumping fluid from the very core
Leave us hanging as we pour ourselves out unto the floor
Need to suck heart and soul have none of their own

And the blood flow begins in the blood in the flood
And we can never be drained in the blood in the flood

Rows of dripping cattle hang ripe and ready for the fang
Filed and defiled re-filed numbered without name
Feeding on the innocent pure of heart of intent
Years drain out of us like water from a tap

And the blood flow begins in the blood in the flood
And we can never be drained in the blood in the flood

Dreaming of an open vein giving them what they crave
Spraying crimson on the walls walls forever stained
We will bleed forever a tidal wave unleashed
Washing them away drowning in their greed
Our blood is sour but revenge is sweet
Maybe the blood that they drown in be their own

Droplets raining in the roads pools overflowing blood
To rivers grow rivers oceans of blood
Blood
