Footsteps behind you a killer at large murder for sale on the streets
With weapon in hand the manhunt begins no rest til the job is complete
No right and no wrong only dead or alive a target a prize to be won
If the money's enough then there's no place to hide just one more notch in a gun

Bullets and blades the tools of your trade
The weapons of death surround you
Your reason your rhyme your partners in crime
Your hands are still stained with their life
All it takes is a twist of your knife

For women and children you hold no remorse your price is the same for them all
No guilt no fear no time for a thought no name just a face no one saw
The last one was easy a woman of worth no charge for a lover's revenge
A slug in the skull and its over for her but for you there is never an end

The body was found in one week's time her legs in an alley downtown
Head with a bullethole still in the side in a cardboard coffin was found
