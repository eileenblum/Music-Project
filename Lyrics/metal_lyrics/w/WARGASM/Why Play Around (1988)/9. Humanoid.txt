Semi-human semi steel cannot speak cannot feel
Twisted mess a tortured soul
Mutant brain a does not lie recording fear in your eyes
Future shock from the past

It's coming for you it's waiting for you
It's hiding on you don't want to know what for
To penetrate you a seed inside you
To produce through you ten thousand more
Breathing poison dripping slime abomination living crime
Reeking evil glowing eyes
Tracking blood scent of man prehistoric neuro-scan
Inbred weapons he relies

Feeling strange deep within, can't remember where you've been
Bruised and bleeding sore inside
Feel your body's about to burst ravaged by a deadly thirst
Breaking out in sickening sores

Wargasm are:
Rich Spillberg - guitar
Bob Mayo - bass &amp; vocals
Barry Spillberg - drums
