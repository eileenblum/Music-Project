He's on a rampage he's on the run more hell bent than you've ever seen
Tryin' to hell him that he's got no right is like putting out fire with gasoline
Crystal clear in his own warped mind hears voices screaming in his ear
Explosion in a nest of nerves satisfaction lurking ever near

Til he wound up knee deep in blood

The wound up spring inside his skull snapped and left him numb
He's at the end of sanity's rope the time to collect has come
He feels the need to right a wrong revenge is what he hungers for
His choice of weapons his own bare hands he's out for blood to even the score

Eye for eye tooth for tooth do or die seek the truth 
Conscience clear your wires crossed won the war but the battle's lost

He's plotting his crime with stealth and care his mind is humming and
Spinning 'round
He won't fail he was driven insane his enemy deserves underground
A crime of passion turned to pain pushed him over the edge
His eyes show him only one thing flashing blades exploding lead

Eye for eye tooth for tooth do or die seek the truth 
Conscience clear your wires crossed won the war but the battle's lost
Fulfilling his goal his vision clears the scream in his head subsides
One thing left to complete the tale to take one more life he decides
A suicide of stealth and care his mind in humming and spinning 'round
He won't fail he was driven insane his enemy deserves the underground

Eye for eye tooth for tooth do or die seek the truth 
Conscience clear your wires crossed won the war but the battle's lost
