Without warning without name tearing thru the ground they came
No tomb will hold them coffins crack earth is spewing bodies back
Cemeteries once were filled ancient curse is now fulfilled
One thousand years of tortured screams

Corpses fill the city streets the walking dead their sleep has ceased
Claiming souls the undead march they're marching on with undead hearts
Human targets living flesh tied and chained they die best
The dead they don't stay down for long

Tonight man's fate is sealed tonight the end is revealed
Invincible they will prevail immortal armies will not fail
Weapons will do no good they don't die like they should
Invincible they will prevail immortal armies will not fail

As darkness falls across the world the undead disease cannot be cured
Building armies burning down seizing cities all around
Smoke and dust and bodies rise victims taken by surprise
The living must be made undead

All hope is gone no chance to win we're now undead we're giving in
Memories of life before waking dreams an all out war
Death is not the living end to die is to being again
We will not stop we know no pain
