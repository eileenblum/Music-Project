Holding on to anger
Holding on to hate
A lifetime of misery my fate

Now I have been at war for ages
The war drags ever on
Deep inside the battle rages
On and on and on

Negative obsession
No, it never dies
Let the flag of hate forever fly

And when I plant the seeds of hatred
They grow up strong and proud
You can almost hear them screaming
Scream out loud

Blood is boiling over
Eats me up inside
I won't let it overcome my pride

Now I have been at war for ages
The war drags ever on
Deep inside the battle rages
On and on and on

I didn't ask for your apology
It don't mean a goddamned thing to me
I won't forget just what you did to me
Not forgiven, not forgotten
I can't forgive I just can't let it be
Not forgiven, not forgotten
Oh how I love to hate

Now about my attitude
I don't know what to say
Just can't seem to make it go away

And when I plant the seeds of hatred
They grow up strong and proud
You can almost hear them screaming
Scream out loud

I didn't ask for your apology
It don't mean a goddamned thing to me
I won't forget just what you did to me
Not forgiven, not forgotten
I can't forgive I just can't let it be
Not forgiven, not forgotten
Oh how I love to hate
