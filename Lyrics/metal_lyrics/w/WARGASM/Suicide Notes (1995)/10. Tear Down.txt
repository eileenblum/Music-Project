I say this world is slowly winding down
I say we burn it all
Right down to the ground
Deconstruct, it's time
Reconstruct in time
I see this road is finally reaching the end
I see tearing it down and starting again

Through years of growing like a cancer
And clinging like a curse
We finally found the answer
And it couldn't be much worse
We're on a downward spiral
We'll ride it to the ground
It's time to go
It's time to start the tear down

I know it's time to learn how to disappear
I know that we were never meant to be here

Through years of growing like a cancer
And clinging like a curse
We finally found the answer
And it couldn't be much worse
We're on a downward spiral
We'll ride it to the ground
It's time to go
It's time to start the tear down

Chaos would do this tired old world some good
Eons she'll rebuild without us like she should

Through years of growing like a cancer
And clinging like a curse
We finally found the answer
And it couldn't be much worse
We're on a downward spiral
We'll ride it to the ground
It's time to go
It's time to start the tear down
