These are the final days
You laugh look around get that smile right off your face
There now you need to see more proof
Look past your everyday begin to see the truth

So here we are
How did it get this far?
I know it all too well
This may not be hell

See the world has run aground
But the rats all stay aboard
As the ship goes down
Now we've got what we deserve
Life sentence ruined world our destiny to serve

So here we are
How did it get this far?
I know it all too well
This may not be hell

Hell yeah, I had a waking dream
I lived it over and over and over
Hell yeah, been shaken from my sleep
And now it's over, it's over, it's over
