Now I got his feeling
I'm the only one's who's real
I can't imagine how you feel
The way the world has taught me
Shoot your way to the end
'Til there's no one left to defend
This mean's you my friend

Turn to run, grab the gun
Don't let life get in your way
Take a breath, kiss of death
Aim the gun and fire away

In my hand the answer
To anything in my way
There's really nothing left to say
As I pat your back on the target
Tell you useful lies
As I look you right in the eye
Ready, aim, bulls eye

Turn to run, grab the gun
Don't let life get in your way
Take a breath, kiss of death
Aim the gun and fire away
