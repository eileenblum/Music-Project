On a mission many a year
Single minded nothing to fear
I'd like to make one thing so clear
You don't want to get caught between the gears

This engine never dies
Overloaded this thing nearly flies
All those stories you thought they were lies
Overlook it and you're in for a big surprise

I feel the anger, feed the reaction
I feel the anger, feeding my engine
I know just what to do
I'll aim my engine right at you

It's my machine and it runs on pain
You don't drive it, it drives you insane
Don't really know what I hope to gain
Tears me apart and it puts me back together again

Living dream, where I've been
My machine, it's a trip like you've never seen

I feel the anger, feed the reaction
I feel the anger, feeding my engine
I know just what to do
I'll aim my engine right at you
