If I told you what's inside of your mind
Would you face it or tell me that I'm being unkind
Can you see just how your instincts are ruling your head
Do you know that if you follow them you're soon to end up dead
There is more to us than I'll kill you before you can kill me
It's there in each of us
I know it's here inside of me

I know fear way down deep
I smell fear, fresh meat
I'm not like you
I use what's in my head
I think
I know which side comes out ahead
I think

Anger bringing you down like an animal
Crawling around on the ground
I see you hanging there another helpless piece of meat
Unthinking empty head for all the other animals to eat
They smell your fear rabid dogs nipping at your feet
They will tear you down
Your brainless head will taste so sweet

I know fear way down deep
I smell fear, fresh meat
I'm not like you
I use what's in my head
I think
I know which side comes out ahead
I think

In your mind you draw that line
Are you gonna shine or will you flatline
Which side, you decide

Is it a gift, a curse, or is it something worse
A weapon, a tool, you a hero or a fool

I know fear way down deep
I smell fear, fresh meat
I'm not like you
I use what's in my head
I think
I know which side comes out ahead
I think
