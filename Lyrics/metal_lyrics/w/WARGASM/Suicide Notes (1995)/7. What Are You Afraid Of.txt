Why do you stray from the shadows?
Why do you hide from the unknown?
You might find yourself in there
What is it that you're afraid of?
Or is it that you're ashamed of?
Something buried long ago
You don't know where

Is it who you are or what you were?
Is it your past or your future?
Is it who you've become today?
Who do you see in the mirror?
Think on it hard
It's getting clearer
Now it's caught you
Can't run away

Spirits haunt you
Excorsize
Can't even see through your own lies

What is your horror made of?
What is it you're afraid of?
Are you too paralyzed to see
That there's another way to be?
What's your nightmare?

Face yourself, eye to eye
Face your fear, fear will die

Spirits haunt you
Excorsize
Can't even see through your own lies

What is your horror made of?
What is it you're afraid of?
Are you too paralyzed to see
That there's another way to be?
What's your nightmare?
