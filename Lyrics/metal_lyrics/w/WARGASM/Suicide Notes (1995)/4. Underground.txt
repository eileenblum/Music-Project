I know you don't like what you see
Who do you want me to be?
I don't wanna know, I don't really care
I could've been more like you
But that was the wrong thing to do
I'm living a life that you wouldn't dare
I could take you there

Think you know me my friend
Guess again
Think you know where I am
Guess again
Don't follow me down underground

Turned my back on all I knew
I walked away from all that wasn't true
Everything I left behind
I moved ahead to see what I might find
You don't like my find

Think you know me my friend
Guess again
Think you know where I am
Guess again
Don't follow me down underground
