This is our night, we are the anarchy.
Burn it down, burn it down, we are the living nightmare.
(This is our fight!)
We need no kings and queens, turn it down, turn it down.
Show them we own the streets!

Let's go out, break it down!
Let's go out, break it down!
(Show them we own the streets!)

What is the reason, why you feed them?
I start to believe that you don't want your freedom.
What is the reason, why you feed them, why do you feed them?

Make up your mind!

The enemy is blind!
This is hypocrisy, can you taste the fear of their impassivity?
Lies over lives, enough is enough!
We will not give up until the tyrants are gone!

Burn it down, burn it down, burn it to the ground!
Show them we own the streets!

What is the reason, why you feed them?
I start to believe that you don't want your freedom.
What is the reason, why you feed them, why do you feed them?

Make up your mind!
Make up your mind!

What is the reason, why you feed them, why do you feed them?

The enemy is blind!
This is hypocrisy, can you taste the fear of their impassivity?
We will never rest until the tyrants are gone!

Break it down and fight for your life!

What is the reason, why you feed them?
I start to believe that you don't want your freedom.
What is the reason, why you feed them, why do you feed them?
What is the reason, why you feed them?
I start to believe that you don't want your freedom.
What is the reason, why you feed them, why do you feed them?
