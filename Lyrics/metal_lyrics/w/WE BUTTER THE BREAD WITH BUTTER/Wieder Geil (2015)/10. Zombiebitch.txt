There is no blood in my veins
I cannot feel any pain
I am dead full of scars
I canÂ´t drive any cars
IÂ´m a zombie in a world
Where all brains are gone
So iÂ´m hungry, want to eat you all and not just one
Zombiebitch zombiebitch
Walking around
YouÂ´re acting like a moviestar
You get what you want
"iÂ´m a little pretty princess
If i want it - i can have it"
YouÂ´re stupid like thereÂ´s no tomorrow
Super silly zombiebitch
YouÂ´re a maneater
CominÂ´ straight outta hell
Red lips meant to be kissed
But please kiss yourself
Rotten bones, dead eyes
As cold as your lies
Nobody needs you
Dead or alive
YouÂ´re groaning for fame
YouÂ´re a shame
ItÂ´s insane
I spit on your grave
Super silly zombiebitch
Zombiebitch zombiebitch
Super silly zombiebitch
