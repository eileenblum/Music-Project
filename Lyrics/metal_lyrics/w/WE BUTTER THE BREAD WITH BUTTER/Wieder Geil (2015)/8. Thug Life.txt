Get up, get up
And listen to your heart yeah
DonÂ´t lose yourself and donÂ´t give a fuck
Shut up, shut up
YouÂ´re talking like a fool
So what ya gonna do when your lifeÂ´s a fucking mess
This insane nation
Save yourself, break the shell
Escape from hell
All these temptations
If youÂ´re gonna let them go we will rise tonight
Stand up, stand up
DonÂ´t fool yourself
Be who you really are
Get up, get up
Open your eyes and fight
All the lies
All the faces around me
Follow me, so youÂ´ll see the fight
All the lies
Falling to the ground
Get up, get up
ItÂ´s time to break the walls down
Show what you are made of
Throw your mask away
Stand up, stand up
LetÂ´s raise our fists and fight
