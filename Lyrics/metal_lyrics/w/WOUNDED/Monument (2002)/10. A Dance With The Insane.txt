It was night in my head and they were coming.
To reming me of the sin that I am.
I was glad and my head felt funny.
I was glad cause you died  in my heart.
Al the things that I sad and I did and I felt.
It was all because of you.
It doesnï¿½t surprise me that you donï¿½t understand me.
But donï¿½t laugh about me cause Iï¿½m sane and Iï¿½m here.
My vicious mind is melting.
Cause I canï¿½t swallow this terrible hate.
Cause I see you laugh about me.
Donï¿½t you fucking laugh about me.
Be the one, be the hate that I wear.
And remind me of it every day.
Cause I will swallow this destructive knowledge.
Iï¿½m your trust, Iï¿½m your life, Iï¿½m your god.

Itï¿½s the pain that I donï¿½t want anymore.
Itï¿½s in every second I live
And I feel so black inside.
Cause Iï¿½m glad that someone died.
(Cause I am glad that you fucking died)
