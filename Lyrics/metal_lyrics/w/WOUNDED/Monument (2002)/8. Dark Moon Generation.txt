Hate in unknown eyes,
Executing my trust.
Your humiliating words suffocate me,
Remove me and kill me.
Dark wars enslave us.
Nothing peaceful for us no more.
As we stand here, like always.
All alone.

Spirits stop tell these lies,
Give us our wars.
Donï¿½t leave us herewith nothing, useless.
We lift our hands up for something peaceful.
So donï¿½t leave us here.

Lent to me your heart.
Met me bare your pain.
Iï¿½m your saviour today, trust me.
Now insecurity takes over.
Without a word of hope they have left us here.
Fallen... dying.
