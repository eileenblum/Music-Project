Its not a dream, from witch I fell.
But I know Iï¿½m here.
I know why Iï¿½m here.
Not a dream, Liberty.
I have one soul, or maybe more.

A million thoughts,
Are flashing through my mind.
And the energy is killing me.
I cannot breathe.
And thereï¿½s nothing to hold on to,
But you wonï¿½t have to.
To where we fly,
To the end of reality.

Here I am,
Here with you all.
I know we all died,
But I can feel your warmth.
Now take my hands and see,
All the things you should have seen.
To forgive the bitter sins,
With all these bitter tears.
Not far away from me,
Closer and closer it gets.
The pain you feel, Is the pain you wear...

No more we shall cry,
In the lap of our own disguise.
Who will perish from this earth.
But never from our hearts.
For only they have won,
Who are named on this monument of peace.

ï¿½What I want I have,
Heaven
I am heaven as you are mine.
I am god as you are mine,
You are my god,
I am yours...ï¿½
