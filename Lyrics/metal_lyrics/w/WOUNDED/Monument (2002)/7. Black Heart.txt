I feel standing, remarkable.
Blessed again, itï¿½s to late.
A dark incision, Iï¿½m flammable.
The darkest years,
Scattered dreams.

The night sheï¿½s calling.
Freezing.
The thing we started will get us back.
Watch the moon falling.
It will draw me a name.
A face of black hate.

Black star, let them bleed.
Shivering flames.
Black heart, sacred fiction.
Shrivelling my flames with rain.

To see the point and look whatï¿½s falling.
Stumbling expecting, I look strange.
Remedy, luxury, tragedy,
Made me free.

I seek your eyes, to excuse you in dreams to come.
Fail to me, and become undone
