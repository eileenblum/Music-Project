[feat. Xzibit]It burns into your heart, the darkness that you fear.
You were never free, and you never realized.
And love is a word you've never heard.
Your heart ain't cold 'cause it burns,
A desire to leave the mire.

Take your breath 'til nothing's left.
Scars of life upon your chest.
And I know wherever it goes

And we run, with a lonely heart
And we run, for this killing love
And we run, 'till the heavens above
Yeah we run, running in the dark
And we run, 'till we fall apart
And we run, 'till the heavens above

Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Lift up your head.
We gotta get gone.
Yeah, we outta here.
Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Lift up your head.
Too late, we gone.
Yeah, we outta here.

And we run, with a lonely heart
And we run, for this killing love
And we long for a heavenly heart

I'ma break these chains, ran through the rain.
Never look back, never quit work through the pain.
This blood in my veins run cold
When I think it'll never be the same
But I never lose hope.
This is my time now, no time for tears, to celebrate.
Put it in the air right now.
Never back down,
You can never wear my crown
'cause it weighs too much
And I crush every motherfucking thing I touch.
This is love I've never loved so much.
Get involved make the world stand up.
Give my life before I ever give up
"Name in lights", you lost all my trust.
Now it's time to face all of us.
Get in line cause they're callin' us
And it feels so marvelous
Just take my hand and run.

And we run, with a lonely heart
And we run, for this killing love
And we run, 'till the heavens above
Yeah we run, running in the dark
And we run, 'till we fall apart
And we run, 'till the heavens above

Yeah, we out of here.

Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Lift up your head.
We gotta get gone.
Yeah, we outta here.
Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Lift up your head.
Too late, we gone.
Yeah, we outta here.

And we run, with a lonely heart
And we run, for this killing love
And we long for a heavenly heart

Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Lift up your head.
We gotta get gone.
Yeah, we outta here.
Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Lift up your head.
Too late, we gone.
Yeah, we outta here.
