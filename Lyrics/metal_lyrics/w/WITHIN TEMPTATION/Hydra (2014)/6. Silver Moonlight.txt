Turn around, open your eyes
Can't move on, the fear is tying you down
Open your eyes
It's alright...

I'm hell bound in this life
Keep fighting this endless war
It's always been like this I don't know why
Enslavement of your mind
Your fear, it ties me down
Going down, I won't bow, no!

Screaming at the walls of fire
They're closing in on me (closing in on me)
I hunger for the vertigo, the silver moonlight
It's where I wanna be (it's where I wanna be)
Screaming at the walls of fire
But I'm still running free (I'm still running free)
In the silver moonlight I can breathe

Wooooo
(I can breathe)
Wooooo

These days are only now
Breathing in the coldest lies
I think that's only what you have in mind
Holding on to the best of you
I hit the pavement
Going down, I won't bow, don't!

Screaming at the walls of fire
They're closing in on me (closing in on me)
I hunger for the vertigo, the silver moonlight
It's where I wanna be
Screaming at the walls of fire
But I'm still running free (I'm still running free)
In the silver moonlight I can breathe

I'm impatient
But it's colors that I need
Too many shades of gray
I cannot breath (I can't breathe)
The dreams I have ain't tainted
I need you to believe
The only way to make them real
Oh

(I can breathe)

Screaming at the walls of fire
They're closing in on me (closing in on me)
I hunger for the vertigo, the silver moonlight
It's where I wanna be
Screaming at the walls of fire
But I'm still running free (I'm still running free)
In the silver moonlight I can breathe

Wooooo
(I can breathe)
Wooooo

Turn around, open your eyes
Can't move on, the fear is tying you down
Open your eyes
It's alright...
