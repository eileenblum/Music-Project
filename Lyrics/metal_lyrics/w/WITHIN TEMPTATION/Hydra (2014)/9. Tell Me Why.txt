I've been losing myself in anger
So much broken by the rage
Nothing could take my mind off
How to make them pay
Killing myself for nothing
And the pain won't go away
Losing myself to madness
And the game's been played

If I could turn the hands of time
I would but here I am

Tell me why am I still here when itâs all gone
Iâm living with the ghost of yesterday
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on
Iâve got to tear it down to let it go
Iâm too tired to keep on trying
But Iâm spellbound âtil the end
Knowing that thereâs no closure
For my wars inside
Iâve buried the good and evil
Only memories left behind
I am the one still standing
I will live to tell

If I could turn the hands of time
I would but here I am
(Here I am!)

Tell me why am I still here when itâs all gone
Iâm living with the ghost of yesterday
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on
Iâve got to tear it down to let it go

Tell me why Iâm wasting away,
Tell me how to break my own chains,
âCause Iâm losing after all,
How can I escape this grim fate
Tell me how to face one more day,
âCause Iâm wasting away

[Guitar solo]

Itâs all gone silent
I'm searching for fire
Nothing to fight for alone

Tell me why am I still here when itâs all gone
Iâm living with the ghost of yesterday
Tell me why am I still here when itâs all gone
Iâm living with the ghost of yesterday
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on
Iâve got to tear it down to let it go
