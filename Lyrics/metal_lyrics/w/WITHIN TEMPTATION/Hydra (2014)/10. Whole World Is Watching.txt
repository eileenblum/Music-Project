[feat. Dave Pirner]You live your life. You go day by day like nothing can go wrong.
The scars are made, they're changing the game. You learn to play it hard.

And I know you wish for more, and I know you try.
And now you realize, you know the time is right.

The whole world is watching when you rise.
The whole world is beating for you right now.
Your whole life is flashing 'fore your eyes.
It's all in this moment that changes all.

What are you waiting for?
What are you fighting for?
'Cause time's always slipping away.
The whole world is watching.
The whole world is watching you when you rise.

You build your walls then break them away 'cause that is what it takes.
You saved yourself. You found who you are. That never goes away.

And I know you wish for more, and I know you try.
And now you realize, you know the time is right.

The whole world is watching when you rise.
The whole world is beating for you right now.
Your whole life is flashing 'fore your eyes.
It's all in this moment that changes all.

What are you waiting for?
What are you fighting for?
'Cause time's always slipping away.
The whole world is watching.
Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise.

Your sacrifice comes through your mind, but nothing is wasted. You made it now.
You rise again, breaking out. Each step you've taken, you've paid the price

The whole world is watching.

The whole world is watching.
Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise.

What are you waiting for?
What are you fighting for?
'Cause time's always slipping away.
The whole world is watching.
Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise.
