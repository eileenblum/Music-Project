It waits for the day, I will let it out
To give it a reason, to give it its might

[Pre-chorus:]
I fear who I am becoming,
I feel that I am losing the struggle within
I can no longer restrain it,
My strength, it is fading
I have to give in

[Chorus:]
It's the fear,
The fear of the dark
It's growing inside of me
They won, they will come to life
Have to save,
Save my beloved,
There is no escaping
Because my fate is horror and doom

Hold down your head now,
Just let me pass by
Don't feed my fear,
If you don't want it out

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

Long ago, it came to me and ever since that day,
Infected with it's rage
But it ends today

[Chorus]
