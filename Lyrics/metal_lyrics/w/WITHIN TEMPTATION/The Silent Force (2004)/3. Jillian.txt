I've been dreaming for so long,
To find a meaning
To understand.
The secret of life,
Why am I here
To try again?

Will I always,
Will you always
See the truth
When it stares you in the face?
Will I ever
Will I never free myself
By breaking these chains?

[Chorus:]
I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul.
I'd turn it back, it's my fault.
Your destiny is forlorn,
Have to live till it's undone.
I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul.
I'd turn it back
And then at last
I'll be on my way.

I've been living for so long,
Many seasons have passed me by.
I've seen kingdoms through ages
Rise and fall,
I've seen it all.

I've seen the horror,
I've seen the wonders
Happening just in front of my eyes.
Will I ever
Will I never free myself by making it right?

[Chorus]

Jillian
Our dream ended long ago.
All our stories
And all our glory
I held so dear.
We won't be together for ever and ever,
No more tears.
I'll always be here
Until the end...

[Voices]
(Jillian, no more tears...
Jillian, no more tears...)

[Chorus]
