I hear your whispers
Break the silence
And it calms me down
Your taste on my lips
Your salty kisses

They say I'm seeking up the danger
That one day you won't let me go
(I'll drown, you'll take me down)

[Chorus:]
I need you Aquarius
Enchanted I will have to stay.
I feel you Aquarius
'cause you're the sea, set me free
You call to me Aquarius
(You call to me, you set me free)

I relinquish
To your powers
From your grasp
I just can't hide

I missed the danger
I had to conquer
You made me feel alive

They say I have to be aware
That one day you won't let me go
Take me down

[Chorus]

I long for you Aquarius
I need to be with you again
I fear you, Aquarius
My destiny 'till the end

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
