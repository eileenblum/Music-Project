Now the day has come
We are forsaken this time

We lived our lives
In our paradise
As Gods we shaped the world around
No borderlines
We stayed behind
Though balance is something fragile

Well we thought we were gaining
We turned back the time
It still slips away
Our time has run out
Our future has died
There's no more escape

[Chorus:]
Now the day has come
We are forsaken
There's no time any more
Life will pass us by
We are forsaken
We're the last of our kind

The sacrifice
Was much to hide
Our greed just made us all go on
We try to hide what we fear inside
Today is the end of tomorrow

As the sea started rise
And the land that we conquered
It just washed away
We all have tried
To turn back the time
It was all in vain

[Chorus:]
Now the day has come
We are forsaken
There's no time any more
Life will pass us by
We are forsaken
Only ruins stay behind

(Een hoop gebrabbel)

Now the day has come
We are forsaken this time

Now the day has come
We are forsaken
There's no time any more

Now the day has come,
The day has come
