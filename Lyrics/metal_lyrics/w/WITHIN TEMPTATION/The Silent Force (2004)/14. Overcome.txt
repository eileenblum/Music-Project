[Bonus track]

Where are the heroes
I my time of need
Is my crying abandoned?
Or have they gone
Oh no

They just tend to stand
Out of the rain
Thinking but not acting
That they're not to blame

Falling and crawling
A fight to stand up
Memory still haunts me
In the dead of night

Over and over
I felt so small
But one day I'll be stronger
And you better watch out

[Chorus:]
I will overcome
In violence there's silence
Oh no,
It can't be undone
I will overcome
Knowing that I'm not the only one
I will overcome
It's the only way to carry on

Where are the saviours
Afraid of the toll
Sorry do my nine inch nails
Slash your soul?

Such heroes
Throwing stones
Straight at the one
Who is standing alone?

Twisting and turning
It's always the same
The truth is never honest
When you're to blame

Pushing and pulling
Never give in
One day I wish
You see you're not so beautiful within

[Chorus]

Run and run
Run and run

[Chorus]

I will overcome
