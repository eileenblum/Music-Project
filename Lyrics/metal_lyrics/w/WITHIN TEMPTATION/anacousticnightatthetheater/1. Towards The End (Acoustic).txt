he turn against
The world we know
Now our destiny
Will be decided
We have to send our brothers in arms
With pain in our heart
We watched them go
Will they return?
Truth is we had no choice
We'll try to shield those we can
No better world
Let this end
Mothers cry
Our boys die
But we'll stand 'til the end
