Waking in the dead of night
Hold onto this life
Running to what's wrong or right
Seems to be a thin line
Fighting for a wasted love
Fighting to survive
Oh won't you please forget
Won't you please forget

These are the dog days
These are the dog days
They'll never go away [x2]

1, 2, 3, 4
What are you waiting for? [x2]

These are the dog days
These are the dog days

Waking in the dead of night
Hold onto this life
Running to what's wrong or right
Seems to be a thin line
Fighting for a wasted love
Fighting to survive
Oh won't you please forget
Won't you please forget

These are the dog days
These are the dog days
They'll never go away [x2]

1, 2, 3, 4
What are you waiting for? [x2]

These are the dog days
These are the dog days

Embracing the heart
To find the loss
Running down a path that
I think i need to know
When you've think you've won
You're still losing after all

These are the dog days
These are the dog days
They'll never go away [x2]

1, 2, 3, 4
What are you waiting for? [x2]

These are the dog days
These are the dog days
