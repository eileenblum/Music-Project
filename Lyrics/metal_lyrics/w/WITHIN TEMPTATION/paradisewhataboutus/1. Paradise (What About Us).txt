[feat. Tarja]Thereâs no sense, the fire burns
When wisdom fails it changes all
The wheel embodies all that keeps on turning

Blood red skies, I feel so cold
No innocence, we play our role
The wheel embodies all where are we going

All in all youâd expect the wise to be wiser
Fallen from grace
All and all I guess
We should have known better, âcauseâ¦

What about us?
Isnât it enough,
No weâre not in paradise

This is who we are
This is what we've got
No, it's not our paradise

But itâs all we want,
And it's all that weâre fighting for
Though itâs not paradise

You and us, or I and them
There comes a time to take a stand
The wheel is watching all that keeps on burning

The venom works, itâs like a curse
A Trojan horse, when will we learn?
The wheel embodies all that keeps returning

All in all youâd expect the wise to be wiser
Fallen from grace
And all and all I guess
We should have known better, âcauseâ¦

What about us?
Isnât it enough,
No weâre not in paradise

This is who we are
This is what we've got
No, it's not our paradise

But itâs all we want,
And it's all that weâre fighting for
Though itâs not paradise

[Solo]

What about us?
Isnât it enough,
No weâre not in paradise

This is who we are
This is what we've got
No, it's not our paradise

But itâs all we want,
And it's all that weâre fighting for

What about us?
Isnât it enough,
No weâre not in paradise

This is who we are
This is what we've got
No, it's not our paradise

But itâs all we want,
And it's all that weâre fighting for
But itâs not paradise

What about us, what about us, what about us, isn't it enough?
What about us, what about us, what about us, isn't it enough?
What about us, what about us, what about us, isn't it enough?
What about us, what about us, what about us, isn't it enough!
