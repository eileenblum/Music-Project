Iâve been walking this road of desire,
Iâve been begging for blood on the wall.
I donât care if Iâm playing with fire,
Iâm aware that Iâm frozen inside.
I have known all along.

So much more going on, no denying,
But I know Iâm not standing alone.

Youâve been playing my mind through my wishes.
You can feel that weâre haunting the truth.
Don't know why, can't hold on, always losing control.

In the middle of the night,
I donât understand whatâs going on,
Itâs a world gone astray.
In the middle of the night,
I canât let it out.
Someone keeps searching
And shatters your life.
It will never be in vain
In the middle of the night.

No more tears, no, âcause nothing else matters,
Iâve been closing my eyes for too long.
Only vengeance will make me feel better,
Thereâs no rest 'til I know that itâs done.

Youâve been playing my mind through my wishes.
You can feel that weâre haunting the truth.
Don't know why, can't hold on, always losing control (losing control).

In the middle of the night,
I donât understand whatâs going on
Itâs a world gone astray.
In the middle of the night,
I canât let it out.
Someone keeps searching
And shatters your life.
It will never be in vain
In the middle of the night.

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night

In the middle of the night,
I donât understand whatâs going on,
Itâs a world gone astray.
In the middle of the night,
I canât let it out.
Someone keeps searching
And shatters your life.
It will never be in vain
In the middle of the night
