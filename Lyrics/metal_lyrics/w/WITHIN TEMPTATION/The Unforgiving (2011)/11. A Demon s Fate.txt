Ohhohoho

Youâll burn this time
Seeing the violence
It's feeding my mind
No one is saving you
How can you find a heaven in this hell?

Leave it behind
Hearing your silence
It screams our goodbye
Cannot believe it's an eye for an eye
Let us go to waste

Angels have faith
I don't want to be a part of his sin
I don't want to get lost in his world
I'm not playing this game

When the shadows remain
In the light of day
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate
He'll be falling from grace
'Til the end of all his days

From the ashes and hate
It's a cruel demon's fate
On the wings of darkness
He's returned to stay
There will be no escape
'Cause he's fallen far from grace

Ohhohoho

What have you done?
Is this what you wanted?
What have you become?
Your soul's now forsaken
You're walking alone
From heaven into hell.
Now that you know
Your way in this madness
Your powers have grown
Your chains have been broken
You've suffered so long
You will never change.

Angels have faith
I don't want to be a part of his sin
I don't want to get lost in his world
I'm not playing this game

When the shadows remain
In the light of day
On the wings of darkness
He'll retaliate
He'll be falling from grace
'Til the end of all his days

From the ashes and hate
It's a cruel demon's fate
On the wings of darkness
He's returned to stay
There will be no escape
'Cause he's fallen far from grace

Angels have faith
I don't want to be a part of his sin
I don't want to get lost in his world
I'm not playing this game

When the shadows remain
In the light of day
On the wings of darkness
He'll retaliate
He'll be falling from grace
'Til the end of all his days

From the ashes and hate
It's a cruel demon's fate
On the wings of darkness
He's returned to stay
There will be no escape
'Cause he's fallen far from grace

Oh oh oh oh [x4]
