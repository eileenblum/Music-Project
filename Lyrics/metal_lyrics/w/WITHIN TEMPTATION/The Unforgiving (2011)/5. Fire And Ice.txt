Every word youâre saying is a lie
Run away my dear
But every sign will say your heart is deaf

Bury all the memories
Cover them with dirt
Whereâs the love we once had
Our destinyâs unsure
Why canât you see what we had
Let the fire burn the ice
Whereâs the love we once had
Is it all a lie?

And I still wonder
Why heaven has died
The skies are all falling
Iâm breathing but why?
In silence I hold on
To you and I

Closer to insanity
Buries me alive
Whereâs the life we once had
It cannot be denied
Why canât you see what we had?
Let the fire burn the ice
Whereâs the love we once had
Is it all a lie?

And I still wonder
Why heaven has died
The skies are all falling
Iâm breathing but why?
In silence I hold on
To you and I

You run away
You hide away
To the other side of your universe
Where youâre safe from all that hunts you down
But the world has gone
Where you belong
And it feels too late so youâre moving on
Can you find your way back home?

And I still wonder
Why heaven has died
The skies are all falling
Iâm breathing but why?
In silence I hold on
To you and I

Every word youâre saying is a lie.
