I canât sleep âcause it's burning deep inside
Like gasoline on fire running wild
No more fear âcause Iâm getting closer now
So unreal but I like it anyhow

[Pre-chorus:]
I go faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster.

[Chorus:]
And I canât live in a fairytale of lies
And I canât hide from the feeling âcause itâs right
And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life
I canât live in a fairytale of lies

I can feel that you mesmerize my heart
I feel so free, Iâm alive, Iâm breaking out
I wonât give in, âcause Iâm proud of all my scars
And I can see Iâve been wasting too much time

[Pre-chorus and chorus]

A fairytale of lies

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]

A fairytale of lies.
