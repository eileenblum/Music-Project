In the shadow awaits a desire
But you know that you canât realize
And the pressure will just keep on rising
Now the heat is on
It's too late, there is no way around it,
You have seen it yourself many times.
In the end you will give up to fight it
Unescapable

'Cause you're losing your mind and you're sleeping with wide-open eyes

Where is the edge of your darkest emotions?
Why does it all survive?
Where is the light of your deepest devotions?
I pray that it's still alive

It's the rule that you live by and die for
It's the one thing you cannot deny
Even though you don't know what the price is,
It is justified
So much more that you've got now to fight for
But it still doesn't change who you are
There is no fear you'll ever give in to,
You're untouchable

'Cause you're losing your mind and you're sleeping with wide-open eyes

Where is the edge of your darkest emotions?
Why does it all survive?
Where is the light of your deepest devotions?
I pray that it's still alive

You can't stop yourself,
Don't want to feel
Don't want to see what you've become
You can't walk away from who you are
Never give in

Where is the edge of your darkest emotions?
Why does it all survive?
Where is the light of your deepest devotions?
I pray that it's still alive
