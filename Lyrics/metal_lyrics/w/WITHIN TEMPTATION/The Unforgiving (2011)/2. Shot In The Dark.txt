Iâve been left out alone like a damn criminal
Iâve been praying for help 'cause I canât take it all
Iâm not done,
Itâs not over.
Now Iâm fighting this war since the day of the fall
And Iâm desperately holding on to it all
But Iâm lost
Iâm so damn lost

Oh I wish it was over,
And I wish you were here
Still Iâm hoping that somehow

âCause your soul is on fire
A shot in the dark,
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?
I breathe underwater
Itâs all in my hands
But what can I do?
Donât let it fall apart
A shot in the dark [2x]

In the blink of an eye
I can see through your eyes
As Iâm lying awake Iâm still hearing the cries.
And it hurts,
Hurts me so bad.
And Iâm wondering why I still fight in this life
âCause Iâve lost all my faith in this damn bitter strife
And itâs sad
Itâs so damn sad

Oh I wish it was over,
And I wish you were here
Still Iâm hoping that somehow

âCause your soul is on fire
A shot in the dark,
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?
I breathe underwater
Itâs all in my hands
But what can I do?
Donât let it fall apart
A shot in the dark [5x]

I feel you are fading away [4x]

âCause your soul is on fire
A shot in the dark,
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?
I breathe underwater
Itâs all in my hands
But what can I do?
Donât let it fall apart

Oh, your soul is on fire
A shot in the dark,
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?
I breathe underwater
Itâs all in my hands
But what can I do?
Donât let it fall apart
A shot in the dark [5x]
