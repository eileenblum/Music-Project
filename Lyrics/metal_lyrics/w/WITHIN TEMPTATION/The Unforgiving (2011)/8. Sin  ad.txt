Iâve got to try itâs not over yet
No signals of life have you left
My heart is bleeding just for you
Bleeds for only you
And it hurts to know the truth

Are you looking for saviour
Chasing a dream?
Love turned to hate
Now I'm crossing the borders
Sealing our fate
But I'm not afraid

Oh SinÃ©ad,
For the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you
You will like it, I know
Oh SinÃ©ad,
It's the first time
Only you can set it free
Oh SinÃ©ad
Come break away with me

This second chance, I know, won't last
But it's OK, got no regrets
And I, I feel the end near, I'm no fool
Getting closer
But I'm doing what I should

I've been drowning in sorrow
Chasing tomorrow, running away
Now you're crossing the borders
Sealing tomorrow
But you're not afraid

Oh SinÃ©ad,
For the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you
You will like it, I know
Oh SinÃ©ad,
It's the first time
Only you can set it free
Oh SinÃ©ad
Come break away with me

I've been drowning in sorrow
Chasing tomorrow, running away
Now you're crossing the borders
Sealing tomorrow
But you're not afraid

Oh SinÃ©ad,
For the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you
You will like it...

Oh SinÃ©ad,
For the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you
You will like it, I know
Oh SinÃ©ad,
It's the first time
Only you can set it free
Oh SinÃ©ad
Come break away with me.
