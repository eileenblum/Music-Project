[iTunes bonus track]

Iâm on a road of broken dreams
And i need to know why
Seek the truth through lies to be my guide
Iâm in a world of doubt and trust
Canât deny

I lost my way here in this quest, canât lie
I canât believe whats happening, i donât know what to say
I cant believe i left to see this day

I donât wanna live this way, it haunts my mind
And i just need to get it straight, stop wasting time
And i donât wanna live and feel that i can change whats right
But i know, weâll be living in a lie

Oh iâll be hanging on the cross
When i put the nails in
Itâs time to choose a road that we believe in
You say you understand it all, try and smile
If only i could see itâs true somehow

I canât believe whats happening
I donât know what to say
And what i wouldnât give to change our fate
I donât wanna live this way, it haunts my mind
And i just need to get it straight, stop wasting time
And i donât wanna live and feel that i can change whats right

But i know, weâll be living in a lie
And iâve tried so hard to hold on
But i keep on falling
And no matter how hard i run
I just keep returning
And iâm back to where i started from

I donât wanna live this way, it haunts my mind
And i just need to get it straight, stop wasting time
I donât wanna live this way ,it haunts my mind
And i just need to get it straight, stop wasting time
And i donât wanna live and feel that i can change
whats right
But i know, weâll be living in a lie
