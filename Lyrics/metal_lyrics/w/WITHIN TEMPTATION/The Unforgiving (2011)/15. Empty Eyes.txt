[iTunes bonus track]

Youâre determined by faith
You pretend to make up
You lay out your case like the enemy
But all that you got
through dirty white lies
Canât find the damned correct way of blaming me
for your crimes
Wonât you talk to me
Donât laugh and run away
Iâm onto you, yesterday
with empty eyes
I donât know where Iâm going
in search for answers
I donât know who Iâm fighting
I stand with empty eyes
Youâre like a ghost within me
whoâs draining my life
Itâs like my soul is see through
Right through my empty eyes
Iâm about to give in
Got nowhere to go
Afraid of the sense Iâm holding on
Thereâs no other way
No doubt in the end
But I ainât got a thing to lose
Nothing to defend
Wonât you talk to me
Donât laugh and run away
Iâm onto you, yesterday
With empty eyes
I donât know where Iâm going
In search for answers
I donât know who Iâm fighting
I stand with empty eyes

Youâre like a ghost within me
whoâs draining my life
Itâs like my soul is see through
Right through my empty eyes
Ohh, ohh please wonât you give in to me
Wonât you finally speak true from lie
Youâre determined by faith
You pretend to make up
You lay out your case like the enemy
like the enemey
With empty eyes
I donât know where Iâm going
in search for answers
I donât know who Iâm fighting
I stand with empty eyes
Youâre like a ghost within me
whoâs draining my life
Itâs like my soul is see through
Right through my empty eyes
