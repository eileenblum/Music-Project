It's been a while since I told you
That I hate you
You've turned the truth inside out
Don't turn your back when I face you
Or I'll make you
You turned my world upside down

You get inside my head
I want you out
'Cause I've been betrayed on holy ground

Burying the truth with lies
Fed up how you justify
And I hate it
And I hate it
You're so despicable
When you're acting reasonable
And I hate it
And I hate it
Your words like firing guns, bullets raining
The way you hurt me 'cause you never want to face it
Your words like firing guns, bullets raining
Bullets raining
You never want to face it

What does it take now to break you
To awake you
To make you bow and spit it out
Does it matter if I hate you
Or embrace you
Nothing makes you turn around

You got inside my head
I want you out
'Cause I've been betrayed on holy ground

Burying the truth with lies
Fed up how you justify
And I hate it
And I hate it
You're so despicable
When you're acting reasonable
And I hate it
And I hate it
Your words like firing guns, bullets raining
The way you hurt me 'cause you never want to face it
Your words like firing guns, bullets raining
Bullets raining
You never want to face it
The way you hurt me 'cause you never want to face it

Burying the truth with lies
Fed up how you justify
And I hate it
And I hate it
You're so despicable
When you're acting reasonable
And I hate it
And I hate it
Your words like firing guns, bullets raining
The way you hurt me 'cause you never want to face it
Your words like firing guns, bullets raining
Bullets raining
You never want to face it

Bullets raining
You never want to face it
