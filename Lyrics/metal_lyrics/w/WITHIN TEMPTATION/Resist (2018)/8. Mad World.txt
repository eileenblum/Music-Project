Can't control the restless part of me
Bowing down our heads to love and greed
I wonder
Can't deny it's in my head
Our world in flames
The blood we shed

Walls are falling down on us

We wanna scream our pain
And break away from the dark
Caught in this wicked game
We know that nothing stays the same

'Cause we're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
Mad world

Trying to hold on to all we know
But one day turn around and let it go
Restless
Can't deny the dreams we had are glowing sparks
The fire ain't dead

Walls are falling down on us

We wanna scream our pain
And break away from the dark
Caught in this wicked game
We know that nothing stays the same

'Cause we're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
Mad world!

We hate, we love, we're fighting
This world is tearing us apart
And piece by piece, we're crumbling
We're crumbling

We wanna scream our pain
And break away from the dark
Caught in this wicked game
We know that nothing stays the same

'Cause we're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world

We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
We're living in a mad world
Mad world!
