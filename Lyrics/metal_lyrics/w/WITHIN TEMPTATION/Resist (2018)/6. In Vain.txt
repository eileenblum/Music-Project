Beautify all I know
Keep on dancing
Let it all turn to gold
When the dream touches ground
The demons walk in
And I know what awaits

A priceless glory
Memento mori
All for nothing now
I know

Nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could have stayed
We've been here long enough, long enough
To know it's all in vain

Everything we try to say
Up until the final day
I guess we said enough, said enough
To know it's all in vain (oh, oh)

All in vain (oh, oh)
All in vain (oh, oh)
All in vain (oh, oh)
All in vain (oh, oh)

See the world through a tear
Keep on breathing
Soul has dried you're not here

Just a heartbeat away
The demons walk in
Now I know it's too late

A priceless glory
Memento mori
All for nothing now
I know

Nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could have stayed
We've been here long enough, long enough
To know it's all in vain

Everything we try to say
Up until the final day
I guess we said enough, said enough
To know it's all in vain (oh, oh)

All in vain (oh, oh)
All in vain (oh, oh)
All in vain (oh, oh)
All in vain (oh, oh)

To the memories, but I can feel them fading
All our vanities, there's nothing left to save me now
I can take 'em 'cross the border
I can take 'em 'cross the border

Leaving everything we have for you to find it
Every time I walk away I wanna turn around
I wanna turn around

But nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could have stayed
We've been here long enough, long enough
To know it's all in vain

Everything we try to say
Up until the final day
I guess we said enough, said enough
To know it's all in vain (oh, oh)

Vain
Yeah oh oh oh

I guess we said enough, said enough
To know it's all in vain (oh, oh)

All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
