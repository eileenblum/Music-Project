Breathe, I need to breathe
And wipe off the scarlet red
Make my heart slow down
I know I will find you here

You are trophy hunting
Kill for nothing
Tired of watching
Turning tables

I can't let go
I'll set them free from you

I won't give in

You, you won't escape me
I'll rise from the deep
In this final moment,
No words left to say
I can't let you be,
When life fades away
You, you won't escape me
'Cause I'll set you free

Time, I need more time
But patience is hard for me
Feel my blood rushing,
Slowly I'm closing in

Trophy hunting
Kill for nothing
Tired of watching
Turning tables

I can't let go
I'll set them free from you

I won't give in

You, you won't escape me
I'll rise from the deep
In this final moment,
No words left to say
I can't let you be,
When life fades away
You, you won't escape me
'Cause I'll set you free

In the end we go out our own way
When time comes no one can stay
Why is nothing ever easy and the truth is never straight
Slowly learning how to be me
All alone but I can see
That I never will give in, no, always free

You, you won't escape me
I'll rise from the deep
In this final moment,
No words left to say
I can't let you be,
When life fades away
You, you won't escape me
'Cause I'll set you free
