[feat. Jasper Steverlinck]I pay my dues
All for truth
Can't leave it here and leave it here
And leave it here forgotten
Silence rules
As blind as fools
You'll never learn, never learn
Never learn to break away

Oh, why can't we rise again?

When all the days go by a firelight
We'll never fade out in the night
And we are estranged, we're drawn to the flame
We are like fire to the rain

Isn't it strange that love is in the way?
It never goes away (never goes away)

I paid my dues (my dues, my dues)
All for truce
I leave it here, leave it here
Leave it here forgotten

Life will rule
Over truth
We'll never learn, never learn
Never learn to break away

Oh, why can't we rise again?

When all the days go by a firelight
We'll never fade out in the night
And we are estranged, we're drawn to the flame
We are like fire to the rain

Isn't it strange that love is in the way?
Isn't it strange that love is in the way?

When all the days go by a firelight
We'll never fade out in the night
And we are estranged, we're drawn to the flame
We are like fire to the rain

Isn't it strange that love is in the way?
It never goes away
Away
