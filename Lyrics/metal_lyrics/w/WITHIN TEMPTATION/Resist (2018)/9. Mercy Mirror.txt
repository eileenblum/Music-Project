We are, forever as one
In what remains
You're in my blood,
From the cradle to the grave

I don't like to think about the pieces
All the cracks and the breaks that still remain
If I could breathe
I'd ask you

To look at my mercy mirror
I need you more than I've known
To look at my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go

Now I know
Now I know
I'm not ready to let you go

Now I know
Now I know
I'm not ready to let you go

My heart, like a planet the sun forgot
Where now?
Orbiting the light that I had lost

More than words the silence teaches
How to see and to feel what is real
When the sunlight reaches my soul

So look at my mercy mirror
I need you more than I've known
To look at my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go

Now I know
Now I know
I'm not ready to let you go

Now I know
Now I know
I'm not ready to let you go

It's a wicked game life plays,
How it gives and takes away
No turning around, touching ground
What we had was so much more than I realised

If I could I'd embrace, embrace you!

And look at my mercy mirror
I need you more than I've known
To look at my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go

Now I know
Now I know
I'm not ready to let you go

Now I know
Now I know
I'm not ready to let you go

I'm not ready to let you go!
