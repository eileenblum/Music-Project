You're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down

Looking through the glass
Cannot recognize the ghost that you're seeing
Every step you take on the burning sand
Slowly sinking deeper

All the memories remain, all the pain from your broken home
And the walls 'round your heart grew so strong
You can't let go

You keep crawling on
Don't wanna let it go
So you keep holding on
To feel whole

'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down

'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
Is it worth dying for?
Or are you blinded by, blinded by it all?

Here they come again
Hear them whispering when your heart is bleeding
Like a symphony playing on repeat
Unraveling your feelings

All the memories remain, all the strain you feel broken up
And the weight that you feel pulls you down
You can't let go

You keep crawling on
Don't wanna let it go
So you keep holding on
To feel whole

'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down

'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
Is it worth dying for?
Or are you blinded by, blinded by it all?

It's an endless war
But then they cut me down
They cut me down once more

System overload. Self-destruct sequence activated. One minute 'til self-destruction.

Don't let them cut me down
Cut me down once more
