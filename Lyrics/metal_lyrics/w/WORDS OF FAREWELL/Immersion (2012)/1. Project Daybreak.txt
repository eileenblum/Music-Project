A dainty figure in the morning mist
"Bide your time and hold out hope"
She whispered, "or set your heart at rest
For it is a foolish heart I leave behind"

For all that once was is now gone
Whereverat this sleeper may lie
Sweetly to decease and be torn asunder
To bewail your loss in these nights

The hauntings of a wayward day
Shall never follow you on your way
For you to leave this, your bitter trail
I sought you, may this delight prevail
Our hearts filled with fright as we run
from the hideous presence of the sun
The hauntings of a wayward day
Shall never follow you on your way

Her mighty harbinger, a morning star
at the van of day, leaves no enmity no contempt

The first gleam of sunlight illuminates the sky
So with reluctant dread I hide from the vivid light
Aweary of the outsetâs first sentinel
I cringe away in deepest despair

The moon looks upon my departure with a watery eye
Wanton winds accompany me on my long way home
As I hear the dawnâs yearning call
I bid farewell to you all
