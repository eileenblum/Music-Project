Waking up on a moonlight meadow at night
A gentle breeze blowing like autumns first breath
Stumbling through the murk I explore the shades
Leaving all the past anxieties far behind....

The celestial stars are shifting
As the grass starts to sway in the wind
Branches silently groaning around me
Iâm standing in misery and woe

The rising haze â¦
Takes away my bitter cloak of mourning
And so my will to live had died
Becoming a lone wayfarer, never to return

A fate condemned into the dark
Amongst the shadows I wander
Where only candles light my way
Throughout these endless fields of forsaken souls

Watch the lonely candle's flame burning out
Still even in deepest despair thereâs a spark of hope
Iâm all alone seeing my veneration subside
Where solemn faces are edged upon hallowed soil

The rising haze â¦
Takes away my bitter cloak of mourning
And so I became one with the wind
A wanderer seeking solace in the faraway

I hear the spirits dance around my memories in black
Laughing at my despair and tears
Carried away by the stormy gale
To fall like rain on distant shores

The rising haze â¦
Takes away my bitter cloak of mourning

And so I am telling you this vagrant story

Of a restless soul unbound and free
