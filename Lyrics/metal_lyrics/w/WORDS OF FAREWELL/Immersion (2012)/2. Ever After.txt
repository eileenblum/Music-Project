I found a place to call home
My sanctuary in a world succumbing to grief 
A gleam of hope, like ivy embrace me 
And don't let me go

My gardens bare trees now flourish again 
The shadows they cast hide me away 
From bale's burning light 
Safely entwined I hide until night

Be gone parching sun
To the twilight that you came from
Be gone, away
Darken this idle day

Blessed by nights serenity
I will rise
From the ashes of a burned down life
Burned down life

I smother every smoldering fire
That threatens the orchards bloom
Upon the oath I took
I forever will take what is mine

They say I fade into shades without a trace
A nocturnal child 
Veiled and obscure, a myth yet uncovered 
Don't you dare light my way

"And then led astray he went away
To never return
But in his heart he carried the hope of his dreams 
What may he have become?"
