The vast neon outshines the sky
For every earthborn light a star shall perish
These endless streets are burning bright
Origin of savage apparitions

Amongst the nightly cityscapes
Where we reign, urban panorama

Centuries of constant motion
In a city that never sleeps
Vanishing in the crowd
We disappear from your reach

Find your solace in the countless alleyways
Shimmering districts of a radiant utopia
Vibrant crossroads at the pulse of time
Prevalence of sheer beauty so divine

Rain clouds dissembling the sky
The smell of burning concrete in the air
In slow motion faces waving across our way
A never ending flow beyond the means

Listening to the heartbeat of a time
Traffic lights setting the rapid pace
Captivating surges of sound
Evoking this sudden revelation

Overwhelmed by the scenery sublime
Drifting through the perpetuating nights
Monumental disorder in perfect symmetry
As weâre joining the dreamlike midnight carnival

At the end of our journey
As we're stepping into the limelight
Umeda Panorama
