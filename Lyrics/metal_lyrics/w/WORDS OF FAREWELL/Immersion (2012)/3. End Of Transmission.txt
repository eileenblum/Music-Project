Another doleful day is dawning
Again your pillow is soaked with tears
And yet you have to realize why
Your life turned out to be this way

Lying awake in your darkest hour
All alone you pity yourself
The question still remains in your head
A proof for your glorious self-treachery

Youâre drowning in the depth of your heart
Descending into the darkness below
Iâm following my ardent longing to be free
Ascending into the heavens above

You never were brave enough to save yourself
Because every victory holds the seed for another defeat
So you just gave up the fight

There has been mere break of faith
No deliverance from your dreadful sins
For you have lost the freedom you once had

At solitary times when the flickering static is your only friend
You wish you had chased all those dreams you had along the way

A thousand lights fade every day
No one takes notice
But I will make my way to the horizon
For I will not fade away

If a single star perishes in the night
No, no one will mourn
But I will fight for my trueborn liberty
For I will not go down
