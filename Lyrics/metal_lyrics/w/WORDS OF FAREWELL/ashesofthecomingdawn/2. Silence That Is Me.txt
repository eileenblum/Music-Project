A question, that never should be asked
All the void it makes
Drawing pictures in the dust called past
Lonesome thoughts walk along with unknown feelings
Now as I try to change
The void just breaks me down

There comes a mighty laughter from beyond this world
"All these wasted moments", by the time I silently cry
I want to slip into my own realm, where sorrow is pretentious
An utopia where outcasts don't exist

Broken words that sigh to be heard
That sigh to escape from my world
But they're all bound to always be
Silent as the silence that is me
I form a fist and my lungs fail
As I whisper let my die this way
But my wish's all bound to always be
Silent as the silence that is me

I try to breathe, but as I inhale I'm faithless
My estimation for time is lost, I can't sense it anymore
There's a place I would like to be
But when I call out it disappears
So I forget that it ever existed in my world
