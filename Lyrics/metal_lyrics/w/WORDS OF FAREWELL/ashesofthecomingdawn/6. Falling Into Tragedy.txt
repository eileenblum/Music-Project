Her oppressed knowledge, all that remained of her
Was a promise proving fate
As the gods broke up her shell
Aside the audience laughing at her

She must have been blessed with a gift
As her premonition became reality

"Come see the true light of day" she screamed
But no one granted her this wish
(Why did I not listen ?)
Maybe she was already dead
To those who did not see the truth in her words
(How could I be so blind ?)

Still her desperate cries resound
Amidst these concrete towers
... that mark our demise

Crestfallen she begged the gods
To reveal themselves to the crowd
All their souls still resting at ease
Hiding in their yet unbroken shells
But her gods never came

But her gods never came
Yet took her unbearable curse away
A shame with which
She was bound to decay
So her last sigh choked
On the weight of her vision
