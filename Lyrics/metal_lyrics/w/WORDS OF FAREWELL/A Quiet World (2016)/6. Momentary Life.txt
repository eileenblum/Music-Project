Of what magnitude is this complexion of life?
Lying awake at the mercy of our train of thought
So we cover up our vices
And in a lack for grit try to outlive this weakness

Take these words and make sense of them if you will
Cause I am just too tired to care any longer
Yet I can feel that there is just no end to this
In the circle of self-deception

As we spend our waking years with a restless search for a higher meaning
I defy, for I can't take all these empty words and empty gestures anymore

What fortitude is there to be found in giving up?
Nothing leads us to a change in scope
There is no change of motivation
And so we anxiously welcome our demise

As we spend our waking years with a restless search for a higher meaning
I defy, for I canât take all these empty words and empty gestures anymore

No, but I will not be subject to these desires
For there cannot be only darker times ahead

As we spend our waking years with a restless search for a higher meaning
I defy, for I canât take all these empty words and empty gestures anymore

Hence we realize life has ran past our aspirations
Still fostering our fear of loss, still fostering all of our dreams
