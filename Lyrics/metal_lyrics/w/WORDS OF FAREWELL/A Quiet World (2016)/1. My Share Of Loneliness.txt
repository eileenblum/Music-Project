Don't look back or blame it on your guiding hands
As you feel the rising wind on your face
Telling stories of what could have been
In which no comfort is to be found, but doubt and despair
This dead end road has become your home

No healing your ailing heart
Only footsteps on rainy streets
You cannot let go of these strains
As they've made you who you are
As they've made us who we are

We are gathering regrets day by day
We're growing weaker by the minute
The downpour drenching us to the bone
Giving us our share of loneliness

Am I atoning for my mistakes
Or was it a twist of fate?
My trust has long become resentment
You see my face beset by pain

The aching written into my skin in furrows
The aching written into our skin in furrows

You turn away your head in silent reconciliation
Unable to fathom this burden of grief
While I ponder if it is worth to go on
Walking past doors long closed

We are gathering regrets day by day
Weâre growing weaker by the minute
The downpour drenching us to the bone
Giving us our share of loneliness

Hence our paths have crossed and shall now diverge again
We are one in the same in this plight struck world
Crestfallen and deprived of hope we wander into a darker tomorrow
Will there be a silver lining?

We are gathering regrets day by day
Weâre growing weaker by the minute
The downpour drenching us to the bone
Giving us our share of loneliness
