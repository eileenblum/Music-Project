So in the scarlet of morning skies
In the shimmering of the pond's ice
And in the puddles on the sunken road
We wait for someone truthful to despise

Something wild opened its eyes
So in the trunks of trees
In the shadows of the leaves
And in the bottom of the well
In the twilight of the eves
Something evanescent began to breathe

We keep perdition at bay
For it forces our hand in anger
Whispering death to all living things

So in the murmur of the river
In the coming of each cold shiver
And with the fall of a single drop of rain
We wait for someone who shall our spirit deliver
Only to see it wither

So at the foot of greenish hill
In the hollows of the abandoned mill
And in the gust over wavy grass
In each stroke of the quill
I begin to find my vivacious will

We keep perdition at bay
For it forces our hand in anger
Whispering death to all living things

Experience the throes of passion
As he is the adversary who seeks virtue in determination
Henceforth I serve thee no more
Soon to depart from this life
Whispering death to all living things
