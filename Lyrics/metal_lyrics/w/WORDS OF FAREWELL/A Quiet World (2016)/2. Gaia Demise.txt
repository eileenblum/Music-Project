The Earth is trembling beneath my feet
The remainder of all organic life is a putrid, pulsating mess
Meeting its own end
The allmother's eyes are weeping
Quivering as she pines away in regret
The Earth is trembling beneath my feet

Time has come to undo this mortal coil
So I lie down and become one with the soil

Bear witness to this last, great transmigration
For we will soon all vanish into eternity - this is final

Gaia arise!

Life itself is destined to fail
Self-awareness a curse by design
Mind and soul entwined by a frail body bound
Trapped in rejection of one another

So every last glimpse of light starts to fade now
The repulsion is released to cease at last
And to the dust we came from we will return

Bear witness to this last, great transmigration
For we will soon all vanish into eternity - this is final

Embrace the collapse!
Embrace the collapse!

Gaia demise!
