Snow falling on shore pines, the world all covered in white
So peaceful so serene, the foothills are lying right before me

Frozen breath burning on my cheeks
While I behold the wintry landscape
Stretching out as far as the eye can see

All the sounds are muted, only a crane's call drawing near
Inhaling forts of frosty air. footprints are all I leave behind

Standing alone against the elements under the dancing lights
This flight shall teach me my place in the universe
For in awe and wonder we all must thrive

Survival a matter of instinct, every movement now essential
To challenge the dreadful cold in these parts

Bewilderment within me starts to arise
I can feel the numbness creeping into my fingers
The freezing grip of winter tightens
Still striding upward clouds are all I leave below
I tread past blue ponds and steaming rivers
The mountain will wait for me, the mountain will wait for me!

Standing alone against the elements under the dancing lights
This flight shall teach me my place in the universe
For in awe and wonder we all must thrive

Sinking deeper the strength leaves my limbs
So I lay myself down to rest
At what seems like the top of the world
To watch the moon set upon the farthest reach
