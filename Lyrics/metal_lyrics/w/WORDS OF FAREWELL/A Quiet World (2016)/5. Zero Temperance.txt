To be alive is to be awake
And Iâve barely opened my eyes
Now torn from existence at the yore of my day
So many stories left to tell

I erupted into life against all odds
Yet the thirst for it I could not quench
My desires they brought me out here
To do nothing more but to witness... the end

So scatter my ashes across the wildest of oceans
For I was to see it all
Having been born with zero temperance

No, I did not let myself be forced into submission
Always with hungry heart and open mind
But I would do it yet again, yeah
And go out with a grin on my face

My friends carry me to the pyre
This bonfire lit only for me
I have come to terms with the world
To be able to see the curtains fall

Celebrate the infinite passion
By which this fate was set in motion
Once kindled by discontent
And my feet start moving on their own

So scatter my ashes throughout the lushest of forests
For I was to see it all
Having been born with zero temperance

So scatter my ashes atop the highest of mountains
For I was to see it all
Having been born with zero temperance
