In times of silent prosperity
Doubt may grow the most

As the intrepid soul challenges the constancy
Tip the balance and it may shatter the equilibrium
Towering above these industrial landscapes

A lifetime of impressions all to be lost in indifference
I beheld the flare stacks with their flaming heads

For the world will not find its end in an instantaneous flash
But with whimpering decay it will have to suffice
And so do I

The gallows frame edged against the grim sky
In a continuous display of monotony
Numb me, alienate me, leave me in spatial disarray

This alienation causes disorientation
So as you hear my voice for the last time
You shall always remember that I once lived here

Where the sun shines through the smoky alleys
Upon only those who pierce the state of trust
When its foundation's very fabric is eroded rapidly

The gallows frame edged against the grim sky
In a continuous display of monotony
Numb me, alienate me, leave me in spatial disarray

Leave me at the wayside, down here in the gutter
So leave me out here in the cold, face down in the dirt

Leave me at the wayside, down here in the gutter
So leave me out here in the cold, face down in the dirt, yeah

Leave me at the wayside, down here in the gutter
So leave me out here in the cold, face down in the dirt
Leave me at the wayside, down here in the gutter
So leave me out here in the cold, face down in the dirt
