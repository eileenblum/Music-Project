In the beginning there was a simple deed to be done
To expand this narrow idea of a world
My past self now nothing but a memory
Looking ahead I see a face gleaming in content

During a brief moment, suspended in white light
In my mortal fear I created this shadow my likeness
Fueling me, haunting me, propelling me forward

And so I shaped a goal to achieve in a single stroke of a brush
Painting a complete picture of my future
This specter now and then following me, trailing me behind

Iâm chasing a mirage glimmering in the distance
Thinking about all the intersections crossed
All those that are yet to come

I detrude myself yet another time
Only to take the next step
Did I take a wrong turn?
Do I fall short in the end?

Did I take a wrong turn?
Do I fall short in the end?

During a brief moment, suspended in white light
In my mortal fear I created this shadow my likeness
Fueling me, haunting me, propelling me forward

Driving me to desperate measures
My likeness wonât let me rest
The shadow again is closing in on me
The momentum shifts in favor of greater meaning
Something genuine forms into the purpose I need to live

During a brief moment, suspended in white light
In my mortal fear I created this shadow my likeness
Fueling me, haunting me, propelling me forward

In the beginning there was a simple deed to be done
To expand this narrow idea of a world
During a brief moment, suspended in white light
In my mortal fear I created this shadow my likeness
Fueling me, haunting me, propelling me forward
Something genuine forms into the purpose I need to live
