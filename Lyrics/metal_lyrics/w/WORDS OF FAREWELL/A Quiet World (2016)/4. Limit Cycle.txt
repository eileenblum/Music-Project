Make no mistake, this is just a desire for unity born of loss
For an antithesis to the fragmentation of character by modern life
This is nothing more but a limitless need
Which has to be provided for

Were holistic by design
This everlasting unrest built into our marrow
There will not be resurgence of empathy only illusions of solidarity
A mere dire set of values set outside our egotistic view
Centered onto our finitude of life out of an inert anxiety

Without an iota of meaning
We're forging bonds that do not belong
Within the margin of error
Inherent to all of man

So I see compassion die in the eyes of those around me
As insanity turns to reason and reason turns to fear

It all comes to a close as we relinquish all of our values
Leaving us in isolation, craving to break out, immolating our idle souls
Hence we're keeping ourselves company with acts of moral affectation

Atomistic by design we do not relate to others
All are suffering from an anomie of emotion soon to peak in divergence
Mutual benefit driving us to compromise, only feigning our interest
We're trying to keep in touch by hypocrisy, failing miserably

Without an iota of meaning
Weâre forging bonds that do not belong
Within the margin of error
Inherent to all of man

So I see compassion die in the eyes of those around me
As insanity turns to reason and reason turns to fear

And so were frying to patch up what little is left of integrity
Yet again failing so miserably

Without an iota of meaning
Weâre forging bonds that do not belong
Within the margin of error
Inherent to all of man

So I see compassion die in the eyes of those around us
As insanity turns to reason and reason turns to fear
