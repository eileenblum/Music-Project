Time bending itself out of shape
Merging with nothing, so nothing remains
Coordinates shifting, dragged out of sight
Devoured and deleted

A violent anomaly defying existence
Disabling recognition to swallow all information

A glitch in the grid of reality
Like a ghost, remnant of a luminary

Rushing towards the threshold of entropy
Soon clad in darkness, enduring till the end of time

But a shadow remains of all ontology
Only a radiation aura, reverberating
Density growing beyond all proportion
A singularity in universal equations
Opposing to exceed the limitations of gravity

Rushing towards the threshold of entropy
Soon clad in darkness, enduring till the terminal state
Until all mass has perished in blackness
The ghost will remain, feeding on roving souls

One last circumnavigation
Dissipate at the event horizon
Torn apart by the tides
Drifting, shifting
Time will end right here
Space will end right now
