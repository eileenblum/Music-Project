A mere fallacy leads to despite
Obliteration of matters and feelings
A blurred border you do not dare cross
A forgotten sanctuary you cannot claim
The smoke of neglect slowly disperses
Emitting submission to the society

Questioning all that is given to you
That gathering swarm of bliss ebbing in no time
It's the end of that promising road
It has come, your final end of days

Enclose an extending dream of emptiness
Lose your way, redefine your patterns of life
Unfortold promises will lead into oblivion
Your weak heart damaged beyond repair

Burned out spirit, still smoldering in the dark
Forever to be kept in this desolate state 
Your gleaming skin chilled by steady rain
Slowly dissolving into the chaos of evocation

It was a simple blink that turned day to night

Pathetic, frail 
Broken and defeated
You cannot live
