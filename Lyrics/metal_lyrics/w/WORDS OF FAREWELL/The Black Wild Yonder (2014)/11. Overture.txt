[Bonus Track]Set out to claim what fate is rightfully yours
May your screams send out ripples through eternity
As you're cast into the pandemonium of life                       
Thrown into the wild sea you donât know where to go ashore

The struggle against embitterment may never end
Rancor giving birth to a sense of desperation
Those once halcyon days forever gone
Black despair is but an overture to what is yet to come

Having lost your way in the dark
Youâve yet caught but a glimpse of the abyss
For little do you know about the end of the world
Until you see it crumble one fateful day

Shipwrecked and stranded on yet uncharted lands
Stumbling through the unknown you have to prepare
For the worst to come your way
This might be your last call uttered with dying breath

They say childhood is over when you know you will die
Spending a lifetime in misery leads not to closure
But to animosity which we all claim our fate
This is the sad truth of those who set their sails
