They said we don't belong here
Only dreaming our lives away
So let all dreadful feelings subside
And sustain the loss while suffering
It is all just a means to an end

So while these days hardly pass by
This is all that is left of us

And so we returned home
To a place where the rain never ends
To find shelter in this sorrow 
No, I'm not worth a single tear you cry
Cause thereâs nothing left to say but goodbye

I feel so broken and old, oh so empty inside 
Throughout all these misspent years I've lived
All those wasted years yet to come
The veil of conjuration slowly wearing thin 
For hours on end we ran
And now I can feel we're just losing touch

With tired eyes I see your smiling face
Slowly closing my eyelids to shut out the blight 
Suddenly the world I sense around me feels so black
As we're drifting apart by time I still linger in the wake 

Without words 
And without screams
Without meaning 
And without heart
