Until the last light goes out in the distant night
My greedy thoughts wonât let me rest
Ere the letters have spilled onto the white 
This affluence of emotion bursting out of me

Now I feel what it's like to lose daylight by the hour
Unable to make sense of the bane of this sordid generation

If all else fails, I shall claim the pathos of my sacrifice
For this play is set so far beyond all logic 
But my will in disregard of order is yet to be broken 
Iâm not giving in to the harrowing surge of apathy

These words are shaken from a restless mind
Fathered by virtue at loss for life
By a fate set in motion

Their rapierâs gleaming blade pointed at your heart
Itâll show you fear in a handful of swirling dust
For I wish my words were free in the onset of your denial
