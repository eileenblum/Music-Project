Tear down these walls we built to protect
And withstand the need for resentment
During the advent of all things to come
Feel the friction of converging thoughts

Forming into emotions, bringing us to the brink of our senses
A charade of deduction we cannot grasp

Meet me at the outer rim, at the end of consciousness

Perpetuate those emotions, divulging all which defines us
A contortion of spaces escaping far beyond our perception
A systemic error of being giving birth to all of our actions
These alignments now falling apart

In order to break the barriers we once set ourselves
We are now passing the outer regions of our minds 

Answer my call for in the light we shall thrive 
Come again to your senses
And set the impending inception of change
