Satan, the roaring lion, roams to and fro
Seeking who can mate him power.
The word of God tells us so.

He's the father, the father of lies,
And he's come to destroy.
He's the one who hates you,
And discards you like a broken toy.

The Lord opposes the proud,
But gives grace to the humble.
Give yourself to God.
With your eyes on him, you won't stumble.

As for Satan, resist him
And he will flee from you.
Oh, resist him.
Get close to God, he will get close to you.

Oh Satan, he tells you he has something good for you.
He whispers in your ear, cracks open the door,
He crashes through
