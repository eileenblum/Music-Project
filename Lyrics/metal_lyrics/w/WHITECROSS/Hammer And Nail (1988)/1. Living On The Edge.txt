I know that your heart is burning out
Like a bon bon on the flame.
You've tried crouching in a different alley every night.
The rain wakes you up just the same.

Now Satan keeps a-playin', jumpin' up and around.
He's telling you take a dive.
You can't get a fix of what's going wrong,
He keeps feeding you alibies.

Living on the edge, while your world is coming apart.
Living on the edge, there's a cry in your heart.
Living on the edge, being dragged down by sin,
'Til the light of the world comes in.

Wouldn't cross the line that you never could see,
And you're spinning 360 degrees.
Just keep it moving around, keep it low to the ground.
You want a fire but he won't leave.

Uh huh, Satan's gonna pull you in every way.
Well, it's time to learn a thing or two.
When you feel the locomotion of a runaway train,
Jesus will be there for you.

Living on the edge, while your world is coming apart.
Living on the edge, there's a cry in your heart.
Living on the edge, being dragged down by sin,
'Til the light of the world comes in.

Used to ride home on a jet black horse.
Heard you coming four towns away.
Livin' on the lam, takin' nothing when you can.
Never should have gone past the day.

Now I see a change in the way that you live.
Satan's fit for yesterday's news.
You got the love in your eye, and I can understand why.
You got the Holy Spirit inside of you.

Living on the edge, while your world is coming apart.
Living on the edge, there's a cry in your heart.
Living on the edge, being dragged down by sin,
'Til the light of the world comes in.
