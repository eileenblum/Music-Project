I'll take the high road,
There's nothing stopping me now.
I like to gamble with my gang,
And there's no turning back.

I'm in the big time,
No one can deny it.
I'm playing for high stakes.
I'm on the attack.

Don't tell me there's no problem
If I gain the world and lose my soul.
Don't want to hear about eternity.
I live for today, this hour alone.

When the clock strikes,
The clock strikes midnight.
When the clock strikes,
Time's run out on you.
When the clock strikes,
The clock strikes midnight,
The Lord's going to give to each man his due.

The sun is rising,
It's high in the sky.
I burn the candle at full,
It's lighting up the night.

Don't try to cross me,
'Cause I'll throw you in
With dirty people, (?)
And I'll do it again.
