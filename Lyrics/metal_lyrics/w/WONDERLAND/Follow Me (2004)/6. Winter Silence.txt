Delight - watching the sea calm
Under the rain fall - surprise
Surprise - people have done away
Closing their deck-chairs
I come to stay
Defend - my simple existence
My silent dialogue
To modem noise
Shiver - cover my shiness
With all the battles
Won over me

[Bridge:]
Under stormy weather
Listen to my heaven whisper to my soul
Penetrating water
Feeling like a lover wait this symphony

[Chorus:]
Winter silence speaks to me
I don't want to live tomorrow
Winter silence cries to me
I don't like to say I'm sorry
Winter silence faces me
All my life I've spent running
Winter silence I won't go
I just wanna listen to my heart you know

Delight - watching the sea calm
Under the rain fall
Winter silence
Surprise - people have gone away
Closing their deck-chairs
I come to stay

[Bridge]
[Chorus x2]
