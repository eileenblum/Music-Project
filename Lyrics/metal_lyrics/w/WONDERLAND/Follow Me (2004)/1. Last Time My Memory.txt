They gave me time
To know me
They spent their time
To blame me
Now, they see me through iron bars
All their lives always "the beat"

I promised them
I'd change me
They laughed at me
And beat me
Now, the passage is behind me
I'll keep their faces wherever hi be

Last time my memory
Lonely with the enemy
Deep in my heart tin incredible part of me

Last time my memory
Lonely with the enemy
Open my heart I will find ? new light to follow me

Last lime my memory
Lonely with the enemy
Deep in my heart unincredible part of me

Last time my memory
Lonely with the enemy
Deep in my heart I will never forget and follow me

Never be fond - of the past
Even if it's inside your heart
Now, the passage is behind me
I'll keep their faces wherever ill be

Last time my memory
Lonely with the enemy
Deep in my heart unincredible part of me

Last time my memory
Lonely with the enemy
Open my heart I will find a new light to follow me

And follow me...
