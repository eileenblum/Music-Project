If you don't loose your head
When the others loose their heads
If you can make your dreams come true
But you're not a slave to them

Watch the line and follow it
Step by step straight to the end
One by one my inner prejudice
Crumble under the pressure

So you want to change your destiny
But you don't know how to do it
If you want to listen to my words
I can tell you what is good for you

[Chorus:]
You can follow me, you can find in you
Every face of your heart - I believe m you
Von can follow me, you can trust in you
Every time, when you keep holding on
On and on

If you can think about your life
But you're not an abstract man
If you can see every side of you
Loss and triumph, just the same

You can follow me, you can find in you
Every face of your heart - I believe in you
You can follow me, you can trust in you
Every time, when you keep holding on
On and on

You cart follow me, you can find in you
Every face of your heart - I believe in you
You can follow me, you can trust in you
Every time, when you keep holding on
On and on

[Chorus x2]
