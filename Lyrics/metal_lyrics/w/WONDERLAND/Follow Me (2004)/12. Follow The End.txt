[Bonus Track]

Many questions on myself
Many answers without the end
Many shelters in my dreams
Many existences we've got to live

Many questions on who's God
Many answers but no one is mine
So much fiction in the world
In all my preachers I found there my lord

Follow the end
Follow my way
From the beginning to the end

Follow the end
Straight to the aim
Follow my dream and net their way

Follow the end
Playing my game
From the beginning to the end

Follow the end
Follow my time
Follow my dream I only know the way

All the answers come and go
Never seen the truly light
Never shown my inner fight
Never found and never known

Many voices in my mind
Many answers but no one is mine
So much fiction in the world
In all my preachers I found there my lord
