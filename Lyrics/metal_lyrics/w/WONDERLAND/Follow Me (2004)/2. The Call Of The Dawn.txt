The light behind the door
Awakes my painful thoughts
His tentacles of gold
Caress my instant love

A sleepless night is gone
Leave me without the force
New sap of vital hope
Feed my earthly form

Is it the light that calls me home?
(The memory remains )
Is it the memory I know?
The call of the dawn, the secret unknown
The call of the dawn, the sound I know
The call of the dawn, the promise unknown
The call of the dawn, the sound I know

A smell of distant lands
A colour from the north
Is calling like a God
Give my his secret law

I feel the tuneful voice
Whisper to my pride
It knows I'm not surprised
To follow his recall

Is it the light that calls me home?
(The memory remains )
Is it the memory I know?
The call of the dawn, the secret unknown
The call of the dawn, the sound I know
The call of the dawn, the promise unknown
The call of the dawn, the sound I know
