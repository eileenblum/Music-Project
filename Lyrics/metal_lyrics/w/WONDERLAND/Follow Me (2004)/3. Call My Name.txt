Another frame of mind, I feel so aware
I never thought to see you there
There's a tear somewhere, and I don't know why
I'm not so proud to live again
Forever and ever, ever and ever

[Chorus:]
Call my name
Where ever you are
Sooner or later
Call my name
You can find me
Forever and ever again

Call my name
You can find me
Forever and ever again

I have never had, a cause to blame
A reason to cry, and I've learned from you
To reach your heart
I never thought of my peace of mind

[Chorus]

I can hear your voice somewhere
But my eyes can't see you there
In the silence of my soul
You are there hut you don't know
Forever and ever

[Chorus x2]

You can find me
I will rise
Just call my name
