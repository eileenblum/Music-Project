When the night comes
The day we surrender
You can find me eternally

When the dreams come
A shield to defend us
We drive ourselves to eternity

You can find in your dreams
You can find me eternally

You can find me in the air
You breathe you can find me anywhere

Sometime over the sadness
Keep your time and you can forgive me

Sometime over the sadness
Keep your time eternally

After the day goes
We stay on reflection
You can find me eternally.

When the dreams come
A shield to protect us
We drive ourselves to eternity

You can find in your dreams
You can find me eternally

You can find me in the air
You breathe you can find me anywhere

Sometime over the sadness
Keep your time and you can forgive me

Sometime over the sadness
Keep your time eternally
