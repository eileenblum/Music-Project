No resurrection
Can find with no reaction
Is inside you
Inside you deep - inside you see

Many times restrain my crying
But now I show the deed
I decide to change my life
And break the plans for me

Cross the tine through cloudy sky
Until my mood arise
Taste the fine of burning lies
A storm of rebel minds

[Bridge:]
I mess up all the building lies
Unfairness never lives my house

[Chorus:]
No resurrection
Can find with no reaction
Is inside you
Inside you deep
Mo resurrection
Can find with no reaction
Is inside you
Inside you see

Mental walls to break inside
Explode the drifting mine
Taste the fine of burning lies
A storm of rebel minds
Repeat bridge and chorus
No resurrection can find with no reaction
Is inside you inside you deep - inside you see
