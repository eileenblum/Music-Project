[Rubolotta]

Facing the window, wait for the dawn
A new day is rising, the last night is gone

Think about tomorrow, the world that I'll find
I stop and I stare at the millions of signs

Breathing so deeply, freedom is near
No more complaints and forget all the fears

Flee from the prison, ready to fly
I kiss the ground for my sweetest goodbye

Now it's time to go away
Now it's time to take my way
Now it's time to go away
Now it's time to take my way

[Solo guitar]

Now it's time to go away
Now it's time to take my way
Now it's time to go away
Now it's time to take my way

Facing the window, wait for the dawn
A new day is rising, the last night is gone

Feel something  tug, my image in the gloom
Terrible stories have lived in this room

Fear for the future, help I'll receive
Promise myself there's so much I can give

Flee from the prison, ready to fly
I kiss the ground for my sweetest
Goodbye... Goodbye... Goodbye...
