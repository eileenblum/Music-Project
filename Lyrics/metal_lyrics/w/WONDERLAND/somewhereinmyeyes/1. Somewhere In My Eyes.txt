[Rubolotta]

Fantasy has come to be
The guide inside of me
In this little room time disappears
Decision faces fear

If you look at me
What do you see
Illusions come so real
I don't want to lose my way

Somewhere in my eyes
Looking into the mirror of desire
Somewhere in my eyes
Looking into the mirror of desire

Mystery inside of me
I wanna wait and and see
In my memory regrets to kill
Images go with speed

If you look at me
What do you see
This burning inside is so real
I don't want to lose my way

Living my time
Trying to leave the past behind
Looking for some place of mind
I will turn to be so blind

Somewhere in my eyes
Looking into the mirror of desire
Somewhere in my eyes
Looking into the mirror of desire

[Solo guitar]

Somewhere in my eyes
Looking into the mirror of desire
Somewhere in my eyes
Looking into the mirror of desire
