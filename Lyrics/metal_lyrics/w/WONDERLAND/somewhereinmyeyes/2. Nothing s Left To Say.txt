[Rubolotta, Torricini]

I feel your worry
I read your mind
Won't be sorry
If you'll stay on your side

I gave you sorrow
You were so kind
I keep on wishing
Please don't dispel your time

My hands are shaking
Eyes full of tears
Know what we're making
I will stay here ten years

I whisper a last word
Hear what I say
The damage is done
You've so many ways to play

Nothing's left to say
Every night and day
Nothing's left to say
Nothing forever

Nothing's left to say
Every night and day
Nothing's left to say
Nothing forever

[Solo guitar]

I feel your worry
I read your mind
Won't be sorry
If you'll stay on your side

I gave you sorrow
You were so kind
I keep on wishing
Please don't dispel your time

My hands are shaking
Eyes full of tears
Know what we're making
I will stay here ten years

I whisper a last word
Hear what I say
The damage is done
You've so many ways to play

Nothing's left to say
Every night and day
Nothing's left to say
Nothing forever

Nothing's left to say
Every night and day
Nothing's left to say
Nothing forever

[Special chorus:]

Nothing's left to say
Every night and day
Nothing's left to say
Nothing forever

Nothing's left to say
Every night and day
Nothing's left to say
Nothing forever

[Instrumental chorus]

Nothing's left to say
Every night and day
Nothing's left to say
Nothing FOREVER
