[A. Torricini, F. Rubulotta]

Searching to find the thread of my life
I come back to the time, I would kill for a knife
And it's time I know to try, to cancel all the crimes
That I've done and I'll make it

All that was kind, I denied in my mind
I decide to repent 'till the end of the time
There's some place you know, where I have to go
And it's hard to decide that I'll make it

No, I don't want to find
Hell at end of my world
I don't want to beg the lord
Oh, never, I took for granted
I would never change trying
To take the control of my life

Here I am, down on my knees
I return to pay my sins
I don't know what it will be
I come back to end my deed
Here I am, down on my knees
I return to pay my sins
I don't know what it will be
I come back to end my deed
