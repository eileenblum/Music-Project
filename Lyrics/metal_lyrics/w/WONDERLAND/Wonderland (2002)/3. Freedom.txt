[A. Torricini, F. Rubulotta]

Free land is in front of me
'Cause I'm driving on the freedom street
Just a free man I decide to be
Keep on running to the sea

Freedom, file it like a wonder
Lot of time to find her
I want to see the world
Freedom, ready for my journey
Fire is still burning
I will see the world

Free wind is passing through my soul
And I follow its recall
And the ocean flows beside my car
With its high waves laps the stars

Freedom, come out from the darkness
Happy for my passage
I just want to see the world
Freedom, I don't want to say
A word I've waitedand prayed
I just want to go

Solo: Vic and Tower, Vic

Freedom, file it like a wonder
Lot of time to find her
I want to see the world
Freedom, ready for my journey
Fire is still burning
I will see the world

Freedom, come out from the darkness
Happy for my passage
I just want to see the world
Freedom, I don't want to say
A word I've waitedand prayed
I just want to go
