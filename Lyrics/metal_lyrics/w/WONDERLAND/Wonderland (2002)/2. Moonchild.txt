[A. Torricini, F. Rubulotta]

Moonchild watch your mother
But your father will not return
Moonchild kissed by moonlight
Show your big smile shine on the world

Sunrise for you David
Wake up in this morning
Lost in the sunlight
Lost in the sky
Sunrise for you David
Stand up from your sorrow
Face up your tomorrow
Lost in the sky

Moonchild say a prayer
When your mother is crying for him
My child don't fear nightmares
I will be there watch over you

Sunrise for you David
Wake up in this morning
Lost in the sunlight
Lost in the sky
Sunrise for you David
Stand up from your sorrow
Face up your tomorrow
Lost in the sky

[Solo: Vic]

Sunrise for you David
Wake up in this morning
Lost in the sunlight
Lost in the sky
Sunrise for you David
Stand up from your sorrow
Face up your tomorrow
Lost in the sky
