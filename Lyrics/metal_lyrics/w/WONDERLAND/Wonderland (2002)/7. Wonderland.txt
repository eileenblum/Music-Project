[A. Torricini, F. Rubulotta]

Talk to me, Tell what you need
I speak the words you want to hear
I've never thought there's nothing good inside us
Walk with me and you will see
The promised land you've never reached
Your time to change the life course has not still ended

Come with me and you will fear
Follow my signs I teach you how
A chance to start again a new revival
Close your eyes and feel it twice
You're close to my heart I show you now
The way you can succeed, I tell the secret

Follow the sign
You will find in my eyes
You are searching the line
You can find in my mind
You can follow the sign
See the shadows of life
Now you're reaching the strand
And you come to the new Wonderland

Come with me and you will fear
Follow my signs I teach you how
A chance to start again a new revival
Close your eyes and feel it twice
You're close to my heart I show you now
The way you can succeed, I tell the secret

Follow the sign
You will find in my eyes
You are searching the line
You can find in my mind
You can follow the sign
See the shadows of life
Now you're reaching the strand
And you come to the new Wonderland

[Solo: Vic]

Follow the sign
You will find in my eyes
You are searching the line
You can find in my mind
You can follow the sign
See the shadows of life
Now you're reaching the strand
And you come to the new Wonderland
