[F. Rubulotta]

Swallow in the sky
See the reflection
I can plan the way to fly
To my destination
While I'm fondled by the sun
With no reaction
Wait for summer in my cell
I learn my direction

Time... I wait my time
Time... It will be mine

Summer waiting
I can leave my cold December
Summer waiting
For the last time to remember
Summer waiting
I can leave my cold December
Summer waiting
I can welcome summer in my heart

A bird is flying high
Beyond the correction
And I'm spending all the night
Foreseeing any action
And the wind is blowing free
It's not my imagination
Now I try to search and see
The real situation

Time... I wait my time
Time... It will be mine

Summer waiting
I can leave my cold December
Summer waiting
For the last time to remember
Summer waiting
I can leave my cold December
Summer waiting
I can welcome summer in my heart

[Solo: Vic]

Summer waiting
I can leave my cold December
Summer waiting
For the last time to remember
Summer waiting
I can leave my cold December
Summer waiting
I can welcome summer in my heart
