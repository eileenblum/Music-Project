We got horns on our helmets
And metal in our blood
We dress ourselves in leather
And we worship pagan gods

We got runes on our weapons
To serve and to protect
And the hammer of the thunder god
Is tied around my neck

We sail through many oceans
We conquer and we kill
Spreading fear across the world
As the wild men from the north

We live to fight in battles
And make legends of our deeds
Our enemies shall tremble
When they kneel to our feet

Now we stand together
Warriors unite
Vikings forever
Fighting side by side

We hail the sons of Odin
Glorious we kneel
Ride with us in battle
We're Norsemen of steel

The earth begins to shake
And the ground breaks apart
As we march through the fire and the flames

Our hearts are filled with glory
And our minds are filled with calm
When we run into the last of battlefields

Embrace
Your death
To die
Is to be free

Attack
With no fear
Glory comes to those who dares

We are Norsemen of steel

Now we stand together
Warriors unite
Vikings forever
Fighting side by side

We hail the sons of Odin
Glorious we kneel
Ride with us in battle
We're Norsemen of steel

Ride
Warriors ride
Ride to defend our pagan land

Fight
Fight for your lives
Victory comes when we defeat them

Now we stand together
Warriors unite
Vikings forever
Fighting side by side

We hail the sons of Odin
Glorious we kneel
Ride with us in battle
We're Norsemen of steel

Now we stand together
Warriors unite
Vikings forever
Fighting side by side

We hail the sons of Odin
Glorious we kneel
Ride with us in battle
We're Norsemen of steel
