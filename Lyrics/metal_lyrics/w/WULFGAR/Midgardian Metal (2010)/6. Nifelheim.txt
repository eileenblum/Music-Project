Cold and dark
The mist reeks of death
An endless landscape of corpses in decay

Sculptures of ice
Deformed beyond reality
Once they were men of flesh and blood

The sense of pain
Will never go away
The cold hurts like fire
It burns inside your veins

Insanity
You stand upon the edge
You jump into the flames
Of ice without a regret

Nifelheim
No mans land
Darkness reigns
This desert of snow

Nifelheim
Frozen heart
Madness lies
Deep Within

Can't take this any more
Can't keep myself together
My mind is ripped apart
My mind is ripped apart

Nifelheim
No mans land
Darkness reigns
This desert of snow

Nifelheim
Frozen heart
Madness lies
Deep Within

Nifelheim
No mans land
Darkness reigns
This desert of snow

Nifelheim
Frozen heart
Madness lies
Deep Within
