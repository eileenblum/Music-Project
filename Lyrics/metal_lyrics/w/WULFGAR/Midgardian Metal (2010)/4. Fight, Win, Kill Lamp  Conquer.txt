Put on your armour
We're setting sail
It's time for battle
And we can not fail

Every land
That we will reach
Shall we divide
With our steel

Take what you can
The world is ours
Consume, harvest
And devour

Spreading fear
Across the lands
Let them feel
The cold winds of the north

Fight, win, kill &amp; conquer

Fight, win, kill &amp; conquer
Fight, win, kill &amp; conquer

Through every wall we shall proceed
Through fire and ice we shall move on
Only death can stand in our way
And if we fall we shall be praised

Fight, win, kill &amp; conquer

Fight, win, kill &amp; conquer
Fight, win, kill &amp; conquer
