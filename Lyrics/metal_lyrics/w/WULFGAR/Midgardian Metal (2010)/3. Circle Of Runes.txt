A fire is put among the stones
A flame to honour our dead
We gather around the magic runes
And paint the stones with blood
Let us summon the gods

In a circle of runes
We stand together
And we call upon you
You mighty gods of war
Lead us to victory
And let the christians fall

In a circle of runes
We stand together
And we call upon you
Odin, Tyr and Thor
Balder, Frey and Freya
Let us win this war

The vala speaks of prophecies
Possessed by a magic force
She's writing signs upon a stone
And then she speaks in tongues
The fate of our ancient lore

In a circle of runes
We stand together
And we call upon you
You mighty gods of war
Lead us to victory
And let the christians fall

In a circle of runes
We stand together
And we call upon you
Odin, Tyr and Thor
Balder, Frey and Freya
Let us win this war

See the markings among the clouds
The rain is burning like flames from above
The moon is falling crushing to the ground
Ash of the world-tree is falling down

In a circle of runes
We stand together
And we call upon you
You mighty gods of war
Lead us to victory
And let the christians fall

In a circle of runes
We stand together
And we call upon you
Odin, Tyr and Thor
Balder, Frey and Freya
Let us win this war
