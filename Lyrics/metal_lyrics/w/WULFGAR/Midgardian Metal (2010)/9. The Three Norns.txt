Children of Mundilfare
Rides across the ancient sky
Day and night
Time just keeps on passing by

By the well of Yggdrasil
They shape the life of men
Setting the fate of all who's born
You can't escape your death

The threads of fate
Determines the life you'll live, the life you will live

Unknown is the future
Unknown is the road we'll travel
Into darkness we struggle
The three norns will guide us till the end

My eyes
Blindfolded by their grace
Spare me the pain
Of knowing

By the well of Yggdrasil
They shape the life of men
Setting the fate of all who's born
You can't escape your death

I watch the moon
Fleeing the jaws of the wolf
We always run
From the jaws of time, from the jaws of time

Unknown is the future
Unknown is the road we'll travel
Into darkness we struggle
The three norns will guide us till the end

Unknown is the future
Unknown is the road we'll travel
Into darkness we struggle
The three norns will guide us till the end
