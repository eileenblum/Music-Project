Our steel
Shall break the chains
We shall break free
Nothing can stand our blades

We are too strong
You are too weak
We are too sharp
Our swords will cut through hardest steel

A mighty storm is coming
Can you hear me roar

A mighty storm is coming
Can you hear me roar

Midgardian metal
Midgardian metal

Hear the thunder
Across the sky
We are the lightning
Striking down until you die

We're sons of Asgard
And kings of earth
Born of the nature
And warriors since our birth

A mighty storm is coming
Can you hear me roar

A mighty storm is coming
Can you hear me roar

A mighty storm is coming
Can you hear me roar

Midgardian metal
Midgardian metal
