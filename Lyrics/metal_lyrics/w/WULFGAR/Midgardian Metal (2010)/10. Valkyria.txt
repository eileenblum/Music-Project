My blood red eyes are filled with hate and burns with fire
I run into the battlefield with nothing but a sword
I spare no blood of all the victims that I kill
Enemy or not, I'll send your souls straight down to Hel

And if I fall by someone's steel
Here I will stand, Valkyria

Brothers have been killed
The years that's passed me by
No woman left at home
To long for me and cry

War is all I know
War is in my blood
In Valhalla my soul belong
Among the pagan gods

Empty inside, my soul is torn
Here I now stand, Valkyria
Empty inside, my soul is torn
Here I now stand, Valkyria

Valkyria [x4]
