Earth shaking
Ground breaking
Rivers of blood

Clouds burning
With lightning
Sky falls with steel

Storms ripping
Winds cutting
Through bleeding worlds

Day withers
Life crumbles
Death brings decay

You fear your hope is lost within
Everything around you is withering
You seek to ease your anguished mind
Blood on your hands all you'll find

The death of Yggdrasil [x4]

Earth dies
The soil is bleeding from within
Mankind
It bites the hand of which it feeds

Earth dies

This is our destiny
Our fate is written in the tree
This is our destiny
Our fate is written in the tree
