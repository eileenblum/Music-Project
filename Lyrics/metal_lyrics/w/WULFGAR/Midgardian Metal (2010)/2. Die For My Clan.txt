When the white rain comes
I will make my father proud
I will spread Odin's wisdom
Glory to the northern horde

Let the quest follow the stars
In the darkened sky
Never be lost at sea
Lost like tears in the rain

At foreign land we stand
With sword in our hand
My mind is set to reign in blood
Or die for my clan

Inside the walls of Odin's hall
We shall be served
As horrid legends we stand tall
And make you fall

We shall forever live on

Few in numbers we emerge
As rage conquers my hardened skin
Their eyes are pale as we storm
Like rivers rush to sea for a place to hide

Remorse means nothing to me
When I travel to my destiny
Listen well to this tale
Of men you shall worship and hail

At foreign land we stand
With sword in our hand
My mind is set to reign in blood
Or die for my clan

Inside the walls of Odin's hall
We shall be served
As horrid legends we stand tall
And make you fall
