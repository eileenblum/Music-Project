Eyes are shut, blinded by serenity
He can sense, the presence of his enemy
Like a beast, he holds his position
Then attacks with sharpest precision

He stands alone
The skin is torn
Just flesh and bone

Through rageous storms he rides
No fear for the other side
No fear to to die

Through endless war he stands
Til death he defends his land
He stands alone

He stands alone
Covered to his knees in blood
The smell of death is pure
He feels just like  a god

No man can tear him down
No man can break apart
His pagan soul is strong
Immortal in his heart
