On the boarder of Muspell
The giant stands guard
With a sword of revenge he awaits
The flames will arise
Once fate have been sealed
And the battle of norsemen engage

Rise from the south
My brothers of stone
Rage into battle to die
In war with the gods
In triumph we'll stand
A new world be born out of war

[Chorus:]
Ravenblack and
Cleansed by fire
A new world
Will rise
Out of the ashes
As dawn reveals
The shattered ground
All will be born
Again
Cleansed by fire

Beyond the horizon
The end is drawing near
As the prophecy once have foretold
The battle commence
At the sound of the horn
The chaos and evil unfold

Watch now, the whole world burns
See how, the world now withers
Watch now, the whole world burns
See how, the world now withers

[Chorus]
