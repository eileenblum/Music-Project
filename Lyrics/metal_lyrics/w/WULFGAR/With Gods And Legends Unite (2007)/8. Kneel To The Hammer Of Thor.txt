A storm is drawing near
The clouds are turning grey
And from across the silver moon
The light begins to fade

And from the dark
Fire soon appears
Burning through the eyes of death
And through the thickened air

Blinded be the ones
Who stares into this light
The striking of the hammer
Consumes the blackend night

He has arrived
Thor, the thundergod
He rides across the winter sky
With lightning in his blood

Hail!
To the hammer of Thor
To the hammer of Thor
We hail!
Kneel!
To the hammer of Thor
To the hammer of Thor
We kneel!
[x2]

Wrath is in his heart
Rage is in his hand
Striking down upon the cross
That ravage through this land

He can't be tamed
He can't be killed
He raise his hammer in the sky
And strikes with burning steel

Rise, rise, let the hammer rise
Burn, burn, let the mountains burn
Fly, fly, through a bloodred sky
Rise, rise, once again you'll rise

Hail!
To the hammer of Thor
To the hammer of Thor
We hail!
Kneel!
To the hammer of Thor
To the hammer of Thor
We kneel!
[x2]

Forever we kneel
