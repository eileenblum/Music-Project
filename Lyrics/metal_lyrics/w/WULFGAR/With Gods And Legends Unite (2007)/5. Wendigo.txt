With swords held high
We march into battlefield
With the gods on our side
Our steel shall break through their shields

And then when they die, we will feed
On their eyes and the souls that we need
To become the strongest there is
We will fight 'till Wendigo is fed

Like a beast, he is lurking
Hungry for flesh
Once he was human
But now he is death
We have to feed
the belly of sin
To conquer the wold
With the strength to win

In a band of blood
We will fight for eternity
In the hall of the gods
We will live in prosperity

And then when our foes have been killed
We will feed until hunger is filled
To become the strongest there is
We will fight 'till Wendigo is fed

Torn by my sword, the enemy is weak
He lies by my feet, like a creep
I feed on his eyes, and I feed on his heart
And all that is he, becomes me

In the grace of my gods
I will drink of their blood
And become all that they were

I will feel what they felt
I will see what they saw
When I eat of the souls that is mine
