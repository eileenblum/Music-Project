Speared with a mistletoe
Pierced right through his heart
The brightest of the gods
Falls lifeless to the ground

HÃ¶dr his brother
Throws down his axe
Cursing the day
He was born

Why can't I see
Why can't I undo
Why did i listen
To the god of betrayal

Balder my brother
Unleash from your fate
Rise from your grave
And return to the gods

Return from Hel

Passing the gates
On a eight-legged horse
Hermod was sent
To the world of the dead

Mistress of the dark
What do you want
In exchange
For Balder the bright

Give me the tears of all mortal beings
Give me the tears for his soul
Give me the tears all that may lie
And of all that may be dead

Cry, you will cry for the sake of his soul
No man shall hold his tears
And if one shall refuse, the god stays with me
Till the end of all nine worlds

Return From Hel

Who shares no tear?
