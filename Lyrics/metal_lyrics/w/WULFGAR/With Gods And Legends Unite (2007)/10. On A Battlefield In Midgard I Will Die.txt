I embrace the rain against my skin
The scars of war, slowly recovering
Soon again the battle will proceed
Another scar, another wound to heal

By the hammer, the thundergod I swear
When I die I shall not die with fear
On a plain beneath the open sky
On a battlefield in Midgard I will die

In my heart I feel it, how it breaths
The spirit of earth, inside of me it weeps
I will fight for the glory of battle
I will die with a sword in my hand

By the hammer, the thundergod I swear
When I die I shall not die with fear
On a plain beneath the open sky
On a battlefield in Midgard I will die

Valkyries come to me
As I die with dignity
Carry my soul away
Into the hall of slain

Valkyries come to me
As I die with dignity
Carry my soul away
Into the hall of slain

By the hammer, the thundergod I swear
When I die I shall not die with fear
On a plain beneath the open sky
On a battlefield in Midgard I will die

By the hammer, the thundergod I swear
When I die I shall not die with fear
On a plain beneath the open sky
On a battlefield in Midgard I will die
