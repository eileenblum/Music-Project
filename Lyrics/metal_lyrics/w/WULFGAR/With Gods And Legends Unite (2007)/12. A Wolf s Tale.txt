[Bonus track]

[Chorus:]
Fenris devour
Odin the great
The legend is told

Vidarr's revenge
For Odin the great
Puts sword through its jaws

When Heimdall's horn is blown and Ragnarok is born
Fenris will rise and devour the great
And bleed from the jaws, the river of rage
When Ragnarok's at hand he will rip the magic chain
Fenris will rise and devour the great Odin himself
And bleed from the jaws, the river of rage

[Chorus]

Gleipnir
Forged to betray
Loke's child
The horrific beast
Magic
Is at hand
Fenris
Misery

[Chorus]
