Deep in the land there is darkness
The thing that is there has conceived

Stephen and James were the first to die
Killed for the way they believed

Judgement day will come and you will bow down
All the dead will rise, the angels will cry

Die Satan Die
Die Satan Die

Pestilence, famine and blood wars
everyone loses there mind
Ripping the flesh off the holy
It's just a matter of time

Die Satan Die
Die Satan Die

Torture so evil and cunning
The devil himself would be proud
Killing the innocent children
Their blood will cry out from the ground

Die Satan Die
Die Satan Die
