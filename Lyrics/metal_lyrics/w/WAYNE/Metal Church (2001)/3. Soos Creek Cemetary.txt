Soos creek cemetary late at night
The tombstones glowed with an eerie light
The moon was full as the fog rolled in
We were sleeping on a shack that was made out of tin
Somethings going on I said to one of my friends
This was a long time ago I mean way back then
I'll never forget what he said to me
With a twisted laugh and a goulish glee

Don't close your eyes or you will die
Theres no place left for you to hide

Don't you know that evil is real
A Presence here that only you can feel
Darkness tries to crush the light
If crippled by fear you will lose the fight

These things in the fog they were evil I could tell
Like laughter from the devil in the bowels of hell
Voices getting louder as they filled my head
And I knew in my heart that we'd soon be dead

Don't close your eyes or you will die
Theres no place left for you to hide

Don't you know that evil is real
A Presence here that only you can feel
Darkness tries to crush the light
If crippled by fear you will lose the fight

Don't close your eyes or you will die
Theres no place left for you to hide

Don't you know that evil is real
A Presence here that only you can feel
Darkness tries to crush the light
If crippled by fear you will lose the fight
