He lived before, He'll live again
His thirst for blood will never end
In a land far away, in a time long ago
In a castle that stood dark and cold

He's flying overhead, his sad wings beat the night
Stronger than a thousand men
but must avoid the light

Break these chains
Drive a stake through my heart
Set me free
Drive a stake through my heart

I am damned, never free, a prisoner of fate
This lust for blood consuming me
as I lay down in my grave

He's flying overhead, his sad wings beat the night
Stronger than a thousand men
but must avoid the light

Break these chains
Drive a stake through my heart
Set me free
Drive a stake through my heart

Across the threshold there is no end
From the grave I rise again

Break these chains
Drive a stake through my heart
Set me free
Drive a stake through my heart
