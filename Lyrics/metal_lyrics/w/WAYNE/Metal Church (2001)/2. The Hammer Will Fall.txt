Vigilante man walks the street at night
Waiting on the dark side of town
His eyes are everywhere, he hears every sound
There ain't nothin' that he doesn't see
It was a desperate situation as the darkness closed in
I felt the sweat trickle down off my chin
When your feeling the pull
ya' gotta fight like a bull
Or everybody's gonna drag ya' on in

Demanding justice the meek seek their revenge
Vanquishing the wicked they have no regrets

The hammer will fall
The blood will make us free
The hammer will fall
The masses will rise again

He knows the difference between right and wrong
He only feeds on the dead
He's got his righteous anger he is known and feared
Death is all that he's got to give

So I hit the floor killing three or four
Shooting bullets fast as I can
Vengeance is mine sayeth the lord
and I'm his right hand man

Demanding justice the meek seek their revenge
Vanquishing the wicked they have no regrets

The hammer will fall
The blood will make us free
The hammer will fall
The masses will rise again
The hammer will fall
The dead will live forever
The hammer will fall
The blind will see again

Shining in his glory the world must repent
Sanctioned by a greater power...
Destruction will rain down on the face of the earth

The hammer will fall
The blood will make us free
The hammer will fall
The masses will rise again
The hammer will fall
The dead will live forever
The hammer will fall
The blind will see again

Demanding justice the meek seek their revenge
Vanquishing the wicked they have no regrets
