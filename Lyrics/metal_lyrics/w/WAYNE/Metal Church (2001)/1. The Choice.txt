You thought that you had the power
You thought you knew the way
Temptation gave you everything
And nothing could take it away

Vanity and pride, now you pay the price
Your legacy remains, the ashes of your life

Love or hate, peace or war
Life or death, the choice is yours

Lies just seem to surround you
Deception you practice each day
Caught in delusions of grandeur
Watching it all fade away

Vanity and pride, now you pay the price
Your legacy remains, the ashes of your life

Love or hate, peace or war
Life or death, the choice was yours

Sold your soul and you turned away
Now there's nothing left for you to say

All your talents are borrowed
But no one will call you a thief
You left a trail of destruction
Sorrow betrayal and grief

Love or hate, peace or war
Life or death, the choice was yours

Sold your soul and you turned away
Now there's nothing left for you to say
Yeah you sold your soul and you turned away
You crossed the line, now it's way too late
