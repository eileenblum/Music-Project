Danger, terror from out in the night
Shadows closing coming for my life
How could this have happened into misery
Locked inside a nightmare and no one has the key

It happened on a Friday
As I lay awake in bed
This spirit in the forest
Racing straight for my head
Blackness - Darkness - Madness
You can't know the fear

Locked inside a nightmare
Locked inside a nightmare

Voices louder ringing in my ears
Thought it was the reaido (things been dead for years)
I can' stand it anymore make it go away
Imagine if you will of knowing you're the prey

Blackness - Darkness - Madness
You don't know the fear

Pain is falling from the sky, you know you must forget
Vile recollections of unholy black regret
Paralyzed you can't move, just breathing is a choice
Impossible to stop, it can slip beneath a door

Locked inside a nightmare...
