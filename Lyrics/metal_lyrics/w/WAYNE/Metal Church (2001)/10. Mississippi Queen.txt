[Mountain cover]

Mississippi queen
You know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

Down around Vicksburg
Down Louisiana Way
Lived a cajun lady
Called the Mississippi queen
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes was a gettin their kicks
Buddy beg your pardon I was gettin mine

Mississippi queen
You know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

This lady asked me if I could be her man
You know I done told her I do what I can
To keep her looking pretty, buy her dresses that shine

While the rest of them dudes was a gettin their kicks
Buddy beg your pardon I was gettin mine

Mississippi queen
You know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

Down around Vicksburg
Down Louisiana Way
Lived a cajun lady
Called the Mississippi queen
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes was a gettin their kicks
Buddy beg your pardon I was gettin mine
