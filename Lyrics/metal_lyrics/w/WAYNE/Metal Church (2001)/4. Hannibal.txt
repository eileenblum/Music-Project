I am one with those I take, their spirits live in me
I watch and wait and I know just when
It's home their gonna be
I am all the afterbirth, the part that no one wants
So strap me in your padded cell
Or I'll eat your body parts

I am a child of our society
Killing the weak makes sense to me
I am becoming - I am becoming

Those of you who think your smart
And try to pick my brain
I'll crawl inside your tiny head, making you insane
So stay at home, don't follow me
Your death would be a shame
Cause when you find the next one dead
You'll know just who to blame

I am a child of our society
Killing the weak makes sense to me
I am becoming - I am becoming

I am a child of our society
Killing the weak makes sense to me
I am becoming - I am becoming
