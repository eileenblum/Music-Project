[Voices, simultaneously]
[Voice 1:]
I will go back to my wild stream
Back to the winter I know
I'm all alone
Back to the wolves in their forest
Where I was once home
I stake my journey on that they'll welcome me back
I'm tired of waiting 'til they'll bring me home

[Voice 2:]
Then I'm tired of this, I've had enough
I'm lying down in my home
But I'm ever awake
For another journey

[Voice 3:]
You can't wait, you're on your own, riding alone
Along with your moon and sun and fire

I yearn for your spirals in thy forest
The moon is high above the murmuring trees of the forest
My heartbeat dances with the sun
The shores of the shining river
Have arisen in the distance
The forest fauna trembles
Prey of kings and lords of men
I'll guard the palaces of my life
Therein lies a forlorn nomad:
A child who wears a loincloth

The river seems to flow
Far into our forest
And rushes to the side
Of the pounding in my head
It's so pretty
I just rest

My blood stands still
I am shown a terrible flood

[Voices, simultaneously]
[Voice 1:]
We go home tonight
The fires are ruining our homeland
No, no, no, not right now
The sight of this
Wherever I go for shelter, somehow it burns

[Voice 2:]
We don't know who made the fires,
The fires burning all that we know
And I scream, what is there all to do,
To determine who did this. Can you face the flames?

[Voice 3:]
Go and don't look behind you
What did you do to all of our homes?
Go where home is
Then it will be you in the night
Say goodbye

[Voice 4:]
The fires don't seem to be retreating.
The children will be left behind when you go,
Wanting you to live for them.
But I see now how you couldn't survive
Staying here in your home.
Go now and please stay away from this place,
We are guarding our treasure

[Voice 5:]
Who do you want?
Take a look around and you'll see
For I always seem to be around, helping you to face the fires
I used to know you. Haven't you noticed that I've been helping you to face the fires
And I have a feeling that it was you who made the fires
And in my tears of blood I declare that...

We wash away
Wash it all away
Beckon winter
Follow me
To where our children drink
The purified well they know
Harvesting, plentiful of joy
I know we are back in, back in our home,
And our future, I see it
In our wonderful forest I know
I know...

I hope some day in this space I will hear him
His voice one of wisdom and the wolves

[Repeated:]
Everybody in your hands, go back to home and tell of what you see here.
Go to your hidden secret place, does anyone know where you go for help?
They think you're immortalized

The...
(He comes from the throne...)
Slaughter
(To reclaim his throne)
Of an entire...
(Something isn't right)
(Where have you been? We've looked for you)
Cruel winter
(The fires burn through. Something's wrong)
In this sanctuary above
(Is there's nothing you can do?)
Our killers have set fire to the wolves' dwelling
(You are in danger that way)
It's scented...
(Go no longer through in my realm like a king)
As the first morning...
(He is afraid)
Into our forest
As the hunters

I know I am prey
I know I have not long

As you go moving in our realm of the trees do not fear us, as you go through.
When you go, bring the spells, and no longer appear here as we appear

I chose who my better hero was
(Look to the moon and see)
Above the lost stones the fire glows

Just read the lost stones.
In my realm, behind the trees we can't help you.
I see, through water, through fire I see everything.

I'll rest and scream and wash away
I spit on my fifty years in my throne alone
I'll step down and lower
My soon-to-fall useless crown
I still cry for your help
