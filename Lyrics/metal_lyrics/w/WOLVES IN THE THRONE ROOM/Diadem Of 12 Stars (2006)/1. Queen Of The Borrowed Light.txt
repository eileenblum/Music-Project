If I, if I travel out one day
And there you are, staring back at me
Your gaze lowers
And now turns, and looks onward
You fly upon wings of your own creation
I see the light of the night sky in your eyes

I ask for the gift of your fire
Don't hope that I were one of us were I to die
I know the way of the one who howls
In the darkness of the night
Where no longer am I afraid
Regardless

We'll fly upon wings of your own creation
I see the light of the night sky in your eyes

I...
(You're so late, they're already stricken)
I know we are alone
(They are beyond hope. The end of all our scriptures)
There is nothing left
(Where is flora?)
Where is fauna?
(Go to wage war, to slay and smite, it's this way)
The scriptures, the horizon
(There is darkness coming to the land)
Darkness travels nearer
(You go in celebration)
Or in sadness, they try to capitalize
(In your own yearning for the throne)
Precious power, braving the forests
(Where I come to leverage the stones, before the flame engulfs our forest)
We'll fly upon wings of your own creation
I see the light of the night sky in your eyes

I'm happy wherever I can see your eyes

To where we will be entombed on hallowed ground
Blinded, suffering, silent
Toward the bitter winter
On our way, hallowed days, ever riding
