You point a shattered mirror at the world
And mock those who dare to look
But you most of all are afraid
Of what you might see in the glass
Your fire once shined bright in the distance
The light in your eyes
Could have drawn poison from a wound
Your banner once fluttered in the mountain breeze
Red, gold, and silver but little color remains

I will still serve and love you
For your intention is as pure as it was
But your wounds are soaking through
The rivers will flow with your blood
And the crows will sing your name
As they build their winter nests
With your hair, bones and teeth

The wind will serve her emperor
And bring forth a cleansing storm
To wash it all away

Trilliums grow from the charred flesh of the old world
Broken glass, rusted metal
Brambles will draw the blood
Of all those who walk these lands

You point a shattered mirror at the world
And mock those who dare to look
But you most of all are afraid
Of what you might see in the glass

My thoughts slowly turn to the past
And her amethyst light
In the dark my shadow will stifle the light
And I will stay here in this labyrinth
