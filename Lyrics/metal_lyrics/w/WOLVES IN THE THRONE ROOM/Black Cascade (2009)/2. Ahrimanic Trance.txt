On this night
The light of the ancient world shines bright
Blessing the dark children of the valley
By this gold brilliance they are cleansed
The dog and the wolf howl as one

The twisted village cries out
With one voice
They scream at the heavens
With disdain and wonder
As the beasts rise
From beneath the waves

They come to tear flesh from bone
Love and sadness
Manifest both celebration and funeral
The moon rests within the river
Here in the valley of dust
Pale faces offer their invitations
And the shadow beings answer
Within the sixteenth encampment
Desolation and ecstasy reigns
Under a blood red moon
They mourn those taken away
In the cold grass they lay
Under a blood red moon they weep

The beasts will rise up
From the deep
And look you all in the eye
Behold the royal procession of tears
