As darkness falls
And the spirits of the night descend
Upon our kingdom of wolves
The great ravine vibrates
With a nocturnal energy
As the bat and the owl begin to stir

They drink deep
From the moonlight nectar
That wells up from the earth
And drips down from the night sky
As the stars sing in perfection
As salt and freshwater mix
The forest comes alive

Within this beauty
My mind turns to the past
All that has been built and destroyed
The fire that shined bright
Smolders in the twilight

I can still hear her voice
Dripping with venomous sorrow
I'll carry her amethyst light
Through this labyrinth
