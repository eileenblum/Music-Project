but you could grasp it if it were to show you its eyes
your longing like every stranger you see

did you feel left behind was the time too quick for you? do you

dreams of the pure white pillows, mother...
hate through creation love through creation
all colors vibrant and new

Black Tea
I've been swallowing swards for so many years now cold metal against my throat day
after day my swollen tonsil are my reality organs turn black to awaken is to feel sick to be
possessed by anxiety my sole is stretched thin X2 The arrow points do not puncture my
organs they have been slowly dulled by my stomach acids and bile when I drink the black
tea that is my remedy my cure the unclean existence of metal becomes clear now with
every passing moment organs turned black to awaken is to feel sick to be possessed by
anxiety my soles stretched thin
