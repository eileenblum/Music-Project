this foe seems far beyond all of us you and i he devours the fuel our fires you grip
hilts of ruin your majesties will rot away today are claws are sheathed in your flesh
they stole crystals from the mountain core vengeance is what the spirits of the valley
crave hands talons and paws are hanging in their bed chamber one by one we climb the
walls pale guards we slit their throats royal courtiers gape with fear blue black blood
pumping sallow adrenalin they stole the crystals from the mountain core vengeance is
what the spirits of the valley crave hands talons and paws are hanging in their bed
chamber usurp the tyrants rip their thrones to splinters and dust tear their alters down
dethrone the tyrants shatter their bones and devour the marrow tear their alters down
One by one we climb the walls the pale guards we slit their throats royal courtiers gape
with fear blue black blood pumping sallow adrenalin.

The shadows cast by the forest of my mind can black out their world let our darkness
spread let our dreams manifest the shadows cast by the forest of my mind fall upon their 
ruin.
