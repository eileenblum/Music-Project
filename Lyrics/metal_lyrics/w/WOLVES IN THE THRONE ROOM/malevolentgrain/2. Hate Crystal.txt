I burn flesh one more time
And pray for his footsteps
To have turned around

I wash the sickness out
From its place in your eyes, in your face
For it's not all behind us
My breathing's shallow
With that torch I ensure a fever as I lay

In the night the fastest-killing evil has slowly turned the water red
Hidden in the footsteps around the well
The smallest drop can kill a child in an instant
The age of innocence

Blessed be above our great skies
Eating up the strength of my vengeance
(Eating up the strength of my vengeance)
The sky of the deep rapture while I sleep

If they die depends
How ready I am for the day I'm going
In that forest lake beyond the watchful eyes of those who've taken our beloveds
