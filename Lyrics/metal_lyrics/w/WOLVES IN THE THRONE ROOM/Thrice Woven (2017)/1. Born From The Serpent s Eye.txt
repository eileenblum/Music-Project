Lend me your falcon skin
Sky traveler
Eyes turned upwards
Red eggs spill
Warships circle
Copper shields bedeck
Across the green meadows
Over the river teeming with spears
To the lake of stone
Where nothing lives and nothing grows
The many worlds below
Ungulate with memory and sadness
Through fathoms of green gilt enfolding

Sanden glider ifrÃ¥n mina hÃ¤nder
Jag tar ett andetag
Se pÃ¥ den stjÃ¤rnan
Se pÃ¥ det ljuset
Se pÃ¥ mitt hjÃ¤rta, kallt och mÃ¶rkt
Bort frÃ¥n allt ljus, sÃ¶ker sig vattnet
In i ett djup, ut i ett hav [3x]

[English translation:
"The sand flows from my hands
I take a breath
Look at that star
Look at that light
Look at my heart, cold and dark
Away from all light, meanders the water
Into a deep, out into an ocean"]

Noose tightens, hammer falls
Thunderheads mount the shore
Drenching twin rivers
Born from the serpentâs eye
