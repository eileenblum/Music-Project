The torment has ended
The beast has done his work
Great fires rage outside of this wooded sanctuary

But soon they will be quenched by a purifying rain
The embers of the ceremonial fire burn to ash
A new warmth stirs within the center of the earth
I am alone here no more

The wood is filled with the sounds of wildness
The songs of birds fill the forest on this new morning
This will be my new home
Deep within the most sacred grove
The sun god is born anew

I will lay down my bones among the rocks and roots of the deepest hollow next to the streambed
The quiet hum of the earth's dreaming is my new song

When I awake, the world will be born anew
