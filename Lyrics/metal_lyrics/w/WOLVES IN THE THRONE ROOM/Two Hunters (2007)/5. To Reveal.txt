[Bonus Track](The moon shines) [repeated]
(Look at the moon)
(Look at those whose hands are broken) [repeated]
He runs away, he runs away, he runs away, he runs away
(The moon shines) [repeated]
He runs away into the dark, looks into his prey's eyes in panic
The potion's wild power never tamed
A warning of a betrayal

Hurry up to our realm
Hurry up

When my potion is ready, the potion that he awaits
Return to the forest, before the lord of the wood comes back

Bright and early and tired of hunting for their own bellies
They will gorge on the kill, having slayed it with fire
For the hunt was an instant capital offense
For in the forest they had killed a creature that had been rejoicing

Wherever they are they will have karma
And for their punishment they should hang
That's what they deserve
They will be hung soon
Their widows, they are by themselves forever

Now that I fear becoming tired, or of hanging,
For the time I'd rather keep quiet

He is poised and ready
Throwing an animal into water
It will drown in its own blood

In homage to a great foe, he takes his bow
He will kill in the once-green wilderness
For the lord's harvest


Thanks to tcohn for sending track #5 lyrics.
