Die without restraint.
Lungs collapse form the tension.
Hearts plugged from potentially vile veins laced with inane.
Blood that coagulates inside us all.
Capture the plague.
Capture the fever.
Sit in your coffin and rot for the season.
Capture the plague.
Capture the fever.
now I have seen the extent of a life that remains a constant uphill battle with no chance of recovery.
And now you know what infection tastes like.
Cut through your ego like this knife left dull from all the times you have reveled in stupidity.
There is no pill to purify.
There is no way to build an antidote.
All I can see is your stupidity.
So I guess your out in the end.
The parasite flows through the veins.
Burning flowing through the veins.
Covered face to save civilization.
Form a lepers touch to hold his dignity.
And now you know what infection tastes like.
Cutting through your ego like this knife left dull from all the times you reveled in your stupidity.
