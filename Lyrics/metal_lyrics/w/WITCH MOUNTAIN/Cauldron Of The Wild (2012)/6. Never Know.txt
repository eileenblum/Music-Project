I never know if you're dead
Maybe you are...at the bottom of the ocean in the back of a car
On a dirty bed in a crumbling room...
Oh baby what's your room?
Don't know if you're dead but I like it that way
Cause you know if I knew don't know what I'd do

You were in the bathroom on your hands and knees
Your eyes empty sockets your howling ghostly
Something wet spreading my insides were sinking
You took too much honey what were you thinking?
Don't know if you're dead but I like it that way
Cause you know if I knew don't know what I'd do

Will you do lots of bad things baby
But about those I don't think twice
Far as I'm concerned from waht I've learned
Being far from me is your only vice
Don't know if you're dead but I like it that way
Cuz you know if I knew don't know what I'd do

If you had to go then why did you not leave my heart behind?

It dies a little baby every time I think you're gone
Every time I get it in my head that something's going wrong
I think that this will finally be the time your luck runs out
And I'll be left wondering what this love was all about...
Don't know if you're dead but I like it that way
Cause you know if I knew don't know what I'd do

It don't matter where you go
To the highest or the lowest low
Cause I'm gonna find you
And we'll be home
