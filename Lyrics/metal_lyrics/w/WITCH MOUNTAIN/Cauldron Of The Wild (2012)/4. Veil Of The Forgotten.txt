What is the best way to offer it up in a cup or a bowl?
As Long as it's gold
Faces all over the walls peering in on the goings on

We will win with patience, cold in the stone
Gold Jade and blood, amethyst and bone

Watching for trembling and openings in careless gestures
No teeth sink deeper than teeth of time so we just watch it fester
Truly, What else do we hold?
A poverty of souls terrified and blood-soaked

We will win with patience, cold in the stone
Gold Jade and blood, amethyst and bone

Where did you think you'd end up?
And what are you to know?

You're friendless but worshiped
Threatening through the veil of the forgotten
Crumbling away,
Decay is covering the trail of the forgotten
friendless but worshiped threatening
Through the veil of the forgotten
Crumbling away,
Decay is covering the trail of the forgotten

...Slow surrender...

We will win with patience, cold in the stone
Cold jade and blood, amethyst and bone

Remember
