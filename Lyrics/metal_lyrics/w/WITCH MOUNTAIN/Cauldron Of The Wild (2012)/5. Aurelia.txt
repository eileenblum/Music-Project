You were mine
Remember the time?
The air smelled more like cinnamon
And pine

For a laugh
I kept the head of that rat
You kept my heard in that ratty old box
The kind that won't lock

With a knife in her hand
She was trying to stand
But with both feet bound
And no one around...

Oh Aurelia

My hair fell out after
I heard her laughter
She was crawling slowly
Calling out for Crowley

Oh Aurelia

I'll always remember 
That long september
Blood on the stairs
The whole family was there

Oh Aurelia

There's no way outta here so just stay outta here
You don't talk in this town you don't walk in this town you just run run run
Keep your eyes on the ground you don't look in this town you run run run
And deny you'll never be done

You'll get sick around here
And it'll stick around here so just run run run
Things rot quick around here
So don't stick around here just run run run
Oh you'll never be done

My Aurelia goodbye Aurelia
