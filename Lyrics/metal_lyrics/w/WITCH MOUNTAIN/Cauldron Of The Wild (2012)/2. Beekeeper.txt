Grow grow overflow gears will grind and steps will slow
Smoke smoke smells of oak pushed so hard it finally broke go
Fell fell fetid smell something rotting in its shell
Heal heal how you fell will determine what is real

Beekeeper beekeeper where where we leading to?
Why did so many go when they did not have to?

[Chorus]
Worm-eaten parasite acquisition
Paralytic poisonous superstition
The cycle of dominance and submission

Go go sink down low we will say we did not know
Rest rest acquiesce enter the endlessness

[Chorus]
