I move along a rubble strewn road
Shells of burnt out enclosures spell a cracked code:
Open to the air at last to breathe &amp; fill as a cup of with rain
Then flow to release holes of relief

The citadel is finally in shards
It's gliterring shrapnel spead afar
Piercing the masses weeping fom teargazes
With a cold clean break an icy shatter it passes

I hope that I can find shelter before
Fewer ferries me to the far shore
I hope that I can find shelter before
I realize I can't recognize me anymore

Those who are seeking searching shrieking
For clean air to tear off those rooftops
A fiery secret for the dissatisfied the malcontent and the wise
Undisclosed to the overexposed is that nobody knows
Expose the throat to electric liquors
Caloric elixirs that build up the light
Till the brain fills up hemorrhages and flickers

I hope that I can find shelter before
Fewer ferries me to the far shore
I hope that I can find shelter before
I realize I can't recognize me anymore

I hope that we can find shelter before
Fewer ferries us to the far shore
I hope that we can find shelter before
We realize we can't recognize ourselves anymore

When the stars begin to tumble downward
And the earth is consumed by dust and war
I will go and I will not look backward
For there will be nothing to look for

I will not be waiting for a sign
I will drive into the setting sun
I may run dry of break down for the last time
But I won't stop till I reach the ocean

Cast off your cloak of failure

Eden in the aftermath

I will not be waiting for a sign
I will drive into the setting sun
I may run dry of break down for the last time
But I won't stop till I reach the ocean
