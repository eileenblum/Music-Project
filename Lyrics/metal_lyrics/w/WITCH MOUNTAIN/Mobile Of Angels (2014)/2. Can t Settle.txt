I tell you that it's real, 'cause I feel it deep down in me It's growing like a cancer, it's growing like Rosemary's baby It's got me actin' strange and it's got me feelin' crazy I can't sleep or I'll dream and that's makes me scream 

Like the scum that grows on stagnant water Like the smell of roadkill as the street is getting hotter I'm a rotter When I stay still I get ill 

One more day
I'm tellin' you that's all I'll stay
But I got my leg caught in a trap
And it's keeping me from getting away 

When I stay still I get ill
If I don't rise, if I don't fly out of the mine, I will expire You can be sure There's just one cure 

LIMB, LIMB, GIVE IN, GIVE IN LIMBS GIVE IN WHY TRY, ALL LIES, ALL LIES, WHY TRY WHY TRY, LIMBS GIVE IN TO ALL THE LIES LIMBS GIVE IN 

I'm gettin' the hell outta here
Gonna hit the road so hard
That it goes and crumbleds all behind me Leaving me no choice but to go far, far, far, far

Gatherin' rust, gatherin' dust, feeling so old, old, old Growin' dump, growin' numb, feeling so cold, cold, cold It's time to go Feelin' time creep by, makin' me slow, slow, slow Gotta run, ain't done growing' up Maybe I'll never stop 

I'm turnin' on my heart
An I'm turnin' off my mind
Gonna catch the first ride goin' outta here, yeah The very first thing that I find, find, find, find 

I'll hunt, I want what I don't know, know, know I'll be all me from head to toe It's time to go When you let things get past their prime, prime, prime You get regret and waste time, time, time Precious time, what a crime 

I'm saying goodbye, wasting no time living a lie
