I don't think you're aware of how false you appear, how your smile looks so thin
You've done it again, your corrupt ways sour the hymn
I think you believe it's your role to make the world better under your control
So it's harder to be bitter when, once again, your corrupt ways sour the hymn

I see it now so clearly, your benevolent tyranny, how you sugar coat each bitter pill
But it's not so much your ways but that I'm still here today that makes me feel so ill

It's now one's fault but those who follow when they know exactly where you're leading them
And that time and time again your corrupt ways sour the hymn
Because I know when I try to make a thing of pure intention, that thing you do is gonna get done
You'll do it again, you'll do it again

You're happy and I don't blame you infact I wish I was so sure that I was right
But I'm afraid our differences we cannot reconcile
I'll wish you all of the best as I walk away and relish
The sweet relief that I'll feel
Then I finally put my heels down

You say you'll fix me, you'll mold me in your image
And I say, like hell you will
you say you'll show me just what perfection is
And I say perfection kills
You say I couldn't possibly get it
And I say the same 'bout you
Can't wait for the day I hear you admit it
I was right about you

Sour!
