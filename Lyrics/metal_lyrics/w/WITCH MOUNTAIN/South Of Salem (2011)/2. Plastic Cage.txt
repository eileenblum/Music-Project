"Where have you been all this time?" said the grown to the child
"I've been right here all along making your life all wrong
Anytime you don't know what to do I decide for you."
Grown one cried, "I thought you died before you grew."

Sp this is the divide that's been plaguing me
One side wants to feel high, the other side complete
Can't you see that this just isn't working anymore
Can't you see that your judgments are killing us both?

Fading in and out of me with no help at all from reality
Fading in and out of me with no help at all from sanity
Our separate paths lead us to the same morass fast
You can't hurt me anymore
You're in my head
You're in the past
