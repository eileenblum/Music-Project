See the children staring at the ceiling
Who knew?

See them tied up and shackled to their spaces
For you?

You keep on saying these things are non-existent
You want hard not to believe
You keep living your life with no regrets and
Just wipe the blood off on your sleeve

These things they do exist now
Laid out for all to see
The blood, the pain, the suffering
Laid out for all to see

Seize the light!

So we end up back at the beginning
Nothing lost, nothing left to see
Just keep on saying these things are non-existent
Wipe the blood on someone else's sleeve

Well I don't claim to know what is right from what's wrong
Or that I know what's true
There's a fight, there's a war going on
Come along with us and sing our song

There are kids being shot, tanks running hot
They'll drop the bombs they wanna show what they've got
It's a greed reeking system and it's got to be stopped
May be too late for us, but it's not too late for you

Take a look around and say what you see
Rubbing up on all of life's luxury
This kind of kind of pain won't get very deep

Well there's kids being shot, tanks running hot
They'll drop the bombs they wanna show what they've got
It's a greed reeking system and it's got to be stopped
May be too late for us, but it's not too late for you

Well you know what you need, you take it and leave
You trample everything gets under your feet
Now you're gonna get knocked down and left there to bleed
It's not too late for us, but it is too late for you
