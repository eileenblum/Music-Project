There's something strange in the west
That's got me thinking about south sugar

Since the beginning there's always been
That fascinations
Love for obscene: South Sugar

Newspapers stand so tall
Care for what you reach and beyond you just ignore
I don't think that I can take anymore of that south sugar

Care for what you reach and beyond you just ignore south sugar
I don't think that I can take anymore of that south sugar
