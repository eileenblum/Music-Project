Losing faith to your religion
Who's to save?
Disappear until you stop living
What a shame

Seems you got mixed up with the victims
Wrong forte
Life it seems has it's fair system
Of what remains

Where have all the people traveled?
And why have some stayed?
There got to be a better way somehow
Not today

Sliding off of the wing of the Lord
Leaning on His faith all along
Reaching for the stars up above
Nothing seems to ever add up

So I bid you all farewell
Prepare for what's to come
I hate to say it, but all is not well
That is all for now

So you say you see a better way
You see I don't
It lies out there beyond the outer seas
Of a world I don't yet know

Sliding off of the wings of the Lord
Leaning on His faith all alone
Reaching up for the stars above
Nothing adds up
