I walked the moonlight mile with you
Stood by, laughed, loved, and kissed you
You did the same right back to me
Took my hand and you set me free

Suddenly the train came to a halt
Don't give a fuck why, when, or who's fault
Getting straight to the point you see
'Cause we both just can't agree

I'm willing to take on all the blame
Doesn't seem to change a thing
My heart's full of needles and pins
Gonna hurt myself again

I'm not the type to just give up
Would rather just fuck than make up
You cast your shadow in the pouring rain
Dry up my heartfelt pain

Didn't think it would end this way
One decade gone, one new day
And all I've got left to say is
Goodbye

I'm willing to take on all the blame
Doesn't seem to change a fucking thing
My heart's full of needles and pins
Gonna hurt myself again
