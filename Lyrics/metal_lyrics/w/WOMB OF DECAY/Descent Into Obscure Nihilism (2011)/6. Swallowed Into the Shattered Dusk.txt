Depth is not far, descent is short
life under zero level 
insensitive human form
Crack sounds spiral of noises
Absorbing all planet energy
Non-physical forms of chaos
Above the inferior human life
Monumental collapse, evaporating slowly
Defining the Virtual trance
reincarnating the inner ego
center of the cosmos
endless boundaries of inner god
astral cycle of death and rebirth
reborn of the consumed flesh
lost essential dignity
nonhuman birth
Chapter in collapsed existence
Chamber of blackened Silence falls
suicidal depression under winter hypnosis 
Descending to eternal obscurity
uneartly magnetic vacuum transforms to soulless existence
