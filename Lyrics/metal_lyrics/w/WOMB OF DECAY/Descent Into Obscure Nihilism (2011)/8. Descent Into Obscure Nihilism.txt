Agnostic morbid beliefS
scattered moral values are abstractly contrived
Assert that morality does not inherently exist
Mood of despair at a perceived pointlessness of existence
nihilistic epoch of mental plague
decaying aspects of modernity represent a rejection of theism
emptying the world of human existence 
nothing has meaning
The complete destruction of all meaning and all values
tantamount to suicide and mass-murder
diving into the silent meaninglessness
dissolution leads beyond skepticism to a distrust of all meaning
confidence to pessimistic philosophy
our existence has no meaning
ultimate departure
will to nothingness
life turns away from itself
sign of strength
a willful destruction of the old values
self-dissolution of humanity
