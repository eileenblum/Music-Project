Drowned into deepness of Abstract life
unforeseen daylight at the end corridors of life tunnel
suffocating atmosphere of inner cosmos
collapsing neurosis 
detestation overflow
nausea to worthless mankind
rejection and ignorence to  normal life
absorbing life energy
exhausted morbid dilemma and world of depressivity
lonely isolation to outer world
eternal cold misantrophy
mental dissappear
exit from life
horizons of grey mourning 
autumn despair falls on shades of twilight
awakening into own funeral mist
reach the faded afterlife
