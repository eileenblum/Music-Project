an eternal black hole
negative energy density
quantum foam hypothesis 
open by a negative-mass cosmic string
cosmic inflation radiation stroms
unequally connected with mass analysis of electromagnetic field energy
quasipermanent intra-universe wormhole
bridge of depthless different universes
melting universe becomes invisible in the center of the schwarzschild wormhole
light that has fallen into the black hole has no mean
maximally extended end time
creation of  the early universe
violation of the averaged null energy condition
deadly radiation waves spreads
disperse after traveling through the wormhole
total black point mood
abstract aspects of lÄ±feless lÄ±fe
eternal solÄ±tude  grey of desperate falling
