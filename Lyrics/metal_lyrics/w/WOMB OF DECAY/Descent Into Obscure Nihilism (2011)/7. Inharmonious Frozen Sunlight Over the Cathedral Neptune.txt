infinite persecution of Solar System.
swallowed hemisphere possessed a Great Dark Spot
torned into dust molecular outer atmosphere 
absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane
remains obscure illumination
home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide
interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field
deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust
frozen morbid equinox
hallucinating view of the cathedral neptune
