enslaved between dimensions
captured lifelong into the humid cosmic dungeons
dead remains devoured by blinded rats
rotting in depths of obscure caves
restless suffering enearthly existence
dissolving faces of pestilence
horrid layers of tartatus
downfall of withered inheritance 
vanished bodies through devilish paths
life sentenced  desease and depressions
continuous neurotic traumas
drowned into lifeless swamps of hellhole
life is faded away through dead-end of the unknown ancient earth
total darkness consumed the pitch blackened nightfall
