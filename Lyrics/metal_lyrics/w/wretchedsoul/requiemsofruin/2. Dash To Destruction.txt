A Ghostly braying haunts my dreams in nightmares neighing from the dark.
A prisoner woken into screams on deathâs cold journey I've embarked
The sky was dim and grey and dull an icy mist around me lulled.
My captors dragged me down the track and strapped me to a horseâs back.
Lashed tightly to that angry steed whose rage was like an open war,
Unwilling to repent my deed my curse upon them evermore was lost beneath their laughterâs roar.
I swore that they would rue the day when I became a cuckoldâs prey

The courserâs wild career was freed we hurtled forth with reckless speed
wrecked haplessly through blackness, sent to faster reach destructionâs end.
We charged for many days and nights away! We charged toward the light
Of blood-red dawn, where heavens bled and birds of prey upon me fed.

Struggling hard against my bonds the beast of burden hurtled on.
My reeling brain was ringing sore my tethered limbs were wet with gore
And as I braced the noonday sky with sun-baked lips burned black and dry,
A rasping throat that couldn't cry and one last wish: my dying sigh
The splendour of his mighty mane was marred by sweat and blood and pain.
His homelandâs fields were reached with pride He snorted, reeled, he fell and died.
