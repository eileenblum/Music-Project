Many thousand good-nights my dearly beloved for never will I see you more.
This thought is greater torture than any soul hath bore by God's sweet grace, or ancient lore
Innocent I've arrived innocent must die none have yet survived the death-inducing lie
The Priest is barred from my dark cell even though I knew him well
Before I was forced to confess to witchery under duress.
My pleading, bone-whipped cries have chilled the grievous guards enough
To aid these shattered hands to scribe and tell you of my love.

Promises of death's release seep like sweet, seductive speech weary with the agony.
Six names said; stripped and bled mourning half a dozen dead.
Theyâll immolate a traitor forced to sin and throw the wretched ashes to the wind.
My part on this world's stage is done I played it well for one so young
Dwell not on my sufferings I bore them for you.
Forced to confess avowing to witchery under duress.
Avowing to treachery Veronica, my sweet Veronica
