Running from your life there's no escape
Emptiness and anguish fill this never ending void
Condemned to a brutal place, adapting to survive
All you know is left behind, your shadow lost in time

The pleasure in the pain
The glory of the insane

Retribution
Retribution

Sorrow and pity scar the mind
Anger and hatred only amplify the pain
Devastated, losing all you own
On the edge you contemplate, naked and alone

The pleasure in the pain
The glory of the insane

Endless torture, hatred fills my veins
Demanding recognition, justice will be claimed

The pleasure in the pain
The glory of the insane

Running from your life there's no escape
Vengeance burns inside, tearing at my soul

Retribution
Retribution
Retribution
Retribution
