Sail across the heavens, the cross of the divine
Document the ages and leave them all behind
Searching for the meaning, the ashes turn to clay
The silence must be broken, those who know do not say

As we climb the temples of time
The illusion of a mystery untold
Paralyzed, face to face with the signs
The pieces of the puzzle are found inside

The Endless Beginning
See the future in the past
The gates of truth are opened
And the walls of time collapse

Casting distant shadows, a cold eternal gaze
The message in the matter, an ancient twisted maze
Caught between the pages, shining in the light
The purpose is the meaning, the reason for the fight

As we climb the temples of time
The illusion of a mystery unfolds
Paralyzed, face to face with the signs
The pieces of the puzzle are deep inside

The Endless Beginning
See the future in the past
The gates of truth are opened
And the walls of time collapse

On the edge of the horizon, in the circle of the earth
The dynasty of kingdoms and kings
Rest inside the chamber, in the place of destinies
The eyes of eternity

The Endless Beginning, the cross of the divine
The silence must be broken, the truth can be found if you open your mind

Dare to watch as the legends unwind
Secrets and visions come true
Lost to the earth and never to find
The answer to the question is bound by 

The Endless Beginning
See the future in the past
The gates of truth are opened
And the walls of time collapse

The Endless Beginning
See the future in the past
The gates of truth are opened
And the walls of time collapse
