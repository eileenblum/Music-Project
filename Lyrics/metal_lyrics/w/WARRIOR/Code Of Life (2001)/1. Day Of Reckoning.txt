Like a message in a wicked dream, disaster comes from afar
In a vision like you've never seen, the prophet wears the scar
The sun will turn into darkness and the moon will be covered in blood
Day of disaster is coming and it won't be too long

The armies gather on the desert plain
In the Valley of the Kings
Waging war in the Neverland
On the Day of Reckoning

Woe to the nations of idols, shedding innocent blood
Where will you run in your time of need, when the wrath will fill your cup?
The stars are no longer shining, you better prepare to fight
Fire from heaven is raining and there's no where to hide

The armies gather on the desert plain
In the Valley of the Kings
Waging war in the Neverland
On the Day of Reckoning

Nothing left will remain but the captives and the slain

In the last of the days between fire and grace
Don't you know that the mountain will rise?

Like a message in a wicked dream, disaster comes from afar
In a vision like you've never seen, the prophet wears a scar
In Mysteries of Babylon, distress, desolation and waste
The prophecy has come and gone, is the warning too late?

The armies gather on the desert plain
In the Valley of the Kings
Waging war in the Neverland
On the Day of Reckoning
