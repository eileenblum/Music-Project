We have ignored all the signs
Humanity has lost its way
The power is within us to turn back the tide
And liberate ourselves if we can unite
This is the war that we must fight!

The old way is dead; the past must be left behind
We can never be the same again
A new life begins, no more lies to hold us down
We will be free when we can see we hold the key

Reach for the light, children of the sun
And open your eyes revolution has begun
Reach for the light, children of the sun
It's our battle cry - we are one!

Ten thousand years of war and tears, a legacy of fear
Killing in the name of God never asking why
Can we rise above the lies, can we break the chains
The flame that burns inside will show us the way

Reach for the light, children of the sun
And open your eyes, now is the time
Reach for the light, children of the sun
It's our battle cry - we are one!

We are one!

We can never look back
We must never be enslaved again

Reach for the light, children of the sun
And open your eyes, we must believe
Reach for the light, children of the sun
The time is now - we must unite!

We are one!
We are one!
