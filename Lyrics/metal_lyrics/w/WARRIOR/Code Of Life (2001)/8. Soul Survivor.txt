Calling out to Earth
I know something is terribly wrong
No contact, no transmission
No signs of life to tell me what's going on

Washed upon the shore
I'm staring across the wasteland
Dark skies, eerie silence
Am I the only one left alive?

Am I the Soul Survivor?
Soul Survivor

Thoughts are racing through my mind
Is this the same planet that I left behind?
What we all feared has happened here
Or have I returned at another point in time?

I feel so all alone
So distant from the human race
Unable to cope, can't hear me scream
Just a shell of a man with a need to escape

I am the Soul survivor
Soul Survivor
I am the Soul Survivor
Soul Survivor
