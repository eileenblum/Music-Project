Technology a gross manifestation
Quest for power, an endless temptation
The decline of man, an abomination
The altar of greed, the perfect consummation

The code of life lives only to survive
Worshipping the fire we will are slaves to the lie

Corrupting your mind with ruthless ambition
Blinding your eyes, killing the spirit's condition
The faces of death, deluded and vain,
Seduced by the power, illusion rules the game

The code of life lives only to survive
Worshipping the fire we will always rise

Buried in the ashes, the last remnants of the world
The code of all creation will rise up once again

The code of life will survive
The code of life will survive
The code of life will survive
The code of life will survive
