The masses consumed by this culture of greed
Enslaved by a ravenous breed 
Industrial ties, corporate disguise
Society lies at their feet

Oh, Kill the Machine
Oh, Kill the Machine

A global agenda, supply and demand
Force fed distractions and lies
Political chains of injustice remain
As the edge of humanity dies

Kill the Machine
We must kill the Machine

We must rise above the hypocrisy
The system is holding us down
We must break the spell of complacency
Let the hammer fall, so we can be free

The digital gods hang from the sky
Planting each thought by design
Controlling the commerce and steering the wealth
As new waves of technology climb

Yea, Kill the Machine
Oh, We must kill the Machine

We must rise above the hypocrisy
The system is holding us down
We must break the spell of complacency
Let the hammer fall, so we can be free
