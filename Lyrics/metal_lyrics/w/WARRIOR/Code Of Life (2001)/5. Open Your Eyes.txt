If the eyes are the window to the soul
Then the life that you lead is a mirror showing you
You must find the way
You, alone, must make the change

You've got to open your eyes and realize
You've got the power to change
Open your eyes and you will find
That the truth will remain

Creation slowly dying in a world unaware of its shame
With the sun evil rises, another day to suffer its pain
I know, yes I know that freewill is at your command
Can't you see, reality, an illusion, a spiritual game

I hear a voice calling out in the distance
It's calling my name
Waking up my unconscious mind

You've got to open your eyes and realize
That there's nothing to fear
Open your eyes and you will find 
That the truth will appear

No possessions but your heartbeat, your entrance into this cruel world
Tell me what will matter as you wander the ends of the earth
Isolation, revelation, your obsession with the specters of power
The aura of human majesty, this is your waking hour

I hear a voice calling out in the distance
It's calling your name
Your destiny lies in the palm of your hand

You've got to open your eyes and realize
You've got the power to change
Open your eyes and you will find
That the truth will remain

Open your eyes and realize
There's nothing to fear
Open your eyes 
The truth will appear
