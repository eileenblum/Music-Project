In time we trust
Remembering the last summer
In time we trust
When the night turns into day
The time we share
When we ride into the lands of
Calm and peace
And freedom in eternity

Gather in the night
Let them hear you fight
When the moon shines in the sky
Gather in the night
Hear their battlecry
Then the night turns into day
