We set sail for unknown waters
We don't know how much time we will spend
Full of ice is the horizon
Come what may our lives we'll defend

Feel the snow drops on my shoulder
Wind and coldness they can't change my mind
I'm a son of dauntless Vikings
Take all the courage for the last fight

There I see a light I see a shimmer far aside
What what can it be is it the ship to set me free

Look up to the sky
See the seagulls fly
Horizon is far
Sail by the stars
Free my memory from the scars
Think of former times
Times of shoreless life
This destiny
Why must it be
We have to sail the unknown seas

The wind blows straight into the canvas
The ship's bow cuts the highest waves
We sail under blackest standards
The sea will once be our grave

I once had a dream of freedom
Hoping this tale could once be my fate
I know that our men are coming
I trust that they will soon reveal hate

In our captain we will now trust
He navigates through unsafe seas
We're catching up the drift assists us
On our way to the great reef

Now listen men I got an order
I will see them all hanging high
Their blood shall stain the darkest water
I will watch their captain die
