Now the legend is reborn

Look at the stars
The dark age lies in the past
Look at the mountains far beyond the wide sprawling lands
You will see the notice of a new glory

You feel it you smell it you see it
A big change has begun
Trust in the forces of the dawning storm
And you will relive the complete return to glory
