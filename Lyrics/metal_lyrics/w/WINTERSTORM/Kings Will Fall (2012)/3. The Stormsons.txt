Born in the skies
To rule over the mountains
We are disposers of cloudy lands
We dive in the seas
For guarding all the fortunes
Wakeful and stealthy until the end
Evil take care
We're watching 'bout the repressed
And our weapons are not of steel
We are the kings
Of elemental forces
That's why the unbent force you'll feel

Hear our heralds screaming through the skies
We arrive with fire and thunder
Far over earthly power we will rise
We will be standing at your side

We are the warriors stamping through the desserts
We are the guardians ruling all the seas
We are defenders watching all the dark skies
We are the stormsons ruling all the ice

See our words
They are made divine
We are the spell hinders in your head
Confide in us
And see the godly sign
We are the shelter of the death
