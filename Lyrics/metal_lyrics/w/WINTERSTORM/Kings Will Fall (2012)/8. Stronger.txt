I once heard a tale it was long ago
A secret got lost in the snow
About a blade forged with blood sweat and tears
It could clear a man from his fear

Now sun melts down all the ice
It finally discloses what will be demise
We build an army without fear
Can't you see the redemption is coming near

We awoke what slept deep inside
We have the power of ice

We can make you stronger
We can clear your doubt
We will last much longer
And we have the clout

First line approaches the enemy
In series they fall to their knees
We want the fort that forever lasts
We hold the masses that vast
