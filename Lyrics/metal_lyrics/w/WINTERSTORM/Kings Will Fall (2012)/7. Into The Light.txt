We have waited for so long
For our time to come
We have waited for this new age of glory
We're not stoppable at all
We are following the call
We will gather for the revolution

We will stand up
We will rise now
We will stand united
We will stand together

Into the light the march of salvation
We are the ones the lords of creation
Heading the call break a hole in the wall
We all cause the kingdom to fall

Like all storms we will strike twice
It's not over in their eyes
We are heralds of the elemental forces
Walls will break like rotten trees
Stones are falling like their leaves
We force our way to the everlasting fortress
