Once there was this time of freedom
Once there was this time where no one was hurt
Once there was this time of believers
Once there was this time where no one had fears

Through this gray glass life seems to fade
Way too fast no chance to flee
It is time now for this one thing
It is time now to break free

Break the ice
That covered you inside
Break the ice
And leave this jail behind

All my feelings are still frozen
All I see is like a dream
By destiny I once was chosen
But I don't know what it means

Dark reflexions from the sunlight
Tell me that there's still a chance
I try to gather all of my might
I'll never bow and never bend

We're breaking the ice
We're breaking the ice
We're breaking the ice
We're breaking free
