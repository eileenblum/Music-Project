There is a sound of music, listen to the night
the moon is rising and the stars are shining bright.
At the horizon is the everlasting light
and now we sing together, humppa through the night.

[Chorus:]
hey hey hey hey hey hey humppa humppa
hey hey hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey hey hey Winterhumppa
hey hey hey hey hey hey

So now you clap your hands and stamp your feet loud
just to the Winterhumppa, let me hear your shout.

I saw you dancing and the only thing could be
I saw you clap your hands and saw you stamp your feet.
The night is long and this is good for me to see
you like the Winterhumppa, sing along with me.

[Chorus:]
hey hey hey hey hey hey humppa humppa
hey hey hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey hey hey Winterhumppa
hey hey hey hey hey hey

So now you clap your hands and stamp with your feet loud
just to the Winterhumppa, let me hear your shout.
