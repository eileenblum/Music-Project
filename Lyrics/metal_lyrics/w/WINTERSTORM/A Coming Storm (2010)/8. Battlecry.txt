Out of the darkness there comes a new foe
hate and brutality is what they show
marching in line and gathering up
that's what they do, they cannot be stopped.

Awoken by greed that fills up your heart
the picture tha hate you've had from the start
there is no way out as they're coming for you
they are the threat, you know what I do.

They make no convicts thats their code
this is the destiny that you evoke
can you see the deadly gaze in their eyes?
Your ears will hear their battlecries.

[Chorus:]
Listen to what I have to say
hear my words as I will lead the way.
Follow me and we'll never be appart
just stab your blade right into their hearts.

They are the shadows that nobody knows
the annihilation that constantly grows
merciless they are now seeking for blood
lifeless bodies sink down in the mud.

There's no escape and you cannot hide
there is no cure, only one glimpse of light
you know that they are now ending your lies
the last thing you hear is their battlecries.

[Chorus:]
Listen to what I have to say
hear my words as I will lead the way.
Follow me and we'll never be appart
just stab your blade right into their hearts.

All of your longing for power and gold
is decaying, there's nothing to hold
they can soon fulfill their horrible quest
until they've reached it, they will not rest.

Look at your hands, they've bloody and red
isn't that what the prophecy said?
You are the closen one who ends their lives
let them hear your battlecry.

[Chorus:]
Listen to what I have to say
hear my words as I will lead the way.
Follow me and we'll never be appart
just stab your blade right into their hearts.
