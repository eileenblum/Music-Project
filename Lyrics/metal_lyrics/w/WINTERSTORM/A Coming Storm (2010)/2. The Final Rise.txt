Forces of thunder awaking inside
Im raising my sword to the sky
Feelings of glory with strength and my pride
With hundreds of man at my side

Fight with pride a fire will rise in your eyes
Together we bleed, Freedom we seek
We fight till the end of our lifes

Fighting with power of majesty
The shadow will never return
Of thunder and lighting our hearts will be
The feeling of freedom will tried on the power of purity
Like eagles we rush trough the sky
Together we face our destiny
The flame in our hearts never dies
Viktory has come this will we the final rise

Like waves in the sea we stamp through the lines
The blood on our swords never drys
With fear in their faces their end will rise
This will be their final fight

Fight with pride a fire will rise in your eyes
Together we stand, stand till the end
With blood they will pay our price

Fighting with power of majesty
The shadow will never return
Of thunder and lighting our hearts will be
The feeling of freedom will tried on the power of purity
Like eagles we rush trough the sky
Together we face our destiny
The flame in our hearts never dies
Viktory has come this will we the final rise [x2]
