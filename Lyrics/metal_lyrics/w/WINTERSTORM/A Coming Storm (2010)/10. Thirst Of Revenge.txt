When the war is over
and there's silence all around
there's a sad time for everyone

and the corpses of our
troops are lying on the ground
there's a bad time for everyone.

There's a fire that is burning in our hearts
only one thing that we pray for in that night
and we ask them tell us why
our brothers had to die
on the other side we'll meet them again.

[Chorus:]
In our hearts the flame is still burning
in our hearts their lives go on
and we cry out the pain and we pray that
this fight can be won.

See shimmering light on our swords
hold the banner deep in your hands.
The revenge for our brothers is coming
the revenge for their death 'til the end.

Now we march against the hordes
the moonlight shines upon the field
there's no right, there's no wrong for anything
and the sound of battlecries
that is howling through the night
we are fighting for everything.

There's a fire that is burning in our hearts
only one thing that we pray for in that night
and we ask them tell us why
our brothers had to die
on the other side we'll meet them again.

[Chorus:]
In our hearts the flame is still burning
in our hearts their lives go on
and we cry out the pain and we pray that
this fight can be won.

See shimmering light on our swords
hold the banner deep in your hands.
The revenge for our brothers is coming
the revenge for their death 'til the end.
