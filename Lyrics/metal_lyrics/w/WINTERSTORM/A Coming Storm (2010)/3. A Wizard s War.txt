Far from the land where the sunrise is born
I am walking in my dreams
to find the infant child still left all alone
I realize the war begins when it is too late
and neither steel nor stone can stop the dawning of my fate

They struck me down with a touch of the blade
I was caught on hostile ground
there was no shelter from their everlasting hate
My armour shmashed to pieces now, my soul was torn apart
the question that remained: Could I have seen this from the start?

All on my own I'm fighting a wizard's war
I close my eyes to escape from reality
I never have shown that I'm fighting a wizard's war
for the existence of faith and of purity
it's a wizard's war for me

I realize the war begins when it is too late
and neither steel nor stone can stop the dawning of my fate
My armour shmashed to pieces now, my soul was torn apart
the question that remained: Could I have seen this from the start?

They struck me down with a touch of the blade
I was caught on hostile ground
there was no shelter from their everlasting hate
My armour shmashed to pieces now, my soul was torn apart
the question that remained: Could I have seen this from the start?

Still in my eyes see the thundering rage
you will never bring me down
though on my knees I will be crawling back in place.
A power greater than your hate, the strength to carry on
to rise again in all my pride, my victory has come

All on my own I'm fighting a wizard's war
I close my eyes to escape from reality
I never have shown that I'm fighting a wizard's war
for the existence of faith and of purity
it's a wizard's war for me
