Long ago, in a time filled with fear
lived a very brave man.
With his daughters, wife and sons
then he simply disappeared.

Time hase come
war has begun
death and hate
shall be your fate
coming home
all alone
no one knows.

Life's so hard for me to begin
but my father told me to hope.
In those days I lost all of you
but the light of heaven's shining through.

[Chorus:]
And I climb the highest mountains
in my heart a flame still burns.
And I'm flying like an eagle
to the skies of no return.
And I fight against the shadows
of the night and of the day.
Too many battles left to fight
I should go on my knees and pray.

Time goes by, you're old enough my son
to begin a new part of your life.
Leave your home, leave your family.
Take your sword and shield
put the saddle on your horse.

Day and night, dark and light
fear and strength, life and seath.
Stop and go, sword and bow, no one knows.

Life's so hard for you to begin
but I've told you what you have done.
On this day I say farewell to you
and the light moon is shining through.

[Chorus:]
And I climb the highest mountains
in my heart a flame still burns.
And I'm flying like an eagle
to the skies of no return.
And I fight against the shadows
of the night and of the day.
Too many battles left to fight
I should go on my knees and pray.

Now I'm on the top of mountains
and the flames are never cold
I'm still flying like an eagle
as my father always told.
And I won against the shadows
of the day and of the night
and the only thing I can see
is the everlasting light.
