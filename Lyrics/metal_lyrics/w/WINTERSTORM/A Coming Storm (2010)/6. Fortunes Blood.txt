Silently the knight has fallen
For our sworn on our knees we've be crawling 
Bringing torture and dismay
With the dawning of the day

See what the elves told
will proved to be our destiny
For the Fortune's Blood
We're rising our sacred hearts [x4]

Hear the battle drums at night
They are calling for the fight
That's what we are coming for
It's the power of the north!

See what the elves told
will proved to be our destiny
For the fortune's Blood
We're rising our sacred hearts [x2]
