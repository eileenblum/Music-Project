Days on the trail and still there is nothing to see
Starched by the thought of my clan and the sickness in me
Did all I could but the got proscribed
But I know they'll be free

[Refrain]
Marching on to the trail forgotten
In search for the truth and the right
Don't look back cross the bridges rotten
Keep in mind that the aim is in sight

Days on the trail and still there is nothing to see
Starched by the thought of my clan and the sickness in me
The wind's raging on how long will it last
hold out until the storm past

[Refrain]
Marching on to the trail forgotten
In search for the truth and the right
Don't look back cross the bridges rotten
Keep in mind that the aim is in sight

Don't look back
Stay ahead
Watch the trap

[Refrain]
Marching on to the trail forgotten
In search for the truth and the right
Don't look back cross the bridges rotten
Keep in mind, keep in mind, keep in mind, keep in mind
Keep in mind that the aim is in sight

Don't look back
Stay ahead
Watch the trap
