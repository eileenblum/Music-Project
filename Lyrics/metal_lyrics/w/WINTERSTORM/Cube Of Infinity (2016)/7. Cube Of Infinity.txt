Ancient masters of life
Once created a powerful device
Some were searching but never did find
Always hidden from curious eyes

Cube of Infinity â shine
Cube of Infinity â melt the snow

What is the purpose that they ever build it
Who has the power to build such a thing
Infinity in a shell of a die-form
Royal blood is the admission price
Cube of Infinity

[Refrain]
Cube of Infinity â shine
Open your gates for me â melt the snow away
Cube of Infinity â shining to bring the truth back
Open your gates for me â let me feel your power

How can we use all the might from the inside
How an we set the interior free
All this might without any access
All we have is the mysterious key

[Refrain]
Cube of Infinity â shine
Open your gates for me â melt the snow away
Cube of Infinity â shining to bring the truth back
Open your gates for me â let me feel your power

Look at the dice, look at the dice â glowing
Look at the skies, look at the skies â falling
Look at the dice, look at the dice â glowing
Look at the skies, look at the skies â falling
See the device, see the device â unfolding
Blood is the price, blood is the price â pay it
See the device, see the device â unfolding
Blood is the price, blood is the price â pay it

[Refrain]
Cube of Infinity â shine
Open your gates for me â melt the snow away
Cube of Infinity â shining to bring the truth back
Open your gates for me â let me feel your power
