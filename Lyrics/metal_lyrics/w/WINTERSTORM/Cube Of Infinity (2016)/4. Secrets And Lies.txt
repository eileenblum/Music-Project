Keeping now the truth for me
faking and taking irony
No one is able to see what will be
Until the truth comes out at last

One is planning death the other revival
both are hiding secretly their own plan

[Refrain]
Vanishful demise comes ever after
Don't rely on every single spoken word
A lie is made up fast and spoken faster
It's not always meant like it was heard before

Do they know my truthful name
Can he guess my hidden aim
Will I be the one to blame
Will I uncover and fall in shame

[Refrain]
Vanishful demise comes ever after
Don't rely on every single spoken word
A lie is made up fast and spoken faster
It's not always meant like it was heard before

Promise spoken
Promise broken

Promise spoken
yet is known
Promise broken
In the end

[Refrain]
Vanishful demise comes ever after
Don't rely on every single spoken word
A lie is made up fast and spoken faster
It's not always meant like it was heard before
