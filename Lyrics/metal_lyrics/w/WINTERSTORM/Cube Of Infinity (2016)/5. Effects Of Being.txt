I was sent through space and time
To unleash this might divine
Though I lost some memories
I know how to fight this decease

[Refrain]
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun
Everything you make
Has effects you have to take
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun

All the efforts do not help
But it seems to even get worse
Virus spreading undetected
Every single one infected

[Refrain]
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun
Everything you make
Has effects you have to take
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun

There's no cure to heal this plague
Not the time to wait for wonders
Cast the spell of freezing blood
Start the age of death and plunder

[Refrain]
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun
Everything you make
Has effects you have to take
For every deed that's done
A shadow rises from the sun
