It was a long time, holding back all those mournful thoughts
I can let go now free my mind from these notional knots
Should I just tell them all the things that the cube can take
Or should I leave it because too much is at stake

Can you hear the warning, can you see the turning tables
Can you see the signals trying to ban our tries

[Refrain]
Initiation rite
Feel the unleashing might
See all the burning light
Time is on our side

The shattering ghost decays in thought of his home clan
No common well he has chosen
Echoes in time see all the future story begins to unwind
Echoes in time oblivion comes no memories left in their mind

Too late to ignore nothing to change for it is too late
But how to unmake it ho to break all these shackles of fate
By strangers surrounded nameless figures without a choice
familiar the faces and it feels like a well known voice

Can you hear the warning, can you see the turning tables
Can you see the signals trying to ban our tries

[Refrain]
See our capturing
See our incoming
Time is the only thing
This is the scattering
