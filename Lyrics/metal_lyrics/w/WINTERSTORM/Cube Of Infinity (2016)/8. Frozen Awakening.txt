Once forged out of stardust
A fallen meteor storm
Never able to rust
Shaped into a square form

Control for all the time
Then build the six in line
Try them to realign
Searching divine

[Refrain]
Cube
Is listening my command
Yet time
Is running through my hand

How can we wake him
Guard of the last ark stone

Breaking bands of prison
The guardian must be awakened
Your weapon is your wisdom
Mind is still so vacant

Control for all the time
Then build the six in line
Try them to realign
Searching divine

[Refrain]
Cube
Is listening my command
Yet time
Is running through my hand

Wake up and help us to find
Wisdom and power to rewind
Past and the future need to be renewed
You are relieved from your sentry

To use the power of the ark stone
The answer of this question is to be known
What is my name combined I'm crossed three
Manifold get reversed twin of me

Solve and you'll be worthy
Fail and set my rage free
Solve and you'll be worthy
Fail and set my rage free

[Refrain]
Cube
Is listening my command
Yet time
Is running through my hand
