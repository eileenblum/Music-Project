In times of a broken shield
Outrageous plague's unveiled
To manifest his might
the lord got's to decide
To wether let his people die
Or break his laws for self-denial
What's to take and what's to choose
Both leads to reproof

The price is high maybe it is too much
But if not tried you never will know the cost
Affected by this sinister touch
He requests the frost

[Refrain]
Come listen to sound of change
And lose your thought and will for reality
See darkness rising from the wasteland
Cover skies with endless night
Come listen to the sound of change
And loose your thought and will for reality
Feel the magic of the banned
Hear the pacts of blood and might

Send for the exile
Banned to emerald isle
Demand the pact of blood
To overwhelm the flood
Once abused and mauled to break
He then worked out a plan to aid
He was delivered to the lord
To gain the knowledge stored

[Refrain]
Come listen to sound of change
And lose your thought and will for reality
See darkness rising from the wasteland
Cover skies with endless night
Come listen to the sound of change
And loose your thought and will for reality
Feel the magic of the banned
Hear the pacts of blood and might
