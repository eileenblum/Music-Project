Rehab is the pledge
A prince to supervise the task
Success is on the edge
In disguise behind the mask

Gifted daughter is requested as the price
A cleric dowry for the warlock left in ice
Secretly branded him deep in his mind
To give her away

[Refrain]
Forbidden spells of ancient time
Cast to guard against decline
Forbidden spells of twilight force
Feed the virus from its source

Debate, dispute, deny, retry
Discuss, refuse, draw near, agree

[Refrain]
Forbidden spells of ancient time
Cast to guard against decline
Forbidden spells of twilight force
Feed the virus from its source

Promises are made in clarity
Secrets in the other hand
Speaking honest words of irony
To vanish after in the sand

Gifted daughter is requested as the price
A cleric dowry for the warlock left in ice
Secretly branded her deep in her mind
To unfold the door

We debate, dispute, deny and retry
Discuss, refuse, draw near and finally agree
Speaking the honest words of irony
To vanish in the sand

[Refrain]
Forbidden spells of ancient time
Cast to guard against decline
Forbidden spells of twilight force
Feed the virus from its source
