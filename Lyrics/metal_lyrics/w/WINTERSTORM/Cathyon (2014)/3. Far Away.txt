Far away to the mountain you have to go
Far away where the ground is covered in snow
You will find your love and punish all of those
Who stand in your way

Blessed by the bears I am on my way
To find the parts of what went astray
Though I donât know if I will suffice
I head for the land of fire and ice

Iâm searching Iâm seeking for Tira my true love
Please hold out Iâll go on for evermore

Far away to the mountain I have to go
Far away where the ground is covered in snow
I will find my love and punish all of those
Who stand in my way

A journey to the unknown
To foreign lands afar
Until the northern winds moan
To find his heart

Far away [10x]

In this land you have to go
The mountains far away
Take your sword and take the stone
And find the parts astray
