FIRE
The shine of cleansing light
Devours darkness endless fight
Reborn a thousand times
The phoenix medal primes

WIND
A temple built up high
Into the endless sky
Itâs reaching high and low
The shamans of the crow

EARTH
The massive mountains hard
Are formed to be the guard
Of seed and life to care
The Templars of the bear

SEA
Protecting like a shield
Its secret is revealed
The balance is endangered
The Rayclan sends the rangers

Ice darkness death
Are gathering for the mess

We must choose
Once again for our world
One fighter, one saviour
A man of honour poise no more
The dark side rises again
They found a way to break
The shield of Cathyron

STARS
Downfall of burning lights
Ground cracks heavy tides
The nether servants soar
To start the conquest war

BLOOD
-Toll from all brutes they seek
To enlarge the shelterâs leak
Capturing for the trade off
Unaware of Teronâs love

Aid from the bears
A secretâs shared
A heroâs dare

We must choose
Once again for our world
One fighter, one saviour
A man of honour poise no more
The dark side rises again
They found a way to break
The shield of Cathyron

Welcome to Cathyron [4x]

Thereâs one way
For returning your love
One fighter, one saviour
Shall obtain union of the four
Recombine all to one
Secure the power of
The shield of Cathyron
