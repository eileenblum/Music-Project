All four parts achieved
To the tunnel Iâm turning
The union is yearning
It has opened for me
All I see is a huge maze
Full of endless ways

Into darkness I head
A shadow appears in the front
It approaches to hunt
Is it safety or threat
My eyes are betraying
To darkness Iâm praying

Seeking resort
From this place swart
Find the escape
To leave the maze

Guide me the way through the endless tunnel
For I lost my way
Every path I choose is a dead end
No light of the day
Lead me back
To the road I must go
As my force has to grow

A creature strong as a bear
He was born in the dark
His skinâs hard as bark
True friendship is rare
He is swearing it to me
The daylight I will see

I found a new friend
With his help Iâm advancing
Through walls he is lancing
No more dead end
He is breaking the walls down
Razing them to the ground

In the darkness you must travel
âTil you reach the other side
Seize your power for the next
Into the desert you must ride
