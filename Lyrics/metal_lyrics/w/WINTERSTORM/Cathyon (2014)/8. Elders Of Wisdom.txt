This land was once fruitful
Now itâs parched and all has died
Even all the elders gave their lives
The sands of time

I hold the stone of old power
Help of the elders I seek
I need to find them their tower
I can refill their run dry creek

Elders of wisdom arise
I hold the water revive
Refill the ancient elements
To make sure that darkness ends

The fountain of life drained long ago
No one could escape
Only the water from down below
Has the potential to wake
Now I got the element
From deep down in the seas
I have the might to awake them all
I will set them free

We are free from our chains
You released us now we serve
Teron whatâs your longing
You will get what you deserve

All parts united feel this power
Summon the gateway for me
I can defeat them their tower
Obey my wish and see
