Deep down in the realms of ocean
Force from abyss â winds arise
Dive and travel under water
Descend to the aquatic tribes

On the quest for the oceanâs heart
Deep down in the seas
You will cross through the waterâs dark
To find what you seek

Keeper of water see my longing
I came for the oceanâs heart
No one rules the Elementstone
I have to deny the part

Deep in the ocean the sun never shines
Flee to the surface the stone on your side

In obscuritatem sub mare descendit
Ut lapidem aquae arripiat

Feel the breeze it streams on your skin
See the spray and discard your fins
