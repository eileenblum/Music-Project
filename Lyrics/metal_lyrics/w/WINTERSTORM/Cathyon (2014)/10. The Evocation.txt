With my words Iâm calling you
I want you to be here in our place
By the night
The darkened king will rise

With our words weâre calling you
We want you to be here in our place
By the night
The darkened king will rise

With our words weâre calling you
We want you to be here in our place
For tonight
The darkened king must rise
