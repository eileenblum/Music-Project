Flames all around thereâs no chance to escape
How can one change sudden fate
Heat devastates the intruder of faith
Beyond consciousness
The stone awakes and surrounds him
Glowing with power of life

Follow the might of the stone
Pass the burning gates of Cathyron
The ascension has begun
Follow the light throughout the night
Follow the light of the stone
Pass the burning gates of Cathyron
You are the chosen one you are the hope
For everyone

Master of fire Iâm claiming your part
I came to bring union of four
You must prove your worth
We will read your mind
But remember the one thing
Many have tried though
No one could claim it before

We are the ashes
No one can claim our fire
We are the luster
We know your true desire

Love is your arson
Your demand is altruistic
You are the bright son
Kneel down and receive
FIRE
