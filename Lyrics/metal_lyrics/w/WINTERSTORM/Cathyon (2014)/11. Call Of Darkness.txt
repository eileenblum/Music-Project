Evocation is complete
Source of evil full defeat
With this stone I have the power over you
You will burn for what we went through

For long time weâve searched a way
Come see the dark one is coming
To combine the parts astray
Come see the dark one is coming
Many souls were torn away from the clans
Come see the dark one is falling
All commanded by your hands
Come see the dark one will fall

We are bringing your rule to an end so the dark call
Takes place tonight
Spells are arranged there is no escape
We crush out your might

Darkness calls darkness falls
We command you down onto your knees
Darkness calls darkness falls
We prepared all for your defeat
Time has come time is now
King of darkness Xaroth has to die
Time has come time is now
We enforce the everlasting call of darkness
Come and join the call of darkness
Evermore

Our spell will exhaust your life
Come see the dark one is fading
Doom the hateful god of strife
Come see the dark one is fading
Finally the visionâs right and comes true
Come see the dark one is falling
Your demise our view
Come see the dark one will fall

Your spells cannot hold me
I am here I am free
And no one will defeat me

Darkness calls darkness falls
I command you down onto your knees
Darkness calls darkness falls
I prepared all for your defeat
Time has come time is now
King of darkness Xaroth has to die
Time has come time is now
We enforce the everlasting call of darkness
Come and join the call of darkness
Evermore
