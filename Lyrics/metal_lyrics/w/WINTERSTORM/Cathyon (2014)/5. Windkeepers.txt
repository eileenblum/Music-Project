The order of crow commanded me to
Enlight the bonfire up high
The stairs of the tower lead into the blue
The tower is covered in ice
No fire is able to enlighten the flame
A hundred believers have tried
But Tero takes the fireâs part
So it will burn so bright

The elder canât believe his blinded eyes
He arrests the chosen one for telling lies

Friar can you help me
Make the elders see

Light the fire in the sky
Climb the mountain up high
So the flame will burn again
And emblaze our glen
Light the fire in the sky
At least you must try
So you bring the light again
Keep the spark aflame
At all times

The curious monk begins to hope
He starts to climb he starts to lope
The friar sees the shining light
He knows the stranger has been right

Step by step heâs running low
The stairway to the crows

Elders listen closely
The stranger speaks the truth
