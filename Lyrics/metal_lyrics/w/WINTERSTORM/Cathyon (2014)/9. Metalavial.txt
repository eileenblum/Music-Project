Join and listen to this metal
Cause iron is grave in life
Some think metalâs for battle
Those live on the edge of time

Battle hymns we sing together
Once again the hammer thrusts
Blood drunk and bound forever
In fate of norns we trust

Unbent unbowed unbroken
Youâll reach the netherworld
And hear the crimson thunder
Louder than hell

Times of Metalavial â all parts united
Metalavial â once and for all
Metalavial â we ride the lightning
Now the dark king will fall

The fire of the stone is burning
âTil the dawn of victory
The northwind is his yearning
See the shine of silvery

Come now and trust our words
Deep in the darkest night
Join us and sate your thirst
We enforce the final rite
Come and assert your rights
Together we bend his soul
Deep in the splendid times of Metalavial
