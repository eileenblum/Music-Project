All of my life, what of my dreams 
Have you ever considered, that i am trying hard
All that i am, inside my soul is burning from the inside and out, 
just trying to survive
And all these faces, are staring back at me

I feel like going back (to the place i know) 
It will matter that someday
I will try to find my own way
Should have never gone, to hide myself
and to all the ones that i love
I pray for your forgiveness

I did escape from my old ways,
only to imagine that i would not hurt anyone else
But now their faces, are staring back at me

I feel like going back (to the place i know) 
It will matter that someday
I will try to find my own way
Should have never gone, to hide myself
and to all the ones that i love

It is easy to judge everything I've done, 
now it's breaking apart like a house made of glass, 
I know of all my mistakes, I will not go on, like this

I feel like going back
It will matter that someday
I will try to find my own way
Should have never gone, to hide myself
and to all the ones that i love
I pray for your forgiveness

I pray, to all the ones that i love
I pray for your forgiveness
