It feels like forever
that I've been looking into your eyes,
to find you
It feels like forever, and still no time at all,
that I've been standing here
All the things that I owe you
I cannot leave you like this,
'Cause you will always be in my heart
And all the things that I never told you,
when it ended up like this,
that is why I'm standing here
And it feels like forever, that you've been lost
But I will always come back for you

All the things that i owe you,
I cannot leave you like this,
cause you will always be in my heart
And it feels like forever, that you've been lost,
but I will allways come back for you
But i will always come back for you,
cause you will allways be in my heart
All the things that i owe you,
I cannot leave you like this
You will always be in my heart
