All that i've got
In my hand i've got a picture of you smiling
And all of the memories that we shared
come alive, with a glance

And I did not know that it would feel like this
in this poetry of our hearts
With or without you I feel love,
cause this picture of your smile,
it is the only thing I hold close to my heart
You will always be so close to my heart

It is never in vain
I will always cherish your name
Appreciate all that you have done
Because my soul is light
and it's all thanks to you

And I did not know that it would feel like this
in this poetry of our hearts
With or without you I feel love,
cause this picture of your smile,
it is the only thing I hold close to my heart
You will always be so close to my heart

I won't leave you
I won't leave you
for anything
