The struggle in your mind,
it feels like you have been left behind,
it is your own game find your way back home,
do not rely on me
I know that you have fought enough,
and all i ever did was care,
someday you'll realize that this is all you have,
and you have to make it on your own

You try to break free from all of your mistakes,
why can't you see i'll never let you go
I feel love from all of our memories, history, thats the way, it should be
I'll never leave or let you down

It's in your own hands,
just make sure that those days are gone,
what will you do now,
was this the life you planned
No!

I know that you have fought enough,
and all I ever did was care,
someday you'll realize that you are not alone,
but you have to make it on your own

You try to break free from all of your mistakes,
why can't you see i'll never let you go
I feel love from all of our memories, history, thats the way, it should be
I'll never leave or let you down

It grants you the serenity, to accept the things you cannot change,
courage to change the things you can, and wisdom to know the difference

It sets you free
Free from all the pain you had to feel
Sets you free

Make it up for yourself, because things are only getting worse
You have to break free from everything

Why can't you see i'll never let you go
I feel love from all of our memories, history, thats the way it should be
I'll never leave or let you down

God knows you where meant to be like yourself forever
Your life is in ruins, but there still time to change
