Ignorant, I'm waiting
as I'm reaching for the light
Wondering what tomorrow brings 
I'm looking for a guide that will lead me back 
it wont get any further than this
it is time to make a statement make a stand

And as my walls are tumbling down, 
you'll be there for me
I will not go without you 
this time, no

I've been living this life for to long, 
now you reach out your hand, cause you understand why
I've been living like a fool without knowing why
It is time to put an end, to the world we ones knew

Locked down, as creature without a voice, 
I am trapped in a safety, that i call life
And it is time to make my life worth living, 
no point in crying anymore

And as my walls are tumbling down, 
you'll be there for me
I will not go without you this time, no

I've been living this life for to long, 
now you reach out your hand, cause you understand why
I've been living like a fool without knowing why, 
It is time to put an end, to the world we ones knew

I've been living this life for to long

I've been living this life for to long, 
now you reach out your hand, cause you understand why
(Far to long I've felt this way
Never really knowing why)
I've been living like a fool without knowing why
It is time to put an end, to the world we ones knew
