In a dream, in place 
where no one could touch your faith 
dreams are made to be fulfilled
WIth a heart, with a presence 
that wants to make you turn back time, 
sadly we cant force any of this

Sometimes things are better, 
with a quick decision made, 
respecting a choice of life
Do you remember

Our memories will last, 
you know that we would die for you, 
your brothers in arms
Your memories will last 
Do you remember what it felt like

All the time, that we spent, 
with the love, we still share
Theres a beginning but no end 
Your one of those, who search for life, 
uncertain of what that is about to come, 
somethimes things just seem so clear to me

You knew what was about to come, 
don't think you knew it all along
Now we stand alone, 
but we press on

Our memories will last, 
you know that we would die for you, 
your brothers in arms
Your memories will last 
Do you remember what it felt like? 
Do you remember?

Our memories will last
In a dream in a place where no one could touch your faith
Where no one can touch us

Our memories will last, 
you know that we would die for you, 
your brothers in arms
Your memories will last 
Do you remember what it felt like?
We're brothers in arms
forever
