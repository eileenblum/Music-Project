If you ever felt just like
you're doing it again 
A phase that's going over and over
You take a look within
frustration begins to grow
A phase that's going over and over

Start screaming 
To get yourself out
Inside you know what you are meant to be
Start breathing 
To get yourself out
Before you start your own worst nightmare

Life ain't as it is, 
it is what you make of it
A phase thats going over and over ('til the end)
Start to look within
 to take control
You've got the power to mend your own wounds

Start screaming 
To get yourself out
Inside you know what you are meant to be
Start believing
To get yourself out, 
before you end up in this nightmare

If you would stray, if you would break 
just take your time to reconsider
If you would stop, if you would drop
just take your time to rediscover yourself
You will stray
You will break
Take your time
Start slow
Real slow
Just take your time

Start believing
To get yourself out
Start believing

If you would stray, if you would break 
just take your time to reconsider
If you would stop, if you would drop
just take your time to rediscover yourself
You will stray
You will break
Take your time
Start slow
Real slow
Just take your time

Rise up! 
Break free! 
Learn to be you 
Rise up!
Break free!
Learn to stay true
Just take your time
