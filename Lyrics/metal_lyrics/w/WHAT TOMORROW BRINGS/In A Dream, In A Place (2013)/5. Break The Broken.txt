Do you feel alive 
when you put your anger into destructive ways?
Do you feel alive 
when you break the spirit of another, that is already broken?

So why? 
Why break the broken? 
It doesn't do you any good at all
(It wont take away your pain) 
And we
we tear down the walls
It has been built by shame that was built by you

If you ever knew what it would feel like 
if it was the other way around
See yourself in a world that you so strongly create
I don't think that you will find it amusing

So why? 
Why break the broken? 
It doesn't do you any good at all
(It wont take away your pain) 
And we
we tear down the walls
It has been built by shame that was built by you
