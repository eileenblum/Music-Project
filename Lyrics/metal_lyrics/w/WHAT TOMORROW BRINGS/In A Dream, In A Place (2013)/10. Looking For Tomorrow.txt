I don't know the reasons,
for feeling like I do,
I don't even know, who I really am
No sense of purpose,
no sense of nothing at all

With all the things they're saying to me,
I guess it shouldn't be hard to see,
But as I'm grasping for the joy,
it keep slipping through my hands,
it keep slipping through my hands

I did not come all this way
just to find myself astray
No I came here today, to say i'll find a way
I'll search the world, I'll search myself
'Till I stop wasting time,
just looking for tomorrow

Can you show me what is real,
No sense of purpose
These brief moments hope,
one true last dream of hope

And I know that I shouldn't complain
but sometimes life just seems so vain,
And the harder and harder I try,
I end up feeling like a lie, am I living a lie, like this.

I did not come all this way
just to find myself astray
No I came here today, to say i'll find a way
I'll search the world, I'll search myself
'Till I stop wasting time,
just looking for tomorrow

If you know what it was likeâ¦
I would tell you that this is my world
Just looking for tomorrow
