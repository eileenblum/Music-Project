The strangest feelings
that which can't be denied
Going down this lonely road, thinking about my life
Never come to solutions, repeating patterns of the broken
I am reaching out for a helping hand

And it feels like I've never been on this road before,
so I am moving on like nothing, on my own
I am moving on like nothing, into the misery of me

Life is passing by
Am i the only one?
Hoping for a turn a turn in my mind
I have to change the way of thinking
(Break the patterns and bury them)
I need a way out
I just have to leave my old thoughts behind

Still it feels like I've never been on this road before,
so I am moving on like nothing, on my own
I am moving on like nothing, into the misery of me

The years have come to pass
I thought that I'd know myself better by know

Still it feels like i've never been on this road before,
cause I am moving on like nothing, on my own
How can it feel so lonely?
Why does it feel so wrong?
How can it feel so lonely?
Why does it feel so wrong?
I'm losing myself
I am moving on like nothing, and I am losing my self
I am moving on like nothing
