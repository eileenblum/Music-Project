The words where written on your face,
disappointment and disgrace
It ripped your heart out
it ripped your heart out
Sometimes time just got the best of us,
and sometimes life just got the rest of us

There's still time to set things right,
we can make it through the night
We'll make it out of here, out of here as one

Hold on!
Just a little while, someday, we will make it out of here as one
Hold on!
just a little while, someday, somehow

You say it's getting much to late,
you say it's just about to break
I am sure I see the light ahead of us
Rest assure tonight that things will be alright
Don't loose your heart now
Don't loose your heart now
Theres still time to set things right,
we can make it through the night,
We'll make it out of here,
out of here as one,
out of here as one

I feel alive, ones again
That is what saves me
My relief

Hold on!
Just a little while, someday, we will make it out of here as one
Hold on!
just a little while, someday, somehow
