Sometimes you feel that no one cares
Sometimes life strikes like thunder in your face

Where will illusions hide
when things are going bad?
I wanna be like fire
to burn sorrows away

Ooooooh - Listen to your dreams tonight
Ooooooh - Have to find your guiding light
Sometimes you need a friendly hand
Sometimes nobody seems to understand

When nothing's right, when you stay blind,
when need a goal to reach
When hope is lost and you're alone,
then listen to your dreams

Ooooooh - Listen to your dreams tonight
Ooooooh - Have to find your guiding light
Ooooooh - Listen to your dreams tonight
Ooooooh - That's the key to live your life

As time goes by your star will shine,
you'll see the smile of lady luck
She'll drive your heart out of the dark,
Now's time to start again your life

Ooooooh - Listen to your dreams tonight
Ooooooh - Have to find your guiding light
Ooooooh - Listen to your dreams tonight
Ooooooh - That's the key to live your life

Listen to your dreams...
