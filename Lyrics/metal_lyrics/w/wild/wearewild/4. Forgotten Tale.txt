[Narrator:]

Eight thousand years ago
When the Earth was just the playground of the Elders
When freedom was the goal
because of human race challenged their fate

Forgotten stories talk about
how Elders punished rebel ones
All those who tried to take
control of their (own) lives
Searching deep into dignity,
they found a new reason to be
Expecting harder times,
mankind prepared to strike

Then the war against Elders began
Children saw their parents lying in the ground
Was too late to give up
Widows prayed for a miracle

[All:]

And they came from the sky
Riding white eagles brought justice,
While sunlight kills the night

[Narrator:]

Old tyrants fell down
A new age had borned with the rising sun

[Human:]

Now we can get out this cage
we guide our lives once again
But this time the toll is too high
A lot of us died... They lie in the battlefield

[Angel:]

We're here by the grace of the gods
We've come to save you from the fall
Your race has been chosen to last
Forget now your past... And rise in unity

[All:]

And they came from the sky
Riding white eagles brought justice,
While sunlight kills the night

[Narrator:]

Old tyrants fell down
A new age had borned with the rising sun

[Narrator:]

Blinded by the power
don't deserved the mercy of gods
They betrayed their principles
to rule over them all

Selfishness and thirst for power
destroyed their unity
Gods left mankind to their fate

[Human:]

Fading slowly into the black hole
of our greediness
Maybe a fair destiny
for our live in sin

[Narrator:]

This is just a forgotten tale
A story about the fault of human race
Intolerance and greediness, not stuff of nowadays
Are leading us all to decay
