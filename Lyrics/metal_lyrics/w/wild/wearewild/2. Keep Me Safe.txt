In this days of pain and blood
Saints and sinners wear the same mask
Chosen ones can make the law
Welcome to hell, paradise is sold

Shrapnel melting in the sky
That's the glory of our science
Thousand fists screamin' war
Hear my cry deep in silence

My voice is not strong enough
I know I won't break the wall
If there's someone else to fight
Come with me, let's kick some ass!

Keep me safe - Save me from the human race
Keep me safe - Ooh!
Keep me safe - I don't wanna be a slave
Keep me safe - No more!

Many ways to lose your life
Many volunteers to shoot down
What's the matter with you guys?
Why do you hide behind a weapon?

I can't understand you all
Even killing for control
But I never give my mind
Yeah, my friend... It's our time!

Keep me safe - Save me from the human race
Keep me safe - Ooh!
Keep me safe - I don't wanna be a slave
Keep me safe - No more!

Keep me safe - I don't wanna be a slave
Keep me safe
Keep me safe - Save me from the human race
Keep me safe

Keep me safe!
