[originally by Edguy]Blinded by the fire and the sorrow of the day 
I come knocking at your door to dry the tears away 
The eventide is calling me to take a look into your eyes 
Pull me on and make me mesmerized! 

Riding on the wings of light 
Dreaming dreams and holding tight: 
Leaving all my sorrow far behind 
Your eyes are the gate 

To the land of the miracle where our love can make us fly 
Make us fly 
In the land of the miracle 
We can can find a reason why and how we can fly 

Open up the book up madness read the page of life! 
Who's the one to tell you what to do and how to rise? 
And if the stars would fall one day I'd climb up to the sky 
To put them back for you to save your smile 

...Take a look onto the book of fantasy and poetry and 
you will see: what you can feel is everything you 
need to heal your crying mind, the soul behind and 
everything that you may find inside your head... 

...A million years have passed away to make us head 
for the decay and to unlearn just what yearn for 
all day long: Right to be strong and stick to our 
ideals, are they for real and do we just have lost the 
thread! 

... I believe in miracles they happen everyday 
In your arms a dream comes true for me...
