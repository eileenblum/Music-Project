I set my heart out to sea,
Hoping someday my love would return to me,
Yet the years have passed like waves,
And I have fatigued with age,
In lachrymal oceans vast,
Deserts of time have washed away

The passage of time implies progression,
Yet I've become stone,
Watching worlds dying,
Negating the solace I've never known
