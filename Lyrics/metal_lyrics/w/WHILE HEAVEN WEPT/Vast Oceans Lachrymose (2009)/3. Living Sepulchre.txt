I gave myself
Until there was
Nothing left of me

Yet I never said
No when you
Needed me

You never knew
Or cared how
Fragile I really was

I scream but you cannot hear me

So if you wonder
Why I've vanished
To the hell of myself

Year after year I've
Built these walls
And finally sealed myself inside

Without air
Without light
I close my eyes

You're screaming but I cannot hear you

Betrayed, abandoned
By those I loved the most
