Stranded upon a desperate shore, afraid
That the sea could wash all of our dreams away
Into it's everflowing infinity...
Or do these tides hold for us sanctuary?

Tonight, will you sail away
With open arms and eyes ablaze?

Believe... in me...

With passion I've built this vessel for us to wander
These oceans that rage within each other
And though the waves, as if to resist, will arise
If we have faith, ne'er will we capsize

Tonight, will you sail away
With open arms and eyes ablaze?

Believe... in me...

Guided by our hearts aflame like the stars above
The journey to heaven begins with this deepest of loves
Have faith without fear, open your heart, breathe and believe
Together we'll find our peace somewhere across the seas

Tonight, we will sail away with open hearts and eyes ablaze

Believe... in me...
