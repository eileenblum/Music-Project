So long ago, I set out to sea, forsaken by god and man
Visions of passion, glory and gold beckoned from distant lands
I left behind all I had known, aspiring to live, love, and conquer
Unaware that these futile pursuits would only yield a drifting sepulchre

Desperate
I have traversed
The seas of
Sorrow

Aimlessly drifting for many a year, cursing this fated endeavor
Hopeless, I accept that the solace I've sought will elude me forever
Straining against the maelstrom unbound, my limbs frailed and broken
Splintered apart after storm upon storm, my heart and hopes have sunken

Desolate
I have succumb
To the seas of
Sorrow

Tortured memories of sailing and searching, finding and failing
Eroding the will to further resist the waves violent churning
Bereft of strength I've lost hold of the dream now sinking in sorrow
Falling helpless to the waters raging below

For a fleeting moment I clutched the debris of my vessel now flotsam
A futile attempt of an overcome man to fend off the ocean
I know it is hopeless when I see the approach of the conquering wave
That has come to carry me to my watery grave

Washed ashore, succumb to the sea
The waves force upward my lifeless eyes
To watch the sun set for the last time
Only in death, would peace be mine
