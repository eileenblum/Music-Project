THOUGHTS ARE DRIFTING TO BLACK
THROUGH THE MOTIONS AND MOMENTS
AND NOW YOUâVE STOLEN BACK
THE NEARNESS AND LEFT ME WITH SILENCE

AND SILENCE IS DEATH
YEARNING âTIL MY LAST BREATH

REMEMBERING HOW YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE BROKEN
DESPITE THE LIGHT BURNING THROUGH
AND NOW, IâM BURNED AND IâM BROKEN TOO

VANISHING WITH THE WORLD WE NEVER KNEW

YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE BROKEN
DESPITE THE LIGHT BURNING THROUGH
AND NOW, IâM BURNED AND IâM BROKEN TOO
