With blind ambitions and foolish pride
I reached towards the heavens high
The fire consumed the wings and dreams of Icarus and I

Spiraling down from vertiginous heights
I carried the weight of the sun
Heart into ash burned by the light
The last mortal coil's come... undone

Falling... ever... downward to the sea
Drowning... in flames...
Endless cursing the hybris that tempted me

With blind ambitions, false hope and pride
I aspired towards the heavens high
Only to plunge hell's deepest divide
Icarus and I

Spiraling down from vertiginous heights
I carried the weight of the sun
Heart into ash burned by the light
The last mortal coil's come... undone

Falling... ever... downward endlessly
Into darkness... helpless
Cursing the hybris

O vision of starlight
O my radiance divine
Gather ye lost angels in white
Carry this heart of mine
Beyond the eternal night
And these stone cold walls so labyrinthine

The labyrinth inside
The labyrinth inside
