The highest of hopes left impossible debts
Of darkness and pain and deeper regrets
Facing our future of paradise lost
Interred my soul in permafrost

Motionless oceans cease
With barriers of stone
Scarred by algid winds
Through centuries blown
Through centuries blown

A distance that cannot be bridged
Where only the dead have ever voyaged
Where spirits entwine in holocaust
You buried my heart in permafrost

A solitary prison
Wrought from anguish and ice
Confining ravaged hearts
No hope can excise
No hope can excise

A prisoner of ice
The sole survivor of this wreckage
A shattered spirit far beyond salvage
