WHEN FATE PRETERMITS
MEANINGLESS THE MAGNETS
ONCE DRAWN AS IF THE SEA TO MOON

THE UNSEEN EXITS
OF SEVERED COUPLETS
LEAVE WORTHLESS, WORDLESS SONNETS STREWN

(AND SPIRITS LOST TO RUIN)

REMEMBER THE STARS
THE FIRES INSIDE
THE FUTURE WAS OURS
ARDOR OUR GUIDE

RECKLESS ABANDON
SPIRITS IN FLIGHT
SOARING PASSION
CASCADING LIGHT

YOUR LIGHT BURNED SO BRIGHT BLINDING MY EYES
YOU WERE THE ONLY SUN IN MY SKY
YOU WERE THE ONLY SUN IN MY SKY

O VISION OF STARLIGHT
O MY RADIANCE DIVINE
GATHER YE LOST ANGELS IN WHITE
CARRY THIS HEART OF MINE
BEYOND THE ETERNAL NIGHT
AND THESE STONE COLD WALLS SO LABYRINTHINE
