TRAVERSING THE NOTHINGNESS OF UNBROKEN NIGHT
SEARCHING THE STARS I STILL DREAM OF YOUR LIGHT
I REMEMBER THE OCEANS THAT RAGED SO DEEP INSIDE
I REMEMBER THE FIRES THAT FATE HAD FAILED TO ELIDE

NOW I AM FROZEN FEARING INFINITY
AND IâM ONLY CERTAIN OF THIS UNCERTAINTY
LOST IN THIS LANDSLIDE OF MY OWN DESIGN
I WATCHED ALL OUR DREAMS DIE UPON THE VINE
