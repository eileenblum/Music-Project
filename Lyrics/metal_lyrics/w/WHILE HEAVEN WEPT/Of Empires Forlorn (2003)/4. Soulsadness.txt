Sunk into the corner
Where the forlorn drift to die
A broken man is staring into his glass
With weeping eyes

Drinking away this empty life
I'm bleeding to death inside
Torn apart by bladed words
In sorrow capsized

I gave myself completely and deeply
But that was never enough for you
More alone than ever,
Your knives have finally pierced through (my heart)

Drinking away this lonely life
I'm bleeding to death inside
Torn apart by bladed words
In sorrow capsized

Now, I know I will die alone
Cold and broken...
Now, I know this Hell is my destiny
You took everything from me...everything...

I am the desolate one - Bleeding
You took everything from me...everything...

Drinking away this waste of life
I'm bleeding to death inside
Torn apart by bladed words
In sorrow capsized
I gave my heart up to your knives

I'm bleeding to death inside
