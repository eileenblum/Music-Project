Damned, I crawled valleys silenced with death
Through the seas of carnage, over mountains of regret
Reaching solace only to behold barren wastes endless

Just when I needed you the most
You had forsaken me
To this kingdom of ghosts

Bleak are the skies above this ruin
I've found no solace in cathedrals fallen
I am so far from the light and warmth of Heaven

To the hell of myself
Alone I am damned
To weep for you

Now, above this vast ruin alone I stand
All light and hope has fled my kingdom and land
Betrayed by bride and brethren,
My heart bursts in your hands

Forlorn empires
My kingdoms damned
Forlorn empires
I am damned
