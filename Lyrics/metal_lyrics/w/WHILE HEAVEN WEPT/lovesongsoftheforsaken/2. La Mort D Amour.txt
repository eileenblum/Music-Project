The once beautiful flower has withered and goneit is memory`s charnel vast, that I wepeth onlifeless, this lonely heart swoons neath my breastfor my tears bring you back, not from silent rest Lamentation and woe, peace never shall I knowBlood less bitter be than these tears brackish with sorrowevery promise ever born, now lay brokenfalse words are better left asleep, on thy lips, than spoken With autumn`s dirge, summer doth endand dreams, like leaves, decay into the windpallid as  the breath on which they blowis my heart, buried neath a solemn pall of snow This ice holds no sanctum, nor reasonfor thy heart`s swift change of seasonwith your dying element and emotion unfoldand I, I`ll live no longer, in this cold Sadness, unlike love, is eternal
