Tearstained are the halls of my empty soul,melancholia`s haunting call is the only one I have known.Innocence has lead me into this voidwhile years eroded a youth I never enjoyedthrough childhood I sleptunsheltered from the scornnow, I`ve awakened with age to love ever lornforever and ever I`ll search for the solacewhich can only be found in an embrace In throes of desolationI prayed unto divinityI endured the emptiness and frigid pain,but even God had forsaken meI prayed to find a solace for my heart bereavedonly to be forgotten by the God I once believednow, I serve this punishmentunder the ice condemnedfor my loss of faith,to hell I was damneddownfallen in inquitydesolate, I`ll beMy somber stare traverses sepulchers lonely Eternally, my limbs sealed in placethe only shelter from the cold of the ninth circle of hell Too see what awaits in forevera lifeless gazeMy final endeavorI looked through the blackened skiesand beheld the radiance of paradicemy eyes have frozen in false sancityeternally bound, my tears have turned to ice
