From the first moment, a pawn in your hands
Conceded myself to your sovereignity
Naked desire, no rampart withstands
Seduced by the illusion of true beauty
Deep I drank of your poisonous eyes
The silk of your skin fed dependency
Yielded myself to your promise of lies
Your "love" was nothing but witchery

Nothing but black witchery
Despair was your ecstasy

Destroyer of solace
Destroyer of me

Long where the nights of perpetual black
Writhing in torturous agony
Knowing that you would never come back
To cure the addict you have made of me
A victim of your vicious disguise
Princess of hell set me free
Yielded myself to your promise of lies
Your "love" was nothing but witchery

Nothing but black witchery
Despair was your ecstasy

Destroyer of solace
Destroyer of me

Cold heartless witch of hell
I lost myself to your spell
You turned my heart to stone
But at the stake you'll atone
