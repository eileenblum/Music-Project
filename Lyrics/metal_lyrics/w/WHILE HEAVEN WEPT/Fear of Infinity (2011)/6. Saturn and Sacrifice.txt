Predestined to suffer
A life of loneliness
Bearing the sorrow and sin
Agonizing death a compelled catharsis

I've crucified myself for you
With every tearstained page
Reprising the role of the damned
Every time I've bled upon the stage

No blessed mother weeps for me
As the nails split to the bone
A supposed savior of souls
Yet I cannot save my own

I've crucified myself for you
With every tearstained page
Reprising the role of the damned
Every time I've bled upon the stage

Scourged at the pillars of mockery
Broken and bleeding and crowned in thorns
Pierced by the spears of destiny
Bursting the heart of the forlorn

The call of the dawn rang thrice
And you had forsaken me
To die with a heart of ice
By the nails of prophecy

Banished from paradise
Into my hell so deep
Remember my sacrifice
Whenever heaven weeps
