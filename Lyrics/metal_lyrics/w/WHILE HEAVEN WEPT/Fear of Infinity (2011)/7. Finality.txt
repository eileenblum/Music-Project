I'd spent a lifetime reaching for the stars above
Yearning for the one who I'd always dreamed of
Then you came to me in winter's cold slumber
An angel with eyes glowing embers

My one, my all
I'd do anything for you my love
My heart belongs to you
I concede my soul to you
I will die loving you

Deathlike silence darkened summer's dawn
I'd awakaned rom the dream to find you had gone
To hold an angel, nothing but futility
The more I reach for you, the further you were from me

My one, my all
I'd do anything for you my love
My heart belongs to you
I concede my soul to you
I will die loving you
Oh my love
I don't know how to let you go

If only I could have held you one last time
Before you closed your eyes and spread your wings to fly away
If only you could hear me now, I wish I had the chance to tell you
Everything I never had the chance to say:

Take my heart as you leave for I'll need it no more
I'll crawl the darkness of hell while through heaven you'll soar
May you find peace and happiness into the light transcend
I'll spend my last days in sorrow alone until the end
