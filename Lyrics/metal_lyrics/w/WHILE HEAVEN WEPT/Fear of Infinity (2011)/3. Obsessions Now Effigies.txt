Without a word you disappeared
Into your cold like dust of those long dead
Severing the once cohered
Upon our graves I've wept and I have bled

Were you ever really here?

After all how could you leave me here?
You knew that which I feared the most:
To be alone and left arrear
With nthing but your ghost

My love is just a ghost
