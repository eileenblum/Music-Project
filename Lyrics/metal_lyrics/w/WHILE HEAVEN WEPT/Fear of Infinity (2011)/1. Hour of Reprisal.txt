Your empty promises have left only ruin
The deepest truths through silence now spoken
Your coldness cruel will never be forgiven

Murderer of
Heart and spirit
Fate not fire insures this
Torment you shall inherit

Judas bitch, the greatest sin is that of betrayal
When the cold sharp blades of conscience call
Neither penance nor mourning can avert reprisal

Murderer of
Heart and spirit
Fate not fire insures this
Torment you shall inherit
