The once beautiful flower has withered and gone
It is memory's charnel vast that I weepeth on
Lifeless, this lonely heart swoons 'neath my breast
For my tears bring you back not, from silent rest

Lamentations and woe, peace never shall I know
Blood less bitter be than these tears brackish with sorrow
Every promise ever born now lay broken
False words are better left asleep on thy lips than spoken

With autumn's dirge summer doth end
And dreams, like leaves, decay into the wind
Pallid as the breath on which they blow
Is my heart, buried 'neath a solemn pall of snow

This ice holds not sanctum, nor reason
For thy heart's swift change of season
With your dying, element and emotion unfold
And I, I live no longer in this cold

"Sadness, unlike love, is eternal"
