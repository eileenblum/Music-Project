Ghostwinds draw forth the clouds
That will shroud me in black forever
Once again I stare into the night
Darkness binds my life and death together

The dark clouds a portrait of her
The black-cloaked face of death
Her empty eyes a hallway to heaven
But my sanctum is beyond unfathomed depths

I will never be at rest
Until the sun forever sets

A solemn walk through this maze of paled stones
Monuments to the ending of pain
Souls cry forth from eternal sanctum
Knowing only death remains

Now I stand before the altar
They call me from ethereal gates
I raise my head in dignity
Knowing only death is the absence of pain
