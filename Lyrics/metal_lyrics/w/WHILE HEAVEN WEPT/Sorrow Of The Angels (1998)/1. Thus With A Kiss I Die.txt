Tears fall from my somber stare
Abandoned and nobody cares
I watched you walk away
As if I were never there
You said you're not the only one in this world
Yet you're the only one I've ever loved
From my sole sanctuary exiled
And likewise heaven above

You have forsaken me

Sleepwalk to the gallows
To expel my hollow soul
Unto fire, unto cold
Into hell I must go
A broken heart, a broken wing, I'm falling
Into this pain deep within
Infinitely spiraling 
To my sorrow-filled end

You have foredoomed me

When again these eyes you gaze into
You'll see I'm still reaching for you

How could you leave me here?

You have forsaken me
