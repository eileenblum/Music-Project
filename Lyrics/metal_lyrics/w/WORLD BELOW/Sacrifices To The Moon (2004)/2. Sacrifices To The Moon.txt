It's time to let her go, young virgin soon to become ash
Sacrifices to the moon, her flesh baptized in fire

Time to meet the man, dive into the fire
Too late for mercy, now you'll meet god...

Oh God, take her hand, lead her into your kingdom
Sacrifices to the moon, the only way to escape punishment
