Beware of the powers possessed by the black cult
They can transform a man into stone
A frozen reptile comes alive
Everything unimaginable can happen in front of your eyes

Chained in a lost dimension light years away
You're lost inside their maze now, cursed by the unholy ones

Try not to be afraid, like wolves they can smell your fear
If they want blood, you've got to give
They are invisible for a human eye
You can feel a cold breeze when it's time to die

You can't break the spell, you've been bewitched
The demons god is watching you, trapped in a void

You are surrounded by 13 demons and a burning red sky
You are trapped in eternal fire
Hanging high with the hook in your mouth

Infernal rites unknown to mankind
We are all enslaved, terrified crying under their blade
Beware of the powers possessed by the black cult
They can transform a man into stone

Chained in a lost dimension light years away
You're lost inside their maze now, cursed by the unholy ones
Trapped in a void...
