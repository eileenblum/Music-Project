In the deepest forest on the mountainside they have their nest
A cave so filled with black magic
- You shall not fear the witches, the elder said on to me
If your conscious is clean and your soul is free from sin
I can help you get in...

Eyes, black as a night - Her hair, black as a night
Skin white as snow, I am lost in magic

- Your soul is ill, she said. Dark forces haunts you. In the near future I see blood

Eyes, black as a night - Her hair, black as a night
Skin white as snow, I am lost in magic

She said: - I got the cure, drink it up and you can have it all
I got the cure, drink it up and I'll be possessed by you

I open my eyes, I saw a worm-eaten creature staring at me
Her magic, oh so sweet...
- You've got what you deserved, black magic overdose
Now watch yourself slowly turning into stone...

Eyes, black as a night - Her hair, black as a night
Skin white as snow, I am lost in magic

She said: - I got the cure, drink it up and you can have it all
I got the cure, drink it up and I'll be possessed by you
