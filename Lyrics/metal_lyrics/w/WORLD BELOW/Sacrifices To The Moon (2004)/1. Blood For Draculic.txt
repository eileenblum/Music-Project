To prevent the downfall of the earth
A neverending hunt for blood occurs
Feed our master with human flesh
No mercy for the children
The evil one survive, the young will die

Blood for draculic... save yourself
Blood for draculic... feed our master

There's no light here in the domains of death
The place where all life ends
We are drowning in blood
The evil one survive, the young will die

Screams of horror
A mothers final cry
Maybe tomorrow you'll be gone
Let the evil have it's way
It's too late, no escape

Blood for draculic... save yourself
Blood for draculic... feed our master
