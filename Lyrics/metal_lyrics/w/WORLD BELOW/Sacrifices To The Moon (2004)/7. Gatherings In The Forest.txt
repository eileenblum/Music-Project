When the moon is full we will meet again
Go down the forest and follow the wind
One hour before dawn, you should listen real close
Shut your eyes and you'll hear the moans from below

Our master speaks with the dead, we are afraid of the fire
We are afraid of the hole in the ground

The crypt is open, we can hear the demons chanting
Join the horde, sell your soul...
We can feel the presence of an evil spirit
Shadows in the mist, he lets us know his existence
