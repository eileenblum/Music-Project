All alone again with the thoughts in my head
I keep slip, slip, slipping away
I'm a slave but it's all a head game
Underneath the skin, I fight a war within
Looks like it's me versus me, my own worst enemy

There's no coming back from where I've been
There's no need to pretend

Save me
Life's pushing back harder than ever
Break free
Looks like it's me versus me, my own worst enemy

Right!

What can I do?
It's none for me and all for you
I gotta figure some things for myself
I'm to blame, me and no one else

Bringing me down

Doubting something doesn't means it's wrong
Don't fear consequence, you can't fix what you don't start

Save me
Life's pushing back harder than ever
Break free
Looks like it's me versus me, my own worst enemy

All alone again
Save me
Underneath the skin
Life's pushing back harder than ever
All alone again
Break free
Looks like it's me versus me, my own worst enemy

What if I should stumble?
what if I should fall?
What if there is nothing left underneath it all?
