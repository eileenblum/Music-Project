Here is to your false ideals
I am so sick of all your protesting signs
Your claims disgust me
If you really knew the God you claim to serve
You should know that there's no hate in love
This your warning
This is your fall
Try and justify anything you hold to be true

We were meant to coexist
It was never suppose to be like this
At what cost do you think you'll be saved?
Don't use His name to move all the mountains in your way
Go back from where you came, have heart with what you say

You think you have all of the answers
Don't think you can judge and not be judged

You use His name in vain
You're a deceiver
Open your ears and bite your tongue
And listen up

Protest the funerals of the ones who protect you?
Innocent men and women who have died to defend you
Stop biting the hand that feeds, consumed by all your own needs

At what cost do you think you'll be saved?
Don't use His name to move all the mountains in your way
Go back from where you came, have heart with what you say

You're a plague to the non-believer
Tell them all "You're gonna burn forever"
You cast your stones in my Father's name
There will be hell to pay
May you burn forever
