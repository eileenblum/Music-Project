What in the world are we waiting for?
No bliss in ignorance, thinking that less is more
What in the world are we waiting for?
Opportunity knocks, it's kicking down your door

This life is constant struggle
We have to fight just to survive
Searching for whatever makes us feel alive
I won't be another one to sit and watch the world burn

How can we say that we truly care, when we live so comfortably and still do nothing but sit and stare
Broken, beaten, bruised, defeated, tired, and worn
We do nothing for ourselves being so self-absorbed

Desperate

What in the world are we waiting for?
No bliss in ignorance, thinking that less is more
What in the world are we waiting for?
Opportunity knocks, it's kicking down your door

This is a call to arms

This life is constant struggle
We're only focused on ourselves
Why do we ignore the ones who truly go through hell?
Every life has a purpose to serve
Every face has a name
So go be the change

We are responsible for those within our reach, so live out what you claim with words
Practice what you preach

What in the world are we waiting for?
No bliss in ignorance, thinking that less is more
What in the world are we waiting for?
Opportunity knocks, it's kicking down your door

This is a call to the human race
Will you make a difference or just fill a grave?

What in the world are we waiting for?
No bliss in ignorance, thinking that less is more
What in the world are we waiting for?
Opportunity knocks, it's kicking down your door

This is a call to arms
No bliss in ignorance
