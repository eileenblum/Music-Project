I've waited all my life for this chance to prove
Myself to the ones who think I'm of no use
So mark my words, run your mouth when nobody's around
No one remembers the cowards
When they're 6 feet beneath the ground

Bring it

So mark my words, run your mouth when nobody's around
No one remembers the cowards
When they're 6 feet beneath the ground
