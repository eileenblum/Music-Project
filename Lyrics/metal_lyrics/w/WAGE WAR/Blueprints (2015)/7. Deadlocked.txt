There's no turning back
Everything has built up all around me
My problems, my addictions, complications rule all my decisions
It's a slippery slope leading to my end
Show me the way out
Get my grip again

These afflictions wage a war inside me
Can I find direction? No

In such pain, we are desperate for solutions
Where is the door that leads to redemption?
Everything is dark
Will I ever find my way out?

These afflictions wage a war inside me
Can I be forgiven?

You take what others have worked for
You're all that I'm not
You are the burden of many
We're deadlocked
This is for all those who struggle
For all those who can't
Don't let your troubles define you
Be the better man

I'm held down by the weight of my selfish mistakes
Buried under miles of guilt (miles of guilt)
You are the parasite, and now you've sunk your teeth
You are abomination

I have watched myself change from the inside out
Becoming what I swore I'd never be (swore I'd never be)
There's got to be more to this
There's got to be more to this

You take what others have worked for
You're all that I'm not
You are the burden of many
We're deadlocked
This is for all those who struggle
For all those who can't
Don't let your troubles define you
Be the better man

Be the better man
Where do we go from here?
Down this lonely road
I've never felt so scared, out here on my own

There's no turning back
I have left my old self behind
The damned are upon me but I won't be the victim
God, will you wash the blood from these hands
I'll change my ways, I'll be the better man
