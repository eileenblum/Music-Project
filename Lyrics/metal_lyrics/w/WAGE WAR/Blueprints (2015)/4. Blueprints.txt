I want to be the person that I was made to be
I've only scratched the surface
I'm giving everything

I am never defined by the mistakes I've made
I have a purpose to exist, I've got something to say
There is a hope despite shortcomings we face, got no love, got no grace

Through thick and thin we must stay strong
We won't lose sight
We will prevail
We will overcome

These ghosts still haunt me
It's all I have on these sleepless nights
Show me that I can still be saved
Show me that I'm worth saving
I know who I am
Mistakes are what made me
Your words, they can't change me
So go waste your breath somewhere else
I've heard it all before so keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

I'm not a prophet, I don't have all the answers
Transparent, imperfect, lost
Still fighting the cancer
We often ask ourselves "Is life really worth it?"
How quickly we forget every life has a purpose

I am revival

The turning point to a close minded race
Open your mind, we all bleed the same

One day they'll stand at the foot of my grave
I can't help but wonder what they will say
Life is a vapor
You only get one chance
Will you move forward with open heart and hands

These ghosts still haunt me
It's all I have on these sleepless nights
Show me that I can still be saved
Show me that I'm worth saving

I want to be the person that I was made to be
I've only scratched the surface
I'm giving everything

This life is mine
This time I play for keeps
