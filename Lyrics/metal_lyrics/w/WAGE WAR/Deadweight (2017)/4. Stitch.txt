Leave me in the dark with a hole for a heart
As low as I can get burn the bridge rip the stitch out
Pick it up

I can't pretend like its all part of the plan
I can't hide it blindsided I can't fight it its more than I can stand
Broken but I guess you knew that it would be this way
Loose ends tie the knot and wait for your chance to run away

I could never make you stay 
You'll run away
I'll always be your greatest mistake 
So run away
Just another game that you played 
You'll run away
Three years in the making but I guess we weren't worth saving

We weren't worth saving

Leave me in the dark with a hole for a heart
As low as I can get burn the bridge rip the stitch out
Guess I'll play dead its all in my head
To you I don't exist call it bliss rip the stitch out 
What

Bitter to the core
Always want more
Take what you can get but I'll bet that its never enough is it
Pull the knife out of my back
Let it all fade to black
Made it so clear 
I think we're done here

Bitter to the core
Always want more
Take what you can get but I'll bet that its never enough is it
Pull the knife out of my back
Let it all fade to black
Made it so clear 
I think we're done here

Leave me in the dark with a hole for a heart
As low as I can get burn the bridge rip the stitch out
Guess I'll play dead its all in my head
To you I don't exist call it bliss rip the stitch out 

Leave me in the dark with a hole for a heart
As low as I can get burn the bridge rip the stitch out
Guess I'll play dead its all in my head
To you I don't exist call it bliss rip the stitch out 

You were the light I could never see in myself
I would've stood by you until the gates of hell
