I run away from everything that's good for me
When every voice that you hear is the same one.
All you can think to do is run
Make no mistake. I'm everything I say I hate.
Hypocritical. Lost individual. No longer worth
Your faith.

I know I can be better than this
Masquerading has never done me justice
I am what I am
A boy not yet the man I want to be
Despite what I have led you to believe.
I'm nothing as I seem
No ground beneath my feet.

I can't seem to get away from me.
This person in the mirror's not the same one
That I want to be
Is there more than what I see?
Sometimes it's hard to let go. When I don't
Know what lies in front of me.

Get away from me

Death to self is much easier said than done

Pain is what has set me free.
I had to go through hell
To find what's best in me.

Still think I can be better than this
Despite the weight that is my conscience
Life was never fair
But I am never broke beyond repair
Still searching for any place
That I can call my home.
And even though I'm lost. I know I'm not alone.

If I could change myself. I would but I don't know where to begin
My grave is mine to dig
