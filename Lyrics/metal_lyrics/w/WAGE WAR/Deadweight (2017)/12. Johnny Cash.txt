Let me tell you the saddest story
Love lost. Left broken and empty
Put my heart in the hands of another
Set a fire to the past and watched me burn

Somehow I guess it's better this way
Looking back. Was it all just a mistake?
Thought I could live in the arms of another
But I guess I wasn't enough for her

I wanna feel the love you can't live without
The one that Johnny Cash wrote all his songs about.
But I gave it all away for no return
Guess it's just another lesson that I'll never learn.

I've been putting myself through your hell
Holding on to things that don't even matter now.
You found your place in the arms of another
But now I see it's just the way the earth will turn

I wanna feel the love you can't live without
The one that Johnny Cash wrote all his songs about.
But I gave it all away for no return
Guess it's just another lesson that I'll never learn

Can't seem to fill the void that lives in my chest.
Thought I was what you need, but I'm just second best.
I'll never give it all away again. I swear
Don't even look for a heart.
You'll find there's nothing there

I can't take it back
All the years that we spent
Together have come to an end
Regret is all I had
Not sure I would if I could do it all over again

I can't take it back
The memories. The pictures.
I love you's will wither
Regret is all I had
But this is the last song I'll write about you

Forget my name
Forget my face
It was all just empty space
Dead weight
No longer part of me.
