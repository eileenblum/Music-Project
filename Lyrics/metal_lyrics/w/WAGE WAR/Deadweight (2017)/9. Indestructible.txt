To all the ones who have helped
Me along the way
I owe a debt I can never repay

Carried on the shoulders of strangers
No room for doubt. Lead by faith. Never failure
You paved the way. But to my dismay
The great unknown could be an early grave.

On a long road. With the end in our sights.
Tragedy takes it away. Like a thief in the night.
I pray it's not over. Won't remain broken.
I'm looking for closure.

I'm scared
Didn't think it'd come with a cost
That people would change.
That lives could be lost
I'm having nightmares
Where fate leaves us for dead
Never imagined a price on our heads

I woke up screaming. I felt my heart sink in
I miss the days when I felt indestructible
We're veering overlines
That shake me every time
I miss the days when I felt indestructible

It wasn't supposed to be like this
I lived in a world where darkness didn't exist
Mortality is a beautiful thing.
Embrace it. Don't waste it.
You're the one who pulls the strings

Heavy win
Heavy loss
I'm moving forward no matter what the cost

I woke up screaming. I felt my heart sink in
I miss the days when I felt indestructible
So write this on my stone if I don't make it
Home
I tried my best. But I'm not indestructible

Even through the darkest nights.
All hope is not lost
