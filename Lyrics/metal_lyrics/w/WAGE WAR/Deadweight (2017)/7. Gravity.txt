I'm losing grip
I'm out of touch
Too late to say I've had enough

It's like every breath
Could be my last
My demons won't stay in the past

All alone
On my own

Pull me close
I feel the water reach around my neck
Don't let go
Just show me that there's better days ahead
Make me see
I'm only half the person I should be
Pull me close
Set me free from this gravity

I can't move forward and keep looking back.
Hindsight has left me where I'm at

I tried to run
But I couldn't see
That you were right beside me

There is a light in the tunnel. But it's distant
On my own I don't think that I can fix this
Set me free from this gravity.
