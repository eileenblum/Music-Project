Oh what a mess we've made
To hell with the love.
Just keep breeding the hate.
It doesn't matter what is true.
What is right or just.
Never sleep.
Never think. No we'll never trust.
Outrage. Fed up with the system.
Outbreak. Everybody is a victim.
Enslave and we think we're free

But all I see is violence
But I just can't sit and watch in silence
I think it's time that
We take back what we lost.
We're branded by disdain
There's nothing to gain

I'm not one to be all political
But it's a problem when
Everyone's hypocritical.
You can't lead if you can't admit you're wrong.
Our innocence is gone
I can't read the headlines
Another murder in the streets. He was only 9
God. Are you listening?

Think for yourself
And nobody else
We can't trust the lies we're fed
Or we're all as good as dead.
