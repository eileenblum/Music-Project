I refuse to think your abandonment has become
The commonplace.
You needed to be set free.
You needed to be rid of me.
Running around in circles.
I am just trying to place the blame.
I thought we said forever.
I thought you felt the same.

Stuck in a frame. You remain my conscience
We were broken before we bent

I can feel it now
You're there but you're not
I'm picking up what we've lost
Lay me in the ground
Just throw it away
There's nothing more you can say

I'd like to think that the love that we had was
Different than the rest.
'Cause I've never felt that way
I never would have second guessed
But things are different now
Being selfless let me down
Never again will I let you in

I'm not as strong as you think.
I'm tired. I'm weak.
Like an anchor tied to my feet.
You left me to sink

No turning back this time
I'll leave it all behind

I did everything I could to rise above.
I gave you all I had. But it was never enough.

Set free
