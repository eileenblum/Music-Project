Define me as a failure.
Only the shadow of a man.
I will suffer the judgement passed by those who simply
Do not understand.
Who I am. The way I think.
The pain that sets in underneath.
And when I try to be myself it seems like the
Insecurity gets the worst of me.

The distance. It makes me sick
But there's a new way that I'm coping with conviction
And I don't expect you to understand it
I can't leave these words unsaid
'Cause it's a product of the battle
That's in my head
And I can't pretend that it never haunts me
I'll tell you from the top. It's only skin deep
I don't know what I believe
But it's not the way it's supposed to be

Over these past few years
I admit that things have changed.
Dreams became reality. But the pleasure became pain.
I've loved.
I've lost.
You wouldn't know what it cost
After every sacrifice I have made.
I'll take this to the grave

You can be who you want to be
But your nightmares live in the same dream
Go be who you want to be
