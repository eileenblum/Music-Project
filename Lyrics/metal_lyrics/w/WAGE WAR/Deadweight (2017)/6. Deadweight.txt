Mirror mirror on the wall
The man I see is at fault
When did I become everything I hate?
Internally bound. I'll self destruct
Bleed out until I think I've had enough
But it never is. I swear it never is

It's like I'm out of my mind
Relapse. Repeat. Never the last time.
I can't take much more.
I've never been this low before

Deadweight
All you do is
Break me
Leave me feeling
Empty
Now I long to be set free
You're my own misery

To be honest. I've grown to love the pain
So what's it worth when you can't sleep? Can't think
You'll do whatever it takes
To feel just the little things.
Trapped inside my head.
I'm hanging by your thread

You and I
Are running out of time
We can't coexist
You took what was mine
So. You see
It's you or it's me
Now I'm seeing red
Yeah why don't you just drop dead

No longer part of me
