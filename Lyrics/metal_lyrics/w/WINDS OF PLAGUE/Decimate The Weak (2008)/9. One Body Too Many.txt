Burn me out of your mind, this is a place i cannot be anymore.
Every inch of ground is paved with lies.
Your only concern is for yourself.
No mercy, no remorse for the innocent.
You're the one who fucking left an unbalanced mind for gravity to take its course.
Fall to your knees and lose the last of your dignity.
Razorblade smile stretched from ear to ear.
You wont cross me again.
Broken bonds and envious ties my only chance is to turn inside.
Everyday the colors fade to black and white.
Broken bonds and a broken jaw, I can't take this anymore.
I see the world through cold eyes.
Every inch of ground is paved with lies, every emotion dead.
