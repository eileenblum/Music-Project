Show your fucking face, Bitch.
Execute the mass and spread your disease, its time to fight back and rise to your feet, you will not believe what you can do when you push and strike back.
The power of peace concealed in a word, give it up, give it all you got, stitch faced as they fall into there graves.
When all the angels fall from the sky and all the demons arise from the earth, there will be a force to reckon with and you will be destroyed, kill them all, fuck them all, leave no one alive, rape them all.
We speak of the end, who's to live, who's to die, were sure to find out soon enough, the question is when.
The power of peace concealed in a word, give it up, give it all you got, stitch faced as they fall into there graves.
Now I see it clear, and origin set in fear, we didn't ask for you, we sure as fuck don't need you.
Your getting fucked up.
We stood the test of time, we ran our fucking lives, we shut you out, stood our ground yet were still alive, stand united, break the silence, we are taking it from here, were coming up, were breaking out, you've looked down on me, I'm coming down on you, were coming up, were breaking out, you've looked down on me, I'm coming down on you.
