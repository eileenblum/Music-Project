Release the volts straight to my mind.
'Cause I have seen the world.
In chaos and all its beauty.
now I wonder which I prefer seems the world is more real in crisis but it's still amazes how many people don't know who they are.
Running reckless a human race to the end of time.
Now bring the chaos.
I'd pray to the sky, but god wasnt there
MOTHER FUCKERS!
Force the numbers.
A subtle chance has gone and passed a moment from the grave can bring you to reality.
A flawless example how security in life brings no morals, proof that life is a lie and it's what we want.
We rent's afraid to know.
Were afraid to question.
We are afraid to question we arn't afraid to know.
