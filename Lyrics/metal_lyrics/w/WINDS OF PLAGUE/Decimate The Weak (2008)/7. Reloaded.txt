TONIGHT... THE WORLD IS OURS!
What the fuck is up motherfuckers?
This is Winds Of Plague and all that 2008 shit.
We've got the world in the palm of our hands.
Busters fall down when we're barking commands.
Atlas ain't got shit on our steez.
Kick out the chair and get on your knees.
We're not strangers but we'll never be friends.
Pray to your god when you're meeting your end.
Hope is dead, revelation begins.
We're not strangers but we'll never be friends.
Lift your head, look around can't you see, we were born into a world so bleak.
We claim this night still standing tall.
Casting shadows, you indulge concrete.
A call to arms, we'll bring the revolution.
A call to arms pillaging, annihilate man.
Going to take every word and shove it down your fucking throat.
Break down the walls, rebuild society.
We've got the world in the palm of our hands.
Busters fall down when we're barking commands.
Hope is dead, revelations begins.
We're not strangers but we'll never be friends.
Arise the sun is near.
Witness an uprising, see our strength.
Arise.
