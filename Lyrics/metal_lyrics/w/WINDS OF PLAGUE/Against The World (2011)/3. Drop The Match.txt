Here we go, here we go again,
Down that same old dead end path 
Nothing to my name just a head full of dreams 
Nothing to prove and nothing to lose 
Take my hand if your headed my way 
We can leave and never look back We only got the one chance 
We can leave and never look back One more thing before i leave this world 
Drop the match in the path of gas the flame will find its way 
Burn it down 
Burn it down with them locked inside 
Dont give a fuck if they live or die This city is full of thieves 
This city is full of thieves which prey upon our hopes and dreams 
Now it is I who cast the stones 
Now it is I who steal your dreams Down that same old dead end path 
Take my hand or get out of my way Here we go 
So drop the match 
Watch the flames erase our past Erase our past 
Burn this mother fucker down 
And if i forget to tell you 
Drop the match in the path of gas the flame will find its way 
Burn it down 
Burn it down with them locked inside 
Dont give a fuck if you live or die This city is full of thieves 
Walk with me down the road of hollow dreams 
In chaos we will strive 
In chaos we will reign 
Where lost souls remain 
Once lost but now were found 
My own personal hell 
Burn it down with them locked inside 
Burn this mother fucker down
