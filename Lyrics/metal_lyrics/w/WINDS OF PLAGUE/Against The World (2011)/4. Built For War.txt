Soldier of fortune, an Army of One
Battle-born, I'm a motherfucking patriot
I write to you from this recon to hell
Been recruited from this Generation Kill, Kill, Kill

I was born to crush you
Kill, kill, kill
I was built for war

A day without blood is like a day without sunshine
All I need is this firepower at my side
I write to you from this recon to hell
Never had a chance
Here we go, kill, kill, kill

I was born to crush you
Kill, kill, kill
I was built for war

Lock and load
Mount the guns
You better run
Pull them back
Let them fly
I was born to crush you

I stand and fight while the cowards run and hide
Step aside as I come ripping through
Or fall victim like the countless many other do
A single move and get wasted by my crew

Swing the hammer with the force of a raging bull
I won't rest until the snap of your neck
Fuck the best and die like the rest
You better know I am built for war
Take your shots and make them count
I'll chew the bullets and spit them out
Now you're chocking on my full-metal rounds
You better know I am built for war
Armed to the teeth, I'm a killing machine
Your artillery will never fucking stop me
When you come, you better bring an army
You'd best believe I am built for war
