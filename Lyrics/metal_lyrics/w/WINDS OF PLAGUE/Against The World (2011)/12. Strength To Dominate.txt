Go

The blood stops flowing when there's no one left to bleed
You'll be begging for your life
Get on your fucking knees

I've never trembled in the face of fear
I possess the strength to dominate
Standing strong with a lion heart
I obtain the strength to dominate

Take heed of my warning
You'll be impaled headless on a stake
Bones picked clean by the morning
We drove the nails; now we've sealed your fate

One, two, fuck you

I see the weakness in your eyes
Do you see my strength to dominate?
Walk away while your heart still beats
Or feel my strength to dominate
Get down on your fucking knees

The blood stops flowing when there's no one left to bleed
You'll be begging for your life
Get on your fucking knees

Don't come to the killing fields if you don't have any fucking heart
There will be blood

What hasn't killed me yet
Has given me the strength to dominate
All the pain I have endured has provided my strength to dominate

Take heed of my warning
You'll be impaled headless on a stake
Bones picked clean by the morning
We drove the nails; now we've sealed your fate
Get down on your fucking knees

The blood stops flowing when there's no one left to bleed
You'll be begging for your life
Get on your fucking knees

Fool, I have tried to warn you
There will be blood
