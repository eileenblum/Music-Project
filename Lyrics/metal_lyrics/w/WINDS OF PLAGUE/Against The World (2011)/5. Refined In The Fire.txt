I walk this Earth alone, with broken bones.
I fear no evil, evil fucking fears me.
Your time has come, looking down the barrel of a smoking gun.
I am the shadowed one.
Evil fucking fears me!
Evil fucking fears me!
Refined in the fire, from the flames I emerge.
Casted in steel.
I am refined in the fire.
From the flame we march on, to victory!
Urgggggoh.
Evil fucking fears me!
Evil fucking fears me!
I am refined in the fire.
I am the weapon of choice.
For the warrior King, recognize I'm refined in the fire.
You'll see the dragon tremble at the song we sing.

I am refined in the fire.
And will His kingdom fall, know that time will tell.
Recognize I'm refined in the fire.
Under the blood I stand, to bring war.
Bring war on Hell.
I represent the army of the shadowed realm.
I am a soldier for the damned and the broken.
You will know me from my path of destruction.
I write to you from Hell.
Forward, oh!
Forward, oh!
Forward, oh!
You want a war?
You'll get a war.
I was trained with pain hate and agony 
Desensitized, from this fucked world around me.
I'm going out, and I'm taking you with me.
I walk this Earth alone, with broken bones.
I fear no evil, evil fucking fears me.
Your time has come, looking down the barrel of a smoking gun.
I am the shadowed one.
Evil fucking fears me!
Evil fucking fears me!
Arahhhhhhuuuuhhh!
Evil fucking fears me!
Oh!
Evil fucking fears me!
