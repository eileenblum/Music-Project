Fearless
My nerves are calm and my thoughts collected
Kings and queens of this new generation
We won't stop till the guillotine chop
When the blade hits the block and my head slowly drops

You better fucking recognize
I'm untouchable
Unobtainable
Fuck around and find out that I'm unstoppable
I've been smashed into the ground
But make no mistake: 
I'll never be counted out
You will bow to my reign

This blade within your grasp, may its secrets lay in vain
The time will come when it's stained with blood
Nothing the rain can't wash away
May God grant my opponent strength for every step he takes
Once we come face-to-face, you'll never walk away

Fearless
Nerves of steel; eyes locked on my target
We won't stop till the guillotine chop
When the blade hits the block and my head slowly drops

You better fucking recognize
I'm maniacal
Diabolical
Self-proclaimed insane; completely certifiable
We will never be the same
But make no mistake:
Don't ever speak my fucking name

Take this blade within your grasp; may its secrets lay in vain
The time will come when it's stained with blood
Nothing the rain can't wash away
May God grant my opponent strength for every step he takes
Once we come face-to-face, you'll never walk away

I will follow you into the depths of the unknown

Make way for the wrecking crew
Me and you against the world
