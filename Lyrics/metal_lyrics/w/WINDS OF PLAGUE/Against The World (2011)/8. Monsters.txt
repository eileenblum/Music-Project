Put your Love, your trust in, all your faith in me
Iâll burn your dreams into the ground, you better believe

Believe me kid, Iâve stood in your shoes
Donât buckle under pressure, you got to keep your head together
Skeletons are busting down the closet door
No longer is your secret safe
You are the worldâs disease
Believe me kid, Iâve stood in your shoes
Donât buckle under pressure, you got to keep your head together

Put your Love, your trust in, all your faith in me
Iâll burn your dreams into the ground, you better believe

I canât fight this urge as the claws extract
Goddamn
Wrong has never felt so right
Love casted from my heart
Now encased in steel
Two clenched fists is all I need to ensure my place in hell
Listen close to what your dreams are telling you
Your biggest fears, your nightmares are all becoming true
I regret to inform you that I just donât give a fuck

Youâre now in my world
Welcome to your doom, Iâll see you through, and through, and through
Until you rot in hell

There is no escape from this
Now I await the flames to come and melt my sins away
No escaping this
The reaper has come to collect
The monster subsides, but when I get the twitch, Iâll scratch the itch
The wolves come out as night

Put your Love, your trust in, all your faith in me
Iâll burn your dreams into the ground, you better believe
