Between life and death 
In other worlds 
For heroes and lost souls
By a battlefield of darkness
The purpose of one
In rivalry of destiny, our destiny
Endowed with greatness
Seeking perfection of our soul
Un-scared and not created to stronger it
True and faithful to a unique warrior spirit
I am I
Never on big knees begging for help or pity
Standing stout and appearing pressed
Penetrate the glorified eyes of a creator to discover,
I am he, he is I,
Sent forth to rise above shame and mediocrity
To give not one fuck for the idea, of original sin
Tranquilize the warrior reckoning within my mind
To stand and deliver a destiny unlike any other
To live with the heart of a warrior that will one day speak, 
Through the tombstone a top my grave
I will do in my life, what will live forever
