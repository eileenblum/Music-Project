[Narration:]
Earth, home to well over six billion people.
A most majestic and brilliant sight, when seen through the eyes of peace.
Foreboding, to say the lease when caught in the gears of the machine.
With the world blindfolded by the lust for power, wealth and control.
A perfect game board is laid out for two divine powers, to manipulate the pawns into postion to carry out their conquest for global domination.

For you see, this world has many mysteries, and nothing is ever what it seems to be.
Every action starts with a thought,
Every thought comes from influence,
Every influence has its roots.
The world is either good or evil and this is where our story begins...
