Some things could never change
I've come to terms with the darkness that's inside of me
It's telling you to get away
The poison sea, the biblical field, forcing us to watch your pain

You could take the angel out of heaven
It doesn't mean she will shead her wings
You could take the demon out of hell
Rising from the flames, I am loyal to the beast

As I lay face down in the street
Vicious warm blood rushes from my head
I can't forget the words that she says, "Hold me."
She was dead, I was dead, we were dead
Pulse lost, getting cold to the touch
See the snakes coming out from her eyes
I can't forget the words that she says, "Hold me."
She was dead, I was dead, we were dead

From the moment we met, I was just
One more buried body
The wolf wearing skin cloned from the sheep
One more buried body
The demon light has gone behind her eyes
From the moment we met, I was just
One more buried body
The demon light has gone behind her eyes

You could try, down an angel from the sky
It doesn't mean she will shead her wings
You could draw the demon out of hell
Rising from the flames, I am loyal to the beast

Criticize the demons
Who want their hearts
To raise a brain
Criticize the demons
Who want their hearts
To raise a brain

Some things can never change
I've come to terms with the darkness that's inside of me
It's telling you to get away
The poison sea, the biblical field, forcing us to watch your pain
Watch their pain

I was nothing but
One more buried body
Demon light has gone behind her eyes
One more buried body
Demon light has gone behind her eyes
