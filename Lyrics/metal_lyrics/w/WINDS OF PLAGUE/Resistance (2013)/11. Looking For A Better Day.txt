[Bonus Track]Oh shit, looks like I've gone and done it again
With the pieces falling from me, I just ravage a city
And now I stand here a broken man
So let the pain come and tear away my skin

God damn, I've come to this realization
I have to let it die, no resuscitation

How far, how could this happen again
I let it all slip from the grips of my hands
And now I stand here an empty man
So let the torment dig itself into my flesh

God damn, I've come to this realization
I have to let it die, no resuscitation
I have to let it die, I have to let it die, no resuscitation now

You'll never take me alive
Step back let the walls crumble in
You'll never take me alive
Learn from the wreckage, they're born to be captive

What the fuck, why wouldn't you trust me again?
You must be blind not to see the evil inside of me
And now I stand here a volatile man
With every step I take moves me backwards

God damn, I've come to this realization
I have to let it die, no resuscitation
I have to let it die, I have to let it die, no resuscitation now

I've taken refuge in the dark where I've let my wounds heal
When I stepped into the light... [?]
(They will not have my head)
Take me away into lowballing comic yesterday
All of it recessed when I made amends with myself
Just another way, looking for a better day
Testing it within myself, but I said
I'm done with this world
I'm done with this world
