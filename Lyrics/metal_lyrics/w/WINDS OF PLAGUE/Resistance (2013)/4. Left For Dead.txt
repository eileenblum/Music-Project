You have been left for dead
This is a mutiny
You canât deny the fight
Thatâs still inside of me
This is a mutiny
Stand down motherfucker
Youâll never defeat me

Youâre the captain of a sinking ship
That fly by night, so die with it
It was weighing me down
Now Iâm anchor-less, itâs sink or swim
As you drown in shit, wasted away
No direction lost at sea tides
Turn we steer the course

This is a mutiny
Mountainous waters around all
So deep within a swell
The walls of water closing in
Will crash us all into the hell

The sharks are circling
Limb by limb, theyâll tear you apart
Waves of bad blood fill your lungs
Return to the deep
Commit this body to the sea
Return to the deep
Commit this body to the sea

You have been left for dead
This is a mutiny
You canât deny the fight
Thatâs still inside of me
This is a mutiny
Stand down motherfucker
Youâll never defeat me
