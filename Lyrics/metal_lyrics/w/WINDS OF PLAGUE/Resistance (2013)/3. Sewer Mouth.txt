You should have been buried at birth
Just a burden of the gods
There was never hope
Just a victim of the odds
Pawns or the ground
Never involved with the king
Learn to live at the bottom
Where you will never be seen

Blood sucking scum leach on to anyone for life
I'd call you DOA but you never arrived
The world never knew that you were even alive

You pray
You pray
You pray but you will never survive
You pray but you will never survive

First impressions last a second
Now they're fading away
Think of all the time you wasted
You're just wasting away

You're a servant
I'm a monarch
Put your life to shame
I'll have you locked in shackles
While I'm dragging the chain

The world never knew that you were even alive

You pray
You pray
You pray but you will never survive

I don't care who you think you know
You don't even know yourself
You spent your whole life sucking dick
You should be used to this

Listen to yourself as you spew shit
From that sewer of a mouth
Take a good look in the mirror
Live your life in terror

Spend the rest of your days living in fear

[2x]
You're wasting away
This is the price you pay
For the mistakes you made

You pray
You pray
You pray but you will never survive
