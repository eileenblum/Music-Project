Follow me to the city of woe, follow me to where divinity dare not go.
March among the damned through barren wastelands.
Follow me to fire and brimstone.
Its time to burn for your crimes of malevolent kind and now you burn for your sins against mankind.
Ill watch you burn.
You deserve the pain and suffering.
So fucking burn mother fucker, you're dead to me.
Open the gates of Hell.
