Where are your eyes?
Have you lost sight to what meant most to life?
Seen forefathers die?
Watched the end acted out through betrayal.
it's not too late to change you path just forget your past.
Make the pledge this promised witness by god to live this live with intent.
From her eon out I will walk tall.
defeat is not a way out.
Bring down the walls with my fist.
Bring down the walls.
Through my struggles I will never turn.

"When did our hearts fall away?
WHen did you lose your wings?
What the fuck happened to us, brotha?"
