Walking the brim of chaos with destruction on my mind face the faceless and stand fearless.
This world can be a wretched place filled with hatred.
When all hope is lost look to the darkest corner to find a solution sometimes it can take death to find life.
With a re born vengeance take the world in the palm of your hand and brake empty every face that stairs at you're with pride.
Brakes every empty face destroy every fictional mind.
Stop every blackened hearty can take your life and make it count.
