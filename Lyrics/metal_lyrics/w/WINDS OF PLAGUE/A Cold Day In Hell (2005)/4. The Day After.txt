Today I wake to a silent world.
To an empty sky Ill we've learned is how to die the next world war will be fought with stones and you will be striped of all fortunes.
The superior pillaged and left fir dead.
Bound by honor we'll fight for confidence.
for once all men will be equal and only the strong will survive.
In my honor, we'll fight for confidence.
When your wealth bears no meaning who will you turn to.
welcome back to the dark era when man is just a man threes no divine among us.
Only flesh and blood.
All your bridges are burnt every city left in ruins the end is just a dawn.
Life is now a privilege.
Integrity is the only gold.
Welcome back to the dark era this is the end this is the dawn.
