When this world ends I will stop in my tracks and ask myself what have I done with my life?
I have seen the lands in purity and watched the masses brought to there knees.
I will not regret what I have done, but what I have not done.
Tomorrow is too late.
I live my life today's will not bow before the public.
Live inside the line I am who I am.
Sworn to my ideals and when this world comes to an end I am caught in the middle of a warring heaven and hell I will stand my ground this soul remains mine forever.
As the earth crumbles and the sky falls time will freeze and I will come to see the true beauty at this time between exist.
I find myself back waist deep.
You want to see me fail not today motherfucker/this world has every odd against 'm between a warring heaven and hell.
I will stand my ground this should remains mine forever.
As the earth crumble and the sky falls time will freeze and I will start and I will come to see the true beauty at this time between existences.
Many are torn apart but I will stand with my heart on my sleeve.
