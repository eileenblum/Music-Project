Retrace the steps that led us here.
Prints fade to an open eye.
There is no turning back.
Face the world with no remorse.
How can you think my pain is free?
A twelve gauge face lift is what you have coming.
how many will suffer because you're blinded by greed.
Now that you're gone my life can begin.
What was your motive?
Annihilate the dreams of mankind?
(Salacious kacle) now you're faced with a 12 gauge face lift now you're faced with full chamber roulette.
You will die by vindictive hands.
You will feed my wrath.
One more squeals the bullet finds it way straight to you skull.
The moment has been seazed.
images nailed to my eyes.
Reality breaks my concept of revenge.
Now its time for the revolution.
adigassimo.
annihilate what stand on the dead.
A hopeless state of mind will overcome everyone Against me.
