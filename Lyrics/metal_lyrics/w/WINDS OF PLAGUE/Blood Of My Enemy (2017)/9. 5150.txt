Play with fire, and you'll get burned
If you want respect
You'll get what you earn
You say you want the world to know your name
You don't want to do the work, you just want the fame

Take this warning, and shut your mouth
This is all your fault, and no one else
Did you think I wouldn't find out what you said?
No one's gonna cry when they find you dead
Bitch

Something's in my head, and it wants you dead

You're not gonna last
I'm not holding back
Something's in my head, and it wants you dead

You're not much of a man, and your word is cheap
Don't get mad at the dog, just for herding the sheep
Only filth comes out of your mouth when you try to speak
Yet, you still think you're so much better than me
If you really want, I can play your game
But you won't leave in the same condition you came
I'm pushing my luck, with both guns up
I can promise you now, I don't give a fuck

Burn, but not in hell
You're stuck here with me, and I'm not doing well
You're gonna burn, but not in hell
You're stuck here with me, and I'm not doing well
Burn, but not in hell
Burn
I'm not doing well
