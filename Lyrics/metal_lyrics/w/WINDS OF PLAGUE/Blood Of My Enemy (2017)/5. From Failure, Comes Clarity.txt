We fed the flames
We broke the silence
We climbed up the mountain
And from the summit
From the summit we watched it burn

Restore balance to this fucking disorder
And IÂ´ll share the weight on my shoulders
Thought I heard thunder rumbling
But it was just my thoughts

Within sight of the border
Every day is getting shorter
Dark days, bright nights
But time is still moving on

My path is lost
Just take me away
So fucking done with this place

We fed the flames
We broke the silence
We climbed up the mountain
And from the summit
From the summit we watched it burn

Take my spirit
But you cant steal my crown
Youâre never bringing me down
With every step you take youâll burn up in my atmosphere

Within sight of the border
Every day is getting shorter
Dark days, bright nights
But time is still moving on

Fire will fuel my flames
I'll start it over again
Over and over again
Liars disintegrate
While they are cursing my name

We fed the flames
We broke the silence
We climbed up the mountain
And from the summit

We fed the flames
We broke the silence
We climbed up the mountain
And from the summit
We watched it burn

Iâll start it over again

We fed the flames
We broke the silence
We climbed up the mountain
And from the summit

We fed the flames
We broke the silence
We climbed up the mountain
And from the summit
We watched it burn
