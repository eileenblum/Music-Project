Rise
Let's go
The fog's rolling in, and I have no guide
Heading straight through the storm
With no end in sight
All alone, skeletons kicking down the door
Nowhere to turn, I'm going overboard

I feel at home swimming with the sharks
Mouth full of razor blades
Shredding through a corpse
I passed the point of no return
I called for help but wasn't heard

It's time to sink or swim
I'm getting lost within the swell
It's time to sink or swim or fight like hell

Under the tides
Dying to feel alive
There's no telling what the tides will bring
But I'm trying to find
The strength to climb
To make it out alive
There's no telling what the tides will bring
But I know I will rise

Rise
This monster in my chest
Rise
Awakens from the depths
Rise

If I don't win the war, I'll finish the fight
I've been through hell, and came out just fine
You'll never stand a chance
You'll never settle the score
You'll just end up face down on the floor
Prisoned by suffering I've done my time
I raised in the dark, to the light I climbed
I passed the point of no return
I called for help but wasn't heard

Under the tides
Dying to feel alive
There's no telling what the tides will bring
But I'm trying to find
The strength to climb
To make it out alive
There's no telling what the tides will bring
But I know I will rise
