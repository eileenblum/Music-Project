Fate
You think you're free from sin, but no one's ever been
These walls are paper thin, and I'm stuck in your frequency
In my static mind, you are an albatross
Everything you ever were, wound up in a total loss

Columns are caving in
My feet are stumbling
Melodramatic, enigmatic fucking suffering
The words you never said
Ricocheting in my head
Stop the bullet, stop the pain
Release me from this chains

I've learned my lesson

Fate
When it catches you
Let the weight of the truth destroy you
Your walls are crumbling
You had it coming for you
Hey
Either way you lose
Your world is falling
Your walls are crashing down
You had it coming for you

Breaking you is my salvation

Want to feel alive before it all fades
That's why we dive headfirst into the everglades
The silence pressing on
If this was for the best
Why does it feel like fucking daggers pressed into my chest
Columns are caving in
My feet are stumbling
Melodramatic, enigmatic fucking suffering
The words you never said
Ricocheting in my head
Stop the bullet, stop the pain
Fuck you, you're all the same

I've learned my lesson

Fate
When it catches you
Let the weight of the truth destroy you
Your walls are crumbling
You had it coming for you
Hey
Either way you lose
Your world is falling
Your walls come crashing down
You had it coming for you

You can run, or you can stand and fight
Either way, you fucking lose.

In my static mind
You are an albatross
Everything you ever were
A total loss
Another rotting creation
Face what you've become

Breaking you is my salvation

Fate
When it catches you
Let the weight of the truth destroy you
Your walls are crumbling
You had it coming for you
Hey
Either way you lose
Your world is falling
Your walls come crashing down
You had it coming for you

Breaking you is my salvation
I've learned my lesson
