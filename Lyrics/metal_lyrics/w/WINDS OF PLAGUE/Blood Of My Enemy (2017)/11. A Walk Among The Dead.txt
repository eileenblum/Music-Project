Get up

Here we go again
This shit will never end
I'm sick to my bones, yet there's nothing to mend
I always make my own way, so why don't you do the same?
You say you're not concerned with me
But you can't stop saying my name

You cannot break me

See what you've become
A clone in the system, a grain in the sand
Gone forever, it's gone forever
See what you've become
Crawling and crawling you'll never emerge
Dance like you're broken
Ignore what's been said
Love like you're hated
Live like you're dead

Thought you were in control
But I'm a loaded gun
And you don't have a fucking clue
What I'm capable of
I bet in your own head
You wish that I was dead
I'm gonna drag your body underground
And put you to rest bitch

You can not break me

See what you've become
A clone in the system, a grain in the sand
Gone forever, it's gone forever
See what you've become
Crawling and crawling you'll never emerge
Dance like you're broken
Ignore what's been said
Love like you're hated
Live like you're dead

In the ashes we roam
We are the plague, we are the doom
In the ashes we roam
We are the plague, we are the doom

See what you've become
A clone in the system, a grain in the sand
Gone forever, it's gone forever
See what you've become
Crawling and crawling you'll never emerge
Dance like you're broken
Ignore what's been said
Love like you're hated
Live like you're dead
