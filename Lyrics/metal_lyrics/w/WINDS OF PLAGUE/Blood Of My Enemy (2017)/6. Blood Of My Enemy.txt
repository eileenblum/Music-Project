There is a fate that is worse than death
Living life on your knees, your heart full of regret

This is my destiny
To destroy everything, and everyone in my way preventing victory
Conceived by fury, I was born into a world where all that I know is war
Guided by vengeance, I was sworn into a world that I was made to fight for

Blood is pumping through my veins
As I march with my brothers into the flames
Standing at the edge, I've never felt so alive
Standing at the edge
Because I'm ready to die

I won't go down easy
This is my prophecy and I will rise from the dead if you bury me
I'll go to war without a shield, and I will gladly die on the battlefield

I will give my life on the battlefield
Drowning in the blood of my enemies

Blood is pumping through my veins
As I march with my brothers into the flames
Standing at the edge, I've never felt so alive
Standing at the edge
Because I'm ready to die
