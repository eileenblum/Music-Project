If you want heaven, you'll have to pass through hell

It's do or die motherfucker, and no in between
And no short-cuts to the American Dream
If you want heaven on Earth, you'll have to suffer through hell
And with your bloody, broken, hands ring the Liberty Bell
Strive to get better
Don't accept doubt
Stand tall in all weather

We fix our eyes on, what's waiting on the horizon
Never stop
Never look back
Never falter
It's do or die motherfucker

Never give in
Don't let your set-backs win
Just be yourself, proud of what's within
Always told to be a man of promises kept
Headstrong
Born the son of a Vietnam Vet

Break through all blockades
Tear down the walls
Break through all blockades
Never give in

We fix our eyes on, what's waiting on the horizon
Never stop
Never look back
Never falter
It's do or die motherfucker
We're moving onwards
We won't give up when we struggle
Never stop
Never look back
Never falter
It's do or die motherfucker

Let the scars on your back lead the way
This is purgatory
So make it heaven or hell
This is purgatory
So make it heaven or hell
This is our territory
So make it one hell of a story to tell

We fix our eyes on, what's waiting on the horizon
Never stop
Never look back
Never falter
It's do or die motherfucker
We're moving onwards
We won't give up when we struggle
Never stop
Never look back
Never falter
It's do or die motherfucker

This is purgatory
This is our territory
It's do or die motherfucker
