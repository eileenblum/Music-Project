Picked on
Spit upon
Lied to and cheated on
Since the day I was born Iâve been a fucking pawn
Iâve been pushed around
Kicked when Iâm down
But that all ends

Right now
This is a warning
Iâm about to lose control
Right now
Self-destructing
Timebomb set to explode

Right now
This is a warning
Iâm about to lose control
Right now
Self-destructing
Timebomb set to explode

No rules
No fear
We eat the weak in here
We rose from the gutters to be the kings of carnage
No rules
No fear
We eat the weak in here
We rose from the gutters
To finish what we started

Itâs time
Bow down
You walk with me and the beast when youâre in my town
No sight
No sound
Youâre trapped in here with me and not getting out
Hardened by the flames of hell
Cast down here by God himself

Hardened by the flames of hell
Cast down here by God himself

Right now
This is a warning
Iâm about to lose control
Right now
Self-destructing
Timebomb set to explode

No rules
No fear
We eat the weak in here
We rose from the gutters to be the kings of carnage
No rules
No fear
We eat the weak in here
We rose from the gutters
To finish what we started
