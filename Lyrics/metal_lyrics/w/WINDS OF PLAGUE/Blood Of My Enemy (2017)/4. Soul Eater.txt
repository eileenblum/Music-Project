Keep your eyes shut and your mouth closed
And savor every second you have left
'Cause when I find you your shadow will merge with you

I am the toxic fumes
That will guide you to the darkest tombs
No one will warn you when it's time to die

Born upon the winds of plague
I've come to take you away
Hell awaits you my friend
This is the end

The swarming light stole the spark from your eyes
And freed you from any convictions

You're in the eye of the storm
Nowhere to turn
The floodgate is open
I'm coming for you
You cannot hide

Lost at best
Dead at worst
Slowly decaying with stabbing thirst

Born upon the winds of plague
I've come to take you away
Hell awaits you my friend
This is the end

I am the toxic fumes
That will guide you to the darkest tombs
Hell awaits you my friend
This is the end

The swarming light stole the spark from your eyes
And freed you from any convictions
This is the end
