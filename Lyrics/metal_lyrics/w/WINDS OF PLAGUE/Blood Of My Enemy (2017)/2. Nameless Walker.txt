Might as well go and dig my grave
End it now, or be a slave
If you knew what was going on
I bet you wouldn't be so fucking brave
I will die with a smile, so wry
No time left to say goodbye
Can you see me fall
Can you see me crawl
Someone hear my fucking call

Give me something
Live
To live for
Die
To die for
I am fading away
Give me something
Live
To live for
Die
To die for
I'll be dead in a day

My face is numb
I'm starting to break
What have I become?
A nameless walker
I raise my hands, and pray for an end
To this dreadful place
I'm at the alter

See my face in it's squalor
Second by second, it's losing its color
Falling
Crawling
Someone hear my call

Might as well go on and dig your grave
End it now or be a slave
If you stay here until the dawn
There will be nothing left of you to save
You would die with a smile so wry
With no time to say goodbye
I can make you fall
I can make you crawl
Nobody would hear your call

Give me something
Live
To live for
Die
To die for
I am fading away

My face is numb
I'm starting to break
What have I become?
A nameless walker
I raise my hands, and pray for an end
To this dreadful place
I'm at the alter
Falling
Falling and crawling
Falling
Falling and crawling
Someone hear my call
