Broken at last
I'm blinded
Damnation won
I've kept it at bay for far too long
Now I'm burning inside
Fallen angels embrace me with claws
My mind goes blank
I forget what was

Hear the calling
A discord of voices blend into a tone
The devil made me do it
He lead the way all through it
I'm never alone

In my own reflection
I caught the serpents grin
One bite of the apple unleashed the hell I kept within
With nothing left I accept
These invitations to darkness

Hissing he lied
"You will not certainly die"
Don't fucking pray for us

Hissing he lied
"You will not certainly die"
Can't refuse his horde of demons
They ripped apart my soul
Now I'm a soldier for the damned
And I dance in this trance
With a malicious romance
A downward spiral into madness

In my own reflection I caught the serpents grin
One bite of the apple unleashed the hell I kept within
With nothing left I accept
These invitations to darkness

Hear the calling
A discord of voices blend into a tone
The devil made me do it
He lead the way all through it
I'm never alone
Hear the calling
Never alone
Hear the calling
You will not certainly die
