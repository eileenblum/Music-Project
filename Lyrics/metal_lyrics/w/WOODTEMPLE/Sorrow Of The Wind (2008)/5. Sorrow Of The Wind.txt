Endless nights, eternal darkness,
and a breath of neverending wind enclosed me.
Surrounded from an endless forest,
whose silence and loneliness seemed to reach to the stars.

A place where time catched up with me.
The last daylight seemed to lie back so long ago.

The wind pulled me into his realm, surrounded full of sorrow.

My eyes, they were so cold, dense fog enclosed me,
and the night seemed to become always longer.

No hopes, no will, nothing was left in me.
Waiting for a breath of silence, to take me home,
into the realm of mountains.
