Hidden in the deepest forests,
hordes of heathen warriors were living.

So strong and full of pride.
As the last of their kind,
they took their destiny in hand,

to fight and defend what was holy to them.
They had looked through the knowledge of the runes,
and wanted to bring them back to life.

Rise the horns up to battle,
with sword and horse, into the war.
Many had to die, as sword and shield has broken.
Fallen, full of pride and honour.

Valkyries took them to Valhall.
Dense fog covered the sky,
and the secret of the runes was blown away by the wind.
