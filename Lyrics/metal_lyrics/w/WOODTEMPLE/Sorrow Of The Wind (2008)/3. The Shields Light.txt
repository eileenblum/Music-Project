As the last leaf fell from the tree,
and dense fog darkened the sky,
they crossed the forests.

Warriors that had dedicated themselves to Wotan,
strived through the land.
They carried the pride of the Nordic god far into the distance.

The shield's light showed them the way.
Through lightning and thunder, they stormed into the battle.

They held on to their believes, as sword and shield broke.
Fallen for their people and lord.
Valhalla was their reward.

The shield's light is neverending.
Wotan's wild hunt.
