Sorrow, darkness, cold once we feeled,
in a time of eternal war.
In the name of our ancestors we moved from battle to battle
to defend our nation.
Our swords we thirsting for blood,
the ground was covered with snow,
as we moved out into a new battle.
War, fire and death for the enemy.
Swords crashed into each other
Thousands of warriors have been fallen,
here were no mercy and no escape.
Much blood has been shed
Darkness surrounded the field.
We stormed their fortress and burnt their houses
But they could not be found,
Everything was hidden in eternal shadow
