Tears from the eyes of a warrior,
Exhausted he was lying on the ground
And was hit badly from the battle.
Nothing he could witness anymore, 
only the eternal forests.
Even the smell of nature and
The sound of swords vanished in him.
No hope, no power has been left, only to wait for death.
Heavy for surrounded the forest,
and a endless rain began, when the light of the warrior vanished.
Once a strong warrior,
fallen in fight of honour and loyalty for his nation.
Nothing has been left
The sound of forests, the might of nature,
Even the smell of flowers and meadows,
vanished forever.
