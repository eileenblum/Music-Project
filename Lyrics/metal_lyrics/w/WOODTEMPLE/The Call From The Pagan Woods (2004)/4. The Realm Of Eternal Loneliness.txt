Darkness and loneliness enclaved a warrior,
when he was on the way to leave his realm.
To forget what they have done to him.
His despair has led him deep into the woods.
Exhausted he crashed at the cold soil.
The pain was huge and broke his proud.
Eternal silence came in,
at day and night.
He could not realize anything,
only the eternal sky.
Shivering cold enclaved him.
No hope, no way was in sight.
Waiting for his death,
in the Realm of eternal loneliness.
