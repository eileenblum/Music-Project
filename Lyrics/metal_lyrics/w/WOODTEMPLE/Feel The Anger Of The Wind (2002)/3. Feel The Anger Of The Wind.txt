Surrounded by endless darkness
I'm crossing the country
I'm feeling the anger of the wind
It's coming closer with all it's
Hate and it's strenght it is resolving
War against Christ's
We've been sent to take revenge
For our pride and our honor
The only thing that has remaind
In the country was the anger of the wind
