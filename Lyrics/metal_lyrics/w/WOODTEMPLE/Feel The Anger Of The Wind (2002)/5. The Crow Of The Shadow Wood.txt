Hidden in the Dark woods surrounded by shadows
It circles without decree to find you
Dirty of betrayer and fear your soul is hiding
In a body which does not deserve to exist
Because he was betrayer of you

The crow will hunt you to the end of the world
It will yake your soul to destroy you
Full of pain and torture it will fall with your soul
And die in an endless wood of shadows
