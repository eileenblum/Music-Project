In a dark night flames came out of the village church
As strong that nobody could put them out
A figure came out full of endless hate
Destroying everything that dirty Christians built
The village people tried to flee
But they were all slaughtered
When the church was destroyed
The figure disappeared in a clearing -
It had never existed -
Only a slack of ash was left
