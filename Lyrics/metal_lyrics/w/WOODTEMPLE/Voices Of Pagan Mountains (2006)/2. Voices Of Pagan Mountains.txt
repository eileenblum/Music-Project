Voices out of the depths of the mountains.
They were so cold,
that the frost let freeze our hearts.
Armed with sword and shield,
we marched to defend our people.
Dense fog and endless snow were interfering our march.
Anger, hate and eternal darkness enclosed us.,
as we plunged into battle.
Swords crashed on each other and shields broke.
Fire and death reigned the events,
as thousands of people declared war.
We had hardly any strenght left,
but our hate burned in flaming embers.
The sounds of forests, the voices of mountains extincted,
and our end had come,
filled with eternal pride.
