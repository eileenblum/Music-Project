Darkness enclosed the forests,
as thousands of people marched into war.
The land was covered in snow.
Armed with sword and shield,
we followed the call of the wolves.
Our swords burned in flaming embers.
War, eternal war.
Thousands of warriors crashed onto eachother,
only hate reigned the events.
There was no light in those dark hours,
no hope, only death.
Endless pain enclosed us,
nothing was left back,
only the fire of our swords.
