Sorrow, hate,
eternal loneliness enclosed us.
The pain, so cold,
as we marched through the forests.
Once again, we played the songs of our people.
Strains of eternal sorrow.
Our tears in flaming embers,
nothing we coul hear,
only the eternal stars.
No hope,
no will.
Nothing was left in us.
Agonies of a lost battle were in us, so cold.
Dark fog closed our eyes,
in lonely coldness.
