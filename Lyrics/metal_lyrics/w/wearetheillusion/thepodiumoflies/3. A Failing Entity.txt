An eye for an eye make the world blind
Our children stand aligned
Ready for the chaos of tomorrow
These are the conditions of despair

Oppressed by the constant grey clouds
Drowning in the fathomless depths
Oppressed by the constant grey clouds
Obliterating the last known threats

There will be no pause, no rest (no rest)
Until this illusion of ours is laid to waste
We built our own demise.

Now reach for the skies!

This is the era of self-destruction
The age of controlled affliction
Dim my eyes from this torturous sight
