The haze fills the air, no sight, no sound
And all because of the minds of men.
From the sacrifice of many became the riches of one
And all because of the minds of men.

The stars become blind
Only through the eyes of the fallen
Could we see what really took place
On this stained, wretched soil

The flaw of man
The Holy land, the Garden of Eden and the lust for power:
As if it all came from the same mind

Let us disconnect from this and start thinking
About the consequences of acts.
Let us take control of what's ahead
And leave this gray history behind!
