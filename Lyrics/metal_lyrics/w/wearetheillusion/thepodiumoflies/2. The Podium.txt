He stands behind the podium of lies
Force-feeding the truth of his own
Words embellished by greed
Seducing and obfuscating

Be enslaved by the betrayal of ages
Or be put to a timeless slumber
Be confused and puzzled
Under the grin of a faceless regime

High on the hog, a fat cat
Hands pure of filth
The sun has scorched it's resistance
And illuminated it's allies
United the once foes
Into a circle of common belief

They all knee (before their anonymous leader)
And embrace the lies as the only truth
They all knee (with no self-respect)
And gain their chains of an eternal pact
