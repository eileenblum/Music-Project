Waking eyes indistinct sight
Travelling worlds in black and white
She waves her hand and walks away
Drawing you near, injecting fear, burn

She waves her hand and walks away
Whispers unclear, injecting fear, burn

Someday I'll be found
Abandoned memories
These melodies soar

Someday I'll be found
Abandoned memories
These melodies soar
Thrive to carry on
Search for the energy
Set you free
Soar

Tempt into darkness
I pray for the heartless
I wish for time to fade away
Twenty years have gone and passed away
I wish for time to fade away

Never fear
Come with me
Love is near
The soul will see
Never fear
Come with me
Love is near
Rip through the skies
Break free
Just break free

Someday, I'll be found
Abandoned memories
These melodies soar
Thrive to carry on
Search for the energy
Set you free
Soar

Someday, I'll be found
Abandoned memories
These melodies soar
Thrive to carry on
Search for the energy
Set you free

Someday I'll be found
