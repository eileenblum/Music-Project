Crashing through this endless dream
Frozen still with silent screams
Tear down these walls, they're closing in
Rising tide of regret, stop me from
Going under, sinking further

Why are you so far away?

Voices twist and turn this mood
I cannot speak, I cannot move
It's not too late to rise above the ash
Don't you dare and make that move, rejection stares
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Never get down

Why are you so far away?
Distant memories, long-full fantasies
Heavenly light shines down for you

Dulcet nightmare
Absence despair
Dulcet nightmare
Absence despair

Rise, and fight this war
Deep inside your mind
Don't give in
Deceit will come
Find a way to tear your down and leave you whole
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Never get down
Never get down

Going under
Sinking further
Taunting laughter

Dulcet nightmare
Absence despair
Dulcet nightmare
Absence despair

Dulcet nightmare
Absence despair
Dulcet nightmare
Absence despair

[Monologue:]
Dear taunting darkness,
You have come and gone along with your wretched trickery and deceit. You pray on the innocent and weak minded. Your cowardly ways have not gone unnoticed. You have truly shown me that in darkness one finds light. Know that I am stronger and will not give in to your morbid terror anymore. Though I know we will meet again one day...until then I will be on guard waiting . For the powers of darkness will be crushed by the spirit of light.

Streaming conscious
Free from despair

Rise
Rise and fight this war
Rise
Rise, a way to tear you down
Rise
Oh just don't give in

Going under
Sinking further
Taunting laughter

(Never get down)
