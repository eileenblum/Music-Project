Take a hold of my hand
And I'll take you where the sunlight shines
Take a look in my eyes
Reflections of love whisper by

Gentle words and they always bleed through
Always for you, pull me inside
Shrouded by your own isolation
Disappear across the horizon

So you've found a place to hide away
Withered heart down in dismay
No it's never easy
To lose that comfort within
To forget who you have been
Risk that change and begin
Long and lonesome road now
I bid you farewell
I bid you farewell
Take this life again

You and I will rise across the horizon
Rise across the horizon

Reflections of my past
They haunt me still
I circle this deep flame
For grace that I will reclaim
These virtues of my life
They taunt me still
With grace, the way is always clear
This raven disappears

Come with me to the farthest seas, now
To a life where the wind blows free
Take my hand, leave this baron wasteland.
Reveal the path of your mystery.

Come with me to the farthest seas, now
To a life where the wind blows free
Take my hand, leave this baron wasteland.
Reveal the path of your mystery.

Take hold of my hand
And I'll take you where the sunlight falls
Out of the darkness
Into the light
Dissipating shadows from my past
You and I will rise across the horizon
Rise across the horizon
