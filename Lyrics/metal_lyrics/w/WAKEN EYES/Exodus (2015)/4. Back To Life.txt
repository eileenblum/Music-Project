"Ye have heard that it has been said... To cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe. And you do that by love"
[Martin Luther King Jr. "Loving your enemies" November 17, 1957]

I stand alone
Without a soul
To lend a hand
And we both know

I walk alone
Without your
Grace to break
My fall
I must find the strength
To carry on
My own
And rise once again

Still in sunlight
Darkness will fall
Dead in silence
I hear your call
All these days are
Withered with striff
All of these dreams
Are bringing me
Back to life

Back to life

I cannot win
This holy war
That Iâve begun
It tears my skin, i cannot win
These thoughts of loss
Not overcome
I struggle with
Enrage with this
Psychological
Abyss

Still in sunlight
Darkness will fall
Dead in silence
I hear your call
All these days are
Withered with striff
All of these dreams
Are bringing me
Back to life

Isolated
Solitude
Withering down
To my knees
On my way
To see this through
Faith from above
Back on my feet

Still in sunlight
Darkness will fall (darkness will fall)
Dead in silence
I hear your call (i hear your call)
All these days are
Withered with striff (withered with striff)
All of these dreams
Are bringing me (ooo bringing, oh bringing)
Back to life

"That the more we hate, the more we develop guilt feelings and we begin to subconsciously repress or consciously suppress certain emotions, and they all stack up in our subconscious selves and make for tragic, neurotic responses. And may this not be the neuroses of many individuals as they confront life that that is an element of hate there.... So love everybody... Hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center... Yes, it is love that will save our world and our civilization... Because hate destroys the hater as well as the hated."
[Martin Luther King Jr. "Loving your enemies" November 17, 1957]
