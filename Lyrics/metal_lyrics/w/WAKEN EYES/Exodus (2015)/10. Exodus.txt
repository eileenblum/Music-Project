I wonder why, these darkened skies
Shroud over me, disease....believe
I believe there is a soul, I'm too weak to gain control
Numbing breath of fire, let me go

Broken seals and desperate cries
Starring in the devil's eyes
Open fields with fallen light
Flashing flares rip the midnight sky

Innocence without a care, no
Love has left a long long time ago
Powerless and left alone
Find your strength, and take back what was
Known
Lead this fight

On and on, the price of war
I cannot take this place no more
Reigning night, leecher of light
Leave this place, you take away from
Me, can't you see
You're the enemy, fragile life so clear
Breathing hate
Your venomous scent turns me to dust and shadows remain
Rising from the voices of this melody, won't you set me free

[Monologue:]
"Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth -- more than ruin, more even than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible,; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid ... Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man." It is our Light, not our Darkness, that most frightens us."

you, take my hand, and follow me
Don't turn your back on me
I'll give you shelter and let you be
You'll never be free

Memories of laughter, burred by disaster
Dreams will fade, into a sea of blood we made
Rise above submission, let this be a lesson
Give me, give me the strength to leave

Yeah!

Crawling out of this leeches dead space
Hearts are pumping, freedoms embrace
Warming light just a breath away
Won't you bring me home
Sea of light lift this dying soul
won't you take me, break me, lead me home

Tainted words and screams
Will haunt your deepest dreams
Innocence taken by greed
Take a look at my face
Remember it will, I'll see you in hell

Blissful melody
Oh won't you come and set me soul free
These darkest hours burn
These times of grace we turn
We will not give in to your fear

You will always be with me
You will see my face again
Be a slave no more
Believe and follow me
Oh to be free from this world
Get up now, and take back this life.

Far, across the land
Distant voices, spreading poisons
Open your eyes, diminish these lies
The window to your soul is here
Open your eyes
