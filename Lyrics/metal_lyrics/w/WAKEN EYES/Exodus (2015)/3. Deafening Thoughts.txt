Breathe.....this cold and piercing dream
It shelters me
Soundless and still, holding me down
I endlessly drown

Look in her eyes
Misery and hate coincide
Feeding her fear, it's constantly near
Leaves her so powerless yet whole
Sinking, slowing down, vertigo
Walk with the slaves
As they broadcast illusions obey

I'm so sleepy, in this blissful misery
Withdraw this feeling of doubt
Open your eyes and unfold

Slow down, slow down
He hungers, feed on your soul
This sickness, is breaking me down

Look in her eyes
Misery and hate coincide
Feeding her fear, it's constantly near
Leaves her so powerless yet whole
Sinking, slowing down,vertigo
Walk with the slaves
As they broadcast illusions obey

Look in her eyes
Misery and hate coincide
Feeding her fear, it's constantly near
Leaves her so powerless yet whole
Sinking, slowing down, vertigo
Walk with the slaves
As they broadcast illusions obey

Open your eyes
