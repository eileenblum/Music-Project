A man without light
Is destined to live
A long scornful life
Which can't be relived
Leap in this fire
Yes bask in the flames
Let it burn
The kindness of man is your sin

Ah
You and me can never be
These palisades are my brightest shade

For one to stand still
To lose all progression
Alive for the kill
In this misconception
Give up your body
Yes fade in the heat
Let it burn

The blindness of man enrages your sin
A moment of innocence has fueled grin
The elegance of evil will always burn

Ah
You and me can never be
These palisades are my brightest shade

These are my final words
These are my final words
