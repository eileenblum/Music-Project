A long time ago, in a place so far and wide
My love, my fear, keeps wondering within
Visions of hate echo deep through my mind

A long time ago, in a place so close and still
Your love, your fear, your compassion lives so free
Visions of love echo deep through my soul

Miles and miles away
Life in search of a brand new day
This feeling, this fight, carries on
Visions of love echo deep through my soul
Visions of hate echo deep through your mind

Visions of love echo deep, deep through your mind

Passing through this mystery
Stream of life
Letting go...
Coaxing voices
Running aimlessly
In search for the past
Seeking the absolute
Yearning for the truth

Visions of love echo deep my soul
Visions of hate echo deep through your mind
Visions of love echo deep through your mind

Passing thoughts of misery
Stream of life set me free
Close your eyes and don't be seen
Come home with me

Running aimlessly
In search for the past
Seeking the absolute
Yearning for the truth
