From The Fields Of The Ardenne
To The Holy Land
From The Bloody Trenches
To The Burning Sands
Young Boys Bleed And Die
Their Young Lives Slip Away
Death Comes With A Scream And A Sigh
This Is Your Judgement Day

Unknown Soldier, Call To Arms
To Fight And Die In A Foreign Land
A Victim Of A Violent Age
To You The Worlds An Open Grave
Unknown Soldier, The Battles Nigh
With Your Brothers At Your Side
You Hear Your Mothers Sigh

Marching Thru The Carnage
The Bloody Road To Hell
Another Mile To Glory
The Strain It Starts To Tell
They Never Told You It Would Be Like This
The Horror And The Pain
You're Fighting For Your Existence
You Never Seem The Same
Unknown Soldier, Call To Arms
To Fight And Die In A Foreign Land
A Victim Of A Violent Age
To You The Worlds An Open Grave
Unknown Soldier, You Fight And Die
For Another Scrap Of Land, It's Getting
Out Of Hand

On A Sleeping City, Destruction From The Skies
A Blinding Light Engulfing
It Drowns The Children's Cries
On Metal Wings Rides The Harbinger Of Death
Nothing But No-One Escapes His Molten Breath

Unknown Soldier, Call To Arms
To Fight And Die In A Foreign Land
A Victim Of A Violent Age
To You The Worlds An Open Grave
Unknown Soldier, The Politicians Scream
It's A Land Of Your Dreams
While Their Supping Their Brandys
Unknown Soldier, You Swallow Politicians Lies
Who You Despise, To Many Walk The Land

You Wanted War, We Give You War
Death And War
And Death And War
In Death There Is No Pain
