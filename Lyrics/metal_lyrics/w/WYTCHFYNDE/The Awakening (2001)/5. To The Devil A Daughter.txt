In Anticipation With Fear In Her Eyes
She Lies There Waiting
A Purveyor Of Evil, The Terror She's Feeling
See The Beast Within Her Rise

She Invited The Dark Side, She Called On The Past
Just A Child's Silly Game
He Possess Her Body, As She Calls Out His Name

She's Writhing In Pain, Her Young Soul To Take
He Heard Her Calling
He'll Take Her To Hell That Sweet Little Girl
To The Devil A Daughter

She'll Tempt You With Pleasures, From Your Wildest Dreams
Lust And Fornication
She'll Take All Your Giving, It's Part Of Her Plan
Control And Domination

With All That She's Taken, She's Just Bled You Dry
Darkness Takes The Morning
She Leaves You With Nothing, No Last Kiss Goodbye

You Invited The Dark Side, Called On The Past
Childish Little Games
She Possess Your Body, She Drives You Insane
