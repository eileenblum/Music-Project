When Darkness Falls, You're All Alone
I'm Waiting For You, As You Walk Home
I Taste Your Fear I Feel Your Dread
Am I For Real Or In Your Head
I Cast No Shadow Leave No Sign
One Look From Me And You Are Mine
You Feel The Pain, You Feel The Ecstasy
I Tantalise And Mesmerise
A Deep Hypnotic Stare
I'm Looking Through Your Window
You Don't Know I'm There
A Life With No Passion Is No Life At All
My Fetid Breath It Chills Your Blood
I Feed Upon Your Soul

A Life With No Passion Is No Life At All
My Fetid Breath It Chills Your Blood
I Feed Upon Your Soul

You Feel You're Lifes Blood Drain From You
You're Thinking Now This Can't Be True
As I Am Now So You Shall Be
So Be Prepared To Follow Me
Into The Depths Of Depravity
The Living Dead Your Company
You Feel The Pain, You Feel The Agony

I Hear You Calling Out My Name
It's Time For Me To Rise Again
Your Nightmare Has Now Begun
Nowhere To Hide, Nowhere To Run
I Am A Whisper In The Night
I Hold The Power You Cannot Fight
You Feel The Pain There's No More Ecstasy
