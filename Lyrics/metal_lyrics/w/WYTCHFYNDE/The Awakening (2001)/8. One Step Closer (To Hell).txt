In A Time Of Fear And Purgatory
Of A Land That Weeps With Misery
Feel The Flames Of My Desire
Taste The Pleasures I Derive In

In The Dead Of The Night I'll Come For You
The Stench Of Death Invades Your Lonely Room
Feel My Cold Lips Brush Your Silken Face
Now My Bite Your Locked In Deaths Embrace

I'm Drinking Your Blood, Your Heart And Your Soul
Your Memories Grow Cold
Come With Me Now, Listen To Me
This Is Your Destiny

I've Prowled This Earth Thru The Centuries
A Million Souls Have All Succumbed To Me
Tears Of Blood I've Shed In Agony
Come Now Into Eternity

I Give You All Eternal Life
Evoke To Me All The Things That You Despise
Just Let Me Take Your Last Breath
Bequeath To Me All That You Have Left

See No More The Sight Of The Setting Sun
The Sounds Of Death And Joy Merge Into One
The Fires Of Hell Are Here To Welcome You
Into The Hosts I Watch, I Wait For You
Touch The Plague That Sweeps Across The Land
Where The Christ Was Said To Make His Stand
See The Shadow Of The Cross That Made You Free
Oh Lord Why Has Thou Forsaken Me

See No More The Sight Of The Setting Sun
The Sounds Of Death And Joy Merge Into One
The Fires Of Hell Are Here To Welcome You
Into The Hosts I Watch, I Wait For You
Touch The Plague That Sweeps Across The Land
Where The Christ Was Said To Make His Stand
See The Shadow Of The Cross That Made You Free
