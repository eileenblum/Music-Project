Out Of The Depths I Come To Conquer And Devour
There Is No Question, This Is Your Darkest Hour
I Brought You Famine, Pestilence, Disease
You Will Pay Homage, Or I'll Bring You To You Knee's

Hell Hath No Fury - Now I Walk The Earth

I Have Been Waiting For The Past 1000 Years
And As Predicted Out Of The Darkness I'll Appear
I Watched You Ravage, Dishonour And Demand
Ignore My Warning, I'll Decimate Your Land

I Am The Fallen Angel, I Am The Anti Christ
I Am The Lord And Master, To Me You'll Sacrifice

Evoke My Anger, And I'll Lay Your Souls To Waste
I Look Upon You With Hatred And Distaste
The Devastation That My Coming Leaves Behind
The Desolation, The Gates Of Hell Are Open Wide

I Am The Fallen Angel, Here To Bring You Pain
I Am The Master, Dare You Speak My Name
Your Prayers Are Now Futile
No Mercy From Above
Your Souls Cry In Anguish
Awash In Seas Of Blood

Out Of The Depths I Come To Conquer And Devour
There Is No Question, This Is Your Darkest Hour
I Brought You Famine, Pestilence, Disease
You Will Pay Homage, Or I'll Bring You To Your Knees

Hell Hath No Fury

I Have Been Waiting, For The Past 1000 Years
Out Of Darkness As Predicted
