what a perfect time for rain to start,
what a familiar feeling inside
of me, so tired of the need to depart
and of the feelings and thoughts I have to hide.
nothing lasts longer than a blink of an eye.
it all ends, leaving nothing but the pain.
all we can - go both forward and behind,
hoping that weâd learn something on the way.

the day is dark and itâs dark inside
of me, but somehow I like it this way.
the sound of falling raindrops seems divine.
I donât want this feeling to vanish away.
but nothing lasts longer then a blink of an eye
and I know that soon the rain will end.
all will disappear, âcos thereâs no use to try
to make it all last longer, there would soon be another rain.
