the flame of pyre so bright tonight,
but no one can see it.
people have lost the senses and might
and they spit on the graves of friends, they spit
and lose their faith - now itâs not so strong.
they stand in line with hollow eyes.
they form the wall of the eyeless with the sharp and gleaming thorns.
canât see the pyre theyâre burning in, the dancing hungry fire.
