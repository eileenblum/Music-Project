Running and screaming
Aspiring to find the water thatâll cleanse you
The comforting tide
The bodyâs dirty and bleeding
And timeâs too tired
Of you
Tonight.

Desolation makes every whisper sound so loud
In this void where all are beheaded and lying on the ground.
At a certain point no change can be made nor found.
Once youâre here you wonât ever get out.

The damnations you spat out didnât save you.
The damnations you spat out didnât hurt anyone but you.
They didnât hurt anyone âcos no one accepted your fucking insults.
They are for you. You are purulent from the inside.
For you. And youâll rot away.
Farewell. Goodbye.
