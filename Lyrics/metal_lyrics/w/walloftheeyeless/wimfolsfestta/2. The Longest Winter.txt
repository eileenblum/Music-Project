Cold.
All alone
In Here.
Just snow
And fear.
Silence
Makes my ears bleed.
Itâs like a long fall
The pain, it stands tall.
I close one eye
And see half.
I close both
And see all.
The trembling
Of my hand,
Where these nails are shining
Bright, and I tend
To escape
And leave it behind
Far away.

Run!

Today I wanted to find you
And so I ran straight to your home.
But I never found what I wanted to find
Because there was no house, not even a stone.
No more is the town this house was in.
No more are the streets I once ran through.
Only the memories left to make my skin way too thin.
Nothing left to be found now. Thereâs no you.

Thereâs no you.

It's so cold.
