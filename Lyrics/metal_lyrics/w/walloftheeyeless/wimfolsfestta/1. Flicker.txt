I want to jump at my own shadow
But why canât I move?..

So close your face to mine
Who are you? I canât see your face clearly.
Grey fog surrounds us
And embraces the trees in this alley.
It was a strange place I woke up in today.
I came to my senses and saw these eyes staring at me.
All I want is just to go away
Away from this face so catatonic and eerie.

I canât move but only blink.

Iâm so tired of losing faith
In people I see on the streets.
People who try to find but lose their ways
After being knocked off their feet.
Should we rewrite all the stories weâve told?
The stellar disguise is a hell of a treat.
Nothing you touch will on the spot turn to gold,
But the chance is still there while you still feel your heartbeat.

I canât move but only blink
So I close my eyes â two walls in this space,
Two walls to isolate me from this stare
To stop seeing this face.
But when I open my eyes again
Another hazy face I see,
But the eyes are the same even then
Those same eyes are staring at me.

Every single feeling, every single sight
Became a shadow strolling through my head.
Iâm trying so hard to again feel all right
And not to think of those who left

And not to think of those who left

Youâre tied but didnât see it before.
Far from having a chance to escape,
Left to stare into these eyes you canât let go â
The fact you are so afraid to face.
Do we still believe in the stories weâve told?
Is the stellar disguise a hell of a treat?
Nothing you touch will on the spot turn to gold.
But the chance is still there while you still feel your heartbeat.

The same eyes will be staring at you all your life
If you donât dare to face it, to move and go on.
The same eyes you will see while trying to shelter in the crowd
Go and find your peace now. Donât consider yourself gone yet.

I woke up and went out into the street.
Maybe I am still sleeping or maybe I never was.
