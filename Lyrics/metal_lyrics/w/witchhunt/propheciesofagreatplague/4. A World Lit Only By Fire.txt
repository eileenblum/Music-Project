Where Does The Soul Choose To Exist
When Life Has Ceased To Be?
In A Horrible Place, An Infernal Realm
Are We Condemned To Misery?
Or Is Death Just, A Space In Time,
Beyond Our Land And Sea.
Beyond Our Will To Comprehend
A Void In Purgatory.
The Gates Of Hell Are Spread Out Wide
To Welcome The Lost Of Roam
Children Born Unto Darkness Find
A Brand New Place To Call Home.
So When Your Final Hour Strikes,
Where Do You Think You'll Go?
To A Plain Of Eternal Happiness,
Or An Infinity Of Sorrow?
