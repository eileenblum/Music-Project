[Vocals: Henning Basse]

Endure the pain a world deranged
Bathe in the sin of euphoria
As they are bred for the slaughter
The horrid realm of reality

We bleed the unseen one
Descend on wings of sin
Redeem the despised at will
Blood drips upon us all
Condemn the countless souls
Domination of the weak
We line up 1 by 1
Blood sacrifice

Recant your belief conform to be reborn
No empty tears will save you now
Venomous spite the serpent of demise
We are now doused in flames of sin

We bleed the unseen one
Descend on wings of sin
Redeem the despised at will
Blood drips upon us all
Condemn the countless souls
Domination of the weak
We line up 1 by 1
Blood sacrifice

It now begins the walls are closing in
Bury us all under the sky
We all decay image fades away
For what we seek we must die!!
Blood sacrifice

[Solo]

We drift away tarnished, are those betrayed
No fading cries will help you now.

We bleed the unseen one
Descend on wings of sin
Redeem the despised at will
Blood drips upon us all
Condemn the countless souls
Domination of the weak
We line up 1 by 1
Blood sacrifice
It now begins the walls are closing in
Bury us all under the sky
We all decay image fades away
For what we seek we must die!!
Blood sacrifice, blood sacrifice
