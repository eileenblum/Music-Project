[Vocals: Chuck Billy]

Look around what do I see
Is it illusion or reality?
Piercing eyes watch from above
Glaring right through me intention to kill
In my mind this can't be real
Awake from this nightmare where time never heals

Taking my soul to a world frozen in time
Am I alive? My soul is screaming to die

Over and over again is this a dream?
My body and mind cannot scream
These silent screams over and over again
Cause life is not what it seems it's just a dream

Eyes relent though never attack
My mind it bleeds yet cannot awake
Never ends so why am I here?
Cannot move frozen in fear
There's no end tortured forever
Floating in darkness surrounded by terror

Taking my soul to a world frozen in time
Am I alive? My soul is screaming to die
Over and over again is this a dream?
My body and mind cannot scream
These silent screams over and over again
Cause life is not what it seems it's just a dream

Shifting through darkness waiting to die

[Solo]

Over and over again is this a dream?
My body and mind cannot scream
These silent screams over and over again
Cause life is not what it seems it's just a dream
