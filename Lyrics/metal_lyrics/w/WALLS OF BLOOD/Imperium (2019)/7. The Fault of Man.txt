[Vocals: Henning Basse]

Without guilt of shame
The holy cross is to blame
Save me from my sins
Until I do it again

The guilt of eons passed
Past down through time
It always stays the same
The flaw of mankind

The stained glass walls
Won't change what you feel
You reach for the cloth
To harness the rage you conceal

To your god, are you saved?
Or is he looking away?
Do you pay for your sins?
For the faults of man

[Solo]

Relief as you speak from within
Release the thoughts that bind you
The halo is short lived
You're ill-equipped to change
Accept what you've become
And that you can't be saved
You take a unpure thought
To fill the empty grave

The stained glass walls
Won't change what you feel
You reach for the cloth
To harness the rage you conceal

To your god, are you saved?
Or is he looking away?
Do you pay for your sins?
For the faults of man

[Solo]

You are the bastard's son
You are the devil's disgrace
You are what you've become
You've fallen from grace

The stained glass walls
Won't change what you feel
You reach for the cloth
To harness the rage you conceal

To your god, are you saved?
Or is he looking away?
Do you pay for your sins?
For the faults of man
