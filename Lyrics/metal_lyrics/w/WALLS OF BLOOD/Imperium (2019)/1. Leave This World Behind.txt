[Vocals: Nils K Rue]

I release a quick fix from the fire
Changing of lights, anolomy strikes
Under my perception of all things in life

Let me no more dream of nightmares
The fire of Hell then would save me

[Solo]

In my sleep I'm always forgiven
Forgiven by life, forgiven by death
Father forgive me for I have sinned

My dreams always turn into nightmares
The bringer of death then will save me

[Theme solo]

Drifting further away, star of death leads the way
I'm ready to leave this world behind
The fire will cleanse me, from sins
The curse will be lifted

So ready for my leave
Leave this world behind
I'm leaving this world behind
I'm ready for my leave
To leave this world behind
I'm leaving this world behind

[Solo]

Damn this curse that became my creation
Abandoned in life, abandoned in death
My only perception is to be born again

I will no more dream of nightmares
The resurrection will be there to save me

Drifting further away, star of death leads the way
I'm ready to leave this world behind
The fire will cleanse me, from sins
The curse will be lifted

So ready for my leave
Leave this world behind
I'm leaving this world behind
I'm ready for my leave
To leave this world behind
I'm leaving this world behind
