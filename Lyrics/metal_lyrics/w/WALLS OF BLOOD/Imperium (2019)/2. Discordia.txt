[Vocals: Todd Latorre]

Hail Dumah, thousand-eyed angel of death coming your way
Breath fire silence is all that is left nothing to say (nothing to say)
As you're falling wide awake pleading for your life
Lost all sense of time and space sifting through the lies

So you think you're at the end, remembering the cries of those you loved
No escape the time draws near damn the gods from above

Cry sinners
Drown in the sorrows of guilt to set your soul free
Scarred from a system, social condition supreme, monarch machine

So you think you're at the end, remembering the cries of those you loved
No escape the time draws near damn the gods from above
How many times did I deny?
Pathetic, prophetic hypocrisy you live by?
In the end your final stand is a mystery

Fireâ¦ Slithering through the hourglass
Fireâ¦ Screams of pain preserved in time
Fireâ¦ Hidden in the cracks and crevices
Fireâ¦ A fortress of evil in your mind

[Solo]

Enter the darkness that's haunts you
Into the courtyard of death
Solicit salvation and mercy your final breath

So you think you're at the end, remembering the cries of those you loved
No escape the time draws near damn the gods from above
How many times did I deny?
In the end your final stand is a mystery
Fireâ¦ Slithering through the hourglass
Fireâ¦ Screams of pain preserved in time
Fireâ¦ Hidden in the cracks and crevices
Fireâ¦
