[Vocals: Henning Basse]

Pity on me will you take
As my soul sent to flight
Past the one's left behind
Never knowing
Hiding their souls in contempt
Hearing ill-fated cries
Oceans of souls
Seven spirits

Lord won't you please hear my cries
As I beg to be saved
Note as I drink from the chalice
Preventing me falling from grace
Redeeming my soul through confession
My hands to the sky
Imminence grist through possession
Seven spirits
Solo
Seven spirits
Although my eyes even now
Look of contention
When what has happened to me
If you've given redemption
Outcast unclean seven spirits
Leave mind with no trace
Seven spirits
