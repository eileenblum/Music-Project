[Vocals: Ripper Owens]

The mullered path through gates of deception
It's just prophetic insignificance
Welcome my friends to the failed resurrection
Decent to the madness now begins

Life of betrayal
Beneath the bleeding sky
Echoes the past
The bloods drips on us all

The faded cries of distress go unanswered
Leaving behind our shattered lives
Deliverance purify those who faulter
Wearing the mask of denial and lies

Life of betrayal
Beneath the bleeding sky
Echoes the past
The bloods drips on us all

There is no worth to your empty words
There is no future it's all are tarnished dream
Peering through the lens of observation
The growing depth of self deprivation

[Solo]

Domination by the hands of the monarch
We are exiled into oblivion
Life is nowhere death is everywhere
Cast down to nothing the image fades away

Life of betrayal
Beneath the bleeding sky
Echoes the past
The bloods drips on us all

There is no worth to your empty words
There is no future it's all are tarnished dream
Peering through the lens of observation
The growing depth of self deprivation
