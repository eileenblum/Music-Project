[Vocals: Matt Cuthbertson]

Look beyond the mask of deception
Enticing his victims to enter this visage of lies
Rendering those who are now fake believers
Countless betrayed left within these walls left to die

Screams now eroding from darkened deception, encasing their minds with a twisted perception
Once you come in you will never get out
Butcher deceiver
Retched bereave
Torture within walls of blood

Contained against will from the origins of hatred
Trapped in this labyrinth of death you will never escape
Bodies cremated and tossed into lime pits
Destructions of souls now encased in the walls of the dead

Screams now eroding from darkened deception, encasing their minds with a twisted perception
Once you come in you will never get out

Butcher deceiver
Retched bereave
Torture within walls of blood

[Solo]

Doors of the deprived contain the screams of the dying
Left to rot in prison rooms vanquished for months at a time
Gas line asphyxiation as he watches their demise
Historically chosen as grave minds think alike

Torture within walls of blood
Torture within walls of blood

Butcher deceiver
Retched bereave
Torture within walls of blood
Torture within walls of blood
