[Vocals: Dan Cleary]

Forgotten in time memories of fate cast a shadow
Enticing divine buried dreams now left alone
Among the agonies awaken codes of misery
Dwelling in fear haunted abyss

Some things should be left to burn (left to burn)
Those who tempted fate, you will learn

[Solo]

Progress of time becoming the merest illusion
Fictitious lies perceive the greatest delusion
Wretched in darkness those who dare to witness
Awaken the dark lords of sleep

Some things should be left to burn (left to burn)
Those who tempted fate, you will learn

Tombs disturbed shall reveal
Hideous horrors once concealed
The call of the dead emerges
You've tempted fate bear witness!!!

[Solo]

Buried dreams now wide awake nightmares
Cannot conceive how can this be real??
Screams of agony twisted reality
Never awaken the dark lords of sleep

Some things should be left to burn (left to burn)
Those who tempted fate, you will learn
