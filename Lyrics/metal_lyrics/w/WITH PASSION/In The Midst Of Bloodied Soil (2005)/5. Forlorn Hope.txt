My blood layers the surface revealing the loss of life words reversed to the one from this earth to see beyond the surface for what has been left behind. Desire the words from he who speaks greater than all with dark crestfallen vows. Words from the wise; the death of the right. The blood red tears upon the sight of death among us. The scent of life expires. The hope dies within.
