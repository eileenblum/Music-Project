You bleed till your blood turns black. Face down on the kitchen floor. Forever your life in hell. You'll see my fate at your hands. You take me to the ocean and give me your hand forever. They years of lifeless love. Your lifeless memory. And the night it comes to tear our blessed hearts apart to the sound of the blade as it's sharpened above this burial that is not empty for long. To say his name in the pace of mine at a time like this.
