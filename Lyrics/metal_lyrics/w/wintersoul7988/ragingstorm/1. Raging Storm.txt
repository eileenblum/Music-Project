Burn, winds of destruction will rage the skies
Clouds, fading the Sun into blacken pride
Rain, wash out the fields of this shattered land
Fall - Tears of sorrow from our Earth
Strike, lightning destroying the lives of man
Time, turning their deeds into molten sand
Cold, bring up the guilt for their faults
Now, watch for the time of mankindâs fall

[Chorus:]
Black Winds will bring despair
And call the raging Storm
Unleash the fields of flames
to the rise of the raging Storm
Hail to the Fury of the Storm
unfold the raging Storm
Bow to the wind and rain
for we are the raging Storm

Scream, thunder release all its fury now
Pray, pray humans fall to their knees and crawl
Death stalking the corners of this land
Lost, lives will be drown until the End

[Chorus]

See the waters rising up
Drowning all your selfish dreams
Man will pay for all their crimes
Burned and killed for their greed

[Chorus]
