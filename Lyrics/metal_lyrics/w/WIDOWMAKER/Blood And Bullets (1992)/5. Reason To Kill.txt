Ain't it cold tonight?
How the wind does blow
Icy fingers clutch my shoulder
How my trust in you
How was I to know?
Now I'm wiser, now I'm colder
So you used me
Then threw me away
Well, lord knows you had your reasons
Tried to play your game
But all you gave was pain
Tell me ain't that a reason to kill?

All my life it seems
Been spent building dreams
I knew
Would be broke by you
Lord, hoy I deplore
All that you stand for
And do
Now you're through.

When I look into your eyes
Your face shows your despise
Betrays how you hurt for the thrill
Well I've had it with your schemes
Your street of broken dreams
Tell me ain't that a reason o kill?
Well tell me, ain't that a reason to kill?

Soon will come a day
That you'll walk my way
Let's see
How you deal with me
So I'll bide my time
Put my pain in rhyme till when
I will rise again.

As hours turn to years
And dust dries my tears
The memories are all bitter pills
Cause you've ruined everything
Caused pain and suffering
Well now, ain't that a reason to kill?
Tell me ain't that a reason to kill?

Don't want to fell like I'm feeling
Don't want to do what I'll do
Never though I'd throw away my life over you.
