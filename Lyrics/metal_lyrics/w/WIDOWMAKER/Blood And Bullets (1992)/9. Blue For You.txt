Come and sit beside my baby
No, no, no
I don't need anything more
Move a little closer baby
Lord, lord, lord
I'm in heaven for sure
Speak softly whisper in my ear
I'm so lonely
And you're not really here.

I'm so blue for you
What else can I do?
So in love with you
Lord, lord,
I'm so blue for you
Heart is broke in two
Black'n' Blue for you
Lord, lord, lord
I'm so blue for you.

Gotta have your loving darling
No, no, no
Please don't leave me in the cold
Warm me by your fire baby
Lord, lord, lord
I'm the rock you gotta roll
I'm tired come and lie down here with me
I must be dreaming
Cause you're where I long to be.

First you want me
Say you need me
Then you tell me I'm a fool
Then you love me
Then you leave me
Oh you're breaking all love's rules
Well I know I'll love again
But I'll never love anyone more.

Speak softly
Whisper in my ear
I'm so lonely
And you're not really here.
