When you walked away
I saw the curtain start to fall
And as my blue skies turned to grey
I knew I lost it all
And as your smile began to fade
10.000 pictures filled my head
Of all the good and happy times we had
And feelings left unsaid
Too much was left unsaid?
Girl I want you to stay
I beg you I pray
Don't leave me this way
I've so much to say
Oh don't walk away
How long must I pay?

Calling for you
Calling for you
Lost without you
Nothing else matters
Can you see through?
All that I do
I'm calling for you
Now and forever more.

And if I told you how I feel
Girl would it change a single thing
Or were the times we had unreal
But nor the tears they bring
The memories they sting
Girl I want you to see
I need you with me
Oh please let us be
I've so much to give
Please let our love live
Oh can't you forgive.

Girl I'm tired and alone
My heart has no home
My tears they fall like stone
And now I'm afraid
Your feelings did fade
Can our love be saved?
