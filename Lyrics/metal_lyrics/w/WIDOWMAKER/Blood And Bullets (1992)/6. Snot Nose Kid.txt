You're coming on strong
You're right when you're wronged
You waited all night just to sing me your song
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You wanna be friends
I know that you would
You're up to no good
Sad and frustrated I'll miss understood
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's do it again
You're saying go, go, go
But mean no, no, no,
Well you better take it slow
Cause I'm not your father figure
There's one thing that I know.

You're a snot nosed kid
Nothing but a snot nosed kid
You should've thought twice before you did what you did
You're a snot nosed kid.

Your mountain are high
Your valleys so low
You're got the equipment, but it's just for show
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You wanna pretend
You cant to take gambles
You want to play games
I deal from the bottom, so glad that you came
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's play it again
You're saying go, go, go
But mean no, no, no
Well, you better take it slow
Cause I'm not your father figure
There's one thing that I know.

You're living your dream
You made the a-team
You're so disappointed it ain't all it seemed
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You're starting to bend
You gave it a shot
You gave all you're got
You'll probably make Ripley's believe it or not
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Will it ever end?
You're saying no, no, no
But mean go, go, go
Well, you better take it slow
Cause I'm not your father figure
There's one thing that I know.
