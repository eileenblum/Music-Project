Said you though
I was gonna be
Someone more like you
Someone less like me
So you fought
Every step I'd take
Try to second-guess
Every move I make
Tell me what did I say
Won't you tell me?
What did I do?
To get you to hate me like you do.

You gone badly
The preacher told me
You gone bad
I heard him say
How would he know anyway?
Yeash, yeah,
You gone bad.

So I'm bad, different from the rest
So I walk alone
Why are you so obsessed?
Why should I
Play the games you play
Should I worry you?
All the things people say
Tell me why should I care
Won't you tell me
What should I prove?
That I'm just as feeble and lost as you.

You gone bad
The preacher told me
You gone bad
I heard him say
How would he know anyway?

You gone bad the teacher told me
You gone bad I heard her say
How would she know anyway?
Yeash, yeah
You gone bad, bad, bad.

So tell me what did I say
Won't you tell me
What did I do?
To get you to hate me like you do.
