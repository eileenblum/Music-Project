Long way from home
Can't sleep at all
Rang your telephone
Something ain't right
Evil's going on
Well I'm just warning you brother
You better watch your happy home.

Long way from home
Can't sleep at all
Feels like a mule's kicking
In your stall
And that's evil
Evil is in your heart
Well I'm just warning you brother
You better watch your happy home
Watch your happy home.

Long way from home
Can't sleep at night
Feels like another mules kicking
Something just ain't right
And that's evil
Evil is going on
Well I'm a warning you brother
Watch your happy home.
