Pain is the cross we bear
Sentenced to life because we dare
To ask why things ain't fair
We'll take our share of pain
Hide our scars pretend we're sane
Cause ain't it all a game
And in the end it's the memories that remain
Out in the wild we're stronger
The more they're right we're wronger
There comes a time to walk away
When our night becomes your day.

We are the lonely ones
Lost, alone and gone astray
We are the guilty ones
Exiled and sentenced far away.

So, since we have the name
Maybe we'll play this little game
But we won't feel no shame
We'll fight this fight alone
As our feelings turn to stone
We're callous to the bone
It's the only way to survive this danger zone.

Our here you got to be stronger
Out here you're right when you're wronger
And if you fight and life to tell
You fight again this life is hell.

Out here you got to be stronger
Out here you're right when you're wronger
And if you fight and live to hell
You fight again, this life is hell.
