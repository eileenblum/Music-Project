Never thought much about right or wrong
Never thought much about what I've done
Never think much about what I'll do
Don't give a damn about when I'm thought.

Am I evil?
Girl i don't know
Am I evil?
Sent from below
Am I evil?
Born to be damned
Power crazed
Too depraved
Who says I am?

Am I evil?

Ask me why and I won't know
Ask me where and I won't show
Ask me when and I will lie
Ask me who spit in your eye.

Am I evil?
What's it to you?
Am I evil?
Compared to who?
Am I evil?
Death, where's thy sting?
How you dare
Point and stare
Who made you king?
