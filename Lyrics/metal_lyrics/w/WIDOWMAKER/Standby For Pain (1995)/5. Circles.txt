We had out time it's over
I've said my last goodbye
The lessons of a lifetime
I grieve but never cry
I live, but go through the motions
Can't seem to shake this devotion
My passion lived in your ocean.

You left me wandering around
Got me running in circles
Lost the strength that I found
Got me running in circles
Your memory cats a shadow
Your shadow walks with me
Your voice is now a whisper
I hear it endlessly
You haunt my every discretion
Your vision draws my attention
I break when your name is mentioned.

You left me wandering around
Got me running in circles
Lost the strength that I found
Got me running in circles
Now I'm running around
Got me running in circles
Where's the strength that I'd found
Got me running.

I'm living but go through the motions
Can't seem to shake this devotion.

You felt me wandering around
Got me running in circles
Lost the strength that I found
You got me running in circles
I'm still running around
You got me running in circles
God took the strength that I'd found
He's got me running.
