Say you struggle
The worlds down on you
Lost and lonely
Don't know what to do
Your misfortunes ain't all the appear.

Cry
A dying man's tears
Cry
A dying man's tears.

You got troubles
You think that you do
Say you suffer
You don't got a clue
Your few problems can't even compare.

Your petty worries
Ain't all they could be
Look all around you
Real life agony
Heartbreak and suffering
Go on endlessly
Now tell me
Is your life really all that bad?

Say you got troubles
I'm laughing at you
Say you suffer
Yeah, compared yo who?
Your life's crises are your cross to bear.
