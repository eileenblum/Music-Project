Pain in my heart
Pain in my soul
The kind of pain I pray that you
Will never know.

There ain't no right
There ain't no wrong
You never know just what to feel
Or for how long
Say you're a smooth operator
You keep your motor clean
Sooner or later it bring you to your knees.

When you find love
Stand by for pain
When you find love
Stand by for pain
Stand by for pain.

You never know
When it will choose
But you can bet the bank on this boy
You're gonna lose.

You got no choice
You got no say
There's ain't a chance in hell of leaving
You better pray.

So if you think you're the exception
You think you'll walk away
Don't fall for that deception
Everybody's got to play.

Say you're a smooth operator
You keep your motor clean
Sooner or later it bring you to your knees.
