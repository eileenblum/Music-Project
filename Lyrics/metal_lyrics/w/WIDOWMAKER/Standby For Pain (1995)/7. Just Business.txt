Prying is for sinners
Losers and beginners
Yeah, it's just business
Watching all the big boys
Taking all the kids toys
Yeah, it's just business.

It's just business
Its just business
Its just business
It's nothing personal.

Corporations mandate
Profiteering dictates
Yeah, it's just business
Crush the opposition
With practiced precision
Yeah, it's just business.

Fast and efficient
Emotionally distant
Yeah, it's just business
Cold and resourceful
Never remorseful
Yeah, it's just business.
