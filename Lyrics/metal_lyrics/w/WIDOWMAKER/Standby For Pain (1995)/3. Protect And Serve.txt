Don't tell us your story
Don't tell us you tried
You swore to uphold it
You swore and you lied
You let down the people
You let down the law
Your sisters, your brothers
You turned on us all.

The pride of the city
The guardian in blue
Of duty and honor
You don't have a clue
Don't tell us you're human
That truth is quite clear
We're lost our faith in you
We know whom to blame.

Protect and serve...

With every discretion
You're losing out trust
Your image is tarnished
Your badges in the dust
The shame of your family
The shame of the force
Your selfish indulgence
You felt no remorse.

Pray for our protectors
May god keep them strong?
Their purpose is noble
Protect us from wrong
Remember that honor and duty are one
There's more to a cop
Than a badge a gun.
