Time doesn't heal the pain
An old aged spark of wickedness
Carried on for too long...way long
Frozen blood determination
To grind...

For all the wasted years
For all the suffering
For all these fallen tears
The hate grew up with me

[Chorus:]
I must play my role, I can't hear your pleas
I'll pay the price, but you'll never bring me to my knees
Thus it ends, just like Abel and Cain
This is what anger makes. Is love the origin of hate?

The deadly knife was held high
Before all flashbacks came to my mind
Leading me to a time with no grief
The time when grief was born
The magma in my veins...claims for your life
And no one will survive
Here you end
Here you die
