She lives in the middle of nowhere
Far from the sea
Breathing out smoke, staining air
with grime and dirt
(She is evil)

Randomly grown with no purpose and
Uncontrolled 
Proud and meant to be
The greatest of all

On your door says:
"Em de ce ce el
ex ex u triple i"

[Chorus:]
Welcoming everyone with wide open legs
As gentile, as hostile as the gates of hell
You are used like a whore to start and learn
Then they leave and forget 'cause you are
Soulless... Soulless...

Through your holes
Deep down your throat
Moving through
Your bowels

Haters crawl
To knock at your door
No one else
Has what you have got

You own our money
You make your laws
So expensive
For such a service
