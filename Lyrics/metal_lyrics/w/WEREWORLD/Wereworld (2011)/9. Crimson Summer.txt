Broken dreams
Unrealized fantasies
So many pictures
Will lay unseen
Your sins
Your inability to feel
Are flags worth more
Than families?

[Bridge:]
Take one more life
The sacrifice made
For your land

[Chorus:]
When we leave our humanity for a while
We fail...
While she buries her son and says goodbye
âGod please:
Give me back this child of mineâ

Stand by games
Laughters not heard again
Phone calls from friends
Ringing in vain
A plane a train
As tools to threat
Did God ask you for?
Did he fail?

[Bridge:]
Kill one, kill five
May a thousand be worth your trip to Paradise!

[Chorus:]
I feel faith from the very depths of my heart
Is fading
While she buries her son and says goodbye
âGod please:
Give me back this child of mineâ
