Blood is blood
And youth will never forget the sacrifice
To the point of making them immortal
Eye per eye, a revenge for their lives
My guitar sings blue chords
For those who still remain
Fighting death in a chess game

[Chorus:]
Feel our fear as our hearts
are getting out from our mouths
Blinded and covered my eyes are
My breathing gets loud in the dark
Stay high though fear takes the lead
Pray to the Lord and hold up your heads
'Cause though life won't reach tomorrow
They will come: the offspring of the undead

First days of May
The first carnage
It won't end the fight

Third day of May
A portrait in which
dead will survive

The children of the undead...
