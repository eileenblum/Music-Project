Red lights, alarms,
Warnings announced my birth
A first vision of Earth
Today a child was born
That'd be better dead
A danger for our webâ
Letâs go!

Bewitched by their spell
Threatened from all around
I grew in innocence
Those forgotten years
That marked my fate
Soon, I realized
Something was going wrong
Things werenât what they seem
Never what they seem.

And then in class when
Imagination began to flyâ¦
âJust look at the board!â
(Of fools where we all learned their rules)
To be robotized, for what? For what!
To make some flesh mince with your brain
To morph your soul and thoughts
And fate.

Teens are blind to see
Far beyond their nose,
To watch the strings
Puppets have been made
Vampires and tech-mages
Control the great companies
Where science goes on with the
Copyright of your DNA.

I feel like I'm in darkness
Not in my real home
Too small for me
To take a breath of air
This, a machinery
All must work well
But I am a piece which
is out of place

[Chorus:]
Pass this room, take a look to the real world
There's a disguise of fire as snow
Through a large looking glass there's a wereworld
Which no one wants to see
And no one wants to speak about

This is the world you live in
Which tries to make you a slave
Just think by yourself
Remember, never it's too late

Run out from this shapeshifter world
You have time before werewolves find you

[Chorus:]
Pass this room, take a look to the real world
There's a disguise of fire as snow
Through a large looking glass there's a wereworld
Which no one wants to see
Where no one wants to live in
And no one wants to speak about
