Too young to understand
Too tired to fight
For a sacred murder... a bitter lie
For this you have to die
"I'm afraid and no one cares
I would try to run... maybe it's too late"
The tongue of the Fate licks your neck
It's the lost of innocence

"How is the sea?"
The place you'll die in
It's all around, can't you see?
"I had a dream"
'Bout the moment
of your life when you'll finally rest in peace

[Chorus:]
Take away the sun
It dries off our sweat
Our tears, our blood
The hour's close at hand
Now we have reached the end

Thus commands a thorn-crowned man

It's the night in which our worst nightmares
and inner fears come true
So we don't hold any hope
And march towards our doom
In the night, bloody night
When our blood reaches the skies
Covers the stars above
And stains a silver moon

"Why they call it sin
to see the whole world as it really is?
"I know IÂ´ll leave"
This is right my son
Your aged heart has tasted
The frozen steel
