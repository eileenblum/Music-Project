Six thousand million lives and
one single scream looking for thy grace
Anger, envy, avarice, lust and pride
condemned human race
Through years we've watched 
and we've tried to guide them
but deaf words were like smoke
God spoke, the choice is taken
"You all have damned the world"

And now we shake with the vision 
of the brightest angelic-lighting force
It was written in the zodiac
"...and justice will come from
far beyond the stars..."

Look up to the sky and fear His light
that will clean all mankind
They are shinning like thousand suns 
made as one

"We have come through 
to destroy you all
The choice is taken, godforsaken
a Requiem for the World"

Six hundred thousand angels and
only one man can send them back to hell
"You've said you're messengers of God and his
will, but what God commands I don't care!"
Seraphim Michael, she leads the army
asking why her Lord
"Oh, why the slaughtering of thy creation
if You have infinite love?" 

Fighting 'till death even though the enemy
is an angel,a demon, a Godâ¦ 
The last vestige of hope lies
on a few, defenders of the Homo Sapiens

The spark of life shines brighter 
very far from being extinct
Nothing, nor even a Supreme God can fade out 
the human survival instinct

"Dark" is your name 
and dark is your way
Dragon Warrior, you are the savior
who can light this day
you'll know where you came from 
you'll know what you fight for
In heavens they called you "Morning-light"
the great archangel 
Lucifer...

The fight for life hasn't come yet
there is still a long journey
against God himself 
and men will never be the same
Walk across the bridges of hell
and step into the heaven's golden stairs
to face God himself
and men will never be the same
Cultures and countries, religions
united as one
forgotten differences
No longer blinded by the Supreme Master
THE KILLING CAN BEGIN

"We have come through
to destroy you all
The choice is taken, godforsaken
A Requiem for the World"
