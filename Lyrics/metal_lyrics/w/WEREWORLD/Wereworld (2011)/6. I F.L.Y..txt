Free for
A change of seasons
I have my reasons
Not sure if we should
Pain is at the end 

Black and white
Dark and bright
How to combine two different poles
Two different worlds
Assured collision
Shy phone calls
And translations
That's how I heard it for the first time:

And I'll fly tonight
And I will until we die
Everything's fine by your side
I F.L.Y.

One kiss
It's all like a dream
Ten days so charming
Their end distress me
Will we meet again?

Truth and lies
Seer and blind
We roam the streets of the unknown
A city full
of contradictions
God, I know this won't work
and I won't let this chance pass by

'Cause I'll fly tonight
And I will until we die
Everything's fine by your side
I F.L.Y.

And I'll fly tonight
And I will until we die
Everything's fine by your side
And I...
And I'll fly tonight
And I will until we die
I will survive if you are mine
I F.L.Y.
