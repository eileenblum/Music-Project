I am the only way
I will lead you astray
Choking on your dreams
A horrorscape extreme

They'll never see me coming
Dethroned by darkest hours

You'll see your life end by my hands
A final rasp of gasp and nothing more, only death.

I am the forest-void
I am the beyond

A suffocating mist
The pain deep within
They'll never see me coming
A swallowing doomsayer

You'll see your life end by my hands
A final rasp of gasp and nothing more, only death.

A wind of sorrow
A phage in your soil
Your choice
Your doom...

You'll see your life end by my hands
A final rasp of a gasp and nothing more, only death.
I curse all whom dares to enter here
All men shall die as I plague your land
