Only endless dark waters ahead
Are we being fooled and misled?
Over yonder nothing but heavy night
The grim cold keeps blinding our sight

For every fathom forward
Two hundred ones back
Ultima Thule our goal
'Til our minds are blank

Boundless and monstrous!
A triumphant tyrant
Titanic and unforgiving!
Shipwrecked by the giant.

As blackness and winter seeps through
The horizon in a pale ghostly hue
As men starts to subside
Overthrown by arctic demise

For every fathom forward
Two hundred ones back
Ultima Thule our goal
'Til our minds are blank

Northbound and forgotten
A tale lost by the weight of the ocean
Bereaved and bereft
Shipwrecked my mans devotion

Human driftwood
as month elapse
Body, soul and
sanity collapse

Finding shelter
in dreams of death
I smile and sigh and...
as I draw my last breath

As the watery tomb embraces you
An oceanic afterlife brews anew
Taste life's bitter fruit first hand
As the darkness withdrew, land!
