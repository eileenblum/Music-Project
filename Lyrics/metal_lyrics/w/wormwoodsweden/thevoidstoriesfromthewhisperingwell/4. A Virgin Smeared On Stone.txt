Years of innocence
Long past gone
Her faith is sealed
Sanity lessen

Dragged to the hill
Apathy set in
Stiff as the dead
Now close your eyes

Oh no! Save us from our sins!
Our flesh is the fault!

Hear her cry
Blow (after) blow
Hear her scream
Crushing, grinding, die
A virgin smeared on stone

A bludgeoned bag
Beyond recognition
Family in tears
A life is gone

Hanged up high
Hysteria arise
Shown to the gods
Folie รยก deux

Oh no! Save us from our sins!
Our flesh in your hands!

Hear her cry
Blow (after) blow
Hear her scream
Crushing, grinding, die
A virgin smeared on stone

The screams from a poor, tender girl
Echoes forever as the world unfurls
Nothing will remain the same
Man or god, who's to blame?

Bones cracking, snapping, collapsing
A virgin smeared on stone again
Stone meets stone in endless repeats
A virgin lost by the hands of faith
