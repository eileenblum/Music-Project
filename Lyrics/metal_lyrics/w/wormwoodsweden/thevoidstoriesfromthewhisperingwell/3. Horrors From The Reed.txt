They spawn, they crawl, they squall
Save your life
They eat, they feed, they breed
No more time

Fear their screams
Heed the call

Inside, outside, townswide
Here they come
Maiming, rending, chewing
No more hope

Fear their screams
Heed the call

The Cult bequeath fear
Visions of death appear
Terrors darkest seed
Horrors from the reed

They'll run, they'll hide, they'll fright
All in vain!
Praying, praying, praying
All in vain!

Read the psalms
Clasp your palms

The Cult bequeath fear
Visions of death appear
Terrors darkest seed
Horrors from the reed

Now barren, now cold, devoid
No more will
Ora frustra mortis terrore
All will fall!

Read the psalms
Clasp your palms

The Cult bequeath fear
Visions of death appear
Terrors darkest seed
Horrors from the reed
