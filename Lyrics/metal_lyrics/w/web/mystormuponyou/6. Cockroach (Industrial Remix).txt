Through the ages we have killed
Everything is gone at once
See the world loosing its face
Fragile human existence

Father hear me
Iâm a slave
Make me a master
Take me away

The final prophecy is fulfilled
Nuclear ending menace
No surviving is arranged
Children of the decadence

Father hear me
Iâm a slave
Make me a master
Take me away

Mankindâ¦ meet your future kings

Now Beloved, I shall have to leave you.
With the promise, to meet you again,
upâ¦ to the city of the stars

Father hear me
Iâm their slave
Make me a master of myself
And take me away
