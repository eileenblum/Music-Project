A shade of grey wonders through my sky since your white lies unveiled their shadows
You lead my world into complete defy and always showing of your fake halo
You want to tell me how it is, to be a fail of lies?
You want to tell me how it is, to see the truth only in my eyes?

You want to tell me how it is, to feel my storm upon you?
You want to tell me how it is, to hear my thunder strike?

You want to tell me how it is, to see me stand tall?
You want to tell me how it is, to be afraid of my storm?
You want to tell me how it is, to always fear that I might unfold you?
You want to tell me how it is; running away from the truth that haunts you?

I can see the skies; they are coming down to me
Clouds collide and grow and let the rain wash over me

I am still alive, my river flows.
The spirits protect me and my power grows.
You want to tell me how it is, to know you owe me all the gifts of your fake life and all the pride you stole of me?
