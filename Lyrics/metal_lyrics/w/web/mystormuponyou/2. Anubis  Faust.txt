Come
Approach
My trusty jackal's nose
Don't try to lie
Cause I can smell your hide

Leave your body
Leave this body now
Your face can stay
Upon this golden mask you made

The brave in heart
Can claim eternal life
My scales of truth
Will need sufficient proof

Their balance depends
On how your soul weights
To walk with Gods
The jaws of chaos you must pass

Anubis
My soul is so light
And as this feather I can fly

Anubis
Don't let me wither and die

I am proud for what I am
The guardian of the dead
Appointed by the gods
To be their final judge

Anubis
Don't let me wither and die 

All my life I strived to gain insight to things that sacred most men
Through the dungeons of the mind I learned the tricks playing with fire
Evil wears a weird facade invented to protect man's hate
For the painful, The unknown, The feared and the forbidden

I dreamed the devil was I
My quest complete
I dreamed the devil was I
I was awake
My quest complete
Faust

Captive from philosophies that root on hopes like rotten trees
I see the hanged men on their ropes
Which harvester will rip these crops?
If their soul deserved a dime their chance is lost - No bargain now
I want now all that I can get
Riches, Power, Pleasure without end

I dreamed the devil was I
My quest complete
I dreamed the devil was I
I was awake
My quest complete
Faust
I dreamed the devil was I
Faust
