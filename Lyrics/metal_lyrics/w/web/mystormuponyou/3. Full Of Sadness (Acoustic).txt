As I stand alone in a room
Looking more like a tomb
I can sense you coming to me
Rejoicing at my misfortune
Your dark figure before me
Flashes like thunder
And I pray darkness gives birth to another fantasy
And I kneel below a sky of dusk
And my star is showing me a way
Full of sadness
Full of sorrow
Full of tears
Full of pain
Full of you

Donât leave me now
I donât want to see the dawn
I want to be with you
Right here bellow the stars
And I kneel bellow a sky of dusk
And my star is showing me a way
Full of sadness
Full of sorrow
Full of tears
Full of pain
Full of you

Heâs coming
Heâll cure me
I hope that Iâll see you again
Goodbye... goodbye... goodbye...
Farewell... (He said and he died)
