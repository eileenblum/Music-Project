Sunset,
The advocates of darkness now behold
The source of darkened mysteries untold
The passport to sins' limbo
The trigger of instinct's libido

Drawn me in bright red tears
Exile the ghosts of my fears
Beg me to swallow my pure blessed blood

Dig in my scars and look deep
The demons that scream in my sleep
Kneel and suck my divine blessed blood

Moonrise,
The softness a ray licks my cheek
And turns me into a demonic mind freak
Your body a non-will sculpture
Self trained to offer me its splendor

Touch me, touch me
Be the river to reborn my fever
Call me, cry at me
Bring me the life and accept these drops of blood
