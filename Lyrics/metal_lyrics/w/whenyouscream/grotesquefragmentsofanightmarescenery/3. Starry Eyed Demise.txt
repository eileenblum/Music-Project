what a fucking fool I've been
in an evil mood of life
external beauty faded
me in a game of bites
what a fucking greed it was
to take a look inside
diamonds seemed to hide
behind this drapes of of snakes

[Chorus]
As i fell into
this black heaven in her eyes
Realized so cruel
my starry eyed demise

so I reached for her hands
to understand her sorrow inside
how helpless I've been
in our game of bites
as I opened my eyes
in a hurricane of light
a curse became my life
through this second of paradise

a stone inside

sadistic bonds
longing for death
into the gates
of demon flesh

medusa's smile was bitter
a fact for me to trust
in a resort
to blast this stone to dust
a poison way to handle
such a beauty in life
addicted to death
I found a way to hide

what a fucking fool I've been
in an evil mood of life
external beauty faded
me in a game of bites
what a fucking greed it was
to take a look inside
diamonds seemed to hide
behind this drapes of of snakes

[Chorus]
As i fell into
this black heaven in her eyes
Realized so cruel
my starry eyed demise

sadistic bonds
longing for death
into the gates
of demon flesh
