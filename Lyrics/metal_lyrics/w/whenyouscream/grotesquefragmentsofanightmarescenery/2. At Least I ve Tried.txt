buried in traps struggling through wires
never forget to whet your claws and walk around eyes open wide
to be a typhoon to become a morbid sky
in this flaming pit called life
and if I lose, at least I've tried

[Chorus]
to resist the fake - walk around eyes open wide
to resist the fake - walk around heart open wide

my eyes they are so blinded by
your sunshine of fake and dastard smiles
my heart I cut it out for you
just to show it is opened wide

step by step I m bounded in
focused on my believes
whatever it is a flaming pit of life
and we all are burning bright

[Chorus]
to resist the fake - walk around eyes open wide
to resist the fake - walk around heart open wide

buried in traps struggling through wires
never forget to whet your claws and walk around eyes open wide
to be a typhoon to become a morbid sky
in this flaming pit called life
and if I lose, at least I've tried

the engine will be my will
searching for a piece of truth
in a labyrinth of selfish prayers
in a hall of fallen gods

and we lose so much for nothing
so many dreams we sell for shit
but I know we play on the same field
so lets play brutal heart open wide

oh my thoughts you won't bleed
for their demon wine
cause their darkest enemies
now see eyes open wide

[Lead - Chris]

buried in traps struggling through wires
never forget to whet your claws and walk around eyes open wide
to be a typhoon to become a morbid sky
in this flaming pit called life
and if I lose, at least I've tried
