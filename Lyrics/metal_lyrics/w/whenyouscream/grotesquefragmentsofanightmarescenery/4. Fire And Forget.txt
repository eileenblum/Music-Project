brutal shame in my chest
bullets of hate in theirs
a mission a execution
they fire and forget
horror scenes in my eyes
a mother cries it out
people are fucking dying
and who is to blame our god

my hands chatter
I break everything I believed in
in this human state
To armour our world we choose we choose their death

we fire and forget...

so ask yourself how can you sleep at night
when you are dressed in blood
in your selfish life
so ask yourself is our freedom right
when they starve at night
we think of peace and love

we fire and forget...

my hands chatter
i break everything I believed in
in This human state
to armour our world we choose their death

we fire and forget...

our cash for their misery our saints for their hell
please keep your fucking mouth shut these kids won't laugh again
and our stupid media don't you think we're right
money, sex and violence but only the last in their life

their tears in our waterfalls our god drinks their blood
muddy prayers teach us some demons there were shot
and our stupid media don't you think we're right
money, sex and violence but only the last in their life

we fire and forget...
