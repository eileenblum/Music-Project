for too long...

[Chorus]
I walked this darkened path
it's time to change my mind
to embrace the light
and end this fucking suffering

in ice cold nights
I chase the fire in me
always in search of meaning
I love hate and hate live
fake eyes in false guides
pretend to own me
fake eyes and wrong minds
follow me

[Chorus]
I walked this darkened path
it's time to change my mind
to embrace the light
and end this fucking suffering

for too long I walked beside them
every step was feeding hell
I was loosing light
loosing life

beside this path there is a gate
what is the key to open
moments of rest in sense
feelings I have forgotten

to vanquish

now I scream within - we have to take and choose
now I fight within - fucked up in dust I lose

to set this fire - the flames within
destroy and built within - to hide to rest in shades
to be born again in blood - to be alive in endless flames
destroy and built within - to be alive in endless flames

vanquish

[Chorus]
I walked this darkened path
it's time to change my mind
to embrace the light
and end this fucking suffering

I walked this darkened path
it's time to change my mind
to embrace the darkness
and end this fucking suffering
