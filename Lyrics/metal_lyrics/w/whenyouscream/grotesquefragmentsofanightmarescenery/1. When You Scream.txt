this light so bright
is the last thing you will ever see
it burns straight through your eyes
it brings the end of this tragedy

and when you awake
you will recognize
the end of this dream has not come
and the blood in your veins becomes ice

how can I explain these words in my horror days
as a gun child in a war that I fucking hate
how can I return to this glade that used to be so green
as a scarecrow on a field that is fucking rot and dry
when my thoughts are enemies and illusions friends of mine
when I scream they bleed and suffer
when I scream they fucking die

[Chorus]
this is your last dream
a fucking scary nightmare
that means
when you scream
no one will hear you
this is your last dream
a fucking deadly nightmare
that means
when you scream
no one will hear you

the days are getting shorter
every night longer than the last
soon the time will come
when you will not wake up again

there is nothing you can do
the dark side of your soul
rising, devouring, killing
beating you up in your fucking dreams

[Chorus]
this is your last dream
a fucking scary nightmare
that means
when you scream
no one will hear you
this is your last dream
a fucking deadly nightmare
that means
when you scream
no one will hear you

when my dreams are enemies..
