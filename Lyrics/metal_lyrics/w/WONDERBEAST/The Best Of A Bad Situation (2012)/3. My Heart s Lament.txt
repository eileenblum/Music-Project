Oh, to bring back the Glory Days!
Oh, to spend my time there!
Such sweet romances I yearn for!
Miss for; burn for!

If only to be bright again,
my heart laments for happy days.

Oh, to bring back the Glory Days!
Oh, to spend my time there!
All the people Iâll never see!
Beside me; without me!

If only to belong again,
my heart laments for happy days.

Oh, to bring back the Glory Days!
Oh, to spend my time there!
Everything that Iâll never do...
Once more or twice more...

If only to be me again,
my heart laments for happy days.

Oh, to bring back the Glory Days!
Oh, to spend my time there!
To be with her forever there!
Safer there, keep us there!

If only to feel love again,
my heart laments for happy days.
