I am awaiting the darkness to fall.
Protect me as I hide, I fear their call.

Monsters...outside.

They smell our fear, our sadness, our pain.
Theyâre celebrating their ill-fated reign.

Tragic beasts - theyâre flying to the City in the Sky!
Our last hope â our last defence will fall before
Our eyes!

Mine is the body theyâll use for their feast.
My innocent flesh will taste so sweet.

Monsters...inside.

They will denounce the most holy god.
Bad blood shall not stain the house of the lord.

Tragic beasts - theyâre flying to the City in the Sky!
Our last hope â our last defence will fall before
Our eyes!

Sanctus Abbas, servo nos...
Scelestus bestia provicisor!
Nos vox, permissum nos existo
Unis per invicem.*

In the name of our God
we will fight for the City in the Sky, so divine.
We will fight for the City in the Sky, so divine.
We will fight for the City in the Sky, so divine.
We will fight for the City in the Sky!

In the name of our God
we will fight for the City in the Sky, so divine.
We will fight for the City in the Sky, so divine.
We will fight for the City in the Sky, so divine.
We will fight for the City in the Sky!

[*Loose translation: "Holy Father, save us, wicked beasts march! We cry - let us be one with each other!"]
