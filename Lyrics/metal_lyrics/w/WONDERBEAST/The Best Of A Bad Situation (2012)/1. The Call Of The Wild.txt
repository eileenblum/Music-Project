Can you hear a thunder rolling?
Death knell calling, death knell tolling?
Canât you feel the ground is shaking?
Dancing to the sound theyâre making!

Beasts of earth they charge like thunder,
Fire spits up from down under!
Red devil-glow in their eyes
they run Past you â to Mother Gaia!

Theyâve heard the call of the wild!
The call of the wild â itâs the call of the wild!
Theyâve heard the call of the wild!
The call of the wild â itâs the call of the wild!

Look to the sky blacking out the sun
Are beasts of feather way above,
No colour coats their wings,
Only just the dust rides them now!

And with their wings they beat you deaf!
Keep your ears covered and your head down!
Their squawks break the silent wind
Hide to cover, run and duck!

Get out of the way lest you be killed,
You cannot stop these beasts you fool!
Make sure you get to higher ground,
Get inside â do not make a sound!

Children stand paralyzed with fear,
As this stampede of hooves draws near,
Their bodies break â their bones are snapped!
The beasts tear their path!

Theyâve heard the call of the wild!
The call of the wild â itâs the call of the wild!
Theyâve heard the call of the wild!
The call of the wild â itâs the call of the wild!

Skimming across the sand come the snakes,
Out of deep fissures and from lakes.
Their scales are covered in ancient dust
And hissing joins the chorus.

Underneath the legs of the herd
beasts Like a black wave â if you stand still,
A silent death overcomes you,
and Youâre dragged under the sand!

What was once our town that we did keep
Is now a blackened earthen heap,
The dust has settled and come knee-deep,
The beasts have torn their path!

And what was the thing that made run?
And will it ever happen again?
We live in fear that we may hear again,
The call of the wild!

The call of the wild!
The call of the wild â itâs the call of the wild!
Theyâve heard the call of the wild!
The call of the wild â itâs the call of the wild!
