We are all angels with only one wing...
The only way we fly is to embrace... *

An eye for an eye makes the world go blind... **
No... No... No... No...
The universe is like the sea,
but weâre only on the shore.
The human race is like a ticking time-bomb,
Of corruption, violence, and disease!

The world is dying â we need to stop!
The world is dying â we need to change our ways!

The world is dying â we need to stop!
The world is dying â we need to change our ways!
