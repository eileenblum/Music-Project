[Music: Stelios "Allarich" &amp; WOLFCRY]
[Lyrics: Stelios "Allarich"]

Iron angels fly above
Stand and rule with iron hand
The battle came with fire and storm
Blood and death are coming on

And the hell's fire grows up
Spreading fear

[CHORUS:]
Vanguard - looked with fire in eyes
Vanguard - spartan warriors come
Vanguard - seen with ice and steel
Vanguard - sons of death shall weld

They're three hundred all alone
Seem like born from death and storm
Hear their anguish hades' fall
One by one accept death's call

When the battle angels
Bringing death
