[Music: WOLFCRY]
[Lyrics: Costas Hatzigeorgiou]

Waking up at nights, I'm the ruler of darkness
King of the night
Full moon is rising, my eyes are shining
As i look to the light

My life's a misery
My destiny's cursed
Hunted for eternity
A private hell

[CHORUS:] Metamorphosis [x2]

Thirsty for blood, i only wish for death
Just to survive
Who can save me? only a silver bullet
Only a single shot

There is no escaping, my desperate howling
My silent cry
Trapped in a body, i am a wolf
(A Wolf) With Human Heart

So i wait for the time
My destiny's cursed, hunted for eternity
A private hell
