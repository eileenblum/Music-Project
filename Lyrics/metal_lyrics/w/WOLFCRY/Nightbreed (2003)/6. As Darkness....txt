[Music: WOLFCRY]
[Lyrics: Andreas "The Wizard"]

As the darkness comes down
And the moonlight appears
This is when we arise
And our power reveals

Among oceans of time
Through the haze of the night
With the wolfpack we howl
Under our sacred oath

[Chorus:]
moongleam is shining, fire is burning our soul
Nothing can stop us, our army is marching on
We are the rulers, we are the masters of fate
Hungry for glory, we will defeat and prevail

Our victory calls
(Our) enemies we provoke
With fury we ride
Like a thunderstorm
