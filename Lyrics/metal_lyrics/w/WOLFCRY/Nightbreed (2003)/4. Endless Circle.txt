[Music: WOLFCRY]
[Lyrics: Costas Hatzigeorgiou]

After the storm there's a calm
After the rain comes a rainbow
After darkness is light
And the seasons change every time
But there is winter... always all around

After a laugh there's a cry
After happiness, sadness
After the truth comes a lie
And an oath that you took now is broken
But there is no time... to realize

All is a circle, that turns around,
Around inside your head
All things are coming, again and again
And again inside you mind

...Will you survive, from this crawling pain?

After the storm [x2]
