[Music: WOLFCRY]
[Lyrics: Andreas "The Wizard"]

Running alone in the night
Empty thoughts in your mind
A power you cannot tame
Demons are calling your name

[CHORUS:]
Terror - flies through your soul
Fear - there is no hope
Horror - you close your eye
Pain - innocence dies

The blood is cold in your veins
You'll have to face their hate
This is the end of your life
You know they'll eat you alive

Flashing eyes under the moon
Hounding the place searching for you
Evil spirits into the dark
Nightmare creatures, they will attack
