[Lyrics: Costas Hatzigeorgiou]

I feel the silence, the silence that's around
The forest haunts my lonely heart
Only the fallen, the fallen leaves of trees
Is the only sound that I can hear

[CHORUS:]
But I'm far, my quest has just began
My journey seems like a neverending road
And from the start, I knew what I could find
But with the power of my soul
I know I can find the way

I hear the wolves howling to the moon
The night that surrounds the view
Am I closer? I do not know
So the fear has captured my soul

Oh how I wish, this nightmare would end
But I'm lost, I cannot find the way
Oh will I die without the sense of life?
There is no hope, will I ever find my way?
