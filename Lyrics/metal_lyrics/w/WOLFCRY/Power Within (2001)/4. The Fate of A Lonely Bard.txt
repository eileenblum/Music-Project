[Lyrics: Andreas "The Wizard"]

I am a homeless bard, follow my lonely path
Singing the songs of my time
Making the people smile, washing the tears from (their) eyes
But I feel pain deep inside

Waiting for the nighttime, when i' all alone
When my spirit's free to fly, then I'll sing my song

[CHORUS:]
Singing under moonless sky, singing just for me
Falling tears into the night, for my destiny
No one's there to listen to my music in the dark
This is when I have to face the fate of a lonely bard

And every single day, I follow my own way
Leaving my feelings behind
But when the night comes, I stand under the stars
And sing the song of my life
