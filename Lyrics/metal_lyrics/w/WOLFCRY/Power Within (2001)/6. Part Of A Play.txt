[Lyrics: Costas Hatzigeorgiou]

Lost in my thoughts, staring at the sky
Watching the sunrise, the memories still exist
All I keep thinking is the future that comes
All seem so close to the end of time

[CHORUS:]
I don't know what will follow
I can't believe in another day
Without a smile or a tear
We're all part of the play that takes place

A lonely path that leads to the abyss
That no one can escape in the end
An open grave the world we live in
So empty, cold and strange inside

Our destiny is written from the beginning of time
To suffer in a world that dust will be someday
A circle of pain that leads to sorrow
We are already gone, but we just don't even know
...How really does it end?
