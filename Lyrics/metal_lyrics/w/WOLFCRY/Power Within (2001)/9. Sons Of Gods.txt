[Lyrics: Andreas "The Wizard"]

They lived their life long ago
From fire and ice they were born
A proud race the sons of gods
And held the wisdom of the world

[CHORUS:]
Somewhere out of time - "sons of gods"
They'll be back from the skies

Great power in their hands
They were masters of the land
They sailed over wild seas
You will obey them on your knees

When time is right the skies will fall
The sons of gods will hear the call
The ancient ones will come again
To free the world and change our fate
