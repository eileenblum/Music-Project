[Lyrics: Andreas "The Wizard"]

Fires burning high, battle has begun
Wardogs are hungry
In the name of (our) lord, fighting for our land
Battlefield is red

In the battle we ride, for salvation we fight
For the king and our land, we stand together as one
Iron will in our hearts, blades that signs in our hands
Blood and death our allies, taste our dragonfire

[CHORUS:]
Wings of freedom by our side
We will now burn the sky
Evil eyes haunt the night
Waiting for our final time to die
See the fire in our eyes
Cry for our sacrifice
Riding on the twilight
Screaming our proud battlecry

For victory we ride, "freedom" we cry
The swords are bleeding
Arrows fly, horses kneel
The sun will now cry

Battleaxes to the wind killing spirit in our veins
Bones are broken
Blood in our hands, flesh torn apart
Neverending war
