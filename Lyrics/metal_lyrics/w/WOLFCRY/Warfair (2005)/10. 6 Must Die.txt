6 must die!!!
6 must die!!!
6 must die!!!
6 must die!!!

They come at midnight
With red shining eyes
They look for revenge
So their souls will get rest

A long time ago
Their ship crushed on rocks
No one survived
The lepers had to die...

Through the glowing fog
They're back for their gold
With scythes, hooks &amp; blades
Six lives they'll take
