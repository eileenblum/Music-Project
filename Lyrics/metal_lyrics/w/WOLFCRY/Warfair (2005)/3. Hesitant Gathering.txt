There is something in the air
That makes me feel scared
I hear voices everywhere
Spelling softly my name

I can see a thousand faces on the bedroom's walls
That really don't exist
As I watch them coming forward asking me
If I can set them free

Too scared to run too late to fight
I'm screaming...
Is this for real or is it dream?
I think I'm somewhere in between:

Broken chains on the ground
Bloody trails on my sheets
Hands that tighten my throat
Will someone rescue me?

Sparks that light up the darkness, mist that creeps
All through the pale floor
And as the morning comes I'm trying to realize
What the hell is going on?
