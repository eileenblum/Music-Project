There is no escape, your shadow has captured my mind
I have to find reality

Coming from within, haunting me
The truth unable to convince my feelings
The days of our past, won't be the last
Vision or a dream...lights my way

I will be here to stand by you
And you'll stand by me
I will be yours, you will be mine
One tear in time

[Chorus:]
Cry for soul's destiny
Try for the day
The day we'll meet again

The river of thought, words carved within
Shows the right way I want to stay
But in this scene of life, I do not act alone
This play is for two, I just dream of you
