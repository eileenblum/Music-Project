Dream forest, I have come to thee.
Insane I seek to be.
Poison toads follow me around
as I stalk your fruitful ground.

Ravens plucked out my lover's eyes.
Now I yearn for your bittersweet lies.
Despair has made me blind
and I need some peace of mind.

Mandrake and devilbane,
I seek to be insane.
Hemlock and henbane,
wrong blood runs in my veins.
Thorn apple and deadly nightshade,
with you I bless my blade.
Fly agaric and marsh tea,
give me madness, make me free.

Swamp spirits, enter me,
forever help me flee.
I choose insanity
instead of misery.

My love, you've not died in vain.
Beyond death we'll meet again.
In poison sleep I dream of you.
This sword will lead me through.
