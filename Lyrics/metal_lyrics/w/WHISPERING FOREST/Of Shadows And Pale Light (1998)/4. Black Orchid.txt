So empty,
like the life...
that ends...

When leaves come down,
They' ll rot away...
...So begins the end.
Consternation...
Hindsight only the shadow
in profound sadness,
effigy of me...

Just look at the flowers,
they all have died.
Seek the last inflorescence
So shall I...

Pick up the orchid,
the black one and only.
Now crown me with that,
and bless me goodbye...

Now pick up the orchid,
the black one and only.
Crown me with that,
please bless me goodbye...

I don't remember of me living.
What creature may have more pain?
I exist only in darkness,
so alone on autumn nights.

Now pick up the orchid,
the black one and only.
Crown me with that,
please bless me...
So empty,
like the life that ends...
