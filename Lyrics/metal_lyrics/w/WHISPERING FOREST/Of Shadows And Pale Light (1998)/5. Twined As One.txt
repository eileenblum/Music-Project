As I walk through the icy snow,
on my way to the winters beauty.
Dressed as the mourner.
Cold hoarfrost freezing tears in my eyes.

I'll consume your vicious piety my darling,
ruttish sights shall fade into the wind.

The spirits have found the vast calmness,
we are on our way to the garden of Eve.
Here under the verdant trees,
our souls have twined as one.

Here under the virgin trees,
our souls have twined as one.

Here is our shrine my darling,
bleeding together in the biting snow.
Under the snow drift now we are lying,
majestic white sheet has turned blood red.

With the winters blizzard we shall go
on our path to mighty shadow land.

Our souls have twined as one...
