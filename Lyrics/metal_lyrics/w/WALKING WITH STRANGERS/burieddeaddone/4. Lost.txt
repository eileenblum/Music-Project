Lost and all alone
Walking with broken shoes
To a place, called home
Time to rest
Time to tell
What we've done and what we've become
What we've become
Will you recognize my face
After I'm done
After I told you what we've become
Look into my eyes
I'm still your son
What have I become
Run away, fucking run away
From your fate
We will forever hold this pain
Running and running through the rain
Let's go home with this night train
Knowing that
We gave it our all
Our hope is lost
When we fall
We will know that
We gave it our all
Sing with me
We gave it our all
We will never forget
Look into my eyes
In the end, we are all dead.
