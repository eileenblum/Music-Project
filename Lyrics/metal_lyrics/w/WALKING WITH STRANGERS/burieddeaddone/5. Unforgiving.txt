Lift me up
Above the clouds
Tell me that I'm not insane
I can see the sun
And it is burning my eyes
To the ground
Time will tell
About a man made hell
This is my time
Goodbye, farwell!
Once again my eyes look up
I try to understand
Oh
I've been here so many times
Before, right here on this floor
Time will tell
About a man made hell
This is my time
Goodbye, farwell!
When my story ends
Another one starts
Answers locked, within hearts
Barely breathing
Praying to a god that I
Don't fucking believe in
And, if there is a god
I'm unforgiving
Because for everything
You've put us through
There no mistaking
We can't fucking trust you
This is it, you and me
We're through...
