We have something you should know
We will watch you fall
You have yourself to blame
To blame
You better lock your doors
Cus we are on our way home
We'll bury your life
The light of the sun is far
From your eyes when your 10 ft
Underground
Buried, dead &amp; done
We'll bury your life
10 ft underground
You better lock your doors
You better lock your doors
Cus we are on our way home
Way home
You better lock your doors
Cus we are on our way home
You better lock your doors
Cus we are on our way home
Everything you ever loved and the things
That made you whole are washed away for good.
