Push them down
Under the ground
Don't let them get to you
Make a small incision
Just enough to give you vision

I hold the key
And while they try to make you blind,
I'll make you see

Hold them down [x3]

I hold the key
And while they try to make you blind,
I'll make you see

Hold them down [x3]

From the day you were born
Til' the day you die
(WE'LL HAVE YOUR BACK)
While life passes by

They're not even close,
We're the untouchables

They tell you how to live
They show you what to do
They blind you with their visions of the truth

I hold the key
And while they try to make you blind,
I'll make you see

Hold them down [x3]

I hold the key
And while they try to make you blind,
I'll make you see

Hold them down [x3]

From the day you were born
Til' the day you die
(WE'LL HAVE YOUR BACK)
While life passes by
