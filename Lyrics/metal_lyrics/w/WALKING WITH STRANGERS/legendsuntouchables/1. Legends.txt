Frozen in time
A Legend slowly dies
A man made to
Be remembered
For his mistakes
And not his hardships

Time erases everything
But the falws in our lives
Killed, yet full of life

You're what they call
The living dead
What other people see
Is what you are
But not what you can be
Hold on to your beliefs
And you'll be greater
Than all

Frozen in time
A legend slowly dies

You'll be greater than all
You'll be greater than this

Your death will live in memories
Time can not kill who you are.
