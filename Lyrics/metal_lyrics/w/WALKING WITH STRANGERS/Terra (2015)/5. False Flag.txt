I turn my head inside out
To find myself somewhere in time

They call me soldier
But to me the word has no meaning

I turn my head inside out
To find myself somewhere in time

Fight to the end

There must be something more than this
I can feel it in my bones
If there are people I shouldn't trust
They are the ones

I find myself someday, somewhere
I find myself someday, somewhere

I seek comfort in family and friends
Who call me by my name

Fight to the end, is what they say
Fight to the end, is the only way

Fight to the end

But I'll still fight a war
If you can give me something worth fighting for

Fight to the end, is what they say
Fight to the end, is the only way

Fight to the end

I will never look back
And never surrender

I'm not alone
And I'm stronger than ever

I turn my head inside out
To find myself somewhere in time
