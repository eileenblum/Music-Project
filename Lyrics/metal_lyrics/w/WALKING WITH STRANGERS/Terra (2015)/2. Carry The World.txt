I'm so tired, waking up to an empty fucking house
Everything is spinning backwards, to a time where I didn't feel at home
Though wherever I go, my urge for life is gone

I need someone or something to light a fire in my heart
Something to long for, and something to want
Though the thoughts in my head are turning for the worse
I'm trying so hard but it feels like I'm cursed

I will outlast this, I will fight my way out
I'll find a new way of life, I'll bring strength back in my eyes

I know it's hard for you to see
But just you watch me

Watch me grow strong
See everything I've learned
Watch me carry the world

I'm not dead yet

I'll fucking swallow the pain
Give it my all
I'll crush the competition
Never backing down

And when Im at the top
Looking back down on you
Remember every fucking thing
You ever made me do

Fuck you

I've never felt more alive
I've never felt stronger
I won't be taking your shit any longer
Time has made me realise that being alone is not a weakness
Now I know who I am
And what I was born to do

Watch me carry the world
