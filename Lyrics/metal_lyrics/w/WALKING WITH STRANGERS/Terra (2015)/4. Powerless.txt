We are powerless

We are powerless
So we start questioning our own existence
Why are we here what is our purpose
We were never ment to understand never ment to know

I've lived a thousand lives
I've fought a million wars
Washed up dreams on empty shores

Life is an infinite circle, repeating itself forever

Wherever we are in our lives
We'll experience again

Without knowing it
Every bad decision
We'll decide again

We are powerless
So we start questioning our own existence
Why are we here, what is our purpose

We were never ment to understand

We've always felt so powerless
So powerless
