We gave our hearts to the wolves
Gave up everything we knew
For the things that we love
Prepared to do whatever it takes

Our eyes tells the stories of youth
Youth willing to sacrifice safety
For the dreams we dreamt
When we were young

We'll give it all for our dreams
Nothing can stop us
We rip the bonds apart
From the arms holding us back
From the arms that holds us back

You can fail at what you don't want
So do what you love

The cold will keep us strong
Northern winds in our backs
Nothing can stop us now

We don't fucking care
What the fuck you think
About our lives and choices
There's nothing you can do

The world won't stop spinning
Nothing will change
The heart of men
Will always dream of something more

The heart of men
Will always dream of something more than this

We'll give it all
For our dreams

Nothing can stop us
We rip the bonds apart
From the arms holding us back
From the arms that holds us back

You can fail at what you don't want
So do what you love.

The cold will keep us strong
Northern winds in our backs
Nothing can stop us now
