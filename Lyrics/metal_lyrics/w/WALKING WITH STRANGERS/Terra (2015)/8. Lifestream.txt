We distinguish ourselves from
Our very own source of life
Not believing we are part of it
As much as anything else

It's who and what we are

Separation is only an illusion

We are high as the mountain
Deep as the ocean
We are burning like the sun
Cold as the winter

We are nature itself
You hide who you are
In those corporate clothes
You put on, day after day

You hide who you are
In those corporate clothes
You hate, day after day

So close your eyes
And dream of the river of life
Where everything flows as one
Where you are what you were born to be
Interwoven in the web of life

Separation is only an illusion

We're all in this world together
This is our home
For who knows how long
Do something that counts
Before it's to late
And your time has come

Before it's too late
And your time has come

You hide who you are
In those corporate clothes
You put on, day after day

You hide who you are
In those corporate clothes
You hate, day after day

So close your eyes
And dream of the river of life
Where everything flows as one

We are high as the mountain
Deep as the ocean
We are burning like the sun
Cold as the winter

We are nature itself
