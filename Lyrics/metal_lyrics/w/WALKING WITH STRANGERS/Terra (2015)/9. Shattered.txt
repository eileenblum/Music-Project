A sickness lies over the world
It's blinding us leaving us speechless
The world is shattered, it's up to us to pick up the pieces

The poison of men
Who believe they stand taller than the rest
The poison of men
Is coursing through the veins of the earth

(The poison of men is coursing through the veins of the earth)

They will never understand
They will never silence our hope

They will never understand what it takes to be a man

A sickness lies over the world
It's blinding us leaving us speechless
The world is shattered, it's up to us to pick up the pieces

It's time to change everything about our existence

When all the rivers have run dry
When the sky is filled with guilt
When all the trees have died
You'll know what you've done wrong

But you are to late
Now live the rest of your life knowing this

You are the reason for it all
There's no going back

A sickness lies over the world
It's blinding us leaving us speechless
The world is shattered, it's up to us to pick up the pieces
