It's been getting harder to breathe
I never thought this would happen to us
Is it always gonna feel like this
You were everything

Your voice still echoes through these halls
Can't tell the difference
From whats real and whats not
I've never felt what I'm feeling now
It's killing me from the inside out

I need you in my life
Come back and set things right
I can't go on like this

When the night comes
I can't sleep
When the day breaks
I can't eat
When you're all that I can think of
I can't live

I can't sleep, like this
I can't sleep, like this

I can't live
When you're all that I can think of
When you're all that I can see

Every day and every night has been the same
Since the day you left this world

I'm not myself anymore
I'm not myself anymore

I'd do anything to see you again
Your voice still echoes through these halls
I'd give my life for yours, any day.
I'd do anything to see you again
Your voice still echoes through these halls
I will remember you everyday...
