The trees are black, and the smoke has not yet cleared
The air is heavy and it's getting harder to breathe
The trees are black, this land is dead and it will never be the same

Everything feels strange, it's like our world has crashed
(We are lost)
Spinning in the ashes of our past
It's like our world has crashed
(World has crashed)

The ground is shaking from the march of the machines
Turning beauty into death
I can hear the sound of our natures last breath

Cracks in the mountains
And dust in the air
We find poison in our water
That brings death and despair

Rebuild our home
Everything was taken away from us
Rebuild our home
Bring life back into the world we love

You never knew what you brought upon us
But when the truth was learned you changed nothing
Our world has crashed
We are lost
Spinning in the ashes of our past

Cracks in the mountains
And dust in the air
We find poison in our water
That brings death and despair

The ground is shaking from the march of the machines
Turning beauty into death
I can hear the sound of our natures last breath

The thing I hate the most is that they knew what was coming
But the greed in their eyes made them ignore their own lives
I could scream my fucking lungs out waiting for an answer
I could run for hours hoping to find a way back in time

But there is no going back

Rebuild our home
Everything was taken away from us
Rebuild our home
Bring life back into the world we love
