I have seen a lot, but not nearly all
Roots grow together and then they part

This is my way of saying goodbye

It will never reach you

Those lights became so bright,
Time slowing down with every
Heartbeat left

They say, there's another way
It will never reach you
My way of saying goodbye
I just can't reach you.
