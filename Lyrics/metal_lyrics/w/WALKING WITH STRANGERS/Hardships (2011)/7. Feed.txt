Feed your hungry eyes
On a different sight
Everyday of your life
Feel it in your chest

Breathe it in
Feel it in your chest

Breathe it out

When the sun sets
We'll look at the sky
Knowing that tomorrow
We'll live it all again

So let's focus on the things
Important to us

Because in the end
That's how we want it to be

And when it all comes crashing down
We'll keep our heads up high, saying

We've done it all
We'll keep our heads up high

Feed your hungry eyes
On a different sight

We've done it all.
