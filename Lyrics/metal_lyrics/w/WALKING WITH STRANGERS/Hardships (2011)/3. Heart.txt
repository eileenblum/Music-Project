The waves washed away what was left
She grabbed us by the neck, and told us to feel no pain
But with nothing left, your scars won't fade away
They're pictures burned into your brain

Now we only have ourselves
And our eyes have seen death
Will it, ever again, be the same

Save the young and cherish the old
Winter has come with a flood

Where's your heart when all you love is dead
Where's your heart, at the end of it all

With a calming voice in the pouring rain
She asked me, where's your heart
Where's your heart, at the end of it all.
