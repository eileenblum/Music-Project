Break it down into thousands of little pieces
Just to build it up again,

You are loved, still you break it down
And try again, never really opened up
Never really let someone in
So you don't know the feeling

We never share what we hide, after all

Waking up, flashing lights, passing by at night
It's never been so clear to me before
I can see the truth
Like a diamond amongst stones.

Everything is beautiful, but not everyone sees it,

For way to long, my eyes have been shut.
