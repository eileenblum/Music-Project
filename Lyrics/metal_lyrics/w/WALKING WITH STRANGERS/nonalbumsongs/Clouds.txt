Open your eyes
What do you see
A world you want to live in? [x2]

Blinded by purpose
We unwillingly wake up
Just to fill our days with meaning

Without knowing if we'll come home
Tonight. [x2]

So ignorant to the distant screams
Only money and power fits their dreams.

The eyes of the corrupt cannot be painted white. [x3]

We stare at the sky, dreaming of our escape
Of a better place. [x2]

A world left out in the cold
While they see their power unfold
In this life we put our comfort in those we love
And they'll never understand
(They will never understand)

Open your eyes
What do you see
A world you want to live in?

Blinded by purpose
We unwillingly wake up
Just to fill our days with meaning

MEANING

Just to fill our days with meaning.

We stare at the sky, dreaming of our escape
Of a better place.

We stare at the sky, dreaming of our escape

We stare at the sky, dreaming of our escape
Of a better place.

We stare at the sky, dreaming of better place.
