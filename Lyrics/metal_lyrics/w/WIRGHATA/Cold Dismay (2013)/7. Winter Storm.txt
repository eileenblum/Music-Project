Left to die in silent wold
Among the cold and wind
You are drowning in this void
Impaired by bleeding wound

Blood under your pale skin
Freezes in the swollen veins
Jaws clenched in crazy grin,
Limbs is bound by unseen chains

Step, and you fall into the snow
Blinded by an inner fear
Blizzard takes your restless soul
In the distant snowy realm

Through the mist she quietly stares
In your scared eyes
Her cold fingers touch your face
Death possessed you in this trice

[Chorus:]
Wounded by an icy shards
Forsaken and forlorn
Welcome to the open arms
Countess called a winter storm
