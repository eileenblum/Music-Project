Emptiness in my misty eyes
All that I see a human's lie
Step by step, I move to the light,
That shine in my memory, healing and bright
..I'm going to boundless spaces of (my) grief
..Carrying in soul seeds of belief
For many years, I fall and arise...
Under hollow and shameful skies

Wanderer, nomad in search of truth
I'm lost in the desert of my solitude
Long and worthless was my way
I need to rest for any pay

I went through a severe wind of loss
Hiding in bosom my last worth
The last piece of a bleeding heart
Tearing by longing to apart

Long time ago I didn't know pain
I slept in my cradle of coastal cane
In breathing of night and moonlight beams
I'm silently watching a fabulous dreams
..But now I'm blind, my time dies
..I cannot return to this distant paradise.
My deepest sorrow, my avenging knife
Let me go back on the doorstep of my life

Invisible wounds fester inside
The burden of my hopeless mind
Rivers of blood on my withered hands
I can not walk, I fall into (the) sand

My last hope will be denude
In the barren wasteland of my solitude
