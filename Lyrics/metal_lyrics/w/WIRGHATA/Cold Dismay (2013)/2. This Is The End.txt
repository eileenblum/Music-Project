You hate them. Rage is enveloping flesh and mind.
Youâre broken. The only salvation is death.
Only darkness always understands you.

Luring darkness, fear and a dead tranquilityâ¦
Go straight to the obscurity, deeperâ¦
Donât turn back â youâll see the lattice of your prison.
Go straight through rotten trees and dehydrated grass.

You are hearing the sounds in the silence.
Itâs your imagination. They are deadâ¦
Flinders of their lives is under your feet.
Go straight to the obscurity, deeperâ¦

Light is fading away. World is shrouded by mist.
Hopeâs disappearing. Endless thoughts â
Canât understand yourself anymore. Your body doesnât obey to you.
This is the endâ¦ Here is a place for you tooâ¦
