Empty eyes, devoid of life
Cold and shiny like steel knife
Their body is fog, in twilight sky
Born from echoes of your lifetime

Burning flame of ritual fire
Your inner self, your dark desire
Trough their kisses and muted breath
You certainly doomed to instant death

Incorporeal vision of your drug fears
Enslave you in this Devil's deal
Their slippery tongues lick your thoughts
Erupting venom from fetid throat

This deathly poison just for thee
From your madly fantasy
Bring the creatures of your hate
You are infected, Don't panic! Late!

They gather you, your fear inside
Under skin, in your mind
Silent shadows of your sin
Shut up! Torture was begin!
