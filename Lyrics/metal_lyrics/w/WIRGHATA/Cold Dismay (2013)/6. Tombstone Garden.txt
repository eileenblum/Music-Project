In the blinks of the shadows,
Under light of the Moon,
Your mad imagination draws
Garden in sinister gloom

You paint with ephemeral ink
This alley of your secret fears,
Graveyard of illusive hopes,
Space without envy and filth

Among the cries of crows
Invisible to the human eye
Is a garden of tombstones,
Another missing clime

Unlike the mankind's beauty
Park beyond the dream.
Projection of your crazy mind,
Hidden in phantasmal gleam

...Touch the elder ground,
Feel the whisper of ages,
Open a misty veil,
Enter the realm of Hades...

[Chorus:]
...Crow instead of songbirds
...Graves instead of lawn
...Bones instead of flowers
...Fear instead of calm...
