When the darkness covers world
That painted by deaf pain
In a solitary vault
I'm bounded like insane
It's my torment, every night
I lose my jaded mind
In empty room devoid of life,
Filled with treacherous sounds

Last seeds of mind
Fall in the night
In this sickening place
Under dusk's wings
Every gride bring
My own madness

It's my cage, I can't escape
I just hear the creak of locks
Silent thing in human shape
I'm here, lost among the walls
My thin skin and withered face
Gnaw the foul rats
I'm alive, but it's still worse,
I cannot change my path...

Upon the walls
Shadows and ghosts,
Dancing mad waltz
Dead in gray shroud
Reflect in your eyes
From this fear rise...

Torment and woe
All that I saw
Inside my blackened soul
Throe in my veins,
Heart full of pain
Sear me day by day

Something chokes me, it is here
I feel his muffled breath
In the depths of this dark hell
I hear my ego's wept
Human nature leaves me now,
And plagued my hollow soul
In empty room devoid of life
I turn into heartless ghoul
