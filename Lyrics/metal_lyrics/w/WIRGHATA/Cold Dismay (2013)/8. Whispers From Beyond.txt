The ineffable horror lives
Inside my ailing head

Under the uncanny light
Of the starry twilight sky
I hear awful whispers
From universal tide

They call me into unknown gulf
Beyond wasted time

Try to close your reckless eyes,
Open your innermost thoughts
They are promptly penetrate
In the depths of your remorse

Mystery voices from distant stars,
Screams of celestial pain

My place is among them
In a frozen nebula's lace
I hear the mournful groan
By a wanderers out of space

Outside of human presence
I was destined to lose my shape

Try to close your reckless eyes,
Open your innermost thoughts
They are promptly penetrate
In the depths of your remorse
