We stand at the edge, just behind the shadows.
Ahead of the eclipse, with darkness and void.
All the keys of paradise flew into the abyss.
Dark Demon of Hell once again came down to us.

The black sky, the voices in your head.
You have paid for their sins.
Domination came to an end on this land.
No one will hear your plaintive screams.

Lava swallowed the Earth
And your fetid soul.
Only the ash is smoking.
This poor world is destroyed.

Shed blood spread out along the rivers.
Everything has plunged into eternal rest.
The sounds have merged in unison.
Wake up. The dream is over.
