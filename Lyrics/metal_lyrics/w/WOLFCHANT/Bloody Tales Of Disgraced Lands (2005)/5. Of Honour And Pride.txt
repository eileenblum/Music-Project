[Chorus:]
We drink mead and beer and wine
Of everything the best and all is fine
We sing today from honour and pride
All friends and brothers are by our side

A story of a battle we will tell you now
A battle we had won Â my friends - shout it out loud
We march again when the morning come
With courage in our hearts and the opponents will run

Saddle our horses we will ride into war Â together we fight and we die
Tomorrow will come and will bring a new day and Odin is by our side
We will bring the glory back in this land Â we will bring you the peace
