[I.]
Oh my god Â i can't believe Â whats happen now with me
Oh my god Â what should i do Â my son is dead Â the only one
I feel so much Â pain in me Â my heart is cold Â like ice
Uziels look Â is full of fear Â everywhere is blood - to see
Oh my god Â is this the time Â i will attack Â rigth now

[Chorus:]
And I will now attack
Blood for Blood Â it's my revenge
Feel my pain feel my sword
Blood for Blood Â for my son's life
And I will now attack
Blood for Blood Â it's my revenge
Feel the rage in my heart
You die for my son

[II.]
Oh my god Â Uziel can't believe Â whats happen now with him
Oh my god Â he has no chance Â our swords will hit Â his mans
He was not calm Â he is surprised Â against our attack
Uziels look Â is full of fear Â everywhere is blood - to see
Oh my god Â his soldiers run Â hundrets are dead Â we won

[Bridge:]
Wind and storm are by my side Â The troops of Odin won
Our wilderness is like an animal Â the false king has to run
Feel my coldness Â feel my sword
We still alive - and we still strike
Feel my agony Â my pain
Look in my eyes Â you have to die
