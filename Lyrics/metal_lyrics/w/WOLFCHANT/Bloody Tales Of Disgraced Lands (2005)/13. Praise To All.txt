[Chorus:]
Today is the one day, the land now is free
We have back our homes and new hope we can see.
To Odin we pray to have freedom again
In trust of him we live and all enemies are bend

[I.]
My dear friends our Mission is done
The Land is free and the enemy is beat
My brother and sisters Â Now I have to go
Before us is a new future Â use it carefully

My dear friend this is the end of my way
The time is coming goodbye I have to say
My soldiers and friend which fought by my side
The gods will bless you and to Walhalla I ride

We want to celebrate up to the morning
We want to drink up to the next day
We want to celebrate up to the morning
We want to drink as if there are none tomorrow

[Chorus:]

[II.]
To all the gods our Mission is finished now
The Land will grow up strive for new power
To my son which is waiting in Walhalla
After the next morning red we are united again

To all of you, to all which died in this war
Lifts the glasses and drink out the beer
A new morning is coming our fate is certain
Stay strong together, we meet us again

We want to celebrate up to the morning
We want to drink up to the next day
We want to celebrate up to the morning
We want to drink as if there are none tomorrow

[Bridge:]
Wind and fire bring me up to Odin's mighty hall
The rainbow bridge I have to pass now
The Falcon fly in front of me and I will follow him
I will watch over you all
