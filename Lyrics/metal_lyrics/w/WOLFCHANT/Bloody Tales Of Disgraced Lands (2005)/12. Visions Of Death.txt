Aahr my son today your mission now ends
The Land and the people are free and the victory is ours
The christian enemy is banned and destructed from
This holy place
The old gods come back in there mighty halls

Now take place beside me and your son
It is time to fulfil your promise to me
Cross the rainbow bridge as one of my warriors
Your last task is to celebrate with your friends and family
And than come in my arms Â my son!!!!

Oh Godfather I will come to Walhalla
My fate is already certain and I clutched my sword
From now on I will fight on your side
Free like the wind and the eagles in the sky!
