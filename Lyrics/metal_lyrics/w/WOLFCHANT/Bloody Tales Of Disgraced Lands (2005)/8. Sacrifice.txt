[I.]
Now I sit here in chains - helplessly and alone
Betrayed from the best friend Â used as a pledge
Uziel prepares its men Â to ride against my father
Oh Odin, I failed and we going to loose

Hopefully the soldiers I sent
Reached my father in time
So that they can warn him
To the carren field we will ride
My fate is decided Â i have to die
My fate is decided Â i die

[Chorus:]

Falcons fly high in the sky
Once time still so free like them
Im here so small and alone
Oh father Â i will brake out Â will brake out

[Bridge:]

Uziel you damned
I will prevent your plan
You will be surprised
Our land will never be yours

Now we meet us
In the carren fields
I sit on my horse
Guarded the last time
(Ready to die)

[II.]

Odin Â father give me the power
To fight the last time for my land
Into a lance I will fall to kill myself
Everywhere is blood I see the falcons fly
Blackness surrounds me and I feel so cold
My heart stop pounding the last story is told
Every breath is a pain, I close my eyes
I begin to fly and the falcons cry
