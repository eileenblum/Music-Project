The next important battle we had won
But to many of the clan could flee
Uziel is back in his headquarter
He will call his soldiers to defend us
I can't mourn for my dead son
And now we should fight again
This time is to less for me
But I demand the revenge
I will send some messengers
To the towns Ashwood and Ruhn
They have to tell our allies
That we meet us in 7 days

[Chorus:]
Strong we stand together
We know the next days are crucial
Nobody knows what the morning will bring
Or if he is still alive
This is our Revenge
We have to go our way
This is our destiny
The darkest time in our life

I hope the messengers will arrive soon
I don't have enough soldiers and men
We need more swords and spears
To have a chance to win
Now today it is time for us
Our hard journey will start today
I can see the fear in the faces
Of my friends my soldiers my heart

[Bridge:]
Death and pain will pave my way
Blood and flesh on broken bones
Agony and mourn are in my heart
This is the only reason why I have to fight

[Chorus:]
Strong we stand together
We know the next days are crucial
Nobody knows what the morning will bring
Or if he is still alive
This is our Revenge
We have to go our way
This is our destiny
The darkest time in our life
