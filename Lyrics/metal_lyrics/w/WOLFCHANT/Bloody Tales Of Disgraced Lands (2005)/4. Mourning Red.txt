[I.]
Finally the time came
In that our revenge is taken
All are coming on this day
More than 1000 swords and spears

We will use the shade of the night
To implement the first attack
We will get them when they sleep
None may survive or escape

Have no fear oh my befriends
I will march ahead at the front
We get which to us belonged
To live in peace, in piece again

And in such a way we reached
The castle of the enemy
In such a silence they do sleep
And now we let the fire burn

These flames will our country clean
With sword and shield we are storming
In the morning red you die
A mournful day for you all

[Chorus:]
Burning arrows fly by air
We march against the enemy
The air it burns and iron meets on flesh
Our opponents can not resist
Our attack is a full success
We got them in the sleep
We fight for our liberty
Independent again

[II.]
Now the gates broke through
We are storm the inner court
The against resistance
Of the enemy is weak

We will take no one
No one as a prisoner
The base is taken nearly
The clan and its fellows flee

The sun comes up slowly
The new day bring back us our land
The land we lived so long time
The land we are want to dieing for

Smoke rises on to the clouds
Hundred's dead bodies lay
Laying down on the ground
The liberty demands its victims

A general is in our hands
He will tell us of their plans
The torture will bring him to speak
And the victory be ours

[Chorus:]
Burning arrows fly by air
We march against the enemy
The air it burns and iron meets on flesh
Our opponents cannot resist
Our attack is a full success
We got them in the sleep
We fight for our liberty
Independent be again
