[Chorus:]
A Betrayal among us - it comes quietly in the night
Iike an illness in my self Â wand's to destroy our plans
And the Clan knows us now Â careful we must be
My best friend is the traitor - i can't that believe

[I.]
After so many days
With my friends here in Ruhn
Everything is planned now
Meet us again in this night

I see hope in the eyes
In the eyes of my friends
They are not longer alone
Now it is worth to die itself

I will appoint Illnar now
To the new general
He is to state the Rebellion
The Rebellion in Ruhn

But where is my friend - I cannot find him
I fear the worst things

[II.]
The doors of our hitting place fly up
Soldiers of the clan storm into the room
It comes to the fight Â many of us die
A dark shape enters the area

Illnar the traitor Â the traitor of our land
Ragnar gets in prison - it is to be used as pledge
The father is to be forced - to lay down the weapons
