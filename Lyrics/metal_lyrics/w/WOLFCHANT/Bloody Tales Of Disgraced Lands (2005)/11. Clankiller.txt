[Chorus:]
Wind and Storm will follow
Us in this glory night
The clan will fall today
The Victory of gods
Wind and Storm will follow
Us in this glory night
And nobody can stop us
Glory of the gods

[I.]
The night began and full moon is to see
The wind he blows us in this fight
Our flags we holding in the hands
The coat of arms is liberty

The Ashwood soldiers already are there
I can see thousands burning torches
It has begun to raining and to thunders
Lightning's are to be seen in the sky

King Uziel and the Clan of Cross
Withdrew themselves behind the city wall
But these will not be able to withstand us
Because we built up this walls sometime

Yes, now the instant finally is came
Our fate will fulfil itself on this day
I can smell the fear of our enemies
But nobody can save them - no more

I stretch my hand into the air
And keep firmly clasped my sword
Now I instruct the attack on the city
And a powerful storm begins to blow

[II.]
The night in gales and full moon is to see
The storm he carries us in this night
Our flags we holding in the hands
The coat of arms is liberty

Thousands of stones fly against the walls
Against the mighty walls of Ruhn town
Arrows and Spears hit the enemies
I can smell blood and fear

The horses trample with the hooves
Everywhere you can hear the cries of death
But we do not know pity today
Because this will be our last battle

The combat capability of the clan is destroyed
They cannot resistance us any longer
But we do not let any of them flee
Today they will die by our hands

Some of our mans catched Illnar the traitor
The traitor of my son and the land
I instruct to burn him before the city
And he should not get a sword

[Bridge:]
I run to the middle of the city
To the old fields now Uziels palace
There our soldiers had catched him
Now we will fight man against man

Uziel prays for his life
I strike with my fist in his bloody face
And instructs him to stand up
Now fights for your ridiculous life

The swords meet each other
My rage increase continues
My blade meets the opponent heart
He makes his last breaths Â over and out!

We won the land is free - we won victory !!!
Brother and sister we are free Â we won victory
Odin's heathen army won - we are the clan killer

The night in Blood and full moon is to see
The fire of liberty carries us in this night
The old fields flag we holding in the hands
The coat of arms now is victory
