The years they past and one day follow the next,
We live withdrawn in the forests 10 years now passed
Since we were attacked and had to flee into the mountains
So I cannot live on, like an animal on the escape
And my son I must convince, we must fight this time
Equivalent this evening I will tell him of my plans
Because he spoke ever more to go into war
He was inspired of my suggestion.

[Chorus:]
I am war Â can you see
I am your force Â look at me
I am the fear in our enemies' eyes
I am the Thunderhawk who never dies

[Bridge:]
Also the soldiers were inspired of this plan
We want to rather die than our country to lose
We must go to Ashwood, here the clan is weakest
We must convince the inhabitants to fight; we are stronger than ever before
The people must know that a member of the elders is still alive
On a hidden place in the forest we want to met.
Here I will speak to all, the falcon on my arm.
I am blessed by Odin and I will show you the way

II.
Now the night had broken in, 1000 men had met
Oh Odin be by my side, they all must follow me
And Odin appeared Aahr in shape of a falcon
For the years in which you were faithful to me, I will now recompense you
I feel it your power is in me, we will be victorious
Befriends the time is come to stop our pain
Again we all should take the weapons
I be blessed by Odin and I will show you the way

[Chorus:]
I am war Â can you see
I am your force Â look at me
I am the fear in our enemies' eyes
I am the thunderer who never dies
