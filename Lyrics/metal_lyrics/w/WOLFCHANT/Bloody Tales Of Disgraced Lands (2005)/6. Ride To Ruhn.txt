[I.]
The morning red Is to be seen behind the mountains high
This is called that blood will spilled and some men have to die
Our fate already certain and I'm the chosen one
Now it's in my hand - prepare everything for war

I must ride to Ruhn to meet with Illnar my old friend
He have to help me organize - the Recondition fight
We must educate new troops for the last attack
Nobody see or recognize us here in Ruhn town

[Bridge:]
We are riding fast Â faster than the wind
Our will is strong - We are not afraid
Not afraid to die - Odins horde arise
See the power - in - my - eyes

Now finally we arrived Â Illnahr is by my side
To the other ones we will go Â will tell of our victory

[Chorus:]
Now the time is came and the old fields will awake
We're united now and so much time has past the lands
In the heart of the clan we hid ourselves these days
And soon we will give you the mortal blow

Now the time is came and the old fields will awake
We're united now and so much time has past the lands
All together we will strike in 3 month we are free
We send our prays to odin

Ride to Ruhn for victory
We will arise the clan must flee
Ride to Ruhn with power and steel
We are here to fight and kill

[II.]
Illnar told me of his planes to bring the clan to fall
I met some of my old friend they are ready too
More thousands of our old soldiers swear me loyalty
I tell them of my father and that he's on the way to Ahrren

Another 1000 of our soldiers come from the Ashwood town
In 3 months in the night we have to finish everything
Than we will meet us with all our soldiers here in Ruhn
The same strike like in Ashwood we will come in the night
Now you all know of our planes Illnar is not by my side

[Bridge:]
We are riding fast Â faster than the wind
Our will is strong - We are not afraid
Not afraid to die - Odins horde arise
See the power - in - my - eyes

Now finally we arrived Â Illnahr is by my side
To the other ones we will go Â will tell of our victory

[Chorus:]
Now the time is came and the old fields will awake
We're united now and so much time has past the lands
In the heart of the clan we hid ourselves these days
And soon we will give you the mortal blow

Now the time is came and the old fields will awake
We're united now and so much time has past the lands
All together we will strike in 3 month we are free
We send our praise to Odin

Ride to Ruhn for victory
We will arise the clan must flee
Ride to Ruhn with power and steel
We are here to fight and kill
