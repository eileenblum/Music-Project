Poenam no sentio mortis, poena fuit vita, requies mihi morte parata est

Darker moon and darker night, 
Far away from every light
Iron claws are holding me, 
The death in flames is mine

I am sitting here alone, tortured and prisoned in my cell
I am sitting here alone, tortured and prisoned in my cell
Chains binding my hands and feets, I feel I am in hell
Chains binding my hands and feets, I feel I am in hell

I did never something wrong
Everyday I prayed to God

Darker moon and darker night, 
Far away from every light
Iron claws are holding me, 
The death in flames is mine

Live is dark and savage now, they blamed me as a witch
Live is dark and savage now, they blamed me as a witch
Years and years I healed the people, with the help of nature's power
Years and years I healed the people, with the help of nature's power

I did never something wrong
Everyday I prayed to God

I remember when I was young and the fields and the trees surrounding me
As a maid on a farm there was nothing bad and evil for me
All the terrible thing they said, my skin was burnt with fire
My life is turning into red, the inquisitions desire

I remember when I was young and the fields and the trees surrounding me
As a maid on a farm there was nothing bad and evil for me
All the terrible thing they said, my skin was burnt with fire
My life is turning into red, the inquisitions desire

I have to got to the pyre now, all my bones are broken
They spite on me - No help no angels here - I cannot flee
I am confined to a pile - tears of pain running from my eyes
The flames devour me, my fate is black

My fate is black
My fate is black

Darker moon and darker night, 
Far away from every light
Iron claws are holding me, 
The death in flames is mine

Darker moon and darker night, 
Far away from every light
Iron claws are holding me, 
The death in flames is mine
