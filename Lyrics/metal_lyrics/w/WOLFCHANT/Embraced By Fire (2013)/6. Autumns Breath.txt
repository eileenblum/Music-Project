The sun is getting colder in these days 
The light devoured by the night 
And the leaves turning into brown. 
The folk surrounds the land

Deep in my heart, a wolf will break out
Can't keep this beast inside of me
Gathering these moments in a spell 
And bring its wisdom to me

It is the wind in the night, bring the voices in my mind, 
In the forest I'm wandering my way. 
It is the cold and pure ice, melancholy in my heart
Deep in this forest I feel the autumns breath

Pale are the trees, in the silence a lonely cry
All the faces blurred in the loneliness of tides
Whispering voices come through the thicket
Feel this wisdom inside of me

Deep in my heart, a wolf will break out
Can't keep this beast inside of me
Gathering these moments in a spell
And bring it's wisdom to me

It is the wind in the night, bring the voices in my mind, 
In the forest I'm wandering my way. 
It is the cold and pure ice, melancholy in my heart
Deep in this forest I feel the autumns breath

I will never leave my path
I will never change my mind
I will never walk alone on my way
I will never stop to fight
I will decide what is right and what is wrong
There are many walking on my way

It is the wind in the night, bring the voices in my mind
In the forest I'm wandering my way
It is the cold and pure ice, melancholy in my heart
Deep in this forest I feel the autumns breath

It is the wind in the night, bring the voices in my mind
In the forest I'm wandering my way
It is the cold and pure ice, melancholy in my heart
Deep in this forest I feel the autumns breath
