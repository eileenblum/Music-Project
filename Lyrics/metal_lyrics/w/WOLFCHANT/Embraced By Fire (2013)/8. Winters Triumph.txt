I am the king of ice
I am the bringer of light
The emperor of coldness
With hands of thunder and storm
I am the king of death
Covering your land in white

Grey one is coming, beside the storm
Grey one is coming, blood is spilled
Grey one is coming, beside the storm
Grey one is coming, RagnÃ¤rok has arrived

Snow and ice I bring to earth
My kingdom of coldness
Blood of gods is spilled 
And thunder is rolling in the night

Snow and ice I bring to earth
My kingdom of coldness
Blood of gods is spilled 
And thunder is rolling - Fimbul winter has arrived

I am the king of night
I am the bringer of ice
I am the ruler of worlds, 
With hands of frost and snow
All hope is gone, 
Dark clouds are touching the sky
No stars to see, the serpents poison is spilled

Snow and ice I bring to earth
My kingdom of coldness
Blood of gods is spilled 
And thunder is rolling in the night

Snow and ice I bring to earth
My kingdom of coldness
Blood of gods is spilled 
And thunder is rolling - Fimbul winter has arrived

Now its my time, my triumphal march
Now its my time, before my eyes
Now its my time, my triumphal march
All life covered under a winter mantle

With hands of frost and snow
All hope is gone
Dark clouds are touching the sky
No stars to see, the serpents poison is spilled

Snow and ice I bring to earth
My kingdom of coldness
Blood of gods is spilled 
And thunder is rolling in the night

Snow and ice I bring to earth
My kingdom of coldness
Blood of gods is spilled 
And thunder is rolling - Fimbul winter has arrived

Snow and ice I bring to earth
My kingdom of coldness
Blood of gods is spilled 
And thunder is rolling in the night

Snow and ice I bring to earth
My kingdom of coldness
Blood of gods is spilled 
And thunder is rolling - Fimbul winter has arrived
