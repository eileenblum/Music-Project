Blackened thunder is rolling
Burning lights and storm wind are taking the sky
Our world is a moment
Appearing in the unendless chaos of time

Powerful forces are striking this time
Our destiny now is written tonight
Humanity last breath a carnal desire
World is in ashes and embraced by fire

Our mind is so confined
Our hate is cruel and brutal,
No wisdom could ever teach us
We lived for us
Years and years passed by
No insight and no remorse
We fought our wars
Fought for god
For our weak believes

Is this our way
Walking on a dead end road
Is this our fate
World is falling down
Is this our road
Standing on the edge
Is this our believe
Held by the strong hand

Our deeds they are wrong
Just thinking of us, no compassion for the others
We are dust
Just a moment
But world is turning on
Summer turns into winter
And Dark turns to Light
No one thinks that we are more than an instant of time

Is this our way
Walking on a dead end road
Is this our fate
World is falling down
Is this our road
Standing on the edge
Is this our believe
Held by the strong hand

Embraced by fire a pure burning light
The end of desire, the end of all fights
Return to the origin, return to the white
World is embraced by fire devoured by light
