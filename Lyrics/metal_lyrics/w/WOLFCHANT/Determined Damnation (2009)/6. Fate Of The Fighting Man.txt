Leaving my home
Across the lands
over mountains
To a nameless place

Now I have, I have to go
To foreign land to feed my family
Now I have, I have to go
And I don't know if I will ever return to you

Leaving all I love
Not for gold
Or glory
For aliment

Now I take my sword, my shield
I will be prepared for this fight and I am not afraid
Now I take my axe, my spear
I will be prepared for this fight and I will live, not die

Hold my hand because my heart is full of pain
Look in my eyes - am I a warrior or just a man?

[Chorus:]
This is the fate - of the fighting men
To live or to die - only for honour
This is the curse - of the brave men
To be one of many thousands

We reached that land
Of gold and weed
Of water and meat
We have to win

Now I have, I have to fight
At this place to feed my family
Now I have, I have to be strong
And I don't know if I will ever return to you

The weapons strike
Arrows all around
Reaper's scythe
I am falling

Now they broke my sword, my shield
I thought I was prepared for this fight but I failed
Now they took my axe, my spear
I thought I was prepared for this fight and now I have to die

No one holds my hand and my hart is full of pain
Look in my eyes - I am not warrior, I am a man

[Chorus]
