[Chorus:]
We will fight and stand, wild like wolves and 'til the end
We are proud and we are free for our gods and victory

Again the enemies are passing our old fields
They came to plunder and to rape
They are coming to bring their belief
To our houses with fire, with death and with fear

Again we will rise, for our land, our families, our blood
Tonight we will fight, for freedom and for peace
With torture and pain they will break you
But we are strong and wild
We are fighting for our right
The right to live and to be free

[Chorus]

Stand strong, stand proud, stand free, be loud
Stand strong, for your right, stand proud and shout
Stand strong, stand proud, stand free, be loud
Stand strong, for your right, stand proud and shout

We are strong and we are proud,
We are free and we are loud
Nobody will stop us, this is our gods will
This is our gods will

Legendary tales we bring
Of warriors of might we sing
Long forgotten tales we bring
Of wolves of might we sing

Hard we fought day and night
bones and iron we broke
Swords of ire and with iron will
the thunder of gods we brought

Hard we fought day and night
bones and iron we broke
Swords of ire and with iron will
the thunder of gods we brought

[Chorus]
