The time will come and dark clouds fill the sky
sun is sinking down for the last time
A skin of ice is covering earth, eternal night is born
We have taken what we could, and we gave nothing

[Chorus:]
Mankinds arrogance and mankinds vain is changing into fear,
into chaos and into hatred and from hatred into pain
Nature's revenge, and old ancient power cold winds are blowing and dark clouds fill the sky
Frost and full moons empire of coldness and thousands of glaciers so mighty and high
Nature's revenge, and old ancient power cold winds are blowing and dark clouds fill the sky

What shall we do, this is the end!
We saw the signs but we ignored them!
What shall we do, why are we so weak?
There is no return, we will lose it all!

Kingdom of coldness, kingdom of darkness
Stormy winds and ice rule our earth
Kingdom of pureness, kingdom of nature
A perfect creation, a birth of a new world

Time is there and cutting winds fill the sky
The crimson moon is shining and revealing the old paths
A skin of ice is covering the earth, eternal night is born - this is the birth of a new world

[Chorus]
