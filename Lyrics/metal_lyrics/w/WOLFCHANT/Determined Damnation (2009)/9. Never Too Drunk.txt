[Chorus:]
Now we are here, so let rain the beer
We are ready for a drink
Give us the wine, more of the mead
Because we are never to drunk

Another gathering with all of our friends
Again it's time to celebrate
All the campfires burn in this summer night
Let the old fields sing their old songs
No beast is without us
We replace blood with beer
Drink it out, we have no fear!

Drink, drink it all - drink it all!

Bring me all the bottles
Bring me all the beer
Bring me all the bottles
Bring me all the wine

This is the night we celebrate
All sorrows are forgotten now
This is the night we celebrate
All our friends are here

This is the night we celebrate
All sorrows are forgotten now
This is the night we celebrate
Just feel the magic of this moment

[Chorus]

See all the people - they're all happy
They're all dancing - listen to Metal
See all the stars - they're all shining
They're all glowing - a new day is coming

[Chorus]
