In the misty darkness of my dreams I wander through the fields
The fields of blood and agony where so many had to yield
I see the scares of death and leave the truthless lying there
The embers of the wretched ones discovered what we wield

Through all the ages
Through all the struggle for life
Against bondage, oppression for freedom and hope
With our hopeless ideal to survive

This is a tribute to all the heathens who died
Tortured, enslaved and burnt to death by the servants of religious lies
Religious lies
Religious lies

I hear their moaning in my head the pain and misery
Betrayed and slaughtered â they were damned to this place without relief
And all the slain they look at me with widely opened eyes
Their faces are distorted masks concealed in silent cries

Do not believe
Do not obey to their priests
Who want to control you
And spit on your roots to justify their bloody deeds

This is a tribute to all the heathens who died
Tortured, enslaved and burnt to death by the servants of religious lies

May their spirits rise again to enlighten me
And to bring back the lores which got lost in dark centuries
May their ghosts rise again just to frighten those
Who dare to convert innocence by force
Innocence by force
Innocence by force
Innocence by force
Innocence by force

And their spirits shall rise
Again to haunt them to take revenge
To haunt them to take revenge

Cleanse the world
And then rebuild the mighty heathen throne
Cleanse the world
And then rebuild the mighty heathen throne
Let sorrowful righteous people live for freedom and for peace
The heathens fight for freedom not for greed

Cleanse the world
And then rebuild the mighty heathen throne
Cleanse the world
And then rebuild the mighty heathen throne
Let sorrowful righteous people live for freedom and for peace
The heathens fight for freedom not for greed

May their spirits rise again to enlighten me
And to bring back the lores got lost in dark centuries
May their ghosts rise again just to frighten those
Who dare to convert innocence by force

Do not believe
Do not obey to their priests
Who want to control you and spit on your roots to justify their bloody deeds

This is a tribute to all the heathens who died
Tortured, enslaved and burnt to death by the servants of religious lies
Religious lies
Religious lies
