Now death will come
come with a storm
black clouds guiding
guiding its way
Ice is melting
the sea is passing away
Sunbeams like spears

Sunbeams like spears
are burning the skin
black blood of earth
pollutes the water
Humanity is reaching the abyss
but the can't see what I see

Black winds calling me
hear their dark voices of fear
Whipping up the waves
delete lands from humanity

Black winds calling your name
Uts force never to tame
Mountains of fire
spiting there hate to the ground
Black winds blow
over the lands
and only dust
is in you hands

Sunbeams like spears
are burning the skin
black blood of earth
pollutes the water
Humanity is reaching the abyss
but the can't see what I see

Black winds calling me
hear their dark voices of fear
Whipping up the waves
delete lands from humanity

This is the time
all universal forces strike
a great unique silence
will embrace the last light
The eye which can not see
the tongue which can not talk
No ear can hear a whisper
no feeling anymore
Reduced to the last whole
RagnarÃ¶ks end

This is the time
all universal forces strike
a great unique silence
will embrace the last light
The eye which can not see
the tongue which can not talk
No ear can hear a whisper
no feeling anymore
Reduced to the last whole
RagnarÃ¶ks end

We are just a breeze
in the Aeon of time
A cruel acrimony
in the infinity
Everlasting thoughts
the question of being
Like shadows in the mind
prevent seeing

Now death will come
come with a storm
black clouds guiding
guiding its way
Ice is melting
the sea is passing away
Sunbeams like spears

Sunbeams like spears
are burning the skin
black blood of earth
pollutes the water
Humanity is reaching the abyss
but the can't see what I see

Black winds calling me
hear their dark voices of fear
Whipping up the waves
delete lands from humanity
