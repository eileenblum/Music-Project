I walk through the veil of time
thousands of years have passed by
My journey is not over yet
I can see the heroes of past days
Long forgotten traditions
destroyed by the changing times
Despised by Christian preachers
The legacy of my forefathers
Lying on the ground

Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone
Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone

We live again
Ressurrected from the pyre
Never will fall
We are still burning

Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone
Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone

Now the winds of
fortune are coming
the old powerful flames
are burning
An age old believe
is risen again
ressurrected from the ashes
of pyre

We live again
Ressurrected from the pyre
Never will fall
We are still burning

Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone
Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone

Where is your god
can you see he failed
Where is your god
nailed to the cross
Where is your god
abandoned from all
Where is your god
why your are afraid
to see the truth
give the burning flame on
let fall the ash

Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone
Rise and rise we never will fall
fight and fight we against all
On and on we never alone
a calm before storm
but now we are gone

Now the winds of
fortune are coming
the old powerful flames
are burning
An age old believe
is risen again
ressurrected from the ashes
of pyre
