The years go by and
time is running like a river flows
never to stop
the leaves are
falling down these days
and I remember what I've lost
As I said goodbye to you
Can't know it was
the last farewell
so much to say
so much to tell
It was the last farewell...

Asking you how, asking you why
when I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
your way to the stars
And I never will
forget who you are

Asking you how, asking you why
when I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
your way to the stars
And I never will
forget who you are

I was devastated as I heard
you gone away
Saw in your white cold face
no more time to stay
You told me how to live
you showed me how to fight

I always look up to you
I always be with you
I always look up to you

Asking you how, asking you why
when I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
your way to the stars
And I never will
forget who you are

Asking you how, asking you why
when I am looking to the sky
You gone in advance
your way to the stars
And I never will
forget who you are
