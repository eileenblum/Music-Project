I'm standing on top of a mountain my face against the wind.
My fingers are touching stones millions of years they are old.
The spirit of this old place increases the power in me.
Nature is the real god the reason for our existence.

As long as my heart will pound
and as long I can breath.
As long as I stand like a man
I will never forgive.

That's the way I have to go
my chosen path.
With pride and honour I fight
for the glory of my gods.
My conviction, my destiny
I have the heart of a wolf
please bring me back home again

I'm standing in a valley
my heart touched by the wind.
The aura of trees in my nose
the same like thousand years before.
The magic of this moment
unique an incomparable.
Nature is the real god
and the reason for our life.

As long as my heart will pound
and as long I can breath.
As long as I stand like a man
I will never forgive.
As long as I'm a warrior
and as long I can fight.
As long as I'm wild like a wolf
nobody will tame me.

A raging beast is unleashed
and sharp are its fangs.
It is coming to you
take care and prepare.

That's the way I have to go
my chosen path.
With pride and honour I fight
for the glory of my gods.
My conviction, my destiny
I have the heart of a wolf
please bring me back home again
