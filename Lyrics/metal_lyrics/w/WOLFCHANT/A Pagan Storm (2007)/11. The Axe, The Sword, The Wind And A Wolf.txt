The Norns warned Odin
To be careful
'cause a demoniac wolf
will bring a new age
The age of the axe,
The sword the wind, the wolf
This is the beginning of the end

The end of all time is near
The grey one is watching you
Hati and Skalli you will fear
Devour the sun and the moon
A wolf will bring you dead
Fight, leave the golden halls
And no mercy will get
Nobody takes pity on you

The age of the wolf
Has begun that night
We gather all warriors
A times for the brave ones
The bound one freed himself
He came to new power
Vidar you must tear
The Beast into two parts

So the gods decided to bind Fenris for all time
They took him away from his mother
And brought him to Asgard
No success to tame him his rage is to wild
Only Tyr is brave enough to feed his hungry fangs

The age of the wolf has begun in this night
We gather all warriors a time for the brave one
The bound one freed himself he came to new power
Vidar you must tear the Beast into two parts

But all these deeds
Of the gods are senseless
Because a wolf will
Never change his mind
They tried to bind him
With LÃ¤ding and Droma
But Fenrir teared the
Ropes into pieces

At least the dwarfs made mighty ties
Gleipnir now is holding the wolfs legs
And Tyr gave his hand as a pledge
The wolf is waiting for RagnarÃ¶k

The end of all time is near
The grey one is watching you
Hati and Skalli you will fear
Devour the sun and the moon
A wolf will bring you dead
Fight, leave the golden halls
And no mercy will get
Nobody takes pity on you
