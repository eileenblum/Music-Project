In a warm and mild summer night
The light of the moon is glaring
Friends and brothers are by my side
And we are sitting around a fire

The flames are dancing for us
We are dancing in this night
The Flames are shining for us
We are brighter than the light

We all hold our hands into the wind
Free like the eagles tonight
All sorrows are forgotten
We drink and sing in our gathering

We all hold our swords into sky
Free like the wolves tonight
The guitars are playing
We drink and sing in our gathering

The wind is touching my face
We fill the horns with beer and mead
A perfect night to celebrate
And the best meat I will get

Many litres of beer and mead are in me
I'm trumbling through the fresh grass
A girl will follow fast my path
Oh night please never end!

We all hold our hands into the wind
Free like the eagles tonight
All sorrows are forgotten
We drink and sing in our gathering
