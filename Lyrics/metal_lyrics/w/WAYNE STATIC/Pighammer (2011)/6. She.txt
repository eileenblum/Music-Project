We are all glass
And our friends electric
This is our Dark Nation
This is my secret weapon
And you know when it's driving
Could I feel more alive?
Always thriving
And she is everything you see

She
Dirty Dreamer
She
Instigator
She

Are you anywhere?
Aries
Yeah
It's the game
Yeah
All the same
She make the world come alive

I'm not scared
Always be prepared
Living life like a scarecrow
There's no time for sleep
And I'm not scarred
Though peeling away
Peeling away all the layers
This is the real me
This is the real me
