It's hard to resist the feeling that
All these choices in our lives
That everything is superficial

Show of strength with a hit
It's a promise
Carefully plan this re-emergence
Shadow play lost control
Crystal daze blackened shores
Killing soon I will tear it apart
With a hint of silver
Ramming down the throat of the river
Far away interzone
Images all our own
Rising moon wears a thorn made of crowns

Get higher with the shifter
Get it out
Give it up
Don't resist her
Mechanism drive the superhuman motor
Electrified
A super killer

Shadow play
Carefully planning
Show of strength
Tear it apart
Killing soon
Breaking the damning
Feeling you breaking apart

Implore dark things
We've lost control
Icing the world
Suck up the fuel
