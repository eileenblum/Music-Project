Steal and cheat
Violate
Critical subliminal
Terminate eliminate
Coveting the vertigo
Take it in
A vision
Stitch it up
Incision
Keep on doing it right
Right straight on

Fight the Chrome Nation
Violent position
Treat the limitation
Go

Hold tight
Keep it low
Critical subliminal
Terminate eliminate
Cheat fate, too late

All the great minds have an unseen plan
That will be revealed at the end
Dismantle, cut what you don't like

Hold tight
Turn it on
Form a line
Gift of the sun

Chrome charged clicker
Dreamer flicker
Come home quicker
Take her liquor
