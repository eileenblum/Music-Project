Blow it up
My condition
My conviction
Couldn't stop if I wanted to
Oaths of my addiction
This affliction
For you it's methodical
Modern day Gods do it all the time
Counting on the ways
Do another line
I'm traditional
I'm a radical
True fanatical for you

You can be my slave
I will be your savior
I command you
Through this I will save you
Make another spell
Fix our evolution
We will bury this wasteland

Can't hear the vision
Can't see the mission
Infinite Wayne's are 
Are writing all these verses
On the same plane
Given space time
Carry it across imaginary lines
Unconditional
I'm a radical
True fanatical
It's true

You can be my slave
I will be your savior
I command you
Through this I will save you
Make another spell
Fix our evolution
We will bury this wasteland
Driving you inside 

I know what you like and
Doing it well
I know what is right an
Play show and tell
This is our solution
Take it all the way
Do it all the time
