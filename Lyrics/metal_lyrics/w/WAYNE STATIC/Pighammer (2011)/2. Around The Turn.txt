Magic slipping
Tightly gripping
Exhale waiting
Dedicating
Lower slower
Glowing flower
New dawn fading
Will pass over

Give up on the drifting
Get up, I'm resisting 
Falling out
Take it, driving faster
Take it, my passenger
Around the turn

Something missing
End of tripping (Needles in my hands)
Feeling I'm
Decapitating (A shadowless form)
Feeling restless
Conscious protest (Scheming with the plan)
Silent fighting to get past this

All I want
Suck it up
Never stop
All I want

Take a hit
Take a shot
Higher Hell
Back it up
