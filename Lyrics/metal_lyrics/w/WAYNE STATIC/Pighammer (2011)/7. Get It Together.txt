Get It Together

Here we lie
The beginning
This eternal
Save us all
Try to put it back together
Timing's right to evoke a secret seance
Time to fight this undying hunger
There's no lying
Deepest darkest
I'm accepting we've been using
This could still become a sticky situation
Got to deal with these urges no

Get it together
Yeah
Get it together

End of night
The beginning

This infernal
Trade it all
Do it over so forgetful
See the light
It all happens for a reason
Time to kill this unending season
There's no lying
Deepest darkest
I'm accepting  it's the hardest
Take my body
Take away the hesitation
Take away the sensation

Thinking about the days when we went insane
Snorted ten pills
Started hallucinating
Popped some Viagra to make my hair stand up
The Patron kicks in and it melts my brain
And then there was the time that we were inside out
Ate enough E to turn my hair into frosting
5 am in the parking lot
Couldn't help ourselves
We just couldn't stop it
No remorse, no regrets
I'd do it all again if I had the chance
End of night, see the light
Rode the horse and I aced the test
Time to fight it off
Time to come together
Time to turn it up

Make the case
Kill the moth
Self revealed
Take the loss
Can't replace
Just because
What we feel is chaos
Use this trust to get it together
