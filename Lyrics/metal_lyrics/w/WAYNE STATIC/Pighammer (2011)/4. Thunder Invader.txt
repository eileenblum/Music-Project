Distant commencing
Crush the offensive
Fire the drum that
Jump starts the turbine
Pinching the hole
Through every existence
Turn it up

Thunder
Invader
Distorted
Creator

Carving the sky
The flares split the darkness
Steel away to bring the 
Deafening silence
Format the noise
To low oscillation
Decimate

Flares rise
Pierce the night sky
Now hear
Nowhere to hide
Invader!
