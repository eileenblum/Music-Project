When Sorrow Calls My Name
And Grief Runs In My Veins
Can I Begin
The Bleeding

When Air Becomes A Pain
And It Hurts To Inhale
Can I Just Stop
Cease Breathing

A Shriek From The Void
Exhales The Words
Painted To Be Seen
Screams From Within

Speaks Softly, Howls Aloud
Rushing Towards Like A Tide
Drowns Like A Flood
Buries Inside

Vaikka Aurinko Jo Nousi
Ja Valossa Kylpee Maa
JÃ¤Ã¤ Minussa Ei Murru SillÃ¤ SisÃ¤llÃ¤ni On Vain PimeÃ¤Ã¤ Ja KylmÃ¤Ã¤
