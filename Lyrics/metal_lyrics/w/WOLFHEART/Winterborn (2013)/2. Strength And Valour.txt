Defeated And Conquered
By The Rival Superior, Adversary Greater In Worth
Vile Horde From The Dark

Destroyer And Slaughter
Of All Adored, Pure And Divine
All Torn Asunder, All Torn Apart

Last Day Of The War
Last Line Of Defence
Few Still Standing Tall
Outnumbered Are The Men Of Valour

First Strike Of Assault
First Blood That Was Drawn
Brought The Demise
Death By The Blade
End By The Sword

The Absence Of The Light Replaced The Fallen Sun
And The Dusk Veiled The World Deserted
Last Rays Of Light Reached The Heroes Unsung
Before The Dawn Of Darkness Ascended

Headstones In A Frozen Ground
Mark The Tombs Of The Courageous
Killing Fields Conceal The Tombs Of The Braves
Infinite Slumber In Six Feet Under

Last Day Of The War
Last Line Of Defence
Soon Defeated And Conquered
Outnumbered Are The Men Of Valour
