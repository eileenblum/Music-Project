Let ravens guide you here
Into the fields
Silent and cold

The last blade has fallen
Into the ground
Silent and cold
Winter enfolds

Let your wings unfold

Cold winds of the north
Rush through woods
Silent and old

Let the storm bring you here
Where blood of the few
Of the worthy runs cold

Let your wings unfold
