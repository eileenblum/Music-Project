Hellfire burns in my core
Black flame of defiance
Like a pyre, fire consumes
Into ashes it burns

Triumph or demise
Awaits in the end
Triumph or demise
Before the sun descends

Tight grip on the blade
Outnumbered but not beaten
Determined to prevail
Destined to prevail

Towards the higher ground
Preserve and defend
Strike back, strike hard
Until the end

Triumph or demise
Awaits in the end
Triumph or demise
Before the sun descends

Charge ahead
Attack is the best defense
Ride ahead
Their death is your revenge

Triumph or demise
Awaits in the end
Triumph or demise
Before the sun descends
