Assemble and build
From the ore of the ground
Isolate the iron from the stone

Let the fire fill the mold
The shape of the blade
Poured into the clay

Let the fire forge

The hammer strikes
One thousand times
Use the fire's force
Black flame of power

Let the hammer rise
One final time
Use the water's force
To cool the searing core

Sharpen and grind
So that the edge of the blade
Will cut through the flesh

Balance and weigh
Find the line for the strike
Target the damage
Inflict the pain
Wreak the destruction

The hammer strikes
One thousand times
Use the fire's force
Black flame of power

Let the hammer rise
One final time
Use the water's force
To cool the searing core
