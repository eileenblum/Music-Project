A scream from the past, the story of the truth (of the truth)
It came from the frost of my mind
The breath in the dark, oh my heart is burning (burning so hot)
Dark eyes are burning, I wake up with thousands of more

[Chorus:]
Stream from the sky
A flow takes me down
The trees comes up to shine
Then comes the rain with golden tears
Stream from the sky
A flow takes me down
The trees comes up to shine
Then comes the rain with golden tears

Freezing wind blows, my eyes deep black
The night has fallen over and over the land (over the frozen land)
All the dreams will shattered, IÂ´m gone so far (so fucking far)
Only darkness and suffering, I left behind

"All the dreams will shattered, IÂ´m gone so far
Only darkness and suffering, I left behind"

[Chorus]
