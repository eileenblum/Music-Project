Wandering in the land of the ancient winds
I see the shadows burning the frozen land beyond

[Chorus:]
The journey over the frozen hills
Wandering by the darkened instinct of mind
One frozen swanswarm leaves behind
My journey to the land of eternal...  (winter)

The winds spread the voice of my bleeding heart
It warns for the face of true destruction
The bloody claws only wants to win and to win
To doom those victims of eternal frost

[Chorus]

Why must all the thoughts come true
Those crimes for the freedom host of darkess
I walk on the path of eternal darkness
My claws bleeding for the last battle

[Chorus]
