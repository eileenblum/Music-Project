In the dark and the cold where the sun had died and all light forever gone
I can see their souls are screaming for frost at the altar of north
With the glow of the north, with that taste of their blood
Under those flames they had wandered for thousand frozen years

(And they were... )

[Chorus:]
Dreaming... for eternal sleep
Screaming... for that glow in the dark
Fighting... for their endless beautiful pain
Dying... in the cold of the north where all dreams can be true

Ah, those flames in the dark burn my raged mind
Ah, the glow in my eyes - oh, it will be the key

The breath of the night the sound of the northwind
I had awaited this moment to gather my ancient souls
My blazing stare has chosen the second victim
This night will be the gate to the landscape of my dreams

In the dark and the cold where the sun had died and all light forever gone
I can see their souls are screaming for frost at the altar of north
With the glow of the north, with that taste of their blood

[Chorus]

I hear my dreams will be my quest and I can see my truth...
For that beautiful flight in the dark
I can taste my mind will be true at this night and I can fly
To the landscape of my dreams...
And IÂ´ll be complete
