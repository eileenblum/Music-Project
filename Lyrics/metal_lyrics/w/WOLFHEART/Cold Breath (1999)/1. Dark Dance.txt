ItÂ´s raining, an old moonchild has gone
The throne was made for the dark whisper
Wild soul lives with no hope
Final night is the dream of the end

No... I shall loose

Darkness flows over my heart...
This night... the shadows
The gate is closed... IÂ´m black
Thunderborn... at the dawn of eternity
I will die by the light of the day
Will the moon shine for the last night
The light no more...
No... I will fall - no... to the ground

No... I will fall - no... to the ground
