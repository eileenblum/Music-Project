"The darkened sky,
Stars of the north
Thunder with the icy storm
Frost, and wind...
IÂ´m home
At the northgate"

I feel the wind... oh, it comes with frost
The trees have lost their souls
Darkness flows over my closed eyes
ItÂ´s time to be left behind

I know the clouds were made through my oldest dreams
Cold winds told me the gate is open

Fresh breath of unborn victim
The deepest sleep in the mother north
Lunatic waste of the shadowdancer
Those candles will burn until I fly

[Repeat Verse I]

I know the clouds were made through my oldest dreams
Cold winds told me the gate is open
I see the truth, I feel the gate
The winterchild will be born with wind

At the northgate...
The northgate...
The northgate...
The northgate...
