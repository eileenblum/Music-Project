Profound is the grief
Fathomless and downhearted is the silence
Overwhelms like a flood
Drowns into the deep dark waters

The ocean floor
Somber and bleary surrounding
Beneath the ice
Frozen surface has begun
To block the light of the sun

The absence of light
Breeds and altered reality
Faithful and familiar

Desolation, despair
Like a dead space inside of me
Creates a zero gravity
Existence
Without intention

Footprints on the snow
Covered by the frozen rain from the north
A trace leading into the dark
A grand isolation

Cold is the air to inhale
Cold is the heart impaired
Glacial blood runs in your veins
Pitch-black and frosty ichor
