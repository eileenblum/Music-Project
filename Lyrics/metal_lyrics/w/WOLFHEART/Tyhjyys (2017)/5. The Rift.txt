Standing on the coast
Hearing black waters call my name
Waves carry the whispers
To the shore

With the wind
The surface of the sea begins to stir
The storm is closing in

Rising from the north

Whispers turn into a scream
The fury of the winds
Drain power from the sea

Black rain falls
Upon the earth
Cleanse it from the blood
Pour the flood

Into the sea
Let the current pull me under
Let me fall into the ocean floor

Into the deep
Towards the darkest grandeur
Of the northern trench
Into the abyss i fall

The rift will conceal
Buries in the tomb
In the absence of the light

The pressure ties the chains
The darkness blinds the eyes
The waters of the north
Swallow inside
