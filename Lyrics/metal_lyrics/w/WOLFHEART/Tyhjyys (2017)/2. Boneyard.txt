In the eye of the final storm
The winds are rising
And you stare into the void

Death has come to claim these lands
Pale horse leads the wave
Desolation follows
As the darkness leads the way

Seek and destroy
Scorch the earth
Burn the world for all its worth
Unleash the flames

Assault is the best defense
Outnumbered armed for last attempt
Marching forth

Waiting for arrival
Of the final dawn
Flames ascend from the horizon
When we go forth

The genocide
All assaulters are destined to fall
Demise for them all

Lives will be taken before
The sun goes down
And crimson moon will rise
