Whispers of a name, make me open my eyes,
I try to shut them out, but then your face just comes to mind.
I've seen you in my past, maybe I knew you long ago?
A beauty from my dreams? No, the truth I think I know.
I remember,
An angel now you are,
I wish well wherever, wherever you are my love.

Spirits shall whisper stories about you, again tonight
The stars will yield, your soul will shine so bright
Spirits shall whisper stories about you, again tonight
Your name will carve the essence of the night

As time will pass I feel, the pain will die away,
I might even forget, a memory will stay.
I wish that I was free, and part this tyranny,
We never should have met, this love I must regret
An illusion,
I never will forget,
I'll keep you, hold you, worship, your love once more I'll have.
Call it a sickness, call it what you will,
My love will never die, a way to bring you back I'll find
You are my obsession, your spirit I will confiscate
You'll my bidding; we'll never be apart again.
