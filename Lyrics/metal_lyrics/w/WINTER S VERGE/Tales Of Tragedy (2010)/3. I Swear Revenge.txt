I stood there unblessed, for I wish I could taste death
My glory... I'm sorry
She rose from her bed, now a child of the dead
She'd become
The man cried his dear, more rushed in froze in fear
A coward I was once again
I ran to the shadows, fled back to my barrows
Of mourning
Tonight they would burn her alive
In the centre of town
I watched from afar, her screams filled the dark
They've woken the beast in my mind

I swear revenge
I accept what I am, eternally damned
I swear revenge
With the dark as my strength, a child of the dead
Revenge

This was unfair, more than I could just bear
I'm forsaken
I'm punished from guilt, from the fear I would wilt
I repent
I should have fought back
A craven I am
I watched as the flames took her life
This will not go on
I swear I won't fall
I'll kill them before the sunrise
Before the sun wakens
Your souls will be taken
You gave me this sinister right
Beware of my evil
'Fore I am deceitful
Your blood will fill rivers tonight
