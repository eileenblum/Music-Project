I open the chest of time and look deep inside
A world of hate and suffering emerges to my eyes
Wars and blood spilling a planet of death
They crawl and claw to reach the top whoever reaches first

Time curses everything for all of mankind
A better future nonsense exists in our minds
Years will pass and suffering evolves through our lives
None can stand the endless curse of time

The vision changes suddenly pitch black is all I see
A darkness creeps inside of me my dream is now reality
The desert of time has reached the chest
And now it's caught up with me, Am I the soul that's next?
