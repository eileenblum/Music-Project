So, "life will end and once we'll live"
That is what some believe
Live your dreams until they fade
Every second, every day
And then when someone close will die
We cherish all their memories inside
Forever will our hearts be carved
With pain for those that we have loved

Raise your hands
For the ones who are gone
Tonight they will hear us
From the great beyond
Close your eyes, free your souls, do not cry, do not mourn...

So, "life goes on and we'll return"
That is what some people yearn
A better life from that they lived
Away from all of mankind's filth
And then when all is said and done
And someone loved is dead and gone
They will be back, they'll live again
A better life a different end
Remember them and honor them
Respect them for their lives,
Believe in them and cherish them
Forever Deep in side
