To the deepest ocean floor
Many hundred years ago
Sank a beauty of the sea
Her name was âSemeniâ
Now the Sailors have a tale
In hopeless times they see her sails
And If she sings her eerie tune
To follow her she beckons you

The sky is black the thunder roars
Colossal waves, a screaming storm
âMan the deck!
Prepare the sails!
Sheâs claiming us!â
The captain wails

Out from the dark, a symphony
Into our hearts, now weâre in need
Of a miracle
Great sails of white, show the way
Into the night, take us away
Oh âSemeniâ

With Strength in heart we gave our all,
A chance to see our kin once more
âBut sheâs too strong!
All hope is gone!
This is the end
God save our souls!â

Out from the dark, a symphony
Into our hearts, now weâre in need
Of a miracle
Great sails of white, show the way
Into the night, take us away
Oh âSemeniâ

We bowed our heads, this was
Defeat for us
And tried with God to find our
Peace save us.
So as we prayed a tune was heard
That brought our hears
Back from the dead!
As we raised our heads to see
Her name was painted âSemeniâ
A ship so great as bright as day
And as she sailed the storm gave way
âFollow her!â
Out from the dark, a symphony
Into our hearts, now weâre in need
Of a miracle
Great sails of white, show the way
Into the night, take us away
Oh âSemeniâ
