Legends tells of burning flames
Of Childrenâs screams and fires untamed
And when the smoke had cleared away
These walls had any tales engraves

Endless Whispers fill my mind
As I made a step inside

From the shadows they appear
Turning into nightmares
They would twist inside my head
And yield me to my fears
Ashes scattered faces angered watching me
As the darkness took my thoughts and
Blinded me

I turned and ran towards the door
But felt a chill run through my bones
The darkness swept, it captured me
Its icy grip wonât set me free

Pain and terror filled my soul
Iâve been trapped itâs been so long

From the shadows they appear
Turning into nightmares
They would twist inside my head
And yield me to my fears
Ashes scattered faces angered watching me
As the darkness took my thoughts and
Blinded me

Orphan children, cursed and angered
In the blackness needed comfort
Cunning lullabies I sang them as I crept
Out from the darkness

From the shadows they appear
Turning into nightmares
They would twist inside my head
And yield me to my fears
Ashes scattered faces angered watching me
As the darkness took my thoughts and
Blinded me
