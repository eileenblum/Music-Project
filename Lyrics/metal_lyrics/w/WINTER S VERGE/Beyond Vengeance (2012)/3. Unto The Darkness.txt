For too long i waited for a bride to
Walk the ages.
And then when I had found her you just
Burned her to the ground.
I swore revenge in madness
For this would ease my sadness
You took the one I longed for
Mercy died without a sound

I will take what you took from me
I will laugh as now you will scream

Unto the darkness I send thee
All your women alive
You will feel what I felt all this time
My anger controls me
Your future now begs
Unto the darkness I send thee tonight

All that i could hear were their cries
Inside my ears
I judge thee to damnation, no remorse
You die tonight
I smiled and then I tore through their
Flesh with all my claws
I then tasted their blood as slowly death
Would creep inside

Not one will survive
Your fates I decide

Unto the darkness I send thee
All your women alive
You will feel what i felt all this time
My anger controls me
Your future now begs
Unto the darkness I send thee tonight

You will suffer for my pain!
Endless darkness now awaits!
Worthless cries have no effect
My black heart was always dead.

Unto the darkness i send thee
All your women alive
You will feel what i felt all this time
My anger controls me
Your future now begs
Unto the darkness I send thee tonight
