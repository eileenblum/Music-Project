[Bonus Track]I remember being young
All I dreamt was for a farm
But one winter dawn the soldiers came
And from the on
My dreams had changed
The greatest honor this had been
That every man wished they had seen
A knight of pride for king and land
So now this is what Iâve become

A dream for a dream
Thereâs no regret
Reward my even be my death
No matter though, carped diem
A Love for life this, gave me strength

Today we fight, a warsâ at hand
We will not fail, till death we stand
My brothersâ¦lost weâre left a few
I feel my time is coming soon
I raised my arm for one last time
A final charge was set in mind
But as my arm came down to strike
A pain had shot straight through my spine

A dream for a dream
Thereâs no regret
Reward may even be my death
No matter though, carpe diem
A love for life this, gave me strength

I lie here cold, close to my end
And soon I too will join my friends
So just before I close my eyes
I remember my old life
This is ironic.. I admit
I gave up my dreams to come to this
Farewell oâworld I wish you well
I leave you now âtis my last breath

A dream for a dream
Thereâs no regret
Reward may even be my death
No matter thought carpe diem
A love for life this, gave me strength
