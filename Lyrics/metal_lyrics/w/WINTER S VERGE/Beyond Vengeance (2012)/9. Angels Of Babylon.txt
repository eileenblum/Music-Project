So can you hear me now?
We are calling out your names
Remember us, the very last
The ones to make a change
So canât you see us now?
We are hanging on the edge
No return, our final stand
This cannot be the end

We cry out to you

Angels of Babylon, tell me what have we become?
The Holy City, the Gate of God
Now rubble in the sand
Angels of Babylon tell me what must be done?
Guide our ways, to the glory days,
We are the chosen ones
Angels of Babylon

Have you forgotten us?
Have you turned your backs?
Here we are, in a no manâs land
Afraid of what will come

We cry out to you

Angels of Babylon, tell me what have we become?
The Holy City, the Gate of God
Now rubble in the sand
Angels of Babylon tell me what must be done?
Guide our ways, to the glory days,
We are the chosen ones
Angels of Babylon
