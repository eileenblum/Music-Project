11 years ago today
I lost her to the sea
And every day that passes by
I feel Iâve lost a part of me

Every year, the day before
I feel the ocean breeze
And as the pain begins to sink
It brings me to my knees

I find a stick and carve my pain
Into the sand I write
A message from my heart that aches
That cannot see the light

Ever since the day you died
I cruse the ground I walk
I wish that I could take your place
As this would sooth my soul
The tears that I have shed for you
Will never be enough
And my eternal suffering
Canât stop my bleeding heart

I break the stick and throw it far
Into the wet abyss
And hope that it will bring it back
With a message from my love
I wait for night and the tide to rise
To take my letter in
And somewhere in my darkest depths
A candle lights within

A little hope wakes up inside
That my letter will be read
And when the morning sun will rise
Her answer will be there

Ever since the day you died
I cruse the ground I walk
I wish that I could take your place
As this would sooth my soul
The tears that I have shed for you
Will never be enough
And my eternal suffering
Canât stop my bleeding heart

I wake up slowly from my dreams
And look towards the sea,
And on the sand a message carved
Was written next to me

Ever since the day I died
You curse the ground you walk
I wish that you would end this things
As this would soothe my soul
The tears that you have shed for me
Have surely been enough
I ask thee just remember me
And keep me in your heart

And my eternal suffering
Canât stop my bleeding heart
