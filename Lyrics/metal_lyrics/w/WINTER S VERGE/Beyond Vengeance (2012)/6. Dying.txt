Iâm walking alone, out on the road
Nowhere to go but in circles

My memories gone, I canât recall
Been searching my soul for the answers

I woke up senseless in a pool of blood
No feeling in my hands
A crying blackness,
Racing through my heart
That I canât understand

I am lost in time, in a paradox
Endless thoughts run through my mind
And as the hours pass
I watch my hourglass
Inside Iâm dying

5 days have passed, still in the dark
I have no sense of direction

As I move along, from cornet to stone
I canât control this regression

I canât feel my heart beat no more
An emptiness cloaks me
The recollection of my very being
Not even as a dream

I am lost in time, in a paradox
Endless thoughts run through my mind
And as the hours pass
I watch my hourglass
Inside Iâm dying

I am lost in time, in a paradox
Endless thoughts run through my mind
And as the hours pass
I watch my hourglass
Inside Iâm dying

And all thatâs left for me
Is not even a memory
Of my old life
Of the day I died
