Here i hide in purpose
With aim to bring you down
For i have planned to bury you
6 feet into the ground
Outside these walls you hunt me
But this will be no more
As i become the hunter until the
Day Iâm gone

I watched you burn our houses
I saw you kill my friends
I cried as you were torturing our
Women to their end

Take my life, take it all
But youâll never take my soul
No more pain, itâs my right
I will not go down without a fight

One by one I crush you
From mists I have appeared
I have become a nightmare
Your greatest deadly fear
You thought that we are weaker
Your strength in numbers lay
Our strength i not a number;
Our hearts show us the way

You set a bounty on me
âThe most wanted man aliveâ
Youâd better raise that number or youâll
Never get the prize

Take my life, take it all
But youâll never take my soul
No more pain, itâs my right
I will not go down without a fight

For months now I have fought you
Iâve killed a thousand men
But betrayal has deceived me
A traitor from my own land
You finally had found me
âSurrenderâ you said then
âWhy donât you come and take me
Or are you still afraid?â

Take my life, take it all
But youâll never take my soul
No more pain, itâs my right
I will not go down without a fight
