Here I stand with the wind on my face
And it seems I can hear your voice
Far from the depths of this cruel
Desert world
That takes, and gives you no choice
I remember that cold winter mourn
You left and did not say goodbye
We argued so much the previous night
Although I knew that you always
Were right

I should have listened to the ravenâs cry
I would have wiped your tears aside
I could have drowned my ego and tired
To hold you one last time
One last night

I sat on the porch with your words in
My mind
And I thought of the pain in your eyes
I knew there and then that I had to find
A way
To say Iâm sorry and swallow my pride
The sound of the phone seized
My thoughts
As a feeling of joy filled my heart
But the voice a the end of the line
Said the road had taken your life

I should have listened to the ravenâs cry
I would have wiped your tears aside
I could have drowned my ego and tired
To hold you one last time
One last night

So here I am, standing on your grave
My heart is shattered
With empty tears raining down my face
That I canât see from the disgrace
I wish that I could turn back time and
Change all that has happened
So we could have just one more night
Before our days would darken

I should have listened to the ravenâs cry
I would have wiped your tears aside
I could have drowned my ego and tired
To hold you one last time
One last night
