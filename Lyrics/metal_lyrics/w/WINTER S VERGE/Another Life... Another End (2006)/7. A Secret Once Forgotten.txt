High above the creaky staircase
Hangs the painting on the wall
In a house, long forgotten
The painting's left to rot alone
A lake so peaceful in the night time
The moon's reflection shining bright
A creeping shadow from the darkness
Approaches the light
The moon's reflection starts to whither
From the wind that comes to life
A lightning flash, distant thunder
There she strolls, wanting to die...

This painting tells a story,
A tragic death in the past
No one knows when it happened,
Or how it came to pass
Every time the clock strikes midnight,
The painting glows alive
The secret that was once forgotten,
Has come to show up in this light

The woman walks into the water,
Slowly sinking into the depths
There she stays beneath the surface
No return, her mind is set
The painting then begins to darken
The wind slowly starts to calm down
The water calms, a mournful sadness
A vanished moon, the painting stands
The secret once that was forgotten
Is not her death, but why she drowned
A failing marriage, a loved one's passing
Or a madness... ending now

This painting tells a story,
A tragic death in the past
No one knows when it happened,
Or how it came to pass
Every time the clock strikes midnight,
The painting glows alive
The secret once that was forgotten,
Has come to show up in this light
