Lost in a world of darkness,
Where light is just a memory
Damned into eternal blackness
Alone I know, I won't be free
So I look above and I scream
With all the strength that's left in me

Can you hear me? I'm sitting in the corner of my life
Can you see me? Shine a little light
Can you hear me? I'm sitting in the corner of my life
Can you see me? Shine a little light

Trapped in a cage of sorrow
Regrets are all that cover me
Spun in a web of silence
I can't hear the voice that comes from me
So I close my eyes and I dream
Reality is lost it seems

Can you hear me? I'm sitting in the corner of my life
Can you see me? Shine a little light
Can you hear me? I'm sitting in the corner of my life
Can you see me? Shine a little light

Where am I what have I done
To deserve all this
I try to think but my mind seems blank
I'm stuck alone in a bliss...

Can you hear me? I'm sitting in the corner of my life
Can you see me? Shine a little light
Can you hear me? I'm sitting in the corner of my life
Can you see me? Shine a little light
