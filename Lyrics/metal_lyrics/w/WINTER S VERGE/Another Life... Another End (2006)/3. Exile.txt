As silence grows inside my mind
I need my wings to open wide
I want to sit here be alone
I watch the sunset as it goes
Memories are inside me now
To stars of destiny I shall bow
The light of planets that is fading
Here as fallen we are raging

Then we shall stay here now my lord
And let the punishment unfold
To thee I look up feeling shame
My eyes are blinded sealed in pain.. Exile

I want to see your eras changing
Feel the summoned eternal winds
The winter is cold and never ending
And we stay frozen by our sins
So we remain here now my lord
Until our hands fall like the leaves
Common mortals, we have changed to
Without a spirit or our wings

Then we shall stay here now my lord
And let the punishment unfold
To thee I look up feeling shame
My eyes are blinded sealed in pain.. Exile

I need time to pass so I'll stay here
Forever locked inside my fear
With no beginning and without an end
Let the silence be my friend
Who will cover up our stream of tears?
In this exile of pain and fear
When will the time be right and come?
To raise us high above the sun

Do you hear our screams of agony?
Neglectful you tear us apart
To whom shall we entrust our tragedy?
Here as fallen we depart...
