With the crack of dawn, the bells will ring
And there we'll say goodbye,
We meet again my good old friend
For one discreet last time
You lie in peace, with no soul within
My silent heart remains
And now I have to wander life
In misery and pain

Tears fill my eyes as I look upon your deserted body
Fears fill my mind as I know you won't be there beside me
But someday I believe that we'll meet again, my friend
So for now, I'll just say goodbye
So for now, I'll just say goodbye

In fear I reach for your soulless eyes
Your hand is cold - no lie, you've died
Pretending not is so damn cruel
A darkened soul, my fear is fueled
My life is shattered, descending started
As horror takes my every inch
So until we meet again my friend
In another life another end

Tears fill my eyes as I look upon your deserted body
Fears fill my mind as I know you won't be there beside me
But someday I believe that we'll meet again, my friend
So for now, I'll just say goodbye
So for now, I'll just say goodbye

"Listen to me, my good old friend
As I can see you now down there
Things are not as what they say
I cannot tell you can't explain
I must just ask for one more thing
Don't cry for me, my dying wish
One thing is for sure, we'll meet again
In another life another end"

Tears fill my eyes as I look upon your deserted body
Fears fill my mind as I know you won't be there beside me
But someday I believe that we'll meet again, my friend
So for now, I'll just say goodbye
So for now, I'll just say goodbye
