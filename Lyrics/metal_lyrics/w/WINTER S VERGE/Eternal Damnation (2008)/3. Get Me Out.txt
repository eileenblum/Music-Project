Four are the walls that surround me,
One is the reason I'm here,
They broke my spirit, they killed me,
They left me to bleed in my fear.

"Murder" they screamed, their voices rang loud,
"Take him to prison, in guilt he will drown,
Forever he'll stay, 'till death greets him warm
And there he'll be judged for the sins he has done!"

Get me out of here, take my soul, take my fear,
Get me out of here, give me my freedom,
Get me out!

I once cut my wrists, I twice tried to hang,
I dreamt I heard bells from my own funeral,
And just when I thought, that all was in vain,
They brought back my life and then cursed out my name.

Get me out of here, take my soul, take my fear,
Get me out of here, give me my freedom,
Get me out!

I cannot live this life no more, I cannot feel myself,
I can't find peace within myself, I beg you let me go,
I close my eyes and try to dream, but nothing comes to mind,
I wish I could just kill myself, but death is not so kind!

Get me out of here, take my soul, take my fear,
Get me out of here, give me my freedom,
Get me out!
