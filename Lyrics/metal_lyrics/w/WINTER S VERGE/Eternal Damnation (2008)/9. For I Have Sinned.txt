I would not have come, I did not approve
But now I feel it's time
A long time since I've last confessed
My horrors deep inside

I fear I've killed a thousand men
A thousand wasted lives
And now I have a lust for blood
That burns inside my mind

Forgive me father, for I have sinned
And guilty is what I plead
I know I'm lost and damned for life,
My deeds are now revealed
I can't turn back, the road is long
Too long for me to try
For I have sinned and sin I will
Deep down the well of life

At war, they say, you cannot not fail!
You have to kill or die,
But deep inside I always knew
I craved to take a life

A wrongful deed, a tiresome lust
A feeling un-described
That second just before they die
The terror in their eyes

Forgive me father, for I have sinned
And guilty is what I plead
I know I'm lost and damned for life,
My deeds are now revealed
I can't turn back, the road is long
Too long for me to try
For I have sinned and sin I will
Deep down the well of life

I'm dancing with fate, with death on my side
Your blood is what I crave
An undying sin, my evil within
Father, I cannot be saved.

Forgive me father, for I have sinned
And guilty is what I plead
I know I'm lost and damned for life,
My deeds are now revealed
I can't turn back, the road is long
Too long for me to try
For I have sinned and sin I will
Deep down the well of life
