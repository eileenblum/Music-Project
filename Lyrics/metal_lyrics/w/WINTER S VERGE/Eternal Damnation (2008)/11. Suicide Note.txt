I rise up from the ashes completely torn apart
I'm left to dry the tears from my heart
Forgiven, forgotten, it sounds the same to me
As fate has done its work eventually

An overbearing darkness creeps deep into my soul
I'm forced to play another man's role
Lying and pretending I try to hide myself
As no one has seen beneath this shell
My shell

I write this letter, a poem from my heart
These words you read are sealed with my blood
So if you're reading this, my friend - whoever you are
Know I've gone away, away afar

I write this letter, a poem from my heart
These words you read are sealed with my blood
So if you're reading this, my friend - whoever you are
Know I've gone away, away afar
And this suicide note I leave behind
And this suicide note I leave behind
