I searched for her, long and hard
In every corner I could find
In every street, in every bar
But lost she was a fallen star

I thought I'd stop, a hopeless man
I turned my head and there she was
Lying cold a soulless life
Her wrists were slashed from side to side

A year has passed since that dreadful night
A nightmare screaming in my mind
It seems unreal, like never done
I've lost my love, alone, ashamed,

Every night she visits me, sadly
She comes to me, with tears in her eyes
She lies by me, and whispers "I love you"
But by morning she's nowhere to be found

I wake up dazed and so confused
Did I just dream or was it you?
I don't believe it was not true
Am I going mad? What must I do?

Trapped in a world of make believe
I think that nothing's what it seems
My winter sun, I know you died
I saw you there with my own eyes

A broken puzzle in my mind
I'm trying to find these missing parts
Trying to melt, dissolve away
That frozen picture, cursed to stay

Every night she visits me, sadly
She comes to me, with tears in her eyes
She lies by me, and whispers "I love you"
But by morning she's nowhere to be found

Last night, an eerie scene took place
She stood so cold an icy face
Aghast inside, a raging fear into my eyes
She bluntly peered

I heard her voice inside my head
"My love, don't cry - your eyes don't lie
My spirit lives forever on, inside your heart
You keep me strong"

Every night she visits me, sadly
She comes to me, with tears in her eyes
She lies by me, and whispers "I love you"
But by morning she's nowhere to be found
But by morning she's nowhere to be found
