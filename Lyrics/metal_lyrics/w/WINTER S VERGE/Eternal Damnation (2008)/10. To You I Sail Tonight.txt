Fading light from your memory still stays
In my heart, your smile still remains
Empty words in the book of my life
As the tears from your eyes paint my mind
Seven months from the day you are gone
It's like seven hundred years, seven life times ago,
If there was a way, I would bring you to me,
Through hellfire and brimstone, at the ends of the seas

What must it take for the dead to revive?
Where should I go and what must I give?
An old man of wisdom who knows about death and rebirth
Will tell me the answers for the riddles I search
"Deep in the seas where the dark water lays,
North from the islands of mist and of rain,
Behind the straight line where the sun hides to rest,
There is the kingdom you crave of the dead."

I hear your voice and my heart grows stronger,
I feel your soul and my tears run dry,
I see your face at the edge of the horizon,
To you my love, I Sail Tonight

Lightning and thunder - I'm trapped in a storm
Captured by chains of water and foam
The rain and the sea, my true enemy
The anger of nature that stands in my way

I struggle for you, to look into your eyes
You are the color of the tears that I cry
When I look in the water, reflections are dark,
Dark like the tears of my tired aching heart

I hear your voice and my heart grows stronger,
I feel your soul and my tears run dry,
I see your face at the edge of the horizon,
To you my love, I Sail Tonight

What force is this that commands the seas?
What hell has broken loose? What demon is this?
My fear and my pain will not go in vain,
Our love is strong, it lights my way...

I hear your voice and my heart grows stronger,
I feel your soul and my tears run dry,
I see your face at the edge of the horizon,
To you my love, I Sail Tonight
