I close my eyes and dream of what we had
An endless love that lived through good and bad
We could surpass the stars, a real life's dream
You were the source of life that drove the blood in me
A twist of fate took place and one disheartened day
I blinked my eyes and turned and you just ran away
I begged and cried for you to stay,
Your words were poison in my veins

Hold my hand you said to me
Follow me and you will see
Love is what we'll have forever
Stay with me and we'll endeavor

A broken soul betrayed, lost, dissolving
I feel my world is turning upside down
Your voice was full of passion, deceit and lies
That shattered my heart and turned out the lights
I can't seem to remember what love is
A tear of joy, or of sadness
I try to imagine you and me
But all I seem to do is want to cry

Hold my hand you said to me
Follow me and you will see
Love is what we'll have forever
Stay with me and we'll endeavor

Where are you? Now I'm calling you
I need you now the most!
Where's this love I'm calling to?
She's left me just a ghost...

Hold my hand you said to me
Follow me and you will see
Love is what we'll have forever
Stay with me and we'll endeavor
