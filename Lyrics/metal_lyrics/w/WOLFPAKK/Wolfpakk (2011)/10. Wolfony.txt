I know that our race is
Close to their downfall
Wolves been here for ages
Waiting for the call

Old and wise their sitting
Up there on the hill
You will never wipe out
This proud wild animal

Come over here
I was following your track
Hey leader of your pack
For I show no fear

The dungeons far away
Waiting for the night
From some strange forbidden land
You will hear their lone cries
When they're barking at the moon
Their unsung melody
It's wolfony

I wanna live in freedom
I wanna join your club
Tho I'm of human nature
I'm needed to adopt

Come over here
I was following your track
Hey leader of your pack
For I show no fear

In the dungeons far away
Waiting for the night
From some strange forbidden land
You will hear their lone cries
When they're barking at the moon
Their unsung melody

It's wolfony

Homo homini lupus [8x]
Man is the enemy not the wolf
Man is the enemy not the wolf

I know that our race is
Close to their downfall
The wolves been here for ages
Waiting for the call

Come over here
I was following your track
Hey leader of your pack
For I show no fear
In the dungeons far away
Waiting for the night
From some strange forbidden land
You will hear their lone cries
When they're barking at the moon
Their unsung melody
It's wolfony

Homo homini lupus [2x]
