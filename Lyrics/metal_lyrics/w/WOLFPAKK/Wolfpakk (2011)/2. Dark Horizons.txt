Darkest rain
I will never lose the pain
To die
Keeps me alive

Burning flames
I will always loose this game
Dark side
Show me the light

It's too late
A cloud is rising
A cold embrace
Before I wake

The time has come
I fall to pieces and I see

Dark horizons
I don't wanna see
Dark horizons
They are chasing me

Shining light
I will always find the fight
To hear
What I wanna see

It's getting darker
All you got is pain
But the hurt is in vain

It's too late
A cloud is rising
A cold embrace
Before I wake

The time has come
I fall to pieces and I see

Dark horizons
I don't wanna see
Dark horizons
They are chasing me

Dark horizons
My nightmare's near at hand
Dark horizons
Lucifer's no friend
