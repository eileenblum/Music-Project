Here it comes, bringing pain
Another nightmare but it's always been my friend

I can't resist party time, but I go crazy
When the circus comes to town

Hello mister rollercoaster
I'm gonna get u

Ride the bullet
Going down it will make you scream
Ride the bullet
You are trapped in this endless dream
Ride the bullet
Get yourself a ticket for this trip to hell
Wish you farewell
Ride the bullet

It's your passion it's a thrill
For speed and lust
All ready for the kill

Burning rails, screaming gears
Tempting death
You'll never break my will

Ride the bullet
You are trapped
In this endless dream
Ride the bullet

For a ride to hell
Ride to hell
