Soldiers of twilight made of steel
Raising their swords and now they ride
Into the fight without morality
They all got blood on their hands
Causing all troubles in the night
They got the symptoms of insanity

Thousands of people have died
Too many tears have been cried

They slammed the hammer
They slammed the hammer down
Ready to kill in for the thrill
Slammed the hammer down
They slammed the hammer
They slammed the hammer down
In for the thrill ready to kill
Slammed down the hammer

Visions of victory in mind
Battalions of warheads on the way
Dignity fades into obscurity
It's time to leave this deadly scene
Whatever they say it may not seem
Like caught in a dream without infinity

Thousands of people have died
Too many tears have been cried

They slammed the hammer
They slammed the hammer down
Ready to kill in for the thrill
Slammed the hammer down
They slammed the hammer
They slammed the hammer down
In for the thrill ready to kill
Slammed down the hammer
