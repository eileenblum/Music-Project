I will wear a thousand faces
I'm alone, I'm waiting to fall in disgrace

It's like wheels are spinning for races
The perfect grip I'm setting the pace
Help me before it's too late

Time is running - I cannot wait

Sirens in my head
Thousands of faces
Are crying like demons
Silence in my soul
Please show the way
'cause my future is sold today

My future is sold today

There's a cast of thousands waiting
But the shadow's still here
I still live in fear

Can't you show or send me a sign
I will fight until the end of my time

Help me before it's too late
Time is running - I cannot wait

Sirens in my head

Thousands of faces
Are crying like demons

Silence in my soul

Please show me the way
'cause my future is sold today

Sirens in my head

Thousands of faces
Are crying like demons
Silence in my soul
Please show me the way
'cause my future is sold today

My future is sold today
