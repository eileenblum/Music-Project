I don't need
I don't need no more pain
I will face
I will face my fear again
It's dragging me down
I can't take it all
Can't you hear my call

I can't see
I can't see reality
But I can feel my insanity
It's dragging me down
I can't take it all
Can't you hear my call

Let me die
Let me die as a hero
Let me die
Give me strength one more time
Let me die

Here I stand
Stand on holy ground
Serve my king
When kingdoms falling down
It's dragging me down
I can't take it all
Can't you hear my call

Let me die
Let me die as a hero
Let me die
Give me strength one more time
Let me die

With the coming dawn he is riding horseback through this wasted desert
Plain against the wind against the rain gazing at the unborn battlefield
Well prepared to stand up for a last bloody fight
In defiance of the invaders' tyranny
Giving his life for his nation - for his king
His face is warpainted with eyes wide open
Determined to stay with his bloodbrothers - 
Side by side til the very end his destiny may triumph
Or agony may victory or death
He raises his sword into the air willing to win
But also accepting to die to die as a hero
And then into the calm before the storm explodes a yell for freedom

Let me die
Let me die as a hero
Let me die
Give me strength one more time

Let me die
Let me die as a hero
Let me die
Give me strength one more time
Let me die
Let me die
Let me die
Let me die
Let me die
Let me die
