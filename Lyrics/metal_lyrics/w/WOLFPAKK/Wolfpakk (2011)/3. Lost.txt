Look at the crossed
The fight has been lost
Evil has taken its toll

No resurrection - from this infection
We're under demanded control

Dangerous specimen - ready to strike
Wait for the outbreak to come
Hunting their victims - into the deadzone
There's no way to hide - better run

Waiting for salvation
Praying for relief

Forever lost - thrown out of eden
We fade away - into the darkness
Forever lost - black sun is shining
No more light to face the day

No more survivors chaos supreme
Look - world gone to hell
If it's god's judgement
That mankind's erased
Who will be able to tell

After the doom - something is born
The creature was made in the lab
The more devastating - inventive it is
For us there's no turning back

Waiting for salvation
Praying for relief

Forever lost - thrown out of eden
We fade away - into the darkness
Forever lost - black sun is shining
No more light to face the day

If you find the antidote
Inject it into our veins
To stop this tale of woe

We all need the antidote
Cause time is running out
Devil's calling from below

We all need the antidote
Cause time is running out
Devil's calling from below

Forever lost - thrown out of eden
We fade away - into the darkness
Forever lost - black sun is shining
No more light to face the day
