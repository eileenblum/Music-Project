Soldier - what is your mission?
Soldier - what is your aim?
Out there youÂ´re undercover
No one knows your name

[REECE:]
Absurdity becomes your worst nightmare
An unsung hero just arrived

[VOSS:]
Somewhere beyond far away from home
ThereÂ´s no escape all alone

[SWEENEY:]
Caught in a catch 22
Rallying calls put me through

[VOSS:]
Wounded in this operation
ThereÂ´s no way it can be repealed
A no win situation
Soldier - how do you feel?
