[VOSS:]
I close my eyes, to feel your hands on me
I know itâs fine, lay down and make me feel

[SWEENEY:]
Yâcame back for more â to fulfill my fantasies
So be my whore - go down on your knees

[VOSS:]
Just sigh no more â set me free

[SWEENEY:]
Sock it to me [chorus] - I need your dirty deeds
Sock it to me [chorus] - common take the lead
Sock it to me [chorus] - Your slave IÂ´m gonna be
Sock it to me [chorus]
Love in the first, love in the first, love in the first degree
Sock it to me!

[STORACE:]
There ainât no other girl whoâs making love this way
Canât get enough I want you to stay
I know you like it too just get in your suit
I say letâs go â you diabolic fruit

[VOSS:]
Just sigh no more â set me free

[STORACE:]
Sock it to me [chorus] - I need your dirty deeds
Sock it to me [chorus] - common take the lead
Sock it to me [chorus] - Your slave IÂ´m gonna be
Sock it to me [chorus]
Love in the first, love in the first, love in the first degree

[SWEENEY:]
Sock â Sock it to me, Sock â Sock it to me, Sock â Sock it to me

[Solo: VOSS]

[STORACE:]
Sock it to me [chorus] - I need your dirty deeds
Sock it to me [chorus] - common take the lead
Sock it to me [chorus] - Your slave IÂ´m gonna be
Sock it to me [chorus]
Love in the first, love in the first, love in the first degree
Sock it to me!
