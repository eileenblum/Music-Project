[SWEENEY:]
Long, long time ago
They came from afar
Were they our saviors or foes?
Above, a flash in the dark
A blaze in the sky
Heavenâs on fire

[VOSS:]
Far away from home we fly we ride the sky and travel through time

[SCHOBER:]
Universe [chorus] - where the moonlight guides our ways
Universe [chorus] - dimensions to sail, into another place

[VOSS:]
Gaze, we gaze at the sun, we wonât rest
Until itâs done, now, weâre on our way
Weâll never turn back, the dawning of a new day

[SWEENEY:]
Far away from home we fly we ride the sky and travel through time

[SCHOBER:]
Universe [chorus]
Where the moonlight guides our ways
Universe [chorus]
Dimensions to sail, into another place
Universe [chorus]
Weightless we fly through space
Dimensions to sail, entering a new phase

[Solo: VOSS]

[SCHOBER:]
Universe [chorus]
Where the moonlight guides our ways
Universe [chorus]
Dimensions to sail, into another place
Universe [chorus]
Weightless we fly through space
Dimensions to sail, entering a new phase
Weâre lost in space

[SWEENEY:]
Where stars shining bright
Weâre lost in space
In another place
