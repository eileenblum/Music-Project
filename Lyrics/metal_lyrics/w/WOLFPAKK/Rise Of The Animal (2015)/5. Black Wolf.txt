[ALTZI:]
The spirit of the wolves, is alive in my heart
Running with them and let the hunt start
We are predators [chorus]

[VOSS:]
And we are in charge
Weâre free to live â to run â coming out of the dark

[SWEENEY:]
Heavy weather â lightning â thunderstorm
Against the wind and rain â we carry on

[ALTZI:]
Black Wolf - Strong and athletic
Black Wolf - Fast and aesthetic
Black Wolf - Silent and still
Black Wolf - Is crying from the hill

[VOSS:]
We crossing the fields and sniffing our track
I look to my mates weâre ready to attack
We are predators [chorus]

[ALTZI:]
With blood on our paws
Weâre free to live â to run â a natural law

[ALTZI:]
Heavy weather â lightning â thunderstorm
Against the wind and rain â we carry on

[SWEENEY:]
Black Wolf - Strong and athletic
Black Wolf - Fast and aesthetic

[ALTZI:]
Black Wolf - Silent and still
Black Wolf - Is crying from the hill

[Solo: VOSS]

[SWEENEY:]
Black Wolf - Strong and athletic
Black Wolf - Fast and aesthetic

[ALTZI:]
Black Wolf - Silent and still
Black Wolf - Is crying from the hill
