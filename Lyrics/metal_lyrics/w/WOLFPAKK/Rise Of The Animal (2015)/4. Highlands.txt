[VOSS:]
Waterfalls and silent lakes
Rushing torrents a land of fate
Shouts of freedom
His visionÂ´s alive
Crying for mercy - Wallace arise

[TURNER:]
Highlands - wake my clan
With sunrise bagpipes yell through the land
Highlands - faith and pride
Home of all - all the strong and the wild

[SWEENEY:]
Threat of rebellion armed for the blow
Unwelcome invaders shed their blood in the snow
Another misty morning way up in the hills
For Independence too many were killed

[TURNER:]
Highlands - wake my clan
With sunrise bagpipes yell thruâ the land
Highlands - faith and pride
Home of all - all the strong and the wild

[Solo: TORMÃ]

[TURNER:]
Highlands - wake my clan
With sunrise bagpipes yell thruâ the land
Highlands - faith and pride
Home of all - all the strong and the wild
