[DERIS:]
Red dawn, my heart is on fire
Red dawn, my eyes open wide
IÂ´m out for blood to stay alive
My strength, is taking me higher
My strength, is all my pride
A pale rider to survive

[SWEENEY:]
Iâm ready to kill
just for the prey, not for the thrill [chorus]

[SWEENEY:]
A scream of fearful agony
Rider of the storm [chorus]

[VOSS:]
Hunting for a repast
Wise, brave and strong [chorus]

[SWEENEY:]
Wild and proud
Barking at the moon [chorus]
Wayward and damned
Killed by mankindâs gun [chorus]

[VOSS:]
Will it end soon?

[SWEENEY:]
Sometimes, Iâm misunderstood
People say, I am a threat
My only crimeâs â the need to eat

[VOSS:]
Right now Iâm crossing the wood
Hear now the song of the dead
In front of me, a big chunk of meat

[DERIS:]
Iâm ready to kill
just for the prey, not for the thrill [chorus]
A scream of fearful agony
Rider of the storm [chorus]

[SWEENEY:]
Hunting for a repast
Wise, brave and strong [chorus]

[VOSS:]
Wild and proud
Barking at the moon [chorus]
Wayward and damned
Killed by mankindâs gun [chorus]

[SWEENEY:]
Will it end soon?

[Chorus by DERIS]
