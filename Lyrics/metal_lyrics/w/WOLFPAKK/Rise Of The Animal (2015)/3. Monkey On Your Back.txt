[VOSS:]
You can't get rid of it, so addicted to this shit
No matter what you do, you will never make it thruÂ´

[SWEENEY:]
DopamineÂ´s rushing thru your brain
Love getting high - feeling no more pain

[POLEY:]
You can't let go - You can't control
Regret, you got a monkey on your back
DonÂ´t get me wrong - but you ainÂ´t that strong
Too bad, you got a monkey on your back

[VOSS:]
Canât get rid of it â Canât get rid of it, yeah

[VOSS:]
Your pulse is racing fast, ArmageddonÂ´s here at last
The world just falls apart - exploding - kick start your heart

[SWEENEY:]
DopamineÂ´s rushing thru your brain
Love getting high - feeling no more pain

[POLEY:]
You can't let go - You can't control
Regret, you got a monkey on your back
DonÂ´t get me wrong - but you ainÂ´t that strong
Too bad, you got a monkey on your back
Monkey â Monkey [chorus]

[Solo: ROXIE]

[POLEY:]
You can't let go - You can't control
Regret, you got a monkey on your back
DonÂ´t get me wrong - but you ainÂ´t that strong
Too bad, you got a monkey on your back
