[VOSS:]
Monaco, Estoril, Petersburg and L.A.
Meet the man in Las Vegas
Playing Russian Roulette
He will never regret with all eyes on the table

[SWEENEY:]
Every night every day see him dance on the edge
Live it up to the limit
Make your bet itÂ´s your call itÂ´s too late
âRien ne va plusâ - itÂ´s all in it

[SWEENEY:]
High roller - YouÂ´re playing for keeps

[VOSS:]
High roller â Now youâre down on your knees
High roller, high roller, high roller

[VOSS:]
Itâs the moment of truth
Itâs your very last move, you shake and you shiver

[SWEENEY:]
With the hands on the gun ainÂ´t no place you could run
Pulling there trigger

[SWEENEY:]
High roller - YouÂ´re playing for keeps

[VOSS:]
High roller â Now youâre down on your knees
High roller, high roller, high roller

[Solo: RAUBER]

[Solo: VOSS]

[SWEENEY:]
High roller - YouÂ´re playing for keeps

[VOSS:]
High roller â Now youâre down on your knees

[SWEENEY:]
High roller - the stakes are high

[VOSS:]
High roller - you reach out for the sky
High roller, high roller, high roller
