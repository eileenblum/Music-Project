[VOSS:]
This is my warning, are you too blind
I am your prophet, follow my sign

[SWEENEY:]
I come from a time a 1000 light years away, when dragons and fire ruled the land
I fulfill my prophecy thereÂ´s danger close at hand

[KISKE:]
I can see into the future, human race is slowly fading, say your last farewell
I have a vague premonition that weÂ´re lost, itÂ´s the rise of the animal

[SWEENEY:]
Once you were masters, soon only slaves
Obey their orders, or dig your grave

[VOSS:]
I come from a time a 1000 light years away, when dragons and fire ruled the land
I fulfill my prophecy thereÂ´s danger close at hand

[KISKE:]
I can see into the future, human race is slowly fading, say your last farewell
I have a vague premonition that weÂ´re lost, itÂ´s the rise of the animal
