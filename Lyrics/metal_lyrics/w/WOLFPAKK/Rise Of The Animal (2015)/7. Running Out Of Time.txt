[VOSS:]
IÂ´ve seen warriors marching through TV
CNN and ABC spreading the disease

[SWEENEY:]
With their cheating faces making us believe
We need another war right now I know we come to grief

[VOSS:]
We played the fools
Now thereÂ´s no more rules

[DOKKEN:]
Every day we live in fear - we can feel the end is near
And when the goings getting tough - we are running out ofâ¦
See the writings on the wall - about the human fall
Touch the bottom line - we are running out of time

[SWEENEY:]
Heading for destruction without any given proof
Storytellers shining bright their tongues don't tell the truth

[VOSS:]
When words don't speak no wisdom just bringing out the beast
Innocent and clueless all hopeless in the east

[VOSS:]
We played the fools
Now thereÂ´s no more rules

[DOKKEN:]
Every day we live in fear - we can feel the end is near
And when the goings getting tough - we are running out ofâ¦
See the writings on the wall - about the human fall
Touch the bottom line - we are running out of time

[DOKKEN:]
IÂ´ve seen warriors marching through TV
CNN and ABC spreading the disease
With their cheating faces making us believe
We need another war right now I know we come to grief

[Solo: ALDRICH]

[DOKKEN:]

[Chorus]
