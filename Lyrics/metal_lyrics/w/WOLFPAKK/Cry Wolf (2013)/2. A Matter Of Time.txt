Another day another hurricane
Earth fights back with thunderstorms and rain
Ice caps melt pollution's everywhere
Talk is cheap but...Hey... Who really cares?

Caught in a nightmare of today

It's a matter of time
Before we lose it all
Your wake up call
Cause we crossed the line
Its matter of time
Mankind's to fall
Your final call
Can't you read the signs?

News make me shiver make me frown
The world is in a mess all upside down
No regret no shame and no remorse
Nature's closing down now all its doors

Caught in a nightmare of today

It's a matter of time
Before we lose it all
Your wake up call
Cause we crossed the line
It's matter of time
Mankind's to fall
Your final call
Can't you read the signs?
