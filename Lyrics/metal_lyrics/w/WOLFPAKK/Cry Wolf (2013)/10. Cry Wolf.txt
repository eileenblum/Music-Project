Old wolf is on the loose
Ain't got no time to choose
Mankind all live in fear
Come together everywhere

To blame an enemy
Invisible for me
Hiding behind the lies
Hear their battle cry

Who owns the right to say
Drive all other tribes away
Too weak to raise defense
But sure there will be revenge
Cry wolf, cry wolf, cry wolf, cry wolf

Too dumb to understand
Destroying holy land
Why savage hearts must die
Within their senseless cry?

Old wolf is on the loose
Ain't got no time to choose
Mankind all live in fear
Come together everywhere

Who owns the right to say
Drive all other tribes away
Too weak to raise defense
But sure there will be revenge
Cry wolf - hiding behind the lies - cry wolf
Cry wolf - hear their battle cry - cry wolf

Who owns the right to say
Drive all other tribes away
Too weak to raise defense
But sure there will be revenge
Who owns the right to say
Drive all other tribes away
Hear their battle cry

Who owns the right to say
Drive all other tribes away
Too weak to raise defense
But sure there will be revenge
Cry wolf - hiding behind the lies
Cry wolf - hear their battle cry
