Dark is the forest
Cruel is your soul
Slowly you bring on the beast
The lady is evil
A dangerous kind
Waiting to open the feast

I'm trapped here right under your spell
We dance in the twilight
It's time now for wishing you well
My heaven is hell

Moonlite - affecting your brain
The call of the wild from deep down inside
Driving you insane
Moonlite - possession and pain
Without any rules
For lovers and fools
You're lost in the game

Hear my advice
This unholy life
Ends up with a scream
Until day light
You will survive
I push you back in my dreams

I'm trapped here right under your spell
We dance in the twilight
It's time now for wishing u well
My heaven is hell

Moonlite - affecting your brain
The call of the wild from deep down inside
Driving you insane
Moonlite - possession and pain
Without any rules
For lovers and fools
You're lost in the game

You wanna play you want me to stay
Don't you tempt your fate
I'm not that weak get u lunatic freak out my way

Moonlite - affecting your brain
The call of the wild from deep down inside
Driving you insane
Moonlite - possession and pain
Without any rules
For lovers and fools
You're lost in the game
Moonlite - affecting your brain
The call of the wild from deep down inside
Driving you insane
