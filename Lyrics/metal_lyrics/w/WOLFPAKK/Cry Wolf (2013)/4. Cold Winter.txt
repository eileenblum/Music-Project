It's freezing cold-we need hideaway
The hollow cave is not that far from here
We have been there for so many times
Give me shelter-ease my fear

Our braveness will help us on the way
Strong hearts - until the end of day

Can we survive
Just another winter
It's cold out there
Sun's been away too long
We're suffering from
Another long cold winter
With the pakk
We are moving on

We were born under the moonlight
It will always guide us home
The sky is grey a surreal landscape
Persistent snowfall birds are gone

Our braveness will help us on the way
Strong hearts - until the end of day

Can we survive
Just another winter
It's cold out there
Sun's been away too long

We're suffering from
Another long cold winter
With the pakk
We are moving on

Winter freeze
Hiding from the wind
Hold together
Waiting for the spring

Can we survive
Just another winter
It's cold out there
Sun's been away too long

We're suffering from
Another long cold winter
With the pakk
We are moving on

Can we survive
Just another winter
It's cold out there
Sun's been away too long
We're suffering from
Another lonely winter
With the pakk
We are moving on
