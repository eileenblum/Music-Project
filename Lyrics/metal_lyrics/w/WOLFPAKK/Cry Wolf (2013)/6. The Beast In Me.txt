Midnight is close at hand
Church bells strike - it's my time
Something got me paralyzed
Visions in my mind

Following the call of evil
Spinning in my cells
Torn apart in thousand pieces
Going down to hell

My misfortune waits for me
Contamination and abomination
Driving me insane

Someone kill the beast in me
Crucified by desire
What's my destiny
Someone kill the beast in me
I was baptized by fire
Until you set me free

Who I am I cannot tell
Blood is on my hands
Should have never dealt with badness
Lucifer's no friend

My misfortune waits for me
Contamination and abomination
Driving me insane

Someone kill the beast in me
Crucified by desire
What's my destiny
Someone kill the beast in me
I was baptized by fire
Until you set me free

In the mirror I see a stranger
When Jekyll turns to Hyde

Someone kill the beast in me
Crucified by desire
What's my destiny
Someone kill the beast in me
I was baptized by fire
Until you set me free
