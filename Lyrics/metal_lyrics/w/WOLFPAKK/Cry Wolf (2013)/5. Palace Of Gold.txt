You were born in this town I still remember
And you knew this was your place to stay
Lost all the keys so surrender
For blind ambition you have to pay

You walk down the borderline
Lonely is your soul when you're imprisoned

In the palace of gold
Forever and always
You are locked in this cage
You can't really enfold
In this palace of gold

No glamour no more just dirty money
Somehow someway trying to survive
Escape out of the zoo hey honey
Wishing back a simple life

You walk down the borderline
Lonely is your soul when you're imprisoned

In the palace of gold
Forever and always
You are locked in this cage
You can't really enfold
In this palace of gold

You walk down the borderline
Lonely is your soul when you're imprisoned

In the palace of gold
Forever and always
You are locked in this cage
You can't really enfold
In this palace of gold
