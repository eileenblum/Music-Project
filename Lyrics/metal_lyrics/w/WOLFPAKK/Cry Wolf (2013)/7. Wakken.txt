80.000 pilgrims bound to explode
An annual ritual welcome the show
A village on fire so Wacken keep it true
All that we need is you you and you

Can't you feel it's time for breaking out
Bang your head shout it out loud

Metal is life metal is soul
Fight for your right cause metal's the law
Tear down these wall holding you back
Metal attack, metal attack, metal attack

A pocket full of irons
Cocked and loaded
Signed sealed delivered
And ready to show it

Can't you feel it's time for breaking out
Bang your head shout it out loud

Metal is life metal is soul
Fight for your right cause metal's the law
Tear down these wall holding you back

Metal attack, metal attack, metal attack

Metal attack, metal attack
Metal attack, metal attack

Metal is life metal is soul
Fight for your right cause metal's the law
Tear down these wall holding you back
Metal attack, metal attack, metal attack
Metal attack, metal attack
