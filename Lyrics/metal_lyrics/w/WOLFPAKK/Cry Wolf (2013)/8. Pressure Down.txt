Getting ready
Getting ready for the role play
I got my money
For the labour of love I pay

Hell or high water
A sinner or a saint
Hell or high water
I faint

Put the pressure down
Put the pressure down

I don't wanna be your slave no more
Put the pressure down
Put the pressure down
I don t wanna kneel down on the floor

Now it's finished
I feel like being crucified
So mean and dirty
And again I got no alibi

Hell or high water
I shiver and I shake
Hell or high water
Ahhhhh... ahhhhh...

Put the pressure down
Put the pressure down

I don't wanna re your slave no more
Put the pressure down
Put the pressure down
I don't wanna kneel down on the floor

Put the pressure down
Put the pressure down

I don't wanna re your slave no more
Put the pressure down
Put the pressure down
I don't wanna kneel down on the floor

Put the pressure down
Put the pressure down
Put the pressure down

You think so!?
