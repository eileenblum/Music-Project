[originally by Rainbow]In the light of the day
You can hear the old one say
Was the sound last night the wind
Can you feel the change begin

By the fall of the snow
A single soul will go
The footsteps on the white
There's an unholy light

There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go
To run with the wolf

When the world makes a turn
The eyes of one will learn
That the sound just like the wind
Only makes the change begin

By the end of the rain
The feelings passed again
And things that snapped and bited
Unholy light

There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go
To run with the wolf

There's a break in the ground
Like the swirling water's angry as they pull you down

When the siren calls you go, yeah
To run with the wolf
Run with the wolf

There's a hole in the sky
Something evil is passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go, yeah
To run with the wolf
Run with the wolf

Like a beast in a field
You know just it pays in steel
You run with the wolf, oh oooh

Run with the wolf

See the break, you know it's the same
Now we go
To run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Run, run, run
Now we go run, run, run, run
Run with the wolf
All right
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
