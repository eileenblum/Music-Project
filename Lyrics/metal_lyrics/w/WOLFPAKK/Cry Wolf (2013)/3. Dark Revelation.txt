She got something special
Chills me to the bone
Supernatural power
But a heart of stone

When she's coming round
You'd better stay awake
She moves without a sound
Or can you hear a rustling?

Dark revelation
Hear the voices say
Dark revelation
Coming down your way
Dark revelation
Open up your eyes
Dark revelation
Such a higher might

A fire raging through her skull
When she's blinded by light
A descendant of the devil
From the other side
