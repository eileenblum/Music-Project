Alison saw them riding along the skyline of fire
Like harbingers of infernal ire
A blitz of decadence into the dormant world
Seraphs seared falling into the murk

Out of the welkins boreal
Devastation to bring
The blight of stability
With blazing ardour
Smiting the serene
The left hand of eternity

Alison kept on ogling the pompous sight
The flame of her reverie ultimately to ignite
To come was the checkmate of her foes
Her rightful place on the right side of the throne

Her summonings evoked the brothers in evil
Had the singular form been false
In the exegeses about the coming of the Antichrist?
