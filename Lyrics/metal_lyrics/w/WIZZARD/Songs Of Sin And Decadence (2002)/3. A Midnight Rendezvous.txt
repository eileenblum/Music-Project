Once I had a dream
That inexorably
Returned to me night by night
Leading me to an ancient fantasy

I sensed the warmth of the subtropical air
Once I had risen out of the dreamworld abyss
The heat of the sultry night was adorned
By the gentle curve of her hips

Midnight - when moonlight and shadows danced
I met this dream from my dream
Midnight - under taciturn stars
I was under the spell of her beauty

I handed her a black rose
As a symbol of an everlasting commitment
Its thorns gently pierced her soft skin
Embellishing the sand with a sombre ornament

Holding her hand I broke the silence and said
No love could last forever even in a dream
Down from the cliff we were standing on she fell
A rain of red rose petals sealed her faith for
eternity

Midnight - when moonlight and shadows danced
I bid farewell to this dream from my dream
Midnight - under taciturn stars
Forever only mine... her beauty

The moonlit minarets they stood still
Watching me disappearing in the desert horizon
...her memory haunting in eerie winds
