Nobody knew what had engendered
The phenomenon around the 11-year old
The sudden appearance of a poltergeist
It began with sweets and flowers
And went on with hurled around stones
Waking up with her clothes on fire

The fires of Hell were glowing
Waiting for her soul

She could never walk away
Wherever she would go
She would never be left alone
The mass of futile prayers
Paved her way to the down below
Alluring poison the seal of her soul

The holy spirit proved to be helpless
Against the power of Hell
The prayers only enhanced her torment
A circle of seance was formed
To break through the evil spell
By whom was the curse sent?

"The depravity and evil... The misery and pain...
You have to pay for the sins of your past life"

[Based on the story of Maria Jose Ferreira, December 1965/1966]
