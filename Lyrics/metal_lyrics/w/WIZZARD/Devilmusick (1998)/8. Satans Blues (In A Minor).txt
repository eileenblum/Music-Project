When I didn't wake up this morning
I took a step down to Hell
Left the shell of my earthly existence
In his kingdom forever to dwell

Where the winds breathe ice cold
Where the volcanoes howl the tunes of doom
Satan's Blues

Oh my baby had left me
Passed away long ago
Travelled down to the shores where fires
Burn forever lost lonely souls
