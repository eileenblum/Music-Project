Rats in my head,
A plague. A disease,
scratching away discontent is bleeding.
Staring at the roof watching time pass by
as my sinking thoughts flood the middle night.

Bleeding eyes of a sleepless night,
watching sand sift slowly by.
Bleeding eyes of a sleepless night,
beaten by the midnight fight.

Time decays, and rots away.

When the lights go out the ghosts come out to play.
I've been thinking, drowning, sinking inside My mind.
Day Light's creeping up on me so I say goodbye to a good nights sleep again.
Another night alone.

I've got rats in my head,
A plague. A disease,
scratching away discontent is bleeding.
Staring at the roof watching time pass by
as my sinking thoughts flood the middle night.

Time decays, and rots away.

Eyes wide, the silence feeds my mind.
The silence has broken. The ghosts have woken.
Theres no peace in sleep if all nightmares are dreams.

So much for the good night sleep that I've been bid tonight.
