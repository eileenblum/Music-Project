What does it take to survive?
I'm looking at my life through the Devils eyes.
And he's ready to take me.
Take what ever is left and recreate me.
A new man made from stone.
I've given all the warmth from my heart and now it's gone cold.
I've given all the warmth from my heart and now it's stone cold.

Stone cold I cant feel anything.
Stone cold I cant feel anymore.

All hope is dead,
I tried and I tried and now there is nothing left.
Turned to the dark-side.
Cause it's the only place where I feel alive.
The bitter taste of stone.
I've given all the warmth from my heart and now it's gone cold.
I've given all the warmth from my heart and now it's stone cold.

Stone cold, I cant feel anything.
Stone cold, I cant feel anymore.

Im growing cold, the beating is freezing in my chest.

I've been sinking.
This is rock bottom.
I was once told.
This is a cold world...
