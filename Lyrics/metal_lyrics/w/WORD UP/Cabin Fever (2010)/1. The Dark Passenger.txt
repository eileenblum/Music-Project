I've been tied by a chain to dead weight
The past will never let me go.
I've been trying to let go for so long now
set fire to all my ghosts.
Scars open wide, empty inside,
hollowed out by pain. Theres secrets that I've kept hidden away. 

All the ghost's I've bottled up inside are haunting my mind.
All the ghost's I've bottled up inside are secrets that I left behind.

All of the pain accumulates
snowballs into a fuel of hate.
The mask that I wear is slowly slipping.
and its beginning to reveal everything I've hidden. 

Tonight the dark-side rides, and the monster inside no longer hides.

All the ghost's I've bottled up inside are haunting my mind.
All the ghost's I've bottled up inside are secrets that I left behind.
