Summer is here.
These are the best days of our lives.
Hanging out with all my friends.
The best of memories.

Jonson Street on a Friday night.
Possum Creek, summer lovin, Jumping off the bridge.
Surfing, skating, hanging out.
The best of memories.

This is the place I call home.
This is where my heart belongs.
You wont take this away from me
This is all that I have.

Time flies when you're having fun.
Another year of summer love.
When we move on and all grow up.
We'll remember and always know 

Home is where the hearts is.
The best of memories.
Home is where the hearts is.
The best days of our lives.

home is where the hearts is!
