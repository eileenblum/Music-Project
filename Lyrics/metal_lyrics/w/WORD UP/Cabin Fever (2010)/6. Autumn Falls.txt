Here in Paradise, Autumn Falls and nothing dies.
There's something in the air.
Cause every breath I take, I close my eyes and it takes me away.
Fresh air percolates and pain longer floods my veins. 
On the inside I find peace, like the silence of falling leaves.

Hold this moment.
Take a breath, Breath it in.
Hold this moment.
A bit of peace, some clarity.
Cause I've been drowning in the shallow water.
I just can't seem to find my feet.

If heavens paradise then Im already dead.
Let the waves wash away all of whats left.
Blue sky's open wide. I drown inside my mind.
