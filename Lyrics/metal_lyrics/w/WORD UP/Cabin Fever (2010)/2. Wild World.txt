We've made it all these years.
But we've lost friends along the way. 
Nothing can replace this empty space.
We know we've got each other
and we know there's no "forever"
The skies our limit and we will push it
if we ever reach the top.

So here to all the years of laughter, pain and tears.
To the ones we lost along the way.
We all know that in the end .
Everything will be ok.
So here to all the years of laughter, pain and tears.
To the ones we lost along the way.

Everything will be ok.
