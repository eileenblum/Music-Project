This is the feeling of lost.
No answers. No meaning.
I'm still searching for the feel of completion
There's no feeling like lost.
I love it, I need it,
Like there's something more to live or to die for.
I follow the horizon.

Where is home when your feeling soulless?
Where is home when you have no direction?

This is the feeling of lost.
I love it. I need it.
I'm still searching for feel of completion
Waiting is wasting, there's places to be.
Waiting is wasting for people like me.
I have never felt so far from home.

Where is home when your feeling soulless?
Where is home when you have no direction?

Waiting is wasting for people like me.
