I need some time alone inside my head.
I've got to dig through all these vines and make some sense of this mess.
I can feel the rage like a lion in a cage. I'm about to break and this worlds about to shake.
Give me room to breathe I'm suffocating.
It feels like all the walls are closing in on me.
I can't escape.

I can feel it building inside me. Something that I fear, that I can no longer hide.
The bottle's breaking. I feel it coming to life.
There something that I've buried deep down inside.   

Deep down inside of Me.
