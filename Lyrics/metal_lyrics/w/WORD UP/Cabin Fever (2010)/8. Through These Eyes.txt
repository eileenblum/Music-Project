See through these eyes.
Faces change a millions times.
Like rats they come and go.
And their teeth are sinking deeper Into the skin
tearing holes in this place I've called my home.
Where I can let go of everything inside.

Through these eyes.
This is the only place where I forget everything.
Through these eyes.
This is the only place where I can lose my mind.

I'm holding on,
This is all I've got. 
Everything else lays in pieces.
This is all I've got.
I've got no other place to break this cage.

Break this cage!

This is the only place I feel alive.
