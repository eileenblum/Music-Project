So we say goodbye
and let the doves fly home.
We remember all the memories,
anything, just to feel your love again.
Cause there's no colour in this world.
There's no colour with out you.
So we say goodbye.
So we, So we say goodbye.

And You wont be left behind. Your heart carries on in our minds.
The times that we had we'll hold close and we'll always remember.

Nothing is going to change, I still think of you every second of the day.
And I can still see your face, it flashes through my mind every time I close my eyes.

So we say goodbye and let the doves fly home.

So this is pain. Don't say you'll never feel again.
Some times we hate the world for all the wrong reasons.
But this is life, and sometimes life will bring us down.
Just remember ill be there for you, I know you'll be there for me.

Nothings going to change, I still think of you every second of the day.
I can still see your face, it flashes through my mind every time I close my eyes.
