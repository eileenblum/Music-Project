Doomed to an after life of pain
Seeing your life start to drain
Can not deny the reasons that you are here
Now your horrid death is clear

Enclosed in a casket-Reeking stench of death
Entombed by darkness-Your body is slowly decaying
By the powers of Satan-Summoned up to take away
Your rotting soul lives-Resurrected

Deceased for a short period of time
Laying fertile discharging slime
Body entombed apparition's curse
Now your soul has dispersed

I bestow upon you, you must
Grant me my wish, I can not
Linger on much longer, you must
Resurrect me......For the after life of pain

Among the dead I bleed every ounce of blood
Wanting resurrection and all evil damnation
Relieving from my carcass is a dismal soul
The unholy quest begins for immortality

Resurrected from my grave
From my body, my soul's escaped
Infernal void of putrid hate
Upon the exhumed I defecate

Resurrected from my grave
From my body my soul's escaped
Granted the first power of immortality
Reborn through the dismal fog
