Feel the torment of brutal bestial torture
Drinking the blood of self inflicted wounds
Dislocating limbs for the flawless rush of pain
Horrified screams to some it's only dreams

Excruciating pain upheaval of vomit
Excruciating pain
Excruciating pain disemboweling stomach
Excruciating pain

Your eyeballs removed ultimate fucking pain
Impaled upon iron hooks sunken sockets bleed
Choking on your mangled tongue
You can hardly breathe
Reaching deep inside your throat cutting it free

Excruciating pain upheaval of vomit
Excruciating pain
Excruciating pain disemboweling stomach
Excruciating pain

Coming so close to your obliteration
Coughing up blood on your chest
Violently heaving for a last breath
Mutilating yourself to death

Carving up your flesh
Watching open wounds bleed
Carving up your flesh
Another blackened gash bleeds

Carnage through butchery
The loss of all feeling
Carnage through butchery
No remorse no feeling

Feel your heartbeat coming to a close
Ripping your flesh down through your chest
Rabidly stabbing through your heart
Mutilating yourself to death
