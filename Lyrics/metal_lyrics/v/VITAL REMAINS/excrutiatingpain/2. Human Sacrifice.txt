Taken to death from sacrifice
Carving out your eyes they bleed
Vital parts is what thy crave

Cease of life a human sacrifice
Lying wastefully in the blood
Organs pulled out from inside
The remaining butchered torsos lie

Encircling the pentagram
Cauldrans burning human flesh
Participants enter the circle
In search of Satan's plague
Indulging in sex festering on flesh
A human sacrifice

Summoned up from the burning abyss
Lucifer laughs in demise
Your soul it fries in the pit of Hell
Martyr of the master Satan

Wicked spirits enchant the air
Robbing souls creating fear

Carcasses lying all over the ground
Dismembered cavities spilling chyme
Internal bleeding mixing with slime
Encrusted mangled flesh slowly rots
