Welcome to the Northern regions..... Black hearted emperor
Intensify the pagan night..... Black hearted emperor
High upon the angel's mountain..... Black hearted emperor
Overshadowed by the moon.....The crown of the black hearts

Urine is poured over leaves
Purified in Gabriel's chalice
Gazed into the eyes of the king
See the Heavens sky in malice
Awakening strength of one million warriors
Raising their swords to overthrow the pure

Destruction of your hero's kingdom, the walls begin to fall
The swords of pandemonium, a millenium of bloodshed

Condemned to the impure air, blood running black
Victory clouds form, can you smell the sulphur?

Recurrent waves of sorrow abolished by the sword
Mourning soon ceased not one stands alive
Death to the golden age hoards glorifying the moon
Destructive storms and evil winds
Evil spirits - evil demons - evil god - evil fiend!!!

This is our place!
This is our land!
Gods of the night take my hand!
