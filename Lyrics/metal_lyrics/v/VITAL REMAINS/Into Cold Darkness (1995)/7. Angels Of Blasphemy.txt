Baphomet the goat of a thousand young
Horns thrusting upward in moral defiance
Leviathan the holy trinity denied
Perpetual of our noble Satan

I, the redeemer withstand my assurance
To gracefully open the seventh gate

Ringing the goat's head bell, purifying the air
In nomine dei nostri satanas Lucifer
Abbadon, Asmosdeous Astaroth, Baphomet
Beelzebub, Behemoth Beherit, Hecate

Wash our hands of impurities
Drink the blood from the skulls of our enemies
Topple the throne of the mortal fool
What has God done for you?

Blasphemy of the righteous church
Celebrate in darkness
The darkness offers confined healing
Find yourself before it's too late

Drink from my chalice the elixir of life
Reaching out to the four cardinal points
Satan, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan

Trapped behind the false moral confines of Christianity
Your self-destructive belief system is a festering cancer
It should have become extinct along time ago

Angels of blasphemy oppreser of truth
Angels of blasphemy oppreser of life
