Under the moon, black winds blow
Onto the sands, warriors have died
To the most Northern forest mountain
Our victory is ours, under the moon's fog

Gods of death warriors of the desert
Fever witch spectre of fire
Commanded by Marduk magician of the gods

No coven shall be broken, hear my words
Step foot on our land, awakes the gods of war
Offering battle, under the moon's fog

Screaming into the winds..... Victory!
Gods of thunder win..... Victory!
Thrusting mighty swords..... Victory!
Sacrifice of blood..... Victory!

Conquering worlds between two worlds
Those armies of the Northern chill
Light the land of wisdom
I am one
Wielding my double headed axe
Under the moon's fog

Hail victory!!
Gods of war reign!!
