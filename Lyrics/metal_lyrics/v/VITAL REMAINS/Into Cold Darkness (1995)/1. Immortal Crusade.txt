I am the bornless one, showing you my face
Look at me eye to eye, come into my hand of evil
Behold, you're in the presence of Satan; king of Hell 
And if you are weak now you will die!

Summon the demons-Straight forth from Hell
Conjuring devils-With forbidden spells
Capturing your soul-Controlling your mind 
Pray to your God-He will never be

Behold the doctrine of slaves 
Crown of the temples, brightness of Heaven 
Your fabled book of lies, we must burn these bounded pages 
Impale the opus of shit, now venture into the black 
And open the gates to Hell, cast up Lucifer and his unholy blessing
Now swear the oath of Satan! 

Harlots singing praises among the flames from the South 
Riding the mighty whirlwinds from the East 
The mighty throne growls thunder from the North 
Lanterns of sorrow from the West..... Ave Satanas

Wings of thorns, seal of false honour 
Wrath of sin, die lord of righteousness 

Defeat the priests of lies within the pentagram of fire 
Accept the words of Hell the seven trumpets of desire 
Battle cry, destructon, mission of hatred 
Savage souls of Satan pound one thousand years
Born of the moonlight a worldwide crusade 
Battle cry, destruction, mission of hatred 

Ave Satanas
