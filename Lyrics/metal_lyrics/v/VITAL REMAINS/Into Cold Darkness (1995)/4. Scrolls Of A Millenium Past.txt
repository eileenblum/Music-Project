Arose from the second triangle burning my soul
Gehenna is the place for burning, takes me away
Order of the golden dawn summoning Beelzebub
Give your eternal loyalty demon of death and evil

God is dead and always has been
Be your god and devoutly worship yourself
To thee we confess..... Shut up and hold your tongue
Justify your beliefs and forsee reality

I am the personification of cosmic force
And the creator of all living things
Even the gods bow at my feet
To lick the blood from my sword

Book of revelations I forsee the fallen angels rise
To destroy the ministers of god
Strong as a lion in the moon of the woods
Great beast come, gods withdraw obey your master!

Glory and praise to you Satan
In the heights of Heaven where you once reigned
In the depths of Hell where you dream in silence
Sound the trumpets into the crimson sky
I am awake! I am awake! I am awake!

Scrolls of a millennium past unfold
In the blackness of the moonlight
Condemn Christianity forever
Embrace the wisdom of Lucifer!

Burning churches to the ground
Unearthly desolation, all is black
Crackling flames wither away
Bones stand tombless, as their flesh
All remains covered by dust
Funeral piles, the war must go on

Hoofs of steel rape the ear
Everlasting over the hills
White light legions in mortal fear
Cast into the fire weakness absorbs the flames
