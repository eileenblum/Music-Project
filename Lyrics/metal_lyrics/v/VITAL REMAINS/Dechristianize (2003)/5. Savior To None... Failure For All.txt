Malignant seed... Flourish within
Awake and breate...The scourge of blasphemy
Engulfed in frenzy...True hate ignited
Ablaze...Our world is born from the ashes of heaven

Destroy the words of the almighty
Burn the pages of the gospel
Now I've seen the truth in my own
His words are not my own

Coward...Would be his name
Weak... Would be his frame
His followers shall be the same
Mock the god-loving whore

Upon the shores of eternal peace
The bloodwar crushes your sactity
The bloodshed shall never cease

Your lord...Jesus Christ
Your lord...Born of sin
Your lord...The veil of hope
God's will... so shall you suffer divine

Upon the shores of eternal peace
The bloodwar crushes your sactity
The bloodshed shall never cease

Your lord...Jesus Christ
Your lord...Born of sin
Your lord...The veil of hope
God's will... so shall you suffer divine

Savior To None... Failure For All
Savior To None... Failure For All
Savior To None... Failure For All
Savior To None... Failure For All

His flesh upon the oak
Nailed and soiled with shit
To worship such fraility
Is the mirror of yourself
Us amongst the sheep
As sheep you are
Wander to the pyres we've prepared

Malignant seed... Flourish within
Awake and breate...The scourge of blasphemy
Engulfed in frenzy...True hate ignited
Ablaze...

Serenade your children to sleep
For they are now dying before you
Realize the truth as you begin to burn
Your lord...Jesus Christ
Saviour to none...Failure for all

Coward...Would be his name
Weak... Would be his frame
His followers shall be the same
Mock the god-loving whore

Destroy the words of the almighty
Burn the pages of the gospel
Now I've seen the truth in my own
His words are not my own

Your lord...Jesus Christ
Your lord...Born of sin
Your lord...The veil of hope
God's will... so shall you suffer divine
Your lord...Jesus Christ
Your lord...Born of sin
Your lord...The veil of hope
God's will... so shall you suffer divine

His flesh upon the oak
Nailed and soiled with shit
To worship such fraility
Is the mirror of yourself
Us amongst the sheep
As sheep you are
Wander to the pyres we've prepared
Burn...
