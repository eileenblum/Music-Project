This weapon of steel and ivory
Proudly rapes your flesh and bone
Vanquished and conquered
As the blood of my enemies will show

Now the myths of your savior now lingers
Over the breath of the dying
As you depard from life
Wonder why your prayers have been ignored

So suddenly has the god's light failed
Draped by Hell's infernal storm
Is now obscured by the lust of vengeance
Declaration of war

As you arrive your death
Glimpse the conquered before your fading eyes
Gone forever
Your kingdom burns

So suddenly has god's light faded
Draped by Hell's infernal storm
Is now obscured by the lust of vengeance
Declaration of war

Wait until the flag of victory is draped upon the cross
Their churches sound the knell
With all your hatred upon his ground
To never bow down...Unleash Hell...Unleash Hell...Unleash Hell

Aeons will this battle be remembered
Your holy scriptures of salvation
Has revealed the truth

So suddenly has god's light faded
Draped by Hell's infernal storm

Is now obscured by the lust of vengeance
Declaration of war
The words of god were written by man
Words to enslave the carnal beast within

So suddenly has god's light faded
Draped by Hell's infernal storm
Is now obscured by the lust of vengeance
Declaration of war

"Thus brings forth the revelation of the apocalypse...what man has made...we will destroy"

To the almighty of this godless land
For our brothers who bled upon the earth
To the warriors of the bloodwar who stand triumphant
The raised fist of domination...our final act of hate
Hail to us...to blasphemy

Unleash Hell...Unleash Hell...Unleash Hell
