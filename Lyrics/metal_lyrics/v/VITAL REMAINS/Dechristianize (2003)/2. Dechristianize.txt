Trembling to its fall
Putting and end to it all
By storm, by force
With might... without remorse
We are here to conquer this world

Like cancer... our hate consumes the light of elysium
Unstoppable force of demonic supremacy
All destroying...all devouring
Heaven now ravaged... scarred and empty

Strike the death knell of the pandemonium
Imbrue one's hands in the blood of christ
Washing away all filth of righteousness
The dimming of the light
Engulfing the trinity

He raped...the culture of mankind
He raped...the pride of the ancient ways
He raped...all thought of freewill
I who will watch you fall into obscurity

Washing away all filth of righteousness
The dimming of the light
Engulfing the fucking trinity

I spit upon your deity
Supposed creator of all things
Idol of irreverence you worship above
Show your true face... the image of prevarication

Unhallowed be our twilight
Thy grace untriumphant
Mourn the crowning of unconquerable profanation
Hell's grim tyrant...the eldest of night and chaos
Breathe once again...far from the shadow of god
This day of reckoning will be unavenged
Glory of wrathful inignation
I deny god and all religion
Turn up the whites of their eyes... Dechristianize
Our poisonous truths
Divinity...drowning in impurity
Unconquerble...unstoppable
Sanguilent in your agony

Like cancer... our hate consumes the light of elysium
Unstoppable force of demonic supremacy
All destroying...all devouring
Heaven now ravaged... scarred and empty

Strike the death knell of the pandemonium
Imbrue one's hands in the blood of christ
Washing away all filth of righteousness
The dimming of the light
Engulfing the trinity

He raped...the culture of mankind
He raped...the pride of the ancient ways
He raped...all thought of freewill
I who will watch you fall into obscurity

Washing away all filth of righteousness
The dimming of the light
Engulfing the fucking trinity
Dechristianize...Dechristianize...Dechristianize...Dechristianize...
Hell's grim tyrant...the eldest of night and chaos
Breathe once again...far from the shadow of god
This day of reckoning will be unavenged
Glory of wrathful inignation
I deny god and all religion
Turn up the whites of their eyes... Dechristianize...
Dechristianize
