Come forth to defile the uncreated
Watching the path of ash and flame...Elysium devoured
Seraphim laughing at the sigh of your suffering
Consuming the meaning of his name

Deafame him... defile god's blessings
Rusting prayers still wait for completion

Taint the vision of purity...heaven ravaged
A revelation of impurity has awakened
Your inner being withers from a lifetime of devotion
Never to hear the endless cries of the faithful
The veil of lies is lifted from their blinded eyes

Ceaselessly devoured Elysium
Your truth was torn from the womb of mary
The word of god slowly dies

As dusk reveals the reamins of the kingdom
The structures of faith collapses before you
Use his name in vain again and again
My flesh and blood will never be yours
God, you fucking whore
Worship your god and pray unto him
For his love is masked by the stench of decay
Your death is what he needs...the blood of the righteous
We will celebrate, as you will go
One by one...One by one...One by one... to meet your bastard maker
Worship your god and pray unto him
For his love is masked by the stench of decay
You prey upon the dead and dying,
of those who blindly followed there
The veil of lies is lifted from their blinded eyes

Ceaselessly devoured Elysium
Your truth was torn from the womb of mary
The word of god slowly dies

Taint the vision of purity...heaven ravaged
A revleation of impurity has awakened
Use his name in vain again and again
My flesh and blood will never be yours

Celebrate the annihilation of the christian
His words will never have meaning to me
Rejoice the upheaval of the carnal beast
Your sacticty of paradise now devoid

The veil of lies is lifted from their blinded eyes
Ceaselessly devoured Elysium
Your truth was torn from the womb of mary
The word of god slowly dies
God, you fucking whore
Worship your god and pray unto him
For his love is masked by the stench of decay
Your death is what he needs...the blood of the righteous
We will celebrate, as you will go
One by one...One by one...One by one... to meet your bastard maker
Worship your god and pray unto him
His love is masked by the stench of decay... Devoured Elysium
