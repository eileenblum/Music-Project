The sun descends into the blackening horizon
We shall wait and chant until our hearts bleed hatred
Vision the bloodstream
Upon the one you adore

Darken the light of the dying
Erase the thought of salvation
In Hell is where you are
The war has been upon you all

Beneath my flesh...Flows the blood of wisdom
Within my heart...The hunger for conquest
This silent legion...Birth of a new revelation
The day has come...When god's land shall burn
You shall burn
[repeat]

Insacred vision...The horrific truth revealed
For those who sought...Impurity has taken
No light shall shine for thee...The flock of mockery
At the end of all life
Never to praise the worm...Maggot of the holy
Scourge of all life...Ravager of the weak
Blood is no worth...To those who shall reap
End their time of peace...End their fucking time of peace now
[repeat]

At war with god
The coming of eternal war
Prepare for the end of your divine image
Swarming the faithful
Crushing the unity of all that is holy

Draped by the flames...Has now become your flesh
The purity of pain...Your yearning for pleasure
Shedding the skin of lies
Rejoice in our impure desires

Trumpets sound the eulogy
Now your king befalls
Falling is the shadow
The cross of your lord
....To the ground on which we've pissed upon

Insacred vision...The horrific truth revealed
For those who sought...Impurity has taken
No light shall shine for thee...The flock of mockery
At the end of all life
Never to praise the worm...Maggot of the holy
Scourge of all life...Ravager of the weak
Blood is no worth...To those who shall reap
End their time of peace...End their fucking time of peace now
[repeat]

At war with god
The coming of eternal war
Prepare for the end of your divine image
Swarming the faithful
Crushing the unity of all that is holy
The coming of eternal war
Prepare for the end of your divine image
Swarming the faithful
Appear to me...The enemy

Beneath my flesh...Flows the blood of wisdom
Within my heart...The hunger for conquest
This silent legion...Birth of a new revelation
Watching as your kingdom falls...At war with god
