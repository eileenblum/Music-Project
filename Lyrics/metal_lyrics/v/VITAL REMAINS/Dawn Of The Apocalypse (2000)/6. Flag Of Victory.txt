Buried beneath the centuries,
memories of horrific prophecies, the word of god forced upon the weak
Acceptance, blinded they will be
Silent, the flesh withers away
Ra-Hoor-Khuit! cleanse us thy kingdom, defy this by fire and blood
My sanctum, this majesty of sin
These structures of malevolance inherit my darkened spirit
Storm the gates, spiral portal descends
I quicken with the burning of barren relics
Excoriate the myth, slaughter of their precious lamb
all is fading from the Osiris strain
Vengeance, our fucking vengeance
Christ, you are crucified once again
Now inverted, my dream unfolds
All has faded from the Osiris strain
The storm bleeds the frail light,
Above, beneath, all that lay beyond the heavens
Your beloved fixture of flesh and oak ingest the
silhouettes from below
Growing blacker... blacker... blacker.... blacker
Ebony is the colour of our salvation
Vengeance, our fucking vengeance
Christ, you are crucified once again
Now inverted, my dream unfolds
Tear down the walls of gold...
