In no human brain can sufficient space be
found for the rentless logic of hard fact
until all pre-existance delusions
have been finally annhilated,
half measures are not of no avail
we must go down to the very roots
and tear out, even to the last fiber, we must be,
like nature, hard, cruel, relentless, ragnar redbeard.

Beauty in purity the darkness glows the flesh
through this the black flame of satan
thou walketh in hell
thy senses are awakened to the joy of rebirth
the gates are flung wide and thy passage to heralded
by the deathless cries of his guardian beasts
his searing brand shall be evermore
emblazoned in thy consciousness
it's fiery meaning shall make thee free
in the mist of our black paradise
shall undefiles wisdom rule the rites
of christ are but rites of death
now receive the truth

Arise! Invoke the blasphemous name
the lord of Sodom, the god of Cain
joy to the flesh indulge in the flesh forever

[*] The ever fading light
the light of redemption
we appear as ravens through the mist
night fallen, all devouring
shrouds of blackness
silently consume all that is pure
obscure his world, brothers of the bloodwar
for we are unchained and almighty [x2]

Arise! Invoke the blasphemous name
the lord of Sodom, the god of Cain
joy to the flesh indulge in the flesh forever

In nomine magni dei nostri satanas

Solemn, the lifeless angel of dawn
silhouette, the fading symbol of life
disappears amongst the shadow of wolves

[* - REPEAT]

The celebrations of christ become the
worship of abhorrence
chant the pagan of threnody for the
council of virtus,
a requiem sung for all the
divine their lives are now exhausted
as murdered day casts the sky in blood
over the befallen city of man

Arise! Invoke the blasphemous name
the lord of Sodom, the god of Cain
joy to the flesh indulge in the flesh forever

In nomine magni dei nostri satanas

Solemn, the lifeless angel of dawn
silhouette, the fading symbol of life
disappears amongst the shadow of wolves

In the midst of our black paradise
shall undefiled wisdom rule
the rites of christ are but rites of death
accept the absolute
vanish into the void of thy empty heaven
for thou wert never nor shalt thou ever be
undefiled wisdom
it s fiery meaning shall make thee free
societe des luciferiens:
it's fiery meaning shall make thee free
societe des luciferiens:
it's fiery meaning shall make thee free
societe
