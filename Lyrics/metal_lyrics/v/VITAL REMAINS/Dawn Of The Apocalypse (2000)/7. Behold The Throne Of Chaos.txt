The knell tolls... divine holocaust by the grace of the black moon
The apocalyptic vision for all the world to bear witness to this, 
the opening of the wound
Your numinous kingdom now flows with blood
Antagonist.... come forth and defy my bloodwar at the first light
of dawn
Crowned lord beheaded before me; glimpse your god dethroned
Iconoclast, the glorification of darkness
All is gone.... he is dead
Pureblood of iniquity unfurl the wings of infamy
Scraph enthralled by desecration
Our bloodwar towards completion
Purgate all thought on divination
The knell tolls on forever
Lightless.... amid empyrean collapse
Behold the throne of chaos
Lightless.... amid empyrean ablaze
Behold the throne of chaos
Defy my imperious vehemence, their kingdom birns in flames
The ashes of god I bequeath beneath our feet.... defiled
In reverence... in reverence... in reverence they weep
Defy my imperious vehemence, their kingdom burns in flames
The ashes of god drape the earth, the pious gather.... 
watch as their sacrosancts bleed
In reverence... in reverence... in reverence they weep 
in the Sign of the Horns
They weep in the Sign of the Horns, glory to blasphemy of idols
Satanic Millenium.... upheavel
Let the joyless be adorned with horns
