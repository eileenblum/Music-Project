Anger and hatred pumping through my veins
Rivers of blood, flowing just the same
I swear to you this, this war I'll never give up
As long as I live, my life to you I trust

[Chorus]
We swing our swords, we wield our axe
We drink the blood, the souls we'll smash
We sound the horns, no turning back 
Forever True, Forever Black

Do what thou wilt shall be our land
Only this nothing more
Our carnal desires, sights of celebration
We clearly see our destination
Chorus

Rise up, gather up, sharpen the swords
Rise up armour on, gather the hoards
Rise up battle won, our just reward

Giving our heat and soul, over to you
Only one can imagine, the things that you do
Sacrifice our lives, so we can be free
We are of living flesh, can you not see?

[Repeat verse 1 and 2]

I am forever Underground
