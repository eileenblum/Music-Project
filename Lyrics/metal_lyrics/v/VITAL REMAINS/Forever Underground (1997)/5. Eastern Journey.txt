Misery, cant stop the pain I feel inside
Empty, my soul yearns for something I just can't find
Gathering sights within my mind
Contemplating thoughts I left behind 
Wondering, wondering I am alive

Beckoning - Raising my arms hear my cry
Pity me, pity me not, I will survive
Gathering sights within my mind
Contemplating thoughts I left behind
Reality, torturing my soul I don?t know why

Whispering voices, talking inside my head
Calling me, taunting me, wishing I were dead
Gotta get them out, cast the voices out
Terminate the sounds out, exterminate disturbing sound
Gripping on the life, talking reality
Holding on with might, relying on my sanity

Sanity - searching for my mind, blackened with hate
Justify - shadowing colors, sound that cry
Gathering sights within my mind
Contemplating thoughts I left behind 
Wondering - why I am live

Immersing unthought, tranquil in silence
Underlying secrets, locked in time
Truth to existence lies within thyself
Motionless in wonder, taking in all that's clear

Be gone, fade away, cant blind my eyes
Be gone, fade away, I know the truth
Searching for meaning deep inside
Mindless journey forever ride

[Repeat verse 1 + 2]

Prisms of color I don't understand
Floating in patterns, through the skies of clad
Invisioned in my thoughts together as I stand 
Motionless in wonder taking all that's clear

Be gone fade away, can?t blind my eyes
Be gone fade away, I know the truth
Searching for meaning deep inside
Mindless journey forever ride
