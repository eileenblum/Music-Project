Moon at dawn, high above the horizon
Wind is calm, sun is slowly rising
Clouds will form, hide the blazing star
Mighty winds bring the coming storm

Gather sons of the northern fronts
Born of thorns, you are nocturnal ones
Moonlight ride, you chariot will glide
Through the sky into a blade of glory. 

The climates right, prepare to fight 
Observe the light in the dark night 
Onward we ride, nowhere to hide
You fear in side, let the battle begin

Be hold a land worshiping a man
Ruled by law, under holy rites
Destroy this land, where the Christians stand
Taste the sword, blood pays reward

Cast de souls into a blazing fire 
Sacrifice judgment of our desire
Battles end, victory won
Lord of Darkness, your work is done

Warriors of the night 
Come and rejoice, hail you noble king 
Celebrate thy victory

Rebelling souls born against god,
Armed and ready to dethrone the fool
Twilight has come, twilight of the gods
Dawn breaks the east
It's the morning of Majick 

Destroy the light, don't fear the darkness
Spirits arise, hover the crimson sky
Destroy the light, don?t fear the darkness
Conquer and right, take over the holy kingdom

[repeat verses 1 and 4]

[Chorus]
