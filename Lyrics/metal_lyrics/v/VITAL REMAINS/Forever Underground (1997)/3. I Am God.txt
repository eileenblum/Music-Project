Follow me now and walk the hound of hell
And ride the whirl wins of the night
Together we become an army out of hell
To scourge the earth, and melt the ice

I am one within myself, I am one with the night
Prevailing darkness, I rule this space
Call me god, remembering my face
I will rise divide and conquer
This world I live there is no other
Call to the points north, west, south, east
You summon me, I am the Beast!

And now you appear, proclaiming your life,
As one of a savior,
Holy trinity, a prophet, the coming messiah
Heed these words forget not who I am
You died for nothing and not for the sin of man
I speak the truth, denial is something you just can't hide
Nazarene the hour is up your soul is mine

Worlds waters divide
I am God!

Falling down into space
Crawling on your hands and knees
Begging for your life
Fool you die, I live

[Repeat 1st verse]
