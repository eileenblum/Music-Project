[Music - Lazaro / Lyrics - Suzuki]

prepare the coming of shrapnel embedded flesh
the new communion
tomorrow is the dawning of the age
of ammunition
through my eyes...
he is the creator of fear
he is the creator of lies
he is the creator of suffering
the cancer of mankind
for we are kings of our domain
the rule supreme we shall regain
through his eyes
he is the creator of life
he is the creator of peace
then by the words of their book
he's the true creator of war
complete decimation
consumed by unrelenting voracity
lead them into the world of truth
by killing their faith completely
their truth has finally come undone
as their eyes are blackened by the sun
the words of god that burns inside
the trust is broken
between the one you call divine
has left you screaming...
you lied...you lied...you lied
the words of god that burns inside

the trust is broken
listen to the winds from the north...
our chant of triumph
we are coming...
we are coming...
our force of hate will show the true face of god
we are coming...
we are coming...
our force of hate will show the true face of god
(repeat verses)
gone...are the signs of salvation
gone...are the signs of revelation
gone...are the signs of your fucking god
collapse into misery...life exhausted
wretched be thy name
eradicate...your grip of denomination
abrogation...the taste of Judas upon your lips
forgotten...dishonored and discarded
collapse into misery...life exhausted...
your name torn from the pages of life
