[Music - Lazaro / Lyrics - Suzuki]

untouched by grace
fallen are the messengers
hymns of the profane
unheard by the pious
revere the inverted hypocrite
as we breed to the sound of the hammering nail
BEFOUL THE TEACHINGS OF DIVINITY...
words shall unveil the silent truth
like razors through the flesh of the divine
severing the artery from god
abandoned and devoured by the larvae of those who abhor
distant lull
deep in the subconscious
unstoppable urge...uncontrolled
now coming to the surface
their eyes are blind
but the dead shall always see
the coming entity
ALL WILL WITNESS AS THE UNDENIABLE TRUTH UNFOLDS
FOR THEY NOW KNOW THE TRUTH THAT HEAVEN IS NO MORE
unborn, unblessed and unknowing...
finish the deed of those who came before us
crushing all those who oppose
invert the one nailed to wood
being ravished over and over again...
this shrine of rapture...
lead them to this world of deceit
engulfed by your avarice
killing their faith completely
he was born to rape the world
he was born to rape the world
it is meant to be...their breath of life...stolen by me
dead blood will deface their dreams of pure lucidity
he was born to rape the world
he was born to rape the world
left in awe
the cessation of perseverance
a memory unbecoming
devotion shall drown those who follow
the god they seek...shall be unhallowed
(repeat verses)
he was born to rape the world
he was born to rape the world
it is meant to be...their breath of life...stolen by me
dead blood will deface their dreams of pure lucidity
he was born to rape the world
he was born to rape the world
invert the one nailed to wood
being ravished over and over again...
this shrine of rapture...
lead them to this world of deceit
engulfed by your avarice
killing their faith completely
