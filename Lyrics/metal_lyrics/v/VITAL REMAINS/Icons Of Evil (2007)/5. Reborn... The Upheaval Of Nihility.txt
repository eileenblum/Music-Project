[Music - Lazaro / Lyrics - Suzuki]

jesus...(the) Antichrist
bringer of all the world's plagues and death
true are the words of those before us
the ones who prophesied the end of time
was the pawn for their unbecoming
jesus...(the) Antichrist
look upon the pages of the scripture
the instructions of revelations within
the coming of war is the true word of god
extinction of man will prevail
you brought this ravaging upon yourself
tyrant of the weak
they forced you to believe
jehovah...we cum on the whores who revere
jesus...(the) Antichrist

deny the one
false giver of hope
your innocence was befouled
for you have been deceived
by the king of absurdity
oh, this leaves a warm taste of asperity...
the fading of renouncement breeds within
their structure of what life should become...
is the downfall of mankind
oh, this leaves a warm taste of asperity...
the fading of renouncement breeds within
the once mighty now has fallen...
comes the silence of their fears
this is the time of anti-christian upheaval...
to forever close their undeserving eyes
through the land of the vanquished...
the trail of blood will flood this sanctity
underneath the lining of their words...
comes the true blood of evil
reborn...the upheaval of nihility
release the pain of enslavement...now

[repeat verses]
