[Music - Lazaro / Lyrics - Suzuki]

I PROCLAIM THIS TEMPLE OF FLESH AS THE RULER TO BE...
defame the names of all your dead gods
vomit upon the path of salvation
watch the creator succumb to extinction
the hunter now the hunted
you become the prey for us all

confront me now
defiler of human desire
voracious hordes await the hour of ascension
unravel their delusion
their translucent divinity

THE BLOODSHED
BEGIN THE BLOODSHED

for blasphemy is the pure blood within us all
hear the siren of death from high above
the upheaval of an unholy war...has now begun

(I AM THE FIST IN YOUR BASTARD SON'S FACE...)
burn down the churches...engulfed by hatred
tear down the kingdom...incinerate his vision
destroy their icons...pulled from their neck
the exodus of faith...their will we did break
shattering the hope they once loved [x2]
so, you damn me...no...fuck you.

fuck...your beliefs
fuck...your divine promises
fuck all of those who has preached the swine called god

confront me now
defiler of human desire
voracious hordes await the hour of ascension
unravel their delusion
their translucent divinity

THE BLOODSHED
BEGIN THE BLOODSHED

for blasphemy is the pure blood within us all
hear the siren of death from high above
the upheaval of an unholy war...has now begun

I am the hammered nail, piercing your forsaken flesh
burn down the churches...engulfed by hatred
tear down the kingdom...incinerate his vision
destroy their icons...pulled from their neck
the exodus of faith...their will we did break
shattering the hope they once loved

I, ALONE, BEFOUL THE NAME OF YOUR GODS...
DESPISED ICON OF OFFAL...
defame the names of all your dead gods
vomit upon the path of salvation
watch as the creator succumbs to extinction
the hunter now the hunted
you become the prey for us all
you become the prey for us all
for we are the icons of evil
