[Music - Lazaro / Lyrics - Suzuki]

hammer down the nails...
unfurl the coming aeon
the world as you see it...will be gone
thrust into chaos
unpredicted prophecies unfold
like wolves...we encircle and lure them in for the kill
unadorned
the cross you bear is only the beginning
the symbol you once embraced
now has a new and sickening meaning
like wolves...we encircle and lure them in for the kill
onrush of hate...begin the cleansing of their will
repulsed of your former life
true self-worth abandoned
become the icon of failure
the god whose name became nothing
we defile...in the name of purity
we violate...in the name of sacredness
we deny...in the name of faith
we destroy...in the name of god
no light shall pierce the ebony drape
wordless will be the righteous
glorify in the horror
as the lord did abscond
no light shall pierce the ebony drape
wordless will be the righteous
glorify in the horror
as blackened eyes will see no more

[repeat verses]

hammer down the nails...
