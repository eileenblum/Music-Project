[Music - Lazaro / Lyrics - Suzuki]

hail to the fallen ones
praise our fallen ones
they walked with the darkness
they lived through pain and suffering
no regrets...steamroll right through the herde
never looking back
through their veins
flows the blackest of blood...heathens arise
sweep forth the sickle of abomination
continue their murderous fury
ripped from our hands
hear the cries of those left behind
full force
through the storm of retribution
though life was cut short
your memory will carry on
remember the fallen
through celebration of the human kings
look towards the sky
that is where I'll never be
walking the path of the wicked
their deeds shall live in infamy

[repeat verses]
