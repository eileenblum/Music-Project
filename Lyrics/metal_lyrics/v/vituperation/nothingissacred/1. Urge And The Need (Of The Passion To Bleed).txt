I am Satan, I'm your destiny
I'll penetrate your heart filled with agony
Where's the joy for me these days?
Oh, I figure, I can torture you in so many ways

I burn your skin with my tools
You think you can save him, you fools
Flames and gasoline, that's what I've been seeing
I am Death, and I will take your last breath

Forever gone and burned with fears
I can no longer hold my tears
I cut your skin, in this dark room
The room of agony will be your tomb
Urge and the need
The passion to bleed

I hang your corpse on a hook
What a grateful look
My heart is filled
My work is fulfilled

Life of distress is ending today
I'm kind, you have one last pray
I'll gag your throat
Just, to see, you choke

Bleeeeeeeeeed!

Forever gone and burned with fears
I can no longer hold my tears
I cut your skin, in this dark room
The room of agony will be your tomb
Urge and the need
The passion to bleed

You are soon gone, and you have no choice
Instead of screaming listen to my voice
Your guts are all over the wall
This is, your final, call

Forever gone and burned with fears
I can no longer hold my tears
I cut your skin, in this dark room
The room of agony will be your tomb
Urge and the need
The passion to bleed
