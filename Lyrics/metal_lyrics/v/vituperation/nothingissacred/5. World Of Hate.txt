I draw the conclusion
That suicide, is near
Fear that nothing is worth it
'Cuz you're no longer here

My pain is endless
The scent is beautiful
Were heading forward
No longer backward

Oh, I miss you so
But it, is over, now
Darkness, surrounding me
In, a world of hate

Where are you when I need you the most?
Bashing my head in the wall, to flee from the pain

Salvation is to far away
Nothing is left for me
Save me, from myself
Before it's to late

Oh, I miss you so
But it, is over, now
Darkness, surrounding me
In, a world of hate
