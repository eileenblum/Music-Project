Hammer back, into your head
Penetrate, your eyes
Lead the blind, to their death
Into, their death

Death is Near [x4]

Blood of you, sprayed my face
Look inside, of you

I detest, your human fear
I don't want you near
Human flesh, I hunger for
Victims are, increasing again

Humanity of Life
I don't want your lies
Humanity of Life
Listen when, the holy dies

Dream is now, reality
Licking on your guts
Aggression of my action
It is worth your reaction

Now it's time to die
I will take, your life
Now it's time to die
Diiiiiiieee!

Death is Near [x4]

I detest, your human fear
I don't want you near
Human flesh, I hunger for
Victims are, increasing again

Humanity of Life
I don't want your lies
Humanity of Life
Listen when, the holy dies
