Waiting in silence, I'm near
Urging for violence and fear
Who is next to drown?
Who is next, to mutilate?

Collection of corpses I treat
Slowly I mince you to meat
See her stunned eyes when she die
She... Myself, She myself and I

Lethal injection in your arm
You keep struggling, but I am to strong

Expectations, by the taste of your eyes
Pain is now, Your paradise

Watching you, as you fade away
Say goodbye now, don't be, AFRAID!

Collection of corpses I treat
Slowly I mince you to meat
See her stunned eyes when she die
She... Myself, She myself and I

Waiting in silence, I'm near
Urging for violence and fear
Who is next to drown?
Who is next, to mutilate?

Collection of corpses I treat
Slowly I mince you to meat
See her stunned eyes when she die
She... Myself, She myself and I
