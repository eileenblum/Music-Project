Carried home by a wayward nature
Racing through the dark
Forging a path through the dense
Melting into the texture like some empty
And last thing
Stone open up
And let the grain in

Phantom oil slick
By the floodlights at the edge of the world
Phantom oil slick
Anoints the dark
