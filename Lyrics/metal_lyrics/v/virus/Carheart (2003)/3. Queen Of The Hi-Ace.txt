Sirens make the air coagulate
as we dance silently over the ocean
You and me as king and queen
Over the high end as the panorama builds

We are wheels
Kings and queens
we are ships
Legs and heels
Radiant trips
Causes erections and guilt
As we whip ourselves to sleep

It's not a she
It's the queen of the hi - ace
There on the carpet
In my embrace

It's further
into the woman
It's the queen with the wise face

It's the queen of the hi - ace
