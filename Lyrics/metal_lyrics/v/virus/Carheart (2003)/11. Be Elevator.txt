Be elevator

Why are you here
Insect of the mind
Flying high over the rooftops
Tiny insect wings
Displace the ray and rusty
And the scetches in my brain
Are erased

I increase and deny
The tainted. raw and dusty
Highway to the psyche
And the promised love of something

Be elevator

Steamer juggles with sands of time

Somewhere below the high speed clouds
Losers belong in paradise
Somewhere below the elevator
Somewhere below the sky
