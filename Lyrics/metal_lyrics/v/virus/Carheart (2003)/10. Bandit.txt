With me now
Is the eye of the bandit
His ways of shame
between my clenched teeth
The sores of the road
The sores of the road between us
Sees the glimpse
And stares at the sun

I deliver
I deliver the eye of the bandit
Through a crack in the window
Mechanically
He smiles through the fumes
And the road opens
It appears as his crime

The morale of the bandit
Tattooed on my neck
Its ways of nature
Scribbled on our wreck

The engine. bandit
Fuelled on women and men
The vehicle raging
Through heaven and hell
