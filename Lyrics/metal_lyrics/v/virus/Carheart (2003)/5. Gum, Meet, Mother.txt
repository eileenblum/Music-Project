Join the father. son
Soon to met the mother
covered in concrete
And a pile of dreams

Adorned with the sights and smells
Of Insolence
Join Iniquity
Soon to meet up with the smoke

Gum. meet mother
The aluminum spoon

I went smilingly
Like a Classic obsession
Like an eruption of birds
Dressed purely in skin
Well. this is my dread
Steaming with honesty
It's the fluid in my agony
Adoring and gentle in its mockery

The liquid. the boundless sea
