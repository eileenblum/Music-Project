Dread swims through the bloodstreams 
Floating back into the past 
On the drift, voices wailing 
A tone-deaf choir praising 

It rotates inside the tomb 
Coiled around a broken ladder 
Infants swirl inside the womb 
Retracting to their dense rooms 

The taste of old words 
The heart recoils and repents 
Infected water spoils the well 
A telescope through to hell 

Inside my spacious cellar 
I do not shine right 
The blue light's smooth 
But it's a dense void 
Beneath my tongue, raw screams 
I swim behind the lies and moan 
The blue light's smooth 
But it won't shine right 

The stained internal sculpture 
The holy infant inside the sun 
A dead flower blooming 
Listening out for the end 

Inside my spacious cellar 
I do not shine right 
The blue light's smooth 
But it's a dense void 
Beneath my tongue, raw screams 
The crude voice of the soul 
Underneath my hunger 
My hermetic fowl interior land
