Under the lip of land 
Underground tongues lie for you 
From its arid breath 
The fetid air seals the doors behind 
The lamp swallowed the dark 
The shadow's mutiny 
Now swaying by the signs on the roadside 

See through the fibres 
The dance of love and fear entwined 
On the face of the veil 
And the emptiness beyond 
Among the proud ruins 
Spreading out their limbs 
Grass growing from the inbred garden's grin
