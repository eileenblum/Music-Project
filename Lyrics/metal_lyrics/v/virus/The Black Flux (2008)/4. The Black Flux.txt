Beneath the seas 
The roaring core of the will 
And the cliffs have gone under 

An array of thoughts 
A veil of contempt 
Vivid and fluent 

The inner traveller 
Sneaking away on the 
Sinking ocean trawler 

Erased horizon 
The toxic birds fly 
All silent and hostile 

This is a seething sea 
Under an erupting dawn 
A dawn of disdain 

The mirrors of the will 
Dormant as withering trees 
That quiver and breathe 
My self-loathing overflows 
The watercourse
