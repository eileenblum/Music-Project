Feral aeroplanes 
Stalkers of the drift 
You float inside the hollow waves 
Like sleepwalkers on the ocean highway 

See the blind cavalry 
In their concave masks 
All lined up to fowl the beaches 
Dead faces painted in the sands 

They mimic themselves 
Hiding in the wastelands 
Empty figures on the crests of the dunes 
The desert sculptures paying homage to the wounds 

With broken limbs they dance 
The snakes and their proud owners 
On parade out in the iron rain 
The sun retreats as the caves drink the rivers 

The feral aeroplanes 
Chasing the winds upon the ocean highway 
Gliding on raw silk 
Cheered by broken clapping hands
