The wounds are leaking equivocal fluids 
Flowing through a pale existence 
The atmosphere that holds the heart 
Is the black dam that subdues the tongue 
A downward slope to the archives 

Within lies the story of our decay 
Ripe and complete, so address it now 
The speechless mouth, the withered tongue 
The crests on the path to the archives 

The scented words, sent across the distance 
They pare the walls 
Coating the perfume in between the bricks 
There was no gold in the rivers 

The cold vault 
The sparkling red sun is trapped 
In the quiet room, the sound of the nervous moons' pulse 
The walls cave in 
You coil yourself around the earth 
A downward slope to the archives
