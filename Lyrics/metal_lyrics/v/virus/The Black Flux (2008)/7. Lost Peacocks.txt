Picture sordid 
It's all like pure pleasure, light and laughter 
Hear the constant sneering 
We will stay clean no matter how much we wade in our filth 

Peacocks used to walk this lawn 
'Till all our lost treasures came back full of ash 

With the fortunes granted us 
We entered the house with the dishonest entrance 
Busily betraying 
It spat us in our eyes; it cleansed us with its nest of tongues 

Peacocks used to walk this lawn 
'Till all our lost treasures came back full of ash 

Our eyes are behind us 
And the sky licks itself away 
Our eyes are behind us 
And the sky licks itself away 

See our scoundrel flowers 
The disgrace as we present them gleaming in the mirrors 
A swarm of birds has slipped off 
Dressed purely in the comfort of our skin 

Peacocks used to walk this lawn 
'Till all our lost treasures came back full of ash 

My eyes have fallen behind 
As I lick the empty skies 
My eyes have fallen behind 
As I lick the empty skies
