Your contaminated majesty 
You live in my wounds 
As I feast on your red dirt (scooping out your tunnels) 
I find no answer to your riddle 
Your matches spark close to my eyes 
While I'm smoothing out the sands (leaving no trail) 
In your dry alien deserts 
Filtering out the stones on your prairies 

We jumped off the cliff 
You wanted to prove your luck 
You came up clean (through the white noise) 
I drowned close to your loathing 
Your broken monstrous love (your jaded presence) 
Naked and bare like a knife 
My bed is a tomb 
I live in your virulent womb
