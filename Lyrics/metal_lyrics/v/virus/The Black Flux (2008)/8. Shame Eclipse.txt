My shrivelled eyes 
The membrane that has been given me 
The freight-trains are all empty 

I cannot be reached 
The organism from the burning star 
The buildings are all vacant 

The colour of cool stone 
Soaked in stale water 
The withering eye has no desire 

Dim light and dying fire 
All within reach is tainted 
Like the soul in the black egg
