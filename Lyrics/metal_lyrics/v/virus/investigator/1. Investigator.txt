I saw that flickering in the retina of your eye
Such flawless behavior under your perfect blue sky
Walk me through the details, walk me through the lies
Creeping through your voices, seeping through your shine

Crystalline mind, eyes world-blind
Trailing off, revealing contorted truths
Your veins are mapped out, such a frigid world
Like a dead city bombed by your design
