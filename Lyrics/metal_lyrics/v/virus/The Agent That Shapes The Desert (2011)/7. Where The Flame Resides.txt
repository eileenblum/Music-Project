The flares of life, the torches
The things to see when you slip into reason
The flares are there, dancing in the corner
Subtle reminders

And you see now that all around you
is dancing silently
as if to be discreet
As if life was all a discreet landscape
just dancing subtly around you
In the flame or where it resides
Next to the spent candle

Little containers, shrubs in your garden
Just light them and see
They have a way of showing you what you
were missing
The seem eternal to me

You need a light to see in the dark
Here they come to life
Come to you little flowers of the dark

Little flames in an hourglass
traveling towards death
Like us, they move down
showing their descent
to the eyes they have illuminated
