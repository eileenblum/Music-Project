The agent that shapes the desert, 
you're a well of dense fluids

From the basin of time, you have derived
from the lakes you've left behind

The boundless celestial season
drags the sands of time

In between your flecks of sparks, 
a constellation of departed stars

A day in the life of the agent
One blink of the eye, pre-creation

From the catacombs where our dead rivers run
the constant red glows bright

A thousand arms point to the sun, 
the sky picked clean and white

Into the bestial season, 
the angry animals are all in sight

Just fiercely rotating, roaring
in between their specks of light

A day in the life of the agent
One blink of the eye, pre-creation

Analyzing eyes howl, 
you watch the ashes engulf the sky

Known pulses hits the air, 
behind a veil, your breath, you sneer

The radiant tunnels stashed, 
now grasp the atmosphere

Washed away towards the tides, 
and chased down towards the spine
