What lives inside of me is a part of night empire
Vast fields lighted by blind light
Leaving the tower of my castle
Surround by a violent and magic fog

Throw an army of destroyers
Against those pages of my vision
Which are only dust in the book of soul
Try calling treacherous birds
And left them feast upon my thoughts

Then you'll set free an element mysterious
You'll know the power of my dark side
My demon will bow to your torture
Try awaking my angel
You'll discover the other cards of my path
What lives inside of me is a shadow of the great name
