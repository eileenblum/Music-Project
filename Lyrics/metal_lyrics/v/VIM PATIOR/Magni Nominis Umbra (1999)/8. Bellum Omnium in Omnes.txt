[This is what the booklet says:
"When I was writing this lyric my heart was blinded by great wrath and hate towards religion.
I don't want to have anything to do with organisations which would interference with my own world.
Rebellion is unavoidable.
Fight enables us to find the sense of the existence, define your identity on our way to the universe.
"Bellum..." says about my own struggle.
It's a difficult lyric and could be easily misunderstood.
I haven't inserted it because I#m not a prophet.
My truths aren't yours...for each man will follow his own path..."]
