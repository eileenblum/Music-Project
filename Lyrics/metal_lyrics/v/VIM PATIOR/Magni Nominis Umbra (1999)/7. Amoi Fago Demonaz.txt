[This is what the booklet says:
"This is a very specific and personal prayer
A lyric which I would unvocer some of the keys to my world in too literal way.
The "other lyrics" let you make your own, free interpretation.
Personification of the demon that roam in the forest of my oblivion
Magic and mystery - last as long as their faces are hidden"]
