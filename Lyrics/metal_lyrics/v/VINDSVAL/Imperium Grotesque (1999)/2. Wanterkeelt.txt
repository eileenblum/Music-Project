Demonic shades of winter
Frozen splendour, cryptic chants
Cataclysms hail its arrival
Centuries rebegin...

Sharpened winds of funeral haze
Nocturnal beauty comes forth
Dirges howl aghasting
Tombs open to unleash
New dimensions of eternal cold
Earthly shape is swallowed
Wicked are the tides
That remain silent

And when it will rain fire
That will freeze to ice
Then thy name is disclosed:

WANTERKEELT!

Eternal twilight closes in
Raptured by black vacuum
Winter solstice now shall hide
Bright crystals' glimmering
Dark species sigh in woe
As fog covers the mountainsides

And when it shall rain fire
That shall freeze to ice
Then thy name is disclosed:

WANTERKEELT!
