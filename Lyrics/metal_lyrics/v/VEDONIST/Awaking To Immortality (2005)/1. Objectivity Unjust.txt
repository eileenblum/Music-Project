[Lyrics by Gerhalt, music by Gerhalt&amp;Bunos]

The key to mystery of of human behaviour
Guards cruel co-existential truth
Spontaneus life is a vision of a madman
Pressing minds deride with hollow laugh

You are just a function of other functions
Slave of human opinions
The one, who lays my way
With the whip plaited of tears

Subjective truth gives you strength
To live in lieof objectivity
Othersâ truth is my truth
Your truth is no-oneâs truth

You choke with suffering
Rigid vision of yourself in their eyes
Torment of keeping up appearances
Is a whimâs string around your neck

You plunge in the depths of pessimism
Inevitalibly you are going to discover
The darkest recesses of destiny
Groaning soul is avid for freedom
Drives you to brake the bonds
Bastards of human blindness
As a testimony of damn truth
Scream for puppetsâ attention

Desist from your pathetic attempts
In yoke of filthy reality 
Weare just powerless actors
In the traveling theater of vanity
