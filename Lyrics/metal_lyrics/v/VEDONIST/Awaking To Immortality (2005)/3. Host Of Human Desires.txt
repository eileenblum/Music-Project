[Lyrics by Gerhalt, music by Gerhalt&amp;Bunos]

Hypnotic dance of deformed shadows
The dance of morbid visions, demons of decadence
In claustrophobic space of human psyche
Wakes desires of deadly solace up

In mad elation of soul
Insane motions spread the redness
Like a blood, which whiteness is hungry for 
Apocalyptic landscape, a storm of colours
Winding lines roll, sparkle with tints of purplish red
Dies irae, fury of the flaming sky
Cover your ears, my friend
Because with the howl of hyenas
Host of human desires approaches

Schizophrenic sights bury calmness
Unrestrained nightmares, dreams of the madman
Every limit fade away
World of imagination comes into life

Paleness paints the deadly pale face
Suckcs all colors out, sucks life out
Contorted mouth yells into emptiness
Scream drills brain, crushes temple
Terror, clouds your gaze
Deprives of strength, paralyses senses, inflicts pain
However, is not the agony what
your miserable body is afraid of
Life is your worst nightmare 

Int the critical minute of my existence
I call you, hear me begging

Damn self-portrait  of the fallen genius
The one brought down from clouds of ideals
Apathetic spurt gives rise to yell
The last scream into void of the steely sky
