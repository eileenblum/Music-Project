Life has got a bitter taste
Cruel tortures here on earth
My aim -- became pointless

I want to die -- to run away
Why should I live? Torment dream
I want to awake in a better world

This horrible dream is pulling out my limbs,
Burning my eyes, tearing off my skin,
Drilling my brain, wallowing in my suffering

It steals my blood, consciousness and life
Wants to see me fallen and admit into itself
And love like a child or kick like a dog

When I'm going into it's fallen arms
And when our roads unite, we are once again
Like a brothers, we are again brothers

And once again life is a madness
It's sweet like a blood, black like a night
And once again I want to live

Then the last dream comes...

Life has got a bitter taste
Cruel tortures here on earth
My aim -- became pointless...
