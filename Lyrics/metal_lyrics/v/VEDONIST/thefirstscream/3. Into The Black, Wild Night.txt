Into the black night, wild wail
Is waking you up
Wolf's song and billy-goat's roar
Are abducting you
You are going where is the magical power
It wants you
It wants you

Hide your heart, leave your conscience
Forest of the cemetery's crosses
And the homeless dog's litany
From now on there is your destiny

DESTINY!

You are going where is the gallery of death
Where ghosts' power hover in the air
You are going where grave is your bed,
Where black raven watches over bad dreams

Hide your heart, leave your conscience
Forest of the cemetery's crosses
And the homeless dog's litany
From now on there is your destiny

DESTINY!

You are going
Where is the magical power,
The incarnated evil
It wants you
