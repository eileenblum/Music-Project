Welcome to the house of the Torture's charm
Welcome to the house of the Hunger's blaze
Be my guest
Welcome to the house of the Madness' bliss
Welcome to the house of the Nightmare's grace
You can rest

Life is a pain in your neck
Stop, you just can't take it back
Day is a torment, a road to hell
Sad, but it's true -- wait for a bell

Fear of the death drives you mad
Pain plays with you, ruins your head
Tears are your fate, no-one to blame
Guilt looks so obvious, what a shame

Here is the different world
Here are the different laws
Here is the different
LIFE

Here is the different truth
Here are the different paths
Here is the different
DEATH

You and your hope are my sneer
Pray to your god, the end is near
Die like a dog, like a slave
Rot in a cold, nameless grave
