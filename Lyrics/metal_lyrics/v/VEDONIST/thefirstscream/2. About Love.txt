Like wonderful balm she heals my wounds
She gives me solace, sweet pleasure, great joy

She is the most beautiful
Her love is the strongest
She will never betray me
She respects me, she will wait

She will heat up my mind,
Freeze my limbs
Together we will reach
The untold ecstasy

Love, Death

I will get into Her
She wants to be me
She wants to caress me,
Do me good

So I go into Her shoulders,
To be with Her forever
Until the end of humankind,
Eternity and everything

Love, Death

Here comes my beloved,
My love, my mistress forever
I wait for Her, I lust for Her,
I want to get to know Her

Thanks to Her I will
Get back my soul
Eternal calmness
And a will to live

We'll be dancing
Over the land of shadows
Until the end of humankind,
Eternity and everything

Love, Death
Love, Death

Her name is...DEATH
