You struggle aguishly in captivity of fever
With a silent plea of clenched jaws
Mutilated body spit with suppurated bleeding
From among sutures of murderous cuts

At the flash of consciousness you sob voicelessly
With bloody tears  of deathly suffering
Hateful pain pierces the swollen limbs
Imprinted by untimely decease

Ruthless butchers with academic tiles
Swear on an oath of moral decadence
Among silent prayers contaminated by fear

You tear apart the sticky cocoon of nightmares
Just to awake in the macabre of reality
Lethal gangrene hungry for a helpless victim
Bites into your wounds with infected fangs

You shudder at the last stage of martyrdom
Irreparably deafened by a wailing requiem
Sinister stench of postoperative complications
Strangles your senses on the hospital death bed

Esteemed executioners in surgical masks
Cut the human material with contempt
For the sake of ideological absurdity system

You freeze in the clutches of inevitable death
Which crushes emaciated life in a sadistic act

Criminals of pseudo-medical experiments
Quarter humanity with merciles scalpels
In the macabre world of reversed Decalogue
