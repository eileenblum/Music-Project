Convicted for blood we live humbly in a land of eternal night
Where the chimney, campâs black angel, has challenged the sun
He has thrown a shade on the bodies hog-tied with a barbed wire
Yet could not deprive our hearts of the light

Absorbed by the society of progressive dehumanization
We fight for the inner preservation of pride
We stand against the wind with a chain of hatred by our feet
Yet your ubiquitous spirit makes us feel free

The skies thunder over the cursed pandemonium
In which individuals defend the memory of their fathers
Eternity remains silent over the bestial world
In which compassion opposes absurdity
The sea bursts into flames over the kingdom of darkness
In which human desires to remain human
A mirror freezes over the plant of extermination
In which the saintsâ wings grow without majesty

Put to an inhuman test we unite in faith
And with a prayer we look into the eyes of destiny
A cross weighs the weak bodies down, a bloody crown cries
Yet we still proceed onto the Golgotha of the common

Lux in tenebris lucet
