Beloved sisters, flowers of the forotten dreams
How trustfully you take to our insincere palms
The sea of flawless bodies glitters with a thousand glances
The ones we cannot return among all the silent sadness

Beloved sisters, you strut shyly in the march of nakedness
With the wind flowing on a beautiful hair cascade
In the breathsâ warmth lurk the promises of pleasure
The unspeakable ones to sleep in a flame

Beloved sisters, still calm in unawareness
You share with us the youthful sweetness of smile
And you walk gracefully toward the heavy doors
The ones that separate you from eternity

Beloved sisters, sentimental thoughts run to you
Onto the other side of human consciousness
And with prayer they cover your small footprints
The ones which ivariably lead to the crematory
