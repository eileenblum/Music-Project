Unholy gatherings, beneath the midnight sky
Praise blackened deities, the world of God denied
They call the ancient ones, invokes infernal names
Sigil of Baphomet, baptized in blood and flames

Faithless in the eyes of God
And reverse your holy cross
Renounce your crown of thorns
Defile your mother whore

AvÃ©, AvÃ© Satanas
AvÃ©, Luciferi Excelsi

New world disorder, oppressed upon mankind
Burn, your blessed trinity, your holy book of lies
Blind faith euphoria, the parasites they feed
Your endless worshipping, will satisfy their greed

Faithless in the eyes of God
And reverse your holy cross
Renounce your crown of thorns
Defile your mother whore

AvÃ©, AvÃ© Satanas
AvÃ©, Luciferi Excelsi
