Welcome to the darkside - let the games begin
Everything your flesh desires is here - chose your sin

Tell me what's your pleasure
Let me feel your pain
In this realm our worlds collide
To me it's all the same

I am your dark desire - so deep within your mind
I am the one within the one you dare not find
All things forbidden
That penetrate your skin
I am the urge you feel to free the beast within

Feel your lust rising - see the skin writhing
Feel the blood rush - deep inside - your flesh

Every sense burning - every cell yearning
Join as one - I am - deep inside - Dein Fleisch

Your flesh
