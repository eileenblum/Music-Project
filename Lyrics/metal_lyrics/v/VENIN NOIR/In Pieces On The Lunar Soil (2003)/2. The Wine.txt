[Music: Campilho/Frade/Montechiari Lyrics: Dias]

["Sometimes it's hard to realize when good things finally happen to us. Life gets us so used to failing, that succeeding sounds too surreal to take. This song's about the acceptance of good and the awareness of our deservingness in ourselves, until it's part of our blood. And we must not be afraid of tasting it."]

Deny me not the throne I deserve
We'll never know what was in store for us
We're just dissidents both wounded in victory
We'll never know whether they were true
Tell me not these stories I Despise
I remain unseen, recognize my disguise
And taste the wine

Come taste the wine, crave for it
Until my blood is running in your veins
Take what's thine, live with it
Soon it will be running in your veins

Care for me as I give you all
I don't expect anything but my own fall
Stare at me as I give you all
I don't want anything in return but all
And taste the wine

Don't you drop the wine I bleed for you
I no longer wait for you believing
Don't you wonder why you can't fulfill
What once was the reason for you living
So taste the wine
