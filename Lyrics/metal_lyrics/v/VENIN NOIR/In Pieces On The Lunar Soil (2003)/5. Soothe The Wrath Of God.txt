[Music: Salles/Santos/Campilho/Dias Lyrics: Dias]

["Love is a remedy we need, a resurrection to our bodies and minds. This one's to show how powerful an embrace can be. When desperately need it and it comes, your soul is enlightened and even the wrath of God seems to be unable to make it go away."]

What's in these pills, that won't let me sleep? 
This catharsis I asked clarified my doubts 
Delirious apathy...without this remedy, I'm dead 
Such embrace would soothe the wrath of God 
No disgrace could ever bring a happiness so odd 

What's in this feeling that won't let me curdle? 
This alibi I can't use wouldn't help me shout 
A call to oblivion: to live without this remedy 
Such embrace would soothe the wrath of God 
No disgrace... 

Live...a dead body can live 
A dead mind may think 
You don't seem to hear the wrath of God 

Such embrace would soothe the wrath of God 
No disgrace could ever bring a happiness so odd 
Without this remedy, I'm dead, you soothe the wrath of God
