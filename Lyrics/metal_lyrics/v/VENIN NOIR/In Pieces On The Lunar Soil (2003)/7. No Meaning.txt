[Music: Santos/Dias Lyrics: Dias/Frade]

["People who are used to living their lives searching for a meaning in everything tend to suffer more. Some deeds we just have to do without asking, some fears are just overcame by lying, some promises just have no meaning. So, the way out that's left to us is defying mourning by pretending it's not there."]

Life's a deed I deny, a mission I regret 
A mourning I defy...and there's no meaning. 
Life's a promise I repent, I'm no deceiver 
A letter never sent - now I'm searching for a meaning 
I'm not the weaker, but just the leftouts of my rage 

So flatly committed to life 
Perseverance wants to fail me 
An engine that slays my soul 
For suffering is my creed 
I call it a fear of failing 
Nearly facing this task, what you call will 
For all the lies we tell were never meant to be... 
There's no meaning 

When a word is worthless, it seems so wasted 
And the hardship of living is a fine sweet funny play 
We stood pretending nothing would be in our way 

Answers we can't hear 
Unreachable, emphasize this mystery 
And the enemy that we don't fear 
Endeavors my victory
