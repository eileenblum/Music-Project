[Music: Santos Lyrics: Dias/Frade]

["It's hard when we can't decipher what's on somebody else's mind, and yet we're sure it's something about us. Happiness is too weak so it's got to be taken care of every day. This one describes a death of a love."]

Something about your manners 
Surprises me every day, but no 
Things are not the same in our lives 
here lies a doleful soul 

could it be a refusal? 
Or just a way you just found to be mean 
Such a narrow allegiance to such a weak happiness 
Carry me in this chamber 
Lie...you might find me so lost 
But it's just me: a light that can't be seen 
You might find me pathetic 
Omniscient in my grave 

Something about your scars 
Makes me laugh and wonder why 
Would you be open-minded enough 
To fail in your trail 

Doomed in the stanzas (that the poet has made) 
Painted in the canvas (a forlorn self-portrait) 
It made me like this...you failed before me
