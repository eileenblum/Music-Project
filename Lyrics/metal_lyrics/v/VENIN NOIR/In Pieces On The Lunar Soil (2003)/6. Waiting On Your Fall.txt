[Music: Campilho Lyrics: Dias]

["This one is another bitter letter to a finally forgotten one. It talks about good memories falling apart, when you look at old pictures and cannot feel the happiness you had when you took them. Everything begins to die when we no longer regard these moments as eternal, even though we have always known nothing is. When we can imagine something dead, this thing is already dying."]

Almost catching the spirit again 
Recovering my deeds done in vain 
All the tears that I have shed 
When my ways were all misled 
Have shown me the other face of fate 
Have taught me the real meaning of hate 
Colliding truth and dreams - reality is worse than it seems 

Searching, never finding the touch of God on my face 
The moment I died is written on the wall: 
a picture of me waiting on your fall 

Almost reaching the silence again 
It keeps surrounding me until I surrender 
Thoughts bringing kindness and anger 
Both life and death embrace me together 
Shall I decide the side I'm in forever? 
Always at war with my conscience 
breathing the losses of existence 

Building reasons to believe the lie 
Words smell like past - shall I speak my last 
forging limits to my private sky 
could not be that fast - afterlife's one more test
