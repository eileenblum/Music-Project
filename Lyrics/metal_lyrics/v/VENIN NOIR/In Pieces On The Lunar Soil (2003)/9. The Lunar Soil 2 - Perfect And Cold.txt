[Music: Santos Lyrics: Dias]

["As it always happens, from an unexpected place comes another promise of happiness, and you feel able to hope again. These are some of the priceless moments we should keep in our minds as long as we live. It talks about the fear of failing again. But the sense of having achieved a higher ground makes us overcome this fear, and try to pick up the pieces and build another future with a clean spirit, on another moon. Because every word is right, when said to the right listener."]

You're so perfect and cold as the lunar soil 
You're the distance unfold from the lunar soil 

You showed me to the lunar soil 
When the night was still 
And the past silenced our reason 
You kept every word I ever wrote 
Because they could be yours 
As it now seems impossible to get rid of misery 

In pieces on the lunar soil 
I just found another moon 
In pices on the lunar soil 
I've been to a wrong sky 

You showed me to the lunar soil 
When the night was over 
You just made shadows live again 
Keeping every word I ever said 
Because they should be yours 
As it now seems reliable this way out of agony 

Let me fear, comprehend my fear 
We know what's like to be in pieces on the lunar soil
