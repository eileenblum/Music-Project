["This one shows a person who needs help, but does not want to be helped. Everyone has gone through this, which makes this situation something understandable and weird, at the same time. It is about one's fear of being helped. When you do not trust anyone, being helped means being enslaved. When you feel everyone is there to take advantage of your weaknesses, you are always getting even with yourself. Then, you can only reap the same bitterness that you sow".]

clairvoyance bewilders me
beholding what I shall deny
fulsome vertigo, balmy spring
whithering, slipping through my eye
once a saviour, always a slave

what's she weeping for?
I have been to this scene before
life refuses to change the end
the end refuses to reap the grand

fear not my taintless acts
for they should set me free
quarrels on future tense facts
another backslide reverie

only love could make us even
need your eyes to reveal what's hidden
between darkness and light
