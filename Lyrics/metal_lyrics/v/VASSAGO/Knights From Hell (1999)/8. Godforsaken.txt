[Music; Pepa]
[Lyrics;Turner]

A dark cloud is rising on the horizon, the skies are glowing in fiery red,
The North and the South, East and West, have sworn allegiance to the armies
Of Death
Burning rivers, dried-up oceans, desert lakes, and wasted plains
Crumbling hills, tumbling mountains, charcoal trees, columns inflamed
We stand and look at the works of Hell
Boastful and proud, we've performed them well!

Take
One last look at the earth, god
While it still stands as the realm that you claimed
Satan's armies are charging
And when we are through, it will never be the same

Holocaust winds devastating the churches, believers buried under sacred stone
The mild and the meek, the weak and the feeble, exterminated one by one
Nuns violated by ghoulish hordes, monks castrated with razor-sharp swords
Graves re-opening and taking in the whole bastard brood of the Nazarene
We look about, not one soul anymore
Willing to hail the son of the whore!

Take
One last glance at your herds, god
While they still look upon you and sheepishly pray
A memory of brainless devotion
Will be all you are left with, we will sweep them away

Godforsaken
Godforsaken

Raped holy virgins giving birth to snakes, angels impaled on a million stakes
Prophets with eyes and tongues cut out, no more lies will ever pour out of
Their mouths,
Demons feasting on the fruits of Eden, cherubs and seraphs tortured and bleeding
Howling soldiers soiling your throne, desecrating the altar you're crouching on
We look around, orgastic glee
The powers of evil, eternally free!

Take
A last glimpse round heaven, god
The Paradise meadows, peaceful, serene
They will be a raging inferno
When the unsaintly armies are marching in

Dare look at me, one look in my eyes, and i'll spare your worthless,
Miserable life
No brave deed demanded of thee, just one brief look, and you will go free
Yet I know you won't, horrified of the spell, you can never look into the
Face of hell
Cowardly grovelling in front of Me, face hidden in dust, sight of misery
I spit on you and I crush your skull
Victory, triumph, once and for all!

And now
Dare look at Me, god
Your conqueror, your master, your Lord I am
Remember the words I have spoken,
I will never serve you - non serviam!

Godforsaken
Godforsaken
