[Music: Pepa, Bloodlord]
[Lyrics: Sin]

The evil-creator gave me the power
He gave unto me the storms and the winds
He gave me the power to reign
And he wants me to destroy the world of god

Destroyer

I gave this world a stormwind of hell
And i gave this world a raging thunder
I spread the virus of death with my breath
I make the fucking world suffer in pain

Destroyer

I suffocate the air
I burn the oceans dry
I drown the earth in blood
And I nail your god once again

[Lead: Suckdog]

Destroyer!
