[Music: Pepa]
[Lyrics: Sin]

I saw on my both sides an abyss full of black shapes of hell
They scream and call me brother, they call me brother
I saw on my both sides an abyss full of black shapes of hell
They scream and call me brother, they call me brother
A fire was rising up from the abyss
It burned my skin and boiled in my blood
It will never end
I scream with pride in my voice;
"Evil be my god, evil be my god!!!"
A fire was rising up from the abyss
It burned my skin and boiled in my blood
It will never end
I scream with pride in my voice;
"Evil be my god, evil be my god!!!"

I heard a storm of rejoicing when I fell
It will never end
I scream with pride in my voice;
"Evil be my god, evil be my god!!!"
"Evil be my god, evil be my god!!!"

I heard a storm of rejoicing when I fell
It will never end
I scream with pride in my voice;
"Evil be my god, evil be my god!!!"
"Evil be my god, evil be my god!!!"

Abysmical downfall to the kingdom where I will rule eternally!!!
A fire was rising up from the abyss
It burned my skin and boiled in my blood
I saw on my both sides an abyss full of black shapes of hell
They scream and call me brother, they call me brother
