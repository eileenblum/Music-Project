[Music: Pepa]
[Lyrics: Sin]

[Lead: Suckdog]

Riders of black at the battlefield stands
Surrounded by bodies, the enemies slain
Death in the air cleansed our breath
Total war brings total death

[Lead; KK Kranium]

On our stallions of black we march for war
To kill the last standing of the human race
The swords in our hands cut like razors
Cutting the throats of the feeble humans

No more fucking peace, war at last
Only death remains...

[Lead; Suckdog]

Battle follow battle til the end is reached
To stand against evil is to march to death
Join our horde or join the eternal sleep
This final total war is ours to win

[Lead; Pepa]

Battle follow battle til the end is reached
To stand against evil is to march to death
Join our horde or join the eternal sleep
This final total war is ours to win

Kill, kill him, kill him, 
kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill!!!

No more fucking peace, war at last
Only death remains...
