[Music: Pepa, Bloodlord]
[Lyrics: Rudolfsson, Pepa]

Behold the sign
Of the mighty one
Behold the path
To the darkest one
Behold the throne
Of the supreme one
Behold the sign
Of the mighty one
Behold the path
To the darkest one
Behold the throne
Of the supreme one

666 carved in the bullet
It kills every one
Metallic Mayhem of death strikes out
Red laserdot beams marks the spots
Suckers of the light
Transforms to pussies 
666 carved in the bullet
It kills every one
Sign of Vassago
Metallic mark of sado

Extreme speed of evil
Exclusive seed of satan
Grand aggressive violence
Pounding machinegun brain-fuck

666 carved in the bullet
It kills every one
blast away human parts
demonic iron phallo
Suckers of the light
Transforms to pussies 
666 carved in the bullet
It kills every one
Sign of Vassago
Metallic mark of sado

Extreme speed of evil
Exclusive seed of satan
Grand aggressive violence
Pounding machinegun brain-fuck

[lead; Suckdog]

666 carved in the bullet
It kills every one
Grind of Vassago, 
gigantic metal phallo
Suckers of the light
Transforms to pussies 
666 carved in the bullet
It kills every one
Sign of Vassago
Metallic mark of sado

Extreme speed of evil
Exclusive seed of satan
Grand aggressive violence
Pounding machinegun brain-fuck
