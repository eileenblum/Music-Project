[Music; Pepa]
[Lyrics; Brolycke, Bloodlord, Pepa]

The origin of evil, the bringer of death
Try to escape, the end is determined
Your attempts are useless, in the end you will be
Crushed by the endless wrath of Vassago

Fear the evil, crawl in the mud
You will end up crushed by a scud
Wake up and see through the illusion
Escape from the flesh and find the solution

Flee to the east , flee to the west
Without faith you will forever rest
Flee to the south , flee to the north
Your incineration will come forth

The origin of evil, the bringer of death
Try to escape, the end is determined
Your attempts are useless, in the end you will be
Crushed by the endless wrath of Vassago

Fear the evil, crawl in the mud
You will end up crushed by a scud
Wake up and see through the illusion
Escape from the flesh and find the solution

Flee to the east , flee to the west
Without faith you will forever rest
Flee to the south , flee to the north
Your incineration will come forth
