"May the bridges I burn show me the way!!!"
Suicide be my FUTURE!!!
Satan I am soon by your side
Darkness darkness be my guide
Evil evil for you be my good
Blackened this blackened soul of mine
....I bleed....
...leave my body...
.....blue.....
I enter the blue light!!!!
I am freed.... FREE!!!
Satan I am soon by your side
Darkness darkness be my guide
Evil evil for you be my good
Blackened this blackened soul of mine...

[Music &amp; Lyrics: Pepa]
