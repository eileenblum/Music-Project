god of heaven, show me thy endless fall
With broken wings, fly nomore Blood of heaven, crystalized
Wear your glory as a curse
Forever burn, eternal fall each single nail represents every single lie
Spill the blood of christ Upon your holy ground
Nothing is sacred in this satanic rite
Melting throne, candles bleed dust in the air,
empire collapse we rise our cups to the skies...
...and spit...
the blood of christ!!!

[Muisc: Pepa, Lyrics: Sin]
