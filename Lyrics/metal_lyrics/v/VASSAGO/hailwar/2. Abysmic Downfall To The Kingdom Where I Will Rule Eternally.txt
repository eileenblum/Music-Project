I saw on my both sides an abyss full of black shapes of hell
they scream and call me brother,
they call me brother I saw on my both sides an abyss
full of black shapes of hell they scream and call me brother,
they call me brother
A fire was rising up from the abyss it burned my skin
and boiled my blood it will never end I scream with pride in my voice;
"Evil be my good, evil be my good!!!"
A fire was rising up from the abyss it burned my skin
and boiled my blood it will never end I scream with pride in my voice;
"Evil be my good, evil be my good!!!"
I heard a storm of rejoicing when I fell it will never end
I scream with pride in my voice;
"Evil be my good, evil be my good!!!"
"Evil be my good, evil be my good!!!"
Abyssical downfall to the kingdom where I will rule eternally!!!
I saw on my both sides an abyss full of black shapes of hell they scream
and call me brother, they call me brother!!
