I'd find a new purpose if there was one for me, but I can't leave my feelings when the city sleeps.
In darkness, in vain, to the very last hour you will know my pain is real.

Anything to numb, anything to keep spitting ignorance.
Anything to numb, anything to kill this grief.
Anything to numb, anything to kill.
Anything to kill your ghost.
Insufficient reactions.

Free myself from the every day and death awaits my touch.
Motherfucker!

Anything to numb, anything to keep spitting ignorance.
Anything to numb, anything to kill this grief.
Anything to numb, anything to kill.
Anything to kill your ghost.
