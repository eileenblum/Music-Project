My kingdom of nothing
A monument to all my failures
A symbol of myself

Why always me?
What did I do to deserve this?
Another waste of time
Why should I have to live through this torture?

Maybe another day

But how often does a motherfucker like you try me?
Or think you have what it takes?

All bark no bite
