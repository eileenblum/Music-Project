Downplay my actions
You never cared
Brainwash me
This burden I bear

I thank god it won't last forever
I thank god this nightmare will pass

You tried to kill what makes me me
Destroy what makes me free


Its hard to believe it
And it's tearing me to
Pieces

Do your worst
Until the light inside goes out

Am I the only one
Who sees through this facade
Am I the only one
Who feels that this is wrong

No, I am not the one
