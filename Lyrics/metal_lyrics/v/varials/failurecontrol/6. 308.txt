I'm not afraid to die
When I feel like this
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
And I've come to collect

What would you even know about loss
So heavy is the crown
Just enough to pull you down

This world's a fucking sickness
You're drowning
Trying to cope with this modern existence

Has all your luck run dry
Am I the thorn in your side

You failed me over and over again
You must be crazy if you think I'd let you win

Cut yourself short
Cut yourself open
Cut yourself out of the picture
I don't want to waste my time
'Cause there's not much left

I'm not afraid to die
When I feel like this
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
And I've come to collect

What would you even know about loss
So heavy is the crown
Just enough to pull you down

For every time I killed your ghost
I prove to myself
You're what I hated the most

My demons are gone
I'm dead to the world
My entire life was a waste
Why did I even try
