No Idols

It's all a lie
Everything they ever told you
There's a hand behind the curtain
Pulling the strings for your every move

What is this crushing weight
Of constant debt

A thousand pounds off my back
Still leaves a thousand more

Live for yourself
Don't let them get your best
Don't you dare make my life
Feel like a fucking test

Don't push me
I'm made of stone
No, don't you fucking push me
I will break all of your bones
With every ounce of strength I have

There are no idols
There are no gods
There are no masters
There's only right from wrong

There are no idols
There are no gods
You have no purpose
There is only right from wrong
