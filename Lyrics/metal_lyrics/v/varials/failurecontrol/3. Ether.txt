My insecurities
I'm lining 'em up
Just to knock them down
Can't find a home from east to west
Sole survivor
Fuck the rest

Don't tell me what to think
I'm already standing on the edge
My legs are shaking
With everything in me
I want it all
The world is mine

In my head
I believe it's a dream
What am I here for
What the fuck does it mean
How could you be accepting of death
Well I won't let you take me, no

I will not die
With this black cloud over my head
Bite for bite
Pound for pound
It always keeps me down

I was just a sick joke anyway
And you, you were just make believe
You left me out to dry

Don't fill my head with your stories again
Before you find out that there's a price on your head

I'm lining them up just to knock them down

Can't find a home from east to west
Sole survivor
Fuck the rest
