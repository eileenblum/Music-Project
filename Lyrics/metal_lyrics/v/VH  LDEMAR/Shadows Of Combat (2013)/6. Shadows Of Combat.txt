Across the darkness
You! You try to throw me of the game
Attack all the times that you want
What can you do with a war without end

Pact done shadow season
Back home burning the sun
Pact done solid reason
Proud
I want to kill 'em all

Slaves of the night
Now you've got to fight
Your blood is mine

Slaves of the night
Now you've got to fight
I am the spirit of Satan's pride

Shadows of combat
Let your soul fill my mind gone insane
No fight everyday's the same
What you can see you have seen everything

Slaves of the night
Now you've got to fight
Your blood is mine

Slaves of the night
Now you've got to fight
I am the spirit of Satan's pride

Yeah, immortal love
What's blowing cold and nobody's home
I am under the gun
My head's on fire the pact is done

Slaves of the night
Now you've got to fight
Your blood is mine

Slaves of the night
Now you've got to fight
I am the spirit of Satan's pride
