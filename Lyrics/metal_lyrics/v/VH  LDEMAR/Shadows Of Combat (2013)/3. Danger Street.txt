You meet with fire
The never ending masquerade
Kingdom of dreams
Angel of death I can see

Let me die, die like a man
Let me die now!

Danger street! Cross only at night!
Danger street! This is a danger street!

Crossing the limits
I am losing control
Don't care about
What's going on
Reminding the words
The old man said yesterday
Nothing to loose
'Cause you are lost in the flood

Let me die, die like a man
Let me die now!

Danger street! Cross only at night!
Danger street! This is a danger street!

Let me die, die like a man
Let me die now!

Danger street! Cross only at night!
Danger street! This is a danger street!
