I just need heavy metal everyday
Raising hell it will be my guide

Only the stars tonight
Give me the chance tonight
Metal slaves me I am flying free

Heavy metal is all that I need
Sounds of battle running through my veins
The power of the night

Fear in me 'cause I've got the right
Bleed for me fighting for the rock

Only the stars tonight
Give me the peace tonight
If you want it or if you've got the balls

Heavy metal is all that I need
Sounds of battle running through my veins
The power of the night

Hell will be waiting I'm the old man
Something is calling bang my head

Heavy metal is all that I need
Sounds of battle running through my veins
The power of the night
