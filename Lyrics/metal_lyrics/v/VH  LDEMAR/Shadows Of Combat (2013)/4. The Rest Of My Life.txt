Side by side they will come
Stand alone got nothing to loose
In the end I'll be free again
Raise my head now head up to the sky

Turn your heart to stone
With anger and rage
Over the rainbow

I'm the one yeah you can't replace
No more demons in my head

Until till the rest of my life
Leave me alone
I'll wait just for another call
Come with me, I need you to stay
Find another fool or come

Late at night take me now
Through the dark of your bleeding heart
Understand I'm looking for one
If you are waiting and ready for love

I've been dreaming for
For a thousand years
Over the rainbow

Until till the rest of my life
Leave me alone
I'll wait just for another call
Come with me, I need you to stay
Find another fool or come

Until till the rest of my life
Leave me alone
I'll wait just for another call
Come with me, I need you to stay
Find another fool or come
