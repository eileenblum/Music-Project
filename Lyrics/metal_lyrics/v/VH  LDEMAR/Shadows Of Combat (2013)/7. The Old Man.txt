All we know you rule the night
You're the day you are the light
You are the man you are the warrior

Came to me when I needed you
Far away you keep on fight
You feel so great you are the old man

Look at the sky
You feel some sins in your mind
I'm the father and the son
You are my name it's my fate

The stars are shining in the night
Dream's just a dream one empty heart
We fight to stay alive tonight, everyday!

Time is gone but you don't care
The time is yours it will never end
I feel the sound of metal of the world

Hand of fate the final line
Bring the day bring on the night
You win the fight you are the old king

I hear a sound
The voices out in the dark
I'm doing alright
I'm standing there let me die

The stars are shining in the night
Dream's just a dream one empty heart
We fight to stay alive tonight, everyday!

Hear you scream across the universe
Tonight you will stand alone

The stars are shining in the night
Dream's just a dream one empty heart
We fight to stay alive tonight, everyday!
We fight to stay alive tonight
One empty heart
One empty heart
