It's the end of the world...

Be like the wind running everyday
Imaginations heretics fall
I made a deal with the devil in the line
Revelations come resurrection's near

I'm on the wire
Black hand of fate
How far I've fallen to win

It's the end of the night
You will run out with me
You will never win

Running down the highway singing all my songs
You have to meet me at the riverside
Ready for the battle ready for the night
When the moon is full and the way is dark

Unsatisfied
Devil must die
Looking for the devil to kill!

It's the end of the world
I will stand by your side
You take my hand

It's the end of the night
You will run out with me
You will never win
