Hey you slaves of the grave
I am the father of
All that you know
You are moving fast
Legend on my back

Reminds the words that
You heard yesterday
Tonight I swear I'm playing my
Rules and I'll never stop

Black thunder, black thunder
Black thunder will be waiting
We're going dying to your way
Black thunder, black thunder
Black thunder will be waiting
We'll be the riders on the night
That's what I want

No more please me no more
I'm gonna live a life what I feel
You are full of rage
Help me to understand

It's my farewell, no way to overcame
Fly up tonight the thunder is
Coming prepares to attack

Black thunder, black thunder
Black thunder will be waiting
We're going dying to your way
Black thunder, black thunder
Black thunder will be waiting
We'll be the riders on the night
That's what I want

Black thunder, black thunder
Black thunder will be waiting
We're going dying to your way
Black thunder, black thunder
Black thunder will be waiting
We'll be the riders on the night
That's what I want
Black thunder...
