Once upon a time there was an old king
And he told me his visions

Fist up in the air
Hail to the old man
Agony visions come for all of us

War is like a tear
Falling down again
But I know Vhaldemar is the savior

Conquer another land
Another piece of land
Conquer another land
Visions rebirth

Conquer another land
Another piece of land
Conquer another land
Looking at the wolves

Song of the king
King of the light
Fire at night
Song of the king
King of the light
Fire at night

See my face again
Terror mutilate
On the edge take me please far away

Conquer another land
Another piece of land
Conquer another land
Looking at the wolves

Song of the king
King of the light
Fire at night
Song of the king
King of the light
Fire at night

When I hold the night
Like the wolves, like the wolves
Old king's visions come
In my mind

Song of the king
King of the light
Fire at night
Song of the king
King of the light
Fire at night
