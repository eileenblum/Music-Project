Spending all my money
Looking for a fight
Yeah till the morning light

Border in the limits
Riffle in my hands
I will never return

A game with the devil
Looking for the speed
Heavy metal thatâs all that I need

Hey say living free tonight
Are you ready running free tonight

Veins are full of metal
Injected by the sound
Yeah soldiers of the death

Now I have no problems
Now I have no fear
I like heavy metal sound

When I meet the maker
I will say "Thank you"
Heavy metal thatâs all that I need

Hey say living free tonight
Are you ready running free tonight

Spending all my money
Looking for a fight
Yeah till the morning light

Border in the limits
Riffle in my hands
I will never return

A game with the devil
Looking for the speed
Heavy metal thatâs all that I need

Hey say living free tonight
Are you ready running free tonight
