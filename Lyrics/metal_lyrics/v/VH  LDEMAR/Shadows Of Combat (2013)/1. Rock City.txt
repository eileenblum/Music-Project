I was born in a paradise
And times went by
No better home for you and me
When I hear the music plays

I play in the heart of the city
I don't like remains
I wanna rock and shake you down
Rock city controls my fate

Try so hard in the city, fly away
Face the truth put the past behind my way

You're dreaming you can feel my nation
You know it there is nothing more
And tell me why now I feel I never win
You're dreaming you can feel my nation
You know it there is nothing more

All we are brothers of the past
Demons of time
Can it be real tearing apart
Under the guiding stars

Try so hard in the city, fly away
Face the truth put the past behind my way

You're dreaming you can feel my nation
You know it there is nothing more
And tell me why now I feel I never win
You're dreaming you can feel my nation
You know it there is nothing more

Rock city, rock city, rock rock
Rock city, rock rock city

You're dreaming you can feel my nation
You know it there is nothing more
And tell me why now I feel I never win
You're dreaming you can feel my nation
You know it there is nothing more

Rock city, rock city, rock rock
Rock city, rock rock city
