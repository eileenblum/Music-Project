2 in the morning
City's slept
Among the buildings
A dense fog, you cannot see

Ten meters under
Where you stand
A sinister being
Has been centuries in lethargy

Appeared in a mine
And took some ugly lifes
Years later was dominated
And sent back to darkness

[Chorus:]
Bear skin, lion teeth
Human eater, pure instinct
Fear bringer, you will run
but it's faster than you...

It's a nightmare but it's real
Years later was dominated
Run away or takes your life
It's the BLACK BEAST

[Chorus]

It was professed
As the final plague
Now a chance of destiny
Makes it come back

[Chorus]
