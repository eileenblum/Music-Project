This is the 1366
This is the brave son of a king
Born to extend his power
And to reign vastest lands
Since he was a child
Educated to raze
But inside him ther was a mind
Nothing to see with the rest
He looked at the stars
and saw fantasy hills
when he started to reign
he started to dream

[Chorus:]
Conquer another
Conquer another piece of land
Conquer another
Conquer another vastest lands
Conquer another
Conquer another another men
Conquer another
Conquer another heart

This is the 1366
This is the brave son of a king
Born to extend his power
And to reign vastest lands
when he started to reing
he started to dream

[Chorus:]
Conquer anohter
Conquer another piece of land
Conquer another
Conquer another vastest lands
Conquer another
Conquer another another men
Conquer another
Conquer another heart
