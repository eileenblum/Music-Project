Trust is growing, words are running
Feelings change your points of view
Yeah!!!

Veins are burning, sweat is falling
Faith raises the loyalty
Dreams are flowing, liquid feelings
Break you!!!

Try to mend your previous times,
Your dreams are longer than your time
Mix your blood with gold and fire
And fight out!!!

Tunders bursting, wind is burning
Mind is turning sensitive
Lights spinning, gaseous feelings
Break you!!!
Try to mend your previous times,
Your dreams are longer than your time
Mix your blood with gold and fire
And fight out!!!

Sometimes I feel nothing can help me
Sometimes I need to break my routine
Someone told me the only solution
Fill up your life with... HEAVY METAL!!!!!
