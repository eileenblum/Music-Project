VhÃ¤ldemar the old man
It's an illusion or confusion
Read the words! Feel the sign!
No more illusions, VhÃ¤ldemar's here.
Tonight

I try to find something alive in
VhÃ¤ldemar's soul, but I can't see
So turn on the light

Light of illusion or a confusion
No! Catch me on the other side
Light of illusion or a confusion

I learnt to hate now I'm smiling
In VhÃ¤ldemar's world I try to see
(but I can't) So turn on the light

Light of illusion or a confusion
No! Catch me on the other side
Light of illusion or a confusion
No! VhÃ¤ldemar's here tonight!

VhÃ¤ldemar's hatred
Runs through my veins
Feeling the pain in my mind
Why am I here?

Why am I here walkin' and alone?
I'' find the truth in VhÃ¤ldemar's soul

VhÃ¤ldemar the old man
It's an illusion or confusion
Read the words! Feel the sign!
No more illusions, VhÃ¤ldemar's here.
Tonight

He is saying I could be the next
Who falls down
I'll be the one who cares of
VhÃ¤ldemar's words
Black dreamers and black feelings
Tonight Pain

Pain
The bodies are burning
That's the price of their sins
They know that hell will be waiting
And they will be crying for eternity
