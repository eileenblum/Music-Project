Nowadays there's a voice of madness
In front of my heart and now...

In the street I can see people
Playin'with guns in this game
But this,oh! this fight, It's burning
Like fire I play by the mace

I'm a revenger
I'm a soldier of pain
But I see you are blind
I'm a revenger I'm a soldier of pain
'Cuase I'm not the blind

I'll die one day when the Gods
Take their weapons in hands
But if I reborn again open your eyes
'Cause I'm here and...

[Chorus:]
I'm a revenger
I'm a soldier of pain
But I see you are blind
I'm a revenger I'm a soldier of pain
'Cause I'm not the blind

Nowadays ther is a voice of madness
In front of my heart and now It's hidden
Save you and you'll sign from another time
Everywher in the lost world.Ha,ha,ha !!!!!!
