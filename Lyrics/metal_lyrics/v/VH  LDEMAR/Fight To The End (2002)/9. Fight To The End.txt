You don't remember
When we're making love
Feeling the sun and the wind

I was too young
To understand
But now I forget I don't care

To serve! The reign of madness
To fight! To the end of the night
Until the dark forgets me
Fight to the end!

You don't remember
When wizards and kings
Called the spirits of doom

I'll be the man
Who breaks the war
I am the man who believes

To serve! The reign of madness
To fight! To the end of the night
Until the dark forgets me
Fight to the end!

Oh, oh, oh, oh! Wil you cry for
Fallen angels?
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Fallen angels
Fight for you now

You don't remember
When we're making love
Feeling the sun and the wind

I was too young
To understand
But now I forget I don't care

To serve! The reign of madness
To fight! To the end of the night
Until the dark forgets me
Fight to the end!

Oh, oh, oh, oh! Wil you cry for
Fallen angels?
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Fallen angels
Fight for you now
