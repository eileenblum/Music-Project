Someone
Who had my confidence
Someone
I knew from my birth
Kill you!!!!

Nothing else I want
You're going to pay
The treason you made

Traitor
We were blood brothers
Traitor
I saved you from bad times
Traitor
you forgot your feelings
You took that foul money
You're gonna regret now!!!!!

Traitor
We were blood brothers
Traitor

You took that foul money
You're gonna regret now!!!!!

Traitor
We were blood brothers
Traitor
I saved you from bad times
Traitor

You must die!!!!
