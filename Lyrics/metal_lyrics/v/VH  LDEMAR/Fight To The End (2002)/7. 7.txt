Feel the black pain in your head
While I'm blastin'you down

Don't be liar
Don't be wrong
She's the one

Turn your head back and see
the shadow of death

Don't be liar
Don't be wrong
She's the one

Your blood burns after the war
It seems like an elegy lake

Don't be liar
Don't be wrong
She's the one

It seems like fear but
We wanna live in the dark
Shadow of pain, beatin'the land

It seems like fear but
We wana live in the dark (side)
