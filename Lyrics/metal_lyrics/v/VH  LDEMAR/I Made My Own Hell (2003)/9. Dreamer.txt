[Music by: Pedro J. Monge; Lyrics by: Carlos Escudero]

Dreamer!!!

I'm walking around and thinking about
Old glory days
Whore the Gods prevailed
And they're fightin' again for all our dreams

Now you can play with my dreams
And now it s time to be free
Searching the truth in my eyes
I've been a dreamer all over the years

Dreamer, dreamer, dreamer...
For us all, for us all, for us all

I open my eyes and I see the moonlight
Over the hill
It's a misers night
Where my promise comes true
And you'll pay the price

Crying for a change in the air
This is a dark paradise
Missing in action again
And I'll be the dreamer all over the years

Dreamer, dreamer, dreamer...
For us all, for us all, for us all

Now you can play with my dreams
And now it's time to be free

Searching the truth in my eyes
I've been a dreamer all over the years

Dreamer, dreamer, dreamer...
For us all, for us all, for us all
