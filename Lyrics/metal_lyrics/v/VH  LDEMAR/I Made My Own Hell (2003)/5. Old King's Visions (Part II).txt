[Music by: Pedro J. Monge; Lyrics by: Carlos Escudero]

Secrets of sorrow
Drive me insane
There is a silence
Above my head

And now I know what I see

It's an emotion
Running away
A voice of an evil
Deferes my death

And here I am to believe
In a magic bell
That takes me away

[Vhaldemar:]
"For all eternity, many million miles far away,
There is a dark land of hope where there is a big magic bell
At the great mountain with a long way to the top;
There will be the magic bell!
If you play it, a brave sound can give you the power to rebirth
And come back your brothers to the life
And there will come your revenge"

Secrets of sorrow
Drive me insane
There is a silence
Above my head

And here I am to believe
In a magic bell
That takes me away

Mountain halved
By my hand of war
This could he the last time
For me and for my empire [2]

I'll toll the hell
And I'll take my revenge
Now I feel the sound is real
Words passing by,
The power is mine
And I'll take my revenge
