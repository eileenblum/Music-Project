[Music by: Pedro J. Monge; Lyrics by: Carlos Escudero)

If you're looking for a dream
In the past you couldn't find it
If you're looking for a dream
You must tight forever here

Revenger, an arrow
Revenger 'cause an arrow
Those preachers called me Satan
Forever here in wasted land

If you're looking for a nightmare
Here is a long wrong way
Just take another direction
Hear the voice and you will be...

Revenger, an arrow
Revenger 'cause an arrow
A black wish called me Satan
I can get it only if I just break

All the rules!
Breaking all the rules!
All the rules!
Breaking all the rules!

There's an animal in me
Who decides my destination
Here is my domation
It's my time, tonight it's calling

Revenger, an arrow
Revenger 'cause an arrow
Revenger, an arrow
Revenger 'cause an arrow
