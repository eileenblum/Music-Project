Looking from this tower
Hate and fear cover my lands
Wind is talking to me
Pain and sorrow invade my heart

Hopeless destiny!!
Erratic glance over my realm

PeopleÂ´s loosing faith and walking blind,
While sun has fallen
And darkness covers their lands
Rain of poisoned waters burn my fields
While fogÂ´s arrived
And storm is beating my heart

Eagles fly above me
I can see through incoming storm
Blood is flowing hotter
Blaze of fury IÂ´m gonna wield

I will raise my fist!!
Revenge and death will be my command

Gods of Metal give me strength enough
To kill`em all, and take damnation away
Last drop of blood I will sweat
until rebellionÂ´s raised and my steel triumphs again

Looking from this tower
Hate and fear cover my lands
Wind is talking to me
Pain and sorrow invade my heart

I will raise my fist!!
Revenge and death will be my command

Gods of Metal, give me strength enough
To kill`em all, and take damnation away
Last drop of blood I will sweat
until rebellionÂ´s raised and my steel triumphs again
