[Music by: Pedro J. Monge; Lyrics by: Carlos Escudero, Pedro J. Monge]

From dark ages
Lost in dark times
A path of death
A path of life
I made my own hell

I was living
In a dark line
When I heard that sound
Appearin' (in) an open sky
Master of the Universe I'll fly
Master of the Universe I'll die

Killing for life
Living for death
My destruction I signed

I was living
In a dark line
Your lime has come
You will die!

Master of tile Universe I'll fly
Master of the Universe I'll die

Now I in wailing for
For a travel through the sky
Revelations!
In the middle of the night
Through the sky! [2]

From dark ages!
Lost in dark times!
