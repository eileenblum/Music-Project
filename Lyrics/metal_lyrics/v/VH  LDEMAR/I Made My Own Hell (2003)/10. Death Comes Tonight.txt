[Music by: Pedro J. Monge; Lyrics by: Carlos Escudero, Pedro J. Monge, David Fernandez]

Just a fact of loyalty
Took me to this site
Can I reach my liberty
Screaming for a fight

Just Metal!
Just fight!!!
Souls burning
Death comes tonight!

Black leather!
Just fight!!!
Head banging
Death comes tonight!

Courage and pride, now
Guide me to the fight
The pact is done
I'm in Hell!!!

Black leather
Spikes
Head banging
Metal conies tonight

Ready for another fight
Metal is my path
Satan takes my soul tonight
Cross the bridge of death

Just Metal!
Just fight!!!
Souls burning
Death comes tonight!

Crawls your pain
The faith is great
Black sorrows in your head

At the end
You'll burn in hell
Black sorrows in your head

Ready for another fight
Metal is my path
Satan takes my soul tonight
Cross the bridge of death

Just Metal!
Just fight!!!
Souls burning
Look out
Just Metal!
Just light!!!
Souls burning
Death comes tonight!!!
