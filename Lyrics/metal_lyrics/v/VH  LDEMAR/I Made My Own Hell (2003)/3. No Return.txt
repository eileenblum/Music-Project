[Music by: Pedro J. Monge, Carlos Escudero; Lyrics by: Carlos Escudero, Pedro J. Monge]

Well listen to me now
Try to understand
In this holy world
Where I am trapped

I'm the oldest
And I realize
About the pact we made
Where I am sick and lost

I hate your wishes
I want your pain
All my life with you
I made my own hell

No return
I won't be with you forever
No return
Anymore!
[2]

Keep out of my life
I'll kill you next time
Forget I exist
I'm no one for you

No return
I won't be with you forever
No return
Anymore!
