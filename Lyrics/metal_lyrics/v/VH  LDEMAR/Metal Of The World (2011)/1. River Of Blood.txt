I get up in the morning always feeling sick
When I look at the window everything is the same

You know the love is gone
You gotta live it everyday
I'm glad you're alive
I relentless as the rain

There's a river of blood
And this blood is mine and yours
It's my destiny I'll have to try

All I want to stand with
Heavy metal everyday
'Cause this sound always take me away

Waiting for tomorrow, everything's the same
It's the judgement day, really I don't care

Blow away the lies they tell
You know I live in hell
I will be running
The lost forgotten tales

There's a river of blood
And this blood is mine and yours
It's my destiny I'll have to try

All I want to stand with
Heavy metal everyday
'Cause this sound always take me away

Give me your words and cry

I thought I was born in a paradise
Times went by and now I say goodbye

There's a river of blood
And this blood is mine and yours
It's my destiny I'll have to try

All I want to stand with
Heavy metal everyday
'Cause this sound always take me away
