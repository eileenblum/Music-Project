Two in the morning the black beast returns
I've got feelings and the energy
I am the Old King a soldier of pain
Fighting to the End

Searching for my dreams
Since I was a child
Ready for another fight
Visions of the King
Just show me the way

Sun goes down moon raises strong
Time has come out it's sound and black magic
Music plays son of the King
Give me some metal I want just a dream

Traitors in Bastards and dusty road
There's no return tonight when you eat death
This is my nightmare I made my own hell
I want to kill 'em all

[Chorus]
