War comes to war at the edge of the stars
For the man who will follow the blind
Walking alone facing the truth
Living day by day

In the day when I will reign the madness will prevail
Fire dance and holy demons it's all I will see
Winds of tomorrow come to my hand
Saints of hell! They will be in my single paradise

War comes to war at the edge of the stars
For the man who will follow the blind
Walking alone facing the truth
Living day by day

Secret signs and sacred games sound all over the sea
Ships of war and fire weapons all is by my command
Forces of darkness cannot resist
Saints of hell! They will be in my single paradise

War comes to war at the edge of the stars
For the man who will follow the blind
Walking alone facing the truth
Living day by day

Walking alone facing the truth
Living day by day
