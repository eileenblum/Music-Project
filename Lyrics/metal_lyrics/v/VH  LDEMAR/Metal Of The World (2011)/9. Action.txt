Won't you say you will be there with me

Looking for some action, running everyday
I've got a gun pointed at your heart
Keep my motor roaring speed on and on
You drive me crazy but it's all that I want

I'm not a protector for you or someone else
I'm looking for action looking at yourself
I am the man forged by the fire
Who's singing in the midnight calling the wind

I'm gonna get you
You are in the dark days of your life
Holy sacrifice is waiting for you and me

Is a dream? I'll be there
I don't want to say goodbye
Ride by night through the sky
Won't you say you will be there with me

Now I'm calling you with violence and hate
I am the rider it's only just begun
Spirit of the man who never walks alone
I think I'm sure you always be there

I'm gonna get you
You are in the dark days of your life
Holy sacrifice is waiting for you and me

Is a dream? I'll be there
I don't want to say goodbye
Ride by night through the sky
Won't you say you will be there with me
