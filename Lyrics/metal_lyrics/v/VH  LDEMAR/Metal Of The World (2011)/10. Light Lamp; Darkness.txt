Never fight alone
I'm always by your side
In darkness you will cry
My name is Lucifer

The shadows will stand
Everything will be the same
Surrender! The hell was forged for me

Louded places where we'll go
I think the hell it is my home
There's a reason for this world
Light and darkness near at the end

I never fight alone
Don't listen evil words
My mind is waiting for
Heavy metal realize

Let's sing this battle song
And the fear will go away
We never gonna look back
Always straight ahead

Louded places where we'll go
I think the hell it is my home
There's a reason for this world
Light and darkness near at the end

Are you there? Walking around
Give up the darklands and get ready to die
Are you there? Walking around
Give up the hopelands or get ready to die

Let's fight

Louded places where we'll go
I think the hell it is my home
There's a reason for this world
Light and darkness near at the end
