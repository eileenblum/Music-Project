We're living in vain in nowhere
My bed is a grave
I'm a prisoner of darkness
Just a reward

In the dark I'll be sacrificed
If I'll die oh that's the end

My soul is waiting for descend
And now I will rest maybe in the dark

We're fighting against the power
The power is mine
We are like the thunder
Thunder and light

Oh my train it comes from the storm
Wild hearts tell me I am wrong

My soul is waiting for descend
Wild hearts I will rest maybe in the dark
