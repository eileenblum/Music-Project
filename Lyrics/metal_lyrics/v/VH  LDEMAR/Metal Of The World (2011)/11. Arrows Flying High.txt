You can play with fire and ice
You can play with me
I just see your evil eyes
Try to follow me

Like an eagle flying in a storm
I can't see the reason why

Forty days and forty nights
Hey you've got to breathe
I can see this heartless town
Here nobody wins

Like a soldier in the battlefield
When the arrows flying high

Have no way to come back
Only fight for you now
There's a flame inside me
And I gettin' crazy
In my way... in my way...

I was standing in the winter
Like you I will die
Just one look and a whisper
When it's time to go

Like a soldier in the battlefield
When the arrows flying high

Have no way to come back
Only fight for you now
There's a flame inside me
And I gettin' crazy
In my way... in my way...

Have no days for living
Only time for black death
Hear eternal voices
Black words of fire

Burn me, you keep on trying
I feel you hate me
Maybe I'm born again
