You feel the sound is real
You give all night by night
Finger on the trigger
Really I don't care
If you've got a problem
Living on the edge

There comes another winter
You know I live in hell
My finger's on the trigger
Going down tonight to beat

The bastards!
You know they come from the dark
Bastards!
I say I've got new dreams to touch everyday

At night I go to bed
Looking for a place to land

If you count tomorrows
Maybe nothing at all
When the day is over
I've got the strength of ten

Some like to drink or gamble
Some like just to pass the time
I ain't looking for trouble
I just wanna change to beat

The bastards!
You know they come from the dark
Bastards!
I say I've got new dreams to touch everyday

Finger on the trigger
Really I don't care
If you've got a problem
Living on the edge to beat
