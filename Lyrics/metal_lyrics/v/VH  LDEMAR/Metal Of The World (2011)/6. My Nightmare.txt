Waiting for the nightmare there's no other way
This time you've got to fight alone
All the sleepless nights falling into madness
You cry for a helping hand

You must to know you're not the only one
Everybody walk the line

There's no heaven from above
At the hell is always going on
They make the wars they make their laws
Power in the evil hands

Waiting for the sunrise waves are getting high
We shot right between the eyes
I have seen the future still feel the pain
Tonight there's no going back

You must revel my friend it's time for you
You will never find the way

There's no heaven from above
At the hell is always going on
They make the wars they make their laws
Power in the evil hands

You must to know
You're not the only one
Everybody walk the line

There's no heaven from above
At the hell is always going on
They make the wars they make their laws
Power in the evil hands

We make the wars
We make their laws
We are the ones who never fall
