Everyday sound the thunders
With the power of my old friends
Undertaker is working too hard
Always goin' on

Looking for the real future
Like a hungry runaway
Desperate as the night moves on
Red in my eyes

You're the men I'm the mirror
I wanna hear your voices louder
Louder than you'll never hear them
Storming the night

I'm sick and tired of your words
Always goin' on
Always goin' on
Look at yourself you must win
Always goin' on, always goin' on

Heavy metal! Metal of the world
Heavy metal! Metal of the world

I hear cry the angels
They are cryin' from the darkness
Outside the street's on fire
We will going on

I'm sick and tired of your words
Always goin' on
Always goin' on
Look at yourself you must win
Always goin' on, always goin' on

Heavy metal! Metal of the world
Heavy metal! Metal of the world
Heavy metal! Metal of the world
Heavy metal! Metal of the world
