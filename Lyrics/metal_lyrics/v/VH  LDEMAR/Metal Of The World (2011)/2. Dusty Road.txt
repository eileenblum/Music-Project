Calling the demons of the night
Crusades and battles are my way
Uh! Raise my cup where the black rivers flow
The time has come for you and me

Maybe tomorrow I'll be fighting with you
I just want to hear you scream 'til the end of time

Dusty road with the wind
We'll never die
Let the day go away in a land of dreams
With the clouds in the sky
Is the widest way... dusty road

Crossing the seven seas of tears
My train is coming from the storm
Uh! It's my hope, it's my life falling down
I swear I never let you go

The crowd is hungry with their swords in hands
I just want to ride with you across the dusty road

Dusty road with the wind
We'll never die
Let the day go away in a land of dreams
With the clouds in the sky
Is the widest way... dusty road
