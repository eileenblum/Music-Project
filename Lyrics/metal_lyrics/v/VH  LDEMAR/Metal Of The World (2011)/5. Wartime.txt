I hear you calling, calling for me
A war of dust and the chosen dreams
You are the mirror I am the man
We'll stand united always carry on

Final wishes, legends growin' up
I'm a prisoner
In a prison running everytime
Not a prison, open up your mind
Dying everytime

Rain is falling like tears of blood
A realm of death, the souls really gone
Inside I'm writing tryin' in vain
To feel the breakdown looking for my eyes

Not real, but killing is so near
What heroes? You are by my side
In the mirror can find the game so clear
Get out there! You walk all over them
This time will be the end

Wartime! This is the time for the wartime
It's time to fight
Wartime! It's the wartime, it's your fate
It is wartime

Not real, but killing is so near
What heroes? You are by my side
In a prison I'll get insanity
There is no prison, no prison for me
If you are by my side
