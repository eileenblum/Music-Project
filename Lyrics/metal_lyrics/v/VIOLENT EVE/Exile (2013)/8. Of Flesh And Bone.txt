Of Flesh and Bone
Mankind
Trapped into this violent
Cycle of aggression
Holding our possessions
we're worried of

I just don't care
if you're on pain
I will be fine
I am the dog
That rules your world
Leading your disgrace
Of flesh and bone!!

From a sick society
Egoism feed the soil
Succeed to be disgusting
Is what we're focused on

I just don't care
if you're on pain
I will be fine
Mankind!!!
I am the dog
That rules your world
Leading your disgrace
like me
trust me
to win
Mankind!!!

That's how we think we are
We feel like emperors
Collosal ego to define
We're insignificant

Insignificant

I just don't care
if you're on pain
I will be fine
Mankind!!!
I am the dog
That rules your world
Leading your disgrace
like me
trust me
to win
Mankind!!!

Of Flesh
and Bone
We're flesh
Rot
