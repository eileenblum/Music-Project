No reason to be forgotten
By mankind long time ago
Broken rules he had no choice
Captive in no help from God

Now it is time return his hate
all the anger
Eternal rage

Bouncing souls
Scream from depths
Of the earth
Meaningless

Bloodlust
Revenge
Its the only thing left after
What remains when there is nothing left
What lives in depths of humanity
Locked up long time ago
Dont know if his eyes will see the end
And feels no pain at all
And don't forget to do not forgive

Bloodlust
your mind
your womb
Cruelly
Bloodlust
Bloodlust
your mind
your womb
Will be slaked

Bloodlust
Revenge
Its the only thing left after
What remains when there is nothing left
What lives in depths of humanity
Locked up long time ago
Dont know if his eyes will see the end
And feels no pain at all
And don't forget to do not forgive

Pain
Pain
Die
At least
Will slaked

Bloodlust
Revenge
Its the only thing left after the end of all
What remains when there is nothing left
What lives in depths of humanity
Locked up long time ago
Dont know if his eyes will see the end
And feels no pain at all
Don't forget to not forgive
