Seven in the morning, no light
I woke up feeling so strange
Something cold was calling me
Tried to wake her up
But she was deep asleep
Fear in me
My child was crying silence

This cannot be real
But the day has come
Finally it is here
Suffocated in anguish

I looked through the broken window
All was full of powder
Floating in the air
Black sun prevailing
Black sun obscuring my life
Darkness trying to
Conquer this empty soul

This cannot be real
But the day has come
Finally it is here
Suffocated in anguish
Dark eyes blind
White light denied

Through the darkest day
We know how cynic we've been
Through the darkest day
We beg for mercy to god
Through the darkest day
We realize how painful it is
To live longer than our beloved

The darkest day of my life
My life

Run away
Eternal pain
I feel betrayed
by my own fate
Broken mind
Dying to stay
falling down
to the ground

Gone through this
My love destroyed
The morning star
Against my will

Through the darkest day
We know how cynic we've been
Through the darkest day
We beg for mercy to god
Through the darkest day
We realize how painful it is
To live longer than our beloved
