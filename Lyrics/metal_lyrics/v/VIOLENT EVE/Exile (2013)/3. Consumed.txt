IN A TINY PLANET
CONSUMED BY NOTHINGNESS
WE'RE BORN IN THE MIDST OF PAIN
WE GOT SICK, WE MAKE OTHERS SUFFER

OTHERS ARE BORN
TO RESTART THIS USELESS COMEDY
REMOVING MILLIONS OF THORNS
PROUD TO BE ANGRY

LIVING CONSISTS
IN BUILDING FUTURE MEMORIES
DYING TO RESIST

SOME DAY WE'LL BE BURNING
A KINGDOM RULED BY GLOWING SOULS
THE FLAMES OF HOPELESSNESS
INVOLVING MIRACLES

THE LIE WE LIVE IN
IS FULL OF ANONYMOUS CRIES
WE BELONG TO A DESERT

OF INDIFFERENT STARS, WE'RE FALLING
INTO THE ABYSS OF NOTHINGNESS

I TRUST MORE IN DEATH
THAN IN LIFE
THOSE WHO ARE NO LONGER
FROM OUTSIDE

THEY ADVISE ME
THEY CONDEMN ME
THEY LIE TO ME
I INVOKE THE SAINTS TO GUIDE ME TONIGHT

SOME DAY WE'LL BE BURNING
A KINGDOM RULED BY GLOWING SOULS
THE FLAMES OF HOPELESSNESS
INVOLVING MIRACLES

THE LIE WE LIVE IN
IS FULL OF ANONYMOUS CRIES
WE BELONG TO A DESERT
OF INDIFFERENT STARS, WE'RE FALLING
INTO THE ABYSS OF NOTHINGNESS

CONSUMED BY NOTHINGNESS

I CONDEMN YOU
TO ETERNAL LIFE
FEELLING EMPTY AND DISARMED
THE LIE WE LIVE IN
IS FULL OF ANONYMOUS CRIES
WE BELONG TO A DESERT
OF INDIFFERENT STARS, WE'RE FALLING
INTO THE ABYSS OF NOTHINGNESS

CONSUMED BY NOTHINGNESS
