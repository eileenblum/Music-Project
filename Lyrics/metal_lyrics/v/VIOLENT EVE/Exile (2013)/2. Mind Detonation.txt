Living in this land
sharing with rats
They lead us astray
to rip our entrails

Out
To feed
their huge
Fucking guts

Cheaters and leechers
Sorrounding me
instigators
of misery

Mind detonation
makes me sick
makes me bleed
Mind detonator
makes me sick
makes me bleed

Now on TV
All i can see
Brainless bitches
they're venomous for me

Hide
the truth
Filling lifes
with fuckin lies

Mind detonation
makes me sick
makes me bleed
Mind detonator
makes me sick
makes me bleed

So when the time has comes
-the truth
Filling lifes
with fuckin lies

So when the time comes
You better run away
Exile to a far place
Where we cannot
See you anymore
Die alone
As you deserve
I Hope so
