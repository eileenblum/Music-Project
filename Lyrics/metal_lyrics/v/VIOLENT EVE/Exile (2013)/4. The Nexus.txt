Crossing the path in this life
of untouchable dreams
Fate has chosen us
I can see light in our hands

The time is mine (you see, you feel, you think)
the burden
is yours carry it in your hands
sight, don't lie
and never look back

I feel the strength
of a thousand stars
nothing can stop us on this run
I'll face everything in my way

The time is mine (you see, you feel, you think)
the burden
is yours carry it on your hands
sight, don't lie
and never look back

We will touch the sun someday
Walking the nexus now and rising up
Decided in this theater of life
To stay (therefore)
No one can stop me now

We will touch the sun someday
Walking the nexus now and rising up
Decided in this theater of life
To stay (therefore)
No one can stop me now

Thrown into this river to die
Black water drowning me so deep
Mud pull me down
I'll not fall
into oblivion
No way

We will touch the sun someday
Walking the nexus now and rising up
Decided in this theater of life
To stay (therefore)
No one can stop me now
