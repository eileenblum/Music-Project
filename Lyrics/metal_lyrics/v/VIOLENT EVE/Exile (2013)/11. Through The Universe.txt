WE, WE'RE SLIME-COVERED
NOW LOYALTY IS SHATTERED

A TRIP
THROUGH THE DARKNESS
I WALK BLINDLY
AND FIND NO TRUTH
SADNESS
IS FILLING
THIS WHOLE WORLD
OF USELESS YOUTH

IN RIVERS
OF MEANESS
I'M DROWNING
MY DREAMS ARE DEPLETED

ASKING
FOR A CALLING
TO SAVE US
FROM MONSTROSITY

HANDS TIED
MOUTH CLOSED
LIKE THEY
WANT US
ANGRY
THIRSTY
VENGEANCE
UNABLE TO LIVE

IS THIS THE PLACE WHERE I BELONG? LOST THROUGH THE UNIVERSE
IS THIS THE LAST TIME TO REPENT? LOST THROUGH THE UNIVERSE
