TALES OF THE HUNT OF A NEWBORN FEARED BY ALL
INSIDE THE CELL LIE THE WASTED LIVES
PRAYERS AT A FUNERAL THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE IN LIFE
WORDS DON'T DEFINE HOW MUCH IT HURTS

WHEN NIGHT COMES THE WOLVES BEGIN TO HOWL
TO HOWL NON STOP
ACROSS THE FOG YOUR SOUL EXPIRES

OLD WISHES, PRECAST FEELINGS, THE ENDLESS FIGHT
THE HOPE IS GONE
I'VE SEEN THE OLD MAN
I'VE SMELT HIS FEAR BY MY SIDE
I'VE HEARD THAT HORROR TALES OF PAIN
ABOUT THE ATROCITY BY MYSELF
MEAN THE LAMBS CRYING THROUGH YOUR DREAMS

HATE
THIS WORLD INFECTED
BORN TO BE DEAD IN LIFE
A WORLD OF RAGE
WAIT FOR ME
TOGETHER WE WILL DIE

YOUR HUMAN RAGE
JUST A MIRAGE
WAKE UP AND PRAY
I'M HERE TO STAY

OLD WISHES, PRECAST FEELINGS, THE ENDLESS FIGHT
THE HOPE IS GONE
I'VE SEEN THE OLD MAN
I'VE SMELT HIS FEAR BY MY SIDE
I'VE HEARD THAT HORROR TALES OF PAIN
ABOUT THE ATROCITY BY MYSELF
MEAN THE LAMBS CRYING THROUGH YOUR DREAMS

HATE
THIS WORLD INFECTED
BORN TO BE DEAD IN LIFE
A WORLD OF RAGE
WAIT FOR ME
TOGETHER WE WILL DIE
