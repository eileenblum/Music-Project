You're my prey!!!
I'm the devourer, you just a piece of meat

Watching you!!!
You're nothing for me, just want to take your life

Take everything
To eat your body (raw)
To eat your brains (raw)
Your eyes (raw)
Belongs to me (raw)
Won't let you go

Here for long.
Hate you but I love it for what you give me

Look at me.
I hate myself so that's why I'll take your life

Take everything
To eat your body (raw)
To eat your brains (raw)
Your eyes (raw)
Belongs to me (raw)
Won't let you...

Leave or escape
Devourer
Your soul will be mine
Hold tight to my disguise
Wolf with convincing eyes
Run, Hide, how pathetic
Pray, cry, I'm the reaper
Hold tight to my disguise
Wolf with convincing...

Words, sharp to inflict the pain
So you'll say what I want you to say
I'll make you feel that you're all alone
So low that you'll be the perfect prey

I've always been a lie
I've always been a lie
A lie that you suffer inside
I'm the threat that rule your life

You think I can't
Take everything
To eat your body (raw)
To eat your brains (raw)
Your eyes (raw)
Belongs to me (raw)
Won't let you...

Leave or escape
Devourer
Your soul will be mine
Hold tight to my disguise
Wolf with convincing eyes
Run, Hide, how pathetic
Pray, cry, I'm the reaper
Hold tight to my disguise
Wolf with convincing...
