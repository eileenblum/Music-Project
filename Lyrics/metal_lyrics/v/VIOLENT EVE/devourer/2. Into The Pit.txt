Thick air don't let me breath
Dirty air don't let me breath
All that sorrounds me is crushing me down

Everything is black, my eyes are blind
Need to recover control of my life

Everyone came to smash me (down!)
You did your best to see me (down!)
But I will rise to a new (dawn!)
Now I will make you all fall

Into the....
Into the pit

You can scream
And you can cry
But no one will....hear your call

You maybe think you're here for them
But now you are buried alive
It's time to know the truth, the truth, cold truth
You must stop being a loser (wake up)
It is your turn to win (wake up)
Release all your anger for once and for all

Laugh in it's face, and spit it
Now!!!!!!!!!
Laugh at them - laught at them
Shout aloud - Shout aloud
Now I'm free- free
Nevermore!!! Nevermore!!!
