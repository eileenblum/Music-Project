Single frame, old n' forbidden 
Sick thoughts, truth nowadays 
Stolen life, killed the children 
lies and fire, shut up and obey 

We are the kings, you must be proud 
Do not fight, stay and smile 
Wait in line to bleed 
Lies, lies, through your life 
You only pray, coward stand and fight 
Your biblical clenched disease 
Is killing us 
Is killing us 

Somatic 
Somatic Nation Rise 
Somatic 
Wake up, live your life 

Kidnapped, in a state of mind 
You and your friends, trapped in the net (Trapped in the net) 
Detailed profile to keep you in sight 
A bunch of shit to cloud your mind 
What do you fear, this cannot hurt 
Just follow me, herd of lambs 
You will know, how to obey 
Don't think, just follow the way 
Or bear your shame, fall in disgrace
