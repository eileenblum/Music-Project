Feel their hands
Suffocating
Feel their lies
Working into your mind

Weapons of madness
Poisoned tongues
Drunked of Power
Bent to the throne

Corrupted priests of death

No, they don't wanna give health or love
No, don't want to see their children grow

Greed
People's suffering
just turn them on
Emperors
of their infected world

Corrupted monarchs of hell

Praying
to a rotten god
for a bunch of coins
stained in blood
Selling
their own souls
lending their hand
to the god from below

Scavengers
Seaching into dead flesh
Blackened hearts
Trying to ruin this land

Involved in chaos
in the judgement day
Will the winds of truth
rip their heads away

Corrupted priests of death
Corrupted monarchs of hell
