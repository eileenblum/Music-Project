Now open your eyes
try to breath
Now focus your gaze
to the infinite

See no light
see no dark
your senses seem to work
just a delusion more

Bound
Caged
into a million cells

Feed the worm
fly through the unknown

Ageless
Timeless
passed away and
borned again

Ageless
Timeless
passed away and
borned again

Searching inside my mind
and find nothing at all

Searching outside this worm
just to crash on the wall

Universe
I can feel your weight

Sunken into the flux
try to breath
commited to death
silence breaks

Shout
spit your soul
enjoy a new sight
of this black hole

You want to reach the end
just to begin again
existence denied
spiral of hate

Ageless
Timeless
passed away and
borned again

Ageless
Timeless
passed away and
borned again

Searching inside my soul
I found a dying sun

Searching inside my soul
I found nothing at all

Lost
In a nebula of thoughts

Infinite worm

Infinite worm

Raise your head
and extend your arms
touch the emptiness
fall into the depth

Look at yourself
from outside
and try to understand
the meaning of this existence

Raise your head
and extend your arms
touch the emptiness
fall into the depth

Look at yourself
from outside
and try to understand
this existence
