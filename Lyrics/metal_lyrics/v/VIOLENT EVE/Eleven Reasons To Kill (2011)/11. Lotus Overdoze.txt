Madness and chaos
Nourish the land
Justice and honor
Forgotten in the past
Treachery rules
tool for the fools
Misery speaks
Friend of disease

The need to disengage
The need to go eons away
Listen to the nymph
She wants to be into your being

You drank it all
Begin to drool

Coma induced
Terror owns you
Immensity revealed
Close to the truth concealed
Far from the known
Comprehend is a hard work
Calm down
and start to think about

How can we believe
That the reason exists
pitiful breed
Our kind should be extinct

Reaching the place
Where dark and light unite
Where beginning and end collide
Bow to the shrine

Organic delusion
Your senses betrayed
Possesed by occlusion
spiral of hate
Pray
save me
from this bleak
reality scheme

The nymph who guides you
Is claiming it's price
You know what it means
Juat pay and don't think

Open your mind
stretch your soul
Look to that glint
You found the place we belong
