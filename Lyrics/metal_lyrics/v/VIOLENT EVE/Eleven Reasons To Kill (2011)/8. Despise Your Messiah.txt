Sometimes I feel out of place
But still my smile remains
No time to give one more chance
Cause you've lost your soul

I know there's nothing real
In this world of hopes
Happiness was just a mirage
In the vastness of a desert of thoughts

Despise your
Messiah
It's time
To contaminate all with selfishness

JUst like a wounded beast
Scaping from the fire
I run away from your absence
To worship your throne

I know there's nothing real
In this world of hopes
Happiness was just a mirage
In the vastness of a desert of thoughts

Despise your
Messiah
It's time
To contaminate all with selfishness
To contaminate all with selfishness

Despise your
Messiah
It's time to
Contaminate everything with selfishness
