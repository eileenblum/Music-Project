Where the convenience rules
There we can find you
Step backs in you spare time
laughing in vain and hidden in the dark

From the shore of a dry lake
You began to walk the earth
The first thing that learn people like you
is to build a mask

Just a piece of meat
with eyes is what you are
Fell how the tides drags you
to an ocean of oblivion

Trying to reach a higher plane
to find that you're the plague of our age
Indoctrinated by dogs smarter than you
Supporter of evil with the ignorance of a fool

Within the blackest filth
Sorrounded by lies and dead skin
Far from redeem yourself
This is the end that you deserve

Within the blackest filth
Sorrounded by lies and dead skin
Far from redeem yourself
This is the end that you deserve

From the shore of a dry lake
You began to walk the earth
The first thing that learn people like you
is to built a mask
Indoctrinated by dogs smarter than you
Supporter of evil with the ignorance of a fool
