THOUSAND MILES,
FALLING DOWN, STOP THE WEEPING
HIDE TO SURVIVE

HELL INCREASED,
WHERE THE SUN SEEMS TO DIE
CROSS THE LINE
TO YOUR FINAL TRIP

THE FIGHT BEHIND THE MASK
NOBODY KNOWS NO ONE

MY SKIN CRIES
I WONâT DIE FOR A WEEDING
MADE OF LIES AND BLOOD

CREEPING SOUNDS
WHEN THE BOY LOSE THE WAY
ALL HIS FAITH, FAR FROM HOME

WHY? TONIGHT IâM SICK OF THIS
GENERATION FULL OF FOOLISH
TRY!! DECIDE TO THROW YOUR FIST
FOR A COURAGEUS NATION

THE FIGHT BEHIND THE MASK
NOBODY KNOWS NO ONE

THE BEAST UNDER YOUR BED
GOD FINGERS AROUND YOUR NECK

SEE YOUR LIFE, YOUâRE TURNING INTO SHIT
I DONâT MIND, YOUâRE FALLIN' DOWN TO HELL

WHY? TONIGHT IâM SICK OF THIS
TRY!! DECIDE TO THROW YOUR FIST
FOR A COURAGEUS NATION

THOUSAND MILES,
FALLING DOWN, STOP THE WEEPING
HIDE TO SURVIVE

HELL INCREASED,
WHERE THE SUN SEEMS TO DIE
CROSS THE LINE
TO YOUR FINAL TRIP

WHY? TONIGHT IâM SICK OF THIS
GENERATION FULL OF FOOLISH
TRY!! DECIDE TO THROW YOUR FIST
FOR A COURAGEUS NATION

THE FIGHT BEHIND THE MASK
NOBODY KNOWS NO ONE

THE BEAST UNDER YOUR BED
GOD FINGERS AROUND YOUR NECK

SEE YOUR LIFE, YOUâRE TURNING INTO SHIT
I DONâT MIND, YOUâRE FALLIN' DOWN TO HELL
