NO TRUST
NO SCREAM
NO WONDER

ALL I PRAY
FALLS AGAIN
THE SLAUGHTER

I AM, OVER THE LIMIT OF DECEPTION
I WAS CROWNED IN FLAMES
THE RESURRECTION
JUST BEAT IT, GET DA FUCK

HUMAN DISORDER
READY TO MURDER
ITâS FADING MY HEART
REMIND ME

NO MORE SURRENDER
NO LONGER PLEASURE
FORGIVE THE BOY, WHOâS DYING

MY EYES
HER CRIES
NO/ DONâT SHUDDER

DESOLATE
MASSIVE HATE
THE SLAUGHTER

TOO LATE, MY SWEETEST CELEBRATION
TOO BITTER REVENGE
THIS IS MY TREASURE
JUST HIT IT, GO TO HELL

HUMAN DISORDER
READY TO MURDER
ITâS FADING MY HEART
REMIND ME

NO MORE SURRENDER
NO LONGER PLEASURE
FORGIVE THE BOY, WHOâS DYING

NO TRUST
NO SCREAM
NO WONDER

ALL I PRAY
FALLS AGAIN
THE SLAUGHTER

OLD WORLD LEGACY
OLD WORLD
OLD WORLD LEGACY
OLD WORLD

AT THE EDGE OF HUMAN BEING
WHERE THE LIE REPEATS AGAIN
EMPTY THOUGHTS RUINING MYSELF
HOLLOW SOULS SHOW ME THE WAY

I AM, OVER THE LIMIT OF DECEPTION
I WAS CROWNED IN FLAMES
THE RESURRECTION
JUST COME HERE AND SAVE ME

NO TRUST
NO SCREAM
NO WONDER

ALL I PRAY
FALLS AGAIN
THE SLAUGHTER

MY EYES
HER CRIES
NO/ DONâT SHUDDER

DESOLATE
MASSIVE HATE
THE SLAUGHTER

I AM, OVER THE LIMIT OF DECEPTION
I WAS CROWNED IN FLAMES
THE RESURRECTION
JUST BEAT IT, GET DA FUCK

HUMAN DISORDER
READY TO MURDER
ITâS FADING MY HEART
REMIND ME

NO MORE SURRENDER
NO LONGER PLEASURE
FORGIVE THE BOY, WHOâS DYING

NO TRUST
NO SCREAM
NO WONDER

ALL I PRAY
FALLS AGAIN
THE SLAUGHTER
