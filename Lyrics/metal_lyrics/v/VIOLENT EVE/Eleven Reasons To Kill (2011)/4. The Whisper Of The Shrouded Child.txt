Where lies burns
Jesus flies free
Realize, HeÂ´s bleeding so slow
To pay for his sins

Inner circle
Nails on my knees
He decides, and speaks to the crowd
To steal their wings

Since the woman gave birth alone
All was written, the Spider wrapped the son
The whisper of the shrouded child
Overshadows.... MY REALITY!

Forget those days when we loved
The end of every hope

False Illusions
Questions Unknown
Frozen time, I need myself again
To feel your body soon

Wrong survivor
Trapped into dreams

Since the woman gave birth alone
All was written, the Spider wrapped the son
The whisper of the shrouded child
It's growing stronger...OUTSIDE!

Forget Those days when we loved
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE SORROW

The end of every hope
AS WINTER FADES MY SANITY

Dissecting my sanity, throwing it into the abyss
Where there's no air, no gravity
No light, no darkness
JUst me and this broken sadness

There's no air, no gravity
There's no light, no darkness

So close to you but not enough
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE SORROW, NEXT DOOR WILL OPEN MY LAST WORDS

But now you can resist all
AS WINTER FADES MY SANITY, THE EVIL RAIN MELTS YOUR HEAD
