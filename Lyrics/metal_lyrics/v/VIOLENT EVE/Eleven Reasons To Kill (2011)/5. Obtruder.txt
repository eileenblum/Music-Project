RUN AWAY, SUCKER
FAR AWAY, FOR A LONG TIME
SURPRISE ME BABY

RUN AWAY LIAR
DEICIDE, CAN LIVE OR DIE

IN MY MIND , NIGHTMARES
IN THE SKY, A HOLY SIGN
TO DRIVE ME CRAZY

EVERY DAY, DESIRE
TO DIE

WANNA CLOSE MY EYES
LOST TOO FAR
WANNA STOP YOUR CRIES
BURNING FAST
WANNA CLOSE MY EYES
GONE TOO FAR

PROUD TO FIND
IN THE SILENCE OF YOUR CRIME
THE FEAR HIDDEN INSIDE
MY HEART

RUNNINâ HATE, IN MY VEINS
ALL WHAT I SAY MUST BE OBEYED
YOUâRE MY OBSESSION

THE WORLD IS ON, FIRE
DISGRACE, DONâT HESITATE TO
SEE MY FACE WAITING
EVIL PLACE, JUDGMENT DAY
EVERY DAY, DESIRE
TO DIE

WANNA CLOSE MY EYES
LOST TOO FAR
WANNA STOP YOUR CRIES
BURNING FAST
WANNA CLOSE MY EYES
GONE TOO FAR

PROUD TO FIND
IN THE SILENCE OF YOUR CRIME
THE FEAR HIDDEN INSIDE
MY HEART

IN MY MIND , NIGHTMARES
IN THE SKY, A HOLY SIGN

WANNA CLOSE MY EYES
LOST TOO FAR
WANNA STOP YOUR CRIES
BURNING FAST
WANNA CLOSE MY EYES
GONE TO FAR

PROUD TO FIND
IN THE SILENCE OF YOUR CRIME
THE FEAR HIDDEN INSIDE
MY HEART

PROUD TO FIND
IN THE SILENCE OF YOUR CRIME
THE FEAR HIDDEN INSIDE
MY HEART
