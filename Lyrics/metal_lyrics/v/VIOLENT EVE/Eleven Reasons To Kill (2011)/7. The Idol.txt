HATE, MURDER, ESCAPE
TIME TO FIGHT

HAZE, HARDER, INSANE

TASTE, LOUDER, RAPE
KNOW YOUR GODS
THOSE SCREAMS JUST MAKE ME LAUGH

THE MAN WHO SAVES IS GONE
YOUR FAVOURITE HERO OF HOPE
THEREâS NOTHING LEFT, THEREâS NO CHOICE
IN THE GAME OF LIFE, IâM THE LORD

THE MAN WHO SAVES IS GONE
YOUR BROKEN HERO OF HOPE
THEREâS NOTHING LEFT, THEREâS NO CHOICE
IN THE GAME OF LIFE, IâM YOUR LORD

YOUR FEAR, MAKES ME
GROW UP, AGGRESSIVE

WAKE UP, TRUST ME
REALIZE, ALL WE ARE IS SHIT

I STAY HIGH
SO LETâS TRY
THE STRONGEST WILL SURVIVE

WICKED MINDS
HIT THE GROUND
THE BULLET STRIKES THE BLIND

DONâT SPEND YOUR TIME ON YOUR GOLD?
HELL ON YOUR BACK, FEEL THE SMOKE
AN EVIL SOUND OF THE OLD SONG
BORN TO BE MAD, THATâS FOR SURE

THE MAN WHO SAVES IS GONE
YOUR FAVOURITE HERO OF HOPE
THEREâS NOTHING LEFT, THEREâS NO CHOICE
IN THE GAME OF LIFE, IâM THE LORD

THE MAN WHO SAVES IS GONE
YOUR BROKEN HERO OF HOPE
THEREâS NOTHING LEFT, THEREâS NO CHOICE
IN THE GAME OF LIFE, IâM YOUR LORD

YOUR FEAR, MAKES ME
GROW UP, AGGRESSIVE

WAKE UP, TRUST ME
REALIZE, ALL WE ARE IS SHIT

I STAY HIGH
SO LETâS TRY
THE STRONGEST WILL SURVIVE

WICKED MINDS
HIT THE GROUND
THE BULLET STRIKES THE BLIND

I STAY HIGH
SO LETâS TRY
THE STRONGEST WILL SURVIVE

WICKED MINDS
HIT THE GROUND
THE BULLET STRIKES THE BLIND
