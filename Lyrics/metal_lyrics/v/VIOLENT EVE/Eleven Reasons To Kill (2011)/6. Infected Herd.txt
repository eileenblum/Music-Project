How can you be this way
No limits, No mistakes?
You're always lying just to show your better face

Why!? Try to explain me how
Those lies bleed your hate
Wake up and change your mind,believe!it's not too late

What you think of me?
Have you tried to list?
YouÂ´ll get from me
A dirty insanity

Idiots race
Brothers of distrust
They exterminate the faith
Fear the Infected herd

Too much like you
Damned by the fool
Those rites were the roots
Of the dignity that you loose

Don't make me yawn
Try my fist to stop
While my first strike
Shout to stay alive

Demons crush your brain
The Earth crumbles under your bed
At the end of the day
Rotten hands tear your dreams again

At the end of the day
Demons crush your brain

Don't take possession of the innocence of the drunk man
This wild obesession makes your heart cold as ice

This wild obesession makes your heart cold as ice

At the end of the day
The demons crush your brain
The Earth crumbles under your bed
Rotten hands tear your dreams again

At the end of the day
The demons crush your brain
The Earth crumbles under your bed
Rotten hands tear your dreams again

At the end of the day
The demons crush your brain
The Earth crumbles under your bed
Rotten hands tear your dreams again
