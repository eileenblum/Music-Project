Living high, living free, my life is like a war
I fill my brain with captagon
It takes me to the stars
The sound of my generation breaks my neck
Feel it with me, one, two, three times everytime
Our Metal as it should be

Count your bones
See your neck go round
Kick your damaged head
To the wall of sound

Parties concerts, pubs and girls
What more do you want
My breath goes hard, my livers broken down
But everyday is a new day

Drink, drink, smoke your grass
Life's too short, so live it
We don't wanna hear, what you hear
Our life is ours not yours
