He is bad and he hates the human race
And from this mad idea he can't escape
His worth insists in murder and hate
Pure vengeance fills him in high grade

Standing in dark light
He'll fight for his right
They'll be forever quiet
Look for his vengeance and venom tonight

Beaten down by father in young years
His venom grows by bringing red tears
Now he will fuck' em all
He'll organize their bloody fall
