Through the dense of plastic deserts remain
The restive death will roar inside
See the response to the power of the sun
Simply creatures creeping through the mist at night
Nothing is left, it's hard to take breath
Restitution is only a dream, no one knows
How to get it explained, and resorts are refused to regain

The end of the night is coming nearer
Hatred forces of the sun come out
The rest is only a fire ball, impossible to prevent

The night - bloody fights fill the scene
No one will get a redeem
The night - creatures from a united force
And to kill together procreates remorse

You'll see them out - the sun will shoot her magic shot
When the last morning begins - no other night is left for none

Death rules the empty plains, getting creatures down
Insisting of leaving this horrible world
The remain are flesh and bones
Get up there's no remedy, creep, creep and search for the light
