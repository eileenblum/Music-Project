I'm the one who killed Jesus Christ
Me is given the sign of evil
Everywhere and everytime I'll sacrifice
To murder and torment, that's my will

If somewhere soldiers are dieing in war
I will be the reason why
I wanna kill more and more
That's my desire, burn the sky

See me shine
I'll fill the world with crime
That's my will
To murder and to kill

I'm asking for all, wanna the whole
I have all feelings and minds in command
The thing I need could be only your soul
Sign of evil - I'm on the hunt

Nobody knows who I am
I'm in every soul, but who recognize that?
So I will lead your feelings and deeds
The sign of evil is in every mind
