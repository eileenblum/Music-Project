The only believe in his empty brain
Is to satisfy his morbid lust
In a fuckin' world of death and pain
He learned what love-services cost

Years and years stepping through the plains
That's the reason for his bestial thoughts
Followed by demonic shadows everywhere
In his eyes you can see flesh rot

M.A.O.T. - you'll see their blood flow free
Feel the cold breath on your skin
One more woman dies under your grin
Your soul get's free, if your body dies under the sun
Get ready for the eternal run
The magic mist defaces your confusion

Running for the light of life, time get's too short
M.A.O.T. gives all his power to stand the fogs of infinite horror
Less thoughts fill his brain, took him to the past
M.A.O.T. is unready to perceive the scene
In front of one thousand universes

From any time to zero you still feel the cold
M.A.O.T. tries to free his body, morbid pain and his screams come loud
Lost blood, mechanic bodies, feel the infernal light
No possibility for nothing again to grow
All feelings end in fire!
