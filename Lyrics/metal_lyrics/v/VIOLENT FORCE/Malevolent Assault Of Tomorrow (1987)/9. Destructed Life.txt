I was sleeping in a dark dusted subway
And woke up in a dirty jail
The first look into one piece of the mirror
Fills my face with ugly pale
The cop was right he gave me a coffee
But what I need is only beer
He told me about some fuckin' shit
And that my end is near

Destructed youth - Destructed life
Drinks and drinks make me fly
But, I'm immortal - I'll survive - zombies never die
Destructed youth - Destructed life
Brainkilling drugs will take me high
They guess that is my funeral - there's no one left to cry

The Doc told me, I wouldn't get old
My livers broken down
But I only had a smile for what he told
Hey Doc I'll get around
Now I'm sitting again in that bar
My eyes are going crossed
I know the Devil pays my bill
I'm drunken and I'm lost
