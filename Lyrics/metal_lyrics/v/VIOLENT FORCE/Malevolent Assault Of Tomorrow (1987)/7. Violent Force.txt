Cruelty and storms of Hades we corse
In name of evil there ain't remorse
Dispirited creatures killing stupid lifes
Instigation and pain show no delight

We deposit revenge in our souls
Our God is strength hateful death behind the walls
Made of misery and pain in loveless time
In brainless figures eyes the sign of death will shine

Bleed out your senseless life
In blood your soul will dive
The corps of Violent Forces insanity
Death is remained from malign kingdom of fame
No chance in malice land to get free

Society systems they will be stopped
Into the deepest pits of hell they will be dropped
On endless field of death now is showed
The end of all emperators lies below
The corps of V.F. dive under time
Till the moment's near again for death and crime
The brains which rule they ryches are dethroned
Till they creep up of hell again of hell with endless
