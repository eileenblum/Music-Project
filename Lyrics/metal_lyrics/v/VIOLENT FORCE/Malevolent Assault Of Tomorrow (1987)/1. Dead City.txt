If there's something you will make
You'll have to take
Your machine out of the dust
To satisfie your lust

We fuck the greenies law
Mad Bingo cracks will bleed
They'll end on circular saw
In Dead City we will meet

Alcoholic forces power
Will take us higher
You'll kill flower power
That is our desire

Silly poppers running wild
Keep on smiling like a child
When we scratch their face
Oh, what kind of grace

Prudish girls in disco-fashion
Enjoy peace, don't like any aggression
But we all know, they're so mad
Velbert is absolutely dead
