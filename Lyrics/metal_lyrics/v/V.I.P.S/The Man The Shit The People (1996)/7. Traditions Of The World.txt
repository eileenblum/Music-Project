[Music:Ragerep/Fang/Vitoz Lyrics:Vitoz]

Like a naturals event floats outside
After suitable presupposition

Like that the traditions reflectioned
On people's faces

Their fathers created their traditions
But modern people supports it carefully

He screams:"Why so?" and I replay:"Why not?
Are you against?"

She asks:"Will it be another way?"
And I replay:"No,because you have one way
Which find out with traditions of the world
And you support it".

They die and I replay:"The death isn't the
very awful thing".
