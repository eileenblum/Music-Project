[Music:Vitoz/Garry Lyrics:Garry]

Look at this girl
She's pretty
Look at this girl
She's smiles

Doesn't know
People are cretins
Doesn't know-they
Don't wanna die

She knows:

Life is a joy and happines
Life is a difficult thing

But:

Some people crying
Some people dying

What can you tell about this?

What do you want from stupid girl?
What can you tell about my tears?
What can you feel in a stupid World?
False,false,false,false,false,false...
