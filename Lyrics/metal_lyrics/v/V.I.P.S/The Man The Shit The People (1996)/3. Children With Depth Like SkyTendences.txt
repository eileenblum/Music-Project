[Music:Vitoz Lyrics:Vitoz]

Once upon a time wise man lived and said
this phrase:"Children are flouers of our life;
let's trample them".

And then people agree with his words,
They found them interesting.
"Children are flouers of our life;
let's trample them".

And wise man saw the children with depth like the sky.
And wise man couldn't say anything to them
And couldn't anything his dirty feet.

People already trampled him.

When somebody watch to human creature,
He can notice an interesting tendention.
When they're getting blew,they began to praise
The life in all its aspects.
