[Music:Ragerep/Vitoz/Noise Lyrics:Vitos]

Evil artist Drew the life
Kind artist drew the death
Crazy hunter didn't
Understand the first and
The second
He wanted to know only
One thing
He wanted to know only
One thing:
Where's a pheasant
Where's a pheasant

People lose more
And win less
why someone must think about
more,if less.
Is near and can be touched with the hands?
People,shit is nearer than sky.
Touch shit with your hands!

Celebrate,grief,suck dick
Honest and dishonest.
Man in the street
"You can't jump over your own head"
- it's your words,it's my words,
it's their words,it's my shit.
