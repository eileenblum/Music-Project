Lost in time
out beyond the last goodbye,
alone inside my mind,
no more looking back

Vastness
invades my life
Lonely emptiness
slowly drives me mad

Since I
faced my inner eye
states of consciousness
beyond mortal man

Looking out I understand
Destination Pegasus
Heaven told me,
hear me now,

âA path of stars will show the wayâ

All your souls have lead me here
I am the savior
Distant ways protect me,
cleanse yourself of sinful doubt

There's your chance to tell me now
I am the savior
A dark in you that plagues me
Tell me why

No past, no future,
no way to turn your back

In the greatest mist of lies
look to fate to guide your eyes

Your life is divine
and you waste it dying, tell me why

Forget the past and the future,
find the greatness you deserve

All your souls have lead me here
I am the savior
Distant ways protect me,
cleanse yourself of sinful doubt

There's your chance to tell me now
I am the savior
A dark in you that plagues me,
tell me why
