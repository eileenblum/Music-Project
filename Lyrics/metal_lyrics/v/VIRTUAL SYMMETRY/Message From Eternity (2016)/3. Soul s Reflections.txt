Look at you
thorn in your side
A love I've been before
Promises I swore

Brethren, our hearts
looking for,
lifetime after lifetime,
something more

Now
I stand here
what you see's not a lie
Understanding
you'll say we'll never die

In your eyes
is a reflection of my soul
look at me and you will know
Painful
yearning for the truth

Looking for a future
when the past is all we have together
Set me free in soul
and take this fear of losing you forever, now

Somewhere in time
I went looking for my heart
We made our promises
and the course of losing in the end

Now
I stand here
look at the future
it's all in your name
Now
understand me
tonight you break
tonight you break the spell

In your eyes
is a reflection of my soul
look at me and you will know
the tale of a child
who sailed the stars for you
and never looked back

With your eyes
look at me and see
the reflection of your soul in me
Painfully
yearning for the truth

And there's no other like you
no other soulmate in time
and everyone is so
distant and far

I never found out the truth
and lost you life after life
but kept you in my heart,

in my dreams, that are older than time
when you said that your heart's
all I had

you never took it back
you never took it back
Please never take it back

I remember that night
I know we never looked back
Please never take it back in time
disclosing my heart

In your eyes
is a reflection of my soul,
look at me and you will know
the tale of us
looking back to the future

Stand for me now
look to the future
We're breaking this spell tonight
Stand for me now
look to the future
We're bringing the truth to light

My soul's in your eyes
Do you see,
do you see yours in mine?
I believe,
take me with you,
together we'll find the truth
