Ever want to see the world untied
Ever want to hear the starlight's song
and have the courage not to stare

Ever wash the fears away with time
Ever wanted tears to rule someone
while they were dying forever in you

Ever wanna kiss the world goodbye
Ever wanna drift out all night long
just wasting time

There's always summer waiting in your eyes
Now I can look forward all night long
to you flying and staying with me

Never wanted memory,
forever want to feel the dreams of now
and close my eyes
and dance, forever strangers in the rain

Never wanted memory,
forever wants to set me free

Close your eyes and stop this game
Ages come and come again
Locked inside you every moment
sea of memories are storming

Close your eyes and stop your pain
You'll never, never fall again

Ever want to see the world untied
Ever wanna drift out all night long
Wind at the break of dawn,
a mirror for the night

Ever want to kiss the world goodbye
Not a care for who walks the sky
A floating city of crystal and pearl

Ever want to see the world untied
Ever want to see the world untied,
without their promises

Ever want to see the world untied
Ever want to hear the starlight's song

Never take a memory,
never want your past to flee from love
and close your eyes
and dance, forever grieving for the day

I never chose a memory,
forever wanted to be free

It is a truth of my life,
I scream it to the sky
and to endless time

You never told me you could fly
into the light
and take me higher
to love of endless spaces and the light
