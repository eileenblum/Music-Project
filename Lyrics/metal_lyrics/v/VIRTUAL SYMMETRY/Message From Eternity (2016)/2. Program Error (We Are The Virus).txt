In my dreams
I live a looping existence,
endless unlit ways

In my dreams,
stalking shadows of you,
I find the key

In your game
of destruction and sorrow
I see humanity

another day
another night of you
Oh, the tears...

Eternity
seeks release from the darkness,
the rise of the immortal man

a dying moon,
my last embrace with
your identity

Stay with me 'till the end,
let me now understand,
let me know before the end,
let me try to change my life!

I see the eye of time,
facets of a crystal mind,
beneath the lucid dream
a dread reality

restraining cell
inside myself

Atrophy the living held indefinitely

You write the scenes of our tale unjustly,
mocking our conscious soul
with the reality of your control
Resistance flying
on the wings of darkness
today,
forevermore

Steeling myself for war:
A dream

No power of you,
no power of them
can ever say we lost our time
We'll never lose faith in ourselves

You write the scenes of our tale unjustly,
mocking our conscious soul
with the reality of your control
Resistance flying
on the wings of darkness
today,
forevermore
