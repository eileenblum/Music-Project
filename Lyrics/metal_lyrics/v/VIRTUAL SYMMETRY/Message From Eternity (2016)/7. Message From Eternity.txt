[Part 1: The River Of Time]

[Instrumental]

[Part 2: Streets Of Universe]

Soft glow of light,
river of time.
The signs of forevermore
distance my fears.

I don't know why
I waited for truth
and the promises
in a mystery
surrendered to time.

Forevermore,
in the streets of a universe
knowledge is tearing me inside.
Beauty. Pain. Hope.

A star's guiding light
is fading away
and I will stay here in emptiness
at the mercy of the universe.

Love, as you said,
don't look behind
and ask to know why
blame is not worth looking for.

Forevermore
in the streets of a universe
somebody tells me to forget,
a tiny voice far away.

In my dark time
I feel there's something to know.
Consciousness close to mine
and now I want to know why.

Into my mind
I know I'll find something more,
hearing unsung voices
made secret aeons ago.

Time after time
in a semblance of heaven
lies with a sweet smile as a mask.
Imprisoned us all.

Day by day,
a stirring of hope in my angel above,
sometimes I feel like a warrior.

Day by day
a feeling of hope in the vastness of time,
a way to save us from the lie,
burning purpose reborn.

Day by day
in the city of shadows
chasing the nightmares of destiny
along the ways of my mind.

Day by day,
day by day,
day by day
looking for mercy.

Forevermore,
in the streets of a universe,
fighting the voices at my side:
âGive up, you're blindâ
I won't.

See the way,
look through my eyes
out of time
and the limit of lies.

Day by day
as I look in your eyes,
find our way
and be kings of the sky.

Let out your pain,
look to the stars
and never listen to whispering lies.

Dry your tears,
look ahead without fear.
Now we're chasing the truth in disguise.

Day by day
the city of hope
in the time of lies

in the streets of Eden
great stone towers fall.

Day by day
shadows retreat
as the storm clouds break
on ruins of a promised land,
the graveyard of our destinies.

As we walk
in the streets of heaven,
if somebody tells me the way,
no more losing the trail
to the gates of Paradise.

See the way,
look through my eyes
out of time
and the limit of lies.

Day by day
as I look in your eyes
I see the city of Heaven.

Let out your pain,
look to the stars
and never listen to whispering lies.

I know the truth,
the Message is found.

No more betrayal.
