Did you choose to steal her youth?
Did she even stand a chance?
Fate is cruel, it canât be true
Are you watching from above?
Angels cry as I stand by
Itâs too much pain to bear

I tried so endlessly
To be the man you wanted me to be
But I donât think I can be

Spirits numb the pain as scarred hearts remain
Fearing solitude I canât face this blame
My sister has gone into the sea
A face remains stained in me

I tried so endlessly
To be the man you wanted me to be
But I donât think I can be

Breathe o sister breathe
Breathe o sister breathe

I choose to steal her youth
I still canât feel whatâs inside
Face down I hear the sound
Of too much life just passing by

I sit by as angels cry
Itâs too much pain to bear

[Chorus]
