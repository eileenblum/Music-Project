I feel a dreadful chill sinking into my skin
Eyes ablaze as souls are saved
Flesh made graves for man-made plagues
And all these years weâve bled
All we have and all we gave

Come on and dance with me
A schizophrenic dream
It happens all the time
So close your eyes and die

I chip away until youâre fully made
A wooden shell inside this hollow grave
Your skin returns I spread your hair
To feel the burn and taste the air
I know whatâs down below

How did you know I wouldnât go
Down far below to where it wouldnât go?

I can see the darkness grow inside of me
I can feel the darkness take a part of me
Such a strange society of sanity
Fed the lies when advertised on your tv

I donât see why
I donât see why simple minds
Can scrutinize and simplify that
I feel fine
I feel right
I canât lie
I am not fine

[Chorus]

I canât afford to lose
A life Iâve shared with you
Iâm not fine

I wonât forget those words
I wonât forget the hurt
I wonât forget the pain
And why did I get this blame?
