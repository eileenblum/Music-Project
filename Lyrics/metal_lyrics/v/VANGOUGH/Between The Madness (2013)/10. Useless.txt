I feel like itâs time to die
A feeling I canât deny

I watched you play the part
A slimy stupid person I can live without
Fuck you and your celebrity
Some bullshit prima donna reaching out for me
So sick of dancing stars
Stupid hidden voices and their bouncing cars
But donât worry we can make it right
A perfect picture of a modern vaudeville life

Useless to heal those scars
Useless to know what we are

And I feel something waking
And I feel something making
I feel like itâs time to die
A feeling I canât deny

Come on now itâs time to die
Donât be scared to lose your mind
Come on now itâs time to die
Time to kiss your ass goodbye

Useless to heal my scars
Useless to heal this heart

Useless kings and useless queens
Fighting wars on TV screens
Voices beg to make us see
Erase the plague and wash us clean
Useless kings and useless queens
Fighting wars on TV screens
Voices beg to make us see
Erase this mediocrity

[Chorus]
