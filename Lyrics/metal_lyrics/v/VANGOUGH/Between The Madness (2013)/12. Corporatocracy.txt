Privatizing until youâre secure
And buying merchandise at any price
Every cost is taken in account
Just before we kick your old ass out

Crawling on surface
Animal instincts

Teach me how to take
Teach me how to rape
I am only good
If I can be used

Sit with me, share with me
Give me your soul
Killing my innocence until the day I waste away
Show me your charity so I canât see your human greed

Privatize, serving lies
Give your lives and just fall in line
Work to save and slave away
Economies of filth and greed
Share in corporatocracy please

Sit with me, share with me
Give me your soul

[Chorus]

Into the dark I take you
And in the dark I made you

Sit with me, share with me
Give me your soul

[Chorus]
