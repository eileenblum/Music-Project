And Iâll burn this flesh you made
But itâs just so hard to say
Digging deeper to the core

Come feel what I feel tonight
Where lost souls hide from the light
Hear the silence of my pain
Alone my heart grows dim

Separate me from this dying heart
Thoughts of you that leave such painful scars
Burn down my cathedral
Cast out the deceiver

And it fills me with disdain
At the mention of your name
And I thought Iâd let you know
That itâs time to repay

For the fire, for the lies
Too much burning into brine
Separating till Iâm bleeding
Not enough to sew this needing

Iâm complicating this game
Separating my pain

Separate me from this dying heart
Thoughts of you that leave such painful scars
Burn down sacred temples
Erase all our evils

Separate me, separate me
Remove all these scars, release this heart
