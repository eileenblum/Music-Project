I take her hand in mine
Itâs soaked in blood
Two souls becoming one
Caught in the flood

Left without a place to hide unprotected
Deep inside this tortured mind I can hear him
Calling out his fatherâs name
Falling, Iâm falling now

Everyday still the same, learn to see and breathe
Mourning comes, still Iâm numb
Lie awake as my heart slowly breaks apart

I look into her eyes, all I see are painful lies
Reflections of our unborn child, fires burning deep inside
Burning out

[Chorus]

Nightmares flooding my mind
Black holes filling her eyes
Nightmares flooding my mind
Black holes making her blind

Find me, Iâm standing in the rain
Iâm calling out your name
Sinking in filth and mud
Please god erase our pain
Please make us whole again
All this life is passing by
We wonât be the same again

[Chorus]

Lie awake in this afterfall
