Come to me, come on bended knee
Let us cleanse impurity
Teach me please, teach me how to be
Not so cold and empty
Say those words, say those empty words
Say that you still need me
Iâm the tree, Iâm the dying tree
And my leaves are falling on you

Climb the stairs, climb the slimy stairs
Climb upon his throne
See her face, see her slimy face
Turn your heart to stone

See me
Do you see what I see?
Hear me
Do you hear what I hear?
Know me
Do you know what I know?
Fear me
Can you feel the plague grow?

Cutting through this flesh and blood
Drifting in a lake of mud
Born a beggar and a slave
Sacrifice the pain away
Watching idle hands at play
Reminding us we cannot stay
Finding flesh that fits the mold
So many lives we killed untold

Young son Iâm the god that beckons you
Kill your son I beg of you
Obey my words
Kneel down for his hate and genocide
Jealousy and blackened eyes
A fabric of man

[Chorus]

See me
And I buried his hate
Hear me
Under flesh and blood gates
Know me
Until oceans ran dry
Fear me
And dry

[Chorus]

Oh, can you feel the love coming from above?
Can you feel the love?
Oh, I turned to drink its blood raging from the flood

Oh can you feel the hate
And can you feel the fear
Itâs coming from the dirt
Itâs coming through sincere
Itâs coming from the mud
And from the gates of heaven
And from the minds that man made
And on the backs of hatred
And on the souls your god saved
Oh can you feel the love?
