All these years Iâve faced the truth
You faded losers canât buy me with
Your apologies or sympathies
Such simple minds that canât see
Iâm leaving you face down
Iâm making you weak now
Stop crying for healing
No one is listening

Still Iâm facing war
And I feel like I want more

Kneel for your god of flies
Come tear the vines and leave behind the masquerade of this
Vaudeville Nation
Bring the tower down and burn the circus to the ground

Stupid celebrity
Too late to wash us clean

Too many fantasies
Too many celebrities
Watching them mindlessly
God wonât you help us please?
Erase all our fallacies
Please purge of us of our disease

[Chorus]

I will confide in you
I will come hide in you
Kneel before the lord of flies
Now Iâm inside of you
Give to the lord of flies

[Chorus]

Just what you donât want to see
Just what I donât want you to be
