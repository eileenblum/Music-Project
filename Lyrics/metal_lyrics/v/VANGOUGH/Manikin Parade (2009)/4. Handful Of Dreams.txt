This part of life is left best to the wise,
Sages and kings, saints and clowns, bottles of fear
Look to the sky, pour out your soul and you'll fly
On mountains of gold, all of it yours if you're first in line.

I lived in oceans where angels do dwell
Beyond the sun, far beyond hell
He taught me life is a painting of time
Hearts filled again like bottles of wine

Soak in the waters of plenty...

Drink clouds of gray, let the sunshine melt away
Sundays of greed
Spattered paint, handful of rain
Words etched in stone
"All my hopes gone too soon"
Lost in a sea
Stranded and bear where I bleed...

Forests burning, people starving
Nations fighting, oceans dying
Skies are grayed out, trees are fading
From your home that you are saving
Despite your gift to think of ways to help mankind seek better days
You waste your mind on brittle toys
On killing earth, on fighting wars!

[Chorus]
