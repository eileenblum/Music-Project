Keep your thoughts inside.
A warmer place to think and hide.
Don't let their fickle minds try to understand your messed up life.
A suit to fit all types; stretch it long or stretch it wide.
Eventually, we look the same -- we dare not teeter on the edge.

And once more I feel like a child in the summer time.
Free from anguish, free from angst. Free to live my life again.
A playground where I live alone, away from wanting more and more.
Sell me life, sell me earth, a soul for sale, for what it's worth.

Today's buzz word is change, but you all remain pathetically the same!
You can only change yourself.

Run little one -- keep running far away until darkness finally fades away!

Sell me life. Sell me your lies for a price.
Give me more. Give me much more than I need.
Make me into a manikin.

Some assembly required.

Save me from the shameless charade.
(Take away your humanity)
Help me melt this manikin parade!
(Become part of the manikin parade)

Can you hear their little feet? Like dolls dancing into hell.
Not enough aisles to feed our need.

Can you hear God through that iPod?

Save me from the shameless charade.
(Take away your humanity)
Help me melt this manikin parade!
(Become part of the manikin parade)
