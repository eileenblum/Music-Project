Dear father heal my wounds tonight, my hands are crust in filth
You blessed me with your guiding light, now take this pain away
I begged for mercy far too long, I've soaked your bed with blood
Your royal servants crowned you king despite the shame you caused.

I turn away from wandering eyes, a drop a white and no more cries
As I fly up to hold you in paradise where we all pay the price
You know it's true of what they say, some roads lead back to where they came
Is it not enough that I bled for you? But now I'm through with you, through with you!

I can't find truth within these lies; I can't escape your wandering eyes
Help me hide from this pain
Help me find faith again

Turn away, cast your gaze from ancient books
I'm the voice of your god you can trust in me
And don't you tell a soul, you're mine forevermore

I can't find truth within these lies; I can't escape your wandering eyes
Help me hide from this pain
Help me find faith again
I can't find truth within these lies; I can't escape your wandering eyes
Kneel before me and pray
That none find us this way!
