Hello, good morning, stranger. Have we ever met? You look familiar.
Do you recognize my face? Or did I dream we met in a cosmic cafe?

Give me wings. Let me fly far away into dreams where I am not afraid.
We can live in the sky high above pain and loss where it all floats away.

Can we not hope for peace during war?
Is there love shining through any more?

Let us hold what we find dear in life.
Shafts of light warm our hearts as time moves on.

Help me find you again.
I need your light, your light.

I need some honesty, save us from tragedy.

Come here son, I'm your friend till the end.
All these years, I was here standing by.
But you left in the blink of an eye,
leaving me all alone in this home.

Sex and lies, darken skies, simple lives, complex minds
wanting to scrutinize everything, everyone, everywhere
till it all disappears.

[Chorus:]
Show me you understand, I need some guidance tonight.
I feel your honesty, we know your tragedy shines through the dark into the morning light.
Show us you're willing to break through the bonds that keep our hearts apart.

Help me get out of here. Help me to see the light.
The walls are closing in. Oh God, I cannot fight.

I want to believe in your lies. I want to see truth in your eyes.

[Chorus]
