He burns -- his skin does burn -- his skin does burn

Come sit with me and together we can harp on your society of mediocrity and stupidity
It's alarming me just how much you really care about celebrities
It's a cock tease, can't you see?
It's all the same every time we make the grind until we find your time is done, step aside for the next in line, the next to try, the next die.

I can't slow down or I will fall far beyond the pale.
And you'll finally see what a man should be and we'll all dine in fantasy.

In the wheel what a steal, live your life as though it were never real
Like a rat in a cage we'll be more than free when you turn off the TV screen
Stuck forevermore like before you and me we're on the floor with the whore, but we fail to see the moral compass and we fail to see what drives and what corrupts us.

God are you watching? I feel it, I hear it. The sounds of Christmas bells, they heal me they heal my scars.

These scars do bleed; we scar from society.

I healed you with laughter on Christmas Eve.
What happened to our love that made you leave me?

Such saviors that kill us and make us bleed;
They claim that God's plan is to make us believe.

I won't be afraid. I'm alone or betrayed.
I called out your name, but you left me ashamed.
Repeat

We all need some light
We all need some light sometime
We all need some light
We all need some light sometimes

[Spoken:]
I imagine your eyes and I can't believe
That you left me on that Christmas Eve
and as I lovingly pass you by, it pains me to see
all that we shared swept away by the rain.
