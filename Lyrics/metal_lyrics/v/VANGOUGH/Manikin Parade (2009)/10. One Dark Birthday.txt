I sit here with myself on a chair of wealth
Thinking what it means to have everything
To have everything
To have nothing

Should I live in fear?
Do I dare to trust?
Do I run away into darkened night
Where the shadows wait
To embrace my flesh?

Thank you for your time
But I have to go
Thank you for your love
For leaving me alone
I know it's hard to bear as I turn away

Here I am
Imprisoned inside of this mind
There I am
A shadow that no one can find
(here I am inside of this mind)
There he is
(There I am that no one can find)
Cold and alone and afraid
(There he is alone and afraid)
There he goes
(There he goes!)
Reliving that one dark day

Do I learn to speak
When the voices swell?
Should I make a change in this dampened hell?
Hands do feel around where they shouldn't touch!
(Where they should not in the dark)
Where they should not touch!

Should I live inside this imprisoned mind
Will you find me trapped waiting to be found?
Can you see my eyes on this darkest day?

On this darkest day!
I need some light! Show me the way!

Here I am for you to take trapped inside this feeble mind
Find a place where we can wake!

[Chorus]
