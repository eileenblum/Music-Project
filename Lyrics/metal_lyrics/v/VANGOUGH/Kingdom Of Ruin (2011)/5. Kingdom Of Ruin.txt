Once we shared a life the same
Two souls were bound through thick and thin
I fought the sands you hid your face
Till all at once you fell away

I am your brother
Secretive lover
Time will not wait to
Comfort or hold you

[Chorus]
I can feel all this pain so real
Like the day you said that our love was dead
Finding ways to breathe and the scars to heal
Rise above the loss
Finding the strength to cross

I feel weak and desperately I reach for someone close to me
I sit and look at what we had and what we had was misery!

I feel so tired all the time
Sitting here waiting for, just waiting for the end to come

Did you think I would be here just waiting
Waiting to carry you through our failings?
How could you place all this on my shoulders?
Weighing me down
Weighing me down

Tell me your problems
Iâm here to listen
But one last favor
Can you heal my scars?

[Chorus]
I can feel all this pain so real
Like the day you said that our love was dead
Finding ways to breathe and these scars to heal
Rise above the loss
Find the strength to say that

I am through reaching out to you
Wasting all those years
Wasting countless tears
Did you comfort me when you seemed to make us fail?
