Iâve lived to see your eyes
Those looks of wide surprise
I promise never to leave or abandon you
Together we will run
Through golden fields my son
To see you smile is more than I could ask for

Iâm here to care for you, hold you and guide you through

[Chorus]
Come with me through mountain streams
Forrest hills guide us through our dreams
I will hold you lovingly through all eternity

Iâm growing older now
Iâll have to leave you soon
My spirit carries on even though my body is gone
Remember all those things I taught you through this life
Look in your fatherâs eyes one last time before I die

Iâm here to care for you, hold you and guide you through

[Chorus]
