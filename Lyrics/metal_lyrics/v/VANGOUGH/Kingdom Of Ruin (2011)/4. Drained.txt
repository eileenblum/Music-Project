Turn my eyes I can live without the shame
I can see who is to blame
Tell me who will suffer
Faced with choices and held to suffer
I run for shelter but find you waiting

Take my courage, test my limits
Set my fire and burn me under

Held without a doubt, judged on your behalf!
I wonât judge you, but you will judge me!
How could you say, how could you know!
I would dare to speak, cause such suffering?

[Chorus]
Drained of all my wanting to give back to you
My faith is gone Iâve suffered too long in your kingdom
Games youâve played have left me drained and all Iâve gained
Is another song about my pain and suffering

Father see me and forgive me please
Did I falter did I not get on my knees?
Forced to live with all your corruption
Sacrificing till your will is done

Held without a doubt, judged on your behalf
I wonât judge you, but you will judge me!
Should I just feel your shame
Or should you face this blame?

I see so clearly your hypocrisy
Time relentless time is all left behind

Drained of all my wanting to
Bring the world to you

[Chorus]
