I feel like Iâve lived in this place before
I feel like Iâve had this dream
Is this the place where I was born?
Is this where I become king?

So many people from day to day
I wonder what would they say?
And I canât seem to comprehend
What this means I donât understand.

I slip into some place brand new!

I feel like I am leaving me
Am I the Rabbit King?

Finding a way into my past life
Seeing her face
I think she was my wife

I cannot be sure
Was this really? Was this really me?
Was this really me?

I am walking through layers of dreaming
I feel Iâm watching a past life reveal me

Seeing your face reflect in my memory
Has awakened me into a life Iâve lived

Finding a way into my past life!
Seeing her face I think she was my wife!

I feel like Iâve been here before
Am I the Rabbit King?

I lived in this place before
I am the Rabbit King!
