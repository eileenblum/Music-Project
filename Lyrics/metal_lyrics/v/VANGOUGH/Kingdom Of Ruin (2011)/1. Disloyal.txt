Reach inside my open chest
Feel around thereâs nothing left

Seven years of darkness
Then all of the pieces fell
And you just turned and walked away
Living by your sorrow and mending broken wings
Yet I still feel Iâm held down underwater drowning

[Chorus]
I still canât believe what have we done?
I was so alone how could you make us fail?
Tell me why we failed and why you lied

I felt your black heart
And Iâve seen your serpentâs tongue
And Iâve seen the truth behind your lies
I feel the coldness and the dark you walked me through

Turn to me and face the truth that never came to be
Would you say we shared a life too long in fantasy?

[Chorus]
