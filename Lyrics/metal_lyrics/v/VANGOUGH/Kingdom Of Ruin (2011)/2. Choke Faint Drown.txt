Iâve seen loved ones held underwater
See the store lights fade from her eyesight

Breathe my love and swim to dreams
Dry your tears away and leave this pain

[Chorus]
See the store lights turn to star lights
Through her eyes as waters rise
Hear my calling from beyond the light into the light!
Underwater I can see her face!
I will make her feel your pain!

choke, faint, drown- die!
An eye for an eye!

Watching you has made me see
What hate can breed so perfectly

Dark minds feed â I can see the hate within you
Run, hide, die â I will be the hate that kills you
I will be the light that heals you
I will try!

Now she is gone!

[Chorus]
See the store lights turn to star lights
Through her eyes as waters rise
Hear my calling from beyond the light into the light!
Underwater I can see her face!
And she will feel your pain

choke, faint, drown!
