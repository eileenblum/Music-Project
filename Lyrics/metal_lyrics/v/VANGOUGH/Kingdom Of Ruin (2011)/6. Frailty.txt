I see the sun slip away
As I get dressed for our big meeting
Get in my car see my clothes
See Iâm normal
Give me your hand, see my hand
As it trembles and shakes

I am not me and I see what I am

[Chorus]
Evergreens and falling leaves
I hide behind and wait for sleep
Masks I wear to keep you here
To tell the truth I plan to kill

You are so clean and serene
But I am not who I appear
Now come here and please die my dear

Clean my hands once more
Wash and mop the floor
Make my dinner then Iâm out the door

Dreaming, I see a sea of bodies
Wake up coffee, get into my Audi
At work you say hi, lunchtime then goodbye
See you tonight, I promise to stop by

So you think weâre different you and mea
Because I do the things you wonât do
But deep down inside- I am you!

Hot winters, cold summers
Cash flows like bloody rivers

I, I canât help myself
I, I canât stop myself
One itch to scratch myself
Monster hides in myself

[Chorus]

I see the sun once again for a new day
Donât try to hide cause you see
You are me!

Come kill me I am your king!
Come crown as your messiah
Monsters and kingdoms unite
All part of your stupid design!
