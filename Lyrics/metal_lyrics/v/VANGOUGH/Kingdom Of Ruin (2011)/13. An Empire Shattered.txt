I feel a new day has dawned
But sometimes I feel something is gone
When Iâm asleep and all alone
I dream of him those days are lost

Walking down the street this afternoon
I see the people stop to meet
And talk about the things they saw and heard about

[Chorus]
That day when all my kingdoms shattered
And all my hopes were put into question
I miss you dad!

Break of the day, the feeling sticks with me
Like a burning inside
When will this subside?
Why are you gone?
And why am I scared?
And what am I to do without you?

Time does fly like a short sunrise
All I want is to be with you now

Wait I take a look and see your face
I need a friend and place to stay
While I stop and figure out
What he said that

[Chorus]
Day when all my kingdoms shattered
And all my hopes were put into question
I miss you dad, I miss you dad!

I can do anything I want to
As long as he is beside me
With me
In my heart he will stay
