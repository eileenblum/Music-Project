I remember you were standing by my side
That night that something filled the air
Our bodies danced across the lake under the moon
Where autumn leaves they fall much too soon

Steal my heartache, heal this heartbreak
Nest inside my tree tonight just to stay!

Falsely led into our hopes
But are you just what I hoped?

[Chorus]
Am I falling in her dream
The night I recall it so clear!

Fall into darkening skies
Am I still the man I despise
I wonât fight or betray it
I wonât lie I will save it!

[Chorus]
And Iâm here to carry you
Through lifeâs strange and vast mysteries
Am I falling for this dream
That night I recall it so clear!

Say to me that youâll stay here with me
Close by your side Iâll just be listening
