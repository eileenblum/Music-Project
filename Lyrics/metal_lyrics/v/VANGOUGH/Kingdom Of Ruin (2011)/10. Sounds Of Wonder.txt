Brother run as fast you can
To escape this wonderful land
And maybe youâll get to the top
Then what? Is it all that you thought?
Come on man thereâs so much to see
To live, to feel, to breathe.
And Iâll, Iâll be your guide
Through this vast country side!

[Chorus]
Come, come step inside
This place where nothing can hide
See your dreams on mountains untouched
And fly like a fish if you must

Sing like a frog, watch the sunset through it all
Running through fields
Feel the grass brush my heels

[Chorus]

Son I am a pigeon just wishing to fly
You, you may have heard Iâm a bird who fell from the sky!

I am the sun, after the rain
Seeker of spring and all that it brings
I am the sun maker of light!
Follow my path
You know that itâs right.

Eyes up to the clouds
Sing your spirit aloud
