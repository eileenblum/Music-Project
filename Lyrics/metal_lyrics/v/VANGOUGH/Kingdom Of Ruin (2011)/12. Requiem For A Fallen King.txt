Darkness falls around sunlight
Gathers to bury my history in this tree
One last goodbye
Dry your tears son donât you cry
âFather stay here, please donât leave me!â
My body is gone but my spirit will live on!

[Chorus]
Kingdoms fade and so shall I
Falling! Falling!
Bury me into the garden
Lead the way into the afterlife!

Feelings like leaves dropping into the ocean
Where angels are sinking into our dreams
Mothers are calling us, Fathers are holding us
After we leave the palace behind
One last goodbye, dry your tears son donât you cry

[Chorus]
