I think Iâve reached the end
A place where I can begin to feel alive again
Stones wrapped in green and white
Covered in broken light
Between the evergreen

Seeing this garden, seeing my past life has
Finally set my heart free

[Chorus]
How did I end up in this place?
With the leaves against my face
Walking on stones among the dead
Seeing the words etched on the floor
What could they be there for?
Do they reveal the way back home?

All my life Iâve sat and wasted away
Now it seems my dreams have led me astray
And I feel something is keeping me here
Can this be my dream is becoming real

I can see so vividly the truth that I am the Rabbit King
Running free through mountain springs
I find the key to stay in this dream
I am him and he is me
Two souls bound deep inside this tree
Learning to breathe, walking to be
More than I was to serve this purpose

Turning to face all that I missed
Reaching for you, reaching for kingdoms!

Seeing this garden, seeing my past life has
Finally set my heart free

The door is closing quickly
I have to make up my mind
Do I stay or do I let go?

[Chorus]

I canât believe Iâve come this far
It wouldnât be proper to leave this kingdom in distress

I see all of the leaves on the tree
On stone I can read all my history
Finding ways to live for today!

Break free of our fears
And take the time to hear my words
And never look back to the past
I beg of you my love
And break free of our dreams
And break free of our destiny
Look to the sky and you will find
The keys to lifeâs mysteries

Turn to the sky!
Turn to the blue sky!

And I never thought I would say this last goodbye
To a life that I let just slip and pass me by
And it comes as no surprise to anyone
That Iâd choose to be here among my wife and son

Now come and follow me
Into the Acorn Tree for one last ceremony

Show me love and show me mercy
For I am your best friend
Welcome to modernity where peace can reign again!
Yeah again!

Can you feel love tonight when weâre together in here forever?
You lost your way but now I found you
And I promise to guide you
