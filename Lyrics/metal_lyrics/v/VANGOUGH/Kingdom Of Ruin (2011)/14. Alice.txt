Alice I hear your cries
I see your eyes in my dreams
Alice I feel your warmth
Inside my heart close to me

[Chorus]
There he is in front of you
A prince who needs a friend or two
Take him in and feel his light
You know itâs right

Alice Iâm here for you
To take us through
This life

Heal me
I need you here
Next to me tonight

[Chorus]
There he is in front of you
A friend who needs some loving too
Take him in and feel his light
He needs you near him every night

Heâs the one who came to be
The prince who ruled the Acorn Tree
Singing songs of golden fields
Like oceans of fire it seemed so real

He turned to face the Sunday sky and broke down and cried...
