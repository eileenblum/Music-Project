Free I run!
Through my fields
Through my forest
Through my ends

I feel my skills reborn
My reign has just begun!

Impale those sacks of meat!
None of them can't ever breathe!

Are you tested the human flesh?
Is it stringy, filthy or wet?

Release the woods of this growing scourge
Or perhaps you want to lose!

Teach our firstborn
What it takes
To be a real troll!
