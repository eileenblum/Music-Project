When the forest is still quiet
Means that even the day hasn't died
Bring those pints left over from the other day.
The idiot does not know where they are again!
Look for food, wheat, meat!
There is nothing, sir, only bread
What are you waiting for, shameless bastards
Assault the villages, have my key words

WE ARE MARCHING
Through the busy roads one more time again
WE ARE MARCHING
Listening to the sounds of every day again
WE ARE MARCHING
Going to, rob, steal, one more time again
WE ARE MARCHING
Tonight to celebrate one more time again
