I hear the horde get closer
Hitting the ground with his anger
They will have no mercy
On the way to my land they will die!

Listen my words, foreign man
Listen to our swords, cutting the wind
We will defend this land from your conquest
Just listen the heretics, the words of the wise.

Silence your words, your empty prophecies!
You can't usurp what runs through my veins!
We'll burn the remains of your attempt to conquer
Our wilderness, is full of grateful sway.

Severed flesh, blood stains the fields
Certainly, the sunset is faded in red
We can only respect what we see
The anger of gods, on them will fall.

Listen my words, foreign man
Listen to our swords, cutting the wind
We will defend this land from your conquest
Just listen the heretics, the words of the wise.
