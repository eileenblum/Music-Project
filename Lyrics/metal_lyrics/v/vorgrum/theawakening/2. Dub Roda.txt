Keep your hands off my sword
I will tell you a secret, but keep your word
Do not disturb the story again
Or the only thing you will get will be pain

Look at this piece.
Remains of the burnt tree
Seems strange that I have this!
I got in my last years
Might not believe me
But I saw him standing.
He could breathe like a god
With the forest, watching

A sad day it happened.
Flames, turned green
His power is going to end
Is what had to be.
Future generations may not see it
But you'll have luck
I will describe it for you

Those branches, they could cover.
Those fears that haunt us from childhood.
Its height exceeded the ego of man,

The power emanating from his presence did not compare to no king, no emperor, with any man.
Impaled on the sacred ground.

The great lay there, day and night
Helping travelers who needed help.
The day of the slaughter ended her life.
And the existence of many of us.

The hope that his remains allow to grow a branch.
Is something that becomes a vain wish.
Might happen soon or not.
