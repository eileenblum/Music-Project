Don't try to resist
When we are fucking pissed
You cannot attack
You are out of luck

Learn what's respect
And start to repent
Take back your words
And from this world be gone!

Take down the priest
Tear off his skin
And now,
And now,
Cut him into pieces and
Serve him for dinner!
Dinner!

Soon soup will be served
We like it very crispy
With roast potatoes
To fill my belly
