Watch your step below
My path you will follow
Be the guest of the unknown
Or roam, lost, on your own

Be welcome, at last
You got here fast
I have the answers you seek
I hope that you are not weak

Don't be scared of me
I am here to make you see
What the price is gonna be
If you try to disagree

This is not your place
Here you don't belong
If my words you don't obey
You'll be dead before too long

Be welcome, at last
You got here fast
I have the answers that you seek
I hope that you are not weak

Don't be scared of me
I am here to make you see
What the price is gonna be
If you try to disagree
