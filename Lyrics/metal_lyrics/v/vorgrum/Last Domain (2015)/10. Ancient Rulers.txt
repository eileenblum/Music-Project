The air smells rotten

Nightly creatures have arisen

Ancient screamers, they crawl the earth with one purpose

Submit the sinners, the rebels that want to impose their rules against the first commands that were imposed to rule them all

The end feels close

And all living things come to an end

Forgotten essence of life, now you'll be reborn

Oi oi oi

Behold the elders, the ancient rulers

They come from above

They want you to subject to their desire to dominate your most aberrant fears

Regardless of your bravest ways, Behold - they raised!

Behold the elders, the ancient rulers

They come from above

They want you to subject to their desire to dominate your most aberrant fears

Regardless of your bravest ways, they raised!

Before the cataclysm begins

No way to rewind, god's giving birth to a superior mind taken from the cosmos,

It's giving a new beginning to the pure

Starting the clock of life once more
