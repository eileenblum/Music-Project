Welcome to a world that's lost!
Come and see its flaws!

We became a threat for our innocence,
The morning light will shut down in our presence
We try to teach you how our ignorance
Relates to our wishes of true magnificence

We should listen for a moment and retrieve the virtue of patience.
We are mastering the art of "ruining the world".
Dark times are getting closer by the day and something must be done.
Abandon stagnancy and fight for your kind.

The clockwork of decadence is running and we are bringing the pieces,
We became a crossroad for the rupture of the human crown.
Another truth gets lost into the wind, just pray to rot in peace under the ground.

You were taught to be mindless from the cradle
Take your words into the real battle.

Get up and cast aside every fear
Consequences will not be dodged with fake tears
Before it's too late
And the worms devour your flesh
And your remains start to rot
