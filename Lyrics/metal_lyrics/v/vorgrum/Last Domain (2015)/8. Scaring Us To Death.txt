When the rain hits like a fist,
And the wind freezes trough the mist,
Shadows will mourn and merge in one
And in despair we will be drawn.

As we walk into the abyss,
We feel the pressure in our ears.
They will devour once again,
They chase and smell the fear!

They are calling!
Laughing to our ears,
Scaring us to death!

Dragging us into lucid dreams
They're crushing us with loud screams
Shadows will mourn and merge in one
And in despair we will be drawn.

As we walk into the abyss,
We feel the pressure in our ears.
They chase and smell the fear!
They chase and smell the fear!

Light starts to fade from your eyes while fear and terror take over your mind, hahaha!
