You were teached by the word
By the sword
By misericord
And now you lie on the floor

The fight has ended
And you just want more
You never thought
This could be your last war

You run out of breath
By yourself,
In the edge of your world
You are deaf,
The cries of the battle can't reach you
The ancients beseech you
You must stand!

You fall on the ground
You fall by the ledge of your life
Once and for all you will be gone

You are dealing with
Another kind of fight
That plays cruel games on your mind

You are wishing to see
That victory's near
Your ego conceals you
You just can't see clear

Rise your fist
Upon the skies
This act will become
The last of your life
Just behold
The grim reaper is near
He's coming to take you
Far away from here

Now the sky is filled with stars
Your shining light will reach their hearts
