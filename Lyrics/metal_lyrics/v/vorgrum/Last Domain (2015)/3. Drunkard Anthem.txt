Rise up your pints
Throw them to the roofs
It's time to preach
To the gods of the woods

Wake to the smell
Of the daily booze
Take a deep breath
And tell me the truth

Has time stopped,
Or am I just too drunk?
I don't give a shit
Bring me my fucking tank

One isn't enough
Faster you go harder you fall

Rise up your pints
Throw them to the roofs
It's time to preach
To the gods of the woods

Smoke in the air
Puke on the floor
I can't see straight
Can't drink anymore

Has time stopped,
Or am I just too drunk?
I don't give a shit
Bring me a fucking tank

One isn't enough
Faster you go harder you fall
