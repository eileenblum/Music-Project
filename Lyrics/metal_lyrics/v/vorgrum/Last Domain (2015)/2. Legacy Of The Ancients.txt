You will remember
The ancient days
When the courage led
Your way of life

When pride
Was pure and true for all
(one for all)
(all for one)

Wine mingled with blood
Swords drawn to honor the gods

(to honor the...)

Raise your fists,
Your swords and myths

Shed the blood of the lamb that meets its line,
The border of life and death
Shall be chosen by those who want
To be saved from selfish greed

Wine mingled with blood
Swords drawn to honor the gods

Arise! My pride's alive
My strength, my life
The end is near

Arise! My pride's alive
My strength, my life
The end is near
