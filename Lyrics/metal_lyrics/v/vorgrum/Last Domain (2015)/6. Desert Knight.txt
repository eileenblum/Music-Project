A thousand year slumber,
Arise from the sand,
Desert knight awaken
To reconquer the land.

King in exile,
Shining black crown
Only fit for him
Bringing death to all.

Watch and fear the desert knight

The sands are calling for blood once more
So sharp, so dry, they feed from the king's allure
The lone walker, seeking for closure.	

Villages burning, heads are rolling,
No one's spared and no one's left.
Corpses twisted, ripped and torn
To the point of no return.

The deeds are done,
Half king - half knight,
Return to the sand,
To leave the light.

Sleep once more,
And peace will reign,
'Til your return
The sands will feed again.

A thousand year slumber,
Arise from the sand,
Desert knight awaken
To reconquer the land.

Watch and fear the desert knight

The sands are calling for blood once more
So sharp, so dry, they feed from the king's allure
The lone walker, seeking for closure.	

Villages burning, heads are rolling,
No one's spared and no one's left.
Corpses twisted, ripped and torn
To the point of no return.
