We are gathering you
To steal the light
Darken the skies
And bring up the night

Your life's real perception
Is not going to work
We dominate your thoughts
We teach you the futhark

We are the first and the last
To rule you all by one single religion

And now you're understanding
The true meaning of life,
The balance of the essence
Even afterlife

Can you see the clouds taking forms above your head
Taking you tears, and making them our needs.
Let yourself be carried to this limbo of perdition, creeper perfection

The creeper has taken control my dear, no one here gets out alive!

Can you see the clouds taking form above you head
Taking you tears, and making them our needs.
Let yourself be carried to this limbo of perdition, creeper perfection
