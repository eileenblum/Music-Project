I want to sing, scream and shout to this songs
We've listened to a billion times
And believed every word
They gave me more than one good reason
To avoid, to hide from the first morning lights,
From this lie called life

I don't want to grow up
Don't wake to make this choice
There are no rights

There're only wrongs

We have to take responsibility
For the rest of our lives
Are you fucking kidding me?

And now I have to set on fire
Everything I ever fucking loved

I want to choose the right not to choose

I don't want this summer's end

This is the last summer of our lives
This is the last summer of our youth
This is the last summer of my life
