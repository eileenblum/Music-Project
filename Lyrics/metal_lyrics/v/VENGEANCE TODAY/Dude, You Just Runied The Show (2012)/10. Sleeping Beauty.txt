This city sleeps tonight
The abased streets under orange lights
It still remains the same, there is no end in sight
And I walk around, and I walk around...

This city sleeps tonight.
Seems this has been for a long long time.
And I walk around
With all these thoughts spinning in my mind.

Passing all these empty houses,
Lost places, forsaken homes.
Do you remember those sandbox dreams we made?
Echoes of a long gone urban legacy,
Fallen perspectives of a ruined society.
This is a dead town story.
We ranges trough canyons
Raised by our fathers bare hands
Looking for some daze and redemption.

We are the homeless.
We are the restless,
The forgotten, the lost ones.

In this sleeping beauty,
In this hollow nightmare
Are we sleeping or are we dead?

In this sleeping beauty,
In this hollow nightmare
Are we still sleeping or are we already dead?
