Goodbye to you, mom and dad,
Brothers and sisters, with all my love.
I'm heading north, seeking for the hope
The better life we all have been told.
I will take the rocky road, pass along the old bridge
Through the forest, through the desert.
Hey, mom, I will see the ocean,

The sun will guide my way,
The rain will wash away my tracks
Not resting any single moment
Not resting, I'm always on the run.

My dears, I've been so close,
Just a few miles to go
Vultures are circling
But these old boots won't let me down

I can smell the ocean
The ferry man, I gave him all I got
Crowded boat, strung out bodies, hungry faces
But I can see this shine
This shine in their eyes
We share all the same dreams

It's raining
The storm is coming in
The waves are getting higher
Any other place, any other place but this

A voice is yelling 'Get the fuck up!'
Beneath barbed wire, over concrete walls
The sun will guide my way,
The rain will wash away my tracks
A soldier screams 'get on your knees,
Hands on the back of your head'
Don't worry mum, now I know
I found the promised land
