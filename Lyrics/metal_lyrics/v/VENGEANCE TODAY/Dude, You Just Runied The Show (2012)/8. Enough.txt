How much more time
Do you need to stop
Believing that everything
Has already been decided
And you can do nothing
Than watch the fall
And think it's enough
Just to say wise words?

We all what price we'll have to pay if we try
To interrupt the system's game of shattering our minds
Destroying environment or abusing animals
As machines and food

That's why we only lean back
That's why we fucking relax
It seem we only get used to our death bed

Pursuit of profit is the power
That controls everything around us

The wealthiest society of all times
Creates and sustains the sickest of ideas
Racism, fascism, sexism
We have to smash it with our actions
Because there's nothing left to say
In the defense of letting this nightmare happen
