Using these words as slander
You just disgrace yourself
What if I am gay?
Does it make a difference?
I wish I were 'just to piss you off'

Straight, queer, inter, trans
We're all different
Straight, queer, inter, trans
We're all equal
Straight, queer, inter, trans
We're all scum
We're all scum, the whole society
We're all scum, you and me
