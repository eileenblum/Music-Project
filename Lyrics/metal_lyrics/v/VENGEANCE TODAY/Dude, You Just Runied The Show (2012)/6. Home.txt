I can't sleep
As long as this fire burns inside of me
The final words aren't spoken
I will never forget
What I am fighting for
I will never stop
Struggling against your oppression

This is where we stay
This is our place of freedom
This is where we belong
I will never leave
We will never leave our home

This is where we stay
This is where we belong
This is where I stay
I will never, never leave my home
