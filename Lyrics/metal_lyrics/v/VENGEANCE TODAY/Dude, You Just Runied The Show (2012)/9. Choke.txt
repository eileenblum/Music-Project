These are my last words
I'm bearly breathing
These are my last words
Iâm dying on the inside,
Asking for meaning
I see the world crushing down
I see the world crushing down ... in front of me

All our hearts are filled with hatred
Living life in slow motion
Watching the world pass us by
Our souls got fucking cold,
Crippled and worthless
Destroyed by the world

My mother told that God would be a guide
Fuck religions, they only make us blind

Knowing what mankind is able to
Makes me choke
Just suppressing the thoughts of demise
We fucking provoked
Like in a respirator, thereâs no life in my eyes
Belted on an electric chair, Iâm just waiting to dye
My thoughts are dashing at the speed of light
The sight is losing, the breathing gets tight
Everything wents black,
I give up the fight
