Another great night,
Let's toss the fucking coin.
Ready for the next round
Ready for the final fight

Three more days without sleep
Three more days until your last fucking breath
Cold skin, dead eyes, broken teeth
You're just an empty shell
One way ticket, dead man walking
Any last words?
Just another hit, the golden shot
Your story's been told

There is no excuse for what you've done
You sold your soul and you your chances

Wanted to be a winner
Thought you found the key
For the bright side of life
You never read the leaflet
For your magic medicine

It's just one of your last coffin nails

Let's toss the fucking coin
One last time.
You've lost your stake
Cause I choose life.
