You're hiding behind the God you created
And you still believe in
I see you hiding behind the laws and values you made
Declared as infallible
I see you trying to stop the revolution
By offering people a fucking illusion

I'm not gonna live a life that's worthless
I'm gonna think for myself, not being a servant
The purpose of life is a life with a purpose
I'm not gonna live a life that's worthless

Knowing that some people are conscious and awake
You declared them as terrorists
They got observed, beaten and arrested
But the day will come and the struggle ends
When you can't afford the power to resist
Because I won't serve you anymore

One day you won't stop the revolution
