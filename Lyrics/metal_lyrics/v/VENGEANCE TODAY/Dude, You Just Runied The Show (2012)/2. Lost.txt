What are we entitled to expect?
All hopes are dead, we saw them bleed
The glorious days never existed
Realize the facts

We are dancers at the world's funeral
At the end of the line
This is the abyss of our lives
Generation lost
Generation nothing to lose, nothing to look up to
Generation next
Next thrill, next round, next hype
Generation bored
Generation innocence lost
Before we even fucking had it
Before we even fucking had it

Cold looks from cold eyes
Nothing to win, no first price
The irony of our lives
The only fight is to survive
