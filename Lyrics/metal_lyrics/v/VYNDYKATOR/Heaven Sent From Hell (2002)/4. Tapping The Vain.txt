When my skin is open wide
You can see my soul
Take a piece you may learn
Feelings run like open wires
Naked to the touch
Bleeding truth I expire
Bitter fires burn

Fear descends from hills of ignorance
Death ending in the killers view
Aggressive oracles of loneliness
Tottering demi-gods bring emptiness
Contemplating images of you

Gloating in my darkest hour, sacrifice demands
Amulet of rising power
Once possessed by illusion
Losing what was gained
Meeting its resolution
Resurrect the game

Fabricate stirring tales of chivalry
Amputate golden wings
Fascination lures you to its Calvary
Termination closes possibility
Apparition chant
