You hold the key of your fate
You bless the sign of hate
Eyes in hills stare through me
A change has come over me

I have no time to chase
The end is here now
Now in Hell
Yes in hell
Time will tell
I'll not leave
You shall not be
Ever free
Beneath me

Carve every inch
Every inch of your soul
You turned away
When I gave you my hand
Now you will pay
With your life
With your life
