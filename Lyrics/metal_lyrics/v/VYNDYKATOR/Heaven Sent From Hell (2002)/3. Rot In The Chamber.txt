Accused of Crimes
Scapegoat for a Mob

They need to accuse
To satisfy their souls

Now I wait for the Truth to be revealed

Until that day
My Life Concealed

[Chorus]
FREE ME FROM THIS FATE
YEARS PASS I CANNOT WAIT
FREE ME FROM THIS FATE

No Mercy!
My Life now Worthless
What Mercy?

I Lie awake and Hope that
Some god proves me Innocent
Find the Real Man
Take me from this prison

The Noises!
My Fears Rise!
The Noises!
A Man Shackled thrown to the floor
I'm dragged hastily, hastily! Out the door!

There's Mercy!
A Strange Revelation
There's Mercy!

The Truth told All lies past
The Real Man Serves at last
Rot In The Chamber
His End is My Beginning

Here I sit the truth has been revealed

Painful Memories
Haunting and Unreal

Ripping through My mind I cannot Sleep at all
I am Free or Am I Free?
A Brand New Prison Wall

[Chorus]
FREE ME FROM THIS FATE
YEARS PASS I CANNOT WAIT
ROT IN THE CHAMBER!
DIE IN THE CHAMBER!!

ROT IN THE CHAMBER!!!!
