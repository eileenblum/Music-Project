Faces, lost for all times
Traces, which led to your crimes
Mercy, release me from destiny
Victim, of insanities reign
Chosen, by the evil messiah
Mercy, I throw myself at you

[Chorus]
Blood Stain
Stained Gallows

Terrors, the act the gods
Mirrors, your dark twisted soul
Mercy, I plead you for innocence
Dropfloors, snap to attention
Races, not one stone unturned
Mercy, I live through command

[Chorus]
Blood Stain
Stained Gallows

Faces, with eyes of lost souls
Places, where fires will roar
Mercy, the savior was I
Swing now and you sin no more
Slowly, your life will now drain
Mercy, I am the wrong man

[Chorus]
Blood Stain
Stained Gallows
