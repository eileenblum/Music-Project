There's no other way that all this would end,
For me, here and now, time must have a stop
At last...
Knowing he's at large somewhere,
Waiting 'till my foot slips so he could get me
One day, one day.

New born, wake me -
There's a dream recurring in my head,
New born, wake me -
With a chance to start over again.

It's the place out of sight,
But I can see it before me:
It hurts
Again and again and again...

"Come now, I shall mold you,
In the likeness and image
Of me."

New born, wake me -
There's a dream recurring in my head,
New born, wake me -
With a chance to start over again.

New born, wake me -
There's a dream that's recurring in my head,
New born, wake me -
With a chance to start over again.

There's no other way that all this would end,
For me, here and now, time must have a stop
At last...

Going outside seems a test of strength,
Everywhere I can sense his scent.
He moves now and then behind every shadow.
Every face is his face, there's a whisper again...

"Pain - we're only here through pain,
Through pain, through pain."

The memory of touch brings shudder,
The scars awake - I relive it all again,
All again.

There's no peace for me 'till my days
End, no hand caressed the paths that never mend,
Never mend...

Pain - we're only here through pain,
Through pain, through pain.
