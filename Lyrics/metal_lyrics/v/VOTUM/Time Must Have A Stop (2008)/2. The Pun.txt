Tracing pattern that's burnt in my head
Sailing through veins that twist in my flesh
I remember I have always been pushed around
There's a line none of us would allow to trespass

She was there to annihilate all the pain
Saw it plain as I ripped through milky flesh
Strange it seemed why she wouldn't comply
Apprehension?s so hard to defy

In an instant it showed she was scars just like me
In an instant it showed she was scars:

Wish I hadn't been deaf and dumb to the world
Never noticed a blast, heard a whisper a shot
Sometimes felt like a mocking gift from the God
It seems I only knew I existed when hurt

In an instant it showed she was scars just like me
In an instant it showed she was scars...
