Turn away on my creation - I guess I should have known
Not one to comprehend it.
The two of us - me and my love,
We make a perfect pair
An open wound united.

Hold on tight,
Hold on tight...
"How can she be so cruel and flinch away from my caress?"

The noose gets tighter, dogs have caught the scent.
We have no time to spare, we've got to shake them off now.
I've seen my face in the news tonight.
They make a beast of me,
A bunch of brainless fools.

Just hold on tight
'Cause all I ever need is but the end.
Just have faith in me, we can't fail now -
All I ever need is but the end.

Another town, we're moving fast but Still they are on the track,
Starting to lose my head now.

The babble's on, over and over again
Called it a "ghastly deed" -
They just can't understand we

Hold on tight
'Cause all I ever need is but the end.
They can never build a wall between us
'Cause all I ever need is but the end...
