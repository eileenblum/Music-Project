I never thought that night would change my life so entirely -
An evening at an old friend's house, a glass of wine...
I was supposed to stay 'till eight, but then again I thought
I'll take another train back home
I'll take another train back home

The time has come for me to go, though they insisted:
"Stay for the night," they said, "streets look so empty tonight."
I'll take another train back home
I'll take another train back home
Take another train

The second I opened the door is still coming back to me every night;
I wish I could take a halt and turn back time.

There on the doorsteps I looked at the stars -
Twinkling pranksters spun my time -
I took a deep breath and thought: "Life's beautiful".

Somewhere in the night
That train's still rolling...

Somewhere in the night
My train's still running...
