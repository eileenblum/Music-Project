I'll raise the blade into a heart
I have found a way to make you mine

Late afternoon, she steps out of the bright-lit road
It's now or never, I haven't seen her alone for so long,
For so long ...

You
Enchanted me, conquered me
You, it's all for you
These lines I carve run warm -
A monument of love on you

Let me shape you
Let me hold ...

I'll raise the blade into a heart
I have found a way to make you mine

The path they will trace -
The scars can never mend
Through blood you've spilled I'll display
A masterpiece of love, of love
