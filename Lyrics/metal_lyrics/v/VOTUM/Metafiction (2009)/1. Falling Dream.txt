Hello there
Iâd kill for some company
Iâd trade my soul for a whisper
Iâd die for a touch

I canât seem to feel anything
Sounds familiar?
Now does it move you?
For sure, Iâm not moved an inch.

Itâs this falling dream, never coming true,
This falling dream â I can almost taste it.
Itâs this falling dream, never coming true,
This falling dream â¦
I never fell complete.

Itâs all in this head, scrawled on a doctorâs note
Like a curse â
This sentence, it truly is one.
Or is it all in my head?
Waking me up in horror â the fact that Iâm awake.

Iâm here, Iâm not anywhere

I wish I had limbs to move
Wish I had eyes to give a meaningful stare
I wish I had lips to ask, Iâd beg you to let me go
Have mercy, oh mercy â¦

I beg you to let me go,
Seems familiar?
Like a broken record, like broken glass â¦
I stopped counting rays,
I lost count of days.
Years would frighten, if I knew â
Itâs like a curse.

Iâm here and Iâm not anywhere
Anywhere
Anywhere

Itâs this falling dream, never coming true,
I can almost taste it.
Itâs this falling dream, never coming true,
I never fell completely

I beg you to let me go,
Seems familiar?
Like a broken record, like broken glass â¦
I stopped counting rays,
You know I lost count of days.
Years would frighten, if I knew â
Itâs like a curse.

Itâs this falling dream, never coming true,
This falling dream â I can almost taste it.
Itâs this falling dream, never coming true,
This falling dream â¦
I never fell â¦
