Brought into line with the rhythm
Try hard to set your eyes open
Look around, thereâs no one here
You could recognize
No familiar faces define your presence
Here

Here, in this room
Here, in this bed
Here, at the time.

It was all meant to be a definite solution,
A definite solution? -
No further questioning
No further questioning? -
It was all meant to be â¦

One desperate run through the window
The sun is glittering on crystal vibes
Running desperate, the glassy essence
Of broken light, like broken limbs

Hear the sound, the pulsating âmeâ
On the screen
I can watch myself flicker
To the fatal beat
The beat of the rush of painful ups and downs

Running desperate through the window
Glittering like sun on crystal vibes,
Running desperate, the glassy essence
Of broken light, broken limbs

Running desperate
A dream within a dream
Forgive the acting, forgive the actingâ¦
Running desperate
It all seems so unreal
What am I doing here?
And somehow -
Stand still gasping

Running desperate
Running â¦
Iâm running
