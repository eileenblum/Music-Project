Iâm right back on my feet
Iâm back in the saddle â
You make me whole again.

Itâs like weâd never part,
Now weâre together.
So glad to have you back

Chase away
You chase away the blur
Make that face
You chase away the blur

Itâs a cold day and
Weâre hand in hand again.
- Youâd always make these faces to me -

Make me rise and shine,
Iâm so anxious to have you.
- Sometimes I have them nightmares -

Chase away
Chase away the blur
Make that face
And chase away â¦
