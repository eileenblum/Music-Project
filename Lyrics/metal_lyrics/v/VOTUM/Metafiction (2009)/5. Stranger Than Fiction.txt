The road â¦ it winds snakelike
The wish to shed the spying headlights
The plot needs a solid twist now

I say that you burn
And you burn â¦

The cause-and-effect rule
Is it the relentless code of fiction
That made her steer off the clear track?
Blurred out of view and faded â¦

It never stops haunting â
Youâre here
And the next thing I know
Youâre gone,
Just as I wrote it.
These words â
They have bodies and faces
They live.

Fact or print â you are bound with me,
Now and then youâre entwined in me

Be it fate or plot â you are tied with me,
Here and there youâre confined in me

It never stops haunting â
Youâre here
And the next thing I know
Youâre gone,
Just as I wrote it
These words â
They have bodies and faces
They die
