Wait â¦
Rid the folly and help me through the rain
Wait,
Rid my folly and help me to forget

Donât let go of me
Though itâs so hard with me â
When with you it feels like â¦
Donât give in now
Wish I were different, when with you it feels like
Home

You never realize it when itâs there
Unappreciative of what you have.
How odd we drown the ones we love in hurt;
The trial of tears you went through was not deserved.

You never comprehend it âtill itâs gone
Having all the love she gave, still wanted more.
I poisoned every day we shared with spite;
How odd we drown the ones we love
In humiliation and hurt?

Donât let go of me
Though itâs so hard with me â
When with you it feels like â¦
Donât give in now
Wish I were different, when with you it feels like
Home

You never realize it when itâs there
Unappreciative of what you have.
You never comprehend it âtill itâs gone
Having all the love she gave, I still asked for more
Still wanted more â¦
