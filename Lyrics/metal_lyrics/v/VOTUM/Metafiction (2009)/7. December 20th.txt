It's a cold winter day
A man wakes up
Takes a hot shower chasing sleep away
A lottery winning ticket still sleeping in his jacket
He knows not of it yet
He knows not of it yet

On a cold winter day
A woman puts her make-up on
She's already set the table and breakfast's prepared
Soon her family is up, time to get them ready
For the rest of the day
The rest of the day

On the very same day
An old woman stirs and
With a screech the bed sighs, or is it bones
She knows it's gonna be hard to get up
Though she's been awake
Awake for long

Donât
Glass
Gather
Round

Ruby
Snow
Fell
Winter

Though they don't know yet
They will meet that day,
They will gather round
They'll watch in horror

A bright winter day,
A man leaps out
Out of the window,
A red halo âround his head
Snowflakes fell like

Glass â¦

Donât ( the urge of it )
Glass ( the frailty of you )
Gather ( the faces of you )
Round ( itâs just the pieces of you )
Ruby ( the smell of it )
Snow ( itâs just the beauty of it )
Fell ( the pieces of you )
Winter ( itâs just the cold of it all )

Though they don't know yet
They will meet that day,
They will gather round
They'll watch in horror â¦
