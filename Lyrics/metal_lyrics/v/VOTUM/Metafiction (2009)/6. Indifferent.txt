Safe and dark,
As the rays of wandering light
Drown in the glass

Yet another gulp
To see me flicker, see me altered
See me understood

Another taste of liquid comprehension
To see me gone.

Letâs hit a new âlowâ this time â¦

Safe in the dark
As the remnants of wandering thought
Drown in the glass

Yet another sip
To gain perspective, to accept the change
And mend my ways â
Mend my ways?

A funny thing, isnât it?
How I deterred everyone I loved from loving me

Safe in the dark
Letâs hit a new âlowâ this time â¦

Low â¦
Low, I â¦
