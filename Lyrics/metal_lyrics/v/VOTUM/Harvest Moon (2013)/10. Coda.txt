Passing by the lake.
One would see him wildly
Waving arms:
Or with a vacant stare.
Sitting on his haunches--
What a sight...
What a sight...
What a sight...

He's such a grim grotesque.
Dancing...
Dancing there in the moonlight
Or in turn crying out his eyes.

He speaks to the water...

Another poor damned soul.
Or is it.
Who loved the hill and the cloud
As he tried to capture a moon in his trembling embrace

He talks to the water...

Ripe is the time. I immerse
Adam's ale or devil's brew.
As the water breaks.
Taking me back inside.

Brought up to code.
I'll be cleansed
Of the filth that I've become.
As the waters break.
Taking me back inside.

Going under...

"Fu I loved the high cloud and the hill.
Alas, he died of alcohol.
And Li Po also died drunk.
He tried to embrace a moon
In the Yellow River."

Ripe is the time. I immerse--
Adam's ale or devil's brew.
As the water breaks.
Taking me back inside.

Brought up to code.
I'll be cleansed
Of the filth that I've become.
As the waters break.
Taking me back inside.

Going under...
