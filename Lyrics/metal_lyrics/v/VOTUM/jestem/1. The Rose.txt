Since the time of Christ generations kept and passed the explosive pages
In a fleur-de-lis and an even cross the truth had found its home.

The Solomon's temple hid what once had been, buried underneath it lay
A group of nine set out for the task - The Order of the Temple.

Tear it out,
Open their eyes to the forgery, tear it out
Tear it out,
Reveal Rome's sinister conspiracy, let the Rose shine.

The rock gave way, soon they disposed of what the Church hated and feared of most
Their power grew and their numbers swelled under the sign of Rose.

Thirteenth century saw their fast decline at dawn of the thirteenth hour
At the cost of life they remained in guard, for the sacred cup they burnt.

Tear it out,
Open their eyes to the forgery, tear it out
Tear it out,
Reveal Rome's sinister conspiracy, let the Rose shine.

The modern tongue has never spoke
The words few ancients knew of
But the secret lived in songs of lore
Guided by an ancient code.

Many vanished unheard of
In quests for the elusive treasure
Still the secret strives hidden well guided by an ancient code.

Tear it out,
Open their eyes to the forgery, tear it out
Tear it out,
Reveal Rome's sinister conspiracy, let the Rose shine.
