Clearer. Clearer
Unaware there's something in the air
An illusion in the air
We're breathless now
We've never known how to take a breath
We've forgotten what's up there
Dreamy-eyed child
Staring at the sky
You can't deny the ground is bleeding. The roots are like chains
Why don't you fly now?
Defying
Defying gravity
Don't melt your wings. Fly!
Fake
Clear, it's clear now
Don't you dare take a cowardly look down
Fearless. Fearless now
Passing stone-dead angels falling down
