Confusion
Fell you, muddy ground
Compassion
My eternal prize
Father, please forgive them
They don't have a clue
Preying on the saviour
Fading, you're fading
Staring at my kind
Poor you
Silly beings
Hiding, struggling
Blind you!
And I can't justify it
Their failure
The will. The failure.
And I can't just deny it
It kills me
Don't play with fire
Failing. You're failing
Where's my tricky friend
Of gloom
I'm disappointed
Tired
Of your
Inconsequence to use fire
Don't play with fire!
