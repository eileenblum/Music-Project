The light is weak enough
To let you speak
Ignore the right to fear
You're bound by what you dream
Curiosity
The fruit of a plastic tree
Come closer I am here
And be my
Satellite
That's what you are
My sinner
Come closer
I am here
And be my
Dying light
You're burning down
There's no way out of me
There's one way in
Just trust my eyes, you'll see
My voice, its subtlety
My lips absolve
Is this fake all you need?
Don't you want it?
