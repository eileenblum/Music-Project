I'm glad to see
Your clichÃ© pure behaviour
There's no need for your fright. Sweetest child.
Infected mind. Fragile mind
With the same high hopes
Since you gave us the right to protect you now
From seeking
Another blame to initiate. Within you
Another faith to stimulate. Within you
We brought you home
Away from the pain of your saviour
You should seek what we want you to find
You have to fear the other
You need him to disappear
Keep calm and clear the way for us
In between them and us there's no room to hide
Another blame to initiate. Within you. But without you
Another faith to stimulate. Within you. But without you
Another mind to penetrate. Without you
We used to water the blackened tree. Without you
