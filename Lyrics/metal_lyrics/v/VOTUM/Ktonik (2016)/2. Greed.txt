See they know
The way you dream
An open book of distress
'Cause they feel me'
I think they know what you're dying for
'Please make them feel me'
The pictures you would absorb
Again!
Let them in!
Feed that greed!
See they know
The womb of yours
The warm surroundings' sway
'And they can feel me'
The entertaining snare you absurd
'Cause they can feel me'
Again!
