Good enough to slink, to creep, to crawl, to stray between the needs
Be a good son, play your part
Set your sight on passing time, your smile, your joy, your merchandise
Good enough to play your part
Welcome to your times. Blind son
Save your prayers. Walk with me
Want to save what's inside
Save what's still there
The innocence
Want to save trusting eyes
Hopeful eyes
Inner light
Come now
To grow, to hope, to climb and fall
To try, to form, to decompose
Be a good boy, take your dose
To overrate the musts you've got
To be prepared to pay the price
Be a good son, take it now
Want to save what's inside
Save what's still there
The innocence
Want to save trusting eyes
Hopeful eyes
Inner light
The sweet irony
The circle never breaks
Oh sweet irony, help
This circle never breaks
