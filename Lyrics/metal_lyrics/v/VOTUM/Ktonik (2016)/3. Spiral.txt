Come. Again. Float. Again
Everything's gonna be fine
Brother. Just look at you
You used to be a patsy treated good
Sister. Blind when forced
You used to call this slavery. Loyalty of love
Oh. I thought it over
It's coming coming
Inside you
And you can feel it
The spiral
It's coming after you
Upward with the spiral
It's coming after you
Sane. Freak. Sleeps. Within you
Let. Him. Speak.
