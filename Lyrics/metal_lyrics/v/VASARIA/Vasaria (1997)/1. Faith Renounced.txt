Here I stand, a forsaken man searching ceaselessly
If you could see inside of me, passion wills to be.
With open arms I welcome the rain
And lament its ultimate untimely demise.
All the cadavers have been exhumed
And all that remains is my return.. I have returned

Within its name I denounce
Upon all
Faith renounced.

A shadowy place, a consuming taste, frantic intrinsically
Atop the flames I'm gazing down in comprehension
It's been said that the more things change
The more they'll always come to be exactly the same
Can the profound perhaps conquer time
Or the remembrance of the future?
Remember...

[Chorus]

Spaces still fill the time unaligned
The ground is emptied as all comes to be.
Souls earthbound left to lay to rest
Renounce.. rebury the exhumed
All of them
Good night...

All that remains is my return

[Chorus]
