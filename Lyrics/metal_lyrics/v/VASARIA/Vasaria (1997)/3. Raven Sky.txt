How long is forever?

I used to gaze up towards you, raven sky
Midnight clouds they gently sailed above
Serenity in your soothing mother's will,
Eternally an inspiration to me

But up above my head
There is a storm and lightning is everywhere
Raven Sky
It's not like before and I wonder why

And the pain t lingered on and on
An agony that you didn't understand
But I tried to endure, to withstand
You know I tried, I tried the best I can

[Chorus]

Why?
I wonder why it's not like before

[Chorus]

Now alone I gaze at the full moon
And there is death in the cold night air
Once again as they do, our paths cross
From constraint I liberate... the deed consoles

And the pain it lingers on and on
And on and on...
