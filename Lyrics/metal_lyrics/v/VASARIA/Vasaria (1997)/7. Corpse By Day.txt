Spewed up from an unknown grave
Foul and relentless enemy
Non-existent through the day
Lain in soil to fight the sun

Vindicator of the dead
Immortal enshrined
Infestation epidemic
Prime directive in full force
Corpse by day
Sustain to me unnatural life
Corpse by day
Endless nights of diabolical hunger

The subhuman way of death
Oozes from a monsters dream.
A gruesome notoriety
Desperation in its course
Vindicator of the dead
Immortal enshrined
Infestation epidemic
Prime directive in full force.

[Chorus]

By day a corpse, by blood a parasite
Roaming, wanting, yearning scheming
Days fade to nights as nights fade to doom
...endless doom

[Chorus]
