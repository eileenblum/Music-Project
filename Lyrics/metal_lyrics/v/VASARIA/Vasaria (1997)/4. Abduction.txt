Abduction...
There once was a wayword rhyme
Consistency.. a chilling intent
It slithers in, out and around
As it dares to emanate sound
Whether from above or below
Insistent need we've come to know
Abduction of the way it will
There is such to fulfill
Can it be? It's killing me
Abduction of all space and time

Gone past entertaining distraught
Dimensions have all crumbled before
Consciousness, a state to regress
The here and now gone out of control
Whether from above or below
Incessant lies we've come to know

[Chorus]
When you find yourself all alone
Amid darkest thoughts of deepest condone
Strange instincts inside of you thrust
Right or wrong, what must unveil shall prevail.. be still

[Chorus]

What must unveil shall prevail
Once upon a wayward rhyme

Abduction...
