The day had fallen
To the nighttime world
The moon's light filled the sky
Its creatures made the music they make
A dense mist ascended from nowhere
Submerged within, strange woman in white

Together in darkness
For we are one.
We shall live on
Through the centuries to come.

It was her ghostly white face
Her death-cold breath
Fear sensed within my thoughts
Extended to me, plea of a brave new path
Void of human reflection
Submerged, I am no longer afraid

[Chorus]

Once I could hear
And once I could see
Stripped of my soul, it's all part of me
I'd be a fool to carry on

Luna...

[Chorus]

Luna...
