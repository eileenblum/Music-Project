I grab my axe and take a breath
The ritual has begun
On this day where 1000 die
We will make our sacrifice

See them run
Cut them down
Kneeling rats in the dirt
Snap their necks
Now

This is our blood sacrifice
This is our blood sacrifice

No place for the weak
In the hall of the slain
Odin's ravens soar
Above us this day
No chance to submit
Our axes meets flesh
Blood will be spilled
For Odins praise

Sent them to their grave 
With blood spattered blades

As they fall blow by blow
Behead their king
And steal their throne
We stand as one on this dark night
Here we shall make our sacrifice 

This is our blood sacrifice 
This is our blood sacrifice

Blood for blood
Our ancestors call
Blood for blood
Accept this offering
Now

Odin our father
Grant us your strength

See the rivers running red
Hear the screams
Of a thousand dead
Heads will roll from their neck
Odin accept our sacrifice

This is our blood sacrifice 
This is our blood sacrifice
