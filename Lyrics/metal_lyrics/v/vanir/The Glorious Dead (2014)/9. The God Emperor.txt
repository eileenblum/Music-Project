He lives to dominate 
He lives to kill 
Desolation in his wake 
God emperor of man 
He lives to dominate 
He lives to kill
Dragon of bate
Violent and cruel

Paragon of corruption 
See the Murderess viper 
Like a hungry wolf 
Tracking down his prey

He rips the world apart 
through bone and flesh 
The time has come to reap 
Divinity as his crest

The day turns red
As shadows decent
Heir their anguish
This is the end

Paragon of corruption 
Fear his burning wrath 
Torture and death awaits 
For all in bis path

He rips the world apart 
Through bone and flesh 
The time has come to reap 
Divinity as his crest

The day turns red
As shadows decend
Hear their anguish
This is the end 

For I am poison that sets you free
Give yourselves on to me
I take both gold and flesh
All mine to be
Act upon my every need
Behold my divinity

The day turns red
As shadows decend
Hear their anguish
This is the end

God emperor of man
The Blight of Rome
Conqueror of sea and man
Depravity thy name
God emperor of man
The Blight of Rome
Inflicted by lunacy
As poison to the throne

Once a kind ruler, shattered into madness
