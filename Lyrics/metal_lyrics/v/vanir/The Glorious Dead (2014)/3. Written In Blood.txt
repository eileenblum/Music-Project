Warm blood on my hands
The sound of screaming in my ear
Rifle in my hand
gaze opon the battlefleld

Brothers fight by my side
Hold the battle line
Against a blood red tide 
See the bodies of our young 
In the trenches we defend 
As enemies decent

The trenches roar
A world at war

Choose your side
The victor is
Written in blood

Live or die
Our legacy
Written in blood

In muddy fields we charge 
Through gore, blood and bile 
Trenches reek of death 
Were oil on borrowed time

Brothers fight by my side
Hold the battle line
Against a blood red tide 
See the bodies of our young 
In the trenches we defend
As enemies decent

The trenches roar
A world at war

Choose your side
The victor is 
Written in blood
Live or die
Our legacy
Written in blood

Ignite the war machine 
Cannons roar in my head 
We are the korps of death

The trenches roar
A world at war

Choose your side
The victor is
Written in blood
Live or die
Our legacy
Written in blood
