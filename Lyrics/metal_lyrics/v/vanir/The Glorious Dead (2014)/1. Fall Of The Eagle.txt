Set on destruction you march to war 
To conquer and submit 
You brought your legions to our doorsteps 
Now you will suffer defeat 

See them march
their banners high
they will all
fall in the forest
Varus legions 
a thousands of men
their blood will flow
in Teutoburg forest
Barbaric might 
roman pride
it will be
their final hour
all shall die
gruesome deaths
let none of them
flee to Rome

Arminius, lord of war
roman blood will flow

Arminius, lord of war
Fall of the eagle

Arminius, lord of war
roman blood will flow

Arminius, lord of war
Fall of the eagle

No retreat
No were to run
History will remember
Germanic warriors
Storms the field
With a blood thirst and hunger 
On this fray
Where thousands die
The eagle will Fall to the ground
Bodies pile
In the mud
let none of them
flee to Rome

Arminius, lord of war
roman blood will flow

Arminius, lord of war
Fall of the eagle

Arminius, lord of war
roman blood will flow

Arminius, lord of war
Fall of the eagle

Varus your quest stops here 
as your step on barbarian soil
soldiers of Rome despair
Watch your empire in flames

Hear the screams
The Stench of death
As flames rise up higher 
Legionnaires 
Caught with fear
Fights like rapid dogs
Without orders 
Their tactics fail 
The eagleâs wings will snap
Qui Desiderat 
Pacem Praeparet Bellum
This ends tonight

Arminius, lord of war
roman blood will flow

Arminius, lord of war
Fall of the eagle

Arminius, lord of war
roman blood will flow

Arminius, lord of war
Fall of the eagle
