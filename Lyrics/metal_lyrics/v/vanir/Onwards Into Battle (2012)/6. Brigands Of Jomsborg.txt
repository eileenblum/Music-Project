Looting and robbery
A life of jomsblood men
We set our sails from Jomsborgs shores
For women, glory, and gold
Brigands and warriors,
They call us many names
Strong as the god of thunder
We kill, burn, and plunder

Jomsblood - Runs strong in our veins
We will crush your fleet
and bring down your gates
We set sail, for glory, honour, and coin
Mercenaries and warriors of the north

The ocean stirs,
The enemies attack
We hoist our sails
And prepare to fight back
Their numbers are many
But we fear them not
We are Jomsvikings
Warriors of the gods

Jomsblood - Runs strong in our veins
We will crush your fleet
and bring down your gates
We set sail, for glory, honour, and coin
Mercenaries and warriors of the north
