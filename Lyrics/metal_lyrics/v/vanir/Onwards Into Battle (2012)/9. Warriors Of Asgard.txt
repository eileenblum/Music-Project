I look upon this fearless horde
of mighty heathen men and valkyries of Valhalla
The bravest of Midgard, Odin's pride
All are you gathered here, with us here tonight

Warriors of Asgard, sons of the north
Raise every sword high, one and all
Warriors of Asgard, join us and fight
Brothers of battle, we'll never fall

All of you who stands united here
Are warriors chosen by the gods
And even at the face of a mighty foe
You'll stand your ground and fight

Warriors of Asgard, sons of the north
Raise every sword high, one and all
Warriors of Asgard, join us and fight
Brothers of battle, we'll never fall

"Einherjer
and Valkyries fair
Raise your horns
Let the gods hear your voice!"

This heart of battle, is filled with joy
When I look upon this heathen force
And all of you who fight by our side
Will join the gods on the day you die

Warriors of Asgard, sons of the north
Raise every sword high, one and all
Warriors of Asgard, join us and fight
Brothers of battle, we'll never fall
Warriors of Asgard, sons of the north
Raise every sword high, one and all
Warriors of Asgard, join us and fight
Brothers of battle, we'll never fall
