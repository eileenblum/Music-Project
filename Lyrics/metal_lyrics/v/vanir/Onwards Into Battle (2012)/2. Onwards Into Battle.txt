A thunderbolt strikes, the battle is fierce
The gods of war rides over the field
The Ravens of Odin seeks the brave fallen
and through their death, they will find glory

Follow the ways of gods and their might
Warriors ready yourselves for the fight
Onwards to glory, forward to war
They'll flee when vikings land on their shore

Onwards into battle, sons of the north
Glory awaits when we're marching forth
Onwards into battle, show your worth
Our warcry alone will tremble the earth

We hold no fear to armies of Christ
Though they are many and their power is great
But when they arrive with their armies vast
They'll flee when our warriors march on the field

We don't need a plan, just point out the way
We'll strike like a thunderbolt unto the fray
Join us in battle, fight by our side
And you'll end in Valhalla the day you die

Onwards into battle, sons of the north
Glory awaits when we're marching forth
Onwards into battle, show your worth
Our warcry alone will tremble the earth

Weak christians think they can take our land
They'll regret their pride when they fall by our hands
Our god has a hammer, yours got a cross
Meet us in battle and we'll see who's the boss

Onwards into battle, sons of the north
Glory awaits when we're marching forth
Onwards into battle, show your worth
Our warcry alone will tremble the earth

Onwards into battle, sons of the north
Glory awaits when we're marching forth
Onwards into battle, show your worth
Our warcry alone will tremble the earth
