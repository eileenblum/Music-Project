By the hammer they fall!

In the horizon we see; giants and beast
To Asgard they march, to burn and pillage our land
Filled with rage, we call to arm
Spear, axe and sword to bring their armies down

For glory we fight,
With honor we fall
In battle side by side,
Brothers one and all
For glory we fight,
With honor we fall
In battle side by side,
Brothers one and all

By the hammer they fall!
By the hammer they fall!

Giants of Udgard, you'll never win
At the mighty Thor, by his hammer you will fall
By the spear of Odin, your armies laid waste
We are the gods of men, we'll cleanse you from this land

For glory we fight,
With honor we fall
In battle side by side,
Brothers one and all
For glory we fight,
With honor we fall
In battle side by side,
Brothers one and all

Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
By the hammer they fall!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
By the hammer they fall!

By the hammer they faaall!

Einherjer hear our song, to be sung proud and loud
We drive our enemies back, to see them flee from our attack
Praise the god of war; the mighty Thor
Raise your hammer unto their doom!

For glory we fight,
With honor we fall
In battle side by side,
Brothers one and all
For glory we fight,
With honor we fall
In battle side by side,
Brothers one and all
