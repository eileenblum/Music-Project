Fear! Hate!
All shall fall! When Fimbul comes!
Cold! Dark!
Draw your swords! The end has come!

I see the death of a son
I see a winter has come
I see the sun devoured
I see the end
I see darkness surrounds the world
I see mankind despair
I see all bonds break
I see the end

Fear! Hate!
All shall fall! When Fimbul comes!
Cold! Dark!
Draw your swords! The end has come!

I see Fenris loose once more
I see the worm on land
I see the dead arise
I see the end
I see Surtur's march of destruction
I see Naglfar setting sail
I see Loki freed from his cave
I see the end

Lightning strikes
The world is on fire
Revenge is now, the end is near
The northern gods will meet their fate
All bonds will break and brothers fight
Mankind despairs as their gods fall

Jormundandr falls by Thor
The brave son of Odin
Walks nine steps, fall to the ground
Poisoned wounds inflicted
Tyr has lost his second arm
and falls unto the hellhound Garm
Heimdal takes on Loki
as they fall to kill each other

Death and destruction fills the air
This doom is upon us all
Gods are now men alike

Jormundandr falls by Thor
The brave son of Odin
Walks nine steps, fall to the ground
Poisoned wounds inflicted
Tyr has lost his second arm
and falls unto the hellhound Garm
Heimdal takes on Loki
as they fall to kill each other
Fenris falls by Vidars hand
The silent son of Odin
Rips apart his jaws
and the chaoswolf lies bleeding
Surtur sets the world on fire
as everyone has died
All is lost the world has ended
Now a new world arises
