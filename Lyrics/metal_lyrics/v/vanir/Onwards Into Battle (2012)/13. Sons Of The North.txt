The age of legends has come to an end
The stories we know, we stand to defend
and we wish to remember the glorious tales
Of giants and gods and heroes

Do you remember the songs about Thor?
The strong thunder god and the hammer he wore?
The brave son of Odin who defended our realm
against Jotunheim's dark armies.

And if you believe an old world will rise
Gods will stand strong and old songs will be sung
In the halls of Odin

Sad tales about the loss of a son
And joyful songs about wars we have won
Stories of brotherhood and powerful gods
And those of mighty heroes

These are the songs of our past and our pride
A link between ours and the ancient times
A memory of honour, the times we were strong
Which never shall be forgotten

And if you believe an old world will rise
Gods will stand strong and old songs will be sung
In the halls of Odin

We're the defenders of legend and myth
The tales will be sung to the day of our end
And when the times of our last breath has come
We pass through the gates of Heimdal

And if you believe an old world will rise
Gods will stand strong and old songs will be sung
In the halls of Odin

Gone are the days of adventure and might
The stories of gods have slipped into the night
And the strength of the north seems faded away
And only a few remembers.

And when we sing songs about gods of old
We are still strong, we are fearless and bold
We are the sons of the Northland.

And if you believe an old world will rise
Gods will stand strong and old songs will be sung
In the halls of Odin
