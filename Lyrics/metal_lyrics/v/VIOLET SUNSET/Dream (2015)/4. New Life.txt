Nothing to lose,
I'm right here where I belong,
I'm leaving everything to find myself.

There's only hope,
No more shadows in my way,
I was in a world
Where this was just and illusion.

Time, I'm leaving the human I used to be,
There's no time, I'm starting to live a new life.
Time, I'm leaving the human I used to be,
There's no time, I'm starting to live a new life.

I'm running against time to reach my goals,
I'm fighting my fears to find the truth,

Time, I'm leaving the human I used to be,
There's no time, I'm starting to live a new life.
Time, I'm leaving the human I used to be,
There's no time, I'm starting to live a new life.
