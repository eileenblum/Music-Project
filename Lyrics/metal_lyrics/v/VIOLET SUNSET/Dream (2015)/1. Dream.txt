Like a asleep mountain,
Keeping all inside of me,
So afraid to show the world
Who I really am,
I just need a push
And all of my ideas will come out.

In my way I see the sign,
It's the reason of my life,
We're been searching for the sky forever.

I need something that makes
My soul feel alive again,
Something that gives me the strength,
Wake up and take a deep breath,
This is my moment, the time is running,
This is the dream I'll never forget.

But I've opened my eyes
And I realized that
I have this great desire
That is stronger than pain
And this passion, stronger than life.

In my way I see the sign,
It's the reason of my life,
We're been searching for the sky forever.

I need something that makes
My soul feel alive again,
Something that gives me the strength,
Wake up and take a deep breath,
This is my moment, the time is running,
This is the dream I'll never forget.

Fears and doubts tried not to let me move on,
And after having fallen many times,
Confused and disappointed I was about to give up,
Confused and disappointed I was about to give up.

Don't try to break me down,
Don't try to break me down.
But now our destiny is clear and I can see the light,
Don't try to break me down,
Don't try to break me down.

I need something that makes
My soul feel alive again,
Something that gives me the strength,
Wake up and take a deep breath,
This is my moment, the time is running,
This is the dream I'll never forget.

I need something...
