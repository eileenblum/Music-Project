You're so lonely that you believed
You could hold me tied forever
But it's over, you can't deny
That you lost your mind.

You have been hiding your feelings
And every time I hear less your heart beating,
You lost your opportunity,
Now all has disappeared,
I hope you understand this is
A lesson you need to learn.

I will never see you again,
But don't forget what I'm gonna say,
When you feel something real,
You have to let go of your selfishness.

You thought you were going to win,
For first time I am free,
Don't try to be close to me,
Let me live by myself.

I will never see you again,
But don't forget what I'm gonna say,
When you feel something real,
You have to let go of your selfishness.

You're so lonely that you believed
You could hold me tie forever
But it's over, you can't deny.

You thought you were going to win,
For first time I am free,
Don't try to be close to me,
Let me live by myself.

I will never see you again,
But don't forget what I'm gonna say,
When you feel something real,
You have to let go of your selfishness.
