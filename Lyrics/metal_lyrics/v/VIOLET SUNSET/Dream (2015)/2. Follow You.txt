Today our destiny is more than clear,
I follow you, running out of here,
World is a mystery, is our desire
To see the wonders of all time,
This feeling's growing, burning like the fire,
Can you feel the beat? Can you feel the beat?

Hold my hand and I'm gonna be in you way (I'm gonna be in you way)
'Cause nothing's gonna change my mind,
You can see the light deep inside yourself (deep inside yourself)
'Cause nothing's gonna break us down.

I follow you, running out of here to find another way,
I feel our souls, through your eyes I see the future coming,
A revelation showed me that this is our plan and nothing else,
I'll never let you down, call out my name, I'll be there for you.

'Cause nothing's gonna change my mind,
You can see the light deep inside yourself (deep inside yourself)
'Cause nothing's gonna break us down.
