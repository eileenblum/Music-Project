Your uncle is a bar of soap
Your cousin is a lampshade
Your best friend is a candle
And you're a fucking Jew

Your neighbors are a landfill, too bad you got away
But all the Jews that didn't have rotted in the lime pits

50 years later,
You've still got an agenda,
For world domination,
But you'd better think again
To when we had the upper hand,
Der Fuhrer had control,
You kikes were in the cattle cars,
Then shoved into an oven...

Think of all the friends and family you've lost...
Happy Hanukaust!

You claim six million, I wish it were true
But you're a pack of lying fucking Jews
A holocaust memorial built on the land
Where most of your relatives are buried in sand

In bulldozed graves to cover the pollution
Too bad you weren't a part of the final solution
Wearing long sleeves to cover your tattoo
Will never hide the fact that you're a dirty Jew

Think of all the friends and family you've lost...
Happy Hanukaust!

Light the menorah and think of the time
When you sold out your neighbors for a handful of dimes
All those filthy Jews... They must have been pissed
They couldn't buy their way onto Schindler's list

Think of all the friends and family you've lost...
Happy Hanukaust!
