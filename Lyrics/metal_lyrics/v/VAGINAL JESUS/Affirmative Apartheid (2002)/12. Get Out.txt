They wash up on our shows with each tide
Once they get in they get a free ride
I'm sick of it, I've got white pride
Lets go an skin their worthless hides

Get out! Get out! Get out! [2x]

They come to our country and wreck the place
Scare old ladies with their ugly ape face
Niggers and spics selling blow
All I can say is they've gotta go

Get out! Get out! Get out! [2x]

Jews come in and buy everything up
Ruined our economy, where does it stop?
Foreign scum and infectious queers
You're not fucking wanted here

Niggers and spics
Dotheads and gooks
Beaners and Jews
Towlheads and slopes

Whoever called America the melting pot
Should've been taken out and shot
Our forefathers would probably roll in their graves
If they knew we had less than their slaves

Get out! Get out! Get out! [3x]
Get out! Get out! Get fucking out!
