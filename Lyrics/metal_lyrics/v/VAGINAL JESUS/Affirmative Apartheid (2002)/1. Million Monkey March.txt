You march to your mailbox on the first
You march to the liquor store to quench your thirst
You march to your neighbors house to buy crack
You march to your sister's room on the way back

Million Monkey March
You're a fucking spook [2x]

You march to college to fall asleep
You go there for free due to quotas they keep
You march to Washington to get on the news
You mug for the cameras held by the Jews

Million Monkey March
You're a fucking spook [2x]
