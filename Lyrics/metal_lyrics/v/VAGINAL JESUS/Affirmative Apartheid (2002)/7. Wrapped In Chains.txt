When I first saw you black ugly fucks
My father bought you at an auction for a hundred bucks
He's passed on, I own you now
So shine my shoes and drag my plow

Wrapped in chains, just a slave
That's all you'll be, from birth to grave

You're a slave because you're black
You run away, we'll drag you back
Hey Sambo, pick some corn
Or you'll regret the day you were born

Wrapped in chains, just a slave
That's all you'll be, from birth to grave
