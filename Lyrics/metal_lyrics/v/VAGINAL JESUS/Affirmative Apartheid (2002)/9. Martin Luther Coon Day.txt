Martin Luther King, he didn't do a thing
They should've gave his day to James Earl Ray [2x]

Now I've got a free afternoon
I'm gonna go out and kill a coon
A joke holiday, I'll show no respect
I'm gonna burn a cross on your housing project

Martin Luther King, he didn't do a thing
They should've gave his day to James Earl Ray [2x]
