[Lyrics: Shawn and Donny]

In my sanctum of disease
I feed on your dying screams
Entity of blasphemy
Death will be your final plea
Stainless steel against your skull
Cortex shattered with one blow
Cavity of clotted blood now is where
Your face once was
I know that youâre dead
Yet I canât seem to stop bashing
Your skull
The feeling is so real
The pleasure I feel is unexplainable
Bashed fucking skull [3x]
Your flesh opens, tendons tear
Partaking in the joy, indulging your fear
Skull is split, split at the seams
Blood bath insanity,
I mute your screams
Terrorized, face with no eyes
Depleting fluids, brain on your thighs
Bowels let loose, your body is drained
Shit and blood mixed
Wish your headless remains
Scraping brains from your skull
Lifeless body limp and cold [4x]
Bashed fucking skull [2x]
Black metal mayhem
Ultra brutal part
Bashed fucking skull [2x]
