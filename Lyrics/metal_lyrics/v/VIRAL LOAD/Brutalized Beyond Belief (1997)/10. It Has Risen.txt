[Lyrics: Shawn]

Bodies, lifeless and decayed
Fills the darkness with a stench
That no human can take
Frozen, within a hunk of ice
Waiting for the ozone to
Deplete so it may rise
Eons old it waits
To be reborn unto this world
Its only emotion is hate
The blood of man it craves
Searching for the liquid of its life
Step into its path
Youâll surely die
Thriving on the pleas
To spare your life
Youâre fucking dead
It has risen, to kill [2x]
Terminate the existence of man
Itâs only desire to kill
Populate the world with its kind
Itâs planting the seed of destruction
Exterminate the insects that rule
For they who are caused itâs demise
Regenerate the species again
To rule for the next millennium
It has gained control
Of the land and sea
Man no longer rule
Itâs reign on Earth a dream
Handfuls did survive
The holocaust it brought
Existence underground
Is their punishment
Now man waits, for the time
When heâll rule over the Earth
Once again
Until that time, he must dwell
Among the underworld
Growing strength, with each day
It now feels its day are numbered again
Man shall rise from the Earth
To regain what is his
