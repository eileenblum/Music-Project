[Lyrics: Donny]

The quest for your flesh
Suffrage is at hand
Face down, down on the ground
Brought forth by my mighty sword
Smell of the blood
Gleam of the blade
Impaled your flesh
Physically grotesque
Young one I will have your soul
Virgin in now a whore
Body barely alive
Give and take my body writhes
Hoping that soon you will die
Brought forth by my mighty sword
Smell of the blood
Gleam of the blade
Impaled your flesh
Physically grotesque
Virgin in now a whore
Iâm the one with your life
Suffrage with deviation
All I want is to take anotherâs life
Fucking bloody flesh until
It is dead
Brought forth by my mighty sword
Impaled final attack
Suffer the whore is dead
Grateful to release your hell
Brought forth by my mighty sword
Smell of the blood
Gleam of the blade
Impaled your flesh
Physically grotesque
Young one I will have your soul
Virgin in now a whore
