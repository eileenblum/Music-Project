[Lyrics: Shawn]

Contemplating thoughts of genocide
Formulating ways for manâs demise
Scientific methods will be used
To eradicate this world of filth
Running will not help you to escape
Fighting back will only seat your fate
The sins you have committed you must pay
Forever you will be my fucking slave
Strapped unto the table now you are mine
Smiling with glee as your blood
starts to spill
Relieving frustration with each one I kill
Canât help but look in the eyes of the dead
Visions of carnage are clouding my head
Cleansing the body of sins is what I enjoy
The manifestation of greed
inside man I abhor
Spilling your blood on my walls
will be the cure
My only wish now is to see
my theory enforced
Mesmerized by the blood stained walls [4x]
Slicing through your flesh and bone
Capturing your mortal soul
Begging for your worthless life
Cries of mercy go unheard
Spilling your blood on my walls
Keeps you close to me
Strapped into the battle now you are mine
Smiling with glee as your blood starts to spill
Relieving frustration with each one I kill
Canât help but look in the eyes of the dead
Visions of carnage are clouding my head
Now your blood is staining my walls
