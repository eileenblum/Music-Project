[Lyrics: Donny]

Striping, stripping, stripping
Flesh away from the bone
Iâm laughing intently at you
Youâre suffering and all alone
Prepare for aggression
Live out my fantasy
The terror in your eyes
I slice your fucking flesh
Into tiny chunks
Yet you are sill alive
Cauterize your open wounds
Heart racing gasping breath
You beg and plead for death
You twitching in the corner
My hunger increases now
To taste the gift of life
Blisters, scabs and scars
You hope to die
Blisters, scabs and scars
They canât tell who you are
From blisters, scabs and scars
The blood is flowing freely
Upon the rusted shank
You start to defecate
Convulsions twist the body
Into a tattered form
Your own tongue you have ate
The deeds has ended quickly
Your life has slipped away
The pleasure was all mine
I finally feel at peace
The gore before my eyes
It feeds my twisted fucking mind
Blisters, scabs and scars
You hope to die
Blisters, scabs and scars
They canât tell who you are
From blisters, scabs and scars

Next verse too brutal for lyrics

Stripping, hacking, slicing
Flesh away from the bone
Iâm laughing intently at you
Youâre suffering and all alone

Next verse too brutal for lyrics
