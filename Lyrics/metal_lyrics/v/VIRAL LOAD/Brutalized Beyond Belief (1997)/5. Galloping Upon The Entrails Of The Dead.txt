[Lyrics: Donny]

Venture out to claim what is mine
Hatred drives me to the point of this
Carnage the blade swings
to draw the blood
Terror imposed in the eyes of the dead
Suffrage and pain
Searching out again
Take a look at the sky
Prepare to die
Onward we ride
Now we are galloping
Upon the entrails of the dead [2x]
Dispose of the screaming whore
Who pleads God save us and our souls
Laughing she falls over to the side
Headless no more to terrorize now we ride
Suffrage and pain
Searching out again
Take a look at the sky
Prepare to die
Onward we ride
Now we are galloping
Upon the entrails of the dead [2x]
Wing the blade and now I take your life
Crushing all who step into the light
Burn the dead all that you see is mine
Now onward we ride
Suffrage and pain
Weâre galloping
