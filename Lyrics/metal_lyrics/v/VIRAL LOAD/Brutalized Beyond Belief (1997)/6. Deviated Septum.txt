[Lyrics: Donny]

Force fed raging conviction
Mutilate carnage brought infliction
Pounding blood lost terror
Cross my split second decision
Ignorance brings you pain
Deviated septum
Obliteration of this
Deviated septum
Cartilage is shoved
Deviated septum
Deep into your brain
Deviated septum
Watching intentions are the same
The bound youâve broken in the game
Alone no witnesses to see
Wiped out your face
Smashed in concrete
Brain matter smeared onto the floor
Crevice open split apart at your skull
Cold body lesson learned in life
Deviate your end has made it right
Brain matter everywhere
Cold hearted killer donât care
Crime scene thereâs not a trace
Who smashed in his fucking face
To describe what can be seen
Faceless body busted spleen
Cocks off and up his ass
Severed off with broken glass
Carcass lies amongst the shit
Carnage never seems to quit
Parts are snapped out of place
Fingers are gone from the waste
Ghastly figure set ablaze
Guts entwined a vile maze
The recognize impossible dead
Faceless bashed in skull
Here lies his bashed in skull
Now lifeless and dead
