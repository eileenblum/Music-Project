[Lyrics: Shawn and Donny]

Iâm sitting in the darkness
My death is staring at me
The fucking gun is at my head
Contempt for all the living
The ones who gave me misery
Will all be sorry when Iâm dead
The fucking hypocrites
They laugh behind my back
The shit is flowing out their mouth
Before I take my life
The killings will begin
Sodomized until theyâre fucking dead
Isolation, isolation, isolation, isolate [2x]
The first one did not suspect
The gunshot or the hatchet
That buried deep into his skull
His body twitched and shivered
As I remove his innards
Primal urges of a cannibal
The second was the same
I killed them all this way
Rehearsed and played out like a play
Now I am all alone
To revel in their flesh
Myself will be my next victim
Isolation, isolation, isolation, isolate [2x]
Hatred for myself now grows
Isolated from the world
Acts of torture I perform
Masochism of my flesh
Smell of my blood is intense
Drives me to insanity
Immolation of myself
Death it seems the only way
Isolate myself from the weak
For they cause the disgust I feel
Isolate myself from the lies
The lies that are burnt in my mind
Isolate myself from the fear
The fear of what I do not know
Isolate myself from the world
A world that fills us with greed
Iâm sitting in the darkness
My death is staring at me
The fucking gun is at my head
Contempt for all the living
The ones who gave me misery
Will all be sorry when Iâm dead
The fucking hypocrites
They laugh behind my back
The shit is flowing out their mouth
Before I take my life
The killings will begin
Sodomized until theyâre fucking dead
Isolation, isolation, isolation, isolate [2x]
