[Lyrics: Shawn]

Your innocence
Makes me sick
Violent death
You will get
Flesh is stripped
Head to toe
Your last cries
Excite my soul
I know youâre thinking
That itâs over
The horror Iâve given
Your mind
Yet itâs far from being over
Thereâs still more work
To be done
You see your flesh to me
Is precious
It stimulates my sickened mind
To me your flesh is just a canvas
For my sick thought to
Flow like wine
All I see is flesh before me
Nothing less and nothing more
Just an object of amusement
You worthless fucking whore
Lacerated flesh [2x]
The sculpture takes itâs form
It makes me warm inside
Your flesh is silky smooth
It makes a useful tool
Your outer shell is gone
What was inside is now out
My sculpture now complete
I have your flesh to thank
It seems like such a waste
To burn or bury the dead
When flesh can be reused
To make my sculptures live
