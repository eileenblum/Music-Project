Standing alone in the shadows, waiting again
Beautiful girl so sweet and pure, enjoy your last breath
Knife in hand I begin surgery
Cut her vocals chords so she can't scream
Defecate all over her body
Ejaculate upon my own faces

Cockroaches are your cumrag
Roaches eat the cum and shit upon her precious flesh
More roaches swarm to feast
The more I cum the more the roaches congregate
The cover her body

The stench is overwhelming making me vomit
A stew of bugs and puke
I grab two handfuls of the snack I have prepared
It's gooey and crunchy
Cockroach cumrag
Semen flies
In her eyes
Roach detects
Intercepts
Knife in had I begin surgery
Cut her vocals chords so she can't scream
Defecate all over her body
Ejaculate upon my own faces
Bugs chew through my muck
Made by this fuck
Of this dead whore
She breathes no more more she is free
Can't stand the smell
Stench is of hell
Terrible mess
Must clean up the evidence
Done now I smile
Stare at the pile
Alone I rehearse
Plan out the curse
Disregard will
Again I kill
Roaches will feed
Fulfilling my fucked up needs
Cockroach is your cumrag
