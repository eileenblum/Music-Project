Your broken life
In search of salvation
Your open wound are fed upon by a monstrous creation
His trusting eyes and his words of peace
Contradictory military styled ways to bring the world down
To its knees
Using god as a weapon
Claiming to be his own son
Reclaim his land
Now go and repent
Brainwash your victims to kill
Suck off their will, you drain their will

Father of sickness you breed
Thoughtlessly planting the seed
To form your own godly race
To kill all others in your way
To strike upon with deadly force
The seven seals now takes its course
Follow him to his grave
For you are nothing more than his slaves
His word of god, Twisted obscure
Fiery winged angels, hell to endure
Fire, Fire, consuming flesh
Scorching heat has laid to rest
Try to run your shot in the head
Your blessed savior is the reason your dead

A pungent stench of burning hair as flesh begins to steam
Elders cut the throats of children as they start to scream
Davidans they are as the expel their final breath
Now awaken in the flames for he has brought your death
There is no escaping the pain of your hellish fate

Thriving on your innocence imprisoned at hell's gate
Your flesh is oh so tender vultures swarm to eat
Charbroiled carcasses rest like mounds of meat
Twisted man he is
(Mad man insane)
Fools follow his lead
(Awaken In Flames)
To perish in the flames
(Mad man insane)
Endure his pain
(Awaken In Flames)
