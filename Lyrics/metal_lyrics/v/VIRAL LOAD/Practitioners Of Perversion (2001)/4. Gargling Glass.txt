Burned so deep in my subconscious
Observe me and my psychosis
Masking the pain on the surface I trade
Fearing the creature for which you create
(Gargling Glass)
Rebelling the demons that stir from the past
Self mutilation I'm gargling glass
(Gargling Glass)

Burned deep inside
Tear out my throat with no chance to survive
Painful and slow
Sickens the mind but must feed the soul
Glass shreds mute sound
I'm heaving flesh onto the ground
Must question mental state
Self-mutilation seems irate
Disemboweled through throat with glass
Blood is spewing from my ass
Burned deep inside

Tear out my throat with no chance to survive
Painful and slow
Sickens the mind but must feed the soul
Must question mental state
Self-mutilation seems irate
Disemboweled through throat with glass
Blood is spewing from my ass

On with the pain suffer again forcing
The glass fragments down my throat
On with the pain suffer again I'm free
Death's pleasure it holds me
On with the pain suffer again scarring
My own flesh to soothe the pain

Soothe the pain, experiment
I am the guinea pig
You don't feel you fucking kill
Mutilated thrown away
Troubled for I choose this life that I'm taking
Flesh ripped open peacefully I lie in my fucking waste
This is how I choose to die

Gargling glass
can't inhibit my decision
Gargling on glass
Fearing the sickness reality's gone
Hacking away at self worth
Forcing glass down my esophagus
Self-mutilation is driving the curse
Chocking on blood and pieces of meat
Hacking away at my flesh
No blood to my brain
I fall to the floor
Convulsing and twitching
I now greet my death
There is no pain
Scarring my brain
Hemorrhaging eye
Maggots and flies
Flesh in a heap
Vocal chords seep
Blood mixed with bile
Stench is so vile

Soothe the pain, experiment
I am the guinea pig
You don't feel you fucking kill
Mutilated thrown away
Troubled for I choose this life that I'm taking
Flesh ripped open peacefully I lie in my fucking waste
This is how I choose to die

Gargling glass
Suicidal voices calling form beyond
Death has swept across my ears with the sweetest song
On my grave their lies a wreath
Six feet under I lie beneath
Suffer with the pain
Reaching out again
A prisoner in my own hell
Fear engulfs my being
The horrors I am seeing cannot be described
