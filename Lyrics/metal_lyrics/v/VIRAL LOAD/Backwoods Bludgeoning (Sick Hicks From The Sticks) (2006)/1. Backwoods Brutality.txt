Down In the southeast Texas sticks lies and corrugated trash heap
An economic wasteland inbreeding has run-rampant
Criminally insane DNA disease infested, innocence molested plagues the population
It's rumoured rotting cadavers litter the woods
Wholesale slaughter exclusively bound and gagged
Finally after days of intense torture murdered so brutally
A cesspool of human remains disembodied corpses exhumed
The vermin of society hunt for flesh
Homo sapiens a backwoods delicacy
Dismemberment begins without even the basic human emotion compassion is ignored
You pleas for mercy head by no one a cesspool of human remains
Backwoods brutality
