Through knee deep snow
and howling northern wind
Through blinding darkness
and horizon of ice
Through hundred corpses
and haunting cries
Through battlefield realm
and rivers of blood

Battle will be won
In this night we stand strong

Through fields of sorrow
and the smell of death
Through days of battle
and endless slaughter
Through nights of pain
and counting corpses
Through battlefield realm
and rivers of blood

Battle will be won
In this night we stand strong

In this night
I stride forth
longing for another time
