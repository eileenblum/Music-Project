Take me up to higher ground
and let me feel the cold wind blow
above the demonic mountainside
beholding creations of ice
The screams echoes eternally
As the snow keep falling down
Through this freezing night
I hear the ravens call

I want to see these mountains
These mountains that I know
Where demons and ravens fly
circling the tall mountainside
the winterstorm is growing stronger
as I glance towards the sky
once again the memories
streams through my elder veins
