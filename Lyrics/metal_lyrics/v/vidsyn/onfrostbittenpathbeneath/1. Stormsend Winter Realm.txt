Stormsend winter realm
crystallized before me
strong and everlasting
glance of Nordic depths

Far into the cold night
a darker path to follow
I walk steadily towards
the elder mountains

Behold frostbitten glaciers
as I walk eternally
cold naked winds
grimly haunting me

Feel the cold
in every movement
as I sound asleep
for the last time

Light fades away
the blizzard blinds me
forever captured
in the stormsend winter realm
