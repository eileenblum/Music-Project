Behold the coming of a storm - Rising from below
Where demons dwell - In the undead darkness
The evil awaits - To unleash its hordes
The everlasting night is at hand

Feel the cold - In every breath
The sight is nearer - By the blizzard
Black ravens fly - Crying mournfully
The everlasting winter - Is at hand

Evil Rises - Darkness Falls
Freezing Night - Raven Calls

Through a journey - In the horizon beyond
I slowly drown - In burning darkness
Fall to one knee - I can no longer see
The everlasting night - Is at hand

Feel the cold - In every breath
The sight is nearer - By the blizzard
Black ravens fly - Crying mournfully
The everlasting winter - Is at hand

Evil Rises - Darkness Falls
Freezing Night - Raven Calls
