Upon the mountainside I stand
feeling the cold northern wind
blowing over the horizon
of dead and frozen ground

Before the darkness falls
I gaze over the frostbitten chasm
and the grimmest glaciers
beholding the mountains of ice

The coldest nights are at hand
biting winds are blowing harder
off the grimmest glaciers
leaving me freezing in the heart

On frostbitten path beneath I walk
blinded by the snowfall
I stride forth in the wintercold
stronger than ever before
