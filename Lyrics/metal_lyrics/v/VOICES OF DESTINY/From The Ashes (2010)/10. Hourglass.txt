Time never stands still
The world keeps turning
It won't see you had been stumbling
And are missing the moments you'd love

Run, run, run, try to fly and reach the star
You have always been waiting for
This moment will not last forever
It's your time
Kill the doubt ruling your heart
No hesitating, not anymore
The sand is streaming through your hands
And there is nothing to stop its fall

Don't you wake up too late
Seize the day
Every grain you had been given
Stands for thousands of hours of dreams

Then something smashed your hourglass
Smashed your life to smithereens
And threw all the sand away
You try to save your destiny
Try to catch your past's remains
You're running out of time

Run, run, run, try to fly and reach the star
You have always been waiting for
This moment will not last forever
It's your time
Kill the doubt ruling your heart
No hesitating, not anymore
The sand is streaming through your hands
And there is nothing to stop its fall
