Save me from falling

Hey, now it's all the same again
What I wanted to keep has gone astray
And I'm running like I'm insane
Just to get another chance to blow my mind

You are my ray of hope
Enlight the dark I cannot cope
Save me from falling and trust me
YOu're the only one

I have never gone this far
Should I take
another step and risk it all
Did you recognize those stars
One will be my own if I would dare to reach

You are my ray of hope
Enlight the dark I cannot cope
Save me from falling and trust me
YOu're the only one

Some day my tries will be rewarded
You will see - I WILL BE RISING
Sometimes when wounds have turned to scars
See my mind - STRONGER THAN ALL

You are my ray of hope
Enlight the dark I cannot cope
Save me from falling and trust me
YOu're the only one
