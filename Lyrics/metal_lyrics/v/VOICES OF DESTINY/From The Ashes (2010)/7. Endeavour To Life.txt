I'm always staring straight ahead
Don't want to see these bloody red eyes
Glowing in the dark
Lying in wait along my path
They are raring to see me fall
Pull me down and tear it all
I feel like I was pushed outside into the storm to
NEVER COME BACK

I'm trying on to satisfy all their claims
Till I spread my wings and fly
Flee these eyes and find a way to go on

I can hardly keep it all alive
I'm on my knees but they won't give me a break
Whips are calling from behing
I'm trying my best
SO LEAVE ME ALONE
WHY WON'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

I'm trying on to satisfy all their claims
Till I spread my wings and fly
Flee these eyes and find a way to go on
You see me up there?
Sitting on a cloud with my legs hanging free
Sun's shining just for this moment

I'm trying on to satisfy all their claims
Till I spread my wings and fly
Flee these eyes and find a way to go on
