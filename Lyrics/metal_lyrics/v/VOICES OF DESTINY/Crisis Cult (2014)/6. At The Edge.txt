Don't open your eyes
The sun's too bright
And we are not there yet
Just go back to sleep
You've been asleep
Where and when am I?
Why do I feel so tired?
Can hardly open my weary eyes
Seems I have gone so far from home

My ship has begun to sink
And you're tried to the mast
Dark waves, they descend on me
This breath be your last
The courses is set for the edge of this world
Soon I'll reach the edge of this world

It looks so strange
Yet I coudl swear, I have seen this place before
My memories, they tell of life and joy but none of it is anymore
With every breath the world that knew falls apart
No turning back
Just let your colors fade
Embrace the darkened sky

My ship has begun to sink
And you're tried to the mast
Dark waves, they descend on me
This breath be your last
The courses is set for the edge of this world
Soon I'll reach the edge of this world

Help me
Drowning
I cannot breathe
This is your work
My curse
Can't see; why me?
What did I do?
I'm a solemn sacrifice
How can't you see?
No, still you won't see what you have done to me
