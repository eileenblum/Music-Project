It is said that once there was a guardian force
A tale of 21 heroes
It foretold that tey'd return in times of need
Yet this hope was in vain

Shut it!
Pray is all you can
I've had enough of words
We must become the heroes

No more turning a blind eye to the weak
I want to hear you say; we go all out!
If not now then when to change?
We're the heroes

All this time we're depending on a fairytale
It's no good
Now the enemy is at our gate
And we're felt all alone

Shut it!
Complain is all you can
Better brace yourselves
We will become the heroes

No more turning a blind eye to the weak
I want to hear you say; we go all out!
If not now then when to change?
We're the heroes

Yet so unsure
Dive into my mind see me fall
I dive into my mind see me falter
Plase make this go

Shut it!
Pray is all you can
I've had enough of your words
Hail the hero

No more turning a blind eye to the weak
I want to hear you say; we go all out!
If not now then when to change?
We're the heroes
Yes, we go all out!
If not now then when to change?
We're the heroes!
