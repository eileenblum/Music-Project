Hold up!
We were asked to still go staright
Always go straight
Silent
What could we do but to proceed?
We proceed

Now you regret the power you surrendered
Yet all this time thei care felt so tender

Force back
Choke on your tears as you lie; you're alright
Wear black 
Get your heart's color on the outside for everyone to see

You're better off not following me into the darkest corners of my mind
There's a beast I use to keep shut away
And it stirs when you fail me

Bow down!
Here comes the ruler of your life taking your pride
Had enough?
Then turn your back forge your own thoughts
Taking control

You're better off not following me into the darkest corners of my mind
There's a beast I use to keep shut away
And it stirs when you fail me

You made us again tear at our chains
But don't panic; we are under control

Another lesson learned. to trust no one but yourself
Will never trust again your words
The outcome of this story, it lies in our hands
It lies in our sore hands

You're better off not following me into the darkest corners of my mind
There's a beast I use to keep shut away
And it stirs when you fail me
There's a beast inside and it lies in wait
Brace yourself as it breaks free

Time to panic
We are losing control
