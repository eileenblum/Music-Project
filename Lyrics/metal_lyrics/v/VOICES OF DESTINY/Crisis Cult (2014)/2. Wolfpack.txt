Animalistic
Forceful
Instinct in purity
The fitteste survive as they feast on the weak in frenzy
Our ramblings made us deaf to their howl
Only the hypocrites dare to ask; who set them free?

Cannibalistic
Brutal
Beyond humanity
They share the same blood but hate brings it to the boil inside their veins
With our head held high, we're blind to their betrayal
Pass the buck but god knows that we set them free

Mother
Under this fading sun
We turn your children into monsters
This world has turned so numb
We deny the effect of the cause

Our ramblings made us deaf to them
More
Give us more
Just feed us to ourselves

The devil may care in the age of sustainability
For we only learn through catastrophes and casualties

Mother
Under this fading sun
We turn your children into monsters
This world has turned so numb
We deny the effect of the cause
