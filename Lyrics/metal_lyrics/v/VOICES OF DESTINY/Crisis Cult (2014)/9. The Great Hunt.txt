Now the days is here
Can you see the raging crowd?
Still it grows 
Too long we were controlled
So they thought they got away?
It's not over yet
We're coming after them

You don't understand that is just to take it all back
What was stolen from us
And we take our time for time lost its weight
We take down the ones who took her away
Try to restrain the fire in our hearts and you will be burned with our enemies along
'Cause only their ends will end our flame
We take down the ones who took her away
You don't understand

Pain is all I fee
Just make it go away
I have tried anything but revenge of which thet say is a marvel
We crush their bones and bury them at her feet
With all my heart I pray that he knows
With all my heart I pray you burn in hell!

When your howl falls silent we will know peace of mind
When our hate yields to voidness we realize

You don't understand that it is just to take it all back what was stolen from us
And we tale our time for time lost it weight
We take down the ones who took her away
Try to restrain the fire in our hearts and you will be burned with our enemies along
'Cause only their ends will end our flame
We take down the ones who took her away

Please give us peace of mind
We don't fear the void
We must crush
