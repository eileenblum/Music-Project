It is her night
She was chosen to shine as the star of the show called "We change your life"
And she would change beyond recognition
They turned her upside down and her insides out
Beware the darkness
The wolves always hunt in a pack
Now you're the target
You're the easy prey

Be still my dear
Believe
Your perfume reveals you
There's no way they smell you fear
Playing dead will not save you

Forlon
She has them breathing down her neck
Not supposed to outrun her fate
This course was set for her long ago
So far
And you can't even bear to look
While you're dying to see what's next
Who's next to take her place
Make yourself a sheep and welcome the wolves

She'll be terrified to see; this is the end of it
This is the end of hide and seek
I'm for real; they have her outnumbered in a dead-end
God! Please, make them stop

The world holds its breath
Vile smiles reveal their fangs
Is this her final stand?
She's with her back to the wall
Spare her from harm
Is this her final stand?
She's with her back to the wall
Leaave her alone

Forlon
She has them breathing down her neck
Not supposed to outrun her fate
This course was set for her long ago
So far
And you can't even bear to look
While you're dying to see what's next
Who's next to take her place
Make yourself a sheep and welcome the wolves

This was her final stand with her back to the wall
