There is this urge to burn it down
To make you feel the pain I felt
Your grinning faces, they will freeze
At the sight of the awful truth
The truth you've been blackening for years
You have blackened the truth

Did you never crave to see what I have fallen for?
Did you never wonder why I kept returning?
And again you claim to be superior
The higher you fly
The deeper you fall to the ground

It's the disgusting smell of your rotten minds
That tells me I'm the only one alive
This is not about pride but necessity
I necessarily tear up your reality
You are nothing
Worth nothing
So useless
Just dead flesh

Did you never crave to see what I have fallen for?
Did you never wonder why I kept returning?
And again you claim to be superior
The higher you fly
The deeper you fall to the ground

This is my final try to separate myself from you all
No more silence
No more giving way

Did you never crave to see what I have fallen for?
Did you never wonder why I kept returning?
And again you claim to be superior
The higher you fly
The deeper you fall to the ground
