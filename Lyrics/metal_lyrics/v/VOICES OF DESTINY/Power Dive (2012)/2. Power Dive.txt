I'm losing ground
No end in sight

Sympathetic angels pass me by
Falling back into reality again
Your promises used to keep me flying blind so high
Cound the seconds until I hit the ground

They told me that it would be better now
But nothing has changed
Upon my soul, this should be better now
But it's all in vain

Can't trust my world
I'm losing ground
Full speed ahead
No end in

I challenge you for a race to hell
Confess the recklessness within
My motivation, a clear objective
The first to die will be honored for life

Can't trust my world
I'm losing ground
Full speed ahead
No end in sight

Can't trust my world
I'm losing ground
For hope has died
In my power dive
