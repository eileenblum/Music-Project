It's over once again
The blackness closing in
You're leaving alone
They say you must let go
But we accept no more
You're leaving us alone

We deny this nightmare
Enough of all the grief
That's enough!

We will fight to retrieve the lights
That used to guide our way through life
This one is dedicated to all the broken ones
Who lost it and miss it and got no chance to get it back

There is no vengeance to take
No one takes the blame
It's buried with you
No more eyes cried out
Dried out by our tears
We're deadened, overwhelmed
Overwhelmed by death

We deny this nightmare
Enough of all this
No, don't you die
I said, don't you die!

From the end of this day
It is us who have to cope
With the memory of your wailing eyes

We will fight to retrieve the lights
That used to guide our way through life
This one is dedicated to all the broken ones
Who lost it and miss it and got no chance to get it back
