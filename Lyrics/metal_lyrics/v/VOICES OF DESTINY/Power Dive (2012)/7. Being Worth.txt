They say you're uncertain
They say that you're not worth a try
But I say I'm believing in you and me
Their words take us higher
Their doubts make us reach for the sky
If only you'd dare to trust in me and my tries

Prove me a liar but you can hardly deny
The mellow tone in the illusion that I uphold
This time of waiting in vain
This time is wasting away
Take a deep breath
And give significance to it

Don't look at me like this
Retract your distant smile
I could be so much more for you
You leave me here in chains
And watch our lifeline fail
This is not everything
But it is all we have
And now you tear it to pieces
Play the victim role
But I can not relent
Not ever again

So far, we've gone almost all the way
So close we were on that day
I long to give peace to you but you won't ever let me
For you doubt that I was worth your love

It counts nothing to fall in love today
It's just worthless to tell the truth these days
Everyone is paralyzed by fear
And no one ever dares to take a step out

Don't look at me like this
Retract your distant smile
I could be so much more for you
You leave me here in chains
And watch our lifeline fail
This is not everything
But it is all we have
And now you tear it to pieces
Play the victim role
But I can not relent
Not ever again
