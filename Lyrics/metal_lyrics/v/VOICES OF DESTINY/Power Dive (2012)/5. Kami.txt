Don't dare to step out of line
I am your god
You will crawl around my feet
I'll be the upper one

Obey the rules of life
But keep in mind that
Some rules and some bones are meant to be broken

Assassinate them
The end justifies the means
This be the day that I prophesy:
You will face relentless changes

This time you've gone too far and crossed the line
We will burn your corrupt world to start again

Suffer in hell
'Cause we are the ones
To judge your actions
And this time you've gone too far

This time you've gone too far and crossed the line
We will burn your corrupt world to start again
These eyes will not forget your bloody hands
We will raze all you ever owned for our revenge

This is the end of all your felonies
This is the end of all murders
This is the end of all the agony
This will end decades of torture

This time you've gone too far and crossed the line
We will burn your corrupt world to start again
These eyes will not forget your bloody hands
We will raze all you ever owned for our revenge
This time we won't forget
We sentence you to death

This is the end of all the agony
This will end decades of torture
This is the end of my sanity
This is justice! I am justice!
You're fucking dead

Evil must be eliminated
