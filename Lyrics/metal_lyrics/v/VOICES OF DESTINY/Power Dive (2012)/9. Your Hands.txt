Lay your hands on me to finally infect my heart
Implant the image
I will not resist this soothing lie
You seek a savior's sense
Be content with a martyr, me

So if you leave me
Don't think that I'll be found
Just 'cause you can't see since you won't turn around
And if you leave me
Don't think my pain's erased
Just 'cause you are too far from me to hear my screams

Without remorse you tied me to the rack
Sacrificed for your own good
Your experiments put feelings on a tensile test
I volunteered without awareness of the consequence
Pain

So if you leave me
Don't think that I'll be found
Just 'cause you can't see since you won't turn around
And if you leave me
Don't think my pain's erased
Just 'cause you are too far from me to hear my screams

They echo in the air around this hill
The hill I struggled up to free my screams
They echo in the air around this hill
The hill I struggled up

Your hands, they burn my skin
My words erase your sins
Your hands, they burn my skin
But still my words may erase your sins

So if you leave me
Don't think that I'll be found
Just 'cause you can't see since you won't turn around
And if you leave me
Don't think my pain's erased
Just 'cause you are too far from me to hear my screams
They echo in the air
My screams
Your hands, they burn
