The point of view has changed
Our logical thinking has been deranged
The snow seems white through our eyes
We questioned the gods as they rejected our prayers
Why do we fall down to the start of it all?

Snow turns to red
We will never ever feel the rain again
Snow turns to red
There will never ever be that faith again

Betrayed by the blooed we breed
We're overrun by our own creations
Reckless just like our ideas
Has nobody read the signs?
Has nobody noticed the prophets of doom?
We will come to an end

Crawling through the cold white
Painting the world a crimson side
Evolution hit us hard
System failure!
Please restart

Snow turns to red
We will never ever feel the rain again
Snow turns to red
There will never ever be that faith again

Watching the dusk from our throne above heaven
Feeling the earthquakes destructing our monument
