The puzzle's incomplete and you are staring at the gaps
Wounds you received from all the endless fights
for your heart
Surrounded by traitors you don't stand a chance
But listen, I'm a friend among the enemies

Let me make you feel untouchable
I can make you feel invincible
All beyond my reach
The constancy in your resistance is so self-defeating
This will make you feel untouchable

No cure to find in your solitary ways
Lost in denial
Just give in to my hands, I swear they won't hurt
They take you away from this pain
This pain won't hurt
Just believe what I promise

Let me make you feel untouchable
I can make you feel invincible
All beyond my reach
The constancy in your resistance is so self-defeating
This will make you feel untouchable

I can make you feel invincible
This will make you feel untouchable
