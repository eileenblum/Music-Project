A force from deep within
Keeps him awake all night
As long as he's alive
He will carry on

Remembering the autumn days
The ash trees and their fallen leaves
He is ready to defeat

Yearning he stares at the darkened sky
Always pushed by her call

Help me, help me
Come shelter me, my dear
I am nothing but a lonely soul
Lift me, lift me
Come fly away with me
To a place we're all longing for

A hell made from gods
Rages aroung him
It tries to keep him far
But he wants to defy
Everyone who dares
To stand in his way

Heading for a place where gods die
Where everything will come to an end

Helpless she stares at the darkened sky
And hopes for her saviour to come

Help me, help me
Come shelter me, my dear
I am nothing but a lonely soul
Lift me, lift me
Come fly away with me
To a place we're all longing for
