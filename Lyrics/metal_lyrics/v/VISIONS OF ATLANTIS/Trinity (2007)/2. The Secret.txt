I seek the earth, these timeless tranquil waves
That have since turned to dust, an endless phase.
I carry with me a heave heart of stone,
That belongs deep inside the place for which I mourn.

Beyond love, beyond lust, beyond art
This constant yearning beats inside,
More than my own craving heart.

This muse of passion stealing my restless soul,
senses intoxicated takes its toll,
Heaven meets Earth with dusk's dark kiss,
Taste my love within this chalice.
It torments the inner artist.

Devoted reverence for the most beautiful dream,
Becomes reality out of the faintest gleam.
Worlds come closer with the touch of your fire,
Winding into towers of wordless choirs.

Beyond love, beyond lust, beyond art
This constant yearning beats inside,
More than my own craving heart.

This muse of passion stealing my restless soul,
senses intoxicated takes its toll,
Heaven meets Earth with dusk's dark kiss,
Taste my love within this chalice.
It torments the inner artist.

Beyond love, far above
Beyond art, you're the blood of my heart.

Heaven meets Earth with dusk's dark kiss,
Taste my love within this chalice.
It torments the inner artist.

It torments the inner artist.
