Words in my head infest my mind
Things you said, but not defined.
Every moment on the run
Up a second, down next one.
Your far away reality
Dry your tears don't blame it on me.

Inside me there's nothing left for you.
Don't say it's raining
When there's no cloud in the sky.
Don't you see sun reflecting in my eyes?

No more pain, no disguise,
Drive away the serpents in my paradise.
Never care of what you rake,
Always praying for your sake.
See just what you want to see,
Dry your tears don't blame it on me.

Inside me there's nothing left for you.
Don't say it's raining
When there's no cloud in the sky.
Don't you see in my eyes?
Don't say it's raining
When there's no cloud in the sky.
Don't you see sun reflecting in my eyes?

When you're away light breaks up in me,
To end the torment, which you caused, life dawns in me,
Don't waste your tears, don't follow me.

Every moment on the run
Up a second, down next one.
Your far away reality
Dry your tears...

Don't say it's raining
When there's no cloud in the sky.
Don't you see in my eyes?
Don't say it's raining
When there's no cloud in the sky.
Don't you see sun reflecting in my eyes?
