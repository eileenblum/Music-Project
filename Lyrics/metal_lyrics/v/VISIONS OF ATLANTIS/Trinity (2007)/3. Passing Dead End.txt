Trying to tell you what I can't explain,
It's a place, an emotion, a lie.
The loss in your eyes slowly drives me insane,
So upon you I have to rely.

I show you truth as it's meant to be,
Falling to the bottomless, winding sea.

Nothing's as bright as the light
At the end of reality,
Passing dead end.
Feel the absorption of light,
Unlocked with the darkest key,
Still I don't know,
What lies beyond my dream.

I've never seen anything shine so bright,
Never been to that place before.
There is no time and no space left inside,
What I fear is what I do adore.

Now I am what I failed to see
Flying through the bottomless white and see.

Nothing's as bright as the light
At the end of reality,
Passing dead end.
Feel the absorption of light,
Unlocked with the darkest key,
Still I don't know...

Nothing's as bright as the light
At the end of reality,
Passing dead end.
Feel the absorption of light,
Unlocked with the darkest key,
Still I don't know...
