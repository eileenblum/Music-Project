I know not the words to make you stay,
Yet they are engraved on your face.
This secret language, I cannot speak,
Only whisper on the breeze.

My breath, these tears, my cries, all curled up inside.
Haunting apparitions that are hidden to the dark light of day.

Our destiny shall arrive, someday Angel,
I will come to you.
Our fates shall coincide, one day, dear child,
I will come for you.

Cruel means took you far away from here,
Yet your ghost has inspired me.

I shall walk in shadows under the sun,
Awaiting your faithful call.

My breath, these tears, my cries, all caught up inside.
Celestial apparitions that are shaded in the dark light of day.

Our destiny shall arrive, someday Angel,
I will come to you.
Our fates shall coincide, one day, dear child,
I will come for you.

What once was lost is now found deep inside of your soul
Cry out for me and I will return to you.

Our destiny shall arrive, someday Angel,
I will come to you.
Our fates shall coincide, one day, dear child,
I will come for you.

I return to you...
