I got used to the void inside me,
Abused by life I'll fight the emotions used
To tear me down, and lose my ground,
I call for something, someone else,
Something somehow burst my spell.
Crests of waves shall carry me
Far beyond my mind to see.

Not yet to fail,
Try to prevail,

Flow this desert.
Everything grows underneath my feet.
Wash away the dust that lies beneath.

Under full sail to the light,
Straight horizon, out of sight.
Wash ashore, what I will leave behind,
Things I buried in my mind.

Can't remember when or why I left,
The desert wipes away my steps,
On those dreary, dusty paths; my trial.
I'm freezing in the night,
Expecting morning light
To sear again while waiting for the shiver
Wash me away,
And now I'm drifting astray,
But my way is my destination.

Not yet to fail,
Try to prevail,

Flow this desert.
Everything grows underneath my feet.
Wash away the dust that lies beneath.

Under full sail to the light,
Straight horizon, out of sight.
Wash ashore, what I will leave behind,
Things I buried in my mind.

Drifting astray, but my way is my destination
Illuminate, horizons gate, my path turns red.
