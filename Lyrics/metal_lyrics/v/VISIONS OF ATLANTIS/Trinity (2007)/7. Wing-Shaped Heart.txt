Glimmer in the night relight the emptiness
Too bright to hide my inner mess.
I take what I deserve,
I have nothing more to lose.
This is my rebirth I search for you.

My heart is pulsating like it never was before.
I breath in so deeply... Arouse the wick in me.

Leave my crowded chest, soar up into the air.
Never come to rest until you find the one who cares.
Wing-shaped heart, awake wherever you may sleep,
Hidden in my dreams, lose my tongue and let me scream.

Roar out my lungs and my soul
I'm back to life and I
Will never fall again
I keep my head up high

I take what I deserve,
I have nothing more to lose.
This is my rebirth I search for you.

My heart is pulsating like it never was before.
I breath in so deeply... Arouse the wick in me.

Leave my crowded chest, soar up into the air.
Never come to rest until you find the one who cares.
Wing-shaped heart, awake wherever you may sleep,
Hidden in my dreams, lose my tongue and let me scream.

Out of my chest into the air,
No time to rest, I am aware
Of what to do and how to take
An endless ride without a break.

Leave my crowded chest, soar up into the air.
Never come to rest until you find the one who cares.
Leave my crowded chest, soar up into the air.
Never come to rest until you find the one who cares.
Wing-shaped heart, awake wherever you may sleep,
Hidden in my dreams, lose my tongue and let me scream.
