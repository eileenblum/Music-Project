Don't confine what is mine, do you hear me?
Never break what I take or you'll feel me.
I'll come for you tonight when your eyes are shut.
The last ride on the wings of your dreams.
I'll clip them on your flight,
And you'll drown in blackness not able to fight.

Feeble screams faint with fear,
Evil beings time to sear.

Look through my eyes, what do you see?
A heart that dies, a soul is free.
That's the answer to my plea,
You'll pay for what you've done to me.

Don't burn what I built, flames awash in smoke,
My feelings once enchained by your embrace.
Never mess what I cleaned.
You're always poisoning my mind,
My memories unrevealed.

Feeble screams faint with fear,
Evil beings time to sear.

Look through my eyes, what do you see?
A heart that dies, a soul is free.
That's the answer to my plea,
You'll pay for what you've done to me.

Ties lie broken since I died for you.
Ties lie broken now die for me too.
Forgotten, Forsaken, Awoken,
Dissipated, raging mind.
I can't ease the first for freedom from this answer,
My world is full of disbelief and pain.

Feeble screams faint with fear,
Evil beings time to sear.

Look through my eyes, what do you see?
A heart that dies, a soul is free.
That's the answer to my plea,
You'll pay for what you've done to me.
