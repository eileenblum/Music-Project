Ancient stories of a mystic landscape
On the surface of the ocean's pride
The legend lives
Fog surrounded - in the misty moonlight
Mighty waves are pounding at it's coast
Like thunderbolts

Lightning strikes are brightening up the nights
There the sky
Dropped by ocean's endless might
Drowned in the sea

Destiny, ground of the sea
A land in my fantasy
Still - I can feel
Time will reveal - Lemuia

Howling whirlwinds roaring through the dark skies
Raging earthquakes shake it's mighty ground
A nature's blast

Magic visions of a perfect land
So glorious
Burning deep inside my mind
Seen in my dreams
Hope and peace - there is no death, no war
No sensless pain
Take me to my sanctuary
Lemuria

Destiny, ground of the sea
A land in my fantasy
Still - I can feel
Time will reveal - Lemuria
