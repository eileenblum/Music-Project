Imagine a heaven
where everyone is his own king
So fragile, a vision
To dance like the leaves in the wind

Leave stipulate paths behind
to march on my own
Salvation so easy to find
Built by my thoughts
Born in my mind

Oh land of power and grace
my sanctuary
Instead of heaven is a place
It's the realm of my dreams
a world forever to be
The realm of Fantasy

Imagine a planet
created by your own hands
so lovely, so silent
a kingdom of mighty and strength
