Barrier of glass, filled with my tears
Empty space, just no one to hear
Walk alone, I canât get clear
Of those few seconds

Wilted heart, shattered with pain
Spring will never lead me astray
No oneâs able to fan my flame
Condemn myself

If I had just been able to say Iâm sorry
Donât go away, live by my side
Because without you life is grey
And even sun wonât light my day

But now it is too late
All those lines are delayed
Youâll never cross this street again
Youâre out of sight

In my dreams I see your face
Every moment seems like whole days
I canât clean up my disgrace
And those few seconds

If I had just been able, to say turn round
Donât go, please stay, stay with me my dear

If I had just been able to say Iâm sorry
Donât go away, live by my side
Because without you life is grey
And even sun wonât light my day

But now it is too late
All those lines are delayed
Youâll never cross this street again
Youâre out of sight
I will ever be the one to blame
Last shut of your eyes.

Ferries guide you
Guide you all along
Ferries guide you away on silver waves

Crying heaven turns in seas of tears
Ferries guide you
Guide you out of sight
