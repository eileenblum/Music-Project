have you forgotten your promise that night
Follow your fate into the light

The moments before you went away
I still remember your laughter
My eyes open wide shocked
of what i wasnât able to avoid
All the gone they wait for me
They wait on distant shores
Death`s the gate and Iâm the key
With cravingâs driving force

All the gone they`re calling me
They call from distant shores
I leave without remorse

Pass all these days pass all my longing
I draw the line.
To end what should have been done so long ago.
My fading memories force me to go
Where my feelings can resist

Iâm on my way
On my way to you
I canât wait to
Have you all around

Iâm on my way
On my way to you
What was torn
Is now rebound
