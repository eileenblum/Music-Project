World is cold beyond horizon,
nothing told between us now and then.
Where am I now? Your voice so far away
Can I say how? No colours, just grey.
All around me the fog blears my eyes,
And my heart too...a neverending night.

Oh I`m screaming your name again and again,
Am I dreaming? The same again and again?

Where is my hope? Abandoned like my life...
Remember a dark rope and a sharp-edged knife?

Oh IÂ´m screaming your name again and again,
am I dreaming? The same again and again?
