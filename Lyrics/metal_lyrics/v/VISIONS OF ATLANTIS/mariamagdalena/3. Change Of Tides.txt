You canât see the part of me
The secret part i hide from you
You canât feel what burnes in me
My deep desires canât come through
Through the maze of my mind
Is no guiding light that shines for you
You canât see the part of me
The secret part i hide from you

I canât stand this powerlessness
It is like hide and seek for me
nothing more than living tissue
Wrapped over stone

Where is the light
that used to shine down on me
Where is the sight
I once relied on to be guided
and lead through the unknown
of this landscape
of delusion Illusion
of this valley of doom and
confusion
this map inside my head

Iâm the escapist
Estranged from a world of lies
Iâm encaged and enclosed
In my emptiness
Iâm the escapist
Bricked in my walls
Donât try to save me
Your screams donât reach me anymore

How can you do this to me
I canât face you without feeling guilty
Why donât you move why donât you just stand up
and tell me that everythingâs alright that you are by my side
I wanât you to remember

Why donât you just give it up
Cause there are many many ways
For you to get it started
So much beauty is lying waste
If you donât find your way back
(Back) to your ordinary life
Because thereâs never been a lack
of passion in you
