All those precious moments, lost in space and time
For the only reason, she is not of my kind
Everything seems so small, when I hold her close
Everything great is mine, even sunrise
Never to let me go, for another
Never to leave me blind
As the day is fading, and I rest beyond the shores
Sick of life, yet living

Brought to sleep by tidal force
Whatever it will take to bring her body close
Whatever it will need, no tomorrow
Anywhere I go, this is not the end
But a world to leave

Live this time again, before the dawn will end your sorrow
And make love again, a dream of love, pretending hope
You could be everything for me, my friend, and then
We will be

Before the sands of time can wipe away your tears, come follow me
Into deeper seas, where light is spent, for your healing
We will be everything and then, my friend, you know the meaning
Love will be
