Freedom for all was the vision he had
Since the day he became the ruler there
And dark times did pass in this moment of light
For his reign brought the end of all the wrath

And he does not want anyone to be alone
Or feel like a lesser creature there
But a witches of the waves did take someone away
Who was far too beloved to get lost...

"Find him, save him, tell him, show him
Make him feel that he is not alone...
For my daughter wants to love him
And to give his heart a home!"

"Through the sea he will hunt, through the ocean ride
For it's him she will blame, if he can't save his life...
He can't stop till he wins, for the oath of the king
Is the heart of the sea, hunting hard, hunting free"
