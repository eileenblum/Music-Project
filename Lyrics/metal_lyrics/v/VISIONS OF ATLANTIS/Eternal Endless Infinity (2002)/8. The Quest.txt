A misty morning, I'm awake
The storm has settled, past's the rage
The fever of the wind is gone
The (first) beams of sunlight soon will come

I love the flood, I love the tide
The spinning hurricane's alright
No need to mention the sea-lore
I own the wisdom of...

The sea I know, my bride and my disguise
The answer to all my questions

I'm a creature of the sea
Where I find everything I need
Of every star I know the name
The benefits of my bright fame

Whatever I've on mind will come
By day the moon, by nights the sun
As long as I will have a ship
I can and will sail 'cross

The sea I know, my bride and my disguise
The sequel of reality

From the stars above, she has come to sail the world
By her fate enforced to rule
In her veins the blood is of water and of salt
In her eyes the white is clouds

The finest wisdom I received
From deepest pits and my beliefs
In mystic spirit lies my kind
A world beyond control...

No need for reason in my mind
In lasting faith I do define
My world is filled with finest art
That nature made so kindly...
