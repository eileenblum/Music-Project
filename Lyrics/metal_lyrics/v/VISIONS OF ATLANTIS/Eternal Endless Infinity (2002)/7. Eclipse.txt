"I still can feel your heartbeat
And what did you expect?
Anguish by loves or lusts relics?
The warmth of thy desire
Felt so cold, left thee to shame
A waste of all the time you spent to breathe?"

In between debris you'll leave me
Broken hearted, cold as stone
My world, you will be trading it for free

And I can see the morning rise
When you will see another dawn
The ashes of the sweet moments these nights

"How can you live with this concept?"
How could I live without my wrath?
"With deepest sorrow, dark as death..."
