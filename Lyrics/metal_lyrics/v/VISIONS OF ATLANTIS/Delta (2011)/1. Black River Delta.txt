I spread false newsNever on the way to my perfectionI won't leave this world alone Why do I accelerate?Why do I believe in lies that I have used before? So trust in what I gave to youFollow me and I will follow you Everything's different since I was aliveMy tainted soul is now washed cleanNo need to cryBlack river delta will consign me to the sea Riding with strong current into our fatePassengers unable to navigate I watch the moon guiding my remainsTiding awayNothing to regretI am long since deadLet the ocean be my permanent siteMy bed for eternity Why did I take this divergencyTiding me into the wrong directionWhy am I still caught in this earthly meWhile the water gets gluey and thick I am now a part of conscienceGreater than anything I knew before Everything's different since I was aliveMy tainted soul is now washed cleanNo need to cryBlack river delta will consign me to the sea
