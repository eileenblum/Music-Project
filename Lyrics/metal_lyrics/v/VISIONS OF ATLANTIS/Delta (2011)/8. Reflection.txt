Like waiting for a dawn of...An inner confidence, like ignoranceDon't miss the chance tonightAnd when occlusion's drawn up...All the lights won't stopTo put you on the display of this shop The time after rising...From the ashes is so coldBetween the world and you the icingAnd you know you have been told But it's too late to cancel, points of no returnNo time to learn until you burn... tonightForecasts (four casts) of our ration, of the crowd aloneAnd all those acting things you call the tide But when the curtain's falling...Waiting forlorn for the dayRemaining just those memoriesAfraid they will not stay Stay tonight, never bail... and you will prevailInner sight, former gale, now the storm won't failWasted years, wasted tears bringing back your fearsBut anything caused everything and now you got the wing Expressions on a window, would you call it stageBetter call it sage to be the hub tonightWhenever it may end up, never think to stopNever lead those days out from the light Like leaves over a loom galeWe're carried through the worldAnd after years on this assumed trailYou realize the aim would hurt Hurt your heart, take your soul, never find this holeTo rise again to fill the air, for you there's no spareWasted years, wasted tears bringing back your fearsBut anything caused everything and now you got the wing
