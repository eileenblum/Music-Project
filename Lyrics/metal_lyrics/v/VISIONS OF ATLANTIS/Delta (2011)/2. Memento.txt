To shed all this pain in meThis distant realityMemento is forcing theeTo return to a point to dark to flee TiedAddicted to the pastRemembrances to castNot waking from your self extinctionSoaked in acidOr in vainNo reasons to detainThose twinges just remaining the pastRemaining the last goodbye ofJust time off But all those memories hurting caneForever banned a futile gainBelow the crown it's not the sameJust a stain Now betrayals cloud your sightA tunnel with no lightNot waken from your self deceptionThen just try to face the truthI guess you missed the moveWhen they told you not to readMorenot to ask for an answerThis shrouded answer But all those memories hurting caneForever banned a futile gainBelow the crown it's not the sameJust a stain Tempus hic est ut veritatem dicereTempus hic est ut mendacia finireTempus hic est us animam intendereTempus rationis veridice hic est Time has come to face the truthTime has come to make the moveTime is here to feel the ragePower of the surpressed page And all is said and doneAnd all are goneFollow me follow me follow meInto the dark of doom And when night falls you'll knowWhere you belongHollow me hollow me hollow meTil you reach the loom After the dark there's a light we seeTowards the dawn of eternity Don't dare to failOr you'll never prevail Prevail over lies over jealousyWalk in to the light of eternity Don't dare to failOr you'll never prevail
