The long lost linkOnce drowned in the seaSentenced forever in darkness to be Searching since I can thinkFiction for the mostPassion for meNo doubt what I have found Forget your obsessionIt is not worth a thoughtLook at your life and the sorrow it brought A dreamer and a fool, that's what you are calling meUnreal like a ghost and damned to lethargy Come closer strangerDon't be scaredCome closer strangerThere is nothing to care I will make your dream come true And now I gravitate towards fatalityDon't hesitate I will come for youSomething great is inviting me and it forces me to come downThere is no light above you anymoreYour only salvation lies deep in the core of your soul Everything is here for you And now I gravitate towards fatalityIt's never to late for a wish come true It's the end of my dream and the core of my livingA pure sense of loveAnd the goal, for my longing it's everything but it's also my end Come closer strangerDon't be scaredCome closer strangerThere is nothing to care No chance to returnWater is surrounding meI can feel the pressurePart of a secretPart of the sea Now you see the priceSee what it takes I will make your dream come true And now I gravitate towards fatalityDon't hesitate I will come for youSomething great is inviting me and it forces me to come down There is no light above you anymoreYour only salvation lies deep in the core of your soul Everything is here for you And now I gravitate towards fatalityIt's never to late for a wish come trueAll the lights are shining Just for me and force me to go
