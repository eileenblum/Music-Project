Would you call me the Lord of the bad world?Would you blame it on me for being hurt?Would it change anything if I said yes?It's your own life, your own bloody game of chessAll the tears through the years, all the sorrowJust dismiss and there won't be tomorrowBut keep in mind only life is for livingThere is no fate but the fate you will give in When there's no time for me nowWithout rhyme or reason howShould I ever keep my vowAnd not fail At the crossroads between hate and gloryReaching pass-fail-point for nowRuling clear-cut not my kind of storyReaching pass-fail-point for nowAs we die there's just one way to chooseIt's the numen hot the soul you lose To be in charge is my declared intentionFortune no starry-eyed inventionIf they slow you accelerateIn their glare hidden sham and hateTo arise from the blank onesNo big thingIn the land of the blind the one eyed man is kingRecollect only live is for livingThere's no fate but the fate you will give in When there's no time for me nowWithout rhyme or reason howShould I ever keep my vowAnd not fail At the crossroads between hate and gloryReaching pass-fail-point for nowRuling clear-cut not my kind of storyReaching pass-fail-point for nowAs we die there's just one way to chooseIt's the numen hot the soul you lose At the crossroads between hate and gloryReaching pass-fail-point for nowRuling clear-cut not my kind of storyReaching pass-fail-point for nowAs we die there's just one way to chooseNow for a little whileNow for a little timeThere's no fate no evilNow and forevermoreThen at the raging shoreYou will be here
