Curtains of the worldPulled by the weakMade by the strongFear is to keep you where you belongYou fall apart while they grow strongRegret and despairNo longer to care for what you used to liveYour dreams are turning into nightmares you can't control Your minds landscape turned realityForms and shapes disappear Where daylight failsThere is no sorrowNo hopeNo lifeNo tomorrowIt's frozen situationThe final scoreThere is no imagination of anything Fight for a life you'll never ever reachA life like it is on TVDrown your confidence in alcoholTo feel strongTo feel saveTo be freeWork for the man you've never ever seenPay for what is yours anywayA wheel in the machine of societyReliableJust how you should be Your minds landscape turned realityForms and shapes disappear Where daylight failsThere is no sorrowNo hopeNo lifeNo tomorrowIt's frozen situationThe final scoreThere is no imagination of anything Stand upStand tallCry outYou will not fallBelieve in youLet your desires come true Where daylight failsThere is no sorrowNo hopeNo lifeNo tomorrowIt's frozen situationThe final scoreThere is no imagination of anythingA forwardlooking revelationForevermoreIn a fictional global nation under controlWe will be part of it
