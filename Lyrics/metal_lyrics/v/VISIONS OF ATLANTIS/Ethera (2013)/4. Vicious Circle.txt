Lying awake again
Feeling the emptiness
In your life
Nothing but the rain
Outside
No one is left behind
Who will remind you
To survive
And nothing but the rain outside

Lost inside your thoughts
About your past
Those that you wanted so bad to last
And now that you understand those things
We're real and start to feel
You've been wasting your life away

(Forever)
How much more it will take
(And ever)
This vicious circle to break

So dare a look in the mirror
And see what you've become
Just one miserable human
No need to ask how come
No need to ask how come

And you're still yearning
For your past that wouldn't last
It's gone so fast
And now you understand that all
Was real and start to feel you've
Been wasting your life away

(Forever)
How much more it will take
(And ever)
This vicious circle to break

It's not the time to stop believing
In things in life that worth the living

Live your fantasy
Never try to see all the
Things you meant to see

Open up your eyes
Try to realize time is running fast

Why? Can't you hear your
Screams hunting all your dreams
Always trying to find your
Way back to Heaven

Heard it all before
Hit again the floor
Wake up and you've still
Wasted all your life away

Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Ever, ever and ever
