I used to believe
In the good of mankind
These days there's no strength left
My soul turned to grey
Optimism means pain
There is nothing else for it
But to resign

Do not despair I am the wind
Just open up your wings feel free
I am your light in joy and grief
I am your fantasy

Bright light someone's
Calling my name (Someone's calling my name)
Shall I follow, shall I obey (Step into the bright light)
There is no choice I cannot stay
Can't remember my name
Only pray for salvation

Devastated no future
No reasons to live on
All ups turned into downs soon
Relieve me at once
My soul turned to grey
Optimism means pain
There is nothing else for it but to die

Do not despair I am the wind
Just open up your wings feel free
I am your light in joy and grief
I am your fantasy

Bright light someone's
Calling my name (Someone's calling my name)
Shall I follow, shall I obey (Step into the bright light)
There is no choice I cannot stay
Can't remember my name
Only pray for salvation

An inner voice so strong
Believe in me
My guardian angel I'm free
You're guiding me
My guardian angel

Follow me into the light
Free us from our agony
Follow the avatara

To a peaceful glory life
Let our souls become free
Guided by the avatara
