Dreams like daydreaming, like secluding yourself
Dreams of something called native home
Full of bliss and full of wealth
Wherever this takes me and wherever this may end
Soon it breaks me cause it keeps nothing to understand
A witless process, fading like bad memories...
Around they focus
On something they would call it peace
After these atrocities...

Shadow of integrity is wandering
Through these fields of death
Fighting fire with a fire gun
Like taking your last breath

Nothing left inside, my mind so blown away
What asking God within this chaos
Don't dare guessing what he would say?
But still obeying, aborting rationality

Around they're praying
For something they will call it peace
After these atrocities

Shadow of integrity is wandering
Through these fields of death
Fighting fire with a fire gun
Like taking your last breath
Fighting fire with a fire gun
Like taking your last breath...
