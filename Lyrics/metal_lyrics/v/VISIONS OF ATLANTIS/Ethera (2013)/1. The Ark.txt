The waves are as huge
As they never where before
Crossing silently the summits
Of those now parting sea from shore
Waiting for the sun
It's glittering on a velvet rug
World's end was full of riot
Like an apocalyptic drug
Human kind with all machines
Just too blind within its dreams
Hundred years of worthless lore
Mayas knew so long before

This is the entrance, the past awakes
Another culture, another dominion breaks
This is the end, this is our way
There's nothing left and nothing left to say

Standing on this ark
And heading for a new horizon
Eliding ruins of the old world
Underneath is advising
Heed the drone of this machine
A postponing elegy...

This is the entrance, the past awakes
Another culture, another dominion breaks
This is the end, this is our way
There's nothing left and nothing left to say
