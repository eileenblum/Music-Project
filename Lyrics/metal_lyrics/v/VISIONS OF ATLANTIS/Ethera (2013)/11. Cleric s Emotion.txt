Rising after world war three
From the dark and from ashes soon
All of them are forcing me
So much colder than the moon
Long gone a father's will
Threatened and prozium fill
Heart, soul, with ice and kill
Disabled emotion, zeal
I've spread my dreams under your feet
Tread softly cause you tread on my dreams

In this world of pain with nothing to gain
The most evil chain just built to maintain
In this time with no, no way to return
In dystopia dystopia we burn!

Walking with empty gazes and frozen feelings to the soil
Just afflicted by this sterile maze
Libria's a profane place to toil

I've spread my dreams under your feet
Tread softly cause you tread on my dreams

Trembling into consecution
reactive long-term doubtful fusion
Human racist evolution

In this world of pain with nothing to gain
The most evil chain just built to maintain
In this time with no, no way to return
In dystopia dystopia we burn!

If it's just per mill that there's one to feel
In a world of concrete and steel
If there's just one day, we're failing each way
There's no answer for nothing to pray

Libriaaa, my Shangri-la, nothing more
Hate and pain and war
Dreams are dead, the sky turns red
And solution is just vengeance instead...
In this world of pain with nothing to gain
The most evil chain is just built to maintain
In this time with no, no way to return
In dystopia
