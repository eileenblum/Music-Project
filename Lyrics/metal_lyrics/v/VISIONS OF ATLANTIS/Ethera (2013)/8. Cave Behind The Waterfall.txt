Dive in with me
In my soul's most valuable crypt
My only fear is
Will I see the light?
Will I even try to create it?

All this time I was hiding in the dark
Now I must be dreaming
Breathing slow in my 
Cave behind the waterfall
Is that light I see?

Dive in with me
In my soul's most valuable crypt
My only fear is
Can I touch the light?
On my hands will burn like all my pride?

All this time I was hiding in the dark
Now I must be dreaming
Breathing slow in my
Cave behind the waterfall
Is that light I see?

Love is dead
All the feelings gone
In my heart you'll live forever

All this time I was hiding in the dark
Now I must be dreaming
Breathing slowly deep inside this
Cave behind the waterfall
