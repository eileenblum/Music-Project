In a world where all are trembling
And a clan slowly descending...
Wandering through branches and grove
Unbearable heat we feel
For their sake we are now the trove
Never count how much they kill

It's an honour to die this way
For Tlaloc's mercy you will pay
Brittle branches promise hunger and pain
More immolation promises rain

If there are gods and we're their progenies
There must be memories, memories
Tragic end of misery...
If there was rain without the tears they need
To end this slavery, slavery our fate is sealed

For the words of the oracle we're waiting
The death of the sun we're anticipating
For rain and crop we're supplicating
It's worth the children's pain so aching

Like black birds they're locked up in cages
Still no rain, no grace, no wages
Gods not answering any prayers
For nothing killing, so futureless

If there are gods and we're their progenies
There must be memories, memories
Tragic end of misery...
If there was rain without the tears they need
To end this slavery, slavery...
Our fate is sealed!

More and more, tasting fear and gore
Like opened wounds so sore cutting the final core...

If gods are tenting this sanctuary
Why is there slavery, slavery a tragic end of misery
If there was rain without the blood they need
Where is this memory, memory our fate is sealed!
