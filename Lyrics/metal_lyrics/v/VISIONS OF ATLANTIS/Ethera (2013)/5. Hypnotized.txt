Fading in this world of hating
There's no one to trust
Innocence's lost there's only lust

And they made us promise
That we'll always believe
In foolish gods that don't forgive

Don't you think it's time
To reveal us the truth?
Poisoning our skies is just
What you created

Like hypnotized
Empty and blindfolded
We walk upon our lives
(Don't you notice?)
Like hypnotized
Giving our dreams and
Youth away for golden lies

Waiting for a chance to break
These chains that keep my heart
Buried and lost out in the dark

Still they made you promise
Not to seek for the light
Give it all up no need to fight

Don't you think it's time
To reveal us the truth?
If you want my soul
Why don't you come and get it?

Like hypnotized
Empty and blindfolded
We walk upon our lives
(Don't you notice?)
Like hypnotized
Giving our dreams and
Youth away for golden lies

I only see the light through you
It's all that matters
Tell me that it's alright...
Will you comfort me?
And then care for me?
I just need to believe...

Like hypnotized
Giving our dreams and
Youth away for golden lies
Don't you notice?

Skies are fading
My heart is breaking
Empty and blindfold we
Walk upon our lives
I just need to believe
