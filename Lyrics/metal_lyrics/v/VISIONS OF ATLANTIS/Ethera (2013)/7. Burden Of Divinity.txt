Gathering the flora of previous night
Drawing the curtain with the dawning light
Scattering new seeds for a broaching day
With my chiming wings I tempt my own decay

See my equine wain
And how I reclaim the morning haze
Watch me following my own failing
My own yearning for ravage

There was a light inside the tide
I have been waiting for the clarity of humanity
There was a dream within the night
To feel the blight it's just a burden of divinity

When there's sway
Advantage is the only way
For a warm thought
They took from this staggering morrow fay

There was a light inside the tide
I have been waiting for the clarity of humanity
There was a dream within the night
To feel the blight it's just a burden of divinity

Sun and moon to fall apart
World to follow, how bizarre
God and men like strong and weak
Decadence just at its peak

There was a light inside the tide
I have been waiting for the clarity of humanity
There was a dream within the night
To feel the blight it's just a burden of divinity
