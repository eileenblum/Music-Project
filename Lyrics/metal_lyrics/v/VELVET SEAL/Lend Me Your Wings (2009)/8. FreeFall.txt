Life is dragging you
Lower and lower
Your feathers fall
When only pity's your wing
Depressed or reasoned innocent
Burning it's marks
Deep in what you seek

Free fall sweet innocence
Into your hands falling
Burning fading away
Blaming the guilt that's
Crawling within

Don't play the lonely
When reason's around
Trying to find it's
Route within
Aren't you afraid that
The mask you're behind
Will soon be the one
To reveal your sins
Binded in chains of your own regression
Salvation seeking the truth within

Free fall sweet innocence
Into your hands falling
Burning fading away
Blaming the guilt that's crawling within
