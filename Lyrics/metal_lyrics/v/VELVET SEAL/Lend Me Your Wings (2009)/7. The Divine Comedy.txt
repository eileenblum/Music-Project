Divine lies
Or sacred thoughts
Stolen teardrops
From ancient holy cries
Spheres of hope
Seek embrace
Endlessly turning
The wheels of time
Can you feel me
I'll be deep within thee
To seal your pain

The untold lies
And sins revealed
Your frozen gaze
Keeps a million chilled
I hear your voice
In every song I sing
Your whispering words
Seeking the tempt within

Divine lies
Or sacred thoughts
Stolen teardrops
From ancient holy cries
Can you feel me
I'll be deep within thee
To seal your pain

The first break of morning
Still finds you trying
To embrace the soil
Beneath the path I lay

The untold lies
And sins revealed
Your frozen gaze
Keeps a million chilled
I hear your voice
In every song I sing
Your whispering words
Seeking the tempt within
