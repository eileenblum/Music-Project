Underneath the skin
A dark curse is flowing
What once upon was life
Seems a river of doom
Within the ageless maze
Of shadows we linger
Condemned to bear
The ages alone

Disciples of Caine
Our last waltz we march
Gather all kindred
I summon thee all
Wolves and vampires
The last time we march
Seeking forgiveness from the masters of time
Haunted is mine heart
Destined to darkness
A pond of despair
That our curse shall reveal
The moon's in the sky
In it's shadows we linger
Covenant of lies
The nightmare we hide

Disciples of Caine
Our lest waltz we march
Gather all kindred I summon thee all
Wolves and vampires
The last time we march
Seeking forgiveness from the masters of time

Silence me oh silent one or I'll curse
Thee all who bear the light we fear
Never and never again would we walk
The shadows will we fear the light
I curse thee all who bear the light we fear

Disciples of Caine
Our last waltz we march
Gather all kindred I summon thee all
Wolves and vampires
The last time we march
Seeking forgiveness from the masters of time
