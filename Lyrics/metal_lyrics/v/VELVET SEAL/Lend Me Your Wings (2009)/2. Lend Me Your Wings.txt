Break the silence now
I feel you here with me
The whispers in my mind
I hear them calling me
Confuse the dawn at break
I feel your eyes on me
Through the candle's light
Your gaze seems so much real

Lend me your wings
I feel your eyes on me
Whenever I dream again
I'll fly away
Just lend me your wings
I feel your eyes on me
Whenever I dream again
Will you fly with me
Break the glass of hope
To build anew these shards
As we try to hide
The scars deep inside
Through the candle's light
Your gaze seems so much real

Lend me your wings
I feel your eyes on me
Whenever I dream again
I'll fly away
Just lend me your wings
I feel your eyes on me
Whenever I dream again
Will you fly with me
