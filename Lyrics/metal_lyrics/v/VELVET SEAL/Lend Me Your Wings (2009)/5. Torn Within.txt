Tell me is this what you wanted
Clinging onto something so real
White I'm still searching for the path that
Could neutralize the poison we feel
Wishing you were crying
Deep within I'm trying
With every lie your dying
Inside me

Tear me deep within to pieces
Lost in something so real
Denied strangled by the web that's
Tied around the hopes that we build
Give me one reason I should bother
Struggling to believe that you're here
Just try to see the world with my eyes
You'd realize the hatred I feel
Break me into pieces if you want to

We both know that is all I can give
While you're still searching
For the strength that
You wish to see in someone you've seen
Wishing I was trying
Deep within I am crying
With every try your dying
Inside me

Tear me deep within to pieces
Lost in something so real
Denied strangled by the web that's
Tied around the hopes that we build
Wasted promised
Tempted ignored
Try see yourself smile in the shards of the shattered
Desperate to hang on to something just fading
No one seems to hear my screams

Tear me deep within to pieces
Lost in something so real
Denied strangled by the web that's
Tied around the hopes that we build
