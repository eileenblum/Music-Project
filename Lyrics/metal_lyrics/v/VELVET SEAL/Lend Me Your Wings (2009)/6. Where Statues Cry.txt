Sweep your tears
Sweep them aside my dear
You know it's hard
To see the angels through the tears
Or to paint with colours
When all around seems to fade
And the agony of life lies within

My time is near is this farewell
Memento mori my new kingdom calls
You'll find me here where statues cry
Where they cry
I know they cry
Let me die...

...Farewell...

I wish I had for a last time
A chance just an hour by the lake
Where we used to play
Used to play
When I'll grow up I'll be an angel
We used to say

Memories fading I won't let them go
I long for the journey as silence remains

My time is near our last farewell
Memento mori
My new kingdom calls
You'll find me here where statues cry
Where they cry
My time is near is this farewell
Memento mori my new kingdom calls
You'll find me here where statues cry
Where they cry
They won't cry
Hope they cry
Let me die
