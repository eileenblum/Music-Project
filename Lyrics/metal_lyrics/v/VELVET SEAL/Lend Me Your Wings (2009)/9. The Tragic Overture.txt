The face from the mirror
Is nothing but a shadow
Of what your absence left behind
See your sea of promises
Turn to draining pool of lies
As sorrows takes it's bride

I'm the virus in your veins
I'll be the one to fade your blames
I'm the scar you need to wear
Inside your shelter I'll appear
I'm the cross you bear inside
I'll be the whisper in your mind
Resist the pain I'm the cure
For this tragic overture
I'm tired of hiding
Waiting for time
To heat the scars you've left behind
Embrace me darkness
Give me rage to break the spell
To face the demons in my mind

I'm the virus in your veins
I'll be the one to fade your blames
I'm the scar you need to wear
Inside your shelter I'll appear
I'm the cross you bear inside
I'll be the whisper in your mind
Resist the pain I'm the cure
For this tragic overture
