Cold and stained
Shattered here you lay
As life slowly fades
The endless hunger remains
Through your veins
Your crimson teardrops fade
Your neck is the grail
I Thirst to feed
Eternal gaze
Brings the realm of fear

Full moon rising
The beast wakes inside
Endless hunger
Grieving day by day
Evil's rising
I can't hold inside
Fell me lurking in your dreams
I'll be the one
Day by day
The world seems to fade
With the smell of dusk
The beast inside awakes
Through your veins
Your crimson teardrops fade
Your neck is the grail
I thirst to feed
Forged in the curse
Like the seed
Blamed and banished
From the womb
That shields inside

How can you be afraid
In these arms dying softly
Follow me I'm still here
I'll lead you through the way
