Your sound of harmony drives me crazy
When I play your strings I feel the heart

Within the spell of love lonely sleepless nights
I can't get you out of my mind, lonely slepless nights

You are my obsession, a scale of seduction
A rare diamond with blue reflection

Within the spell of love lonely sleepless nights
I can't get you out of my mind, lonely slepless nights

Spell of seduction
I'm in the spell of seduction
Spell of seduction
I'm in the spell of seduction
