We've travelled on a thousand years
From the ice age through iron tears
When we fought our way through the storms
Now we've seen shaman in trance

Guardian spirits protect my way
We are warriors of steel
We were hunters of north
We were sons of thunder

Here the sky is deeper than blue
Here the ice is harder than steel
Here the sun can shine through the night
Here the wind can freeze your eyes

In the land of a thousand lakes
In the land of a thousand lakes
In the land of a thousand lakes
In the land of a thousand lakes
