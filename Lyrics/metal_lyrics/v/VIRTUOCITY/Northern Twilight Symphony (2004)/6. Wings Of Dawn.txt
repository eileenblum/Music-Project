When I look wide-open skies
When I see stars shining bright
And your light guides my way
Like the sun in a morning light

If I fly wings of dawn
You'll be there with wings of dawn

There is a time to crush and to heal
There is a time to love without a fear
There is a time for tears and joy
And when I looked to the eyes of the stars

Please cover me with wings of dawn
Save me with wings of dawn
