We raise our swords, we raise them up to the sky
We're running, we're fighting
We're searching the battlefields

When we raise our flag, we've conquered
We'll never surrender
We'll fight until the end

We've walked through the snow
We've fought our way through the time
When my sword is shining high
I'll kill the dragon of the sea

Flames in the sky
My sword is shinning
My sword is shinning bright
Flames in the sky
I'll kill the dragon
I'll kill the dragon of the sea
