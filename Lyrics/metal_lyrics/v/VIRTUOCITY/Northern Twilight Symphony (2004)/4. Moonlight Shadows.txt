I tried to reach a sign of love
Then my heart bled again
When I walked trough the gates

Like dreamers in the night
When we walk in moonlight
You took my heart, I couldn't believe
Why, why I ever fall in love

I see your face on my mind
I still wonder where you are
When I look the stars

I walk, I walk, I dream, I dream
In moonlight shadows
I cry, I cry, I hide, I hide
In moonlight shadows
