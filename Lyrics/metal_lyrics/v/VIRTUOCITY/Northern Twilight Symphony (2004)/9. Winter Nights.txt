I searched through the snow
I found a heart covered with ice
I wish I could fly when I walk in starlight
What I felt I soon realized, I wish could fly

Winter nights froze my heart
Winter nights alone in the dark
Winter night's tears in moonlight
Winter nights froze my heart

I searched through the snow, I wish I could fly
What I felt I soon realized when I walk in starlight
I wish I could fly

Winter nights keep freezing my heart
Year after year, day after vday
