I want to shine high in the skies
I want to be forever free
I want to see a change of time
I want to feel a piece of paradise

I always will be forever young, now and forever
I always want to be forever free, now and forever

I'll run into the light from the dark of the night
When the stars arise your heart bears the light

I always will be forever young, now and forever
I always want to be forever free, now and forever
