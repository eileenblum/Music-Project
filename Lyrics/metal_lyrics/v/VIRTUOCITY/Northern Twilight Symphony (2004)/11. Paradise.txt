On the edge of this broken world
Lonely hearts seek love

There's a time for innocence
A time for tears
A time to crush, a time to heal
A time see through the dream
A time to love without fear

You and me in a paradise
You and me in a paradise

There's a time for everything
A time to leave and a time to come
Until we meet again
From the sunrise to the moonlight
Only memories remain
