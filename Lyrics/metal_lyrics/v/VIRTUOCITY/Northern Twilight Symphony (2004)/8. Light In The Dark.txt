When I look at the moon, when I look to the sun
You are the only one, your wings cover me
There's a light, the dark, the night fades away
My guardian angel shows me the way

Is it all six or seven
Buy and sell
Hell or heaven
Seven stars
Seven seals
Seven angels
Seven kings

There's a light in the dark
There's a star within your heart
There's a light of the world
