I sense your spirit all around when you surround me
You are so invisible when you move

Hit the drum tonight, bones will tell the course

Moon shines in the night, theres a flame in the sky
When we dream tonight, when we fall deep in trance

Shaman beat
Shaman beat
Shaman beat
Shaman beat

Northern lights shine through the night
Lead us back home
Show us the way back to the north
We will fall deep in trance

Tonight we dream
Tonight we hear

Tonight we dream Shaman beat
Tonight we hear Shaman beat
Tonight we dream Shaman beat
Tonight we hear Shaman beat
