I spread my wings , I fly away back in time
When my visions, so clear and I fell the force

Now I feel I'm lost in time when I look into your eyes
I'm a child of the light when we walk in a paradise

Wheels of time keep on turning
Wheels of time bridges burning

Our wings someday burn when we fly too high
When we try to reach the stars would you heal this broken heart
