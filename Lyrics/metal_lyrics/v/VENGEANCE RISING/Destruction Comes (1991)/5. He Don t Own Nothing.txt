So you've been told, that satan owns, a contract to your soul
Or perhaps that he will have a kingdom and a throne
Well now it's time to realize, that none of this is true
He will not be taking any spoils, into his torment doom
The only thing that he can do is steal, since he's a thief
But when God brings the hammer down, this also will cease
He will not be heading up an army of satanic fiends
This idea that he'll have raging power, is just a pile of beans

My Lord the King
Owns the cattle on a thousand hills
He created all the earth, and he owns it still
Eternity He is, and immortality
Peace and tranquility, is what He will give to thee

Satan cannot give you what you can't get on your own
As a Christian it amazes me, how people bow like dogs to a bone
To a thief and liar who only rips them off
Sin is debt that cannot be paid by man, that's why God paid it all

And now time has come
To tell you satan lies
He owns not your soul
And doesn't own your mind

This idea that he is some type of eternal king
Is propagated by satanic fools
Deceiving and deceived

he don't own nothing

All praise his majesty Jesus Christ the King
He is the warlord, who will slay the satanic beings

As for the morbid angel
Cast from the place most high
Feasting on vomit
In his madness, he shall die
