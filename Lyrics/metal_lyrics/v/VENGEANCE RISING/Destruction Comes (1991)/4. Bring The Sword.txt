I don't know what you've been told, or even what you have lived through
But what I do know is that life as a Christian, shreds on what I knew
And I lived a life, of which many only dream
Every lust at my finger tips, the total Hollywood party scene

I like it, through the door, totally different, totally more
Intense to the core, since I found out about the sword

Bring the Sword

I like it, and may I say, let me look and count the ways
That I might please the Lord looking into, the warlords sword
I like it, through the door, totally different, totally more
Where I go, I'm never bored because I bring, bring the sword

You see my unsaved friend, if someone's to you lied
I'm telling you right now, we're on the warlords side
Calling you to join our force, none will stand who defy
Repent, don't be deceived, by the crowd that soon will die

I like it, through the door, totally different, totally more
Intense to the core, the revealed word, the mighty sword
I like it, and may I say, let me look and count the ways
That I might please the Lord looking unto, the warlords sword

Bring the Sword

The return won't be delayed, join us or you'll be slain
You have been given this time quickly now, choose life, decide
You'll like it, through the door, totally different, totally more
Intense to the core, and you will have the sword
