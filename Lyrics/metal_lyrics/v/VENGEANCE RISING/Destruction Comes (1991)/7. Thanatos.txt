Lying in the death trance, just before you die
Silent screams of horror, as you realize
Life on earth was not forever, as some how it seemed that way
You're true friends were we the Christians who tried to warn you of this day

We are the deathless, although the flesh will go, this is not the end of us, 
onward we flow
Come to the light child and you will see, the kingdom of peace, forever free
As you fight the death grapple, you realize the shame
Of all the disobedience, you've lost at satan's game
There is no victory without Christ, although there are those who claim there 
is
Deceivers of themselves, the death chamber is their end

Thanatos

When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth creature say
"Come and see" and I beheld, a pale horse, and a rider with a name
He was given the power, to kill a fourth and with him was hades
To use the beasts of the earth, the sword and hunger, and his name is

Thanatos

Grace before time began has now been revealed
Through the appearing of our savior Jesus Christ
Who abolished death and revealed
Thanatos where is your sting, you've been dealt the final blow
You could not hold messiah and eternally you will not exist
I'm calling you to carefully consider what I've said
Cause one day when you think it least, you may wake up dead
