We are here, there shall be no stopping us
Brothers understand, you have been sent
I seek to strengthen you, cause I understand
We are not here by our own hand

We are the rising, foretold by Simeon
Raise your fists as one
We are the rising, my brothers, I and thee
In service to the King

Understand, action is silent speech
John 13 know what I mean?
I through 17, speaks of we
You have the example, now lets see

We are the rising, foretold by Simeon
Raise your fists as one
We are the rising, my brothers, I and thee
In service to the King

Grieve me not, when I arrive
Show me the unity, that does not divide
Be, if you not be, don't waste my time
Rising, all - be 13, you know what I mean
