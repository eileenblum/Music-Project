In a split second of time, I realize it is over at least that is this life
And in my mind, where ever it was, I rolled it over
How had I lived? And what had I done with my life in Christ?
Just then a smile came in, to the half that was not fried
The smile looked at me and whispered, "Well done", "by the way, my name is 
jester"

Raegoul, now to wonder
Raegoul, always on his mind

He was, as he was, when he was, walking down the stairs
The stairs, where the lair, of deception had taken place, there
But from this he was spared through the truth, as the truth was, for those 
who cared
But a trap is a trap, and I guess only the unsuspecting are snared
Others are not, but are there, scared, bared, dared, pared, teared
He saw with his eyes, and the his eye, what was, what is, and what will be
And it was moments before, through-out the ages of history

Raegoul, worked toward eternity
Raegoul, did today

Raegoul thought about his mother who was about to die
A tear was dried by the speed and the heat of the time
The pressure of it all was really not there
Because only what was done for Christ at this point really mattered
Perspectives, perspectives, the way an event can make you see
That which is now, and that which will be
The river of time has currents that are winding toward an ocean it is 
already a part of
However until the last turn of the bend, those floating downstream never 
really seem to believe that
Mind, fried, sizzled, snap - and yet stronger than before

The tears of compassion, causing me to curl on the floor
Reaching out from within yet not reaching, yet reaching
Knowing the end long before you get there, is a comforting thing in a time 
like this

Raegoul, God watches you
Raegoul, you've won

This is it, and this it is, this is just what it is, what is it, just what 
is, just this what
And with answers too, no need to ask, there's plenty here, just don't ask 
about, what it's about
And round about then, it'll all sort out
