From the dust, where you've come from to the dust you will return
From there to the judgement seat, enter the kingdom, or to burn
This is not some story line, from Greek mythology
As deceptive hypocrite fallen angels, would have you to believe
We have the fact's, in light that truly darkness has descended
Ignorant shallow, no scholarship, a ship that's sunk and yet defended
I just don't understand the point, they mock, yet it's they who are in deep water
While drowning in the act, death with a proud face, satans slaughter

I call to you my friend, please come to understand
Our days are numbered, and there is a masterplan
You can serve God, just repent and you will see
As the destruction comes, you'll praise, instead of in horror scream

Cause, you can't stop it, no won't stop it

I see it all around, the darkness that pervades
Mans mind illusion - as though he could evade
Accountability, to the sovereign Lord who reigns
Against Christ, none can stand, so now stand with the saints

Repent cause, you can't stop it, no, wont stop it

Warning upon warning, I'll cry out, now and again
Like Noah, for those many years, we're just messengers who have been sent
I don't care if you think that it's redundant, like Noah, I'll warn too!
The same message, day after day, enter the ark, or the terror will engulf you

And to the twisted thoughts of so called brethren, who slam the name
Of our Lord Jesus Christ, by slamming us, get sane
You appear the Idiot, to any rational human
And if Judas you not be, repent and give us a hand, because

You Can't stop it
