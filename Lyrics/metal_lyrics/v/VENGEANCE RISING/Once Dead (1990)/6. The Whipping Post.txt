Praetorium
A garrison
Barrabas
Dreams of horror
Tumult
Crucifix
Mockery
It will end
Accusations
Guess who's the father of it

Some people think, he was weak, so he died
He was bad, no one touched him, unless he let them
Like dominos, they all fell, and they will fall
He accomplished what he set out to, the warrior prince, defeating all

Tied to the whipping post, for what he had not done
Substitutionary sacrifice, we're covered in the blood
Check it out, Noahs ark was covered with the Pitch
That kept it from sinking, sin is sinking people every day

Propitiation, expiatory blood atones
For that which you commit and what you do not know

You may think "I'm driving 55 so what's the big deal dude"
But you are in the 35, guilty, me and you

All have sinned, and that's just the way it is
But we are saved through conversion, based upon what he did

Conversion is the point where your total trust is in Christ
For salvation, but it imparts a new life
You do not get cleaned up to take a bath
Like receiving Christ, You'd better do it while you can

Regeneration, that which happens to the true
Born Again Believers, Inner conflict

Imputation, given the righteousness of Christ
Hamertia, the price is paid

Redemption, that encompasses the whole
Be diligent to understand, then speak it and be bold

Pilates wife, knew the gig and she freaked out man
Bar-Abbas understood substitution and
Simon Peter, a disciple in denial and
Roman soldiers long since dead, times got the upper hand

Blasphemy
Hypocrites
A King and Robbers
Golgotha
Eli, Eli
Lama Sabachthani?
A quote of David, in praise to God
Veil torn
Graves open
This is the Son of God
