This Herod he was troubled, when he first learned of Christ
Like so many of today, who neglect salvation life
And do not give the Lord Christ Jesus, the glory due his name
They try by their own righteousness, to enter Heavens gate

Herod's violent death

Another killed John the Baptist, for some wicked chick
Like those who kill the Word of God, that is, make no place for it
They claim that they're just busy, that maybe one day they'll get with it
But as the thief comes in the night, guess what they'll be hit with

Herod's violent death

A lesson to be learned, as History will repeat itself
The scripture, it does not lie
Billions will follow them to Judgement, because they will not receive Christ
Why don't you repent tonight

Herod's violent death

This death is just a type of the terror, that you will live in
If you refuse to become a Saint of God, consecrated to Him
Holiness is not the eradication of evil in the fallen nature of man
But consecration unto God, Come by Faith, you can

Herod's violent death
