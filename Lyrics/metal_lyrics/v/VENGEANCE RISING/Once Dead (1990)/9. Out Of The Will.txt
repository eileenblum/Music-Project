There I was, a Prophet of God
I didn't want to go explain to them Gods mercy
I had my reasons
I said, hey man have you got a ticket to Tarshish
That was the first mistake
I was spending my money on something God didn't want me to
It all boils down to disobedience you know

All that God had asked of me, was that I warn them all to flee
To flee from the Wrath to Come, but I wouldn't, man I was dumb
What if it had not been done for me, and I went off to flee
To Tarshish to leave them dead, and what I thought inside my head was
God can't find me now

And then it came, a gnarly storm
I knew it was God
I told the sailors, throw me over
And they said What?
I thought, man if it were Christians they probably wouldn't hesitate
And they said, No man, were going to help you out
And I said, hey man, it's God, throw me over

Into death I went, God's mercy alone could save my neck
I'll tell you man, I don't deserve it, that is Grace, you'd better learn it
Dead but on the third day, resurrected, a sign, catch it man
But on the way, into the death, this is what I prayed and said
God please find me now

Mercy and Grace
This is what God wants from you and me
Love acceptance and forgiveness
As he did for us, you see I was dead
Mercy and Grace
He's a God of second chances
Don't be out of the will
