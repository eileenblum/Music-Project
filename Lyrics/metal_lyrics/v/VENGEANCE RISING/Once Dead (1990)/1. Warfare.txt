"Our Father which art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory
For ever and ever
A-men"

We wrestle not against flesh and blood
Take the sword and prayer, understand the cause
The brothers in Adam, you're to call
Into the priesthood, warning all
Fight as a Lion

What are we in: Warfare

Onslaught against hell-bent deception
Through apologetics, confrontation
We're calling you, who will come
Show your fist, that you are one of us
Reconciliation

What are we in: Warfare

The weapons are not of the flesh
God given doctrine, not dogmatic mess
Some battles won, some battles lost
But we've got the war and that's what counts
It's about redemption

What are we in: Warfare!
