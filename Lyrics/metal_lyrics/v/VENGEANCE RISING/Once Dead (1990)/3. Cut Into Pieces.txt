His hands were ripped right from the limbs, t'was dagon
His head was broke off his torso, this false god
You'll find that great destruction comes from Gods hand
As it will across the earth, deniers beware

Cut into pieces

In the days, when there was no king in Israel
All did that which was right in their own eyes
Sex offence, and murder, they cared not for God
Said, strike them down for this, it is coming again

Cut into pieces

Levite took the knife and sliced her up
Because of the sin that had been in Gibeah
Immoral man in sex, outside God's will which
God gave for man in marriage, not to be profaned

Cut into pieces

Warn the world, The Master comes, be aware
Separate now yourself unto him
Or you will be found in the left of judgement
Consecration in the son, or eternal hell

Cut In Two Pieces
