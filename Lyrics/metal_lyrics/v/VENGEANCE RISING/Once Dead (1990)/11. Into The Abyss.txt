Blessed is he who reads
And hears the words of the Prophecy
And keeps the things that are written in it
For the time is near

Every eye will see him coming
All the tribes of the earth will mourn
They will realize what happened
This is real and we weren't wrong

The devil he goes
Into the abyss

The Destroyer will also be destroyed
With satan in Judgement that is Eternal
And for a thousand years we reign
Before the final crushing of his head

For this purpose, the Son of God
Was manifested to destroy the works
Of the adversary who hates your soul
He speaks lies to you, but don't believe him

The devil he goes
Into the abyss

Don't you know, we know the end
So why don't you come with winners
If now you deny the son
He will deny you in the judgement

Jesus Christ, He is almighty
The conquering Lion of Judah
All powerful, the Holy one
Even his Angel is stronger than satan

The devil he goes
Into the abyss
