Hagioi, apologeite peri tou pistos dia tou logou Theou

Saints arise

This ones for the brethren
Who've not won one soul yet
Let me ask you what are you doing, with your time
I speak of Grace not debt

Think about it
What you were left here for
Initiate conversion
And the discipleship the hardcore

You say I'm not prepared
Well what do you think your church is for
Your pastor labors weekly
So that you will learn involvement

When's the last time
You spoke about this with him
Or an elder to help you out
That's what they're about

Soul winners will shine like the stars forever
In the endless time
Who warn that the flood is coming
Like Sacred Warrior the servants of Christ

Jesus said, make disciples
And ask yourself, have you obeyed
It's personal evaluation time
We call the righteous, to the front line

Saints Arise!
