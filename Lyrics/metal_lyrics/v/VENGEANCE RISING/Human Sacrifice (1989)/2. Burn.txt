[G. Rodgers / R. Martinez]

Burn, Satan, burn
Burn, Satan, burn

The separations coming, the sheep from the goats
There are only two sides, no inbetweeners hope

For all our friends that you've got hold
And made them slaves they don't know
For them I will not sin in ceasing to pray
But I'll be glad when your damned, time will not delay

Burn, Satan, burn
Burn, Satan, burn

The separations coming, the sheep from the goats
There are only two sides, no inbetweeners hope

For now we must deal with it as it is unto this day
We wrestle not against flesh and blood, so we'll be glad to say

Burn, Satan, burn
Burn, Satan, burn
