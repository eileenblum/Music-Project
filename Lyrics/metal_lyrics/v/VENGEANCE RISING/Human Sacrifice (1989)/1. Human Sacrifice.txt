[G. Rodgers / R. Martinez]

Diety's blood, spilled for you
For indeed Christ was our passover
Hanging on a bloodied cross
A bloodied cross

Human sacrifice
Human sacrifice

Father forgive them for they know not what they do
Peter denied three times
They draw near to me with their mouth but their hearts
Are far from me

Human sacrifice
Human sacrifice

Do not be afraid for He is risen
All authority has been given to Him
Worship Him, and only Him
Jesus Christ, the Almighty

He was your human sacrifice

Jesus said, this is the blood of the new covenant
Shed for the remission of sins
That it might be fulfilled
Which was spoken by the prophets
