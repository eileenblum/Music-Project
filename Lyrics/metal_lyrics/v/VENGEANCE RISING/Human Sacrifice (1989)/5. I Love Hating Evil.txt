[D. Theime / R. Martinez]

I know it's forthright, to tell you now this way
Just what the Bible says and leave no shadows gray
For all the time I'm here I will and pull back not a punch
I know that deep inside you, you've got this nagging hunch

Whether we're for real and if we mean what we say
Let me put to rest your wonder, we stand behind the way
And if you don't believe it, just come talk to us yourself
You ask "just what you doin'?"
Calling you from the fire

The Bible teaches when you're saved you have new love and hates
If you do not then, you may well not be saved
Cause if you turn to Proverbs, chapter 8 and verse 13
There will be no question here, just as to what I mean

There is a certain notion that soon you will get
Hating the hell out of evil and loving people yet
And when you understand this, you will see what we're about
About pride and arrogance, soon you will have no doubt

Why I love hating evil
Evil pulls and tugs at you and says if you have more
Then you'll be satisfied: a lie to the core
It'll only rip you off then it'll make you pay
I've seen it all before, and man, it's hurt so any

So if you claim to be a Christian
Show it with your life
And do not advocate
Rebellion, filth, and lies
