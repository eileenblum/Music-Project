[G. Rodgers / R. Martinez]

Mid, post, pre-tribulation that will not matter here
Pre, post or a-millenal, the stand will fall to tears
To cause division for the things that will not obtain
The righteousness of God, imputed by His name

There will be nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
At the great White Throne
So now's the time to die

To turn the grace of God into licentiousness
To teach false doctrine based upon presupposition myths
Therefor repent or this is what you'll get
Torment forever in the eternal fire pit (lake)

Are you listening (not just hearing) to what I say?
