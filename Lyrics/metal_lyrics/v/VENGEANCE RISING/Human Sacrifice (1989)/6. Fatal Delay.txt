[L. Farkas / R. Martinez]

Violence and terror, a world that's filled with hate
And nuclear warfare, that will not annihilate you
Destruction of the flesh leaves the spirit to live on
There will be no escaping it the time is almost gone

The tribulation, will come to earth
You are being forewarned
You must have the new birth

Now this is conversion from sin to righteousness
As any as received, this is what it says
And regeneration, Philippians 1:6
Just give your life to Jesus or you'll die in your sins

I know some have told you that this is just a game
That this life goes on forever, who will you have to blame
At the judgement, the end of your fame

We love to serve God, as you can see we are not wimps
Don't let idiots lie to you, Christianity is not less
Come and join the warriors, serve God and be bold!

It's almost over, the time to repent
Death 1 could be any day now
The 2nd won't be death
