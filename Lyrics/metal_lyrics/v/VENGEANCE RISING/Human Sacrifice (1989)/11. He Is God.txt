[R. Martin]

In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with God
And the Word was God
And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us

He is God, He is God
He is God, He is God

The virgin shall conceive
And bring forth a child
And you shall call His name Immanuel
Which is meaning "God is with us"

He is God, He is God
He is God, He is God

Jesus said, "I and the Father are one"
And before Abraham was born, "I am"
Jesus said, "I and the Father are one"
And before Abraham was born, "I am"
