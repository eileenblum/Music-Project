[G. Rodgers / R. Martinez]

And I saw the beast rise
And the dragon gave him his power
And the world followed him
And it was granted him to make war
With the saints and to overcome them

Seven thunders uttered their voices
But the message has been sealed
However there are certain things that
The Lord has revealed

If anyone worships the beast (and receives the mark)
He will drink of the wrath (of God)
He shall be tormented with fire forever
In the presence of the angels and the Lamb

In the time that it all comes down
You'll find out just what witnessing is really all about
So when they ask you to take the mark of the beast
Just scream in their faces, "I want to be beheaded, beheaded"

I want (my) head chopped off
You'll see (my) body rot
But then (I'll) reign with Christ
And then you will fry
