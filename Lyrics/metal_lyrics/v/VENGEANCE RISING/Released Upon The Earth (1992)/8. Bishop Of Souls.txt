Alleluiah, God - you are worthy of all praise
Righteousness and honor are your's all the day
As for me, words can't express what my spirit knows as grace
Your mercy, how it strengthens me, in mercy I exist

What am I that you should mind, yet you've redeemed us by your hand
And who can challenge you in battle, they're crushed to dust on your command
You are the shepherd and also our High Priest
The life and the resurrection, the one who slays the beast

I see - what you've done
I'll tell - everyone
Your way - it is right
I'll Praise - You tonight
I'll be - not ashamed
Your word - I'll proclaim
You are - Lord Most High
You are the...

Bishop of Souls

The King of Kings, if I were a king - I'd give you my crown
Not worthy of the honor all mankind should bow down
As I've said it once before, all will bow anyway
But this ones from your servant, Lord be honored - this I pray

You are he who judges the earth, we rejoice when we see the vengeance
Brought down on the evil wicked who refuse repentance
We are going to praise the eradication of sin
They'll pour the bowls and vials, tread the winepress - Angels sent
