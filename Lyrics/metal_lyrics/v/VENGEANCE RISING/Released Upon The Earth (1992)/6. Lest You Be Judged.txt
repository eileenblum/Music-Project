I've heard enough of what you claim is sane
The lie you live is not a game
Reality it stays the same
They're your own words you've not been framed

Like Moses striking the second blow
The heart of God you do not know
And by your words you drive others away
From the Cross of Christ - where they'd be saved

Think not there's no account, your time is running out
You can bet without a doubt you'll answer

And you keep judging me with your wicked tongue
And then you say to me judge not lest you be judged
And you keep nailing me for something you've done
And you dare to quote to me, the words from above

I've heard enough, now I must answer you
You lie and steal it's nothing new
A scatterer I see through you
Out for dollar, not the truth

You've said judge not you see, yet you keep judging me
You lie about Christianity, you don't know jack

And you keep judging me with your wicked tongue
And then you say to me, judge not lest you be judged
And you keep nailing me for something I've not done
And that behind by back, lets take it one on one

And you keep judging me - Blinded and you can't see
And you keep judging me - What is and should not be
And you keep judging me
If you want the truth you'll see
