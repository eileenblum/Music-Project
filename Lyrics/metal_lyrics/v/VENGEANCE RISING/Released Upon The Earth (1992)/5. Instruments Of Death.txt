Given the time to repent they fail to reply
To the just and Holy one they now await to die
God's enemies will lick the dust, a fact they fully deny
He holds them in derision, in vain they rage against the Christ

Instruments of death

They set their face against His way, inward they are destruction
Mock insults they do hurl, they care not for the instruction

They's answer for their every word unless they turn to Him
He wait's for them in mercy before the slaying begins
He bends the bow and also prepares the instruments of death
He'll use in the final war, give up before it begins

Instruments of death

They set their face against His way, inward they are destruction
Mock insults they do hurl, they care not for the instruction

God is a just judge, angry with the wicked every day
If you do not turn back you will face the day
When you stand before Him in a fear you can't conceive
He beckons you to check the facts so that you will believe

We ask not that you take some blind leap in the dark
Our faith is based on fact, God doesn't miss the mark
The fact is that He still cares enough to tell you once again
Come into the fold, join the force of God, not to die but to live
