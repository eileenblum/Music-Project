Nation will raise against nation
Earthquakes, pestilence and disease
These are just the beginnings of sorrows
Take heed that no one deceives you

Multitudes of people begin to bind in a frame of mind
They come to hate you because you stand for the truth of Christ

Remember the full counsel, recall just what Christ said
You'll be hated for my names sake, endure to the end

Do not be discouraged when they talk their rope
By prayer seek interseccion, for they hang themselves on the gallows pole

And You will be hated...
You'll be hated
You will be hated
And You will be hated...
For Christ's sake hated
Unjustly hated

Many come claiming to be Christ
Furious when you call their hand
They're chanels to the hell gate
Leeching serpents - in castles of sand

And many as check not the word get trapped into their web
And like with the dark black widow, looks like love but it is death

Those who practice evil, yes, they hate the light
And you are the light of the world and they hate you alright

For you know the will of God and seek His will to do
Go now in force strong in His might, remember two by two

Just don't forget
Don't be surprised
You will be hated
By those who love a lie
Don't take for granted
The hearts towards our kind
Messiah told us
We'd be despised

But we live, they die
