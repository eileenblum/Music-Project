Artistic expressions, of revealed reality
Truly a useful tool, use them such and see
Explain the dark ones so full of lies
They are but shadows and soon to die

They didn't realize time's on our side
Evil would have it, we'd succumb to demise
"As the Father sent me, I send you"
Occupy

Released upon the earth
Occupy
We'll Occupy
Released upon the earth
