Search to find the mystic grail
Reach out for rainbow's light
Wish to live, forever young
Passion without fright

Love against the dark of night
Noble, brave and true
Journey into force of life
The power's all for you

A neverending quest for love
On the shore of memories
Timeless on a land of luck
The Ryche of spirit beneath

At the end of life, we are sure
But how to overcome the end
On the way to the grail
To the depth of experience

Fight back, Perceval
Find the wheel of fortune
Fight back, Perceval
And find the mystic grail
Fight back, Perceval
Find the wheel of fortune
Fight back, Perceval
And find the mystic grail

One man's always ready to go
To convince every tear
Wheel goes up and down with you
Immortality won't appear

Horn of plenty, a Grail's name
Made by druids of the Celts
Isa thousand years old
That's what the legend tells

Fight back, Perceval
Find the wheel of fortune
Fight back, Perceval
And find the mystic grail
Fight back, Perceval
Find the wheel of fortune
Fight back, Perceval
And find the mystic grail
Fight back, Perceval
Find the wheel of fortune
Fight back, Perceval
And find the mystic grail
