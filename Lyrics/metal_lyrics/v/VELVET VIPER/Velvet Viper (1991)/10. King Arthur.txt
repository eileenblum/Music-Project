King Arthur's round table alive forever
King Arthur's round table is back in this song

There were two knights
Who became so bitterly jealous
They thought that one of the knights
Was better than the others
Jealousy is the purgatory of vanity

The brave knight
Called Lancelot
He was first
In tournaments
All men spoke well of him

This table, once so precious
Could not survive great King Arthur
But he's not dead, he still dwells on
In Avalon

No more is written
Of Arthur King
But he will come back
When his Kingdom is
Is in need of him

King Arthur's round table alive forever
King Arthur's round table is back in this song

King Arthur's round table alive forever
King Arthur's round table is back in this song
King Arthur's round table alive forever
King Arthur's round table is back in this song
