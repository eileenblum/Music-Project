Fascinated by the stone
Zed Yago fell in a hole
Through dimensions
Without any control

She met down under
The world from over yonder
The greatest of all wizards
Merlin, priest of superstition

If you need help
Send a call up here
Strong willpower only
Makes Merlin appear
A spirit force
And fantasy
Priest of superstition is Merlin

Merlin, druid of the Celts
Showed her his world
And King Arthur's table
With the knights who were able

To guard the gates of Camelot
No magic, whatever
Whatever could stop
The ruin, ruin of Camelot

If you need help
Send a call up here
Brave willpower only
Makes Merlin appear
A spirit force
And fantasy
The priest of superstition is Merlin

Queen and priest, witch and the beast
Druid and dwarf, all live there, hidden and apart

If you need help
Send a call up here
Brave willpower only
Makes Merlin appear
A spirit force
And fantasy
Priest of superstition is Merlin

If you need help
Send a call up here
Brave willpower only
Makes Merlin appear
A spirit force
And fantasy
Priest of superstition is Merlin
