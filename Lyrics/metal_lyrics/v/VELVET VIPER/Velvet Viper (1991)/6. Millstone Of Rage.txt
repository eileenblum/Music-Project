Her life has one way
No time to wait
She's on a mery-go-round

Blood so hot
Nothing can stop
Stop, the fow in her veins, no doubt

Millstone of rage
Grinds slowly but well
From heaven above
Through the world to hell
Millstone of rage
Grinds slowly but well
From heaven above
Through the world to hell

Fools of destruction
Bad satisfaction
Should not have the last word

Thoughts are free
Start and see
Trust and believe only your own roots

Millstone of rage
Grinds slowly but well
From heaven above
Through the world to hell
Millstone of rage
Grinds slowly but well
From heaven above
Through the world to hell

Somebody out there
You better take care
With your double-cross snake-bite

Cold as ice
She realized
The force of time's still on her side

Millstone of rage
Grinds slowly but well
From heaven above
Through the world to hell
Millstone of rage
Grinds slowly but well
From heaven above
Through the world to hell
