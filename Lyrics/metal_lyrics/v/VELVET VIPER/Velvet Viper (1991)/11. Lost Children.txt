The lost children in the dark
Fear the light, fear the light
The lost children in the dark
Will unite, will unite

Water means life
Pollution - we're to blame
The human race
Can't escape from the game

We're the lost children in the dark
Fear the light, fear the light
We're the lost children in the dark
We'll unite, we'll unite

The poison leads
You through the night
A passion for gold
Is making you blind

The lost children in the dark
Fear the light, fear the light
We will unite, we will unite
We will unite, we will unite
We will unite, we will unite
Fear the light, fear the light
We'll unite, we will unite
Unite
Unite
