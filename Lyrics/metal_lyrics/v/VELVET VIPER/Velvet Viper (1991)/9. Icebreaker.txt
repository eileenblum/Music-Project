Good enough is never enough for you
Stay your course
If you want to get through

No memories
Explaining love
Take a risk
Give what you're got

Icebreaker, she's on her way
Icebreaker, she's on her way to your frozen heart

Spare a thought
Before it's too late
No fear cause you'll find a way

Anvil beat
With a fist of steel
Sweat runs down
From your back to your heel

Icebreaker, she's on her way
Icebreaker, she's on her way to your frozen heart

Don't waste your time with foolish pride
Be self-confident

An anvil beat
With a fist of steel
Sweat runs down
From your back to your heel

Icebreaker, she's on her way to you
Icebreaker, she's on her way to you
Icebreaker, she's on her way
Icebreaker, she's on her way to your frozen heart
