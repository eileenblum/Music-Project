Something grey came along
On a pale horse with blue eyes
He was riding on, so strong
Came from paradise

Up there in heaven he started the ride
A ride no one can beat
A burning fire yellow, red
A rain of evil seed

Hammerhouse of mystery
Knight of pale surprise
Leader of the fallen spirit
God of the flies
Hammerhouse of mystery
Knight of pale surprise
Leader of the fallen spirit
God of the flies
King of lies

And they gave him the power
That he would need
To rule the fourth part of the world
A one-way ticket, indeed

Hammerhouse of mystery
Knight of pale surprise
Leader of the fallen spirit
God of the flies
Hammerhouse of mystery
Knight of pale surprise
Leader of the fallen spirit
God of the flies
King of lies

What is the fourth part of the world
Number one is heaven, two is water
What is the fourth part of the world
Three is the earth and four is hell

Hammerhouse of mystery
Knight of pale surprise
Leader of the fallen spirit
God of the flies
Hammerhouse of mystery
Knight of pale surprise
Leader of the fallen spirit
God of the flies
King of lies
God of the flies
King of lies
God of the flies
Flies...
Flies...
