Too little to live
Too much to die
In a royal land
Call of the wild
Follow the yearning
It happened once upon a time

In the Kingdom
Of the giants
There's nothing left to win
Call of the sea
They had to find
The point of no return

Pirates out to serve
Service of HM
Rebels die hard
Heroes of HM
Her Majesty, rebels die hard

Sailed the sea
Bit the clouds
Until they got the call to fight
Buccaneers on Her
Her Majesty's service
Buccaneers now with all rights

Pirates out to serve
Service of HM
Rebels die hard
Heroes of HM
Her Majesty, rebels die hard

Fire, fire
Fire down below, fire

Pirates out to serve
Service of HM
Rebels die hard
Heroes of HM
Her Majesty, rebels die hard
Die hard
