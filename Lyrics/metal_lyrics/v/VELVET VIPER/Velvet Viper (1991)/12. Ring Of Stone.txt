In front of Stonehenge
Mysterious rocks
The air above
Smells secretly hot
Zed Yago walks through fog
Beware, beware, beware
Lest you fall

Go ask the sages
There was no wind
Gain access to all ages
To move the leaves
A shady past
Hear the call
Beware, beware, beware
Lest you fall

Ring of stone, ring of stone
Beware, beware, lest you fall
Ring of stone, ring of stone
Endless chain from down below

The temple was built
5000 years ago
It grew immensely
Stone by stone
Another world
A magic wall
Beware, beware, beware
Lest you fall

Ring of stone, ring of stone
Beware, beware, lest you fall
Ring of stone, ring of stone
Endless chain from down below
Where stones are live

Ring of stone, ring of stone
Beware, beware, lest you fall
Ring of stone, ring of stone
Endless chain from down below
Down below
