There is a world behind the world
Ruled by the lady of the sea
There is a world behind the world
Where every dream comes true

Once upon a time
A world called Avalon
Women's island, behind the stone
Search for the doors
Some large, some small
Take the chance to go to Avalon
Where elves are free

Once upon a time
Christians came along
And they injected the twilight of the gods
They had one God
One holy door
No one should wish to go to Avalon
Where elves are free

World behind the world
Ruled by the lady of the sea
World behind the world
Where every dream can be
Can be reality

Once upon a time
Doors vanished one by one
The goddess' home was out of sight
Temple's gate
Turned into stone
Now, no one can go no more to Avalon
Where elves are free

World behind the world
Ruled by the lady of the sea
World behind the world
Where every dream can be
Can be reality

World behind the world
Ruled by the lady of the sea
World behind the world
Where every dream can be
Can be reality
