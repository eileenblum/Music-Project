Maybe a poetry-creation
Sometimes the result of fantasy
Maybe a writer's invention
Tomorrow it will be reality

Devouring only human spirit
Alien invasion
Glutton beasts all over
Every nation

Thommyknockers, brain-eaters
See the day of doom
Thommyknockers, brain-eaters
See the blood on the moon

Maybe they live in a deadman's swamp
Foul treasure under their knees
That's where the ghosts of men once killed
Guard the fantastic seeds

There, where no colour can be
They're waiting to come
Jungle of fantasy
Restless on the run

Thommyknockers, brain-eaters
See the day of doom
Thommyknockers, brain-eaters
See the blood on the moon

Black letters telling us more and more
We make the same mistakes just like we did before

Thommyknockers, brain-eaters
See the day of doom
Thommyknockers, brain-eaters
See the blood on the moon
Thommyknockers, brain-eaters
See the day of doom
Thommyknockers, brain-eaters
See the blood on the moon
