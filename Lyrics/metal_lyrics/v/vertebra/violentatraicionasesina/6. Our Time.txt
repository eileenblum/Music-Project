[Felipe:]
No pain no gain
There's no time to waste
Push the limit again to overcome disgrace
Stay strong rise up your head
Watch in the eyes of the dead, don't hesitate

[Marcelo:]
Our enemy is just right here
You better shoot to kill
There's no such thing as peace
We want to see them bleed

Our time!
This is our time
Our time!
This is our time
Our time!
This is our time

[Felipe:]
No pain no gain
There's no time to waste
Push the limit again to overcome disgrace
Stay strong rise up your head
Watch in the eyes of the dead, don't hesitate

[Marcelo:]
We will survive this war
Keep closer don't give up
Let's fight and hold our ground

Wake up the time is over,
Listen out, our time is now,
Wake up up the time is over, there is no coming back

[Felipe:]
No more traitors, fucking rats
You better start to run
There is no place to hide
we will fuck you up

Our time!
This is our time
Our time!
This is our time
Our time!
This is our time

[Felipe:]
No more traitors, fucking rats
You better start to run
There is no place to hide
we will fuck you up

Our time!
This is our time
This is our time

Vertebra ain't nothing to fuck with
This is our time
This is our time
