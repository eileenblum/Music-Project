No longer the same 
The order as changed 
This time is chaos 
A better world? 
No more references 
No absolute 
Individual values 
A better world? 
An obliged passage 
To coonsciousness 
To freedom of thoughts 
To better individuals 
Struggling minds 
For a time 
Lost in darkness 
Fighting to find the light 
Healing wounds 
Yet so painful 
No more certaintie 
Fear and doubts 
Deprogrammed 
Filters off line 
To know not believe 
Will chaos bring a new world? 
Accurate readings 
Uncomfortable 
Reality perceived 
Without lie or illusions
