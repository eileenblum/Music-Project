Always complaining
Want more - want better
Always compaining
Never satisfed
You want improvement
You want things of change
Stop bitching - stop whining
Get up and move your ass
I'm tired of what I see
I'm tired of what I hear
People are so lazy
Nothing falls from the sky

NO PAIN - NO GAIN!
ACTION - REACTION!
NO PAIN - NO GAIN!
ACTION - REACTION!

Don't blame the others
You are responsable
ACTION - REACTION!
You get what you deserve
It's no magic
It's NO PAIN - NO GAIN!
Make the effort
Get the results!

NO PAIN - NO GAIN!
ACTION - REACTION!
NO PAIN - NO GAIN!
ACTION - REACTION!
