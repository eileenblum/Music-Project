Mother of life
Yet so deadly
With her cold arms
Embraces without mercy!
Frozen to death
Strong element
She forces down
Against the will to live
Drowing deep
Into darkness
A force of nature
Fluid coffin
But also cradle of fall
So powerfull
Hands on life and death
In her grace
No escape for her own child
Gift once given
Taken away
Breathe the water
As it goes higher
Take a last breath
FEEK THE IMMINENCE OF DEATH!
