Minister of death
Please take my soul
Minister of death
I'll hang 'em all

I hail the discipline which I'm granted
Embrace the firm iron grip
Stand in line and obey the orders
Minister of death
I'll hang 'em all

Down in the trenches ready to fight
A war of hatred with victory in sight
Filthy harlots and rat infested scum
Minister of death
I'll hang 'em all

All moral codexes put aside
It is killing to survive
I'll end the battle at the last death-rattle
Minister of death
I'll hang 'em all

There will be no retribution
Your king has already been hung
Merciless i slay his memory
Minister of death
I'll hang 'em all
