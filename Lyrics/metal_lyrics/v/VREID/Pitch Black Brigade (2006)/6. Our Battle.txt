A pale sky
Lack of visibility due to fog
A quit humbling sound
As the train of war trembles
To it's final destination

Rain falls
As life of men perish
At the hands of the leader
No mercy will be shown

Even the slightest of doubt is gone
The final solution being born

As we rise our banner
As we walk on proud
As we take what's our to hold
With no one by our side
