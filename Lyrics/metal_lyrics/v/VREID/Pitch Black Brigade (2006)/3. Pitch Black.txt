Pitch black attack

Alarming sirens fuel the fear
Everywhere there's chaos and decay
Glass shattering
War drums battering
Enter the pitch black brigade

A new regime without crown or king
Ruled by ice cold cadaver discipline
A ravenous destruction of all civilian resilience
A blackened way on this blackened day

The ultimate grimness
Organized with militant precision
An amoral killing brigade
Bringers of sorrow, hate and suppression
Soldiers of perdition marching on

Torture and terror are indoctrinated means
Sledge hammer propaganda oils the war machine
Historical misfits are brought back to life
Immortalised as icons for the pitch black brigade totalitarian regime
