Left to blame
Left in shame
A future laid in ruins
Left to blame
Left in shame
A future left to hate

A scapegoat for all sins committed
An icon for all that is evil
Lords of victory compose the history
An illusion of truth is created

A punishment beyond the consequence of the crime
All protests swept aside
With no change for appeal or new evidence for revealed
Vengeance is bound to appear with time

A people stained by the filth of others
Wants to wash their name clean
A new evil to replace the old one
Mass eradication the ultimate mean

In times of misery the herd is easy to lead
A golden future will always breed greed
Compassion is a codex only efficient
When man got more than he needs
