Welcome to the asylumA monotheistic sectWhere reasons are abandonedThe one almighty you serve and protect Mythic manifest of interpreted scripturesA roadmap to the spiritual callWhile life is not enough and death too muchArmageddon penetrates your soul Doctrines might be carved in your scriptsWith the promise of an everlasting better lifeBut as Messiah don't deliverYou need something biggerA fear of an adversary unify you all Welcome to the asylumA monotheistic sectWhere reasons are abandonedThe one almighty you serve and protect
