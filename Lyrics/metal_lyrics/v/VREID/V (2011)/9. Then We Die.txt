From the wilderness we aroseSpread our wings in searchFor answers to eternal questionsLife after deathThe meaning of birth Sometimes we see itBut most times we denyToo afraid to liveThen we die Living for dyingIn fear of goodbyeAlways preparedThen we die Sometimes we see itBut most times we denyToo afraid to liveThen we die Living for dyingIn fear of goodbyeAlways preparedThen we die Easy to point fingersSo quick to disrespectWhat lie right aheadBlinded by the awe for deathAs we hear the clock tickingWe search and swallow liesWe forget what is of valueThen we die Sometimes we see itBut most times we denyToo afraid to liveThen we die
