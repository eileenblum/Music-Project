Ageless rivers flowInto the blackened fjordsMountains break the skiesAs infinite monuments of old The sound of emptinessWastelands of deathlike sightsThese endless yawning gapsNo difference between day and night With no sun burningThere is no lightWith no moon shiningBlack shades whiteA substance boundlessIndefinite desireThe bleakness is eternalA flame without fire From nothingnessTo an everlasting forceA permanent chaosThat is forever preservedA primordial condition Eternal and agelessWhere all is bornEverything will be destroyed
