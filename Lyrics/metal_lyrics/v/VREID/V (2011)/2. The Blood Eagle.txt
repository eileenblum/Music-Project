Born out of worlds of fire and iceThe nature of spirits embrace our livesFrom the underworld to aboveWe worship the fertile soil Carved in the backBlood strained wings are dressedAn image of grotesqueThe blood eagle of human flesh Rituals for the godsWe offer our respectThe blood symbols our strengthOur pray is yours to collect Carved in the backBlood strained wings are dressedAn image of grotesqueThe blood eagle of human flesh Blood over a stoneThe sword penetrates the fleshRibs are cut by the spineLounges pulled out of the chest As the eagle takes it's shapeThe human life expiresSalt sprinkled woundsFlavours the blotTo the kings of ice and fire
