Wasted ashore by a stormfull floodLeft behind by their natural kinRaised by disrespected peasantsBorn with nothing, but with a world to win Set aside as a waste of natureNo companion for the wealthy clanMocked and feared for their appearanceBlessed by divine beauty and strength Their youthful spirits urge to rebelTheir nature is to seek A rebellion adored by their peersHatred by the king and his headNever responding to threatsHunting down looters of unjust Their youthful spirits urge to rebelTheir nature is to seek As the night embrace the hillsThey shape as their mothers shameWolverine bastards roam these hillsA devilish dance stampede their game
