A northbound pathAlone I walk this landThese lordless fieldsUntouched by manThrough the narrow woodsTrees shield the windJust a whistling soundDesolation becomes me The sound of the riverThe source to my lifeI walk along herAdoring her pristine sight I am of the earthThe past is my bloodAncestors rebirthMy seed growsUnder this majestic mountainThere is a prosperous fieldThis will be my homelandWhere my river streams Stone build on stoneWalls become to keepThe outside at a distanceMy blood within reachA body well wornScars of lifeHere I liveHere I die The sound of the riverThe source to my lifeI walk along herAdoring her pristine sight
