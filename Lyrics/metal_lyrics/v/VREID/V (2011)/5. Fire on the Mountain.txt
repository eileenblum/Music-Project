Rebirth of lifeNew moral values awakeA beast takes shapeAwakes an inner hate Primal instincts let wildAn untamed figure ariseFrom the shadows it's watchingAn enclosure of the skies Order and rules set asideThe desire for power reignsThe quest to huntShadows the hope of being saved The savage spiritNo longer restrainedKill or be killedThe hunter versus his game Fire on the mountain Fire on the mountainInnate evil aliveAs the flame is dyingLord of the flies Fire on the mountainFire on the mountain
