Buried alive in a world of disappearThis grey maze shadows my sightA self made coffin buried by dreadAn overwhelming angst fills my head Captivated by the presence of othersI aim at them to mirror my thoughtsTo reflect and share my visionsI am something, without them I am not From the shadows I watch and observe themLiving my hunger through their livesEvery move directed with cautionLet them see through me, but never inside I wander through the shadowsNaked by the guilt in their eyesThe eyes reflect my sadnessShall I seek their forgivenessHow great it would beTo release all sorrows, to set my soul free I lit the fireMy world burns todayTomorrow is of redemptionWith ashes I wash it all away There is no reek of sulphurNo overwhelming heatI see no malignant maestroI have no sense of defeatA mental purificationShape shifting transformationA blur has been removed from my sightWith the ashes I rise Liberated by the will to powerI seek no reflection of my thoughtsI have a crystallized visionI am nothing, without them I am all
