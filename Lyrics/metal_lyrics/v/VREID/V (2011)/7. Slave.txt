With unrestrained steps he wandered the earthAn appetite for survival, a natural lawWith no vice nor virtueThere was no moral nor awe Man was born free, now he is everywhere in chainsOnce a wild spirit, now a socialized slave Harvest the fruits of what is sownYet the earth belongs, belongs to no oneBy fencing a piece of landHis freedom is now gone Man was born free, now he is everywhere in chainsOnce a wild spirit, now a socialized slave
