With the military capitulation in 1940,
Weapons are sheltered away,
Contact is kept by officers,
Resistance is growing by the day.

Some men fight for freedom,
Some men die for you,
Some men fight the oppressor,
Warriors of the Milorg group.

By Allied Support,
They are trained to reclaim the North,
With Sten guns in hand,
They serve their kingdom and land.

Some men fight for freedom,
Some men die for you,
Some men fight the oppressor,
Warriors of the Milorg group.

Airdropped in the cold mountains,
Crossing the Nordic sea,
Camouflaged by the inaccessible nature,
Sabotaging the German War Machine.

While depressions and negativity,
Is ravaging our land,
Their youthful battle spirit,
Ignites the resistance.

Their courage and will,
A growing inspiration,
To stand up and fight,
For the day of liberation.
