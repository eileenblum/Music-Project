Far away, the sound of a symphony,
Wagner the soundtrack to my tragedy,
Broken ribs and bloody feet,
Ripped off hair and knocked out teeth,
Brutal assault with sadistic methods,
Hell-bent for my knowledge,
No means are too extreme,
But I am not a rat,
That will sell out my country,
I'll rather die than contribute,
To your Empirical dream.

I will never lay at your feet,
My lips are sealed.
My will you cannot defeat,
God DAMMIT,
I will not speak!

Marks of cigarettes burned into my skin
Symbols of how I never gave in
My knowledge is limited to my own cell,
To make my comrades avoid this hell
Death camp the last level,
I will disappear in nacht and nebel
Disbanded like a devilish creation,
I will die for my Norwegian nation.

I will never lay at your feet,
My lips are sealed.
My will you cannot defeat,
GODDAMN IT,
I will NOT SPEAK.
