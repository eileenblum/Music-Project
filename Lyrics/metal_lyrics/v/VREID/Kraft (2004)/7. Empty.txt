There are times when time stand still
Times where there are no tomorrow
Remembering the days of life
The days we used to live

Innocent ages of most valuable time
The sense of not knowing
Only increases with time
It all seems like borrowed time

These empty spaces seems so eternal
These empty spaces can never be filled

You were there in yout majesty
But you are not there anymore
Strange how life is fading
You have found peace while we mourn
The gods have taken you home
Back to nature you have gone
Back to where we all belong
Death has taken its toll
