A rebel cursed from below
A devil in the eyes of those above

I am a fallen angel, a god-hating demon
I am an arising bandit, an erotic sinner
Embrased the fruits of our sexuality
It is in man's nature to take and not to recive

Folding hands, bending down on your knees
Praying that divine powers will punish the likes of me
But tell me are you deaf, stupid, or blind?
History has showed us that man is evil
Und nur die Kraft des BÃ¶sen besteht

In the vision of the perverted man
There is a universe for others unseen
An image of the darkest place to be
Diagnosed with the sickness of being irreligious

A degenerated form of life. Oppressed by awe. Raped by light

A rebel cursed from below
A devil in the eyes of those above
A deviant from god-fearing morality
A fulfiller of forbidden fantasies
