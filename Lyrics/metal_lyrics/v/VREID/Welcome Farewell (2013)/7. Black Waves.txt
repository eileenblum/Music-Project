White foam cover the blackness
Like a frowning beast it tumbles
It looks so timeless and eternal
So far from the known world

In glimpse from the skies
Moonlight is shed on this beast
Stretching through the horizon
It's mountain like endlessly deep

Into the black waves I am sinking
Drowning away from the ghosts

Disappearing into eternity
Into the mirror of my soul
The pounding sound is mesmerizing
A roaring surface with a hidden beneath

Listening to its monotony

Over and over it repeats
