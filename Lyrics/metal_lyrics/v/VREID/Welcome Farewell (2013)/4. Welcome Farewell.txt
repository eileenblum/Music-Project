A blood red fire
That burns inside
Ignites the spark to feel alive
This line is moving from time to time
Sometimes it's burning sometimes it dies

This line becomes me it draws my life
My will is of power but the line defines
This bond of blood immensely strong
Stays alive long after I am gone

A seed planted to grow
Challenging its obstacles to come
Steered by the hands of its creator
Or a stormier walk alone

Lead into life
Loved beyond what's told
A bondless bound is growing
Instantly all is gone

Farewell
Nothing remains the same
Farewell
The wind breathes the flame

Newborn relations are growing
The unknown conquers the safe
To taste ramble without any dwell
At the end of the line

Welcome Farewell
