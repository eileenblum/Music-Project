Shattered windows
Curtains ripped
Roughed walls
The colour faded
Beyond its prime
With wood walls rotten
This fallen temple
A life forgotten

The reap
Nothing is to last
Harvester of death
Reclaim the past

This forsaken place
Crumbling away
Once filled with life
Now yielded into decay
Felled by the forces of nature
Into ruins it has gone
A lifeline at the end of its journey
Silence after the storm
