From the narrow fields strangled by mountains
The river flow into the sea
From the sea I set sail

Drifting into obscurity
With the moon as a fire at night
Through darkness I ramble
Falling into endless holes

Signing up with the devil
Foreign paths to be walked

New flavours to be devoured
Always silver lining at the end of the horizon
The unknown endless power

Shadows of the past get weaker by the hour
Yet the ghosts of my life never have felt stronger
Home is forever and it is as though I never disappeared
I am always gone yet I am always here
