Hissing sounds
From a cleft tongue
A vexed sinister creation
Sliding slowly from side to side
In the shadow of vegetation

The way of the serpant
Coiled to defeat
The way of the serpant
The circle is complete

With spiteful intentions
Ready to cowardly attack
Blending with the background
Lurking behind the back
Sneaking up without a sound

From the deepest hole in the ground
Staring deep into its eyes

As the fangs flash
And spike the flesh
Filled with pain and numbness
Venomous saliva deaths caress
