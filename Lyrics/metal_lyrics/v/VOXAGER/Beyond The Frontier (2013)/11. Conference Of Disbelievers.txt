[Brennan:]
Now look at this planet
It seems almost like home
Oceans and sky
A well-known blue

I have just arrived
Events unfold so fast
They faked my destruction
And then hid me from my enemies

So they are human, we are of kin
And yet they mistrust my words
Always questioning my honesty

[Crew:]
Liar! Forger! Imposter! Deceiver!

[Disbeliever:]
No, we don't believe you
Planet Earth is just a myth
The origin of life lies here with us

[Brennan:]
You're wrong!

[Disbeliever:]
Why do you try to fool us?
Tell us where you're really from
We saved your life, how can you lie to us?

[Brennan:]
I don't!

Rescued by disbelievers.

I present the facts
The files, the pictures, the lore
My memories of Earth and
Offer them genetic proof

Some start to consider
Some remain unconvinced
They still think I'm a liar
Keep on questioning my honesty

[Crew:]
Liar! Forger! Imposter! Deceiver!

[Disbeliever:]
No, we don't believe you
Planet Earth is just a myth
The origin of life lies here with us

[Brennan:]
You're wrong!

[Disbeliever:]
Why do you try to fool us?
Tell us where you're really from
We saved your life, how can you lie to us?

[Brennan:]
I don't!

[Disbeliever:]
War is coming closer, if you are who you claim to be
You should be here helping us to win the fight

[Brennan:]
I will

[Disbeliever:]
So, you will risk your life in order to prove your point
Are you willing to prove that we really are of kin?

[Brennan:]
I am!
