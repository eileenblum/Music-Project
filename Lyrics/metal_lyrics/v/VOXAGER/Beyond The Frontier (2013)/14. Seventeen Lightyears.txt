[Narrator:]
Sometimes you'll feel the strangest longing
An urge to travel to the farthest reaches of your world
Hoping to find what's closest to your heart
Soemtimes, however, just upon arrival
You may find that the answer to your quest
Has been inside of you
All along

[Brennan:]
I need to go for a walk
I need to take a break
To be on my own
For a little while
Just to catch my thoughts
They are racing away
Going everywhere

This madness goes way to far
I ought to call it quits
No matter what they say
This is not my world
And it's not my war
I should go away
But they know I won't

So I am down at the beach
Where I walk by the waves
The ocean is so blue
Reminds me of my home
But it ain't the Earth
I am so far away
Very far offshore

I have no way to be sure
If they'll search for me
Or think that I am dead
I might never know
If they back on Earth
Have spoken my funeral eulogy

[Crew:]
He is coming from afar
He is our warrior-messiah!
Oh Messiah!

[Brennan:]
Alright, I need to get back into the city...
Gee, what's going on here
Why are all those folks... brawling?
Three-Eyes, Split and Humans,
And some Boron, too
In a semi-circle
Are they watching
Something new?

Three-Eyes, Split and Humans, and some Lizards, too
What are they all watching
I really would like to know!
Cutting through the circle
Pushing into the lines
I see two people fighting
Can I really trust my eyes?

There's a woman that can't possibly be here,
I know her well
As I recognize her face
My jaw starts dropping to the floor

One of the people over there fighting
Looks like a woman that I should know?!
I must be dreaming, I can't believe it
How can it be, it's Elena Kho!?

One of the people over there fighting
Looks like a woman that I should know?!
I must be dreaming, I can't believe it
How can it be, it's Elena Kho!?

[Ninu:]
Seventeen lightyears from home
This is where he's coming from! For us!

[Kho:]
The Getsufune is down
She's sunken to the ground
Of the ocean depths
And with her our hopes
Of returning home
For better or for worse
Truly ran aground

[Crew:]
He is coming from afar
He is our warrior-messiah!
Oh Messiah!
