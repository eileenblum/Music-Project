[Ninu Gardna:]
If I should name one thing I learned in space
It'd be my changed perspective on the human race
It's true

At first I thought my message would bring peace
Forgive me that I thought it would change anything
I had no idea

Whatever it was that I thought was true
It haunted me a million years until I came undone
The very day I laid my eyes upon his face

If there is love in outer space
There may be hope for the human race
A beating heart defies a machine's
Cold embrace

But those dreams
May never come alive
For me

If there was love in outer space
There might be hope for the human race...

[Patriarch:]
Envoy, you will have to save
The alien craft from self-destruct!

[Paranid:]
The anomalous object is ours to salvage
Unholy creatures, be on your way!

[Crew:]
He's diving through a solar flare!

[Paranid:]
We can't get there in due time!
Two-eyed creatures, will you help?

[Patriarch:]
We can't get there, either, now
All is lost, and that is how...

[Crew:]
He's diving through a solar flare!

[Ninu:]
The Aladna Hill
Is adrift
At the gate
We must wait

Will he live?
Will he die?
Will this play
Save his life?

[Brennan:]
Will I die?

[Ninu:]
He has barely escaped solar flares

[Brennan:]
Will I live?

[Ninu:]
Let's hope that he has guessed our plan

[Brennan:]
Will this play...

[Ninu:]
The Aladna stands still at the gate

[Brennan:]
Save my life?

[Ninu:]
They should now think he's dead....

If there's love in outer space
There may be hope for the human race
A beating heart defies a machine's
Cold embrace
