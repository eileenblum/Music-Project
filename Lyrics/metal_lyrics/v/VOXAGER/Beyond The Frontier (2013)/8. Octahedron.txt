[Nopileos:]
I have been exiled from my world by my own kind
I was told never to return unless I changed my mind
They gave me this fine ship and sent me upon my way
To the Queendom of Boron to fetch back that prey

I was told that I must right what was wronged
Though what they think is wrong to me seems right
I really love them, believe me I do
But even for love's sake, I won't comply

[Onboard computer / Nopileos:]
She's on a mission now â I don't want to go
Towards the Boron race â And they need not known
Her elders want to trace â Where I intend to land
Every move she makes â Instead

[Nopileos:]
Before I go anywhere else
I will fly to the trading wheel and
See if they allow me to land
But hey! What comes here?

[Cho:]
Give way!

[Nopileos:]
I don't think that I will!

[Cho:]
Make room!

[Nopileos:]
Who do you think you are?

[Cho:]
I'm Cho! The patriarch's envoy!

[Nopileos:]
So what? I couldn't care less

[Cho:]
Give way, or I will crush you

[Nopileos:]
I don't think that you even can...

[Cho:]
I can, and I'm ready to prove it

[Nopileos:]
Says you! But I'm not giving way...

[Cho:]
We'll see about that, little lizard.

[Nopileos:]
Why is his warship crossing over
Through the trajectory assigned to me?
Maybe he thinks I'm a pushover
That guy's in for his greatest surprise

[Cho:]
Arrrgh! I will make you pay for this!

[Nopileos:]
Afraid I've not exactly made a new friend
In fact, I think a foe for life was born...

I'm strolling down the hallways aboard the trading wheel
With my mind full of new impressions and an awesome deal
Without a warning, as I'm looking up, someone knocks me down
That guy from the warship! It seems now he has me found...

[Cho:]
Give way!

[Nopileos:]
I don't think that I will!

[Cho:]
Make room!

[Nopileos:]
Who do you think you are?

[Cho:]
I'm Cho! The patriarch's envoy!

[Nopileos:]
So what? I couldn't care less

[Cho:]
Give way, or I will crush you

[Nopileos:]
I don't think that you even can...

[Cho:]
I can, and I'm ready to prove it

[Nopileos:]
Says you! But I'm not giving way...

[Cho:]
Aaaagh!

[Paranid:]
Envoy! Let the unholy creature go!

[Cho:]
No!

[Paranid:]
It'll only cause a stir if you kill it right here!

[Cho:]
Aaaagh! We will meet again!

[Nopileos:]
Not particularly fond of the Paranid.
But this one is heaven sent!
