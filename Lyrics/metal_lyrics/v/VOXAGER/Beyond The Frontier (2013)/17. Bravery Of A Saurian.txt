[Kho:]
She was a friend of mine
She was unlike anyone I ever knew
She gave her life for us
And never hesitated
Her bravery needs to be told...

She shouldn't be there then
On this wounded world
But then there she was anyway

She came to rescue us
In her own brave ways
And she left no doubts

[Brennan:]
We saw her falling down
From the clear blue skies
Like a burning meteorite
We saw her her climbing down
From the dark blue skies
And with no disguise

[Nopileos:]
I know
I had it coming for a long, long time
And now it's here,
I don't know what to do...

[Brennan:]
Her ship was ill-equipped
And at first it looked
Like she never would stand a chance
It became obvious soon
That she tried to steer
Her ship into his

[Kho:]
She stemmed the bow of her
Little egg-shaped boat
Into the belly of his craft

Lightning across the sky
Debris was burning and
Raining to the ground

[Nopileos:]
I know
I had it coming for a long, long time
And now it's here,
I don't know what to do
I know
That I was asking for it
All the time
Now it's here
It caught me by surprise

[Cho:]
This time
You won't escape me
This time
I'll bring you down!
This time
You won't escape me,
No! This time, I'll bring you down!
This time
You won't escape me
No! This time, I'll bring you down!

[Nopileos:]
I know
That I was asking for it
All the time
Now it's here
It caught me by surprise

[Kho:]
She was a friend of ours
She was unlike anyone we ever knew
She gave her life for us
And never hesitated
Her bravery needs to be told...

[Nopileos:]
But I'm not dead!
