[Ninu:]
And I need to get back to my world
before the war begins

[Patriach:]
Envoy, this ship is called Aladna Hill.
It hid Brennan and stole him from us.
His slave woman is on that ship.
Capture the Aladna Hill and bring her to my planet...

[Cho:]
You sided with a foe
I need his information
I'll have to torture you
To make sure that you don't lie

Don't try to run from me
Cause you know I will outrun you
I swear I'll spare your life
If you just answer my call

You must surrender now
To fight is not an option
I will destroy your ship
If you don't give in to me
At once

[Ninu:]
We will not do
As we are told
We need to try
To get away

[Pilot:]
But we can't fight!
He is just right!

[Cho:]
Destruction!
Surrender!
Destruction!
Surrender

Or I'll
crush you n' blow your pieces
to the
void

[Cho / Ninu:]
Stop to resist / We will not stop
I swear that it won't hurt / to resist
Give in to me / We will not give
Cause I mean you no harm / in to you

Just cease the fight / We will not stop
I swear that it won't hurt / to resist
Give in to me / We will not give
I want to cause you pain! / in to you

Destruction!
Surrender!
Destruction!
Surrender

Or I'll
crush you n' blow your pieces
to the
void

You sided with a foe
I need his information
I'll have to torture you
To make sure that you don't lie

Don't try to run from me
Cause you know I will outrun you
I swear I'll spare your life
If you just answer my call

You must surrender now
To fight is not an option
I will destroy you all
If you don't give in to me now!

[Ninu:]
Help us! Somebody help! Somebody help us!
Help! Somebody please! Help! Help!
Somebody... please! Help us!
