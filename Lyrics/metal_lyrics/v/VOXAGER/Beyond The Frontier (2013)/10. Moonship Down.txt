[Kho:]
Dropping out of hyperspace
Should have found a barren place
But it ain't barren here at all

But why?

Alien spaceships come and go
Two giant stations in a row

Getsufune
Trusty moonship
While your engines
Took me here
Will they take us back?

So it seems they're unaware
That I didn't come from here
Giving me time to look around

Then a clever lizard girl
Finds me out, but we make friends

Getsufune
Trusty moonship
Shut your blinds
Don't let news in
Just for a while

[Nopileos:]
My poor Elena
Your friend Brennan
I heard about him
I'm afraid he's dead
He died in a solar flare

[Kho:]
So there's nothing left for me to do
Now the time for me has come
I have to go back where it all began
Take me home [3x]

Jumping into hyperspace
Really need to leave this place
I have to make it back to Earth

See the blue world down below
But suddenly, I feel a jolt...

Getsufune
Trusty moonship
Engines failing
Going down...
We're going down

We're going down!

There's no salt...
That's not Earth.
