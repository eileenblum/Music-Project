[Narrator:]
When the smoke from the battle has set
When the bodies of friends and comrades have been counted
Don't you dare look for traces of tears
In the dusk on my face
I am a warrior
I will never cry

[Kho:]
Now he passed away
He died alone so far from home
I feel the grief And wish I could cry
But I just can't.

For he was a warrior
Not once did he cry
Whenever the pain hit hard
He just shrugged it away

I, too, am a warrior
I swore not to cry
The tears that you think you saw
Were a trick of the light

He was my dearest friend
We went through thick and thin
Still recall the day we met
And the words he said:

[Brennan (flashback):]
Aren't we a little green behind the ears for a job like that?

[Kho (flashback):]
Don't know about you, sir, but I'm a trained fighter,
I'm perfect for the job!

[Kho:]
I was audacious as a girl, so many years ago...
His sense of humor and
The kindness of his heart
Will forever grace my life
They're a part of me
They've become a part of who I am today!

I need to stop to grieve and get on my way
To finish Brennan's work
What would he have done?

Now that I crashed upon a planet unknown
I'll have to find out who's in charge of this world!
I need to stop to grieve and get on my way
To finish Brennan's work
But I won't forget

I may not cry, but as someone who's so dear to me
He'll always live on through my actions and words
Tears I may not cry
But still I feel the pain

Tears I may not cry
But still I feel the pain
