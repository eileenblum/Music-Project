[Nepileos / Sissandras:]
Oh, I know we are too young to see
Through the haze of history....
That's what they've taught us
I'm no fool,
I know they are afraid
That one day someone
Will unravel the whole truth:

Ambition and grace
Lie buried beneath
Our scales
And lie dormant
For us to find...

[Chorus:]
Wheel in space, wheel in space,
Gonna find my wheel in space!
Wheel in space, wheel in space,
Gonna ride that wheel in space!

Well, I know no one would understand
When we took that plane and went absent without leave
Neither profits nor gain did I seek
But the wheel in space spurred my imagination

Ambition and grace
Lie buried beneath
Our scales
And lie dormant
For us to find

Sister, dear
Don't you know 'bout the law
'Coz we're not permitted
To keep what we've found

Sister, dear,
I know all 'bout the law
Yet the Queendom of Boron
May harbor our find

Little did I know what we would find
In that hidden place I was given as a gift
Had I known what was waiting for us
I'd have done the same and without hesitation

Ambition and grace
Lie buried beneath
Our scales
And lie dormant
For us to find

[Chorus 3x]
