[Narrator:]
It suddenly struck me that
That tiny pea, pretty and blue
Was the Earth
I put up my thumb and shut one eye
And my thumb blocked out the planet Earth
I didn't feel like a giant
I felt very, very small.

[Ninu:]
He, he was born to be our hero
The Saviour of our world
He was born to be messiah
The harbinger of light
He used to be a stranger
Coming from afar
He used to be in danger

[Brennan:]
I never chose to be your hero
The saviour of your world
Never chose to be messiah
The harbinger of light

I used to be a stranger
Coming from afar
I used to be in danger

[Boron:]
Innocence!

[Cho:]
Violence!

[Boron:]
But... innocence!

[Cho:]
Violence!

[Boron:]
We don't like violence
Fading of innocence
But there's no other chance
This all will end in violence

[Cho:]
Violence! Violence!

[Brennan:]
They fit my spaceship with an anti-matter bomb
They built it from the scans that they gathered of my ship
They want me to deliver into the machines realm
I am their only hope, that's what I heard them say

[Nopileos:]
Never look in the mirror
Never search in your soul
All you'll find is confusion
There's always someone
Waiting for you

They are my only friends
Someone must rescue them
They can rely on me
That's how it'll always be

Never look in the mirror
Never search in your soul
All you'll find is confusion
There's always someone
Praying for you

They can rely on me
That's how it'll always be
They are my only friends
Someone must rescue them
That would be me, then...

[Brennan:]
Deep behind the lines of the machines
There's little hope
They steal the energy away
They try and they succeed

Behind the lines of the machines
A glimpse of hope
Now that the energy returns
I release the bomb

[Kho:]
He never chose to be your hero
The savior of your world
Never chose to be messiah
The harbinger of light

He used to be a stranger
Coming from afar
He used to be in danger

[Brennan:]
I never chose to be your hero
The saviour of your world
Never chose to be messiah
The harbinger of light

I used to be a stranger
Coming from afar
I used to be in danger

[Patriach:]
Envoy! Brennan has defeated the machines.
And now he's on his way to my planet!
He's trying to free his slave women.
This is your final chance.
Bring me his ship, and kill them all
Or kill yourself trying...

[Brennan:]
I'm on the planet of the patriarch
Threatening to destroy his entire world
He won't believe me
But he has to play it safe
He lets me free my friends
Then he pretends to let us go

[Cho:]
No! Don't let them go!
They can't escape me!
No! Don't let them go!
I will destroy them!
No! Don't let them go!

[Nopileos:]
Never look in the mirror
Never search in your soul
All you'll find is confusion
There's always someone
Preying on you...
