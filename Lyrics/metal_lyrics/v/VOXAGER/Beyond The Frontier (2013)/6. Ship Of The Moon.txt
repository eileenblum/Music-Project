[Narrator:]
A great man once wrote
That if you call a rose by any other other name
It'll still remain a rose.
So, if this is true,
will not a friend called by any other name
still be a friend?
And what is with a ship that has no sail but carries
you to the stars on a beam of light.
Isn't it a ship... nevertheless?

[Kho:]
I sit here all alone
Staring at the waves
Pretending to be at rest
While the calmness I display is just a facade

I wish a storm would come
To sweep away the peace
To cover for the turmoil inside
That never ceases; it's tearing me apart

I'm strolling through the streets
Of a city at sundown
The sky is bleeding red
While ignorance blesses those who will not see

So it is me who sees
I know what must be done
I'll have to seek the oceans of starlight
And don't expect me to ever turn around

Whatever it takes
I'll never look back
There will be an answer on the path that lies ahead

[Chorus]
Will we find the answers
To questions not yet asked
Will we see the future
From far above
Or will we stay
Bound in time?
The sunlight, the moonlight
That shines within my soul
It shall not desert me
While I'm away
I'm not astray
Getsufune

Another day has come
I'm far above the Earth
It never quite felt like home
Now I'm staring at the void and I'm relieved

This could be my last day
Well, I am not afraid
As the ship is gathering away
I realize that the turmoil stays behind

[Chorus]
