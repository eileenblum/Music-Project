[Narrator:]
You try to fill the emptiness with yourself
And in turn, the emptiness fills you.
So, to you, what's freedom and what's captivity?
Why is it that you feel so free while your heart is bound?
And why does its latitude feel like
Imprisonment?

[Patriarch:]
Where is he coming from?
Where is he going to?
How is it possible
That he escaped again?

[Paranid:]
We have no answers
To the questions that you ask
We will refrain from fighting
And we must oppose

[Patriarch:]
We have to get a hold
Of his foreign machine
He is in our realm
So he belongs to us

[Paranid:]
Religious superstition
Geometrical abstraction
A Paranid invasion
Mystery extraction
Soon!

[Chorus â Brennan]:
Why is everyone chasing me (they're chasing me down)
Why can't they seem to get a hold (they should be getting hold of me!)
Am I dreaming, am I awake (I don't think I'm awake)
How long is this going to take? (When will I wake up again?)

[Patriarch:]
From our realm
To lizard space
We will hunt
And bring him down

[Paranid:]
Oh no, my friend
You must escape
Because otherwise
They will torture you

The anomalous object
Tries to escape us
But god will help
Our master plan

[Brennan:]
Will they shoot me
And with what?
Who can I trust
And who not?

[Brennan (chorus)]

[Paranid:]
The anomlous object once again
Has escaped Paranid grasp
We regret having to inform our
Unholy allies that
We were unable to procure it
For further examination

[Brennan:]
I don't understand their actions
Judging by these interactions
One thing, though, seems clear to me
There's green and there's gold

[Patriach:]
Greed and gold!

[Brennan:]
I don't understand their actions
Judging by these interactions
One thing, though, seems clear to me
There's green and there's gold
