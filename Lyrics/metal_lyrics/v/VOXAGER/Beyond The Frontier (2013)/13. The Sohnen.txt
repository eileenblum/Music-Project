[The Sohnen:]
Floating here in space
Exhiled by her own race
This lizard hatchling
Takes no part in it

In hatred and mischief
Nor murderous beliefs,
Nor greed for profits
Or malicious acts

Can we reach her
We must teach her
Of a canon that is
Never to be breached

The existence of a mind
Is unconnectred to the kind
Of substrate that
Breathes life to it

In silicon or flesh
Awareness my arise
A strangeness that may leave you
Unprepared

So don't extinguish
Learn its language
Start to realize
We may depend on it

[Chorus (Background / Nopileos):]
Don't extinguish them, can't you see? (Can't you see?)
There's consciousness in your enemy (Your enemy!)
They're more than machines, they are alive (They're alive!)
Don't give in to genocide (No genocide!)

[Nopileos:]
Floating here in space
My mind still in a daze
The Sohnen surely think
That I'm the one

To understand their call
Take their message to them all
And try to make it known to everyone

[Computer:]
Do I need to spell it out?

[Nopileos:]
Please don't

[Computer:]
Do I have to speak aloud?

[Nopileos:]
Please don't

[Computer:]
You're not an ambassador

[Nopileos:]
I know

[Computer:]
You don't speak for them at all!

[Nopileos:]
Don't know...

[Computer:]
Profit is your only goal

[Nopileos:]
Not true!

[Computer:]
Keep the message to yourself

[Nopileos:]
I won't

[Computer:]
I will have to turn you in

[Nopileos:]
Ssssss!
This is important.
This must be made known!

[Chorus]
