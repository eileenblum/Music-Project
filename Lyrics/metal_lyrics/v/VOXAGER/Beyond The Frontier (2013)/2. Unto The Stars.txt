[Brennan:]
Velvet darkness stretching
Over an infinity of void
I'm spellbound by that blue-white marble
That used to be my home

And on my phones
That cheerful voice
I've come to trust

[Kho (chorus):]
Farewell, farewell
Fare unto the stars
How I wish I could come along
Come back, come back
Come home to our world
To show us the way to the fortunes beyond

[Brennan:]
They tucked me in this casket
Made of metal alloy blends
Attached it to an engine
That will hurl me to outer space

As I tear my gaze
Away from Earth
Time's counting down

[Command:]
Twenty seconds, guidance alert
The guidance system now going internal
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8...
Ignition sequence start
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0... lift-off

[Chorus 2x]

[Brennan:]
Suddenly a siren screeching
Something's going wrong
All the lights are turning red
As I am yanked back
Pressure's building on my chest
So hard I cannot breathe
I see a ring of light appear

Tugging on my guts I feel a
Metal giant's hand
Pulling me towards something
I've never seen before

Crackling static's on my phones
The voices disappear
Somebody screams in fear

[Kho:]
Abort! There's something wrong!
When suddenly my friend and ship are gone...

[Brennan:]
See the jumpdrive engine
Breaking right apart from me
Lightning striking, fire burning
What's happening to me?
Noises rising everywhere
The ship is torn apart
I'm afraid it's breaking up

All the machines turning dead
Computers going down
Redundancy is all for naught
Can it really be?

A ghastly whirl of energy
A vortex without ground
It's hammering inside my mind
My consciousness gone...

[Kho:]
Farewell, my friend,
Fare unto the stars
I trust that you'll be safe and sound
Farewell, and know that I hold you dear
And that we will meet once again
Yes, soon we shall meet once again
