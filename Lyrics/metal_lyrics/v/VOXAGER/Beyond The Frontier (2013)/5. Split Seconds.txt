[Patriach:]
The alien ship has now entered our territory
I'm ordering you to pursue it, regardless of where it's heading
You will follow it, even it will take you outside our realm
And under no circumstances are you going to attack it
Or even return fire

I'm always right...
I win every fight...
I bring the light...

[Cho:]
He sends me into the brink of space
To carry out his useless chase
I'd rather fight until I die
But I'm his slave
I'm the patriarch's envoy

My battleship's prepared to fight
My crew can tell what's wrong from right
Yet how can I explain to them
That they must wait
Because I'm the patriarch's envoy

[Chorus 2x:]
[Crew:] You don't know what's wrong from right
[Patriarch:] I'm always right
[Crew:] You cannot win this fight
[Patriarch:] I win every fight
[Crew:] You'll never see the light
[Patriarch:] I bring the light
[Crew:] You bring the light of hate to our souls

[Cho:]
They'd rather shoot dead lizards and
Love to slaughter Borons on first sight
Destroying everything that turns their way

Instead I have to calm them down
Have to put up their constant frown
The worst thing is I fully empathize

[Patriarch:]
I never thought my subjects
They would hate me oh so dear
But hatred fosters violence
That's why I like to see them there

Friends and foes across my realm
I know they fear me like a plague
Because I'll bring to them my sword and reign
They'll either die or they must subdue

[Chorus]
