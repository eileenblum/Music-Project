Abort mission, abort mission

Abort mission!

[Brennan:]
Well, I'm waking up from unconsiousness
There's somebody calling my name
The ship is adrift in the black of the void
And it's leaking my air

All of a sudden I realize
That something is awfully wrong
The engines are dead
No connection to Earth
The coldness of space creeping in

I'm getting ready to leave the ship
To look at the damage outside
The stars far above unfamiliar and strange
It dawns on me: I'm alone

I manage to patch up the leaking parts
And bring the ship's systems online
While I'm heading back, something's catching my eye
In the distance a bright light appears

I quickly need to get aboard
So I can take a closer look
At what can only be a dream
Of my violated mind

Is this a ship of unknown kind?
Unknown to anyone on Earth?
I know that it should not exist
Am I awake or still asleep?

'Coz I've been told for all my life
That humankind is all alone
The depths of space should be our own

But here they come, larger than life
They slow their ship, turn it around
Then slowly open up its bow

The ship simply swallows me
As I sit back unbelievingly

[Background:]
Are you sure you're really here?
How can you be so sure?

[Brennan:]
But how can it be?
It seems so... it seems so unearthly

[Background:]
Are you sure you're really here?
How can you be so sure?

[Brennan:]
Could this be all
Just a feverish dream?
Somebody's testing me...

They're three staring back at me
When hesitantly I'm climbing off my ship
They're dangerous and strange at once
They look like they're saurians or lizards
Or some sort of thing

Days go by, then I find out
That humans aren't alien to them
They want me to pay them for
Reparing my ship and for bringing its engine online

They urge me back aboard my ship
Apparently they're under fire
Some other race thinks I'm the prize

They toss me out into the void
Black fighter crafts tailgating me
Well should I run or should I fight?
