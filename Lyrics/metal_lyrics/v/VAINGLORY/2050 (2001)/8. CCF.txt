They march ever night and day
And they feel, so very proud
They do their job with no remorse
As their fathers once did as well
The Citizen Containment Force
They know not what they do

They are the law, it's what we're taught
As long as we can recall
It's an honor, to be part of the force
The gallant CCF, is given its due
The Citizen Containment Force
They know not what they do
Blindly following history
Not knowing the birth of misery

All shall serve two years to life
Do your job well and be released
No one seems to know the truth
Their world is only what they're told

You can't refuse you must abide it is required to conform
Resist and you will die execution awaits always near by
The Citizen Containment Force they know not what they do
Forgive them, they know not what they do
