We say our goodbyes tearful as they may
We can't return, even from this day
To our final home we shall ever stay
So glorious, is all that they say
We board the train to the promised land
We've worked so hard, always on demand
To our rewards for our sacrifice
Blood, sweat, and tears has been our life

Take me home, to paradise
Where the seas move into light
Take me home to paradise
Where the days move into night

As sad as it seems, with families no more
We will now see, the old ones before
Surely they will be, younger in age
As we were told, from the master sage

Take me home to paradise
Take me home to paradise

On and on the train moves on and then we do arrive
The place is so barren cold nothing like it's told
An army of CCF wait by the doors
Then they march us one by one till there is no more

Take me home, take me home, take me home to paradise
Take me home, take me home, take me home to paradise
