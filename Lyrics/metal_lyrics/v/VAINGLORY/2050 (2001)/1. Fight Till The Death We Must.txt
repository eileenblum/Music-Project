The CCF is knocking at my door as we speak
They are looking for me as I take sleep
But I'm no fool as I move from place to place
They will not ever fine me, I left not a trace

Will they give me my life, will they admit the wrong
Will we ever live, will we ever belong

We are united in our common cause
We will not be turned back or deterred
Many have fallen for our final goal
I must go on, spreading out our word

Will they give me my life, will they admit the wrong
Will we ever live, will we ever belong

Fight! Till the death we must, until we break free
Fight! Till the death we must, it is agreed
Fight! Till the death we must, put trust in force
Fight! Till the death we must, it's now or never

I never knew what freedom cost

Fight! Till the death, Fight! Till the death
Until we break free, Fight! Till the death
It's now or never
