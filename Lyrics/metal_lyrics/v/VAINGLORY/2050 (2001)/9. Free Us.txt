We read of freedom in the books from long ago
Justice prevailed then this is what we know
It may take a long time before our final stand
It may take a lifetime before they understand

Freedom, free us, take the shackles let us be united
Free us, let us walk the streets now undenied

We have been fooled for years the old ones told it so
They recalled yesterday from tales they had been told
They hide inside the caves deep within the faults
We must listen now to their straight wise thoughts

Freedom, free us, take the shackles let us be united
Free us, let us walk the streets now undenied

Please free us I am still a man
Please free us now you will understand

You count your dirty money each and every night
As we sweat in the fields our life just isn't right
All your wealth may buy things that you seek
Once it's over and we're strong you'll face defeat

Freedom, free us, take the shackles let us be united
Free us, let us walk the streets now undenied
Free us, remove the shackles!
Free us!!! Freedom for all!
