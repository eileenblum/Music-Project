We've circled the mountains, we've touched the sky
We've seen the ways on the other side
We've seen their oceans, and their deep blue seas
We'll reach their heaven or we will surely die

We are the soldiers of the Lost And Found
We are the warriors living underground

Every day we live, at our own expense
We make them richer than one should ever be
We sweat the hours and the days away
They count their billions in the land of greed

We are the soldiers of the Lost And Found
We are the warriors living underground

Look into your heart and seek out the truth
Don't believe the words that you learned from in school
Even if they tell you don't really know
Pass on the words of our gallant few
It will take a war that we will probably lose
Better die a man than a thousand mindless fools
We hide in the shadows and we are on the go
Listen for our signal, and carry it on through

We are the soldiers of the Lost And Found
We are the warriors living underground

We are, the martyrs, and the only one chance
We will, never surrender, to the last man we die
Maybe, we will never know, the freedom that we dream
We shall, forever search, or dying we will try

The Lost and Found, The Lost and Found
