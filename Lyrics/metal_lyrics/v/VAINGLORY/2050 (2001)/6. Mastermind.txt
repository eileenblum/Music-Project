From the first day of your life you are drugged
In the water or any liquid you might drink
We don't know when it started for sure
It controls the means to what you may think

Mastermind, to suppress the masses
Mastermind, it kills your drive
Mastermind, no one seems to know
Mastermind, until 65

Long ago, in time they discovered a way, they say
To keep us in, our place it seems forevermore and more
We never knew what the change was deep in our souls, so deep
All we knew was that we had no desire to fight, or change

They stole our minds
Nothing seems real
They took our memories
They destroyed our will
They killed our will

Mastermind, to suppress the masses
Mastermind, it kills your drive
Mastermind, no one seems to know
Mastermind, until 65
