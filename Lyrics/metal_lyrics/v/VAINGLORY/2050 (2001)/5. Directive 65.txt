All through life, we're taught it's the law
All through life, we're told it's because
To another land, we all must pass
We're taught it's heaven, a reward for our tasks
All the day, the honor will commence
Graduating, it was the event

We must move on, the force we can't deny
We are the victims of Directive 65
Even now we come, believing the big lie
We are the victims of Directive 65

Three score and five, marks the great age
They met at the stations, for the final stage
We suspect now, that the aged all will die
It's just the plan, our production must thrive

We must move on, the force we can't deny
We are the victims of Directive 65
Even now we come, believing the big lie
We are the victims of Directive 65

We are the victims of the lie
The victims of Directive 65
No, we can't deny
We are, we are the victims of Directive 65
