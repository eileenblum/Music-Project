[M/L: Jevo]

We sailed the North Sea up and down
Spreading norman piracy
Searching for conquest and for loot
Reached the Mediterranean sea

Reckless and daring vikings
Pirates of northern lands
Searching for gold and treasures
Wild men of war

Side by side - by means of hard axe blows
One by one - they fell to the ground
Side by side - with swords strokes and arrows
One by one - to die suffering were they bound

Founding reigns in Irish lands
Up the Seine we took Paris
The wrath of Odin did we bring
Burning towns from France to Greece

By drakkars crossed the oceans
Boarding warships and boats
Inland we raped and plundered
Thirsty for blood

Side by side - with power of Norsemen
One by one - their ships did we burn
Side by side - we sailed up the rivers
One by one - destroying the towns we found
