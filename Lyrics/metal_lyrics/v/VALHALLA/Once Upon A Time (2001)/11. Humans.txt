[M/L: Jevo]

I came from the stars on a mission to find
A place for a colony somewhere to live
But the influence of humans
Wasted all hopes for my race.

Carbon dioxide is blackening your lungs
Chemical warfares, pollution we breathe
There's a leak in a nuclear station
That no one controls.

Humans - Wasting the Earth
Destroyers - Heading for Death

Time has come for this fading planet
Straight to darkness
This is the beginning of the End.
I must go back where I belong to
Far from here and
Leave this pigsty world that you call Earth.

Black tides on the oceans, all sealife is dead.
Decreasing the ozone, the greenhouse effect
Warms the crust of the Earth
Drying rivers and melting the poles.

Look at the menu you taste everyday
Uranium-full salad, pork chops with aphta,
Crazy roast beef on the grill
And fresh three-eyed fish.

Humans - Wasting the Earth
Destroyers - Heading for Death

All I see now is a cancer in this world
Your fate is sorrow and doom.
No turning back, my predictions will fulfil
There`s nothing that we can do.

Centuries ago, many centuries before your birthday
I found a planet with perfect conditions of life.
But everything was spoilt by a plague of humans
Now that my mission is done, I want to go home.
