[M/L: Jevo]

From the guts of Metal we were born
Steel and Fire in our hearts
Proud we stand against the wind and storm
No one can stop our rage.

I see the armies of Metalians
Wielding their hammers in the air
The clash will make Earth tremble
You will hear the screams
Of Victory!

Raise high your fist
All together in a voice
United we stand, not alone
With Power and Might
We will show the World
That Heavy MetalÂ´s here to remain.

When we march, we never step backwards
There's only Triumph or Death
Gods of War are always on our side
And Metal keep us alive

Never give in, never surrender
Our Unity and Hate make us strong
We are less in number
But theyÂ´ll never beat us down
The flame still burns!
