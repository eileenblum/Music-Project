[M: Patxa, Jevo / L: Jevo]

Your time is up,
Listen to the bells, theyÂ´re tolling
The race against the Reaper no one wins.
Remember now
All those years of pain and pleasure
Thoughts and memories gone with the wind

One shiny light
Leads you through the darkness.
What is beyond
You will see.

Spread your wings and fly
Up to the rainbow
Fly and cross the Gates Of Paradise
The hands of time, they never rest
Ticking on and on...and on.

Leave all behind
YouÂ´ve got what you need,
Just one ticket to The Other Side.
No matter where, 
Who you are, thereÂ´s no criteria
You know time is always passing by

One shiny light
Leads you through the darkness.
What is beyond
You will see.

Join us in the eternal sleep
Take our hand we will show you
The land of the free
Welcome to the DestinyÂ´s End
Where your mind and your soul rest in peace.
