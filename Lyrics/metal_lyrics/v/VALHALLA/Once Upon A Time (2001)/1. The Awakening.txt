[M/L: Jevo]

Long time ago into the deep caves
Under the Mountains Of Hope
The Gods of Thunder 
Gathered to create a perfect being
Hammerers and forgers 
Worked together day after day
Night after night
Only they knew the secrets of steel
Finally a mighty creature was born 
Made of forged iron, fire and steel
He was the Master of all the elements
He had the gift of immortality
Thousands of descendants 
Spread all over the Universe
All his sons were made of flesh and bones 
The flame still burns 
Within their Hearts of Metal
They will never die
The Gates of Valhalla await.
