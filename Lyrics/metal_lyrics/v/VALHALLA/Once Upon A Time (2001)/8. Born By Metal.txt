[M: IvÃ¡n V., Mikel / L: IvÃ¡n V.]

Right, It has begun.
I can feel there's magic in the air.
Heavy Metal is here.
It's in you... It's in me.
Noise and show, fire and lights
We want it loud and we want it high.
Soul of Metal anew.
It's in me... It's in you.

Never!
Never debase what we have.
Never!
Never forget what we are
Heavy Metal!

By Metal I was born,
For Metal I will die.
Heavy Metal music is my life.
By Metal I was born,
For Metal I will die.
Nothing else but Metal in my mind.

Now I see there's Metal in the air.
Let me feel it...
Let me hear your scream...

By Metal I was born,
In Metal I will die.
Heavy metal music is my life.
By Metal I was born,
In Metal I will die.
Nothing but Metal tonight!
