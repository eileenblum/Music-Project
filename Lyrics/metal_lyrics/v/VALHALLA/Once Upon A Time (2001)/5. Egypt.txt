[M: Patxa, IvÃ¡n, Mikel, Jevo / L: Jevo]

In a land, close to the Nile
Surrounded by desert is Egypt.
Down below, under the sand
Lie the rest of ancient kings.

Ooh, relics and gold in their graves
Ooh, better not desecrate.

Many centuries ago
Egyptian kings
were protected by the Gods
For their Glory and Peace

In the land of pyramids
I found my doom
And the curse will follow me
For all eternity

Egypt, the legend, curse of the pharaohs
Horus, Osiris, wrath of the Gods
Suffering and Sorrow, the prophecy reveals
Egypt forgive me, the curse fulfills

Tales were told that I did ignore
About maledictions and curses
Now my soul, eternally damned
Until the End of all days

Ooh, shadows appear in my dreams
Ooh, grim visions, demons of greed

Hidden traps and labyrinths
Were not enough
And I entered the vault
To appease my greed
Hieroglyphics on the wall
Signs on the stone
Maledictions shall be cast
For whom profane the tombs
