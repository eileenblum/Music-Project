[M/L: Jevo]

Listen, IÂ´m an outlaw
Riding to live and living to ride.
Wanted for my misdeeds
Yes, I am wanted dead or alive.

Born of a wolf and a rattlesnake
Strong whisky runs through my veins
Black is my horse, like the wings of Death
As I ride through desert plains

Ride like the wind over prairies and cannyons
The reward for my headÂ´s so high
But I laugh, gallows will wait!

Trainraids, banks and ranches
Gold and dollars, I rob without rest.
Faster than my shadow
I'm the fastest gunman in the West.

Watch out your back when I'm on the run
For even the redskins fear me
Riots and women at the saloons
Playin' poker I always cheat
