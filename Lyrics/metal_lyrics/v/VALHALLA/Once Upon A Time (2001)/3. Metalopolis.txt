[M/L: Jevo]

Far from the place you live,
Away from the din.
There is a land of joy,
Amusement and spree.
Called Metalopolis, 
The town of your dreams.
Made of green grass and trees
And clear water streams.

Rivers of sweet wine
And lakes full of beer,
Delightful dishes everywhere.
All girls are gorgeous
Who you can romp with,
While birds chip metal melodies.

Come with me to a never Neverland
And you'll see
Landscapes of trees and lush.
Stay a while so we can have some fun
In this world of bliss

No fumes in the atmosphere, 
Fresh air's what you breathe,
People are really free 
And live without fear.
A place where Metal rules 
And work's not allowed.
Beer is the only God
And binge is the law.

Lightly clad women 
lying on the lawn.
Pleasantly basking in the sun
Huge amplifiers placed
along the streets
to play loud metal symphonies
