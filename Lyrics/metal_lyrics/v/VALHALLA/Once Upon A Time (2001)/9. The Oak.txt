[M/L: Jevo]

ThereÂ´s a place in the wood
Where The Oak has been there through the ages
On its bark magic runes
Written by the old wizards and witches

ItÂ´s midnight and darkness surrounds us
Thick mist is here
Wolves howl at the moon, hear them crying
Bewitchment starts

The oak will show its secret
Will-o-the-wisps will light our way
Head for the path to glory
To a place where dreams come true
Witchcraft and incantation
DonÂ´t break the spell, the charm goes on
Beyond the realms of reality
Tonight weÂ´ll cross the gates of space and time

So dark is the night
Imps, goblins and fauns dance together
Hear the wind, don't take fright
Take this potion and youÂ´ll live forever my friend

Bats, mushrooms and toads in a couldron
And you will fly
Black magic to invoke ancient spirits
They never died
