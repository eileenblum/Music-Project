[M/L: Jevo]

Voice of death is calling
I'm running through the dark
Cold is blood of power
Cold is in my heart

Heaven's waiting for me
Not ready to die
Cross the line before fear highs

Gods I will fight searching for resurrection
The end of the dream hurts like a silent scream
Now, I will fight, revenge's my own light
Here I stand, sorrow land, evil hate 'til the end

Sorrow marches through the
Mighty hands of god
Now I pray for my return

Defend what I believe 
It's my only way of life
Defending my son my own life

Resurrection gives me strength to war
To bring me home, to carry on
Resurrection heals me more and more
To fight in life
To live in shadows every night
