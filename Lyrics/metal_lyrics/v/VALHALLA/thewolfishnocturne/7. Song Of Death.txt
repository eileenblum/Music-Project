Cold... Cold... Beastial Frost...
Hunger... Death... Everyone Is Dead Of A Plague...
Night... Gloom... The Moon High Above...
In Darkness There're Heard The Moaning Of The Wind

Rocks And Woods Are Frozen To Death...
The Wind In The Sky Severes The Clouds...
The Snowstorm... The Snow Covers
Everything Around... The Blackening Moon...

The Ravens Fly High In The Nebular Sky...
Their Power Of Darkness Flows In The Winds...
The Death Is The Queen Of These Dominions...
The Wind Is The King Singing Wintry Songs...

The Cold And The Winter Are Eternal Here...
Here's No Warmth - The Sun Is Dead Here...
Iced Landscapes... Boreal Wind...
The Endless Darkness... Noone's Alive...

Cold... Cold... Frost And Plague...
Cold And Death... Wind And Fright...
Horror And Night... Darkness And Moon...
The Realm Of The Death Is Buried Under Ice...
