The Reason Is Toughly Enshrouded
The Bloody Haze Hides My Sight
A Gasping Wheezing Breathe...
I Walk Away Into The Ural Woods

I Am Entailed With The Wolf's Howl
Towards The Dark Of Forest Thicket
The Deathly-Still Beauty Of Woods Draws Me
Towards The Eternal Silence Of Heathen Realm

The Bleeding Sunset Consumes The Firmament
Like A Glowing Strip Of Steel
The Day Has Failed His Everfight To Night
The Darkness Falls Upon The Ural Woods

The Reason Is Toughly Enshrouded
The Bloody Haze Hides My Sight
A Gasping Wheezing Breathe...
I Walk Away Into The Ural Woods

Being Consumed By The Ural Darkness Into The Realm Of Night
I Disappeared In The Silence Of Woods
Leaving The Filth Of Wretched World
With The Mourning Songs Of Wolves...
