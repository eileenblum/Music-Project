Nourished With Flesh Of Cold Snowstorm
Black Bestia Being Born By Blizzard
Is Twining A Black Tracery Wreath
With A Freezing Web Of Snowy Troops

Snow-Drifts - Dwellers Of Ancient Wood-Thicket
The Frosty Palace Of A Snowy Prince
The Silverhaired Guardian - The Father Of Spiteful Blizzard
The Father Of Beauties Unseen To A man

Heil, Winterbastard - The Blackening Of The Sun
You Murder The Light While Spreading Your Wings
With A Breath Of A Frost, With The Singing Of January
You Are A Warrior Of Freezing Strength Of Zimerzla
