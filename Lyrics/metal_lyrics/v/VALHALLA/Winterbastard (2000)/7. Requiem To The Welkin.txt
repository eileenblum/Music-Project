The Sky Is Torn By The Winds
Their Blowings Sow The Death
The Reason Is Severed With
The Steel Whip Of Infernal Cold

Summoning To The Demon Of Blood
The Blackness Turns To Evilness
Growing Through The Flesh
Blood Rains Down Onto The Face
The Silent Voice Of Reaper
Pierces The Soundless Night
The Black Shadow Of Evil Is Drunk
With The Blood Of The Wind

The Music Of Darkened Valleys
Flows Like The Soundless Song
The Moon Awakes Soon
Over The Peaks Of Snowy Rocks

The Infernal Nocturne
Sounds Amidst The Silent Stones
The Spirits Of Sky Shall Play
The Requiem To The Welkin

The Dying But Mortal Sky
Is Crushed With The Steel Of The Wind...
The Dwellers Of Black Night...
The Steel Lash Of The Wind
