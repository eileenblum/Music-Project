Dances Of Sanguinous Moons
The Songs Of Soundless Mouths
The Mystery Of Ancient Runes
From The Ancient Times
The Night Consumes A Day
With A Light Of A Nocturnal Star
The Black Shadow Of Hatred
Is Radiant With Pain
The Heralds Of Evil Death
Dark Shades Of Evil
Leftovers Of Empty churches
Corpses... Ashes...
The Glowing Coal Of Eyes
Thaws Down The Reason's Ice
The Diamond Of A Black Moon
Calls You Onward Beyond The Life

The Flaming Armageddon
Thrust Onto The Night
The Devil's Daughter Rides
The Bloody Stallion
As The Omen In Silence
Summoning The Demons' Horde
Crushing Down To The Dust
The Hopes Of christian pigs

Dances Of Sanguinal Moons
In The Ruins Of Great Mountains
The Axe Of War Is Speckled With
The Mystery Of Ancient Runes
The Thick Black Shadow
Thirsts For Blood Of pigs
The Night Murders The Day
With Light Of A Nocturnal Star
