Darkness Fulfilled With Demise
Hearts Are Mortified By The Gloom
Cold That Burns The Life
Turns Eyes Into Ice

Night Is Pierced With Flame -
-With The Crimson Shining Of Lightnings
Death Sows Fright Upon Living Ones -
- Upon Bunch Of Ashen-Grey Faces

Hatred - Torment The Mind
With Spite - Hands Get Strong
Death - Enstrengthen Us
Demise - Reign Through Centuries

Scorn The Fear With Your Coldened Sight
The Granite Of Heart Get Strong With The Spite
In Frosty Darkness Of Nebular Nights
The Iced Reason Crashed By The Ravencry

The Fiery Ice Of Mountain Heart -
- Frosty Flame Of Dead Comets
The Fireshine Of Lightnings Pierces
The Oppressive Dusk Of Forsaken Woods
