[M: Jevo / L: Mikel]

There`s no place for us
There`s no way to run
We`are waiting for the future
The curse will go on
On the wings of the storm
Cold rain`s falling down
We're waiting for tomorrow
Our race will reborn

Gone with the wind
We're drowning in tears
Dark side of life
Is burning inside
But now is the time to wait for the light

Lord of the mountains
Lord of seven seas
Please hear our call
Give us force to believe
In a world in a place
With reasons to live
At the end of the rainbow`s edge

The end has begun
The moon`s turning black
We cross the line of darkness
Our soul will survive
A moment in life
With no turning back
Don`t you hear them cry?
No light shinning bright

With nothing to say
We're sealing our fate
Sadness and pain
Our hearts will remain
So strong is our faith we wait for the day

Lord of the mountains
Lord of seven seas
Please hear our call
Give us force to believe
In a world in a place
With reasons to live
At the end of the rainbow`s edge
