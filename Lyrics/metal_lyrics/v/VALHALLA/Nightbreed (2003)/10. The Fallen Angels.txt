[M/L: Jevo]

One poster on the wall
"Heaven's for sale
We have closed down"
If there's not job above
We can ask below
And join the staff.

Just void and silence in the sky
Heaven is out of fashion, let's go to Hell

We are the ones,
The Fallen Angels
We are the souls that rove your minds
We are the ones
The Fallen Angels
Sinner or Saint you will decide.

"Sorry, my winged lads,
I give you the sack,
The best of luck"
No guardian angels now
That show you the way
To the Promised Land

No job, no future in the sky
Heaven is out of fashion, let's go to Hell

We are the ones,
The Fallen Angels
We are the souls that rove your minds
We are the ones
The Fallen Angels
Sinner or Saint you will decide.

Searching for the light
You know what is wrong
And you know what is right
Searching for the light
Choose your side

We are the ones,
The Fallen Angels
We are the souls that rove your minds
We are the ones
The Fallen Angels
Sinner or Saint you will decide.
