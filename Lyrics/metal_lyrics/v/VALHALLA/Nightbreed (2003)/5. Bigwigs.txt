[M/L: Jevo]

We are members of a private brotherhood.
We control the guild of rock n'roll
Radiostations, mags and record companies
Managers and friends, so we are strong.

This is the Empire of Wirepulling
In our Reign we impose the rules
You won't succeed if we don't feel like it.

Money talks I hear the call
Money talks we hear the call
When The Mafia is in control.
Bigwigs and henchmen are tripping you up
Bleeding you white to the end.

Sorry man, there's little more that we can do
Bring your sister, we will talk again.
Money tricks and fiddles, our way of life
Kiss my ass and I will give you a chance.

This is the Empire of Wirepulling
In our Reign we impose the rules
You won't succeed if we don't feel like it.

Money talks I hear the call
Money talks we hear the call
When the Mafia is in control.
Bigwigs and henchmen are tripping you up
Bleeding you white to the end.
