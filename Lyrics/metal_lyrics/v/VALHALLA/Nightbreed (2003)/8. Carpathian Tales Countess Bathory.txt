[M/L: Jevo]

Born in Transylvannya
In the frozen Carpathian lands
Countess Elisabeth
I Surrender my soul for you
Your lesbian aunt Karla
Taught you all pleasure games
Victims yell and you smile
In an orgy of blood and lust

When night falls down
and the shadows lurk in the dark
One little girl
in a gloomy dungeon she cries.

Pleasure and pain
in your merciless game
See you in Hell
Countess Bathory
Went you insane?
Oh, my sadistic dame
See you in Hell
Countess Bathory

In league with the Devil
To find the eternal youth
Vanity drove you mad
Sacrifices for beauty lasts
Six hundred young virgins
Were slain in a crimson pool
Draining blood in a bath
Drinking blood from a golden flask

When night falls down
And the shadows lurk in the dark
One little girl
In a gloomy dungeon she cries.

Pleasure and pain
in your merciless game
See you in Hell
Countess Bathory
Went you insane?
Oh, my sadistic dame
See you in Hell
Countess Bathory
