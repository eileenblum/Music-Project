[M/L: Jevo]

Son Of Dragon, Prince of terror,
Known as Draculea
Ruler Of Wallachia,
Vlad The Impaler, you're the law.

Godless and brave,
From the craddle to the grave
Hatred I see in your eyes

Son of the Devil
Your anger we fear
The unholy rider is back.

Cry revenge, renounce Christianity
Avenge your father's death
And proclaim yourself as King
Cry revenge, bring back prosperity
Slay your enemies
And Wallachia will be free.

Impaling boyars, skinning beggars
Bury them alive
20.000 rotting turkish
Forest Of The Impaled

Defend your throne
By the fierce and cruelty
Vengeance I see in your eyes.

Son of the Devil
Your anger we fear
The unholy rider is back.

Cry revenge, renounce Christianity
Avenge your father's death
And proclaim yourself as King
Cry revnge, bring back prosperity
Slay your enemies
And Wallachia will be free.
