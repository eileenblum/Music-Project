[M/L: Jevo]

So many years working hard for a dream
Sweating blood, facing the tempest
Through Hell and high water we never rest
Until we reach our aim.
Days of misfortune and days full of joy
We won't surrender, we won't give in
Short of money but plenty of balls
We'll be on the front!

We were born to play Metal
And for Metal we'll die
One for all and all for one we cry

Break the spell, dethrone the tyrant
Now is time to scream it loud
And the day will come when victory is ours
The Rebellion will break out

Hey, bloody bastard, why don't you get out
Eat your own shit and forget us
Sooner or later you will understand
That we're not kidding at all.

We were born to play Metal
And for Metal we'll die
One for all and all for one we cry

Break the spell, dethrone the tyrant
Now is time to scream it loud
And the day will come when victory is ours
The Rebellion will break out
