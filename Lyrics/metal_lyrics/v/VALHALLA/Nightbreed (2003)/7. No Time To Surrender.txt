[M/L: Mikel]

Who`s going to fly when your wings lay in chains
Who`s going to run while you`re fading
Who`s going to see if you look through a blind eye
Never surrender I`ve got to survive

Truth, is a precious desire
Lies, a knife straight to your heart
Hate, an invisible madness
Open the gate and reveal what`s inside

Never give up, can`t stop fighting
No Surrender
Never look back, choose your side
Out in the cold evil voices sorround me
The beast seems to be... alive!

How can you see me if you don`t know where I hide
How can you live while they`re dying
How can you lie when the truth is behind you
It`s late to remember I`ll be ready to strike

Hopes, we are trapped in the abyss
Lost, as the darkness descends
Hate, with no breath or emotion
Beware of the tears running down from your face

Never give up, can`t stop fighting
No Surrender
Never look back, choose your side
Out in the cold evil voices sorround me
The beast seems to be... alive!
