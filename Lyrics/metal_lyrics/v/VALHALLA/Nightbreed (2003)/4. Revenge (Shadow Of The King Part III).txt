[M/L: Mikel]

Rain`s falling down I see the mist begins to rise
I`m coming back to spew my fire
A yearning vengance feeds my hunger every night
Just one desire burns inside my head

Closer is coming closer
A demon`s rising by my hand ready to die
Stronger I`m feeling stronger
Courageous power down from hell up to the sky

Shadowking`s still alive
Shadowking is the one
From the fire of death has returned
At the end of the light
Face to face we will fight
A new kingdom a new freedom call
Revenge has begun

Years full of silence anger misery and pain
An evil nightmare cold of darkness
A new beginning comes a place we all can go
One hope of freedom just before the storm

Higher please take me higher
I feel the thunder`s power running through my veins
Closer it`s coming close to me
I feel the battle`s fury hate`s my only friend

I`ve come back reborn by the light of the day
I`ve walked among the dead but now I`m free again
Here to bring freedom and justice for all who fight by my side
for one kingdom

King....will you follow me?
Aclaimming freedom a new better world
Strong...I will fight for you
All toghether we`ll break down the wall

Shadowking`s still alive
Shadowking is the one
From the fire of death has returned
At the end of the light
Face to face we will fight
A new kingdom a new freedom call
Revenge has begun
