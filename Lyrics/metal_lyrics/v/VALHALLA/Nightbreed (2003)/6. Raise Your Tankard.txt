[M/L: Jevo]

Take one beer, take two beers
So you can wet your whistle
Take three beers, take four beers
Now on you cannot stop
Take five beers, take six beers
Girls look like Claudia Schiffer
Seven beers, take eight beers
The bladder's ready to blow up!

In the pub, in the tavern
At any time in your life
Everywhere in the planet
Beer will always be at your side.

Raise your mug high drinking a toast
Sing all together, go on a spree!
Raise your tankard, sober or drunk
Beer will set us free.

Take nine beers, take ten beers
The friendship's exaltation
Eleven beers, take twelve beers
You've got the clues to mend the world
Thirteen beers, fourteen beers
Tongue-tied and double vision
Fifteen beers, sixteen beers
Bumping and crawling you get home

Take some beers, drink some beers
Drink'em all, you'll feel alright
Take some beers, drink some beers
Drink'em all to see the light.

Raise your mug high drinking a toast
Sing all together, go on a spree!
Raise your tankard, sober or drunk
Beer will set us free.
