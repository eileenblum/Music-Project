[M/L: Jevo]

Riding the wind with power and might
Higher than sky
Out from the dark to enter the light
Higher they fly

They've got the balls to face the storm
To face the storm

Keeping the faith of those who believe
In power of Metal
Others betrayed but they will not leave
Never this battle

They've got the balls to carry on
To carry on

Guardians of metal, your power I feel
A blend of light beams, fire, magic and steel
Thunder and lightning will crack up the sky
The Gates of Valhalla awaits

Against those whose soul and music was sold
For fame, lust and riches
Selling themselves for pieces of gold
Like luxury bitches

While others fall they carry on
The flame still burns

Guardians of metal, your power I feel
A blend of light beam, fire, magic and steel
Thunder and lightning will crack up the sky
The Gates of Valhalla awaits
