[M/L: Jevo]

Far from the place you live,
Away from the din.
There is a land of joy,
Amusement and spree.
Called Metalopolis, 
The town of your dreams.
Made of green grass and trees
And clear water streams.

Rivers of sweet wine
And lakes full of beer,
Lightly clad women everywhere
Huge amplifiers placed
along the streets
to play loud metal symphonies

Come with me to a never Neverland
And you'll see
Landscapes of trees and lush.
Stay a while so we can have some fun
In this world of bliss
