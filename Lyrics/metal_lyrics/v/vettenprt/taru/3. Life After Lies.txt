Life after lies, I didn't die, lies are all I feel
The battlefield is the all I see of those I never see
Brothers felt to the mortal sea, oh they will be free
Under shiny stars I write my final lines

Lay swords down for the glory of heroes among us
Sorrow corrupt your fate, the nemesis of hate
Turn your face to a new dawn, a day of a new born
Gather our forces, we'll never give up

Face me on the open field, I'm ready to die
Death is just a part of a life, I want to made up mine
I'm sorry for my daughter of tears, she's alone
I'll smile to my wife after this life
