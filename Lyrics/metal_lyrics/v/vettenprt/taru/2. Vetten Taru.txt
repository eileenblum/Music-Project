[Verse I "Summer &amp; Spring"]

People in here in the north
Live in a peace
Over years we will hunt,
Gather, and show our rule
Worship of gods is our oath
From ancestors
As their ancient guards
We'll ensure their fate

Wails under moon
Tell southern cruels

[Chorus]
Welcome to the land of North
Now kneel before heathen Lord
Ancient gods call us to the war
To fulfil our oath

Purity of our sky
Disgraced in the sudden night
Blood will flow in streams so long
To infertile ground

[Verse II "Ominous News &amp; Passing Day"]

So they are coming
The wind speaks of vast armies
From the south
Shiny plates of steel
Men carry the mark of the sacrificed

Winter is at the door
Keep your hands so warm
Soon we are at war

[Verse III "Arrival Threat &amp; DeathlessÂ´"]

Death has come upon us
Fear of our wrath waver fast
Lightning burst their lines
By Ukko, lament of netherworld!

MittelivÃ¤t miekkojansa,
koittelivat korttiansa
lÃ¶ipÃ¤ kerran, lÃ¶ipÃ¤ toisen
pÃ¤itÃ¤ Pohjolan poikasien.
[Kalevala]

Faith of God is their rule
They pray for sins of their cruelties
His blood and flesh gives eternal life

Numerous men have came
To conquer our chaste land
They will see it all before we'll attack

Our swords are sharp
Our fury do not lack
While they encroach on our homes you cannot turn back

LÃ¤htivÃ¤t uinumaan
Jumalat taivahan
Maasta Pohjolan
Niin tarinat kertovat

[Chorus]
