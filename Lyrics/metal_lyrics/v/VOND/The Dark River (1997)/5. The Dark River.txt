Black water runs so deep...
The shadows of my past life...
Shadows of my days of glory...
Who is that talking to me?
Who is that talking to you?

On the other side...
Of this dark river...
Seperating us...

I dream I dreamt about you...
The dark river between us...
Who did you talk to?...
What did they say to you?

The dream I dreamt about us...
The dark river seperating us...
Who was that talking to me?...
Who was that telling me...
To bury this dream and go on?

On the onther side...
Of this dark river...
Seperating us...
