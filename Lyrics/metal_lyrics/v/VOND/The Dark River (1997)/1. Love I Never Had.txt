I, cry, I, cry for you. I cry, I, cry for you,
I, cry, for the girl I never had, I, feel,
The love I thought I had, I, feel,
The love, that I had, I, feel,
The love I thought I had.
I, am alone, alone, where are you?
I, am alone, alone, where are you?
I, am alone, just like when I was with you.
I, think about you, I, think,
I, think about you, I, think,
think, about the love I never had.
