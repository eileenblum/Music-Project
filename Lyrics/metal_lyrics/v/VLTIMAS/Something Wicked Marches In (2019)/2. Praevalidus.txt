Words endowed from masters, we
No allegiance
No morals save our own
No directive save for our code
We roam in timeless
Eccentrics in our rite
We birth the empires all
Eternal is our might

Praevalidus
Since the dawn of all days
Since forever in time
Our rule, our way
Lord over, powerful
Base heredity
In excelsis omen

Praevalidus

Our mind: faith sets non free
Grim, but reality
No chance for hope in here
Pure evil is so endeared

Fortis unequivocal
Imperium untouchable
Fortis unstoppable
Chaos ohh volitional
Might stands o'er the test of all time
Our rule this is our way!

Praevalidus
Since the dawn of all days
Since forever in time
Our rule, our way
