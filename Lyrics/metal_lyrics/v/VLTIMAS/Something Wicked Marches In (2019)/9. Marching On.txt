We've conquered
All the obstacles put in our way
Forsaken
Herded away with antipathy
Our direction is clear
And we're marching onâ¦
With glory
So sure of the many battles
Await
Grave valor
We hold the power of adjudicate
Many have tried us
Many have died
And we're marching on

We're marching on
We're marching on

Those with the gift are brothers in arms
Some of us bloody but never alarmed
With honor, we prevail
Will of the centuries
Finally unveiled
Glory! Unhallowed ground
Cries of the fallen a beautiful sound
Luciferie gave us the light
Cost of all grace, wanton delight

Waiting, one more round
Listing, no more sound

We're marching on â with power and doom
Sending the sordid all to the tomb
We, the future pave a new way
Scorching defiant ones without delay
Ahhh this truth we hold dear
Delectable flavor of fear
Victors erect all others on knees
Kill kill but never appease

We're marching on
We're marching on
