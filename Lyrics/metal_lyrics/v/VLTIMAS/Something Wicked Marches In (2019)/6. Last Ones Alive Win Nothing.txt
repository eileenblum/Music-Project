We few left standing
We wade through all the waste
All carnage existence
Twixt victus, rotting haste

Ahhhhâ¦ We win nothing

These last wars succeeded
Put an end to pure greed
All kingdoms have fallen
Human â the great misdeed

Ahhhhâ¦ We win nothing

Nothing in multiples
Nothing indeed
Though I stand Invictus
Only wasteland at my feet ohâ¦
Conquest is loathsome
Another grimoire history
I'm standing, earth's bleeding
Last ones alive win nothing

Ahhhhâ¦ We win nothing

Cabals, cabals our time is here
Cabals, the stars align
Towards what shall be

Rid the world of the leeches
Wish they'll not reappear
We are together in persistence
All objections we'll not hear

Pure strength of the will turned action
To achieve what must be done
T'was a fine line led to fury
Old paradigms have been shunned

Ahhhhâ¦ We win nothing

Fear strikes the enemy's hearts
They know they haven't got long
No refuge, nowhere to hide ahhh
They made their choices and now they will pay
All accounts are settled today
Towers of babble fall to the ground ahhh

These last wars succeeded
Put an end to pure greed
All kingdoms have fallen
Human â the great misdeed

Ahhhhâ¦ We win nothing
