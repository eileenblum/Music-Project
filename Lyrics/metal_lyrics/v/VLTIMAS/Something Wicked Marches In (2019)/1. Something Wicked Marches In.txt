Ahhhh we're revealed
Ahhhh for all to see
We contrarians
New level of sorcery

Stand tall and be counted
You're in the presence of royalty
Now is time for decisions
Which side to land in history

Confutare excludere

â¦ Something wicked marches in!

Ahhhh we're revealed
Ahhhh for all to see
Offal superstitions
All lies they were led to believe

Baseless convocations
Crumble easy under scrutiny
Reborn of the darkness
Antithesis of caducity

No chinks in our armor
Gives credence to invulnerable
So choose ever so wisely
One mistake and you'll never be free
So choose ever to wisely!

Like velociraptors we're closing in
First come the scriptures
That's where we begin
Wages of evil's opened the door
Maleficence all the way to the core

â¦ Something wicked marches in!
