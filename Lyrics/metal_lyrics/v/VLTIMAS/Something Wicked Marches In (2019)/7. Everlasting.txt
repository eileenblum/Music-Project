Forged unknown is compositions
Strength unyielding foundation
This combination steel
And spirit can't be broken
Touch of ancients binded imbued

All energies are mustered
Confer immorality everlasting!

Eras before us
Lie in repose
Gave up their all
Bring us to now
Relics of patrons
We've sworn to revere
Gave us enlightened
Vocation is clear
Energy growing invicible!

Pured all human frailties
Gone worthless civility
In excommunicare gave
Serpent room to breath
With fangs injecting idols
Falsehood we have no need

Our energy â unison
Confer immortality
Everlasting

Hastened to offer
Pits to the fold
Our steel is electric
Emotions are cold
Never a warning
No whisper or tear
We the enlightened
Vocation is clear
Energy growing
Everlasting!
