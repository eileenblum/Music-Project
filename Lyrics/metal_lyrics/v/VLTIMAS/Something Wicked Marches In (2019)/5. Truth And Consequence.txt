All veterans make their choices
All have a cross to bear
Unmoved by feeble voices
Or rats within our lairs
Lo shades of grey perplexing
Most simple black or white
To clods I'll stay confusing
Defiant, not contrite!

These are the truths
These are the truths
And this consequence!

Fueled by darkest gasoline
High octane not serene
In a race against the flow
My halo's chilling glow
All sigils green to red
I blaze new paths instead
Traduced exquisite art
Evil to the worlds impart

I'm wild, alert no waiting
Insolently underground
And as the bones are breaking so many souls are quaking
Nosferaturian my blood resolve profound

These are the truths
These are the truths
And this consequence!

My will be done, my vigor steady
Armaments are warm and always ready
Lo confide in me most anti human
Some fates are best left unknown

Confutare excludere

These truths I have to offer
Heed still if disinclined
Forbid myself of conscience
Until I change my mind
Cherish a stone cold circle
Revel in desolate
Let not my heart be troubled
By emotions exploitedâ¦
Here's to the souls I've left
Unbroken, I'll catch you yet
I'll not leave one left standing
'Twill be thy consequence!
