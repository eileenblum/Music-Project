On devilish wings she flies
Decrepit eastern skies
Newborns are so delightful

Snatched from their mother's arms
Pure innocence encharms
Her nightly quotas gathered
See the babes all gone now, watch her fly

Never hear her coming
This deafness serves her well
Contortions in her cauldron
How I love that wretched smell

She is my only
My one and only
None holds a candle to my princess demoness

Grace Monolilith
Your eyes hold all the stars
Your bloody hands' queath magik

Grace Monolilith
Most noble existence
Can nourish all dark faithful

She's quick and through the night
The freshest in her sight
This hunger never ending

Some scorn her ultra bestial
Disinvited to her feast
My unsavory mouth is watering

The emotions shan't be swayed
Sacrifice must be made
Blind masses kept at bay
No quarter in her armsâ¦
How charming!

She is my only
My one and only
None holds a candle to my princess demoness

She is my only
My one and only
None holds a candle to my princess demoness

Grace Monolilith
Your eyes hold all the stars
Your bloody hands' queath magik
