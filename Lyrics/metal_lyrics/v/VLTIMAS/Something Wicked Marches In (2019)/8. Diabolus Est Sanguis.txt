Blood of devils in our veins

This ancient nectar boils
From underground
Transforming, infects
Without a single sound
Bleak silent moaning as we shed our skin
Last human vestige gone and now the fun begins

Undeniable
Not regrettable we are the cure

Blood of devils in our veins
Blood of devils in our veins
Blood of devils in our veins

Confounding status quo
Shall be no more
All yield archaic evils long abhorred
Reveal solutions draped in mystery
A testament for martyrs destiny

Undeniable
Insurmountable we are the cure

Blood of devils in our veins

Demons spells
They serve us well
This noxious smell
Drive us to insanity
Recipe for total calamity

New aggressions breeding its
A work of art
Sanguis diabolus is in our hearts
Minds set for missions of great despair
Set in motion total chaos is everywhere

Blood of devils in our veins
Blood of devils in our veins
Blood of devils in our veins
