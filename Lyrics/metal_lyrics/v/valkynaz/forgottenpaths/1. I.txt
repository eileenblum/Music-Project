Searching
For answers to where I am
And how I got here
It's all such a mystery

Criss-crossed,
This path led me through life
And unto this moment
I have remained unaware.

I feel lost,
Hate filling my blood
with fire and carnage.
I want to slaughter ALL!!!

But this place is so serene.
I feel calm
I feel aware,
And I wonder where I now am.

Beautiful cold sunlight
Filters through the leaves
ov this blackened wood.
And happiness fills my mind

Once more. . . .
