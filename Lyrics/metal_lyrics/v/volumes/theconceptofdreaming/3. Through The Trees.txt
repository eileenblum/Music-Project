The timing
Was so perfectly performed
As I sat in the
Forest unknown
Among you forms of
Life I have come to know
You grow, grow on me
Every time we are encountering
Every time we are encountering
And that's when I saw them
Through the trees
Come for me
Walk me to your home
I want to see
Where you come from
Channel your thoughts
Through my body
Oh just please
Oh please don't judge me
That's when they laid me down
On the table to rest
Sticking devices in my veins
I had absolutely no control
And as the fluids
Injecting, running, inside me (inside me)
I looked up at the lights
Never wanting to return home
They grabbed my chest
Penetrating it with a knife
I tried to stand up but had no feeling inside me
Who are these people?
Why am I floating?
Yet I am so convinced, of what they do to me
Through the trees
Their lights bleed
You better fucking run and hide
That's when the dust dispersed
I could see, the treetops emerge
Come for me
Take me to your home
I want to see
Where you come from
Channel your thoughts
Through my body
Oh just please, oh please don t judge me
