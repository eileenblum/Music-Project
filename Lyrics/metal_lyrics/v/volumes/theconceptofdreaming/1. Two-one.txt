We make our luck
Against faulty lines
This stronghold we have built
And so you wanna be disconnected?
Rise the fuck up
And see what happens
This is an epidemic
One that will not be stopped
Won't breakdown after
After, their heads peak over the hill
Will you put down your weapon?
Shelter is coming nowhere
A sky so red and purple
Inflammation
Never look past this treason
I am the reason you re still breathing
I picked up his gun
This previous slayed body
To bury thousands more
No waste of lead in my magazine
Now-a-days I m finding
More than treason
'Til death, oh pulverizer
You will clean this mess
You pompous fool
Sitting upon your throne
Infestation to send you home
So you wanna be disconnected?
Rise the fuck up
And see what happens
This is an epidemic
One that cannot be stopped
So you wanna be disconnected?
Rise the fuck up and see what happens
This is an epidemic
One that cannot be stopped
