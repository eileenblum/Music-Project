Where will I end up tonight?
Maybe that house again
Maybe the city by the lake
Because when I'm
I'm just sleeping
I'm fast to escape
Relate to feelings in mind
Relate to feelings in mind
This has been
This has been a collection
I have made
Wormholes connecting me
Through the ages
I thought that you would have met me there
Well I was wrong, I was deceived
To believe it now I know it's not real
Grab a hold of me
As I'm falling
Right back where I started from
Do I know you?
Do you know me?
I thought I heard you say
Meet me down by the lake
This has been
A collection that I have made
Wormholes connecting me
Through the ages
Because when I dream of you
In this house we're in
In here with all these fears
Lie down and wait for me to grow old
Oh, oh sweet child
I recognize your face
From somewhere
I guess I have seen before
(Guess I have seen before)
I knew it then I'm
Back inside my apartment
Watching TV
Self loathing, chained up on my couch
I'm listening
Cause now I'm so far from home
Sir can I ask you something?
How the fuck do I get home?
(How the fuck do I get home?)
Wormholes
