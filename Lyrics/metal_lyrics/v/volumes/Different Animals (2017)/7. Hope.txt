All flashbacks lost in my way
Stuck on the black, smacked down on my face
Yea I've been handicapped by a ball and a chain
Locked down in my cell four walls can relate
Facts
Lil kid but bigger world in the photograph
Out playin' but landed myself in Alcatraz
Outcast intact hooked to a polygraph
Lookin' to find myself but lost again like the artifact

Over yesterday stealin' hours away it's all for nothing
Still I can relate enough to think that you'll be fine
I get it out the way, take another saint
It's all for nothing, else but numbing the pain
And still I hope that you'll be fine

I've been trying to reach you
With these words that don't get into your head
All our bridges are burning
And there's nothing we can do but pretend and hope

Lost cause can I still find hope
Find a way to cope
But I still need the antidote
Noose tied tight on the rope till I choke
But I won't stop breathing till the top of the slope
Say my prayers and put me down just the rest
All my demons be calling me but I feel blessed
The needle callin' me, got me feelin' stress
Keep on waking up, another crest of the chest

Over yesterday stealin' hours away it's all for nothing
Still I can relate enough to think that you'll be fine
I get it out of the way, take another saint
It's all for nothing, else but numbing the pain
And still I hope that you'll be fine

I've been trying to reach you
With these words that don't get into your head
All our bridges are burning
And there's nothing we can do but pretend and hope

So sick of the lies
The whole world just died
Just look at my eyes and then you realize
That I'm really just that high, I OD'd and demised
And baby don't cry, just pray up at the sky
Don't justify when I'm crucified
Then glorified and then amplified
And there's nothing we can do but pretend and hope

I've been trying to reach you
With these words that don't get into your head
All our bridges are burning
And there's nothing we can do but pretend and hope

Oh love sing it to me
Say run, dare me to breathe
Show me the pattern now
And there's nothing we can do but pretend
And there's nothing we can do but pretend and hope
And hope
