In a heavy silence, backs in view
Walking through the haunted doorway, writing off the truth
With a pleasant memory of the former you
It's enough to soften judging hearts but yet spoken too soon
Because all the memories are right here inside of me
And it's taking all of me not to break or make a scene
Just leave me alone, meet me down below
Pissing on a stone, just to say hello
Lit the herb of grace, hit the veins and freeze
In a petty silence mother stews
And I could cut the air in here with a sharpened thought or two
What a fine endeavor, conducting as a tune
At the tone I ride my impulses and curb my attitude
Because all the memories are right here inside of me
And it's taking all of me not to break or make a scene
Just throw it in the moat, meet me down below
Pissing on a stone, just to say hello
Lit the herb of grace, hit the veins and freeze
Because all the memories are right here inside of me
And it's taking all of me not to break or make a scene
Just leave me alone, meet me down below
Pissing on a stone, just to say hello
Lit the herb of grace, hit the veins and freeze
