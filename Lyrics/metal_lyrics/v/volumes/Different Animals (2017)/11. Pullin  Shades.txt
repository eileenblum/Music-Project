Fuck!
I'm sick of playing the fighter
I hold on tighter, feeling you let me go
(Let go!)
Under the pressure of silence, avoid disguises
But you still block me at the door
I'm in your eyes and you still can't see me now
I'm in your sight but you're lookin' all around
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found
I keep a light in the sound
You keep on pullin' shades down
I'm in your eyes and you still can't see me now
I'm in your sight but you're lookin' all around
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found
I keep a light in the sound
You keep on pullin' shades down
Stuck in the deal I've been handed
Got me stranded
Force me to swim or drown
Nothing's the way that we planned it
Take for granted the signs that I leave around
You keep on pullin' the shades downâ¦
I'm in your eyes and you still can't see me now
I'm in your sight but you're lookin' all around
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found
I keep a light in the sound
You keep on pullin' shades down
I'm in your eyes and you still can't see me now
I'm in your sight but you're lookin' all around
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found
I keep a light in the sound
You keep on pullin' shades down
I'm in your eyes and you still can't see me now
I'm in your sight but you're lookin' all around
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found
I keep a light in the sound
You keep on pullin' shades down
I'm in your eyes and you still can't see me now
I'm in your sight but you're lookin' all around
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found
I keep a light in the sound
You keep on pullin' shades down
