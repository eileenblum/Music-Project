Fuck it, why don't you just let me overdose?
I did it again, and woke up again
Tired of running from all these withdrawals, keep losing my friends
This might be my end
All of these drugs while I'm counting my ends
Fuck it I'm dead
Fuck it I'm dead inside...
And now you know why

Now that I'm gone, I'm on the run
Alone in my room I look down at my gun
Picking it up, I don't want to give up
But I'm stuck in this rut that I've dug and I'm fucked
The drugs didn't help
I blame myself for the shit I've been dealt
Tell you I'm cool but I'm losing my grip
Tell you I'm good but I'm losing my shit

You didn't want to take him to the hospital
All you really wanted was his capital
Another one lost that we cannot predict
This is a plague and we cannot pretend
Another mistake too much gas in your lungs
When you stick in that needle and watch what's alive

Letting go of all I've ever known
I wanna feel the wave's control
Tighten its grip around my throat
Crashing over me, I'm holding on

Feel the narcotics might never wake up
All of the bodies just start to pile up
And that's when it hits you rips you perplexed
Now you are floating, it's on to the next

Now I'm letting go, let the chemicals control
I'm holding on
Always dismissed do you get the gist?
I'm holding on

Letting go of all I've ever known
I wanna feel the wave's control
Tighten its grip around my throat
You never really ever gave a shit

Always kneeling down
I'm an addict with a crown
Don't you love the sound when my body hits the ground
Why don't you just let me drown?

Fuck it, why don't you just let me overdose?
I did it again, and woke up again
Tired of running from all these withdrawals, keep losing my friends
This might be my end
All of these drugs while I'm counting my ends
Fuck it I'm dead
Fuck it I'm dead inside...
And now you know why
