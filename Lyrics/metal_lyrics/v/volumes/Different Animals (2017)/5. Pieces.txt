Now I'm lost again just turn me around one last time
Now I'm crossed again it's turning into my last night
Under the cobwebs that hold my skin
I'm just a bone yard so help me sleep tight
Now I'm fucked again I woke up in hell with more crimes

Here in my tragedy, drifting from sanity
I'm falling down to pieces
I'm falling down to pieces
Here on my own today, feeling me fade away
I'm falling down to pieces
I'm falling down to pieces

Now I'm lost again, just turn me around one last time
Now I'm crossed again it's turning into my last night
Under the cobwebs that hold my skin, I'm just a bone yard so help me sleep tight
Now I'm fucked again, there will never be heaven for me inside
Here in my tragedy, drifting from sanity
I'm falling down to pieces
I'm falling down to pieces
Here on my own today, feeling me fade away
I'm falling down to pieces
I'm falling down to pieces
Nowhere left to run
Nowhere left to hide
No escape from the thoughts that plague my mind
No one left to hurt
No tears left to cry
Nothing left to burn
Time to say goodbyeâ¦
Goodbye
Just load it and cock it I'm not a prophet I'm here for profit
Goddamn
And fuck all the loses my heroine goddess
Just close coffin goddamn
