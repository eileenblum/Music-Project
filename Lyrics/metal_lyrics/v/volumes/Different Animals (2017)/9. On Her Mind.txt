[feat. Pouya]When this love subsides
I never realized
The vibe downside
She opened my eyes
She left me alone
Broken at home
Gripping that chrome
Locked in a catacomb
With a love syndrome
About to implode explode
I don't condone
This endless cyclone

200 calls on my phone that I missed voice mails
Talkin bout where u at where u been
I need to know who u with
I already told u that I'm with the homies recording
I can't be reportin my moves all day
More time with you less money go my way
Lemme do my thang, lemme rock my chain
When I get home let the dingaling swing

I fell in love with the pain
She fell in love with the game
Told u I never would change
Pussy be callin my name
Thuggin and bussin my thang
Girl you fuckin insane
Girl you fuckin a lame
Girl I'm whippin a range
On and off the stage
Critically acclaimed
Pouya hoe you know I can't be retained
I can't be retained

She can send me into overdrive
We do this all the time
Now she's coming over every night
Like I'm always on her mind

She kept talkin that shit
And gettin me pissed
Wish she didn't exist
But she won't be missed
And don't insist
Yo I'll fuckin dismiss
You off my list
Then I grab my fist
And the wall I hit
God damn you a twist
And we can't coexist or resist
You're on the black list

When this love subsides
I never realized
The vibe downside
She opened my eyes
She left me alone
Broken at home
Gripping that chrome
Locked in a catacomb
With a love syndrome
About to implode explode
I don't condone
This endless cyclone

She can send me into overdrive
We do this all the time
Now she's coming over every night
Like I'm always on her mind
She can show things, get anything
I'm always on the line
Now she's coming over every night
Like I'm always on her mind

Locked out and she's a loaded gun
Cause she knows how I like my fun
Straight down into another one
Cause she knows she's not the only one

You not the only one
You think I owe u sum'
You think you know me
But you not the lonely one
I don't feel anything anymore
Look me in my eyes
I'm ready to die, bust my .45
Break bread with my guys
When I'm counting baby don't hit my line
Turn around bow down lemme feel your spine

She can send me into overdrive
We do this all the time
Now she's coming over every night
Like I'm always on her mind
She can show things, get anything
I'm always on the line
Now she's coming over every night
Like I'm always on her mind
