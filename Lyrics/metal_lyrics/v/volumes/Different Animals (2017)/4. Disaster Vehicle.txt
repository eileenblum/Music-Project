Fuck the system and its politics
All politicians are corrupt then quit
They all switch and they all snitch
Just to benefit and get more rich
It's all bullshit and it ain't no lie
Fuck the politics I'll burn that bridge

Yeah there's a war on drugs
Yeah a war on love
Can't tell me no cause there's a war on us
Yeah
They kill these kids in the streets
Lock us all down and say we're free
Open your eyes can't you see?

Fuck the system and its politics
All politicians are corrupt then quit
They all switch and they all snitch
Just to benefit and get more rich
It's all bullshit and it ain't no lie
Fuck the politics I'll burn that bridge

Police killing off civilians
Killing all the innocents
This is all imminent been through the imprisonment this is no coincidence

Rats in the wheel grinding life away
Rats in the wheel grinding
We're all rats in a wheel grinding life away

Fuck the system and its politics
All politicians are corrupt then quit
They all switch and they all snitch
Just to benefit and get more rich
It's all bullshit and it ain't no lie
Fuck the politics I'll burn that bridge
