Left for dead inside my mind
Alone and fighting for my life
The floor was cold, I was alone
Crucified let me go
Let me fucking go
Fade in, fading out of consciousness
Cause everyday feels like I don't exist
So every night's another near death miss
Praying for the day that I don't wake up again
To feel this pain in my mind... fucking take my life
Take my mind
Now I'm blind
I'm in a bind
Burn it all tonight
Goddamn
Why don't all of you just bury me tonight God damn man... Fuck
Left for dead... inside my mind
Alone and fighting for my life
The floor was cold, I was alone... crucified, let me go
Let me fucking go
