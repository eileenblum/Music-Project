Hold my hands
Yes hold them close so tightly
For so long I have felt this fear
Take deep breaths
Don't give up here just yet
You swear your endings somewhere near
I was there
Pulling into my driveway
Running straight to the front door
As to see
Her tell my family that he had stopped intake long before
After that
Coming from every angle
A thousand things
Running through my head
Didn't expect it now
No not now
Why it's so soon
Yet I m still poised and offering
As I tread the living room
Oh, you held me higher
Than I thought that I could climb
I'd just say no
Guilty me
I treated you like shit
And you were all I ever wanted in me
I owe you it too
Because I missed my last chance to say
That I love you
I caught a glimpse of his legs
Collapsed in black
Leaning over the slaves
A place that I
Used to call home
(Call my home)
In that street
That house where I came from
Guilty me
I treated you like shit
And you were all I ever wanted in me
I owe you it too
Because I missed my last chance to say
That I love you
Hold my hands
Yes hold them close so tightly
For so long I have felt this fear
Take deep breaths
Don't give up here just yet
You swear your endings somewhere near
I was there
Pulling into my driveway
Running straight to the front door
As to see
Her tell my family that he had stopped intake long before
Guilty me
I treated you like shit
And you were all I ever wanted in me
I owe it to you
Because I missed my last chance to say
That I love you
