Write me off
I'm going south for the year
So take me there
Off the map
That no one else could scale

You sat me down showed me the ariels
That resonate the skies
In between the visual lines
Encompassing pines 
In the greenery commons
Is it pressed in a book

A history unknown
An isle of concentrated mineral
In elapsed time
Directions to locate the fountain of karrots
The sight of gold

They sat me down on a point
And my eyes looked up in texture
The illuminating brim
A solid trilogy circle
Embedded in the rock orbital
When I'm gone you know where you can find me
Here

It was immaculate
In its beauty a thousand words
Could never describe the colored brights
Forever, to a shore

Where you can dig the earth
And let it run through your hands
As deep as it will glow
We savored the last hour with the turning of the sun

A visual shrine
Existing with electronic lines
An inseparable sign
Intertwined with the corkscrewed
Manifested woman

In front of me, toxicity
In front of me, she barely stood
Take me there
It was immaculate
In its beauty a thousand words
Could never describe the colored brights
Forever, to a shore
