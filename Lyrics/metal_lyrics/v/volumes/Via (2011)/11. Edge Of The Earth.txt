To go as far, as far as I can see
at the edge of the earth
The continuos sound of lights
that have reached the bottom

In the middle of the desert
I stared patiently
To see them touch the ground
Imploding on the cracked mud surface

I knelt down underneath the midway
In the millionth sighting

Lets lay back
Sitting inside my car
At the edge of the earth
I turned my head to the left
And I knew I could not be drugged
Orbs with infusion white
Mirroring the image of a silhouette
At the edge of the earth

And I'm here tonight
Underneath the influence
And why can't I find a way out 
It's calling me tonight
This secret I have become
At the edge of the earth

You misunderstood the gravity
As the weight falls apart
You'll watch me walk away
I walk away
Calm as the wind
You'll watch me go

Let's lay back
Sitting inside my car
At the edge of the earth
I turned my head to left 
And I knew I could not be drugged
Orbs with infusion white
Mirroring the image of a silhouette
At the edge of the earth

And I'm here tonight
Underneath the influence
And why can't I find a way out
It's calling me tonight
The secret I have become
At the edge of the earth
