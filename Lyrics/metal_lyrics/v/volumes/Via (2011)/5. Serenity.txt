Inertia stands over me
Holding me down on her bed
A million lights as they shed off of me
I remember the drug waking me up

An insufficient fluid based
Down your back
Being remembered in waves
It meant the world
A pioneer expecting the worst

From a pressed colored label
You rebuild with your hands
A vision I have known
To feel the extract underneath the palms
In an enhanced nighttime
With the weight of viruality
Like the sound when planes collide
To the ground in my eyes

I lost myself deep within its depths
I'll surface with time in the waters where we met
You lost your sight
So remember how it used to be
So get used to me
I'll see you on the other side

An insufficient fluid based
Down your back
Being remembered in waves
It meant the world
A pioneer expecting the worst

Louise, Louise
Where I met you
Underneath extended stars
I wait until the day breaks
Will I ever see you again?
