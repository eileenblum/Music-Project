Just may lose my mind from time to time
Keep on elevating I climb
Every time I turn the corner I can see death in the face
Just another empty shell living disgrace
Applying pressure to the throat
One to many times how can this effect my life

Wandered towards the light do it all again night

Falling like I'm hurt
Sinking in the dirt need it first I'm in love
Crawling like a worm
I'm a scarecrow in the field I need the work

Like a candle that burns from both ends
Sit back watch it turn to ash and witness the end

Hello goodbye
Goodbye hello
I'm so gone never gonna make it home
All alone now take me out my zone now

Hello death it's my pleasure nice to meet

It all became so clear when I let go
Thoughts inside my head that left me cold

Let me go

I turn cold
I turn cold

Hello goodbye
Goodbye hello

I'm so gone never gonna make it home
All alone now take me out my zone now

Goodbye hello

Hello death it's my pleasure nice to meet

Like a candle that burns from both ends
Sit back watch it turn to ash and witness the end

I turn cold
I turn cold
I'm so cold
I turn cold
