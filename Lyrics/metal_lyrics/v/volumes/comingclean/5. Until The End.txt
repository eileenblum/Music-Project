This time why don't you try something new
Cause I've heard you say that
This time your shallow words won't due
Cause I've heard you say that before

Now you expect me to think that just because
You're growing bones and taking shape
That I should hold onto you or continuously lose
I'm sorry but I don't play that game

Where has your head gone
Where is your heart at?
If that's what you mean and that's how you feel
Then why couldn't you say that

Cause now we're on our own
Our backs pressed up against the wall
So far from home
So far away from finishing
But we still hold onto the things
Like you can count on me
And I'll walk with you until the end

Now there's a million things
That I would say to you
If I could just seem to get through
The hardest part is always making sense
When trying to make sense
Is something I'm just not used to

Flesh searches for more
More than just skin
Greed and jealousy destroy what's within
It swallows me whole
Hollowing out
Any memories I have of you now

Now you expect me to think that just because
We're one year older and things have changed
When you continuously do what you promised not to
It's hard for me not want to away pull away inside

Your words cut me over and over again
Each time
It's a repeat excuse
Another problem where the blame is all mine
I'm tired of fighting for my place
I've lost the will to try

This time why don't you try something new
Cause I've heard you say that
This time your shallow words won't due
Cause I've heard you say that before

Cause now we're on our own
Our backs pressed up against the wall
So far from home
So far away from finishing
But we still hold onto the things
Like you can count on me
And I'll walk with you until the end
And I'll walk with you until the end
