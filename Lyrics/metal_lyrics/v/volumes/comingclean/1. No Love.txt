[feat. Fronzilla]Take a ride in my Nimbus one time
You know how we living police suspect
All good we get that respect
Disrespect you finna get all swept

You know who I am
Cooking like a chef with a pan
Quick flights to France take a chance
See the drip rockin' BAPE all the way from Japan

Look alive look alive

So now you see me, and now you don't
Come and catch these hands bitch
I'm back with a vengeance
Yeah I want all the smoke, run it

No love, let me tell you that it's all gone
Let me show you how to break it down
Ima show you how to keep it down
Just listen

I just climbed from the bottom
You ain't never gonna stop me
Yeah you know I'm finna blossom
You ain't never gonna top me

No love
It's all gone

Look alive look alive
So now you see me, and now you don't
I'm back with a vengeance
Yeah I want all the smoke

Take a ride in my Nimbus one time
You know how we living, police suspect
All good we get that respect
Disrespect you finna get all swept

You know who I am
Cooking like a chef with a pan
Quick flights to France, take a chance
See the drip rockin' BAPE all the way from Japan

Get back one time smoke the whole sack
Know we rollin' with the homies got the loud pack
So if you're not fuckin' with it better get back
Takin' it over I got your girl bended over she gonna give me a wild time
Only here for a short time
Time to make this the best night
Metalcore millionaire OG fuck widdit

I just climbed from the bottom
You ain't never gonna stop me
Yeah you know I'm finna blossom
You ain't never gonna top me

Look alive look alive
So now you see me, and now you don't
I'm back with a vengeance
Yeah I want all the smoke
