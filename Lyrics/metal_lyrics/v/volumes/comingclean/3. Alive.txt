Am I alive (locked away locked away again)
We're living a lie (no escape no escape from this)
Why couldn't I make you see
Should've been there
Saved you from the light

Should've made things right
Now I'll never get the chance to
Tell you exactly what you mean to me
I should've got the chance to
Tell you exactly what you mean to me
And I wish you were here
Falling down
Watch me drown
Falling down

Am I alive (locked away locked away again)
We're living a lie (no escape no escape from this)

I ask you please don't give up
Devil inside don't know who to trust
I promise you live through us
There's nothing to discuss

Pick you up and don't let you fall
Don't take it there when I risked it all
If I could take it back I'd answer your call

Falling down
Watch me drown
Falling down

I miss you on days like this
Now in my heart and my mind
Carry the thought of you with me

Am I alive (locked away locked away again)
We're living a lie (no escape no escape from this)

Pick you up and don't let you fall
Laid to rest for once and all
See you again some were that I know
I will go

Am I alive
We're living a lie
