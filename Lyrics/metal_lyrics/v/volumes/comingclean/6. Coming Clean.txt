There's nothing that I can't control
I'm living like an animal
Can't even feel the love no more
And I don't even think I have a soul

Always feeling like a black hole
Light one up and then I always end up being afloat
Got me fucked up waking up in Baltimore
Heart and soul swallowed whole always feeling low

Am I living a lie can't even trust myself (am I lost or found)
Look into my eyes can't you see I need help (I think I'm lost not found)

Will we ever learn man take it easy there's no reason
Leaving behind thinking for a feeling that is fleeting
The pain of waking up to what you've built around you crumbling
Will we ever learn man take it easy there's no reason

Damn living near impossible
Got me jumping through these obstacles
Rappin' now scream inaudible
Reinvent the steel yea its phenomenal

I've gotta make up my mind before I lose myself (am I lost or found)
Inside I'm falling behind scared to say I need help (I think I'm lost not found)

Coming clean I've been so high for too long
Finally I've found the strength to hold on

Am I living a lie can't even trust myself (am I lost or found)
Look into my eyes can't you see I need help (I think I'm lost not found)

Will we ever learn man take it easy there's no reason
Leaving behind thinking for a feeling that is fleeting
The pain of waking up to what you've built around you crumbling
Will we ever learn man take it easy there's no reason
