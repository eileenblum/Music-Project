Columns of anguish
Satanas
House of the dead
Where blood fails like rain
Demons suck you entrails though your
Intestinal tract
Your infection, eating bile &amp; phlegm
Crucifixion, vivisection
Mutilation, defecation
No hope for retribution
Fallacious avatar of Satan
You know you can only die once
In death you opened the gate
Debt of eternal pain
"Your soul is mine!"
In the palace of torment
You're burned at the stake then draws &amp; quartered
Beheaded, dismembered &amp; raped
From your sockets your eyes socked by an ogre
While a fiend strips your flesh as you suffer
Extant eternal pain
Once dead you can never die!
