To live this life
To reason to try
They're all liars just dying to die
Grasping life, revolting life
In my mind's eve I see the scorn
People melting, blood drips from the core
Trapped, you scream you pathetic soul
Into the maze, pay your toll of life
Even in death there is life
Blood dripping, your body writhes
In your hand you hold your heart
Forever wear the demon's mark God
Self-afflicting pain, socially insane
Rotting of the brain, I will make you sane
Devout new Messiah
