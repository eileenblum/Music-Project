Hallowed be the dead
Darkness &amp; evil
Sanguinary homage
Sanctified oblation
Infinite
Black space
Obligue nothingness
Reigns
In this lost world
Moribund
Searing through
Nebulous void
Endless gateway
IO...
Transmigration, transmigration
Black space
Obligue nothingness
In this lost world
Moribund
Life transferred through my eyes
To die physically
Life passes through my eyes
Your time never has to be
