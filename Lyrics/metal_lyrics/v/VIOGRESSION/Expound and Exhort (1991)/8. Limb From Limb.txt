Fighting for life, dying torn in half
Though the gore, watch him die
He was torn limb from limb
Dismembered instantly, death a certainty
Blood, no everywhere
Horrific death, cold stare
Bones grinding in the machine
Totally, disfigured chunks of meat
Grinding, slicing, tearing
His body into chunks of bloody flesh
