I am standing on a bridge
As tall as a tower is
The only one which ever left
One bridge too far now

I hope it's not too late
Just to go away
So now I beg you to
Push me down
If you can close my eyes
To eternal sleep
Now I have to jump

I see you standing on the bridge
And I can feel your pain despair
You know it's no hope for you
'Cause it's one bridge too far
One bridge too far you have to jump
