The night is coming
I'm getting away
I see what has been
And I see will be end
I see...

I see the starlight
It's showing me how
Pretend that I live and
Pretend that I feel
I pretend

When I see
Your death
I can not belive
That I feel anything
I pretend
When I see your death
My eyes are
The river of sorrow
Despair
And I see

When I die
I touch myself but
I can not feel anything
But tears on my chick
When I die
I see what has been
And I see what will be
I see you
When I die
I touch myself but
I can not feel anything
But emptiness

I feel nothing
When I die
