I don't believe in devils
Watching up on me,
Shepards of souls,
Guards of dreams.

I don't believe in angels
Watching down on me,
Shepards of souls,
Guards of dreams.

I don't believe in devils
I don't believe in angels
I'm far away from here
I'm looking for myself

After the great beginning
I'm far away from here,
Away from poeple,
So close to myself.

People are not good,
They are not bed too.
They are only lost desires
In black universe.

I feel my soul now
Is flying far away.
Maybe it's over,
But maybe it's my birth.

My love and hate -
Ideas of hope.
My fragile body -
A glass of water.

I have my hands empty
My eyes are blind,
But my soul is surviver
In the sea of lust.

Now i don't remember my face,
I'm looking for myself
I have to find my lost desires
Before they find me.

Between the light and darkness
From one break to another
Your live is just a flame
A burning candle of eternal wind
