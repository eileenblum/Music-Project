[THE DEEPEST SADNESS]

I would die for you
If only you want it
I would be your stool
There's too much love inside of me
To stand all this waterfalls
I feel so full in overflowing heart
So I can't even move my hand

[OCEAN OF TEARS]

[ENDLESS SORROW]

I will close my eyes
To see your face
I will shout my mounth
To tell you how I love you
I will stop my ears
To hear your voice
I will screw up my lips
To feel the taste of your mouth
