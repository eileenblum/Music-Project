Merciless ruthless barbarian
His fame is lasting forever
The greatest hunter immortal existence
Death for love revenge is comming

One aimless death became the beginning
Of many years of madness
Her tragic life for million lifes
From worship to oppressing
From brightest light to dark
Between your life and death
Is only line of blood

Eternal love eternal tragedy
Immortal soul with mortal matter
Beauty and death animal and god
Light and darkness together

He will always remember
Her velvet skin
Divine shape
Immortal love

The greatest tragedy
Eternal darkest sadness
Your blood for her blood
Your life for his madness
From the greatest honour
You felt down into the abyss
You stucked in despair
Possessed by wild and evil madness
Longing for her, the one you loved
Made you a monstrous beast
You burried your hope
You choose different fate

You renounce your belive
To revenge for all this pain
Forgotten ancient spirits
Came into your mind
Misterious circle of anger
Made your existence forever
To take away lives and dreams
To make people helpless and soiled
To take blood to give fear
And it is all for one life

Let me feel the same
Let me be the blood in your veins
Take my fear despaire
Take my love and take my hate
Let me be the one
Who had touched immortality
Possess all my dreams
Waterfalls of bloody tears
