Two voices in my trembling soul
They bring my tears and pain
I am possessed by two of them
They speak so noisily loud
I see the ocean full of blood
I hear my laugh and scream
I see beginning of new life
I hear my crying breath

Feel no pain
And sorrow
You see the light
Eternal flame
It is burning
In your heart
I give you now
Wings of hope
Don't ever look
Into your eyes
Take care for
Seed in your fist

Your soul is burning
In eternal flames
There's nothing in your heart
But suffer and pain

You're going down
There is no edge
You can hold now
There's no hope and faith

It will give you
Some roots
The fruits
You will eat
Your joy is still
Your main weapon
You can fight
With all evil
