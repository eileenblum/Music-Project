Forgiveness is the time of tears
The days of yesterday's sorrow
Forgiveness is the hidden part
Of dying hate and love

Come and forget insensible shiver
Go and remember the worming of your heart

Aristea, my friend
Forgive me all this emptiness
Forget the time of breathless days

You never lost your innocense
You see the things invisible
Two sisters and friends
Two different sides of truth

I see your face in every dream
I can not see broken wings
I wish I was immortal
I'm sorry that I am not
