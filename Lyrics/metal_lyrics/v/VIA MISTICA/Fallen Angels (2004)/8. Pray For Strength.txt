Oh, hear my pray
One single sign
Will stop my pain
Will keep my life

Oh, hear my pray
Show me your might
One misery
Will bright the dark

Laying on the flour
Waiting for bright
Waiting for hope
I pray...

from the darkest night
hear my tears
hear my breath
I pray...

Waiting for new strenght
Hoping for the light
Beging for beginning
Give me a sign

Angel came down
and gave me the light
