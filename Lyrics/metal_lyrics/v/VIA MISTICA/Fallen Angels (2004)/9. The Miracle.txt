From the pain and sleepless nigths
I'm waiting
All this days I doubt and hope uncertain
From the pain and sleepless nigths
I am expecting
All this days I hope for the miracle of life

Whatever you have began you have to finish it
Whatever is finished it must have been started
From the greatest pain it can be the greatest joy
Joyfull happiness can give you the pain
