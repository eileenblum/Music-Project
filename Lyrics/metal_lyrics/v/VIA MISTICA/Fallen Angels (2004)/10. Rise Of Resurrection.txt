Grant them eternal rest
And let perpetual light
Shine upon them
Thou shalt have prise
To thee let the vow be paid
Heed my prayer
All mankind must come
Before thy Judgement- seat
Grant them eternal rest
And let perpetual light
Shine upon them
Have mercy
On that day of tearful wonder
When the tomb is rent asurender
Guilty man to doom shall waken
Leave him not forsaken

Rise of ressurection

Life and death will stay accorded
Shame and grief my soul opressing
Doom shall pass with deed accounded
Hear me Lord, my sins confessing

Hear the trumped-blast resounding
Through all tombs rebounding earth
Spare my soul that day's perdition
Summons of the Judgement sounding

When the heavy malediction
Smites the damned with affliction of hell
Call me to thy benediction
Crushed to dust,
Isupliant bending

Crave thy care when life is ending
To what friend for succor flying
When the justin fear are sighing
