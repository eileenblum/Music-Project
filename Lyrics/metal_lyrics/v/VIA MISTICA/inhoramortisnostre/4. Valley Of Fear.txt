I will build the tower
Taller than a mountain
I will sing my song
Louder than a wind
I will keep my head
Higher than a tree
I will feel the taste of victory

And I'll walk
Through the valley of fear
With a smile on my face
And I'll pass through the darkness and death
With a light in my heart

You'll never know
What you become
When you don't feel
Brave and proud in your heart
You'll never see
The brightest light
When your eyes and mind
Are not opened wide
