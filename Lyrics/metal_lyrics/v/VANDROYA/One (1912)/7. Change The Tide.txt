Am I dreaming or am I alive?
The devil was my last sight
At the end of this line I see something
I canât understand
And I feel thereâs no time to waste
I must prevent my sonâs disgrace

How dare you look at me in the eye?
You are no more than ashes, void of life
But I own you appreciation
This is your lucky day, just make a wish

Let me guide him forever
Is a sole drop enough to change the tide?

You are standing between the poles
Both attract you, now you go for one
Either way you lose, you know
How could you wish something for him, not for you?

Let me guide him forever
Is a sole drop enough to change the tide?
There was only a right choice and you did well
Time has come, donât waste a drop of change the tide
