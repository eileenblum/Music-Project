Has it gone too far?
Do you know what for?
Whatâs on the way?
Unending metaphors
Rising from the core
Canât show you the way

Maybe itâll never unveil
Its darkest inner doubts
Maybe it will never show paradise

The world wants to make you believe,
Canât you see?
Gather the pieces of your mind
That once was broken

Entering the fire circle
Everything you know falls apart
You are living in a complete chaos
Itâs the smell of burning consciousness
Hailing from your twisted soul
Lost between perpetual and ephemeral

The world wants to make you believe,
Canât you see?
Gather the pieces of your mind
That once again is broken
The sound of the Earth
Calling for you and me
This would will never be healed
Till you start getting over this damn fight

Maybe it will never unlock
Its secrets to your mind
Never will lead us to paradise
