You are the most beautiful rising
Dawn bringer from the horizon
Enlighten the earth with your colors
Life rises from your fire circle

The shadows donât come when you go
âCause you send your light through the flow
Of the silver circle before the stars
We are under shining sparks

Let your twilight be the pride
The golden heaven as our prize
Both lands can sing this work
Wonders built in your honor

From southern deserts to opened seas
You make our lives grow, it is born in me
From seeds on earth your empire will rise
Through sands of time, you make our legacy shine

Master of all gold,
Core of all creations,
Shine your light on me, send me rays of life
Make our lives glow
Feed our lands from skies above
The son of the son
Will be grateful for your eternal light
