Radiant like sunshine
She came all dressed in white
Distant gaze and a necklace made of stone

So different from the dark night
Laying on the riverside
Standing there, calm and deadly cold

A sudden energy pulses to the sound of drums
And shadows dancing in the solar tone of love

Like a night that falls in love
With the brightness of the stars
Revealing carved secrets from their souls

It never goes down, so she begs for the dawn
Feeling her tired hands getting numb
Over the hills, far away from her domains,
She hears the calling song

âOh, solar night painting our skies
With a different kind of blue
If every night is a blue night
And I pulse in order to find you,
Bring back that night againâ

Iâm calling you, hear me calling
Iâm waiting for my rising sun

There comes the night capturing all the lights
That she keeps as a secret in vain
She buries in earth and she jumps to beyond
In silent joyful pain
Iâm falling â Dancing lights in the dark
Iâm calling â Voiceless songs of the stars
