Now itâs time
I feel that it canât be the end
How could we just live without our love?

Saying goodbye
Itâs not the thing I want yet
And donât have those moments anymore

Remember all the words you said to me
That couldnât be a lie

When you try to say the truth
I am standing here for you
Dreaming of a nearly past
Trying to be and do the best
While youâre breaking up my heart
Iâm counting the stars, tell me why
Why should we say goodbye?

Tell me now
How can I just live without
The life that we have dreamed once before?

Save me now
My heart is tired of fight it out
Stop this pain and close this damn hole

Remember all the words youâve heard
From me
âCause it you canât deny

I may be just dreaming
You said you loved me, so believe me
Thereâs a light that Iâve met in you
And itâs the only way to save me
When you are so distant
I cannot stand my own existence
Thereâs a flame that still burns
Here inside my heart

This nightmare wonât free me
Oh baby, donât you dare to leave me
âCause youâre inside my heart
