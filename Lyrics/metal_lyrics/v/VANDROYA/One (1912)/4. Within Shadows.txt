Locked in chains
Iâm feeling so strange
Let me out of here
Those damn red lights in my eyes
That lead me to your lies
That bind me in your dreams
I cry every night and I whisper:
âHow long will it stay?â

Look inside you and youâll see
Reveal your dreams to me
Seek the undefined
The twilight in your mind that haunts me

And run
Run to the end
Holding my hand
Itâs just a dream
We donât need to wake up
Falling through our mystery
Walking and wondering, why?
Touch the essence, feel the divine
Reaching skies

Spread your wings, your secret dreams
I will release you from all your fears
Do you believe in fantasy?
Dance within shadows and you will see

A sin within a dream
Touched by your kiss
A cry in the night that
Calls me into your lies

Look inside you and youâll see
Reveal your dreams to me
Seek the undefined
The twilight into your mind
