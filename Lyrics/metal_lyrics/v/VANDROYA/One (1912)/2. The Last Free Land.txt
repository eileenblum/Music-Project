From the distant lands of east
Undefined hearts of beast
Marching against our faith

Run to the desert
Far beyond the hills of sands are the gods
Crying and despair
Life has left this place

Be the unbreakable wall
The river that will wash away the fear of us all
The one guided by the light

Praise the power of the throne
We will drive into the storm (rise in glory!)
Liberty shall reign in this night
Fight for this land until the sun and moon be aligned
Into the fire!

She, the daughter of the moon
Begging to be undone
A new life born for unite

Eye of the light divine
Bearer of the two crowns let it shine
The oracle is in the sky

They blew above us
A reverse wind, a cruel power,
Killing all kings
Destroying the temple of the divine
Enslaving us forever
