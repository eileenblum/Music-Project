With dismay you meet the rising dawn,
Tired of the endless roam,
You've lost your way and there is no return
To the place you long ago called home.
With a burnt out soul and broken will,
After years of pain you've suffered through,
With every freedom-loving breath they'd kill,
There's nothing left of the real you

[CHORUS:]
Blind to your pain, deaf to all the words you say,
Never even cared to take you as you are,
Crippling your life, treated you like nasty stray,
Refused to be their slave, you're labeled pariah.

Life has past, and all is gone,
And bleeding mind no longer cares,
And only labeled heart and crown of thorns
Still bring you back in your nightmares...

[CHORUS:]
Living in the hell they proudly call society,
Burning with the hate they've sown in your heart,
Trying to retain your life grain of sanity,
Which let you be yourself which stamps you pariah.

I've got no heart, I've got no thoughts, I've got no face,
I suffocate, I can't tear out from your embrace,
And day by day, through all my life I obey your will,
I'm just the one among the crowd you slowly kill.

[CHORUS.]
