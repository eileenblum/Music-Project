Here I am uncouth and wild
Here I am tolerant and mild
Look at me, your neglected child,
My hard-hearted Land of Lakes.
You gave me birth but drained my soul,
You cut my wings and let me fall,
Where are you, can't you hear my call,
Oh my callous Land of Lakes?
You bereaved my heart, shut up in jail,
You took my home to put up for sale,
Where is your love, will it prevail
In my cruel Land of Lakes?
You never showed you needed me,
You never loved and will never be,
You've killed your child can't you see,
My dear mother, my Land of Lakes?
Hey-ho, born to be your child,
Hey-ho, living through the aches,
Hey-ho, burn to be your child,
I hail you Land of Lakes!
