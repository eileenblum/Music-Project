[CHORUS:]
Stand for the nation brought to knees,
Oh the sons of courage,
Stand for the land where you were born!
Stand for the nation brought to knees,
Oh the sons of courage,
Stand for the land that you call home!

Hey, the land of enslaved nation,
Break your dream, open your eyes.
Rend the chains of humiliation,
From your bleeding knees arise!
How long you'll endure the pain
To burst out your martial moan?
How long will the tyrants reign
In my turned to prison home?

[CHORUS.]

Will I ever see the sunshine
Breaking thunder clouds wall?
Will be ever free the country,
My Native Land I proudly call?

[CHORUS.]
