[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik]

Unleashed the dogs of state,
Time to decide the fates.
Order's barked - come on the track,
Teeth barred for attack...
Arm of the law, he is order's seal.
Be humble to his just will.
Don't contradict, don't say a word -
You're nothing and he's mighty god! 

I am the law, I am the whore,
I'm servant to the one who pays me more.
I am the judge, I am the god,
So don't contradict to the dogs of justice! 

The hero of the street.
The stamp of truncheon's treat.
The system's faceless worm.
Mad dog in uniform!
So brave to shoot at armless crowd -
Ain't it good reason to be proud?
To beat a child won't flinch the hand - 
You are so strong! The real man! 

I am the law, I am the whore,
I'm servant to the one who pays me more.
I am the judge, I am the god,
So don't contradict to the dogs of justice!
Unleashed the hunt - so run aside -
Here come defenders of the human rights,
Here rules the law, the truncheon's law,
So fawn upon the king and his dogs of justice! 

"They serve the justice", you believe -
Don't be so artless so naive,
The crimes of state they'll never see,
They guard the state from you and me!
No - we don't need these laws!
No - we don't need these dogs!
No - we don't need this state!
That turns us into slaves!
