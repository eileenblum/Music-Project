[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik]

What is my life?
The gift of god?
Or is it curse, the endless rod?
What is my faith?
The light ahead
Or is it ravings of the mad? 

Now cold night's embracing me,
My bleeding eyes won't see,
And mist will never set me free -
Or where are you to stand by me? 

What is my strive?
Oh, will I win?
Or will I lose in everything?
What is the strap
I proudly hale?
Will I survive or will I fail? 

Where is my love, my only one?
Oh, who's to tell me why it's gone?
Where are my friends?
They didn't stay,
They took my soul then did betray... 

Take me, hold me, help me - 
Tell me who I am!
Touch me, hold me, save me -
Tell me where I am! 

Hold me - oh, hold me tight!
Help me - I can't see the light!
Take me - and set me free!
Save me - please stand by me!
