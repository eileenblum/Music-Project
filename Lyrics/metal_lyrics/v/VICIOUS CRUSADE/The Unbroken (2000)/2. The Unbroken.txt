[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik, Alex Vertel]

Beat me - I will stand,
Burn me - I'll survive,
I fight for my land -
One won't stop my strive! 

Standing hand in hand,
Led by fathers' faith,
We fight for our land
That won't stand disgrace! 

I have seen the hordes
Conquering my land.
Saw how my home burnt - I did.
Felt the shackles' weight
Bow me to the ground.
Heard the moan of death
Trying to fright me. 

See me lie in dirt
See me on my knees,
But won't see me lose
My faith!
Kill me but my land
Won't kneel in disgrace.
You can't stop the fight -
Fight for homeland!
