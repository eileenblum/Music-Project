[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik &amp; Alex Vertel]

I can see nothing through my blurried sight...
Just hear the pain growling from inside...
I feel the needle tapping my vein...
I try to drop it but hear it calls again!
And I am master, ruler in my own world,
I am the judge and jury, I reign and behold,
No one to chase me, sue me, hunt for my soul
In perfect world of mine...
What is that shadow crawling to me from the mist?
Or is it mirror, my reflection turned to beast?
What are these voices turning to the chilling scream?
Is it reality or is it just a dream? 

They say they will cure it.
They say "he'll endure it"
They've done it thousand times before.
Locked up - no temptation, kept in isolation,
They say "The beast will come no more!" 

But someday doors are opened,
Someday [he'll] cherish hope and
Someday he'll resist no more.
And drop licks the needle,
Veins burn in fiddle -
He's gone to rule his "perfect" world. 

And it rolls...
And it calls...
Now it's closed -
Vicious Circle... 

I can see nothing through my blurried sight...
Just hear the pain growling from inside...
I feel the needle tapping my vein...
I try to drop it but hear it calls again...
