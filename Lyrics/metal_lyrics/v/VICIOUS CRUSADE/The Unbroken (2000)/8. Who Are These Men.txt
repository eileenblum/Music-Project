[Lyrics Dmitry Basik]

Who are these men marching on streets
Under the flags of my land?
Confronting the state, the state of the jails,
Standing for freedom's defend?
Clenched are the fists, resist in the minds
And flame in the heart burns bright.
Nothing will stop these men on the streets - 
For nation, for freedom, for homeland they fight! 

Raised from the ashes,
Born by years of grief,
Brought up by pain,
And the true belief.
Forged in the jails,
Firmed by truncheons' beats,
We are the men revolting on the streets! 

Who are these men hunted by law,
Standing the truncheons' beats rain?
Putting at stake their fates and their lives,
Despising the bites of the pain?
Who are these men marching on streets
With flags of the glory and grace?
No man will forbid, no truncheon defeat
The men of unshakable faith!
