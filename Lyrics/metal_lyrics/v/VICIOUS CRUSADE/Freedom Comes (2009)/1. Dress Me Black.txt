[lyrics by Dm. Basik, Al. Vertel]

You hate to see me dressed in black,
But now I'm ready to fight back.
It's time for you to realize
That there will be no compromise.

I won't do things you want me to.
Will not become the one like you.
I'm dressed in black, but not to grieve.
I'm dressed to stand for my belief.

[Chorus:]
I'm dressed in black.
I'm not like you, not from your track.
And if you're brave enough to hate me,
Wishing to exterminate me,
If you dare â you must know I'll hit you back.

You tried to ruin all my life,
But gave me reason to survive.
You gave me strength I'd never had.
So, here I am not broken yet!

[Chorus]

We get stronger,
We get stronger day by day.
We get stronger,
We will do it our way.

Now...

[Chorus]
