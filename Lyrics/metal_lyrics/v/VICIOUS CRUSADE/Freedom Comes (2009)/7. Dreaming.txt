[lyrics by Dm. Basik]

I can see you so real standing right by my side. I do.
And I swear I can feel every beat of your heart. I do.
I reach out to touch you, to catch, to embrace you,
To never let go, never miss, never chase you...
I try to drown, to get lost in your eyes.

As the years go by and the memories fade away,
No more tears to cry, no more words have been left to say.
And still I reach out to touch you, to catch, to embrace you,
To never let go, never miss, never chase you...
I try... Hating to think that you died.

And you whisper the words that can only be told by you.
I am losing control 'cos you mean whole world. You do.
I reach out to touch you, to catch, to embrace you,
To never let go, never miss, never chase you...
And I scream: why is it only a dream?

[Chorus:]
Dreaming â it's where I meet you since you're gone.
Dreaming â the only place where we belong.
Dreaming â it's where the time for us has stopped.
Dreaming â oh Lord, please don't wake me up.

[Chorus]

(Don't wake me...)
