[lyrics by Dm. Basik]

What if I love you for one day?
Just close my eyes and slip away.
I have been waiting for so long â
Who cares if it's wrong?
What if I love you for one day?

I need to fall in love with you.
It will be madness if I do.
But it will be the only way
To suffer through this day.
I need to fall in love with you.

To feel you by my side until the morning light,
With all my life to share and all my dreams to dare.
In need of no one else. So far away from hell
I've been to. Just me and you,
The one to challenge my despair...

[Chorus:]
...And me, I feel so lone, so goddamn lone.
I cried but nobody cared.
I ask just for one day, one single day.
I cried but nobody shared.

We will be parted with the dawn. (Lost and broken)
We will not try to carry on. (No words spoken)
Before it pains me to see how you start hating me.
Before I feel that love is gone...

It's just one day for love. To love and off to go.
One day to feel alive and die till rest of life.
One day for newborn dawn when I won't feel alone.
Just one day for life to live. But it's enough, enough for me...

[Chorus]

It's just one day for love. To love and off to go.
One day to feel alive and die till rest of life.
One day for newborn dawn when I won't feel alone.
Just one day for life to live. But it's enough, enough for me...

[Chorus]

Cutting veins with razor's edge. Dancing on the burning ledge.
Suicide â it won't change anything at all.
Just one day to feel alive. One more reason to survive.
One more day that won't change anything at all.
