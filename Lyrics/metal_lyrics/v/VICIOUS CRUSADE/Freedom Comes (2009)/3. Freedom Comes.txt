[lyrics by Dm. Basik &amp; Al. Vertel]

It came down like a hurricane,
Like an earthquake, freezing rain,
Like a flood, like a lava flow,
Like one crushing fatal blow.

Born by will chained,
Pride disdained,
Tears by misery drained
And the soul they slain.

With the moaning, with the growling,
With a taste of blood on broken lips,
In the clothing smell from a prison cell,
And with bruises from shackle clips,
With eyes looking straight at cruel fate,
With an open heart that resists their hate,
With the spirit that has been reborn,
Brought from exile it marches on.

[Chorus:]
Freedom comes! Freedom comes!
Ringing bells, banging drums.
With love shining from her eyes,
Making us arise,
The Freedom comes!

Did you see them young and old?
Those betrayed, forsaken, sold,
Those who came to change the world
Challenging despair?

Born by will chained,
Pride disdained,
Tears by misery drained
And the soul they slain.

[Chorus]

Like a hurricane,
Like a freezing rain,
Like a lava flow,
Destroying you...

[Chorus]
