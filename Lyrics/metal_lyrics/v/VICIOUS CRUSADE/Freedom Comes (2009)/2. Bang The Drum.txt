[lyrics by Dm. Basik]

I had sex, I took drugs, I played rock'n roll.
Everything that grooves and rocks â I've had it all.
From paradise I was expelled â it was too calm for me.
And I refused to burn in hell for little was my fee.

It's the beating of my heart, it's the flowing of my blood,
It's my soul I put at stake that let me rise when I fall
and give me strength the whole world to shake!

I fought with Che Guevara. With Lennon I rolled dice.
I've got the Holly Bible signed to me by Jesus Christ.
I've seen too much in too few years and now I die from bore.
I've had it all but still I ask for more.

[Chorus:]
And if the world blows up, it will not make me stop.
I want to walk my way.
The rebel I was born, the rebel I'll be gone.
Be gone but not today!

Hey, come out to shake the world
Where faith is lost and souls are sold.
Hey come out to live your lives
Pushed to the limit, to never die.
To live and never die!

[Chorus:]
And if the world blows up, it will not make me stop.
I want to walk my way.
The rebel I was born, the rebel I'll be gone.
With all the words I say and all the songs I play
I'll die but not today!
