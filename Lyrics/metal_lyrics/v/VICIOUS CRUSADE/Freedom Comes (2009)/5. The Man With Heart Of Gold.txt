Forgive him father but he's got to go.
He needs to tell you something you should know.
The time has come, he can no longer wait.
His friends they need him on the barricades.

Forgive him mother, but with all your love
You cannot stop him, you won't stop him now.
The time has come and plans can't be deranged.
Forgive him mother, nothing can be changed.

And his eyes were shining brighter than a hundred suns.
Life finally had sense. His life had just begun.
All he wanted was to be forgiven and understood.
So he left his home and off he went for good...

And friends on barricades... They were not there.
Somehow for something else they had to care.
But left alone the kid refused to run â
He learnt from books that all the brave die young.

To be forgiven... To be understood...
His friends, they said that soldiers wouldn't shoot!

[Chorus:]
Force your way! Time is yours!
Streets are calling!
Triumph justifies the cost â
Leave guns roaring!
Ask the kid, young and brave,
To be another hero to feed the grave.
Doing all he can, he'll die like real man
For his true friends.

And his eyes were shining
brighter than a hundred suns.
Life finally had sense.
His life had just begun.
All he wanted was to be
forgiven and understood.

(So he left his home and off...)

Shoot 'em!

[Chorus]

Aim! Fire! Aim! Fire!
Aim! Fire! Aim! Fire!

...And died like real man
for his true friends.
