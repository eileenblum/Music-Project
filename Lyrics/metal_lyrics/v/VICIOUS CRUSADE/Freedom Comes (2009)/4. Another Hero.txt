[lyrics by Dm. Basik &amp; Al. Vertel]

Pleased we've met. You will never regret.
I'm the man with the heart of gold.
Trust in me, I will make you feel free.
I'm the man who will change your world.
Take my hand â it will feed and defend,
It will show what is to be done.
If you want me to stay, I will rule â you'll obey.
Let us play, sure it will be fun.

You are the one! You are the one! Teach me!
You are the one! The only one! Preach me!
What's to be done? What's to be done? Tell me!
And I will do, I'll die for you! Tell me to!

[Chorus:]
And rising fists come crashing,
Thoughtless fists come smashing,
Faceless fists come thrashing,
Everything that once was known as YOU!

Stand upright for the future is bright.
Close your eyes and you'll see it's real.
Sing a song â it will muffle the moan
Of dissent that will soon be healed.
Step inside. What a place to abide!
Prison walls make you feel secure.
Dream away from the thoughts of the day.
Sleep of thoughts is your ultimate cure.

You are the one! You are the one! Teach me!
You are the one! The only one! Preach me!
What's to be done? What's to be done? Tell me!
And I will do, I'll die for you! Tell me to!

[Chorus]

Keep mouth shut or your tongue will be cut â
Simple rules for the simple game.
Don't step forth or the things go worse.
You look beautiful when all the same.
Why make noise? You should better rejoice!
You have never ever felt so free.
Young and proud, why don't you shout it loud
"I'm in love with my slavery!"

You are the one, the one â teach me!
You are the one, the one â preach me!
You are the one, the one â tell me!
YOU ARE THE ONE!

The man with heart of gold...

I'll die for you! Just tell me to!
