[lyrics by Dm. Basik &amp; Al. Vertel]

Don't you have the feeling that it's time to hit the lights
And let the amplifiers blow the silence of the night?
Feels like rocking â no more talking! Let us make it real.
Join the crowd, quake the ground, let me feel what you feel!

Gonna get hot. So, are you ready to get wet?
Let me see you getting wild, raising up the dead.
Let me see you moving to the riffs of my guitar
And you will see me grooving 'cos we both know who we are.

[Chorus]
Hey-ho, burn with the fever! Hey-ho, burn baby burn!
We're gonna rock you up! Blow up your receiver!
Gonna rock you down to the bones!

It's time to leave the party for the after party show.
This is where the fevered minds really start to blow.
We don't even think of resting till the party's through.
Let's make it clear: we are here just to do like you do.

Gonna get hot. So, we are ready to get wet.
You will see us getting wild, raising up the dead.
We'll let you see your bodies rocking till the very end.
So be sure to be there when we feel like doing it again.

[Chorus]

Raise your hands in the air, show me what I need.
Let me see the wild crowd rocking to the beat.
Raise your hands in the air, let me hear your yell.
Let me see the crowd not afraid to burn in Hell!

Keep on moving all night long.
Grooving till the break of dawn.

Raise your hands in the air, show me what I need.
Let me see the wild crowd rocking to the beat.
Raise your hands in the air, let me hear your yell.
Let me see the crowd not afraid to burn in Hell!

If you want to let it out,
if you want to scream and shout,
If you want to rock your body,
then get ready â you have got it!

Let me see all of you rocking to the beat.
Raise your hands in the air â that's what I need.
Let me hear all of you singing along,
Let me hear you screaming out
"ROCK YOU UP" song!

[Chorus]
