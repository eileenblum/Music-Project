[lyrics by Dm. Basik]

Wish I could, had a chance
To die for one day just in pretence.
To see them cry and regret.
So I could say: I'm not dead yet!

Did you ever cut veins with a wreck of your hope?
Did you see how life trains to the collar of rope.
Did you look in the eyes of the abyss in front?
One step forward to fly, just the very last stunt.

Did you wish you could try?
Did you wish you could die?
Did you wish you had strength to commit suicide?
And to see them all cry
over you and your life that they've lost!

[Chorus:]
For the last time
Clench your fists for the final fight.
For the last time
Bare teeth for the final bite.
For the last time
Pull your strength, gather all your might.
For the last time
Challenge life and don't die!

Make disposable love. Have disposable fun.
Sing disposable songs to disposable ones.
Dream disposable dreams that will never come true.
Live disposable life of disposable you.

Did you wish you could try? Did you wish you could die?
Did you wish you had strength to commit suicide?
And to see them all cry over you and your life that they've lost!

[Chorus]

I want to see you cry (You want to see us cry)
Grieving that I died (Grieving that you died)
Regretting that you've lost (Regretting that we've lost)
The one you loved the most (The one we loved the most)

Wish I could, had a chance
To die for one day just in pretence.
To see them cry and regret.
So I could say: I'm not dead yet!

For the last time...
For the last...
