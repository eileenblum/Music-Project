[words taken from the New Testament]

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
For they shall be satisfied.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall comforted.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you
And say all kinds of evil against you falsely on account of Me.
But woe to you who are rich,
For you are receiving your comfort in full.
Woe to you who are well fed now, for you shall be hungry.
Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.
Woe to you when all men speak well of you,
For in the same way their fathers used to treat the false prophets.
