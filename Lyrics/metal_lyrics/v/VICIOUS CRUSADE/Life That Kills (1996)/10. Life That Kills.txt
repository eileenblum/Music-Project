[lyrics by Elena, D. Basik, An. Kanapilov]

The flashers of the dawn I see new day's arising but not for me,
I'll look no longer at the blazing vault of heaven.
Now everything's gone and this is the end,
To put the point won't flinch the hand,
My time has come and soon I'll leave forever...
Maintenant que je vois les reflets de l'aurore
D'un jour qui va naitre, pas plus pour mon coeur.
Je regarderai, pas longtemps, cette voute de l'Amour...
Toute chose disparue, c'est la fin qui en suit,
Un gros point final est bien deja mis,
Mon temps expire, et jo dois m en aller pour toujours.
...and it was the third hour when
they crucified him. And the
inscription of charge against him
read: The King of the Jews. And
those who passing by were hurling
abuse at him, wagging their heads
and saying, "You who are going to
destroy the temple and rebuild it in
three days, save yourself and
come down from the cross."
