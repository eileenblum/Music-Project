[lyrics by D. Basik &amp; Al. Vertel]

Despotism of power, ideology's dictate,
Triumph of the suffering, violence and hate,
Freedoms are abolished, objection's an offence,
The only way to stay alive's implict obedience.

[CHORUS:]
Hate, violence, opprecion, despair, misery, dipression,
Suspiciousness, dismay, personality's decay,
You're obedient faceful slave.

You persecute your father, your neighbour you defame,
In the hunt on public enemies hound is your name,
Your tyrant is your prophet, his power is your pride,
You suffocate, deteriorate, hate him deep inside.

[CHORUS.]

Oh so paltry thy look in the faceless crowd,
Thy protest, desperate cry dare not say aloud,
Faceful beast, deaf and blind, faceless without me,
Doomed to live and to die in thy slavery...
