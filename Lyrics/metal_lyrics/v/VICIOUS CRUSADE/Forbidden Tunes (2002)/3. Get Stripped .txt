[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik]

Born in sin - just come on in.
Let loose the demons from within.
Show me the you that no one knows,
Come on, let's see how far it goes!
You lick my skin until it bleeds,
Reveal the filth your body breeds,
Suck into me your horny seeds... 
[Chorus:]
Get stripped! Roll over me,
Come taste my flesh your vicious way!
Get stripped! You turn me on,
You take me high until I'm done -
Get stripped! 
Come, kiss the pulp of forbidden fruit.
The things we did, it's just prelude.
Let's make the love not seen before -
I'm sex machine, you be my whore!
You vamp me to your vile bed,
You shake me, make me hot and wet,
Caress me the way that will drive me mad... 
[Chorus.]
Round and around, roll me round and round again
Hammer me down, up and down and down again. 
Until I'm done.
The virtues of devil are in his lies.
Oh, so sweet you are. Oh, so hot you are. 
Round and around, roll me round and round again
Hammer me down, up and down and down again. 
Get stripped! Stripped! Stripped! Stripped!
Get stripped! Stripped! God damn stripped!
Get stripped! Stripped! Stripped! Stripped!
Get stripped! Stripped! Get you god damn stripped!
