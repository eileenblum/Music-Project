[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik &amp; Alena Gornyh]

If you see me dead blind, if you find me insane,
Wildly dancing on ledge of the house in flame.
Will you stay next to me when there's no one around?
Will you dance by my side when the ledge crashes down? 
Why have we ever been there? Lent to each other's embrace,
Just helpless puppets we've been dragged from quite different plays.
When she looked deep - he looked high... them someone tried to unite.
Two blind birds in the sky told they would see the sun light. 
So close and so strange, so far and so dear,
Too false to be true, so wrong to be real.
Why did we say? Why did we pray each other
Fly, fly Bonny!
Together apart, with the love we would treat,
Or was it the love that deserved to be bred?
To hear it sound, hear it resound to us
Die, die Bonny! 
[Chorus:]
Dancing on the ledge
Like dancing on the ledge 
Did not we know from the start? Who did we try to deceive?
Or did we cherish that hope? Say, did we really believe?
Say we would need it so much just having nothing to choose...
...It was so easy to dream when we had nothing to lose.
Too false to be true while being so real,
Too far and so close while feeling so weird,
Why did we say? Why did we pray each other
Fly, fly, Bonny!
But losing it all, will we ever regret?
Losing that "something" we never had.
Can hear it sound, hear it resound to us
Die, die Bonny! 
[Chorus.]
Say, will you be there when the ledge crashes down?
Dancing with me till we fall to the ground?
Will I hear you say, hear you pray me
Fly, fly Bonny!
Never so close to the last time we part,
Never so true being wrong from the start.
Let's hear it sound, hear it resound to us
Die, die Bonny! 
[Chorus.]
