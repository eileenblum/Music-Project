[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik &amp; Alex Vertel]

I feel you scream of me. I feel you dream of me.
You want, you wish, you long - it bursts out from within.
I am your secret place, your real sweetest face.
I am the one you once have been. 
I'm your forbidden tunes. Desires turned to wounds.
I am your cherished dreams. Dreams that didn't come true.
I am your feelings trod. Your moan that was not heard.
Your will trapped inside of you.
Another wish - another cut. Feels like it's end but it's just start.
Another wish, another dream. Another "don't" to hollow scream.
Another eyes just looking nowhere. 
[Chorus:]
Away, far away, far away there is somewhere.
Away, far away there's a dream, there is me.
I'm real, I can feel, just can feel there is someday.
When I, still alive, flying free wish to be... 
I am your razor scars, your slashes left from bars,
Your knees that bleed from prayers - see me everywhere.
The preaching slap in face. Reproach, rebuke, disgrace.
I am all you want but do not dare. 
[Chorus]
Live like others, love like others, do like others do.
See like others, be like others. Do, like others do... 
[Chorus]
