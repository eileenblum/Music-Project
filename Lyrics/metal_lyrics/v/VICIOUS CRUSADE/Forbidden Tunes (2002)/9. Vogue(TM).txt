[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik]

Stylish deeds, stylish words.
Stylish dreams and stylish thoughts.
Stylish life for stylish world.
Stylish faith for stylish God. 
Vogue is your own mind, moral charts.
Vogue is your own soul finest arts.
Vogue is sense of being, goal to strive.
Vogue is manual for your own life. 
Vogue. It's vogue. Just vogue.
It is just vogue, nothing personal. 
Stylish feelings, stylish taste.
Stylish love and stylish hate.
Stylish values for stylish people...
Stylish being for spiritual cripples! 
Vogue for me, vogue for you, vogue for everything we do.
Vogue for everything we are - welcome the VOGUE-mania! 
Vogue is your own mind. Vogue's what makes you blind.
Vogue is sense of being. Vogue's what you believe in. 
Choose the style, choose the brand.
Follow fashion, follow trend.
Get the label, trade-mark sign -
Get the stand in Mainstream Line!
Vogue's your own mind. Vogue's what makes you blind.
Vogue is sense of being. Vogue's what you believe in.
