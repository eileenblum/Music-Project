[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik &amp; Alex Vertel]

Putting the stakes till the point when I lose.
Risking it all till I have to pay dues. 
Fly real high till the day when I fall.
If tomorrow I die - does it matter at all? 
If I burn then to the ashes I burn.
If I do the first step then I never return.
I fall in love for the very last time.
So what do I lose if tomorrow I die?
[Chorus:]
Take it all or lose it at once.
Taste it all - it can be your last chance. 
If you got the wings - so why don't you fly?
If I live - then I live like tomorrow I die,
And I live like I live last day of my life.
On top speed, down the fastest highway,
Be it heaven or hell that I raise on my way,
Till last breath, on the full overdrive
I live every single day of my life. 
[Chorus.]
...And I live like I live like tomorrow I ain't gonna die! 
While I've got the way to go I ain't gonna stop this show.
While I've got the fuel to drive I ain't gonna stop my life.
