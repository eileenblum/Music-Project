[Lyrics by Dmitry Basik &amp; Alex Vertel]

Let's go...
Sex, drugs, rock 'n roll. Born to trigger public toll,
I'm the one - one against all.
I live my own day, I walk my own way,
And I shout out loud my own call. 
Out from Nowhere Land, straight to the dead end,
Right through the point of no return.
Fake's my past, got no name. Ain't no future, ain't no aim.
I've been lost since the day I was born.
In the world of lost illusions I was born for revolutions.
[Chorus:]
This is our new world, our life.
This is our own way, our drive.
This is our new point of destination.
This is world of the Lost Generation.
This is our free love, love for all.
This is our own rise, our fall.
This is our new point of destination.
This is world of the Lost Generation. 
Bombs dropped for freedom's sake,
"True Belief" that one can't take,
Sacrifice our lives for breaking the score.
They shut the doors, they built the walls.
Shoot our sky with pollution balls.
And now they dare say we are even worse! 
[Chorus.]
In the world of lost illusions I was born for revolutions.
[Chorus.]
