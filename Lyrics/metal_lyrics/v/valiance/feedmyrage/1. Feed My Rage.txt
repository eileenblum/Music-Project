[Lyrics by Marco De Angelis]

Wearing sneaky words to deceive
Hangman dressed up as saint
Lies, cold sons of hypocrisy
Sink your blade through my veins
I've been tasting scorn an' shame
A black bite from within
Now I'm wishing you the same
A dark, deep hole to jump in
Now it's time for you to hide
Your attitude to crawl
Think your flying high in light
But you're truly going to fall
I've been tasting scorn an' shame
A black bite from within
Now I'm wishing you the same
A dark, deep hole to jump in
