[Lyrics by Gian Paolo Costantini]

And the curtain rises
I smell the audience warm
While I spread my arms
Enslaved in this shadow
All you can see is my mask
Prison of my life
Hear this rumbling sound
Getting lost through the stage
It's only a tear impacting reality
Playing the same role
The same farce goes on
Forget the right way
Behind that door
Playing the same role
The same farce goes on
Enslaving me in a lieful prose
Hidden behind a joke
My secret garden's burning
Burning from inside
Enslaved in this shadow
In this endless script
Full of silent lines
