[Lyrics by Amedeo De Angelis]

No more!
It can't be done, it can't be done again
Once... I went fallin' crashed &amp; burned
Twice... it can't be real
Pulling illusion away from me
No way to lick my wounds
Who let this brutal dream come true
Must cross my eyes
What the hell is going on
Need an answer from above
Tell me why
Ain't no scream to cry my rage
Ain't no god to stop my race
Will I react for the end?
Tell me why
Ain't no scream to cry my rage
Ain't no god to stop my race
Will I walk this road again?
It would be an incredible event
A mirror reflects a shade
I'll purify my blood again
I'll get free from your shame
Show me your figure a step beyond
Now... here... to me!
Now it's time for you to pray
Dare to walk my way!
What the hell is going on
Need an answer from above
Tell me why
Ain't no scream to cry my rage
Ain't no god to stop my race
Will I react for the end?
Tell me why
Ain't no scream to cry my rage
Ain't no god to stop my race
Will I walk this road again?
