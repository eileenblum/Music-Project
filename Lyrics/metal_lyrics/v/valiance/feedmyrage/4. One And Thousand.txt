[Lyrics by Marco De Angelis]

Thousand doors stand close around you
They keep locked away your aims
Everyone turns into anyone
One and thousand rise from within
Let your days slide like winter rain
Losing yourself and miss today
Your glance will fall deep down to lake
Reflecting a faded life
One last unware mask
To start another play
One more step left to take
Then throw yourself away
You learnt to hide as identity in disguise
But you can't run away yourself
I crack my brain just to understand
Twisting turning... I'm driving mad
