Claustrophobic walking
search for my own treasure land
Mystifying visions
I try to break this gloomy spell

Feel like suffocating
Caught by all these airy bars
Grab my last emotions
Inner whispers turn to cries

My rage increases more and more
I find myself as prisoner
The free men's cage has locked its door
Gotta try to make my way home

Conventional environment
Belongs to me no more
Proclaiming your own judgements
Spreading as the "Holy Words"
