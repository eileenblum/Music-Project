Dolly's searching for its father or its maker
who built a life without life
Who can't stop who tries to open us the door
but they should wonder: "Why?"

Every time we are close
to an answer
the snow falls

A secret stands unknown,
covered by perpetual snow
While scientists have no rest
replicating human life

All I need is that hot sun shine
And that spring let the snow melt
Once and for all.
All I want is to understand
Why a life's got a dawn
And an ending point.

We have heard the hurt Giant imploring
its blind anger giving off
We have seen any riddle solved
any truth disbelieved

Every time we are close
to an answer
the snow falls

A secret stands unknown,
covered by perpetual snow
While scientists have no rest
replicating human life
