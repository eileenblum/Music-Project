I believed in afterlife, it was an undisputed law
I believed in a destination, for all souls' journey

An eternal wind starts to sweep all away
I feel like walkin' the middle of an infinite breath

Neverending flame of my life
Endless river that will never dive into the sea

Now I'm enemy against death, enemy against life
Sky is only a vault, the flame's burnin' no one
