Rain has just stopped,
Biting wind come
Mark of a changing season.
Sun to its den gets
With no prey caught
And a tear runs over its mouth

My skin is naked
Ice stings my body
And night is ready to fall
I feel so weak now
My wings so heavy
I'm falling

Memory is a child
Fallen from his golden could
On the separating line between
Freedom. Jail.

Fly away, if you can change the law
Gates of winter are wide open
To snare your little soul

Mankind will be
Grateful to you
Shined by dreams and illusions
If you don't want to grow up
And loose your power
Hold out! Don't come in

Memory is afraid now
One step on would make him a man
But the gorge one step behind is a
Black hole.

Sacrifice would save the whole mankind
And you would stay, you would stay
A child forever
Fly away, if you can change the law
Gates of winter are wide open
To snare your little soul

Gates of winter get closer
And the sound become louder
Memory's doubt to be solved
"go ahead" or "game over"?

Farewell!!!!!!
