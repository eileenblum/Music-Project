I'm walking alone,
crossing the wood of my mind
My bearings I've lost,
my memory is naked and blind

Dark trees stand in front of my eyes
now are getting taller and taller
I feel so cold...
I'm looking for fire, a small house trying
to find a rest in my endless way

I should learn to hate who stabbed me in the back,
To stand to the siren, like Ulysses did.
I should learn to get away from your eyes

I have never had
any lesson by my memories:
but, like the North Star,
their light is the guide on my path

Nothing right, nothing wrong
I have always followed my drive
not wondering why
I'm searching for a place where I could stay with my past
contemplating foys and mistakes

I should learn to hate who stabbed me in the back,
To stand to the siren, like Ulysses did.
I should learn to get away from your eyes
I should wipe out all my footprints in the sand;
But no one will be able to
Not even you, not even you.
Never!
