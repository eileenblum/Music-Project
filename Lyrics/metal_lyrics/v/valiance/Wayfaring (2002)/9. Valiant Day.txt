I can't watch this sky
It screams a silent word, without face, cold and bright
I can't watch this sky
Stone up on my soul, waitin' nevermore

So come mighty storm, blow me away

Never watch this sky
Little child of war, leave your winter behind
Never askin' why
And wait the saving call, the last nature's dawn

So come mighty storm, blow me away

Feel the spirit crumbles down

So come mighty storm, blow me away
I will return... valiant day
