Who is responsible for all this mess
Is it manmade or something that our brains can not digest
This is the time, this is the place
Is this the way it's supposed to be
Will it begin to make sense on the sad day when we leave
I want to meet your God face to face
Are we simply lost, misguided bastard children
Why have you forsaken me

Why do we torture innocent animals
When there's an overload of murdering convicts
These pieces of shit should be used as our experiments
Why do we spend so much on weight loss programs
Eat what you want but not like a slob
Then send the rest to the commercial for the ones who starve

This is the time
This is the place
I want to meet your God
Face to face

Why do we support a party keeping us buried at rock bottom
Why the fuck should these corporate assholes get tax breaks
While the rest of us can't even afford to drive

Why don't we burn every goddamn institution down
We want the truth
Or we will crush the fucking lies

Who is responisible for all this mess
Is it manmade or something our brains can not digest
This is the time, this is the place
Is this the way it's supposed to be
Will it begin to make sense on the sad day when we leave
I want to meet your God face to face
Are we simply lost, misguided bastard children
Why have you forsaken me

All this human sin has clouded your vision
Or is this what you've always seen
Where the fuck have you disappeared to
Where are you hiding or have we just hidden you
There is no power
There is no glory
This is not Earth
This is Purgatory
Why don't you care anymore
Why won't you come and disprove
All of these fucking vicious lies
