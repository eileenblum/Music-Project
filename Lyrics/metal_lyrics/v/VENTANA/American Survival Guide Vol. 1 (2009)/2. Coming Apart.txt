I'm a little teapot short and stout
Smash me apart and fucking spill me out
I'm a piece of shit
I'm a fucking mess
I'm a little wounded bird
I fell out of my nest

I've been busy tearing out my motherfucking mind
Don't wanna kill myself
Want to rip out my fucking eyes

To all the noises that live here
And the answers in my brain
To all the TV cameras
And the innocence they play
To the fucking cults
To the pop star teens
To the crooked politicians and the ones who believe

I've been busy tearing out my motherfucking mind
Don't wanna hurt myself
Want to rip out my fucking eyes

No other motherfucker gonna take me down now
When I am perfectly capable of destroying myself

Don't you fucking look at me
Your pity driven stare
I'm fucking flesh and blood
I'm just a man without a care

There's nothing to see here
So pass the fuck on by
You're so obsessed with money
But you can't take it when you die

'Cause in the end we're all the same
You're nothing better than me
We all get thrown into a hole
Six feet deep

I've been busy tearing out my motherfucking mind
Don't wanna shoot myself
Want to rip out my fucking eyes

No other motherfucker gonna take me down now
When I am perfectly capable of destroying myself

My eyes are sore
From all the shit I can't ignore
I feel I'm losing my vision
Don't let me hurt myself anymore

'Cause when I'm gone, the world is dead
I am God, you are shit
I am God, the world is dead
I am God, you are shit
