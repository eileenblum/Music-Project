Why are we so fucking needy?
Why are we so fucking greedy?
Overdressed
Expressionless
All the sinners win
Why are we so fucking needy?
Why are we so fucking greedy?
Trap yourself in a world of vanity
Vomit from your mouth and pull your face off the floor again.

I try to tell myself it's not real but the actions are speaking to me clearer than words ever could. It's time we pull together for one last dance on this filthy fucking planet. I'm not coming home.

Fuck intelligence
Fuck equality
Fuck precedence
Fuck charity
Fuck expectations
Fuck segregation
Fuck misdirections
Fuck your vicious intentions

The pictures always so shameful
Their just ugly, filthy on the inside, shameful
So distorted to me
You're an empty vessel covered on flesh
Full of ridicule, embarrassment
You're a card, a number, a birth certificate.
A stereotype to scared to question it.

You're just a name and a number to them
So fall right in
You don't think that it's deceiving
But believe me when I say this mirror is lying.
