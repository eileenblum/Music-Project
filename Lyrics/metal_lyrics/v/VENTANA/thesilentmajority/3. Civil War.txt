Here we go as we stack another problem.
No one's coming to save you
Rise up separate you from the sleaze.
Rise up to the American Dream.

Took away our choice
So here's our offering
There's nothing left for you.
There's nothing left for you.
We will scream these words
Scream theses word to me
But here's I offering
We declare war on you

All alone as the ashes stack and crumble
They'll hold you down
Rise up separate you from the sleaze
Rise up to the American Dream
Here we go as we stack another problem
No ones coming to save you
Rise up separate you from the sleaze
Rise up to the American Dream

Work so hard but now the ignorance rose up
I understand this better now.
