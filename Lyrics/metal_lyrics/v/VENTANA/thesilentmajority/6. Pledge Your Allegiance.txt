And to the republic for which it stands
Left piss poor for a few rich men
One nation under god
Tax raped, low class, carpenter lord
With liberty and justice for all
Micro-chipped, enforced marshal law
Hand over your heart, get down on your knees....
Blame us, drain us, just say that we're free
Degrade us, deface us, just say that we're free
Entertain us, we'll eat the shit you feed
Inject us, reject us, just say that we're free
Worship the symbol, the mark of the beast
Sewn together with blood and bigotry
Waving it's freedom and hypocrisy
Pledge your allegiance, get down on your knees
Slap gods name on the corruption and greed
A truly brilliant marketing strategy
Made in China, as seen on TV
Turn the other cheek, an eye for an eye
All for one, only the strong shall survive
Hooked on phonic, no child left behind
Illiterate politicians flashing pagan shrine
Cutthroat, yet united we stand
The scapegoat, disposable foreign lands
Hand over your heart, get down on your knees....
This fat fuck republic van barely stand
Nutrition preserved in a can
One nation under a fraud
Invisible bipolar God
With liberty and injustice for all
The prices rise while wages fall
With liberty and injustice for all
The price is right they stand we fall
Sing your country bumpkin songs
Driving to your shitty jobs
Eat your processed cancer plate
Masturbate and get to sleep or you'll be late
For the chemo in the morning
Use your benefits to get it over with
Brush one more time with the fluoride paste
And clear a fucking space
Cutthroat, the wall street gambling man
Bailout, the elite Ku Klux Klan
The red is the death of the heroes and fools
The white is the sight of our nuclear truth
The blue is the bruise of the troops that we use
And the stars are the whores of the Hollywood crews
You're just another numbered slave
Tracked by ultra violent rays
Sign your name, claim your disease
Pledge your allegiance, get down on your knees
