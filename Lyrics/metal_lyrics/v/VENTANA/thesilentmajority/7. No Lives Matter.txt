What are you fighting for?
What are you dying for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you dying for?
Evangelist Christians
Holy snake oil salesmen
Getting rich off of fiction
One with Christ by division
Piggy bank politicians
Contradiction magicians
Email investigation
Pussy grabbing violation
Ignorant health care system
Blue cross crucifixion
Out of pocket prescriptions
Medicated addictions
Rising collage tuition
Increasing home evictions
Small time incarceration
The days are dull in black and white
A bruising black and blue at night
The days are dull in black and white
A bruising black and blue at night
A nation of whiners
Abused by the winners
In the age of back-stabbers
No lives matter
People saving lives make a starvation wage
While people taking lives are demanding a raise
People saving lives make a starvation wage
While people taking lives are demanding a raise
Celebrity worship
Elections bought and rigged
Secret globalist
Investors' interest
People saving lives make a starvation wage
While people taking lives are demanding a raise
People saving lives make a starvation wage
While people taking lives are demanding a raise
We see how you butcher the truth
We can read the dripping proof
Evangelist Christians
Holy snake oil salesmen
Getting rich off of fiction
One with Christ by division
Piggy bank politicians
Contradiction magicians
Email investigation
Pussy grabbing violation
So what we're all gonna die anyway
But we won't live your goddamn way
So what we're all gonna die anyway
But we won't live your goddamn way
The days are dull in black and white
A bruising black and blue at night
The days are dull in black and white
A bruising black and blue at night
A nation of whiners
Abused by the winners
In the age of back-stabbers
No lives matter
No lives matter
No lives matter
The revolution of quitters
Nothing gets better
Real love is blood splatter
No lives matter
