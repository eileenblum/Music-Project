You're in a third world paradise
Their victory is our demise

Will we break away
To breathe and live again?
I'll see a brighter day

One time, we hear our voices dissolve
Chaos, louder than the tanks at your door

Left mindless and fractured
A system designed to take us out
We will not retreat
Here they come
My enemies are chasing, should I run or stay and fight?
Break away, I'll survive
I'll see a brighter day

We lie to kill
We lie for change
We lie to avoid taking blame
We lie to heal
We lie so we can feel again

So if my life is worthless to you, then let it be
For I am endless
And you are completely empty
