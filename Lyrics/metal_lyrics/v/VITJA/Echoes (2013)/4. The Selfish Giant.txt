My heritage
This is my castle
Till the end of time
This is my reign
Till the end of time
Forever
Till the end of time

White blossoms, dead bodies
Wither in loneliness, etherals are the sights
Hold on, my lonely giant
We'll bring no harm, just love, no strife

Can you listen?
May I pardon?
Open the gates
To your garden

Oh mighty giant can't you see?
Please let me play, it means everything to me

I am begging you

Mighty giant, tell me how do you live your life?
What have you done with all the lonely time?
You're paralyzed by that you call mine

Mighty giant, do you love your life?
No one comes, the children will hide

All children dead

All children are dead
