I can't breath
Lost in universe
Just like you deserve
Away from home

No gravity
I am feeling weightless
On the other side
I have to find myself in this
A world full of myths
Full of myths

Take one of my shattered moments
I thought I was guided (not alone)
Eyes bound where foot steps
Carry me home

I hear no voices
I hear no sounds
I try to reach my guidance
Through the clouds

I hear no sounds

I won't believe again
You're dead to me

Fuck

I won't believe again
You are dead to me

Where is my guidance
Where is the one anchored to my back
Thought you were here for my savior
To save me from the noose around my neck

Where is my guidance
Where is my savior

Protect me now
