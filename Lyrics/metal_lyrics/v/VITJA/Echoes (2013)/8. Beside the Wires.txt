There is more than just my own world
I saw beside the wires
Where I found the unknown worth
I found my empire
My empire

This must be interstellar
You can rise a sea
By only one raindrop
You can make
Summer turn to fall

In the next moment
I can't get up
In the next
I am too high to fall
Too high to fall

The skyline covered by your face
It feels like lovebugs
You told me back in the days
I left my diamonds
For you inside the wires
I hope they won't return as tears
Return as tears

It's not about that you are my wife
I don't want to be alone
This is to me so much more than life
With your words you paint in gold
It's not about that you are my wife
I just don't want to be alone
But I will die alone
Like everyone dies alone

(We will may end up alone
But close
I left my diamonds
For you inside the wires
I hope they won't return as tears
Return as tears)

There is more than just my own world
I saw beside the wires
Where I found the unknown worth
I found my empire
