I will never forget
Drugs as masters we as slaves
I can never change
But what happened won't happen again

We put you on an abandoned ship
While we were on a boat
We set your future
It was our fault

I still remember you when you said
Life is full of joy and there are so much things to see
We had no worries beside these walls
But things can change as I hold your brother in my arms

And in this moment
The angels started to sing
A song about what
A graceful person you've been
They sing this song I wrote
Cause they worship you
I say goodbye my friend
As I watch you sleeping in snow

After all we've got to know that you are never coming home

After all we've got know that you're never coming home
I hope you're watching us at least they all say
Thank you for all the time we shared
I hope we'll meet somewhere
Hidden place next decades
No one as master, no one as slave

Drugs as masters we as slaves
I can never change
But what happened won't happen again

We put you on an abandoned ship
While we were on a boat
We set your future
It was our fault
