You wanna know why I am so silent 
Why I used to swallow all of my words 
There is too much talk and only deaf ears 
It wouldn't make a difference 

I never found out what's right or wrong
Show me the place where I belong 

Can you cut the cord 
Can you show me what it's for? 
Take my hand,(and) let me discover inspiration 

Lead me 
And I will follow (wherever you go) (I will follow) 
Force me 
And you could find the deepest in me (deepest in me) 
Stand your ground 
When I agree please say no 

I never found out what's right or wrong
Show me the place where I belong 

They had it all 
Fucking false friends 
All 

Let's have a conversation I will ask and you will tell 
Save me from the gallows I'll save you from yourself

So here's the deal 

Save me from the gallows 
And I'll save you from yourself

Save me from the gallows
