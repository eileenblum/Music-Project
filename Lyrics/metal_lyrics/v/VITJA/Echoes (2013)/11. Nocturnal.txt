Now I see clearly
In this black mode
I can hide the splattered
Fractured pieces of me

Digging a hole
Uncage my mind
Addicted to bloodlust
I have to reset myself

I see clearly now
My life is fulfilled by night
Try to judge me
For what I have become
Try to judge me
For what I've become

I'm up to no good
I have to reset myself
I hate to live a life
In despair

No
I'm up to good

I have to reset myself
I hate to live a life
In despair

I don't want to live a life
In despair

I'm walking without consciousness
Like a stranger to myself
It's time to be the beast
To suck on your neck

It's time to be the beast
To suck on your neck
Get on your knees
And show some respect

Now I see clearly
In this black mode
I can hide the splattered
Fractured pieces of me

Digging a hole
Uncage my mind
Addicted to bloodlust
I have to reset myself

I see clearly now
My life is fulfilled by night
