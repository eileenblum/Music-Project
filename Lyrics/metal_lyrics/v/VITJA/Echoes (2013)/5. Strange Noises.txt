Strange noises in my head
They whisper to my ear
Forget who you are
Forget what you've been

Strange noises in my head
They whisper to my ear
Close your eyes and
Shut your fucking mouth
Right now

Close your doors, sweet children
And it starts to begin

My gain seems mesmerized
Like shadows in the dark
You can't enlighten the daylight
It's too late
After everything you put me through

Help me out
I can't do it on my own

Back and forth
I'm begging for forgiveness
I am caught in a spell

Right now
Back and forth

Strange noises in my head
They whisper to my ear
Forget who you are
Forget what you've been

Close your doors, sweet children
And it starts to begin

My gain seems mesmerized
Like shadows in the dark
You can't enlighten the daylight
It's too late
After everything you put me through
