I don't know what it was
To clutch at a straw
Moving forward a long way to fall
I'm no longer the mouse in your claws
I won't fail myself again
I can see the blue sky
I can breath within

Forever it will be denied for you
To enter my life
You say that I turn for nothing
At least nothing is something
At least

And you're not even nothing

I won't fail myself again
Went back to the start
Now I'm at the end
I can see clear to my head

Me as the corpse, you as the flesh
Me corpse
You flesh
Go

I don't know what it was
To clutch at a straw
Moving forward a long way to fall
I'm no longer the mouse in your claws
I won't fail myself again
I can see the blue sky
I can breath within

I only forgive just once
Now you know twice for your lifetime
I only forgive just once
Just once
I only forgive just once
I only forgive just once
I only forgive just once

Goodbye my soulmate
Clocks are running out of time
I have to leave for
What my soul craves for

I get older but I'm dead
Me as the corpse
You as the flesh
