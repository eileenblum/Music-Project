Passion
Let go
Obsession
Forgive Us

I can't win this fight
When you look into my eyes

Two bodies
Close by each other
Hands that touch so unpatiently

Two bodies
Close by each other
Hands that touch so unpatiently
Full adrenaline leaders are heartbeats
I'll eat you
And you'll eat me

We melt into one piece
I'll eat you
And you will eat me

Let's fuck
Away our sorrow
Let's fuck
Away our grief
Fuck

Innocence forgive us
It's not our fault
Regret is dripping
Down my tongue

This wasn't my destiny
How senseless and cheap

What have I become?
Where was the divine?
Where is the piece to combine?

Innocence forgive us
It's not our fault
Regret is dripping
Down our tongues

What have I become?
Where was the divine?
A piece shall be saved
For the one to combine

I regret
Obsession
Drowning in
Depression
