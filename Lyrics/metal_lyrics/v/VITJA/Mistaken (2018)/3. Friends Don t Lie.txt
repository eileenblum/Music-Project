It was written in blood
What doesn't mean it makes it any better
Oh no

For better or for worse
It's always better
When the truth comes out
I know it really hurts
It's always better
When the truth comes out

You said you'd never
Turn your back on me
You said you'd never
Cross your fingers again
I don't fucking care who you are
But what I know is that you're not my friend

Friends don't lie
Friends don't lie
'Cause friends don't lie
Oh no
'Cause friends don't lie
Friends don't lie
'Cause friends don't lie
Don't lie, don't lie

Now it's all torn apart
But I'm starting to feel a little bit better
I do

For better or for worse
It's always better
When the truth comes out
I know it really hurts
It's always better
When the truth comes out

You said you'd always
Come back for me
You said you'd never
Cross your fingers again
I've known it from the start
You're not my friend at all

Friends don't lie
Friends don't lie
'Cause friends don't lie
Oh no
'Cause friends don't lie
Friends don't lie
'Cause friends don't lie
Don't lie, don't lie

You crossed your fingers
Behind your back
You said that you mean it
It has never been for good

You already had me sold
But I won't fall again for this
'Cause now I know the truth

But I shouldn't give
A fuck about it anyway
A fuck about it anyway
A fuck about it anyway
A fuck about it anyway
A fuck about it anyway
A fuck about it anyway
Friends don't lie

Friends don't lie
Friends don't lie
'Cause friends don't lie
Oh no
'Cause friends don't lie
Friends don't lie
'Cause friends don't lie
Don't lie, don't lie
