Days passed by
There is nothing to feel
I can't help it
I can't help myself
I need a knife
To cut you out
When will this end

Each day I pray to the moon
That someday I'll come back to you
Each day I pray to the moon
That this will end

Will I see you again
In the shadows I will wait for you
Will I see you again
Will the saints lead me in

Will I see you again
In the shadows I will wait for you
Will I see you again
Will the saints lead me in

Each day I pray to the moon

Will I see you again
Will the saints lead me in

Will I see you again
In the shadows I will wait for you
Will I see you again
