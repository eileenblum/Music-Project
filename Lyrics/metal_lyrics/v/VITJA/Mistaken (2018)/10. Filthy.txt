You are filthy
You are filthy

This is a sinking ship
So the rats are the first to flee
Protected by innocence
Bliss and all their greed

In times of depression
The truth is all we got
But you keep messing with it
You fake on all of your backs

You are filthy
You are filthy

Tune in, find out
Die in doubt
Today there are hearts
Tomorrow there'll be none
No determination
And no life goals
A whole generation
Dead by its own cause

Is it symptomatic
That I don't trust anyone
Is it symptomatic
What, what
Is it symptomatic
That I don't trust anyone
Is it symptomatic
What, what
Fuck

You are filthy
You are filthy
