You're in every reflection
It had me drown a thousand times before
Now I'm guided by phantoms
I die everyday just to keep you alive

Tell me if it's wrong or right
To move on and let things go
All I see is just black and white
Where is my heart, where is my soul

I never knew that you're alone
But I can't turn back time
I never wanted you to go
But you never wanted me to stay

You're in every reflection
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Now I'm guided by phantoms
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Tell me if it's wrong or right
To move on and let things go
All I see is just black and white
Where is my heart, where is my soul

I never knew it all for sure
But I can't turn back time
And now I want you to know
That all that glitters is not always gold

You're in every reflection
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Now I'm guided by phantoms
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

You're in every reflection
It had me drown a thousand times before
Now I'm guided by phantoms
I die everyday just to keep you alive

You're in every reflection
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Now I'm guided by phantoms
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
