You speak in tongues
I can't hear you
Can you curse a little louder
No matter what you do
I won't listen to you

Try me, slit me, rape me
Sew my eyes and you will see
Fight until you break me
Sew my mouth then ask me again
Make me confess

Beat me down
'Til I can see it all
'Til I will bleed it out
Leave me here
And beat me black and blue
I'll tell you what you wanna know

Try me, slit me, rape me
Sew my eyes and you will see
Fight until you break me
Sew my mouth then ask me again
Make me confess

I won't break
I won't break
I won't break
I won't break
Fuck

Beat me down
'Til I can see it all
'Til I will bleed it out
Beat me down
'Til I can see it all
'Til I will bleed it out

Beat me down
'Til I can see it all
'Til I will bleed it out
Leave me here
And beat me black and blue
I'll tell you what you wanna know
