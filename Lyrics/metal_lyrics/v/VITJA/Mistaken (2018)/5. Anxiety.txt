I can hear them call my name

This is not a riot
This is not a war
This is anxiety
And it's knocking on your door
Bow to your knees
And start to pray
Eyes to the floor
Ignore the pain

Every single tear
Is pulling you deeper
Full of hell
You're feeding the reaper

'Cause in the back of your head
Is where it grows a seed
Deep down in the depths
Is where it breeds

I can hear them call my name
Anxiety, my good old friend
I can hear them call my name
Anxiety, please lead me to death

My mind is going in circles
Why is there no life without you
I hate to say I still got this death wish
It's the only way out of here
Fuck

I can hear them call my name

This is not a riot
This is not a war
This is anxiety
And it's knocking on your door
Bow to your knees
And start to pray
Eyes to the floor
Ignore the pain
