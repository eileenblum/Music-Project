The world is mistaken
There is no doubt
The goal is to be the worst
So you can be proud
And if you don't fit in
The you are dead
But it's not the end
Don't give up

Can you here the vultures
They crouch behind your back
It's all like I have told you
Don't give up, don't give up my friend

All these lies in disguise
What is happening to me
What have I done wrong
Why am I still here
I count my blessings
Until my time has come
Death has a knife
And it's six foot long

Nothing is sacred, nothing is true
God is a lie and religion is too
Why should it help me
For God's fucking sake
I'm already dead
I won't make it out alive

The walls are closing in
Don't give up, don't give up my friend
They have chosen me
Don't give up, don't give up

Don't ask about the future
'Cause there is nothing left
It's all like I have told you
Don't give up, don't give up my friend

It's not fine, it's not right
And I'm not OK
What have I done wrong
Why am I still here
I count my blessings
Until my time has come
I'm already dead
But it's not the end

Nothing is sacred, nothing is true
God is a lie and religion is too
Why should it help me
For God's fucking sake
I'm already dead
I don't want your help

The walls are closing in
Don't give up, don't give up my friend
They have chosen me
Don't give up, don't give up

I don't want your help
I don't want your help

I won't make it out alive

The walls are closing in
Don't give up, don't give up my friend
They have chosen me
Don't give up, don't give up

The world is mistaken
There is no doubt
The goal is to be the worst
So you can be proud
And if you don't fit in
The you are dead
But it's not the end
Don't give up
