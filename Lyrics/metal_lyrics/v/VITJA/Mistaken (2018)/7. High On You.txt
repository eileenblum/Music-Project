High on you
High on you
On you

I don't really know what it is
But I can see the darkness
I don't really know what it is
But I can't read your thoughts

I can't feel my faith
When I'm with you
I don't know if this just means
That I'm in love with you

Lead me, to the edge of what we know
Make me, make me believe in you

High on you
High on you
High on you
High on you
On you, you

I don't really know what it is
But it kills the cancer
I don't really know what it is
But I know that you feel it too

I can't feel my face
When I'm with you
I don't know if this just means
That I'm in love with you

Trade me, trade me for a soul
Make me, make me believe in you

Let's die high
I will follow blind
Let's die high
I will follow blind

High on you
High on you
High on you
High on you
On you, you

High on you
High on you
On you
