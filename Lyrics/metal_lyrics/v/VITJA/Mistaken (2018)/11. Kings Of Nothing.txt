It's hard to believe in anything
The more we get to know
We all shook hands with the devil
A long time ago
I can't see any truth in our eyes
Neither in our souls
Is this what we've become
Is this our impending doom

Our kingdom is rotten

This is the end of all we know
This is the end, we've been dethroned

There is no will, there never was
Any strength to move on
It's hard to believe in ourselves
When we know what we have done
I can't see any truth in our eyes
Neither in our souls
Is this what we've become
Is this our impending doom

Where we've been forgotten

This is the end of all we know
This is the end, we've been dethroned

Existence is pain and we are kings of nothing

This is the end of all we know
This is the end, we've been dethroned

Nothing
