Sedamine
Move in and stay
Inside my veins
Sedamine
It's all I want
It's all that I need

I don't know what's on your mind
I don't really know about the ache

So I've been there
Where they trade hearts
And I'll decide
To trade mine as well
'Cause you're the cure
And I can never say
How much you really mean to me

Sedamine
Move in and stay
Inside my veins
(Sedamine)
Sedamine
It's all I want
It's all that I need
(Sedamine)

I don't know what's on your mind
I will never really know for sure

So I've been there
Where they trade hearts
And I'll decide
To trade mine for you
'Cause you're like heaven
And I can never say
How much you really mean to me

Sedamine
Move in and stay
Inside my veins
(Sedamine)
Sedamine
It's all I want
It's all that I need
(Sedamine)

December let me sleep
Put me in a coma
Lay my head to rest
December let me sleep
Until this mess is over
It has never felt like

Sedamine
Move in and stay
Inside my veins
(Sedamine)
Sedamine
It's all I want
It's all that I need
(Sedamine)

Sedamine
Move in and stay
Inside my veins
Sedamine
It's all I want
It's all that I need
