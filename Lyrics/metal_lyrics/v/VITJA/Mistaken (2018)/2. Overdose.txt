[feat. Andy DÃ¶rner]I, I had enough
I had enough
I had enough
I had enough

Enough is enough, is enough
This is an overdose
For too long you fed my demons
Enough is enough, is enough
And I can't take it anymore
I don't need no reason

Nothing is as it used to be
Nothing is the same
I think that there is nothing left
I feel the noose around my neck

I'm not feeling well
No I'm not OK
I feel the devil inside me
This time there is no escape
I've had enough and I don't want this anymore

Enough is enough, is enough
This is an overdose
For too long you fed my demons
Enough is enough, is enough
And I can't take it anymore
I don't need no reason

Nothing feels like it used to feel
Nothing is the same
I'm in love with the shadows
I feel the noose around my neck

Take me off, give me an overdose
I feel the devil inside me
This time there is no escape
You fucked it up
This is the way it ends

Goodbye my dearest friend
I know you tried your best
But this is where I draw the line
Where I draw the line
Goodbye my dearest friend
The rain is pouring down on us
Enough is enough

I, I had enough
I had enough
I had enough
I had enough

Enough is enough, is enough
This is an overdose
For too long you fed my demons
Enough is enough, is enough
And I can't take it anymore
I don't need no reason
