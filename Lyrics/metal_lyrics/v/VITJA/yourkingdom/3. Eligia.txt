We are the ones
We are chosen ones
We come from heaven
We belong to mother sun

As a pride we come
To set this earth on fire
We are the lions
Bestriding your dead soil

As a pride we come
To set this earth on fire
You're not forsaken
We are the ones
To bring your lights back
You are not alone

As a pride we come
To set this earth on fire
We are the lions
We are the ones

You shall not see
Rotten minds
Blind victims
You shall not see

You're running in circles
Lost in yourself
Walls crumble to bricks
You're losing yourself

You're so lost inside of this
You become unknown
This was your decision
Deaf words don't moan
Running in circles
You'll become unknown
You are so lost inside of this
You lost your grip
No this time
I won't sacrifice my merits
We are the ones
We are the chosen ones

We are the ones
We are chosen ones
We come from heaven
We belong to mother sun

As a pride we come
To set this earth on fire
We are the lions
Bestriding your dead soil

We are the lions
Containing your tigers
