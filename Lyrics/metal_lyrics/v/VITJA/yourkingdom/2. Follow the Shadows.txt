We lost the keys for far too long
All I see in me is a dying sun
Oh dear I joined them so long ago
It's the darkest place
The place I call home

Run, seek and try
(Follow the shadows)
There's no place to hide
(Follow the shadows)

I'm lost within the lights
I begin to fade
As I walk into the night
The devil came my soul to take

There was so much that I wanted to see
But it died within my memories

Every night, I wake up
To push my heart
Back into my chest
To escape the devil's hands around my neck

I'm so sorry for what I've become

Run, seek and try
(Follow the shadows)
There's no place to hide
(Follow the shadows)

I'm lost within the lights
I begin to fade
As I walk into the night
The devil came my soul to take
