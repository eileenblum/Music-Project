Ladies and gentlemen this is the start of the end of it all
With my heart in my hand
Covered in blood
Soaked with thoughts
I did it on my own I swear to god

My chest starts to ache
My lips are dry
My knees start to shake
Days turned into nights
Fun is now silence the darkness is bright
I hope the poison will help me to survive

Rest in peace my friend
Welcome to your kingdom
The demons I will call
Will find me
I am ready to fall

Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing this anthem

My chest starts to ache
My lips are dry, my knees start to shake
Days turned into nights
the wind will lead me back to you

Your thoughts are hurricanes
Your lungs will stop to ache
Your words will be flames
The wind will lead you back to me

I will never forget the day everything changed
I will never forget what I know now
I should have been with you instead
If you just could send me a note
A whisper in my ear, a touch through my soul
I'd give it all to see you again
Rest in peace
Sleep well my friend
It all falls apart (there's a hole in my soul)
Back from the start

Rest in peace my friend
Welcome to your kingdom
The demons I will call
Will find me
I am ready to fall

This is my farewell poem but I just want to paint the town in red
I hate this fucking poem cause you are gone and my heart is

Dead!

Your thoughts are hurricanes
Your lungs will stop to ache
Your words will be flames
The wind will lead you back to me
As one of the mighty gods
You protect the world from above
And I sing your symphony

Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing this anthem
