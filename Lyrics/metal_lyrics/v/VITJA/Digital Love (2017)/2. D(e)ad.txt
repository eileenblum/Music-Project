You swear you love
You lose you cry
We care we hope
You leave we'll die

You swear you love
You lose you cry
We care we hope
You leave we'll die

All my life I tried to fill in your footsteps
It took me 42 scars to
See there's nothing left
I won't give you one more night
I'd rather kiss my life goodbye

Father I'm your only child
Father what made you cry
Father I'm your only child
Father what made you die on the inside

You swear you love
You lose you cry
We care we hope
You leave we'll die

You swear you love
You lose you cry
We care we hope
You leave we'll die

If I say I don't mind
It's a fucking bullshit lie
They say that the blood will dry
But not if you bleed a little everyday

Father I'm your only child
Father what made you cry
Father I'm your only child
Father what made you die on the inside

I could never be
Who you've become
I don't give a fuck where
I'm coming from

I could never be
Who you've become
If you feel my heart
Then sing along

This is the father's song
Every bottom of a bottle
Counts a fallen son
Do you remember me
Do you remember me

You swear you love
You lose you cry
We care we hope
You leave we'll die

You swear you love
You lose you cry
We care we hope
You leave we'll die

I could never be
Who you've become
I don't give a fuck where
I'm coming from

I could never be
Who you've become
If you feel my heart
Then sing along

I could never be
Who you've become
I don't give a fuck where
I'm coming from

I could never be
Who you've become
If you feel my heart
Then sing along

You swear you love
You lose you cry
We care we hope
You leave we'll die

You swear you love
You lose you cry
We care we hope
You leave we'll die
