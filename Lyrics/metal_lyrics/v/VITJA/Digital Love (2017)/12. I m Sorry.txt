You put so much faith in me
In a world you never meant to see
I just want to save you from myself

I'm so sorry that I let you down

Now there is nothing that I can do or say
I just want you to know
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I hope that you know
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry
I am sorry

Come show me your weapons
And I'll show you mine
I can feel your body shaking
As you start to lie

Is it always on me to fix the broken
What is wrong with this generation
Is it always on me to fix the broken
What the fuck is wrong with you

Now there is nothing that I can do or say
I just want you to know
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I hope that you know

That life is bittersweet
What you saw isn't what you reap
I know you're in love with me
But this is not who I want to be

I'm so sorry for the pain you had to take
There is just one thing
One thing that I can say

What you saw isn't what you reap
And what you wish is not what you get

Now there is nothing that I can do or say
Now there is nothing that I can do or say

Now there is nothing that I can do or say
I just want you to know
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I hope that you know
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry
I am sorry
