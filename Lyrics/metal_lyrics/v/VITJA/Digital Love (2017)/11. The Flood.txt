Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Erase it all
Every moment, every thought

It's this place between heaven and hell
It's not the last time that I will write you from here
It's OK for me, it's OK my dear
I know why you did this, oh I know you well

How long will it take this time
Until you replace and forget about me
When will I realise
That it just takes four letters
To create what we called love

Here comes the flood
With the echoes of my heart
There is nothing left for me
Except of bitter memories

Here comes the flood
Let me drown in your blood
Feed me to the father's snakes
With all my smiles and memories

Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Erase it all
Every moment, every thought

I know you can see me
Dying inside this shell
Come on, look me in the eyes
Eat my soul and turn me into stone
I lay down all my defense
What did you do? You ripped off my skin
Just because you needed to
You got what you wanted
And threw me to the wolves

Here comes the flood
With the echoes of my heart
There is nothing left for me
Except of bitter memories

Here comes the flood
Let me drown in your blood
Feed me to the father's snakes
With all my smiles and memories

Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood

Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Here comes the flood
Erase it all
Every moment, every thought
