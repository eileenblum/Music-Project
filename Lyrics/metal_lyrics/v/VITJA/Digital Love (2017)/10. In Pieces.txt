(I'm blinded by the lights)

I've seen all the seasons
I've been left behind
I can see no reason
To live this life

I've explored every orbit
Travelled through space and time
I tried to save the best of you
When I left you behind

Here I lay in pieces
Part my body from my mind
Dancing with the serpents
I'm blinded by the lights

Valkyries cry for vengeance
For a god that only hides
There is no hope for us
We will make it out
We will make it out alive

Nothing's as it was before
I'll drown here in these walls
Ashes turn to gold
I'm not afraid to die alone

I've been every master chief
In every place in every tribe
I've seen the evil win
When the good gave up the fight

I've seen how the world
Fell apart
I drowned the angels
In my blood

Here I lay in pieces
Part my body from my mind
Dancing with the serpents
I'm blinded by the lights

Valkyries cry for vengeance
For a god that only hides
There is no hope for us
We will make it out
We will make it out alive

Nothing's as it was before
I'll drown here in these walls
Ashes turn to gold
I'm not afraid to die alone

Nothing's as it was before
Nothing's as it was before
I'll drown here in these walls

Here I lay in pieces
Part my body from my mind
Dancing with the serpents
I'm blinded by the lights

Valkyries cry for vengeance
For a god that only hides
There is no hope for us
We will make it out
We will make it out alive

Nothing's as it was before
I'll drown here in these walls
Ashes turn to gold
