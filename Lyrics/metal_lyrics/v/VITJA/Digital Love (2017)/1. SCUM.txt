Same shit called "life"
Same problems - different city
I know you're rid of life
Different story but same old pity

What have I done?
I never justified all these fucking lies
I wanna get out
No remorse til' the day I die

This is our night
This is our time
Scream it out
From the bottom of your lungs
Scream it out
It's on the tip of your tongue
I will make it out alive

So stop to pretend
That you're all alone
Take a ride with me and my friends
We got a pocket full of dreams

Everything that I left behind
Doesn't matter anymore
So fuck this life

What have I done?
I never justified all these fucking lies

If you don't care
Put your hands in the air
If your life is fucked
Then get the fuck up
If you sick and tired
And you can't take it no more
Then get all your friends
And take them to the dance floor

Fuck!

This is our night
This is our time
Scream it out
From the bottom of your lungs
Scream it out
It's on the tip of your tongue
I will make it out alive

This is our night
This is our time
Scream it out
From the bottom of your lungs
Scream it out
It's on the tip of your tongue
I will make it out alive
