The roses start to wither
Where the devil lays to sleep
And sorrow seems to be like joy
Where dying lights dance on last time

You had me at hello
But I couldn't see right through your twisted soul
This was the downfall of us all

(Roses start to wither
Where the devil lays to sleep)

Too close to hell
I can't see
What ate me up from the inside
Too close to hell
I will never see
What ate me up from the inside out
(From the inside out)

I'm caught in a nightmare
No chance to make it out alive
Why have we left the place
Where we found love

You had me at hello
But I couldn't see right through your twisted soul
This was the downfall of us all

(Roses start to wither
Where the devil lays to sleep)

Too close to hell
I can't see
What ate me up from the inside
Too close to hell
I will never see
What ate me up from the inside out

So sing along
We are a battle
So sing along
Why have you forsaken me?

Why have you forsaken me?
Why have you forsaken me?
Why have you forsaken me?
Why have you forsaken me?

(Roses start to wither
Where the devil lays to sleep)

Too close to hell
I can't see
What ate me up from the inside
Too close to hell
I will never see
What ate me up from the inside out
(From the inside out)
