Why is this pressure on my chest
Where the fuck did I loose myself
What is this sickness in my heart
We've been forsaken from the start

Why am I bound to nothing
While my stomach is filled with stones
It's not that I don't want to feel happy
Even with you I feel so...

Will there be release when you find me
Is there someone to see who believes in me
I don't wanna be like this
Heavy rain on my parade

Will there be release when you find me
Is there someone to see who believes in me
I don't wanna be like this
Heavy rain on my parade

And every time I dare to go out
It eats me up inside
It's not the path that I have chosen
And I need to know

What is this sickness in my heart
Where the fuck did I loose myself
Why am I bound to nothing
While my stomach is filled with stones

Will there be release when you find me
Is there someone to see who believes in me
I don't wanna be like this
Heavy rain on my parade

Will there be release when you find me
Is there someone to see who believes in me
I don't wanna be like this
Heavy rain on my parade

This is the moment of silence
Cause I am still part of your disgusting show
Why should there be a masterpiece
When there is no fucking god
So whom the fuck you sold your soul

You live your life by the same old lies
Day in day out you crucify
You sleep with the wolves and eat with the rats
You will take it all until there's nothing left

When you open your mouth then it's like a disease
I love that you hate the things you see in me
I guess I never really gave a fuck about it all
I'd cut off my ears not to listen anymore

(And I can hear them scream)
Traitors to the cross
Let them find their gods
Traitors to the cross
Let them find their gods
Traitors to the cross
Let them find their gods
Traitors to the cross
Let them find their gods
