I wanna forget but I'm just so sad
That you're not there when I lay to bed
I have to confess
That I'm better of dead
I know that it's over and it's too late

I'm a misfit with a bastard soul
Hunted by the wolves and the darkness is my home
I am the demon that I have to fight
And I lost the battle

But you still can't see
It's not just my fault
There's always two
You burned our bridges and I left our home
This isn't war this is suicide
Slowly dying on the inside

We gave it all
All that we got
We had it all
And I messed it up

Give me your hand
And I'll give you my heart
Rip it out
Read your name in scars

We gave it all
All that we got
We had it all
And I messed it up

Give me your hand
And I'll give you my heart
Rip it out
Read your name in scars

I wanna regret but I have to forget
All the whispers and the tears
Inside I'm a mess and I have to confess
That I made a big mistake

Yeah I'm a misfit with a bastard soul
Haunted by the wolves and the darkness is my home
I am the demon that I have to fight
And I lost the battle

But you still can't see
It's not just my fault
What about you?
We both changed beds when we shared a home
This wasn't love, this was suicide
Slowly dying on the inside

We gave it all
All that we got
We had it all
And I messed it up

Give me your hand
And I'll give you my heart
Rip it out
Read your name in scars

We gave it all
All that we got
We had it all
And I messed it up

Give me your hand
And I'll give you my heart
Rip it out
Read your name in scars

This the story where the ocean loved the moon too much
Take all its bitterness and bond it to a fucking rope
Now go set sail, let the river be your help 
I hope so much you will find what you love

So young and addicted
Full of affliction
We drown, we drown

So young and addicted
Full of affliction
We drown, we drown

Find what you love and kill it
