I've been to hell
And I'll go there twice
On my way to heaven
Light burnt out my eyes

It's too much shit that I had to take
Too much pain
I wish I made it better

666 is the number of doom
Sick sick sick that I love you

So tell me would you pay for my soul
If I can't go to hell
I can't go back home

Trade my life
With faith and gold
Is it enough to sell my soul?
Is it enough?
Is it enough?
Trade my life
With faith and gold
Is it enough to sell my soul?
Is it enough?
Is it enough?
To sell my soul

666 is the number of doom
Sick sick sick that I love you

So tell me would you pay for my soul
If I can't go to hell
I can't go back home

Tell me would you pay for my soul
If I can't go to hell
I can't go back home
Tell me would you pay for my soul
If I can't go to hell
I can't go back home

I don't want your heaven
I want back home

[Matthias:]
666 - number of doom
Sick sick sick - I do love you
666 - who the fuck
Sick sick sick - I love you

So tell me would you pay for my soul
If I can't go to hell
I can't go back home

I don't want your heaven
Don't you know, don't you know?
I just want back home

Trade my life
With faith and gold
Is it enough to sell my soul?
Is it enough?
Is it enough?
Trade my life
With faith and gold
Is it enough to sell my soul?
Is it enough?
Is it enough?
To sell my soul
