We're all just entertainers

One foot in life
One foot in the grave
You change your mind
From day to day
Selling our bodies
We don't even get paid
Only for a bit of attention
And a story to create

Suck and swallow
Take it deep inside
Suck and swallow
I know it's what you like
Suck and swallow
Don't dare to spit it out
Suck and swallow
We're so special
You and I

How long will it take
Until we find ourselves again
If you give up on me
I won't give up on you
You're my digital love
You're my digital love

0101
I hope that they will find someone
Someone perfect like you

Suck and swallow
Take it deep inside
Suck and swallow
I know it's what you like

We're all just entertainers
Fuck

You are so damn fucked up
That you don't even see
Life is what you make it
And it's just what it is

How long will it take
Until we find ourselves again
If you give up on me
I won't give up on you

How long will it take
Until we find ourselves again
If you give up on me
I won't give up on you
You're my digital love
You're my digital love
You're my digital love
