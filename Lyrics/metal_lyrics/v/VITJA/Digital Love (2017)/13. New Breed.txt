We are the new breed
We're bastardized from heart to feet
Our faith is disbelief
We won't rest, we won't sleep

We are the new breed
We're bastardized from heart to feet
Our faith is disbelief
We won't rest and we won't sleep

All these lies blackened by our mind
Like leeches we crawl
Don't trust a single thing you see
We're not alive just because we breath

Did you really thing that you could make it out alive?
You can run but you cannot hide
Fuck everything you stand for
And keep your goddamn pride
Take it back, cause we deny

We are the new breed
We're bastardized from heart to feet
Our faith is disbelief
We won't rest and we won't sleep

We are the new breed
We're bastardized from heart to feet
Our faith is disbelief
We won't rest and we won't sleep

In your eyes I can see the demise
The leaders will fall
Don't believe a word they preach
Ignorance is bliss
They do it for the greed

Did you really thing that you could make it out alive?
You can run but you cannot hide
Fuck everything you stand for
And keep your goddamn pride
Take it back, cause we deny

We are the new breed
We're bastardized from heart to feet
Our faith is disbelief
We won't rest and we won't sleep

We are the new breed
We're bastardized from heart to feet
Our faith is disbelief
We won't rest and we won't sleep

We are the new breed
We're bastardized from heart to feet
Our faith is disbelief
We won't rest and we won't sleep

We are the new breed
We're bastardized from heart to feet
Our faith is disbelief
We won't rest and we won't sleep
