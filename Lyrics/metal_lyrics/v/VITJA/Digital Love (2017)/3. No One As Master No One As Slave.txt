(No one as master
No one as slave)

And I'll sing for the broken and the dead
I'll forgive but I won't forget
No one as master
No one as slave

Here I'm on my knees again
You had it all, you had my everything
This is really all I get
After all I tried so hard

It was a knife in my chest
It broke my spine
What you call yours was also mine
You took my home
You took my only friend

Can you hear the shadows whisper?
That wish of faith
Can you see the pieces fit?
It was all just you and me

To the sharks with your shame
To the wolves, repent
Take this time and me for what it is
Our legacy won't fade
To the shadows with my name
To the grave, again!
Take this time and me for what it is
Our legacy won't fade

What's worth a promise
In the end
If you forget about what we said
It's true hearts, one fate
Or two lives, two ways

You can call me hopeless
But I could find a million ways
A million ways to break free
But I choose to stay
I choose to stay a while

It was a knife in my chest
You took my life
What you call yours was never mine
I never had a home
We never had been friends

Can you hear the shadows whisper?
That we should fade
Can you see the pieces fit?
It was not just you and me

To the sharks with your shame
To the wolves, repent
Take this time and me for what it is
Our legacy won't fade
To the shadows with my name
To the grave, again!
Take this time and me for what it is
Our legacy won't fade

I wish I died before we met!
I wish I died before we met!

(No one as master, no one as slave)

And here I stand alone now at the edge
I wish I died before we met
(This time I will, I will dive right in)

And I'll sing for the broken and the dead
I'll forgive but I won't forget
No one as master
No one as slave

To the sharks with your shame
To the wolves, repent
Take this time and me for what it is
All I could see were the shadows
With my name to the grave, again!
Take this time and me for what it is
Our legacy won't fade

I wish I died before we met!
I wish I died before we met!
