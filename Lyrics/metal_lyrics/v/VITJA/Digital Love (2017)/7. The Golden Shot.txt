Push push

Hello it's me
It's been a while we didn't meet
Come on lay next to me
There is more than this world to see

Your eyes for the passion
Mine stand for loyalty
Let me be your hero
Cause you're my heroine

And now we're drifting far
So far away
We are infinity
Come push your poison
Into my veins
You know, you know
What you mean to me

What would you give
To get it all
I found love in you
Right back from the start
And I'd give it all
To hold your hand again
I can't be a king
Without a queen

I can't be king
Without a queen
I can't be king
Without a queen

You are the wolves
I am a sheep
You know exactly
What you mean to me

You promised light
But sold me darkness
You are my addiction
I still love you after all of this

And now we're drifting far
So far away
We are infinity
Come push your poison
Into my veins
You know, you know
What you mean to me

What would you give
To get it all
I found love in you
Right back from the start
And I'd give it all
To hold your hand again
I can't be a king
Without a queen

And now we're drifting far
So far away
We are infinity
Come push your poison
Into my veins
You know, you know
What you mean to me

What would you give
To get it all
I found love in you
Right back from the start
And I'd give it all
To hold your hand again
I can't be a king
Without a queen

What would you give
To get it all
I found love in you
Right back from the start
And I'd give it all
To hold your hand again
I can't be a king
Without a queen

I can't be king
Without a queen
I can't be king
Without a queen
I can't be king
Without a queen
I can't be king
Without a queen
