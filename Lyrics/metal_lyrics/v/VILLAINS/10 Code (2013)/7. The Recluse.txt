I am the bitter son of a world that never wanted me,
And now it's clear to see,
I am spit out and useless, beaten too many times, now I speak to you toothless,
Life's a poison vile that's filled to the brim, so I'll do like they say and take it all in,
Every new face tells a worn out story,
Every new place gets my stomach churning,
Every day the weight on my spine gets bigger,
Every time I tell myself it's okay it withers,
I came from dirt, I'll fucking end in dirt, cause there's nothing more to life than being hurt.
I came from dirt, I'll fucking end in dirt, cause there's nothing more to life than being hurt.
I don't know how to live as a man who's lost it all,
Or how to pick up these pieces when every time I fall,
So I'll gather these chains, and tie them to my feet, and step into the ocean and forget to breathe
I'm lost, defeated, and senseless (senseless), drove away everyone I've loved so I could end this,
I've sent out my flares, they've all gone unnoticed, every cry for help was a goddamn death wish
For too long I've pushed death aside, and it's never even crossed my mind, but maybe it's time I give suicide a try.
