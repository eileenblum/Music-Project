We're just connecting dots of past encounters,
Hanging on to what you know, and what's become far to familiar over time
We include one another, in our stagnance, and time may as well stand still
We're all servants, to a master bent on our destruction
We bow our heads and say jump how high?
This isn't a right, it's a responsibility
I'm just a sheep but I've got a little fight in me (fight in me),
A tired dog but I've still got some bite in me
So here's to the degradation of the pride we built, do they only stand by ignorance, is that their happy state?
Proof of their obedience, and their faith
I swear to god this is a comedy
The cruelest joke I've never told
But in my head, it never gets old
We've allowed the crimes against ourselves, so how can we complain?
We're the source of our own pain, so even though I've found a place to rest my head
I still can't sleep, I still can't sleep at night.
