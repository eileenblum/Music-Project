[feat. Tyler Dennen Of Sworn In]Dear friends, I've been living on my knees (on my knees),
with everyone but myself and a world to please,
frustrations got the better half of me,
I am only a shell of a man I used to be
Not even a cent to show for a life left unspent
Just lessons better left unlearned,
now here I am fucking filled with resentment

What's the point of growing up,
when the older I get the more everything gets fucked?
I live a life that yearns to implode,
go!

No tongue and no eyes to see
As I lay in my bed,
I still can't fucking sleep,
Everyday I try and reach to the sky,
but only fall back on myself (on myself),

All I needed was somebody else,
So I place these problems on the shelf,
Waiting to be toppled from the force of the world slamming the door in my face.

[2x]
We're all shadows of who we used to be,
and everyone's a stranger with crooked teeth.

So break these bones,
Because this mind has no body or soul as a home.
Incompetence is an all too familiar feeling.

So everyone raise your glasses to the man of the evening,
Yours truly.
