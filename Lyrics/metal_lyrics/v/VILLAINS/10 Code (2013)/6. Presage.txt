[feat. Colin Sharkey Of Barrier]Eyes closed as I try to sleep,
I always beckon these omens deep inside of me,
I've shown the world my darkest half,
The air inside me purges,
I watch it burn and laugh,
How I love this pain, numbing pain,
I can't feel nerves and endings,
I do deserve to die,
She never leaves my side,
Always just steps behind,
Breathing down my neck I can feel the chills run down my spine,
Fuck.
(I've shown), I am the product of hate, I am the fucking slime,
This feelings bitter sweet,
That oh familiar street,
I am resistance and I am the reason why
Pounding head, blurry vision, I cannot make decisions, all of this disorientation is killing me
Scratch this, I'm finished,
My life is filled with sin it's a fucking disaster I disregard and pass her,
It's useless, I'm too deep,
I'm following to closely,
This black sheep will conquer, will conquer, will conquer
I try to run and hide, it's always steps behind,
The urge to finish this profitless life of mine,
It's breathing down my neck, this reminiscent dialect, influential tendencies to put my own life in check,

I just don't give a shit anymore
Giving up has been the best decision of my life
Enduring endless pain, never ending pain,
These pins and needles keep pushing in one by one
Oh I just don't give a shit anymore
Giving up has been the best decision of my life
Enduring endless pain, never ending pain,
These pins and needles keep pushing in one by one
One by one.
