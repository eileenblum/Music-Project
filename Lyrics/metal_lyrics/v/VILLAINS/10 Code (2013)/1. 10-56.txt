[2x]
I have this fear this fear in my heart
No one will miss me when my funeral starts

I need help (I need help)
I'm in fucking hell
Not a single person on this earth can fall the way I fell
To have your whole entire world torn apart,
To have your whole life shit on
I'm calling you as a last resort maybe you'll miss me when I'm gone
Bring a body bag
Come tuck me in
No use for a name
Just 10-56
