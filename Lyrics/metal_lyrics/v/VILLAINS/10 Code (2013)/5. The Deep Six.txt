Always been second best, a step below, nothing special, I'm chronically obsessed with fucking up,
And blowing my chances,
So when I close my eyes it's death that I dance with,
I walk around with a chip on my shoulder,
It's weighed me down as I've gotten older cause I'm weak

I've faced facts, I see them smile, with their fingers crossed behind their backs,
Nice guys are doomed from the start

Fuck!

I've learned to kill of my conscious, clean slate, no more fucking kindness,
Life's been a bitch, a thorn in my side, instead of looking ahead, I'll just close my eyes.
I've become a better person, one who's not concerned with the cold world that I once knew,
I've learned to live in this cage on my own, your jester, your fucking fool,

I am the victim, the butt of the joke, misery's company,
I've been thinking vicious thoughts, now lets make them a reality

I dwell in the gallows, consumed by doubt (get me out),
A breathing cadaver, my mind is going south,

The hearse screams, they swear that I really am a madman,
A fucking madman, they scream, they scream
I miss who I used to be, so let the reaper come get me.
I miss who I used to be, so let the reaper come and get me.
I miss who I used to be and everything is fine.
