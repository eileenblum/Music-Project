So sing this lullaby I've been waiting, still waiting, for the day I die
Each day when I open my eyes I lye waiting, still waiting, for the day I die
So sing this lullaby I've been waiting, still waiting, for the day I die
And I know there's no turning back, but in the end, in the end all I want to see is black, just fucking black.
