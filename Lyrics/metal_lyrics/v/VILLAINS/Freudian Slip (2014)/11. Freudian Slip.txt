I'm sorry for everything I never did
I'm sorry about all the things I've never said
I'm sorry I've been such a hassle for you all to string along
I'm sorry that I'm not proud
I'm sorry that I feel like I belong in the ground
I'm sorry the concrete feels more like home
I'm sorry that everyday I feel more alone

Just one of those days

Iâm sorry that every second I feel more weak
I'm sorry I'm caught up in all that I'll never be
Iâm sorry that I always talk too much
Iâm sorry that nothing was good enough
I'm sorry that Iâm a has-been, with his smile dimmed
Just a nuisance who can't take a hint
I'm sorry that I could never help
I'm sorry for feeling sorry for myself

Just one of those days where I just want you to stay

I swear to god I tried my best
But the world wonât stop beating on my chest
I swear that itâs cracked my skull
And made everything I feel so dull
I swear to god itâs not your fault
I just never learned how to fall
But I promise that I gave it my all
I swear itâs not your fault

I'm sorry Iâm not always okay
Iâm sorry that Iâm always the one to blame
Iâm sorry that I always make you upset
Iâm sorry, I hope you can forgive and forget me
