Iâm the poster child for death
Your number one for a bad time
You really didnât think that the slit wrists were a bad sign?
Iâm sure Iâm a nuisance
A recluse with a noose
Youâd think by the 3rd song the rope wouldnât be so loose

Till death do us part

So what?
Now Iâm just a waste of an investment?
Incessantly oppressed and always obsessed with doing the wrong thing?
Just me, myself, and I
A head full of broken pistons
So it makes sense why
All my friends have gone missing

Well okay, forget about me
Been living, barely living
Far from what I need

I guess Iâm a misfit
I guess I donât get it
So Iâll take a bath in blood and sickly depression
Well okay, forget about me
Been living, barely living
I can hardly breathe

So carve your name into my bones
Because I donât want to be alone
Bludgeon me with sticks and stones
As long as I wont be alone

Constantly thinking about death is killing me
My friend, my dearest friend
So till death do us part
Till death do us part
