Call the doctor
Iâve got all these problems
I donât know how to solve them
My conscience dead rotten, alone and forgotten

Call the doctor
Send me to the hospice for people whoâve lost it
Iâm stuck in my coffin and I think someone locked it

Whatâs my fucking purpose?
I was born with words that curse every single loving person
Iâm sorry Iâm a burden
Iâm useless, fucking worthless
Think itâs time the close the curtain
All I think aboutâs my service
I mean it couldnât get much worse

I donât want to be alone anymore

This is life through the eyes of a broken man
Whoâs let everything he had fall through his fucking hands

Doctor, I am deranged
My brain needs to be tamed
I donât think I need change
Just a rope for me to hang

I donât want to be alone anymore

This little light of mine, Iâm gonna let it die

Anxiety still swallows my chest and lead consumes my lungs
Everyday the gun meets my mouth
But Iâve never been one to get the job done
