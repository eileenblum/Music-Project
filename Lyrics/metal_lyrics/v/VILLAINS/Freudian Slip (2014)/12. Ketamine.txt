So sedate me, sedate me
So I can die happy

Iâm not okay, Iâm not alright
Iâm sorry these tongue-tied words donât come out just right
But it was nice to know you
It really was

Iâve watched everything Iâve tried to reach for
Just slip through the cracks
Thatâs why I overreact
Maybe youâd understand
Could understand why Iâm desperate
Why I beg for attention

So sedate me, sedate me, so I could die happy
(So sedate me) but it was nice to know you
It really was
A backwards life

Iâm a burden of a person
And I know that I do
Always feel out of place in a crowded room
Even my own fucking room
When its just one on one
Who I am and who Iâve been, coming undone

Just me here to pull the trigger
A Freudian slip
Arms dressed with the slits
My dirty little secret
A Freudian slip
Shoulder to wrist

Murderous and self-loathing
Eyes shut, veins coated
With cyanide Iâm hoping that it stops my heart real slowly
Maybe Iâll start a trend
Load up your guns for your friends
Help them put it to their heads
The End.
