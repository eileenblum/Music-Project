I donât want to be alone anymore. I donât believe in myself. I donât feel much anymore, the only thing I recognize is anxiety. Mind buckling, chest crushing anxiety that sucks the air right from your lungs and slowly and effectively kills
your will to live. Why should I be proud of that? Why should I be proud of myself? Every time I open my mouth to speak I embarrass those around me. I am an embarrassment, and I am alone. I donât want to be alone anymore. I donât want to be alone anymore.
