My antidepressant hides in a Smith &amp; Wesson
I donât know how to make anxiety lessen
Iâve learned my lesson
Donât ever love first
Or have your psyche messed with
Intimacy lives in a hearse

Love is dead
It only exists in your head
And hangs onto your neck until your face turns red
Until it rips your mind into shreds

Now Iâm just old news
A drunk and in love fool
Now Iâm old news, a fucking fool

But itâs not so bad
Youâre only the best I ever had

Drowning in static and feedback from the mic
Thatâs been stapled to my mouth my whole life
I need you; I love you, is this all in my head?
Microphone check
No one can hear me I guess
Check

I wrote these words in blood to make sure that they meant enough
Can you hear me?
Can anyone hear me?

So say goodbye to chivalry
And all that meant the world to me
Hang me high in this anxiety
And everything Iâll never be
Everything that Iâve been feeling
Left me dangling from the ceiling
Iâm only broken and misused
I donât see whatâs so unappealing
