They love me, they love me not
I live with a noose around my neck
And the devil on my shoulder pulling me towards death
Waiting for when I slip up next
To whisper faults in my ears hoping Iâll choose him instead

The whole worldâs a cutthroat
Fed all these insults
Right down my throat
Chokehold 'til I scream ânoâ

They love me, they love me not
It really all depends on what Iâve got

Why do I make time for people who could care less if Iâm alive?
Because if they donât love me then who else will

I was born a lonely bastard
A walking fucking disaster
With a passion for being the worst and constantly thinking I'm hurt

So long live depression, long live sin
May you never stop worshipping your demons within
May you always fight the battles that youâll never win
Again and again and again

They say that the grass is always greener on the other side
But everythingâs black and white when you feel left behind

Let me suffer, let me rot
Swallow me with everything I lost
My mind is caught inside a slipknot
Made out of anxiousness and everything Iâm not
Let me suffer, let me rot in my cell
They love me, they love me not
I canât tell

People like me werenât meant to be happy
Weâre meant to choke on our words with everyone laughing
People like me werenât meant to be happy
Iâm not happy, I donât know how to be happy
