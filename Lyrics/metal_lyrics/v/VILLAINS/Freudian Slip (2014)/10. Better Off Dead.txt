It lives in my home, it sleeps on my floor
Every night I hear itâs nails on my door
And kill every bit of hope before it leaves my pores
Stop coming to my house
Stop stealing words from my mouth

So I bite my tongue
To avoid confrontation or offending anyone
(Anxiety)
Iâll never win; I canât win
Just a hopeless villain

I don't know when my demons conquered
Or when my skeleton softened
Or when the rest broke free from the closet
But I know every damn thing put a nail in my coffin

Distant, slime, lost, scum
All of the above
An embarrassment to everyone I love
The reaper still hasnât come
Iâm so sick of myself
So sick of screaming for help

Iâm still in fucking hell
Iâm still in fucking hell

Rendered motionless by anxiety
A dead man to be
Trapped by this dead mans dreams
Cursed with the nervous luck of being me

Fuck the doctor; fuck his pills
Fuck the self-loathing that stems from the guilt
Fuck my arrogance; fuck my carelessness
Itâs irrelevant; fuck my therapist
Better off dead
Let the grievance commence
Iâm still second best
Iâm still second best
Fuck
