Before we go any further
Before we go any further
Friends; how many of us have them?
Friends; the ones we can depend on
Friends

Whoâs gonna love me when the world acts like its above me?
With its foot in my face
I never belonged in the first place

Maybe youâll see when I rest in peace
I gave my all for you when you could give two fucks about me
Maybe youâll see when I rest in peace
I gave my all for you, you left me lonely

Its so much clearer hanging from the rafters
Not everyone gets their happy ever after
Itâs so much clearer
Hang [4x]

A ticket, a tasket, Iâm just a fucking has-been
Iâm falling off course âcause I just wont fucking have it
Iâve had it

Donât want to be alone anymore,
Whens death knocking at my door?
Donât want to be alone
