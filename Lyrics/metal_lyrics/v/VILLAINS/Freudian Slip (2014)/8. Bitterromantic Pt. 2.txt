Do you remember the days where I was your everything?
What the world could bring?
Or how at night the world would sing?

I still remember the finest things
Those heartfelt talks about what you meant to me
Or how the nights alone were a deathly thing

Do you remember how you couldn't dream of anyone better and how perfect we were together?
How perfect was the weather before you weren't sure whether

I was what you wanted
My whole life I've been taunted
Iâve always been unwanted

And now I'm sure that your voice was poison
All the words you spoke just noises
While you chewed me up and broke me down like my memories of you before he came around

So I hope you two are happy
With your knife in my throat I'm laughing and thinking of you
Because my only happy thoughts are between us two

And when you break his heart
I hope he doesn't fall apart
Like this man who always talked too much
Like this man who was never good enough

Never really had much
But for you I had love
Every lie you spit built my crutch

Life is pointless without you around
This is me living in the background
So I hope youâre happy now

I hope youâre fucking happy now
I doubt youâll hear me screaming for help
Because these words drown in my goddamn mouth
