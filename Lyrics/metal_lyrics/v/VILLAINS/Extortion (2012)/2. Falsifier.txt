Now we've both got targets on our backs, but I refuse to share the power.
Kneel before me now, your crutch and your creator.
Fuck what you took for fact. You're bearing witness to the birth of what's next to come.
And as what was known begins to fall to pieces
we'll keep the I told you so's in our heads or at least under our breath.
But if promises mean so much, I can tell you one thing.
I can make damn sure that this becomes clear to you.
I'm so tired of this charade of yours, there's no mercy for the impure.
You won't take me down on this sinking ship, full of arrogance, lies, and all your fucking bullshit.
So just jog in place and keep up that facade, you fucking falsifier, without me to lean on.
