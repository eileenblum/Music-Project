Those with voice
are those without heart
they are the gluttonous
that will still rip the meat from your bones for sustenance
the rich that steal from those with nothing
the leeches, decked in gold feast upon common blood
Â 
Let my barbaric cry echo
through these mountains that surround me
let the very breath from my lungs be heard
and let it flow through you
Â 
This is all that I have
my voice of tribute to the broken
To those with crushed spirits
and clouded minds
That let their fury grow inside
until it renders them blind
Â 
We have our eyes wide open,
and for it we are hated.
We are traitors,
and we are tomorrow.
Â 
So, let the scripture of yesteryear ring true today
We aren't perfect, but we learn from our mistakes.
But we won't hear what we once had to say,
our only option is to keep wishing our time away.
Â 
This is my letter to a world that never wrote to me.
Wrote to me
This is my letter to a world that never wrote to me.
