[feat. Austin @ The Calm Before]we're just connecting the dots of past encounters
hanging on to what you know
and whatâs become far too familiar over time.
We include one another in our stagnance and time may as well stand still.
Â 
We're all servants to a master bent on our destruction,
we bow our heads and say "jump how high?"
This isn't a right, itâs a responsibility.
Â 
I'm just a sheep, but I've got a little fight in me.
A tired dog, but I've still got some bite in me.
Â 
So here's to the degradation of the pride we'd built
Do they only stand by ignorance? Is that their happy state,
The proof of their obedience and their faith?
Â 
I swear to God this is a comedy.
The cruelest joke I've never told,
but in my head, it never gets old.
Â 
We allow the crimes against ourselves,
so how can we complain?
We're the source of our own pain, so even though
I've found a place to rest my head,
I still can't sleep.
I still can't sleep at night.
The delusions are setting in,
but I still can't sleep at night.
No dreams will come, I lay and weep
I still can't sleep, I still can't sleep...
