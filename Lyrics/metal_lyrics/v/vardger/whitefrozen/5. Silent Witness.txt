Silent Witness / Use your gift of faith
Proudly present your saviour, Lord Jesus
Be not ashamed of the cross you worship
Ask for his help and he sends you his spirit

Be prepared for your Masters big fight
Order weapons through prayers
Glorify him through worship
You gain what your heart desires
And you get your reward

A parade of true believers
Is marching through the world
We show them that we believe
That our Lord Jesus is the truth

What is it that you fear?
What is it that prevents you from seeking him?
When you've got his spirit to guide you
His angels to guide you

Open up let him in so that you can be
A radical son in the battle for truth
Growing up to become more like the King

What is it that you fear...
