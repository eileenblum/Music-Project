I, a transient shadow
A serpent, the least among men
But still my name is AiÃ³n
It's graven with an iron pen

Footprints of waves of sand
A proof of your might
Though my longing hibernates
Footprints of thunder; I hail thee

Spears to the sky
The glimpse of shining armour
A vision of the latter days
Archaic rites
Unfolds the scripts of omens
Our wisdom sails to force the sky

We are transient shadows
Serpents, the least among men
But still out names are AiÃ³nios
They're graven with an iron pen
