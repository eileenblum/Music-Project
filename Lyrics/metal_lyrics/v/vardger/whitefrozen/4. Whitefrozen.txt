Upon whitefrozen tundra
The storm blows wild and free
I gaze up to the mountains
Where we will meet our needs
(In) The colours of my fire
The waves turn black and red
The northern light shines dimly
But we've seen nothing yet

For ages I have known you
The winds that blow my hair
Forgive my lack of thorns
They are more than I can bear
The signs of One Almighty
They howl between the trees
I climb the highest mountain
Upon for you I kneel
