Inferno: the evergrinding wheel
Humiliation
The flames to burn my scars
In the temple
Where man will meet his end
Hear the howling
The wolves will have their prey

Rip my chest wide open
Expose my heart of stone
Make me last forever
And burn my demon horde

Take my silver
And make it into dust
Gold to water
Inverted alchemy

Rip my chest wide open...
