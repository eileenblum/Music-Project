My sleep is broken by the deafening sound of thunder
Black clouds have dimmed the light, drowning the ship in darkness
There's no time to change the course
This may be the end of our journey

The wrath of the Gods cloaks the night sky, the waves grip the hull
The ship's being dragged to the storm, this is a trial from our Gods,
We have to prove our worth
Haul down the sail, row against this gale until we skin our hands,
Row or die!

We won't be swallowed by the sea, fighting, struggling, trying to survive
We won't be swallowed by the sea, we will earn our right to enter Valhal

My blood turns to ice when I see the vortex
The ship is heading to certain death, the maelstrom

The mast breaks down, sails rip apart, we'll not survive
All our victories, engulfed by the whirl, all was for nothing
Torn wood and twisted ropes will become my eternal grave, Ran unfolds her net

I will be swallowed by the sea, swearing, cursing a fate worse than death
I will be swallowed by the sea, drowning, lungs filling with water, feeling my life fading away
