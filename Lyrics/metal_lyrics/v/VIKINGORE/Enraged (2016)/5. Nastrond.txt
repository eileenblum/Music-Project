The cold touch of the blade
Sinking deep in my chest
Steel seals my destiny
My lungs fill with blood

I left behind all I was
I killed my kind led by rage
And now with no remorse
I breathe my last breath

I open my eyes, I see no sky
Sunken knee-deep in a sickening mire
Revolting fumes are drenching my throat
Dead bodies floating in their entrails

Death and corruption is all around
Maggots are eating the flesh of the deceased
Gasping for air in this pestilence
I faint and become one with the mud

My skin is peeling
My eyes encrusting with pus
Wading rivers of venom and blood
I'm doomed to putrefy

The shrieks of pain
Of those condemned to suffer forevermore
Pervade my mind
I'm stranded in the Corpse Shore

Trapped in this place I decay
A hall made of serpents with stinging fangs
Scrabbling the bodies in morbid waves
Their bile leaks into my wounds

I crawl on streams of poisonous lime
Surrounded by criminal scum just like me
Killers and traitors with tainted fates
A horde of limbs pulling me down

My face is melting
My legs are starting to dissolve
Wading rivers of venom and blood
I'm doomed to putrefy

The shrieks of pain
Of those condemned to suffer forevermore
Pervade my mind
I'm stranded in the Corpse Shore

In this convulsing turmoil of death
Nothing remains but the echo of a man
Now this nightmare comes to an end
The Hound of Hel is coming my way

He tears apart my flesh and bones
I'm just a pustule of grinded meat
The Great Serpent engulfs my remains
And my shadow returns to the cold of the void
