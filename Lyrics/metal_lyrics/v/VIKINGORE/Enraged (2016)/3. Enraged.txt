There's a beast trapped deep within the darkness of my mind
Unleashing a monstrous cry
It's shackles I untie
There is no turning back
By my hand you will die

Vicious retribution
Murderous intention
I cast away my humanity
A primal urge to kill consumes my sanity

Feverish addiction to lose control
Insatiable hunger, endless wrath
In this life I've only one goal
To turn the world into a bloodbath

You've crossed the line
I've lost my mind
A bloodthirsty creature
I have become

Grabbing your neck with all my strength
I start to pummel your face
Cracking bones, deforming your skull
Feeling your jaw breaking
Nothing can stop me
While I end your existence
Lacerating your skin
With my nails and my teeth
Ripping apart your flesh and ribs, blood everywhere!

Vicious retribution
Murderous intention
I cast away my humanity
A primal urge to kill consumes my sanity

Forcing through your torso
With my bare hands
Intestines exposed
I ravage your insides
As I take out your guts
I can only think:
I must release all this rage on this godless world
