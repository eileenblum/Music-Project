Born from an impure womb and the seed of treason
Encaged in the depth of the world, fear the only reason

I will engulf the earth and the sky
All that you know, all that you love will die
I am unchained

I am the harbinger of death and despair
A being made for eternal warfare
I bring the doomsday

Raised by the Asagods I grew fast and strong
And though I did no harm I was deceived and put in chains
I ate the hand that fed me I was trapped I had been betrayed
Bound and gagged with a sword, howling! Crumbling Creation!

I will engulf the earth and the sky
All that you know, all that you love will die
I am unchained

I am the harbinger of death and despair
A being made for eternal warfare
I bring the doomsday

The Sun and the Moon have been devoured
All the bindings have been broken, now I am free

I will engulf the earth and the sky
All that you know, all that you love will die
I am unchained

I am the harbinger of death and despair
A being made for eternal warfare
I bring the doomsday

RagnarÃ¶k has begun the Gods will fall one by one
The sound of Heimdall's horn upholds their self-fulfilling prophecy
I harvest my revenge devouring the source of all this madness
The all father is now just a memory from the past
Odin is dead
