The clash of wood and steel makes me feel free

The smash dulls my arm
As I parry the blow
My axe severs his leg
And blood begins to flow
A thousand arrows whistle in the air
No enemiesâ lives will be spared

Unbreakable shield wall
Shoulder to shoulder
We fight to enter the Golden Hall
United until we fall

Unbreakable shield wall
Shoulder to shoulder
As one we are unstoppable
We will crush them all

The bloodshed rages on
From dusk to dawn
They fall one by one
Soon theyâll be overrun
We charge and make them yield
Like a scythe reaping the field

Unbreakable shield wall
Shoulder to shoulder
We fight to enter the Golden Hall
United until we fall

Unbreakable shield wall
Shoulder to shoulder
As one we are unstoppable
We will crush them all

Together we stand, valiant and proud, we have no fear of death
Youâll die in dishonor, we will leave you to the crows to feast

A brother has fallen at my side, Valkyries take him to Valhal
We keep on fighting, we'll lead this bastards to Hel
I quench my weapon, I charge with my brethren at my side

Unbreakable shield wall
Shoulder to shoulder
We fight to enter the Golden Hall
United until we fall

Unbreakable shield wall
Shoulder to shoulder
As one we are unstoppable
We will crush them all
