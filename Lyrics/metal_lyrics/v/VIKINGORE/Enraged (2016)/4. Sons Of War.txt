We stain our swords in the blood of our foes in the name of the gods of war
Death awaits the enemy, they drown in their own gore
We don't care to die, the Norns have woven the threads of destiny
The sound of the horn heralds the slaughter
We are always ready for battle

The old way is the only way
We follow the nine virtues until we decay
We feel no fear, we thrive in the fray
We never spill the blood of a brother, we are the sons of war

We fight for pride
With our brothers at our side
Striking dread in the heart of our foes
As the dragonships break the tide
We will stand against the odds
We will face our fate

Claiming victory through blood and violence
Laughing at the face of danger and death
Never kneeling to any lord or crown
Nothing, no army in the nine worlds, can take us down
We are always ready for battle

The old way is the only way
We follow the nine virtues until we decay
We feel no fear, we thrive in the fray
We never spill the blood of a brother, we are the sons of war
