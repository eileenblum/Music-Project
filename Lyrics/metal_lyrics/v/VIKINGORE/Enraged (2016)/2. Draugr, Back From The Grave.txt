I wail and scream as I roam
I sleep covered in loam
I have no grave
I have no home

I am a walking abomination
I bring eternal damnation
Dark desires move me:
To sow desolation

I am the Draugr
For your flesh I crave
Your pain makes me stronger
I'm back from the grave

Weapons can't wound me
Face me if you're brave
I'm bloodthirsty, I run free
I'm back from the grave

My lust for flesh is unquenchable
My will to kill is unstoppable
No common weapon can wound me,
I am your nightmare come true

Blood dripping, meat ripping, lungs tearing
While I shove my fist down your throat
Gripping hard your entrails
Pulling them out slowly
No remorse, no regrets, my heart is cold as stone
I need more, I crave more, I hunger for meat
I am back from the grave
I am back to take your lives

I am the Draugr
For your flesh I crave
Your pain makes me stronger
I'm back from the grave

Weapons can't wound me
Face me if you're brave
I'm bloodthirsty, I run free
I'm back from the grave

My desire to kill is the only thing that comes to my mind
I can no longer live with mortal beings of any kind
Envy, I envy everything that breathes
Feed, I must feed from the human beings

I will crush you as you sleep
I will laugh as you bleed
I will hear your children weep
They will watch as I feed

I am the Draugr
For your flesh I crave
Your pain makes me stronger
I'm back from the grave

Weapons can't wound me
Face me if you're brave
I'm bloodthirsty, I run free
I'm back from the grave

Blood dripping, meat ripping, lungs tearing
While I shove my fist down your throat
Gripping hard your entrails
Pulling them out slowly
No remorse, no regrets, my heart is cold as stone
I need more, I crave more, I hunger for meat
I am back from the grave
I am back to take your lives
