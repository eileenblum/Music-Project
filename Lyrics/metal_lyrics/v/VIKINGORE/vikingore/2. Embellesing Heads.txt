Stand up strong before the enemy
Raise your axes and hammers
No one will get to walk away
Together we will get to victory

Horses have begun to ride
Rites are going to start
Troops will soon unfold
Assassins are starting to hide

To fight with our hearts
To live to die for a glorious empire
We are always standing high
Our souls will never expire

Your extreme unction is so close
You can smell the oil in your head
Now realising that it is not true
That oil is the blood of your head

Clashing shields, raining axes
Slashes to the wind, sing your fall
The air is still whipping hard
Your limbs in the ground now freeze

Horses have begun to fight
End of the rites is near
Troops now search the remains
Assassins now will never see the day

A mass of mutilated bodies
Embellish our plains
Enemies' heads have been collected
Now embellish our weapons and horses
Bodies' flames purifies our land
Now the stench has disappeared of their king
