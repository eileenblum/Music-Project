Injury against our women,
Disembowelment is their punishment.
For the honour of the [2x]
For the honour of the Norsemen!
They find only death [3x]
Death! [2x]
Only death!.

Take out the lungs of their backs
How it is written in our code,
Hanged from two hooks,
Now they suffer and fall. [2x]

Feasts to greke and freke,
Ravens stab their bills,

Odin smiles in his throne,
The bloody eagle has begun. [2x]
