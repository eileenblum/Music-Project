The best of hunts was promised
The blind one believed his word
A mistletoe that pierced his heart
The pure God got killed by the most evil of deeds

Odin cries out the deepest pain cry
Balder's pyre lights
the sad mankind's night

All of us, his death we have to regret
All of us, for him to turn back alive
All of us, for the pure one to revive
All of us, Balder to turn back alive
Trapped in thick walls of stone
Walking lost, all alone
Broken pride and broken throne
Listen to the howl of souls
In the darkness of the Nine Worlds
Stands the White Justice Hall
Odin cries out the deepest pain cry

Soon, the Gods of Asgard arose
The chase of the guilty has started

All of us, his death we have to regret
All of us, for him to turn back alive
All of us, for the pure one to revive
All of us, Balder to turn back alive
Trapped in thick walls of stone
Walking lost, all alone
Broken pride and broken throne
Listen to the howl of souls
In the darkness of the Nine Worlds
Stands the White justice Hall
Odin cries out the deepest pain cry

Chains made of the most pure iron
Heart and lungs wide open
For the eternal punishment
His sins will be paid, will be paid

Snake fangs drop hot poison
In his blackened guts
Squirming in his oven pain
'Till the End
