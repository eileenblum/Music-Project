Winds howl in front of us
Like a wolf's mourning
Today is a grim day
A brother has been slain

The only thing we know
Is that it hasn't been any of us
Because we are born from nature
Family is our only home

Together we are like a storm in the sea
Ripping and killing everything we see
Our strikes have the strength of crashing waves
Hear the sound of the wolves' wrath

Raising our hand-made weapons
Together to the moon we shout
No one of us will rest 'tit he's found
The man-hunt has begun

We are born from hate and pain
Left alone in the woods
Nature has been our home and pride
Nobody disturbs our land

After running 'til exhaustion
Not noticing our fatigue
We find rests of a bonfire
Vengeance is near

Together we are like a storm in the sea
Ripping and killing everything we see
Our strikes have the strength of crashing waves
Hear the sound of the wolves' wrath!

The footprints lead to a precipice
He is still, waiting for us to come
Our first strike makes him fall
Mercy we don't know at all

We flow through battle
Like waves of death
Hearts of rock and fire
Trapped in bodies of flesh
With our weapons they taste
The end of their lives
Hear the sound of the wolves' wrath
