Ghoulish city
Awoken like a worm's pit
Insanity will be through years
Prepare for war

Says a voice into my mind
Yelling and praying to our Gods
Horror and fear have conic

Onset of Ragnarok
Let us some time to fight
One-eyed-God will return and die
Chances of war will be ours

Another battle will be waged
Under the hammer of fate
Stench of Naglfar in the air
Here begun the undeads' rising

We wait like
A chainsaw for a rain
Of guts and gore
Time to last
Carnage has begun
When the sun falls

Annihilation is our fate
Pain is our name
A storm of bullets bursts them
Nuclear winter will arrive

Zombies devour last human roots
Endless reign hurls Suitor's flames
Rotten earth comes to an end
Fire consumes all flesh

Another battle will be waged
Under the hammer of fate
Stench of Naglfar in the air
Here begun the undeads' rising
