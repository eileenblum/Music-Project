Whispers in my mind tell me to kill my kind

Through many a moon, I've been king above warriors
I've grown decrepitly, death lurks while I steep
Fearing the end I bred a long line heirs
Sucking the life from me

Sometimes I hear screams in my head
Tells me that I must see my children dead
Of their flesh I must feed
They'll give me immortality

Kill, kill, kill, kill!
Die, die, die, die!
Devour, devour, devour!

It's too lace. time to eviscerate
in my heart I only feel hate
âWorry no more my son.
your pain will soon be goneâ
You shall live for evermore
to my flesh you must all regress
Stop screaming, you will serve to a superior being

New kingdoms will be born upon corpses and bones
I'll crown myself with my the entrails of my progeny
Eating, feasting, nurturing my body and soul
While I cannibalize I realize the truth of life

I feel alive! I breathe again!

Tonight a special dinner will be served
upon my butchered scions
Cups of blood, roasted legs,
the food I will ingurgitate
Nobody will ever know our little secret
My hounds will munch your bones

Kingdoms have come with a regent
that has been born
My rotten children's skins my clothes will adorn
Dancing, feasting, I am complete once more
My existence is endless, I will never be hoar

Alas, misfortune has arrived to me
A witness of my killing spree
Extermination, your salvation
Rip your tongue off your mouth

Rotten mind, rotten soul, rotten life, rotten throne
Rot and cry on your own, rot and die all alone
Feasting upon the butchered
Feasting upon the slain
