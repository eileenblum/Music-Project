Courage, hospitality, honour, fidelity
Discipline, truth, productivity, self control
Perseverance, are the nine noble virtues
The path of the heroes of old guides our way

The Gods taught us how to live and die
we'll follow them to the grave
In Valhal we will meet our brethren
with weapons in hand
with weapons in hand we must fall
Nature spirits burn inside us
their flame cleanses all fear

Courage, hospitality, honour, fidelity
Discipline, truth, productivity, self control
Perseverance, are the nine noble virtues
The path of the heroes of old guides our way

Our Seidrkonur leads to battle
and to victory we will ride
Strength, nature axe and shield be with us
they'll lead us to our freedom
Lords or religion won't make us bend
we'll fight for glory 'til the end
We are proud of our belief and our fury
We will die with dignity
We will die with dignity
Onwards we will charge

Food made of flesh
Runes made of bones
To the ground they fell
Enemies will go to hell

This is how it's been passed
This is how it will be
We'll carry on with Oden's wish
Through eternity
Through eternity!

Our Seidrkonur leads to battle
and to victory we will ride
Strength, nature axe and shield be with us
they'll lead us to our freedom
Lords or religion won't make us bend
we'll fight for glory 'til the end
We are proud of our belief and our fury
We will die with dignity
We will die with dignity
Onwards we will charge
