Hatred in our hearts
Death written in our mind
Blood covers our hands
Glory is what we desire
Skulls hanging in our banners,
bones in our shields

Our strength is feared throughout the world
enemies shiver at our sight
We embody truth in our words
Our souls burn with might
Carrying our weapons and hearts
our strikes make their bones crack
Enraged by deprivation
our cries make their ears blow

Stomping and crushing
with all our hate and fury
forgotten by the Gods
They have tried to crush us
by force we broke their pride,
forgotten by the Gods

Legions of wrath and fire
When we march earth shakes at our feet
We live believing in ourselves
We are the forgotten by the Gods

We laugh at the face of death
We trust in our brutal strength
Together fear and terror we'll spread
like united brothers, or die in hell
We survive every time life tries to make us bend
even though it gets to rend our souls and minds

Stomping and crushing
with all our hate and fury
forgotten by the Gods
They have tried to crush us
by force we broke their pride,
forgotten by the Gods

Look at the sky! we are alone!
Our paradise is gone
We live believing in ourselves
We are the forgotten by the Goods

More than once, we have fallen
But we are hard to kill
Their blood chills ice cold
When we stand up again and fight
Together we'll ride
Together we'll fight
Together we'll die
