The fray is near
hate fills my veins I'll let it go
free my wrath
fear my weapon your belief is your death
A wave of enraged beings
will flow through the battlefield
drowning every drop of life in a sea of blood

Humanity will arrive to his end
crushed by the animal fury
there's no way to escape, squirm
suffer, surrender and die
Slash, kill, bite and mutilate
like a demon I charge
Animal skin on my head
your skull in my hands

Let the anger speak for me
As I rip apart your guts
Let the anger kill for me
As the red fog clouds my eyes
Dislocate my jaw with laughter
Turning battle into slaughter
I spit foam on your face
While I bite away your limbs

Insanity will seize my mind
the rage turns my eyes blind
A brutal madness destroys mankind
by the red fog you will be twined

Possessed by a trance
leaving you no chance
Tearing your body limb by limb
For the madness within I feel no pain
My insanity I will embrace
Your flesh I will taste
Your blood I will drink
Your entrails I will spill
Your children I will kill
We are as mad as wolves
Feel our fangs sink
In your wounded meat
We are the berserkergang

Let the anger speak for me
As I rip apart your guts
Let the anger kill for me
As the red fog clouds my eyes
Dislocate my jaw with laughter
Turning battle into slaughter
I spit foam on your face
While I bite away your limbs

Possessed by a trance
leaving you no chance
Tearing your body limb by limb
For the madness within I feel no pain
My insanity I will embrace
Your flesh I will taste
Your blood I will drink
Your entrails I will spill
Your children I will kill
We are as mad as wolves
Feel our fangs sink
In your wounded meat
We are the berserkergang
