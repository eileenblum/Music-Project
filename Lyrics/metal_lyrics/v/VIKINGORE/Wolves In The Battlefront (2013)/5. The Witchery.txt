World changes around me
My fatherland will turn into cold stone jails
In front of two blazes
All will be decided
My hard step halts the flame

Proud of my blood
Proud of my own path
Proud of my roots
Roots of wisdom and wrath
Proud of my blood
Proud of my own path
Path of wisdom and wrath

I see your eyes through the blaze,
the fire bursts my veins
Guide my steel to behead
the bastard I damn with my oath
You'll have your glory
but you'll be cruel murderers
The same holy fire
that burns children and innocents
will consume your sanctity,
The prayers that for you are sacred
will turn into hatred

Pure warriors will charge
through the battlefield
cleansing the world of heathens
as they think fit
But you will also betray their faith

Runes listened by the Gods,
Thrown through my throat,
Thor wields the hammer versus the cross
Wolves began to run
Witchery upon the land

Land of my blood
Land of my own path
Land of my roots
Roots of wisdom and wrath
Proud of my blood
Proud of my own path
Path of wisdom and wrath

I see your eyes through the blaze,
the fire bursts my veins
Guide my steel to behead
the bastard I damn with my oath
You'll have your glory
but you'll be cruel murderers
The same holy fire
that burns children and innocents
will consume your sanctity
The prayers that for you are sacred
will turn into hatred

You will burn
in the same hell you brought to us
False fanatics will carry your flags of lies
Poisoning your world with purulence

Valkyries ride beneath the sky
Now the wolf is the man I used to be
Run by your side for hundred years
Wolves run over the battlefield

The sacrifice in fire was not in vain
Rivers of flames drown the enemy in pain
The curse of the betrayed one has been done
Wolves are running over the battlefield
And raise the ancient witchery
