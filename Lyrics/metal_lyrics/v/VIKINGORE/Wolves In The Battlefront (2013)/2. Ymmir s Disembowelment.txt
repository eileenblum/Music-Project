Between fire and ice
In the darkness of Ginnungagap
He was born, stories will be told
Damnation to the Gods he will carry
His sole existence is to bring purulence
Poisoning the universe with decadence
The father of all the giants of old

Fed by Audumbla
Bringer of all evil
His legs will copulate
And bring the giant race

The third day passed by
And Buri was soon discovered
His grandsons born with grace
By wisdom they all were embraced
They will create the human race
But they will also need a world for them

Vile, VÃ© and Odin
Plotted is murder
The first slaughter
And with his death
Midgard was built

His blood drowned his kind,
and gave birth to the seas
His brains made the sky,
with the sparks, the stars
His skull made a fortress
for the Gods of Asgard
His bones made the mountains,
with his flesh the soil

This is how it all started
With brutality and a genocide
Only two giants survived
To perpetuate their kind
The primordial butchery
Ymir's disembowelment
Ymir's disembowelment
