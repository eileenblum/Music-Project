Synthetically
Created substance
Transforming proportions
Of body so strange

Change of reality
By the reactions of the chemicals
Depression and anger
Replaced by illusions

A beast revived can not defy
(Emotion of) incompletence
If someone refuses to deify

A new personality
By the reactions of the chemicals
All dimensions of worlds
So near but so far

Paying expensively with life
The consumance of financy

Causing the endpoint of another addicts life
Living in the wrong side
Just for the desire to get hing
Misunderstanding the meaning of time

Playing excessively with mind
The lack of mentality

Change of reality
By the reactions of the chemicals
Depression and anger
Replaced by illusions
A new personality
By the reactions of the chemicals
All dimensions of worlds
So near but so far
