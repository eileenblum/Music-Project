Flick of the dead, life's passing by eyes
There's only pain and everything flies
Remembering the moment of birth and pain
When memories end it feels like the same

Bleeding
Completely red
Internal organs are outside
From their shell

Skin cut with a knife, an guts are outside
Made part of a machine, it's impossible to shout
Sudden sharp pain, bloodpressure decreasing inside the veins
Slowly blacking out in the brains all is starting to fade

Feeling
Completely pale
Inner thoughts are outside
From their shell

Chaos taking over in the operating-room
Mistake that was made with an improvement tool
Cut wrong in a deadly position
Nightmare of every surgeon

Voices going every moment more far away
Mind is starting to turn to grey
Flash of the brightest light never seen...
Total darkness and calmness
