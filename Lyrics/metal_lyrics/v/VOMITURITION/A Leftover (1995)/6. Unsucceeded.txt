Lack of success in the start
Umbilical cord around neck
Whispers (from the other side) heard for the first time
Summoning to a stable state

Unsuccessfully died for the first time
Body holding enough life to survive

Too long without oxygen
Major braindamage created
Just survived from the death
Unable to communicate

Totally unsucceeded as a child
No-one to care for or to live by
Totally unsucceeded life
Nothing to live for - no way to die

Life's passing by - Institutionalized
Can't understand when to feel good or bad

Parents passed away in an ancient
Relatives couldn't take the shame
Pushed in orphanage all alone
Left in there without a friendly soul

Totally unsucceeded as a child
No-one to care for or to live by
Totally unsucceeded life
Nothing to live for - no way to die

From institution to another
Meaningless transportation of disabled
