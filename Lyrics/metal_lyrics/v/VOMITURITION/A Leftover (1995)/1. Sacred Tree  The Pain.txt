Emotions changing from anger to despair
Feelings filled with fear and emptiness

How can I live to see tomorrow?
How will I face today?

Mentally - so weak but so strong
Physically - so strong but so weak

Which is the best way to deal with the reality?
How am I able to get over this?

The pain inside of me
Outside of myself
Forever stronger than ever
Between all I have around
