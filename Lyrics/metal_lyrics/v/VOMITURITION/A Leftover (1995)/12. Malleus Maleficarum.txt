Nobody talks about her anymore
They all have thoughts they hadn't before
Relief and peace is what they need
And requires someone to bleed

Malleus Maleficarum
Converted her differency to her doom
Burned at the stake
An innocent look in her face

She didn't do no harm
Never to hurt anyone
Envy and hate...
To misfortunous fate

Malleus Maleficarum
Converted her differency to her doom
Burned at the stake
An innocent look in her face

Nobody talks about her anymore
Relief all have thoughts they hadn't before
Relief and peace is what they need
And that required someone to bleed

Malleus Maleficarum
Malleus Maleficarum
Malleus Maleficarum
