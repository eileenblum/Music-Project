It never rests,
This is the lifeline,
With no reward,
And no repose.

It never stops,
Eyes, trained upon the future.
There are no guides,
Just tall tales of absolution.

On the brink of desolation,
Tormentor from the murky hues,
Behind, the shadow of ruin.

I can see everything.
I can feel... everything.

The severance, the thrill.
Reborn... at will.

In the churning throes of death,
Beneath the crashing waves,
Taller than the rest,
Drowned, reborn abomination.

I can see everything.
I can feel... everything.

The severance, the thrill.
Reborn... at will.

Vision beyond the wounded sky,
Last words you'll speak before you die.
The future, the past, too blind to see,
Shackled and bound, by your reality.

It never rests,
This is the lifeline,
With no reward,
And no regrets
