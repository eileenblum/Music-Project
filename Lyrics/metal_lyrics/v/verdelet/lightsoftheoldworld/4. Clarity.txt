The mind seeks out the thoughts that rule,
A vision that's so pure and true.
Unprincipled reflections luring, taunting,
Reaching into every corner,
Behind every closed door.

All through your righteous aeons yearning,
Eternal intrusion, insanity and confusion.

Decaying, the mortal lies burden,
Contradictions burning,
Crying out in torment,
Malicious and disguised.

Deceit, the nightmares haunting,
Destroying life unending.
Despair, dreams so pale and weak,
Fear of life and pleasures undenied.
You wait, trapped by your own inaction,
The lies you hold within yourself.
Eternity, a passing place,
That soon lies under dust.
Too late to live again.

In fevered mind,
Of dark sensation,
Masochistic self-denial,
Fettered into bliss.

Deceit, the nightmares haunting,
Destroying life unending.
Despair, dreams so pale and weak.
Fear of life and pleasures undenied.

In fevered mind,
Of dark sensation,
Masochistic self-denial,
Fettered into bliss.

Broken walls are falling,
Transcending mythic paradise.
Torn veils of illusion,
Evolving cursed life.

Murmurs upon the snarling breeze,
Breathing new vitality,
Into life of which you dream,
Soulless and unredeemed.
