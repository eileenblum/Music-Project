Bring out your dead.

Primordial curse, earth born slave,
Unrivalled passage to the grave,
A hideous plight from a touch so slight,
Runs amok the day.

Cauterize the living flesh,
Blackened house of blood.
Painted symbols above the doorway,
Cast out the flood.

Bring out your dead

Weary betrothed, no escape.
It will turn to face each move you make.
On the journey into the dismal light,
Treacherous creature freed of life.

Consuming flesh by slow decay,
Creeping death abroad this day,
Hear the burning witness wail,
If blood runs, the breath will fail.

Waiting among the dead for death to come,
Abandoned child, forgotten son.
To conquer and conquering,
Upon a pale horse,
Merciless pestilence roars.

Piling high the mortal rain,
Into the pit of bodies slain.
Marked for death by knowing eyes,
By rootless phantom, stripped of life.

Hear the burning witness wail,
If blood runs, the breath will fail.

Delirium, climbing the walls,
Morbid paradise of pain.
Fallen by the wayside,
With nothing left to regain

Funereal,
Wretched gloom so dismal.
Suffering,
Becomes the life of all.

Weary betrothed, no escape.
It will turn to face each move you make.
On the journey into the dismal light,
Treacherous creature freed of life.

Bring out your dead
