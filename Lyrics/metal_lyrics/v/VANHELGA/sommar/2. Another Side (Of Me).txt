Can you remember
the last time you could feel
this happy
without asking yourself
"is this even real?"

I'm still sure this is all a dream
Meaningless hours spent waiting
more to come, but it's time to let go
The end has never seemed so compelling

Before the great collapse
everything shall fall with me
Today is a nice day
for the next eon, a new life
I'm speechless yet again

Something within these walls
is trying to break free
another part of what used to surround us
another former dead side of me
