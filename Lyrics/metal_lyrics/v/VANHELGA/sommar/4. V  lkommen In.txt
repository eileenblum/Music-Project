Let me welcome you
Furthermost into the empty space
Because I have grown tired
And I canât take it anymore
A sharp knife in my hand
So open the door now
You call it ridiculous
But for me it is serious
You know that
Because it is in the air

Excuse me, do you remember me?
No, I didnât think so
You donât recognize a masked face
Back for revenge
With crazy red eyes
It doesnât stop with a heated discussion or scolding
Death or assault
Knifing or rape
Kidnapping and torture
I haunt you to death
Not even your soul is safe
Because I donât give up
Before all light is out

Feel my dedication
In this calm before the storm
Every day feels to heavy
And a longing after suicide
Is so much more than just fantasies
Thoughts and empty words
In which I can relate to
Because insight demands more than understanding
Intensive for the innumerable
Rewarding as long as the individual stand by himself
Rewarded with a tactic all-seeing
Which explains a psychotic behaviour

Then itâs just getting to the point
Yes, itâs called gravity
I donât understand the meaning of "sorry"
Because while I dig grave after grave
I wonder
If the difference is so big between
Broken veins and broken promises?
