The blackest of horizons
It's beauty speaking to me
Haunting woods of ghastly landscapes
This is where I belong
Amongst the fog
In solitude
Night eternal â the reaper is calling
Nocturnal thirst â for nothingness
Eternal night â finally it's you and me
Under the starlite sky
Hypnotized by the moon
Windy and stormy, the weather engulfs me
Energized by it's primal force
My sense are cold as ice and I long for eternal solitude
The candle shines no more
