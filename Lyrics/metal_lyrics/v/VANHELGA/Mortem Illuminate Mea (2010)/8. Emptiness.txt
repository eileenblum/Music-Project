Complex patchwork of leaves
Hidden behind the borders of trees
The moon shines stronger than a nuclear blow
And the snow is slowly falling
Down

Struck, the tunnel twist and turns
Sacred creatures of a lost world
Turning and twisting

Nothing can exist here int his cold place of a desolate location
Never-ending source of energy
The realms of the anti-christ
And the snow is slowly falling
Down

Struck, the tunnel's mist burns
Profane creatures of a mundane world
Destroying and obliterating

Life gone, the trees faded away
Meaning gone as the leaves are just atoms of unknown kind
Bound to worthlessness
And the snow is no more
No more
