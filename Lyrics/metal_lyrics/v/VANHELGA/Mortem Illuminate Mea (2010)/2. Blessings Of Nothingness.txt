Desolate, empty landscape of living creatures
Possessed by a creature not of this world
Staring, with eyes glowing red, upon the body of the tonal
Nothing here can oppose this being of total nothingness yet it possesses all

Dreams of a world, vanquished
Realization of all and none
Illuminate

Qliphothic storms blowing inside
Unstoppable force of beautiful destruction
Enter into this world and vanquish it's deceitful ways
Bless me with nothingness, bathe me in death

Illusions of a world, vanquished
Realization of all and none
Illuminate

Bless me with nothingness, bathe me in death!
