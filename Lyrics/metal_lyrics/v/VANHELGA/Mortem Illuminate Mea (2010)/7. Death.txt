Haunted by nightshades that emerge from a reasonal state of mind
Weakness, depression, uncertainty which results in loss of control
Trapped by reason, forever blindfolded by the stars

Death, comes to me, death
I feel your presence, so divine

Euphoric state of emptiness, extinguishing the stars
The path of Lucifer, I forever walk
Forever engulfed by the liberated madness

Death, come to me
Your presence is I
Death, set me free
Your presence is all
Death, I am death
Your presence is none

All is one, all is none
Vocabulary of the corruption of all, none
When I die I shall live

Death, your presence is I, I am death
Finally yet eternally

Death, come to me
Your presence is I
Death, set me free
Your presence is all
Death, I am death
Your presence is none
