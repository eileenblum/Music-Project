I've been waiting for someone for so long
I've been lacking compassion for so long
In spite of the evidence I am not okay
I am building a monster to carry me away

I've been away from the sunshine for so long
I've been nursing my patient for so long
This time I'm coming out the other side
Don't you dare to notice me 'cause, I am not alive

This is only another condition your mind has found
Still you're steering directly at the flames
You must face these conclusions or else they will bring you down
You won't even remember why she came

Patience, please I believe it's over now.

Emily, how do we recover from this fall

I've been waiting for someone for so long
I've been lacking compassion for so long
In spite of the evidence I am not okay
I am building a monster
