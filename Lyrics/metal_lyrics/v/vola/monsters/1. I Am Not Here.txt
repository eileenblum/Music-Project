Houses, water
I appear
But I am not here

Faster, though weaker than before
I appear
But I am not here

I believe in you
There's a simple story
We will make it through
Don't you ever worry
I believe in you
There's a simple story
We will make it through

And we will leave these
Houses, further from the core
I appear
I appear

I believe in you
There's a simple story
We will make it through
Don't you ever worry
I believe in you
There's a simple story
We will make it through
And we will leave these houses

There is something beautiful crawling under violence
There is something vulnerable moving into silence
Where is the sustainable?
I don't see the colorful, now

But I believe in you
There's a simple story
We will make it through
And don't you ever worry
I believe in you
There's a simple story
We will make it through
