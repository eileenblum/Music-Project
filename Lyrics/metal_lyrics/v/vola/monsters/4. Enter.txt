This is a new deception
I haven't come to ease your pain
I wear a head so hollow
You'll never know what I contain

This is no talk of God
This is a voice you've never heard
I have a tongue so full of flies
I am afraid to speak a word

Now it's time to redefine your maker
Now it's time to answer how you came to move
Down in every spiral
What have you become by now?

I am the gloom around your midday light
I am the hive
Now won't you please engage me to a fight?
'Cause this is where I come alive
Yeah

Now it's time to redefine your maker
Now it's time to answer how you came to move
Down in every spiral
What have you become by now?

Now it's time to redefine your maker
Now it's time to answer how you came to move
Down in every spiral
What have you become by now?
