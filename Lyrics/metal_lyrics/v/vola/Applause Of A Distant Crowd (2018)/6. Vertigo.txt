Cut it to the right size.
I'm telling you.
Your portrait is a straight line to vertigo.
Kneeling in a black fire and leaving you.
Walking on a glass wire without falling through.

Don't be afraid of this memory.
(This light sure is a murder. This warmth bringing it further).
We made the greatest noise, didn't we?
(This room leaving me perfectly still).
Won't you return to me, memory?
(This car parked in the driveway. This week left on a Tuesday).
Are you the same as you used to be?
(This room leaving me perfectly still).
