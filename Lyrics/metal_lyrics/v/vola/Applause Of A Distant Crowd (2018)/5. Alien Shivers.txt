Everlasting friend why are you so certain?
Why do you defend this contagious burden?
Are you still here?

This confrontation killing the perfect one.
Alien shivers stalling his victory run (come along with me).
Drifting away as the dopamine ray of his sun appears.

Radiant and free.
Eyes were sore from laughter.
Now you claim to see purpose in disaster.
Are you still here?
