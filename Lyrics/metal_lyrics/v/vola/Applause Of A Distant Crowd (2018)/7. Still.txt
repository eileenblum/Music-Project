You're off to set the record straight.
Hurling down the road.
Your mind is heaving heavily.
You will is getting old.

Still you bother.
Still you wish to be clear.
Still you bother to make it disappear.

You're done accepting casualties.
The living should live.
You've seen the executioner permitted to forgive.

Ending themes find me constantly.
(Look through this red window).
Stormy day sweep the burst away.
(Steer through this red water).
