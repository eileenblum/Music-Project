You see me through glaciers.
You feel me through the floor.
You need me like the rainbow.
You leave me by the door.

You see me through glaciers.
You feel me through the floor.
You lead me like the rainbow.
You leave me by the door.

Excuse me while my intentions are lost.
You'll find them under the rainbows we crossed.
Excuse me while my intentions are lost.
There must be some way out of here.

I hide under a broken kite of the days we spent in the blue.
I went up to the building-tops in the light transcending from you.
I try to be the same inside, we will change but will we complete?
I will have to escape your arms and take what I need.

Excuse me while my intentions are lost.
You'll find them under the rainbows we crossed.
Excuse me while my intentions are lost.
There must be some way out of here.
