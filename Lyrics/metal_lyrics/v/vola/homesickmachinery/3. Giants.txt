Giants came
They were smaller than the seas, so were all the same
Giants came
They grew taller than the trees, and so we became

And we might wonder why they're here
How did the giants come so near?
If we stand taller their relevance is unclear
When will it appear?

Giants came
They had blood between their lines, hung from their name
Silence came
No sound no nothing, giants to blame

And we might wonder why they're here
How did the giants come so near?
If we stand taller their relevance is unclear
When will it appear?

In the rays of sound a fortune has been found, moving in our circles
From the borderline, forever we design
The endless we form, the child in the storm by the feet of the giants
