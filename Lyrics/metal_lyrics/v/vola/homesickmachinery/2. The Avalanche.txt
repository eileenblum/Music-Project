Do you wonder why you wake up with your head inside a flame?
Do you even care to notice the strings you bear?
Did you ever grab the centuries applying to your name?
The avalanche has spoken, what do you hear?

Run all the way, let me feel the earth come down
Crawl as you fade, and we feel the earth come down

Do you wonder why you wake up with a blade upon your skin?
Cutting every frame you follow and every fear
Would you tie a rope around the sun to see the march begin? The avalanche has spoken what do you hear?

Run all the way, let me feel the earth come down
Crawl as you fade, and we feel the earth come down
