[Lyrics &amp; music by Emre KasapoÄlu]

Over..the game is over by my hands
Sober..I sober down within my hell
Again I walk this line lonely and faint
Depression of a man mustnât have this end
My cancellation, it has just begun..

Farewell..A last goodbye to every sin
Hatred..I feel it more than everything
A lunacy sudden, or an amok you can think
But never gone that way, just a cowardly reverie
My solitude humping my brain
Its people and the crowd drove me insane..

The more I have the murk, lost my connections
Unbeknown sacrifice
The beasts, they infiltrate me
Now Iâm petrified
Everybody is talking, talking too much baloney
Itâs a kind of evil, as it closes in

When the light is in, my grief will block the sun
These tenebrous days, indulgence of mine has gone..and done..

The scissors of my life started to function
Cut me off and desolate
Left me without ointment, but a frozen rage
Glamour of the slumber
Feel no lech or love
I nourish my evil, as it ingests me

When the light is in, my grief will block the sun
These tenebrous days, indulgence of mine has gone..and done..

Operation to feel
Not an easy riddle
You need a sacrifice, I concede
Drain off my blood!
Even if it costs
Creepy, low existence
Let me out of haze!
Jail my infamous rage!

When the light is in, my grief will block the sun
These tenebrous days, indulgence of mine has gone..and done
