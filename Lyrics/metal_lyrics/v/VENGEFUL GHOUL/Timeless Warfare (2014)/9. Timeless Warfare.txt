[Lyrics &amp; music by Senem Ãndemir &amp; Emre KasapoÄlu]

Behind this involution canât keep sleeping
Thoughts stucked in my head and mind canât forget
Does time decrease for a little peace
I let myself flow in the wind

To the goodness, struggling with hope
They wonât hypnotize us, some eyes can see all
Start to realize whatâs going on and on
Here itâs the twilight zone

I came along with sorrow, but pertinacious hope
Never gonna succumb, we handle as a whole
Those who will sell their honesty
The frost of dignity

We should prepare to the endless war
Obviously hazy when itâ cuts along
Your god canât help counterworking it
This is the hell indeed

Color and gender must unite
Donât let them take you all apart
To the nations, overruled
We must speak rebellious!

Begins with the civil war and turns to the war of worlds
No petrol no guns nor a land
Itâs just the self-actualization
Who wants to be the owner of this universe?
Take the place of god, continous attempt
Kill that child for god, infamous trend

Timeless..Warfare..Timeless..Warfare
