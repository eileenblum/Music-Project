[Lyrics &amp; music by Emre KasapoÄlu]

The greed, the passion
For oily side of heaven
The bloody raid they see
Six days of havoc
Manic screams in panic
For democrasy..

Mercenary rapists
The innocence is enmeshed
Tomorrow will be reigned by
United thugs of wisdom
Domestication
With childhood putrefaction
The holy trooperâs gift was
This chained freedom

Theyâll beat the future,
Ignite the catholic fever
And satisfy their needs
The world delighted
Sale of guns contented
Slaying sinless seeds..

Mercenary rapists
The innocence is enmeshed
Tomorrow will be reigned by
United thugs of wisdom
Domestication
With childhood putrefaction
The holy trooperâs gift was
This chained freedom

Liberty stifled
Racialist alignment
Religions keep on feed this
Flinty despot evil
Contamination
Sheepish population
The scurvy mankindâs gift was
This chained freedom

The form of amity withers away
Your god has been deafened, he canât hear you pray
The heart of all believes tarnishing you
Theyâve chained the freedom
Another wartime has prevailed..

War! He canât hear you pray..
He canât hear you pray..
He canât hear you pray..
