[Lyrics by Senem Ãndemir &amp; Emre KasapoÄlu, music by ÃzgÃ¼r Nair]

I feel the void in my brain
Canât judge , my mind is inmate
A guard, theyâre calling him as lord
And he came composedly to give the word

âSince the mankindâs existence
Rivers filled all with tears
I want you just to trust me
The evenness is near..
Since the mankindâs existence
Rivers filled all with tearsâ

Mono-race and mono-state are close
With the chip weâre all comatose
And heâs ready to impose

âSince the mankindâs existence
Rivers filled all with tears
I want you just to trust me
The evenness is near..
Since the mankindâs existence
Rivers filled all with tearsâ

Automaton, numb communion this is all we got!

They took the conscience, they took the gold
Avid abundance, they had the world
Evil bloodline still rules the war

Their chaos is so solid,our minds canât control it..

Freedom and love are all sealed
Mankind atrociously deceived
And their souls began to be deceased

âSince the mankindâs existence
Rivers filled all with tearsâ
They want me just to trust them

The evenness is sinking, hope is dying, every life is gone!
