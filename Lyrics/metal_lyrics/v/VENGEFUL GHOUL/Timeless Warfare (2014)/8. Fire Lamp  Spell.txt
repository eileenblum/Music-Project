[Lyrics &amp; music by Emre KasapoÄlu]

In a curious mood, seeking trouble and voodoo
A trip to Kenya
The season was warm, the hottest hell
The way of dirt, a sensation of thirst
Made us beseeching
Already the darkness fell over the land

Things getting worse over time..The fire and spell..

As the tribe goes hoofing it
A ceremony
We do know why we are here
Fatality
Decoy!

One of us was the judas
The witch head was him
He puts a jinx on our blood-fate
Coagulates
With magic!

Who will be now heroic?
Shall we dwell or pass in?
(This spell canât be broken..)

The loading I will shoulder
Made by ancient wizards
(And the sand turns to a bloody hell..)

The fire and spell..

When the fire cuts in the night
Iâm incurable
The black magic wanders in my veins
And forever
The prison!

When the loneliness raped a man
He murdered his way
Decided to write a new fiction
The pages decayed

The power of magic was the power in me!
