[Lyrics &amp; music by Emre KasapoÄlu]

All nations under the cosmical dementia
Wretched people enslaved for the phobia
The sickness going through the night and misery
No way to struggle or war, thereâs no battlefield

And I am waiting for a sign
Inciting me to fight and die
And I am looking for a way
That leads me to the sovereign place

Itâs not on me or not on you
I canât deny that selfishness we ever do

For the years of devotion and poverty
Religions grafted bigot degeneracy
The disease started to win and slave our kind
The devil cedes the malice, her democracy

Still I am waiting for that sign
That forces me to run and hide
Still I am looking for that way
Leading us to the sovereign place

I ran and covered up my mind
Forces of hell
An invasion of the Seerâs sound

Walk with me to the sovereign place
Our faith abused, brotherhood in haze
Weâre all alone, you better hold my hand
We can not hide, we must go my friend!

Neither a way nor a sign
The victory was in our hearts
Millions of bodies, hell to pay
A new order in the sovereign place

After the end of this world
Weâll see the dawn
And freedomâs scream will be heard

Dawn on the sovereign place..

Dawn on the sovereign place..

War....War....War....War....
