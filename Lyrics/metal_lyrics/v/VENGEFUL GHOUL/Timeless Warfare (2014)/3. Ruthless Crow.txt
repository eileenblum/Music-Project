[Lyrics &amp; music by Emre KasapoÄlu]

Demonic wizard in a secret place
Raging on magical fault
Itâs not a biologic infamy
This is the curse of all cults

Ruthless crow..Heâs fighting without law
Ruthless crow..Threatening he will grow

An evil predication said and done
Declaring war against folk
The birds are swooping down the village place
As the apostle crow woke

Ruthless crow..Heâs fighting without law
Ruthless crow..Threatening he will grow
Ruthless crow..The killer wings of hell
Ruthless crow..Psycho under spell

Determination..Obliteration..Exasperation..Deteriorates!!

Unholy wings upon the streets
You are the center of a nightmare
You can not stand, even not tend
Continual killing, heâs malcontent

Hunting the sky formed in his eyes
He draws the living creatures own his side
He will unlock the gates of hell
The god of light canât break this spell

Mutated livings spread the fatal ill
The wizards recipe rules
Religion created by the manic fear
They all began to worship

Ruthless crow..Heâs fighting without law
Ruthless crow..Threatening he will grow
Ruthless crow..The killer wings of hell
Ruthless crow..Psycho under spell

Determination..Obliteration..He is grasping!!
