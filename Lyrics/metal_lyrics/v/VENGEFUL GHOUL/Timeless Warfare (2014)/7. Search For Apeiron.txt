[Lyrics &amp; music by Emre KasapoÄlu]

First days, tectonic lava graves
Emigrated mass of frame
While people were in a white fray

Cold ice was taming the massive clones
The balance for justice supposed
An archaeal substance of souls

The air, water and holy fire
Born within a mother soil
Is this the cypher of creation?

She brought fertility to the mankind
Curiosity and urge to find
Defines the human nature

They feed her and she overwhelms
She is the mother of persuasion
Black fire!
Her eyes condemned with the flame
This is the final extermination

Souls..dogmatic illusion
That they will unlock satanic vision
To rule them all
The black hole may be your god..

War..It finalized the picture I see
The seasons pass with conflicts of rage
Love..The affection of the power increased
The search for apeiron will fail
We failed!

They feed her and she overwhelms
She is the mother of persuasion
Black fire!
Her eyes condemned with the flame
This is the final extermination
