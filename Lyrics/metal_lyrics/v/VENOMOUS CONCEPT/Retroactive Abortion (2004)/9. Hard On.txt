What you would call
A matter of perception
Breaking your own laws
And guiding your collision
You bend your own rules
And buckle your knees
Struggle authority corrupted degree
You analyze corruption
And bring about destruction
Fucked decisions

Dummy rock dummy rules
Hand on cock guiding you
Dummy rock â Fuck you!!

What you would call
A matter of perception
Breaking your own laws
And guiding your collision
You bend your own rules
And buckle your knees
Struggle authority corrupted degree
You analyze corruption
And bring about destruction
Fucked decisions

Dummy rock dummy rules
Hand on cock guiding you
Dummy rock â Fuck you!!

Walk your walk and talk your talk
Bend your rules and break your laws
Think your smart and all of that
Beat your head with baseball bats
Fuck your rules or lack of that
I donât need your fists of cash
All your faults and all you see
Break the rules you push on me

Push on me

What you would call
A matter of perception
Breaking your own laws
And guiding your collision
You bend your own rules
And buckle your knees
Struggle authority corrupted degree
You analyze corruption
And bring about destruction
Fucked decisions

Dummy rock dummy rules
Hand on cock guiding you
Dummy rock â Fuck you!!
