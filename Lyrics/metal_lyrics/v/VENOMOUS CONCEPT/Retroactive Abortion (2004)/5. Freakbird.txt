Out of luck
Times are rough, I guess Iâm fucked
Thatâs no joke
Guess Iâll fight and thatâs no lie â Iâll fight
Rise above
Break my silence on your head
I donât know
I canât blow that smoke â Iâll choke
Feast or die
Chew the fat of life and smile
Time to fly
Spread your wings I choose to ride

Spread my wings
Spread my wings
Spread my wings
Spread my wings

Out of luck
Times are rough, I guess Iâm fucked
Thatâs no joke
Guess Iâll fight and thatâs no lie â Iâll fight
Rise above
Break my silence on your head
I donât know
I canât blow that smoke â Iâll choke
Feast or die
Chew the fat of life and smile
Time to fly
Spread your wings I choose to ride

Spread my wings
Spread my wings
Spread my wings
Spread my wings
