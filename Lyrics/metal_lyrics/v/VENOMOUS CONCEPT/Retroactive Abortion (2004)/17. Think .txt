[Japanese bonus track]

Well I can't for the life of me remember a time,
When the calm of oblivion had broken down my mind
Hit the floor

Better start rethinking?
Better start rethinking?

Well I can't for the life of me remember a time,
When the calm of oblivion had broken down my mind
Hit the floor

Better start rethinking?
Better start rethinking?

Better start rethinking?

Well I can't for the life of me remember a time,
When the calm of oblivion had broken down my mind
Hit the floor

Better start rethinking?
Better start rethinking?
