Take a look around at our decisions
Base your truth
On a false conviction
Break your neck and on true deceit
All this run around
Really brings me down

Run around town
With you sad clown frown
Bouncing around
With head down
Run around town
With you sad clown frown
All this run around
Really brings me downâ¦

Take a look around at our decisions
Base your truth
On a false conviction
Break your neck and on true deceit
All this run around
Really brings me down

Run around town
With you sad clown frown
Bouncing around
With head down
Run around town
With you sad clown frown
All this run around
Really brings me downâ¦
And down

All I wanted
Was for you to hit your knees
Drop and give me twenty
Like a true marine
Wartime people â its time to reign
