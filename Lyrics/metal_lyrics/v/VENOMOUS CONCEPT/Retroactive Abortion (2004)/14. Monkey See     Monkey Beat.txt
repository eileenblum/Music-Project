The monkey at work is all to hurt
So lap your life of luxury
See the balance of your thoughts
And reap the sum
Of all that could be me

The balance on your trapeze
Monkey see â Monkey beat

Rockinâ around from tree to tree
Looking for a life so carefree
King of you jungle â manâs domain
Root around to lifeâs brutal end

The balance on your trapeze
Balance lifeâs absurdity
Beat your chest with your hands and feet
Monkey see â Monkey beat

Beat on your chest
With hands and feet
Monkey see â Monkey beat
