Injustice in life
Corrupt in their strike
Coppers at play
Exploiting their ways

Nazi boy blue is breaking his rules
When he dances his dance
And heâs stomping on you
Picking his fights
With badges and guns
Kick in your face is their
Blood kickinâ fun
Bullies at play are having their way
And cops will be cops
At the end of the day

Drop and fight
Drop and fight
Drop and fight
Drop and fight
