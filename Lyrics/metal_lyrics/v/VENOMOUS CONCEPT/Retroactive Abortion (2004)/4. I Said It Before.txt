I said, I said, I said, I said
Iâd snap your neck 1, 2, 3
Feels damn good from what I see
About your thoughts
Youâre holding back
Maybe you should check your facts beforeâ¦
I said before, before
Before I come and settle the score

Check your little complex
Lost in ties â Time to fly
Yeah now itâs time
Yeah now itâs time to fly

I said, I said, I said, I said
I said I said Iâd snap your neck 1, 2, 3
Feels damn good from what I see
About your thoughts youâre holding back

Maybe you should check your facts
Before you drop your stories
Spit your germs corrupt my time

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!!!
