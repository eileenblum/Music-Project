Your vision deception
A business based on
Illusions of rock stars
Decisions, distorted
If you only had a clue
If only, you could
Find a way
To be your own little rock starâ¦
Then maybe, youâd see
How empty and shallow
Your life may seem

Frustrated, loser
You rob and steal
With a dumb point scheme
Look at yourself
See the sad picture
In your own backstage

Rolling around in the idiot parade
Rockinâ around
With your rock brigade
Wordâs at play â lies you lay
Start today and earn your pay

So you want to be a
Fuckinâ rock star â Rock on!

Fucking it up all you fake rock stars
Fucking it up all you fake rock stars
Fucking it up all you fake rock stars
Fucking it up all you fake rock stars
