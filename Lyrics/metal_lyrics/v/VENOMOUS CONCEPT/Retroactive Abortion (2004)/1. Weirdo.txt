All you are is what you want
And all you ever want is fear
All you are is something far from
What you thought was clear

If something you thought
Was something quite clear?
The thought of the cost
In our own time is something to fear
Which idol
To grip and to hold
You think itâs a wise choice until all
Of your bullshit unfolds

If all that you say
Is blood in my way â lifeâs blood
If all that you say
Is blood in my way â lifeâs blood
If all that you say
Is blood in my way â lifeâs blood
If all that you say
Is blood in my way â Youâll obey

All you are is what you want
And all you ever want is fear
All you are is something far from
What you thought was clear

If something you thought
Was something quite clear
The thought of the cost
In our own time is something to fear
Which idol
To grip and to hold
You think itâs a wise choice until all
Of your bullshit unfolds

If all that you say
Is blood in my way â lifeâs blood
If all that you say
Is blood in my way â lifeâs blood
If all that you say
Is blood in my way â lifeâs blood
If all that you say
Is blood in my way â obey!
