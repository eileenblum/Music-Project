Fall in line with the blind
All in time you cross the line
Feel so bland, feel so, so empty

Feeling so blank inside
Iâm feeling so blank inside
Feeling so blank inside
Iâm feeling soâ¦ so blank inside

Fall in line with the blind
All in time you cross the line
Feel so bland, feel so, so empty

Feeling so blank inside
Iâm feeling so blank inside
Feeling so blank inside
Iâm feeling soâ¦ so blank inside

For no reason an open season
on my last blurred vision, no reason
For no reason an open season
on my last blurred vision, no reason

Fall in line with the blind
All in time you cross the line
Feel so bland, feel so, so empty

Feeling so blank inside
Iâm feeling so blank inside
Feeling so blank inside
Iâm feeling soâ¦ so blank inside

For no reason an open season
on my last blurred vision, no reason
For no reason an open season
on my last blurred vision, no reason

Feeling so blank inside
Iâm feeling so blank inside
Feeling so blank inside
Iâm feeling soâ¦ so blank inside
