Can you see the picture? A love worth fighting for
To hold lifeâs true answer, breaking down our door
Break your spotty picture, cop the proper speak
pray for goals true answer, curse the wrong you beat
Can you see the picture?
Hells worth fighting for!
To hold lifeâs true answer, breaking down our door!

Live life lifeâs side
Live life lifeâs side
Live life lifeâs side
Live life lifeâs side

Think of life on that side watch your life go by
Think of life with no light! Itâs just nightmares

Live life lifeâs side
Live life lifeâs side
Live life lifeâs side
Live life lifeâs side

Itâs just nightmares
