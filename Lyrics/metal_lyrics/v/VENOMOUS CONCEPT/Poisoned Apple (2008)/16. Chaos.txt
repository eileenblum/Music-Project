Open your eyes to worldwide violence, copious shit talk, political bore
Idol rhetoric, violence licks its face with open sores

Politics aside, subject to it's menticide
Social genocide, blinding chaos' eye
Commander in thief, hail to our freak
Little man, big war
Pick a war worth fighting for

Pick a war worth fighting for

Every day it's the same shit
Fail at will, we fought them
The ideals of humanity
Crushed in vanity
Social parasite

Politics aside, subject to it's menticide
Social genocide, blinding chaos' eye
Commander in thief, hail to our freak
Little man, big war
Pick a war worth fighting for
