Feeding ourselves to the mouth of paranoia
Wrenching our hearts from the womb of rejection
All that we feel is awaiting the inevitable
Sedation (sedation) in repetition

Tears of fatigue (fatigue) bathing deception
Fixing the problems (problems) with insecure smiles
Pretending that nothingâ¦ is really the matter
Out from the darkness (darkness) our burning hearts are the guiding light

Painting our lies with a handshake
Mistakes forgotten but not forgiven
We build these walls instead of bridges
Sometimes our lives feel like a prison
A prison made of flesh and bone

Tears of fatigue (fatigue) bathing deception
Fixing the problems (problems) with insecure smiles
Pretending that nothingâ¦ is really the matter
Out from the darkness (darkness) our burning hearts are the guiding light

Is it just another case, another case of the Mondays [4x]
It's just another case of the Mondays

The human fortress is filled with shadows
Unified by the same disease
The human fortress is filled with shadows
Unified by the same disease

It's just another case of the Mondays (Mondays)
It's just another case of the Mondays 
It's just another case of the Mondays (Mondays)
It's just another case of the Mondays
