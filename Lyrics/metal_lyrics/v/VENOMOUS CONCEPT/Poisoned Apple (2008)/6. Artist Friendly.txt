Scent of the dragons breathe
Kiss of its touch
From a brotherâ¦kill now
Quest to conquer
Our corporate monsters
Fools reality â freed hypocrisy
Shackled no more
To my enslaved whore
What you think?
Think of me no more!

Pure freedom
The dragons are breathing
Iâll breathe air a freeman

Scent of the dragons breathe
Kiss of its touch
From a brotherâ¦kill now

Quest to conquer
Our corporate monsters
Fools reality â freed hypocrisy

Shackled no more
To my enslaved whore
What you think?
Think of me no more!

Pure freedom
The dragons are breathing
The sucking of leeches
Like vultures a feeding
Iâll breathe air a freeman
