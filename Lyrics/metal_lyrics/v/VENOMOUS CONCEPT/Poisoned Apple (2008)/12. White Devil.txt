Marching on our war torn streets
All hail our victories
Stomping heads below our feet
Our march to infamy
Cattle calls and breaking balls
Our art is brutal war
Fear us not, Hail Hitler not,
Letâs bring on war?

Weâll deal the impact
And chock the hopeful
Weâll breed its impact
And choke the hopeful

Marching on our war torn streets
All hail our victories
Stomping heads below our feet
Our march to infamy
Cattle calls and breaking balls
Our art is brutal war
Fear us not, Hail Hitler not,
Letâs bring on war?

Weâll deal the impact
And chock the hopeful
Weâll breed its impact
And choke the hopeful

March right through our
Blood soaked streets
Striking fear for all to see
Breaking backs hypocrisy
Our art of war is for free
