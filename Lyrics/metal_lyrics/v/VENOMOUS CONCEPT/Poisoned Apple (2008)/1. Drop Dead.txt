What was always meant to be
was not always hopes and dreams
Work, work, work, like a jerk
Broken back for some fool's shirt
Slave and drone, fucking moan
find yourself a total lone
Sell yourself to all you loath
Fuck that shit, I'm not alone

The bargain in life is having a life
shackled inside your lies
They're breaking your back
and cracking your mind

I'll drop dead
