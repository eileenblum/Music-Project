Talk and talk, talk your stupid shit
Shut your hole and blow your forty bit
The mindless crap that makes our days
Wish to Christ for life's better way

The act of living, such a comedic dream
The act of living, such a comedic dream

Talk and talk, talk your stupid shit
Shut your hole and blow your forty bit
The mindless crap that makes our days
Wish to Christ for life's better way

If I could care or not to fight
If life was black and white
Within the shades of gray
I've lost my right to say

The act of living, such a comedic dream
The act of living, such a comedic dream

Talk and talk, talk your stupid shit
Shut your hole and blow your forty bit
The mindless crap that makes our days
Wish to Christ for life's better way

If I could care or not to fight
If life was black and white
Within the shades of gray
I've lost my right to say
I said no way

If I could care or not to fight
If life was black and white
Within the shades of gray
I've lost my right to say

The act of living, such a comedic dream
The act of living, such a comedic dream
