I picture my world in dark contradictions
Values misplaced through wrong decisions
Failed my task in humanity
Failed once more in humility

My life's decisions, in life I swell
My confusion, when I dwell

I picture my world in dark contradictions
Values misplaced through wrong decisions
Failed my task in humanity
Failed once more in humility

My life's decisions, in life I swell
My confusion, when I dwell

Beat and broken, hanging on myself
Broken thoughts and fractured signs
All my bullshit, my bullshit unwinds

Beat and broken, hanging on myself
Broken thoughts and fractured signs
All my bullshit, all my bullshit unwinds
