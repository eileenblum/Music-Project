Clocking smiles with playful crap
Tip my jar, go fuck yourself
Selling life to myself
What a bore, I'll check right out
Walk that walk, talk and talk
Kiss my touch I'm breaking off
Checking out with a grin
Crush the thoughts that break right in

Taste your taste that blots your mind
Run the circles hand to hand
Taste your taste that blots your mind
Blot the thoughts that cut your mind

Clocking smiles with playful crap
Tip my jar, go fuck yourself
Selling life to myself
What a bore, I'll check right out
Walk that walk, talk and talk
Kiss my touch I'm breaking off
Checking out with a grin
Crush the thoughts that break right in

Look inside your blank mind
Look for what was left in me
It's a lost cause, lost time
I know, I think you'll find

I know, I know, I knowâ¦

Look inside your blank mind
