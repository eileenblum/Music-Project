[Bonus Track From The Transmedia Project peer-returns.com][feat. Helen Vogt (Flowing Tears)]There's a land I'll take you to,
A land where imagination rules

Take you away from here
Where angels fear to tread
Where wrong is right instead
Don't care what they say

A blazing starlight ahead
We are floating away
What they don't have is what we'll get -
A Land of Imagination

Do you remember us, remember us at all -
Remember us at all...?
Where do you remember us, remember us at all -
Remember me at all...?

Winds of the world unite in grief
Black and heavy rain
Ordered to this very place in time
Sweep the withered leafs

A storm to come
The storm is near
Join in or hide in fear
RakkaTakka RakkaTa

Mercy be with us and peace within,
Granted by the one who is and who was
And who eternally will be,
Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Amen

Winds of the world unite in grief
Black and heavy rain
Ordered to this very place in time
Sweep the withered leafs

A storm to come
The storm is near
Join in or hide in fear
RakkaTakka RakkaTa

Lord, grant us your unquestioning mercy
Lord, look upon us with your eternal grace
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of Death,
I will fear no evil for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

And it is written by the Prophet Jesaja:
Behold, I will send a messenger, John,
To prepare the way of the Lord.

We come from dust,
We return to dust.
John Gynt, rest in peace

In Nomine Patre et Filii
Et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.

Staring into this deep black pit
In his hand a pile of dust
Not understanding it
One loving look, the last

My father was a gambler
And we were his final bet
Once he put his cards on the table
Our destiny was met

Father whereâre you going now
Why did you gamble our luck away
No love for us, for me
Too easy to betray?

Soon he will go his own way
Deal the cards of his own play
Father, thank you for Nothing!
John Gynt rest in peace!

Winds of the world unite in grief
Black and heavy rain
Ordered to this very place in time

A storm to come
The storm is near
Come along or run in fear
RakkaTakka RakkaTa

Please mother whatâs going on
Theyâre supposed to be our friends
Why donât they help us
Instead they kick us out

Justice rules from above
No money no love
It is as simple as that
Just do not look back

Building a fortress around my heart
With friends of my own creation
Never will betrayal form part
In my demon nation

Everything I will endure
Suffer without lamentation
Humility will be my cure
I will not plead
I will not question

For my son
Just for him
From now on every year
Eternal winters long

Like a word
Like a breeze
Like a song

Mother? Mother!

Winds of the world rejoice
Black and heavy rain
Ordered to this very place in time

A storm to come
The storm is here
Come along or run in fear

The elementary force
Ruthless, unafraid
We are the rulers of the world

A storm to come
The storm is here
Come along or run in fear

So I spread my wings out wide
Over mountainâs ridge the storm I ride
Dragons, demons, faithful friends
Know them at my side

Thus I make the world my subject
Ruthless, unafraid
And I play for my own sake
The very game which I create

I know you and your games
Yet I accept but rules to my aims

And so I spread my wings out wide
Over mountainâs ridge the storm I ride
Dragons, demons, faithful friends
Know and trust them at my side
I subject the world to my rule
Ruthless and unafraid
And I play for my own sake
The very game which I create

I know you, I know your games
I accept but rules to my aims

This is how I make the world my claim
