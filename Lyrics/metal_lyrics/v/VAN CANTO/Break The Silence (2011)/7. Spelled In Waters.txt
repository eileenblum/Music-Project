[feat. Marcus Siepen (Blind Guardian)]Phrases laughing right in your face.
Writing depth into this shallowness.
Carving a name just to leave a trace.
A body resounding with hollowness.

Meaning, please come onto me.
Explain these deeds of vanity.

[Refrain:]
With every failure and every falter
May my name be spelled in waters.
[Repeat]

So many words, but nothing to say.
Still I'm waiting for a sense to come.
I am silent. Words took my voice away.
Tamed and harmless I am. All alone.

This empty page best remains forsaken, describing roads already taken.

[Refrain]

Echoing what was heart before, irrelevance immortalized.
Please try to remember me.
"Someone who has always tried."
But uttered words do not live long.
Silence will engulf this song.

[Refrain (2x)]
