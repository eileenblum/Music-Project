[Bonus Track][Annelia]
Shades of gray they beloud my emotion.
Sad and weak I will stay here inside these walls.

Move on to new Horizons.
This ain't enough for me.
I am the good king's daughter.
So I know there is more to see.

[Sismond]
Am I God. I don't know but I'm trying.
Won't mislead them show them the proper way.

I'll bring them new horizons
And seasons to my will.
We all can live forever
And my previsions are fulfilled.

[Refrain:]
She was born with royal blood,
And vengeance in her hands.
She was born to rule but destiny had other plans.
And then she was on the brink of death,
When something grew inside.
Whispering words of a new heart promised a better life.
We've all been betrayed.

[Annelia &amp; Sismond]
So few moments of this fading happiness.
Not enough to lessen my suffering.

We fly to new horizons.
They will do as we tell.
We are higher creatures.
We can turn heaven into hell.

[Annelia]
[Refrain:]
I was born with royal blood, and vengeance in my hands.
I was born to rule but destiny had other plans.
And then I was on the brink of death,
When something grew inside.
Whispering words of a new heart promised a better life.
So my heart beats twice for sadness deep inside.
Darkness falls and comes to light.
Written fate then will open a gate
To find a better life.

[Refrain]
