On my own.
The ghost of a stone.
Time is passing by.
Still untrodden my land lies.

"We got to move ahead."
This is what they said.
What they always told.
No secret left unfold.

On and on, still no wind blows.
No wind blows tonight.
I move on.
As I want to stay deep inside.

[Refrain:]
Dangers in my head are rising.
From a darker land.
Denying what has been before.
Forever dangers rising high.
In my head.
Dangers in my head are rising,
Trying to amend the lies I'm in.
What has been before.
Forever dangers in my head are rising high.

Clouds roll by.
The black of night
Veils my certainty
Of what is left to see.
It begins in delight
But it might end in wisdom.
Clouds move aside.
This storm will raise a kingdom.
Agony
Inhaled by black tornadoes.
There's something left for me.

[Refrain (2x)]
