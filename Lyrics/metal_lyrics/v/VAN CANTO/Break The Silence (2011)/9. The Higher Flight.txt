I am a fortune teller.
I have the second sight.
But I'm standing here alone.
As with every fortune
That I foresee
The anxiety grows.

I've got nothing to tell you.
Trueness is betrayal.
I'll keep the lore for me
And waste your sanity.
To break the silence
Is a deadly sin.
The truth remains buried within.

[Refrain:]
I will end this night
On a higher flight.
I'll bring a light into what lies in the dark.
I'm flying for all time.
I will never die.
On this higher flight I lighting your heart.

Evolution. Cut off the world.
Revolution. Tamed and disturbed.
Endless yearning. Waiting for me?
A Hero returning. Making them see.

I've got something to tell you
'Though trueness is betrayal.
Take the lore from me
And heal your sanity.
We break the silence
With voices no-one can ignore.
We're heading for more.
A fortune teller will light up
The truth that's been buried within.

[Refrain (2x)]

We fly to a brand new start.

To all liars who're trying to keep voices calm:
You will not succeed in not making things better.
To all believers still wandering on:
Keep track. Stay close. Your time will come.

All that I have ever believed -
Nothing but the start of something
I will not remember. Not at all.

[Refrain (2x)]

We fly to a brand new start.
