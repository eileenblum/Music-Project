Water is waving
Oceans are calling
Fire is burning
Heat deep inside
Heaven can wait for me as I'm grounded
Here on earth eternally

Water is waving
Oceans are calling
Fire is burning
Heat deep inside
Heaven can wait for me as I'm grounded
Here on earth

Do I really see what I see
Or is it only true in my mind?
Did I really open my eyes
Or is it still that I look inside?

For one moment I knew eternity
What I felt was so peaceful and calm
But still I am here thanks to gravity
And so I keep wandering on

Water is waving
Oceans are calling
Fire is burning
Heat deep inside
Heaven can wait for me as I'm grounded
Here on earth

Is there anyone to pretend
That there is nothing to come
Is this my beginning or end?
Will I know where I belong?

For one moment I knew eternity
What I felt was so peaceful and calm
But still I am here thanks to gravity
And so I keep wandering on

Water is waving
Oceans are calling
Fire is burning
Heat deep inside
Heaven can wait for me as I'm grounded
Here on earth eternally

Water is waving
Oceans are calling
Fire is burning
Heat deep inside
Heaven can wait for me as I'm grounded
Here on earth

Heaven can wait for me!

Water is waving
Oceans are calling
Fire is burning
Heat deep inside
Heaven can wait for me as I'm grounded
Here on earth eternally

Water is waving
Oceans are calling
Fire is burning
Heat deep inside
Heaven can wait for me as I'm grounded
Here on earth eternally

Heaven can wait for me!
