Emptiness is where I'm from
To nothingness the past has gone
No matter what to bear I'm roaming on
Face the wind, let fires burn
Let coldness reign, I will not gurn
My arrival is my last return

[Chorus:]
The tribe of force
Is setting up again
Enemies retreating
The honest tribe defeating
The tribe of force
Is ready to amend
Don't yield and surrender
The tribe of force will stand

Again I'm lost and what remains?
All my attempts, were they in vain?
I try to seed belief
And so I hold my head up high
I always give it one more try
The force within

[Chorus 2x]

The tribe of force
Is setting up again
The tribe of force
Is ready to amend
Don't yield and surrender
The tribe of force will stand

[Chorus 2x]
