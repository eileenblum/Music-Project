I've got my will, I've got my heart
Even though I can't tell her right now
I could not stand if I failed
I could not stand if I lost her somehow
I found the book of silence
So keen what it would show
I read the book of silence
How was I supposed to know
My voice would fall asleep and
Rest until this curse is banned and gone

[Chorus:]
You hear my call
Wide and tall
Yes, i can be heard
My Voice is strong
Builds a wall
Around every single Word
I'm hunting high
Hunting low
I am everywhere
My voice is there
Fills the air
My voice can be heard

I try to open my mind
He doesn't talk, still I'm blind
I try to free all the meanings unknown
I want her to look inside
I cannot see in darkest nights
Until my soul's freed and secrets unfold
I found the book of silence
So keen what it would show
I read the book of silence
How was I supposed to know
My voice would fall asleep and
Never wake again
To surrender is not
What I learned
I'll fight 'gainst this curse 'til it's gone

You hear my call
Wide an tall
Yes, I can be heard
My voice is strong
Builds a wall around
Every single word
IÂ´m hunting high
Hunting low
I am everywhere
My voice is there
Fills the air
My voice can be heard

I'm riding
Still I'm flying
Everywhere that I can be
I'm trying, believing
My voice will speak again for me

I don't want to speak
I don't want to talk
On every other day
There are million miles to walk
I've got nothing to tell
I've got nothing to say
Alone I fade away

You hear my call
Wide an tall
Yes, I can be heard
My voice is strong
Builds a wall around
Every single word
IÂ´m hunting high
Hunting low
I am everywhere
My voice is there
Fills the air
My voice can be heard

Yes, I will be heard
My voice is there
Fills the air
My voice can be heard

IÂ´m riding
Still IÂ´m flying
Everywhere that I can be
IÂ´m trying, believing
My voice will speak again for me
