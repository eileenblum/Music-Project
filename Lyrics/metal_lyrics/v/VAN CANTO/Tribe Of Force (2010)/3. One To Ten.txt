[feat. Victor Smolski of Rage]

Hush

Do not say a word
Might be we are trapped
Cause they want us to stay
Wait for nights to come
Wait for shining stars above
To light our way
Into better days
Now
That we feel as one
They won't keep us down
We were born to fly
Once that we are gone
They will speak of us
As those who always tried
To win an endless fight

Once we have been told a secret
Too risky to know
Three years we tried to keep silent
For to save our homes
Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Go!

All that we have feared so much
Is gone!
One for all and all for one
Side by side
We're brave and strong
All the doubts that teased us once
Are gone!
Hundreds, thousands
More to come!
Fight to let our kingdom come

No!
We will never stop
We will never fail
We're the ones to proceed
Step by step we march
Day by day we're waking up
With braver hearts
We are fighting hard

Once we have been told a secret
Too risky to know
Three years we tried to keep silent
For to save our homes
Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Go!

All that we have feared so much
Is gone!
One for all and all for one
Side by side
We're brave and strong
All the doubts that teased us once
Are gone!
Hundreds, thousands
More to come!
Fight to let our kingdom come

Once we have been told a secret
Too risky to know
Three years we tried to keep silent
For to save our homes
Are we already in Heaven?
No!
Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Go!

All that we have feared so much
Is gone!
One for all and all for one
Side by side
We're brave and strong
All the doubts that teased us once
Are gone!
Hundreds, thousands
More to come!
Fight to let our kingdom come

All our fears are gone!
This is not our end yet
No!
Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten
Go!
