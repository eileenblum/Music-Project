Torn between the world
I divine the meaning
Thought I fought with my fair-minded heart
I am weak and torn apart
I feel the magic running through my veins
A prophecy is fulfilled these days

[Chorus:]
In Taborea
I follow my heart just to find a new hero
Nothing I want more
Than to be where I belong

Homeless I have been
Still you know where you are from
As I stopped wondering
I finally stood my ground
The world is gathering
The light is ready to shine on
I will shine on
The prophecy is fulfilled today

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2x]

To be where I belong
To be where I belong
