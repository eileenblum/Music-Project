[Chorus:]
The awakening of a morning dawn.
Opens up the gate for times to come,
To aims and beyond.
The awakening of a new aeon
Will tell us the missions to be done.
An icy gloria.
Awake is what we are,
Awake and aware. [3x]

In this brotherhood of life
We are the unforsaken.
For years and years we had been lost.
Today will finally be our time.
They build the walls, we break 'em.
Recall: to leave is to arrive.

[Bridge:]
On our way, there's a land under our feet.
And I know that you will always keep your eyes on me.

[Chorus:]
The awakening of a morning dawn.
Opens up the gate for times to come,
To aims and beyond.
The awakening of a new aeon
Will tell us the missions to be done.
An icy gloria.

No rain to wash away our sins.
We felt so forced and driven.
We have been homeless, so we'll be.
But there is still much life within.
We are the unforgiven.
We will be more than what we've been.

[Bridge:]
On our way, there's a land under our feet.
And I know that you will always keep your eyes on me.

[Chorus:]
The awakening of a morning dawn.
Opens up the gate for times to come,
To aims and beyond.
The awakening of a new aeon
Will tell us the missions to be done.
An icy gloria.
Awake is what we are.
Awake and aware. [3x]

Countless nights, I'm still awake.
For an endless sleep I wait.
In a minute I'll be gone, awaiting dawn.
Countless nights, I'm still awake.
For an endless sleep I wait.
In a minute, I'll be gone, and I am awaiting dawn.

Times I am doubting. Times I feel weak.
Times and times I'm struggling to believe
It gets better. Every day
We keep track and we'll follow this way.

[Chorus:]
The awakening of a morning dawn.
Opens up the gate for times to come,
To aims and beyond.
The awakening of a new aeon
Will tell us the missions to be done.
An icy gloria.
Awake is what we are.
Awake and aware. [3x]

We're awake and we'll be there.
