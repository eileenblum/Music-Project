We were called tonight by grey gulls once again.
From most far, coldest north they came.
We will join this ride, there and back again.
Into the dark through wind and rain.

It has been way more than many years ago:
Last time we fought side by side.
It will be a triumphal reunion
When the two of us unite.

[Bridge:]
Our fear yields excitement.
We are one million mates,
So I will surely stand my ground tonight.

[Chorus:]
To the mountains and beyond.
Through oceans and skies
And then to the other side.
Off to the mountains and beyond.
Through woods in blackened nights.
Off to the mountains we will ride.

Gathering.
Tonight we will forgive our sins.
We rove, we wander, and we roam.
Don't hurt our pride.
No, you should better step aside
As we are surely marching on.

[Bridge:]
Our fear yields excitement.
We are one million mates,
So I will surely stand my ground tonight.

[Chorus:]
To the mountains and beyond.
Through oceans and skies
And then to the other side.
Off to the mountains and beyond.
Through woods in blackened nights.
Off to the mountains we will ride.

To the mountains side.
Then to the other side.
Off to the mountains side.
Then to the other side.

[Solo]

[Bridge:]
Our fear yields excitement.
We are one million mates,
So I will surely stand my ground tonight.

And if I'd be falling
I'd surely hear a calling
To meet my gods on the other side.

[Chorus (2x):]
To the mountains and beyond.
Through oceans and skies
And then to the other side.
Off to the mountains and beyond.
Through woods in blackened nights.
Off to the mountains we will ride.
