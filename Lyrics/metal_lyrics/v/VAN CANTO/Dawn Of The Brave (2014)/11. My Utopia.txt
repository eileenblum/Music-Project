I feel the greater sense
just by the kind of mood I'm in.
Something touched my core
and everything within.

That kind of certitude
is attaching wisdom to my mind
that everything that was
effects a future life.

[Bridge:]
On and on to other lands.
My beliefs are my command.
Like a universe, like space that never ends
my utopia expands.

[Chorus:]
If I die,
if I'm at the end of all skies
I try to review
my utopia.
If I'm gone
comets I am riding on
they're leading me to
my utopia.

Doubts are closing in,
rewinding written scripts of time.
I'm a turning point,
at a key scene of my life.

Is this a dÃ©jÃ -vu?
Is it something I've been through?
Am I the only one
whose last will will be done?

Fly to the morning skies
with armies of the true believers.
Try, try another time
by breathing hope.
Ride through the waste of time.
Be yourself a pain reliever.
Fight. Multiply the light
and space will grow.

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[2x]
Now that we're flying through eons of time at speed of light.
Now that we're flying through eons of time at speed of light.
Out of the big bang straight into the dark, into the night.
Out of the big bang straight into the dark, into the night.

Fly to the morning skies
with armies of the true believers.
Try, try another time
by breathing hope.
Ride through the waste of time.
Be yourself a pain reliever.
Fight. Multiply the light
and space will grow.

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

If I die,
if I'm at the end of all skies
I try to review
my Utopia.

If I'm gone
comets I am riding on
They're leading me to
my Utopia.
