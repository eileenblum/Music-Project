The whole world against you? (Fight)
Bad things you've been through? (Fight)
Ignore disbelievers, the so-called achievers.
You are just doing it right.

You're facing haters? (Fight)
Marooned by traitors? (Fight)
Every morning, instead of mourning
Wake up and stand up to fight.

And by time this elegy
Is healing wounds, and blinded eyes will see.
Lost in eternity, banned for all times?
Fight for your life.

[Refrain]
Are you bound in darkness?
Is it that you miss the light?
Fight for your life.
Imagine getting stronger
Instead of feeling weak inside.
Fight for your life.

Betrayed by liars? (fight)
You're trapped by fires? (fight)
Just feel empowered,
Every hour,
Knowing you're just doing right.

And by time this threnody
Is giving life for those who dare to feel.
Creating reality from the inside.
Fight for your life.

Are you bound in darkness?
Is it that you miss the light?
Fight for your life.
Imagine getting stronger
Instead of feeling weak inside.
Fight for your life.

Wipe off all misgivings,
Knowing you have always tried.
Fight for your life.
Nevermind convictors.
Let your inner hero rise.
Fight for your life.

Fill your soul with pride,
Reminding you to fight for your life.

And by time this symphony
Is getting real, surviving endlessly.
You're writing history line by line.
Fight for your life.
Fight for your life.

Are you bound in darkness?
Is it that you miss the light?
Fight for your life.
Imagine getting stronger
Instead of feeling weak inside.
Fight for your life.

Oooh,
Knowing you have always tried.
Fight for your life.
Nevermind convictors.
Let your inner hero rise.
Fight for your life.

We are at your side
Day by day, and night by night.
Fill your soul with pride
Reminding you to fight for your life.

Fight!
