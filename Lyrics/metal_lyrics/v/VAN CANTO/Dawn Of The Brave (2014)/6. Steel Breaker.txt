I am on a hunt tonight.
Cool and anticipating.
Looking out if someone's there for me.
A trip to my real wild side.
Another endless ride
From here to everything I'll ever be.

[Bridge:]
I already shoot as you still load.
Dead on target, ready to explode.

[Chorus:]
I pull the trigger,
I'm the steel breaker.
Out of my way.
Steel breaker.
Night into day.
Steel breaker.
Listen to what I say.
Another night,
I am the steel breaker.
On the run
Steel breaker.
Now let it come.
Steel breaker.
Shut up, bring it on.

Another night became my friend.
Wild and alive I am.
Hungry for some more, don't let it end.
My reputation preceding me
And while staring back at me
I overtake at supersonic speed.

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
I pull the trigger,
I'm the steel breaker.
Out of my way.
Steel breaker.
Night into day.
Steel breaker.
Listen to what I say.
Another night,
I am the steel breaker.
On the run
Steel breaker.
Yeah, let it come.
Steel breaker.
Shut up, bring it on.

They are backbiting me.
2 out of 7 is what they have for me.
Still they didn't write a single song,
(not a single one)
Voices all around.
I love to hear the crowd.
40.000, 50.000, one for all.
(all for one)

Tales are told,
Worlds unfold.
He's back in town with balls of seven tons.
He is the steel breaker.

[Chorus:]
Steel Breaker.
Out of my way.
Steel Breaker.
Night into day.
Steel Breaker.
Listen to what I say.
Another night,
I am the Steel Breaker.
On the run
Steel Breaker.
Let it come.
Steel Breaker.
Shut up, bring it on.

I pull the trigger,
I am the Steel Breaker. [3x]
Listen to what I say.

Another night,
I am the Steel Breaker.
On the run
Steel Breaker.
Now let it come.
Steel Breaker.
Shut up, bring it on.

I am the Steel Breaker.
