Look at her (look at him)
A loud mouthed wench (a broken man)
A little Miss Know-it-all (standing tall)
I can't believe (I believe)
We have joined (this won't last long)
Mission is huge, chances small (if at all)

My fate (my life) is turning
The skies (inside) are burning (I'm burning)
Unearthly night

Join the journey we are heading for
Join our ride we'll come back for more

Look at her (look at him)
Queen of hearts? (a warrior brave?)
Freed from ancestor's halls? (heeds the call)
Still handsome (still a man)
A heroine (leading them)
Leading this mission for all (one for all)

And still I'm learning (I started learning)
For peace I'm yearning (for what I'm yearning)
We're doing right

Join the journey we are heading for
Join our ride we'll come back for more
Join our journey, life's an open door
Join our ride, we'll be back for more

Firevows we swore
Firevows we swore
Firevows we swore

Hard times for journeys to the dark side
Something I can't deny
If I ever fall, will you be there?
To flames I'm swearing
The burden I am bearing will still remain

Join the journey we are heading for
Join our ride, come back for more
Join our journey, life's an open door
Join our ride, we'll be back for more

Firevows we swore
