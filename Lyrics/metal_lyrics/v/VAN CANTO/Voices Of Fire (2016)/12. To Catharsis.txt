To catharsis
To reincarnate is a new beginning to come
We will start this new view of our fate
Yet another aeon's begun
Rise of another sun

(fight, fight, fight !)

When there's nowhere left to go, no place to call your home
A nomad's life, like vagabonds we'll roam
Longing to arrive, for a new homeland we strive
Although we know the one we had was right

Righteous judgement on our deeds, yet another night

To catharsis
To reincarnate is a new beginning to come
We will start this new view of our fate
Yet another aeon's begun
Rise of another sun

We did not pray for this life killing abyss
On our way to peace and endless bliss
When dragons re-awake first weaker souls they take
Let strength be on our side for heaven's sake

When there's nowhere left to go
Stay close to someone that you know
Let trust and formness grow, finding you are not alone

Righteous judgement on our deeds in this final fight

To catharsis
To reincarnate is a new beginning to come
We will start this new view of our fate
Yet another aeon's begun

To catharsis
To reincarnate is a new beginning to come
Rise of another sun

(fight, fight, fight !)

Righteous judgement on our deeds into glory ride

To catharsis
To reincarnate is a new beginning to come
We will start this new view of our fate
Yet another aeon's begun

To catharsis
To reincarnate is a new beginning to come
We will start this new view of our fate
Yet another aeon's begun
Rise of another sun

To catharsis
To reincarnate is a new beginning to come
We will start this new view of our fate
Yet another aeon's begun
Rise of another sun
