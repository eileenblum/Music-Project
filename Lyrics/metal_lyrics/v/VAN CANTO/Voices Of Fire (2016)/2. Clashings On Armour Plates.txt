From Creation over Damnation
To another page of the tale
Our battle cries presaging the story
Of clashings on armour plates

Of myths and twists
Of fields in mist
Of creatures flying high
Of lands (to find)
Of seas (so wide)

A mystery by night
And part of a firefly
Facing fortune once again
Voices feeding flames

From Perdition over Salvation
To another side of fate
Our gathered swords are breaking the silence
Clashing on armour plates

Four good,one bad
Not back for good
How to find a way through darkest nights

A voice (still faint)
Speaks names (to the sky)
And getting flames to rise
We're all a part of this firefly

Read the hero's dream
Lights of dawn will gleam
Once our voices unify
For flames they'll scream

From Perdition over Salvation
To another side of fate
Our gathered swords are breaking the silence
Clashing on armour plates

From Creation over Damnation
To another page of the tale
Our battle cries presaging the story
Of clashings on armour plates

Clashing on armour plates
Hoping it's not too late
After all we know
That way leads onto way

Clashing on armour plates
Hoping it's not too late
After all we know
That way leads onto way

Clashing on armour plates
Hoping it's not too late
After all we know
That way leads onto way

Clashing on armour plates
Hoping it's not too late
After all we know
That way leads onto way
