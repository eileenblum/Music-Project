Perceiving an unknown breeze, stairs in caves beyond the waterfalls
Deceiving ease, can't delay the moment duty calls
My fleeting peace is drawing back as shadows fall
Will they remember us after all?

We are doubting all we know, irritating feelings grow
Dragged into the depth by an undertow down below
Never facing who we are, disregarding every scar
That has once been caused by innocence
Betrayal of us all!

He has been granting insight, trust is growing
Wait! What is going on? Hands on the one!
(help me!) what has he done?
(release me!) his voice is gone!
(relieve me!) can't be undone!
I wonder why, wonder why!

We are doubting all we know, irritating feelings grow
Dragged into the depth by an undertow down below
Never facing who we are, disregarding every scar
That has once been caused by innocence
(betrayal of us all! )

Everything that was meant is rescinded now, everyone is awaiting a bard
Everywhere we will roam now is lost somehow, drowned in silence, torn apart

(treachery
Betrayal of a friend
Deceive your brother
Agony, tragedy, shadows descend into another
Treachery
Betrayal of a friend
Deceive your brother
Agony, tragedy, shadows descend into another)

He is the love of my life, why is it too late that I have realized
Oh yes I wonder why, wonder why

We are doubting all we know, irritating feelings grow
Dragged into the depth by an undertow
Never facing who we are, disregarding every scar
That has once been caused by innocence
(betrayal of us all!)

We are doubting all we know, irritating feelings grow
Dragged into the depth by an undertow down below
Never facing who we are, disregarding every scar
That has once been caused by innocence
Betrayal of us all!

(covering the light and then hiding the moon)
