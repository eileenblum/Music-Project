Face it your highs turning to dust now
Don't you think it's time to find another path in life?
Because you, my friend, just waste your time here
Day by day, and night by night
When will you accept what might have been will not arise?

So what! (Don't mind) another round!
For all our friends and all the others
We shine so bright in our old stories
(Time and time again)

So what! (Don't mind) another round!
Heroic deeds. My house of glory
Look! This harlot is sweetening my night
(Time and time again)

Where is your faith? It's going under!
Pick up yourself and put your goddamned face back into light
Back to old strength, a fight for courage
What's past is past, our future is a chance
When we accept what might have been will not arise.

What the hell do they know?
Judge a bard's life? No, no, no!
Another pint, another song
Time and time again this night will not last long

So what! (Don't mind) another round!
For all our friends and all the others
We shine so bright in our old stories
(Time and time again)

So what! (Don't mind) another round!
Heroic deeds. My house of glory
Look! This harlot is sweetening my night
(Time and time again)

Fighting inner demons
Contending against someone I know
Fighting inner demons
Where was the call? I had nowhere to go
Fighting inner demons
I just felt my eagerness grow
Fighting inner demons
Time and time and time again

Fighting inner demons
So many killed, their dead faces they show
Fighting inner demons
The smell of perdition. Cadaver winds blow
Fighting inner demons
This story is over, so leave me alone
Fighting inner demons
Time and time again.
Time and time again.
Time and time again.

What the hell do they know?
Judge a bard's life? No, no, no!
Another pint, another song
Time and time again this night will not last long

So what! Another round!
Tonight we get knocked out

So what! (Don't mind) another round!
For all our friends and all the others
We shine so bright in our old stories
(Time and time again)

So what! (Don't mind) another round!
Heroic deeds. My house of glory
Look! This harlot is sweetening my night
(Time and time again)
