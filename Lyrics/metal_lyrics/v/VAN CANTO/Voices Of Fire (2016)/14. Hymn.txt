[Bonus Track]From the waters and across blue seas
From the west into eternity
From the waters far beyond
It was once told we'll be back again
It's the west winds that will spell our name
And as one or four we shall remain

From the fires and into the flames
From the south into a land we tamed
From the fires far beyond
It was once told we'll be back again
It's the south winds that announce our name
And as one or four we shall remain

From the heavens and through stormy skies
From the east and over mountains high
From the heavens far beyond
It was once told we'll be back again
It's the east winds that will tell our name
And as one or four we shall remain

From the earth and over valleys green
From the north into a land so free
From the earth so far beyond
It was once told we'll be back again
It's the north winds that will call our name
And as one or four we shall remain

Forever we shall remain
