[Choir:]
Once for all!
Hear your call!
Dragonfall!
Create an army, unite in harmony.

No escape!
Face your fate!
Save the eight!
Fulfill your purpose, your voice is precious.

Rise up and fight your misery.
Step right into your destiny.
Defend our holy legacy.
Create an army, unite in harmony.

Rise up and face your enemy.
Invoke the bard's integrity.
Unite your skills for victory.
Fulfill your purpose, your voice is precious!

[Voice:]
We come in peace to seek your advice.
Too blind to see we beg for your eyes.
Is there a hidden prophecy
To figure out this mystery?
Is there a little chance to survive this war?

(a war)
Out of my mind,
Left far behind.

[Choir:]
The dragon is rising,
The islands colliding.
The savior in hiding,
The empress not guiding.
Ash to ash â dust to dust,
Our star will combust.
Not to fail is a must.
Raise your voice to be free,
Harmony is the key!

[Voice:]
I need a little faith in my voice (don't rail against your fate, young bard!)
I cannot seem to have any choice (defeat the coward you have empowered!)
I want to hide behind armour plates (you can't escape â accept your lot!)
My inner voice is conquered by hate (rise like a phoenix, out of the ashes!)

[Choir:]
Fight with a mighty heart,
And we will sing aloud of dragons we fight.

[Voice:]
This line of fate decides on my heart (don't lose heart!)
I'm cut into pieces, like the islands
I am drifting apart.
No gallantry inside my soul (call the bards!)
All valour vanished in my memory,
And a long long way from home.

Out of my mind,
Left far behind.

Don't you fear your tryst with destiny.
Put your faith in your own melody!
I will join up into harmony.

[Choir:]
Raise you voice to be free,
Harmony is the key!
The dragon is rising,
The islands colliding.
The savior in hiding,
The empress not guiding.
Ash to ash â dust to dust,
Our star will combust.
Not to fail is a must.
Raise your voice â built on trust!

[Voice:]
I need a little faith in my voice (don't rail against your fate, young bard!)
I cannot seem to have any choice (defeat the coward you have empowered!)
I want to hide behind armour plates (you can't escape â accept your lot!)
My inner voice is conquered by hate (rise like a phoenix, out of the ashes!)

[Choir:]
Rise up and face your enemy.
Invoke the bard's integrity.
Unite your skills for victory.
Fulfill your purpose, your voice is precious!

[Solo]

Fight with a mighty heart, and you will
Raise your voice to be free,
Harmony is the key!

[Voice:]
I need a little faith in my voice (don't rail against your fate, young bard!)
I cannot seem to have any choice (defeat the coward you have empowered!)
I want to hide behind armour plates (you can't escape â accept your lot!)
My inner voice is conquered by hate (rise like a phoenix, out of the ashes!)

[Choir:]
Fight with a mighty heart
And you will find your own path.
Look upon the start
Shining in the dark,
And we will sing aloud of dragons we fight. [4x]

[Voices:]
Fighting my heart,
Losing my path.
A star in the dark
For thee.
I learn to fight!
Fighting my heart,
Losing my path.
A star in the dark
For thee.
