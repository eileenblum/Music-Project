I'm a man who used to live in hiding,
Fear can't seize my heart anymore
I'm a bard, can feel my spirits rising
Nothing's like before

Our fate has come to light (our love's delight)
Light will lead us through the night
Tonight I'll shine for you (you will shine when I...)
I wish you will sing (...will sing for you)

I can't shine without your voice (can't be without you too long)
You've been with me all along
I will sing for you and me (oh, sing â you and me, we do belong)
(we are one) together we're one

You make me a better man, believe in who I am
My heart beats at your command, I put it in your hands
Let's turn this into our song, I never felt that strong
Our love is a mighty one, let's go on a dragon hunt!

Our fate has come to light (let's seal our fate tonight!)
Seals can be break in two (our love will see us through)
Tonight I'll shine for you (you will shine when I...)
I wish you will sing (...will sing for you)

I can't shine without your voice (can't be without you...)
You've been with me all along (...too long)
I will sing for you and me (oh sing â you and me, we do belong)
(we are one) together we're one

Sweet wings of love take me up to stars above
His voice in sooth makes me shine a thousand lights

You make me a better man, believe in who I am
My heart beats at your command, I put it in your hands
Let's turn this into our song, I never felt that strong
Our love is a mighty one, let's go on a dragon hunt!

I can't shine without your voice (can't be without you...)
You've been with me all along (...too long)
I will sing for you and me (oh sing â you and me, we do belong)
(we are one) together we're one

I can't shine without your voice (can't be without you...)
You've been with me all along (...too long)
I will sing for you and me (oh sing â you and me, we do belong)
(we are one) together we're one
I will sing for you and me (oh sing â you and me, we do belong)
(we are one) together we're one
