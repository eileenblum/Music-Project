All my life put in jeopardy, in a heartbeat
I'm lost and lone ...

Falling
When magic turns to gravity, can't live up to my destiny
No majesty in me, I'm falling into a darkness

Hiding
A long bygone anxiety has taken our sanity
Our hearts betray ourselves, we're losing control of arcos

All my life
High fidelity to my kingdom beyond forever
Never lost my inner voice in favour of my crown!
All my life
Put in jeopardy in a heartbeat begone! Forever!
I'm a queen without a choice
(the world turned upside down!)

Running
An overpowering enemy has taken our bravery
Our weapons turned on me, I'm possibly twice defeated?

Rising
A long forgotten symphony of hate attaints our unity
We're poisoning ourselves, and while I defend our glorious throne
The stars are colliding over my home

(Home) where people used to trust one another
(Home) where strangers turned to sister and brother
(Home) where you and me belong to forever
Home - can't see my home
(Home) the genesis of love and compassion
(Home) the haven in the heart of our nation
(Home) the paragon of peerless perfection
Under attack, oh we need to fight back now!

All my life
High fidelity to my kingdom beyond forever
I'm a queen without a choice
(the world turned upside down!)

Run, you cannot hide, we come,
We hunt you down and then we'll take you one by one
You can't trust anyone, the hunting has begun
You're done before the sun breaks your final dawn

Run, you cannot hide, we come,
We hunt you down and then we'll take you one by one
You can't trust anyone, the hunting has begun
You're done before the sun breaks your final dawn

Run, you cannot hide, we come,
We hunt you down and then we'll take you one by one
You can't trust anyone, the hunting has begun
You're done before the sun breaks your final dawn
You won't recognize your own home

(Home) where life ignites the first of all heartbeats
(Home) the cradle of all hope when we're heartsick
(Home) where you and me unite when our heart's weak
Under attack, oh we need to fight back now!
Take up the fight for the crown and our own folk!

All my life
Put in jeopardy, in a heartbeat - I'm losing

All my life
High fidelity, to my kingdom beyond! Forever!
Never lost my inner voice in favour of my crown!

All my life
On a heartbeat, bygone, a heartbeat!
Bygone forever!
I'm a queen without a choice
(the world turned upside down!)

All my life
To my kingdom, to my kingdom beyond! Forever!
Never lost my inner voice ...
