Winds will change and skies will fall
When the bards arrive
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We all feel so alive

Earth will shake and fires burn
When the bards unite
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We're so alive tonight

From eight pubs of sacred lands
We shall gather now
From each of all eight continents
We'll find a way to now
It's been foretold, it's destiny
That we shall meet again
To recreate this melody
That once had been made

Into battle one against four
The widest world's what we're fighting for

Winds will change and skies will fall
When the bards arrive
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We all feel so alive

Furrowed land are at our side
Dragon, spread your wings !
Annihilate the dark one's might
History begins !

Into battle one against four
Into the black eye of a storm

Winds will change and skies will fall
When the bards arrive
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We all feel so alive

Earth will shake and fires burn
When the bards unite
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We're so alive tonight

Into battle one against four
Witness the fire and smoke

Winds will change and skies will fall
When the bards arrive
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We all feel so alive

Earth will shake and fires burn
When the bards unite
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We all will survive

Winds will change and skies will fall
When the bards arrive
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We all feel so alive

Earth will shake and fires burn
When the bards unite
When the bard's call sounds out loud
We're so alive tonight
