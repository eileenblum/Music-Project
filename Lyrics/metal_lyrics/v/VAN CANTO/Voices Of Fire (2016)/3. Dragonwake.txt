Again, I find myself at night,
Falling awake from a dream
Memories, one-of-a-kind,
Still I wonder who once sowed them

Into my mind
And into my life
Forebodings moving by

Somehow I know you,
Faithfulness I owe you
Worlds wandâring silently,
While the dragon sleeps.

Into the twilight,
Dreaming, gaining insight
Worlds waiting endlessly,
While the dragon sleeps

Helplessness about what they tell,
I refuse to believe
Chaos entering my realm,
Still I wonder who wants to

Deceive my delight,
Bereaving my might
Should I mistrust myself?

Somehow I know you,
Faithfulness I owe you
Worlds wandâring silently,
While the dragon sleeps

Into the twilight,
Dreaming, gaining insight
Worlds waiting endlessly,
While the dragon sleeps

Wheels of time are turning round
What theyâve done comes back to us and
What goes up surely must go down
We are not the ones to turn the tide
We are destined to survive this night

Wake up!
Wake up, dragon! Dragonwake!
Wake up, dragon! Dragonwake!
Wake up, dragon! Dragonwake!

The dragon awakes.
He wakes up. [16x]

Somehow I know you,
Faithfulness I owe you
Worlds wandâring silently,
While the dragon sleeps

Into the twilight,
Dreaming, gaining insight,
Worlds waiting endlessly,
While the dragon sleeps

Somehow I know you,
Faithfulness I owe you
Worlds wandâring silently,
While the dragon sleeps

Into the twilight,
Dreaming, gaining insight
Worlds waiting endlessly,
While the dragon sleeps
