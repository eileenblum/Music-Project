Sonic signs are waiting
For me to show a way
I am anticipating
To be the perfect deputy

But to be honest, I am my fatherÂ´s son
A chosen one

While the world is changing
I try to keep an open mind
Even though itÂ´s plain to see
That things remained the same inside
(I remain the same inside)

(From) now Â´til the end of a lifetime
Let me be myself
Let me be invincible
In stories I can tell
Until the end of a lifetime
Let me be myself
I define my heaven
Send the doubting ones to hell

Everyone has seen it
"The only perfect way"
Ignoring there are crossings
That make the target fade away

Now I know whatÂ´s going on
I bring it back into my heart
The blood of youth
It didnÂ´t change its color
Red to black

Now I know how to carry on
I bring them voices from within
So the blind can see
ItÂ´s time for me, now to bring them back

Denying where I come from
DonÂ´t seem to be too true
This is why I roam on
Take your doubts, they are all for you
