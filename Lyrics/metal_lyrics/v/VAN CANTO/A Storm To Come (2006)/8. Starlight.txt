I feel a heat inside
The past begun to thaw
My mind describes the picture
That I want to draw

What I have waited for
It seems to be so near
And every step closer
Is damping the fear

All I am lies right in front of me
Where did I go wrong
That it took so many nights to be
Where I belong?

Starlight
Please enlighten me
I feel so immortal
Starlight
Raised to let me
See what was, what is
and what will be

This one goes out to the preachers of the light
That never broke the promise
"YouÂ´ll get there, if you still care"
This one goes out to the darkness of the night
Planning my Atlantis
I did not drown. No, I got there!

All I am lies right in front of me
Where did I go wrong
That it took so many nights to be
Where I belong?
I am back again

Starlight
Please enlighten me
I feel so immortal
Starlight
Raised to let me
See what was, what is
and what will be

All I am lies right in front of me
I am back where I belong
And the truth it lies beyond
These gates of dawn
