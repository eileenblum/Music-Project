I hear a voice from below
SomethingÂ´s wrong and
As soon as these words are
Intruding my mind I do know:
It is her whoÂ´s betrayed
By her consciousness
Starting to fade

And as if I still had
Needed to know
SheÂ´s the only one
Fear starts to grow

SheÂ´s alive
What a wonderful
Creation bringing time
SheÂ´s alive
And she knows inside
SheÂ´s alive
What a wonderful
And joyful singing time
SheÂ´s alive
And I know inside

My life speed starts slowing down
All of my future plans mistrusted
And as IÂ´m standing here
I start to drown
(ItÂ´s) not up to me anymore
I know I need her more than ever before

SheÂ´s struggling against hands of darkness reaching out
The more time is fading the less I will doubt
A woman like her is built to return
As sheÂ´s regaining I cry out for her
