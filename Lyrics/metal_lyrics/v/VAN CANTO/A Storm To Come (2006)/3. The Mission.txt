For years and years we waited
and now the time has come
to leave these barren lands
towards (new) horizons.

No matter what has happened
and what was said or done.
Words are to be to forgotten.
We will roam on!

We cross the gates of darkness
into the black of night.
We don't fear anybody:
(we) got the second sight.

We move a little further
towards the borderline.
Before the dawn of day
our souls come back to life.
And life comes back again.

The mission's to fight to be free again.
To stand our ground and to be immortal.
This is our mission so here we stand.
We have the right to be ourself again.
The mission's to fight to be free again.

They held us down for so long
our backs against the wall
we didn't see a future,
did not hear the call.

But now that things have changed
now that our fears are small
we create a vision
(and we) face it - one for all.

We cross the gates of darkness
into the black of night.
We don't fear anybody:
(we) got the second sight.

We move a little further
towards the borderline.
Before the dawn of day
our souls come back to life.
And all I see, in front of me.
Every step I take is bringing me closer to me!

All that we are is everything we've ever been.
And what we'll be is what we are.
