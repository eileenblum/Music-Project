Thirst is slowly crawling
Through roads of life
Awaiting someone who will hear
A call for resurrection
In heartless times
Waiting for someone who will
Undo the fear

Please surrender my fate
Give me more pleasant days
There is nothing to focus my eyes on until

Rain falls on white scattered grounds
Mirroring the light
breaking through every cloud
Thirst will vanish
Healing, feeding, breathing life
Rain falls on white scattered grounds
Bring us back to life

Thoughts of water seen
Like distant memories
I donÂ´t remember where IÂ´m from
Cannot live in this world
This is what I know
Something inside me is
Pushing me on and on
