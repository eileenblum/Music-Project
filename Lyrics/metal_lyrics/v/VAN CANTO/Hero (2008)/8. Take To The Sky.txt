"Faith and creed and my belief
Will make you carry on these wings of trust.
You will fly away.
Just hold on and you'll succeed.
Remember you're the [one]
One
Day one will speak of you
As the light of day."

Only my thoughts will remain.
Nothing that ever took place will smut my name.
I will start over again .
I fly with teardrops in my eyes...
will I ever return to places I have been?

[Chorus:]
I take to the sky.
I look back from high above.
I am on target
For something beyond.
I take to the sky.
Still grounded on Mother Earth.
Thankful for strong wings to fly.
I will take to the sky.

I can ensure you that I will always keep you in my heart until I die.
Nothing will part us again.
I fly with teardrops in my eyes.
Will I ever return to places I have been?
For years and years I tried.
I'll finally arrive.
Thunderous the winds will blare my name.

[Chorus]

[Solo]

"Faith and creed and my belief
will make you carry on these wings of trust.
You will fly away.
Just hold on and you'll succeed.
Remember you're the (one) one
Day one will speak of you
As the light of day"

[Chorus x2]

"One day one will speak of you
As the light of day"
