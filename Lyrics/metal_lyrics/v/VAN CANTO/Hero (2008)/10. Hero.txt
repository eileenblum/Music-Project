(Hero!! Hero!!)

Cold sweat dreaming...
Am I awake?
I feel drained...
With fevered screaming...
My thoughts they break
I am pained...

Lights are flickering down the wall
My eyes they burn.
An angel's voice then starts to talk
Hypnotised my head I turn.

I have started many miles away
to find our hero and finally lead him astray.

[Chorus:]
Oh, is it me they call hero?
Oh, is it me they await?
Oh, is it me they call hero?
Heroes are there to change fate.

Wheezing winds slit my ears,
It's hard to breath...
My eyes they water,
My eyelids hurt.
It's hard to see...
Try to figure out the way
I am flying...
What's this journey all about?
Again the angel heaves a sigh.

I started many miles away
To find the hero and finally lead him astray.

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Yeah, it is me they call hero
Yeah, it is me they await
Yeah, it is me they call hero
Heroes are there to change fate. [x2]
