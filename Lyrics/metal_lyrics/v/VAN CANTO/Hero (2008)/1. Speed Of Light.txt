I have walked about a million miles,
Step by step into the haze.
To notice it it took a while
That circles where the ways I made.
Is it far too late?
Changing my own fate.
A million voices telling me:
"Tomorrow is a different day.
Our concept is to do the same,
The opposite of yesterday".
Let me get away.

[Chorus:]
At the speed of light I fly
I'm one step away.
Seconds turn days into nights
And I am on my way.
At the speed of light I fly
Aeons passing by.
All believers still alive
At speed of light they fly.

A cave, narrow walls surrounding me.
This is just a place to die.
Although sometimes one gets to see
Shiny lightnings passing by
At the speed of light,
Breaking through the night.
A million voices telling me
Nonsense I should listen to.
There's better life beyond these walls,
And now I know what to do:

I will get away.

End what was there, what has been.
Break the silence.
Tell me about what you hold inside.
See what is here, what will be.
Be inspired.
Take off to fly to a better life.

[Chorus]

Flying at the speed of light
The speed of life is quickly passing by.
Still it's all the same.
Flying at the speed of light
The speed of life is quickly passing by.
I'm here to remain. [x2]

[Solo]

End what was there, what has been.
Break the silence.
Tell me about what you hold inside.
See what is here, what will be.
Be inspired.
Take off to fly to a better life.

[Chorus]
