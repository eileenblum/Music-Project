Now I admit what is obvious: this is no place to stay. (Ahhh!!)
Though I know all that's behind and nothing before me. (Ohhh!!)
I must move on, I'm a roamer, a wanderer on his way. (Ohhh!!)
How come my feet just won't follow the road that was chosen for me.

On stormwinds I'm riding, there's no sense in hiding.
There's no doubt at all, the last wall will fall.
And now that I can see I am way before me.
I'll fly just to follow the call.

[Chorus:]
This is the way,
(I am the pathfinder)
The very next step leads me straight to the core.
At the end of the day,
(I am the pathfinder)
Still roaming on that's what pathfinders (are) for.

(OhhhhOhhhh!!!)

Ten years of trying to fly have proven the strength in me. (Ahhh!!)
Not one single time was I able to lift off the ground. (Yeah!!)
Now I fly higher and faster because I believe in me. (Ohhh!!)
My black wings are beating and filling the air with a symphonic sound.

On stormwings I'm riding, there's no sense in hiding.
There's no doubt at all, the last wall will fall.
And now that I can see I am way before me.
I'll fly just to follow the cal.

[Chorus x2]

[Solo/Riffs]

[Chorus x3]

(OhhhOhhhOhhh!!)
