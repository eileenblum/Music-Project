A fiery soul's motion
Inside a vibration never seen
Fragments from our existence
Cosmic instruments released

I travel mathematical events
The mind's space in centre
Beams of a star, hides
The function a spirit swallows

In ecstacy burning
The universal door
Every spark sinks into the dark

My visibility, a nebular eruption
From the night sky's zones,
The cross worlds profound
A coronation from flares
