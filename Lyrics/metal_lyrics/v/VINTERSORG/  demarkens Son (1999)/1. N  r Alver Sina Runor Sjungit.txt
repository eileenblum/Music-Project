[Music and lyrics: Vintersorg]

SolmÃ¤rkets brladfang nu star
Vid storskog och rimhÃ¶ljda snar
Kom! Syster och broder fran lid
Nu stundar en alvehÃ¶gtid

En gatfull slÃ¤kt
I daggkapa skrudad
Av skymningen vÃ¤ckt
Ur mossan som dess hemvist tÃ¤ckt

[Ref:]
NÃ¤r alver sina runor sjungit
Fran asar, utÃ¶ver fald
Och pa frostÃ¶m vÃ¤xtbÃ¤dd sprungit
Med Ã¶dets hÃ¤rold
Skola Ã¶demarken viska
Fran trolldomskÃ¤llans brÃ¶st
Sasom nordavindar friska
Med en sarogÃ¶st

HÃ¶stmoln flyr
I bradstÃ¶rtad resa
Ãver kÃ¤rrlagg och myr
I, av trolltyg omstralat Ã¤ventyr

[Ref:]

En rikesfamnande syn
Beskadad av stjÃ¤rnblick fran skyn

[English translation:]

[When Elves Have Sung Their Runes]

The solstice presence now stand
By great forest and rime veiled thickets
Come! Sister and brother from slope
Now an elf feast approaches

An enigmatic kin
Clad in dew cloak
Woken by twilight
From the moss which has covered their abode

When elves have sung their runes
From ridges, over plains
And have ran on frost-sore growth bed
With the herald of fate
The wilderness shall whisper
From the breast of the spring of magic
Like fresh northern winds
With a tale voice

Autumnal clouds flee
In headlong journey
Over marsh and bog
In an adventure surrounded by creatures1

When elves have sung their runes
From ridges, over plains
And have ran on frost-sore growth bed
With the herald of fate
The wilderness shall whisper
From the breast of the spring of magic
Like fresh northern winds
With a tale voice

A realm-embracing sight
Seen by star-gaze from the sky
