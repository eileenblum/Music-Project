An extension of the theories
Gravitates across the seas
Changing the accepted terms,
But still it only confirms
That it is as equal close (or far)
To an atom as it's to a star

We know that signals trigger nerves,
But what starts the signal's curves?
That's in charge of every thought,
From that source our conscious is taught
That it is as equal close (or far)
To an atom as it's to a star

So, is knowledge a friend or a foe?
'Cause you don't suffer from what you don't know
But in arguments we hunt the reasons
That explains the Thesis's seasons
Chaos, order and complexity,
That challenges our intellectuality
For things that lie in the asymmetric hole, 
For too long, we've given the Devil that role

We're the parameter that draws
The map of the existing laws
To break those laws isn't a crime,
It solved Newton's conflict with "time"

Into the arena Einstein stepped 
And widened the universal concept
He opened a new detecting phase,
But Dark Matter is still a maze

Analysis with a microscope
Only tenses the polymathic rope 
In that focus we eagerly stir,
But the focus seems more like a blur

"Our quest of the highest theory,
Is controlled by that theory, 
So the way we think
Is the closest link?
An expedition through different views
Gives us richly faceted clues,
Let us focus on some of the elements
That's a source for endless experiments"
