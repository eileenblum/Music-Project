"Matter creates a play, persistent and keen,
Where the night have opened its curtain 
Harmonic pictures on the sky's enormous screen
With a contra positioned twin hiding within"

Faster, twice as fast than the gravitation equation permits,
Is the rotation of the celestial spheres
But if Einstein's calculation to this failure admits, 
We wouldn't even know about the calculation's fears,

That the: gas clouds in galaxy clusters have a too little mission,
While wearing dark halos of matter
They would need four times of their gravity erudition
To silence our question's patter, (about the)

Dark matter mystery, 
Blackbody spectrum,
An interstellar medium
We're tracing lost energy
That's swallowed by an unplanetary tum
At the worlds bivium 

Like a shadow to the starfeild's determinism,
The invisible twin follows its pace
Comprehensible monism changed to indefinable pluralism
Is it super-symmetry's surrounding face? (in a)

Dark matter mystery, 
Blackbody spectrum,
An interstellar medium
We're tracing lost energy
That's swallowed by an unplanetary tum
At the worlds bivium 

Are we wrong in our definition of mass and weight?
Or, is a subatomic particle playing hide and seek?
'Cause light is missing to pronounce cosmos' fate,
While, mass discrepancy drains through a major leak

Brown and white dwarfs two candidates,
Black holes and neutron stars two others
But through multitudes of observation of their states,
We know that gravitational leansing hide their mothers (it's a)

Dark matter mystery,

We're tracing lost energy
That's swallowed by an unplanetary tum

"Like Bell, I connect my senses to the vast
Stellar mirror, where signals bounces from clast to clast"
