[Man:]
Our evolving existence
Is the wording of our endless strife

[Matter:]
But what about my assistance?
Of granting you these questions of life

[Man:]
I'm built by you, but you live only through me
A paradox that I still escape

[Matter:]
But, it's by that clue that your thinking can be
The reader of my numerous shapes

So, sharpen your mind tools,
your grammar of logics refines
And sharpens your mind tools,
Cause the thinking of thinking evolves your thinking
Mind tools,
Reasoning dug forth from inner mines
With sharpened mind tools
Your awareness is kept from sinking,
Into sleep

[Man:]
But the principle of awareness stretches
In our nerves, longer than the ecavator

[Matter:]
I'm your sensible nerve that fetches
Your views. Your thoughts resonator

So, sharpen your mind tools,
your grammar of logics refines
And sharpens your mind tools,
Cause the thinking of thinking evolves your thinking
Mind tools,
Reasoning dug forth from inner mines
With sharpened mind tools
Your awareness is kept from sinking,
Into sleep
