["we are imprisoned in unbounded space" - W.H. Auden]

An alternation of progress and reaction,
Envelop the surroundings of man
Wavelengths build its sparkling attraction,
Is it an accident or a plan?

Creation models, one by one
Don't dare to look closely at the signs
But why should one fear, the things that are dun?
It's just what Nature itself designs

TRACING the substances in age and distance,
SCANNING the extensive universe 
FOLLOWING the grammar of the known existence, but
EXPLORING the possibility of a vaster multiverse

Maybe it's time to solve the enigma, 
To let philosophy have its toll
To gaze beyond the factor of sigma,
The constructions may resemble a Russian doll

From molecules to giant stars
The steps increase without intervention
Let your mind slip through the earthly bars,
'Cause the stars are the molecules in the next dimension?

Every thought's a compressed dream,
That lives in the hidden planes
Myriads of spheres in its luminosity's beam,
But still the complex connection sustains
