The optical nerve screened off since birth,
Alone where the proximity of darkness reposed
By undiscovered mysteries, as concealed in dirt
The quiescent eye got exposed

The physical range of vision lost,
Between iris and synapses the link is broken
But the presence of mind over-crossed
The barriers that stood like fluency token

Reading pictures through the aura's energy,
A sensor for visual thinking and analysis
From that exterior compass into interior synergy
A merging of spirit and mind into synthesis

Pictorial impulses trigger the mechanism,
A mental blending of their entrance 
Soul-born impressions end the blindsight`s schism, 
And expands the human competence

Functions in the hidden eye,
A window to intuitive perception
The visions become stars in the soul's sky 
And lights the immense conception 

Explore the lining of sensibility
To understand the spirit's anatomy
Your inner space's imagery
Is vaster than astronomy 

See the inflections in the normal
Just as a signature of the paranormal 

And the once so illogical consequence, will become logical
