[Music: Vintersorg]
[Lyrics: Karl-Erik Forsslund, freely translated by Vintersorg]

Algol, demon, capricious your brightness
shifts from day to day - rises, abates, intesifies
again, sometimes triumphant and sparkling,
sometimes pale and faint. For a long time
we've searched with wonder for the key
to this mystery, the right element to
your eager and changing, queer temperament.

Now we've dispearsed the haze of the riddle:
you've got a companion on your journey,
like a slave, a faithful shadow he
constantly follows you on the desolate
path, he circles and sneaks quiet around you, closely.

Never have we seen his guise, dark, parches,
stiff and cold, but still we know he exists;
like ashamed he hides behind you - free
and merry you shine - until he once
again crawls out of the darkness and
covers you. And your glare becomes
pallid and dull, and your mind cloudy.

Now we've dispearsed the haze of the riddle:
you've got a companion on your journey,
like a slave, a faithful shadow he
constantly follows you on the desolate
path, he circles and sneaks quiet around you, closely.

And similars there are - many Algols
wanders in the space - maybe even
more among us on earth. Sunlight spirits
darkened by a shadow, young princes
concealed by old slaves, doublesouls,
divided creatures - a blissful son of the
light indissolubely linked with a bitter dark demon.

Now we've dispearsed the haze of the riddle:
you've got a companion on your journey,
like a slave, a faithful shadow he
constantly follows you on the desolate
path, he circles and sneaks quiet around you, closely.
