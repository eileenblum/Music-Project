[Musik &amp; Lyrik by Vintersorg]

NordstjÃ¤rnan vandrar min dunkelblÃ¥a vy
Naturen slÃ¥r pÃ¥ sin harpas strÃ¤ngar
Trollelden skÃ¤r genom bergluft och sky
Upplyser talhed och spirande Ã¤ngar

FÃ¥ngad utav nordens sjÃ¤l, fÃ¥ngad utav nordens sjÃ¤l
MÃ¥nskensslÃ¶jor gyller sagolika landskap
FÃ¥ngad utav nordens sjÃ¤l, fÃ¥ngad utav nordens sjÃ¤l

En Ã¶gonfÃ¤gnad som vÃ¤cker minnet
En tjusarkraft som fjÃ¤ttrar sinnet

Morgondimma tÃ¥gar med dagg i fÃ¶rbund
Smyger sakta fram under fÃ¤ders granar
Den frommaste drÃ¶msyn vid sikttÃ¤ndarns lund
I jordens mÃ¤rg nu kÃ¤llorna manar

FÃ¥ngad utav nordens sjÃ¤l, fÃ¥ngad utav nordens sjÃ¤l
MÃ¥nskensslÃ¶jor gyller sagolika landskap
FÃ¥ngad utav nordens sjÃ¤l, fÃ¥ngad utav nordens sjÃ¤l

Synvidden blidkade min sorgtyngda hÃ¥g
NÃ¤r jag furstliga fjÃ¤llvÃ¤rlden sÃ¥g

[English translation:]

Captured By The Spirit Of The North

The North Star wanders my gloom-blue view
Nature hits on the strings of her harp
The magic fire cuts through mountain air and sky
Illuminates pine moor and sprouting meadows

Captured by the spirit of the north, captured by the spirit of the north
Veils of moonshine gilds tale-like landscapes
Captured by the spirit of the north, captured by the spirit of the north

A delight for the eye that wakes the memory
An enchanting power that fetters the mind

The morning mist marches in union with dew
Moves slowly forward under fathers' spruces
The most gentle dream sight at the grove of the end of sight
In the marrow of the earth the springs now call

Captured by the spirit of the north, captured by the spirit of the north
Veils of moonshine gilds tale-like landscapes
Captured by the spirit of the north, captured by the spirit of the north

The sight appeased my sorrowfilled mind
When I saw the princely mountain world
