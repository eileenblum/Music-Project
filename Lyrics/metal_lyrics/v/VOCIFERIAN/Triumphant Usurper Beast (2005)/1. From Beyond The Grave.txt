From beyond the grave
The throne of fallen grace
Buried beneath our feet
No salvation but torments

The epitaph is carved in the stone
As to finalize this life long of sorrow

Coldness of your funeral,
But from the world you don't beg no tear
Coldness of your funeral,
But from the world you expect no tear

From beyond the grave...

Decomposing putrefaction
Revolting smell of the dead
Leads you to the forgotten
The infernal void of mourning...
And desperation

Now you forsake your name
He is calling you...
Now you forsake your name
To be entirely unlighted in his shadow

From beyond the grave...

Here comes the chapter written by Death
The article of blood which follows up
The now burning book of your existence...
The now burning book of your life...
