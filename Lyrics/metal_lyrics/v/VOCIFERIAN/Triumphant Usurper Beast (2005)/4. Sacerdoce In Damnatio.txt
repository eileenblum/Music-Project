My body is the sanctuary of his will
I am his temple
This area of pain and endless screams
Obscene, insane Gloria singing out in my head

Alleluia Sathanas
Alleluia to the kingdom of the bitch hooked on the cross

A lifetime of dedication to malevolence
A wolf in a guise of sheep waiting for so long
Perfidious subterfuge is mine
I am the perverted, the converted betrayer

Bodies are lying all around
I'm preaching over you all dead
You are dead but you don't even know it
Careless, I'll continue praying the one who really hears me
I'm rotten as hell, I'm the priest of lividity
My voice only speaks the language of vociferation

Alleluia Sathanas
Alleluia to the kingdom of the bitch hooked on the cross

Bringing me your children thinking I'm kindness embodied
I'll rape them one by one...

Sucking my leprous cock, they will learn the art of horror...
