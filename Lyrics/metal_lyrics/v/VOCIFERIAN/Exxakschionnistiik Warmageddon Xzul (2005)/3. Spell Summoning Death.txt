Demonically winged blizzard is my lair
As coldness claws bite my flesh
Eternally shining in the blue mist
I'm the ubiquitous incarnation of pest

I'm the Star in which you draw the Goat
You servants of Mystical Evil

I am the Storm Holocaust
The Throne of Skulls the Coffin of Stone
I am the Black Summoning of Death
The Frozen North Mysticism Blessing

I command the Hells and Inferno
The harshest gusts the blade in your throat
I'm the Sempiternal Tragedy of Winter Funeral
The crows circling above your corpse

I'm everything you desire and hate
The painful slash at the back of your faith

BLOOD FROST
SALT IN YOUR WOUNDS
