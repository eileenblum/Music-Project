Wintered landscape eternity of virginity
Cradle of an ancient disappeared society
You don't see a life you don't hear a sound
The land of the nihilists has finally been found

All seems to be dead and petrified by the cold
Red moon burning through the iciest winds of sorrow
Old domain of a spectral entity imprisoned in frost
Embracing the infinite abyssal white horizon

All seems to be dead and petrified by the cold
Red moon burning through the iciest winds of sorrow...

Ghost of a comet congealed for thousand years
Stellar forest of firmament lighten by its glare
Frostbitten site whitely wrapped of purity
Mighty Raven Witness of the Northern Glory...
