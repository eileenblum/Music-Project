Free from every Godness protocol shit
My head is up high while my boots stomp your filth
So let me spit on your faked Lord doctrines
For the Carpenter's son to be crushed under Iron Fists

The role you chose deserves no pity
You coward wanted death for your fame to be sing
But there for me you died unknown and unseen
Chocked in black silence your rotten cross meant nothing

There was no light the day they finished you
You brought us none message, you never were
To me it's all the same : Martyrs are weak who belong to the forgotten
I'll draw my road out of all this, and succeed through My Own Creed Excess

Aryan Ultimate Riot Shall Comes
Cleansing weak and contaminated

Pitiful enemies can start shaking with fear
With no mercy we'll cleanse the ground from their filth
This time I swear this is the last battle
Final Solution must prevails

We'll be victorious brothers and friends
We've been chosen to be punish the Sub-men

On the ruins of these battlefields, will be established a new age,
Here comes the new order, the Pride of our Nations and Men
New day rising, on frostbitten faces Black Sun shines our glory
Ready to breed the Youth of Tomorrow through Strictness and Severity
