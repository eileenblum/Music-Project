Hailz Mutilation Grip
Insane Pessimist Lucidity
Vespers of the Satanist Philosophy
Driven to Extreme Self-Slavery

Realistic thoughts re-composition
Of what you gave and what you've been offered
Consummating the estranged blood
Why not bleed those you have already forsaken

All that left is lost
To leave a mark or nothing
It's all the same
Slay your dead offspring

Give Satan all your worst
Murder your son for no reward
You'll get the same at the end
You'll die a crust anyway...

Kill your people first
Shed your own blood...

Give Satan all your worst
Murder your son for no reward
