Funeral demonic oration
Ancient witchery reminiscence
Forbidden ceremonial invocation
Violent paralysing spiritual trance

Apparition of Thy Black Master
In magmata, fire and dust
I response to my dark obedience
Self-cursed in self-molestation...

...RITUALS

Servants spreading scourges of hell
Sinners blinded by unholy sights
Sepulchral communion with Azazel
While in death we Satanize this burial

Almighty gloom, fog around the grave
Obey to malignancy's commandment

Soul of a demon, possessed dead friend
Accomplish the rite of desecration...

Servants spreading scourges of hell
Sinners blinded by unholy sights
Sepulchral communion with Azazel
While in death we Satanize this burial

SATANIZED FUNERAL RITES...
