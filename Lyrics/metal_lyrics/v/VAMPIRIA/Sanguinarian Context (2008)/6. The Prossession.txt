Noise in the heaven, tumble the earth, prophetics sounds comes with the wind
I hear the trumpets of angels of doom, now we are riding over the ancient snake
Holy destruction, punishment promised, this is the end, yes, the Armageddon.
Now we are walking in procession, like fallen angels, to lake of fire

To hell with us!
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust,
Promised land is now on flames
Can you hear the lament that carry the wind?
A valley of tear in where we live
Holy destruction, punishment promised, this is the end, yes, the Armageddon.

Now we are walking in procession, like fallen angels, to lake of fire
To hell with us!
Across of fire on the horizon burn
worse than hell, shine more than sun
The pestilence involve the earth, death walk among us showing here best smile
Preachers and priest try to save the world, but they cannot save themselves souls
Now we are walking in procession like fallen angels to lake of fire
