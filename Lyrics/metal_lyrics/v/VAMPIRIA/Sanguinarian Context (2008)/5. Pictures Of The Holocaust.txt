Pictures of the holocaust, like blazing memory burns in my mind;
Cannot control, cannot to avoid.
Evil I made is a vivid presence
I don't remorse, just feel some kind of guilt
Evil I made is a vivid presence
I don't remorse, just feel some kind of guilt

Dismembered bodies with horrid grimace
hang in the walls of my twisted mind
A monstrous gallery of pictures of the holocaust, pictures of my holocaust
Evil I made is a vivid presence,
Evil I made is a tortuous presence...

Dismembered bodies with horrid grimace hang in the walls of my twisted mind
Morbid evocation of chaos

Dismembered bodies with horrid grimace hang in the walls of my twisted mind
Morbid evocation of chaos

Behind their mirror I can feel the cold darkness image of phantoms are gathering around my coffin
(...I can't wait to see the star! She shine into my eyes)
Time it's no passing in the dimension of the death angels everything floating in a deep gloom into my silence
(...I can't wait to see the star! She shine into my eyes, my morning star)

Pictures of the holocaust, like blazing memory burns in my mind;
Cannot control, cannot to avoid.
