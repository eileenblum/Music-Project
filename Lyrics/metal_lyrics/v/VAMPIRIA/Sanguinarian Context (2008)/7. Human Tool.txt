Control of mass, generate slaves.
Preaching the lies over the world to harvest
chaos, hiding the truth, twisting the knife inside the open wound
Massive attack to subconscious makes human tools
Now hate rules and chaos rise, (this is the game)
Who can find the truth, when all of us are confronted?
this is the way to serve to preachers of lies
Confounded minds are the best place to put
the doubt, it makes us stagnt and loose the way and then we are tools.
Systematic and automatic is the attitude, the human is like a little piece (on a mechanism)
