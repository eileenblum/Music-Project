When the night comes psicho mutatio begins, people shows psichotic side and it's behavior  within
Look where you walk, do it so carefully, cause you cannot see all that there inhabit
Welcome to the night, take off the mask, show your real face
The night can redempt a sin with ither, and I will to sin, tonight
we live in the dark, where no one dares to go, cause the fear feed our ancestral instinct
The psichotic side that exist in our mind wake up in the night, when the conscious sleeps
Welcome to the night, take off the mask, show your real face
The night can redempt a sin with other, and I will go to sin tonight
I have this cold eyes of tomorrow trying to see a form of life
I walk the true path of sorrow beneath this dark supernal night
Old castles burn away in the horizon black ravens are veiling the stars
A secret passage between unnamed graves I feel my mind out of this world
We live in the dark, where no one dares to go, cause the fear feed our ancestral instinct
The psichotic side that exist in our mind wake up in the night, when the conscious sleep
Welcome to the night take off the mask, show your real face
The night can redempt a sin with other, and I will go to sin
Welcome to the night, take off the mask, show your real face
The night can redempt a sin with other, and I will go to sin, tonight.
