As your souls, black are our wings, nobody look us when we comes with the storm
Our language is the thunder
A warning writted in the stars, it's a dark Gonder hidden in the stormy skies
Lonely riders on black horses with eyes of fire
Our message is thunder, our language is strong wind, for weaks it'll be tempest, music for strong ones
As our souls, black are our wings, nobody looks us when we come with the storm
Travel vault of heavens with a cold smile
Dark creatures born from a stormy cloud, a thunderlight annunciate our arrival
Those who came with the storm preach words of chaos.. Chaos!
