Contorted, distorted, by wrath manipulated
I feel your pain like love to me, so then please come and love me suffering,
Don't fear the knife, just one more cut.

Your skin looks so pretty in red,
My mind flows in ecstasy;
I don't remember anything, just taste of blood and your last smile.

Your skin looks so pretty in red,
My mind flows in ecstasy;
I don't remember anything, just taste of blood and your last smile.

Everything I've got are only fragments of pleasure,
An incomplete memory and a bad reputation.
Everything I've got are only fragments of pleasure,
An incomplete memory and a bad reputation.
What can I do?

I'm feeling very sick, but satisfied at the same time.
Contorted, distorted, by wrath manipulated
I feel your pain like love to me, so then please come and love me suffering,
Don't fear the knife, just one more cut.
