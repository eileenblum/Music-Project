Take as yours (the) breath of timeless wind and sing the song of Maldoror
A virulent outburst of thoughts
Hill illuminate dark depths of mind (your true nature will be revealed to you)
Dark is our name, violent our conception, horror finders is all we are
Ghastly dreams disturb my sleep, new bad thought takes roots in my soul
So reality comes and I'm the ghoul searching for new ways of horror
Your true name will be revealed to you, appear innocently, umprejudiced to this new universe of emotions
Ghastly dreams disturb my sleep, new bad thought takes roots in my soul
So reality comes and I'm the ghoul searching for new ways of of horror
I'm the shadow behind you, imagining how to cause pain
Take as yours (the) breath of timeless wind and sing the song of Maldoror
A virulent outburst of thoughts
Hill illuminate dark depths of mind (your true nature will be revealed to you)
Dark is our nature, violent our conception, horror finders is all we are
Your true nature will be revealed to you
Appear innocently, umprejudiced to this new universe of emotions
We arn't monsters, just humans, to much human.
