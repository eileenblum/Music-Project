Open the doors, the twilight doors and feel the power of darkness, receive her in depth of your soul
Threshold must be crossed away, get ready for be the continent of a power keeped for centuries
And it'll be your dominion
Empire of darkness soon'll be revealed to you;
You must let die mercy and compassion to know deep sense of anxiety and passion
Threshold must be crossed away, get ready for the continent of a power keeped for centuries
And it'll be your dominion.
