The last shine of wisdom, the tree of life is dead now. I've the darkest 
vision, from the iced depths of lakes.
I saw a bloody angel, with the inverted cross of fire, his eyes full of 
hatred, has been seen the end of time.
Believe in Satan!
I will ride the wind forever, over the thorns, over any destiny. Bring me 
your light, ambassador of morning, into my hands, the flames of... Lucifer.
Fly into the night, the ashes of time will fall over us, the power of your 
spell, will be, my sword and my heart.
