Lost in a darkest wood, following the same shadow. I count the drops in my 
hands. The life is gone in my tears. I feel again the hand of death, over a 
thousand broken dreams.
Come deadly wind, come embrace the night. Now all the time it's only pain, 
another thorn in my heart. I feel again the name of death. The deadly wind 
sigh in my ears. I count the drops in my hands. The life is gone in my 
tears. I feel again the hand of death, over a thousand broken dreams. Lost 
in a darkest wood, following the same shadow.
