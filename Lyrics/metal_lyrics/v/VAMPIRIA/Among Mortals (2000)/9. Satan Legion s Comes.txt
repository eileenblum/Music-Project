Eternity. I call to you from earth. I take your ears in furious hand. I 
stretch your flesh.
Fall in dark desperation, the pain of spirit.
Igneum naturae, renovarum ispiritu!
My sword triumphant, like a dark symphony dirge, to guide human fallen 
world, into darkness, the pain of spirit, tyranical and infernal.
Satan legion's comes!
