Stranges thoughts round in my head, like ancient views in red, a call coming 
through centuries, like a legacy in my blood. there's someting growing into 
me, cannot control it much more time, i feel it round into my veins and 
begins to awake. The anxiety controls me... and your neck, so white, there's 
not too much to loose, come on, let me taste your blood.
Aeternum vitae, hereditare in sanguinis, maledical dominus (but).
I can feel the ancestral thirst, now my eyes see through the dark, we gonna 
live in the eternal night.
We gonna walk together, for all eternity wandering in the shadows, spreading 
the fear. Night will be our. To hunt and drink, to hunt and drink forever, 
the essence of life.
