Far away in time, in a lonely kingdom, lived an ancient cast who kept a 
dark.
Treasure. Cenderus attends the kingdom gates, but some day he failed and the 
curse escaped. Beware, they are free now. Beware, they are walking by your 
side. Under the spell of "He", the prince Nosferatu, they've got immortal 
life a gift that is a curse, this curse was called... Vampiria.
Master of the night, slaves of blood, condemned to live, from dusk'till 
dawn. Eternal existence, with a price paid in blood, far away from death, 
but walking beside she. Beware they're free now. Beware... you're the chosen 
one.
Master, you promise me eternal life. I'm waiting... For you!.
