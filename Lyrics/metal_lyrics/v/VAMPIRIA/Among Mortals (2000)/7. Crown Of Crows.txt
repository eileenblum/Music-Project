Through the space and time, in the beginning of the new light, the heart of 
earth feels the pawns of the dark age.
Streaming until the edge, intil the red sky falls down... until the men's  
ideas can't be used in the paradise, deformed by the human being.
They trapped the light of the new day, they held it their hearts, condemning 
the rest... to live without it.
Crown of crows... in the head of the new king, crown of crows... on the 
cross of the new god.
Behold the eternity, fading away... vanishing between us, like a ghost... 
like a sad shadow.
