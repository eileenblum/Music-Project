From far away, in the forest where i go, comes to my ears, the howling of a 
wolf... wolf!.
Terrible things waits for me, but blood calls, the path of seventh moon, 
burns in my skin.
I'm running through the trees, with a black storm starting in my eyes. I 
feel my blood. I fell the fire, burning all the land, and all is left is 
this silence of a darkest night, the Wolf invincible, the reign... into the 
shadows.
Slowly, my senses sharpening. I can smell everything in the air. A 
supernatural energy. impels-me. i'm awakening to my new being.
I'm running through the trees, with a black storm starting in my eyes. I 
feel my blood. I fell the fire, burning all the land, and all is left is 
this silence of a darkest night, the Wolf invincible, the reign... into the 
shadows.
Brother wolf, now i walk beside you,,, and we share the pray.
