In the forest, of agony, dying slowly near to be free, of a life of sorrow 
sadness and pain, is time to liberate my tortured soul.
Alone, and lost, into the forest of redemption there i'm be, there's no way 
out, finally i escape, someone heard my pray.
Behind my eyes, life vanishing, the memory flows and goes, the gratitude 
invades my senses, now my life is like an echo in the past.
Alone, and lost, into the forest of redemption there i'm be, there's no way 
out, finally i escape, someone heard my pray...
