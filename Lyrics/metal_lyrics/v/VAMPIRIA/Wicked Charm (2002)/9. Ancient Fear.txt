We are wondering through the shadows of time, against the walls of reason, condemned before born.

Behind the cross, the lies were made law and the human serve to an empty throne. 

We must to search, far beyond our ancient fear, then we'll be free, embraced to eternity We will live eternally witness of all ages, 
free of the ancient fears that enslaves the human old lies.Thorugh the eternity 's eyes we'll look the time's tide going up and down far from our coast.

Our stock will leak, pathetic human nature, time is a cloak, that now don't cover us. Elisa.
