I awake and feel a thousand hells on my soul, my tormented spirit transit the slippery surface of desperation, a paranormal energy domine my will.

I shout at the edge of dusk, and my voice emerge inhuman, a criminal wish exploids in my mind, i'm blinded and blood begins to call me.

The fury; pleasure; the blood, i'm on extasis with morbid sensations, no hope for you tonight, in your neck I will leave my stigma.

Dark emotions 'till I taste your blood, now you're mine and of the night, your angel's dying in darkness, and between my arms a vamp born.

The night is filled of emotions, my real being has awaked, your body rest among candles, 'till my legacy infects your veins,
now I'm saciated, satisfied, for now; just for now.
