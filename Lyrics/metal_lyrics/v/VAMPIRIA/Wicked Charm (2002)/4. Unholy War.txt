Lucifer, infernal majesty, the magnificent king of abyss, I invoke the force of fire in your name. From beyond... I invoke!

I rise my sword for the crown of hell, and take the torch with eternal flame ! A blackned symphony of doom begin, 
the march of hell are breaking the chains... the chains are broken, the wolf is free!

Give us the force and value for fight in your name, you lord of dark master of our rebellion guide our hands.

This sword is tempered in hell for this Unholy War. Lucifer, mighty lord, Father of eternity, I believe in the mighty grace of your spell.

Come with us ... your infernal realm!

Dark forces in my hands, spirits of ancient lands, the day start to fall, the earth start to DIE!
