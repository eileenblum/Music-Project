Dementia, right now you embrace me, and the light of goodsense extinguish in me. 

This world that they called madness is infinite and grotesque. Far away, in the reallity, I can hear that someone crys for me.

Sometimes I can see to the real thing through thick distortive glasses.

Just the pain is the same in both worlds, and mournful toll of a far bell, shoots in my mind terrible sensations,

I'm plunging on the gloomy labyrinth of dementia.

Far away, in the reality, I can hear that someone crys for me, Just the pain is the same in both worlds,

I'm plunging on the gloomy labyrinth of dementia.
