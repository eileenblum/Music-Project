So then I break the seal, and start the fire with the olden spell, with the rage of anguish, and the wrath of asphix.

I say the words to be heard for thou, to be obey for thou. I know the words that can start the fire, just break the seal an heavens will burn.

Legions of demons will fly through the sky, with slobbery jaws full of angelical flesh, look to the sea how it turn to red,
it's a big coup of blood for the king of kings. Now I can talk and your ears bleed, ancient words of impure meaning floats in the air,
glorious vision of celestial colapse, the seal is broken and a tongue of fire licks the god's throne.
