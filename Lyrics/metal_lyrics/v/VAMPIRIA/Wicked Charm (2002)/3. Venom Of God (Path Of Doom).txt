I walk, for awake in a land of resignation, I burn the cross in the temple of redemption.

For take far away the lie... for loose in my tears the pain for ever!

I take, the crown in a kingdom of desolation empire, of time mirror of desecration.

For burn in my eyes your lies, for kill with my deadly hands your power!

I see the face without eyes of the life.

I feel his cold in my spine.

I see my god disappear in the night, but I feel his venom in my path....but!

I walk, for awake....
