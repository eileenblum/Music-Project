Vlad, lord of cruelty and pain, come to my dreams, show me your hell.

Welcome foreigner to the kingdom of sadism, in this garden of hell there's a place four you. Blood flood the ground and feed the Aqueronte.

Vlad's dominions are like a reminiscence of hell. Come to my dreams, show me your hell, this forest of bodies is an altar for Vlad...this is an altar for Vlad

Those impaled bodies are like debris of hell a sadic monument or an offeriness?
