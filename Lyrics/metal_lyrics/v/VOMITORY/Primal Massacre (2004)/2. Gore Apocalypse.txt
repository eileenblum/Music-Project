[Music T. Gustafsson, Lyrics E. Rundqvist]

Screams surround everything, anxiety-ridden fear
Hundred piled corpses
Mixed with those alive, a rotten mess
Penetrated by death

In sludge of body parts crawl those who still breathe
Cold dead corpses
Crushed beneath still screaming bodies
Bowels gushed from wounds

Stream into pools of blood
Floats into a sea of death

Dead or buried alive
The skin burst underground
Suffocated by a hundred corpses
Broken bodies decompose

Stream into pools of blood
Floats into a sea of death
