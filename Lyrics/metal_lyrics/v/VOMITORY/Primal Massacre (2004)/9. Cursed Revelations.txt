[Music: T. Gustafsson, Lyrics: E. Rundqvist]

Revelations, an illusion swallows all existence
All religions have to die
One mans god, transformed into a worldwide god
Prophecies replaced by other prophecies

Possessed leaders reign in terror
All accomplishments in god's name
Madness finally rules everyone and everything
The last dawn for mankind

Born of madness
Confounded into lunacy
Generations after
Generations of disease

From the beginning
Cursed utnil the dying end
Rotten wills
Created to obey
