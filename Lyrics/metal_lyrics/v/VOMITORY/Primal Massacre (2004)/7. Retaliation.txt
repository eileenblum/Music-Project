[Music: T Gustafsson, Lyrics: E Rundqvist]

Embraced replete with sinister wrath
Paralyzed, close to collapse
Consume everything into darkness
A world so unreal and dying

A perverse possessed mind
Senses sins long time gone
Far from salvation
Confused by the smell of blood

The last sense of purity
Crushed by the impulse to kill

Punish to be punished
Justice for a mind in chaos
An unforgiving feeling
Surrounded by flesh and blood

Through the mind of growing fear
Final moment of purity
Sadistict intent to kill
One final victim must die

The last sense of purity
Crushed by the impulse to kill
