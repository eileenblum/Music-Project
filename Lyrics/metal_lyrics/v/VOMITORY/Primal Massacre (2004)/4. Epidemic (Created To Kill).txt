[Music T. Gustafsson, Lyrics E Rundqvist]

Contagious, a breed of disease
Aiborne created to kill
Boiling intestines, flesh eating plague
The skin is covered in wounds
Parasite, an infectuous spice
Screaming from deep within
No more pain, no more whispering voices
Sanity a conquered illusion

Carrier of world destroyer

What once were will never be again
A breed to inflict mankind
Nervous system close to collapse
Respiratory arrest creating panic
The skin falls apart, flesh decompose
A mind possessed by itself
Blood from the ears, blood from the eyes
Melting into a pile of gore

Carrier of World destroyer

Gastric juice drops
From the hollowed body
The bowels fall to the ground
A smell of recent slaughter

Clot of coagulated blood
Process of slaughter, Limb by Limb
Muscles stretch until they burst
Mind explodes into madness

Eyeballs turn inside out
Brain activity turns to zero
No blood left inside the body
Everything bursts into pieces

Morbid ending for a morbid infection
Fed by the taste of mankind
Dismembered ina  thousand ways
To be a host to the plague

Visceral contents, pieces of flesh
A branded human covered by death
Human experiments out of control
Infections now rule and destroy
