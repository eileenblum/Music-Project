[Music: T. Gustafsson, Lyrics: E. Rundqvist]

Forsaken in no mans land, far beyond the point of no return
Fury passing into panic, elimination until the bitter end

The fallen ones will never wake to witness victory
Indispensable for the cause, a mortal's unavoidable choice

Forgotten, expendable, sacrificed for honour

Emptiness, what is left from a growing fear
Only pain in every breath, charge towards death

All alone, crawling forwards through human blood and guts
No more voices will answer now, impious in foreign land
Every movement is critical, exterminate all memories of life
Conquered left to die, the final breath will end it all

Memories passing by clouds the mind
Memories of war, to serve and die.
