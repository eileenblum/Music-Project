[Music/Lyrics : Dalegren]

Maimed souls in an empire of dirt
Heaven or hell, it's your creation
Preference for a pendant corpse
Death is meant to last forever

Defiled purity turns to perdition
Spellbound by a Lie so old
Preachers quote the world of Lies
Sermons to induce mayhem

Demon's Divine
Disguised as Messiahs
Demon's Divine
Inverted abhorrence

Demon's Divine 
Disguised as Messiahs
Demon's Divine
Inverted abhorrence

Puppets in shape of Shepard's
Battling the throne of darkness
A megalomania showdown
Faith at the gallows ends
