[Music: T Gustafsson, Lyrics: Dalegren]

Enter the Casket Inn
At the Body Farm mansion
Vacant coffins
Or body bags
Obituaries done in blood
No graves or crosses
Funeral orgies
in flesh and blood

[Ref]
Bonesaw, scalpel, pliers and a corpse
Bonesaw, scalpel, pleirs and a corpse
Carrion, body bags, caskets and blood
Carrion, body bags, caskets and blood

Perverted obsessions
Life eternal

Impaled torsos
As garden statues

A grotesque feast
Of human flesh and pus
Arouse by pain
A gateway to death
Madness reigns
At the climax of carnage
Life now ends
At the Body Farm mansion
