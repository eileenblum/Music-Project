[Music: T. Gustafsson, Lyrics: E. Rundqvist]

Feel the razors tickle the skin
A hundred cuts release the blood
When the scalpel carves the flesh

Chainsaw the instrument for pain
Use the saw to cut the limbs
Body parts float in blood

Through the flesh, into the bones, total mutilation in blood
Carnal pain opening the skull, the crushed head starts to burst
Mangled skin falls apart, flesh-like human waste
A death enclosed with suffering until the final breath

The eyeballs leave the face
Skin falls to the ground
In a mixture of human mush
 Saw straight through the chest
Fractured ribs collapse in dust
Intestines squished from the wounds

Fleshy butchery, inhuman carnage

Strip the skin off the dead
Saw the muscles one by one
Complete the chainsaw surgery

An operation filled with blood
Total mutilated corpse
Implements covered with gore

Through the flesh, into the bones, total mutilation in blood
Carnal pain opening the skull, the crushed head starts to burst
Mangled skin falls apart, flesh-like human waste
A death enclosed with suffering until the final breath

VOMITORY is:
Erick Rundqvist - vocals &amp; bass
Urban Gustafsson - guitar
Ulf Dalegren - guitar
