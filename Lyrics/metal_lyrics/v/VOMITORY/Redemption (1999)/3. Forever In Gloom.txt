[Music: T. Gustafsson, E. Rundqvist]
[Lyrics: E. Rundqvist, U. Dalegren]

Chaos, bitter loss, escape from certain death.
Removed enemies, wounded, killed.
Nocturnal echoing from weapon symphonies.
Agonizing screams, stench of death.

The gambling with lives continues.
Glory, dishonor, orders`s been given.

Warmasters reign their soldiers through death.
Future prospect not accounted.
Nuclear war eats the earth alive.
Humanity doomed forever in gloom.

Bloody...combats...war.
Massive...death...nuclear war.

The soil burden by ashes, acid rain glowing sun.
Future forever torn apart, a new era to come.

The gambling with lives continues.
Gloty, dishonor, order`s been given.
Nuclear war eats the eart alive.
Humanity doomed forever in gloom.
