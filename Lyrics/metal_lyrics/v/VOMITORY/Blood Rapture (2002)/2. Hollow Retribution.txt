[Music: T Gustafsson]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist, Dalegren]

Manslaughter in the flesh, an apprentice of God
Redeemer with a knife, murder divine
Existence of the grotesque, souls glowing with defeat
A torment I'll emancipate, a crusade to bless the world

Retribution for the weak, stripped from the skin
Opening the weakening within, a hollow retribution

Torn apart, limb by limb
Your severed head, in my hand
Inducing a death, beyond all pain
Collecting the bodies as trophies
Forward against completion
Into the light, your souls I'll cast away

Slowly shutting, this life down
Justified by faith killings, cleansing humanity
A demon disguised, as an angel
Healing the downfall, self termination

Retribution for the weak, stripped from the skin
Opening the weakening within, a hollow retribution
