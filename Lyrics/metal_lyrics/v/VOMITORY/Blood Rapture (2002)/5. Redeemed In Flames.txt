[Music: T Gustafsson]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist]

Slaughtered enemies scattered
Trail of death they walked
Drenched in their own blood

A sound of thousands fills the sky
A death that comes so clear
When the rain of fire falls

Flames that will consume
A boiling death appear
The last second alive

Raped in endless pain
Licked by the infernal tongue
No escape from suffering

The sky is red by burning death
Redeemed in napalm flames they died

Survival is not an option
No chance in hell
The end will come for them all

In the infernal massacre, their flesh starts to burn
Boiling skin a smell of decay
Buried in their own intestines, they rot

An endless emptiness
Ashes cover the ground
Where they obeyed their command

Silence fills the world
No living thing escapes
Mass death for them all

The sky is red by burning death
Redeemed in napalm flames they died
