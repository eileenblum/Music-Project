[Music: T Gustafsson, Dalegren]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist]

Insane, chaos of death
Invasions, fury against fury
Landmasses explode
Change owners day by day
Global participation
Global extermination
An extinction that can't be avoided
Will against will

Population increases
Over all boundaries
War the only solution
To keep humanity

Nuclear winter waits
Those few who survived
Trapped by human madness
Deep in cover underground

Resources end is near
Water undrinkable poison
A planet screaming for mercy
Universal butchery

Population increases
Over all boundaries
War the only solution
To keep humanity
