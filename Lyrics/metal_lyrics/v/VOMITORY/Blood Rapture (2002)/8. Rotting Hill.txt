[Music: T Gustafsson]
[Lyrics: Dalegren]

Disposal of the sick
Execution of the wicked
A soil filled with centuries of remains
Absurd ways of death

Die, die by the sword
Die, die by the rope

This hearse is a one-way ride
A ride into oblivion
Enter the kingdom of scavengers
Dressed up in shackles and chains

Die, die by the axe
Die, die by the flames

Welcome to Rotting Hill - a realm of carnivores
Guided by the stench an odour that marks the trail
Sunrise over Rotting Hill - cursed throughout centuries
Beasts shall unite on Rotting Hill

Once a beast now a prey
Hangman's law, join your ghosts

Lost your limbs piece by piece
Lost your head left to rot

Welcome to Rotting Hill - a realm of carnivores
Guided by the stench an odour that marks the trail
Sunrise over Rotting Hill - cursed throughout centuries
Beasts shall unite on Rotting Hill
