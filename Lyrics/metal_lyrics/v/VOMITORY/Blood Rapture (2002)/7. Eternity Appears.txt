[Music: T Gustafsson, Rundqvist]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist]

Trapped behind enemy lines
Alone crawling through mine fields
A breath of pain, heartbeats echoes
Blood streams, the mind screams in panic
Flesh ripped apart, skin boils in pain
Where bullets has eaten the flesh
Skin destroyed by barbwire
Leaves a trail of blood

The last second alive
Last for an eternity

Wounded in the flesh
Intestines start to fall out
Sound of enemies approach
Panic, no escape from death
Isolated from the others
No help is near
Take as many enemies
Along when death approach

The last second alive
Last for an eternity

An endless suffering
Death will appear
Left in enemies control
A bullet eats through the head

The last second alive
Last for an eternity
