[Music: T Gustafsson]
[Lyrics: Dalegren]

A relic of tyranny
Worship and sanctuary
Love and oppression
Guided by a sign
A sign of suffering
Enter paradise

Kiss the cross
Tasting salvation
The holy semen
Thank you Master

Saviour of souls
Feeble minded
Enslaved by birth
See the truth
See the lies
The buried won't tell

Receive the blessing
Father to daughter
Chased by demons
An acid mayhem
Spellbound by fear
Bury your blood

Kiss the cross
Tasting salvation
The holy semen
Thank you Master
