Eternal Trail Of Corpses
Fallen empires, funeral world
Human's supremacy, forgotten dreams
From chaos, the world was born

World disorder, reign in anarchy
Total carnage, cannibalised ferocity
From chaos, the world will die

An eternal trail of corpses

Dissident minds, past the edge of sanity
Worldwide plague, religious rape
All in gods name, a world in suffering

An eternal trail of corpses
An eternal trail of corpses

Final desecration, human annihilation
Fanatic warriors, glory through suicide
All in God's name, the world is dead
