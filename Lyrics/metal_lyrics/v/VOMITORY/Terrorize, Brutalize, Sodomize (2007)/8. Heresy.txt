Undesirable obligations against ideologies unworthy recognition
From within the eyes of the self claimed superior rulers

Traitors born traitors, slay them at birth
Baptise the sinners, in their own blood
Expendable bodies, screaming for death
Suffer in silence, one final war

Glorified lunacy sweeps weaker minds control
Mandatory means of violence words from greatness already doomed

Mournful screams threaten to silence hatred hidden from outside eyes
Visions obsolete slowly dying prays answered with silence

Ancient spiritual tormentor consumes fear no longer
Immortality abandoned by faith as mortals they bleed

World in disorder brought into chaos
Exterminate those, fallen from grace
Insanity rules, chaos will rise
Uncontrolled conflicts, panic attacks
War declarations, the holy war starts
Religious world war, hypnotized mass
Charge for glory, die for honour
Global insanity, world wide collapse
