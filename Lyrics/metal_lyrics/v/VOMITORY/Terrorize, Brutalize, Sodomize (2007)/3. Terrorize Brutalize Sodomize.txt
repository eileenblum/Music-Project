Blackened mind
Obscurity concealed
Compulsive urge to slay
Upon command from powers deep within

Staring into the eyes of death
Totally paralysed
Hyperventilating, grasping for air
Anticipated pain already so real
A fear beyond all fears

Morning star, cock and hate ? my weapons of choice
Fueled by rage, hatred and insanity
No regrets, no compassion nor mercy
Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize

Piercing hooks, livid skin
Stretches until bursting
Bludgeon frenzy, nothing to spare
Ball of iron hits the skull
Head feels like exploding
A pain beyond all pain

Stripped off
Bound in chains
Covered in wounds
No escape

Burying your face in the dirt
Unleashing the bestial lust
Unveiling the pit of pleasure
Screams cut like razors
Blood and semen unite
Humiliation complete

Morning star, cock and hate ? my weapons of choice
Fueled by rage, hatred and insanity
No regrets, no compassion nor mercy
Terrorize Brutalize Sodomize
