Carnal perversity, faith of a morbid
Molested body decorated in wounds
Rotten cadaver, sadistic butcher
A macabre operation in flesh

Consumed in blind rage, gorge on the flesh
In pools of entrails, a smile on the face
All skin ripped off, butchered alive
A mouthful of flesh, a cannibal's feast

Ravage torso, rancid intestines
A flesh barbed of all skin
Septic guts, swollen remains
They reek of rot while I eat

Human collection, maimed of all life
Slicing the flesh from the bones
Mangled skin, pure satisfaction
The butcher art divine

Drenched in pus, covered in blood
Stabbing insanely again
Victory's mine, meat on the plate
Carving through entrails again

Possessed, by the taste of human flesh
Hungry again, a repulsive urge to slay
Meat obsessed, carving another slaughtered body
Master at my bloody art

Consumed in blind rage, gorge on the flesh
In pools of entrails, a smile on the face
All skin ripped off, butchered alive
A mouthful of flesh, a cannibal's feast
