Onward they march
With vengeance in mind
A destiny of pain
Reflecting their manipulated minds

A prophecy ignored
Damnation closing in

Enslaved by the war
Charge in remorse
Into a future unfold
Possessed by the glory of war
Fragments untold
Chaos justified
Holding no hope
Scattered in no mans land

Eternal resentment
Life slips away
The world grows insane
In trenches soldiers name engraved
Awaiting in silence
Preparing to die
Death now approaching
No chance for redemption

Can't escape from faith
Extinction drawing near
Denied mortality
Leaving life behind
