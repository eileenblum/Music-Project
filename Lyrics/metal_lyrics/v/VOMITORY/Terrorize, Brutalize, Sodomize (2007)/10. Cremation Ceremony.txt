Body all limp, drooling from drugs
Your life's now in my hands
Morbid visions lead my way
A grotesque crusade through guts
Collection of bodies soon complete
One final victim, you're that chosen one

As I drag your tortured body
You try to crawl for the door
Instinctively my pickaxe
Nails your hand to the floor
Screams for mercy, joyfully ignored
Tremendous pain, ecstatic rush
Carving the sentenced flesh

My morgue, my palace, my kingdom of fire
Destined to burn in my funeral pyre

Devoured in the cremation ceremony
Devoured in the cremation ceremony

Summon the beast within
Carnage without end
A salute to malevolence
Victim of sadistic lust
Cut in half by the waist
Human torso overkill
Consumed in ravishing flames
