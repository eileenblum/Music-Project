Scavenging The Slaughtered
Bursting skin, crawling maggots
Feasting in dismembered remains
Human flesh painted in scars
Infected cuts, razors grind

Massive violent slaughter art
Penetrate through rotten skin
Unrestrained obsession for blood
Gory rituals, killing spree

Empty eyes, extinguished for eternity
Drained from life, without identity
Murdered without remorse or pity
Human killing pleasure, slaughter insanity

Sadistic feast in bloodless flesh
Crawling maggots born to eat
Rotten skin, bones decay
Hair nails teeth all that remain

Empty eyes, extinguished for eternity
Drained from life, without identity
Murdered without remorse or pity
Human killing pleasure, slaughter insanity
