Depraved human waste, conquered crawling maggots
Bow for infinity, to an invisible god
Soldiers of sin, release forgotten curses
Hunt for blood, a war will cleanse humanity

Once a majestic place, now filled with rotten corpses
Whispers from the dead, whispers from the dead

God of suffering
God of massacre
God of hate
God of death

Slay the sinners, slay their infected souls
A human plague, soon erased from history
Corrupted minds, controls with self created fear
Lies of paradise, of eternal salvation

Once a majestic place, now filled with rotten corpses
Whispers from the dead, whispers from the dead

God of suffering
God of massacre
God of hate
God of death
