[Music: T Gustafsson]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist, Dalegren]

Echoes of cannons, fading away, silence finally conquers
Field in red, consuming life, where death took command
Covered in remains of scattered companions, aftermath of war
Blinded by victory, a battle defeated, where is the honour

Soldiers scream for mercy, when they are trapped
In machinegun massacre

Soldiers path, filled with blood, casualties, of war

Charge against the enemy through a bullet rain
Soldiers defleshed in a massive attack

Decapitated bodies, soldiers torn apart
Mourning the loss, in a bloodbath

Soldiers path, filled with blood, casualties, of war
