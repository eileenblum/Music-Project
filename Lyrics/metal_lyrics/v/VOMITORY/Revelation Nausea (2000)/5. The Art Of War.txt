[Music: T Gustavsson, Rundqvist]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist]

Putrefied corpse, aftermath of war from time immorial
Cadaverous odour rapes through every breath mankind's sympathy
Perpetrators grow rapidly without pity
Armies projected, brainwashed, thoroughly gone through from birth

Tools against enemy alliances
Troops in thousands fire at will
Troops in thousands charge

Carcass in fire screams uninterruptedly in silence
Napalm falls, burns all in sight, enemies' death all that counts
Suffocated mutilated remains, exterminated through fire
They stop breathing, screams for mercy one last time

Tools against enemy alliances
Troops in thousands fire at will
Troops in thousands

Extinction, the art of war

Through war, discriminatory declarations against enemies' ideal
Against dissident opponents' assessments tanks will strike
In the darkest of darkness, will the remains,
Of the enemies putrefied corpse in silence rest
