[Music: T Gustafsson]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist]

From time bygone, until the end of now
Without conscious, a journey through blood
No compassion, death a consistent reality
March through blood, no end in sight

No mercy left, a nightmare for the affected ones
Mind unconscious, like predators hunger for blood

Soldiers, march towards battle
They invade, when napalm falls like burning rain
Like vultures, from above
The battlefield, covered in blood

When napalm, fills their lungs
A morbid taste, of reality
Their chemical massive attack, to exterminate
A stench of death, that will never disappear

Critical, a word that can not describe
Under clouds of blood, they died
