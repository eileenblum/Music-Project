[Music &amp; Lyrics: Rundqvist]

Silence, only silence is real
Ashes leaves a trace of something that once were
The end of a new beginning
The last and final chapter of humans' history erased

No sounds no movements
There's no evidence of existence
From threat of extermination
To a total wipe out, mankind has forever died

The holocaust

Scentless trails fills the emptiness with invisible presence
A new beginning without origin a future without hope
Emptiness and darkness surrounds everything
Voices of lost soul's the only sound
The last sign of civilisation
Like shades disguised in darkness
When their resurrection has been denied
Godless they slowly being erased

When darkness encloses the beginning
When darkness encloses the end
The end of a new beginning
The last and final chapter of humans' history erased

The holocaust
