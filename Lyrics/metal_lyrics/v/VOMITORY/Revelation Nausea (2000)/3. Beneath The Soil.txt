[Music: T Gustafsson]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist, Dalegren]

Beyond redemption lost in lunacy
A world in chaos, pain control your thoughts
Self control dwells in a distant reality
Suffer for your last breath

Blood forces through your veins
Thoughts shattered into incomprehensible
Air supply slowly languish away
Panic grasp the soul with fear

The final sleep approach, do you see the light
That cleanse for your soul, I am your master above

Awake but not completely conscious
Where darkness suffocates your soul
The mental strain cause of the cardiac death
Slowly descending on the voyage beneath the soil

The final sleep approach, do you see the light
That cleanse for your soul, I am your master above
