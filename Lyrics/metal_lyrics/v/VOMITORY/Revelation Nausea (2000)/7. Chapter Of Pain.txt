[Music: T Gustafsson]
[Lyrics: Rundqvist, Dalegren]

Ancient past in reverse, the future dies through renewal
Evil grows back again, unaffected by time

Far from the light, behind the shadows
Through the ashes of hate
Cycles divine or cursed by mankind
Genetic disease a mental slavery
A chapter of pain

The immense darkness suffocates the narrow light of hope
Unleashing a malevolent creation made by mankind

An endless apocalypse a symphony of melancholy
Accompanied by forces of chaos, the creation of the end

Future disappears in darkness, hate kills hate
In an explosion of rage, darkness destroys itself

Far from the light, behind the shadows
Through the ashes of hate
Cycles divine or cursed by mankind
Genetic disease a mental slavery
A chapter of pain
