Confession of the wicked a tormented screaming soul
A fallen warrior abandoned by his god
Terrorized for centuries a screaming lunatic
Concealed in darkness since time bygone

Outcast, heretic, liars

Suffer those that will not speak
Suffer those that dare not speak
Slaughter those that disagree
Slaughter those that can not see

Emptiness, suffering, sacrifice

Mesmerized in thousands religious hypocrisy
The serpent whispers lies of paradise
No place for unbelievers unloyal to the truth
Neverending fire in the pits of hell
