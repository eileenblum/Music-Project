Into rotten carcasses
A ravage through the flesh
Endless skin dismemberment
A work in guts and blood

A masterpiece of morbid surgery
Mutilated corpses destroyed once again

Blood starts to coagulate
Remove the severed bodies
Replace the broken limbs
Experiments in guts and blood

Creations spawned from suffering
The dead are now the living
Brought back to life
Rebirth of the grotesque

A masterpiece of morbid surgery
Mutilated corpses destroyed once again
