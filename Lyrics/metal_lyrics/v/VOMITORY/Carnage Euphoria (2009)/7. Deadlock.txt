A horizon shredded by thousands of lights
Cascades of fire eat through the flesh
Obliteration of the enemies life
Screams of those dying fills the night

Decomposing entrails, blood and skin
Carnal extermination

Abandoned deep behind enemy lines
Charging blind through foreign terrain
Hunting shadows that crawls in the night
Trapped in this realm of violence and pain

Silent assassin lurks in the air
Chemical substances fills every breath
Blood start to boil lungs just collapse
Crawling forward while melting away

Decomposing entrails, blood and skin
Carnal extermination
