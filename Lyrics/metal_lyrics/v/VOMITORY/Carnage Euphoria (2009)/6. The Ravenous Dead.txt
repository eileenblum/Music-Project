Infected creatures spawn from the graves
Crawling lifeless they need to feed
The smell of corpse drives their minds insane
Defilement of graves nocturnal feast in blood

They will rise

Beneath the buried secrets will reveal
Dark incantations of the cannibal art
They vomit entrails over those once dead
Those fallen from grace buried to die

They will rise

The buried will rise
Through the testimonies of time
A final breath of hate
Unleash the undead force

Forgotten powers of the darker art appear
Chambers sealed opens up with blood
Curses never told with human tongues
A final desecration of their legacy

They will rise

The buried will rise
Through the testimonies of time
A final breath of hate
Unleash the undead force
