Gutted slaughtered skinned alive - flesh and blood in a human pile
No remorse a killing spree - murder will set the mind free

Falling deep into the dark
A morbid way to end a life
Suffocate inside a corpse
Possessed

Need the blood for suicide - a hunger never satisfied
Feasting on dismembered flesh - a morbid way of death

Falling deep into the dark
A morbid way to end a life
Suffocate inside a corpse
Possessed

Entrails ripped and cast aside - remove remaining body parts
Crawl inside the empty skin - force the flesh to fit within

Falling deep into the dark
A morbid way to end a life
Suffocate inside a corpse
Possessed
