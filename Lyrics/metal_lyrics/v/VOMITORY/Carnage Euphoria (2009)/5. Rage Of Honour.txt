Running through trenches as bombrain falls - got to get out of this rotten hole
Bodies in piles to my left, to my right - doomed to go down, no escape in sight
Is this the way it will end?

The sweet taste of revenge
Awakes my lust to kill
Boiling fury bursting out
Rage of honour

Step in the tank, ready to strike - time to avenge, run for your lives
None will be spared, you're all gonna die - your defeat, all that remains

This iron reaper has come for your release
A feast in blood
Blast

Persecution - execution
Demolition - annihilation
Devastation - exterminate them
Blast them to eternity

Human shrapnel light the sky red - under clouds of blood, one thousand men dead
Silence and death now all that is true - in this battlefield rendezvous

The sweet taste of revenge
Awakes my lust to kill
Boiling fury bursting out
Rage of honour
