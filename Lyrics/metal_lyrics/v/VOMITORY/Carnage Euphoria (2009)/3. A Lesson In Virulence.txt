Erased into nothingness, escaping the memories
A vast pain slowly consumes, regurgitated intestines erupts

Genetic invention created from science
Lethal injection, infection that lives inside blood

Covered in virus, evolutions solution
Unstoppable vision, genocide the price to pay

Blood covered satisfaction the cremation aftermath
Massacred in vain, taunted death revealed
Human body forge, science painful nature
Studies of the objects life, the art of torture

Erased into nothingness, escaping the memories
A vast pain slowly consumes, regurgitated intestines erupts

An end to all things, in the presence of hate
The path of blood, a never ending apocalypse

Erased into nothingness, escaping the memories
A vast pain slowly consumes, regurgitated intestines erupts
