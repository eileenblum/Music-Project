A hellhole of madness, within the fortress
Of love once lost, hidden from sight by the one
Shackled by unholy love
Ripped from the world by the great deceiver

Beaten and scarred, used for breeding
His vile spawn, enslaved by his twisted will

And nowhere to be found, insanity grows

When in darkness alone
Biting on fingers so blood starts to flow
Clawling at eyes in frantic convulsions
Pulling out the teeth and piercing the skin
Psychotic actions from a psychotic mind
Deranged emotions with blood on his mind
Voices screams inside the insane
Embrace the pain

A burning bloodthirst, for his bloodline
Butchered daughters, king of torture

Shackled by unholy love
Ripped from the world by the great deceiver

And nowhere to be found, insanity grows
