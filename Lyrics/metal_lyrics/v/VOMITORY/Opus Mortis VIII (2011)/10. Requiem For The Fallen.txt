Onward across the battleground
Leave the safety of the trenches behind
No turning back aim for glory
Charging, fight for honour and pride
Your mortality is at stake
Penalty for treason is death

From deep within the core, through the eyes of death
Begging to some god, for your miserable life

A requiem for the fallen those forever lost
To forever vanish, to forever rot

A day where pride is now forgotten
Dark reflections of life appear
Lunacy your only companion
Memories of those who fell
Left behind to stay alive
Buried alone once again

From deep within the core, through the eyes of death
Begging to some god, for your miserable life

This is where your life ends!
