Genetic surgery, experiments performed in the shadows
Molested body parts stitched into a new creation

Cascades of pus squished out of septic intestines
Guts and blood spilled all over

A morbid wisdom of the human anatomy
The evolution of torture, a science to perfect the art
The need to cause pain, the need to kill
Forward into a world of pain

Forward into a world of pain

Remove the skin without causing death
Barbwire keep the flesh in position

With gasoline, soak the bleeding remains
For the final stage, torch what's left to die

A morbid wisdom of the human anatomy
The evolution of torture, a science to perfect the art
The need to cause pain, the need to kill
Forward into a world of pain

Forward into a world of pain
