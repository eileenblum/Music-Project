Welcome to the end of the line, to were your pain begins
Experiments beyond your sickest dreams, we will bleed your race

Will your body withstand the torture
When your body is burned and maimed
Will your soul escape your mind
When the unborn is ripped from your womb

Exposed to the freezing cold, bodies naked in winter snow
The remove both arms and legs, gaze upon your limbless torso
Slashed into pieces by needle wounds, through every internal organ
Blood seeps from the bodies, from lacerated flesh

A laboratory conceived in hell, harvester of death
No conscience, no compassion, no humanity to spare

Chemicals injected into the skin, virus infection grows inside
Putrid bodies cast aside, government controlled genocide
Systematic killing of the weak, mass surgery killing spree

A laboratory conceived in hell, harvester of death
No conscience, no compassion, no humanity to spare

Darkness, once your life has drained, fall into eternal sleep
Experiments beyond your sickest dreams, your race is no more
