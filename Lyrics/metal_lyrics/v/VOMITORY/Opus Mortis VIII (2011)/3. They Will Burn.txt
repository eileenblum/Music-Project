Intrepid soldiers ready to cleanse
New battle lines are drawn
Contortion of their feeble minds
For both sides failure is doom

Profane memories of a bleeding world
The battle of faith still rages
Thousands slaughtered, thousands slain
A testament written in blood

They will bleed, They will suffer
In the flames of judgement they will burn
They will bleed, They will suffer
In the flames of judgement they will burn

In the end they are all alone
Enslaved under ancient oaths

They will bleed, They will suffer
In the flames of judgement they will burn
They will bleed, They will suffer
In the flames of judgement they will burn
