Crawling through a wall of flesh
A path of shattered bodies
Across a decomposing field
Camouflaged in human blood

Surrounded by an endless chaos
Hiding under fallen corpses
The true power of destruction
Screams of panic fills the air

Knee deep in blood, let no one survive
There's no escape, for those left behind
Suffer, vengeance without mercy
Carnage, you're all gonna die

Bullets eat through skin and bone
In agony the body stop to work
A final heartbeat
Carnal shutdown

Haunted by machinegun fire
Escape through foreing terrain
Taste the blood, it fills the lungs
Every breath filled with pain
