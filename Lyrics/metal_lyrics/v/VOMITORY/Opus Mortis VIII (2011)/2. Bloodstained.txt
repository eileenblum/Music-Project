Open up your eyes you will never win this war
A god glorified by extreme aggressions
Military campaings addressed in his name
Object of worship that creates a violent conflict

Victory achieved by a mandatory faith
Religious fundamental aspects of war
Psychological hierarchy of domination
Through some inexplicable divine perception

Killing seek for blood all in his name
Omniscient originator of pain
Sacrifice your faith sacrifice your son
Nail him to a cross to save your souls again

Waging war, against those, who disobey
Gods disciple, spilling blood, human sins
Ancient war, impose our will, genocide
Victorious, bloodstained, soldiers of God
