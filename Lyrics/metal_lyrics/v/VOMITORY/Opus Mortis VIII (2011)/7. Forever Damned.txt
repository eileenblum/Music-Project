From concealment risen, by ritual recitation
Black magical words, to finalize the incantation
Warlocks standing hand in hand, chanting blasphemous forbidden names
Opening the ancient gates, bring forth the infernal fiend

Mankind forever damned
Forever damned

Darkness falls upon the earth, the sun will never shine again
From a place of pain and turmoil, inhabitant of hell arise

Mankind forever damned
Forever damned

Sinners suffer for eternity, punishment reclaimed in blood
Lower world of the cursed, the dead will rise again
A severe affliction, extinction closin in

Mankind forever damned
Forever damned
