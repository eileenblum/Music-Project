Endless night
Blood on mouth
Bloodred moon
At the sky
Forest around us
Prime home
Of cursed souls

Black hateful metal

Legions of evil
Heirs to the tradition
Have risen forever
To conquer
And fight
In the name of the true one

Black hateful metal

Our flame
Of eternal fight
Will never vanish
Burning hot in hearts
And dark minds
It reign our
Deeds

Black hateful metal

Insanity and blood
We are heading
Towards victory
Our weapons
War and suffer
In our minds
Dwells the fight

Black hateful metal

Walking among the ruins
Of this world we
Will be proud
It's our work of art!

Black hateful metal
