Yes, It is a Dark Dream,
and coldful hatred hidden behind it...
I'm still dreaming,
I've been getting stronger,
because of this dream for centuries...
My nocturnal vision I realise in your world,
when the killes sun tries to hide...
We are still fighting gods are with us!
I'm Dreaming.
Dream about power of the white race,
Dream about superiority of the master on the icy thrones.
The Black Forest welcomes me
as a wolf hungry for the blood...
He welcomes me to dream in him
Weaves me up by the silver's moon dream.
