Born because of Darkness
Full of primitive evil,
We life again.

United by hatred,
We go hurting the weak
We kill enemies - purify the soul.

Our existences are hymns to the glory of Darkness
We ride to wings of Pagan storm
The Moon leads us.

When we fight, we do it to
take the revenge for our brother killed
in the sunshine

We are not mortal...
We've always lived in Darkness!
We are not weak...
Now united we pay the homage
to paganism and our existences!
