We chopped by swords!
To making the bloody feast for wolfs 
Blades played the steal song
In foreigns helmets
And the wolfs had full of meat
And a raven called the raven

We chopped by swords!
We wielded the spears high
Warriors fell often
Death collected the bloody harvest
The black raven flew 
In the feast again

We chopped by swords!
Valkyries worshipped us
When we send for Odin
Valiants warrior
Our wispy arrows
Sang a mournful song
And they played blades song in the discs
We chopped by swords!
I donât suppose that I died so quickly
I donât carre about meaning
Anybody canât redeem your fate
Your destiny canât let you, oh! How
Sweet are your horns with honey
In divineValhallaâs of Odin!

We chopped by swords!
Valiant donât afraid a cold of death
So I donât fear all
I part gladly with you
And serve to a divine feast
My life passed away, so I smile and die
Hail Odin!
