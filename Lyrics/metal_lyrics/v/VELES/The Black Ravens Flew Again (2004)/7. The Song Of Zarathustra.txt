Human! Can you hear?
What's ringing of southern silence up?

- I slept I slept
- I wake up from the deeply dreams of silence
- The world - Pile of depth

Deeper nor daydream, when you think of dream

- The pain - king of depth
- But - more than pain - is bliss which sobs deeper
- Die - the pain said
- The bliss sobs for eternal life

The eternity want to without bottom, without bottom!

[Lyrics by Friedrich Nietzsche]
