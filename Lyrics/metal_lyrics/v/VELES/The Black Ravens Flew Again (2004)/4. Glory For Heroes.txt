The woodland silenceâs sweeping the warriors
Desperate screamâs tailing away
Then they hit in the cauldrons
The martial song has rung!

Charging valiantly
Among the way full of death
They befell the warrior to an enemy
Standing the bloody fight
Whichâs very furious

In silence among the voices
And dying heroes
With sword in his hands he hits
Excites to fight, forgetting
About yourself the ancient warrior

An anger burns eyes
The fighting screamâs sweeping him
They donât hear anything donât see anything
Heâs citing and killing heâs avenging
Cracking up among the enemies

A burstâs panting a screams extracts
A mouth calling ghost about help
Throwing curses heâs still murdering
Bloody comrades fall down
At foot bloody sword ejects from hands

Valkyries garb him
Hiking to gate of Valhalla
For him the battle finished
Heâll sit among heroes
In hall of Odin!
Victory of Valhalla glory for heroes!
