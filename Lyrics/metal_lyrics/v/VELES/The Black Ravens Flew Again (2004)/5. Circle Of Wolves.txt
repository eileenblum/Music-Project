I was born in frosty country
Among eternal silence
I hiked among sorrow
Too dark, too hateful
A cold, frosty moonâs my only brother

The perennial hikeâs still continuing
The northâs wind with me
Among darkness and dreams
Through mountains cover by snow
Empty, there freezed the sun! silenceâ¦

Among the foggy forests
All intervals the darkness hate
My cold soul of wolfâs continuing
Iâm leading to the common circule
Scream of wolfâs penetrating me among the fog

Mighty attack horde of wolfs
The fire of revengeâs like cyclone
Among the sleeping forest
My interval heritage
Got you in wings of wind
