The light of lightning is a sign for us
We must go to the road of battle
For the fathers world transfer the blood
It cleans the enemiesâs sin
The sunny cross leads us
A fighting branch holds a guard 
The last burst the last scream
A sword shines on it the blood sign

The loyalty for country
This is the most important thing
You rise your head with an honour
With a dignity you must go ahead to death

An honourâs the blood, the honourâs the death
The death for our a cleaning race
The fight of time calls us
Weâre defenders our earth and its holy laws
For ages across this land
A fighting whirl transfered it
So you catch the sword and enemies death
And sign every new day
