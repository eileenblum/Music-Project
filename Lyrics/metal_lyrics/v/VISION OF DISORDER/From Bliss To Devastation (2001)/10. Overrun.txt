This is killing me,
Rips me inside and out.
They talking, they talking,
On how I wore you out.

[Chorus:]
I've been overrun
Holding on too long.
So Sorry that I couldn't be the person,
You wanted me to be.

Now we're black and white.
Share from the other side.
You crying, you crying.
You should have known from the start.

[Chorus:]
I've been overrun
Holding on too long.
So Sorry that I couldn't be the person,
You wanted me to be.

Burn the memories.
Photograph to flames.
You so lonely tonight.

[Chorus:]
I've been overrun
Holding on too long.
So Sorry that I couldn't be the person,
You wanted me to be.

All these years have been wasted.
Rip it out.
