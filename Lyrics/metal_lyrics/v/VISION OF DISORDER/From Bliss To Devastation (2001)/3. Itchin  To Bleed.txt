I had a reason but you know
That I will give it away.
Another morning just another fucking
Kick in the face.
You all been trying just to rape me
Of the things that I got.
Want to test me, Don't test me.

[Chorus:]
I'll bash the walls out nightly
Cause i've been itchin' to bleed.
Yeah Jesus oh blessed Jesus.
When you been there for me.

[Verse Repeats]
Want justice, here is justice.

[Chorus:]
I'll bash the walls out nightly
Cause i've been itchin' to bleed.
Yeah Jesus oh blessed Jesus.
When you been there for me.

Won't you give me a reason
To keep living.
In this sadness.

You've been taking over.
Man you should have seen.
You've been taking over.
I believe...

[Chorus:]
I'll bash the walls out nightly
Cause i've been itchin' to bleed.
Yeah Jesus oh blessed Jesus.
When you been there for me.

I've been so down.
Waste me.
