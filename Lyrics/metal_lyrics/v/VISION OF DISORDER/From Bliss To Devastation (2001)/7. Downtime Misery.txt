I want to hang me from the bedroom walls.
I often tell it to God.
I lost myself among the arizona sun.
Only find that there is no one.

[Chorus:]
I've been ripping myself into pieces.
It's been so fucking long since I was unashamed.

I want to crawl into the closet hole.
I gotta face it alone.
I want to hear the sound of the shotgun blast.
As i'm delivered to the black.

[Chorus:]
I've been ripping myself into pieces.
It's been so fucking long since I was unashamed.

Out in my car, took it too far.
Ran from the lady.

Now I'll kick out my teeth.
Lose all my sleep.

Been down in crazy.

Ran out of time,
Ran out of lies,
I'll be fine.

[Chorus:]
I've been ripping myself into pieces.
It's been so fucking long since I was unashamed.
