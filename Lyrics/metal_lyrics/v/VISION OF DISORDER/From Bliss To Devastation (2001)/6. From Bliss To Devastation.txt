Heaven help me cause i'm out of my mind.
Heaven help me cause i'm losing the fight.
Low grey clouds with November's chill.
Count all the cards and i'm down for the kill.

[Chorus:]
Girl dead in the back of her car.
Suspect out and still living large.

Heaven help me cause i'm out on my own.
Heaven help me cause i'm taking the throne.
Low half moon by the waterside.
Off shore breeze. No one will hear you cry.

[Chorus:]
Girl dead in the back of her car.
Suspect out and still living large.

Welcome to this hell.

And if I don't get home tonight.
I'm lost on the strange road.
And if I see rain tonight.
If I see rain...

Fuck tomorrow.
