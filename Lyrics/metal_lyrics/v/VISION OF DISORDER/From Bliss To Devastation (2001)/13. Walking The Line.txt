You walk under twilight.
Reborn into moonlight.
So easily we're chosen.
So easily unwoven.

Jesus came that morning.
Jesus gave no warning.
I feel strange.
I don't remember anything.

[Chorus:]
I've been walking the line.

Jesus came that morning.
Jesus gave no warning.
I feel strange.
I don't remember anything.

[Chorus:]
I've been walking the line.

We all transcend,
To a bitter end.
To silent grooves.

To other lives,
Under skies of granite stone.
