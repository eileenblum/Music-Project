I've been sold.
Now i'm feeling the squeeze.

Welcome to this hell.
Nothing's ever well.
How it's always been complicated.
All up in the zone,
Never been alone,
Well you unfulfilled.

[Chorus:]
To all you living in the shadows.
You can run but you sure can't hide.
All you waiting for someone to rely on.

I've been cold.
Now i'm feeling the heat.

All up in the scene.
Living on that dream.

Kid so creative.

Still living the lie.
Thorn up in your side.
Well you unfulfilled.

[Chorus:]
To all you living in the shadows.
You can run but you sure can't hide.
All you waiting for someone to rely on.

Life is a drag.

[Chorus:]
To all you living in the shadows.
You can run but you sure can't hide.
All you waiting for someone to rely on.

Regurgitate - suck up the shit
Cause it's the only way you'll get in.
Living life on your knees.
It's the only way you'll please...
