Strung out all the time and I never look old.
Bent out of my head I gotta get on the phone.
Downtime is gone and i've been living obscene.
Where I lay my head I know i'll always be free.

I never really got.

[Chorus:]
Head over heels.
I ran.
Without you i'm all over.

Out of my head.
You take up all my time I never really get rest.
Once your gone you know you can never come back.
Smoke up all the shit put you back on track.

[Chorus:]
Head over heels.
I ran.
Without you i'm all over.

Tired strung out pressured
Is all that I feel.

Should've medicated after all these years.
For what reason.

Head full of acid and the highway is wide.
Follow blurry headlights into the night.
Once you got out you really got on your own.
I blew my head out man now I got no place to go.

[Chorus:]
Head over heels.
I ran.
Without you i'm all over.
