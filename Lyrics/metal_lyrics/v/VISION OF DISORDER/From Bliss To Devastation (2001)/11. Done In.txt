Lunatics we put the slit on the wrists
Open up your eyes.

There is no sense in denying
The places you're hiding
One day be sealing your fate.
To kill.

[Pre-Chorus:]
All the things you've done
Put you on the run.
Just about to do you in.

[Chorus:]
I said there's nothing for free.

Leave this place,
Without a single trace.
The blood between your thighs...

I chop up the mirror
Huddled in bathrooms
Awaken under the strangest of sheets.
The guilt.

[Pre-Chorus:]
All the things you've done
Put you on the run.
Just about to do you in.

[Chorus:]
I said there's nothing for free.

Dream innocence.
Watch it baby.
You've been driving the train.

[Chorus:]
I said there's nothing for free.
