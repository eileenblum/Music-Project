Awake to mindless raping.
Life is going by.

Now days are complicated,
Why to be so jaded.
Every single mother-fucker seems to want a piece.
I'll shed my skin.

[Chorus:]
No shame.
Get paid.
You know your sun is shining.

I don't keep my mind on cocaine.
Why be so jaded.
Every single mother-fucker seems to want a piece.

Now I got my feet back on the ground.
Got my head out of the clouds.
Every single shallow person wants a chance to speak.
I'll shed my skin.

[Chorus:]
No shame.
Get paid.
You know your sun is shining.

I've got a taste to defeat you.
You better watch your step
I'm gonna beat you.
I'll put you through what i've been through.
So what's up.

[Chorus:]
No shame.
Get paid.
You know your sun is shining.

Give me the shot.
