I felt remorse, I felt disgust. 
I saw your face, of burning rust. 
Upon That highway, I met my god. 
On that highway, that took my life. 
[Chorus:] We will destroy visions of our demise. 
We thought to take. There was no pain, 
for words I saw, for words I felt. 
I saw the face, but not the name. 
I knew the name. I felt disgrace. 
[Chorus:] Jesus Please, this windshield took me away from my family. 
I don't want you. I don't need you. 
Decide my fuckin' fate now 
and no one can tell me a place 
where I fucking belong. 
I'm gonna kill you. 
I'm gonna kill me. 
Don't tell me a way to in this life, 
My pain in my life was the one thing I'll never forget. 
Just end this. Just take me away from this place. 
I tend to bleed, there was no pain, 
there was no time. 
Inside our fate. 
We fought the line 
yellow, red, and yellow died. 
This was my pain 
[Chorus:] Jesus please, windshield.
