Dangerous roads unravel inside of me. 
I feel so hollow, 
The darkest pills I've swallowed. 
God won't you take me. 
I've got to get myself away, 
in the shadows I'll always be 
hidden from the eyes that stare, 
come and take a chance if you dare. 
Broken years and shattering eyes, 
scars that keep me alive. 
A lesson lost is a lesson learned, 
and in the end, we all burn. 
The strength of one's spine is all in the eyes... 
I tear my brain out endlessly, 
searching for something that will never be. 
No rest, never to expect something of this world, 
'cause this world owes me nothing. 
Submission. 
What you deserve is what you will get in the end 
No handouts. 
All your receiving in what you've given to me!
