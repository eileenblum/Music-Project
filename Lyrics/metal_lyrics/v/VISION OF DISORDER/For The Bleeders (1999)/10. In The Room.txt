dont play, this is your ending 
dont you see, cant someone help me? 
broken body now i piss out a machine gun..well 
the inside 
something inside has died 
it feels like death in my side 
and you know what you did, what you changed, what you broke 
hope you find your descrete jesus a pope 
i sleep alone at night, tell myself everythings alright 
whenever you wonder (holler) (it opens) 
about you ive lost it (i love you) shine 
bullshit the precious scandal 
time to change out of anger 
open up the fans and you give me away, i said 
i said you open up to me 
now i roll back my shell 
and i love these deserts even? 
and you know what you did, what you changed, what you broke 
hope you find your discrete jesus a pope 
wont something set me free.
