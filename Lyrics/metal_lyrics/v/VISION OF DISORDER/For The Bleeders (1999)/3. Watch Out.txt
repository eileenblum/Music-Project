Watch Out! 
Life's hard, 
be strong, 
reform 
your mind to be pure, 
Inspect your action. 
Unpredictable is this life that we all lead, 
it's our right, 
Indestructible a fallacy, 
indestructible denied 
We are all but fractions of society... 
hypocrisy... 
democracy... 
Down...Up 
Kicked in 
Burnt out, 
forced out without cause. 
Please try hard and fight your way through this life, 
just remember what I've said.
