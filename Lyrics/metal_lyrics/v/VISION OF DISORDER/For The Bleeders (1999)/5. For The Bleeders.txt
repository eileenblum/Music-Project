Bleed......for what I've done.
And I'll never forgive myself for what Ive done.
And she'll know that I'll bleed......bleed
Know now the choice.
And crawl upon the ground.
A man is now vagrant.
Girl, why did you bleed? Bleed......
Don't be shallow......Repent, Repent
Don't be shallow......Repent, Repent
Don't be shallow......Repent, Repent
Don't be shallow......Repent, Repent
