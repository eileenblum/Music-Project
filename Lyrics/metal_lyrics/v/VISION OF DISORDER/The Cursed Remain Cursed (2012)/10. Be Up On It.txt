You gotta be up on it, you gotta lean up on it, you gotta feed upon it, give me some give me more. 
You gotta be up on it, you gotta lean up on it, you gotta feed upon it, give me some give me more.
You say internalize it, I should minimize it, I should be forever indebted to this change. 
Oh lover, your eyes cast the light, as the shadows collapse
You make it all go away as I'm swallowed, I feel itâs not quite the same. 1,2,3,4!
You gotta be up on it, you gotta lean up on it, you gotta feed upon it, give me some give me more. 
You gotta be up on it, you gotta lean up on it, you gotta feed upon it, give me some give me more.
I gotta justify it, I gotta rectify it, I gotta come clean with the sickness inside of me.
You make it all go away as I'm swallowed, I feel its not quite the same, its not the same.
In your eyes I see the change in you, wonât be long till were through. 
Heartbreaker baby , keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down
Your eyes, so misleading, your lies so deceiving, you lied, you could never believe in me.  How long.....   
You make it all go away as I'm swallowed, I feel itâs not quite the same.
In your eyes I see the change in you, wont be long till were through. 
heartbreaker baby , keep it down..... 1, 2, Fuck you!
You gotta be up on it, you gotta lean up on it, you gotta feed upon it, give me some give me more. 
You gotta be up on it, you gotta lean up on it, you gotta feed upon it, give me some give me more.
You gotta be up on it, you gotta lean up on it, you gotta feed upon it, give me some give me more. 
You gotta be up on it, you gotta lean up on it, you gotta feed upon it, give me some give me more.
