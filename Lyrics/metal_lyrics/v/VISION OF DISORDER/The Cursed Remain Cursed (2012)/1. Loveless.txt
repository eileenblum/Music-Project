Looking in the mirror.
It's always such a mess, don't cry to me about your problems.
Save it

I've got my own.
Arms around you, this will be where you meet your end.
I've got my own.
Play the victim the last card in a loosing hand.
And now you know.
Never to doubt me, you owe me the respect.
And now you know, can't crush the kingdom and victory goes.

In the throes of the misery.
I would swear that I'd have my revenge.

Struggle to make a living, it puts me to the test.
The world around you crumbles - fuck your troubles.

I got my own.
Walls around you to crush with a busted hand.
I got my own.
Dedication - won't move from where I stand.
And now you know.
They'll undermine you, pushed down to the ground below.
And now you know.
Can't crush the kingdom and victory goes.

In the throes of the misery.
I would swear that I'd have my revenge.
And at the cross roads of insanity.
We'll be loveless until the end.

It's overrated
These empty lives we strive for, this endless grind.
It's overrated
This blood and sweat we die for - this sacrifice.
Has left me loveless.

In the throes of the misery.
I would swear that I'd have my revenge.
And at the cross roads of insanity.
We'll be loveless until the end.

No to the change, in the end we will break, these cycles of hate.
And in the end they took it all away, the stolen lives and a shallow grave.
The promises they would never make, just lie after lie.

Has left me loveless - These empty lives we strive for.
This blood and sweat we die for - until the end this sacrifice.
It's overrated...
