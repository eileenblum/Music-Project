She will sleep a thousand centuries, in a silence so deep; 
she will sleep a thousand centuries, in a silence so deep, that even death may perish.  
There is no hope in the bottle, this system is destined to fail. 
There is no faith, no escape to be swallowed, a vision of an endless hell. 
You want a, you want a confrontation, than on those words you will choke.
Her eyes and conscious, out to her I sail, in her heart is a virtue, something tells me I wonât be denied
The assault on the weak and misguided, indifferent and easy to kill
You think change and pursuit of prosperity, a victim of shock and awe
You want a, you want a confrontation, than on those words you will choke.
Her eyes and conscious, out to her I sail, in her heart is a virtue, something tells me I wonât be denied ,no I wonât be denied.
Freedom lost in the line of fire, what is the cost of the possessions you desire.
She will sleep a thousand centuries in a silence so deep, that even death may perish.
Weâre gonna torch this city and watch it burn.
Weâre gonna torch this city and watch it burn.
Weâre gonna torch this city and watch it burn.
Weâre gonna torch this city and watch it burn.
Walking towards the water, you sink beneath the waves, you made me want to change who I was way back then. Heart and soul, heart and soul.
Weâre gonna torch this city and watch it burn.
Weâre gonna torch this city and watch it burn.
Weâre gonna torch this city and watch it burn.
Weâre gonna torch this city and watch it burn.
