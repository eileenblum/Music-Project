Get away 
Get away, that's what they always say 
Though I can't relate 
I try and try and trying to undo 
So convincing all that way 
Though I detest 
I will choose to 
Choose to neglect all the thoughts of false communication 
Though you reject concentrating, contemplating on 
What they want of me 
What they'll never see 
What they perceive is burning in the grass 
Try to lose your own 
Confusion as melts upon your back 
And you resist in-tact 
So this is what you see 
Come and taste misery 
As it burns on my tounge 
This is this is dread 
I think I will for your thrill 
I think I'll try all this time 
Shelter me, bury me 
Get away-Rage 
Where we settle in the paths 
As I look as I look on back I realize 
The faceless dead
