Viola she watch me reign 
Viola my head engaged 
As she dances the Lilac bloom 
Viola can't watch you 
I Let her into the sun in a jaded shade 
I threw the people in a shallow grave 
And then she dances through the tear in my eye 
I gave them candy 
A mouthful of dirt 
Don't think I forgot 
And don't think I'm so strange 
I ain't your typical human and I'll tear your world apart 
I Left them in their heads 
As I ran their Line 
I've seen their vision as it all did die 
I've seen their faces as they took them to their helm 
I gave them shadows that never emerged 
Father, where did you go? 
Mother, what have you done? 
Well you bashed my head in 
You made me crazy 
Murderer 
I'll murder her 
Shallow days in my eyes 
Something's wrong 
I'll lay you on the ground 
It's too long 
It's too long since I tasted control 
It's too long 
So long since I tasted control. 
In my head I feel my pain 
I saw your game 
All is dead 
I'll cut you down Viola 
I'll cut you down my mother 
I'll cut you down 
Murderer
