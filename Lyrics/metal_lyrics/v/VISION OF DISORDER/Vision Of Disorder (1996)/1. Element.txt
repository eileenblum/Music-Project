And to the brink I will rise 
Rise! 
You wanna be on top you'd better stay on top 
Fight the wake keep your distance 
Loss of everything beat your face in 
Nine to five keep your distance 
You, you keep away from me 
You keep away from their ingenuity 
Never gonna get what you want 
Unless you stay dedicated 
You ain't never gonna be the gleam 
That keeps us all together 
Strength from within 
Regulate and Isolate 
Break yourself make mistakes 
Rearrange and learn from what you've done 
Reinstate, Copulate loss of fate be yourself 
To you want tell yourself you'll be what you want to be 
Sometimes the violence gets to me 
Makes me so sick I can't even see 
I will prevail 
Good times followed by the hard times 
And the good shall return and this I do swear 
Though my eyes I have seen your o.k. 
Through suffocation, dedication I will rise 
Through the heartbreak through the sorrow 
Let it pass by till tomorrow 
Yes the city breathes still you run 
Harm yourself from yourself 
Still we crawl on this wall 
Faces pale afraid to fall 
As we plummet as we plunder 
We learn a lesson that lasts forever 
No more compromise
