To be young and to be pure and to be bold 
Only to rise one way to the 
strength on way to perceive 
Our sacrificial tendencies 
These were the gifts provided by our statured gods 
They gave us their definition 
To religion to destruction to whom to believe 
Can't they see their days are fading? 
This is how it's gonna be until we die 
Life is deceptive to all the believers 
Our objective - to sort and decipher 
Their generation will rot in their golden grooves 
Our generation slapped with a fuckin' "X" 
Suffer 
And don't you bitch about your pain 
That you hide 
Deep inside 
To be young and to be bold 
Only to rise is one way to the strength 
One way to perceive our sacrificial tendencies 
These were the gifts provided by our statured gods 
They gave us their definition 
To religion to destruction to whom to believe 
Can't they see their days are fading? 
This is how it's gonna be until we die 
Fall down 
Ruptured focus 
Sown at the eye 
Some people are just too stupid to realize 
That they have vision for you and I 
I'll do my very best to try and fight against 
Their invasion coming from the dying fields 
Their days of labor withers their alliance 
Their generation will rot in the golden grooves 
Our generation prevails in the fucking end 
To destroy to employ 
To cock that gun 
One time too many - don't choose this one 
One way sight point of view, point of disclaim 
Our destruction is for memory
