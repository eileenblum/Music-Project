My perception my infection 
Lazy bloody eyes 
Self destruct so addictive 
Here's a taste of death here's your taste of death 
And I wish that I could feel the things you feel 
And I wish that I could see the things you see 
And through my eyes I see all your disgust 
I don't feel content 
You don't understand 
Stomach still uneasy 
Can't escape the hate 
And from it I'll run 
Put you in the river 
And from you I'll hide 
Standing in the rain 
And I'll cut myself in a muddy cove 
So when I die 
There will be no 
Processed information makes the world go round 
You've made me change so 
I'll pull the fuckin' trigger watch your head combust 
Pull the fuckin trigger watch your head combust 
By pointing your fingers 
You alienated me and made me the stranger 
So instill the values you protect 
This disease will spread and infect 
And through my eyes 
I see all your disgust 
Yellow running red becoming 
Just waiting for the pain 
Don't you take my actions 
Turn them against me 
I feel myself breaking 
I feel myself break
