Pray for me
Cause I'm struggling down
This needle and rock
In a daze I don't mind
The sun brought terror straight
From two o'clock sun
Into my system I lay wasted
From the pain scarred by all the mute remorse inside my head
Slice and begin again, again
Slice this skin again
Pray for all this Beckoning down on my soul
Like in pain, rests inside this
When I'm down
Short thin road
In my head


Thanks to skinnieminnie85 for correcting track #12 lyrics.
