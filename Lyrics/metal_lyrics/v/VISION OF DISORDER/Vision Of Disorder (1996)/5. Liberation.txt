It's something that's inside 
Something that makes us strive 
It's not the voice in my head 
Or your poor streets 
They place the blame on you 
They place the blame on me 
There's nothing you can do 
To change this world 
Is it the desperation? 
Is it the weakness? 
Is it the solemn faces in the tower? 
Convincing eyes-multiple 
Contributing to the aggression 
That persuades me to 
Take up arms upon you 
They claim the states in distress 
Due to the rise in crime 
I feel the manifest 
Has broken far west 
Was it a suicide? Was it a homicide? 
No one really cares so it's your death 
We are the ones who will suffer cause in 2001 
Nothing has changed cause nothing was done 
To control our resources to contain out pollutants 
Well hemp could have saved the world 
But you're too scared 
In fear of your economy 
Tripping, falling, locked out inside 
Control, resist products that left us 
Slipping, drowning, crumble down 
Dwindled, endangered, dying extinct 
You say we caught this disease 
It's running through our veins 
It's gonna end this world 
Spread through your culture 
We're growing every day 
Your children turning to us 
The pleasant way is gone 
Cause it doesn't work 
Restraint 
Yes this world you've wasted 
Don't you think you've tasted 
The fruits of this life 
This will be your restraint
