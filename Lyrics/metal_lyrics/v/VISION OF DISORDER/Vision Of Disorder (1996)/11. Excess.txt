Something's stuck inside my head 
You know I never really heard of a thing called time 
Cause excess has made me reckless 
I don't give a fuck about your dawn cause 
yeah 
Some day I will lay here as your children play 
Above my head, I hear your feet above my head 
Cause you can't hide 
From the side 
That left you high 
Moderation; what a notion 
A waste of time in the face of indulgence 
Excess is always best 
I'll stick it in your vein 
Sometimes these chains they do claim 
But something's got me coming back for more 
Gripping, tearing 
Pulling at the walls of that vanity 
Melting, pounding 
Change inside you 
Bleeding, crawling 
Scratching out the path beneath your feet 
Consist, constrict 
But something's got me going down this land 
This lane. 
Fade away 
Cause of this excess 
I've been left in a state of delirium
