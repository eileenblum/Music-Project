Litigation got me thinking 
In the window all these letters 
This will be your own catastrophe 
As you wait zone zero 
I don't care what you think 
I don't care what you say 
I don't care about them 
I don't care any 
I don't care what you think 
I don't care what you say 
I don't care about them 
I don't care anything 
No hope - for alliance 
No hope - for sadness 
No chance - for forgiveness 
Nothing - but your misery 
Nothing - you can do 
As it - melts and grinds you 
Inside - pain you spent 
In the - misery 
Sometimes it will tell 
Where you've been and what I've seen 
What I've found as I lay 
In your ground by your side 
Execution 
Mass polution 
My solution 
Kill the humans 
Los Angeles 
Engrossed in flame 
I don't care what you think 
I don't care what you say 
I don't care about them 
I don't care any 
Lost in time in your mind 
Nothing's left they all died 
I don't care what you think 
I don't care what you say 
I don't care about them 
I don't care anything 
Generation caught beneath 
All these guns 
Out of reach 
Where were all your profits during 
the atomic Shower of flesh 
Ashes 
Kiss it goodbye
