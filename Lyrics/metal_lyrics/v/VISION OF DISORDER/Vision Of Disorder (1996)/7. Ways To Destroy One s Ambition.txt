Level, Crumble 
Level by the hatred 
Can't really explain our nature 
Genocide was created 
Blown into the backs of children 
Pushing - miles away 
Down 
There's no acceptance 
There is no control 
Breeding adolence 
Come on 
I said it's to me 
To me there is nothing 
But total annihilation 
Come to us Armageddon 
Give us all what we deserve 
I lack the provision 
I lack the self control 
I lack the way to be 
Will to grow old 
I pull the shotgun close; 
close to my chest 
Grants me security in the New York City mirth 
Your eyes bleed
