Divide - Street force 
Street force will win the wars 
We were the ones to win 
You are the grateful 
We were the ones to lose 
You were the spiteful 
Show us the way 
We shall never fall 
Show us the way 
We shall never fall 
Divide - Street force 
Street force will win the wars 
No more patience 
We were the ones to protect 
You are the fortunate 
You were the ones to spit 
You are the ignorant 
Show us the way 
We shall never fall 
Divide - Street force
