leave you, in the depths of a virtual silence
believe, in the concept of compliance
never do you ever feel a thing
for the revolution I hope to bring
how long is it gonna be?
until you see.
everything you did
everyone you exploit
may come to destroy you
don't spend much time with apathy,
just want you to see catasprophy
that's about to be unleashed
no chance for recovery
not assuming, you're proving
a thing to me
cause it's an emotional overload
and it seems to persits
you can't recognize
you can't realize this feeling inside
just what you trying to prove?
i'm not feeling the things you're feeling
i ain't reacting for the things you'r giving
all your questions, they irritate,
take compassion, throw it away
just another dollar for your pocket
i'll do my best to try and stop you
show you all what I got
i won't stop until you drop
you're pathetic, you hypocrite
i'll stick your face in the shit
what's it gonna take to designate
rearrange, twist up the fate
a new method to fuel thought
instead of being sold you're being bought!
how's it feeling, to know you're stealing
from the ones who feel
i will, hurt you, break you
replace you with hate
i must lacerate, exterminate
all the weakness within
i know it was a waste
self injecting my own resurrection
i bet you want to take this all the way
if you could, i bet you would
one more thing i have to say
now is the time to be rid of the flakes
the ones playing the part of the fake
