Pulled from the innocence
Arms of deliverance
Mouths of forgiveness
Tongues of ignorance
Let your minds lead the way
Be yourself and you shall find
It's gonna be a long hard road
And to wherever you roam
Look for me under red sky
Feed the fire with a flame
Be yourself but don't abstain
We're all free, all the same
Prosper and live, prosper and gain
I know that nothing's perfect
I feel that we're connected
To you I can give
Through all, you can live
I feel like I never have before
And I think that I'll survive
To walk a million endless nights
Introspection - what you are
Dig in deeper - to see what you are
What you are and what you could become
'cause we're not living in a world that's giving
It's only matter of fact That we can all just extract
Any form of virus
So if you decide to explode
Look to me, not yourself, come to me
Start a new beginning
Stop your wasted dreaming
Life is too short for questions
That don't provide the answers
