Feel some pressure
An undistinguished knot of waste
Rising in your chest
The man laid open, a soul to test,
is this your last breath?

Cry, we have come too far...
Lonely sunrise, climbing into the sky,
Only to sleep...

We walk alone
Alone exposed to just blood and bone
Scouring graveyards
An empty Ritual for the hordes
In search of ourselves
Like complicated insects will
We discover strangers

When all drops silent
A grave where no light gets in
The world resents it
When all is placid
A tranquil place in time
Our Earth shattered
We ain't getting by...

Dusted twilight, spilling into moonlight
All our lives we're waiting to die

Open up your eyes
The sleeping eyes of time passed by
Never to realize
What might have been sin or doubt
Coming from the riverside
The side that's dried and petrified
Are screams of MERCY...
Why mercy's expected is beyond the point of points
Of points....
Of points....

IN FEAR OF THE RIVER
We trample under a billion stars
And vines that wind over the houses
And past the trees
Smothering everything...
