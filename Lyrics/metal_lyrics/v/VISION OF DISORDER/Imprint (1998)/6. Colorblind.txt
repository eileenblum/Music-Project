pathetic creatures,
walking endless,
pathetic species,
lost in a myth
breeding like rats,
glorious glimpse at the heavens
casting down on shallow threads
over horizons that lay unlimited
sunlight upon my face
crazy world, crazy girl
lost in the sunlight
slaughtered, murdered
over tragic century
spreading claiming
a victim's plea
don't find me misleading, deceiving
i am what i seem
a symbol a product a broken culture
but, bruised, stoned, drunk,
walking dead...
i don't need your conclusion,
i don't need your reason
i will live the life I wanna live
help me Jesus I can't,
give what they want me to give
only lost highways i stray
towards the sunlight,
where no one dares to wear a face
all colors blend,
into sunlight
rain down on me
crazy world, crazy girl
in the sunlight.
what of the horrors, what of the hate
what of the fear, that we all face.
in you in me... because of our skin
we separate, retaliate the colors collide
in attempt to fuckin' survive
a twisted culture
into the streets again, we all try to defend
a sacred place to feel safe. It's like a
mockery of a society that's been laid
to waste with no chance. a place of broken
dreams a place where nothing seems just
what it seems to be.
I try to open my eyes to a much
brighter light.
but it seems to be, dying,
taking us to the grave....
