rebirth, what the fuck did you think you would see
a burnt out complexion staring at me
rebirth of tragedy
you've been tripping, I've been growing
deeper inside i feel like this in me
I've lived it, I've been it,
the addict you've become
so what you got for me
scraping the plate
I always knew you'd come,
I always knew you'd fall on down
collision of the blue lights the drag
deeper comes the ring in my eyes
I think I'm seeping out of my skin
you know it's all a part of my head
came down, you came down
scraping the plate
rebirth of tragedy
the mouths move wtih no voices
I smeared your face again
my face against the wall
I've been coming far too close
so what you got for me
scraping the plate
I always knew you'd fall..
down
