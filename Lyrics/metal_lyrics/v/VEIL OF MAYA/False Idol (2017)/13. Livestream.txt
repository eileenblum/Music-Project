From the dust
I rose up and brought hell
Unchained but captivate
In hate I dwell
The power controls me
Darkness, the Goddess who knows me

I'm ashamed of what I've become
Sick of myself
Sick of being numb
I'm ashamed of what I've become
I am not enough
I have given up

I'm not who I was
(Who I was)
And I wish I was a better man
But I am who I am
(Who I am)
I crawl from the dust
(From the dust)
And I've never seemed to understand
But this is who I am
(Who I am)

I've disgraced this crown of blood
I am simply not enough
Forgive me for giving up
Salvation can't save what I've done
Lost and stricken with despair
Crippled kingdom lies unrepaired
Despair

I long for the moment I no longer breathe air

I'm not who I was
(Who I was)
And I wish I was a better man
But I am who I am
(Who I am)
I crawl from the dust
(From the dust)
And I've never seemed to understand
But this is who I am
(Who I am)

I've disgraced this crown of blood
I am simply not enough
Forgive me for giving up
Salvation can't save what I've done
Lost and stricken with despair
Crippled kingdom lies unrepaired
Despair

Accept my fate
Ascending now skywards
My body shakes, the top of this tower
I face the ground as I lean my weight forward
Their digital eyes watch as I fall downward
A final inception, it calls through the air
I pray as I'm falling
The power is there
I pray as I'm falling
The power is there

I'm not who I was
(Who I was)
And I wish I was a better man
But I am who I am
(Who I am)
I crawl from the dust
(From the dust)
And I've never seemed to understand
But this is who I am
(Who I am)
