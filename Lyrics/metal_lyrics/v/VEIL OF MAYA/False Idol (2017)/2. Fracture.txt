Fall, the bodies fall

I am the immortal
Chosen to judge your sins
Through the worst is spoiled
Judgement will bring you death

I will tear the flesh
Desecrate you
These peasants will see who stands over them all
As their bodies fall, as their bodies fall
The reign of the king who will never be gone
Will destroy you all

Standing as towers
Staring down at the coward
Standing as towers

These monsters burn in vain
Their victims have themselves to blame
Unleash the wolves from hell
Devour the souls and engorge yourselves

Engorge yourselves

All on their knees the weak will weep
Gasping just to breathe
Cold and dark
Compassion has fled
Death lives here instead
Through our streets, a river of red
I smile at the dead

I smile at the dead

I never said I'd show any mercy
(Throw 'em all in the pit)
I never said I'd show any mercy
(Throw 'em all in the pit)

I am the immortal
Chosen to judge your sins
To the ones disloyal
Judgement will now begin
