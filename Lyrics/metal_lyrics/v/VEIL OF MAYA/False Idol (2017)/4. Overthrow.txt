Within isolation
Controlled and made blind
Weathered desolation
Is wiped from our eyes
As I speak I begin to find belief
Powers in between
Reach for me

We refuse to live
Only sparing breath
We're caged in silence
We will soon begin
Bringing forth the end
To all this madness
Hold me high above the rest
We speak through defiance
We refuse to live
In this pattern of death
Return the violence

We refuse to live
Only sparing breath
We're caged in silence
We will soon begin
Bringing forth the end
To all this madness
Hold me high above the rest
We speak through defiance
Hold me high above the rest
We speak through defiance

You're built out of lies
We will not live caged in silence
Deception contrived
We will not rest
We are the defiant
Rise out of the rust
Out of the wreckage
Built out of lies
Born of the flies in despair

We refuse to live
Only sparing breath
We're caged in silence
We will soon begin
Bringing forth the end
To all this madness
Hold me high above the rest
We speak through defiance
We refuse to live
In this pattern of death
Return the violence

Rise
