Along the way
Mistakes were made, they'll call it fate
A world of slaves
Driven insane and thrown away [2x]

Like birds to worms
We don't need them, we just feed them
None of our concerns
Will ever reach them, we are beneath them

Deprivation
Annihilation

Along the way
Mistakes were made, they'll call it fate
A world of slaves
Driven insane and thrown away

A world of slaves

Among the ones who've given up
Loathing and dead weight
Has held us down for long enough
We'll forge a pathway

Nothing is seamless
Reset the sequence

A world of slaves

Along the way
Mistakes were made, they'll call it fate
A world of slaves
Driven insane and thrown away [2x]

A world of slaves
