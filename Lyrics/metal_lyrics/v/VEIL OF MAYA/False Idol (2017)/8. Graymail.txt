To the prisons with those who disobey
Where they shall rot and decay
And to the few who dare deceive me
Your heads will roll on the pavement beneath me

I will unhinge this world
My endless reign is all that I can see
I will unhinge this world
Knell at my feet or die in the streets

Your ridicule has made me what I am
What I am

To the honest men I've broken apart
But they fail to understand
That their ridicule has made me what I am

To the prisons with those who disobey
Where they shall rot and decay
And to the few who dare deceive me
Your heads will roll on the pavement beneath me

The hate you placed that made yourself crave ending
Famished ambition to eradicate you
When you're cast out, when you seek forgiveness
May you then realize your worthless existence

The red stains
The red stains

To the honest men I've broken apart (broken apart)
But they fail to understand
That their ridicule has made me what I am [2x]

Stained in red

The rodents will feast on your insides
Your ridicule has made me what I am
Your ridicule has made me what I am
