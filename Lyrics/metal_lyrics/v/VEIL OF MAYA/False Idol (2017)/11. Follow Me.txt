In slavery of the blood thirst
Drink from their hearts
If your brother shows mercy
Tear him apart

(Clean)
Follow me through the winds that curse our name
Out into the lands of the slain

These machines will not see defeat
As they sever your arteries
Mindless skeletons under control
Slay them all 'til their blood is cold!
Watch their limbs fall at your feet
Move your eyes
Through which I can see
With your hands, tear through their flesh
Donât bother cleaning the mess
Kill all the rest
Beg to be freed
Youâre wasting your breath
As you try and speak
Under siege
Brought to your knees
Your imminent death awaits as you plead
Suffering
Follow me, follow me into the land of the slain
Cursing their names we ride
Follow me, follow me into the land of the slain
Cursing their names tonight
