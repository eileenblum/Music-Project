Imprisoned in all of us, a journey
A true test of being, a struggle in us all to be human
We all possess the most raw and natural power deep inside
Standing there in the moment
In the position to live now
Standing there in the moment
Imprisoned in all of us, a journey

Temptation won't control me
In the position to live now
Temptation won't control me
Imprisoned in all of us, a journey
We all know there is something more to our lives
When the inner core beckons
Savage and clean the body still receiving, a message
The code to greatness
A known true cure to us all
