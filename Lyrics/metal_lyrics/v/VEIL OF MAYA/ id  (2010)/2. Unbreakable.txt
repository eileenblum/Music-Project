I hear them calling,
the damned are calling
From this hell on earth

Their voices flooding my ears,
I hear them calling
Their voices flooding my ears,
From this hell on earth

I sit back watching above,
sacrifice would mean relief from these times

We all hold the power to trust and have faith in ourselves [3x]

But just like a coward we flee from our hearts
Now is the time to believe in yourself
Have no fear how others think of you or will judge you
For your greatness will silence them all

Unbreakable [2x]

Now is the time to believe
Now is the time to believe in yourself
Now is the time together
Now is the time to believe (unbreakable)
Now is the time together
Now is the time to believe (immortal)

I sit back watching above,
sacrifice would mean relief
