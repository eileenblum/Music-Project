We will stand, make this place our own
One day we will leave it behind
We will stand, make this place our own
And one day leave it all behind [2x]

There is a place
An isle of non-existence created by our drive to live
Somewhere other than reality
We must sacrifice to survive, others try to take and deprive

Live together, die alone [2x]

Created by our drive to live
Fight on until it's known, our purpose, our being here
Must be a sign to the path, to the path we must take
From the sky a black smoke engulfs our minds, our souls, our minds ( our minds) (our souls)
We fight on until it is known, our purpose
This is the path
The path we must take
We will stand make this place our own
One day we will leave it behind
We will stand, make this place our own
And one day leave it all behind
