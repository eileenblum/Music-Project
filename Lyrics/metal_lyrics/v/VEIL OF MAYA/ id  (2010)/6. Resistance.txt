From the beginning a novel sworn in romance
A display of two statues revealed
We cast it all hoping for a bit of desire
Swept underneath our emotions burden inside
We find ourselves searching, hoping,
For a muse in the night to bring relief
An endless search for some a masked silhouette
Dancing in shadows our greatest fears
Resistance to desire
(Resistance)
Swept underneath our emotions burden inside
We find ourselves searching, hoping,
For a muse in the night
Colliding within we torch ourselves
A full flowing chalice of apathy
We know that this is the end our past a kindled undying flare

We cast it all hoping for a bit of desire [2x]
Swept underneath our emotions we find ourselves
