You hold the key to my casket
No more questions, just the thought of fulfillment
Sleep burns my eyes

[2x]
You hold the key to my casket
You hold the key to my casket

No more questions, just the thought of fulfillment
Sleep burns my eyes

Now forced to grasp a world of infinity
The notion is revealed

Transferring our thoughts into one
Swimming in my mind my callus shell
A reminder of what I've become

Transferring our thoughts into one
Swimming in my mind my callus shell
A reminder of what I've become

You hold the key to my casket
No more questions, just the thought of fulfillment
Sleep burns my eyes [2x]

You hold the key to my casket
