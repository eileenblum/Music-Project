I am in control [2x]

Judgment time has come
This world is mine, I'll mold it with my hands
Two trails lay before me, I know one as familiar as my senses (as my senses)
The other one preaches pain upon my mind, my eyesight extends
In my sights I have nothing, but guilt and deceit
They lay before me begging and willing for eternal mercy, for eternal mercy on their lives
Now's my time, this life is mine to make, complete
This choice is mine to take, receive

I am in control
Judgment time has come [4x]

Two trails,
Two trails lay before me I know one as my senses
The other preaches pain upon my soul
In my, in my sights I have nothing, but guilt and deceit
Begging me
Begging me
For eternal mercy
