I have come to bear the worlds burden
A selfish unholy command
Calling towards the stars, an essential flow of blood
So they've come to take our pride
We will overcome their lie [2x]

I will stand and fight
Grazing the pastures of the restless ones [2x]

They command dominance in all, a force to obey
Never
My brain unravels at my feet
Spilling what I know in defeat
My unconscious try is failing
Our existence in the fold
Demanding focus the internal message repeats
A mask to a septic being
(a mask, a mask)
Calling towards the stars, essential flow of blood
Calling towards the stars, Essential to us all
