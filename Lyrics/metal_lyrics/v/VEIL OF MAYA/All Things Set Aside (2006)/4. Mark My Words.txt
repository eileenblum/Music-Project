You are the destroyer of one of the only things that I value and hold close to my heart
Now you have taken my life, and you have taken my soul
But times have changed
You are dead to me
I am no longer your torture victim
I'm fed up with your fucking lies and games
The tables have turned and I shall have my way
This is a new beginning in every way
You and I are a shadow of the past
You've wasted so much of my life and I will never get it back
No more will you haunt my life
Mark my words, you were nothing more than a mistake
No more, I am looking past
Past you
I am now a stronger person because of this, not because of you
Mark my words, you are done
Mark my words, you are death
I am now a stronger person because of this
Mark my words, you are done
Mark my words, you are death
