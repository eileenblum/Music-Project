This is our kin,
Our oath, and
Our Honor

Within my chest beats
The heart of a lion
Winter is coming soon

The white wall

We are the left behind
The lost who never glance
Behind
For everything we
Need is in our minds

We save the broken ones
The helpless left with
No defense
Ones left standing in
The dust and grime

A Virus
Stay true to yourself,
So much value in that line
A Virus
Stay true to yourself,
So much value in that line

Race to the top
There we can see (we can see) to no
Measure

Look for your power
Everlasting, raging
Inside
Look for your power
Master and conquer
Till you expire [2x].
