Do you remember
When your heart had that
Drive, Thrived to seek more
While it was there

The last care
We won't sleep for a day
If we survive, survive
Just one more day.

I'll forge a moment
A Marvel for all of
Time if life was simple
Mended by the mask,
Perfection glistens
It glows glamorous

Faces drawing near
Purged away by the
Flame seeking out
Crystals
Do you remember
When your heart had that
Drive, Thrived to seek more
While it was there
The last care
We won't sleep for a day
If we survive, survive
Just one more day
I'll forge a moment
A Marvel for all of
Time
Under this weight
We crawl
Last shot trigger
Stall
Hold your ground
Freeze all of your love
Ignite all the lust [2x]

(all they have is just bam nam pado dodi banano nino no)

As we try to get back
It drifts away [2x].
