Raise your fist
Smell the air
Taste the fame

We follow our hearts for
This time is fading

We nurture our minds
With a fake lullaby
In this world (this world)
Each to their own
Divide Paths
Each to their own
In Overcoming false hopes, We enter the age of cycles
Freely we take to the air
Not knowing nor-
Caring the end
In Overcoming false hopes, We enter the age of cycles
Freely we take to the air
Not knowing nor-
Caring the end

I won't forget today
It is burned inside
My Brain

We use memories to
Canvas our lives in
Colored means
This is all our
Destiny [2x]

In This world.
