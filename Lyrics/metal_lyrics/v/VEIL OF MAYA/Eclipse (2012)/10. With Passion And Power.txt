This is a war
And attack on us all

We all let it slide as our
Morals burn in it's wake

We all fly
Until the day that it strikes you.
Leaves you broken inside
This is a war
And attack on us all
How could this be
Happening? We were like
Brothers

I won't forget you,
Keep you with me [2x]

When the smoke clears
Our life's total appears

We will map everything,
Structure all of the Lines

When the smoke clears
Our life's total appears

You were a king to us all,
Gentle giant of the land

When you have life in
Your hands[2x]

Hold it tight
Grasp it with strong
Demand [2x]

Mount this earth and excel
With Passion and Power [2x].

Hold it tight
Grasp it with strong
Demand [2x]

When the smoke clears
Our life's total appears
We will map everything,
Structure all of the Lines
When the smoke clears
Our life's total appears
You were a king to us all,
Gentle giant of the land
How could this be
Happening? We were like
Brothers
I won't forget you,
Keep you with me
When the smoke clears
Our life's total appears
We will map everything,
Structure all of the Lines
When the smoke clears
Our life's total appears
You were a king to us all,
Gentle giant of the land
