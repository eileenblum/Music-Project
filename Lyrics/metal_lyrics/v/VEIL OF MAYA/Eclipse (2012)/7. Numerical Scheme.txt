Pictures graze my
Consciousness like a
Trainwreck
Unforeseen

Ripped from the hands of
The beast and given away
To those who conquer

Blood and sand - the only
Thoughts upon my mind
Pictures graze my
Consciousness like a
Trainwreck
Unforeseen
Ripped from the hands of
The beast and given away
To those who conquer Blood those who conquer Blood

A numerical scheme
An unbearable dream

We stand at the line and
Leap towards our fears

And in this boundless
Moment
We Fall
We stand at the line and
Leap towards our fears
And in this boundless
Moment
We Fall

A numerical scheme
An unbearable dream A numerical scheme

We stand at the line and
Leap towards our fears
We mold our destiny
Through the actions of
Our Lives.

We stand at the line and
Leap towards our fears
We mold our destiny
Through the actions of
Our Lives.
