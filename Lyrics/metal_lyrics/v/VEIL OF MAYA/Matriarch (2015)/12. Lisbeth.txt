I'm looking back
I've gone astray
I've chosen my way but have I made a mistake

Here I am longing for shelter
Relinquishing everything

Hold your place and just keep still
Remind yourself you must fulfill your aspirations

Am I just simply afraid [2x]

I have chosen my way
But have I made a mistake
Here I am longing for shelter
Relinquishing everything

Hold your place and just keep still
Remind yourself you must fulfill your aspirations
Hold your place and just keep still
Remind yourself you must fulfill your aspirations

Far from the world that I once knew
Everything that I love is everything that I hate

Lost
Far from the world that I once knew
Why must I despise entirely

Everything that I love is everything that I hate
Have my ambitions led me astray
Or am I blatantly afraid

Hold your place and just keep still
Remind yourself you must fulfill your aspirations
Hold your place and just keep still
Remind yourself you must fulfill your aspirations
