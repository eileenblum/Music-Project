I've held it in my hands [2x]
My dismembered soul reassembles
I've held it in my hands [2x]
My dismembered soul reassembles

My dismembered soul

Take shape of which you desire
Evil lingers within each valley we pass through [2x]

I've held it in my hands [2x]

Evil lingers within everything [2x]

Hope has replenished my healing body relentless
Always in motion

Evil lingers within everything

I've seen it now, I've held it in my hands
My dismembered soul reassembles [2x]

Elevation is no escape
We send ourselves
To search for tranquility
A feeling that can't be found

Search for tranquility
A feeling that can't be found
It is fabricated through acceptance
Of a broken world

Evil lingers within everything [4x]
