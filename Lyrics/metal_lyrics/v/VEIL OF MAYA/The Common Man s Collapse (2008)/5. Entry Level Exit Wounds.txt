Dirty habits and dirty lives
She can't hold back
She must fulfill the end of the addiction

Hunting, sweating, freezing
Just another day in the life of a dead girl

She can't live without her shit
Rock bottom is just around the corner,
And she has a first, a first class ticket.
Test the vein, prep it
Tie the knot, make the blood clot...
Needle in. "Oh, what sin!", they all say

Just wait there's more.
More from this whore?
Oh yes, there is...
She ruined ruined her ruined her kids.

In a world where few, few can understand,
She's full of full of fucking pity
in this life who is she, who is she kidding
Now she has entry level wounds, entry level exit wounds
Now she has entry level exit wounds
Her face is missing
