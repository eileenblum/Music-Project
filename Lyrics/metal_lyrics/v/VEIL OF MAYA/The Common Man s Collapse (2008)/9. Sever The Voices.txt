We all know what lies behind the walls of deceit.
These are the thoughts that keep him awake.
These are the thoughts that keep him awake.

He contemplates his fate.
He has to decide,
He has to decide what it is he truly wants.

An hour of pleasure or two ruined lives?
He has to decide.
He can't sever the voices from his mind.

This time no trust, this time
What is his choice, not what is his fate.
To destroy all that is beautiful in not only his life but hers too?
What is his choice,

What is his choice, not what is his fate.
To destroy all that is beautiful in not only his life but hers too?

Separate the time and place, he has come to the end, the end.
He holds onto false ideas of what makes a man.
He thinks no more about the love of another,
He chooses to only satisfy himself.
Selfishness is not the word.

He has chosen but he knows this is wrong.
And he chooses, and he chooses...
He inserts... death for lust. She grieves.
He inserts... death for lust. She grieves.

he must â¬¥choose what he wants
he must â¬¥choose what he wants

She puts her hands around his weak and sweaty neck.
He's turned cold blue now.
Cold blue now
He's turned cold blue now
He's turned cold blue now

There is blood and there are tears for this occasion.
She can't sever the voices from his mind.
