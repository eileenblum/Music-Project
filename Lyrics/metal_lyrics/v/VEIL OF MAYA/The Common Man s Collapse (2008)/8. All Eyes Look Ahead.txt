Chariots ride above fiery craters
Uncertain a mist appears ahead
Solvent and simple the figure approaches
Stench of the dead stings my nostrils, the sulky
Figure whispers to me
Ultimate sacrifice or be condemned
I raise to my knees cutting his work in two
Life and death so simply put
I wrap my hands around his cold shape, I wrap my
Fucking hands
Screaming till my lungs bleed I clench
Screaming till my lungs bleed I end this
