Triumphant beyond its glory
Like a towering prize they stand tall
From their hands a demonic entity, as it comes to life
The electric playground breathes irradiant light
Muses the eyes of the faithful with a single touch
The electric playground
Muses the eyes of the faithful with a single touch
Cauterization envelops your soul as all joy drains
From your body
Knees collapsing, you bow in its aura
In the crowd a head gives the word
With a blue glow the playground comes to life
Unveiling the secret in us all
Knees collapsing, we bow in its aura
