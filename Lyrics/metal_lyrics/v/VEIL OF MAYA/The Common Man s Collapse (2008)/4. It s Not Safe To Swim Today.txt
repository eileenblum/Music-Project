I knew this would be hell, but this is not living
Push them down and exhale water
Push them down and exhale blood
Push them down and exhale water
Push them down and exhale blood
Breathe
You wanted this
And if we can't even trust ourselves how can we trust anyone else
It's not safe to swim today, it's not safe
I don't think I can be saved
This shallow water is my grave
I don't think I can be saved
push them down...
Push them down and exhale water
Push them down and exhale blood
