I will be known and I will scream it
I will be known today
Relayed into thoughts of tranquil society, as this is our last nights rest
I will be known and I will scream it
I will be known today
If these are all the wounds that we suffer, then we are the lucky ones [2x]
If this is all the time we have then we must move forward, forward
I can't be your only savior
This will break under
Under the pressure of their eyes I can't feel guilt I can't feel shit [2x]
I can't feel shit
I can't feel guilt I can't feel shit
Do I need to repeat myself?
You can't crawl back can't crawl towards the light [2x]
I am now numb [7x]
