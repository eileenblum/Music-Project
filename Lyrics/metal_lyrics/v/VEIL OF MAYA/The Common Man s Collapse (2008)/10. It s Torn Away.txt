This is the last time I will struggle
The eyes of a million follow each step I take walking further into hell
The weak and willing wither under the weight of their own restraint
We hold an ideal of the way it's supposed to be
Every motion creates a canyon left empty
Slowly the path begins to crumble and split
Destruction lurks waiting to fill the void
While the other motions grief and iridescent light
A sense of knowing and divide, this is a choice in which we all relate
A sense of knowing and divide, grief and iridescent light
This is a choice make up your mind
Following step by step in each of our lives
Eyes always following and watching speaking tongues unknown
Following step by step I go [2x]
It's torn away when I try to hold on [3x]
I grab the end of my senses, dragging them to reality
And as I see who I am now this is the path to being free
I grab the end of my senses, dragging them to reality
And as I see who I am now this is the path to being free
This is the last time I will struggle
The eyes of a million follow each step I take walking further into hell
The weak and willing wither under the weight
We hold an ideal of the way it's supposed to be
Seemingly perfect like a grid composed of dots
Following step by step in each of our lives
Eyes always following and watching speaking tongues unknown
Following step by step I go
