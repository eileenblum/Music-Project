Actions without prayers are whimsy
Prayers without actions are delusion

Build a bridge where there isn't a bridge
Build a road where there isn't a road

Actions without prayers are whimsy
Prayers without actions are delusion

Wipe horror and anxiety from your mind
And step forward

Something you do for yourself helps someone
Something you do for someone profit oneself
Something you do for yourself helps someone
To take action leads us to the future

To take action leads us to the future...
