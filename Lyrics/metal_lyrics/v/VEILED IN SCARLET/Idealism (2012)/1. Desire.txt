There's no God in this world
It's just a man made creation
What is justice and what is evil?
No one could judge others

The strong always conquer a world
The weak only capitulate
This is a world where the stronger prey upon the weaker

There's no God in this world
It's just a man made creation
What is justice and what is evil?
No one could judge others

The strong always conquer a world
The weak only capitulate
You couldn't survive if you're not strong

It's the way I believe in such a world
The belief in my soul
It's the way I believe in such a world
That must be my God

Have a strong will!!
Don't be carried away by anyone!!
Walk on the ground steadily
I always want to be strong
