I don't care about the consequence
The way I do things is the most important
To convince myself is important
I'm not even afraid if I'm criticized

Everything I do is my own responsibility
The things I'm convinced
That is art! That is life!

Shout! Rampage! Crush!
Searching for my dream
Shout! Rampage! Crush!
Hurt and bleed for catching my dream

âI'll be saved when I'm born againâ
That's the only relief
Accumulation of my soul is me
I'm going my way with my belief
That is art! That is life!

Shout! Rampage! Crush!
Searching for my dream
Shout! Rampage! Crush!
Hurt and bleed for catching my dream

Shout! Rampage! Crush!...
