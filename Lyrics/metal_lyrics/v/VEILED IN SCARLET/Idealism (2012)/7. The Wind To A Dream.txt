I'm wandering in the crowd
Lights in the town make me irritated

Dream in my mind
I believed it would come true
But I realized how immature I am
I'm struggling because I can't throw it away

An empty quack
Do I wanna be such a man?
Now stand up!!
There's no rule to survive

Make the wind that goes toward tomorrow
Even if it's small now
It'll be big that involves everything soon after
Make the wind that goes toward a dream
Even if it's small now
It'll be big that involves everything soon after
