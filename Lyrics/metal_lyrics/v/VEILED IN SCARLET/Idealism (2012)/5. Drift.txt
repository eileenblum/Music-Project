Sound of waves that come and leave
Shaking hazy sight
I who lost light am drifting on the waves now

You smile at me
Blowing in the wind
Memory of my past days
Now I'm wandering with you in this illusion

Solitude perplexes my heart
It imposes on my loneliness
Solitude misleads my heart
âI'll be free from this pain if I kill myselfâ

I was born in this world
And given a bitter trial
There's only one certain thing in this world
where there's nothing I can believe
That is you

That is you...

Solitude perplexes my heart
It imposes on my loneliness
Solitude misleads my heart
âI'll be free from this pain if I kill myselfâ

I was born in this world
And given a bitter trial
There's only one certain thing in this world
where there's nothing I can believe
That is you
I can keep walking with your warmth
