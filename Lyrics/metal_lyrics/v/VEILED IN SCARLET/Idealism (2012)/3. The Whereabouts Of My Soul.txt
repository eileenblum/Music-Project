I lost my way in the dark
It's like a maze without an exit
The more I struggle, the more my heart takes a bruise
Cry! Break down into tears!
As if pour everything in my mind out

I lost my way in the dark
It's like a maze without an exit
If I'm lived by something,
This tragedy might be an ordeal for going forward

The existence of myself
Where is it from and where is it going to?
No one knows where my soul is going to

Everyone has a broken heart
Everyone is looking for a way to live
Even if I have some misfortune in the future
I need not to be afraid if I have a strong mind

Everyone is looking for a way to live...

I need not to be afraid if I have a strong mind...
