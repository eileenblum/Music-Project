In the stillness of death
I can hear the shout
But no one is there
Can't see outside
Surrounded by concrete walls
Night befalls
I can't even sleep

I wonder how long I walked
There's no one even if I turned around

Embrace me... and
Please be over me...
Let me dream...
Then kill me...

Cold wind like ice blows
Can't fly with a broken wing
I wonder how long I walked
There's no one even if I turned around

I wonder how long I walked
There's no one even if I turned around

Embrace me... and
Please be over me...
Let me dream...
Then kill me...
