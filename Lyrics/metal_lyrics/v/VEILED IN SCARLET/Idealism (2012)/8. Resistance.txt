The sun sets in the west
The evening sun tints the town red
I smoke the last cigarette and leave my room

Yes, I live as I am still fettered by the past
The awful memory of my childhood
I've been living with hatreds

I'll disappear if I could kill that guy
I'll bum suffering that I've kept in my mind for long time
âI wonder if all of this ends...â
Life is called revenge...
The last feeling I have in such a life...
There's nothing but hollow

I'll disappear if I could kill that guy
I'll bum suffering that I've kept in my mind for long time
âI wonder if it's a proof of my life...â
Life is called revenge...
The last feeling I have in such a life...
There's nothing but hollow
