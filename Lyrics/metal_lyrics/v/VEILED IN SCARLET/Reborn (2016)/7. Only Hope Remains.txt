I realized I've forgotten something with the smell of rain,
Not knowing what it is I watch the ground getting darker,
The sunlight brightens the days that were lost,
The only thing staying beside me is hope,

Rain is falling ,
The dry leaves are falling down,
The drops are falling down,
Ashes float up,
The petals are falling down,
Tears are falling,
Snow is melting,
Falling, falling down,

It falls through the tightly closed fingers,
No matter how much you try to keep them contained,
They will fall one by one,
Sorrow, rage, the lingering scent, emptiness,

Now that even emptiness has left only hope remains,
During a polar night not knowing which way is out,
Memories, they are the only candlelight,
We start waiting without waiting for dawn,

The only thing staying beside me is hope,

It falls through the tightly closed fingers,
No matter how much you try to keep them contained,
They will fall one by one,
Hatred, solitude, an innocent sin, emptiness,

Now that even hope has left only hope remains,
During a white night not knowing which way is in
Memories, they are the only candlelight,
We start running without waiting for dawn,
Now that even hope has left only hope remains,
During a white night not knowing which way is in
Memories, they are the only candlelight,
We start running without waiting for dawn...
