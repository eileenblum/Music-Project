Eroded stone walls covered with ivy,
Doors groaning sadly,
Forgotten wooden grain,
Mirrors that do not reflect anyone,
Elegant curves covered in dust,

I smile while looking at the dance floor,
I open the window,
My shadow dancing like a clown,
Only the sound of my steps on the floor,
I used to dance on with you,

Outside the window, mist, a lake, forest, beautiful things,
In this open prison,
Love almost killed you,

The scenery of the end shines in my eyes,
Moonlight shines in from the dusty windows,
My shadow moves in the moonlight,
With it; I found these curtains weren't white,

These beautiful things peeling off from the ground,
Poetry of life, love songs, melting snow,
An innocent insanity,

The scenery of the end shines in my eyes,
Moonlight shines in from the dusty windows,

The sky cracks open its depths,
All the beautiful things float up above,
I might never float up,
I might be buried in the shadow with my sin...
