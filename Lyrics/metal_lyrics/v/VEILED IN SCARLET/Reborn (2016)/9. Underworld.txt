Silence of the night builds the underworld,
As if the last leaf falls on the frozen ground,
I'm led by something to reach out to the dark,
A rotten leaf whirls in the wind mingling with the heavy rain,

Black of the night whispers to my soul,
As if the last leaf falls on the frozen ground,
I'm led by something to reach out to the dark,
I cannot go back if I cannot see the keyhole,

This cold world that is covered with soundless rain,
I can't, I can't hear anything but the roaring silence,

The book in my heart,
I remember the first page,
The unfinished story,
I'm standing there,
The book in my heart,
I remember the first page,
The unfinished story,
I'm standing there,

This cold world that is covered with soundless rain,
I can't, I can't hear anything but the roaring silence,

The book in my heart,
I remember the first page,
The unfinished story,
I'm standing there,
The book in my heart,
I remember the first page,
The unfinished story,
I'm standing there,

I close the book,
I'm standing here
I close the book,
I'm standing here
I close the book,
I'm standing here
I close the book,
I'm standing here...
