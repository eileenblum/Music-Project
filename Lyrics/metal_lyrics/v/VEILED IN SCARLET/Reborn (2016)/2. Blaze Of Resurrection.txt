Blaze,

Feeling the disgust just eating me away,
Cannot stop it oozing slowly out from my left chest,
Just like roots breeding throughout my body,
Just like rain sinking into the innocent sea of sand,

Disgust so fierce it plays with my rage,
A growing chain made with molten steel,
When I try to rip it off, it stick to my fingers,
Burning me as it eats me away again,

Fire it,
Fire, enough to scorch my disgust,
Fire the wood,
Only grief can feed it into this fire,

Filling my lungs with the smoke that made me ash,
A new fire, the blaze of resurrection,
For nothing, I can feel the heat,
For we are the fire,
We are the unforgiving blaze,

Fire it,
Throw more wood into this fire,
Throw in the wood,
Only solitude can color this fire Scarlet,

Filling my lungs with the smoke that made me ash,
A new fire, the blaze of resurrection,
For nothing, I can feel the heat,
For we are the fire,
We are the unforgiving blaze,

Filling my lungs with the smoke that made me ash,
The one and only fire, the blaze of resurrection,
For nothing, I will feel the fear,
For we are the fire,
And we are the resurrecting ash...
