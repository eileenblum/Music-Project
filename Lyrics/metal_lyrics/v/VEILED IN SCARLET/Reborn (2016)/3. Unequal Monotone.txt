Deciduous trees shivering; the afternoon,
Afraid of the dusk closing in,
Battling their branches,
To endure the approaching winter; they cannot escape,

Wind that does not carry letters,
Clouds that do not forecast anything,
Soundless rain, a roaring silence,
The boxed sky, the freedom will eat us alive,

Hands that can't caress her cheeks,
Lips that forgot how to kiss,
Hair that doesn't want to be caressed,
The freedom will eat us alive,

Nights that don't sleep,
Lights that paint over the moonlight,
Nights that don't sleep,
The boxed sky looking down upon us,

The unbalanced world,
The distorted towers,
We don't know the intention why flowers have color,
This unequal monotone,
The distorted storm of colors,
We knew the color of the sky, back then,

Nights that don't sleep,
Lights that paint over the moonlight,
Nights that don't sleep,
The boxed sky looking down upon us,

The unbalanced world,
The distorted towers,
We don't know the intention why flowers have color,
This unequal monotone,
The distorted storm of colors,
We knew the color of the sky, back then...
