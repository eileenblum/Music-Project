Sunlight departing to the west with hope,
Slightly sensing the scent of rain,

The abandoned spring,
I shall never close my eyes,
A window with the lost scenery,
Alone by the window,

Embracing my knees closely,
Watching the sunlight pass by,
Drops running down my shaded knees,
You cannot see my tears falling with the rain,

The dusk is swallowing the colors,
The contours are getting stolen,
Silence like insanity sew my lips together,

I captured Eternity inside this thing,
I wonder if you will smile,
I captured Eternity inside this thing,
I wonder if you will smile again,

The dusk is swallowing the colors,
The contours are getting stolen,
Silence like insanity sew my lips together,

I captured Eternity inside this thing,
I wonder if you will smile,
I captured Eternity inside this thing,
I wonder if you will smile,
I captured Eternity inside this thing,
I wonder if you will smile,
I captured Eternity inside this thing,
I wonder if you will smile again...
