Close your eyes,
There are only empty frames,
Cover your ears,
So you can only hear her voice in this absolute noise,

Sew your lips together,
Words are a chain, words are a prison,
Hold your breath,
While the last note of the one left still exists,

Don't open up your hands,
So that you don't have to touch her cheeks,
Everything that can be touched only to fade away,
To the beginning,
The Scarlet....
