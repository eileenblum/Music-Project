Her murder brought chaos upon this closed land,
Everything lost reason,
Nothing had meaning,
It shattered this world into a thousand pieces,
And the ones that loved her along with it,

Standing deep in the forest his old coffin,
He opened the dusty windows,
He dances like a clown,
The moon used to hide the lovers' secret,
Now, the moon only shines on him,

The mist like chains,
The lake like a cage,
This forest like a wall,
Their love almost killed you,

He kept wondering but his shadow didn't leave,
His shadow chased him back to this manor,
For his eternal rest along with his sins,
His sight starting to get swallowed by black,

Beautiful things float up from the ground,
Poetry of life, love songs, melted snow,
An innocent sin,

He freed her soul from the cage holding her,
Her death bounds his heart,
He waited quietly in the dark,
All he wanted was a conviction, an end,

Only the moonlight shines upon him,
It erases the shadow of the clown, erases his sins,
The shattered chandelier starts floating up,
As well as he too, to the above...
