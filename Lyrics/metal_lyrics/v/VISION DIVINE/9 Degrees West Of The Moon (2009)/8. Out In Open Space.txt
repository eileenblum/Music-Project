Out of the path of reason
Close to the seventh sky
There is no pre-built prison
I can take my time
My soul has found a treasure
Something my brain denies
Fantasy now can lead me
Take this hand of mine

I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm a cloud that wanders high
I'm just everything that rides far away

Out in open space
I spread my wings and fly
Out in the open space
No one can stop me now
Now I am free to fly

I drank from the absinth spring
I drift in a sullen sea
Letting my problems fade away
For those there will be time

I'm a leaf that flies away
Yellowed by the sands of time
I'm the Universe that strives to the Infinite

Out into open space
I spread my wings and fly
Out into open space
No one can stop me now
Now I'm free to fly
Out into open space
Leave problems right behind
For those there will be time
Out into open space
Open the gates of Time
Serenity will be mine
