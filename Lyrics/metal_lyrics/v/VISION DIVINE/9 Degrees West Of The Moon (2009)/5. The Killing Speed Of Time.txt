Everything I loved
Disappeared, it's gone
Everything I loved is lost, cast away like trash!
Everything I got
now it is no more
Centuries are sand
Nothing will be left
By the waves of time, we will fade away
The infinite: what's that?
Something we can't touch

And my rage grows
Every drop of blood
Screams into my veins
All my senses call
My perception turns
To my primal instinct
While the time goes
With its killing touch
Still I struggle for the infinite
And the days turn
Into black night
Every day that's gone ,one less to be lived

Time rules
Over the Universe
Time goes by
Can't you perceive it now?
The killing speed of time....

Fighting like small ants
For a piece of time
We deceive our senses trusting our own lies
"The Infinite: what's that?
Something we can touch"

And my rage grows
Every drop of blood
Screams into my veins
All my senses call
My perception turns
To my primal instinct
While the time goes
With its killing touch
Still I struggle for the infinite
And the days turn
Into black night
Every day that's gone ,one less to be lived

Time rules
Over the Universe
Time goes by
Can't you perceive it now?
The killing speed of time...
