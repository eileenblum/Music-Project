For you I'll cross the seven seas
Till the gates of Laudomia
The walk is long but I've no fear
And I will step in through the door:
The 3 cities of Laudomia...
Smelling flavors never known

And in the living town I'll cross the silent roads
Under a leaden sky I'll come to stop my rove

And there I will stop by
The many crossroads crossing
I'll stand by
Unraveled streets of mine
When shadows will cover
The 3 shapes of Laudomia
The moonlight
Will tell me where to find your home

I'll see the light
oh, Laudomia!

And when the Oceans will be dry
Still we'll be here in Laudomia
The city of a thousand cries
to the horizon we will fade
In the legend of Laudomia
Forever bound to eternity

And in the viewless town we'll cross the silent roads
Under a leaden sky we'll come to stop our rove

And there I will stop by
The many crossroads crossing
I'll stand by
unraveled streets of mine
When shadows will cover
The 3 shapes of Laudomia
The moonlight
Will tell me where to find your home

I'll see the light
oh, Laudomia
