I'm walking in the night
How many thoughts are calling me?
Couldn't keep all of them in my mind
They're here
Down to the floor I kneel
Facing the vault of Heaven
trying to stop the tears
I search for haven

Where are you now?
I am searching through the stars to find your light tonight
In this silence
I close my eyes, save me!

Violet loneliness I know you
Feeling alone and fool
And you're coming with your blue
Violet loneliness I love you
You come to give me pain
But you are my only friend
You come tonight...
But I won't fight...
'Cause you are the one...

If I'd be born again
I'd be a swan, I'd fly away
to the horizon, with breeze in my face
Goodbye

Come and hold me
Open your arms, I'm here

Violet loneliness I know you
Feeling alone and fool
And you're coming with your blue
Violet loneliness I love you
You come to give me pain
But you are my only friend
You come tonight...
