I cannot help sometimes
To think about how life
Can change in many ways
And let you down in pain
And thoughts, they run so fast
They get till outer space
Where stars are painting skies
With marvelous pure lights

Over there, yes, I saw you
Among a billion stars I found your one

These few lines are for you
For the child that could
But has not come to life in this blue world
And this message's for you
Hope it helps you not to
Feel so lone and forsaken in sorrow

...Letter to my child never born...

Son I've never had
Just come and take my hand
If life you haven't had
Is what you still regret
I've been told that Faith
Is something you can't buy
Should I praise it, then
To come and cleanse my pain?

In this night hear my call
Come to my door
Melt your tears with mine

These few lines are for you
For the child that could
But has not come to life in this blue world
And this message's for you
Hope it helps you not to
Feel so lone and forsaken in sorrow
Letter to my child never born...
Hey there, I'd want to know
Could I have done anything I did not?

I'm not a hero, I just couldn't...
What if I...? What if we...maybe...
would you tell me?

I just want this pain
To be part of me
This is all for you
My poor child never born...

These few lines are for you
For the child that could
But has not come to life in this blue world
And this message's for you
Hope it helps you not to
Feel so lone and forsaken in sorrow
Letter to my child never born...
