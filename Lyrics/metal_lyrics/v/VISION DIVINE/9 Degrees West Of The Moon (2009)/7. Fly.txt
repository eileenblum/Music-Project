How many times
Have I been falling down?
Lost in the dark
With no answers left
I don't remember
Now I roam all alone
Searching for an answer
For a reason to stand up and stay

Waiting for a guiding light
Breaking through this silent night
Where my dreams are free to fly
Far away

Fly, now I fly
And the night is no more part of my life
No more
Just follow me
And you will see the place I've seen before
My life...no more...

How many nights
Have I been alone?
Lost in my thoughts
Searching for your face
I can't remember...
Looking up to the sky
Where the moonlight sparkles
Melting with a billion galaxies

Waiting for a guiding light
Breaking through this silent night
Where my dreams are free to fly
Far Away

Fly, now I fly
And the night is no more part of my life
No more
Just follow me
And you will see the place I've seen before
My life...no more...
