Look around yourself
See with eyes of innocence and you will see we're here
We're everywhere you seek
In a shiny dawn
In the sunset painted with some red and blue, we're there
Wherever you might look

Behind a smile
Before your eyes
Every time love peeps out of nowhere
Behind an old man
A young child laughing
We're Angels in disguise

Come with me
On the wings of hope and now take my hands
One more time, one more night
Don't lose your faith, I'm here with you

Every time you need
Don't you ever think you have been left alone,oh no!
I cry my tears with you
All the bad you got
Wouldn't make any sense if life should be just what you think
And that's why we're all here

Behind a smile
Before your eyes
Every time love peeps out of nowhere
Behind an old man
A young child laughing
We're Angels in disguise

Come with me
On the wings of hope and now take my hands
One more time, one more night
Don't lose your faith, I'm here with you
