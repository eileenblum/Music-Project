Tell me, father:
Is it time to go, really?
A little more time
Let me stay with you...

I wanna stay here in your arms now
Make me feel: how would it have been
To be born, to live, to grow up with you

I'm leaving
I'm fading away:
a shade in sunlight...
But promise me that you
Will think of me, sometimes

Time to wake up
Dreams can't last forever, I know
And I am
Part of your dream

You'll be my hero,now and ever
So goodbye
It is the time to go back to where
I belong:

Remember:
My spirit will be forever waiting
9 degrees west of the moon
Somewhere in time

"Infinite spaces are waiting for me beyond the curtain
Silence, so patient, will cradle my wonders
In quiet, so deeply, my fear will end its calling
And finally in peace forever I'll ponder
I'll always be there for you... Goodbye"

Remember:
My spirit will be forever waiting
9 degrees west of the Moon
Somewhere in time
