Hey there, can't you see me now?
I'm here with you
Why don't you smile at me?
Like a ghost I fade
I am nothing
With emptiness I melt
In broken pieces

Tell me
Why don't you talk to me?
I'm nothing but
A fading shadow

My spirit wanders in the dark
Looking for a piece of sun
Out here it's so cold...
I float in space without a name
Who could listen to my words
Of pain and sorrow?

Every day and every night
Searching for some faces
Lost in sullen traces

Tell me
Why don't you talk to me?
I'm nothing but
A fading shadow

Tell me
Why don't you talk to me?
I'm nothing but
A fading shadow
