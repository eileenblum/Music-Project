[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Tordiglione - Lyrics:Magnani]

Finally light!
Finally I'm free to run away... away from the night
It was too much time
Spent like a dead man walking by
I finally can spread my wings

No more tears, no more fights
Each one is free to take his own way out
You take yours, I'll take mine

Out of the maze 
Revealing secrets we kept on the way
Who knows who's right
Breaking the chains I'm gonna give up my future to fate 
Nothing else to say

Now I'm alright
Eventually I saw what was not clear to my eyes
For all my life
Thought I had friends I could confess
My fears and my hopes

No more tears, no more fights
Each one is free to take his own way out
You take yours, I'll take mine

Out of the maze 
Revealing secrets we kept on the way
Who knows who's right
Breaking the chains I'm gonna give up my future to fate 
Nothing else to say

Out of the maze 
Revealing secrets we kept on the way
Who knows who's right
Breaking the chains I'm gonna give up my future to fate 
Nothing else to say
