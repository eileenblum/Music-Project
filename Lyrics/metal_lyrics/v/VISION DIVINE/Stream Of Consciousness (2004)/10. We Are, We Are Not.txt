[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Luppi - Lyrics:Magnani]

My life's been flowing out of hands
Long from my darkest fears
But I will find the strength to carry on
Don't be afraid to tell, I know that it's over
All the way that's where I'm heading with no regrets
I filled the hunger inside of me
With the last call of my revenge

In myself I found my prison
Only you can tell me why
The fall of my reason's releasing my soul

We are, 
we are not... 
Our future's our tomorrow's past
We are,
we are not... 
Please
Take my hand and bring me out of here
Before this cage can drive me mad
There's no hope for me for some sanity
I lost my mind
We are,
we are not.

My flashbacks fill my thoughts with dread
Moving along with loneliness
All the years gone by still in my head
Here in these endless lies we are living in 
Right now that we just can't say goodbye
There's such a mess inside my mind
We both lost our way
And it seems we'll never meet again

In myself I found my prison
Only you can tell me why
The fall of my reason1s releasing my soul

We are, 
we are not... 
Our future's our tomorrow's past
We are,
we are not...
Please
Take my hand and bring me out of here
Before this cage can drive me mad
There's no hope for me for some sanity
I lost my mind
We are, 
we are not.
