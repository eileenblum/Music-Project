[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Luppi - Lyrics:Magnani]

You and me
A madman and his Angel to their final trip
Drifting in a sullen sea, identities
Divided by a tiny line we cannot see
But I can feel your presence right here

Tell me where I've gone
And where are my dreams and my desires?
They just run away
And I sit here with these empty words to tell

I can feel your Spirit falling down in me
I feel your holy wings
Calming down my fears and rage that slowly pass me by

Now I see
That in this dark surrounding me I will find some peace
And all the truth I needed was right here with me
All the reasons why I lost my soul
I can't get back
Forgive me, if you can... I won't

Thanks for what you've done
And for being how you are with me
The sun is going down
Don't keep me here waiting for the dawn alone
I can feel your Spirit falling down in me 
I feel your holy wings 
Calming down my fears and rage that slowly pass me by

Here I am
Is this the end I always have been searching for?
The meaning of what I called life?
