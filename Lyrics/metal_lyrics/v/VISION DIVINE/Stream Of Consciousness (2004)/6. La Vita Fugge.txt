[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Luppi - Lyrics:Magnani]

La vita fugge et non s'arresta una hora, 
et la morte vien dietro a gran giornate, 
et le cose presenti, et le passate 
mi danno guerra, et le future anchora; 
e 'l rimembrare et l'aspettar m'accora 
or quinci or quindi, si che 'n veritate, 
se non ch'i' ho di me stesso pietate, 
i' sarei gia di questi pensier' fora. 
Tornami avanti s'alcun dolce mai 
ebbe 'l cor tristo; et poi da l'altra parte 
veggio al mio navigar turbati i venti; 
veggio fortuna in porto, et stanco omai 
il mio nocchier, et rotte arbore et sarte, 
e i lumi bei, che mirar soglio, spenti. 
[F. Petrarca - Sonetto CCLXXII]

If I could stop time...
How many things that I would change from the past
I'd set my life right

If I could live forever
How many emotions I would learn to control
And feel what I want

Time is running too fast for me
You can't stop its course
Never surrender, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Time is moving along too fast
I can't think straight
Won't take all the time that I need
If I try I'll always be late

I wanna kill time
Win my own war to survive
Only a chance... I'd surely not fail

Time is running too fast for me
You can't stop its course
Never surrender, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Time is moving along too fast
I can't think straight
Won't take all the time that I need
If I try I'll always be late

Time is running too fast for me
You can't stop its course
Never surrender, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Time is moving along too fast
I can't think straight
Won't take all the time that I need
I'll always be late
