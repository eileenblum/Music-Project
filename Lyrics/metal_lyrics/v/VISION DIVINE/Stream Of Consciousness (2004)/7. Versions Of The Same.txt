[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Tordiglione - Lyrics:Magnani]

We're only two versions of the same
Trying to get far but we can't fall apart
And I know all of your silent cries
Your desperate call of the wild in the dark

No you never had to feel this way
There's an answer that grows in your heart
All you see, all you feel lives inside of me
You've been heading too close to the sun

Going nowhere, nothing is forever
Tell me... Am I wrong? I'm falling down with you

'Cause I know we are one
Don't you know we are two versions of the same
You can't find your way if you are not with me
And I know we are one
Yes I know we are two versions of the same
There's so much left to say but you do need some faith

All the secrets I keep inside 
Something that's not to be known from this side 
What I see, what I feel
What I need to know and what I never really say
Now our souls are too close to combine

Come here, follow me
Through the Gates of Heaven
Tell me... Am I wrong? I really can't go on

'Cause I know we are one
Don't you know we are two versions of the same
You can't find your way if you are not with me
And I know we are one
Yes I know we are two versions of the same
There's so much left to say but you do need some faith

'Cause I know we are one
Don't you know we are two versions of the same
You can't find your way if you are not with me
And I know we are one
Yes I know we are two versions of the same
There's so much left to say but you do need some faith

...All you need is faith...
