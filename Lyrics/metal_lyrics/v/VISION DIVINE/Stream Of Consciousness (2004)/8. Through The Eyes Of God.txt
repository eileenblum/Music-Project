[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Luppi - Lyrics:Magnani]

My body forsaken, my feelings coming down
I'm here with no rights to complain
No more directions, well now I realize
There are things human beings can't conceive
I need to focus, I need control
I'm losing the key of my mind
I can't keep the whole oceans
Into the palm of my hands

Memories are flowing
Through the waves of a whispering wind
Time to lead my soul way back to the very beginning

Through the eyes of God I discover
Things I can't keep all inside, I'm burning
Afterlife consumed me
My sweat is one with my bleeding
Through the eyes of God I got blinded
I can't fight my will, I may try with no change
The more he tried to make me see
The sooner my faith and my will disappear

Awake and aware but I'm lost and not found
I'm lying here still crying for more
My brain's a toy, something bound to break
Spelled by the shell of my soul

Tears are falling all over me and you
No way you can stop this crazy rain
Take a look inside of me and tell me what do you see?

Through the eyes of God I discover
Things I can't keep all inside, I'm burning
Afterlife consumed me
My sweat is one with my bleeding
Through the eyes of God I got blinded
I can't fight my will, I may try with no change
The more he tried to make me see
The sooner my faith and my will disappear

Pain, hope, trust, love and hate, joy and delusion...
All in one
Life, death, blood and tears and rage, fear
Envy, misery and faith...
Forgiveness... It can change it all...

I feel I'm coming down
I'm here, no rights to complain
My fears, my sanity...
Broke down relieving me
I feel I'm coming down
I'm here, no rights to complain
My fears, my sanity...
Broke down relieving me

Through the eyes of God I discover
Things I can't keep all inside, I'm burning
After life consumed me
My sweat is one with my bleeding
Through the eyes of God I got blinded
I can't fight my will, I may try with no change
The more he tried to make me see
The sooner my faith and my will disappear
