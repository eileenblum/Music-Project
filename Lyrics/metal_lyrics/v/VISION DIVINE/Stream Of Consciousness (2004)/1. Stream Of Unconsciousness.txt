[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Tordiglione - Lyrics:Magnani]

Tell me now
How does it feel to see you're talking with your Soul?
Your dig within
Tell me now
Is this the truth you always have been searching for?
Was it worth the price?

Through the veils of human uncertainty
Reside the nameless words we're not allowed to know
Would this veil break?
That's where your mind has gone
A trip with no return
Through the meaning of what we call... Life
