[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Tordiglione - Lyrics:Magnani]

So my life was fading to an end
With that grim sense of nothing surrounding me
My existence flowing away
Lost in the sea of Oblivion

My breath was frozen in time
Becoming eternal
A fallen angel's feather
Relied on me falling still

Through the door of the human desire
I saw the land we are all looking for
Along our lives
There's no truth, there's no lie
Simply it is
Now and forever will be
An angel there staring at me
By that door he waits for me

In the silence, silent it came
A sudden stream of consciousness
Like a river flowing aside
From deep within, beside me

A candle's light can be strong
Enough to light the deepest dark
The human will it can bring out
So strong to lead us the way

Through the door of the human desire
I saw the land we are all looking for
Along our lives
There's no truth, there's no lie
Simply it is
Now and forever will be
An Angel there staring at me
By that door he waits for me

Feelings that I can't tell heaven and hell at the same time
It's so cold here
Can't keep so much inside my thoughts are flowing out
Away from their nest to my chest

There's no black, there's no white
But all in between
The shades of a grey you can see
The colours are just a fantasy
Give my soul another me
There's so much that's left to say
Ain't gonna rush
Need time to find the right words
Need time to find the right way
Need someone to stop my rove
