[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Luppi - Lyrics:Magnani]

Ugly grim grey skies
Found a mirror with my eyes
Flowing deep inside my veins
Questions and answers
Running round and round too fast
Sliding down to my chest

Images melt in my mind
With my memories I left back
Present and future all together with past
Your holy touch ain't protecting me
Under the sand of all my tears
All that is left is a bunch of meaningless words

Shades of me and you here and then
Flying upon my daemons
Reaching for visions of the path we walk through
Shades of grey turning red
My life has run much too fast
Our flight has ended here, together we're falling again

So many traces
Of the man that I have been
Where are my golden years?
You're trying to lead me
To a point of no return
Visions melt with my memories
A breeze on my skin is drawing
Lines with the tears along my face
Scares of a crying conscience, blaming at me
Maybe I've lost my sanity
I was, I will be or I am
Whatever it is I won't be the same, that's for sure

Shades of me and you here and then
Flying upon my daemons
Reaching for visions of the path we walk through
Shades of grey turning red
My life has run much too fast
Our flight has ended here, together we're falling again

Shades of me and you here and then
Flying upon my daemons
Reaching for visions of the path we walk through
Shades of grey turning red
My life has run much too fast
Our flight has ended here
Together we're falling... Together we're falling again
