[Music:Smirnoff,Magnani - Melody:Tordiglione - Lyrics:Magnani]

Too much confusion running in my head
Memories melt down and fade
Overthrowing, new discoveries are here
Telling me the untold... Answers

A new sensation, a strange reaction to
What I feel inside myself
I see answers, I hear echoes of a life
Could it be the one I left behind

What is the secret of life? 
How many times, God you know
I try so hard to discover the way
To break down the curtain blinding my eyes

Things get clearer, I knew I would not like
Life's so hard to take sometimes
I've been living, I've been dying... Why?
Everything here's so inside out

What is the secret of life?
How many times, God you know
I try so hard to discover the way
To tear down the curtain blinding my eyes

Find another way
Gotta find another way
Break these chains
I wanna break these chains so bad
Wait another day 
I can't wait another day
Find another way
Find another way before I get crazy, before it's too late...
