Promised land,
Would you listen to the cry of a lonely man ?
Here my people are dying in vain,

Alone in the sand we've been walkin' again
After years spent in slavery...

Promised land,
We'll wait for a sign and in hope we stand,
searchin' for your holy way

To a golden horizon and now our dream
Is gonna be real...

In the land of the faith
We'll be unchained,
Free for ever...
Peace in your heart,
Peace in your mind,
Free for ever...

Promised land,
Now I can see your shape, it's so nice to smell
The breeze on my face, and I feel

My travel is near to the end, now I see
I'm ready to leave...

In the land of the faith
We'll be unchained,
Free for ever...
Peace in your heart,
Peace in your mind,
Free for ever...
