Am I dreaming ? I can't believe it...
Can't explain what I feel

Holy light, holy sight...

Talk to me, show me,
I want to see through your eyes,
Wind me, cleanse me
Vision Divine !

Revelation, now I see...
All around me nothing else than lies;

Tears by shame for your crimes...

Talk to me, show me,
I want to see through your eyes,
Wind me, cleanse me
Vision Divine !

"Centuries of wars
Then you forgot my words..."

No more lies nor false religions
Give us time to think about our sins

"Blood of innocents
Screaming for revenge..."

Saints and angels all together
Flying 'round the seven holy skies...

Holy light, holy sight...

Talk to me, show me,
I want to see through your eyes,
Wind me, cleanse me
Vision Divine !
