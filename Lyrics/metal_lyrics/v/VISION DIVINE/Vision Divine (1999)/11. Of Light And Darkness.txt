Here I am, faced to you
Tell me now whatever could I do ?
(Is than now the time to go ?)

Today I wear a face born in the falling rain
And all I need is her shape
(Where are you now ?)

Remember what I said :
"Don't ever lose your faith
When a love is true there is no end..."

Here I lay ; out of the window
Another star is falling,
Another man is dying...

God, I hear an angel knocking to my door :
He comes to wash my sins away
He comes to call my name

Remember what I said :
"Don't ever lose your faith
Now I say one day we'll meet again..."

[Girl:] "Come to me, now you see
There's no end, there's no pain..."

Remember what I said :
"Don't ever lose your faith
Now I say one day we'll meet again..."

Far away, she's waiting there for me...
[Girl:] Far away, he's coming here to me...
Far away, we'll start a new life... For ever
Dreamin' on for ever...
