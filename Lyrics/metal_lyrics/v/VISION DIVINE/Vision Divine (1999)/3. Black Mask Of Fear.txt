Can you give me some answers
I need you to help me out
Yes I need you to tell me
What there is behind.

Hear me sorrow, (I) feel so hollow
Clean my doubts, please I pray you loud
Don't you hear me ? Won't you help me ?
Talk to me, just set me free...

God I'm alone, alone with a black mask

- Black mask of fear
Wherever I go I wear this black mask

- Black mask of fear

And I lie on my bed, I listen to the silence
This is the silence of the god who knows...

Now I'm sure that
You won't ever talk to me...
I will have no peace...
What a secret
What a mystery behind
The secret of life

God I'm alone, alone with a black mask

- Black mask of fear
Wherever I go I wear this black mask

- Black mask of fear
