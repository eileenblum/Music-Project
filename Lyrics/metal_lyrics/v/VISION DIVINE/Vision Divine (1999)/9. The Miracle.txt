No, never thought it was simply fantasy,
You gotta put all your faith in me.
Come, sit down : listen to what I got to say,
That's not a story the one I'll tell...

And in this night I will tell you of my travel
That brought my mind to the holy gates of heaven

Lost, close in mystical thoughts of life and death,
Some strange reflections of a different place...
And so my spirit began a holy flight
To where I'd look at my ancient lives...

And here a light, cleansing as a holy fire
Gave me the right to proceed along with pride

Wonder of time, miracle of life,
All here is pure as the light !
Deep in my heart, calling to me,
Angels are calling my name !

No, never felt any peace like that before...
All of my troubles were dead and gone.
And every night I still hope to fly away
To where my spirit has been (again)

Will I be back ? Every night I praise an angel :
"Please take me there, I wanna stay with you
Forever..."

Wonder of time, miracle of life,
All here is pure as the light !
Deep in my heart, calling to me,
Angels are calling my name ! 

Will I be back ? Every night I praise an angel :
"Please take me there, I wanna stay with you
Forever..."

Wonder of time, miracle of life,
All here is pure as the light !
Deep in my heart, calling to me,
Angels are calling my name !
