Look for my eyes through the darkness
Calling my name to the wind
Praise me to show you my power
Greater than how you may dream...

And the clouds will turn to gray,
(A) Winter's rain fallin' cold
Tells I'll com
On the wings of the storm...

Defeated by the flowing of time
Back now to rise up again
Ready to give you a new life
A new religion to hail

And the sky will turn to gray,
You'll acclaim my name
Then I'll come
On the wings of the storm...

And a new sun will rise up from my hands
To start a reign I'll rule
On the wings of the storm...
