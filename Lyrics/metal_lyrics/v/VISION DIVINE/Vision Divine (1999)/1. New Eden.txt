I am the mighty lord of the sky
I am the one who watches over universe
Givin' you as great sign of evidence
The miracle of life

Shall you kneel down to me,
I am your reason to be...

Don't ever try to fool me with lies,
A thousand million tears you'll be cryin' out
Don't believe it's easy to hold 'em out,
No escape from my sight...

Shall you kneel down to me,
I am your reason to be...

This is the Eden I made out for you,
You'd blow it out breaking rules...

Shall you kneel down to me,
I am your reason to be...

This is the Eden I made out for you,
You'd blow it out breaking rules...
Live and respect me, worship my name
Beware of the eternal flames !
