Another Season has gone,
Silver in my hair, I close my eyes and I dream
Sit in my chair ...
And my remembers go back
To when I was strong and young...
Sun always shining on me,
On my life

Who could imagine that time
Would have been running
Without advising that life is not forever ?
We spend our lives looking for
Power and Gold
And we don't care time goes by
Like a countdown...

How would I
Like to go back,
And stop the time
That run so fast...

For ever young,
Let the time return to past
Never turning back;
For ever young,
Live forever free
Just like in my dreams.

Another year passing by,
Dust on my shoulders
Everything fading away, lost in my mind...
Near to the end of my run
Nothing remains to say,
Better stay here in my chair
Drifting in my dreams

How would I
Like to go back,
And stop the time
That run so fast...
For ever young,
Let the time return to past
Never turning back;
For ever young,
Live forever free
Just like in my dreams.
