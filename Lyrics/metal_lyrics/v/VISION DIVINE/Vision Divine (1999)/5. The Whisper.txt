I'm looking through the window,
Outside the fog is slowly flowing on the streets,
And all around in darkness,
Maybe the moon decided to fly away from here...

Who is calling ? Is it for me ?
I can hear like a breeze in my hair,
I can't believe it is real...

A strange wind blows from nothing,
The candles in my room are dead in one shot,
I feel a mystic presence,
Seems like it's coming from a different place...

What is comming, am I fooling ?
I can feel there's shape in the night,
That voice is filling my mind...

Somewhere I can hear a whisper,
Seems like it's calling my name.
Don't know where it's from,
It came so deep, that voice is raping me
Like a melody...

There is no escape from madness,
There is no hope to stop this winding whispering,
And I surrender to that,
My soul is lost without a chance to have it back :

Lost for ever, now and ever
To this magical sound that I hear,
That run so deep in my ears

Somewhere I can hear a whisper,
Seems like it's calling my name.
Don't know where it's from,
It came so deep, that voice is raping me
Like a melody...
