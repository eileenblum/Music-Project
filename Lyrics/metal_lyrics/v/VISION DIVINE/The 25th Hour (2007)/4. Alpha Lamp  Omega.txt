In a very distant time
I was made of flesh and blood
I was feeling puissant
So strong and so brave

There was nothing I could fear
My years were passing by
And the silent dust of time
Alights on me

I did not realize
How short our lives are
Into dark we jump
Once angels call our names

Distant faces of a rolling dice
Parts of the same game we leave far behind
Stop your trudging, making questions now
Youâll get the answers when alpha &amp; omega combine

Let your senses fall
Donât fear your growing haze
Listen to my secret words
And try to understand

All the Spirits you can sense
They come to give you a sign
All united here we are
To warn you now

We were what you are
You are what we were
You are what theyâll be
Still Angels call your name

Distant faces of a rolling dice
Parts of the same game we leave far behind
Stop your trudging, making questions now
Youâll get the answers when alpha &amp; omega combine

Distant faces of a rolling dice
Parts of the same game we leave far behind
Stop your trudging, making questions now
Youâll get the answers when alpha &amp; omega combine
