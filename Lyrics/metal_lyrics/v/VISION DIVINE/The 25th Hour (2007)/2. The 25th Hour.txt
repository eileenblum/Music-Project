Alone in the dark of a blue cage
I struggled against my fears
My sanity broke through an unstable
Sudden lucidity

I saw my life as a circle
Like I never did before
A grandfather clock: It was ticking
Over and overâ¦

Life: We perceived it straight like a line
Heading to the future
Life is turning around and around

A âMerry go roundâ
Where every new dayâs just the same day
24 hours to be lived
Before everything rewinds
Oh,âMerry go roundâ
Way far beyond your perception
The 25th hour came for me tonight, yeah!

And breaking the timeâ sly deceptions
I sailed through its wrinkled fold
Where spirits bound to rejection
Fumble and rove

Lies: Our lives are nothing but lies
So now Iâm pretending
Time to find out who I am, where to go

A âMerry go roundâ
Where every new dayâs just the same day
24 hours to be lived
Before everything rewind...
Oh,âMerry go roundâ
Way far beyond your perception
The 25th hour came for me tonight, yeah!

I want to break free
And open up my soul
When the hour comes I will let it in
And my doubts will be finally gone, goneâ¦

All these voices talking inside of me
Every spirit whispering to my ears
âYouâve been her, she will be you
Iâve been you, you will be me
Together we will be themâ¦â

A âMerry go roundâ
Where every new dayâs just the same day
24 hours to be lived
Before everything rewind...
Oh,âMerry go roundâ
Way far beyond your perception
The 25th hour came for me tonight, yeah!
