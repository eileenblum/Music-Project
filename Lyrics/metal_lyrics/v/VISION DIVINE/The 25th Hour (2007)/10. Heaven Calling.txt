In the air
I can only hear the freedom
The night has gone
Now I know my sins are forgiven

I stand so still
I lay on a mouldy floor
One ray, one smile
Moon, did you say goodbye?

I tried to be ready, now Iâm here
Thereâs an angel waiting
Cuddling my dreams, holding my head
Smiling at meâ¦

Heaven is calling, the angels are spreading their wings
Over the blue horizon they will fade away
Heaven is calling and I canât believe itâs my name
My father is there waiting for me

Overwhelmed I surrender to my feelings
Once again
Ainât no way to guess your decision

Goodnight my dear
Iâm ready to leave, Iâm done
One ray, one smile
Oh, Moon, did I tell you âbye?

If I ever wake up, it wonât be here
âCause my angelâs waiting
Heâs back to me, holding my head
Smiling at meâ¦

Heaven is calling, the angels are spreading their wings
Over the blue horizon they will fade away,
Heaven is calling and I canât believe itâs my name
My father is there waiting for me, for me, for me, yeahâ¦

Heaven is calling, the angels are spreading their wings
Over the blue horizon they will fade away
Heaven is calling and I canât believe itâs my name
My father is thereâ¦
