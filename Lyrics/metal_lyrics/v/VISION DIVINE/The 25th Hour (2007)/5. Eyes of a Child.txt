You man, tell me why you are so dour
Wonât you smile at me?
Look at where youâre fallen, look at what you areâ¦

Listen, I have come with a mission
To remind you
There has been a time when you were not like this

Close your eyesâ¦
Close your eyes and remember
âcause I came from the past
Iâm a painting that shows what youâve been
Years have gone by
Lost in your mind
Turn at the mirror and see with the eyesâ¦
With the eyes of a childâ¦

You man through my eyes you can go back
To your childhood
When the colors of your future were so bright

I see you forgot all the passion
Youâre so distant
From the child you were before the twilight came

Close your eyesâ¦
Close your eyes and remember
âcause I came from the past
Iâm a painting that shows what youâve been
Years have gone by
Lost in your mind
Turn at the mirror and see with the eyesâ¦
With the eyes of a childâ¦

Hey man, youâre so old
Canât you see that?
In your soul now
All your fields of passions have become so bright

Close your eyesâ¦
Close your eyes and remember
âcause I came from the past
Iâm a painting that shows what youâve been
Years have gone by
Lost in your mind
Turn at the mirror and see with the eyesâ¦
With the eyes of a childâ¦
(Close your eyesâ¦)
(Close your eyesâ¦)
Whoaâ¦ Child!!!
â¦With the eyes of a childâ¦
