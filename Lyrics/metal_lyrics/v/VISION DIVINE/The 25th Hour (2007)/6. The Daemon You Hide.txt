My name was Marielle but you can call me
Mary You see, like the others I canât fade away
Half life (half now)â¦Iâm a spirit nowâ¦
I have no home, no place where I can rest in peace

I feel an empathy with your soul
I see youâre fallen deep down with
Your fearsâ¦ Have your dreams been killed by the pain?
Your tears are digging your own grave

And the daemon you hide killed the angel you got
He tried to bring you light but you fell into darkness
All the blood that you sweat, every drop that he dried
Everything is lostâ¦ You just let him cryâ¦ You just let him dieâ¦

Out there, starsâ¦ There are millions in the universe
They seem all the same but they are different
Their lights and their different colours
They stand, theyâre still, they dieâ¦ Melting with infinity

Relieve the sorrow that you keep inside
Release whatâs left in you tonight
Escape from the branch of thorns in your heart
Beforeâ¦ Before itâs just too late

And the daemon you hide killed the angel you got
He tried to bring you light but you fell into darkness
All the blood that you sweat, every drop that he dried
Everything is lostâ¦ You just let him cryâ¦ You just let him dieâ¦

I feel the sorrow youâre keeping inside
I see whatâs left in you tonight
Escape from the wild branch of thorns in your heart
Beforeâ¦ Before itâs just too late

And the daemon you hide killed the angel you got
He tried to bring you light but you fell into darkness
All the blood that you sweat, every drop that he dried
Everything is lostâ¦ You just let him cryâ¦ You just let himâ¦
