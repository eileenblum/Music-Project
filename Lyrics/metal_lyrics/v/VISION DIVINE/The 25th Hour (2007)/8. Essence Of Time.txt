I shiver âcause you took my breath away
Unknown strange and beautiful raves of sin
Every thought you had became one with my senses
My vessel goes brought by the wind of seers

And now that I know the reason whyâ¦ Why you came to me
Part of the same continuous line we are

What is a simple life compared with the essence of time
That will never stop?
I wanna leave it all behind

Now tell me: is it true or is it just a fake?
Iâm here to live the same that youâve got before
Just a different life, just a different perception
My life was lost, I challenged the fate in vainâ¦

And now that I know the reason whyâ¦ Why you came to me
Part of the same continuous line we are

What is a simple life compared with the essence of time
That will never stop?
I wanna leave it all behind

And now leave me
I need to stay alone
Just let me breathe
And think about this world father

I wonder why
Why is it wrong?
I just want to know
How can I still stand that

Allâ¦ All that I suffered inside
Could just rewind and restart?
Noâ¦ Iâve had enough

And you, God
How can you hurt me so bad?
Didnât I pay fair enough?
Please, let me reach the dawn

I donât want this to be forever
I was lost
I just felt too much alone
I needed to believe in Heavenâ¦

âWelcome to real madness, welcome weâre with you
Open your heart, donât hold back, we came for you
Welcome to real madness, welcome weâre with you
Open your heart, donât hold back, we came for youâ

And now that I know the reason whyâ¦ Why you came to me
Part of the same continuous line we are

What is a simple life compared with the essence of time
That will never stop?
I wanna leave it all behind
â¦timeâ¦
