Two pills: Iâll be free, donât you think?
Is it the only way?
One rope for my throat âround that pole

One jump through the glass of that door
Flying down to the floor
One blade for my veins like a kiss

Time to close my eyes
Time to say goodbye
Time for some of you
To shed some hollow, deceitful tears

All my lifeâs been a joke
Plenty of misery
Iâve been chasing memories
Of the child that I keep in my mind

â¦A perfect suicideâ¦
Youâll never see me cryingâ¦
That is a fair way to close with my pain
â¦A perfect suicideâ¦
Thereâs only a way to goâ¦
Out of this world where my hopes were foreclosed and lost

I can see your eyes full of scorn
Have you ever thought
I was so afraid and desperate

You hate what you fear, thatâs the truth
Thatâs your call: Iâm done
Iâm one step closer to you

Time to close my eyes
Time to say goodbye
Time for some of you
To shed some hollow, deceitful tears

All my lifeâs been a joke
Plenty of misery
Iâve been chasing memories
Of the child that I keep in my mind

â¦a perfect suicideâ¦
Youâll never see me cryingâ¦
That is a fair way to close with my pain
â¦a perfect suicideâ¦
Thereâs only a way to goâ¦
Out of this world where my hopes were foreclosed and lost
â¦a perfect suicideâ¦
