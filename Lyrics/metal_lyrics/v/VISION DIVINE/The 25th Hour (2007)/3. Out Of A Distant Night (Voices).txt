Cold as inhuman lightâ¦
Tell me why are you calling my name
How do you knowâ¦
Who I am and where I come from?

Canât see your faces, canât see your eyes
By the light of a pale moon
Weaving a magic row to my head
I can hear all the voices inside

Voices out of a distant night
Haunting my deepest thoughts from inside to aside
Voicesâ¦ Let me hear what you got for me
Let me knowâ¦ Give me the reason why you have called
And the reason why you hide

Steps on the floor I hear
I can feel your breath upon me
A flower scent
Donât tell me Iâm raving again

Canât see your faces, canât see your eyes
By the light of a pale moon
Weaving a magic row to my head
I can hear all the voices inside

Voices out of a distant night
Haunting my deepest thoughts from inside to aside
Voicesâ¦ Let me hear what you got for me
Let me knowâ¦ Give me the reason why you have called
And the reason why you hide

Voices (Voicesâ¦)
Turning inside my head (Turning inside my headâ¦)
Voices (Voicesâ¦)
Voices around my headâ¦ (Voices around my headâ¦)

All these voices out of a distant night
Hunting my deepest thoughts from inside to asideâ¦

Canât see your faces, canât see your eyes
By the light of a pale moon
Weaving a magic row to my head
I can hear all the voices inside

Voices out of a distant night
Haunting my deepest thoughts from inside to aside
Voicesâ¦ Let me hear what you got for me
Let me knowâ¦ Give me the reason why you have called
And the reason why you hide

Voices (Voicesâ¦)
Turning inside my head (Turning inside my headâ¦)
Voices (Voicesâ¦)
Voices around my headâ¦ (Voices around my headâ¦)
