Hear my distant calling in this lonely night
It's my never-ending sorrow screaming
Hell and heaven fighting since the birth of time
I'm the Chosen One to stop this madness

Oh, like and angel I fly,
Like a demon, I cannot feel mercy inside...
Look at my eyes,
They're as cold as ice...

I'm your stream of conscience, running on your path
All of your sins now are one with the world's ones

And togheter we'll fly
To dimensions you've never seen in your life
This is the night:
Apocalypse is coming...

It's the end of the world,
On my wings of glory
I ride the last breath of time
Human kind, damned souls,
At the end of your story
You cry, but now it's too late...

Skies will turn blood red
The earth will shake
The seven seals are broken

Fire from the beast
The anti Christ
Is living his last day

It's the end of the world,
On my wings of glory
I ride the last breath of time
Human kind, damned souls,
At the end of your story
You cry, but now it's too late...

This is the end of the world...
