I have no feelings
Nothing to fear
All I was dreaming
Now looks unfair

Now just a strange pain
Comes from inside
And it keeps growing
Burning my mind

Feel the fire growing inside
It's the wild Flame Of Hate
Getting stronger, even harder
To control day by day

Into the evil
I'm getting lost
Is there an escape,
Before I'll burn

Feel the fire growing inside
It's the wild Flame Of Hate
Getting stronger, even harder
To control day by day

Feel the fire growing inside
It's the wild Flame Of Hate
Getting stronger, even harder
To control day by day
