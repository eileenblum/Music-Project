...And the, alright
Let's play the big game of life and death
You can throw your dice
I'm not scared as you see...

Odd or even: make your choise...
I'll bet with my life, as I always did!

This is the big game of life
No winners...
This is my life : Black and White
Every day I bet on it

And here we go
For this never-ending game
I'm not going to stop
I have nothing to lose

All the sheets are on the table
Choose it right or you can lose your dreams....

This is the big game of life
No winners...
This is my life : Black and White
Every day I bet on it

again you'll let me win
To give me the illusion I can scape the fate

"You said it right, I like to play
But keep it in your mind, you're still mine..."

This is the big game of life
No winners...
This is my life : Black and White
Every day I bet on it
