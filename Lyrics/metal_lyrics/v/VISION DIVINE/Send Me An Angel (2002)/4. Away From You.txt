I'm on the run, the air is so cold around
I watch the sun goin' down...
I am alone, alone with my soul
And I will run 'till tomorrow...

The further I run,
The more I fell alive
The quicker I will forget

Far away... far away
I fell I have to go....
Far away, far away
I am away from you !

And while I walk I look at the past
Each step I am leaving behind
And for the first time I fell alright
Now life is mine onde again

No direction to go
No goals to reach now
One voice to trust that's my own

Far away... far away
I fell I have to go....
Far away, far away
I am away from you !

When the daylight comes
Then I will stop my run
And maybe I'll be a new man

Far away... far away
I fell I have to go....
Far away, far away
I am away from you !
