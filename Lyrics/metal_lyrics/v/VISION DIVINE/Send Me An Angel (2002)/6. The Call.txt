Every night they're coming,
When my eyes are cloasing and I'm alone...
Hear the call,
Hear its magic sound
Winding all around me 

I fall
In a new dimension never known
I'm lost
Once again you kept my soul

Running back to dreamland
While voices call me, call me!
Memories from my past life
There's no way out...
... and the night is coming...

In the night they're calling
I see their shapes appearing, on the walls
And I know
Once again they "ll have me
Once again I'm haunted

I fall
In a new dimension never known
I'm lost
Once again you kept my soul

Running back to dreamland
While voices call me, call me!
Memories from my past life
There's no way out...

Is it just an illusion?
Or am I driving mad?
