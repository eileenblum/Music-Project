t's getting cold outside
The same as in my life
Now that we are going to say goodbye...

The future, how will be?
I got no certainty
But it hurts so much to me

Always, you will be here inside my heart
The taste of a goodbye
A message in a lie...

It seems like yesterday,
The beauty of your smile
And we were like two shining stars...

And now we say goodbye
A new future to realize
And a new life to live alone...

Always, you will be here inside my heart
The taste of a goodbye
A message in a lie...

Always, you will be here inside my heart
The taste of a goodbye
A message in a lie...
