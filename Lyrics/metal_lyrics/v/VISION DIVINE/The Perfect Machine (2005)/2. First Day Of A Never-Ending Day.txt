Come on here with me
Listen to my words...
You don't have to close your eyes
There's a cry coming from a new world

A new age I have dreamt before is our destiny
Everything you ever wanted won't die, end or fall

Take your life in your hands, my son
Now it's time that you take control
Live it just like it is...
Don't let it wait too long

Right here, right now
Your first day of a never-ending day
Right here reach out in this never-ending life
No complains or regrets in your head

Just to save your life
I fought against time
I can tell God's never cared
Never listened to my cries and my prayers

Someone said that I lost my soul
We're all partners in crime
Just to be part of a Sin
Death won't waltz to our side

Take your life in your hands, my son
Now it's time that you gain control
Live it just like it is...
Don't let it wait too long

Right here, right now
Your first day of a never-ending day
Right here reach out in this never-ending life
All complains and regrets right behind
Right here, right now
Your first day of a never-ending day
Right here reach out in this never-ending life
Your first day on a brand new world in front of you

When dreams are too distant from our real life
You have to try harder
Believe in yourself
No one else can grab your tomorrow
Where are you God?
The stars are shining on and on

Where have you been?
That night that I called for your sign?
(I called for your sign...)
I was crying, I was bleeding
Remember my crying... "Just save him, save his life tonight"
You won't take the blame
But now I take his life back
I'm taking it back...
I'm taking it back...
I'm taking it back...

Right here, right now
Your first day of a never-ending day
Right here reach out in this never-ending life
No complains or regrets in your head

Right here, right now
Your first day of a never-ending day
Right here reach out in this never-ending life
Your first day on a brand new world in front of you...
...In front of you...
