God, powerful God
Are your sons getting free?
God, uh... Powerful Lord
Don't you hear their screams?

Screams, for what they achieved
The final frontier
Where, at the end of the run
We'll all have our prize

We've run through the waves of the Centuries
Repeating the story itself
To give our existence a future
To give others time to succeed

(In my Blood)
And now I'm the last of the sequence that started
How many million years ago? Who knows...
(In my Blood)
Gathering the teaching of masters who shared their knowledge
With all the children 'round the world
In our veins still flows a part of our ancestors' blood

God, powerful God
Don't you see it's time to
Go, uh... For all of your sons?
We just want to walk alone

We've run through the waves of the Centuries
Repeating the story itself
To give our existence a future
To give others time to succeed

(In my Blood)
And now I'm the last of the sequence that started
How many million years ago? Who knows...
(In my Blood)
Gathering the teaching of masters who shared their knowledge
With all the children 'round the world
In our veins still flows a part of our ancestors' blood

We've run through the waves of the Centuries
Repeating the story itself
To give our existence a future
To give others time to succeed

(In my Blood)
And now I'm the last of the sequence that started
How many million years ago? Who knows...
(In my Blood)
Gathering the teaching of masters who shared their knowledge
With all the children 'round the world
In our veins still flows a part of our ancestors' blood
...Your blood...
