If I try to realize the great time we're living in
To forget the fear I've been hiding
In a broken theater I'm playing my last act

I fall shaking and start to recall
If it's a dream don't take me back
Don't wake me up back to my sorrow
Where the grim gray melts with pain

All this time, every day
Afraid to face my latest day
Then you came, and you said
"No, I won't let you fall away"

We're leaving from a land of Fear
Looking for more
We're just leaving from this old world
We're leaving from a land of Fear
Admire this new dawn
We're heading for a new horizon
We're leaving from a land of Fear
Tell me... How do you feel?
Take my hand I won't let you go away
We're leaving from a land of Fear
Where your dreams were so dark
Leave this old world apart...

Take me away from the dark, it slowly surrounds me
Where the sun rays will blaze on me
Take me away from this earth rejecting me

Down here my body weakens and falls
Withering slowly, heart and soul
I need you now, now and tomorrow
Let me dream a little more...

Let me breathe, let me cry
Don't let go this heart of mine
Let me feel, let me hear
Yeah, your voice hushing my despair

We're leaving from a land of Fear
Looking for more
We're just leaving from this old world
We're leaving from a land of Fear
Admire this new dawn
We're heading for a new horizon
We're leaving from a land of Fear
Tell me... How do you feel?
Take my hand I won't let you go away
We're leaving from a land of Fear
Where your dreams were so dark
Leave this old world apart...

I'm leaving from a land of Fear
Tell me... How do you feel?
I won't let you go away from me
I'm leaving from a land of Fear
Where your dreams were so dark
Leave this old world apart...
