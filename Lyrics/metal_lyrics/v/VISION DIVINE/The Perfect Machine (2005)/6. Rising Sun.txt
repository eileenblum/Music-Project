Father tell me, you still there, or not?
I seem like a clown, I know
I didn't ever know if I could trust in you
And now I'm looking for you

But the world is unfold to dark
And future stops, hidden by a mysterious veil
Everybody looks so unreal
All those faces with no smiles
Only hopes rolling deeper in the night

And nothing can give me enough just to make me feel
Like a hunger that's burning deep inside
I thought I got everything
But everything went away from me

Maybe we feel we own something
Maybe... And new emotions come
Only when they come from nothing, out of rules
Maybe we feel we lost something
And maybe... How can we feel the joy
Of a rising sun announcing the new day?

It's so hard to say I'm sorry, sometimes,
Still don't see the reason why
But this apathy is running on, you see
Where have I lead this World?

Now tell me... Where has all of my science gone?
We're returning to the Golden Age but the honey is bad
Why don't we invest our time just to get to eternity?
Our needs and promises we've lost...

And nothing can give me enough just to make me feel
Like a hunger that's burning deep inside
I thought I got everything
But everything went away from me

Maybe we feel we own something
Maybe... And new emotions come
Only when they come from nothing, out of rules
Maybe we feel we lost something
And maybe... How can we feel the joy
Of a rising sun announcing the new day?
Maybe we feel we own something
Maybe... And new emotions come
Only when they come from nothing, out of rules
Maybe we feel we lost something
Oh, maybe... How can we feel the joy
Of a rising sun announcing the new day?

Maybe we feel we own something
And maybe... And a new emotion comes
Only when it comes from nothing, out of rules

Maybe we feel we lost something...

And nothing can give me enough just to make me feel
Like a hunger that's burning deep inside
I thought I got everything
But everything went away from me
