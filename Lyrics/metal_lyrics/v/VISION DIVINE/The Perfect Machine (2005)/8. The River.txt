Into the folds of time, crossing the great river
There is a holy ground hard to be found

This ground is so mellow
That many are the ones who rowed
In search for their own piece to sow
But nobody could know the right way to go

All these people have been searching
For a place with no direction
And no boundaries to be found
For this land is not outside yet
You can find it right beside you
Feel the stream of your consciousness

Now that you rowed
For so long in the wrong river, where there was no land to wait for you all
Well, I hope you understand
Well, that eternal life has no sense with no feelings or goals to reach
Don't ever cross that line

In every love-story
There is a dark page where everything goes wrong and hate takes its place
And dying inside you swear you won't sail for that river of passion
From which fount you drank
You're just fooling yourself

Another week and you'll forget it
Another month and you'll be searching
For that wellspring, again
Can you leave it all behind you?
Can you avoid to sail this river?
Tell me where the fun lies in this game of yours...

Now that you rowed
For so long in the wrong river, where there was no land to wait for you all
Well, I hope you understand
Well, that eternal life has no sense with no feelings or goals to reach
Don't ever cross that line

If you look right deep in your heart
I know you can make it, together we'll cross it tonight my son
I will be there by your side
Call my name, once again...

If you look right deep in your heart
I know you can make it, together we'll cross it tonight my son
I will be there by your side
Call my name, once again...

If you look right deep in your heart
I know you can make it, together we'll cross it tonight my son
I will be there by your side
Call my name, once again...
