"...therefore, I confirm you a new era for humankind is about to begin.
A new era, where illness and most of all death will be no more.
Hail this new dawn, all of you! Finally we turned Man...
into The Perfect Machine!"

Welcome to a new dawn
A new era begins today
Now new future calls
And we are the ones, yes
It's calling our names

Welcome to your new world
We can build it together... Day by day
Now we have all the time
And no need to rush, we won't be late

We're taking down our heavens
Here, where it was supposed to be
Here on Earth, where humans will live forever free

Days will be Months, Months will be years
We'll be together, standing here
Waiting for another day
(Waiting for another day)
Tonight we will forget our fears, we'll turn'em into pride
I made it true, I made it real
The Perfect Machine's here

Ever since my first breath
I felt like a dying butterfly
In the space of a day
Livin' it's full satisfying new life

In the space of our years
We cheat ourselves to escape our fate
'Till the moment arrives
Showing our lives last no longer than a day

Old days are gone forever
I wanna freeze my life so that
Through this whole new age my existence can go on...

Days will be Months, Months will be years
We'll be together, standing here
Waiting for another day
(Waiting for another day...)
Tonight we will forget our fears, we'll turn'em into pride
I made it true, I made it real
The Perfect Machine's here

Let's go my friends, I came just for you
The days gone by... Let's turn this page of doom
It's time to try... Time for you to set it right
(Time for you to set it right...)
To take our dreams and don't let'em go, never let'em go

Open your windows of fantasy
And welcome this new vibe coming on right for you
Like a whole new life... Like a whole new life
Now we're coming here to stay

Days will be Months, Months will be years
We'll be together, standing here
Waiting for another day
(Waiting for another day...)
Tonight we will forget our fears, we'll turn'em into pride
I made it true, I made it real
The Perfect Machine's here

Days will be Months, Months will be years
We'll be together, standing here
Waiting for another day
(Waiting for another day...)
Tonight we will forget our fears, we'll turn'em into pride
I made it true, I made it real
The Perfect Machine's here
