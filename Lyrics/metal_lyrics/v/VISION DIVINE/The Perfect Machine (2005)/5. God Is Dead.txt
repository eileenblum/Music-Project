I assume I'll disappear...

How dare you to drive me away?
So you think you can live without me...
I may not deserve your love...
Alright then, you got it

Come to me, my faithful sons
Angels, close the gates of Heaven
Seal them "Seven Seven Seven"
Let 'em get just what they want

Don't you call my name, I won't answer
You won't find me right there by your side
From now on you're just left on your own
Take your freedom, now I'm done
Don't look for my presence in Churches
They're no longer my home anymore
Just take your new life, and live on your own
Yeah, here's the news for you... God is dead!

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Like it was meant to be
So you think you found the key
And own all the answers

Come to me, my faithful sons
Angels, close the gates of Heaven
Seal them "seven seven seven"
Let 'em get just what they want

Don't you call my name, I won't answer
You won't find me right there by your side
From now on you're just left on your own
Take your freedom, now I'm done
Don't look for my presence in Churches
They're no longer my home anymore
Just take your new life, and live on your own
Yeah, here's the news for you... God is dead!

Don't you call my name, I won't answer
You won't find me right there by your side
From now on you're just left on your own
Take your freedom, now I'm done
Don't look for my presence in Churches
They're no longer my home anymore
Just take your new life, and live on your own
(On your own...)
Yeah, here's the news for you... God is dead!
Yeah!!!
