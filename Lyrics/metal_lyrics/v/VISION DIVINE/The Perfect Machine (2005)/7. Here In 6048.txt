Here, in 6048
Where the future is so real
Where everything should be so great

No more dying or diseases
There is nothing left to fear
And everything should be so fair

We're looking like fallen heroes, we can't slip away
Eternal life made us forget the reason why we're here

Tell me, tell me, where I've gone
God, you don't need to lie
Look into my eyes
Tell me, tell me what is love
I can't remember
My heart' so weak

Here in 6048
We all have lost our faith
And nothing matters to me, to us...

Joy, Fear, love and hate
Are feelings we can't taste
There ain't nothing left we need to hold

We're looking like fallen heroes, we can't slip away
(We can't slip away...)
Eternal life made us forget the reason why we're here
Just tell me why I'm here...

Tell me, tell me, where I've gone
God, you don't need to lie
Look into my eyes
(Look into my eyes...)
Tell me, tell me what is love
I can't remember
My heart' so weak

Tell me, tell me, where I've gone
(You've gotta tell me...)
God, you don't need to lie
Look into my eyes
Tell me, tell me what is love
I can't remember
My heart' so weak, so weak, so weak, so weak...
