[Lyrics: Magnani]

Destination set to nowhere
Out there I'm gonna fly
Let the vessel sail a new way
It's time to say goodbye

In this moonlight I will fade in silence
Where the darkness melts with the horizon
Into the unknown... I'm on my way

Destination set to nowhere
Who knows what will come
No direction set before me
Lonely my destiny called

In this moonlight I will fade in silence
Where the darkness melts with the horizon
Into the unknown... I'm on my way

Destination set to nowhere
Out there I'm gonna fly
Let the vessel sail a new way
It's time to say goodbye
