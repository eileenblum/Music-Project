[Music: Lucatti, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Magnani]

Maybe It's the human nature pushing people to want more
Maybe you just can't get by with what you have, who knows
Once again it's all the same
Then I guess you'll never learn
To live in peace without complaints

I can't stand it anymore
This was not the plan I drew
This ain't what we came here for
Fire in Eden once again
Who will take the blame now?
You took this heaven down, digging your own grave
Fire in Eden once again
Tell me where you run now?
Wherever you may go things won't change
'cause the sin is you...you are the sin

In the end it's all a failure, I can only feel the shame
For the people like you living with no peace, no smiles...
You're the proof that God was right
When he kicked us out of Eden the first time
You'll never learn...

I can't stand it anymore
This was not the plan I drew
This ain't what we came here for

Fire in Eden once again
Who will take the blame now?
You took this heaven down, digging your own grave
Fire in Eden once again
Tell me where you run now?
Wherever you may go things won't change
'cause the sin is you...you are the sin

[May you all be damned! You quickly turned this heaven into the
same hell we all left. There won't be any other chance, and anyway
it would be just useless to try. Go on with your stupidity, see this
new world falling down and be happy, while we all die here!]
