[Music: Magnani, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Magnani]

If I could take a piece of time and save it under glass
To make it stay, to make it last forever
If I could change my state of mind
And freeze my thoughts like ice
And be like tonight, whenever I feel the need for peace

I would choose this night to get lost in my dreams
To release my mind forever free

Message to home, letter from far away
From a distant sky
Just a few lines into the dark fall
Look at the sky,
One of the million lights you see at night
Is our home, it's where we live right now

If I could stop the flowing of life
And live like in a picture, frozen in time
I'd surely choose it to be today

I would choose this night to get lost in my dreams
To release my mind forever free

Message to home, letter from far away
From a distant sky
Just a few lines into the dark fall
Look at the sky,
One of the million lights you see at night
Is our home, it's where we live right now

[What a heaven! Everything's so perfect here. A new planet to be explo-
red, no pollution, no sort of troubles in sight. It's all ours and here we
can build our lives once again, the way we want it, like a second chance
for our sons and the next generations that will come. I feel as if we've
entered right into the house of the angels...]
