[Lyrics: Magnani]

Open your eyes and you will see
The world is falling
While they continue telling lies
They rule this world pretending smiles
But here we're dying
And still they try to keep you blind

I'm no more believing
The lies they tell to keep their power
I want to leave
When tomorrow comes I won't be here
Come with me
It's a new world I'm searching

I'll give you a life
Just tell me what you need
Your hopes will be mine
I'll give you a smile
Just tell me what you dream
I'm gonna make it real

Over the horizon we will fade
This world is over
Beyond the Stars We'll fly tonight
We leave this planet falling down
Our fate is calling
Turn on the engines don't you cry

We're no more believing
The lies they tell to keep their power
Just empty lies
Time to raise your heads and scream "NO MORE"
'cause out there there's a new world
We'll find it

I'll give you a life
Just tell me what you need
Your hopes will be mine
I'll give you a smile
Just tell me what you dream
I'm gonna make it real

[Finally, we took off! While the Earth becomes smaller and smaller
behind us, we all know that we won't ever see our homes no our
friends anymore. Goodbye: we choose freedom and we're ready to
fly beyond the sun!]
