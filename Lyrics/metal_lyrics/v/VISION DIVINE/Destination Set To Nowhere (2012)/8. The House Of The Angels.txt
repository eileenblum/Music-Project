[Lyrics: Magnani]

Open these doors, after many years in space

I wanna breathe fresh healthy air,
I want to walk over the green grass
I want to go where the water runs so clear
From a river I will drink then I will sleep
Here in this silence

I will dream of a adistant world lost in space
Then I'll wake up and smile
Warmth by the sun rising

Here we are, to the heaven's doors we came
We just want to be angels
From the sky with our broken wings we fall
In the house of the angels

We will live here, we will leave our kids a world
Free from politicians and stupid laws.
We are free now!
In this new world we have found our promised land
We can build our destiny,
We can hope for a new future

I will dream of a distant world lost in space
Then I'll wake up and smile
Warmth by the sun rising

Here we are, to the heaven's doors we came
We just want to be angels
From the sky with our broken wings we fall
In the house of the angels

[I knew it: not even one year has passed since when we arrived, and once
again it's all the same. People started to claim their own properties,
building fences all around and getting greedy, even if this world is way
too big for the few of us. They already talk like the old politicians we left
on Earth, trying to get more and more power and starting to arrange
themsleves into parties and trying to get more power over the
others. Now I understand the warning I got in my dream the day
before we found this planet: it's in our own nature to be greedy,
and it doesn't matter how far and how fast we will run: the sin
will always follow us, cause we are the sin!]
