[Music: Magnani, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Magnani]

In the silence of my room
If I close my eyes I can hear voices like a whisper
Someone's calling
Like old mermaids from their moons
Singing melodies to those who pass by,
Then surrender
My reason's falling, falling, falling...

Silent's the empty dark cosmos
As silent we sail through the stars
The planets seem like lost islands
Floating in a transient sea
Like Ulysses and his sailors
Now we face our Odyssey
Roaming lost we search a harbor
Trying to keep our sanity

In the silence of my room
If I close my eyes I can hear voices like a whisper
Someone's calling
Like old mermaids from their moons
Singing melodies to those who pass by,
Then surrender
My reason's falling, falling, falling...

Time in our cabins goes slowly
All we can do is to wait and hope

Like Ulysses and his sailors
Now we face our Odyssey
Roaming lost we search a harbor
Trying to keep our sanity

In the silence of my room
If I close my eyes I can hear voices like a whisper
Someone's calling
Like old mermaids from their moons
Singing melodies to those who pass by,
Then surrender
My reason's falling, falling, falling ...

[Solo]

Like Ulysses and his sailors
Now we face our Odyssey
Roaming lost we search a harbor
Trying to keep our sanity

In the silence of my room
If I close my eyes I can hear voices like a whisper
Someone's calling
Like old mermaids from their moons
Singing melodies to those who pass by,
Then surrender
My reason's falling, falling, falling ....

[I don't know if I've turned completely mad, but yeterday I had a dream:
in this dream, a child (or an angel, I don't know), talked to me and he
clearly told me our trip is almost over. When I woke up today, I just
went to the control room of the Elpis and I saw that big light over there,
right in front of us. We'll soon find our if it was just a trick of my broken
mind or a real vision, but in case it was all true, then I also wonder
why, before waking up, this angel or child warned me about the human
nature of men, before fading away with a sad face...]
