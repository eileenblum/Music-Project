[Music: Magnani, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Magnani]

In the night he called my name, I cannot forget
Face of a child, Angel eyes
In my dream he said today we'll find the way
For the new world we've been craving
Nothing more, then a sign out there
"Follow the light, you will find it"

A lighthouse in the dark
Like an answer to your many prayers
You'll find salvation
A lighthouse in the dark
Like and anchor in a stormy sea
Showing you all the way

The last words the angel said, made him change his face
From a big smile he turned grey
"You don't know the human race, your big mistake.
You'll see what I mean with your eyes"

Nothing more, then a sign out there
"follow the light, you will find it"

A lighthouse in the dark
Like an answer to your many prayers
You'll find salvation
A lighthouse in the dark
Like an anchor in a stormy sea
Showing you all the way

[HOME! After so many years, I cannot believe it. While all of the crew
members are excited and use the capsules to leave the spaceship and to
land on the new planet. I am the last one still aboard. I ordered Elpis to
turn everything off and to get ready for the stand-by in orbit, but before
leaving myself to reach the new planet, I felt like writing a message on a
sheet of peper, like the old mariners used to do. I put it into a bottle and
I shot it in the direction of the Earth, even though I know that nobody will
ever read it. This was my very last message to my old home...]
