[Music: Magnani, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Magnani]

I left my home with a vision
With a new world to be built
I took with me many people
All with the same will to succeed

All now has fallen down
Gone, destroyed by your greed... Your greed

I see you fail and I cry
Can you tell me why
Tears for this dream falling down
While here we all die

This is the end of a future
We'd have made perfect for good
We held our destiny in our hands
You made it blow once and for all

All now has fallen down
Gone, destroyed by your greed... Your greed

I see you fail and I cry
Can you tell me why
Tears for this dream falling down
While here we all die

[I've taken my decision: I used a capsule to go back to my spaceship.
I'm alone here, and alone I will leave. me being alone is the only way
to find peace, then alone I will be, forever. People do not realize that
the good and the evil is right inside each one of us. If we could all be
just and honest, there would be no need of police, borders, money,
laws and politicians. There needs themselves are the declaration of
an announced failure, a failure which I refuse to witness.
Let's go, my dear Elpis, after all it's only you and me left, now.
no need for any route set, just go: destination set to nowhere...]
