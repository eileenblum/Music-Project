[Music: Magnani, Tordiglione, Lucatti]
[Lyrics: Magnani]

We fly at light speed into the universe
The Earth is so far, our homes are empty
We break through the silence cradling the galaxy
Sailing this ocean of stars and planets

Searching for a land to claim
For a place we can call home once more, maybe
In this never-ending night every time we spot a light
We hold our breath in silence

Roaming in space
If There's a home we will find it
Calling from space
We're here, can't you see?

And while our small lives sturggle with our fears
We face the deep space, we hear it's calling
It calls for a new hope, hope for a future
Into this darkness we follow a bright light

It's the light of our hope
Guiding us in search for home, we will find it
In this never-endintg night every time we spot a light
We hold our breathe in silence

Roaming in space
If There's a home we will find it
Calling from space
We're here, can't you see?

[Such a long way, such a long time. Even if we knew it since the
very beginning, being lost in space for all these years is a hard
thing mining our sanity. We almost lost the hope and all this
silence is giving me strange feelings; sometimes, when I close
myself into my room trying to fall asleep. I think about Ulysses and
his never ending trip on the way back home... cometimes I even
seem to hear voices calling me from out there, just like mermaids
calling us from their moons...]
