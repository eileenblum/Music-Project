I lie with blackened chest
Tears, dense, welling in swollen eyes
Resplendent in winterÂ´s ash
My God be upheld in our distress
My cries fill the air
Domine libera manes defunctorum
Winter envelopes
I lie with blackened chest
Tears, dense, welling in swollen eyes
Resplendent in winterÂ´s ash
Where is my God, in the dull ear of night?
With tuneless voice, a requiem sung
Wailing and breadless, alone
On a flower strewn earth
Where is my God?
Look at me, upon my bruised head
Taste my ruin, my ashen soul
I tread alone
Winter envelopes
