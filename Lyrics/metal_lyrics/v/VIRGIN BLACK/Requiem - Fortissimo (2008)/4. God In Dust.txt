Bring me deep, oh death devour
Cover me with darkness
And paint me like death
I drown in remembrance
I am blind with weeping
And will mourn until death
Place the hand of God in dust
I am suffering, I am blind
I am made blind with weeping
And I will mourn until death
I tread alone
I am suffering, I am blind
Place the hand of God in dust
I am in the dust, but there I find You
Misery calls, in the dark night of the soul
Abandonment, carries me home
Carry me home.
