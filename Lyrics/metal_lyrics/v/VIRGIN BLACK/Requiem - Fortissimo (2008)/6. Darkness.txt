Misery calls
My blood has died
And marked my eyes with stains perpetual
Blood has died
Lifeless life cradles dust
Trembling, quantus tremos est futurus
Fading, judgement is at hand
Darkness
I drink deep into the soul
Drink deep into your soul
I am made blind with weeping
I drink deep into your soul
Drink deep into your soul
My blood has died
Blood has died
Lifeless life cradles dust
Trembling, quantus tremos est futurus
Fading, judgement is at hand
Darkness
My God, save us, O death
Sorrow ever await on joy
And has rendered me (to pieces)
Requiem, Kyrie, requiem
My God, exhort, to not merely draw air.
But breath the skies.
