Amorous eyes, crippling word I bring
Grief vents itself more violently
The hour of parting is at hand
Hope, your warmth failed
The famished are here, forsaken
Fleeting, fading, the fragile
Fading, the fragile
It drinks deep into the soul
Drinks deep into the soul
Fleeting, fading, the fragile
It drinks deep into my soul
Drinks deep into my soul
Drink me deep
