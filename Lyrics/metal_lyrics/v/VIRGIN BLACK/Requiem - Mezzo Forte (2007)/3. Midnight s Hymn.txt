To my head I raise a wreath of white flowers
and cry unhappiness
my mournful valediction
I drink deep into your soul
Thanatos Kyrie elesion
I tread Alone
Bowed and stooping figure
Tears standing in my eyes
Icons waver in my vision
I grieve as the dirge is sung
To my head I raise a wreath of white flowers
and cry unhappiness
my mournful valediction
I drink deep into your soul
Thanatos Kyrie elesion
