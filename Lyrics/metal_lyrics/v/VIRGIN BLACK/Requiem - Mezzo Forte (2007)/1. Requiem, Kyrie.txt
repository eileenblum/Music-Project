The hour of parting is at hand
sorrow ever awaits on joy
and has rendered me to (pieces)
drink me deep
o death devour
cover me with darkness
paint me like death
I drown in remembrance
Sorrow ever awaits joy
and has rendered me to (pieces)
Requiem, Kyrie, Requiem
I drown in remembrance
sorrow ever awaits on joy
and has rendered me to (pieces)
Requiem, Kyrie, Requiem
