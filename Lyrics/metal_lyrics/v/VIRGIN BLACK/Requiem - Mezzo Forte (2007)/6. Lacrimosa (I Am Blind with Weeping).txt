The hour of judgement is at hand
the hour of judgement is...
Lord be upheld in our distress
The hour of judgement is...
All fall silent, all fall
Lacrimosa, dies illa
Lacrimosa, dies illa
All fall silent, the hour is at hand
Libera eis Domine, (de poenis)
Lord be upheld in our distress
The hour of judgement is...
