O misery you live
I have been struck and am suffering
O misery you live
You take bread from hands
that hold so little
And show treason to a faithful heart
There is no healing balm of reason
O wretchedness, o misery
Fall upon mercy
Set thy Alter here
Lifeless life cradles lifeless death
Set thy alter here
Fall Upon Mercy
O wretchedness O misery
O Misery you live
I have been struck and am suffering
O Misery you live
O misery you live in death
Exaudi orationem (meam)
Quantus tremor est furturus
Exaudi orationem (meam)
The hour is at, parting is at hand
the hour is at hand
The Hour is at, parting is at...
