Dies illa, dies irae
Dies illa, dies irae
The hour is at...
Loss and grief in chorus
chime forth their canticles
Loss and grief
Dies illa, dies irae
The hour is at hand
Sorrow ever awaits on joy, Domine
Sorrow ever awaits on joy
Judgement is at hand
All flesh is barren
Al souls subject
Quantus tremor est futurus
Quantus tremor
Judgement is at hand
Requiem
Domine
