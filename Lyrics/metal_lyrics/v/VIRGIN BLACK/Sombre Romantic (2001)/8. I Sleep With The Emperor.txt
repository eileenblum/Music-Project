I shivered
in the warmth of their god
Yet this mansion
is haunted by romance
His servants heal my scars
Anointing me with oil
I am naked and silk on this eve
His body will cradle his bride's
in frailty as I await his kiss
mortality ebbs from me
The pendulum sings
Twelve times it rings
I sleep with the emperor
