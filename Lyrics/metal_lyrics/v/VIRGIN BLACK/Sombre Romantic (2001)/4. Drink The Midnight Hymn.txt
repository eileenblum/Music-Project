Under a serene sky
Earth covers your gentle form
in verdant fields
Soul is reft from bodies
To my head I raise
A wreath of white flowers
And cry "Unhappiness"
My mournful valediction
I drink deep into your soul
Killed with hate
You died with love
The cry of my heart
The cry of my soul
Dreamless sleeper
Your face, the grave will change
Your blood poured
liked your saviour's
I drink the midnight hymn
