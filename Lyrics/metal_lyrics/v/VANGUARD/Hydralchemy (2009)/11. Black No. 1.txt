[Bonus Track][originally by Type O Negative]I went looking for trouble and boy, I found her

She's in love with herself
She likes the dark
On her milk white neck
The Devil's mark
Now it's all Hallows Eve
The moon is full
Will she trick or treat
I bet she will

She will
(happy Halloween baby)

She's got a date at midnight
With Nosferatu
Oh baby, Lilly Monster
Ain't got nothing on you
Well when I called her evil
She just laughed
And cast that spell on me
Boo Bitch Craft

Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye em black
Oh dye em black
Black black black black no. 1
Black black black black no. 1

Little wolf skin boots
And clove cigarettes
An erotic funeral
For which she is dressed
Her perfume smells like
Burning leaves
Everyday is Halloween

Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye em black
Oh dye em black
Black black black black no. 1
Black black black black no. 1

Loving you was like loving the dead
