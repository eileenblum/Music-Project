The sky shall fall on me from high above
The earth shall swallow me from down below
The fire will follow me until I'm ash
The seas encircle me until I'm with the flow

Recoil in searing pain
Release all hope and fear
Reject the myth and lies
Rejoice - immortal sin

The hails will batter me until I'm gone
The storms will chase me throughout my path
The typhoid strikes me when I'm on my knees
The swarms engulf me until I am out of breath

Can you be the same
No
Will you take the blame
No

Can you bow in shame
No
Will you call his name
No
