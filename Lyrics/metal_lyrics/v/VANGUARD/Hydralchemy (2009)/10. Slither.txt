Slither gently around your wrists
Let it pull entwined your bliss

Around the waist and amid your breasts
Down the back to give you rest

Sightless vision flashed ablaze
Lash of pain your kingdom raze

Arched back lockdown overturned
Secret crests forever burned

Inside out the soul is bared
The deepest stormy seas are dared
Wanting the rapture of insanity

Entwined, entangled, ecstasy
Seduced, submission, symmetry
Heartfelt passion set astray
Skin-deep sins now cast away

Highest of the highs we'll reach
And this sinful heart of woe beseech
Link to touch to sensation to lust
Wax to skin, temptation to sin

Forceful love deep subjugate
Dauntless will - no debate

Slip the knot that holds you tight
Bringing pleasure as you fight
