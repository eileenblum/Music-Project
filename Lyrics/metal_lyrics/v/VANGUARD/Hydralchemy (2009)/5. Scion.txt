I feel you, you're out there
You're fighting - you're losing
I'll find you, I'll take you
I'll help you, I'll heal you

I taste you, you're bleeding
You're leading this same ancient way
I call you, now hear me
You cannot fight this anymore

Ever struggle you had
And every downfall you've felt
Has had its reason
For every hand life has dealt

Please feel my need for you and come to me this night
Life has almost drained me out - find refuge by my side
See that my love is real and let me take you in
The need to bleed grows strong in me - I'll free you from your sin

See your land surround you
You let your legacy grow old
The shadows draw near us
Our foes are now becoming bold
