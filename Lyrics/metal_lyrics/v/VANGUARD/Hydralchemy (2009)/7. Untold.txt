You never knew the bliss I'm saving for you
What would I gladly have offered to borrow
Another truth I've kept in my heart from you
Having lost every privilege of sorrow

It's a dream that will never come true
It's a dream that will never ever be
It's a dream that will never come true
It's a life that you have taken from me

Now here I lie, I'm bleeding my world away
You lead a frontier of desolate sorrow
And now I know that life you have drained in a day
Unmourned by a negligent widow

You and I will never ever be
How can it be so hard to set me free

Now you know all that brings hope and pain
And will now lead you from salvation
Give warmth and shelter to us all

You and I will never ever be
How can it be so hard to set me free

Now you know all that brings hope and pain
And will now lead you from damnation
Give warmth and shelter to us all

You and I will never ever be
Please set me free
Why won't you see
