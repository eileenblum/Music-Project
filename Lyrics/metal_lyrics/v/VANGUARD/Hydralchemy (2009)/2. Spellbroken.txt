I can't feel anymore
Your breath on my skin
Your calling has taken
Everything from me

I will not answer for
What I have seen
Your falling has broken
All that there would have been

For you see we are made of stars
And now our hunger burns as bright
You are the light of my night sky
And now we're so close apart

I want to hide just to be found
I want to try just to fail
I want to love just to break my heart
I want to die just to live again

Fight the force of apathy

Fortify and enshrine bereaved memories
Gleam and shine, now all gone
Lost utopia

Storm the gates, make a noise
Please hurt me again

You roam high above without veils of reality
And I'm forced to walk where the living haunt the dead

Heartbound
Spellbroken
