Your mind will burn as you may learn
Where the answers lie
The question raised, the psyche amazed
Revealed by hand to eye
The deepest well
Erudition at your fingertips
An ancient spell
Catechism
Afterlife eclipse

A silent soliloquy

Why should I always hear lies

Don't ask the age old axiom, if you don't need to know
The price to pay without belief will then possess your soul

The planchette driven enigma board
That whispers in your hand
Leads you to the one abhorred
The one beyond this land

Hear me all gods of eternity

Surging through your fingertips
The thousand year old lie
Raising veils of clarity, misting in reply

Vexing tease, rectitude
Blinded by one's greed
Gospel word, fallacy
All else supersede
