My every heartbeat belongs to thee
For every blink of an eye punish me
For your touch I'll walk through hell
In purgatory fire my soul to sell

Mistress, empress, goddess, temptress
I worship, I adore, I'm helpless, I am yours
Your highness, my liege, your majesty, my dream
I worship, I adore, I'm helpless, I am forever yours

One so graceful, drown in those eyes
Beneath her velvet deadly passion lies
Other noble born a queen
Carnal Venus, my needs redeem
