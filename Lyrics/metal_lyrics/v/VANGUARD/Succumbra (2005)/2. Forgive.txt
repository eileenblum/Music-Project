A buried cradle, six feet under.
A wedding dress, torn asunder.
A twisted ring, worn for one day
An empty house, beaten by the rain.

She has bled her love and grace away.
And drowned her life in sorrow.
Left behind her second chance.
Needing the tears that follow.

A broken promise, a vow eternal
A soul-searched fate, a lonely funeral.
A wounded future, a long dead past
Knowing, she will suffer last.

Joining earth and feeling soon,
Dust to dust, her mother's womb.
Never together but never apart.
For all times after joined at the heart
