Condemned to burn forever in a blazing flame
Unchanging aeons, all just stays the same
Married to the stars
Mother of us all
Forever rise
Forever fall

Growing tired, losing her glow
Swollen being, her own worst foe
Star stuff turning, around and round
All her children are to her bound

The spark now dead, suffocate
Her cold cadaver now seals our fate
Where once was matter
Now is a hole
Stronger than ever
Devour us all
