Starlight lancing fallen nightscape
Masses singing for thy grace
Fire burning, dancing; profane!
Chanting mantras mesmerize

Blood clad priestess raising her hands
Tempting virtue walk astray
Unsung heroes congregating
Fallen angels still alive

I bow before her, she touches my heart
Give me you blessings of light and dark
I swallow freedom, it drives me insane
Venomous poison inside my veins
