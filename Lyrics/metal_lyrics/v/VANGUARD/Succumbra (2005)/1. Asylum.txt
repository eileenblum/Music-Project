Soft was the blade that cut my throat
Sweet was the poison I swallowed
Soft was the rope around my neck
And bliss the pain in which I swallowed

You found me shattered
My soul so fiercely battered
Lying on the floor
One glimpse of your eyes
I knew you could make me rise
Whole and strong again

Slow was the fall that crushed my bones
Warm the fire that burned me
Fresh the blood that escaped
And true the love love that hurt me

So please forgive me
For making us wait and see
If this love would reign true
I know now why I breathe
I know now why my heart beats
Only to be in love with thee
