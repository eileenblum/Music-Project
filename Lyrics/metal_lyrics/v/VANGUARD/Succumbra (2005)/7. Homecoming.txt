Crystal tears shall fall and paint all in white
Full moon into darkness to shed us guiding light
The land of true purity, the rivers' mighty streams
Will now for all eternity stop their life and freeze

I am the winter that will cum
I am the freezing storm wind blow
My love as a glacier turns tears into snow

With havoc summer's slain
Frost covers trees
I wield a sword of ice
And force warmth on its knees

Flowers stop blooming when night starts to call
All hail Gaia, mother of us all
All leaves have fallen, frost rises mountains high
This is our homecoming, for winter autumn must die
