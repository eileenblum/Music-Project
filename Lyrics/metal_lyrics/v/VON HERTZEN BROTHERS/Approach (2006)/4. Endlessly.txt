human feelings after all
are waves that linger on my shore
no one sees them and they're gone
the tide comes and brings them up once more

falling headlong - like a newborn
from a great height to a new life

all i wished for when i died
was to do so with a smile in my eyes
i saw the wind and so much more
the whirlwind came knocking at my door

from a sunrise - through the past lives

from a rain cloud to a bare ground

i was free for a moment
i was free, i was free
and now i'm here for a moment
to be free, to be free
endlessly

did you learn your lessons?
did you meet their needs?
did you look behind the memories?
did you share your wisdom?
did you make it real?
did you meet the eyes of enemies?
