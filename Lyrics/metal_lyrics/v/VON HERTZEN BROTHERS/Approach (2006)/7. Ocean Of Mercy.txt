ocean of mercy
where are you hiding?
show yourself to me
i know you're just playing
reveal your compassion
come to me come, come, come
and end this illusion
run to me run, run, run

the sound of your laughter and flute divine fills the air
a crown with a feather so beautiful adorns your hair

the moon will rise to light up
the night that soon will bind us
as one, so come, at once, oh run!

it's been too many years
my search has ended up in tears
oh lord!

what's taking you so long?
i'm helpless with you gone
oh lord!
my sweet lord!

in the woods of your love
in the mist of your dawn
i'll be waiting, i'll be waiting

where are you hiding?
i know you're just playing
