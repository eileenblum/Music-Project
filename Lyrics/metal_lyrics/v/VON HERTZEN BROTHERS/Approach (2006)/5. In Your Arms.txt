three worlds for you and me
yesterday, today and the morrow
the first one is gone
it's gone for good
and the third one will choose whether to follow

that leaves us today
today is the day
when the hearts of two lovers embrace

you undress my sorrow
and heal me with your will
my worries 'bout tomorrow
they leave me as you lift me
in your arms, in your arms, in your arms

you lift me in your arms

three words from you to me
i am yours, you are mine and we're free
for the first time
i understand
what the words of true love really mean

they resonate with faith
faith and grace
in the hearts as two lovers embrace

hearts of two lovers embrace
in your arms, in your arms, in your arms
