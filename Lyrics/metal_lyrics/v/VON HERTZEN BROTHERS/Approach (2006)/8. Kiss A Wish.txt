my my my my my
yet another time i'll try
to understand my
my my my my mind
it's ahead, behind
i must unwind

yet another try, a song, a story, an approach
a kiss, a wish, a smile, which so kindles
a cry, a dive, an another approach and
a kiss, a wish, a smile and that's it

my my my my my
yet another time i'll try
to overcome my
my my my my my

tendencies and pride
i must unwind

yet another grin, a sin, a secret, a weakness
a kiss, a wish, a smile, which so kindles
a cry, a dive, an another approach and
a kiss, a wish, a smile and that's it

bring me home, where i belong
bring me home, bring me home

sing that song, oh sing along
sing along the way back home

a joke, a song, a story, an approach
a kiss, a wish...
