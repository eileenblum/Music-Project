damn this illusion
lust and confusion
are eating up my mind
this situation's
devils creation
an evil in disguise

'cause i can't get out of here
where nothing seems real
the answer is near
i still just hold on to

i hold on to your feet
there's nothing more i need

if i surrender will you remember me?
as i surrender will your love enter me?

if i hold on to your feet

so give me the solution
your definite conclusion
i need a revolution
i need an army ahead

let go!

let thy will be done
