There's a thief out
In the orchard
Looking for a thought to steal

With disbelief and doubt
He comes to torture me

When I hold my breath and feel

My human soul
Been like a rose
Rising up
Reach out
And trying
To open
(Rising out, reaching out and trying)
And trying
To bloom
(Standing out to the clouds before.)

The dream is starting over
The rise and fall
Prospect for escape

To the silence
To my loved ones
The queen of seven seas

To the island
To my hideout
The only place I feel

My burning soul
Having gracious wings
Lifting up
Taking off
And flying

[Guitar solo]

Give me a message I can hear
[Background singers]
I need it spoken loud and clear
[Background singers]
A one that stays unbroken
[Background singers]

The dream is taking over
The rise and fall
Prospect for escape
