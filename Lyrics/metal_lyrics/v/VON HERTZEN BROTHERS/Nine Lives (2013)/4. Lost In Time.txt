Dear God
I have one request
And I need to get this off my chest
Cause I'm evil head to toe
and I hope you would leave me alone

From now on until the end
you can never be my friend again
Because I'm evil and fallen, son
so pretend that I'm already gone

(In Time)
And we'll never meet again
Only Heaven knows the sinner that I am until I'm gone
(In Time)
[?] I can never be the sinner again until I'm gone

Lost in time
Lost in time
I am (Lost In time)
Lost in time
(Lost in time)

[Solo]

So more, my soul is like deserted paramount.
and I beg you to understand
I'm an evil, evil, evil man!

(In Time)
We will never meet again
Only Heaven knows the sinner that I am until I'm gone
(In Time)
[?] it can not erase the pain that I feel until I'm gone
(In Time)
[?] can't you see I am not the man you made me to be until I'm gone.

Lost in Time
Lost in time
I am (Lost in time)
Lost in Time
(Lost in time)
I am.
