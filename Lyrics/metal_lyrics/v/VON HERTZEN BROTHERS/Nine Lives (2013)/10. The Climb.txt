So easy to quip and get this heart and
Love seems like a cold and distant mountain
This life is a breathe [?]
I swear that I will surmount her

Tonight I'm on my own
Won't hide my injured head in the sand
She's mine
I'm on the climb.

I know when the wheels are set for turning.
I'm home where the sky is red and brown
The cloud underneath is [?]
(Whoa!)
[?]

Tonight I'm on my own
Won't hide my injured head in the sand
This night
I'll make sure that there's no stone left unturned
She's mine
I'm on the climb.

Fall! I'll keep on climbing the rocky slope of her everlasting love
and my, my feet are finding the cracks and coves to help me rise above
This life.

Tonight I'm on my own
Wont hide my injured head in the sand
This time I'll keep myself controlled

Tonight I'll make sure there's no stone left unturned
She's mine
I'm on the climb.
