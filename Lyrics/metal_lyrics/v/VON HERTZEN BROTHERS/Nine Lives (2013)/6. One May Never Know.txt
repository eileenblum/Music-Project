You laid your life
On the line
Once and for all.

You believed it was time
To draw the line
Between now and ever more.

One may [?]
One may never know.

Calling on the side
I'm searching in the east
Reading from the sky
It's always been
It's been always [?]

Craving for the light
So pure, my craving for the light.
It's always been
It's always around.

Always far away
Always hear you so close.
Always near
Always here.

White!
Light!

White!
Light!

Always far away
Always hear you so close.
Always near
Always here.
