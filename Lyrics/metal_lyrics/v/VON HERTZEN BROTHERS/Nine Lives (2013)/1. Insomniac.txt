Iâve got a rat in a cage
I feed it with hunger
A voluntary su -suppression overload

Until Iâm seething with rage
Now is it a wonder?
That any given moment something will explode

Canât knock the wind out of its sails
Or cut it wings and get it off my trail
Insomnia
This wicked insomnia
The untamed desire
The raving wildfire
Oh, it keeps me awake

Itâs a destructive machine
Ticking the numbers
Every second builds the pressure in my head

I guess you know what I mean
The stress I am under
What a fate to be possessed until Iâm dead

Canât knock the wind out of its sails
Or cut it wings and get it off my trail
Insomnia
This wicked insomnia
The untamed desire
The raving wildfire
Oh, it keeps me awake

And I toss
And I turn
Cause I canât get sleep
What I lost
What I earned
Was it all sincere?
Am I gross?
Is she hurt?
Is she sad like me?
Did she know?
Did I learn?
What I sow I reap

It begins
And it builds
Till it makes me crack
And it kills
And it fills
Every dream I have
In my loins
In my head
On my heels
My back
In my groin
On my bed
Everywhere the rat/around

Canât knock the wind out of its sails
Or cut it wings and get it off my trail
Insomnia
This wicked insomnia
The untamed desire
The raving wildfire

Canât knock the wind out of its sails
Or cut it wings and get it off my trail
Insomnia
This wicked insomnia
The untamed desire
The raving wildfire

Oh, it keeps me awake
