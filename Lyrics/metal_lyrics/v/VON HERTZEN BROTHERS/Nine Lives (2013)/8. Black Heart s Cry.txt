Breathe with the wind
That steals the sun
And leaves us roaming free

Batter down the hatches
Cause here we come
It's only us and the deep blue sea

The thunder and the roar
Of the cannon fire
Give you hell till kingdom come

Cause we are the black hearts
Come and join us
We will be as one

Right now!

You're sitting there in silence
With the fire in yous eyes
And there, inside your calm and bliss
Shines bright our sad demise

Like night and day
Apart we stay
Apart we stay

So in love and war, my friend
All is so fair
Shall we be eternal?
The battle never ends
Purity, purity so blinding
White light in your heart
Does it ever get to kill the darkness?
This dark

You're sitting there in silence
Whit the fire in your eyes
And there, inside your calm and bliss
Shines bright our sad demise

Like night and day
Apart we stay
Apart we stay

And there you come and whisper low
'One day you'll know'
There is no path to peace
Peace is the way to go

The only way to go

You're sitting there in silence
With the fire in your eyes
And there, inside your calm and bliss
Shines bright our sad demise

Like night and day
Apart we stay
Apart we stay

And our black hearts cry
