Alone and alive on the midnight train
The life as I knew it
Shot down the drain
Right on time or way too late?
Oh Lord, give me all your mercy
To get it straight

The night keeps breathing down my neck
My nerves are shot; I'm nearly a wreck
Oh midnight train,
Take me away

Oh, Again

I do, I don't
I'm close to insanity
I will, I won't
The doubt is a-killing me
Bridges burning
Wheels are turning

I cut the rope
And free-fall to stay alive
I cling to hope
And see if I learn to fly
Bridges burning
Wheels are turning

And I'm runiing away?

Alone and alive on the midnight train
Over the edge just to feel the flame
Or am I just another pathetic liar?
And if I get burned will I always dread the fire?

I do, I don't
I'm close to insanity
I will, I won't
The doubt is a-killing me
Bridges burning
Wheels are turning

I cut the rope
And free-fall to stay alive
I cling to hope
And see if I learn to fly
Bridges burning
Wheels are turning

I feel the blood rushing through my brain
Under my skin and in my veins
Oh, this is real; no I'm not insane
This time I'm gonna win this race
It's only me and the open space
I speed up, pray for grace
This is real; no I'm not insane
I'm riding fast on the midnight train

This time I won't stay at the station
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh no

I do, I don't
I'm close to insanity
I will, I won't
The doubt is a-killing me
Bridges burning
Wheels are turning

I cut the rope
And free-fall to stay alive
I cling to hope
And see if I learn to fly
Bridges burning
Wheels are turning

Before I come back home
I've gotta take care of this
Oh, I'm coming home
I've gotta take care... yeah
Before I come back home

I remember being here before
So many times or even more
How many lives do I have to live?
To get things straight on the midnight train
