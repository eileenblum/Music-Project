Sheâs been a loner ever since she gave in
To the lingering ghost of her past
And she was doing everything she could to stay still
But the grip of its hold was to last

She became
A wanderer
A foreigner
A living lost cause
In the shade and dark corridors
Stories would tell that she was, yea

Born with a curse
Turning diamonds to dust
Diamonds to dust
An innocent world to withered flowers and rust
Flowers and rust

I donât remember the day when she fell
My only memory as far as I can tell
Is the trembling of my hands when they held
Withered flowers with her farewell

I became
A charlatan
A bohemian
A clown without shame
Wide awake and in delirium
I can hear myself calling her name, yea

Born with a curse
Turning diamonds to dust
Diamonds to dust
An innocent world to withered flowers and rust

Clearly I was

Born with a curse
Turning diamonds to dust
Diamonds to dust
An innocent world to withered flowers and rust
Flowers and rust
