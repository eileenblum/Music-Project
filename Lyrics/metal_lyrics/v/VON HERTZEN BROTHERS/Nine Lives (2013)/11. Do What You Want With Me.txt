Whoa!
Hey!

You spill my blood
You hunt me down
And your creeping like a cat without a sound.

You check me out and make me
eat the ground
because you know you'll get me caught this time around.

Do what you want, you can do what you want with me!
'Cause there's no way out, there's no way out these walls [?]
Do what you want, you can do what you want with me!
'Cause there's no one here, there's no one here who knows
How to thrill me.

Whoa!
Hey!

So you look me up
And you turn my gut
Upside down inside out
While you curse me

You try to fuck me up
And treat me harsh
Then break my heart to million parts without a thought
Of mercy

Do what you want, you can do what you want with me!
'Cause there's no one here, there's no one here would not thrill me
Thrill me
And I fight to get into my head but you're actually trying to hear me
So, do what you want
Then kill me.

Yeah!

[Solo]

Do what you want, you can do what you want with me!
'Cause there's no one here, there's no one here would not thrill me
Thrill me
'Cause I can't get it into my head but you're actually dying to hear me
So, do what you want
Then help me, help me, help me, help me, help me.
