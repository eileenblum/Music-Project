Slow down
Your life will follow
No need to decide
When the answer is implied
Your anxious thoughts
Are seeds for sorrow

Every road has its turnings
Your desperate eyes
Canât witness lifeâs designs
So ease your low
Embrace the journey
Between the lines

Itâs unknown
And wonderful as starlit skies above
Unknown
Our world goes on the secret lies in love
Between the lines

Time has come
The spell is broken
The soul you must be
Is breaking to be free
And one by one
Your cells will open

To unknown
Itâs wonderful as starlit skies above
Unknown
My world goes on the secret lies in love
Between the lines

Between the lines.
Between the lines!
Between the lines.
Between the lines.
Between the Lines!

[Solo]
