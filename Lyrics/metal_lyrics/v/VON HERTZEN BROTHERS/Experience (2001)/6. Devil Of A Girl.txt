[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

You call me on the phone
When you need my attention
And every time you call
It feeds your obsession
I can't find it anymore
Amusing living in this
Present state of mind

So please, please

Give me time to
Get rid of you
Devil of a girl
I need time to clear my head from
All the thoughts of her
The devil of a girl

You follow me back home
As if I'd need it
I'd rather be alone
But you can't feel it
I won't let you anymore
Abuse me and use me in this
Present state of mind

So please, please

Give me time to
Get rid of you
Devil of a girl
I need time to
Clear my head from
All the thoughts of her
The devil of a girl

I need time to
Get rid of you
