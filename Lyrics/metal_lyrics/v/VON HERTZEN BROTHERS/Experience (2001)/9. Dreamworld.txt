[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

Green light
You can come
And enjoy me

There's no use to run
The road is free
So come to me

On your way
Out of there
You will pass

The clouds and the rains
Of your past

You're sound asleep
And roaming deep
In the dreamworld

Everything you wanted to get while awake
You can have in the dreamworld
A dream of love a wish for more
Just a flash before I see you fall

A star role in a movie
Of your fantasy
You dive deep in the beauty
Of the milky sea

Of peace and joy
Like a little boy
In the dreamworld

Everything you wanted to get while awake
You can have in the dreamworld
A dream of love a wish for more
Just a flash before I see you fall
And I'll make it sure that you will fall
