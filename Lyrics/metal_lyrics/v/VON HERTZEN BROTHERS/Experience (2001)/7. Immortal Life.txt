[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

Here
I hide myself from the view
I don't want them to see me
Drifting away from you

Tears
Running down my face
I don't want them to hear me
Crying for your grace

I don't know how it happened
But I keep onâ¦

Looking for that one immortal life
I'm hooked instead with this malicious wife
I know that it exists immortal life
I can't go on like this I'm losing time

Time to be with you
'cause you're the only one who
Knows what I've been through

Speed up I've been here way too long
Hiding in my secrets
Waiting you to come

I don't know if it happens
But I keep onâ¦

Looking for that one immortal life
I'm hooked instead with this suspicious wife
I know that it exists immortal life
I can't go on like this I'd rather die

I'm looking for that one immortal life
I'm hooked instead with this delicious wife
I know that it exists immortal life
I can't go on like this I'm losing time
