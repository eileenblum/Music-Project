Brother!
These shotguns are keeping me awake at night
- you know I'm praying then for you

Brother!
And everything they say is so black and white
- it is the way that they get you

You left me here, like a pearl inside its shell
Brother!
If anything, get me out of here

I am here for you
Like you want me to
We'll make everything good

Brother!
Tell me what it is that's going wrong with me
- I don't know right from wrong myself

I've got shotguns hanging in the air all around me
One is sticking right out of my
Mouth and it's letting no one close to me

I feel lonely, like a pearl inside its shell
Brother!
Help me out of here

Rememberâ¦

Birds and fishes around the pond we rested by
Words and wishes secrets that we shared that night
Trees and flowers faces in the pale moonlight
Streets and towers places where we went at night

Mikset sÃ¤ oo tullu jo takaisin?
