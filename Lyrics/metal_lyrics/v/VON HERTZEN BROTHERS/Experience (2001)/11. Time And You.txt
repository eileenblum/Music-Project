[Music: Mikko von Hertzen]
[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

Weak and frail
Your whisper in the air
Is this the sign?
The sign that I can find
The way out from this forest of my mind

Maybe you left me here
To make it clear
That it's all in vain
To feel the load of pain
When I'm already insane

Repeating your name
Until the day

The time runs away from my mind
When I think about you
The time loses all of its might
When I think about you
When I dream of you

Been lost in these darkest fears
For so many years
Still trying to find
The way out from this mind
I'm craving for a sign

Repeating the rhyme
Until the day

The time runs away from my mind
When I think about you
The time loses all of its might
When I think about you

From every thought
And all my faults
From every high
And all my lies
Time has lost its might

I'm alone in hereâ¦
