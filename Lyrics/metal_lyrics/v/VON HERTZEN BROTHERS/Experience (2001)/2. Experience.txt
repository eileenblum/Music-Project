Everybody here is trying to fix their holes
And everybody's desperately trying to save their souls

And everybody's hunting someone down
And everybody's getting spinned around

C'mon experience the
Merry-go-around-around-around-around

So here I am in love with you
And you're in love with her
And she's in love with him
And he's in love with another girl
Who's about to fall for me so you would

You would like to join the show?
No I think you should

Open your eyes and blow away your mind
Experience the moment don't get left behind

Yeah I know that you can picture yourself
In a hole, in a mirror, tell me what to see
Tell me how it feels you know all the stories of
Rainbows skyhigh
All-around-moonlight everynight
No, why???

Here you are in love with me
And I'm in love with her
And she's in love with him
And he's in love with another girl
Who's about to fall for you
Who would like to set me free, set me free
Endlessly be with me, be with me

Open your eyes and blow away your mind
Experience the moment don't get left behind

This time you really know that you should
If you could you would blow it away
Go astray while we shake our sugar heads

And where am I going I don't want to know
What lies ahead's got to stay unknown
- it's far from over
Where am I going I don't want to know
What lies ahead's got to stay unknownâ¦

Open your eyes and blow away your mind
Experience the moment don't get left behind
