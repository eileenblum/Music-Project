[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

Honey please forgive me what I've done
I was losing my right mind today
And what I said was wrong and stupid
Yet it cannot be undone
And I know that we can find a way
To sort this out without that silver gun

C'mon now I can't get sleep
If you're pointing that at me
Put it down and let me be

Beside you
All I want to do is sleep, so please let me be

Okay let's have it in your way
So you want to see me out of bed
And on my knees until you free me
Getting tired of this game
I get up thinking all the same
As long as it will end this play of shame

You can kill me when I sleep
If I'm not the one to keep

Beside you

And it's very time the same things
All over and over again
- a circle with no end
C'mon now please tell me
Tell me how you feel
The confessions that you need
All I want to do is sleep
I really need some sleep
I really need to be

Beside you
