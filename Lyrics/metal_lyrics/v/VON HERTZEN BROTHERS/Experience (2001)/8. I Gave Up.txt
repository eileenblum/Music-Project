[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

I wanted to get
And then forget
And all I got was something
Painful to regret

I wanted to give
To give and forgive
And in the end I found
A peaceful way to live

I gave up on you
You and us two
I gave up my life
Foolish but true
I gave up on all that could
Give up on me like
I did you

I gave up on you
