You're reading the third book
On what to do if someone beats you up
I'm having just one look
At life in you it's on sale just for us

What do they know?
What do we know???

- nothing at all

Swearing no!
But we do it again
Turning tables
Let's face it my friend
Can we truly claim that there's
Something left for us to say
As everything will change one day?

Smiling together
And shaking hands in pictures for the press
Fighting each other
The next day for a reason I can't guess

What do they do?
What do we do???

- except spread more lies

Swearing no!
But we do it again
Turning tables let's face it my friend
Can we truly claim that there's
Something left for us to say
As everything will change one day?

I doubt it
Why say it?

There's nothing left for us to say
As everything will change one day
There's nothing left
