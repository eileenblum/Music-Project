You wait until
The air is still
Before you launch your overkill
No one thought you'd dare come back for more

You shoot to thrill
You've trained this skill
You put me through a burning mill
I get caught in corners, that's for sure

Silent steps

My heart is racing
My heart is racing so

I will bear
My despair
In my way
I don't want you here no more
I don't want you here no more
I'll just say
You will fail
Time and again
I don't want you here no more

You're insincere
Devoid of fear
Hiding till the coast is clear
Make no mistake, I've seen it all before

Our ghost appears
With a stream of tears
False like all the countless years
When no one knew you're vengeful to the core

Silent steps

I will bear
My despair
In my way
I don't want you here no more
I don't want you here no more
I'll just say
You will fail
Time and again
I don't want you here no more

Oh, you're so much trouble

I will bear
My despair
In my way
I'll just say
You will fail
Time and again
I don't want you here no more

You're causing me trouble
