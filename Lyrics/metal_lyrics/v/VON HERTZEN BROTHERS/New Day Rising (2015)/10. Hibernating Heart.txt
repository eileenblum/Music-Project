It's the end of summertime,
We grew water from the earth,
Until it ran dry.

I knew it all the while,
This moment would arrive,
Ground is white now.

Autumn leaves have fallen,
And my heart is like a hibernating Romeo.

My roots remain unfrozen,
But all the birds have flown away,
Like you they can not stay.

And so, underneath the snow,
I dream about your warmth,
To wake me up.

Autumn leaves have fallen,
And my heart is like a hibernating Romeo.

My roots remain unfrozen,
But all the birds have flown away,
Like you they can not stay.
