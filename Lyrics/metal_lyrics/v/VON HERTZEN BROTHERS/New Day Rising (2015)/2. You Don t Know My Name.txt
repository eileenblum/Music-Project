I'm careful with my every step
Determined what I wish upon a star
'Cause when you light a cigarette
I know you're lost in thought and off your guard
I don't need your little lips
to tell me I was trouble from the start
that's why
You got to let me closer
And closer
All the way
Still
You don't know my name
You don't know my name
You don't know my name
You don't know my name
You don't know my name
And each day when I sleep
When I close my eyes
I feel like falling
into your dreams
I want to show you who the real life me is
Got to let you know who the real life me is
I want to show you who the real life me is
Got to let you know that the real life me is right
You don't know my name
You don't know my name
You don't know my name
You don't know my name
You don't know my name
And each day when I sleep
When I close my eyes
I feel like falling
I want to show you who the real life me is
Got to let you know who the real life me is
You will know my name
