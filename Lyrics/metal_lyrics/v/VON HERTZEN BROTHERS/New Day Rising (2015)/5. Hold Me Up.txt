Im in the eye
of the storm
That left me high and dry
For you to hold me up
The heavy rain strated a landslide
A force that caused no harm
'cause you were open and co-operating
Im not the first to say it's alright
When thing's are falling apart
I get stuck and feel like suffocating
Yeah i've been around the world
And the world i see in you
Is quite out of the ordinary
I can't belive i found a girl
Who can turn my days around
Despite i'm always in the eye
of a strom
That leaves me high and dry
for you to hold me up
We met the rains along the coastside
and watched the oceans rise and fall
Ain't this how all things go?
Ain't this how all things go?
Yeah i've been around the world
And the world i see in you
Is quite out of the ordinary
I can't belive i found a girl
Who can turn my days around
Despite i'm always in the eye
of a strom
That leaves me high and dry
for you to hold me up
Yeah i've been around the world
And the world i see in you
Is quite out of the ordinary
I can't belive i found a girl
Who can turn my days around
Despite i'm always in the eye
of a strom
That leaves me high and dry
for you to hold me up
