This pain
My pain
This pain I have to deal with every day
Black days
In black rain
I'm a wreck and bleeding toxins through my skin
Through my skin
I'm a wreck and bleeding toxins through my skins
It's been years ago since last heard your laughter
This road to hell was paved by me
It took those years to know the answer I've been after
I'm missing home
This pain
My pain
This pain I blame myself for every day
Someday
One day
Someday I might get clean and feel no shame
It's been years ago since I last heard your laughter
This road to hell was paved by me
It took those years to know the the answer I've been after
I guess I'm slow
Is there anyone at home?
In the place I used to call my own
Oh, I have to know if you're waiting for me
If you wait.
