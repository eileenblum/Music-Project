Glory days
At times I felt so hypnotized
I had
Eyes to see you
Skin to feel you
And my hopes were bright and high
I thought there could be
Someone else
but time has proven otherwise
So I greet you
And I treat you
as if everything was right
I float along with the evening's tide
Memories washing by
are like blindfolds on my eyes
blindfolds on my eyes
Love burns
Memories
oh memories
Hold me in your caring hands
Let me feel you
cause I need to
embrace your quicksand
Sayonara
Sayonara
Emptiness is all I have
I loved with no reason
out of key and
now I'm a lost man
I float along with the evening's tide
Memories washing by
are like blindfolds on my eyes
blindfolds on my eyes
Love burns
I hear your voice as I'm recalling all those memories
and I feel an undertow of solace climb my spine
Only a thought of you accepting my apologies
would start the healing of this burning in my eyes
I'm redeemed from you
I'm redeemed from you
When I settle my eyes to the present, which I could never rely on
How I needed you
Help me make up my mind about choosing a life so hard to decide on
I believe it's true
I believe it's true
Life is only a test of our gratitude
Either spit or smile on
I float along with the evening's tide
Memories washing by
are like blindfolds on my eyes
blindfolds on my eyes
Love burns
