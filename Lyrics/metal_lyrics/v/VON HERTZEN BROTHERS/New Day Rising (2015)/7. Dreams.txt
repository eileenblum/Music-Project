I'd like to climb a mountain all the way up north
to kiss your pretty face by Niagara Falls
I'd like to see you naked before I get old
Together grow bald making fun of it all
Let it show
I know you'd love to see the Hanami in Japan
Admire New York as the liberty land
I'd take you to the sights of Maui and France
to spice things up I'd even learn how to dance on the pole
Instead I sit and write a melody
I'll dream it all up to a song for you and me
Singing feels like a remedy
Oh, how blessed I would be to have you as my girlfriend
I know it sounds like the same old song
dreams that I have right until we both sing along
and any thought that it could go wrong
Cut it down
Cut it down
Cut it down
We would tandem cannonball into the deep blue sea
and watch the sunrise where the dolphins feed
Trace our feet in the snow white sand
Look up at the stars holding each other's hand, yeah
Instead I sit and write a melody
I'll dream it all up to a song for you and me
Singing feels like a remedy
Oh, how blessed I would be to have you as my girlfriend
I know it sounds like the same old song
dreams that I have right until we both sing along
and any thought that it could go wrong
Cut it down
Yeah
Don't wake me up before it all becomes reality
What we dream about is how it's meant to be eventually
Instead I sit and write a melody
I'll dream it all up to a song for you and me
Singing feels like a remedy
Oh, how blessed I would be to have you as my girlfriend
I know it sounds like the same old song
dreams that I have right until we both sing along
and any thought that it could go wrong
Cut it down
