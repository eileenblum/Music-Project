You're far away from home
under the cloudless skies of blue
Exploring the unknown
Holding a guiding light with you
You see a silver lining in every passing cloud
and in a pitch-dark silence your path is always found
You are a sunday child with adventure in your heart
and in the midst of trials you always know your part
You were meant to be
far away from home
Walk in the light
Exploring the unknown
to find me
I am the lighthouse keeper on the other side
and you may feel that my light is keeping you alive
I'll be there by the tower watching from afar
if the flare makes you blind and stops you where you are
You were meant to be
far away from home
Walk in the light
Exploring the unknown
to find me
You met me in a daydream - once before
You saw me as a sunbeam - to live for
I came without a warning - like a storm
and I left you with a calling - a resolve
You're far away from home
under the cloudless skies of blue
You were meant to be
far away from home
under the cloudless skies of blue
Exploring the unknown
Holding a guiding light with you
