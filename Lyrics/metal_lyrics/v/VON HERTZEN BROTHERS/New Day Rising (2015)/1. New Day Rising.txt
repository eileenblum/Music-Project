There's hell to pay,
I'm on my way
Not a minute more to waste in this town
No time to say goodbye
You held me in your cabaret
Like a gimmick holding back your meltdown
For too long
I don't need a dime to save it for a rainy day 'Cause nothing here has value anymore
Oh no
When the candle is burning out
And I've got nothing left to save but my soul
New York is changing
I will be okay 'Cause we can't turn the wheel to the past
To fix the bad ideas that got out of control
New love needs making
I will be okay
Again
Escaping to the dawning red
I will break the chains and smash the windows
To a world
I see much brighter
My home
I believe what we see and go for it
I have never been into chasing rainbows
And so I move on 'Cause nothing here can satisfy my soul
When the candle is burning out
And I've got nothing left to save but my soul
New York is changing
I will be okay 'Cause we can't turn the wheel to the past
To fix the bad ideas that got out of control
New love needs making
I will be okay
Again
There's hell to pay
I'm on my way,
I'm on my way
Today
