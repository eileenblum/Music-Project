You got lost somehow
But I'm here for you now
My child, your wings are all broken
But you're breathing

There's no one but you
To decide whether to
Give in or fight your way through to
Know the meaning
If not taken away

You said, that all the people are hanging on
To their dreams but yours is gone
And so there's nothing here for you to believe in
And the demons in your head are not retreating

But I say

Yeio!
You're somewhere in the middle of the rain but your sun
Yeio!
Is waiting at the horizon till the pain has gone
To paint your sky with rainbows

I wish I could be, I wish I could be like a rainbow
Bringing a smile on your face
I'll keep you warm and I'll keep you safe
When the light tries to escape from your eyes

How I wish you could see
I wish you could feel and believe in
In my love that awaits you everywhere
Darling, everywhere you go somehow I will know

'Cause we're just people trying to hold on
Each one of us on our own
Still we're not alone; no we're not alone
We're all face to face with the great unknown

Yeio!
We're somewhere in the middle of the rain but our sun
Yeio!
Is waiting at the horizon for us broken ones to see us come
Yeio!
We're somewhere in the middle and the way seems long
Yeio!
But every step ahead will take us closer some

For the life to
Finally, finally
Mend what we've become

For the love to
Finally, finally
Make us feel as one

We're somewhere in the middle ofâ¦

Yeio!
You're somewhere in the middle of the rain
But your sun
Yeio!
Is waiting at the horizon till the
Pain has gone, gone away
Yeio!
You're somewhere in the middle of the rain
And this song
Yeio!
Is for you my beautiful broken one
