The parting day
His mothers prayers
Send him on his way
His way to

Invade, destroy and fall
This is what they called him for
âFreedom fighterâ

Itâs only natural
This is what his life is for
âFreedom fighterâ

A far-off place
With none to turn to
He drops his face and prays:

Dear mister jesus,
Or someone who sees us
Theyâre not our neighbors and
Youâre not their savior

Will he live tomorrow?
Will this last forever?
Thereâs only death and sorrow!
Is it just too late?
Late?

Invade destroy and fall
This is what the war is for
âFreedom fighterâ

Itâs only natural
This is what heâs dying for
âFreedom fighterâ
