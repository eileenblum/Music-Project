[Music: Von Hertzen Brothers]
[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

Not even silent northern winds to bring relief
Thereâs no movement or a breeze
No sign of water, my desert barely breathes

My swollen eyes canât see a clear direction to go
Iâve been left, right, north, south, above and below
The devil is amused enjoying this show

But you donât look my way
You donât look my way

Ever since you went away Iâve been here on my own
All I ask is a glance, Iâm sure you know

If you look this way
If you look my way
I can feel the rain has come
Feel the rain has come

My silver lover, come and cover me
With your kisses from the sea

Wash my eyes and show to me a clear direction to go
Iâve been left, right, north, south, above and below
The devil is a fool whose cover you can blow
All I ask is a glance, Iâm sure you know

If you look this way
If you look my way
I can feel the rain has come
Feel the rain has come

Youâre the rain
Your eyes never fail
Your gracious eyes
Your eyesâ¦

Rain, waiting for the rain
Waiting for Love
Rain
Rain, waiting for the rain
Long awaited rain
