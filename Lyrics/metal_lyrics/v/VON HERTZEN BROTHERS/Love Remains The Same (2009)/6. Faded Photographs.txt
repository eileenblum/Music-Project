Somewhere
Under your everyday restraint
Hides a faint
Echo of laughter
From the hereafter
From an existence known to be true
A voice is warning you

Don't let your future repeat your past
Away with your faded photographs
They're colors on paper that won't last

Someday
You'll see the truth in it
And though your life goes on
Like a story
Or a movie
You're acting the scenes like one with no clue
Of what lies in store for you

Just don't let your future repeat your past
Away with your faded photographs
They're colors on paper that won't last

Don't let your future repeat your past
Away with your faded photographs
They're colors on paper that won't last

Like the wind you can expand yourself to be free
Like the waves you'll understand that you are the sea

Don't let your future repeat your past
Away with your faded photographs
'Cause even the treasured ones won't last

Don't let your future repeat your past
Away with your faded photographs
They're colors on paper that won't last

The life in your faded photographs
Is color on paper that won't last

The life in your faded photographs
Has colors on paper that won't last
