[Music: Von Hertzen Brothers]
[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

Bring out the Sun to shine on everyone
When our minds have lost their hope and vigor
Our hearts shall overcome

Bring out the Sun to shine on everyone
When our dreams have all begun to wither
And we feel weâre overrun

Everyone, bring out your Sun!

So, after waiting for the darkness to let go of me
I know, as the zenithâs getting closer, I know
I will have to catch your light before you go

So, I am radiating unless you let go of me
Oh no, I hope my S.O.S.âs from the other shore
Will make you wait until I feel your rays once more

Every pore, in the core Iâm feeling so alive, so alive
Alive!
When Iâm yours, once more Iâm feeling so alive
Alive!

Everyone, bring out your Sun!
