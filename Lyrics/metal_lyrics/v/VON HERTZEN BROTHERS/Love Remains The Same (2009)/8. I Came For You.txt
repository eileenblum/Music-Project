[Music: Von Hertzen Brothers]
[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

As happiness left you dry
As peaceful depths gave no reason for a cry
I came for you
I came for you

Leave your soul in my hands
My control

âCause Iâm the guard of your gold
And Iâm the God of the myths that youâve been told
I came for you

Thereâs no way I relent
Iâll stay here until you repent
Yes, Iâll stay here until you repent

I know your pain and despair will take you there
I came for you

Every mistake is a leap
Every heartache a jewel to keep
Failure the most precious one
Donât try to run,
Your time has come!

For your last endeavorâ¦
- are you ready now?
For Love that lasts foreverâ¦
- are you ready now?
To stop your heart from burningâ¦
- are you ready now?
From here thereâs no returningâ¦
- are you ready now?
For the final journeyâ¦
- are you ready now?
To find the end for yearningâ¦
- are you ready now?
