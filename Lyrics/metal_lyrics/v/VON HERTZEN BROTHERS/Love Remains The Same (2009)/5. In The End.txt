[Words: Mikko von Hertzen]

Iâm awake in my cell on a sleepless night
And my faith in this hell is a cheerless sight
Brighten, brighten, I need you here
Lighten, lighten, donât disappear

My fate in the stars of the Saturn sky
And my days never far from itâs evil eyes
Fighting, fighting, in the rain and cold
Somehow surviving because I know

In the end
Youâll save me
No matter if I canât be found
In the end
Youâll make me
A ladder to get back on the ground

In the end, in the end death canât take me
âCause the reaper cannot bear the sound
Of Your name

Now I know how it feels to see the darkness as my own
And now I know how the seeds become trees where they are sown
I fell into a well and abandoned all my hope
But now I know how to tell between a snake and a rope

In the end
Youâll save me
No matter if I canât be found
In the end
Youâll make me
A ladder to escape from this round
In the end, in the end death canât take me
âCause I could never let You down
No, I could never let You down

In the end
Youâll save me
No matter if I canât be found
In the end
Youâll make me
A ladder to escape this merry-go-round
In the end, in the end death canât take me
âCause I could never let You down
In the end
