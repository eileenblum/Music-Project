[Words: Von Hertzen Brothers / L.A.Skin]

Far, far away from us
White horses they run
Under the midnight sun

Far, far away from us
Three pirates have drawn their guns
Carved by the captain for his sons

And now it's time to wake up those sleeping soldiers
And to play without fear
The adventure will start right here
And right now, as we're ready to sing out

Gloria!
Gloria!
We can relive those times
Of young warriors

Gloria!
Gloria!
We can instill this life
In euphoria

Beyond the veil
Three bandits they sail
Adding songs to their tale

And this time
They've arrived in this precious moment
Only to leave again
'Cause this story of three allies has no end

Battle!

Gloria!
Gloria!
We can relive those times
Of young warriors

Gloria!
Gloria!
We can instill our lives
In euphoria
In Euphoria
Euphoria
