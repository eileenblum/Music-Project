[Music: Von Hertzen Brothers]
[Words: Von Hertzen Brothers / L.A.Skin]

I'm petrified with fear in my own bed
I don't know what to do
Do with you

You're victimized by voices in your head
For saying things untrue
And for things you do

Our love is a lie
And this world is a lie

You're hypnotized like a monster on the make
Drained of self-esteem
You're cruel and mean

I'm like a lowlife gangster on the take
Haunted by this dream
More and more obscene

Our love is a lie
And this world is a lie
That we try to justify

Some of us
The outright inglorious
Invented a virus
Designed to kill the living presence of good in us
By turning us against each other
A devious scheme that consequently
Made us believe that life is just for gratification

The insecure side of us
Got caught by this virus
That started to kill the living presence of good in us
By every conceivable way enforcing the lies on us
That consequently
Made us believe that love is just for gratification

The infectious desire for more
Is spreading like virus
Destroying and killing the happiness in all of us
Step by step increasingly decreasing the likelihood
Of ever finding
Any trace of doubt that love is just for gratification

The evil spirit in all of us
Is feeling victorious
Beholding the virus
Infectiously destroying any proof of good in us
In every way succeeding in increasing the
Dishonesty that suffocates us
With the conviction that love is just for gratification
The evil spirit inside of us
Isn't a part of us

And these voices in our heads
These voices in our heads

Don't belong to us
They're caused by the virus
Determined to demolish every positive thought in us
By building a universe of pure distrust in everything that is good in us
And everything else in us is increasing the
Dishonesty that suffocates us
The evil spirit inside of us
Isn't part of us

And these voices in our heads
These voices in our heads

Love is a lie
Love is a lie
Our love is lie
Is a lie
Is a lie
