[Words: Von Hertzen Brothers / L.A.Skin]

Whole lotta monkey
The chatter lingers
Oh yea, I'm about to blow my fuse
So point your finger at me
Bring on your disease
To hell with your pleas

Riding the time bomb
Into the fire
There's a runaway train of thoughts
Inside my worn-out brain
Shot down in flames

How precious is the flow
The cozy glow of fire and brimstone
I feel the shadows grow
And everything becomes as white as snow

Hear me scream!

Breathe with me
Now don't you worry
You'll get your kicks
Before you'll be sorry

As the time's running out
I'm slipping out of my brain âinsane!
Riding the raving train
I'm afraid to call my own

As the word's getting out
I'm driven into a corner
Fuck off!
I'll never give in
I'm prepared to reap what I've sown

What comes around
It goes around
The truth's getting out
I'm ready to face the music with a smile

I must go on
Though it might go off
The harder I fall
The more it pleases my runaway pride

Come on press the rewind!

The time is running low
We can make it if we hold our own

The answer it will show
It'll come out like the sun from the unknown

How precious is the glow
The choices that we make on our way home

Watch the shadow go
And everything becomes as white as snow
