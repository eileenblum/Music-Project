[Music: Von Hertzen Brothers]
[Words: Von Hertzen Brothers / L.A.Skin]

Her life is made of circles
She rides the ebb and flow
Floating like a feather

She got lost in a vicious cycle
Trying to make it on her own
Like a soul without a shepherd

Bad choices designed to crash and burn
No hope for return or salvation
Locked in the cycle for ever
Adrift 'til the deeps finally get her

She got blinded by false freedom
As she searched high and low
For the impossible to happen

And her mind lost all its reason
Being jostled to and fro
In a self-destructive manner

She needs me
To bind her with my hearts unrest
Lest she falls apart

Bad choices designed to crash and burn
- I wish I could be there now
No hope for return or salvation
- After all she's been through
Locked in the cycle together
- Get her out from this repeat mode
Adrift in the darkness forever

She's in a spin
I'm holding the end of the rope
I'm trying to reel her in
Every time she goes
I hang on to my hope
Until my heart gives in

Give it all you have
Don't break this bond!
Keep your head up
Don't break this bond!
Keep your head up
Don't break this bond!
Don't you break it!
I don't know if I can hold on
Hold On!
