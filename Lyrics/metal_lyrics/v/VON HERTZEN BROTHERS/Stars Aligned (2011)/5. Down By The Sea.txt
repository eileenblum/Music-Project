[Music: Von Hertzen Brothers]
[Words: Von Hertzen Brothers / L.A.Skin]

Down by the sea
There is a place
Where I go out to cry

With the winds I talk
With the waves I walk
On this Rock
I lay my head
When I tire

That morning was
So bright and true
The shore all glittered with ice

The silence whispered
From the sea
As our laughter
Echoed
Crystallized

Any day now
The tide will turn again
And clear the skies above

Any day now
The blue returns to the sea
And brings me back my love
