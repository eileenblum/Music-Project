I'm by your side
With sleepless eyes
Colors fade into the blue

A reckless ride
Nowhere to hide
A curtain fell between us two

Me and you
Me and you

Do you remember how we cried?
And promised to stay alive but now
How am I to get in to your heaven?

What if your sun would never rise?
The promise we made would still survive
I would die to get in to your heaven

Sleeping beauty in too deep
There's no kiss to pull you through

Can you hear me as I scream
Through the mist surrounding you

I love you
All of you

Do you remember how we cried?
And promised to stay alive but now
How am I to get in to your heaven?

What if your Sun would never rise?
The promise we made would still survive
I would die to get in to your heaven

We never believed in last goodbyes
Together we'll see through angels' eyes

She walks the earth in feather steps
And brings the light where there is mist
So much is hidden in her heaven

My Angel

Do you remember how we cried?
And promised to stay alive but now
How am I to get in to your heaven?

What if the Sun would never rise?
The promise I gave would still survive
I would die to get in to your heaven!

We never believed in last goodbyes
Together we'll see through angels' eyes
