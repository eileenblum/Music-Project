[Words: Von Hertzen Brothers / L.A.Skin]

I was banging on the door when I came to realize
I would need a miracle to get a taste of paradise

I used to get very very lonesome
And jealous of everyone else who was playing in the rain
And I never really came to understand
Why happiness belonged to the other kids, not me in any way

I couldn't go out to play

The little child within myself
Couldn't learn to read the signs
I kept hiding within myself
Like a bird afraid to fly
With no fire within myself
I couldn't burn to reach the skies
The child within myself was a mess and yes,
I needed a miracle to open the gates
For the light to kick out loneliness

What I need is a miracle
All I need is a miracle

The keeper of the door faced me eye to eye
I couldn't let the mirror fall for the fear I would break inside

The little child within myself
Couldn't learn to read the signs
I kept hiding within myself
Like a bird afraid to fly
With no fire within myself
I couldn't burn to reach the skies

Though I tried and tried to step into the light

What I need is a miracle
All I need is a miracle
