Find me
Please anybody find me
Please anyone enslave me
Break me, save me
Take me out of here

Anyone revive me
You know, I've been
Dying to live these days
I want to change
Tell me what it takes

Oh Yeah!
Here I go again
Now what's going on?
I'm still going strong
I've done my time

No, no!
It's not out of control
Just another taste
I don't want to waste
I've done my time
I'm in my prime

Don't you rain on my parade anew
I've got the stars aligned for me and you
Break the mirror
Razorblades

I really want to change
I've got what it takes
To build a happy home
That we can call our own

Cause I'm in love with you
As I'm in love with you now
Like there is no tomorrow

Don't you want me to
Reconnect with you now
I can heal all the sorrow

So yeah,
I got to make up
For lost time how
I've been blind now
I realize

Want to take a ride
I've got to stay high on life
Rectified

Don't you rain on my parade anew
I've got the stars aligned for me and you

Don't you rain on my parade anew
Break the mirror
Don't you want me toâ¦

Be in love with you
As I'm in love with you now
Like there is no tomorrow

Don't you want me to
Reconnect with you now
I can feel all your sorrow

I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you now
Like there is no tomorrow

Don't you want me to
Come and tell that I know
I'm to blame for your sorrow

I really want to change
I've got what it takes
To build a happy home
That we can call our own

Enslave me
Break me
Save me
Take me

I'm in love with you
Don't you want me to?

I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
Enslave me â I'm in control!

Break me â I'm in control!
Save me â I'm in control!
Take me â I'm in control!

Set me free!

Take my hand
Take me out of here
My soul is torn and tired
Lead the way
We will be okay
Walk me through this fire

I believe
I believe
