You want to be the master blaster
Killing yourself to win
You let your body sweat burn faster
Moulding a god of sin
You've got the madness and the glory
And now your heart's pounding blood
You're living your own story
You know it does you good

Krakin Up - Krakin Up - Krakin Up - Krakin Up

You put yourself through hours of torture
Increasing mindless pain
You soon become a demon vulture
You're getting greedy for gain

Krakin Up - Krakin Up - Krakin Up - Krakin Up

You've got the madness and the glory
Killing yourself to win
You're always living your own story
Moulding a god of sin
You want to be the master blaster
And now your heart's pounding blood
You let your body sweat burn faster
You know it does you good

Krakin Up - Krakin Up - Krakin Up - Krakin Up
