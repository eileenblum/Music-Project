I lust a princess - A crystal queen
Virginal whiteness is all that I dream
To make a contact - I'm dying to feel
My magic snow - Show me your real

Watch out - You there
She makes you feel good
Don't you care
Inside - Can't fight it
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now

It's a deadline now
For the midnight frost
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline

Give me an angel - Blow me a breeze
You walk on silver - Travel the seas
Hunting a killer - It's a jungle disease
Watching in marvel you'll steal her release

Watch out - You there
She makes you feel good
Don't you care
Inside - Can't fight it
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now

It's a deadline now
For the midnight frost
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now

My mind's in torment - Something's not clear
I take my godess where nobody hears
She sees right through me - She's in my mind
Mother of madness - Immortals blind

Watch out - You there
She makes you feel good
Don't you care
Inside - Can't fight it
You bring your money and be there
For the deadline now

It's a deadline now
For the midnight frost
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
It's a deadline now
