Take my hand and we'll be one
It's a chance in a million
Don't be scared on our way down
You'll belong to the hellion

Black your tears dry on me
Friend or foe or liar

Fire - In hell fire - Fire

Hear my tale and walk with me
Answer not to oblivion
Ask your stars your destiny
Shining down on Marillion

Red your eyes look for me
Scream the demon's choir

Search your soul for we're the same
Don't believe you're a warrior
Let me kick your mind insane
Hell's my unholy abattoir

Give your services to me
Burning feeds my buyers

Fire - Fire - Burning in fire - Fire - Hell fire
