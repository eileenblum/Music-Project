Metal Punk is rising wild
Antenae scouts the way
Ready for the danger
In the game he has to play

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to live
No time to die
Metal Punk

Metal Punk - Feel it
Metal Punk - C'mon
Metal Punk - Take it
Metal Punk

Metal Punk dilates the cries
A message all is well
The changes take their place
Amongst the sentinel

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to live
No time to die
Metal Punk

Metal Punk - Feel it
Metal Punk - C'mon
Metal Punk - Take it
Metal Punk
Metal Punk

Metal Punk animalize
Metal Punk watch his eyes
Metal make a punk of me
For satanic majesty

Savage mind
Damage child
Boiling high

Metal Punk
