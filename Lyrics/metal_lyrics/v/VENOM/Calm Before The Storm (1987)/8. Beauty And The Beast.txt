He watches witches weaving wonders
Inside their crystal balls of thunder
Seeing the future past and present
Of messages the universe sends

They summon through the sphere
A child so fair so virgin pure
They summon me my slave
Bring her to their lure

The beauty and the beast
The beauty and the beast

She calls christ in churches crimson
But I can see the blood on your sins
I've got to take her - Leave her - Take her
Tell me the price if I deliver

They guide me through the lake
By one a slave of flesh
They summon his return
In vain wasting their breath

The beauty and the beast
The beauty and the beast

They cast countless conjurations
He didn't sign the pact the fact is
Their screams of failure fade to whispers
Trying to heal their mental blisters

They summon through the sphere
A child so fair so golden pure
They didn't realise
This was the demon's cure

The beauty and the beast
The beauty and the beast
