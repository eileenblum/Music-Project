Laughing and screaming and bathing in blood.
Ripping at throats of the damned.
Lucifer's calling awakens his dogs,
Thrust from Lord Satan's left hand!

Carving our Satanic truss.
Dipped in the pure virgin soul,
feeding on us!
CARNIVEROUS!

Centuries measured by offerings made,
and openings made in the soul.
Steel razored teeth,ripping the flesh,
feeding the ultimate goal.

And making our sacrifice
hoping the lord is appeased?
and draining the life.
CARNIVEROUS!

[SOLO/Guitar]

Screaming and crying ,awakens the beast,
rising him from his dark lair.
Pulling and tearing and ripping the flesh,
Attaining the pure virgin fair.

And carving our satanic truss.
Dipped in the pure virgins soul.
CARNIVEROUS!
