Trapped inside Mazonic minds that simple thought denied,
No escape,no orifice,they're only drained through their eyes!

The mindless thoughts and afterglow,the scars that's left behind,
Drilled upon the cranium and sculpted deep in the mind!

How they writhe in pain,padded room of doom,

INSANE!

INSANE!

Pulling at the iron bars and tearing at the walls,
Screaming with Insanity but no-one hears the calls!

You know in truth your mind is clear but no-one's here to tell,
A frienzied madness echo's out inside your own brain-cell!

How they writhe in pain,
Padded room of doom!

Schizo

How they writhe in pain,
Padded room of doom,

INSANE!

A Venomous completion now is riddled through you veins,
Staring at the button padded walls,
INSANE!

Nothing left inside your head and empty, useless, tomb,
Here you live,alive, undead,inside your pillowed room!

How they writhe in pain,
Padded room of doom,
INSANE!

INSANE!

INSANE!

INSANE!
