The sad pretender reneges on every deal
Return to sender transparent lies revealed
The question corpses trapped
In a silent scream
Can't last the courses
Run a mile, kill the dream

The cult of larceny
Kill the music - kill the music
There's no integrity
Kill the fucking music

You're paranoia at finding out the truth
Your game is over it's time to cut you loose
A final last chance to prove your doubters wring
Now there's no last laugh
Lost all cred, stole the song

The cult of larceny
Kill the music - kill the music
You've no integrity
Kill the fucking music

She came to see you, offered it on a plate
Then panic struck you, pretending to be straight
Your basic hygiene is zero, not a bit
Your life is unclean, work it out, time to quit

The cult of larceny
Kill the music - kill the music
There's no integrity
Kill the fucking music

The cult of larceny
Kill the music - kick the habit
You've no integrity
Kill the fucking music
