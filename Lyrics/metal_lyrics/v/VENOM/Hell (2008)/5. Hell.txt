All the hate in this world I adore
Thousands of legions
With black heart core
Riding high are my horsemen of four
Nothings safe -
No one cares -- that's a fact

Hell - unholy kingdom ruled by war
Hell - pain and fury is the law
Hell - fire and brimstone I desire
Hell - Satan on his throne of fire

There's no love
For the priestess of hate
Babylon nests
In her kingdom and wars
Evil sanctuary screams and gyrates
Living hell -- lake of fire -- infernal
On the night that
The black angel fell
I opened the gate
For an entrance to hell
When he saw his
New kingdom to dwell
Set alight -- in the fire - of his rage
