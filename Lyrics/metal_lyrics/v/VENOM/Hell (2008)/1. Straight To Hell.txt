The gates slam in your face
Chill creeps down your spine
No one will let you in
Your guilty of the crimes
The judge and jury shout
Redemption denied -- yeah !
You're going straight to hell
You're going straight to hell
You hear them calling
Dark figures start the game
Then you start falling
They're calling out your name
No place in purgatory
You're heading for the flames -- hell
You scream repentance
Dressed in sackcloth and ash
But they won't save you
You're sentenced for the lash
No time to make amends
Satan starts to laugh -- yeah
