Dressed in black - dressed in black
Stressed in black - marches out to war
Screams attack - screams attack
Streams of black - for the overlord
Time to fight - time to fight
Fight or flight - swift blow to the head
Blackened night - mercy for the dead

The blood sky's calling you
You don't know what to do
The skies are bleeding yeah

Scream and shout - scream and shout
Shout it out - looking for release
Sharpened knife - sharpened knife
Sharpened life - hiding from the beast
Take a bite - take a bite
Bite is right - taste the winds of change
Watch them fight - watch them fight
Fuck and fight - bleeding for their rage

The blood sky's calling you
You don't know what to do
The skies are bleeding yeah

Blood sky bleeding

Watch your back - watch your back
Watch them back - this is where you die
Hold on tight - hold on tight
Hold it right - temper hides the cries
Bleeding axe - bleeding axe
Then attacks - blood raining down
Sink or swim - sink or swim
Seek to win - hand your king his crown

The blood sky's calling you
You don't know what to do
The skies are bleeding yeah
