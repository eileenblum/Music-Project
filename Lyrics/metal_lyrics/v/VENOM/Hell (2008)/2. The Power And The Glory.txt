Messiah the liar burning in Hell's fire
Forsaken awaken tragedy destiny
Magdalene open sin laughing crying
Enemy insanity Nazarene forgives thee

The Power and the Glory
The Power and the Glory

Arrogant sycophant up on high on a rant
Terminate agitate bring him down with a bang
Pity ye old clergy grovelling beasting
Tear them down hear me now tear them down now

The Power and the Glory
The Power and the Glory

They say the Devil wore black
As He walked through the pack
Of the unsuspecting fools
They were transfixed by the stars
And the words from afar
Using post hypnotic tools
When the enemy came
They were really all to blame
And who's cheating in the game

Open wide run a mile genocide taking lives
Tetragram holy man solitude living lies
Power trip papal sick ludicrous and unwise
Misanthrope from a rope on a cross die

The Power and the Glory
The Power and the Glory
