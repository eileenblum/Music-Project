Watch the Holy war
Armies by the score
Is this all that we deserve
Look around and see
All the killing fields
Like a lesson we must learn

All the misery - Hand of God
Violence and disease - Hand of God
Population losing faith
Devastating crime - Hand of God
No respect for life - Hand of God
Challenges that we must face - by the Hand of God

Desolate angels
Ride tsunami swells
Blame the climate on mankind
They say he sees all
Watching as we fall
Turns his back like he is blind

All the misery - Hand of God
Violence and disease - Hand of God
Population losing faith
Devastating crime - Hand of God
No respect for life - Hand of God
Challenges that we must face - by the Hand of God

Look deep inside - I shall fear no evil
Watch with evil eyes - I shall fear no evil

Look inside the shadow - valley of the shadow
The valley of the shadow of death - I shall fear no evil

When the end is near
And all there is fear
Can't justify those old beliefs
Raise your voice and yell
Smash the old church bells
Get up off your bended knees

All the misery - Hand of God
Violence and disease - Hand of God
Population losing faith
Devastating crime - Hand of God
No respect for life - Hand of God
Challenges that we must face - by the Hand of God
