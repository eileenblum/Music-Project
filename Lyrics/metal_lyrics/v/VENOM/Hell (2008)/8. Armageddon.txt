Smell the stench of the sick and the dying
Hear the cry of the lost ones denying
Hear the crack of your back, nothing's left
The soul surrenders - death remembers

Armageddon - end of days
Armageddon - end of ways

Pay the price for the world now ending
Cupboards bare all resources fading
It's too bad that you pray without trust
Life's diminished - our world's finished

Armageddon - end of days
Armageddon - end of ways

Now the end is in sight, you're all crying
Soon we'll all turn to dust, I'm not lying
Looking back, it's a fact, you had wealth
Laugh ignorance - now pay penance

Armageddon - end of days
Armageddon - end of ways
Armageddon - end of days
Armageddon - Armageddon
