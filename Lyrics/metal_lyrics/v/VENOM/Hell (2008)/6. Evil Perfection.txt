Looks across tile land - immortal through
The timeless sand - guttural
An ancient quest - an ancient rite
To find perfection evil
Demonic possession
Satanic aggression
My evil perfection
Demonic aggression
Satanic possession
My evil perfection
Evil comes or age - look at me
Turn another page - impatiently
A long lost dream - a long lost soul
To seek perfection evil
Calling out his name - religiously
Crowley went insane - undoubtedly
A book of spells - a curse of death
Beware perfection evil
Evil perfection
