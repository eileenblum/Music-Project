They pushed the button
And the sky turned instant black
They wouldn't heed the signs
Instead they heard attack
The end is nigh for this world
We scorched the skies
Now all we have is darkness
And our graves to lie

Evilution - devilution
Metamorphosis
Devilution - evilution
Mutant genesis

Just like the tales of old
And crazy scientist
We changed the DNA
Then flicked a coin and wished
Now like a ticking bomb
Genetic dynamite
A giant Frankenstein
Delivers wrong from right

Evilution - devilution
Metamorphosis
Devilution - evilution
Mutant genesis

Progressing three steps forward
Jumping ten steps back
Releasing hybrid germs
To multiply in packs
Mutated gene selections
What will we be
Heading off in all directions
Let's just wait and see

Evilution - devilution
Metamorphosis
Devilution - evilution
Mutant genesis
Evilution - devilution
Devilution - evilution
Evilution - devilution
Devilution - evilution
