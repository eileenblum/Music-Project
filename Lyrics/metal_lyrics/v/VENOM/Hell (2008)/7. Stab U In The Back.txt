Evil intentions - no apprehensions
Never repents when - consumed with greed
A dark alliance - forget compliance
Ever defiant - that's how it's seen

Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back

A vicious vampyr - burning in hellfire
Religious satire - won't save your soul
Forget the passion - accursed lies and
He takes it all on - then you're the fool

Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back

Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back
Stab you in the back
