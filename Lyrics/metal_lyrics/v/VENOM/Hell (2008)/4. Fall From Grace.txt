Myths and legends gather pace
Victims of the human race
Looks like a chemical war
Leaves you calling out for more
In the realm of danger signs
Forces you to commit crimes
In the end it's all it takes
You and all you know forsakes

Sakes - sakes - fall from grace

Born amidst a holy war
Sow the seeds with hook and claw
Blood rich soil increases yield
Growing in the battlefield
You can't know the future see
In a coma on your knees
Whispers from a smokey stake
Hypocrite for your god's sake

Sake - sake - fall from grace

Fall from grace

Frozen in a timeless gaze
Nothing left, you fall from grace
What's the point in killing time
Waiting for your time to die
Leave the lies for yesterday
Chasing dragons every way
Crack it open with a pick
All at once it makes you sick

Sick - sick - fall from grace
