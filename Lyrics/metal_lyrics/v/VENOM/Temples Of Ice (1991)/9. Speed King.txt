Good golly said little Miss Molly
Whe she was rockin in the house of the blue light
Tooty Fruity was oh so rotty
Rockin to the east and west
Loucile was oh so real
When she didn't do her daddy's will
Come on baby, drive me crazy
You can do it, you can do it

I'm a speed king, hear me sing
Yes, I'm a speed king, see me fly
Sat night and I just got paid
Gonna fool about now aint gonna save
People gonna rock, people gonna roll
Gonna have a party to save my soul
Heard headed woman, soft heart man
they been causin trouble since it all began
Take a little rice, take a little beans
gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans

Cause I'm a speed king
hear me sing, speed king, see me fly
Good golly said little Miss Molly
Whe she was rockin in the house of the blue light
Tooty Fruity was oh so rotty
Rockin to the east and west
Heard headed woman, soft heart man
they been causin trouble since it all began
Take a little rice, take a little beans
gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans
