My brain fed with ecstacy
Fills my need
As I feel my body burst with great speed
And I clench a needle in a blood drained fist
Then I turn and mark another trip off my list

Feel that rush, with that gold satanic dust
feel that pain, the drug induce through my veins

I will in life as I will in death
Sow the seeds with every breath
Never will I run, never will I hide
Only to express myself and feel it deep inside

Acid

Now I dream in comatose neuotic state
As my paranoia grows I must wait
Til the feeling of the drug starts to die
Then I'll hit the drug again, take me high

Feel that buzz, for all the goddam good it does
Feel the flight, that flies me in through day and night

Now inside my arteries there's no blood
