The thouht of you has plagued my years
I see you now
Crawling all over me
Symptom of my darkest fears
With me now
Living inside of me

In the night
As you sleep
the web begins to form
Across your face to suffocate
And kill before the dawn

Arachnid

Strangely drawn towards her lair certain death,
she wants to be part of you
Lie in wait my choice of mate
I can't resist she
Bites and devours you

Lift your body
From the ground
Strech octapoidal limbs
Leave the web
Without a sound
The fantasy begins
Come into the parlour said the spider to the fly
Not really knowing that the end is drawing nigh
Making love in ecstacy, the venom she injects
Death is swift, limbs entwined amid arachnid sex

The scent you spread I know so well
could leave me dead
Hopelessly mesmerised
Your bite will mean the end to me
Can you see I'm
Helplessly hypnotised

Panic stricken
Terrified
Cocooned within the web
Arachnophobic
Misery
Release me from this living nightmare

If I stalk you must forgive me
For this dance is my chemistry
