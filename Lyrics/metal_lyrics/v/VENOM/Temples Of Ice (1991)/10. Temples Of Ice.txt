Questioning the future with flaming intent
I kneel before the temples of ice
Crystalised walls rise to 10,000 feet
Behind lies th answers to life

My cold breathless pain, makes me hunger for fire
Must forge on, must remain and fulfil my desire
Inside temples of

Running the tunnels, the icy walls scaled
I strech for the welfare of heat
Staring through clouds of my own fog-soaked breath
The challenge that I must defeat

My heart sinks in fear, as I seek but can't tell
I feel death drawing near, as I reach into hell
Here, in temples of ice

Here now, in my mind's esy
Lost my sight, my soul I find decaying into dust

ICE - Temples Of
ICE - Temples Of
