Dark skies war cries to fight
She flies men rise who dies
Black fire in flight no sight
The wise in guise tonight

Wings of Valkyrie

Who rise decides their fates
Your pride in dark awakes

Wings of Valkyrie

Reprise in sight for all
No light in Hell they fall

Wings of Valkyrie
Wings of Valkyrie
