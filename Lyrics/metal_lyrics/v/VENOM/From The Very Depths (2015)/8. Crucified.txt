All I see lies designed to suffocate &amp; choke
Sacrifice hallowed be thy name
The mighty have fallen condemned are the priests
All you feel terror wrapped in pain

As you hang forsaken
In your hour of need
As we watch you die - Crucified

God of war fight the good fight hypocrite (huh)
Suffocate truth revealed as shame
It's a farce religion carnage &amp; deceit
Roll the dice rapture never came

As you hang forsaken
In your hour of need
As we watch you die - Crucified

...And I ask why, why in the blazing
fires of hell, snatched from Lillith's
womb, by bile and bitter, though
Lucifer's child, indeed a pure man, or
a god from an abomination I say to
all, come unto thee, whilst I breathe
and heart beat aloud

All alone now the vultures salivate your bones
Come to Hell see your words decay
The mighty have fallen condemned are the priests
It's a race souls aren't yours to save

As you hang forsaken
In your hour of need
As we watch you die - Crucified
