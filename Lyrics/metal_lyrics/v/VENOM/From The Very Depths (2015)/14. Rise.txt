All ye sinners rise raise your hands &amp; fists
With fire in your eyes show no mercy
Ancient battle cries call to arms in war
Never compromise take no prisoners

Rise ~ Rise ~ Rise
Rise ~ Rise ~ Rise

Hold your head up high never we retreat
Made of flesh &amp; blood we are perfect
Ancient battle cries metal to the core
Make them realise we are legions

Rise ~ Rise ~ Rise
Rise ~ Rise ~ Rise
Rise ~ Rise ~ Rise
Rise ~ Rise ~ Rise

Oh yeah - Are you feeling wild? - Hell yeah

All ye sinners rise fighting hands &amp; fists
With fire in your eyes show no mercy
Ancient battle cries call to arms in war
Never compromise take no prisoners

Rise ~ Rise ~ Rise
Rise ~ Rise ~ Rise
