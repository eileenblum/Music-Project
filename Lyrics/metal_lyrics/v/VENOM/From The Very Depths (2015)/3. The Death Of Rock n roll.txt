A medication for the soul
We're fast and furious interstellar glow
Ain't gonna change what we do
Atomic metal motherfuckers
Coming through

Light up the marshall stacks
We're killing King Creole
With devastating thrash
The death of rock n roll yeah

We met the devil at the gates
Not at the crossroads or by humiliate
The man of blues can sell his soul
We'd rather party with the demons...
down below

Light up the marshall stacks
We're killing King Creole
With devastating thrash
The death of rock n roll yeah

Lay down your soul to all the gods
A king shall have his day but forever not
The Jailhouse Rock has a new note
So go and R.I.P. ah that's all she wrote

Light up the marshall stacks
We're killing King Creole
With devastating thrash
The death of rock n roll yeah

Light up the marshall stacks
We're killing King Creole
With devastating thrash
Rock n roll is dead
