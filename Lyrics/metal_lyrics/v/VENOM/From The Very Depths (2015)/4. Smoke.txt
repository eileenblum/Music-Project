Beware my curse for I am ghost
From where I came in pain it ends
You're breathing in I'm taking out
I will destroy &amp; I will shout

Smoke
Like a storm in the night
Rising up to take flight

Open your eyes they bleed &amp; weep
Can't see your face in distant fires
Looking at pain in pleasure stale
I am the air that you inhale

Smoke - Smoke

Inhale my life my blackened lies
Filling the air I pity not
Forever young prepare to die
Glorious smoke I'm taking life

Smoke
As a storm never
Into infinity flies
