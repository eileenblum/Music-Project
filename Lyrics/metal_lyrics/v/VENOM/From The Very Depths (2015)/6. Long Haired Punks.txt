Bat out of hell, engines ablaze, riding the night, flying through days
Hell bent for mayhem, so full of spunk, black metal gods, long haired punks
A deadly quest, disgusting and damned
Dogs of mayhem don't give a damn, screaming aloud, fucked up and drunk
Y'all watch out, we're the long haired punks

A bad example, up for a fight, breaking the law, demonic delight
A dark destroyer, morals are sunk, we're power metal, long haired punks
A deadly quest, disgusting and damned, dogs of mayhem, don't give a damn
Screaming aloud, fucked up and drunk
Y'all watch out, we're the long haired punks, yeah!

Fight for survival, hitting the road, get out my way, time for a show
We blast metal, no hip hop or funk, demons from hell, long haired punks
A deadly quest, disgusting and damned, dogs of mayhem who don't give a damn, screaming aloud, fucked up and drunk, y'all watch out we're the long haired punks!
