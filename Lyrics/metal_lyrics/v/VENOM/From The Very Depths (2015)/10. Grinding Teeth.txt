Liar liar all I hear deceives
The blood is gonna boil
Make your mind up what should I believe?
the trouble &amp; turmoil

The raging beast awakes
Tempers intensity
Malice brutality
Anger roars - Grinding teeth

Anger anger biting at the bit
The point of no return
There's no just spewing out your shit
You know you're gonna burn

The raging beast awakes
Tempers intensity
Malice brutality
Anger roars - Grinding teeth

Fighter fighter riding out of Hell
The leather &amp; the speed
Make me stronger I'm the sentinel
I hit the road &amp; bleed

The raging beast awakes
Tempers intensity
Malice brutality
Anger roars
Callous and merciless
Vicious oratory
Rhetorical debris
Anger roars anger roars
Anger roars - Grinding teeth
