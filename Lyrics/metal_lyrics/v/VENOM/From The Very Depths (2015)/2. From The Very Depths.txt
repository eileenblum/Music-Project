Confess spit it out - I won't ask you twice
All hear the great noise - As you roam the night
The devil's mother's anger - Sister of the beast
Temptations ultra vile - All sins released

I'll ask the question - You will confess
Worshipping Satan - From the very depths

Rise up feel the fear - It's the witching Hour
Grimen excepta - Maleficarum
Your septic dark familiars
Wild ceremonies
The vestal virgin cries - All blessed be

I'll ask the question - You will confess
Do you worship Satan? - From the very depths

Bit back blasphemy - What thou wilt command
The Witches pendle - Satan's Command
By torture inquisition - Do our dirty deeds
Burn all show no mercy - All cursed ye

Asking the question - Blood tears and sweat
Summoning Satan - From the very depths...
Of Hell
