The holy walls are falling down
Beyond the grave the saints renounce
Their hunting for the silent witness
The churches burn in desperate sickness

Stigmata - Stigmata
Stigmata - Stigmata
Stigmata Satanas

The pagan rites spread like disease
A lust of angels bursting dreams
Their loins are burning yearning life
Their sin original delights

Stigmata - Stigmata
Stigmata - Stigmata
Stigmata Satanas

Inside the oracle destroys
The sirens lure the men like boys
Enchanting songs to break your heart
An angel weeps as souls depart
