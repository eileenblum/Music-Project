Every night I'm in a different town,
I'm the kind that likes to get around,
Living fast I'm on the run,
I take my chances cos' I'll only die young.

Live like an angel die like a devil,
Got a place in hell reserved for me,
Live like an angel die like a devil,
Gonna burn in hell that's where I'm gonna be.

I got no worries I don't care what I do,
I'm gonna walk all over you,
Loving hard and getting high,
Hell's the place I'm gonna die.

You hear me coming just get out of my way,
I'm here tomorrow and I'm gone today,
The path I'm heading got no easy track,
I got the devil riding on my back.
