Searching through regions of light here in my dark thoughts I call for you to come
Paralysed and fixed to the wall awaiting the judgement awaiting you to call out
I'm paralysed calling out I'm paralysed ah
There's no reason for me have gone only the clothing protecting me from me
Lost in this insane recall let me know I will be safe from my only way out
Calling out I'm paralysed ah calling out I'm paralysed ah
Now caught from pins in her hair biting and bending to sharpen up the point
Slipping it into the lock freeing myself to penetrate and cause death
I'm paralysed calling out I'm paralysed ah out
