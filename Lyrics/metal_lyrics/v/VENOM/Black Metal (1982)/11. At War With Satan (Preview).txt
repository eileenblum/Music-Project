A dark silhouette of a creature, poised, crouched on the corner of a cliff's edge,
waits eagerly, eyes glare patiently,
red eyes filled with fire and torment gleam with a frenzied brightness across the shadowed valleys below

A crack of thunder breaks the deafening silence which once ruled the plains.
The creature is unmoved by the commotion of the noise,
and the blinding fork of lightning which strikes only a few yards from where it lays in wait for something

Satan laughs

Wings spread in a magnificent fullness the creature stands in full glory,
inhaling deeply, the ice cold air,
each tendon and muscle ripping in an almighty stance of the great dimensional deity

Lucifer smiles

From the far far west a chariot of fire emerges traveling at a tremendous speed toward the creature

The creature laughs

As if in a maddened state of mind the creature leaps up off the ridge and hovers with dignity in the now cloudless sky,
it's long red hair blowing freely in the wind.
The chariot emerges and with a sharp swift movement,
the creature takes the reins and flies off into the night,
howling out immortal cries of predication and war.

"At War With Satan"

Warriors gather slowly round the sacred city hell
Satan screams a vengeance on the land his angels fell
Tyrants pray disaster for the land of love and trust
Demons plot a way to turn the heaven into dust....
