Pain -
Ripping through your senses
Screaming in torment
Waiting to die

Mental strangulation -
Choking all belief
Psychic execution -
Razor sharp relief

Pain -
Tearing through your mind
Electro insanity
Chemically blind

Hypodermic hell -
Surgery through veins
Intravenous madness -
Fucking with your brain -

Tranquilise-neutralise
Anaesthetise-paralyse

Pain -
No one hears your scream
Surgical murder
Halothane dream

Stainless nightmare-bed of steel
By dissection-cause revealed
Slient protest-laid to bare
Final insult-no-one cares
