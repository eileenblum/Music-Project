Three score years and ten
Where is armageddon
You promised us the end
A world in flames

The next millenium
Where is the liars son
Pathetic old reasons
A world in fear

Man myth &amp; magic

Glory be unto ye
The suffering won't ease
On high within a dream
A world of games

Symbol of distrust
Predicting all is lost
The shepherds lost his flock
In words of seers

Man myth &amp; magic

A game of war &amp; peace
Respect for the deceased
Your soul is out on lease
Old world beliefs

Vultures at the door
From rich man to the poor
What are you waiting for
A world of shames

Man myth &amp; magic
