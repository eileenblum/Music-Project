Cross your heart &amp; hope to die
You superstitious fool
Yours is not to question why
Yours is to obey the rules
Totally irrational
Fear bred for fears sake
Your choice is unconditional
Fear decides the path you take

Mirror mirror tarot dealer
Seven years now shall believer
Punish me my faith healer
Aces high - devils eye

Thirteen - thirteen

Psyche - illogic lunacy
Deity or triple six
Read your bible say a prayer
&amp; hide behind your crucifix
Walk beneath the golden stairs
Rape the holy trinity
Break a mirror if you dare
&amp; damn you for eternity

Mirror mirror on the wall
Seven years now shall i fall
Punish me for my beliefs
&amp; let my cries come unto ye

Thirteen - thirteen - thirteen
Thirteen - thirteen - thirteen
Thirteen - thirteen
