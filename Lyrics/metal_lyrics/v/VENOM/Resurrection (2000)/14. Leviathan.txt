In distant darkened lands
Where life &amp; death defy the sands
Of time are running out for you
Too late the cry was heard

All hallowed be they shame
Delivered unto evil
Temptation be thy name
Behold thy fallen angels

From prophecies of ancient times
An unborn wisdom heeds the cries
Of every infants new born eyes
Shall lead the blind

And shall the serpent crucify
The holy man &amp; take his eyes
To bring the darkness to the light
And let him die

Forgive us not our sins
The power &amp; the glory
All hail the demon king
&amp; man shall kneel before him

His name-leviathan
Kneel-leviathan
