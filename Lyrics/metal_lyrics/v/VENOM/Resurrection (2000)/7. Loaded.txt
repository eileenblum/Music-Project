You pray for salvation
Your soul you would sell
Avoiding damnation
And those who reign in hell
A game for the liar
But who pays the price
The stakes getting higher
Take your chance &amp; roll the dice

Loaded - loaded - you lose !

The shade can't disguise
The lies in your eyes
Give it to you on a plate
Take it from the one you hate
Eleventh hour fuck up
Bite the head that feeds &amp; walk away

Loaded - in your head
Believe the things you've said
Loaded - in your eyes
Out of sight &amp; out of mind
Loaded - in your mind
The truth is hard to find
Loaded - walk away
&amp; live to die another day

Its all there for the taking
But how far can you run
There's no use in repenting
The damage has been done
Every waking moment
You're living on the edge
Welcome to the judgement day
You're staring down the barrel......

And it's - loaded - any last requsets?
Game over!
