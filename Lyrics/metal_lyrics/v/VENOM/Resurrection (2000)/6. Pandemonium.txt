Stretching their arms out
Towards you clenching fists
Inhaling atmospheres
From hot fiery pits
Laughter announces
The musical war
Crowley pronounces
A mystical law

Pandemonium
Pandemonium

Screaming &amp; shouting
Smashing your head
Songs of our pasts
Songs of the dead
Echanting ceremonies
Of the flesh
Speed into thrash
Black into death

Pandemonium
Pandemonium

Furious souls
In a chaos of sound
Traders in black
&amp; the dark underground
Metal militia
Malevolent minds
Pandemonium
Begins to unwind

Pandemonium
Pandemonium
