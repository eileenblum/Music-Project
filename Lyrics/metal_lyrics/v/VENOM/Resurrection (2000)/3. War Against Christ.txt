Set alight in purgatory
Tormented moans of pain
Piercing dark analogies
Spat out in full disdain

War against christ
War against christ
War against christ

Diabolus awaits you
Tearing the flesh from bone
Slicing edge of sharpened steel
Terror to call your own

War against christ
War against christ
War against christ

Earth cracks asunder
Sharpens the bass to point
Echoes summoning r'lyeh
To agony anoint

War against christ
War against christ
War against christ
