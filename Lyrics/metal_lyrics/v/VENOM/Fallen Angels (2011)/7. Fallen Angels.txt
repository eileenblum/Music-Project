At the dawn when time began
Blink of ravenâs eye
Prophecies of the great beast
That God could not deny
Frantic in creations for
A creature called mankind
With the gift of a free will
Let Satan in their mind

Cast from heaven
Damned to hell
In the beginning
Angels fell

With a choice to reign in hell
Or serve in heavenâs law
Angels did not hesitate
To take their chance below
Cherubim &amp; seraphim
United in their quest
Lucifer would lead the way
The one he loved the best
Lies of heaven
Lies of hell
Through the ages
Mankind fell

Dragons rise â Then priests die - Heaven cries

Hell unites - &amp; man fights â Hypnotised

Broken laws â Predators â Satanâs hordes

In hell jaws â Heaven falls â Then no more

Look at the children of Fallen Angels
Free in a world of the Fallen Angels
No more lies â The fallen rise
