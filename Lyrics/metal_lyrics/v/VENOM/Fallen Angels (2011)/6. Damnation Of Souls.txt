Open gates so hell floods out
Unleash the hordes
Twisted faces painful shouts
With knives &amp; swords
Screaming vengeance anarchy
Tormented cries
Hungry beaten angry souls
Lost in lies

Centuries â torturing
Damnation of souls
Angelsâ fate â end of days
Damnation of souls

Bible regulations
Manâs freedom of will
If you donât conform to him
Fires &amp; torment spills
Youâll be damned to blackened pits
Death by every means
Love the sinner hate the sin
Only he redeems

In the battle of the gods
Angels did defy
Vanquished into purgatory
To suffer not to die
Such an evil act to make
Of your childrenâs love
Harbouring eternal hale
For that god above
