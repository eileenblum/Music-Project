Racing like a madman high on
The extreme

Donât know where Iâm goinâ
No clue to where Iâve been

Everything around me fades
Into a blur

Nevert stop â Reach the top
Out of this world

Donât need no provocation
My instincts high on fire
The final destination
Will be the place that I die
Pedal to the metal

Speed through every border
Nothing to declare

Got no time for questions no
Answers anywhere

Flying like a comet only trails &amp; mist
Watch the clock â Off the top
Nothing else exist
