They say the screams of terror from
The dying slaves &amp; the loyal

Weâre drowned out by the noise from
The blazing fires &amp; sandstone walls

Which separated them from the
Procession outside who chanted

&amp; sang aloud on this their most
Ceremonious of nights

Spirit of pharaohs â Rise to
The stars

Their mortal shell stays â In the
Valley of the Kings

Worship the pharaohs â Children
Of gods

Their earthly symbols â In the Valley
Of the Kings

The unheard cries of the tortured
Souls lay buried deep in the bowels

Made thick unearthly air with a sense
Of sinister foreboding

Even the cold night sky saw not a
Cloud nor star was moving

Caught in the crossfire of sadness &amp;
Fear of the pyramid

In the Valley of the Kings
