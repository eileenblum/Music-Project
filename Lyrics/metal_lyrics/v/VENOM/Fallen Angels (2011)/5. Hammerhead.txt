In tribal cantation
Fantastic revelation

Demanding withstanding
The energy is blinding

Believing receiving exactly
What weâre needing

Beholding unfolding see clearly
Where weâre going

-Run towards your goal
-The metalâs in your soul

Hammerhead â Hammerhead
Hammerhead â Headbanger

Weâre standing &amp; shouting while
Punching air in timing

The sound of the mayhem is really
All weâre here for

Whatever the season we never
Need a reason

You know Iâm not lying, some things
Are well worth dying (for)

-Race towards your goal
-Black metalâs in your soul

Hammerhead â Hammerhead
Hammerhead â Headbanger

You look to the future you donât
Know if it suits you

Then take it or leave it wonât
Force you to believe it

But donât come back crying, weâre
Off again &amp; flying

We live for the metal no other
For weâd settle

-Run towards your goal
-The metalâs in your soul
