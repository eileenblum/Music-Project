When youâre least expecting my call
Or at the end â Life descends â Olden age you fall

Just remember Iâm a promised fact
Thereâs no way around fate â No secret pact

Many through the ages they have tried
Believe me that I know â They all failed &amp; died

Death be thy name/Death be thy name
Death be thy name/Death be thy name

Searching for an ancient tale or myth
Read it on a book or heard it from the wind

Takes you to the edges of the earth
Even try to steal it from the newly breathed

But your efforts are a waste of time
You canât hide forever â Youâll still be mine

Aarghhh Iâm coming to get youâ¦

Now the scientist misunderstood
Canât make immortality inside a test tube
I donât know if I should laugh or cry
Take it as an insult or credit youâre trying

But for now the old saying holds fast
He who laughs the longest is he
Who laughs last
