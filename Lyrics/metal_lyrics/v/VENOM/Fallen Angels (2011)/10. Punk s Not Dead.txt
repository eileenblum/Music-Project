Donât take no shit stand up make it
Donât let them get you down
Love it hate it fuck it fake it
But you will never drown
You take âem all to hell &amp; back

Punkâs not dead â Punkâs not dead

Roll it taste it suck it chase it
Taking it like a man
Smoke it blaze it drink it waste it
Do anything you can

Punkâs not dead it never died
You canât kill a way of life
It donât matter about your age
Itâs how you feel itâs not a phase

Sign it seal it find it deal it
Setting the price decreed
Break it fix it raise it sink it
Planting the demon seed

Destroy
