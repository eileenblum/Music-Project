Rich man poor man beggarman thief
Youâre like a child with your beliefs
Writer fighter worker of chief
Let everybody down
Give me give me everyday beg
You feel down &amp; banged your head
Junkie lies with a broken leg
Youâll never wear a crown

You are the beggarman
Beggarman thief
You are the beggarman

Big man small man comedy clown
You sing &amp; dance sink &amp; drown
Take a step &amp; you fall down
It never is you fault
Lord &amp; master sickening curse
In the back of your own hearse
I really donât know which is worse
A milligram of salt

You are the beggarman
Beggarman thief
You are the beggarman

Rich man poor man beggarman thief
You take the piss, beggarman belief
Poor man beggarman liar &amp; thief
The only life you know
Big man small man hero or clown
You live a life thatâs grey &amp; brown
Small man beggarman all fall down
Now itâs your time to go
