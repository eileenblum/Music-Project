Do you feel disgusted?
Have you found you guilty?
Do you hide your eyes?
Stealing your sanity
Pride will make them angry
Lust &amp; greed they envy
Overdose gluttony
I am sloth &amp; Iâm bored with your

Do you hide away?
Are your walls transparent?
For he sees it all
Your sadistic parent

Now youâve found your way
&amp; the truth was easy
Never gonna pray
For whatâs mine &amp; should be
