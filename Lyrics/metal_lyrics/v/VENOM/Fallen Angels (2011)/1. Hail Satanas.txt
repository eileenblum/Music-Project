All hail Satanas â Lucifer
He walks among us â Everywhere
The fallen angel â Is the light
His throne of diamonds â The most high

Through the stones of fire
Blameless in your ways
Sing unholy choir
His glorious name â Lucifer/Evil One

All hail Satanas â Diabolus
He stands beside you â One of us
Star of the morning â The son of dawn
A realm of sinners â Fires burn

Through the stones of fire
Blameless in your ways
Sing satanic choirs
His infernal names â Baphomet/Diabolus

Hail Satan
Archangel
Hail Satan
Archangel

Commend me father for
I have sinned

Hail Satan
Archangel
Hail Satan
Archangel
Hail Satan
Archangel
Hail Satan!
