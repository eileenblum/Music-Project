Raised in hell's infernal flame
raised to rule on earth
Crucify the martyrs soul
To give the infant birth
Hearts of titans powerful
Fighting the good fight
Lillith puts him to her breast
And holds him in delight

Raised in hell - raised in hell
Raised in hell - raised in hell

Raised in hell by sorcery
Raised with pride of sin
Legions roar as churches fall
My reign can now begin
Souls of saturn enter me
The battle has begun
Belphegor brings mars and war
To please his masters son

Raised in hell - raised in hell
Raised in hell - raised in hell

Raised in hell's black magic
Raised of demon seed
Dying at the witching hour
A virgins soul for me
Minds of Magic conjugate
The spells of potions purge
Hold the black horse ready
For the lord of this world

Raised in hell - raised in hell
Raised in hell - raised in hell
