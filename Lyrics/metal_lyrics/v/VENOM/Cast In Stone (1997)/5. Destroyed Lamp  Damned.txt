I write these words as witness to the crime
You throw them back and say the crime is mine
I balance life and death now you deny
I read these words aloud and watch you die
I sit and watch you die

Your flesh will feed my land,
one day you'll understand
I breed thee - I feed thee - I feed thee, you bite the
hand that feeds thee
Protect me - reject me, spat me out and reserect thee
Belie me - deny me, then rape and crucify thee

Destroyed and damned

Your soul as mist and dust, old bones powdered and crushed
You gut me - and fuck me, you burn and you insult thee
Pollute me - uproot me, the treason absoluetly
Deface me - embrace me, you strangle then erase thee

Destroyed and damned

If you know not what you do - if you gamble
will you lose If you're guilty of the crime - do you live or
do you die - I sit and watch you die

The sands of time will fade can't stop the life decay
I raise thee - disgrace me, insanity replace thee
Impale me - inhale me, your lungs begin to fail thee
You eat me - deplete me, an endless overloading

Destroyed and damned
Destroyed and damned
