Fighting and biting white thunder and lightning
Chasing the locust on its trail
Movements of majyk, false moves become tragic
According to winds how we sail

Flight of the hydra
Flight of the hydra

Snare of the pharaoh remember now they know
Or knew of the universe vast
Sign of the symbol finds passageway's nimble
Revealing the old satanas

Flight of the hydra
Flight of the hydra

Flight of the night - flight of the soul
Flight of your life - spirit of gold - rara avis

Searching and searing sarcastically feeding
Deceiving the truth from the next
Enchantment embrases the snake as it ages
Awaiting the life that is next

Flight of the hydra
Flight of the hydra
