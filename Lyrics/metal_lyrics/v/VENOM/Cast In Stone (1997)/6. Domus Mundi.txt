Feel the dirt, beneath my fingers
Taste the soil, inside my mouth
Muscles screaming, soundless cries
Silent staring, of a thousand eyes

Blood is pumping - through my veins
Tendond tearing - while fragile life remains
Ears are bursting - sight filled with dust
Cry out in pain - when will this end

Choking nightmares
Bleeding eyes
Holloow voices
Silent cries - I win

Blood is pumping, sight unseen
Silent prayer from lifeless lips
My ears are bursting, a mother's cry
Blood that from a still heart drips

Where I wander - do you follow
If you cut me - do I bleed
Do we die - with each single exhalation
Born again - with newly savoured breath

Choking nightmares
Bleeding eyes
Holloow voices
Silent cries

Choking nightmares
Bleeding eyes
Holloow voices
Silent cries - I win
