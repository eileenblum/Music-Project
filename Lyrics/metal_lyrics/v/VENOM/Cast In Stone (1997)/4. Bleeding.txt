Bleeding Bleeding - lying in the gutter of your death

Destroy - obey Broken - decay

Bleeding - lying in the gutter of your breath Bleeding - squeezing you till
there is nothing left

Destroy - obey
Broken - decay

Bleeding
Bleeding - lying in the gutter you call life

Destroy - obey
Destroy - decay
Destroy - broken
Destroy
