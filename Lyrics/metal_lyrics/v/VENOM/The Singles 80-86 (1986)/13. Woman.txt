Sorceress of old love potions
Brew an orgy strong
Priestess of the highest order
Light the fires of song
Chime the bell
Raising hell
Nothing can go wrong
Trascend in motion make
The wheels of life revolve

WOMAN

Wicked witch of yesterlands
Bring your spirit here
Tell us of your day of judgement
Reinact your fear
Dance in the flame
Nude without shame
For all to see
I'll take a trip with you
To make your innocence clear

Whore of leisure whore of sin
Name your hourly price
Take me home &amp; give me pleasure
Treat me oh so nice
Legs open wide
Take me inside
I won't throw your dice
I wanna taste the caves of flesh
Within your face
