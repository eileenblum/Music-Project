The life beneath the tombs
Ignores the light of day
Suspictious minds decide
The fate you have to pay
The judge and jury
Cast aside your mortal shell
Rebel - it's your hell
Protect your lair

Armed to the teeth
Savage of sin
Guardian of lies
Fuck off and die
You bastards

Insane assassin catches
On to what is not
Behind his sanctuary
The soul begins to rot
In time the lie approaches
To your firelight soul
Son of diabolous
And purpose stole

Caught in the flames
Soldiers of death
Hold your pride high
Fuck off and die and die

Inside the sacred halls
Contain the sacres truths
Our fathers cry as we
Revive our blackened roots
The ways of old shall
Lead us to the final crest
And when the pact is dealt
We'll wake eternal rest

Chained to your soul
Armies of pain
Mortals despise
Fuck off and die
