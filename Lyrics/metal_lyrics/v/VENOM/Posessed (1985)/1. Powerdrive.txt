Hotter than an atom bomb
Holocaust so vast
While devastation is our homeland
Light ain't all that fast
Vesuvius erupts our tune
Igniting all in reach
Leaving all in purgatory
Until time decides to teach

Power Drive
Power Drive
Power Drive

Wilder than a charging beast
Our methods set on death
Elements recharge our songs
No time to catch your breath
The Richter scale determines
If our instruments in tune
Candle light the new volcano
Power shines the moon
Laser lights the soul until
The final curtain drops

Power Drive
Power Drive
Power Drive

Corpses guard there dynasty
But power never dies
See our raging bolts of hell
And mayhem in your eyes
Exorcet the boiling oil
The volume never stops
Laser lights the soul until
The final curtains dropped
Leaving all in purgatory
Until time decides to teach

Power Drive
Power Drive
Power Drive
