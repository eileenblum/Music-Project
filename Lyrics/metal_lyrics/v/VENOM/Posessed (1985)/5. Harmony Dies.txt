Harmony dies
Demons calling to Hell
Wise ways ye cannot sell
Praying fools light their ways
Night descends shrouds the day
Unveil the hysterskies
Immortal children cry
Question of when and why

Harmony dies

Sacrifice the solstice
Casting out the priestess
Anger lingers in death
Waiting the for the last breath
Hell has no disguise
Just look through Satan's eyes
When dogs of war can fly

Harmony dies

Death is fighting with death
Time shall feed on what's left
Prophets on the altar
Voicing his words of war
Walk through their sacred fires
The halls of souls admire
But as the end grows nigh

Harmony dies
