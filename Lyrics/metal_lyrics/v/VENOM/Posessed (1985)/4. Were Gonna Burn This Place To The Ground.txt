Light the fires now

If you want some action
Don't you take a seat
In the darkness we're gonna
Knock you off your feet
Dancing with the devil
Feel the scorching heat
Evacuate the dance floor
We're making hell tonight

We ain't talking bullshit
We ain't fucking around

We're gonna burn this place to the ground

We're not here to entertain you
We're gonna make you scream
When you wake in Hell tonight
You'll think it was a dream
Feel the razor fangs of fire
You'll wish you weren't born
Cry the cries of every man
Are you getting warm?

We ain't talking bullshit
We ain't fucking around

We're gonna burn this place to the ground

Hells the only answer
When rock and roll gets tough
We ain't yet packing up yet
No we ain't had enough
If you'd like to gamble
Get up here with me
Taste the fiery flames of death
Not immortality

We not talking fucking bullshit
We're gonna burn this place to the ground

To the ground
Burn this place to the ground
We're gonna burn this place to the ground
