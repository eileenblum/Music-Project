Black is the night, metal we fight
Power amps set to explode
Energy screams, magic and dreams
Satan records the first note
We chime the hell, chaos and hell
Metal for maniacs pure
Fast melting steel, fortune on wheels
For Black Metal
Lay down your soul to the gods rock n' roll

Freaking so wild, nobody's mild
Giving it all that you've got
Wild is so right, metal tonight
Faster than over the top
Open the door, enter hell's core
Black is the code for tonight
Atomic force, feel no remorse
Crank up the amps now it's night
Black Metal
Lay down your soul to the gods rock n' roll
Metal ten fold through the deadly black hole
Riding hell's stallions bareback and free
Faking our chances with raw energy

Come ride the night with us
Rock hard and fight
United my legions we stand
Freak hard and wild for us
Give up your souls
Live for the guest Satan's band

Against the odds, black metal gods
Fight to achieve our goal
Casting a spell, leather and hell
Black metal gods rock n' roll
Building up steam, nuclear screams
Warheads are ready to fight
Black leather hounds, faster than sound
Metal our purpose in life
Black Metal
Lay down your soul to the gods rock n' roll
Black Metal
