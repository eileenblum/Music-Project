Come on turn it up!

Madness

Stalking the night
Feeding fast on my prey
Draining the life
'Til the dawn of the day
Drinking and sucking
The blood rushing sweet
Half crazed with glory
Half crazed in the heat

Bloodlust

Tearing the flesh
Of the weak and the child
Sparing no one
The meek and the mild
I sink my fangs in your
Neck as you dream
I am Count Cronos
Vampire Supreme

Bloodlust

Bloodlust upon me
I'm biting the flesh
I'll take away
Your God given breath
Now I shall feast
On your life giving blood
Leave you to die
On the land you once stood

Bloodlust
