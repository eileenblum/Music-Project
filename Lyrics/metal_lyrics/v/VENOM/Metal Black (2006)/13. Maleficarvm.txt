Dark ages - Plague rages
Satan lives / Satanica
Death races - Dead faces - 666 / Satanica

Maleficarvm

Tormented - Demented
Relentless / Satanica
No saviour - You die here
Reaper says / Satanica

Maleficarvum - Maleficarvum

Bleeding demon souls - Falling down
Death in every town - All around
Some call it the end - Calling now
No one wears a crown
Maleficarvm

Speaking loud in ancient tongue
Worship moon or worship sun
From the knowledge of the old
Come the tales of mighty souls
Rise - Fall - Into hell

In the lightning in the skies
I can see it in your eyes
Armageddon will arise
And the planets will collide
Rise - Fall - Into hell - Into hell

Time to die - Old and wise - You and I / Satanica
All a lie - Angels die - Life denied / Satanica
