Lost in the shadows, gaze into the void
Feeding the bastards, rebirth or destroy

Hours of darkness
Turn on the night
Awaken ebony
Begin twilight

Late in December coldness deadly chill
The night is calling, it's kill or be killed

Kill kill - Be killed
Kill kill - Be killed - Kill

Fading to blackness, Flat out on your back
Reveals the answer, the time to attack

Hours of darkness
Turn on the night
Awaken ebony
Begin twilight
Hours of darkness
Turn into the night
Eclipse is darkening
Black wings flight
