Old man death sits all alone
In quiet contemplation
Picking at his blackened nails
Waiting for his next victim
Watching as your life force drains
Your end is nigh
Happily he comes to take your soul
Before you die

Old man death - Death &amp; dying

Old man death expressionless
Staring into nowhere
Duty bound collecting souls
Pleas for mercy wasted
He's the one stands at the gates
Past death's immigration
Take a ride to the other side
Don't ask dumb questions

Old man death angel accursed
King of afterlife
Ancient as the sands of time
His tempus fugit cries
With a choice of short &amp; swift
Or everlasting pain
Old man death decides your fate
Death is all the same

Old man death - Death &amp; dying
