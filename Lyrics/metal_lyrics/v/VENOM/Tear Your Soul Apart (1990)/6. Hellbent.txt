Seek him here seek him on the highway never knowing when he'll appear
All await engine's ticking over hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels a glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams from a streak of fire as he strikes
Hell bent hell bent for metal hell bent hell bent for metal
Black as night faster than a shadow crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition of sheer precision yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams crash one by one to the ground
Hell bent hell bent for metal hell bent hell bent for metal
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
Hell bent hell bent for metal hell bent hell bent for metal
Hell bent hell bent for metal hell bent hell bent for metal
Whoa thank you and good night
