All at once it starts to rain acid burning in the earth
Leaving me to start again is it all that we are worth
Can we try to stop it is it worth the cause
Can we stop them killing us me my children you and yours
Laughing crying spinning dying no more children truth or lying
Selling buying no denying my god are we not civilised
There's a red light in the east turning to our western eyes
Aiming straight towards our heart about to kill our soul and mind
Can we try to stop it is it worth the cause
Can we stop them killing us me my children you and yours
Laughing crying spinning dying no more children truth or lying
Selling buying no denying are we not civilised
Can we try to stop it is it worth the cause
Can we stop them killing us me my children you and yours
Laughing crying spinning dying no more children truth or lying
Selling buying no denying now there's only death and dying
