Living running out on the streets at night searching hoping for the right connection
'Cause I need it want it you know I've got to have it takes me higher than anything I know
Angel dust need a shot to see me through the day
Angel dust want a lot I've got to get away
I live my life like there's no tomorrow take no chances I'm drowning all my sorrows
'cause I need it want it you know I've got to have it takes me higher than anything I know
Angel dust need a shot to see me through the day
Angel dust want a lot I've got to get away I've got to go
Laughing crying every night and day I know you know that I'm a different man
Because I need it want it you know I've got to have it takes me higher than anything I know
Angel dust need a shot to see me through the day
Angel dust want a lot I've got to get away come here bitch give me a thrill aah aah
