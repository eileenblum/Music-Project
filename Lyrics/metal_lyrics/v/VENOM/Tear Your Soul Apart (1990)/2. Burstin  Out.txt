Burstin' out come on I'm a son of a bitch ready to stitch you muther's not ready to rock
I've shed all my tears and ain't got no fears and they key to my heart bears no lock come on
Hell has granted me three wishes life death immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness fuck your blessed trinity
'Cause I'm burstin' I'm burstin' out well 'cause I'm burstin' I'm burstin' out
I'm a bastard and brave I'm nobody's slave I'm telling you once and for all
Breaking the laws 'cause I know the score waiting on nobodies call come on
Hell has granted me three wishes life death immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness fuck your blessed trinity
'cause I'm burstin' I'm burstin' out well 'cause I'm burstin' I'm burstin' out whoa
Let's burst right out of here whoa let's go burstin' fuckin' out
