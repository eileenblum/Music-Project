At night the corpses rise and leave a stench of rotten life
Eagerly the stagger forth to find a friend to gripe
Copulating in the grounds of their eternal home
Regurgitate ejaculations on their old tomb stones
Dead love there's love amongst the
Dead love there's love amongst the dead
Licking at their blackened limbs the zombie's pleasure cries
Lucifer's immortal glory watch them swapping eyes
Writhing in a mound of death maggots under the flesh
Digging fresh arrival thus to lovingly caress
Dead love there's love amongst the
Dead love there's love amongst the dead
Aw ooh waw ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haa
Go home you necromancers find true the words I've said
No place for mortal magic there's love amongst the dead
Aw yeah the walls around the cemetery built high forever strong
Church of fools demand this for the dead don't die for long
At the dawn of darkness the keeper takes his keys
Locking out the living for the dead don't wanna leave
Dead love there's love amongst the
Dead love there's love amongst the
Dead love dead love dead love dead love whoa
