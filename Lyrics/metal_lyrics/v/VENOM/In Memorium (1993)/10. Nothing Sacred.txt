Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Forgotten tales in history
Now myths and legends lie
Among the halls of knowledge free
For young and old alike
There's nothing sacred
No there's nothing sacred
Oh aw not the sacred secrets
The keys to hell awaits ye
If the cards ye deal
Suffice suffice suffice
Ignore the cries of angels
Now on that dotted line
There's nothing sacred
No there's nothing sacred
No aw not the sacred secret
The keys to hell awaits ye
If the cards ye deal
Suffice suffice suffice
Ignore the cries of angels
Now on that dotted line
There's nothing sacred
No there's nothing sacred
Oh aw not the sacred secrets
