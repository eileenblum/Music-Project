The warriors gather slowly around
The sacred city, Hell
Satan screams a vengeance
On the land as the angels fell
Tyrants pray disaster for the
Land of love and trust
Demons plot a way to turn
The Heavens into dust.

The standard bearers chosen
From the mass of Satan's dogs
To hold the flag of Hades high
Defying all the gods
Satan laughs the words of war
The Heavens shake with fear
Armageddon sings his song
The battle's ever near.

Let the joyous celebrations of Hell begin

Who holds the keys to the seven gates?

Lucifer's demonic laughter
Assist our quest, Belial prays
Free from Hell who serves the master
Sound the charge on Sabbaths day.

Charge!

Crest the demon's souls
Show yourselves in power
Angels fear resist
nothing holds the storm

Inform the grand master of Hades

Storm the gates!

Free from the pits of Hell
Slaves emerge the mountain
We shall destroy the accursed Heavens
Advance great legions strong
Crush the gates and enter free
Our lord of Hell must take God's throne
Heavenly inferno
Spread the message far...
