Do the monthsâ? They change
and do the yearsâ? They pass
it's felt like the same day
for the whole of my life.

I've had one of those dreams again
where all I can see is a grey horizon

no sun breaking the monotony 
a dream devoid of colour,
and devoid of sound
where I am only greeted by blank faces without souls
We are grinding the gears of the grey machine
grinding the gears of the grey machine
