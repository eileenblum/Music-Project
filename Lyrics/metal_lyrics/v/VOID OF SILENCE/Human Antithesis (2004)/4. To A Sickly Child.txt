You are a sickly child
Without the strength
To meet the weight of this world.

Where did we go wrong?
How did we go wrong?

What shall the solution be?

It is not for me to say how the sick shall meet their,
End yet they shall and they shall...

Let me take the air from your lungs that vapid poison
Let me be the finger on the trigger 

O sick, sick child. My sick, sick child.
Please listen to me. Please listen to me.

Sick, sick child
Whose ills no mother's love could ease
Let me be your sanctuary I am your refuge,
So look into my eyes, child, and realise...
You are looking down a barrel of a gun.

Sick, sick child
Whose ills no mother's love could ease
Let me be your sanctuary I am your refuge, 
So look into my eyes, child, and realise...
You are looking down a barrel of a gun.

Oh sickly child
Whose ills no mother's love could ease.
I am your sanctuary
I am your refuge
And look into my eyes my child and realise
What shall the solution be
