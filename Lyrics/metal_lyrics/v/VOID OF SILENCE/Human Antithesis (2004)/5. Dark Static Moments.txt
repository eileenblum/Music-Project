I feel like I've Been Going
Nowhere in my life for years.
All these empty promises, 
Empty threats.
It was such a dark static moment when we met.
Nothing felt right, maybe thats why 
I went so far, too far,
Beyond sorrow, beyond pain and beyond lust.

The empty silences in our forced conversation, 
Trying to be what I cannot be. 
I never felt so alone in my entire life. 
So alone and desperate to be somewhere else.

What in this world can change me?
What in this world can rouse me from my sleep?

My eyes may be open, but I see nothing. 
My mouth may be open but it is not words I am forming. 
Not in any language that you can understand.
I hear what you are saying, 
But it makes no sense to me, it never did. 

How did it come to this? 
When did I start, dead to the world? 

The word is black and white 
In my soundless dreams. 
There is nothing that I can do, nothing that I can do.
So carve me up one last time 
And leave me for the dogs.

I have no pity, I have no remorse
For these grey lines 
That carve me up and sell my soul. 
No remorse and no pity.

Oh, what is worth?
Is it worth your love
Or is it worth your compassion? 

Every time I dream, I seem to leave it all.
Standing at some deserted train station, 
I am waiting, I am waiting, I am watching 
With and old timetable in my hand.

I am willing another cold morning in another city. 
Or another sunset surrounded by strangers
I need somewhere to rest my head.
