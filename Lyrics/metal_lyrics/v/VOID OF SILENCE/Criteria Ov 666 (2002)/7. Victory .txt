the sun never sets where our flag flies high
victory is simple as it shines up in the sky

we'll hang 'em high as we hail new glory
so raise the flag once more
and remind us what we're fighting for
as our blood and loyalty reign

reign forever more
reign forever more

victory! for the ashes that we left behind
victory! for the sake of those who fought and died
victory! for our freedom 'til the end of time
victory! you'll soon hear our battle cry karnix

all hail new glory
all hail new glory

krieg!
krieg!
krieg!
krieg!

we'll always have our hearts and that they can't take
we'll always have our heads to know what's at stake
we'll always have our pride and not know disgrace
we'll stand against the world and never hid our face
