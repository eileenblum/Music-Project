an ecstasy of flumbling
fitting the helmets just in time
but someone still was yelling out and stumbling
and foundring like a man in fire or lime
through the misty panes and thick green light
as under a green sea, i saw him drowning
the creatures in the frost's breath
blasphemy in my eyes
the holy sin for the glory
all... in my dreams, before the helpless sight
i come, falling in the dark
the world and men are hurting me!
the world and men are hurting me!
in my dream before the helpless sight
the great hymn...
in my dreams, before the helpless sight
i come, falling in the dark
for all... follow me

our sword is truth, our shield is faith and honor
in age or youth, our hearts and minds we pledge
though we may day, to save our people and land
this cause will stand, our millions marching on
we close our ranks in loyalty and courage
the god our thanks for comrades tried and true
let traitors squail and fear the wrath of honest men
who rise again to smash the devil's throng
we march and fight to death or on to victory
our might is bright, no traitors shall prevail
our hearts are steeled against the fiery gates of hell
no shot or shell can still our mighty song
can still our mighty song
your honor in my heart
oh falling earth
covered with pestilence and death...
what passing bells for these who die as cattle
only the monstrous anger of the guns
only the stuttering rifle's rapid rattle
can patter out their hasty orisons
no mockeries now for them, no prayers nor bells
nor any voice of mourning save the choirs
the shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells
and bugles calling for them from sad shires
what candles may be held to speed them all?
not in the hands of boys but in their eyes
shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes
it is sweet and meet fitting to die for ones country.
