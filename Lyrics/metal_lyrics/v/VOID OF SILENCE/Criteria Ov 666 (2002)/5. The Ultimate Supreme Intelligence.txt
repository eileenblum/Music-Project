mind in fog, spinning about
walking alone, through a forest of doubt
searching for reason, proud and frail
running in circles but can't find the trail
emotions are blended, spinning inside
chaos with peace, humilty and pride
feelings suppressed, so hard to know
which feelings to hide, which feelings to show
troubles are false, troubles are real
torn apart, don't know what to feel

i am the shade
of dark and spiteful hatred made
i am the shade
of dark and spiteful hatred made!
to haunt and lurk among the shallows
of the ghosts, the graves and the longing shadows
i am the one
lost from the gloried and garish sun
my fate sealed with the blood of men
was i once he
who loved the sun, was darkness free?
fate was mine to weave and twine
insane and lost
was i once he
who loved the sun, was darkness free?
insane and lost
without body or soul but breath of frost
