anger it does many things
anger it helps decide your actions
anger it makes you not a human being
the calm before the raging storm began
all of hell's children looked downward
anger it's a kind of guide
anger it's when you let the person inside out
anger if you let it out, will you be changed?
anger, hate, pain, death, fear ...life!
