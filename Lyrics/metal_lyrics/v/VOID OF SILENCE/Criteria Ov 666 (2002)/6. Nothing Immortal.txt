godfather death
mister tyranny
each message you give
has a dance to it
a man say has twelve children
and damns the next
at the christening ceremony
god will not be the godfather
the devil will not be the godfather
wearing his streets like a whore
only death with its finger on our back
will come to the ceremony!
