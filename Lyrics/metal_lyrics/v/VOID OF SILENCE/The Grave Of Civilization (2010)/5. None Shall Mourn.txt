Centuries of blood bow your head and weep
What seeds have been sown in genocides heart
Soot and grime weigh down lives
Lived in fear under an empty sky
Boundless with out the lie of a god
Who put us on this earth to suffer
Never doubt that we are alone
The universe is cold and does not care
So live your life free and without guilt
There is no vengeful god for you to fear
If we are not enslaved to some figment of our minds
We gladly chain ourselves to some flag our great ideal
Such limitations bind constrict and crush the life away
We could have been so much instead
We chose to bow down and fail
Fade away where we belong
Nothing will change the world remains the same
Everything you dreamed
Would come instead a dream remains
And no more can we tolerate this structure
Forced upon us by anotherâs fate
We will pass into the dark
And none shall mourn this unmarked grave
In shallow earth our achievements rot
With none but the stars as witness
On mute epitaph if only you could sing
What songs would you weave
Of all that could have been
What tragedy and glory sacrifice and salvation
None of this will come to pass
Now our race bows low with shame
All our works will be as dust
