I am a victim of tragedy
And I am a victim of fate
And I live inside a few memories
Of someone who walks in the past

So now hear the things that I wanna say
And I see that you really care 
Don't wanna be somebody who keeps the faith
In something that's no longer there

I believed there would've been another chance
For us all to get kid of the storm
But you see I've got nothing in my hands
And I weep like never before

Time goes by and I'm still running
Running down an endless road
Getting further toward the future
Just to find my way home

I am a victim of agony
And I am a victim of pain
And I'll live forever in your fantasy
Cause we both, we just feel the same

Time goes by and I'm still running
Running down an endless road
Getting further toward the future
Just to find my way home
