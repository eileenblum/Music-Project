Out of control I let you go
And now I just regret - ohh my babe
I can't survive to realize
How long I'll hide the fact
Ohh, a time machine is bringing back to me
The days of wonder, bliss and joy
I feel so good, I can't avoid...
Ohh, I'm liking that, I'm diving deep inside
It's diving me crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, ohh... blowing away

Let me forever show you better who I am
I'll be your star, I'll be your guide, I'll be your man
Okk, babe... can't you feel me now?
I'll let you guess that I'll be under your control
And when you realize, I'll never let you go
Ohh darling... you belong to me!

I got along, I was so strong
Forever you'll be gone?
Ohh, my love
I write a tune, I watch the moon
And deep inside the light, I see your face
Ohh, a beam machine, a second it would take
To walk the sky alone with you
And all my dreams are coming true
We don't feel the ground, we're gliding through the night
It's driving me crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.  Ohh... blowing away!

Let me forever show you better who I am
I'll be your star, I'll be your guide, I'll be your man
Okk, babe... can't you feel me now?
I'll let you guess that I'll be under your control
And when you realize, I'll never let you go
Ohh darling... you belong to me!
Ohh what a dream!

I'll let you guess that I'll be under your control
And when you realize, I'll never let you go
Ohh darling... you belong to me!
Would you come and stay? Joining my dream...
Driving me crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.  Ohh... blowing away!
