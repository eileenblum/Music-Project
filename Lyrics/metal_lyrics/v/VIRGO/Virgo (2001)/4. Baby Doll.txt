It seems to me that you never had
A place to lay your soul
It seems to me when you raise your head
I see these eyes of stone
What can I do?

Could you tell what you really think?
Could you light this fire?
Do you need my helping hand?
Do you believe in desire?

You find a way to push me down
You bend my nerves, 
To be around with you

Cant' you see - I'm not your baby doll
Cant' you see - I'm not your baby doll

Homeward bound to anywhere
Nothing ever lasts
You take your place, cause you have nowhere
To go without a task
