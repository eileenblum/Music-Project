Look at the cards pretending
Fooling me in tarot
The story is never ending
I've got to pay my price on you
Knowing what I'll be missing by knowing 
That you'll be gone begging you 
On and on and on to think of what you've done

But once you forget what means falling in love
You'll know what means falling in pain
And once you forget that what happened to us 
Never could happen again

I've got a fiction, of what is gonna be
My own religion, of doing what I feel
I've got a million faces, I've got a million names
And I've got to realize how life can be  - haha

Hoping that I will get there
I have already been
Thinking 'bout times that we shared 
Looking for a new beginning
Knowing what I am missing
Or telling what I have told begging
You on and on and on
To think about not to go

Once you forget, falling in love means falling in pain
And once you forget that what happened to us 
Never could happen again

I've got a fiction, of what is gonna be
My own religion, of doing what I feel
I've got a million faces, I've got a million names
And I've got to realize how life can be
