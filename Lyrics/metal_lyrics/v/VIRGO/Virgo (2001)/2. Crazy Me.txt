Talk to me, let me hear the sound
Don't walk away, let me be around
Let me smell, what I used to like
On my knees - let me creep tonight

I wanna be the one
I wanna be someone
I'm begging for my sweet divine

Crazy me, cause I try to get
What I deserve, going vaguely mad
I count the hours, I count the days
To stop the pain and to start the chase

I wanna be the one, don't wanna be alone
I'm begging for my sweet ruin maybe

To let me know you're not denying 
Just blink an eye and I am dying for trying
Let's go on fighting through the days
Believing in our love and hate
I'm crying and sighing again

Watch ahead I can feel the sun
Looking back, there was something wrong
Am I blind - I don't see the signs 
Am I dumb - I don't hear the lies

You whisper softly in my ears
As marking bloody on my back - I was here!
I take the blame - you take control
All of my body and my soul
I'm fighting and dying
Crying and sighing again
