You waste your time to find an answer
You say your life's a bunch of scraps
Search for the reason that keeps you down
Sighing out, but there's no land here all around

No way to stand to see you suffer
You're digging traps you step right in
Hey, there's a way for anyone who's wanting
And there's a road for everyone to go

I want you to know
For all that you do
Well, It's not too late to rearrange
The pieces of your heart that made you go insane

So if your looking for solutions 
And you're still waiting for the day
That brings you sunrise and lights
The shade from all the pain and misery,
That's why I say...

I want you to know
For all that you do
Well, It's not too late to rearrange
The pieces of your heart that made you go insane

There are times of joy and times of pain
And we feel we waste our lives just standing up again...

And if your looking for a reason 
You'll never find, you better try
To move along the road you're leaving 
Never to fear, love is a lie

And if you're living for an answer
Don't waste your time
Longing to feel
Like any other day you suffered
Back in the days
Life wasn't real
