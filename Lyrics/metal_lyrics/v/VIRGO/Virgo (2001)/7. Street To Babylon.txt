Since I saw your face again, I wasn't sure
In your urgent silence, looking good
With those claws of feather gently round my neck
And the strangest taste of never coming back...

So, I realized the scene in black and white 
Even if I told you I'm never right!
And you kept pretending well
Now it's time to choose for paradise or hell
And wipe off the bad dreams of my mind
All the bad dreams of my mind
To realize I dare
My feelings now to share, everywhere...

But again you came so fast to take control
Lake a spider dancing fooling on the wall
May you just be crazy, may you just be right
But for now remember... hell or paradise
And wipe off the bad dreams of my mind
All the bad dreams on my mind
To realize I dare
My feelings now to share, everywhere...

Always in my dreams, I felt you close to me
Laughing in my face, killing my fantasy
How long could I stand, how long it's meant to be?
But now it's mine... now the whole world is mine!

And I could remind you forever what you've been
Till your bones dissolve, you'd think of me
So you'd keep pretending long, forevermore as the spider dance.
Fooling on the wall...

And wipe off the bad dreams of my mind
All the bad dreams on my mind
To realize I dare
My feelings now to share, everywhere...
