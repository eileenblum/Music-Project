I never thought i'd rest my life
Like dreams don't dare to pretend
But a single day can change
All the future that you've planned
To go and see what's there for me
To be... or not to be?

You're laying here lonely
And I wish you speak
But the wires tell your stories
Cause your body is too weak
I take your hand and there's nothing
Is there someone inside?
And if there is, 
is it still you in this body that's dying

There is a soul that keeps hearing 
What's you're going to say 
There is a soul that keeps feeling
It's someone who is longing to stay

I'm not sure but I hope that 
I can help you if I could
Is it right that I'm thinking?
And is it wrong if I do?
How will I know the answer?
How can I stand the pain?
Hoe will I know the reason?
Why you're going away?

There is a way and I'm walking
There's a light in the dark
There's my hope that is leading
Me back to my life if I fight if I fight

Time goes by but standing still
All my life is passing by tears run dry
Words are gone
How can I keep going on - all alone?
There is a soul that keeps hearing
What you're going to say
There is a soul that keeps feeling
It's someone who is longing to stay
