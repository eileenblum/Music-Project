Leave me, if  I still cry
There's no need to have an answer
To raise and fly
Far beyond the seven oceans a sun may shine

Leave me in the arms of pain, away...

Hold me, I've gone too high
And the clouds I left below me
Now seem to hide
All the bird I kept inside me, falling apart...

Hold me in your arms again
Take your time to understand
Get out to the light of day
Spread your wings, no matter when

Just you and me
Together relieve
To ever believe
In you and me

Look back, the land so far...
From above it's like a puzzle
All filled with scars
Far beyond the seven oceans
I've found a star

Clouds I left below one day
Now are the ones who light the way...

Just you and me
Together relieve
To ever believe
In you and me

Just you and me
To stay hand in hand
And go until the end 
Of you and me

"Everyday we learn something
Everynight we dream another's dream
Every places recalls something
Everyone we meet we'll meet again"
