Violent blows wakes me up instantly traumatized
I cannot see, can't move anymore
There's too much blood, too much gore
I'm just one of many victims of this ritual

Identical killings, identical hate
Collector of trophies, born to eviscerate

I catch a glimpse of the man who is taking my life
He is possessed and he's casting spells on my soul
Knives enter my flesh from every direction
A pack of clones are pointing at me as I bleed

Ultimate purification, soaked in holy fluid, flames engulf my body, final words are spoken
Ultimate purification, soaked in holy fluid, flames engulf my body, final words are spoken
Ritual completed

Global and horrid the pursuit continues
Enabled by bastards greedy for power

Dissidence is ravished, obliterated and banished
Final outcome is neverending war
Unorthodox Spawn Deleted
