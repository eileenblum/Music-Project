Old man, his weakened body nearly expiredSkin deteriorating, cells mutating he can feelhis own mind slipMemories of a glorious past haunt him Poisoned by his fear of dyingThe old man trips Young girls tied to tables the old man prepares to harvestThe lifegiving elixir flowing through their veinsScreams echo through the nightas he begins his gruesome task To slit the throats of his victimsTo collect their rejuvenating crimson fluid Their bodies are hung upsidedown from meathooksThe screams fade as their bodies twitchBlood starts to flow Submerged into a tubEmbraced by the red liquidThe old man shiversHis blood cure complete Decapitated corpses of the young dangling from the ceilingSacrificed for his old fleshOnce among the living, now empty vesselsTheir spirits will forever lingerEarthbound, condemned Old man his body's still weak, fresh elixiranother bloodcureHis new sacrificial lambs stripped and ready for slaughter
