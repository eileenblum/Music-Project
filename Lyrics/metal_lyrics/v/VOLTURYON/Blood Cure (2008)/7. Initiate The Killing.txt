Reprisal
Retaliation
Relics send shivers down my spine
Computing how to slay cause now it's time to execute

Rationality neglected, from behind I'm unsuspected
Desultory stabs
Desolation is perfected .... behold

Initiate the Killing
Initiate the Killing

Absence of humanity means shedding of blood
You say you regret every malevolent act, liar

Time for you to pay
The violence will dominate everything, staggering disgust
Fractions of what lies ahead, demonical lust
Horror is my main element

I will not consider your pleads
It's time to pay for covetous deeds
Vengeance is compulsive
Profound rage manifests

Initiate the Killing
Initiate the Killing

Driven by the thrill of another kill
Demonstration of retaliation begins

Reprisal
Retaliation
Relics send shivers down my spine
