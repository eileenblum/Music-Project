Stalking my victim, carefully pickedRight size, right looks, soon no more My intentions, for you beyond beliefIntentions for me to be rebornTo kill and fulfill complete rebirthDestined to die for me to liveTo kill and fulfill my invertbirthDestined to die for me to live Zero hour, sleeping beautyChosen surrogate, soon to deliver Inserting rods, puncturing lungsDon't want you to scream...Don't take this the wrong way dear, you are a partOf a greater planSurgical instruments flashing, cutting, tearingOpen up for me and you shall recieve Invert BirthInvert Birth You can call me fanaticYou can call me wickedI call myself a man of pure faithA soon to be born again christianA soon to be born again christian My intentions, for you beyond beliefIntentions for me, to be rebornTo kill and fulfill complete rebirthDestined to die for me to liveTo kill and fulfill my invertbirthDestined to die for me to live Your flesh shall be my templeA means to my salvationCrawling up inside the wombAn actual rebirth performed
