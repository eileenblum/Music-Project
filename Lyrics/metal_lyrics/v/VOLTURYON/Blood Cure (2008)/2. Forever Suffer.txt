Agony has consumed the last of meNo way out but to stare into the end of a barrelAs I squeeze the trigger millions of voices are calling meI accept their invitation to the kingdom of death As my body dies .... I slowly slip awayMy life's final dusk .... turns into nightAs my departure is imminentAs my departure is imminent Feelings of relief turn into horror when I realize the truthThe voices of those before me cry out their pain, a million agonizing screamsIn this neverland of death, we shall forever sufferImprisoned, never to escape I feel myself beeing pulled into a bottomless pitWhile a wretched apparition tears at meAs we are coalesced into one my journey beginsA predator of death, harvesting the souls of the damned Destined to wander this wasteland of deathAs a scavenger of the deadFeeding on those who have diedOur pain is eternal, our epithet is agony Forever SufferWandering in eternityForever SufferDead but awake
