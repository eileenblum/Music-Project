"Believe in me, for I am the one who gives salvationBow to me, give me your faith and you shall recieve" Down! on your knees dutifully kissing holy assLured! by a phantasm rotting your minds The omnipotency once bestowed upon himIs now tearing you apartLike a puppet on a string you're slaves to, a master Believing is seeing, blind devotion has takenaway your reasonAs holy bitches of the father and the sonYou've succumbed to a fantasy Bastardized by oppressive filthYou spread his divine disease"Live by the holy words of godIf you resist I'll shove them up your ass" PhantasmIn the phantasm we trustPhantasmPraise the Phantasm Someday your bubbles will burstAnd your wine will turn to waterWitness the true miracles of religionOppression and meaningless slaughter Fear himFor heÂ´s the one who makes you suffer
