Puncture wounds cover my battered bodySelf-inflicted damage done to cleanse my soulA stigmatic experience stemming from masochistic urgesto see myself decay Crimson red, the essence of life leaves my bodyNaked blood flows freely Spikes poke through skin, pierce my flesh, make my body tremblePain and pleasure intertwine in orgasmic convulsions Severe psychosisA need to ingest my own amputed parts emergesMy crotch is bleeding profusely as cuts are inflicted Genitalia removed to be consumedAgony and euphoria blend togetheras the lump slides down my throatSnacking on my own bloody chunksSevered dick fellatio Cannibalistic selfmutilationTo purify myselfMy pain is my salvationMy salvation is my painMy pain is my salvationMy salvation is my pain Serenity in devouring my own .... flesh! Gouging out my eyes! ripping through veinsMy life is soon depletedSearing, screaming, body burning, dying Crimson red, the essence of life leaves my bodyNaked blood flows freely Spikes poke through skin, pierce my fleshMake my body tremblePain and pleasure intertwine in orgasmic convulsions
