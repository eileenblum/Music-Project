Staring at an empty bed wishing it to stay the same 
There must be a way to get me out of this 
Everyone will get what they deserve I will remove their grins 
The stupid fuckers will be killed 

They must die tonight in my blood soaked solution 

I catch them in their sleep and I hold 'em down, slowly suffocating each and everyone
This time they won't slip away, through the pillow I hear their screams 
Putting up a futile fight 
Leeches, parasites, choked and pounded one by one 
All their kicks and screams make me feel more brutal and supreme 

They must die tonight in my blood soaked solution 

Once a lover now a plague and soon a victim of her deceit 
These are her last minutes alive, I cut her slowly but I won't let her die 

Years and years of humiliation now end in retaliation 
Suppressed violence manifested in a psychopathic impulse of brutality 

Helpless, pestiferous bitch, bleeding 
I'll make her suffer until the end 
I cut her deeper in excess 
A gruesome act in this process of obliteration 

Hours of corporal abuse initiated 
She brought this on herself 
Suffer you fucking burden 
Protracted punishment, I nail her to the floor 
Disgust, repulsion, this is what she means to me 

[Solo â Johan]

Helpless, pestiferous bitch, bleeding 
I'll make her suffer until the end 
I cut her deeper, in excess, tearing out her vital organs 
Blood soaked solution, followed through 
I made her suffer until the end 
Blood soaked solution, I crushed her skull 
A gruesome act in this process of obliteration
