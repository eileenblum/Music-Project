A quest for domination 
Surrendered to the greatest purity 
Sovereign oppression 
Committed to enslavement 

Clinging to their scriptures, fanatic devotion, a feeble heap 
Excess of adherents guided by an illusory origin 

Murder is forgiven 
Evident abhorrence 
Purified by phantoms now 
Morally reborn 

You shall all abide under eminence deliver your souls 
Surrender to a higher power 
Renounce, relinquish your sanity 
You shall all abide under eminence surrender to a higher power 

A prestigious hunt for slaves and preachers, lured by promises 
Indoctrinated, this mental confinement will corrupt their minds 

Imbued masses under a spell are carrying out their orders 
Weakened by an exorbitant reverence and blind devotion 

[Solo â Andreas]

You shall all abideâ¦ yield! 

Foolish adoration has ravaged our existence 
Messengers of intolerance has incited an army of servants 

Millions of lives are left in ruins forever condemned 
Abysmal misery, fear and anguish, an inevitable end
