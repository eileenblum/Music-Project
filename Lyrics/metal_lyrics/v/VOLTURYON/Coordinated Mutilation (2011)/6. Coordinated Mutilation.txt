Enhancing injections, intoxication has begun 
An experiment set in motion 
Growing abstinence, craving the touch of flesh 
Rabid and tremulous, another hunt is on 

A lust to brutalize, coordinated mutilation 
Cognatic strategies, coordinated mutilation 

Staggering intemperance 
No way out from this addiction 
Rationality neglected 

A game of killing, reality mixed with fiction 
Participation means deprivation 
Beckoned by the instinct of supremacy 
Unrelenting violence is imminent 

Summoning the vile, ready to perform without remorse 
Waiting for a sign, where to aim, how to stab, when to execute 

Everyone has come, ferocity intensifies, time to advance 
Vertical slash from behind with a knife in order to proceed 
Satisfied grins, another successful hunt, perfection achieved 
Blood soaked, crimson red sepulchral fields, cadavers fills the streets 

Meticulous ways of slaughter, coordinated mutilation 
Deranged psychopaths, coordinated mutilation 

Staggering intemperance 
No way out from this addiction 
Rationality neglected 

[Solo â Andreas]

Gruesomeness beyond belief 
Coordinated mutilation
