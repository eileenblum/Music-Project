Bondage, display of dominance 
Tied down to suffer blunt trauma 
Ravaged, this young body abused 
Innocence is lost forever 
Broken, overwhelmed by fear 
So young and pure the perfect prey 

Pools of genital blood serves as monument of acts of molestation and disgrace 
Ropes tearing the lines of tension, filthy hands cover her face 

Overpowered, deflowered, robbed of sanctity 
Strapped to a pole, hooded and stoned down to the bone 
Her flesh exposed, state of disgrace 

Primal brutalism, total barbarism, obsolete ways of torture 
Cannibals, rapists, all join together in primordial orgies 

Bondage, display of dominance 
Hunted down to suffer blunt trauma 
Ravaged, this young body abused 
Destined for bloodshed never to be healed 

Screaming, begging, praying to be killed only to be slowly to be tortured 
Reeking mass of vermilion sludge, carnivores are gathering 

Endless bloodshed 
Ravaged, again and again, dying 

Taking turns, ripping up new orifices in this barely living pile of bones 
Snacking on what is left, inhuman circle of life 

Endless bloodshedâ¦ 

Primal brutalism, total barbarism carnivores are snacking on what is left 
Violent mastication's stretching orifices carnivores are snacking on what is left
