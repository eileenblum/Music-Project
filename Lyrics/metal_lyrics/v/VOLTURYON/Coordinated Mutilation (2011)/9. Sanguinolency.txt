Obsessive, rabid, frantic, no peace of mind 
Night after night he dreams of gore and sadistic deeds 
Spawned by fantasies starring himself 

Warped mind, intoxicated, determined to find the location 
Desperate need of total gratification, flashbacks of a vulgar scenario 
Fuels the gruesome plot 

Sanguinolency 
Sanguinolency 

Inflowing pictures, eyes are shut 
He replicates every single move 
Bodies lay contorted dead on the ground 

Pierced throats, heads chopped off 
Cutting flesh sonority 

Sanguinolency 
Sanguinolency 
Sanguinolency 

Never before seen violence 
Warped mind, intoxicated 
Entering the state of psychosis 

[Solo â Johan]

He's counting the deaths 
Body parts spread around 
The work is done 

Sanguinolent perversions 
Impulse is to hunt down the innocent 
Shredded, severed flesh 
Never before seen violence 

Dreams will come back, compulsory acts continue 
When he misses the smell of blood and the touch of flesh
