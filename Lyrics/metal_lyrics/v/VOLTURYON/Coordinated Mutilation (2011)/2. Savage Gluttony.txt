A filthy mind, forbidden fetish a constant urge 
First swallowed in shame, kept inside for many years 
To prey on the helpless, an addiction 
Fully infected with this perversion 
Now a full blown obsession 

Through a lens, flaunted bodies 
Scenario of your choice 
Bold, impudent, innocent 

Savage gluttony of flesh 
Twitching resistance as life ends 

His eyes are set on the weak an easy catch 
Sedated, taken away 
Thrown in the basement with the rest 
Piles of young bodies to molest 
Some of them dead, some alive 
Warm or cold they shall all be defiled 

Pounded bodies, reconstructed for sexual purposes 
Invaginated flesh to fit his needs 

[Solo â Johan]

Blurred vision, blood on his face, callused hands trembling, craving, covered in sludge
Sloppy incisions, he grabs for innards, stuffing his mouth full of that juicy flesh
Savage perversions, cavities are carved to be penetrated 
Poisoned by his fear of dying 

Pounded bodies beyond recognition, a bloody pulp 
Softened flesh suits the old man 

Deteriorated genitalia is buried in their skin, he feels so alive 
Savage perversions, cavities are carved to be penetrated 
Poisoned by his fear of dying 

Savage gluttony of 
Savage gluttony of â¦ flesh! 

Savage gluttony of flesh 
Twitching resistance as life ends 
Savage gluttony of flesh 
Twitching resistance as life ends 
As life ends
