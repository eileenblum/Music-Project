My object of suffering in sight 
I climb through his window at night 
I push the needle through his skin 
Injecting the substance made to kill 

Polluted veins, decomposing 
Deteriorating slowly 

Organ collapse 
Lethal toxins refined, intestinal distress 
Choking on froth 
Tremor, intense convulsions 

Excruciating seizures 
A lifelong malice ending in blood 
I aim for the torso apertures 
The virulent fluids injected to the flesh 

Exorbitant vengeful reprisal 
The final syringe is inserted 
Augmented boils bursting 
Malodorous fetid secretion 

Polluted veins, bursting vessels 
Spewing his innards violently 

A sinister vengeance completed 
Layers of tissue depleted through festering 
Disgusting deeds of aversion 
I wallow in the satisfaction 

Organ collapse 
Lethal toxins refined, intestinal distress 
Tremor, intense convulsions
