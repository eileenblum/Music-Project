Built up rage will take its toll 
Messed up youngs, misanthropic ways 
Soon the day will come for their revenge 

Execution is set to take place 
When everyone has come so that no one gets away 
Exits are blocked as the plan comes alive 

Performed by the disturbed 
Euphoria through execution 
Inner demons released 
Euphoria through execution 

Dominance and respect is finally achieved 
Euphoria through hatred is what they feel 
Now the time has come for their revenge 

Running down the halls in a drunken rage 
Screaming out what's been kept inside 
Killing at will, watching them bleed, silencing the pleads 

Performed by the disturbed...
