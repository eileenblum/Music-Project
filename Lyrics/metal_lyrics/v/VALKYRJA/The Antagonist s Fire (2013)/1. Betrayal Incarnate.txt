Strangle the king
and the slaves will vanish,
stabbing wildly
until man is no more.
Strangle the king
Wield the blade until no breath is heard.
Crushing the duality of life,
trampling all creation's spawn.
In every aspect eradication throned,
each corner cleansed with fire.
In the midst of tombs and branches dead,
beneath the weeping heavenâs cries,
turning to behold what birth denied
and piss in the ashes of aeons man roamed.
...of aeons man roamed.
Strangle the king
and his herd will starve,
let them find their end
on impotent ground.
Strangle the king
and his herd will starve.
Their bones adorn our victory.
...our victory.
May my words be famine, suffering and fright.
May curses follow steps I take.
In the heart of all I craft,
the pulse is born so far beyond their pallid dream.
Twisting the bones in impossible ways,
leaving scars beneath the scars...
Strangle the king
and his kingdom âll fall,
turn to nothing
their shelters built of sand.
Strangle the king
and his kingdom âll fall.
All their efforts do succumb to naught.
Let me be the flame that swallows worlds,
as their bane I stand.
May my works be plagues, woes and blight.
Born opposer of all you hold so dear.
May curses follow each step that I may take.
