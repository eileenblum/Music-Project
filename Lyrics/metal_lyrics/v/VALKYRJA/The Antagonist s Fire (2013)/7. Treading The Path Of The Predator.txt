Ascending on vermin wings,
crowned in locust halo.
Blending blood with venom,
devoted beyond belief.
Come, meet his gaze,
commanding thy self to rise
as a phoenix from the ashes
of a rotting host.
Commanding the final voyage
of the sinking ship.
I can clearly sense His presence,
a stench so rank and moist...
Come, relinquishment -
This soul is of you!
This blood is of you!
Come, most foul of gangrene -
our bones have flesh in mere wait.
Wicked, primeval darkness,
see my blood boil as
a thousand cauldrons â
Treading the path
of the predator.
Can no longer grind these teeth
as they yearn to bite.
No longer can a sharpened claw
stay out of battle.
This fever makes me nauseas,
must make use of this tool.
Perversion, aversion,
fire kin, the seed of sin!
The wine of Sodom flows tonight.
Death breeder, tomb feeder,
cursed not with veil of sight.
this mouth is of You!
This praise is Yours.
I smell your
sickness in my flesh...
Feed of my lunacy, my lust
and untainted awe;
for of Him I am not,
He who lights the stars
and washes the world with warmth,
but of grave I am - the many worms
within the lifeless flesh.
Treading the path
of the predator.
The blades are growing restless,
their thirst Iâm born to quench.
His presence is so clear,
such an overwhelming stench...
Where there is flesh
thy breeze will sweep,
leaving empty vessels.
My Messiah is He
who crushes the head of man.
For of Him Iâm not,
whose name is prosperity.
He, who is of growth
and turn the night to day â
I am of villain breed!
Come, relinquishment -
This soul is of You!
This blood is for You!
Come, most wretched famine -
such is what they deserve;
the puny, damaged flock
whose collective name is Human.
Treading the path
of the predator.
From the highest peak to the End!
from the deepest chasm to the End!
Command the final voyage
of their sinking ship.
From the highest peak to the End,
from the deepest chasm to the End.
Hail the peerless â hail the End!
Hail the nightside â hail the End!
