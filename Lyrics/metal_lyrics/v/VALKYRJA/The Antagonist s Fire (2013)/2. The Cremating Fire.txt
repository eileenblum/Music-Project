Tonight no voice will sound,
each tongue struck by fear.
Every sense entwined in panic.
Carving endings into flesh.
Knowledge of the striking blade...
Knowledge of the storm to come...
In a cloud of smoke the final chapter is written
with blood on the last page of a mistake.
Civilizations fall like branches
towards an everburning soil,
kissed by flames of judgment.
Tonight new wounds are born
in the planet's body.
Now that your body has rejected
the light of lifeâs weak sun,
the whips of punishment
shall carve an ending into flesh.
Where could they possibly hide
when the earth itself implodes?
Each direction its own pyre,
we feed the towering flames.
...feed the fire.
Into the void we sink
in a blaze of destruction
as their civilizations fall like branches.
Nothing left to do
but look the Beast in the eye...
