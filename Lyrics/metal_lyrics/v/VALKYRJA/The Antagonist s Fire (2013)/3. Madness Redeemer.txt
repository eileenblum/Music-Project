Rippling the tranquil waters of the order,
a single drop of blood to disturb their sleep.
Render your praise to all of disorder,
may eternity channel the deathlike trumpet's tune.
Heralds of madness and misfortune sweeping forth,
embedded deep within the essence of man.
With delight eating dawn and dusk alike
and twisting every throat with eager.
Madness redeemer,
sovereign of all that shall shake our very core.
Madness redeemer,
quintessence of the pulse that brought this mind to action.
Supreme beneath the waters that still dwell in peace -
Madness redeemer!
The past is mere a glimpse of disasters to come,
swept in Harmageddon with sword held up high.
Opening the eyelids to behold a prey in waiting,
to gaze upon a fire, so weakened and about to fade out.
Precise in the mind, abominate tempter,
ascension of a star not spawned by the heavens.
Essence of the shadowside, born as boundless might.
Great Messiah, hidden deep beyond each corner that is known,
cast aside by all creation and risen through the sin of man.
Sovereign of all that shall shake our very core.
Madness redeemer,
quintessence of the pulse that guides these hands to action.
Supreme beneath the waters that still dwell in peace -
Madness redeemer!
Madness redeemer â my soul is with you...
