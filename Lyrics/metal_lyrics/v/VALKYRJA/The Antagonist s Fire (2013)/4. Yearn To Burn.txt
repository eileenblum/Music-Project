Swept in madness, born through the dark.
Lodestar draped in many-armed damnation.
Eternal, lifeless, determined and profane,
coil of loss, the broken link in the chain of life.
Let the rivers cross and let them wildly flow.
Tearing the barrier of hope.
Breaking the barrier of life.
Sterile and black without sign of guilt,
quenching the thirst of the nightside spawn.
Rotten curse of life,
whose light is but a piss
in the measureless ocean
of Deathâs firm grip.
See the rivers rush through the orifices of the world.
Embraced by the liquid, drown thy self.
A sacrifice without a gain -
to burn ... for the fire ... alone!
Razor key, show thyself! Nightside, my tempting whore,
expose for us, but feeble men, the truths thou bear within!
Let the rivers cross and let them wildly flow.
Carrying the seed of the sharpest blade.
Tempter and perfection, highest of the high.
See the rivers rush through the orifices of the world,
Yearning the liquid, to drown the self.
A sacrifice without a gain -
I burn... for the fire... alone!
