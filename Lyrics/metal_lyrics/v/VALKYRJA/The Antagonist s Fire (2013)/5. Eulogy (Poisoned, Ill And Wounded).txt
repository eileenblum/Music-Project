Woe -
my bride, whose side I'll never leave.
I gladly kiss her feet in adoration.
From her livid lips cries a deceitful hiss.
No love as gruesome, nor shame in our kiss.
...in our kiss.
The sliding edge against our throats
whose glare we'll never see.
Her labor is the terror
no man shall ever flee.
Poisoned, ill and wounded,
to her curse I'm drawn.
All I was - now gone.
Wounded, ill and injured,
through the dark fulfilled,
all I was - now killed.
Are there memories still flaring
within begotten nooks
of values worth upholding,
by human hand composed?
Come see their pillars falling,
and odious are the hooks
that render life with wounds unclosed.
Behold the deathlike triumph
as pain transposed.
Behold the deathlike triumph
unopposed!
Shivering in fever and fear.
The ghost of life no longer here...
Filling hearts with radiance
whose glare ignite the world
and through the empty veins
the fire glory once more swirled.
From soul to flesh it whirled!
Her will is all Iâll ever be,
forever I'm drifting upon her storming sea.
Turning heaven's pride to dust
by a single strike.
Every beacon burned
and through each heart a hammered spike.
Ride across the fruitless skies
upon the steed of dearth.
Turn to grave both sight and dream,
as locusts pillage earth.
Poisoned, ill and wounded,
by the black enthralled.
through my mouth - our dirge.
Poisoned, ill and injured,
her every deed appalled,
yet with the night Iâll merge.
Yearning lips of sweetest death,
a sharpened arrow to her bow.
Foulness in the purest shape,
highest peak and cruelest foe.
My gift to you is woe...
