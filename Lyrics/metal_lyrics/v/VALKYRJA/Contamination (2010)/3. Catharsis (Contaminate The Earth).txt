On The Day With No Dusk In Womb, The Seas Shall Turn To Dust.
Each Blooming Kingdom To A Lifeless Field.
As Dog Eats Dog And Man Eats Man.
Let The Tongues In Mouths Go Rot And The Sight In Every Eye Go Blind.
Hold On To Nothing - For It Is All There Is.
The Skies Are Shining Crimson.
Nothing But Silence Across These Fields Of Ash.
Embrace The Memories Of All That Used To Be Before The Sentence Was Laid Upon Your Head As A Doom To Come.
Let Vultures Pick Your Loved Ones Clean.
Let Each Chalice Of Redemption Stand Dry. With Head Raised High - Behold The Burning Dawn.
The Stillborn Structures Of All That Used To Be - Whats Your Action Against The Fearful Scythe?
I Feast Upon Your Rancid Flesh. I Taint Your Grail.
The Blood That Falls From Crimson Skies Is Mine To Drown Your Name.
Let Vultures Pick Your Loved Ones Clean.
Let Each Chalice Of Redemption Stand Dry.
Mother Against Spawn. Redemption Into Punishment. Brother Against Brother. Father Against Son. Contaminate The EARTH!
Let Each Ear Neglect A Prayer. Blessing Given As Wound. Each Well Shall Hold Rot And Venom, Each Fruit Vomit, Each Action To Harm.
On The Day With No Dusk In Womb The Seas Shall Turn To Dust As Dog Eats Dog And Man Eat... And Structures Fall Apart.
Let Vultures Pick Your Loved Ones Clean.
Let Each Chalice Of Redemption Stand Dry. Stand Ablaze - For It Is All There Is.
Mother Against Spawn, Redemption To Punishment, Brother Against Brother, Father Against Spawn.
Contaminate The EARTH!
Feel The Panic Through Your Spine As The Heart And Razor Meet As A Giant Against A Man. It Drips With Hatred And Carves With Joy As It Opens Up The Heart To Reach Its Chamber And Plant Its Seed... And Spread It Out Throughout The Veins.
