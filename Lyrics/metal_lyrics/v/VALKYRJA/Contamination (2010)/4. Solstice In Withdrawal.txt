From The Dried Cunt Of Life Came Not Child But Coughs Of Dust
The Stench Of Rot Still Linger Within The Winds...
Empty Eyes Are Staring Into Lifeless Nothing. Open Wide - Now A Nest For Flies
From The Scorned Cunt Of Light Not Even One Ray Remain To Light The Dark Who Swallowed Us...
Each Casket Fed, Not One Single Word Was Spoken
No Echo Travel To Share Its Message... Manifested And Awoken By The Pleasures Of Sin Whose Acts Were Denied By Sense - But Awoken By Will. Now Neglect Everything And Walk Into The Fire To Burn The Crust That Seal Thee With Remorse!
The Dried Tongues Wish So Pitiful To Speak.
None Of The Words Are Heard Throughout The Blistered Throat. From The Dried Cunt Of Life - No Prosper But Sighs Of Angst. Fluids From Open Wounds Still Stain Its Surface. Men Torn Into Bits, Staring Into The Lifeless Nothing - Wide Open.

Now Left To Rot In Silence... Pestilence With Different Faces Have Swept The Ground Countless Times Before - Each One With The Spirit Of A Wolf. Now Neglect Everything And Walk Into The Fire To Burn The Crust That Seal Thee With Remorse. The Dried Tongues Wish Pitiful To Speak, Yet None Of The Words Are Heard - No, None Of The Words Are Heard... Each Origin Reversed!
