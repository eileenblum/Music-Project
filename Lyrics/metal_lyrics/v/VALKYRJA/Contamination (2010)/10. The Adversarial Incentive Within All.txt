Incantations Of Past Horrors Again Brought To Life, Whose Eyes
Are The Might Of Death, To Reap And Reap Again. May It Be In

Is A Gruesome Abomination. Piercing The Quiet, As Every Night
Before, With Alluring Voices. Landscapes Left To Rot Behind Its
Turned Back. The True Face And Its Purpose Shown - Open Up
The Burning Eyes To Aim Once More. Behold Your Face In The
Mirror And For The First Time See The Flaws That Lies Within
You - Fears And Remorse. Is It A Shadow Behind You Who Put
All Thought Aside ? Is A Voice Now Calling Louder Than Before?

For All The Answers To Your Questions Is Death. For You
Are Like The World - Turning In A Restless Pace, Awaiting 
A Storm To Great To Outlive. Each Birth Bears To Fate.
Each Seed Hold The Will To Rot. This Does Adapt To You As
Well - Your Blood Is Not Running Pure. Have In Mind, You 
Walk In Denial - You Are Always Being Watched...
