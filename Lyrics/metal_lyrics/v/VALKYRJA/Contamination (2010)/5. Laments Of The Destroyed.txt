Many Years Have Passed Since Forbidden Wine Soaked This Heart And Mind With Darkness Lustful Sights. Born Not To Praise Creations Dawn But Curse Its Birth, Whose Hands Shaped This Flesh For Reasons Unknown.
The Massive Urge To Conquer Liberation Casted Flames Upon The Throne Where Each New Life Is Formed. Open My Eyes To Allow Me The Sight Beyond Life - To Cast Clear Light Upon The Shadows Secrets In The Dark. I Desire Nothing But To Feel My Wild Blood Run Vibrant, Now With A Force None Of This World. Every Task Clear, Each Purpose An Unlocked Gate. For The Signs Are All So Clear - What Dwells Beneath I Cannot Deny. Allow Me Now The Sight Beyond Life - To Shed Clear Light Upon The Secrets In The Dark.
Turn My Hungers Into Ways Where Upon My Strife Can Prosper. Never Ask Of Me To Change Direction For It Holds The Will To Power! Seas Turn Red From Open Scars - By Compassions Whore Denied. Every Thought Of Aid Put Aside. Vermin Cunts - My Heart Is Loud And Clear. Loud And Clear! As The Smoke Of War Will Clear And My Bodys Found With Eyes Still Open The War Against Myself Is Finally Won... Many Years Have Passed Since Forbidden Wine Soaked This Heart And Mind With Darkness Lustful Sights. Born Not To Praise Creations Dawn But Curse Its Birth, Whose Hands Shaped This Flesh For Reasons Unknown. The Massive Urge To Conquer Liberation Casted Flames Upon The Throne Where Each New Life Is Formed.
