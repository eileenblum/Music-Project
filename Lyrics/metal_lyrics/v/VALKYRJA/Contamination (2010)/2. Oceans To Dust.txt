Signs Of Extirpation, By Free Will, Chosen To Deny Is More Alive Now Than Ever.
Each Repulsibe Shiver Down The Spine Claws More Furious Than Ever!
This Mouth Is Its Choir, Flesh Its Vessel.
All Urges By Free Will Chosen To Deny Is More Malicious Now Than Ever.
For So Long Ive Been Dead To This World And All Of Its Vermin. Reaching Out With Open Hands To Reach A Throat - And Seal A Fate.
I Bide Into The Pulsating Waves Of Remedy Which Carry The Aid As Visions Of The Beyond.

To Gain Its Sights And Gain Its Keys Is The Venom, In My Veins.
A Razor-Sharp Power That Cut New Rivers.
A Perfect Passion Which Bring Desire To Burn.
A Trancelike Void Which Leave The Mind Ablaze.
This Mouth Is Its Choir, Flesh Its Vessel.
Forbidden Verses Echo - Always With Such Temptation.
Empires To Sand. Oceans To Dust.
The Gallows For Ye All, Perverted Filth And Scum!
I Was Solely Born To Be A Traitor To Every Breathing Life Form.
