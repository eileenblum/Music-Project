Isolation, black eyeless walls, claustrophobic panic
Walk with me through the autumn roads, through the fog and desolation

Quench your aching heart, thirsting for unavailable aid

Opening forbidden locks, descending right into the blooming garden of death
Shadows taking form of anguish, the face of hate unchained

An architechture of superior rage, burning in almost godlike flames
Behold as death entagles all as a knife in the neck of creation itself

The emptiness, the burning lust for destruction scorching within the flesh
A hunger not yet satisfied, majestic gallows for the future... majestic gallows for the future

Majestic gallows for the future

Tendons between the teeth soon grinded into pieces, the gushing blood is deafening
Dismember locks from every door, sealed shut by every instinct
A carnal joy of uncreation, an urge beyond resistance

The pound of bones smashed to dust, blindness by punctured eyes
Punished to wander without end, on roads cloaked in black

Unveiling the secrets of perdition, shackled in their dark until death... shackled in their dark until death... until death
