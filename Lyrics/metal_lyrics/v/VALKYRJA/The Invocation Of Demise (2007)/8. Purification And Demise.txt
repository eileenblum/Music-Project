Poisoned by the wine of death, I watch my last sunset
Bury my remains, let the worms feast upon me
Once inside a marele casket, the eerie angst lies slain
No longer blinded by distress, by life's retribution

Clad in leprocy and cancer, the silence is about to burst
As our doom will ride the skies and glare on planet earth ablaze

Desolation beyond desolation, silence, tormenting silence
It's speechless lips sings the macabre coming, when every atom is dissolved by fire

The endless sulphur drops of death, with cremation in every step
Oh, rise you shall, oh fearful doom, to scorch the world and all upon
The snow lies still so quiet, as far as the eyes can reach, tomorrow it will all be ashes

Poisoned by the wine of death, I watch my last sunset
Bury my remains, let the worms feast upon me
Once inside a marele casket, the eerie angst lies slain
No longer blinded by distress, by life's retribution

Clad in leprocy and cancer, the silence is about to burst
As our doom will ride the skies and glare on planet earth ablaze

Desolation beyond desolation, silence, tormenting silence
It's speechless lips sings the macabre coming, when every atom is dissolved by fire
