Rapidly diseased, your life drift away, speared so malevolent in the blackest chapter of all

And once again the threads of life tangeled into venomous gallows of disease, the black death weld it's scythe

Stench of rotting bowels, moans from dying masses, praying for salvation as their threads tangeled tighter

Suddenly you see, this is how it ends
Incinerating pain, pierced by suffering

Taking breath by breath as the lungs are filled with blood
Under the insanity's spell dismembering their infected flesh
Decay, putrefaction, endless mass graves
A cattle to be slaughtered, a harvest to be reaped

A last somber thought, death was always present
Where unearthly bliss would hand it's light salvation was hollow

The black death weld it's scythe... the black death weld it's scythe

Rapidly diseased, your life drift away, speared so malevolent in the blackest chapter of all
And once again the threads of life tangeled into venomous gallows of disease, the black death weld it's scythe

Without any value you are to be reaped
