Fire rained from the opened sky, all I did was behold as the world crumbled

I saw blood and tears from every being blending slowly
The rank smell of fear decreasing with each death

Withstand, bleeding world, finally your end has come to pass

Standing silent, beholding the dawn of Armageddon, the final call

As one with conquest as the earth faced flames, so long I've seen this in visions past

One single tear runs slowly across the tainted face, none shall resist, all shall wither
Meaningless herarchy, beneath death all is nought

Standing silent, beholding the dawn of Armageddon, the final call

Global murder, the final chapter closed, none shall resist, all shall perish

Toward the land beyond, toward the land of frost

Toward the land beyond, toward the land of frost

Toward the land beyond, toward the land of frost
