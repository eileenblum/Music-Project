Chained to the negative urges, thirsting for the knowledge which time has cloaked
The walls around surrounding with it's apathy, nostalgic memories of blood and concrete
The clamour has faded and belong to the past, surrounded by nothingness, cursed in silence
Hungering the powers not of earthly existence, purposeless travelling through days in repeat

The clamour has faded and belong to the past, surrounded by nothingness, cursed in silence
Fires of agony, blinding pain, through fire and brimstone death prevail

Bound to seek in blindness with my thirst not to be stilled, bound to the make way across the endless fields of thorns
Chained to desperation with it's cold breath down the neck, behind the bridges are burning the ways back all have perished
A last look at the sky before the only light which is merely just a pitch black empty stare drained of hope
Dark shapes drowning before your eyes in bottomless seas of anguish
As the firmantes turned black and the stars forever faded, the paths all became narrow, the strive reached it's end
In the ashes of a world that once was one with delight, we shall kneel and let the fire unite us with the ground

The clamour has faded and belong to the past, surrounded by nothingness, cursed in silence
Fires of agony, blinding pain, through fire and brimstone death prevail

The clamour has faded and belong to the past, surrounded by nothingness, cursed in silence
Fires of agony, blinding pain, through fire and brimstone death prevail

Through fire and brimstone death prevail
