War and fire, death and bloodshed, smoke and flesh cremated to ash
In the burning streams of fire, burning corpses fleshless rest
Smell the fragments of your body burning, bleeding, melting, bursting
Murdered masses, genocide, death is dancing on our grave

Kneel before destructions master, this is answers to his prayers
Hear the cries of wounded infants, hear the sound of bodies breaking
This must be the only reason living in a world that bleeds
This must be the utter frontier between fascination and obsession

Let destruction rape creation, break the neck of life itself
World demolish, it all shatter, for so long I've longed this day

Do what has to be done for pain, do what has to be done for death
Do what has to be done for blood, whatever mass murder craves
Open your stomach and I shall eat, open your veins and I shall drink
Crush my skull, split me in half, death is dancing on our grave
