Wielding fire against the core of life, dividing it's flesh in blinded devotion
In agonizing blazes, in twilights scorching fires, sweep through existance, curdle our blood
Spraying veins, pain ablaze, a spear into the heart, stake the orgin of life

Careless let the maggots feast upon your being
And empty eyes behold the loss of physical possession
The empty torso is screaming lifeless, the mind is in delight
Destruction, your poison is injected in the soul and the flesh

The empty torso is screaming lifeless, the mind is in delight
Destruction, your poison is injected in the soul and the flesh

When earth and sky are set ablaze and man and death unite
My morbid wish will reach it's climax, when only ruins remain

Let every single structue burst, lungs and water mate, the chalice with venom pouring down my throat
As a sun over the thirsting, as a wave toward the drowning, with fierce power crushing every wall in the way
As diseases to the dying, as flames toward the burning, only my ruin remain
