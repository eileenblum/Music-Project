The wage of sin is death.... but what is this death
Is it where death was born as taught by pious souls?
Who wage a war on peace to thieve from what is free to deny our very breath in the guise of spirit

Will the dust return to dust
Shall the spirit be damned to burn
Will the dust return to dust
Shall the spirit be damned

Get thee back plastic shaman
Plastic shaman you fear your own truth is false

Fearing the wrath of God
It's men who hammer the nails fearing the death of our souls while man cuts flesh from bone

Get thee back
