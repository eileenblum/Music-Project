The stage is set
Thieves hedge their bets
Blood campaigns ravenous cold 
Teeth hungry grinding greed sharpened by twisted need 
Grim plans unfold as white as snow 

Smirking at those who struggle 
False feints at empathy
Completely drained of all humanity 
Calculate to divert attention from malicious grave intention
Laughing from tables tall as we fight for the scraps

How did we fall so far so far from grace
Can't we see our dignity
How did we fall so far from grace
Can't we see our dignity
How did we fall so far down 

Smirking at those who struggle 
False feints at empathy
Completely drained of all humanity 
Calculate to divert attention from malicious grave intention
Laughing from tables tall as we fight for the scraps

How did we fall so far from grace that we cannot see our original face

Broken again empty promises from calloused hearts
Broken again
