Locked in a cage surrounded by fools 
Who hold all the keys who make all the rules 
Let's make a stand for once and for all 
This broken machine is destined to fall 

Arising from bended knees
Triumphant
Arising

Storming the gates taking command 
Breaking the chains that shackle this land 
Raging with power scream for release 
Awake from the sleep of centuries 

Arising from bended knees 
Triumphant
Arising
