Worshipping ghosts blood flowing red
Haunting the living
Haunting the dead
Teach all the children the things they should dread
Spirits broken by guilt
They're force-fed
Broken by hope
Poisoned with fear
Sing your god's graces to all who come near
Yet this grace cannot be found on the holy battle ground

Search for mercy in the blackened skies

Religious dogma
Absolute truth
Corpus delicti
Killing our youth
Kill for belief
Bellum sacrum
Rhythm of millions in step with the war drums

Insane with faith
