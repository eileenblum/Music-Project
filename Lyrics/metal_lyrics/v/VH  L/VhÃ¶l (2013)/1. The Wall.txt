A vengeful ghost
An empty shell of former glory
The empty shell
When the world knew itself
When the world knew itself

The wall crumbles in the madness of freedom
This grieving pace of molten dread
Fires burn high reaching cloud and feather
Billions release the purge of ages
Exhale acrid black from the lungs of gods

The wall crumbles in the madness of freedom
