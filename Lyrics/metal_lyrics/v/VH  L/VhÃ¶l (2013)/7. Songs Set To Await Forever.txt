Spinning in circles
Laughing in angles
Dreaming in disguise
From this throne of slumber
As this vision unfolds 
Turning listless within
Barely held in memory
When this gnawing began

On a bolt of lightning comes the shock every nerve ablaze 
The watchful eye of the moon dances like life and death 
Reflecting in the eyes of water of forests of earth 
Reeling from the concussive blast the blast

Countless seismic waves shake souls to their foundations 
From the burn of the searing sun comes the pain 
That orbits wisdom, orbits sun and stars 
Reflecting in the eyes of heaven in the seraphim's hell

Soaring high on ashen skies singing blood red glory
These songs set to await forever
