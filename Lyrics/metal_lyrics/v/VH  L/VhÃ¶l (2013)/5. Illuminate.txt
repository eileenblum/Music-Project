Into endless skies of slumber 
Draped dark curtains shut and drawn tight
Adorned in a blanket of sullen weave
Dense as the deepest sea

In darkness bind
The ending of time 
Illuminate
This initiate 
Illuminate this candle blown out

Ragged red fires dance and play 
Blazing molten heat rising from the deception
Of turning water into wine 
Of turning lead into gold 
Of turning one against other
In decadence this world's heart grows cold

Shaking from my nature shaking off the dust from this ageless trial
Illusions cast aside illusions laid to rest upon the shore
Biting wind hard as stone striking heavy sleep from our eyes 
Revealed by grace torches ablaze the disguise revealed and burnt away

No measure of blood, no measure of hate 
No measure of rage will clean off the slate
