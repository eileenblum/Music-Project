[Testament Cover]

[Leads: MonTagnA]

Summoned to the house of seance
To play the evil tarot cards
To find out what our fate will bring us
Before the war

Approaching now the hour of tiamat
Evil feeling in the air
The chosen wait impatiently
To find the rituals of power
Come out of the fire
Making the legacy known
Predicted by the past, takes its toll at last
Now know when it strikes

The endless fueding shows its fate
The people are all shocked with fright
They know the end is coming near
It's time to fight

The revolution holds on strong
The armies have all met their match
Entire world up in arms
Destruction sees the spirits of anger
Come up from the gallows
Conjured my demons appear
Summoned to my cast, prey this deadly mass
Takin' by the fire you fail

The world became a vast wasteland
Survivors turned to cannibals
Killing everything in sight
Warfare tonight

The armies are all closing in
The populations getting small
Feelings are so cold as ice

Survival names its price
Starting to burn
The rape and violence grows high
A kingdom will rise
To rule with contempt
They will surprise
Kill and repent
The weakness in armies
Won't die

[Leads: MonTagnA]

Leaving now the house of sÃ©ance
Speculating destiny
Wonder if the cards were true
Will wait to find out
And will wait to see
