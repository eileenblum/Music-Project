[Music: MonTagnA, Lyrics: M. Scarpa]

Through centuries of forgotten truth
The perception's line seeks the river of doom
Unsilent reality reaches the earth beyond
As the gospel of apocalypse
The word will drive the inner strength

The beginning silence
Cracked by the balance's quake
Salvation foreseen
By him who sees towards space
And whose name sleeps no more

[Chorus:]
Take the hand of fire,
Hallucinating,
Temporary bound to emptiness
New essence of knowledge
Blood-divine, furybound!!!

The essence of wisdom
Filtered by the 2nd moon
Control comes from the
Ultimate sacred stone...
(take power from) the vibration of thoughts

Amplifier of pain
Hidden in a shadow of dust
Inner spectre of arrakis crumbles
As the storm of knowledge crawls
In siege and gravidates revenge

[Chorus]

Future lost in hellsand glory
Feeding on harkonnen's lust
Erasing of feelings
And being wet by the sacred truth
Hail the hour of revelation!!
