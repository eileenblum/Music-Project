[Music: MonTagnA, Lyrics: M. Scarpa]

The rage that crawls inside of me
Has come to an exit point
A push of idolatry
Will cum from the heart and boil

[Chorus:]
Fitting, setting in a murder parade
Control no longer lies
Balance and dance one more play
Your fucks exalt my eyes

A contribution to social anatomy
You'll take under your crust
A scream of mercy-swallow now-
Will excite and make me fast!!!

[Chorus]

Climbing a wall of blood
Will secure and smash the guilt
A schizo pulse of burning flesh
Will drive you straight in the pit
Instead of blinding my love
Remove your insect cage
You judge wrong my act
...what about to copulate
With a dead mind pack

Salvation in a knife
The course will strife and hide
My conception to be free
...no longer you will be...
