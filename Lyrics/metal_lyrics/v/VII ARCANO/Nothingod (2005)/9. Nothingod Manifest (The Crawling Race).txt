[Music: M. Montagna / D. D'Acunto, Lyrics: M. Scarpa]

Put a man on the edge of time
He just looks like full of all things to come...
Put him in front of the highest question
Definitive answer is untamed instinct.
Take a further step
Towards the beginning
Cannot see the end for pain
And pleasure are knowledge.

A livid moment of universal panic
Has the smell of eternal frenzy.
Spellbound by blindness
Man murder technology
Is the ultimate  saint

The only place where the stench of humanity can't rest
Is a mother's womb pregnant of a new age.
Final curtain left is man's damnation manifest
Circuits of time have (been) made bleed â tied to a nothingod machine

Consumed...deprived...by a forthcoming ecstasy
Refused...by hatred...will extract the moral to thee
Finally blinded by the acid rain the sky will weep

Cio' che ci delinea ai confini dell'era volgare
Ã l'orgoglio di una razza il cui (fattore) umano
Non vuol dimenticare...
Lo sconforto nella ragione
Non smettera' di guidarci
Dove la constatazione nell'oblio
Rimane l'unico lume a confortarci.

Embraced by time course,
A violent degrading turn.
Sleep through mortality,
Swallowed by the era of infamy.
Creeping towards the safest place
Last century engulfs the crawling race
