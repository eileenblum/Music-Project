[Music: Marco Montagna, Lyrics: Marco Montagna]

Blastlight from a dusty sky,
Kingdom of annihilation.
Graveless journey to planet zero,
Interior desecration.

Blow your believes, save your lies
...for there's no restoration.
Dying air, nuclear heart
Intimate deflagration.

Repent your uncommitted sins,
Die fast for your own pleasure.
Crumble down and breath the fire
Dimensions turned into void complete.

[Chorus:]
Screams are the only tongue
Under this ghastly entombed earth.
Rotten tolls for a hellish bell
Slowly steal your ticks.
Generate degeneration...
Suicidageddon takes control!!!

Tragic chants. mindless action.
Deliverance... consuming ambition.
Necrotic pulse. pounding coma.
World gasps for implosion.

Paint your minutes with red hope
'cause starvation has no stops.
Lie supreme, erase your sleep
Human sculptures sell on top

Delete your past, confusion's fast
Crumbling and pumping your veins.
Blowing death, searching breath
Everburning insanity...

Lying down at the edge of dawn,
A vast melting fire's blacking the sphere now.
Deadly ground asphyxiates the sight of man.
Brainless fury, embrace the shadows of the end!!

A masquerade of pain, plague rules once again...
Toxic lymph, blood like pitch,
Forged before judgement day...
Final dream, bleeding answer, earthfucking genocide.

Corrosion of ages. purity faded,
A milestone of destruction.
Forgotten season. end of reason,
Endlust of vindication.
