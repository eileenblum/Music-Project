[Music: MonTagnA, Lyrics: M.Scarpa]

[Pt. 1 â Fear / Anger]

Yes...I'm here to envy your existence
Broken glass, puzzle of uncertainties made belief;
...I'm here, in front of the light of sanity,
To demonstrate the wish of a facing;

And I'm here, subjugated by the thrust
That makes my instinct movable
...and pleasantly naÑve my sin

Let me see the eyes of the one
Who's thirsty for life's shine,
The one who smells of wellbeing...
And you, that  never leave the red
Buried with elegance...

[Pt. 2 â The Act]

[Chorus:]
Prey of my vice,
Tool of my fantasy,
Explosive device of my pleasure-
Final aim of my charisma

Let me enter the land of puerile light
That tastes of common life and enchantment...
Let me enter the backstage of the sweetest recital,
Where the applauses are a request for free life

The turmoil sweats from the pores of impatience,
Impossible to live in the shadow of anger,
Lack of ground...lack of value.

[Repeat 2nd verse + chorus]

[Pt. 3 - Fulfilment / The Rest]

Blinded by the extravagant desire of knowledge
Feel the last act that delivers you to the visible world...
I remove myself 'cause the breath of prosperity...
Now is mine!!
