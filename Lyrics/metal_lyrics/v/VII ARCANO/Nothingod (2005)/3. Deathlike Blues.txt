[Music: MonTagnA, Lyrics: M. Scarpa]

The deepest essence revealed by sacred smoke.
Justice of being trapped in a cell called life.
Denial. devoid. purity. born to inject a wrong air

...generated from the every time call
You need to believe in and to face to...
Regret. switch off. I feed myself from my own pain

A dying space protects the alien eyes
Divinity was reborn from the suffocating rain
Insurance in blood, carved in the speed of emptiness

Don't want to believe in the shelter of a lie
Impossible to rise and live the wheel of time
Pronounce your sermon of mediocrity
And make me swallow the common sense of lucidity

Can't believe / need to erase instead of turning my back
My declaration comes from your lacking existence
My answer to this judgement forecast
Feeds a human death-machinery

Populate the inner meaning
May the indifference to holiness be the saviour...
May not a puppet be the disintegrator of thoughts

Species of dreamers
Dawn of the dyers
Forever exiled in a room
Full
...of empty witness
