[Music: MonTagnA, Lyrics: M. Scarpa]

A new sphere of emptiness roars
Beyond your spectre of fulfilment.
All the lies you taste don't succumb
Behind the sand of enthralment.
Your mind looses gravity again
'cause the last nightmare you can't hide
Brains left to squeeze
At the smell of upcoming suicide...

[Chorus:]
Evolution, strangled course.
Magniloquent sin â accept to be.
No form, no shape.
Symbol of a millennium plague

A cerebral disguise ruled
By a one-dimensional sun.
Forced to live since the dawn
Of those who use to run.
Ecstatic liberty just to hide...
Malevolence withers away.
Pathetic shelter back from where
You can live the lie of another day.

[Chorus]

Dissect my freedom with your moral chains,
Spit on my choice for there's no way out to see.

Infect my word 'cause your pain is my light,
Raising my flag of sin is how I make you die...

Burning high at the stake of humanity;
Enchant your victim with a blind reality;
To exalt my own nature is to bleed in depravity;
To die with my thoughts is brainless insanity.

Creeping on truth, never ask
For identity has to twist.
In the name of the holy masque
And of the sacred deceit...
A blinded past
Is what I receive.
