They tried to hold the boundaries of love
Knowing the last word since the opening act.

Fury traction. Need to fulfil. This distance kills.

Raging from the unknown side, unknown desire
Sentence with life mask, my safety is far away... and dies

Fury traction. Need to fulfil. This distance kills.

Waking from what has been an imagination trial
I now do hear no lies.
Feed on the breathless sleep
What will daylight give me?
Chained pleasures demanded by interferences?

Fury traction. Need to fulfil. This distance kills.

I know the sight that eroded me
Is that (deadly) vital function gift
I feel you'll never know me
Spellbound needs to be obscured.
Getting senseless words. Swallow useless scenes.

Please let madness possess me
Cries. Bring me death before life could kill again
Memories. Wanted to live them forevermore
Thrills. Tell me you want to be scarred too
Extasy. Feelings are fucking me frenzy
