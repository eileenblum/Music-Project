[LP version only - Original verison by KISS]

It's not the beauty maybe
...Just you're still hot
Want to live together
What they forgot
Join the will of tomorrow lady
Get out of today
It's time to kneel
On my way

They're trying to hide from me
The place you'll rise
And where you'll
Pull the trigger of my
Love gun... Deadly gun...

You can't forget me baby
Don't try to lie
You'll never leave me after
This try

This psycho love we let in
Will twist our souls
'Cause I know you can still
Get wet

They're trying to hide from me
The place you'll rise
In death you'll pull the trigger of my
Love gun... Deadly gun...

LOVE...FUCKING...GUN
