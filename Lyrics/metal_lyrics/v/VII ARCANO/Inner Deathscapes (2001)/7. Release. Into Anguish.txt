As a man falls in his unknown
He stops his mortal time.
The state of slave-being is put to an end
And suffering grows sharper.
Yearning what we detest then begins:
The barriers of ignorance.
That which disgust and makes
The karmic wheel go on with violence
Almost seems to be the only way
To emerge and survive

Revealer reason is the sourest of judges
For the sentence has been determined
With no forewarning.

At the end of the day after I'm gone
The sweet figure of the end, it talks to me
Unveiling truths which I repress
At point coming back:
Gentle visions
Of hallucinating realities with no return.

Revelear reason is the sourest of judges
For the sentence has been determined
With no forewarning.

Not being able to find the key,
Contradiction destroys...just to rebuild

Losing the faculty of expression
Incommunicability, insanity overflows.
Return to persecution, annihilating impotence.
Is it accepting or erasing the right conclusion?
Sure of finding the truths in parallel planes
The conflict never ends
