This is a shared reality
Selfishness won't control our lives
I will live how I want
I won't be part of your plan

You think you're god
And frankly I've had enough
Of all this bullshit
You're so full of yourself
Casting judgement down
On those who don't concern you
You're not a god
You're not a god

Get off your pedestal
You're no prize
Open your eyes
Realize this truth

How can you live your life thinking you're a god?

You have no purpose
No one fucking cares
You have no desire
You look so scared

I get so frustrated
Dealing with your presence
It's a curse, not a gift
That you're able to breathe

You're so contradicting
Like a Henna tattoo saying forever
You're so contradicting
Like a Henna tattoo saying forever
