[feat. Ben Keller Of Villains]Looking inside myself
I've come to realize
I am a failure
To those I truly rely
I've come to terms with this
It's something I must accept
It's in the core of my existence

Time and time again it is said
I am a failure
It seems like no matter what
My actions are always wrong
I really try my best (I really try my best)
To live my life
To be a better person
But my conscience can be misleading

BEN
In directing my path
It seems too hazy (seems too hazy)
Like a ship without a sail
I have no direction (no direction)
I need some guidance guide me in the right path (oh god)
I need some guidance
God I need you now
Need you now

I've come to terms with myself
I am nothing but a let down
Look at me and know this
I have failed many I will fail you
My demons have taken over
I no longer have control
I am my own demise
Slowly poisoning myself

I am scum
I am filth
I am a failure
I am a let down

I am scum
I am filth
I am a failure

I have failed many
Look at me know
My demons are here
There is no answer
