This is the world of deceit
No one ever tells the truth anymore
All of you are worthless liars
Why won't anyone step the fuck up?

We are disconnected from reality [2x]

Show some remorse you coward [4x]

Hiding behind your veil of lies
Come forward and approach me now
We'll see who makes it out alive

This world is dead

Now you understand my frustration
In dealing with your pathetic being
So get the fuck away
And stop screaming lies
Right into my fucking face
Get the hell out of my way
Get out of my way, you fucking liar
