[feat. Taylor Voeltz of Mureau]I have come to cleanse

I'm not afraid to die for those I love
Come at me with all you've got
Bring forth Goliath
If you want me, come and get me
Just know that I will be the end
The end of you and your breed
I will be the end
Of you

Oh shit
Send your false idols and gods
I bring forth deicide
Whatever it takes to stop you
And the plague that comes with your words
I have come to cleanse
I have come to destroy
I am a fucking messenger

[Taylor Voeltz]
Bring forth Goliath
Send your false idols and gods
Bring forth hell itself
For I have come to cleanse
And rain doom upon you
You fucking little whore

I'm not afraid to die for those I love
Come at me with all you've got
Bring forth Goliath
If you want me, come fucking get me
Just know that I will be the end
The end of you and your breed
I will be the end
Of you

[Taylor Voeltz and Jake]
I'm not afraid to die for those I love
Come at me with all you've got
I'm not afraid to die for those I love
Bring forth Goliath
