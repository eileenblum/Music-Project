I awake from an everlasting sleep
With this overwhelming hunger all around me
Instincts take over like never before
New senses within like never before
People's screams are heard in the distance
They only draw me closer
Some are within sight
A surge comes over me
A craving unlike any other's being felt
A roar is building inside as I begin to charge

There are others around who do as I do
Many people try to fend us off
But they are foolish, they're outnumbered
We came, we fucking conquered

This is the end of the world!

Resistance is useless
There is no escape
Just give up, lose hope
In the presence of your conquerors
We came, we fucking conquered
This is the end
