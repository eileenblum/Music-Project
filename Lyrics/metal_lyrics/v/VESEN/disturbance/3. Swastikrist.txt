Not percieved to be ours
The spirit of the age

Human filth:
- "We are the blameless
Under a flag of rage
Not aggressors
Not to blame"-

The essence of the modern

Silent defenders of evil
Unknowing hordes of hell

I am your Jesus Christ
I am your Swastika
I rape your apathy
I am your reason to fight

Not percieved to be ours
The essence of the modern
The spirit of the age
