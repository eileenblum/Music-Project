By a church twice in flames
At the arrival of midnight
Twelve times around the grave
Upon the tomb I chant your name...

Finkenhagen, Finkenhagen
Rise from the dead
Finkenhagen, Finkenhagen
Rise from the grave

Legends tell of the witching hour
Black magic - resurrection
Bring the priest back from hell
Chant the name of the mysterious

Finkenhagen, Finkenhagen
Rise from the dead
Finkenhagen, Finkenhagen
Rise from the grave

A legacy of nightmares
Frightening visions of the ruins
On the altar where lies were preached
Stands the priest, now as a ghost

- preaching death!

Finkenhagen, Finkenhagen
Raised from the dead
Finkenhagen, Finkenhagen
Raised from the grave
