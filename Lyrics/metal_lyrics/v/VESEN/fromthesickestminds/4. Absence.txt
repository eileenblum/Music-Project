Attracted by the absence of my laughter
Kept close 'til I opened myself
Terrified by my fond affection
Driven away, leaving me alone

Shone upon by the mourning light
I found myself - lost and betrayed
No soft voice, no comfort for me
Solitude was all I could see

Playful youth, you passed me by
Shameful truth, I'm here to die
As my wrist cries for you
I wonder when I turned to dust

My reverence for you,
Denied my gentle touch
My last joy became my last sorrow
Burdened by my desire

Ever longed for, ever looked for
Found, but never embraced
Solitude is all I can see
Solitude is all I can see
