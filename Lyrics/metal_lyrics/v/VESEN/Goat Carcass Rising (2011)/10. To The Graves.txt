Clowns and kings driveling
Arrogant hope-eaters

Bible bashers - On the wall
Hardcore thrashers - Standing tall
The same old news
Bible bashers - On the wall
Hardcore thrashers - Standing tall
A twelve bar blues

You could have, you should have, you would have - Come on
You live like you live forever

Sloth and pride justified
Molded clay, old school trained

The bastard sons - Ruled obeyed
Talent undone - Grand clichÃ©
A hive of drones
Alien race - New parade
Put in place - Old crusade
Kill their cults - Kill their cults

Justified in the court of Caligula
Metal is best served old

Hope-eaters, dogmatic preachers
Justified in the court of Caligula

New parade, old crusade
Rules obeyed, grand clichÃ©

Old patrol takes control
Stranglehold on your soul

Fuel your own blaze - Lead the way
Take your own reins - To the graves
No more delay
Lead your own way - Fuel your blaze
To the new graves - Take the reigns
Dig up new hate
