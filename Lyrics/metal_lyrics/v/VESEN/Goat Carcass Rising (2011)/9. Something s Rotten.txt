Something's rotten in the state of mind
Embrace betrayal with hungry eyes
Take the moral low ground

Something's rotten

Rancid, ruptured mind

Bless slave downed in flies
Bless king crowned in lies
Whipped will satisfied

Something's rotten in the state of mind

Crawl in pathetic dreams

Something's rotten in the state of my mind
