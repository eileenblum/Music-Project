Goat carcass rising
Putrid skin crawling
Stripped and resewn
Dressed in leather
Goatskin

Preach to the choir
Conform dissent
Lead the way to stagnate

Climb downwards
Steal the flame
Climb upwards
Inhale the fame

Tonight the rats will pay
Tonight the goats will play

Again the rats will play
Again the goats will pay

Fighting won battles
Profane parody
Top class conformity

Franchised rebel
Desperate for sin
Dressed in leather
Standard fit
One size fits all

Parasitic
Regulated demonic
Second-hand protests
Elitist copy-rat

Uniformed uniqueness
Goat carcass rising
Stripped and resewn
Dressed like the rest

Goatskin
