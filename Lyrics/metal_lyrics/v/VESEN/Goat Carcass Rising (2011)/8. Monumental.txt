At the threshold of the dollhouse
On the verge of surrender
It is my shelter
But can I try my insanity?

MonuMental disturbance

Shadows fall
From a brighter past
I raise my hand
Total eclipse

Scars of wisdom?
Murder of Utopia
Shadows fall
I fall with them

Behold the unexisting stain
Beauty is a state of mind
Fragile to a closer view
Can I trust my insanity?

Can you feel my pain?
