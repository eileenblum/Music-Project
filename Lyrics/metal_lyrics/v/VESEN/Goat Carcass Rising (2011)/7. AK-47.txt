In the valley of riches
I find no value at all
The flickering flame of sanity
So alone, so filled with pride

My heart wears the crown

Through the valley of gold
I find no value at all
The desolate plains of riches
I leave the rat-race behind

I've been starving the dead
I've been selling my soul
For at a stab at my fate

Alive - come on!
Arise - come on!

Goat carcass rise
Goat carcass dance
