Never, never
Shall I enter the chaos
In which they thrive
Never, never again

Shame - Licking my wounds
Regret - With a sober tongue
Into the chaos - I'm trapped
Movement equals death

Mindfield paranoia

Preparing for the past
I can always count on guilt
I am guarding my grave
Fighting battles lost

Backwards into the future
Headfirst into the past
Backwards into the future
Hell-bent to repeat
