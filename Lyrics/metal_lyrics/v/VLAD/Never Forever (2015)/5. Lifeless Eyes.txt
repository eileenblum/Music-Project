Worship your malice
Ask for no forgiveness

Malignant is your name without constraint
Fallacy is your title when youâre weak
Judgmental is your understanding
Violent is your truest nature

I see through you

Mortality is your burden you must bare alone
Constant pain of life is your path

Destruction and chaos command your ways
Everyone in this life will die
