Losing my mind
Losing my self
Spiraling downward
Into deconstruction
Losing my strength
Losing my sight
I am dust decaying
Alone I will die

Nothing is a being I am and will become
Blackness is my essence, to which I return
Twisted, mangled, warping fragments of what I called myself
Evaporating into the void where I originated

I am hollow
I am dust decaying
Alone I will die
Spiraling downward
Into deconstruction
