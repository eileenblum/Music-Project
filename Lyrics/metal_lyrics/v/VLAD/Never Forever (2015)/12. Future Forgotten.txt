(We are our only salvation, there are no gods to save us)
(Nothing is real)
(There are no gods to save us, we are our only salvation)

All consideration is lost in moments of weakness
These dire circumstances halt all progress
Lies are easier accepted than harsh truths
Reflections of hopelessness render everything I thought I knew useless

Useless
(There are no gods to save us, we are our only salvation)

Darkness never knew such disgust until human consciousness
Was born from a light that never knew such torment could breathe
All conversation and words bare no meaning
When the mind cannot comprehend itâs own self

Itâs own self

Lost in worlds unnoticed
Where time and space are just untrue concepts
Made to distract the thoughtless

All purpose and reason has been forgotten
As I drift eternally in the sea of shapelessness with folded arms across my chest
I dream in the realms where earthly eyes only see themselves

I dream in the realms where earthly eyes only see themselves

I fear not for my self, but for my soul
I question my strength to handle immortal unrest
Blessed with rewards of Oblivion
My selfish mind and my empathetic mind wish for the end of all things
And all things enveloped in darkness
May all things exposed by light crumble with time
May my words mean nothing in the eyes that live

Lost in worlds unnoticed
Where time and space are just untrue concepts
Made to distract the thoughtless
