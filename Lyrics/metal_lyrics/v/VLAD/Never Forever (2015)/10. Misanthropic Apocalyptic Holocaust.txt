I'd off my self
If I didn't love you
I sold my soul
To the Devil
I don't fucking care
About anything
I just want to live
I just want to die

I am so fucking sick
I'm losing my mind
Pretending like I am not

I would kill
Every single one of you
Just for pissing me off
I'd leave you where you lie
And let you rot

If I didn't care about everyone
I'd set this entire planet on fire
I would set this whole fucking world on fire
