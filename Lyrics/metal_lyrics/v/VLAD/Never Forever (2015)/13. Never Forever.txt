My world is dying
My faith has burned to ashes
I feel dead inside
Nothing moves me
Cold hearted and entranced
In finality

My eyes are lost
My mind is nothing
My concept of reality
Is completely wrong
I understand nothing
I never asked for this
To be trapped in flesh
A crime to ask for death
The silence is deafening
I want to end this suffering
I want to end this
I want to end this

I want to end this
Forever

Never to live again
Never to breathe again
Never to see again
Never to think again

Never to feel again
Never to be remembered

Never Forever
