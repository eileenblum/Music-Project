Lying on the altar, unborn before the mass
The wolves eyes shine through the darkness,
Your soul is split in half
The duality of you, separated in two
Displayed for you to see, your infinity alive

Conquest for absolution, the lust to dominate
Will sink you further down into an early grave
Vindications are mundane, lest you're untouched by sin
The ruling of your judgments is a trial no one wins

I am the judge, the jury, the executioner
I am my own worst enemy, I am my own lord and savior
A true warrior fears no death
At even odds polarizing our own selves

The wind howls like a monster through the ruins of God
