Seek thyself, ye shall find
Covet power, ye shall divide
The conquered moment is yours to keep
The more you owe, the more you reap

Their twisted egos, their sharpened daggers
They sling their arrows from behind cover
They'd sing a different tune, if they were alone with you
They'd grovel for forgiveness, fearing what you'd do
