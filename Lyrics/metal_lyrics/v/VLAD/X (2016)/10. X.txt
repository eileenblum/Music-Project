Wading in feces
Piss, shit, and blood
Choking on vomit
Sinking in sludge
Your flesh is melting
Your heart is racing
Fatigue claims you in this putrid sea

Your subconscious mind wraps you in it's tentacles,
And makes you lose your strength as it drags you down
Into the darkest depths of the deepest abyss
Revealing the most complex puzzles of your consciousness

Music and lyrics written, recorded, and produced by Anthony House 2016.
