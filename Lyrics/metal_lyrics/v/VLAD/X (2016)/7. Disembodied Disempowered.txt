Realize that you are blind
You've never known anything at all,
You have understood even less
You are lost forevermore

You are on a lower plane,
You must realize your place
No matter what you've read or heard
Nihilism shall devour
The blood of decapitated saints
Flooding the civilizations of men
Choking on the holy water
Poisoned by others
