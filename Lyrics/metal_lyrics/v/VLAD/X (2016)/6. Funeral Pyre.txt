Dagger like eyes stabbing holes through my privacy
Tearing a hole through my illusion of security
Playing a game with what I call my reality
Farming my blood and reaping my sanity

They try to shift my thoughts into monotony
They try to turn our lives into a monopoly
They provide you Hell when you strive for divinity
Being pure of sin is impossible when you support society

Opening the gates of Hell,
It's easy to unveil
The demons welcome you with smiles,
As they drag you in the fire
