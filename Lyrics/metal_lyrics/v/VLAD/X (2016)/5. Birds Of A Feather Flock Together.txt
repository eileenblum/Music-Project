In the times of Babylon, the Kings would sit
On a throne lower than the people's heads
Bowing to his subjects, holding his own grace
In showing servitude, exposing humility

These are the Kings of men
Not the weak disciples who demand respect
In expensive attire and luxurious homes
Who are these men trying to control my soul?

Politicians
Business men
Religious zealots
Conservative fascists
The envious and falsely proud
You will get no respect from me
