Damnable graciousness
In the midst of atrocity
Dead men tell no tales
Except for the bones in the closet

Behind closed doors
In the domain of the evil and wicked
In illusion of secrecy
The demented take advantage, and defile reality

Conscientiousness has been dismissed
"Common Sense" was just a book
Consciousness is in duress
Herein thyself thy never look
Lest you can withstand the power
Of the intrinsic, inverted, internal sight
Cast a blind eye on that which you've buried
Silence your tongue among the feeble and weak
