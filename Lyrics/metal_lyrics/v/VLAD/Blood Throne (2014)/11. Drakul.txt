Blood of lava, bones of stone
I claim the Earth as my throne
Skin of dirt and teeth like shards
I stand alone amongst the gods

I am Drakul

Eyes of flame and a blackened heart
No concern for opinion
Subliminal depths of unknown consciousness
Echo endlessly through my being

Consciousness directed toward my aim
