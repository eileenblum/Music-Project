The age of redemption is out of our reach

The towers are falling that they built with blood and gold
For centuries men have built these structures for us all to behold
Behold de-evolution and insecurity
Betrayal of promises, truth kept in secrecy

Void of all emotion, we feel as though we're free
idiots devoid of purging selfishness and greed
Lying to each other and to our reflections
Constructing inner monuments to rival those of governments'

I have to have faith in everyone
My life is in your hands
I wish I were out of reach
