Never to be seen
Never to be known
Beyond comprehension
Beyond empathy

Why do we need this light?
Messiah is within
Why do we need this life?
Incarnate into this

Death is imminent
It is not alone
Life is eternal
Forget and repeat

I believe in all
All answers are within
You have lost your sight
Do not deny nothing

Holding on to life with fear and hate
You don't understand what you are in fate
