With eyes like the sun, I stare into the mirror
My thoughts are flashing and burning
A look within visceral consciousness
Reflections of awakened beings laughing in the faces of death
The weak minded trembling in the presence of courageous hearts of flame

Rise up and be
Stare down spirals
Fractal eternity

Consume flesh for power
Self evolving/devolving temple
Constructive/destructive commandments exact the will of God
