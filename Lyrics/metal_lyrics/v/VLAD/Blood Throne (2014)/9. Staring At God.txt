Non-challengers are seeking justice
For everyone but their selves
No judge and no jury, they reach a verdict
Mundane trials of injustice

Increasing paranoia
Losing energy
Waiting for salvation
Resentful of death

I have felt weakness
I have known my strength

I have been to the edge of nothing
The end lets me know the beginning
Staring at God, away from the flesh
Disintegrating everything
