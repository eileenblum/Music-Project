Vanity is meaningless
You are a narcissist
You are not a reflection
You are not perfection
All this time you waste in vain
Just to ignore your pain
Your judgements of yourself will drag you down to hell

You are betraying nature and you don't even care
You project your vanity onto everything
Your consciousness is fading as you focus on your flesh
You are dying, you are rotting
What will be left of your vanity?
