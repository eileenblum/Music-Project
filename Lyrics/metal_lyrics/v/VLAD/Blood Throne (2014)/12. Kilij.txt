How dare you come to attack me?
Who are you above my self?

You will know my wrath
You will know your fear
You will feel my blade
You will all die here

I will will feed on your blood and more

This is my world, you are not a part of it
Do not test my will, or you'll compete with no one
You will bow before me, I am your God
If you refuse me, you will die before me
You are weak, and so are your idols
Everyone you love will always scorn my name

This is my world, you are not a part of it
Do not test my will, or you'll compete with no one
You will bow before me, I am your God
If you refuse me, you will die before me
You are weak, and so are your idols
Everyone you love will remember my name

I am the king
I am the lord
I am the reaper
I am the sword
