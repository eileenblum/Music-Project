Taking my energy from me
You live and die in disgrace
Demonic cyphoning
Of all I am, feeding off my power
You are a burden no one wishes to bear
Your vile existence belongs in hell
Everything you do is to strengthen yourself
Draining the strength from all that's alive

Succubus
Sucking the life out of me
Succubus
Draining my energy
Succubus
Feeding on misery
Succubus
You too will cease to be
