Destiny crumbling
Disarray, atrophy
Decomposed sense of self
All knowledge lost within
Emotions dissipate
Lost of thought, mindlessness
Evaporated Consciousness
Fading in to the abyss

I am one with dissonance
As I fade into the void

Dissonance, I am one with nothing
Disownance, I am one with nothing

I am nothing
I am nothing

Dissonance, I am one with nothing
Disownance, I am one with nothing
