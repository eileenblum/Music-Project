Hollowed out and decaying
Black liquefied holes replace my eyes
Maggots eat my bones underneath my skin
My flesh bubbles and saturates the ground beneath me
My skin is separating, my blood is seeping

They eat me as I am decaying
They eat me as I am slowly rotting

I am being dissolved by stomach acid
Insects are emaciating my reflection
Breaking me down into particles of feces
Post mortem feasting for festering parasites
