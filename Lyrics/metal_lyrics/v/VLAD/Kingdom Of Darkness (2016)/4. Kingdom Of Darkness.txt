Tears are raining from the sky
The angels of Heaven sob in our absence
Annihilating each other everyday
This war has been affective since our creation

The battle of desire, the war to survive
The race for divine cleansing, contaminating lives
Pursuing goals of those who'd wish to see you die
Losing your self and mind in spiritual genocide

Running on the rat wheel
Going nowhere
Competing for nothing
Devolving, you're dying
Innocence is lost to the majority
Of people who are slaves to global, evil monarchy

Kingdom of Darkness
Thy Kingdom will come
