Condemning this world as just a brutal play
It will not reward you
It will get in the way of living your own life,
Of finding your own way, of being independent
Ceasing your reliance on drama, intrigue,
A sense of belonging in someone else's story
Ceasing your need to be needed
Succeeding your own identity, egos, and beliefs

Practice what you preach

Your self is not away from you
In every second, you are integrated
Into the moment
Your structure is alive with you,
Your sacred temple
This reality's beyond you
You must transcend it

You are the main character in the divine comedy of life
The duality of this universe is centered in you
All that imagination can create is you

You are the main character in the divine comedy of life
The duality of this universe is centered in you
All that is to be is you
