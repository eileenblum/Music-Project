Your reflection isn't you
This face you see is false
You are more vast than the flesh
More alive than the pulse

The energy that is your life
Is stronger than the gravity
That weighs you down, onto the ground
The physical reality is more than just a playground
This planet is alive
You have no need to escape
When you're isolated in the world

No need to control your evil
No use to rediscover purity
No point in trying to be free
When you're alone in infinity
