Aborted mentalities
Deformed thoughts from the abyss
Warped and chaotic dreams
Living life in delusion
Feeling a false sense of closure
From being confused
The wisest man cannot explain
With words made by a human brain

Ultimate knowledge will take it's toll
Our expanding universe is filled with holes
Dichotomies to neutralize
The expansion of our infinite minds

It is unattainable
It is inconceivable
Incomprehensible
Never understandable [2x]
