Enjoy your splendors of eternal loss
Drink from the chalice of the bloody cross
Sacrifice the self that craves liberty
Lay it to rest, bury guilts and burdens shamefully

Suicide of honest self
Embracing a living Hell
Forced from darkness into light
To be judged, and burned alive
Held against uneven odds
Tortured by our loving God
Centuries past, the shepherd's dead
The sheep are blind, lost on their heads

Troubled with eternity
Never will you be set free
Shackled like a vicious dog
Treated like an animal
Hatred forced upon the young
Evil words put on their tongues
Spitting venom heinously
Killing us religiously
