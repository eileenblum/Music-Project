I did not choose this life
To be a sacrifice
In honor of violence
The hour of penance
Judgement is a way of life
Live by the book until I die
All my actions justified
A demon with a sword of light

Holy wars exacted by my hand,
This is my land, your graveyard
I sit upon the throne of blood
I construct my church with the bones of the lost
My righteous God, I exact vengeance
I send you souls of the wicked and weak
May their ghosts be trapped forever
In the bowels of the deep
