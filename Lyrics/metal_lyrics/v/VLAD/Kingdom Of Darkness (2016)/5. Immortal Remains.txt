Shines a light from the depths
Of malice, malignance
Will of steel, stubbornness
Reborn restless recklessness
To be born a thousand times
You have lived before you died
Forgotten and left behind
Erased from mind, lost in time

Reincarnated mystery
Now with misplaced memories
No relevance to the present
That you are presented with

Buried bodies with no names
Decaying mortal remains
A past self in a shallow grave
Your soul will never be saved

This is your domain
You must endure the pain
Through this life's disdain
Immortal remains [2x]
