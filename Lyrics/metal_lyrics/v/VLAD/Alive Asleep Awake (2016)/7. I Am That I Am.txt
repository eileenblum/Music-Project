How many times must I spin around the sun
Searching for the answer to the reason I'm alive?
Endlessly in cycles, spiraling through life
Revolving around God, the closest star

Humanity so close to He
Oblivious and sacrilegious [2x]

The sky is an open Bible
The holiest of all
Written by the truest god,
Unadulterated knowledge

Come to understanding through your acceptance
Embrace this chaotic force that gives you life

Compelling resolution
Defining absolute perfection
Descending spectrums of light
Illuminates my soul and my Third Eye

This natural birthright to claim divinity as my own
I shall not deny

I decide my fate, this I have dictated
My whole life
I am the purest essence of my self
I can only ascertain my rightful
Glory
Triumph
Victory
Success
Domination
Transcendence
Absolution
Kingdom
Heaven

Endlessly in cycles, spiraling through life
Revolving around God, the closest star

Humanity so close to He
Oblivious and sacrilegious [2x]

The sky is an open Bible
The holiest of all
Written by the truest god,
Unadulterated knowledge

Come to understanding through your acceptance
Embrace this chaotic force that gives you life

God is everything
Everything is God
You are everything
You are God
This has been true since before you have known it
This has been true since before you understood it [2x]

This has been true since before you have known it
This has been true since before you understood it
You have been infinite, even as nothingness
You will be infinite, even as nothingness [2x]
