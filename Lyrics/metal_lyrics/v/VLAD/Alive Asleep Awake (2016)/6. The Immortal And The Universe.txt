Tread lightly in the material world
Your actions are always accounted for
All things you do will come back to you
In the end of your life

Should you choose to be reborn,
Awakening will be a trial
Time doesn't heal every wound
Past lives will always haunt you

In the deepest reaches of your mind
You will feel your ancient power
You have been here since before human kind
You have forgotten this with time

To remember who you were
Will take you many years to know
To remember your forgotten names
Is to be reborn anew

There are those who have been wicked eternal
As well as those who are angels forever

Until the end of all things,
Until the void of space devours,
The vastness of your reality
Is infinitely living [2x]

Immortal is our nature
