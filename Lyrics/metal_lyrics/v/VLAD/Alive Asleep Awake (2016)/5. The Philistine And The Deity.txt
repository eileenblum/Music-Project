Trust no one, do not even trust yourself
You have been lied to, and have lied as well
The ruling king of our modern societies
Is betrayal of the soul, total dishonesty

You hide behind your veil of pain
Of which you can not see through
To lift it is to be blinded
By the radiant light of truth

Your comfort is only a delusion
Your life is only an illusion
Human communication in it's entirety
Leads you further away from divinity

To try to explain the truth
Is only to make us all confused
No matter how simply one can word it
It will never be understood

Mortality gives you false hope
That you can do and say all that you want
If you knew you were immortal
You would have chosen purity

Remain in the silence of your mind
It's the truest form of God
Communicating to you from the cosmos

The quiet is louder than you have believed

Do not justify your sins
Under the guise of innocence
Death is but a transformation
You choose your evolution

All is judged on even scales
Your sins are compared to mine [2x]
