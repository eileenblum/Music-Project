In the cemetery of your self
You will find that you were lost
Never once had you meditated
On the concept of your demise
You focus solely on your uprising
Never upon your personal downfall

To be a true leader you must understand
The Sword of Damocles is not just for one man
It circles above your head
Hanging on by a thread

You're held to the highest standard,
Eyes are watching everywhere
Your headstone mocks your head
Your mind went nowhere, now you're dead

Never underestimate the truth
It's marked in stone now above you [2x]

Seek into the Lord and ye shall find
That you are he, and you hath failed

Humanity casts it's eyes away
From it's shepherd led astray [2x]
