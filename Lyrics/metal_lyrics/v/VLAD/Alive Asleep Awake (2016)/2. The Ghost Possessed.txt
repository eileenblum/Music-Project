Demanding sacred rights
Is not a pagan act
They who feed upon the light
Have our souls under attack
You must defend your heart
You must transcend your mind
Nature gave you laws to follow
Your body is only borrowed

The possessions of the man
Possess the man to be possessed
Cyclical and trifle
You have to do your best
To never be scared
To always be calm
To be content with what you have
Realize you were fine all along
Hold a ceremonious thought
Believe your faith to be your strength
Discover what was lost
In the abyss of what you were taught

"Thy soul shall find it's self alone
Mid dark thoughts of the grey tombstone
Not one or all the crowd to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy
Be silent in that solitude,
Which is not loneliness
For then the spirits of the dead
Who stood in life before thee
Are again in death around thee"
[- Edgar Allan Poe]
