Commanding sacred structures that aren't their own
Devolving adapting organisms
This is spiraling out of control
The system run by enslaved human souls

Destroying all that's right, procreating what's wrong
Attempting to fix what was fine all along
Instead of peace the government chooses to fight
They feed upon the losses of innocent lives

They who feed upon more than bread
They who feed upon controlling your head
They with enough money to provide a guise
That they will lead you, then why do they hide?

Oil companies sacrificing civilian lives
Raping and pillaging every single kind
Of living, breathing, radiant light
This consciousness is dark, it's behind your eyes
You cannot separate I from I mind
Nor from the cosmic divinity we all share inside

Outside the norm, you just might die
Outsiders are not welcome under society's sky

Everything changes except humans in cages
Ancient mysteries demystified from before you had died
You sell your holy trinity, Soul, Body, and Mind
I don't give a fuck what you tell me, you wasted your time
