A microscopic pulse on a planet in space
Is a beacon of hope for the conscious sentient
The smallest fibers of material
The largest stars of any galaxy
All melt together in the vertex
Neutralized, equalized
All complexities unravel
All simplicities unite

In this negating meditation
Many things will come to light
Do you appreciate your life?
Would you care if you had died?

Do you serve a greater purpose?
Do you embrace the Earth, or do you avoid it?
Alien intelligence in the people's ignorance
Lack of self accomplishments
Your ancestors, you dismissed
You view the truth as lies
Confused from evil all your life

If you find no comfort in the sky
Consider yourself dead inside
This world used to be beautiful
Humanity has made it ugly
This world used to be Heaven
Humanity damned it to Hell
Devout devoured,
Sacrificial sacred suicide

Offer up your ego for nothing
Let nothing fill you, let it rid you of your lies
You sit upon a throne of bones
Cloaked in the flesh of human kind

At the top of the spine,
Your kingdom inside of the mind
Imagination, communication
Ascend the spirals of conscious perception
Create for yourself a divine dedication
Refuse the evils of human deception
Forgiveness, transcendence
No lust for decadence
Reaffirm your truest intent
May your soul be vigilant

God eat God
Until all gods are one
God eat God
Until all gods are one
