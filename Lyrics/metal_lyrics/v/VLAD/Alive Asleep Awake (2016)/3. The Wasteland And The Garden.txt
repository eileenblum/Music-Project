Awaken to the other world
Seemingly subtle, yet far more profound
The mundane reality gives your free will purpose
Mortality is simply illusion

The pinnacle of selfishness is upon us
Those who devote themselves to higher planes
Shall be rewarded by the silent gods

Embracing the cataclysm that isn't being
Will elevate your consciousness,
If you have the strength

Molded as a beast into the world of the living
I am a soul burning bright in absolute darkness
