Neglected love, I preach disorder
And I watch you pray... recite your prayers
When you pray to me, you'll find I'm colder
Than a long dead soldier mourning cold-blooded murder
The apocalypse sounds romantic to you,
So I'd torture you, if it suited you
You only speak truth when your mouth's not moving
And I watch you pray... Recite your prayers!

Cast a miracle, summon me a beast
Wave your magic wand, dance naked and feast
Show me something new, conjure God itself
Prove your own power or your faith is shit!
Let me behold your mystic's sorcery,
Point out to me the same ghosts that I see
Could you divine me the bones of my past self,
Or read me my fortune as fortunate for certain?

Come with me and you'll only get further
Away from the world where humans crave order,
Yet are swept away in their impure cycles;
Driven by conceit, in a downward spiral
You will find that you had no power
Before my presence, you are but a flower
A delicate creature barely dying nor living,
A porcelain doll locked up in prison

[2x]
I will give this to you, my forsaken love
A gift beyond that of earthly affections;
An eternal refuge in which we may hide in,
A blackness beyond human comprehension!
