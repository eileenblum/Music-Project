Shy away from society, far away from civility
Here you will find reality, and a sense of humility
As long as you're alive, you will fight to survive
This is your sense of self, once you renounce the hive!
Like festering parasites, humanity is a blight
Like tears in the fabric of space, they devour the light
Now that you're all alone, you connect with what's natural
No need to be sorrowful, now you're much more powerful

The only way the age of sin will ever end
Is if all human souls became like friends,
Never possessed by the seven deadly sins;
Vigilant in spirit, permanently cleansed
Unfortunate for the entire planet
Is the fact that humans take it all for granted
They'll destroy the Earth simply out of habit,
If the people want Hell, well then let them have it!

Be baptized in the raging tides of a tsunami
Stand atop the volcano as it erupts under your feet
Fly like the leaves left in the wind to return to the desert's sand
Magnetize yourself to the electric volumes of the land!
Before too long, you will begin to understand
That which can't be understood by the likes of man
The tentacles from the abyss will wait for your knowledge,
Memories abducted through wormholes, for celestial storage...
...These are the books of the dead
