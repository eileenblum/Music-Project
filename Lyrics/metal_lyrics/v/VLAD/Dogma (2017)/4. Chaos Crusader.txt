Abandon your suffering, it's time to celebrate
The infinite chaos in which loudly resonates
The entire omniverse with a hypnotic noise
We must all be one with it, or be one with the void!

Divinity is shining and reflecting off itself
Darkness is devouring and absorbing itself

I am a part of this twisted being,
Beyond death, yet not quite living
In eternal suffering and immortal ecstasy,
Impoverished with riches, wealthy in all that's empty
My castle is left burning, my tomb is left standing!

Darkness is devouring and absorbing itself
Divinity is shining and reflecting off itself

I have become someone disinterested in mundane and earthly gimmicks
I am that I am and will always be, godhead beyond reality
Suffer songs I sing to you as a demonic shadow,
For the music bears knowledge from beyond the hollow
You must wake from the ancient slumber, wake up to the nightmare
I've been waiting for your eyes to open and to meet with my stare
This entire world is just a lie you and I share,
The only truth is you and I are the only ones that care...

...About the lie that we all share
Just look around you, there's brainwash everywhere
If my mind was a weapon, would I wish my weapon dull?
I master the human organ birthed within my skull
A sharpened intellect to annihilate my foes
All sorcerers will die by the sword,
All witches will be tried and burned
Until they learn I'm a motherfucking beast!
