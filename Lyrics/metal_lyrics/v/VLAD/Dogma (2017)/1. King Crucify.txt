Staring through evening mist, I saw a shooting star
Ignited and then flickered, in an instant it was gone
Nothing lets you know just who you fucking are-
Like your own mortality, in an instant it is gone!

Never once have I wished to be branded-
My flesh is my own, not a prop
Propositioning me to join in with your legion?
I propose that you fucking stop
You slithering mortals writhing on your stomachs
I'd kill all of you in your sleep...
If it wasn't for the fact that I want your eyes open-
Watching while I slaughter you like sheep

Never raise your hand to me unless you want it removed
Never bow your head to me, you are no worthy subject
All your measly life is worth is being fed to the dogs
I'll send your dripping remains to your kin with my regards

I'm the thorn in your side, I'm the creature in the night
I'm the one messiah, for your sins I died
I drank the blood of God as I sacrificed my father
I'm the Prince of Darkness, you're just cannon fodder

I'm the missing link, The Chosen One of song
The Forsaken King, away from the throne too long
Immortal Champion, I watch all that I love die
A rotten pile of flesh, dead without my bride...

Never raise your hand to me unless you want it removed
Never bow your head to me, you are no worthy subject
All your measly life is worth is being fed to the dogs
I'll send your dripping remains to your kin with my regards!
