Bloodlust is a staple for the outcasts known as man,
There's a red saturated timeline drawn in the ocean of time's sand
The carving out of the eyes of God was done by human hands,
Saints and Christs are killed alike due to popular demand!
Rip off the wings of the angels, throw them in the fire
Send them screaming down into the bowels of the pyre
The cherubs, angels, and saints now fuel for the golden fires of Hell,
Burning holy flesh eternal, the most pungent of smells!

A demon prince am I, a master of all things debauch
I drink blood from the Holy Grail as succubi suck my cock
The joke is upon the harlot as she chokes upon my seed,
As the Devil, I exist to make all entities bleed!

A torture chamber, a zoo to me
Filled with all my pets screaming
Blood on the walls, my gallery
Metal spikes used for painting
Some men get lobotomized,
Beaten and desensitized,
Chased by hungry dogs for fun,
Impaled, left to rot in the sun!

The essence of goddess, made into woman
A queen so pure and righteous in the form of human
Is the only creature that the Earth could possibly give
To make my blackest of hearts have will enough to forgive!
Upon my throne of ice, my queen never feels a chill
Bound in love immortal, death never to tear our wills;
For a single flame can illuminate the entire void,
One person can ensure that the whole world isn't destroyed!

In my dogma, I am God! [12x]
