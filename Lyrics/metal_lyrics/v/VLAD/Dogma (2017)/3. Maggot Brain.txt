There is something in my head, a parasitic voice
It squirms and writhes inside my skull, hidden by my eyes
The pain won't stop, I cannot rest, it's eating at my brain
Ever closer to the edge, held by no restraints

The collapse of my sanity, unraveling the mystery
To ground myself, I'd need the ground to stop falling under me...

There are fucking holes inside my mind
There are missing links I can't explain
I roll my eyes backward to look inside
There are maggots chewing through my brain!

My degradated focus on reality is at stake
The simple life I lead, I'm leading to the grave
If I've lose my mind, then I've lost the Universe,
A Universe of purgatory, shipped out in a hearse

Filthy animals, every human's born to sin
The Devil is the ruler of the world which we live in
All because of you! You could not resist temptation
You'll be crucified by your lifelong reputation
You call yourself a man, but you're just uncooked beef
You morons walk like cattle led by false belief
All you people's energy is gathering and powering
The most depressing thing to see from outside society

[2x]
There are fucking holes inside my mind
There are missing links I can't explain
I roll my eyes backward to look inside
There are maggots chewing through my brain!
