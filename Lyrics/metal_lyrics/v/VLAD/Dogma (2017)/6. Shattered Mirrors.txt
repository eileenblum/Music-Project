I am contaminated by the falseness of society
Politics, religion, and warfare- global calamity
This cyclic degradation is so far beneath me,
Yet I'm trapped within the cycles of hypocrisy
Aeons fly away from my soul, like ashes in the wind
The mortal illusion of time is a mental prison
The human part of my soul is a true domain of sin,
Hence my selfish usage of the body I dwell in

Paradoxical, destruction makes way for creation,
Universes die and are reborn in repetition
Life and death are but the same, as is the dark to light
In the mind of the godhead, there is no wrong nor right!
To compare anything to something it is not,
Is to compare reality to our opinionated thoughts
Wrapped in flights of fancy, you carelessly crave a plot
Over and over, the drama continues- you live your life for naught!

[2x]
Your lips tainted with poison, you know not of what you speak
Your mind is lost to delusion, you know not of which you seek
Mania fuels all the motions of your soulless husk,
Your mind has left you for the void's eternal, starless dusk!
