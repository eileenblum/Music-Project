The process of dying is easier than you think
Would you like me to show you, or do you prefer the mystery?
I could guide you through darkness, I just may take you there...
No senses, no thoughts â we could journey into nowhere,
I could take you there... Into 'nowhere'

The Son of The Dragon â stinking breath, iron skin
The beast thrice forsaken, damned to Hell by my sin
Crown of Scorn, Throne of Woe â I travel where no one will go
Cursed by all, all but One â she rivals me under the sun

All who try by the sword shall be mutilated paste
All who lurk in shadows shall be laid to waste
Salvation isn't free, you'll go nowhere when you die
Your poisoned books won't save you, Heaven is a lie
[2x]
