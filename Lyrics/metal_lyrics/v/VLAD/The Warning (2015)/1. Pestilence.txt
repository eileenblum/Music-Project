World collapses into itself
Whole cultures destroyed, wiped out, no longer to be seen
The government controls the production of medicine
They want you to invest, they want you to give in
To live your life for them, to keep you in their binds
Locked inside a filthy cage made by their design
They quarantine us all from what we need the most
Subjected to their viruses, we're forced to be the hosts

Slave away your health to them, just to buy it back from them
Catch 22's in front of you no matter what you do
Eating at your mind, and poisoning your heart
This is a disease we must be rid of
