Am I alone in this life?
Must I die to transcend?
Will I discover the truth?
Will any of my questions be answered?

This suffering will end
I will no longer be a slave
I will be set free
I will be given my own wings

I will fly away
Into the infinitely open sky
I will leave this place
I will find the home I never knew
I will be welcomed with love
The final embrace
I will finally rest
A passing memory
To be buried in the sands of time
Forgotten and out of reach
I have become a god
