You brought this upon your self
The end of the world
With your wasteful thinking
And unconscious actions

Take a moment's pause
To think of what you've done
To contribute to the destruction
Of the only planet you know

Do you even care of the reprecautions?
Mother Earth is dying
You're raping her on her deathbed
This is your final warning
To cease this selfish behavior
You must change your ways
Before it's too late

This is all your fault
Human beings deserve to die
The eradication is necessary
This is the cycle

An end to this life
An end to our thoughts
The end to what is real
The end to all

This is a wake up call
The final countdown
If you destroy this planet
You will not get another

This is the apocalypse
