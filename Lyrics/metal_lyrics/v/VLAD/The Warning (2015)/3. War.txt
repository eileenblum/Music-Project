This is my world
I work for the better man
I will kill legions of men
My hands must not be idle

I am a man of God
I will use my power
To quench my thirst for blood

I have the upper hand
I will take advantage of all situations
Strategically, surgically, absolute
Methodical, precise, exact
End of your life
It's mine for the taking
I wage no wars
I only win
