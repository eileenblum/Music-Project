There are people dying in the streets
With no one to help them, nobody, no Christ
No savior to relieve their hunger
They're dying of starvation, digesting their own stomachs

Where the hell where you
When the last human being died with nothing to eat?
Were you watching T.V.?
Were you eating fast food?
Staring at a screen?
You people are obscene
Civilians support evil
Lest there be a revolution

Stand up
Rise against tyranny
Rise up
This planet can be saved
