Drink from the springs of poisoned knowledge
You must gain your wisdom, abandon your pride
You have much to learn, can you face the trials?
Knowledge is not comfort, will you embrace it?

Lose your self in vision, spiraling gateways
Enter the gravity of the Universe destroyer
See through the perspective of stars that are devoured
This is where we started, this is where we meet

Everything to nothing, total obliviation
Nothing made everything, the greatest miracle
Phenomena no longer, enter the shaman
Sacred cycling of atomic energy

Enter the container, the vastness of darkness
An infinite nothingness containing lifeforce
The stars will shine much brighter, though they will seem smaller
There's no comparison when you cross the threshold
