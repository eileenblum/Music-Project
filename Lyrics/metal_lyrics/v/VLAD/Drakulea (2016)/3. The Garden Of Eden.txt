Perseverance is my only option
No matter how beaten down I am
I must always strive for honesty
I will find prosperity

The Earth is the biblical Garden of Eden
It provides me with all that I need
I must always be eternally thankful
What else shall I compare my home to?

This love I have is buried in you
Forgotten and left with no stone for the tomb
Resurrect this, and transcend this
I can only help you help your self

Take the reigns and steer us toward the future
You must strive now for what is the truth
You will find that you've nothing to lose,
Lest you find your ego to be you
