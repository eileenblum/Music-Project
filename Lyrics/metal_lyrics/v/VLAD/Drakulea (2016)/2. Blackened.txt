Blackened are my eyes
Blackened is my heart
Blackened is my soul
I become the dark

I am a man among monsters
I am a monster of men
I become the devil
To fight off my demons

This dichotomy
Of neutrality
Is what I will be
Until I'm set free

Blackened

Blackened are my dreams
Tearing at the seams
This reality
Is blackened to me

Ancients in the sky
Surrounded by night
Post-archaic light
Of stars that have died

Blackened
