We're all being played for fools
Robbed from right under our noses
Falling deeper down a well
That's been dry for ages

Slaves to currency
Stolen from legally
Breaking our backs just to eat
On our sweat and work they feed

Everything I see
Steel, plastic, concrete
This society
Is slowly killing me

Our purpose here is lost
We care not for the cost
Of innocent human lives
Because what's mine is mine

We're wasting all our time
Believing other people's lies
We're scared of when we die
Because we know this deep inside

As the human race
We all just want a taste
Of being here in peace
We're all just too busy

Poisoned by our greed
On tears and blood we feed
This society
Is slowly killing me

Everything I see
Steel, plastic, concrete
This society
Is slowly killing me
