See through dreams, astral realms
Higher planes, different worlds
New laws of physics governing the soul
Sleep in the abyss, like a god
Mystic journey, psychic ruler
Claim your throne amongst the galaxies

Let your self die, adapt the void
Feel your self fly, enter the light
Forget your life, leave behind your mind
Let go of your body, the tides will wash you clean
Resonate in spacetime, travel into nowhere
Material left behind, 
Transcend into higher paradigms
