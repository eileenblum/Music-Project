Man is both a dragon and a wolf,
As well as being a man
He stands between the serpent and the dog
As magical and beastial
The realms of Heaven and the bowels of Hell
Circulating through his blood
His mind is sharp and so are his teeth,
He strives to control them both

His majesty is within the heart
His power is in the mind
His flesh is his mortal vehicle
As a soul he flies through time

His destiny he commands himself
His fate, he surrenders
He walks with the gods on a path through the dark,
He serves as his own light

Domination of the self, the strength to be alone
These are the rewards which come with knowledge and wisdom
As a singularity between dualities,
You create a triality

The dimensions you know and which you call home
Are only the beginning
The plane of existence you think is vast
Is just the beginning

Run with the wolf
Fly with the dragon
Think as the man
Illuminate
