Do not ask for anything
From Jesus of Nazarene
He was tortured, mangled, broken
He has nothing left to give

Nothing's good enough,
You thirst for his blood
Nothing is the best,
So you crave his flesh

He can not reach out his hand,
It is nailed to the cross
You deserve nothing from God
When you ask for too much

Your salvation will never come,
You never helped your self
No angel would bare the burden
Of accepting you as a demon

Pray for stigmata
Ask your God for pain
Beg and plead to be tortured
Then may you be forgiven [2x]
