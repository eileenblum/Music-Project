I have been famous men in history
I have been men who's names are lost in time
I have been animal before there were men
I have been alive before there was flesh

I have seen the volcanic rock of Earth
Drifting through space uncontrolled
I have witnessed the organisms flourish
I have seen the beginning of it all

You have been in the same places as I
You have been ethereal, you have been material
You have heard the ancient call
You have felt the resonance of it all

Welcome to the afterlife
This is Elizium, my friends
To a soul's life there's no death
Dying is not a cataclysmic end

You have forgotten this again
They have made you forget
For if you were to reclaim your power
You would be considered a threat

Welcome to the afterlife
This is Elizium, my friends
To a soul's life there's no death
Dying is not a cataclysmic end
