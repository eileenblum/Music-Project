Weaponized intelligence corrupting the hive mind
Manipulate the masses to become thoughtless and blind
We are slaves to addiction, working toward our own death
We serve the New World Order with our every breath
A mechanical shepherd herding us toward our own doom
The gears are turning, smoke is rising, pollute the sky with gloom
The industry shows worship as they kill, erase, consume
Cyber savior, mental virus, exodus in bloom

Secret societies with a scheme for control
They want to enslave your mind, body, and soul

Demonic portals called black mirrors within all of our hands,
We stare into them hypnotized as society demands
Trapped within the matrix, we are eternally damned
Distracted in purgatory, bury your own heads in sand
We ignore archives of knowledge and forget information
We care no more for learning, but for immediate sensation
Anything to make us numb to the pain of modern times
To reject the mind control is considered a crime
Brainwash is evolving faster than the human race
Human kind has been defeated and put into it's place
The women and men are weak, and made a total disgrace
Soon enough technology will have us all replaced

Nature is made obsolete, the obsolete we will delete
We're programmed for terror, free will is just an error
We're all hosts for the virus, the system is infected
The hidden hand in silent warfare through us has been perfected
