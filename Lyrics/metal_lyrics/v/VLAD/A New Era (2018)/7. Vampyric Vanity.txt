All demons we imagine are only self made,
We create them out of our sadness and hate
We give them life, and they take control
We offer them blood, but they take our soul
We like to think that it's only fallacy
That we do not have any true privacy
The eyes from the abyss stare right through the walls
There's a light in the dark, those beyond the void call...

Crucified by the sins we've loved,
Murdered by human hands, not from gods above
Our immortal nature does not make us any more wise,
We repeat the same mistakes through a thousand lives

To be born again and to die finally
In a repetitious cycle for eternity
Does not make us perfect, nor does it make us free;
We are bound by an unchanging identity
Knowledge, money, and murder seem to tempt us all;
We fuel our empires with it even as they fall
We drink the blood and eat the flesh, but cleansing is not there
We will drain all of the life from this world without a care

In praise of natural evolution,
We worship our flesh's mutations
We believe in science, but know it is flawed
We put a human face onto our God

Narcissistic reflections,
Illusions of perfection
If the being has a face, it is doomed to die
Shatter the mirror, and look toward the sky
