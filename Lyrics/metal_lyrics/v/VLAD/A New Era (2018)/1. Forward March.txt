The masses march unguided for centuries in vain
Inching ever closer into a massive grave
Lacking all compassion, they trample over their dead
Fallen sisters and brothers pulverized on their funeral bed
An enchanting droning with hypnotic lights
Render the heard deaf, obstructing their sight
To refuse the motion is to fight the stampede
Endlessly stomped down underneath their feet

Follow the beat of the war drums, there's no time to waste
If you cannot keep up, then be trampled into paste
There are no excuses, there is only do or die
Kill or be killed, any other mantra is a lie
Enlightenment is only granted when you are killed dead
There is no peace in this world, get that through your head
If they have a pulse, then they are our enemy
Wipe them out, send them to God, show them no mercy
Seek and destroy, execute all who stand in our way
If they oppose us, then they signed their lives away
Weed them out, bleed them dry, paint the country red
Kill the target, rape them, gut them, rip them into shreds

Leave no body breathing, take no prisoners
Either fall in line, or sleep now in the dirt
Resistance is futile, nor is it tolerated
Obey our commands or be obliterated
Die for us with honor, your martyrdom be blessed
There is no surrender, march now to your deaths
