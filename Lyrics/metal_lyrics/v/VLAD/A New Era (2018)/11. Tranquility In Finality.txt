Isolation takes it's toll, but has it's own rewards
It is an escape from exchanging shallow words
The emptiness of the fleshy mortals surrounding me-
Makes me want to commit obscene atrocities
Murderous and suicidal all wrapped into one
With every step and every breath my being comes undone
Misanthropic in nature and hateful everyday
I should just remain alone for the rest of my days

A forgotten soul lost and far away from home
Reincarnated to twisted paths I'm damned to roam
Ignorance is bliss, so my knowings are a curse
Nothing gets better, it just gets worse and worse

I worship the God of Death, decay is all I praise
Life is but a labyrinth, a masochistic maze
Gods and man are but the same, separation is illusion
We embody the likeness of deities, the flesh causes confusion
Narcissism is the bane of all who wish to be
The point of life is to encompass all reality
We descended from higher planes to worship duality
When we see all meets as one, we know balance is no key
We transcend once we are locked in true neutrality
Meditation is the practice of negating identity
All that you believe, and all you wish to be-
Is but a lie we must accept, and move on finally...
Until we rest in peace
