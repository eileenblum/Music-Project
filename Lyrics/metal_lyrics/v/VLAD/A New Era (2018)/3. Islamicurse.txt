For too long you people have been worshiping a lie
Because of your twisted views, thousands more will die
How much innocence can you soil in your God's name?
For centuries now, your religion has been one to blame-
For rape, torture, an murder; genocide of whole populations
For abductions and slaughter; an enemy to all nations
You've been waging war for far too long, you make a living Hell
Your cherished messiah Muhammad is the true infidel

Your Holy War is nothing but an over-zealous scheme
Only brainwashed morons would live to fulfill this dream
Wherever you slither, you snakes bring with you deceit
Your laws are unreal, it will lead to your defeat

I swear to God...

You will face the wrath of your own hypocritical minds
Continue your ways of evil, and say goodbye to your kind
Even the Devil himself is cursing all of your names,
You poor excuses for life put all humanity to shame
You are the spoiled fruits in the Garden of the Gods
A righteous deity would never support your Jihad

You place yourselves in shackles so you appear oppressed
I have no sympathy for fools who work to cause unrest
You confuse the masses with your backwards rhetoric
The more you work to spread your filth, the more you make me sick
You'd all be skewered on spikes if I were to have my way
A message sent to your God to make you all go away
Your unholy reign of terror impaled underneath our sky
If I had you alone, you would be begging to die
Some memories will never go away, nor does time heal all wounds
You best know that I remember, I'm coming after you
