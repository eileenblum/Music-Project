As above, so below
Molten fire, blackened blood
So in Heaven, so in Hell
On this Earth and within

As one door opens, so another closes
I have been alive since before your Moses
In the name of Christ, his followers still mourn
As your God dies, so another is born
Revelations through the shedding of blood
Atonement embraced through oncoming floods
A divine cleansing in a tempest of fire
To Hell with messiahs, they are divine liars

Waging endless wars so your God be pleased
You worship only that which is long deceased
As the bodies pile up, you're infected with disease
A plague upon those who brought you to your knees
Immortal truth, a scavenger of life
Trading bodies to avoid the reaper's scythe
Eternal, is our heathen's rite
Against all gods, we heretics rise
Remains of a desecrated body, broken and splattered
The national flag of a scab, torn and scattered
Ingest the remains of your rotten friends,
This Jihad in will never end
Pray to God, make your amends

Slice the skin, break the bone, suck the marrow and drink the blood
Sever the flesh, hack through the skull, take the brain, absorb it all
Rape the spirit, cleanse the mind, reap the conscious, feed on the blind
Take the light, face the dark, you chose the famous beast's mark

Slice the skin, break the bone, suck the marrow and drink the blood
Sever the flesh, hack through the skull, take the brain, absorb it all
