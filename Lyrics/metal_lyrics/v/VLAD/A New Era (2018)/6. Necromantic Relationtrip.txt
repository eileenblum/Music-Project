Romance is dead since we murdered it
We have lost the fight, but we just won't quit
We beat a dead horse into a bloody mess
I'm a dog in a suit, you're a bitch in a dress
We pretend we're totally fine
Meanwhile we ignore all of the signs
That these puzzle pieces won't fit;
We force them together with our bullshit

A kingdom built on sand will eventually sink,
Our foundation is weak, but we still want to think
That our lies will suffice at the end of the day,
But we loathe the silence when there's nothing left to say
All humanity has ever shown
Is that they all detest being alone,
So they cling to the fabric of undying lies
When it starts to fray, they simply close their eyes

Patience is a virtue, but it has been long lost
Our intolerance, an emotional holocaust
We play the victim and enjoy to complain
Perhaps in truth, we are in love with our own pain
Masochistic obsession with bleeding out,
Sadistic in fueling each other's doubt
Testing each other's will out of spite
We always find a reason to start a fight
We want to be happy, but will never work for it
We are engulfed by a sense of false entitlement
We feel as though we deserve it all,
The kingdom we've made is doomed to fall

We would rather be comparing our scars
Than sitting together observing the stars
Nothing on this planet makes me more sick
Than the thought of a recycled heart made of plastic
How many past lovers to this day still haunt you?
When you say you're faithful, is that really true?
The ship's run aground, we've lost our direction
Since we're about to collapse, we thrive on the tension

I think that we need to begin to validate
Each other's bliss instead of hate
Nothing will improve with this tired scheme,
There will be no hope of achieving the dream
To find comfort in another soul,
When we refuse to pay the toll
There's a cost to everything in reality,
Even love it's self isn't free
