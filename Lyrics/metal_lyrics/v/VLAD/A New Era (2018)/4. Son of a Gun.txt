I am not a killer, I'm a weapon to be used
I am left with nothing, I have nothing left to lose
No amount of love can subdue the hate I feel
I've lost my religion, nothing else is real
I sold my soul long ago, I am mortal damned forever
I'm a dead man walking, I should have been killed ten times over
No one seems alive, only uncooked meat on bone;
They all seem so hollow, their empty ways have set the tone
I wish they understood how I see them all as food...
Ever craving the taste of still warm blood and skin,
A passing of millennia has not cleansed me of this sin
Cannibalistic curse, an animal that knows how to stand
Born again as a beast incarnate into flesh of man
I'm a one man army, enemy to every one
The first born of the Devil, a true son of a gun
I travel as a shadow, but am heard with violent sound
A flesh bound sovereign nation, everywhere's a battleground
All locations meet as one, they are massive graves
Buried over a thousand dead, they will never be saved
There is no god to save you...
You must stop adoring the ways of the over-faithful moron
There are no messiahs, all of them are dead and gone
Only souls of warriors will win the war to survive
There's no escaping my ghost in the afterlife
My enemies all curse my name, I haunt them forever
A spiritual hunter with a message to deliver
The smell of their rotten bodies still lingers on my breath
Although I have a new name, I have not changed in death
