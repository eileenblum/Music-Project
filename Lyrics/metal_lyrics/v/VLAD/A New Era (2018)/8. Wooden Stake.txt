Mirrors shattered out of madness
Now bear a reflection of the abyss
An infinite void to absorb the light;
Once the soul sees it's self, it is has found true sight
Wave forms now made particle
Witness the post-physical
Vanity is now replaced
By the blackened reflection that's erased the face
A finite speck within the fractal
Insignificant in the grand scheme of it all
All time is abolished, all energy is stagnant,
Halted in space on a frozen planet
Infinity now unveiled before you,
A vision received of the ultimate truth
Endless horizons in a boundless sky;
Uncountable stars that were born to die
All the dimensions and vacuums of their black holes,
Alternate time lines seen through every soul
All at once, the chaos of existence;
And all without, known only through omniscience

Now just close your eyes, feel the end is nigh
Will to end your life, commit suicide
Bleed yourself dry and pray that you die
Now embrace your death, see you on the other side

Earthly actions are mundane,
Flesh is the source of all your pain
No more will you seek a sense of closure,
Now that you have been silenced forever

Now in league with the divine,
Your rotting body serves as your shrine
You've transcended to a another level;
A collective piece of God and the Devil
