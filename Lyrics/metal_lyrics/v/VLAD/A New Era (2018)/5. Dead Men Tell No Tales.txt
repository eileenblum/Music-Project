Pillage and plunder, tear them asunder
Give no quarter, drag them under
Leave no survivors to tell
The tale of the Devil sending them to Hell

Show no mercy, break their will
If they're alive, they are ours to kill
We'll see our blood lust fulfilled
If they're in your sights, then fire at will

With sharpened steel and loaded guns,
Their screams won't stop until we're done
They can't hide nor can they run,
Hunt them down, slaughter everyone

Run them through and break their bones
Their souls shall be claimed by Davy Jones
Never again will they sail to the shore,
Locked away forevermore...

Take until you can take no more
They started a battle, we win the war
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,
Now they have learned this dire truth

Drunk on the lives that we claim at sea
The most violent form of anarchy
We wage no wars, but we kill the bastards
We serve no gods, nor do we masters
Without government, we are warriors
What's mine is mine, and what's yours is yours
Every man for himself; no king lives today
That can take our freedom away

Set the colors high
Never shall we die
