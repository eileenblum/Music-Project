Beyond the walls of sleep
Portals to the deep

Incantations undivine, conjure the aeons dead
Blackened earth as seen through the madman Alhazred
Forces of the god nature demand a sacrifice
Neon lights and shadows shape-shift before your eyes
Ritualistic bloodshed, feed the vampyric force
Give up your own flesh and mind unto the demonic source
Night looming like a giant, it spreads it's blackened wings
The magicks of the ancient ghosts are dead but dreaming

Ia Akhkaru Ia
Ia Alla Xul
We Are The Lost Ones
From a Time Before this time
From a Land Beyond the Stars
From the Age When Gods Had Walked the Earth
Beneath the Seas of Nar Mattaru
Beneath the world lays sleeping
The God of Anger, Dead But Dreaming

I am The Ancient One
God of the Gods
I am The Lord of Darkness
Master of Magick
I am before all things
I am The Ancient of Days

I am The Ancient One
God of the Gods
I am The Lord of Darkness
Master of Magick
I am before all things
I am The Ancient of Days

Summon me before thee, make offerings in way of death
My soul shall descend unto you, as you release the mortal's breath
Of knowledge and power, I am wisdom formless from out of space
Beyond the finite universe I gift the chosen of your race
Relinquish your human shape and shadows shall become your form
The light of the Sun shall not touch you in the silence of the storm
The eye of chaos watches and sees not of your suffering
You've been made my thrall and cursed by me in this conjuring
