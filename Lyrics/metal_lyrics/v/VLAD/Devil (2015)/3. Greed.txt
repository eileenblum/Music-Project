You have to realize reality
Materialize the physical
Manipulate the minds
Of people that own the objects you so seek

Ye shall find

You care not for life or it's wake
You only care about what's your's to take
You care not for the spirit
But only for what your body can touch

It all fades away into the abyss
It all fades away

Let go
Let it go

You're going to die anyway
