So blind with malice
You cannot see your self
With trust in no one
You walk alone for naught

Your teeth compress your face
Your eyes opened wide
Your blood is volatile
You're writhing over the mundane

Discontented with all
You're held to the highest standard

So empty
The titles you are given
So empty
Your strife is meaningless [2x]

Meaningless
