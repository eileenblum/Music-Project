Avert your gaze, you are not the chosen one

Jealous of everyone else
For being so much more content
When you do nothing
To satisfy your intent

You are too frail to even cherish
You are a passing phase, a facade
So miserable, you blame anything and anyone for it
Except for you!

Look in the mirror
Become your self
Do not envy others,
They're in Hell with you
