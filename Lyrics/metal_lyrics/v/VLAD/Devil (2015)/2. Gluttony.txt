I consume all I can
To fulfill being filled
Fill my hunger
Growling louder
I leave no scraps
I take and take
Until I can't

Starvation is alien
I devour worlds
Gorging my self with needlessness,
Emptiness, endlessness

I am hungry
I am hungry now

I am feeding my vacuity
I am feeding emptiness of being
I am feeding bottomless, gluttonous, ravenous [2x]

I alone will end the world
To satisfy my appetite
