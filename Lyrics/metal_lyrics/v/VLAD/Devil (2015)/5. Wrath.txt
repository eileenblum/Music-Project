I have no sympathy
For those who are different from me
You dare betray me,
I will end you world

I will kill all the stars in the sky
I will end all light from the sun
I will destroy this planet
And all life at the cost of one
Mistake
That's all it takes
One mistake
To end your world

So consumed with rage
I'm so consumed with hate

One mistake
That's all it takes
One mistake
To end your world

I'm so consumed with passion
I'll destroy anything in my way

Get out of my way
