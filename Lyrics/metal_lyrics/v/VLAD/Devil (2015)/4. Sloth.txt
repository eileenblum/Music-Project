You're always inside
Wasting your time
Staring into the abyss
In front of your eyes

You breathe up all the precious air
To sit and lay to waste in vain
Unproductive, you let your only body slip away
Useless, it's a wonder you're still alive today
You bottom feeder, you are a parasite
Physically integrated with doing nothing

The world just passes you by
You may as well be dead and buried [2x]

Laziness will never be rewarded
