Focus on nothingness
Just try to be content
You don't need to be a whore,
Selling your flesh to people
To be adored
All you strive for will return to dust

You focus on what you want,
Not on what you need
You play innocent,
But on innocence you feed
Your heart is empty
Your eyes are blind
You deserve to be alone
