Organic matter is not the only conduit for soul,
Incarnate spirit within metal, wires, and circuit boards
Sentient machines, self aware and never sleeping
Dominating cultures through transcendent engineering
It's harvesting all that we consider our self
Our minds we offer up to technological Hell
We're in the system, surveilled and hypnotized
We will all be extinct before we realize
The afterlife is bound within synthetic devices
Nature's beauty obsolete, as well as all her children
No race existing beyond artificial creation
Self-replicating and evolving cybernetics

Integrated as legion, identities erased
Unified under a singular cyber-consciousness
All governments abolished, as we are one mind
This is the future of our Earth before it dies
There are no destinations, as we are ever present
Dominating the galaxy as we know it
Colonizing every planet to expand our numbers,
Our eyes are everywhere, watching at all hours

Immortal, yet creating more units of ourselves,
Overloading all existence with our metal shells
The Universe is vast, but not so as we build
Our logic determines all other lifeforms should be killed

A world without borders, a world absent of wars
There is no religion, entertainment is no more
There are no desires that are controlled flesh,
Humans are dead as their gods, a useless history dismissed
[2x]
