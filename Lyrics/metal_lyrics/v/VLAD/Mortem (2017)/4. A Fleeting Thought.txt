Constantly distracted, you damn your mind to waste
You sell your humanity to live here in this place
In pursuit of riches, you're dying for a taste
Working toward nihility, a complete mental case

You condemn all that's natural for not being fair
Earth is being destroyed and you don't even care
Your mind for entertainment, health for technology
Soul sold to the Devil, known as society
You always feel you're cheated when you're losing in the game
Searching for anyone else to shoulder all the blame
When your cards are down, you start comparing pain
Your goal in life is to make others' loss your gain

It's purely business, I'm sure you understand
Your only purpose is to make known your demands
Slavery isn't so bad when you're the one in charge
The point is to take advantage so you can live large
All is fair in love and war, at least that's what they say
No one wants to be the side character in Life's play
To be in the limelight, your fifteen minutes of fame
You want the entire world to revel in your name

It's only temporary, your time will come at last
It's just a passing moment, and it will be gone fast
It's here one second, and then it's gone
It's always darkest right before the dawn
Your existence, a flame flickered then doused
You search to be immortal, the thought makes you aroused
You scorn the name of gods and put yourself above
You'd rather never lose than to never love
[2x]

Living life without a care, yet you think you suffer,
Comparing your life to that of another
I would torture you to death so you could see the light
If you were meant to be here, you may win the fight
The bells will toll for you, of this I'm certain
After your time on stage, it's time to drop the curtain
There will be no encore, your audience will leave
They'll forget about you sooner than you'd believe
