The black birds call your name with their broken song
The graveworms' stomachs have been hungry for too long
Your final home is found in the freshly moistened soil
Regardless of your plans, this is for what you toil
The reaper's scythe will never miss nor ever falter
Your body is an offering for Death's eternal altar
Do not deny the balance between life and death,
For one day all of us must suffer our last breath

Personally, your fear disgusts me and I find you weak
Only a selfish life would consider dying to be bleak
If you loved being alive, nothing would hold you back
You waste your loathing on the day you finally fade to black
Your ancestors have passed their tests, and that's why you are here
They did not die to leave you living life in fear
The Devil may care for your loss, so strengthen your sense of self,
For if you appreciate nothing, you'll find your self in Hell!

The soul is underneath, living regardless belief
The truth is steadfast, your pulse was never meant to last
Even if you feel alone, for all our lives we must atone
Flesh is only borrowed, let go of Earthly sorrows
Nature will make beauty out of rotting blood, shit, and pus
As the maggots chew your bones, you will join all of us
Your search for eternal life was a wasted journey spent
After you have crossed over, there's no reason to lament

Six feet underneath, the fact you rejected to believe
