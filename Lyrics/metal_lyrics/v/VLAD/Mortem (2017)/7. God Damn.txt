Man-made prophecies in your head
From what your Holy Book has said
You live life by something you read
These are lies that you've been fed
Blind as to where you are being led
You show your faith through bloodshed,
Left in your wake, mountains of the dead
You see God in what they've bled

"Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission"
Your mind is infected with violent superstition
You believe I must be killed to be forgiven,
And converted after death without my permission

You seek forgiveness, for you are possessed
While you damn others, you want to be blessed
With the crucifix resting on your chest,
I see it as a sign that you are a pest

With each generation it just gets worse,
As if there is an ancient evil curse
Toward different philosophies, you are adverse
You truly think you understand the Universe
You believe that you've done your life's research,
Simply by reading the Bible in Church
"The weak and meek shall inherit the Earth"
Is that really what Mother Nature is worth?

Lies!
God damned lies!
