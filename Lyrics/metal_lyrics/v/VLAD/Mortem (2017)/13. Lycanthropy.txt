Release of violent hatred exerted physically
Upon the fleshy body of my enemy
Defying all their gods, I sacrifice for mine
Alive, yet tortured badly, you realize
There's no eternity, there is only now
You flood with memories as I rip out your bowels
The pain makes you reflect, a nostalgia
A portal opens as I inflect trauma
Now forsaken, you are asking, "Why is it me?"
The question of why you are here, now profusely bleeding
You feel your faith escape you as I pound your skull-
With a hammer, over and over, until you've had enough

Losing consciousness, you mumble to yourself
Reciting a prayer to save you from this hell
Your vision blurs, your cries now slurs, you feel your self slipping
Until I wake you with the pain of your skin being shredded
Amputating, lacerating, preparing to eat
I feel my hunger growing as you writhe and scream
The moon is full and bright as I extract your spine,
Holding it above my head, staring into your eyes

Lunacy
Brutality
Eaten by me
Lycanthropy
