Conjuring the afterthought of a dream long forgotten
Recollected fragments of a fantasy become real
Deja Vu experience of something that has never happened
Opening portals into that which can't be opened
Exposed, the secrets of something never known
Meaningless information now suddenly profound
Erupting chaos from that which was once nothing
Unholy birthing of that which shouldn't live...
Yet it does

Rise to the deepest of depths,
Scower the horizon of an infinite plane
Post-eternal fractals witnessing their deaths,
Even the gods will meet an apocalypse

Explore dimensions of self aware matter
Understanding nothing, yet comprised of the all
The stars in the sky will all be devoured
The void will consume, and make all new again

Worship of the false gods
Tornado of ancient souls
All that is dead and dreaming
Is dwelling in your subconscious mind,
Underneath it all
