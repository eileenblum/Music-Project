Through the eyes of the living dead, all is food and nothing else
Everything and everyone that moves is just there to ingest
Communication and company is by which the undead feed
They latch onto others to satisfy their needs

When they think you're intelligent, they want to steal your brain
You think they care for your heart, they just want to inflict pain
When you finally find them out, they latch onto someone else
Their identities are facades, they test if you can tell
Masters of the backward art, total hypocrisy
Adept in the evil eye, the scope through which they see
Emotions will quench their thirst, they lust for your pity
They'll take advantage of your soul, and drain your empathy

Pathetic are their egos, a trick they use to fool
Pretending to be weak and meek is their most profound tool
They seek out their prey based on the kindness of their heart
You may think they're human, they're a total breed apart
You may feel exhausted, as if you're falling ill
Manipulated to oblivion, the undead go for the kill
Once you have been bled dry, they will only find another
They put on a different mask so they aren't discovered

Vampire!
