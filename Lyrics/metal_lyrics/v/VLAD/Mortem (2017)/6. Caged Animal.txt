I feel like a caged animal, I'm sick of it all
Man made prison keeping me still, it gives me the urge to kill
Backed into a corner, neglected by my owner
These chains that are holding me restrain my dreams of being free

The longer I am kept here, instincts start taking over
Bestial consciousness, humanity dismissed
The carnal urges I feel to make you my next meal,
They're driving me insane, it's gotten to my brain

Captive and domesticated, I become a weapon
Tooth and nail and skin and bone, all I need to hold my own
Welcome to the concrete jungle, you are in my lair
Down and dirty in my filth, here we don't fight fair
It's me and you, it's life or death
You made it this way
One on none, you are nothing
You are just my prey

There's a stirring in my loins and a fire in my head
It's survival of the fittest, you're as good as dead
I have become a monster, my rationale deceased
Trapped in Babylon, I've become a beast
[2x]
