Malformation in majority, total loss of self authority
Surveillance has us scrutinized, all but privacy privatized
Hypnotized by the perception that we're free from deception
As the masses multiply vestigial becomes the third eye

Spiritual crisis masked by medication
Closer we move toward our extinction
Mind control across entire nations
Brain damaged beyond all operation

In their garden of Eden we are all weeds,
Unless we produce the fruits on which they feed
No matter how beautifully we will grow,
We'll be uprooted by the ruling foe

It's a campaign for control and terror
Keep the masses as unknowing as ever
Program the people to work solely for the hive
This is the process by which slavery survives
Faced with threats of torture or death if we revolt
Keep our heads down and just do what we're told
If we question the righteousness of our master,
They will leave our lives in total disaster

A lifestyle corrupted by lies from evil minds
A plan to make a slave race out of human kind
Our worth defined by how much we sacrifice
To make true the dreams of a madman's paradise
Repetition makes a man exactly what he does,
Simplicity used as a weapon against all of us
Closing off our minds to the possibilities
Handing over our freedom to a false society
