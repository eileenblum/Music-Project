Maniacal messiah, the shepherd of doom
Open up your hands and let them feed from your wounds
Your pulse will strengthen the hungry and weak of will,
Permit them devour you, let yourself be killed
This suicide is not selfish,
Those who prey upon your body shall be nourished
As is the way of life, we feed on the dead
Your life continues through the ones you fed

Sacred is the sacrifice
Only the purest blood will suffice
It is the ultimate vice
May you forgive the apostles' avarice?
Allow them to dine on the scarlet fruit
Affirm your will to be absolute
If your followers refuse,
It's only entrance into Heaven they will lose

Resurrection of the dead,
From allowing them to lick what you've bled
Now they shall understand what you've said,
Now that your blood pulses through their heads
Baptized in your life's essence
To your soul, they'll owe penance
Excuse the people of their sins
Crowned the bloody, mangled prince
[2x]
