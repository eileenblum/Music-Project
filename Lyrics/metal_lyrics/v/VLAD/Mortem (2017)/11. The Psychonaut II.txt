Constant and intrinsic, the noise it emanates
It influences my sleep, and haunts me in my wake
Within this chaos, I try to meditate
I take the broken pieces and attempt to create-
Something out of nothing, a true miracle
Resurrect the fragments of a lifetime forgotten
To remember death before there was life,
And to know my lives before I had died

A hypnotic offering in form of frequency,
A gift from the maker to allow me to be
Resonating in the mass and energy of space,
Beyond all the galaxies, beyond the human race
Archaic knowledge simplified, a torch in my hands
All my organs meaningless as I depart from them
Astral exploration and construction of a temple
Summoning the archaic ones to be their disciple

I become a Christ as I elevate my soul
Far away from the material of your world
My soul is a vessel for the gods themselves
My hands may not be idle, I am steadfast
I put my faith in consciousness of that which is not I,
Everything is legion, everything is I
