Bleed for me...
I beseech you to obliterate yourself
I would ask the same of anyone else
Humanity is a malignant growing cancer
Total genocide is the only valid answer
There are so many ways for humans to die
It's easier than you think, give it a try
You'd be doing the entire world a favor,
So much so that you'll be considered a savior

Crucified, forced to die
To the sky, you direct your eyes
Agonized, traumatized
Screaming, "Oh God, why have you forsaken me?"

Nowhere is the safest place
As long as there's a human race
Bloody disgusting, putrid and vile
Kill yourself, it'll be worthwhile
Do you have faith in the afterlife?
Slice your throat open with a knife
Let the blood flow from your wound
This will all be over soon
[2x]

You will die for a cause, it will not be in vain
If we exit from this life, we will end the global pain
Holocaust on a massive scale, humanity erased
This world will be beautiful without any human face
We are a disease, an obsolete race
We deserve to be wiped out without a trace
End your miserable life, and take it with haste
Everything would be better if we never touched this place
