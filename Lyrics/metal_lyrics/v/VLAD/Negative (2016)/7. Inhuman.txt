When I was just a kid in school,
I had constant painful migraines
The kids made fun of me, so I was alone
I sat by myself and drew images of death

The staff and the students all hated me,
And I never did anything
This continued into high school
As my migraines began to wear off

They called me ugly, among other things
Some even screamed at my presence
I was called a vampire,
Apparently I was a monster

I never understood why I was treated this way,
And I am still confused to this very day
I feel so separate from humanity,
I'm starting to think that they were right all along

Did they sense I'm not one of them,
Before I even knew it myself?
It's taken me until I became an adult
To feel that I am indeed

Inhuman [3x]

Humanity is disgusting to me,
Everybody is the same
Egotistical, dramatic, and cruel
A herd of morons that just make noises and drool

If you feel the same as I,
I'm truly sorry for your loss
I wish I could take the both of us
And transport us somewhere else entirely
[2x]

Inhuman [2x]
