My mind is clutching at the fringes
I am breaking off the hinges
Insanity abducts what I see
My anger is torturing me

My depression is ever growing
My mind's expansion, ever slowing
I'm dying within myself,
Though I refuse to receive any help

I'm living in my own grave
My soul, my thoughts will not save
Death wants to get me alone
I feel it deep inside my bones

Sometimes I feel I want to cry
Because of this supposed life
Society is ever a lie
The only way out is to die

I feel the Devil's unblinking eyes
I am being judged and scrutinized
Picking me apart into pieces
Shredding my existence into ribbons
[2x]
