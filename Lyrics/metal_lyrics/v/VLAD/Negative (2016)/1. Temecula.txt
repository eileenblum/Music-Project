The most depressing place that I've ever known
Is the place that for almost twenty years I've called home
I've done everything I can to get away
And the older I get, I hate it more everyday

I take long walks outside at night
Underneath our glorious sky
With the moon and the stars in my eyes
Praying to be saved from this place I despise

I walk through the darkness alone
I never see another living soul
I ask out loud if I'm the only one
Who's even trying to be alive anymore

The only humans that I see
Are driving in cars or staring at screens
Staying inside their boxes or asleep
Is it really only me?

I have no brothers, no sisters, and no friends
I don't even have a pet
I would gladly end my life
If I wasn't my own best fucking friend

It's just me in a world of enemies
I'm alone in my wake, and they're asleep
I have absolutely no one to tell
How it feels to be trapped in this cold, concrete hell
