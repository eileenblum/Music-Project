You say that you love me,
You teach me that you hate me
I said that I only trust you,
You taught me that I don't
You said you understand,
You showed me that you can't
When I told you that you have my heart,
I didn't mean for you to rip it from my chest

I loathe the population of people,
Yet I keep letting them inside
You told me that I am welcome,
Yet I was treated as though I were unwanted
I never mean to intrude,
Yet it's all I seem to do
I wish I could go back in time through space
And be reborn within the archaic human race

Everything is ugly here
I am filled with hate and fear
All I wanted was to love,
My inner child was murdered

I want to leave this place,
But yet I hold a wretched hope
Maybe one day I will be at peace
I am pessimistic now, to say the least

I try not to blame anyone,
But somehow I know it was you
You took my innocence,
And used it as soulfood
