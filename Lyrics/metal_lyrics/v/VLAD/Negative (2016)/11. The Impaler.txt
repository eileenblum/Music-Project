They say that which doesn't kill you only serves to make you stronger,
I should torture you until you can't take it any longer
The people have stated that sticks and stones can break their bones,
But if words will never hurt you, I will stick with the stones

Why can't you understand that I'm trying to make you better?
I'm trying to get this improvement thing down to the letter
They say from a single flame a thousand candles can be lit,
Will you become enlightened if I push you in a firepit?

I have a valid point for all of you to sit and think on,
But if I impaled you, your potential to think would be gone
It's been famously said that you are what you eat,
If I eat flesh from your bones, does that make me human meat?

They say that we as people should learn to let go of the past,
If I beat you viciously, I bet those memories will last
They also say that we should learn to forgive and forget,
But if I amputated you, you'd hold a grudge I would bet

They say that everyone needs at least a single friend,
What if I decided to stab you in the back in the end?
Do you want to be like the Christ and turn the other cheek,
As I punch you in the head until your brains start to leak?

They say that all is forgiven in the eyes of the Lord,
I wonder if that is true if I run you through with a sword
They say that all wounds will be healed with time,
But what if I pulverized you until you were bloody human slime?

If I forced you to go through something unpleasant,
Would you think the past is in the past, and that you should live in the present?
They say there's no such thing as a dumb question,
But if I asked you if you wanted to die, would you think for a second?

I have a valid point for all of you to sit and think on,
But if I impaled you, your potential to think would be gone
It's been famously said that you are what you eat,
If I eat flesh from your bones, does that make me human meat?
