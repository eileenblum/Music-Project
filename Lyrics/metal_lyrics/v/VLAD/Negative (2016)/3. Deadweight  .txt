I have tried to be there for my friends
Who have betrayed me in the end
As I grew up, I began to realize
That I owe nothing to anyone

Most people I've met are just lies
A vacuum of a person with nothing inside
Always needing or wanting something else
I just wish they were content

Frying their brains with several different drugs,
Or too sober and conceited to fucking stand
Ignorant and unconscious by their own conscious choice,
Too weak to handle anything themselves

I cannot carry all of you on my back,
Don't blame me for being tired as Hell
I cannot drag you up from the pit you are in
When you don't even help me help yourself

Spiritual deadweight
Emotional vampire
It's as if you don't even care
It seems as if you never have

Stop dragging people down with you
That's not what real friends are supposed to do
You think that you're the only one in pain?
And I thought I was the one that was insane
