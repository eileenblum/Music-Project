The catch 22's of living today
Make no sense to me, it seems like a mistake
How we slave and slave to get paid
To earn the things we should have anyway

I have to get a job so I can have a car
I have to get a car so I can have a job
I have to eat to work, I have to work to eat
I'm taxed from my paycheck, and to buy what I need

I'm taxed to live, and I'm taxed to sleep
It's illegal for me to sleep in the streets
I can't be homeless without dealing with police
It makes me wish that I was deceased

How can I do this by myself?
I don't want to rely on anyone else
How can I afford the education for a job
When my job doesn't pay me enough to start?

Many have preached that this system is corrupt,
But apparently their words are not enough
Where is the change we've been promised for years?
I wish I could pay my dues with my blood and tears
[2x]

Go to school, get a job
[4x]
