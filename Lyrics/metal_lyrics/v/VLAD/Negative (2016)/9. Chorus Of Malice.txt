Where you see city lights, there used to be trees
Where you see buildings, there used to be beings
Where you see stores, there used to be farms
Where you see cars, there used to be animals

Look at what this place has become
A place of despair, a world undone
Depression and anger have become a disease
We medicate our selves to forget what our world used to be

I'm always disgusted with what I see
It gives me crippling anxiety
I refuse to complain, or to medicate
If I did I would be feeding exactly what I hate

Human beings used to be strong
We actually used to belong
Now we seek belonging in all of the wrong places
We cover up our guilts, frustrations, and disgraces.

All of this is wrong
Global misery, we prolong
That's I wrote this song
If you know the words, then sing along

We all should be fucking killed
Our bodies piled up in a land-fill
We are garbage that needs to be thrown away
Erase the human world and it's shades of grey
[2x]
