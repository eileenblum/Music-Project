How dare you call me negative
When you're trying to get a reaction out of me?
Just because I simply don't agree
With your false sense of positivity

Do you even remember how to feel
Anything other than what you want to feel?
I will never take any advice
From someone who ignores all of the problems in their life

Just what the Hell did you expect-
For every single person to give you respect?
You feel so entitled to happiness
I know you're miserable, you slimy piece of shit

Don't wriggle away from what's inside
Just because it's not rainbows and fairies in your life
You erase memories of your past away from your mind,
So you haven't learned any lesson, behind a mask you hide

Your happy thoughts just drag me down
You think you're enlightened, but I see you as a clown
It's like I'm doing all the thinking and all the feeling for you
You're just a smiling zombie telling me what to do
