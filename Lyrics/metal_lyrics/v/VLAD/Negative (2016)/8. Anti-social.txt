I'm so sick and tired of hearing you
So much that I don't know what to do
I don't think you're handsome, pretty, or smart
I could find your personality cheap at the mini-mart

You think you're clever, funny, and kind
People like you make people like me lose our minds
I hate who you are, what you believe in, and stand what for
Being forced to be around you at any time is a chore

Everything you do, and everything you say
Makes me contemplate suicide every day
You do things so backwards, I don't even know where to start
I wish that God would just decide to rip you apart

Because you're human, I find your existence crude
Can anyone blame for looking at you as food?
You're human cattle, you're sheep in a flock
The only difference is that you walk on two legs and you talk

Everything you do, and everything you say
Makes me contemplate suicide every day
You do things so backwards, I don't even know where to start
I wish that God would just decide to rip you apart

Because you're human, I find your existence crude
Can anyone blame for looking at you as food?
You're human cattle, you're sheep in a flock
The only difference is that you walk on two legs and you talk

Anti-social [16x]
