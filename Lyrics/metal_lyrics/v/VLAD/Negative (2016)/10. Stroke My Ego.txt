I am perfect, and you certainly are not
Look at all of the natural gifts and talents that I've got
I want you to notice me, how could you have not before?
You should worship my existence, get your knees down on the floor

You should start praying to me because I am your god
Bring me offerings you sniveling, pathetic sod
Everything I do is only glorious and great
I'm so wonderful, and gorgeous, and impossible to hate

Take a look in the mirror, and tell me what you see...
But only if you say that you are uglier than me!
All of the actions in your life should be within my favor
You must bask in my presence, and my beauty you must savor

Every single person's world should revolve around me
From now on, my face is the only face that you should see
I am the obvious ruler of all society,
I have the divine right to do whatever it is I please

I think you look rather dashing wearing a dog leash
Be grateful that you're my pet, you're serving your master at least
Roll over and play fetch, and you will make me pleased
It's only me that you should be attempting to appease

Give up all of your hopes, and all your goals, and all your dreams
Your purpose is to obey me, no matter how it seems
The only reason you were born is to be my grateful slave
Say please and thank you and remember to put that smile on your face

Please tell me what you think of me
Be sure to say it honestly
But if I feel it's insulting,
I'll make sure that you're left bleeding
Spit it out now, don't be shy
Am I the apple of your eye?
Of course I am, why wouldn't I be?
If I'm not, I'll lock you up, and I'll throw away the key!
