There are eyes watching everywhere,
Invisibly day and night
I'm standing on corpses of native blood,
I feel their anger and sadness
I want to exact revenge for them,
Though I know I don't have the right
I see blood dripping everywhere,
And everyone seems to think it's fine

In the lands of America,
Millions of people were killed
Women, children, and warriors
Desecrated in vain
I want to decapitate everyone I see,
Because you aren't using your minds
The land is bare and so are your thoughts
You ignore the genocide

I feel that I have lost my mind,
If not, then I am going to
I feel insanity coming,
I think it's already here
I feel like an alien species,
At least that I am not human
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the bars
In a demented, human zoo

How could you ignore what has happened to these people?
Is it that you were not educated, or that you do not care?
I feel like the only one who sees it for what it is,
Aside from the people who are the true victims of it
Shaman men now laid to waist, and searching for a purpose
Left with almost nothing in their own apocalypse
They actually appreciated the lands that they were given,
It was a divine gift to them, and all of you just waste it
This is a large reason why I claim to hate all humans
I wish I could reverse time, and spend my life attempting fix this
This is why I have written songs about a revolution
We need to figure out a righteous resolution
