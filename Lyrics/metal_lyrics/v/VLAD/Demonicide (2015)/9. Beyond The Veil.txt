You fear what you can't see
Shrouded knowledge in secrecy
All that is isn't evident
Seekers cast their eyes on the blind

This is the plane of sacred knowledge
Where all you seek is written in stone
Honesty incarnate into language
Interpretation of transcendence

Beyond earthly light
Invisible to the eye
Felt with the heart
Known in the mind

This world never ends
We are eternal
Infinite is our home
Time is our guide

Through time and space
All meets here
In this silent vacuum
All will be still

All music and lyrics written, recorded, and produced by Anthony House
