I step into the light
Abandoning my plight
Awakening inside
with no reason to hide
Life is changing through me
Blood flows through my veins
I am fooled by all I see
All is without names

Chaotic
Demonic
Atomic
Microscopic

Pulled in by the gravity of dimensional wormholes
Entering the vertex, my being unravels
Information stagnated, undifferentiated
I exist yet I am disintegrated
