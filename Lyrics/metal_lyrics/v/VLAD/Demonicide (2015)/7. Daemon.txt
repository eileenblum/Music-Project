Look down upon me
and surpass my glory
I kneel before you
as I fall from grace
I am your servant
My will bends to yours
This dominion is yours to rule
I resign my free will to you

I ripped off my wings
To remain here grounded
Neutral
I serve the light and the dark
Judgement you pass upon me
O righteous deity
I am your slave
I am but a tool
to serve your purpose
