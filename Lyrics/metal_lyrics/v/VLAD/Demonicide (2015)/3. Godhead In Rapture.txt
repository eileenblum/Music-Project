Underneath the stars
The sky beckons me
To enter my dreams
Free fall into space
Integrate with motion
Everflowing life
Stand where time is frozen
Where all is at one
Burning like a fire
Defying the surroundings
Destruction in it's nature
Alive and breathing
Flowing like water over sands of time
There is no stopping the storm rages on

I am one with divinity
Connected to highest self
Non-returning Godhead
All meets within me
