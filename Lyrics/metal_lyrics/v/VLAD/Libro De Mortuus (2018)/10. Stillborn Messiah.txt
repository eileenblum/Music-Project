God is created without the light;
An immaculately spawning omniverse
The light that blinds reflects the shade
Upon our tiny universe...
This star you see that eats the sky;
A tool however useful should not control your mind
Desensitized to the spiral and gravity
Depicting yourself as a story worth reading?
So insignificant and crumbling to waste,
You fear the primal fire burning in dark space
The vastness of the mind is only dagger deep,
Memories of past lives are only yours to keep
Forever may you sleep, I pray you find your peace
With or without me, I'm descending to the dream
Beyond the walls of sleep, I can no longer hide;
I've been dead for so long, why am I still alive?
We're living off of blood money...
Collective vampire uprising!
War keeping violence from invading,
Then violent civilians start engaging!
It enslaves and dictates the nation
Attacking from unknown directions:
Hypocritical eradication
Manipulation intoxication

Ia Satanas! Ia Nergal!
Ia Azagthoth, remember!
Ia Enki, Ia Anu, Ia Absu!
Devour
Master of all, void of desire
Blood for the gods, no human master
Anti-spiritual anarchism:
Become nothing with no one.
