To refer to me as an 'old soul', is negative:
An angel fallen over and over and forced to relive
Every waking moment of a nightmare bound in skin;
Doomed to repeat the cycles of life due to ungodly sin!
Bury me, give birth to me, marry me once more;
Torture me and betray me, cheat me like a whore!
Don't you understand that we've done this all before?
We eat, we fuck, we kill, we sleep, take a shit and get bored!

What's more evil than killing for fun?
Leaving human corpses to rot out in the sun...
Although none of these men were innocent,
How many lives is it now that I've spent?
Every time I've killed, I've only killed myself
All souls entwined as legion, I'm alone in Hell

God dwells in isolation because there's nothing else;
Religion gets them thinking, but it's war that sells!
It has been this way since the beginning of man,
We've always been developing more efficient plans
To annihilate the enemy no matter what the cost;
I care not for you humans, it's humanity I've lost
There are no 'new souls', I am not unique,
Rebirth takes it's tolls, mundane and oblique
Just a thread connects me to my severed head,
Join me here, in ashes and dust upon my funeral bed
With skeletal arms, and black wings spread with grace,
You will feel my soul in all it's dark embrace

Suffer all my maggots, my flies, and my worms,
And past my stinking hide, you may feel some warmth
