It's been several weeks now, it doesn't feel that long
I recall it like yesterday as I write this song
The cosmic translucent horrors that we both were a witness
Destroyed all comfort we knew, and now you're gone to the abyss...
I can't believe that I used to think I knew
Anything at all, I'm am just confused!
I realize now more than ever in my life
The everything that's chaos is beyond my simple mind!

The riddles to the omniverse, I care for no more...
The tides of knowledge keep sweeping me back to the shore
I just crave the darkness, no more of this wretched light;
It's burning me and blinding, making me lose my sight!
Now the emptiness is commanding my mind;
I understand now I am not of the 'mortal' kind.
The lives that I've taken are only mine to keep
The flashbacks come in waves, I cannot eat or asleep
It takes so much for me to try to wear a mask,
If I look like I've seen a ghost, please don't ask...
My soul will never rest in peace, I just want to be released!

I am the ancient one
No man may seek my resting place
I receive the sun by night and the moon by day
I am before Absu, I am before Nar Marattu
I am before Anu, I am before Kia
No evil in the world or under it,
Over the world or inside it
May seize here!
