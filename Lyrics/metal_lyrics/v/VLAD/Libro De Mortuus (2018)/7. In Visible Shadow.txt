Execute the rapists, make sure they are dead;
If you have to, put another bullet in their heads!
This wretched human hunger being displaced,
Makes me want to show them their collective demon's face!
I want to savage them as brutal as they've savaged,
I want to smell their flesh burning for all their sacrilege
Deflowered over and over again,
She just wanted her pain to end...
Her breath died in a final sigh
Crucified and left to die

This reality is too small...
I want to throw away you all
You people are a fucking cancer
Annihilation is the only answer!
You gorge yourself to bloatation
On other's pain and exploitation
You seek selfish sensation
With grotesque infatuation
I'm choking on your toxic breath;
"Suffocating in plastic"...
The Utopia you all worship
Condones rape, murder, and slave ownership
You have no light, nor peace; you are not free

Ia Anu! Ia Enlil! Ia Enki!
I summon thee!
Cease to be the sleeper,
Cease to be unwaking
Rise up from the Old Abyss of Nar Marratu!
In Nomine De Mortuus
I call thee, here before me
In visible shadow
Arise! Arise!

That which hides in plain sight,
Ye who are gods by right;
I call thee, here before me
In visible shadow
