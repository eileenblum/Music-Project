All beings innocent will someday be defiled,
All beauty will decompose, become rancid and vile!
All love is bled out from the hearts by wounds with opened veins,
All knowledge will be secreted away within their dead brains...
Repetitious vicious cycles, undeserving deaths
Are traded in for currency; what's the cost of your breath?
It's being strangled until your lungs can draw in breath no more,
Undergoing torture, and rape if they get bored...
Arson, abduction, and murder
Herding the cattle to slaughter
Dissection, bodily amputation
Beating, maiming, mutilation
The oldest business in the book;
Taking your life from you
The above you may have mistook,
I'm not the one who will do this to you...
Someone else is watching you,
Following and stalking you,
Planning your own death for you;
What is it that you will do?

All of your fears, your paranoid delusions
Will come true in an instant, was it a life well spent?

All of your fears, your paranoid delusions
Will come true in an instant, was it a life well spent?

...Or did you live it vicariously?
