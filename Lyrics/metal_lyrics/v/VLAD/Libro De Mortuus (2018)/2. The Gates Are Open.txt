I can't believe it's true, I can't believe you're dead
It's a funny little game that they're playing with my head
They want me to go mad, they want me for food
Now that you are gone I don't know what to do!
I'm just trying to survive only for right now-
To see if I can figure all of this out somehow
My anxiety will not let me meditate,
Neither will my anger, my sadness, or hate!
Ever since you've died, I've been a fucking mess
This emptiness inside I can't begin to express...

Mer Sidi!
Mer Kurra!
Mer Urulu!
Mer Martu!

Zi Dingir Anna Kanpa!
Zi Dingir Kia Kanpa!

Utuk Xul, Ta Ardata!
Kutulu, Ta Attalakla!
Azag-Thoth, Ta Kalla!
Ia Anu! Ia Enlil! Ia Enki!

Zabao!

Remember!
