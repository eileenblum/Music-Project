I remember all those nights spent holding you,
Watching all the ghosts moving in the room
Me saving you from being so stressed...
You saved me, and made me feel blessed
This Wretched Book then took our sons,
Over and over, it wasn't enough!
Then we sought to destroy the tome,
We buried that one page, then we went home
I should have expressed my vision of distress
Before the book had forced you to be left
By me distraught, I was walking on the edge
Of my sanity; now I've been pushed of the ledge!

I'm hoping this book swallows me whole!
I want to be the one to pay the toll;
To end this curse, I hope it dies with me
I just want me, and you, and our kin to rest in peace...

Ia Kakos Theos!
Ia Kakos Daimon!
Utuk Xul, Barra!

The sky above me
The ground below me
Please spare us from this gravity
