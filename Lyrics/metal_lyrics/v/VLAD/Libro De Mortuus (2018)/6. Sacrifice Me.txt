Are you dead but dreaming? I miss you so much!
I just want to hear your voice, and to feel your touch...
I remember the feeling of your hands on my face,
And the sound of your laugh, and how your breath would taste
In your times of darkness, I was your light
I'd hold you for hours, but sometimes we'd fight...
I wish I could go back, and just listen to you;
And take back all my anger, I am a fool

The gods are dead but dreaming
Archaic voices singing
I hear the darkness calling
For my own death, I'm longing
I want to end this pain,
I want to end it all!
For me though, I am cursed
To dwell forever in the Netherverse...
My soul will never rest in peace,
Even after I'm deceased!
I just want to be released
I want this nightmare to be ceased!

Ia Enki! Ia Inanna!
Ave Satana! In Nomine De Nosrti!
I want the darkness to devour my soul,
I want nothing to be left,
Please consume it all!
