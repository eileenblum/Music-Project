We took the book and we drowned it in water
The ceremony under a full moon
We sat together and watched as it drifted,
And disintegrated, slowly it sank
We only saved one page, neither of us knew
That it would lead to them consuming you
I still have my book, and it calls to me
I turn to the book and read what I see...

Gigim Xul, Barra!
Maskim Xul, Barra!
Utuk Xul, Barra!

J------, our books were bound together...
Just as were our fates, we were meant to meet each other
The Black Book and it's gods knew this all too well,
I know this is just the start of a never ending Hell!

I found The Silver Key, I've lost my sanity
The eyeballs from the darkness all surrounding me
I feel the mass above me, Kthulhu calls
Why did we ever even begin those rites at all?

Gigim Xul, Barra!
Maskim Xul, Barra!
Utuk Xul, Barra!

Gigim Xul, Barra!
Maskim Xul, Barra!
Utuk Xul, Barra!

Zi Dingir Anna Kanpa!
Zi Dingir Kia Kanpa!

Gigim Xul, Barra!
Maskim Xul, Barra!
Utuk Xul, Barra!

Zi Dingir Anna Kanpa!
Zi Dingir Kia Kanpa!

Gigim Xul, Barra!
Maskim Xul, Barra!
Utuk Xul, Barra!
Remember!
