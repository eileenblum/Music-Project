It all started when you summoned Marduk
You never sealed the gate, he always haunted you
It all got worse when I summoned the fire,
And integrated with it in a hypnotic desire
I saw the birth of galaxies, millions of times
I flew through the universe at the speed of light
Then my vision came to a screeching halt,
As I felt this power to destroy it all
Then the giant god started haunting me,
That's when your tome made it's way to me
You knew it all too well, and saw it to be true...
I found a sole companion within you

There wasn't a single tear or drop of blood I've lost
That can amount to the devastating cost
Of your life being stripped away;
If I am the night, then you were my day.

Ia! Zi Azag!
Ia! Zi Azkak!
Ia! Kutulu Zi Kur! Ia!
