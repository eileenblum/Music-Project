Roaring hunger of the beast cracks the sky
It's eyes inflamed with desire
Flexing it's armoured wings
It exhales a putrid stench

Snarling in anticipation
Saliva dripping from it's mouth
The whole planet quakes
When it's stomach growls

Soaring through the sky
Shadowing the Earth
Consuming all it wants
Spreading fire in it's wake
