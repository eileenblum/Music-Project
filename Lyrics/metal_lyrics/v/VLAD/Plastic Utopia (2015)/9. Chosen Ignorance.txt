Gorgeously defiled
Maliciously reborn
Into every second
Lost with every breath

Darkened with intent
Radiantly cold
Restlessly judgemental
No life amounts to yours

Paranoid and anxious
Miserable and scared
Entrapped in chosen mistakes
Reclusive in your fear

Reaching for no answers
Blissful ignorance
Addicted to what kills you
You are suicidal
