The eyes of the icons are rotted and black
Gazing into nothing
Never to breathe or blink again
Abysmal awake nightmare

The living are unknowing
The living are condemned
The living will all suffer
The living know no end
Time isn't living, time isn't dead

Indulge into the pleasures of flesh
Intoxication
You will not have it when you are dead
And finally free
Forget the knowledge of everyone else
Think for yourself
Master and slave together in one
Obey only your self

Open you eyes
Open your mind
