I know it's selfish to say I didn't ask for this
This time of war, starvation, greed, and ignorance
I try to reach out toward someone
I want to know why we can't just be one

Too many people like to pretend that nothing's coming
Poisoned labrats
Here to keep the power running
Will you give up the servitude you call necessary,
Or will you support the evil as it's growing?

Unknowing worship of gods that had their names forgotten
They're smiling down on human culture's deconstruction
Can you figure out what this life is?
And if you have, can you define it?

Do you feel lost in this society?
Do you feel like a victim of a lobotomy?
And when you want to reach out toward someone
Does it seem like there's no one?

People with their brains off, but their phones on
Communicating to each other like aliens
Betraying their own intelligence
We'll have a future full of idiots

We have lost our place on this planet
We have lost our connection to it
