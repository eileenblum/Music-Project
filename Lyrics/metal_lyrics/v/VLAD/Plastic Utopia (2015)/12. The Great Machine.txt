Dying in your head as you rot in your seat
Wasting away, the cycle repeats
Lost and worthless by self defeat
The path to hell is a one way street

Fucking look around you
These walls weren't meant to be
You have been a victim
Of the great machine

Sweating blood for corporations
Signing off your rights
Forced to praise the government and stay within the lines

You have been led to believe that you cannot be free
You have been trained and brainwashed by your society
