All things are divine
Everything is one
Separation is illusion

We are disconnected

We are parasites
Feeding off the Earth
Building monoliths to cage
Hiding from the truth
Seeking out God everywhere except within

When our selfish desires outweigh our needs
We have lost ourselves to substance
Not to trust ourselves or anyone else
We have lost ourselves to chaos

Opening the heart to our dual nature
Reunites us to contentness
Coveting false idols and material possessions
Disconnects us all from infinity

Losing sanity trying to remain
Distracted from collective consciousness

All things are divine
Everything is one
Separation is illusion
