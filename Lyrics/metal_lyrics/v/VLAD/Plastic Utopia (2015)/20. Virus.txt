I refuse your ways of ignorance
I choose not to suffer for anyone
I reject the hypnotic brainwash
That we live with every single day

Evil men with power have no power over me
I banish their religion of deceit
I defy this mechanical society's ways
And their sickening addiction to pain

Technological manipulation
Controlling the population
Cultural deconstruction
Separation of a nation
