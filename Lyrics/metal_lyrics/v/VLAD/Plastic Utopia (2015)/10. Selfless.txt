Living just makes me want to die
Hopelessly searching for hope
Everything in my eyes are lies

Broken dreams compel me to go to sleep
My broken heart makes me forget most things
Cruelty embedded within me
Entombed in heinous honesty

I hate everyone
I fucking hate myself
I resent this way of life
I must find what's lost

Love and comfort are so distant from my spirit
My memories fatigue my mind and body
My mentalities are chains that bind my being
My survival seems like it is not for me

I'm insane
I'm alone
I'm depressed
I hate my self
