I try to disconnect from reality
In the middle of dualities
Balancing myself on this high wire
Above our culture of shit

I try not to look down
I stare toward the horizon
I keep moving toward something
Struggling to escape from nothing

I reach for the sky
Standing above the world
I am too far to fall
I rise above it all
