My hatred for humans is making me insane
I can't stand anyone they make me demented
Consuming and ignorant
What we are makes me sick

We are nature's bane
We are parasites
We are full of shit
We are egotists

We deserve to die
To save this planet
We are fucking up
To support ourselves

We are growing gods of greed

Festering and writhing feeding on ourselves
Constant search for entertainment,
Selfish evil pigs
Hellbent on our desires to fulfill our egos
Destroying the earth to create more suffering

We all need to support suicide
