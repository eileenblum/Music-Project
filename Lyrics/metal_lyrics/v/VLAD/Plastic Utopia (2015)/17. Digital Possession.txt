This generation
Is corrupted
By technology
You worship it

The media
Is a lie
Phenomenal
Distraction
From all that's real
To be lost
In dramatics
To satisfy your ego

You have all forgotten your place
Material possession is shit
You are not a part of it

Dead in you head, you are nothing
Without fucking electronics
You may as well kill yourself
Now
