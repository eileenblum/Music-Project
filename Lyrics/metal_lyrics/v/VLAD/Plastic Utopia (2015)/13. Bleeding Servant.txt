Living to continue life only to die
Working for some thing until there's nothing inside
Hoping to find the answers to life's great questions
Bleeding, rotting, twisted, mangled;
Our great future

Shackled servant
Bound by servant
Bleeding for them
To bleed for you

Forced to face the judgement
On uneven scales
Forced to sell our selves
To support this evil

The will of the people
The will of all evil
Given sacred life
Thy will be done
