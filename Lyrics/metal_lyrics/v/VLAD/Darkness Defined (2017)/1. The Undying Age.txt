Immaculate, illuminate divine
Omnipotent and omniscient, I'm sent
Infinite, immortal, and eternal
I will live always, though I shed my skin in cycles

Changing and evolving through dying
Continuing living to succeed in learning
To be born with wisdom again into this world
With faith and hope we breathe to fulfill our roles

There is nothingness to drag you down
Focus on the chaos that becomes you now
Energize your world and make this come to life
If you will to flourish, you achieve your strife
