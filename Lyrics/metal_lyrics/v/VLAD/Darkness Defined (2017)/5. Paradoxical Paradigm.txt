The promised land is at your feet
Life and death are but a dream
This planet gives you everything
To eat and sleep and live and breathe
Yet you think it's not enough,
You believe Heaven's a bluff
A constant search for someplace else,
Perhaps you seek entrance to Hell?

There is no cost for transcendence
It's wonders are within your hands
A tool given to us for free,
To help us know reality
Yet you feel it's not enough,
In this practice you don't trust
You'd rather satisfy your lust
Than be thankful for the gods' love

There is nothing beyond this plane,
This should not cause you disdain
If it does, look past your pain
This whole world is inside of your brain
[2x]

Think of anything at all
Imagination is the law
All exists within the mind
Paradoxical paradigm
[2x]
