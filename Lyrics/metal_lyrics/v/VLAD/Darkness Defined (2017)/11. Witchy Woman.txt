You lying bitch, you evil witch
You made me trust you
Under your spell you learned from Hell
I care nothing for you
You cheated death, now you're depressed
So you feed on me
You play your game, now keep my name
Far away from your lips, witchy woman

You sell out your identity because you have many others
Lies are your name, you worthless brat
You abuse your powers
I would burn you at the stake, but I'd want to do it again
I would butcher you with knives, but I'd want to do it again

I'd tear off all of your limbs and beat you to death with them
But I would want to hear forever your last dying breath
I'd rip off your skin and wear it, but I'd want you to see me do it
I'd take a hammer and smash your skull, but I'd want you alive to feel it

I would rip out your heart and eat it, and witness your face as you die
But nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
[4x]
