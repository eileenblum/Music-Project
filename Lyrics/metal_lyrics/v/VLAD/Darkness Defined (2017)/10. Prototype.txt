I possess a body, disguised as a mortal
Every time I die, I become ever stronger
Animating flesh, archaic sacred art
I am Leviathan, I am Belial
Lurking in the depths, and flying through the sky
I am soul eternal, I will never die
I conquer in the art of feasting off the dead
I am Lucifer, I am Satan

Human beings never were supposed to be worshipped
They are prototypes, new in their creation
Aeons have flown by, and you are still God's children
Everything you know of self is an illusion
You cannot reach me, I dream with the dead gods
Hidden in the shadows, you are being watched
All your monuments you constructed in vain,
If you do not praise them with my name!

You are no messiah, nor a deity
You are the creation of a higher consciousness than 'me'
You wish to be followed, but you have nowhere to lead
If I cared enough, I would make you bleed
I would fertilize the ground with your rotten blood
I would feed your flesh to the maggots you disgust
I would take your bones and kill your family with them,
To repeat the cycle forever again!

I would fertilize the ground with your rotten blood
I would feed your flesh to the maggots you disgust
I would take your bones and kill your family with them,
To repeat the cycle forever again!
[2x]

Praised be your master, you are a monster
A failed experiment by a genius architect
Your lives are just a trial, a testing period
To see if you are worthy, or better off dead

Prototype
