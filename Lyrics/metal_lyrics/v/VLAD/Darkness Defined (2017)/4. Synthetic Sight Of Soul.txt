The animal known as man
Is the pinnacle of hate
For all of the good in this world,
There must be balance
We even out the scales
With our evil actions
There must be another way
To live on this planet

With the gods watching our every step,
Spectating our every breath
We speculate their existence,
As they do ours
How dare we scrutinize
Those which created the skies
They who made the grounds we walk
We are mistaken

All dimensions meet as one
All gods become singular
Our world is so small
How can you call yourself a god?
