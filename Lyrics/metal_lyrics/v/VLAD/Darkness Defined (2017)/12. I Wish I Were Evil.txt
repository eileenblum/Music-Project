My bravery has led me to nothing
My chivalry has taken me nowhere
For all the times that I have been there,
No one reciprocated care
For all of the times I've been left waiting,
The wait has been for naught
Every time I'm given a lesson,
This is all I've ever been taught-

I wish I were evil
I wish I never even cared
I wish that this life was deleted
That I could vanish into thin air

I wish I were evil
I wish I never had loved
I wish there were Heaven above,
So I could never be involved

My restraint has left me empty handed
My control was only an illusion
My kindness has only made me suffer
Now I'd rather die alone than a lover
My attempts to live amongst you humans
Has only given me endless reasons
To abandon this world full of nothing,
Even if my inner child is screaming for something

I wish I were evil
I wish I never even cared
I wish that this life was deleted,
That I could vanish into thin air

I wish I were evil
I wish I never had loved
I wish there were Heaven above,
So that I could never be involved
