God is indifferent, an insane agent of chaos
You believe in order - the void is responsible
All that can't be explained must be phenomena
To the simplest of minds, science provides all answers
Constantly changing patterns,
Would you even notice the shrinking and expanding of universal matter?
Affecting your surroundings, the gravity of nothing
You would never notice this transmogrifying process
You are a part of chaos, paradox divine
You really do know nothing, acceptance is understanding
The omniverse is endless through all of it's dimensions
If you claim to know this, you must be a liar

Liar!

You may be a Christ, you may know one self
You may have transcended earthly knowledge
You underestimate with all of your wisdom,
The truest form of life; the primal essence of God
[2x]

Liar!
