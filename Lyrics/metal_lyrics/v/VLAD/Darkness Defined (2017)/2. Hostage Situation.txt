Thoughts are flowing out like blood from us
Strangers are draining us of our progress
They're alien and they're foreign to us
Yet we are feeding them with our lifeforce
Choosing a life that is not worth leading
Dragged down by the chains of mental slavery
If we're upset, then we're labeled crazy
Take this pill, it will fix everything

We're held hostage by our money
Forced to bow down to our enemies
Fighting a war against far too many
Losing all battles to hierarchy
The privileged and the chosen few
Only survive from what we do
Stealing our time from us legally
Our human souls, the new currency

We turn away from our own dreaming
Our inner children are tortured, screaming
Begging to escape, to be released
From the cages we've been forced in
Breaking down into anxiety
Depression and anger start controlling
Our personalities and identities
False perception of reality
