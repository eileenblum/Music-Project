I am the master of energy and matter
Higher dimensional, I encompass all mass
I am the gravitational pull of all worlds
All is held together purely by my word
This reality only exists in my mind
I am the creator, I am the destroyer
I giveth all gifts, and I taketh away
I create the night, I command the day

There is no triumph, there is no defeat
There is glory in torture, there is pain in victory
Progress is achieved only through my will
If I were to command it, all would be still

Death is no escape, only transformation
Life is never certain beyond my creation
Interaction with my vision in eradication is the sole communication of all sensation

My will is law, I am that I am
All existence abides only by my divine plan
[4x]
