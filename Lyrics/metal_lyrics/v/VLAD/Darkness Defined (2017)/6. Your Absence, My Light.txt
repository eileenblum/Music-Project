Jealousy incarnate
Wrapping tendrils around me
Sucking me into it's vortex
Their eyes wide open
Watching my moves,
They crawl on their bellies
Writhing for a fix like a junkie

Trying to steal my name,
Accept that which you don't have
Do not crave for wealth,
All the riches of this world are shit
Your hands left empty
You must feel so proud
All of your work was in vain

Triumph of vanity
Obsession of self
Narcissistic,
Your ego devours
[2x]

I have told you once before,
"Believe in the dark
It lurks beyond your sight"
Just as the truth escapes you,
Receptacle of lies
Synthetic stimuli
Your grounds are crumbling
Beneath your stubborn feet

Triumph of vanity
Obsession of self
Narcissistic,
Your ego devours
[2x]
