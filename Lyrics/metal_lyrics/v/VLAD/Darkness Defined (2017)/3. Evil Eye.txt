Sense of purpose falsified
Through the eyes of living lies
Discontented with your mind
They're just waiting for you to die
They'll pretend to be your friend
Then they will worm their way in
Getting underneath your skin
You only lose if you let them win

Drunk on their self righteousness
All but their selves are dismissed
They think that karma's just a myth
Until they sink down in the pit
Perceiving everything as flaws
Vomiting opinions from their jaws
You turn your back, they show their claws
They're praying to God that you fall

Evil eye
Evil I

If you asked, they'd gladly help
You dig your grave and bury yourself
They'd love you to burn in Hell
Insecure, inside their shell

Pseudo-living and dead inside
These egotistical people are blind
They have no life, so they want yours
To be extinguished, and buried in dirt
[2x]

Evil eye
Evil I
