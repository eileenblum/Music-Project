To be human is to know nothing
To be delusional and controlled
Fearful of life and death
Constantly uncertain
Bleeding for comfort
Ignoring the heart

The end justifies the means
Destruction controls all we make
Blaspheming Gaia and ourselves
What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine

To be a servant to your fellow man
To strive for the goals of others
Chosenly humiliated
Less than animal
Confused by your ego
Reflecting all that you are
Reflecting all that you hate

The end justifies the means
Destruction controls all we make
Blaspheming Gaia and ourselves
What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine

They have lied to you your whole life
Leading you astray
You have every right to be
Naturally free
You forget who you are

They have lied to you your whole life
Leading you astray
You have every right to be
Naturally free
You forget who you are
