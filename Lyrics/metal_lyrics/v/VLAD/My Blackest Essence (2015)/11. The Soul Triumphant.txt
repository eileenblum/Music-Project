To rise above the darkness
You must feel the light
The force within your body
Is radiant and bright
Your consciousness is holy
Your heart is pure and bold
Your pulse echoes through dimensions
Your passion is your strength

Transmogrify your misery and let your soul take flight
Your rage burns like fire and fuels you to survive

The suffering of this world
You will rise above
With focus and precision
Your will is your perfection
You've been given time
And you wield it as a weapon
To transcend above madness
Your glory is your strife
Though the world is crumbling
You face it with your might
Be steadfast through your struggles
Before triumph, you must fight

You are the strength
To rise above
