Invert your sight
Travel on the winds of time
Find within eternal sky

Spread your wings, begin to fly
You just have to try
Breathe the air into your lungs
Fire in your eyes
Power flowing through your veins
As you calm your mind
Elevate your consciousness
You are limitless

This dimension
Was made for you
Use your power
As you see fit
You are a god
