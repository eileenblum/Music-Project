Boundless streams of poison contaminate purity
All knowledge resides behind the guise of mortal lies
To see through this darkness, you have to close your eyes
Feel yourself becoming what is in your mind

Swimming through poisoned waters, struggling to breath
Wadding through human garbage, to find what is sacred
Reaching for the answers, through endless mounds of bullshit
Trying to feel comfort in understanding nothing
