Easy, everything will be alright with time
You are intelligent, do not worry
You don't need to prove it
All you need to know is to be your self
You are no one else
Believe in your self
Forget everything that holds you back

Everyone is a teacher, you're your worst enemy
Only you can save your self from negativity
Meditate to escape, then you will be free
You must find within your self your own tranquility
