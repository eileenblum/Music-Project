Something is controlling me
I am not myself
I am no one else
It twists my emotions into stress
It warps my mind and makes me stupefied

My reality is struggle
Sometimes I cannot win
All I strive for is triumph
At times I'm powerless

I focus on my strife
I purge myself of hate
I heal myself
I forget my pain
