I foresee the end of all time
For I know the beginning
A linear path into decay
A twisted path through chaos
Battles are waged in cycles of torment
The living understand this
Though feed the evil within themselves
With the purest of intentions

I see my end
I will not win
The fight with death
I am not I

I am the start
I am the end
I am the dark
I am the light

Falling from grace is inevitable
We are subject to cycles
This life I leave is destruction
The path to home is life
