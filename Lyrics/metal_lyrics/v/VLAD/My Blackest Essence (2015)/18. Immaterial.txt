Locked inside behind my eyes
Eyes see nothing when the mind is blind

Opening celestial passages within
Deep exploration of the soul

The human experienceâ¦ Immaterial

Wave forms of light bonded to flesh
Only to be forgotten

Thoughts are real, they command you
You are not real, this is a dream
We float in the air toward gravity
Sinking into the ground
Returning into cycles

Awaken your being of light
Command your darkness

All is evil
All is pure

All is one
All will end
