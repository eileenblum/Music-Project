I am my own god, soul-bound to reign in Hell
The power of ancients flows in my blood

I am empty, possessed by my self
I am the will of God possessing a human form
I create to destroy, I destroy to create
I die to live
I live to die

This is all a dream, nothing is everything
Everything is key
You are an ancient being

You decide your fate, you are what you create
