From the infertile womb we erupted
Within the fertile soil we stay
Bound to matter as it's master
We change the universe in our wake

From the darkness spawned the light,
From the light spawned our world
We must honor our sacred ties
We are walkers between worlds

Neither black nor white is our shade,
Positive and negative don't equate
We are infinite within two selves
In this, we create the third dimension

We are demonic and we are angelic
We create the world in our image
The more we sin, the more Hell fire will rise
The more we cleanse ourselves, the more Heaven will shine

We must honor our sacred ties
We are walkers between worlds
One foot in the grave, one foot firmly on the ground
We challenge ourselves, and arise to the occasion
[2x]

Never feel alone in this tiny world,
I am right beside you, invisible yet there
I will be your guidance, I'll be your protector
I will live up to this with all of my potential
[2x]

We are demonic and angelic
We create the world in our image
The more we sin, the more Hell will rise
The more we cleanse ourselves, the more Heaven will shine
