Even though I understand all is one,
I will stand my ground no matter what
You think you have any power over me?
You must either be stupid or joking
I will never let anyone control me
My free will is mine, and I do as I please
Even though I know as Legion you are a part of me,
You're the part of me that I wish to be deceased

Your ego is so massive you can not see past it
To think you thought you were above me makes me laugh
You're pathetic, pitiful, dreadful, and shameful
I already won the war, so give up your battle
Don't you understand how much I have accomplished?
I would never let you take that away from me
You wouldn't last a single minute in my mind,
So why are you trying so hard to insult mine?

You think you have been through so much
You want me to think that you are tough
I only see a weakling cowering in fear
You always wanted to impress, but you will never here
[2x]

I'm the one man army, I dominate my territory
You're so fragile, it wouldn't be worth my time to kill you
Why don't you go hide somewhere to breakdown and cry?
You're insecure and weak, I'm not one of your kind
[2x]
