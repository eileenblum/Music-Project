Is nothing sacred to you?
Do you see nothing in the stars?
In the self, do you see it there?
Do you see any self at all?

Do you feel incomplete?
Do you feel completely empty?
Blessed be the sacred right,
To find nothing sacred at all

There are gods that you know not of,
Older than our oldest 
Unthinking nor feeling for mortal matters
They just want to feed on you and I
Protect your spirit at all times
Refuse the power that makes you blind
Accept one's own fate, act on destiny
You are the master of your self,
Unless you desire being a slave
[2x]
