In the deepest, darkest places and in the blackest night
This is where you will find it, the love for the light
Surrounded by a shadow, no color to be seen
Be still in the trance of it, excitation without stimulation

Embrace your life through the energies around
Feel your life flow through you, and flowing through the ground
See through your third eye, into infinite sky
Without the light, there would be no life

Breathe the air into your holy temple
Not seeing from your eyes, but seeing from your mind
Allow yourself to be seduced by the darkness,
It's black wings will embrace you in it's greatness
