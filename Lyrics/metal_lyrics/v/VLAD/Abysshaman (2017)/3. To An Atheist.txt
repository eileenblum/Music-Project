Within the soul, the truest identity
Infinite power, eternal, forever
We walk in the shadows of our higher selves,
Like tiny gods in a little world

Human animals are not the highest power
We are primal, yet have limitless potential
We are the young gods, sons and daughters of Old Gods
Where your feet stand is on top of the world

Where the wind blows, inherit your own creativity
Where the Earth stands, stand with it in triumph
When the fire burns, feel your vibrance come to life
When the waves crash, inherit your inert abilities
[2x]

We are the young gods, sons and daughters of Old Gods
Where your feet stand is on top of the world
[3x]
