Abominable abhorrence that feeds on our ignorance
Draining the thoughts from our minds
Reaping our hearts and souls
Selfish, unreasonable, unthinking, we are hollow

We pray to nothing, for no one, alone
[2x]

Demanding attention, your concept of nothing
Nothing to fear, nor anything at all
No feeling, no thinking, nor living, nor mind
No seeing, no doing, nor dying, not being
[2x]

Constantly filling every empty space,
Never appreciating it's vastness
You hate feeling small, for your ego is so tall
You'd love us all to stand in your shadow
[2x]
