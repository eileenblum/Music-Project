Everything and everyone is a celestial mirror
The illusion is that you think you don't see yourself
All is only you, everything you love and hate
Where you see beauty or ugliness, it is you
We are all alone, yet together as one
The theory of collective consciousness is only scratching the surface
Everything you think and do is only what others think and do through you

The stars in the sky and the vastness of the void create their image in your own
When you compare yourself to another, you are only looking in the mirror
Where you see a problem in someone else,
You are seeing the problem in yourself
There is only self hatred, there is only self love
You must understand that God is alone

All complexities in illusions of difference unify together as legion [2x]

Legion [2x]

The smallest pieces of atomic structures and the largest universes melt together
Reality is chaos, only held together by the immense power of true nothingness
Do not fear anything at all, you will find that you only fear yourself
Open the heart to infinite love, and you will find that you only love yourself
