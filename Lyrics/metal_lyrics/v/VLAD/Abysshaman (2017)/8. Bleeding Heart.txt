I don't want anything from you
I don't want to get in your way
All I want is you to be okay
I know that seems impossible these days

I never want to hurt you
I never want you to die
All I want is nirvana,
For all of us, and you, and I

Why does this seem so out of reach?
I just want us to be at peace
I know it doesn't matter, but the wish is free
I just wish we could be kind and loving

Instead of maniacal, and resentful
Instead of threatening our own kind
Instead of being separate by our differences,
I wish we could see them as beautiful
