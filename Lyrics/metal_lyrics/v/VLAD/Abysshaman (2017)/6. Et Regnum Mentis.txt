Look behind your eyes, what do you see?
If you see nothing, you should start thinking
Locked up inside your skull, your prized possession
God's gift to you, as a human

Phenomenal, yet logical
Rational, yet magical
It has been written, and it is so
This is your kingdom, your soul's own throne

This is your kingdom, your will be done
The flesh's master, immortal one
This is your kingdom, your will be done
The flesh's master, eternal one

All of your wishes and dreams will come true with this
Your personal evolution is only controlled by this
Accomplishing, victorious, it rewards you
Infinite power is waiting for commands from you
