Feel the dark of night close in on you,
Stare deep into the emptiness of it
Do you see the eyes looking back at you?
Do you see the emptiness is filled?

What sensations do you identify,
Is it your excitement, or a fear to die?
Do you feel anxious, nervous, or upset,
Or do you feel like a new you you've never met?

The spirits watch you at all times,
Some are good, and some are evil
Some are familiar persons who have died,
Others are from a place beyond our space and time

Do you hear the voices talking to you?
Do you hear them like I do?
Have you felt that you are haunted,
That's there's no escape from the telepathic mind?
