He is the one who crawls in the night and dwells in the abyss
Between the stars of ancient realms above, monoliths
Depicting the great one, the only one over thy great
Black sultan of chaos and death from the depths of time and space

Lurking
Crawling
Shifting
Deceiving
On your soul

Faceless effigies sprawling forth from black temples of despair
Rise the pharaoh of a thousand faces
Never-ending dreams of grotesque worlds never to be seen by men
Rise the messenger of thy great ones

Crawling! Crawling Chaos!
God of forbidden dreams, hailing from the stars
Crawling! Crawling Chaos!
Grant us your black sight, to rid the world of this dreaded light
