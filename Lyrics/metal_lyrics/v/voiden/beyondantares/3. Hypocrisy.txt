Beings of disgrace
Once arisen from dust
What they dictates
Words of deceit and lust
Foolish ones
In disguise of truth
Your end shall come
And you'll meet your doom
Inside your lies
Inside your mind
Find your death
Mindless wretch
Try to hide
Behind the mask of your

Hypocrisy
(Unable to see the truth)
Your life is a lie
The path of the wicked
(That lies upon you)
The blindness of your
Hypocrisy

Nothing you shall know
What you reap you shall sow
Blind you are
To the truth
By our hand
We shall bring your end
The madness begins
In its twisted grin
The reflection of
Your foolish life
Revealing the lie of
Your own

Hypocrisy
(Unable to see the truth)
Your life is a lie
The path of the wicked
(That lies upon you)
The blindness of your
Hypocrisy

The time is nigh
Just as the stars predicted
They have come to end this cruel charade
This kind of mindless ghouls who roam this insignificant planet
Shall perish for the ancient kind of godlike beings who first created them
Nothing shall remain of the blind fools who couldn't see what was in the horizon
Only death remains for the careless human race

Here they are! I can see fire raining from the sky! The creators have awoken to take back what is theirs! The end of the line has been reached, tortured souls are rising once more, to punish the blind race one final time. I can see them on the horizon, they are

Hypocrisy
(Unable to see the truth)
Your life is a lie
The path of the wicked
(That lies upon you)
The blindness of your
Hypocrisy
