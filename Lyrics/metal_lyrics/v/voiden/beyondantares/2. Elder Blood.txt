Oh! The dark and cold!
Empty black from where we came
So serene is your embrace
Away from
Woe! The hills of dreams
Far from the curse of men
Where I shall rise again
Once more!

We shall fly again
With the ancients
All who hail thy
Elder blood
On thy realm of
Eldritch dreams from
Stars and realms beyond
In the occult

Rise! From the abyss!
To the eternal sea of stars
Why do I have to fly so
Far!

Destructive storms and evil winds
They are mighty children, Ancient Ones
Heralds of pestilence
They are the flood which rusheth through the land

Seven Gods of the broad heavens
Seven Gods of the Broad Earth
Seven Ancient Ones are They
Seven gods of might
Seven evil gods
Seven evil demons
Seven demons of oppression
Seven in heaven
Seven on earth

Blood!
From the ancient gods!
Sleeping far beneath the earth
All shall fear their dreadful wake
Once again
