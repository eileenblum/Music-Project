Risen from beyond the graves
Plunged into (the) black
Void and Cursed with ancient knowledge
From the Outer Ones

Darkness rising!
From beyond the star!
Damned piping!
Calls from afar!

Rise! Soar! Die! Fly!

Beyond Antares!
I shall find my fate!
At the side of the ghosts of the fallen
I will cross the gate

The guardian of the west has perished
So we can carry on our flight
Thousands of souls of the banished
Soar in the black of the night

Twisted in a new form
By the Ones of Old who made me arise
Beyond humanity and death
Hear my plight!

All the fallen
In chaos we are reborn
We are chosen
To ride the storm

Arise! Consume! Destroy! Transcend!

Beyond Antares!
I shall find my fate!
At the side of the ghosts of the fallen
I will cross the gate

The guardian of the west has perished
So we can carry on our flight
Thousands of souls of the banished
Soar in the black of the night
