To walk those fields
To see the depths
To hear the voices
To see those things...

Hear the voices ever draw you near
Bastard of black spell is all you fear
Captured by the dark ones in your sleep
Slave of satan for all eternity

I've been those places
I've seen those depths
To feel the power
To feel...death

Dead alive, brainless society
Prison of mass stupidity
Captured by the dark ones in your sleep
Slave of satan for all eternity

Where the flame grows cold
And powers never rise
And as you sit, alone
Come forth, your life

Those nights
Take you...
Those depths..
Feel you..
They chime the ancient bell
And conjure
The ritual

Hear the voices ever draw you near
Bastard of black spell is all you fear
Captured by the dark ones in your sleep
Slave of satan for all eternity
