He dances on freezing waters
Time remains from nothing
The dried veins of a fragile existence
Forced to haunt in
A vastland...blanket of mist
A spirit...without a soul
The narrow hall
From where existence is born
Unlockable
The sky breathes
Cold winds
But no life is left
Forgotten
Desolated
Doomed to roam
Alone
In a vastland
Trees which taunt him
Mountains that cease to rise
Oak has shattered
Whence a strong branch
The limbs will crack
And form a shattered frown
An unforgivable existence
Bounded by self grief
A once life
Trapped in a sphere of anguish
Lost
Sullen eyes grasp to embrace
Unable to See
What once was
Gazing beyond eternities..
Obscured slumber..
Ascent from serenity
The illusion of existence
Perpetuated by a condemned spirit
Hopeless and ruined
As a wretched phantom
Bound by eternal grief
For eternity...
