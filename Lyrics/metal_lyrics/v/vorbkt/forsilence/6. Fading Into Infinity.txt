this is a labyrinth
without any accompaniment
disgust towards you is too strong
i have to be alone

human hate growing within

to dwell where
no other has

pour more alcohol
and sleep forever

is this continued existence
worse than death?

like animals to slaughter
one by one they fell
one by one I fell
drop for drop
piece by piece
I fell
