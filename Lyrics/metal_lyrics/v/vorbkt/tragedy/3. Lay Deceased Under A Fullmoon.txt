long at night
i feel so cold
black purity in my heart as i grow old
fuck your life
spitting hatred let darkness grow
bile putrid guts are mold
fuck life to kill hope
in the end left always none
spit at face of existance and there
is no return for puny weaklings
spitting hate let darkness grow
body parts grow high
shine light no more
from a stench that i breathe
break the shrines again and
there is no return for puny weaklings
this is when it will be done
on this night
black breath upon me
long at night he has no way
my hate will be conquered
the journey over time
has been reborn
into the end
that you continue to see
bodies spread in piles
stench starts to grow
should you see or witness the end
tonight i am at one
skys cleansed in blood
dead under the winter fullmoon
under fullmoon
in the night
know the depths of my blight
why do you feel
piles of humans wasted
give in to death
cold.
to feel
entrapped, from birth
bodies no longer stand so tall
