what have i become
in this desolate world
of mortal man
i look inside myself
look for answers
to my questions
only bleak outlook
feel the pain with the knife
seek to find happiness
dead in the gutter
mortified and strangled
lying here
gazing into the endless
blackness
that is overwhelming me
i dont know where to look
to find peace
is it lost forever?
what is left
[when we are all gone
black murder upon us all
carrion call the doves shall sing
flock in herds, our mortal coil
watch as it leaves our veins]
spit at your world
and hide in silence
to know
what its like
to be dead
eyes look inside my
tired skull
rotting insides
how cant you see?
what we have become
plague, existence
death, futility,
what is the meaning?
pointless
meaningful life
struggle in the everyday
although its your only way
seek to find inside yourself
realize there is nothing left
worth living for
