Hate
Lies
On the first night
I admit to nothing
Ripped open, a pile of flesh
Can you tell me what I am?
Insufferable corpse, in chains
Tragedy builds, inside
Bleeding arrows through me
I am, now gone.
How can you admit to
The future of desolate landscape
And darkness left
When it's all destroyed
Because of humans
Useless pathetic beings
I see through the lies and doubt
Tragedy
Left
I've come
After it's all gone
Open my eyes

(before I die)
