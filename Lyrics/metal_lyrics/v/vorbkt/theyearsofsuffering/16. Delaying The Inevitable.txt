Wasted
Hopes and dreams
Realisations
That value is lost,
With escapen wisdom

Alone amongst billions
Hopeless and distraught
They perpetuate our disease...

Intentions of many
Cannot pertain the will of few
Although, just,
They lead our demise

Bitter, destroyed flesh
Stone tears meld to the ground
Now, I, Whisper away to my solitude

Suffering
the only value real
yet, you condem...

"Well I've been extremely disturbed about how much pain, suffering, and death has occurred on this planet for the last, what? Two billion years?

How much pain and suffering is there going on, on the planet Jupiter? How much pain and suffering is now going on, on the planet earth? How many species are now extinct because of the result of mankind's behavior? How many of those extintions were motivated by compassionate genocide, as opposed to malicious genocide?

DNA, reproducing chemical manifestation. And that is it. There's no winning, crossing line to finish here. All we're doing is, we're delaying our inevitable extinction. And creating more people who will suffer and die in the future.

I don't find this whole human enterprise, of just delaying the inevitable honorable, or purposeable at all. It's an abomination

And I don't appreciate being brought into this world by people such as yourself who take no accountability for their wreckless pro-creative decisions"

you destroy the only thing beautiful
you torture - eat the flesh of others
and cannibalize the only thing dear
...Why me?

Instead of our peaceful end
You raise a fist to Armageddon
breeding in filth, shit, stench

"As long as it's not me"
