bleed
everything bleeds
color i bleed
drips from me
so slowly
bring forth all death
burning all churches so bright
deep in the nocturnal night
slit the throat of gods
no return from where you came
against all that has oppressed us
for so long
immortal hate smash the skull
of purity burning in the night
burning all churches so bright
deep in the nocturnal night
candle lit, amass of dark hymns
chanted everlastingly, revelations of eternal fire
funeral mist
clouds my eyesight
no longer can i see
sudden comfort
in blackness
..everlastingly
churches burning so bright
deep in the nocturnal night
slit the throat of gods
no return from where you came

..so long, so long, so long..
