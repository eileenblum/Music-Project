In my limbs i feel a pain
tombs stare, skin manifestation
it turns
to ash
left in bitter flame
where once was a man
now
a tomb
cut..

Cut it deep
My bones ache and i am brittle
Cut deep into my flesh
I am forgotten
This world
Dead, gone, life
To see darkness and to breathe black
Breathe the stench of decay
I am dead on the inside
I lie,decaying, and broken
I am gone

My bones are buried amongst these ruins
Where life is no more
To see the darkness and to
Breathe the
Black stench of decay

I lie,
Dead

...let it all go...
