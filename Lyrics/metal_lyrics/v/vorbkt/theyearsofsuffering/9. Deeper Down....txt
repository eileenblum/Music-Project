Strangling me
Everything that I see
Ravens call... at me
Strangling...

I avoid happiness
Isolation, my mutilation
Isolation...
Monotony .... everyday
Isolation blinds me
Living?

giver of harmfulness,
have no further use of reason
upon this nothingness
gazing into nowhere
secretly...deeper down than ever possible..

These hours are numbered,
Bleed,
For an end...
