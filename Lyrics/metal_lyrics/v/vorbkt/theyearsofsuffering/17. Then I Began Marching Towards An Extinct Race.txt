hate
lies
on the first night
i admit to nothing
ripped open, a pile of flesh
can you tell me what i am?
insufferable corpse, in chains
tragedy builds, inside
bleeding arrows through me
i am, now gone.
how can you admit to
the future of desolate landscape
and darkness left
when it's all destroyed
because of humans
useless pathetic beings
i see through the lies and doubt
tragedy
left
i've come
after it's all gone
open my eyes

(before i die)
