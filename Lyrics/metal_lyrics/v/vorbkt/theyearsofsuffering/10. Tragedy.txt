Hear my cry
In bitter death

Has stopped
As deep as a grave
Graven life

This will be my last hour
I've been here so long
As blood will run
I've been here for so long
And as time will pass
Will be
Tragedy
Shed this entity's skin
Delve into a sea of blackness
Spit at those across
those below

Useless thoughts and words
Tell me to give in
And fill my lungs with the blackest bile
To give a taste of the abyss
From the lips
Of misery
A heavy toll, too alluring to refuse
Slowly and painfully,
Blood drips i know i am alive
Living mask withering alone
Separate from your world
impierce

After everything pasts
It is finally over
Opening my dead eyes
Screaming from out distance
Absorbing misery
And I see nothing has changed
Dead minds stay unchanged
