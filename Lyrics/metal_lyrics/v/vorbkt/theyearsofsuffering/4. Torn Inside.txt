What have I become
In this desolate world
Of mortal man
I look inside myself
Look for answers
To my questions
Only bleak outlook
Feel the pain with the knife
Seek to find happiness
Dead in the gutter

Mortified and strangled
Lying here
Gazing into the endless
Blackness
That is overwhelming me
I dont know where to look
To find peace
Is it lost forever?

What is left
When we are all gone
Black murder upon us all
Carrion call the doves shall sing
Flock in herds, our mortal coil
Watch as it leaves our veins
Spit at your world and hide in silence
To know
What its like
To be dead
I look inside my tired skull
Rotting inside...
How cant you see?
What we have become
Plague, Existence
Death, Futility,

What is the meaning?
Pointless...
Meaningful life?
What is the meaning?

Mortified and strangled
Lying here
Gazing into the endless
Blackness
That is overwhelming me
I dont know where to look

Carrion call the doves shall sing
Flock in herds, our mortal coil
