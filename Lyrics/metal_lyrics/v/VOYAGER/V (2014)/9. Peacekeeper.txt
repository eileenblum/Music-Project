Carefully! I donât want to tread on anyoneâs toes.
So I say things just to please, keep the peace, keep the peace, put you at ease.
Carefully! Iâll say anything, Iâll do anything to keep the peace, to keep the peace.

One word permission to accept all I have done
Heard the only one that you will keep in mind! Absurd
If this is what Iâm judged about and all you have is ten percent when

I have shown the ninety
Itâs here beside me
And so I wonder
And it is eating you inside
Scratch the surface of offence
Raise the flag of insolence
What is right and what is wrong
Itâs been a struggle all along

One word leads to peace and
Followed by another brings us war
Why donât you remember all the things you chose just to ignore
Follow in your footsteps
Just so I can fit into the mould
Wagging tongues and wool coats in this being Iâve been sold
Carefully, Iâll say anything, Iâll do anything to keep the peace, to keep the peace.
â¦to keep the peace and resolution is at easeâ¦
Iâll do anything to keep the peace
Iâll do anything at all, at all, anything to keep the peace
Do anything to keep the peace, Iâll do anything
