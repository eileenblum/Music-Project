Itâs clear that what they had were purely good intentions
Itâs clear that what they thought were blissful non-events

They hear a phrase and go assign it one dimension
They know it well, âthereâs no use sitting on the fenceâ

We vote for another soul

Sit back and watch the flicker of an old invention
Reach into comfort zones, what can they do for you?

Itâs clear that what they had were purely good intentions
Theyâre nowhere near the place that brought me here to you.

We vote for another soul
It's nothing when you can have it all

We want to follow
But we have no-one here to lead so the shallow
Is always in the primal seat
We have it all now
You can leave it all behind
You, the shallow
Fortune favours our blind

It's clear that they're not what we saw in our time
So in the end it's you and me who walk the line

We vote for another soul
It's nothing when you can have it all
