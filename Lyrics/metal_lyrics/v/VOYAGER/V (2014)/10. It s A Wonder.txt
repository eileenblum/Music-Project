You want one more night
You want nine more lives
You need hearing eyes
You need cleaner strides

You want grand and picturesque
You crave temper passion rest
You want youth and many souls all made of gold

I have built the boat to get me out of here so I set the sails of misery

What we have
Is like the falling rain
We got someone to blame
What we want
Will always be the same
We are part of the game

And no one wants to be in mediocrity

You want just another dame
You want all in all aflame
You have acres of their love
You have what is not enough

You want grand and picturesque
You crave temper passion rest
You want youth and many souls all made of

What we have
Is like the falling rain
We got someone to blame
What we want
Will always be the same
We are part of the game

Always greener, always more
What you have is such a bore
Never-ending seeking more
It's a wonder that we ignore

Always greener, always more
What you have is such a bore
Never-ending seeking more
It's a wonder that we ignore

And no one wants to be in mediocrity
