Still October
And green light flickers on the minds of many waiting to arise

Still November
And yellow lights arise out of the ashes of a mystery

Still December
And once again a fading hour leads them to believe in me

Now, when we look back at our history
Our acts/omissions a mystery
A little peace of mind thatâs with us all the time
Itâs with us winter and autumn time
And some of us in the summertime
In the seasons of age
In the seasons of age

And we wither and it winters again
And itâs always the same
And itâs always the same
Trenches deeper and another one appears
On the faces of those that are near

Now, when we look back at our history
Our acts/omissions a mystery
A little peace of mind thatâs with us all the time
Itâs with us winter and autumn time
