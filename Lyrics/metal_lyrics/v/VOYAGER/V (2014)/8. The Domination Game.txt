I know what you want to say to me
Will watch you walk all over me
Now watch me die all over you

We are nothing for your power surge
Is in our soil what you deserve?
So tell me do we have to serve?

Tight grasp a hold of me we look towards uncertainty
Tight clasp a hold for everyone to see you got a hold on me

Oh tonight you steal the light again
You reach our souls on heaven-sent
And we can only watch and weep
In your domination

Oh tonight you steal the pillars why
You reach our souls and mark the sky
And we are only marks of fire
In your domination game

Your hands are on the lever
Commands to follow the leader
It will come biting back again until you realise

Oh tonight you steal the light again
You reach our souls on heaven-sent
And we can only watch and weep
In your domination

Oh tonight you steal the pillars why
You reach our souls and mark the sky
And we are only marks of fire
In your domination game

You want to save us? How?
We dig the grave, you drown!

Oh itâs the domination game
Oh itâs the domination game

And weâre dying all the same
