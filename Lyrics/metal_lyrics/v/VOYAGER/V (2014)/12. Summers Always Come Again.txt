And not a single day goes by
Where nothing sounds alike a sigh
Where she forgives the bravest blur and her

And darkness comes around again
And lines are written of the same
So gently fold the page and carry it with ease

She will stand upon the shore
And her flowing dress in silent core
And the winter glows inside her veins
But the summer always comes again

And everlasting sadness will turn into a mile
And far from the horizon the semblance of a smile
A word into a whisper she'll stay a little while

She will stand upon the shore
And her flowing dress in silent core
And the winter glows inside her veins
But the summer always comes again
But the summer always comes again
But the summer always comes again
