Stand before the line 
Stand before the line 
Freed through emotions of greed 
Stand before the line 
Stand before the line 
Stand before the line of fear 

Cold at heart, cold in mind 
Every night a different sky 
You and me, finally 
Shall we dance to eternity 

Shall we dance 
Shall we dance to the morning light? 

I break the ice and time stands still 
I overcome the iron will 
Embrace the floods inside of me 
the flowing waters set me free 
Come on now 
I break the ice and time stands still 
I overcome the iron will 
Embrace the floods inside of me 
the flowing waters set me free 
So the morning, so the morning comes 

Shall we dance to the morning light?
