Breathe in slowly
Breathe into the air again, feel the pressure rise again
Breathe out slowly
Itâs the relaxation game feel it all again

My everything is fading, my everything is fading
Iâm hyperventilating, Iâm hyperventilating.

Breathe out slowly, feel the depths around me grow me
And is it all over now? And is it just minutes now?
As you fill your lungs with soot and dust
The touch of snow and pine and wood and rust
So breathing is longing
And somehow itâs loathing me again

My everything is fading, my everything is fading
Iâm hyperventilating, Iâm hyperventilating.

And I lose control
And I feel it grow inside
Inside our minds
So I lose control

My everything is fading, my everything is fading
Iâm hyperventilating, Iâm hyperventilating.

And I inhale
And I exhale
