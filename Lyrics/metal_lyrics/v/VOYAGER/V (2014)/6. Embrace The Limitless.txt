See the colours that are in between
And at the time it seemed like solace, like solace
Hear the roaring waves of grey machines
Cause at the time seemed they were glowing and flowing

Everlasting
Overarching
Promise that the world is watching
When the air was filled with smells of grey

This is all we had to give
This is our way to bliss
Time and time machines caress
And we embrace the limitless

See the colours in between
And at the time it really felt like solace
The blue and grey and green
Hear the roaring waves and stop the machines
Cause really at the time it felt like they were overflowing

Itâs the everlasting snow
Weâve got nowhere else to go
Promise that the world is in our hands until the end

This is all we had to give
This is our way to bliss
Time and time machines caress
And we embrace the limitless

We are the fallen
We are the golden
We are together
And we embrace the sun
