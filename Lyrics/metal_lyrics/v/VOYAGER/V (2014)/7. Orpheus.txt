Donât look back
When the road that youâve run starts pulling you into its
Dimension track
When the path that youâve taken looks better ahead and you know that you
Will see no evil here
These blackened frames are masking
What we have feared is near
I tell you no!
Are you really aware?
Are you really aware?
Are you really aware

Donât!
Donât try to recreate
Donât try to re-establish ties
With something thatâs too late

Etwas ist immer
TrÃ¶ste dich
Jedes GlÃ¼ck hat einen kleinen Stich
Wir mÃ¶chten so viel: Haben. Sein. Und gelten.
DaÃ einer alles hat:
Das ist selten

Donât try to recreate
So leave behind
The things that deviate will leave you blind

Donât!
Donât try to recreate
Donât try to re-establish ties
With something thatâs too late

Donât look back
When the road that youâve run starts pulling you into its
Dimension track
When the path that youâve taken looks better ahead remember
