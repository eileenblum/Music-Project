And every day I hope
That this feeling fades
On every page I turn
There appears your face

Can I survive on my knees?
Begging for you to

Come
Back to me
Stay away
Draw me near
Let me go, let me be
Hold me now - set me free

Everwaiting - everdreaming
This is not what I was looking for

Ten closing chapters
No happy ending here
As the "we" relapses
I draw you near

Everwaiting - everdreaming
This is not what I was looking for

Can I hold you?
Never leave me!
Let me live!
And I'm still holding on to you!
