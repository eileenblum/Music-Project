White, white is the one
Bright as the sun
Into the battle the stallion rides
Voices will sing
Storm of the wind
Free as the heart of the warrior king

She fights the fire
Wings of desire
Thundering out of the funeral pyre

Howl of the hounds
Silence the sound
Run them into the ground

Fear the fire
Fear the thunder in her eyes
As she is running through the skies she is my

White Shadow, run White Shadow
White Shadow, run White Shadow
White Shadow, run White Shadow knight
In the darkness I will see your light

She, mare of the sky
Breathing with life
Leaving a trail of fire
Behind the nation
Fire invasion
This sensation
Infinite universe chase

Fear the fire
Fear the thunder in her eyes
As she is running through the skies she is my

White Shadow, run White Shadow
White Shadow, run White Shadow
White Shadow, run White Shadow knight
In the darkness I will see your light

In the darkness of the night
I will feel the burning light
My shadow fire
Can you feel she is the one?
In the shadow of the sun!
Can you see her run?

In the darkness of the night
See her burning deep inside she is my

White Shadow, run White Shadow
White Shadow, run White Shadow
White Shadow, run White Shadow knight
In the darkness I will see your light

White Shadow, run White Shadow
White Shadow, run White Shadow
White Shadow, run White Shadow knight
In the darkness I will see your light
