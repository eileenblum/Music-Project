I sit and ponder life
Beyond my own belief
One step forward into times of grief

I know decisions are a grinding pressured chore
And I'm waiting for the...

High time now
And in the answer I believe
There must be something I conceived
And I'm waiting
Is this what I want?
Is this what I need?
Is this good for me?

Why try to ultracrepidate?
Just turn towards yourself
Who cares what everyone is dreaming?
In summary I bleed less than you sell

High time now
And in the answer I believe
There must be something I conceived
And I'm waiting
Is this what I want?
Is this what I need?
Is this good for me?

I may have promised that I'll be just one more self
Is this what I want?
Is this what I need?
Is this good for me?
