So I can't believe in you
And you can't believe in me?
Is this what we call a truce?
Is this how it's meant to be?

In these arms a pleasant lace of charms so ask me

One more time I beg for
One less sign to see what
I can find among the ones you make me out to be

I know I am like everything before
I can I see when I am on the floor
I cross I wait for everything to turn
I am I breathe for what you make me yearn

In these arms a pleasant lace of charms so ask me

One more time I beg for
One less sign to see what
I can find among the ones you make me out to...

One more time
One less sign
When you turn your back to me
(and so I wait for you to turn)

One more time I beg for
One less sign to see what
I can find among the one you make me out to...

One more time
One more time
When you turn your back to me

One more time
One less sign
When you turn to me again
