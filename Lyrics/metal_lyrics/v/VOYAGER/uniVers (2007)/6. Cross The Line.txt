Time, another time
Another line
And we've crossed it here again
Out of no respect I throw you back into your little game

I tell you one
But I believe in two
I tell you two
But I believe in three
I tell you one
But I just got to contradict you to the tenth degree
I tell you one
But I believe in two
I tell you two and I said no, just you watch me go!

Never ever cross the line
Never ever give a sign
Never ever show that you're the weaker mind

Never ever turn your back
Never let me see your act
Never ever ever ever cross the line I know it well

...and if you ever cross the line
...this isn't for the final time
This isn't for what you believe what isn't wrong or right
