One by one
We are blinded to forget
All the things that we wish we had said

Stare right into the darkness into which we ride
Far too late - for the fact that we're alive

And we're all falling down through the window of the world
No one cares no one's falling with us
Call for help in the void, but there's no one here to sell
You a place on the throne of your time

Stare right into the darkness into which we ride
Far too late - for the fact that we're alive

And we're all falling down through the window of the world
No one cares no one's falling with us
Call for help in the void, but there's no one to sell
You a place on the throne of your time
