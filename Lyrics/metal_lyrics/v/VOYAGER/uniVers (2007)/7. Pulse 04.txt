Time leads me into a sun of seas
This isn't what I fear
This is forever!

Bring me down up to a rising sound
Travelled in all my life
Can this be never?

Try just to see me all alive
Keep my pulse on 285
Keep my heart a bleeding frenzy

Blemish me
And sow the seed
And show me something to nothing
To anything to stay alive

And now the river runs
And now the setting sun
And the season's war
My pulse remains on zero four

And now the setting sun
And now the river runs
And the season's war
My pulse remains on zero four

Drive on, drive on through the restless night
Until I'm satisfied that this isn't forever

Bring me down, up to a rising sound
Travelled in all my life - can you tell me it's never?

PS: Fear Of The Sky
