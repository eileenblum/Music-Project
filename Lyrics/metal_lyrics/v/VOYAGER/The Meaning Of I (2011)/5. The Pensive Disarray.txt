I seek to find
All the things that i have found
All the times that i have lost so

I seek to yield
To the pressures of today
To the pensive disarray

But i'm still folding
Holding onto what i've got

I seek to bring
All the gifts of inner core
To the ones that i adore so

I can surround
Myself with the ones i love
With the ones i trust and i'm still holding
Holding onto what i've got

I take the pressure now
I take the silent sour
I keep believing
I hold the reason
I hold the answer how
Will i know why right now
I hold the reason
I am deceiving

[vox guest Dan Tompkins:]
I breathe the
I feel the
And i wonder i ponder i can't escape from me again

[Guitar solo: kay]

Like the silent abode
In the tears i will glow
It's illusion i crave
It's the feeling i savour and the
Subatomic niveau
Into pieces i go
Judging all that i see
In the absence of glee and you always say

(vox guest: Dan Tompkins)
I know the answer now and feel
I know what you have said is real and i am suffering again
Taking all the pain

I hold the answer
How will i know why right now?
What is the reason for this pensive disarray?
