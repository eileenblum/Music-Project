One for the passers-by
One for the ocean sky
Is hit how we shall dance
In our grey romance

Changing changing
Like chamelons and dreamers

Integrating
Like a changing song of seasons

Separating
Emulating, overrating

Iâm cascading
Separating emulating

Walking hand in hand along the sea
Are you shaded just like me and me?

This seceding, just another feelingâ¦

Come and see the dream that I can see
Come and see the possibilities
Endless realms of sadness madness though
Glad that I am here

Are you with me?
Or against me?
Are you shaded
Just like me?

One for the passers-by
One for the ocean sky
Is hit how we shall dance
In our grey romance

One for the passers-by
One for the tempting sigh
Are you afraid of me?

Tell me now
Are you shaded like me?
