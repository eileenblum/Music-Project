Time for you to try something new
Come on it's
Time for you to arise from the blue
Time to for the tears to dry
Time for the years to go by
Time for the years to arrive

I saw the sign from a million miles away
Saw the sign
Take it all and seize the day
Take it seize the day

Now, now that I'm all on my own
Now that I do this alone
Now that I go down the path of self
I See, see that I planted the seed
Tore all this poison from me
Tore all this poison from me and so

I saw the sign from a million miles away
Saw the sign
Take it all and seize the day
