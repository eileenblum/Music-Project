Born again to feel the sigh
Every single day
Paradise alongside me
Horizontal eights
Havenât tendered anything
Present leads the way
Unsuccessful coping now
With storms of everyday

Kak nibud' on spravitsya,
Chas ego pridÃ«t.
Vsem nelâzya vedâ nravitsa â Pustâ sebya naidÃ«t.
Itâs time to find
Itâs time to know
Itâs time to feel the same again
Into the flow
I take it slow
Itâs time to feel the same again
Itâs time to know
