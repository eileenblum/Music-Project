What is the meaning of this tired earth?
The silver platter some of us are served?
Is it a question that we ask us first?
Is it a meal that none of us deserve?

Is this a fact on which we all agree?
Is this a factor that we all must see?
Potentially is a just transient
So why wake up to the extravagant

I see grey
Put some colour into my day
Put some colour into my way
So that I can believe and say
Believe in the meaning of I

What is the meaning of antipathy?
It is much better than just apathy?
A feeling that we lost so long ago
Is just a trail of blood into the snow

Potentially is a just transient
So fall asleep to the extravagant

Put some colour into my day
Put some colour into my way

I see grey
Put some colour into my day
Put some colour into my way
So that I can believe and say
Believe in the meaning of I
