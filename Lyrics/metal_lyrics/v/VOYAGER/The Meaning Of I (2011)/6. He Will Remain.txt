And so he wept
Into himself
And so he wept
And so he felt

So much to give
So much to laugh
So much to hear and feel and have

And he was loved
And he was kind
And he was always in our minds

For him and us
Our strongest will
Won't bring him back
But we will still

Hold him so high
In our hearts
He will remain as one of us
He will remain
He will remain
He will remain as one of us
