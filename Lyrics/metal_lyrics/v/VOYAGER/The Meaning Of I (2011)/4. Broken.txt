Little steps we all must take
To perceive that we're awake
Place your hand in front of your eyes
But leave a little gap to realise
That there's still a lot of sunlight for us all
Am I really breaking?
Or am I just faking?
Or is it nothing after all?

Into the horizon I
Try to bring myself to fly
Finding a machine to spread its wings for me

Into the believers' den
I am tempting fate again
I am breaking
I am broken

Look into your trying eyes
Think of all the prying sighs
Was I really breaking?
Am I already broken
And is it something after all?

I survive and I lose myself
