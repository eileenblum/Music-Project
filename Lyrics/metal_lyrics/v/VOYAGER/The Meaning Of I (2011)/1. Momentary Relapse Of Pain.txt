Momentary relapse of pain
And I feel it again and again
Momentary relapse of pain
in the face of adversity

Momentary relapse of pain
Struggle to feel it the same
Momentary relapse of pain
in the face of perversity

I feel so empty
With the things that I have gained
I feel so empty
Should I be so ashamed?

I feel so empty
With the things that I have found
So I'm preempting
My time below the ground

Don't you know
that I deal with things this way?
Don't you know
I expect you to understand?
And then I push you away from me

I think this is the final straw
Can you stand it any more?

I feel so empty
I feel so empty
I feel so empty
And I feel so empty

Momentary relapse of pain
Struggle to feel it the same
Momentary relapse of pain
in the face of perversity
