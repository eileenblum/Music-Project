You expect me to forget you
You expect me to forget
You await the unexpected
You are me inside a dream

Iron will
Through iron silence
Iron man
With iron fears
Iron will
Internal violence
Iron tears
In an Iron dream

Time ticks on
Movements flicker
Does it mean or does it not?
Does each breath just make me sicker
What is life, but noble rot?

Omnia
Ruerem
Aria
Requiem

It's a nightmare
But it's real
It's the truth that I'm not made of steel

It's a nightmare
But it's real
It's the truth that he's not made of steel

Omnia
Ruerem
Aria
Requiem
