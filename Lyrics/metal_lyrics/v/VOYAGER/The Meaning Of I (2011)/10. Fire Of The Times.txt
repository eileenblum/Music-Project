Finally released
From this cage of defeat
Finally I freed myself
From a river of fear

Yet I'm still drowning inside

Throughout the years
With all these tears
I will hold it inside
Throughout the years
Through all these tears
I will hold it inside

[vox guest DC Cooper:]
When the fields of silent fears are long forgotten
When the tears of time are frozen in my eyes
When I thought that all this hurt would soon be over
I am standing in the fire of my times

When the fields of silent fears are long forgotten
(The fields of silent fears)
When the tears of time are frozen in my eyes
(Are frozen in my eyes)
When I thought that all this hurt would soon be over
(They'll soon be overdue)
I am standing in the fire of my times
