She takes me into the morning sky
Until I cross the line into the morning light
She takes me, into the morning sky
Until I cross the line into the morning light
Into the morning light

Here now, and follow me into the storm
Take me, ride into the unknown
Oh I dial up the river of sad
I will show you what I am torn by
So wont you take my hand?

She takes me into the morning sky
Until I cross the line into the morning light
She takes me, into the morning sky
Until I cross the line into the morning light
Into the morning light

Here now, or have your eyss been full of sand
Here now and I will take you as I am
Oh I, dial up the river of sad
I will show you what I am torn by
So wont you take my hand?

She takes me to places I can heal
She brings me, landscapes so surreal
She shows me, the rivers I can know
To rivers that will flow, into the dream

She takes me into the morning sky
Until I cross the line into the morning light

She takes me, into the morning sky
Until I cross the line into the morning light
She takes me into the morning sky
Until I cross the line into the morning light

Oh I, dial up the river of sad
I will show you what I am torn by
So wont you take my hand?
