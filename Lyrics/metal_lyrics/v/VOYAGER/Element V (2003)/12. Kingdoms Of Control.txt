Stand before the magistrate of fear
Accusations of temptation running near
Signify the wrongs for which I sinned
As if I've slain my very next of kin
I will be what you have been
Following the voice of him
I will stand the trial with pride
With the truth right by my side

Raging silence, stand accused
of something I deny
Pressure, fire, stand accused
and thinking me to be a liar

I will be what you have been
Following the voice of him
I will stand the trial with pride
With the truth right by my side

Lived without a feigned illustrious soul
Undermined by Kingdoms of Control
System of beliefs not recognised
Shall I punish those who punish me to die
