Follow the voice of your heart
To the right
Rest wanderer, gather your strength
For the night

Oh leave behind all the weak
And the false
Summon the strong
And believe in your force

Eat up my friend
The foe's footsteps are here
Unrest in the cosmos
The enemy's near

Fear not the darkness of light
We'll be with you, we shall fight
Calling the armies of treacherous lies
Till we see a ray of light shining bright

And the warriors fight
Tears rejoice in our eyes
For our armies are those of true light
