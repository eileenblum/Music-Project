A monument of grievance
Stands proud and tall at night
For I am the deceiver
I'm the one who never died
Burn the light of treason
Stand proud and tall at night
For I am the deceiver
I'm the one who never died

I am the darkness
But I feigned to be the light
Now I'm the one that grieves
A septicemia of fear
The stones of tears I heave
Take off your mask, reveal the truth
Pretend that I can't see...

Don't be afraid now to open your eyes
The time is so right for you to realise
Uncover the madness, the bravest of tasks
Show me the face that is behind your mask
Cries of sin, a battle to see
I was the traitor now what will I be?
Fight the lies inside me
A shimmer of hope is about to be free
