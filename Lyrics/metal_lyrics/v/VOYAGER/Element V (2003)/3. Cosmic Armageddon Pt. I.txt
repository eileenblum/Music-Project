Million years, million tears
Will we die again?
Let us fight for our rights
Start a new found world!
Wretched earth has ended now
It's calling all of our souls
In the end it's all over now
We're calling all of our souls

In this sphere a life of pain and fear
A new beginning's near
I will be free again
Leave behind the men of weakened pride
A new beginning's near
I will be free again

A new beginning's saviour
But our race is one of hate
A new beginning's saviour
But we decide your fate

A new beginning's one of pride
In a million years of time
I will never be the same
