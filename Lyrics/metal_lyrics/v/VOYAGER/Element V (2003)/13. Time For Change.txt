I turn to see what I purport to be
I transgress established hierarchies
I hope you will accept my company
That my behaviour is what you want it to be
I present you being what I am
I present you wanting what I can

And when the evening comes
Beware the setting sun I'm not the one I used to be
Take this faÃ§ade off me, what I purported to be
You'll be the only one to see

I believe in innocence I believe it till the end
No one finds me to rest in peace
I believe in innocence, I believe it till the end

Oh no
Although success is what I crave
Embrace my common flaws, bring out the hidden slave
And see the flesh that's really me
You can keep the shell but I return to the sea
Present you with my point of view
Accept me now, and the winner is you
I am not many, all but few

Why did I not act upon my instincts?
Two roads diverged in yellow wood
I took the one embraced in endless shadow
But I'm at the journey's end

Time for change now

Why did I not act upon my instincts?
Two roads diverged in yellow wood
I took the one embraced in endless shadow
But I'm at the journey's end
