Are you afraid to walk with me to the valley of the dead?
Tales of madness, tales of horror are forever said
Take my hand I'll lead you to the place where you once died
Haunting shadows, fiery winds, but you were terrified!
I'll show you the place where all the fallen heroes lie
Drink with them but lo! Be warned! You did not have to die
From the mountains to the sea our lost souls to retrieve
Hear the weep and hear the sigh, malignance and deceit.

From the ashes rise again, to the winds I have been sent
Hear the cry - hear the weep
Hear the sigh - here I sleep
Among the ashes of an ancient labyrinth

I am enthralled by sin, and I've been trusting him
The Id in me runs wild to the end of an ice cold time...

From the ashes rise again, to the winds I have been sent
Hear the cry - hear the weep
Hear the sigh - here I sleep
Among the ashes of an ancient labyrinth
