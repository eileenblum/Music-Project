Stand before the line
Stand before the line
Freed through emotions of greed
Stand before the line
Stand before the line
Stand before the line of fear

Cold at heart, cold in mind
Every night a different sky
You and me, finally
Shall we dance to eternity

Shall we dance
Shall we dance to the morning light?

I break the ice and time stands still
I overcome the iron will
Embrace the floods inside of me
The flowing waters set me free

Shall we dance to the morning light?
