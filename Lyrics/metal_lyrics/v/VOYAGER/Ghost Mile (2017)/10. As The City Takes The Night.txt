Hey, you over there in instant daylight
Oh, won't you start the bleed?
Oh no, you're not aware of the twilight?
Just make sure you don't leave anything for me

Mind the stifling breeze
So long, too long, too long, along aside
And you don't forget to breathe
So long, too long, too long, along aside
Focus on the lights
The one, the one, the one, the wonder
As the city takes the night
We run, we run, we run, we run through the night

710 too late increase the margin of our sacred morning
It's the dawning of a mindfulnessless decimal affair
As the saying goes this all goes without saying or a warning
And the promise of less comfort is the dawn above the stairs

Mind the stifling breeze
So long, too long, too long, along aside
And you don't forget to breathe
So long, too long, too long, along aside
Focus on the lights
The one, the one, the one, the wonder
As the city takes the night
We run, we run, we run, we run through the night

Mind the stifling breeze
And you don't forget to breathe
Focus on the lights
The one, the one, the one, the wonder
As the city takes the night
We run, we run, we run, we run through the night

[2x]
As the city takes the night
We run, we run, we run, we run through the night
