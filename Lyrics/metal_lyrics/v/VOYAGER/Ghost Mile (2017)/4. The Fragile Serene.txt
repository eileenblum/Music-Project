Don't tell a soul
Keep on the low
They'll never know
That we're not from here

Try not to sigh
We're on the line
Where we are now is the fragile serene

The secret life
The secret soul
Two worlds apart
Two worlds to grow
It's easy for the one who tried
Still easy when you say it right

â¦to sedate
Aim to elate
Don't scratch the door
That was open before

Hold on tight
Don't let them see the bare
Scars of mine
And hide the cracks in the
Perfect life
Avert the stare of the
Ceiling light
Until it burns my eyes

Until the sunlight burns our eyes
Until the sunlight burns our eyes
Until the sunlight burns our eyes
Until the morning we'll survive

Until the daylight breaks the night
Until the morning we'll survive on silence and we run for miles
And we exchange the secrets
And the senses burn before our eyes

Until the sunlight burns our eyes
Until the sunlight burns our eyes
Until the sunlight burns our eyes
Until the morning we'll survive
