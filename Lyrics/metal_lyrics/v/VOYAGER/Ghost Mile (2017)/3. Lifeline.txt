Come feel at ease among the tired minds of the day
Fall onto your knees before the new horizon array
Set your only pace at what you need
At what you can and everybody can wait

'Cause it is always the same sun that shines

This, the modern dream, the modern life
The modern I and only I will decide, I will abide
Time date for the lifeline and a score and a sign
And I saw all the lights flash straight in your eyes

But it is always the same sun that shines
And it is always the same sun that shines
And it isâ¦

So demure
Among the southern skies
It's the tide, it's the warmth
It's the final paradise

And it is always the same sun that shines [3x]
