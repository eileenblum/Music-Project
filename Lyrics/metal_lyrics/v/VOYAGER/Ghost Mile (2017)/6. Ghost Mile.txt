I get that sense that when we look around
This is gonna be less than easy
I get so tense when we are falling in
And it won't be a solid landing
Oh, no! We are the only ones around
Well, that we know of now
Oh? Did we just walk the golden mile
With our heads held high?

[2x]
Gently
Forward on empty
March in a straight line
In a confined mind

And we walking the ghost mile
To war!
And we are walking the long stretch home
And we are sinking the first smile
To war!
And we are drowning the norm

This is the death of me
This is the death of me
This is the death of me
This is the constantly

[2x]
Gently
Forward on empty
March in a straight line
In a confined mind
