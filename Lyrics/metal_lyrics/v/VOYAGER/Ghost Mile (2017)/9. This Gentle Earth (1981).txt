One night
On this gentle Earth
One night
For this nightmare search
So I'm born into a softened life
And the dreamers keep the dream alive

One night
In a bright-eyed haze
One night
In a warm embrace
So I'm searching for a trial by fire
And the dreamers keep the dark alive

[2x]
And I have never seen this side of me
And I have never been so beside of me
And I have never felt so alien
And oh I know it's meant to be

And I knowâ¦
And I knowâ¦
And I knowâ¦

This time
I will talk the line
This time
I will say it's right
We are born into a softened life
And we take it in our stride

[2x]
And I have never seen this side of me
And I have never been so beside of me
And I have never felt so alien

[2x]
And I have never felt
And I have never felt
And I have never felt so alien
And I have never felt
And I have never felt
And I have never felt so alien
So alien

So alien
So alien
