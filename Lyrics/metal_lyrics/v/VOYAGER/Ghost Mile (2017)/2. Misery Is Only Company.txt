Oh and I see and I know
And suddenly I'm on my own
But it's now and it's no
At least it isn't tomorrow

Suddenly
Sudden low
Sudden higher
And I know
That it's you
That it's me in misery's company

It's a ceremony
Of our serendipity
And you go and you know
And suddenly you take control

Suddenly
Sudden low
Sudden higher
And I know
That it's you
And misery's company

These intentions of yours are lost inside of the silent core
And so I'm standing here just waiting for more
And so I'm standing here just waiting for more
And so I've told you many times before
These intentions of me are lost inside of the silent seas
And misery is only company
And misery is only company

Suddenly
Sudden low
Suddenly
Sudden low
Suddenly I'm on my own

Oh and I know
And suddenly I'm on my own
But it's now and it's no
At least it isn't tomorrow

It's a ceremony
Of our serendipity
And you go and you know
And suddenly you take on

Only the morning the sky so clear and
I'm sorry that I have been so hard on my
Slowly decision-based morality
And so needy for an escape

These intentions of yoursâ¦
These intentions of yoursâ¦

These intentions of yours are lost inside of the silent core
And so I'm standing here just waiting for more
And so I'm standing here just waiting for more
And so I've told you many times before
These intentions of me are lost inside of the silent seas
And misery is only company
And misery is only company
