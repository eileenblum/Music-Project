Open eyes
The line of sight
Is clear in mind
Ascension
Covers pulled
One minute cloud the cold
The warmth deserves
A mention

You know it's far
You know it's far to go
You know it's not hard
You know it's not hard to uncover

We've been told to take the road
But that road is unprotected
And we are cold and we admit
We'd much rather be defectors

It's far to go
We've said it for too long
So far to fall
We're going it alone
Each day a saint
To make it through the core
No self-restraint
We're going it alone

Sunlight shine
And so I close my eyes
Sunlight's mine
And so I shut the blinds
Warmth from them
Prefer the warmth from within
High hopes dream
And so I fall asleep

So I fall asleep

It's far to go [4x]

It's far to go
We've said it for too long
So far to fall
We're going it alone
Each day a saint
To make it through the core
No self-restraint
We're going it alone
