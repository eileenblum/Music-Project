Beneath the fragrance
Insipid agents
Above the waters
Misleading portals
There's no policing
Apparent reason
Supposed musing
We're all just losing

Joined, you are connected
Yearning affection
Yet disaffected
By division starting to unfold

Better secession
It is the fashion
Of the nation to excision of itself again

Birds of a feather
Stand on the tether
Morning has broken
And they have spoken too soon

Take a hand
And sit and wait for the years of our unity to dissipate
And I sit and I watch the crowd rule over me
And I rot to the core while they devour me
And I sit and I waitâ¦

[3x]
You are so in time that we're sometimes disconnected
When you fall in line you offend the disaffected

Disconnected
It's a sign of my obsession
You are soâ¦
You are soâ¦

Beneath the fragrance
Insipid agents
Above the waters
Misleading portals
There's no policing
Apparent reason
Supposed musing
We're all just losing
