Here I go again
Here I forget
It's time to bring all your fears
It is time for regrets

Wake up and smell the pain
In every moment it bleeds the same
Or is this something I've always known
To be too far away?

And so I think to myself
What a wonderful
Tell myself
What a wonderful
Force myself
What a wonderful day

Here we go again
Smile and pretend
It's time to be friendly, happy
It's time to be friends

Oh, wake up and feel the rain
I know it's going to taste the same
Or is this something I've always known
To be just out of reach?

And so I think to myself
What a wonderful
Tell myself
What a wonderful
Force myself
What a wonderful day

What a wonderful day
What a wonderful day	

And so I think to myself
What a wonderful
Tell myself
What a wonderful
Force myself
What a wonderful day
