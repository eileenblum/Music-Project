Waterfall
See how the waters fall
They soar into your soul

And you must try to stay inside your

Own abode
Just don't become to slow
Don't let it overflow
Just keep your insides safe and warm

Keep it strong
Keep it true
To yourself, don't you lose

Don't give up, don't give in
To pressure of sin
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

(So leave them all, so leave them all, so leave them all to tell the)
Tales of your life
(And tell me why, and tell me why you'd take the journey to the)
Land of the lies
(I'll never fear, I'll never fear, I'll never fear my life)
