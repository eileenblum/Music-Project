Why am I always feeling so dissatisfied?
Why am I always feeling like I'm not alive?

I can't begin to think what's on the other side
A realm of possibilities is open wide

I know that I don't belong there
I know that I can't keep longing
Take me to the other side...

So take me...

Straight to the other, straight to the other side
Can you feel me dragging?

[Russian transcription:]
Pechal'no ya glyazhu na nashe pokolen'e!
Ego gryadushchee -- il' pusto, il' temno,
Mezh tem, pod bremenem poznan'ya i somnen'ya
V bezdejstvii sostaristya ono.
Bogaty my, edva iz kolybeli,
Oshibkami otcov i pozdnim ih unom,
I zhizn' uzh nas tomit, kak rovnyj put'bez celi,
kak pir na prazdnike chuzhom.

Straight to the other, straight to the other side

So why won't let you me?

Straight to the other, straight to the other side
Where it's so much better

Straight to the other, straight to the other side
Won't you come with me tonight?
