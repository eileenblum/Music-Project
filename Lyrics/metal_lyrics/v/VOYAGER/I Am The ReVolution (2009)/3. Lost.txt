Once again I am walking down the crowded path
Windows telling me to the cry in the aftermath

My brain is overflowing
First signs of madness showing now!

I am lost
in this world of sensation
I am lost
in the overflow
I am lost
in the information

I am lost
so I'm laying low

So I cover my ears but still I'm hearing the sound
Won't anymore sleep until I drown?

My brain is overflowing
Second signs of madness showing now!
