Don't you care what you're doin' to you
That the life you dead
Is a life that I'd live for the last time

Listen closely to the sound of your heartbeat stalling

So remember the words of the state
When it promised your fate
When it said it would send you a lifeline

When it said it would send you a lifeline calling

I can help you live your life
I can bring you everything you want so come and...

Tell me the story of the man on the run
So I can steal all the glory and still be the one
I haven't found a solution to what you have done
I'll find a new resolution!
I'm on the run from the world!

Don't you care what you're doin' to you
That the life you lead
Is a life that you'd live for the last time

Listen closely to the sound of your heartbeat stalling
