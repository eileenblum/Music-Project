Through foreign lands
we ride a million miles an hour
Adapting to the fate we think is in our hands

Yet we're afraid
Is it too late?
One step closer to now...

And we are singing this song of praise
For something we have lost
For something we have found
For all our wishes on this common ground

For something we must give
For something we must live
For all the tears and loneliness we found

On this common ground
Beneath the newest star we try
When the silence sounds
Adapting to the fateful lie
