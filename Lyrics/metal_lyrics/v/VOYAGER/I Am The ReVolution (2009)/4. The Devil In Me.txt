Can you look in my eyes?
Again you find me emotionless
The blood is cold in my veins
I don't respond to your sweet caress

[Chorus:]
Oh I wish I knew how it must feel
I am not the only one
I am just the devil's son
I feel the light of day again
I am not the only one
Taking cover from the sun
I walk the night and sing
I am just the devil in me [x5]

I taste your love on my lips
I smell your neck and it makes me weak
These frozen tears in my eyes
As I return to my daylight sleep

[Chorus]

It's just the... devil in me

I am not the only one
I am just the devil's son
I feel the light of day again
I'm not the only one
Taking cover from the sun
I walk the night and sing

Again you look into my eyes
I'm just the devil in me
Again you make my lose my mind
I'm just the devil in me

Again you look into my eyes
It's just the devil in me
Again you make me realize
It's just the devil in me
