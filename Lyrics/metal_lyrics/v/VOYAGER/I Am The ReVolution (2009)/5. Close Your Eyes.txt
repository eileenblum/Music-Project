Time, they say that it heals all the wounds

And they say it will be over soon
But the lines on my face are a sign of the times

They make scars on your heart disappear
They pretend that there's hope and no fear
They are trying to cover the face of the times

I'm standing here
I'm standing here
I'm faced with careless ego stares

I try to wash away the lines of life

Close, close your eyes
Close, close your eyes

I can now see your pain

In your imagination
I can now see the strain
and your exasperation

I can now see all your grief
And your devolution

I cannot see relief
In your absolution
