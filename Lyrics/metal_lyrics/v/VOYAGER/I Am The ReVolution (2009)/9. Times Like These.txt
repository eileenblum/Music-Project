Close all the doors
We cannot live an open life any more
The threat of action is too much to ignore
Don't try to tell me this has happened before

Don't try to tell me I'm a sucker for more

I voted so I'm gonna fight in this war
I'm gonna stay inside, my ears to the wall
I'm gonna give it up to settle the score

I'm gonna give it my life, give it my all
Give it my heart, give it my soul

I tell you

I'll throw my mind to the seas
In times like these
In times like these

I got my rights
And I don't know where I'm goin'
I got my rights
And I don't know where I am
