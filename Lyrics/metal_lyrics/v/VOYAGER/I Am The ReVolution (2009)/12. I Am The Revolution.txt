I am the revolution
I give it all my heart
This is the right solution
Tear it all apart

Round and round
as the silence sounds
and the world goes round
I will understand

Choice is mine
and it's not a crime

and I have the time
that it's in my hands

Round and round
as the silence sounds
and the world goes round
I will understand

Take this doubt figure out the sound
Understand this revolution of man

This revolution of man

I am the revolution
I give it all my heart
This is the right solution
Tear it all apart
