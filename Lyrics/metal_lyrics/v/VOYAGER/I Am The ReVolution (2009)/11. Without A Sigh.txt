I have seen the open door
I have felt the only chore is keeping me alive
Without a sigh

I have seen it once before
I'm not going to ask for more
Without a sigh

Is this the life?
Are you walking the night?
Are you going my way any more?

Is this the time?
Is it all in my mind
Are you going my way any more?
