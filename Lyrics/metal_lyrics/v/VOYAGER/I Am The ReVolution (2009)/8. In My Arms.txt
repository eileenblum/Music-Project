And she weeps
Now she's laughing
Then she sights
Into my arms

Then she looks
Then she pauses
And she knows just what's to come

As I feel you in my arms
This will never heal my scars
Cause you'll never be so far from home again

So she tries
So she's holding onto what she had to give

Now she leaves
Now she holds me

as she weeps into my arms

And she weeps
Now she's laughing
Then she sights
Into my arms

Then she looks
Then she pauses
And she knows just what's to come
