[Vinnie Vincent]

Sun sets low and the bitches brew
Love kicks - it makes me black and blue
I want it - I need it - I love it to the core
Backstreet pussycat - whats behind your door

Shoot U full of love

Tough girls never break their cool
Rough boys know their the ones who rule
I wanna lick your fire - burn you inside
Live the sin inject me in
Pleasure whip me blind
Shoot U full of love
Tonight you're all I wanna own
I'll disconnect my telephone

[Chorus]
Shoot U full of love
Shoot U full of my love
Shoot ya Shoot ya shoot you full of my love

At the speed of sound
She drives me insane
Turn me on break my candy cane

Sweet talk will get you action all the time
I want it rough I can't get enough
Pleasure whip me blind
Shoot U full of love
Tonight you're all I wanna own
I'll disconnect my telephone

[Chorus]
Shoot U full of love
Shoot U full of my love
Shoot ya Shoot ya shoot you full of my love

[Solo]

Lose your head on the guillotine
Make my bed blow me to smithereens
Tonight you're all I wanna own
I'll disconnect my telephone
Shoot U full of love

[Chorus]
Shoot U full of love
Shoot U full of my love
Shoot ya Shoot ya shoot you full of my love
