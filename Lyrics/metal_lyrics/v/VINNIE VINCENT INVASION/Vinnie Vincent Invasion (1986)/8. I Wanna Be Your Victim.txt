[Vinnie Vincent]

All pumped up and nowhere to go
Bound for love, I submit my soul
Make me do my penance, make me pay the toll
Suck my will, swallow me whole
Captured by the huntress
Goddess of my flesh and all of my dreams
Spread me eagle - have no mercy
Make me writhe in ecstasy

[Chorus]
I wanna be
I wanna be your victim
Never set me free
I wanna be 
I wanna be your victim
Take every part of me

Tie me up, punish me please
Make me beg on my hands and knees
I'll be your slave, serve all your needs
A helpless minx to torment and tease
No rules of love forbidden
No violation zone
No secrets to be hidden
(I'm) your domain to own

[Chorus]
I wanna be
I wanna be your victim
Never set me free
I wanna be 
I wanna be your victim
Take every part of me

[Solo]

[Bridge]
I want it, I need it, I crave it, I plead it
Love and hate, penetrate, dominate, incinerate
I'm dreaming, screaming, girl you got me creaming

[Chorus]
I wanna be
I wanna be your victim
Never set me free
I wanna be 
I wanna be your victim
Take every part of me
