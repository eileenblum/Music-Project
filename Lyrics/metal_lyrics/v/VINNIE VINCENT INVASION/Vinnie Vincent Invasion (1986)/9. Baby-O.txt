[Vinnie Vincent]

Your a double-barrel cardiac arrest
She-demon, I see right through your dress
A fox, love toy, she's candy sweet
Hot little strutter, wild bitch in heat
Mercy angel, voodoo child
You gimme fever, you're driving me wild

[Chorus]
Baby-O, Baby-O, I
Baby-O, Baby-O, I
Baby, I'm on fire for you

Metalic angel workin' that midnight run
Pull the trigger, pistol-whip me
With your pleasure gun
Let your honey drip down on me
With a passion so willing, so wicked and free
Spread your love and make my dreams come true
Like wild fire, I'm burnin' for you

[Chorus]
Baby-O, Baby-O, I
Baby-O, Baby-O, I
Baby, I'm on fire for you

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Baby-O, Baby-O, I
Baby-O, Baby-O, I
Baby, I'm on fire for you
