[Vinnie Vincent]

Aliens have landed, in my mind they stay
I've been damned, I never see the light of day
(Declared insane and locked away)
I'm so confused, I'm drowning in a sea of haze
My mind is numb, I'm overdosed, I'm D.O.A
Stand accused on judgement day
I feel my mind disintegrate in blistering pain
Melting me and sucking me right down the drain

[Chorus]
Twisted... In is out and 6 is 9
Twisted... I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Twisted... A spider's running up my spine
I'm going blind

Life's a blur, one things for sure
It hurts my brain
I've been cursed
I don't even know my name
I'm twisted like a hurricane

Once so young and innocent and right as rain
Blood has turned as cold as steel
Ice fills my veins
I've had my fill of all the pain
A million voices thundering inside my brain
No victory to claim
My state of mind remains

[Chorus]
Twisted... In is out and 6 is 9
Twisted... I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Twisted... A spider's running up my spine
I'm going blind

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Twisted... In is out and 6 is 9
Twisted... I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Twisted... A spider's running up my spine
I'm going blind
