[Vinnie Vincent and R. Freeman]

[Vinnie:]
Someone has taken your love, its true isn't it?
Its not just talk that I hear
And when I see him build his wall around you
[Robert:]
I know the end is near

Tell me that I'm wrong
And it's all in my mind
You've known all along
And it just makes my blood run wild
And I'm dying

[Chorus]
So I'm back
Back on the streets
Yes, I'm back to find somebody new
I'm back
I'm back on the streets
Girl, I'm back and I'm over you

[Vinnie:]
I've lost your love girl
And all that I live for
I see it in your eyes
[Robert:]
And when I see you walking out that door girl
Another part of me dies

It's time to move on
And I know it for sure
The feeling is gone
And I won't be hurt anymore
And I'm not going to fall

[Chorus]
So I'm back
Back on the streets
Yes, I'm back to find somebody new
I'm back
I'm back on the streets
Girl, I'm back and I'm over you

[Solo]

[Chorus]
So I'm back
Back on the streets
Yes, I'm back to find somebody new
I'm back
I'm back on the streets
Girl, I'm back and I'm over you
