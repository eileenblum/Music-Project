[Vinnie Vincent and Robert Fleischman]

You fired the first shot without fair warning
Love's silver bullet throught the heart
Shell shocked, you brought me to my knees...I've fallen
All is fair in love and war
I kissed your lips and heard the siren's call
Into your spider's web I fall

Onto the battlefield of lust we thunder
Like titans clashing through the night
Over who will wear the crown of passion
Let flesh and fantasy begin
Let pain and pleasure be our only sin
Let your heaven burn to take me in

[Chorus]
Invasion! That's how you come on to me
Invasion! You were armed with ecstasy
Invasion! You claim your victory
Invasion! Your love has conquered me

A lonely hunter in disguise, she's a killer
She breaks the silence of the night
And she uses all nine lives to stalk her prey:then she strikes
And like a thorn you leave your sting
You shoot your arrow with cupid's wing
I feel the rush of heat your touch can bring

[Chorus]
Invasion! That's how you come on to me
Invasion! You were armed with ecstasy
Invasion! You claim your victory
Invasion! Your love has conquered me

[Bridge]
Hot blooded combat got my back against the wall
Hand to hand, soul to soul, red lights flash
And the winner takes all

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Invasion! That's how you come on to me
Invasion! You were armed with ecstasy
Invasion! You claim your victory
Invasion! Your love has conquered me
