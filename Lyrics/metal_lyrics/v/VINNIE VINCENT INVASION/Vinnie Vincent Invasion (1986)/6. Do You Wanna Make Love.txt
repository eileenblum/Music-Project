[Vinnie Vincent and Robert Fleischman]

She fell from the heavens like a fireball
Introduced the devil to fire
Just one little lick and you want it all
Lust, worship and desire

If you wanna go to heaven there's a price you gotta pay
I'll show you just what dreams are made of
A fine little line between pleasure and pain
You know she could have been a saviour

[Bridge]
When she stripped off her sweet little innocence
She stole my breath away
With a rocket in my pocket
I just had one thing to say

[Chorus]
Do you wanna make love
Do you wanna make love
Do you wanna make love

Backwards and forwards in sheer delight
What feeds the fire in you
Like a locomotive moving in the heat of the night
I took a trip and never left the room

I'm a sacrificial lamb on the alter of desire
You got me clutching for a cross
Yeah, the voodoo that you do is lifting me higher
All my senses have been lost

[Bridge]
When she stripped off her sweet little innocence
She stole my breath away
With a rocket in my pocket
I just had one thing to say

[Chorus]
Do you wanna make love
Do you wanna make love
Do you wanna make love

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Do you wanna make love
Do you wanna make love
Do you wanna make love
