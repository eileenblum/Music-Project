[Vinnie Vincent]

Well, I'm a sex-shooter
Hot teaser
Love pleaser
Got a lust that kills

Got a reputation
From town to town
We fight to win
We'll take you to a higher ground

We stand united, nobody falls
No more backs against the wall

[Chorus]
The boyz are gonna rock "Gonna rock"
We're never gonna stop
The boyz are gonna rock "Gonna rock"
We'll take it to the top "Gonna rock"
Until the day we drop
The boyz are gonna rock

Well, we burn our cages
We're outragous
Runnin' rabid
We're the hounds of hell
Been raped and branded
Left stranded
In the back alleys
Where the street dogs dwell

Like an animal
We break the jungle rules
Fight fire with fire
And die before we lose

We stand united, nobody falls
No more backs against the wall

[Chorus]
The boyz are gonna rock "Gonna rock"
We're never gonna stop
The boyz are gonna rock "Gonna rock"
We'll take it to the top "Gonna rock"
Until the day we drop
The boyz are gonna rock

[Solo]

[Bridge]
We take our stand
We raise our fist
We hail to the rock brigade
The street boys on a rampage
Got a fire burnin' in my veins
The wilds howlin' out my name

[Chorus]
The boyz are gonna rock "Gonna rock"
We're never gonna stop
The boyz are gonna rock "Gonna rock"
We'll take it to the top "Gonna rock"
Until the day we drop
The boyz are gonna rock

[Solo]
