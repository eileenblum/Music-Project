[Vinnie Vincent]

Hey metal leather cathouse queen
Love sugar she's dynamite
Hot little pistol, living dream
A bad misses she's skin tight

No, she's never been, no she'll never be
Daddy's little girl
Little vixen take your whip and tease me
Pour the cream upon my burns

[Chorus]
I wanna Love - I wanna Love - I wanna Love
That's naughty, naughty
I wanna naughty, naughty, naughty,
Naughty, naughty love
I wanna love that's naughty

Hey aphrodite pretty please
Be cruel when you walk that walk
Miss mighty love drop me to my knees
I melt down when you talk that talk

She's got a love like no other love
She'll steel your breath away
Hurricane Jane give me novocain
You're driving me insane

[Chorus]
I wanna Love - I wanna love -
I've been looking for you
Naughty, naughty
I wanna naughty, naughty, naughty,
Naughty, naughty love
I wanna *$$@ that's naughty naughty
Oh hey there little miss naughty girl
Such a naughty naughty girl
Such a naughty naughty girl, I wanna love,
I wanna love

My little raven she's back in black
Dressed To Kill she's a heart attack
Pandora's box just cracked
All hell's breaking loose - no turning back
Ready or not oh no here I come

I knew when I saw you back stage
That you were for me and I was for you
You're my naughty, naughty, naughty...
