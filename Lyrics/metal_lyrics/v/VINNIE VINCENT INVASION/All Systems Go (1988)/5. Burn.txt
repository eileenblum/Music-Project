[Vinnie Vincent]

Burn little star our time is here
Yeah, I got my wheels of fire shifting into gear
I'm an easy rider looking for somebody new
I'm a hot rocket aiming straight for you

Rev on the red line
The revolution's high
You've got me snow blind
As your sirens softly sing me to your fire

[Chorus]
Burn
Baby burn
Burn
I'm on fire - burning for you baby
Burn
I'm on fire

Prowling hotter than a funeral pyre
I'm spellbound as I cruise the velvet night
Well, my blood's so hot I could set
The night on fire
Oh - I love - I love -I love - I dream
About the things I wanna do to you baby

Oh she's a live wire
Like dynamite - she's TNT
Oh she's love power
I can feel her kiss of fire melting me

[Repeat Chorus]
