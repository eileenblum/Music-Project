[Vinnie Vincent]

She's the kind of girl that I love to love
The angel's sacred mystery
Heaven sent from up above
She's a living fantasy

Poetry in motion she takes my breath away
And when I drink from her fountain of love
It taste sweeter more each day ooh baby

[Chorus]
Deeper and deeper - deep in love with you
Deeper and deeper - deep in love with you little girl

Lady love I know your name
You're always on my mind baby
Emotions that I just can't explain
It feels just like the first time

Heaven's chosen angel the answer to my prayers
I found a new kind of wonderful
The magic we share

[Chorus]

Deeper and deeper - deep inside my heart
Deeper and deeper - we're never going to stop fallin
Deeper and deeper - deep in love with you little girl
Deeper and deeper - deep in love with you

I know she loves me only
She's with nobody else
I never thought I'd feel this way
Words alone can't tell

[Chorus]
