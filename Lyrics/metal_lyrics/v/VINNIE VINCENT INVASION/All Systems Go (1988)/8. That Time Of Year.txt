Oh, I wanna stay girl it hurts I know
But the time has come to find my dreams of glory
It hasn't been easy babe - hard times we know
But I gotta know the ending of my story

Oh, it's my challenge, it's my right
And my will's too strong to fight
I don't wanna say goodbye cus I love you

Is that time, that time of year
To follow that midnight sun
Is that time, that time of year
My ramblin' heart's gotta run
Woo wooo yea

Wherever it takes me I'll ride that wind
To my rainbows end but I'll be back again
Woooo ooooooooh
I wanna hear you say it girl: that you understand
If I had my wish you'd be my side

Oh, it's my challenge, it's my right
And my will's too strong to fight
I don't wanna say goodbye cus I love you

Is that time, that time of year
To follow that midnight sun
Is that time, that time of year
My ramblin' heart's gotta run
Oooh yea

Oh, it's my challenge, it's my right
And my will's too strong to fight
I don't wanna say goodbye cus I love you

Is that time, that time of year
To follow that midnight sun
Is that time, that time of year
My ramblin' heart's gotta run
Here we goooooooooo yea

That time of year
I got to ramble
That time of year
Oooh you got to ramble
That time of year
Wooooo yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
