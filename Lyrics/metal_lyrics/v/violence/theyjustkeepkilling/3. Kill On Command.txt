am a Presidential toy 
And I am Government employed 
In their game of death I never lose 

And when I'm told to do a task 
No questions I will ask 
Just show me his file and rid that commie dead 

KILL ON COMMAND 
KILL ON COMMAND 

I will shoot from a distance 
It will kill you in an instant 
Not a drop of blood on my suit 

If I see you blink your eye 
Then surely you will die 
I'll be there and gone before you even twitch 

KILL ON COMMAND 
KILL ON COMMAND 

The blood I love the most 
Is from terrorists who boast 
Of their car bombs when our bombs 
Are bouncing off their heads 

With my crosshatch on his chest 
You could probably guess the rest 
When you see his lifeless body hit the street 

KILL ON COMMAND 
KILL ON COMMAND 

When I terminate these assholes 
And then bury them in deep holes 
I'm rewarded highly by my Government 

Yes my job I love to do 
And I'm doing it for you 
Killing for money it ain't a shame 

KILL ON COMMAND 
KILL ON COMMAND 

I shed no tears for the buried ones 
The ones I lay to rest 
Don't ever question why I kill 
Just know I do my best 

A million dollar - PAYCHECK 
I pull the trigger - BLOODSHED 
The bullet rips through - YOUR HEAD 

I've killed so many - TIMES BEFORE 
I've watched the bodies - HIT THE FLOOR 
I'm always needing - WANTING MORE 

I've dealt out death - SO MANY TIMES 
Only one thing running - THROUGH MY MIND 
Money, money, money, money - MONEY 

So when the file's being - PULLED ON YOU 
I tell you what you're - GONNA DO 
Stand still and make my job a little easier!
