Paraplegic man
Just let me take your hand
I'll drag you through the sand
My friends are all laughing with me

You useless piece of shit
How can you cope with it
To be locked up like that
Come play football with us

We'll make you understand
You cannot walk too good on land
We'll take your chair away
Nice guys we are all not

We've seen your kind before
You're always begging us for more
Do I look like a fucking bank?
Let's see Jerry foot the bill (you think he will?)

Innocently victimized
Your doctors always telling lies
But do you feel good?
Hell no I'd like to cut them down

To chop them at the legs
To see physicians in a blaze
I'd kill 'em if I could
Cynical boy that you are

You in your mental state
A devil no mistake
To kill off those you hate
The ones that are laughing at you

But now we're back again
Violent unfriendly friend your face
Our fist extends put you back in your place
We'll smash your fucking face

VIO-LENCE! Smashing your teeth right out of place
VIO-LENCE! My iron hand clenching your face

PARAPLEGIC! Locked tightly in your chair
PARAPLEGIC! Normal people love to stare
PARAPLEGIC! You better learn to keep a gun
PARAPLEGIC! 'cause we'll rip you off and run
