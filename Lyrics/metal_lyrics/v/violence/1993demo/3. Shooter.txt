My shuttered eyes a reflect from sound 
Inside my head it's going down 
So many times I've walked this course 
Turns out the same just like before 

I love your pain when what's done is done 
But I never see 'cause I turn and run 
Feel the lust burning inside 
Taking out some mother-fuckers tonight 

You're feeling the pain 
I make it so far from real 
You're dying, the pain 
Is something that you need to feel 

I'm drugged inside and feeling sick 
I lurk in nothing just keeping hid 
A mass abortion of what you adore 
You fuck with me and I'll severe the cord! 

The thrill, the kill, the lead of intent 
Direct from me 'cause I'm so fucking bent 
Feel the lust burning inside 
Taking out some mother-fuckers tonight 

You're feeling the pain 
I make it so far from real 
You're dying, the pain 
Is something that you need to feel 

Like creeps with bricks and fuck your brains 
These dogs on chains I wrap around your necks 
I strangle life from rage just kicked with hate 
The faggots of the day, as I so proudly say 

Just struggle for me, struggle for me... STRUGGLE!! 
To feed my wild craze I hammer back and blow your ass away! 

I've talked with Christ some thousand times 
Just never seem to get it right 
I scream for peace inside of the sin 
The fuckin' rape that lets me in 

A constant lie that keeps me on track 
As I shoot you in your fucking back 
Feel the lust burning inside 
Taking out some mother-fuckers tonight 

You're feeling the pain 
I make it so far from real 
You're dying, the pain 
Is something that you need to feel
