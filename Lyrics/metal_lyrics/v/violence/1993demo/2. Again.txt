It hunts you down you're an animal draped in shock 
You look around but you're blind a cat in the dark 
But you will never see the eyes look into to hell 
'cause when they're on'ya... it's fuckin' over! 

BUST OUT - And you're on the run again 
You're hunted down by the ones 
You thought were your friends 
The motherfuckers sold you out for dime-bags again 
You thought they loved'ya... they fuckin' hate you! 

Time that fills this place 
It constantly repeats 
For all your pain to feed 

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 

It circles back once more 
It's making you its whore 
It fucks and fucks some more 

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 

Like a rat creeping through the cracks in hell 
You're paralyzed by the fear you know you can smell 
It's something heavy ad it's crawling right up you're back 
You feel it on'ya... its claws are in'ya! 

PLUNGE IN - To your chest again 
The fist of fear is tearing you down to the end 
The blood flowing so warm to the touch 
The things you feel... keep concealed 

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 

It circles back once more 
It's making you its whore 
It fucks and fucks some more 

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 

It waits then feeds... Its scaled flesh 
It's hardly real... It's what it is! 
Master of slaves... Presented as GOD 
Self-proclaimed... It eats your dying brain!!! 

Fucked-up like a thousand times before 
Bloody-face kicked down into the floor 
Screams of this is all you ever will feel 
The sound is crushing... The pain is rushing 

One way is only way we'll go 
You've got to feel the ugliness as it flows 
Through your bones, your blood, your heart and your mind 
The things you feel... Keep concealed 

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 

It circles back once more 
It's making you its whore 
It fucks and fucks some more 

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
