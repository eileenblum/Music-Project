I'm trained for pain
Immenseful strain
Excruciation is my game 

Slice through your flesh
Defy me now
Feel the pain, knife driven down 

DRILL THROUGH YOUR TEETH
No novicane
The open nerves will drive you insane 

REMOVE FINGERNAILS
Needles impale
Acetylene torch, it never fails 

Regret the day
That you were born
Don't cry to me 'cause you were warned 

If you were caught
Cease to exist
The torturer, he adds you to his list 

COLD SHRIEKING LAUGH
Rips through your ears
Watch as he gets his kicks from fears 

DESTRUCTION SOURCE
Ruthless and vain
Once more it's time for you to 

FEEL THE PAIN - Open nerves deliver
TORTURED AGAIN - Scream out for death
YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE - My hell-like chamber
YOU NEVER WILL BREATHE - The outside air 

Bring in the kids
Your boys and girls
Your daughters and sons, it's them we'll kill 

Killed whether or not
You start to talk
Bonus body killed to rot 

PENDULUM SWINGS
Swings right through you
When I return, you will be in two 

"C" CLAMP YOUR HEAD
Pressure force fed
Look in my eyes you will see blood red 

Break kneecaps
Left then the right
Next your eyeballs lose your sight 

Now do you want
to lose your face
Scalpel in hand I pick the place 

ONE SIMPLE SLICE
Your skin removed
Slow breathing skull, the blood starts to drool 

YOU UNDERSTAND
This is no game
When withholding the truth you must always 

FEEL THE PAIN - Open nerves deliver
TORTURED AGAIN - Scream out for death
YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE - My hell-like chamber
YOU NEVER WILL BREATHE - The outside air 

A CRUSHING BLOW - To your head it begins to bleed
YOU TELL US NOW - The information that we need
YOUR LITTLE GIRL - Hey we're got her just down the hall
YOU HEAR HER SCREAM - Hey fucker do you hear her call you DADDY! 

A CRUSHING BLOW - To your head it begins to bleed
YOU TELL US NOW - The information that we need
YOUR LITTLE GIRL - Hey we're got her just down the hall
YOU HEAR HER SCREAM - Hey fucker do you hear her call you DADDY! 

HAUNTING - Terror controlling mind, easily
YOU'RE WATCHING - Torture tactics grind relentlessly on you 

PRESSURE - Constantly applied, tragically
SO PAINFUL - Fear pours from your eyes, pathetically you will die
