In the heart of sadness, there's a soul to take
Burning like the fires of Hell,
calling out the fakes

I won't make a sound
You will scream out loud
I won't make a sound
You will scream

When the world comes crashing down
Hell on Earth
Hell on Earth will call the crowds
When the world comes crashing down
Hell on Earth will call the crowds
and you will scream my name

In the eyes of madness, only time will tell
Ticking like a time bomb baby, in the hands of Hell

I won't make a sound
You will scream out loud
I won't make a sound
You will scream

When the world comes crashing down
Hell on Earth
Hell on Earth will call the crowds
When the world comes crashing down
Hell on Earth will call the crowds
and you will scream my name

And God can't save you
Can't save you now
[x2]

In the heart of sadness, there's a soul to take
Burning like the fires of Hell,
calling out the fakes

I won't make a sound
You will scream out loud
I won't make a sound
You will scream

When the world comes crashing down
Hell on Earth
Hell on Earth will call the crowds
When the world comes crashing down
Hell on Earth will call the crowds
and you will scream my name

When the world comes crashing down
Hell on Earth will call the crowds
and you will scream my name
