Commercialism, violence and cocaine
In a prayer to vanquish your God
I'll be the voice that answers
Screaming bullshit from the top of my lungs

I won't be your Barbie doll
Your fascist heroin
We're the mass homicide
The anti-cool kids

Do you want to be hateful?
Then put your faith in the government
Do you want to faithful?
Praying God just to let you in

Deformation of the body imposes
False addictions so you're not a slob
I'll be the voice of reason
Screaming bullshit from the top of my lungs

I won't be your plastic doll
Your fucking heroin
We're the mass homicide
The anti-cool kids

Do you want to be hateful?
Then put your faith in the government
Do you want to be faithful?
Paying God just to let you in

Do you want to be faithful?
Do you want to be hateful?
[x2]

Paying God just to let you in

I won't be your Barbie doll
Your fascist heroin
We're the mass homicide
The anti-cool kids

I won't be your plastic doll
Your fucking heroin
We're the mass homicide
The anti-cool kids

Do you want to be hateful?
Then put your faith in the government
Do you want to be faithful?
Paying God just to let you in
