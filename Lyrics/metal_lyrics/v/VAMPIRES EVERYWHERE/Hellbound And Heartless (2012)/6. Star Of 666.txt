Like a mechanical God
You walk the boulevard
The smell of death in your hair
You smile like a teenage antichrist
With blood on both of your hands

You are the fallen
Of demon birth
You are the fallen
In the Devil's church

You are the Star of 666
You are the model of I don't give a shit
You lick the crucifix
Star of 666

Burn, motherfucker, burn [x4]

Like a maniacal bride
You offer suicide
The only simple way out
You smile like a teenage antichrist
With blood all over your mouth

You are the fallen
Of demon birth
You are the fallen
In the Devil's church

You are the Star of 666
You are the model of I don't give a shit
You lick the crucifix
Star of 666

Burn, motherfucker, burn [x4]

Now put your hands in the air
and bow before your queen
Say your prayers [x3]

Now put your hands in the air
and bow before your queen
Say your prayers [x3]

You are the Star of 666
You are the model of I don't give a shit
You lick the crucifix
Star of 666

Burn, motherfucker, burn [x4]

You are the Star of 666
