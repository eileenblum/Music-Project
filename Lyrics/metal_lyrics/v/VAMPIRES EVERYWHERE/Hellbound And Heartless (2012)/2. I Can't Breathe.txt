I tore my eyes out
I slit my wrist to breathe
decapitating every single motion
only to fall to my knees
I'm not a spectacle
I'm not alright
I'm not a fucking joke
I'm not alright

I tore my eyes out
I slit my wrist to breathe
Call me pathetic and torture me
cause In my mind I can't breathe

(I tore my eyes out
I slit my wrist to breathe)

I'm suffocating every single notion
forcing me down to my knees
I am so sacrilegious I am the whore
I'm not the superficial one you adore

I'm not a spectacle
I'm not alright
I'm not a fucking joke
I'm not alright

I tore my eyes out
I slit my wrist to breathe
Call me pathetic and torture me
cause In my mind I can't breathe

You spit your insults force suicide
I spit your insults into your eyes
You spit your insults force suicide
I spit your insults into your eyes

I'm not a spectacle
I'm not alright
I'm not a fucking joke
I'm not alright

I tore my eyes out
I slit my wrist to breathe
Call me pathetic and torture me
cause In my mind I can't breathe

I tore my eyes out
