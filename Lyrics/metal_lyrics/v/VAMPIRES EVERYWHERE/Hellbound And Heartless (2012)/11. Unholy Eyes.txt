It's like a piece of string
Torn apart by the smallest teeth
Can't you hear it scream? Just like a porno movie

How did we get here tonight? An inch short of suicide
When did you change inside of me? Beautiful unholy eyes

It's like a horror scene. Fake desires and bloody sheets
Can't you hear it scream? Just like a porno movie

How did we get here tonight? An inch short of suicide
When did you change inside of me? Beautiful unholy eyes

It's like a horror scene [x2]

How did we get here tonight? An inch short of suicide
When did you change inside of me? Beautiful unholy

Unholy eyes [x4]
Beautiful unholy eyes
