She's an advocate of total destruction
She'll spit in your face
Like a suicidal plague of seduction
She puts you in your place

She's like a serial killer holding onto grace
It's just her mild dysfunction and her pretty face

She won't be satisfied until your heart is in her hands
She has a kiss of death and a keen fashion sense

She's a paradox of epic proportion
She's the girl you hate
But her eyes force total seduction
She puts you in your place

She's like a serial killer holding onto grace
It's just her mild dysfunction and her pretty face

She won't be satisfied until your heart is in her hands
She has a kiss of death and a keen fashion sense

Now twitch a little, twist a little bit
Tingle slowly on the Devil's bed
[x3]

She won't be satisfied until your heart is in her hands
She has a kiss of death and a keen fashion sense
[x2]
