We're the Jesus Christ,
we're the poltergeist
With lips like the Devil
We're the cheater wife,
we're the Devil's eyes
With a pitchfork to take your life

Drugs
Sex
Violence

Yeah, we are the prostitutes of anti-hate
And we're the best sex, baby

We're the cure for hate,
we're the perfect rape
Of American values
We're the secret spit,
we're the hypocrites
Of the churches divine salvation

Drugs
Sex
and
Violence

Yeah, we are the prostitutes of anti-hate
And we're the best sex, baby
[x2]

We're the Jesus Christ,
we're the poltergeist
With lips like the Devil
We're the cheater wife,
we're the Devil's eyes
With a pitchfork to take your life

Drugs
Sex
and
Violence

Yeah, we are the prostitutes of anti-hate
And we're the best sex, baby
[x3]
