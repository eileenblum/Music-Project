Hater, hater, fake a flower for a whore
Ha Ha Ha, who could ask for me?
[x4]

I am your God, I am your heart
I am the Devil in disguise

Hater, hater, fake a flower for a whore
Ha Ha Ha, who could ask for me?
[x2]

Where you run to
You can't hide
Mark of the beast

Are you coming out tonight?
To fuck the world
Social suicide
Are you coming out to fight?
We're a new breed baby
Social suicide

I am your savior, I am your limb
I am the product of your sin

Hater, hater, fake a flower for a whore
Ha Ha Ha, who could ask for me?
[x2]

Where you run to
You can't hide
Mark of the beast

Are you coming out tonight?
To fuck the world
Social suicide
Are you coming out to fight?
We're a new breed baby
Social suicide

Where you run to
You can't hide
Mark of the beast

Are you coming out tonight?
To fuck the world
Social suicide
Are you coming out to fight?
We're a new breed baby
Social suicide [x2]
