She's like a stained glass mirror that distorts your eyes
She's a catalyst of mutilating sacrifice

She's a beauty queen
From a dirty scene
Her eyes will hypnotize
She's a rock 'n roll
Tragedy in disguise

I'm a dirty angel [x2]

She's like a rainbow painted black and white
She's a pyro burning everything in sight

She's a beauty queen
From a dirty scene
Her eyes will hypnotize
She's a rock 'n roll
Tragedy in disguise [x2]

I'm a dirty angel [x2]

Can't you see me?
Don't you want me?
Can't you see me now?

Can't you see me?
Don't you want me?
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me now?

She's a beauty queen
From a dirty scene
Her eyes will hypnotize
She's a rock 'n roll
Tragedy in disguise

She's a beauty queen
From a dirty scene
Her eyes will hypnotize
She's a rock 'n roll
Tragedy in disguise

She's a beauty queen
From a dirty scene
[x2]
