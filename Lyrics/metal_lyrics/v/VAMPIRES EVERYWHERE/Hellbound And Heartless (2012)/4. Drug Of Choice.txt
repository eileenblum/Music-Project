[Verse 1:]
I know you want me
Sex drugs mutilation thrills
Worms in a box choke purple pills
Choose me, I can be your whore
I am the creator
I am the faker
I am poison born

[Chorus x2:]
I know you want me
I know you need me
I am your drug of choice

[Refrain x3:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I donât blame you

[Verse 2:]
Blood Sex &amp; Rock n Roll [x3]
Burning lies die with black crows
Come stitch my flesh back to.. back to life

[Chorus x4:]
I know you want me
I know you need me
I am your drug of choice

Come say youâll use me up tonight
And I donât blame you [2x]

[Refrain x3:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I donât blame you

Come say youâll use me up tonight
And I donât blame you [2x]

[Bridge :]
Is it bad to want
Is it bad to want me
Is it bad to want
Is it bad to want me baby

[Chorus x4:]
I know you want me
I know you need me
I am your drug of choice

[Refrain x3:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I donât blame you
