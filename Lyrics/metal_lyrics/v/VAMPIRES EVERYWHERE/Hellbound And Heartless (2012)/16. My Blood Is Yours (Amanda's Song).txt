It's neurotic to trust me
I am nothing to you
Just another worm
Filled with violent views
You are my plague
Inside of me
You are my plague
Feeding on me

Can you feel my heart inside your soul?
I can feel you blood dripping out false hope

I am torn apart
Torn apart and confused
I am left for dead
Misled and used
In the end
I am nothing to you
Just a form of revenge
Forced upon the accused

Can you feel my heart inside your soul?
I can feel you blood dripping out false hope

You sleep in his bed
Like the soulless feed the dead
[x2]

Can you feel my heart inside your soul?
I can feel you blood dripping out false hope
[x2]
