She's cold now like the night
Burning eyes out like skin to knife
Can you hear us breathing can you hear us coming
And calling out the sun is falling the air is fading
Your heart is breaking
And will you scream out loud
Let's kill the chemicals inside our heads
Fear is just a lie that lies within
Let's kill the chemicals inside our heads
Fear is just a lie that leaves us dead
She's hallow like a grave
Broken heart cries from the souls that she takes
Can you breathe right now
Can you breathe your cries burn like fire
