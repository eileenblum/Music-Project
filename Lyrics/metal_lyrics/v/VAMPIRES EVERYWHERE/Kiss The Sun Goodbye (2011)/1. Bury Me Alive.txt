Blood
Right now I stand alone
Against all your lies
Right now I can't brave
The Evil deep inside
Bury me alive
This will be the last time
You call my name out loud
We're going to have some fun tonight
Rip your heart out from inside
Call out all your friends
That you have hypnotized
Call out everything
And all the guys you let inside
Protect your neck
