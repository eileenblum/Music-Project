Call me what you will I will be disaster
Every time you look my way
I won't be the guy that your heart is after
Baby that's the only way
Hear me now we'll sacrifice our souls
Will you drive this hearse
Will you break this curse
And fall in love with me
Will you hold on tight
Until the time is right
And set my heart free
Lipstick lies
Fall into it all I will come right after
Cruel intentions lead the way
I will justify almost every answer baby
That's the only way
You're a lie
