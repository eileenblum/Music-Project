False perceptions I bleed the night dry
I complicate beautiful lies
Can you see motion turn to cries and I see
Bloody wishes on the floor
Can you see me fading out
Can you see me
Can you burn everything
That once pertained to my lost soul
Let go
And I caught fire in the sunlight
Burning like a candle at night
No shadows to hide my eyes
I caught fire in the sunlight
Broken pictures I close my eyes
I circumvent innocent life
Here I am tattooed to the wall and I am
Blowing kisses toward the door
Plastic heart melted in the shape of knife
I won't let you down
