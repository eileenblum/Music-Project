Shake Shake Shake your head baby
Shake Shake Shake your head
Stitch heart shaped mechanical pieces
To your sleeve and hope you die
Cross your fingers and say goodbye

Come On Come On Come On
Save the lies
Choose your side tonight
Choose your side tonight

light....separates the night

Call it love
Call it lies
Call it anything you like
I'd do anything to bring you back to life
Call it love
Call it fear
Till we all just disappear
I'd do anything to keep your heart tonight

Call it love...Call it lies

Break Break Break your head baby
Break Break Break your head
Bury all hollow prosthetic dead
With my soul I sacrifice
All my love
To save your life

Come On Come On Come On
Save the lies
Choose your side tonight
Choose your side tonight

light....separates the night

Call it love
Call it lies
Call it anything you like
I'd do anything to bring you back to life
Call it love
Call it fear
Till we all just disappear
I'd do anything to keep your heart tonight

Call it love...Call it lies

Your heart is mine [x4]

Call it love
Call it lies
Call it anything you like
I'd do anything to bring you back to life
Call it love
Call it fear
Till we all just disappear
I'd do anything to keep your heart tonight

Call it love...Call it lies
