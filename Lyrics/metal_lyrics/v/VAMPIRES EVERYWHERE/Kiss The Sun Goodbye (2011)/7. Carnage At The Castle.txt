To save your life
I broke the rules far past my memory
To save your life
I fought the wolves that plagued your family
You bestowed the gift
That broke the silence in my head
You kissed my lips
Broken skin burnt from past regrets
I will fight for you my only one
Save the night
The night is ours
Our love won't fall
To earn your trust
I killed your fear I killed all your enemies
To earn your trust
I carved your heart on my chest cavity
You pledged an oath
That cured the hinger in my head
You kissed my lips
Broken skin burnt from past regrets
Kisses kisses to the dead
Hypnotizing all that's left
