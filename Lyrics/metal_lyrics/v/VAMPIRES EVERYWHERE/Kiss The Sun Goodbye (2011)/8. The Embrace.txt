Come on say you love me
My comatose nightmare love
Smothered by pain and suffering
Written with lip gloss and blood
Can you feel your heart fading
Can you feel the change inside
Calling you like a phantom
Haunting you in the night

Whoa, you're gonna feel this tonight
Your heartbeats racing fast
Faster than light
Whoa, you're gonna fall in love
There's a killer on the loose
Hungry for blood

This will be the last time baby
I promised to let you go
Falling rays of light befall you
Covers you like blood in snow
Can you feel your heart racing
Can you feel the rain tonight
Slowly falling down your lips now baby
Cutting you like a knife

Whoa, you're gonna feel this tonight
Your heartbeats racing fast
Faster than light
Whoa, you're gonna fall in love
There's a killer on the loose
Hungry for blood

Say you want
You know you want it now
You know you want to die
Want to die

Say you want
You know you want it now
You know you want to die
Want to die

You will be mine
You will be mine

Whoa, you're gonna feel this tonight
Your heartbeats racing fast
Faster than light

Whoa, you're gonna feel this tonight
Your heartbeats racing fast
Faster than light
Whoa, you're gonna fall in love
There's a killer on the loose
Hungry for blood
