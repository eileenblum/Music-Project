The light the light bleeds into my eyes
And burns my soul it burns my soul
She's calling out into the crowd
Regret shall plague us all
This tattered heart won't show you where to go
One silver bullet baby won't kill you know
No not tonight
The crowd is calling baby no regrets
No not tonight
Her eyes her eyes try to compromise
And cure our souls save our souls
And I won't die
