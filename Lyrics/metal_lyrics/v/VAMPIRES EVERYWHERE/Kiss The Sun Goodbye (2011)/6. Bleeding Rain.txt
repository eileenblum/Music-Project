She calls tonight to let go
A vision of the past that I know
Departed from a dream dark angel
No matter what you seem (to be)
But our love is meant to be...
Bleeding rain she calls out my name in diamonds
Who's to say our hearts won't fuse forever
Who's to say time won't be the end of us all
My loves a contradiction
My loves a gleaming black throne
Housing kings without queens
It's more than possible and I
Slit the throat of every living rose
Fighting for a breathe
Buried deep under regret
Tied tight to every soul
She calls out my name in diamonds
