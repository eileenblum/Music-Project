We'll compromise every time you cry
We'll kill the thoughts that consume your mind
It's time to burn this masquerade
And burn the broken heart in your way
It's immortal suicide
Transistor masked all our cries
Let's call out to the dead
Let's turn it around bury the sound
Let's call out to the dead
Let's torture the crowd bury the sound
Breathe every chance you get
Destroying all thoughts of regret
Forever our hearts bleed like this
Forever our bodies turn and twitch
