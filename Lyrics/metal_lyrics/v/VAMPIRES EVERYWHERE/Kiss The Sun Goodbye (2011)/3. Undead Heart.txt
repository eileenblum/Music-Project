From the back of your heart
To the palm of your hands
That's what you wanted
A bloody kiss a second chance
Don't cover your eyes
Right before you die
Embrace the night come to life
Inside you know it's right
Say goodbye
Josie's in love tonight with the undead
She sacrificed all she had
Her heart won't beat again
Josie's in love with the undead
From the look on your face
To the fear in your eyes
That's what you wanted
Eternal life screaming cries
Don't cover your eyes
As darkness bleeds the light
Embrace the night come to life
Inside you know it's right
Say goodbye
Just say goodbye
Just close your eyes
