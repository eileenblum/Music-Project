We are the fools that fall in love
Sleep with one eye open
We will pretend it's love
Breathing will only suffocate
The human part of us
So wish for apologies
It will be in blood
Suspended for the world to see
Closer than the sun
Hold out your hand and
Let your heart break into pieces
We are the fight we are the cries
We are children o the night
We are the fools that fall in love
Speak with false perceptions
Clouded from above
Tattooed to your slow embrace
Hidden in mistrust
So wish wish for apologies
It will be in blood
Buried under empathy
Closer than fall in love
