Mountains don't move for a piece of shit like you
Dedication, education, lost in creativity
Climbing the wall of reality
I`m possessed
I will never be the king of me

Mountains can move for a piece of shit like me
I was lost in translation, but now I'm free
Walking the road of reality with ease
I'm forever the king of me!
