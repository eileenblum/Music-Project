Twisting my mind into dreamland
As the world burns in real time

Ah! Ah

Log on

Violence! We are force-fed indeed
Silence or big brother will see you

Give up your fear, hatred is here
Tonight we fight cause your end is near
Give it a stare, the tyrants is here
This imperial game
Is mankind's shame!

Go to your burial ground
Re awake the dead soldiers of your mind
And then, with armed forces
We disconnect
Our dreams, nightmares and thoughts

Twisting your mind out of dreamland
As our world burns in real time

Give up your fear, hatred is her
Tonight we fight cause your end is near
Give it a stare, the tyrants is here
