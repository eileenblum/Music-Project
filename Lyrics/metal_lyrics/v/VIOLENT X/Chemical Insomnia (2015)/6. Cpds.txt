I wasn't dreaming in my own dimension
My life slowly rusts away
The black heaven demands mayhem
No peace for you and me
We rust away

I was a young man
Searching for war
But now I'm wiser
IGNORE!

1.2.3.4 Ignite

I wasn't dreaming
My mind was slowly bleeding, and feeding
Ascend from nothing just to fade away
Its not reality, not even a fantasy
Descend from everything just to fade away

Counter productive disorder syndrome
Locked in a straight jacket
I return to hell
