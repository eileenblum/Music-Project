You don't know me
What I`ve seen
Your lost, but I'm in, total boredom,
A freak of the world
High on anger, disruptor of worlds

Thoughts of infinity twists my mind
Chains of reality, so sublime
Like ants we crawl, and destroy our world

So when the world stops spinning around you
You realize your nothing but shit
You tie a noose around your neck
And wish for luck

We painted mountains
We carved the sea
Our dreams where honest
It was life or death indeed

Back then we stood tall
Like giants
David and Goliath
We all know who won, don't we!?

So bow for your masters
And their system of doom
Don't think for your self, you will only get fooled

So rise from the ashes
A change from below
The head of the serpent
Decapitate and destroy!

We painted mountains
We carved the sea
Our dreams where honest
It was life or death indeed

Back then we stood tall
Like giants
David and Goliath
We know who won
