The chaos stay constant and sharp
But the mind is a boat lost in the fog
The radar show no activity in site
But the warhead is armed
Total self destruct, code red
It's Sunday!

Electric waves
Nothing is more important, then to die in peace and tranquility
Medicated, celebrated
Nothing left,but natures treat

We are gods among sheep
We roam the galaxy
Time and space are non existing
Hangover indeed

Sunday! Forever chaos and my mind is twisting
Sunday! But thankfully the critical exists

Come on!
