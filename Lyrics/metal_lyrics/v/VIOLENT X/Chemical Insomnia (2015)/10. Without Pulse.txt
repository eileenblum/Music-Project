I challenge the established
By questioning everything
No reality is greater
No one is more incompatible

Reality is a lie in a black mind

I'm dying, slowly without rhythm
Without pulse
Pointless game this life
And endless jigsaw

No new knowledge can be
Extracted from this
Mundane thought binds me tight
Time to stand up and reset my mind

We are all hookers, but who fucking cares
Spinning wheel of life and death
We are all some day out of breath
