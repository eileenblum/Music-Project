A boy gaze upon the burning sky
It's like the wrath of god hits his eyes
The flesh burns from his bones
Only his shadow remains
The dragon has woken

Little boy!

Expect a rain of terror from the heavens
So called leaders of men have corroded
Human life hangs in a noose
We have become death the destroyer of worlds

Fat man!

The dawn of a new age
In the ruins of fat mans rage
Burned and scorned
Warned and torned

Like Sodom and Gomorrah
Two angels of death arrived
Lost souls became pilares of salt
The final scene was in action
A giant became god
A new world order was conceived

The dawn of a new age
In the ruins of fat mans rage
Burned and scorned
Warned and torned
