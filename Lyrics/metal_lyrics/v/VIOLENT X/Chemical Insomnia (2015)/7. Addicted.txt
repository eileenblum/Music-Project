Going down to my wasteland
Flipping coins with god
Looking back on my destructive past
Only thing too do is laugh

So when all bridges are burned
Even city`s lay in ruin
I toke down to my wasteland
To find my salvation

Hazeland

Approaching addiction
A ever growing hunger
With no end in sight
Approaching my destination
With no remorse!
