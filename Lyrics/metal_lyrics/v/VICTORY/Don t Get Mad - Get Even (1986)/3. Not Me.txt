[Herman Frank / White - Charlie Huhn - Tommy Newton - Peter Knorn - Fritz Randow -- Ric Browde]

I never get mad I only get even
You think I've been had
Well facts are deceiving
If you believe in your mortality
You better watch your step and don't mess with me

Not me - Cause you're fooling yourself
Not me - must be somebody else
Not me - get a hold of yourself
Not me

I'm an accident just waiting to occur
I'm that sleeping dog you don't want to stir
If you believe in your mortality
Well I'm the trouble that you don't want to seek

Not me - Cause you're fooling yourself
Not me - must be somebody else
Not me - get a hold of yourself
Not me

I carry a grudge like a ten-ton weight
Don't try to judge and don't contemplate
I'm out for blood and you're tempting fate

I'm burning my candles at every end
You know that's mine
I'm trouble ahead around every bend
You know that's mine

That's me - now you're fooling yourself
Not me - must be somebody else
Not me - I'll be casting a spell
Not me - get a hold of yourself
Not me - must be somebody else
Not me - I'll be out raising hell
That's me - Cause you're fooling yourself
Not me - must be somebody else
