[Herman Frank / White - Charlie Huhn - Tommy Newton - Peter Knorn - Fritz Randow -- Ric Browde]

I've seen the north side of heaven
I've lived the south side of empty hell
Black days and bluer nights
I couldn't hide in the spotlight

Got an angel's smile
With the devil's guite

She's back, she's back back in town
The best thing that's been around
She's back, she's back back in town
Back in town

I've seen her legs in my dreams
I've seen her face in magazines
White heat and red lights
A one-way street through the dead of night

Got an angel's smile
With the devil's guite
Won't you thrill me - Chill me - kill me

She's back, she's back back in town
The best thing that's been around
She's back, she's back back in town
Back in town

She's back, she's back back in town
The best thing that's been around
She's back, she's back back in town
Back in town

She's back, she's back back in town
The best thing that's been around
She's back, she's back back in town
Back in town, back in town
She's back
