I've waited too long for us to be alone
Always trying to ditch our chaperone
Looking to the left and looking to the right
Trying to escape with you into the night

We're sneaking out
Heading south
You and me little girl
Clandestinely

Can't go to your place 'cause your folks are there
And over at my house we'd get nailed on the stairs
Ain't got no money to get ourselves a room
I guess your back seat will just have to do

We're sneaking out
Heading south
You and me little girl
Clandestinely

Fogging the windows up with our hot steamy breath
To get caught now would be a fate worse than death

We're sneaking out
Heading south
You and me little girl
Clandestinely

Yeah,
We're sneaking out
Heading south
