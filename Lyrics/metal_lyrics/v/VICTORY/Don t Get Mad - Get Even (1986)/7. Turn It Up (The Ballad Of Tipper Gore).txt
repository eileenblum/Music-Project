Tipper says, I can't, while I say I can
Better duck 'cause you know what just hit the fan
1984 in 1986
Putting us all in a terrible fix
Rock 'n' roll don't carry no guns
Rock 'n' roll never killed anyone
We take no promises and none of your lip
'Cause we ain't about to lie down and quit

Turn it up - loud
Don't turn it down
Gonna stand proud - proud
So turn it up loud

Freedom of speech gives us the right to rock
'Cause we ain't about to turn back the clock
To a brave new world void of all passion
Where silence is golden and the latest of fashion
Rock and roll was always meant to be
Rock and roll we want it on TV
You can't stop us with any of your laws
'Cause rockin' and rollin' is our fighting cause

Turn it up - loud
Don't turn it down
Gonna stand proud - proud
Turn it up loud

Hey, you know I got a good idea,
I think we ought to write
These people a nice long letter
With a brick taped to it
Would you help me throw it?
'Cause I feel, if it's too loud
You're too old

Turn it up - loud
Don't turn it down
Gonna stand proud - proud
Turn it up loud

Turn it up - loud
Don't turn it down
Gonna stand proud - proud
Turn it up loud
