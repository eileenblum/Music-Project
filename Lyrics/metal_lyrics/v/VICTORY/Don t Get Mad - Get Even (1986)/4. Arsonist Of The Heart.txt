[Herman Frank / White - Charlie Huhn - Tommy Newton - Peter Knorn - Fritz Randow -- Ric Browde]

You're a pyromaniac on the loose
A siren waiting with a very short fuse
Set me ablaze with your passionate kiss
A searing temptation no man could resist

Play with your matches
Turn me to ashes
I fell right from the start

For the arsonist of the heart
Igniting me with your spark

Seductive flames got me hypnotized
Engulfing me right before my eyes
You smile and burn me right off of my feet
Another victim of your all-consuming heat

Play with your matches
Turn me to ashes
I fell right from the start

For the arsonist of the heart
Igniting me with your spark
A heart burner in the dark
You're an arsonist of the heart

You're an arsonist of the heart
Igniting me with your spark
A heart burner in the dark
You're an arsonist of the heart

For the arsonist of the heart
Igniting me with your spark
You're an arsonist of the heart
A heart burner in the dark
You're an arsonist of the heart
