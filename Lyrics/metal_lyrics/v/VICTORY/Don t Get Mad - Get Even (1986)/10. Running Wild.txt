[Herman Frank / White - Charlie Huhn - Tommy Newton - Peter Knorn - Fritz Randow -- Ric Browde]

Miss Demeanor fell on her knees
Said put your law inside of me
You know she tired to cop a plea
Not guilty of insanity

'Cause I'm running wild
I'm anything but mild
That's part of my style
'Cause I'm running wild

I'll slander you with low blows
Smear tactics and innuendos
They're just a part of my misdeeds
My charges grow with impunity

'Cause I'm running wild
I'm anything but mild
That's part of my style
'Cause I'm running wild

In a sense you can be the judge
I'm never one to hold a grudge
I'll make my legal motions, you will see
Guilty of lust in the first degree

'Cause I'm running wild
I'm anything but mild
That's part of my style
'Cause I'm running wild

Yes, I'm running wild
I'm anything but mild
Yes, that's part of my style
'Cause I'm running wild
