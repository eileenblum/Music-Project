I hear there's a party tonight
Everybody's out on the town
Gonna have the time of my life
Everybody's getting on down

So hurry up, baby, don't be lazy
Let the music drive you crazy
Tell me, tell me that you're right tonight
Let me know, let me go, let it go

Are you ready, are you ready to rock and roll tonight?
Say you're ready, say you're ready to rock and roll
All night, all night

Ooh baby you're in all my dreams
Everybody knows my desire
You can tell by the way that I scream
You set my pants on fire

So hurry up, baby, don't be lazy
Let the music drive you crazy
Are you hot tonight
Let me know, let me go, let it go

Are you ready, are you ready to rock and roll tonight?
Say you're ready, say you're ready to rock and roll
All night, all night

Are you ready, are you ready to rock and roll tonight?
Say you're ready, say you're ready to rock and roll
All night

Are you ready, are you ready to rock and roll tonight?
Say you're ready, say you're ready to rock and roll tonight
Are you ready, are you ready to rock and roll tonight?
Say you're ready, say you're ready to rock and roll tonight
Are you ready, are you ready to rock and roll tonight?
Say you're ready, say you're ready to rock and roll
All night
