If promises were dollars
I'd be a millionaire
Instead I'm living in squalor
And getting skinny and pale
You know your phone is always busy
Or else you put me on hold
I'm getting hungry and dizzy
And this is getting real old

The postman don't ring twice of my house
In fact he don't ring at all
No  U.P.S. no Federal Express
Won't somebody give me a call

You say the check's in the mail
Is it a lie?
The check's in the mail
Or just another tall tale
Don't tell me baby
I've heard it all before
The check's in the mail

You say the check's in the mail
Is it a lie?
The check's in the mail
Or just another tall tale
Don't tell me baby
I've heard it all before
The check's in the mail

You say you'll pay me tomorrow
But tomorrow never comes
I got nowhere to borrow
It's time to get out the guns
The light in the tunnel
Is just an oncoming train
Better listen to the rumble
'Cause it's the calm before the rain

The postman don't ring twice of my house
In fact he don't ring at all
No  U.P.S. no Federal Express
Won't somebody give me a call

You say the check's in the mail
Is it a lie?
The check's in the mail
Or just another tall tale
Don't tell me baby
I've heard it all before
The check's in the mail
I look every day
'Cause the check's in the mail
Is it a lie?
The check's in the mail
Or just another tall tale
Don't tell me baby
I'd really be surprised
The check's in the mail

The check's in the mail
The check's in the mail
The check's in the mail
The check's in the mail

You say the check's in the mail
Is it a lie?
The check's in the mail
Or just another tall tale
Don't tell me baby
I've heard it all before
The check's in the mail

You say the check's in the mail
I've been knocking 'round your door
The check's in the mail
I got something in store
Don't tell me baby
Can't take it no more
You say the check's in the mail

You say the check's in the mail
I'm getting my gun
The check's in the mail
I'm gonna have me some fun
Don't tell me baby
Because I've heard it before
You say the check's in the mail

You say the check's in the mail
I'm getting my gun
The check's in the mail
I'm gonna have me some fun
Don't tell me baby
Because I've heard it before
You say the check's in the mail
