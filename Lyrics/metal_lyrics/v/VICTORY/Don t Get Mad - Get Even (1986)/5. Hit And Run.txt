It's two A.M. and the last call's passed
Taking tonight like it might be my last
There you are looking young and unattached
Looks like you'll be my one-night match

I strike at random
Don't care how I land 'em

Gotta hit and run
I dive in quick
I'm your wayward son
I'm just out for kicks

I'll use every line in the how-to-book
Gonna get you baby by hook or by crook
Dr. Ruth told me what it's all about
Gotta live it up before I check out

I strike at random
Don't care how I land 'em

Gotta hit and run
I dive in quick
I'm your wayward son
I'm just out for kicks

That's why I hit and run
I'm in and out quick
I'm your prodigal son
I'm just out for kicks
Gotta hit and run

I'm gonna hit and run
I dive in quick
I'm your wayward son
I'm just out for kicks

That's why I hit and run
I'm in and out quick
I'm your long-lost son
I'm just out for kicks

That's why I hit and run
I dive in quick
I'm your wayward son
I'm just out for kicks

Gotta hit and run
I cannot quit
I'm your prodigalson
I'm just out for kicks
Gotta hit and run
