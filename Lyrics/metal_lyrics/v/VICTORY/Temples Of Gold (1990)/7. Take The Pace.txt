In a world where only the strong survive
There's no sympathy for the weaker guys
The hands of time won't wait for the loser
You only get one chance
And you can't abuse it

It's always the same old song - the same old singers
Yes it's always the same old game - the same old winners

If you can't take the pace
You shouldn't ride the rodeo
And if you can't win the race
Why the hell did you join the show

No, there's no one to pull you through the stormy weather
So the moment to start this race is now or never

Can you take the pace - tell me, tel me
Take the pace
Can you take the pace - tell me, tell me
Take the pace - a case of do or die

The fight is on - will you fall
Or will you stop before the curtain call
There's no excuse for nearly made it
So don't attempt the course - if you can't take it

It's always the same old song - the same old singers
Yes, it's always the same old game - the same old winners

Can you take the pace - tell me, tel me
Take the pace
Can you take the pace - tell me, tell me
