When the curtain fell
To reverse a spell
Of almost 30 years
And the tears and pain
That were all constrained
Hell broke loose that day

Like a miracle all the doors where open
Like a hurricane, like a wild wind blowin'
When the victims of cold persecution
Gather for the revolution

When the burning hearts join forces then
Marching for their rights
The liberty was calling them
On this winter night

Bodies cold but hearts on fire
All the young and old with a strong desire
To be free again from these iron chains of
Persecution
Gather for the revolution

When the burning hearts join forces then
Marching for their rights
The liberty was calling them
On this winter night

We'll always remember - that day in November
When eagles flies - and a nation cries
On resurrection day

When a wishing well made a dream come true - yeah!
Only time will tell if they hold on to it
Will they run away and seek their fortunes
Of just stay and face the music

When the burning hearts join forces then
The liberty was calling them
On this winter night

We'll always remember - that day in November
When the eagles flies - and a nation cries
On resurrection day
