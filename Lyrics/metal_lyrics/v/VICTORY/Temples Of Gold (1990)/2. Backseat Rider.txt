Black prince stands outside
All revved up for you to ride
You want to - you need to
A short cut to paradise
Zooms into your starry eyes
So cut loose - you can't refuse

We'll cruise down the highway
Hot child we'll be free
Head straight for the borderline
On the road to ecstasy
Sleep out in the open
Make love in the rain
All alone just you and me
On a motorbike - motorbike dream

Backseat rider - backseat rider
Just you and me
Backseat rider - backseat rider
On a motorbike - motorbike dream

L.A. stars by night
Wet a young guns appetite
I want you - I need you
Wild thoughts cross my mind
So grab the leather real tight
It feels good - my young blood

No rules for tomorrow
We'll live for today
Break loose from the things in life
That wrap you up in chains
Sleep out in the open
Make love in the rain
All alone just you and me
On a motorbike - motorbike dream

Backseat rider - backseat rider
Just you and me
Backseat rider - backseat rider
On a motorbike - motorbike dream
