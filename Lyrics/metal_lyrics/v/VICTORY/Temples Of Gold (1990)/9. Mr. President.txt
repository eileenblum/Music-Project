Tell me Mr. president
Did you sleep well last night
And tell me Mr. confident
Was the caviar alright
Just around the corner
Where life is colder
There are no winners

When you drive out heaven's gate
Watch the flame 'cause baby - you're in hell
When you leave the white house door
Nothing's white no more
'cause you're in hell

Tell me Mr. president
How is your neighbourhood
Last time I saw Washington
It didn't look so good
Bloody streets of terror
Things won't get better
There are no winners

When you drive out heaven's gate
Watch the flame 'cause baby - you're in hell
When you leave the white house door
Nothing's white no more
'cause you're in hell
