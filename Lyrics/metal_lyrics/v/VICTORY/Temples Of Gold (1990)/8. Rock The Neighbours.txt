Sick'n'tired of the world outside
Everyone talks 'bout everyone's wife
And if you're a single occupant
Hey you must be a gay friend
Live and let live is our philosophy
Black or white or peppermint green
Just let them play their games
'cause this is what we say

Rock the neighbours
Lock 'em in a cell - send 'em all in hell
Neighbours!
Rock the neighbours
Lock 'em in a cell - send 'em all in hell

He's drunk again shouting off his mouth
She would leave but there's no way out
With a family of three
And another on the way
Downstairs party 'till half past four
The cops are banging on the door
They're driving us insane
And that is what we say

Rock the neighbours
Lock 'em in a cell - send 'em all in hell
Neighbours!
Rock the neighbours
Lock 'em in a cell - send 'em all in hell

Check the chick in 205
Waits half naked when the mail arrives
But the first one on the phone
When I bring my ladies home
See that jerk on the 2nd floor
Keeps complaining 'bout the kids next door
Guess the highlight of his life
Is beatin' up his wife

Rock the neighbours
Lock 'em in a cell - send 'em all in hell
Neighbours!
Rock the neighbours
Lock 'em in a cell - send 'em all in hell
