Hey Joe it's good to see you made the shoe
Hey Sue we're glad that you could make it too
What's a woman without a man
What's a band without their fans
All the power we generate
Comes from you in front of the stage

Dedication is much tougher
Much stronger than all of the others

Rock'n'roll kids forever
They come out any weather - to get down
Rock'n'roll kids forever
They will run hell for leather - to get down

All right we're gonna rip it up tonight
Good times guaranteed to blow your mind
Rock'n'roll is here to stay
Rock'n'roll is the only way
C'mon guys - communicate
Show the world how rockers celebrate

Dedication is much tougher
Much stronger than all of the others

Rock'n'roll kids forever
They come out any weather - to get down
Rock'n'roll kids forever
They will run hell for leather - to get down
