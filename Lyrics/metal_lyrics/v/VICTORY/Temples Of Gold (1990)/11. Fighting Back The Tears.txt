Sometimes when I hear the rain
Like teardrops on my window pane
Crying because you can't be here
Voices screaming through the tears
I call out your name
I call out your name - yes I do

Sometimes in my lonely room
I gaze at stars and Mr. moon
Again I play this waiting game
The wind outside is whispering
I call out your name
I call out your name - yes I do

The seasons come and they fade away
And I am here waiting for the day
You're running to me
You're running to me
I want you - yes I do

Just another night to go my love
And I'll be no my way to you
Laughing like I used to do

'cause I've been fighting back the tears
'cause I've been fighting back the tears
For some times
'cause I've been fighting back the tears
'cause I've been fighting, fighting,
Fighting back the tears

Whispers on the telephone
Only make me want you more
And when the call comes to an end
Suddenly I must confess
You're the very best

Everything I ever dreamed was you
I can't believe it's true
Just another night to go on my own
And I'll be on my way to you
Laughing like I used to do

'cause I've been fighting back the tears
'cause I've been fighting back the tears
For some times
'cause I've been fighting back the tears
'cause I've been fighting back the tears
And I can't fight no more

Sometimes when I'm on the road
Wish that I could turn and go
Back to where it all began
Just a lady and her man - loving again
Loving again, and again

Just another night to go my love
And I'll be no my way to you
Laughing like I used to do

'cause I've been fighting back the tears
'cause I've been fighting back the tears
For some times
'cause I've been fighting back the tears
'cause I've been fighting, fighting
Fighting back the tears
And I can't fight no more
