In life constant battle field
You gotta master everyday survival
Take the though times with the smooth
Try to keep those heavy scales in balance

There's something we must say
Before we start each day

We're standing - we're standing
Really standing - standing like a rock

Some men drown in waters deep
Others just can't stand the heat around them
They fall to power in control
Bend to spirit and to soul destruction

That's something we must fight
Shout with all our might

We're standing - we're standing
Really standing - standing like a rock
