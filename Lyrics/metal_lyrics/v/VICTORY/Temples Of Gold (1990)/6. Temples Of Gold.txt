Hey don'0t be fooled
By the words of someone who lies
And don't be fooled by the plan
Behind TV preachers smiles
He's just pretending
He's communicating with God

They want your money
On your conscience they'll play
My friend do not believe
A word that they say

In their temples of gold
In their temples of gold
God wouldn't want you to pay

If you are searching for the
Straight up meaning of life
Buddy, that's something that
Your hard earned money can't buy
Switch off you TV
In the real world you'll see
10.000 preachers
Who are doin' it for free

With no temples of gold
With no temples of gold
Just bricks and stones
With no temples of gold
God wouldn't want you to pay

They want your money
On your conscience they'll play
My friend do not believe
A word that they say

In their temples of gold
In their temples of gold
You pay - they win
In their temples of gold
In their temples of gold
God wouldn't want you to pay
