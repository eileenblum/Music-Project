Walking out the door I fell the urge to run
Leave behind this dead end life and have
Some real fun
What is so important about security
I'm working real hard for this grey reality

Passport and cash are itching in my hand
But still this magnet pulls me back again

Why can't I - why can't I
Why can't I break away
Why can't I - why can't I break away
Maybe I'll make it some day

People build their prisons
Then they lock their doors
We're creatures of a self inflicted
Big white hall
The world's such a big place, why am I so small
I wonder if I'm still afraid of this mighty fall

Passport and cash are itching in my hand
But still this magnet pulls me back again

Why can't I - why can't I
Why can't I break away
Why can't I - why can't I break away
Maybe I'll make it some day
