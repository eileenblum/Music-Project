Turn on the heat
Wanna let loose tonight
Shake of the boredom
Set this planet alight
The earth is moving
Round and round and round
Let's break out
'til we reach the speed of sound

Out in there fast lane
Take a ride to
Hell and back - hell and back
Take a ride to
Hell and back - hell and back

Born in a rocket
Can't settle down nowhere
Gun in my pocket
Waiting for his prey
The night is calling
C'mon bend the rules
Let's ride into the galaxy of fools

Nothing to loose
Take a ride to
Hell and back - hell and back
Take a ride to
Hell and back - hell and back
