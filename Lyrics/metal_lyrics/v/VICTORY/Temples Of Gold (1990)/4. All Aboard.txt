Look me in the eye
With your hand on your heart
Love me like no other
And party that tomorrow comes really slow
'cause baby's gonna burn tonight
The plane takes off for one hell of a flight
Pleasures to discover
This cowboy's gonna rock
'till the morning light
There is love in the air tonight

We'll be dancing, dancing on the clouds
We'll be dancing, on the clouds

All aboard - on flight 69 forever
All night long - touching the sky with you
All aboard - on flight 69 to heaven
All night long - touching the sky with you

Fly baby fly this silver bird in the sky
It's party like no other
The seats are reclining, the music is loud
There's rocking in the aisles alright
The highest high, that money can buy
So love me like no other
Jump on the board for a real good ride
There's love in the air tonight

We'll be dancing, dancing on the clouds
We'll be dancing, on the clouds

All aboard - on flight 69 forever
All night long - touching the sky with you
All aboard - on flight 69 to heaven
All night long - touching the sky with you
