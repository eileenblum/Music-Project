She was far too young, could have so much fun
Living on past memories
Must track her killer down before he can be free
But that ain't no excuse

Don't go into the darkness
Don't go out of the light
Don't go into the darkness
You're gonna lose your mind

It was suicide
How she took her life
I was suicide

There just ain't no way to bring her back again
But he's blind to everything
Someone's got to pay and that's his reasoning
He will make the mistake

Don't go into the darkness
Don't go out of the light
Don't go into the darkness
You're gonna lose your mind

Don't go into the darkness
Don't go out of the light
Don't go into the darkness
You're gonna lose your mind

Don't go into the darkness
Don't go out of the light
Don't go into the darkness
You're gonna lose your mind
