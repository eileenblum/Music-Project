I've heard the voice of the master
Gave me a magic touch
The energy of a generator
I've never felt so much
I was talking to an angel
With a fast guitar
It felt wild - the air was electric
Flying through the stars

They just said
You're the one
Let it rip
Time has come
It's a gift, coming from above
Are you ready

Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
This planet is a-rockin' through the universe

Your Hi-Fi is a solar system
Just a space machine
Hit the switch and leave tonight
Blast into a dream

An new age
Now we know
Out there
We're not alone
Across the sky, they're gonna rock and roll
Are you ready

Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
This planet is a-rockin' through the universe
Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
This planet is a-rockin' through the universe

An new age
Now we know
Out there
We're not alone
Across the sky, they're gonna rock and roll
Are you ready

Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
This planet is a-rockin' through the universe
Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
Power strikes the earth
This planet is a-rockin' through the universe
This planet is a-rockin' through the universe
