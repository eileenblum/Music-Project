You hear them on the radio, see them on TV
They say the things you wanna hear
And lie so easily
They give you this
They give you that
Empty promises are bait for the trap

Hear what I say
Don't tell no lies
Say no more
Your words disguise
You're never gonna win
Don't tell no lies
You better think again
Don't tell no lies, think again

They say they can change the world
And make it a better place
But don't be fooled, they're playing a part
In this red rat race
So when you are alone
When you are afraid
Don't forget what they've made

Don't tell no lies
Better stop
Your words disguise
Don't tell me no lies
Don't tell no lies
Say no more
Don't tell no lies
Think again

Your words disguise
You're not gonna
Screw up my life
No more
I know where you
Are coming from
I know where you belong

Don't tell no lies
Say no more
Your words disguise
You're never gonna win
Don't tell no lies
You better think again
Don't tell no lies

Don't tell no lies
Say no more
Your words disguise
You're never gonna win
Don't tell no lies
You better think again
Don't tell no lies, think again
