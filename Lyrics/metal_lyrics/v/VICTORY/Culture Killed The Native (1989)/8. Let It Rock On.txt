If you wanna touch the fire
Feel the flames inside of you
You ain't gonna get much higher
Oh, you know just what to do
Heartbeat
We're the power generation
We don't need no wings to fly
You can lose all that frustration
The feeling's never gonna die

Let it rock on
You got it
And let's roll
Don't ask why
Get some rock on
Yes, you got it
This rock is a-rollin' and we'll keep on going all night

Let the power take you over
Let it get into your soul
Hey, you better run for cover
If you're not gonna rock and roll
Heartbeat
'Cos you know there's nothing better
Letting go of reality
Oh, you can escape and enter
A rock and roll fantasy

Let it rock on
You got it
And let's roll
Don't ask why
Get some rock on
Yes, you got it
This rock is a-rollin' and we'll keep on going all night

Rock on

Let it rock on
You got it
And let's roll
Don't ask why
Get some rock on
Yes, you got it
This rock is a-rollin' and we'll keep on going all night
Let it rock on
You got it
And let's roll
Don't ask why
Get some rock on
Yes, you got it
Rock on
