Dreamer, oh how she cast the spell
Deceiver, for her he'd live in hell
He would sell his soul and walk into the unknown

Midnight, alone in the ring of stones
Moonlight, always so bright and cold
The deal is made when the moon is full
Oh yeah
When he will change from a man into wolf again

No going back
The deal is made and now he must pay

He's on the loose
He's on the loose
This howling for you
Only
He's on the loose
He's on the loose
Just what will you do?
What will you do?

Desire, oh how she fed the flames
Won't take a share of his nightmare, no no

But she can feel he's waiting there for her
Out in the night

He's on the loose
He's on the loose
This howling for you
Only
He's on the loose
He's on the loose
Just what will you do?
What will you do?

He's on the loose
He's on the loose
This howling for you
Only
He's on the loose
He's on the loose
Just what will you do?
What will you do?
