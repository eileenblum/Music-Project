So you think you got a lot of time
To do the things that you wanna try
But let me tell you, life's too short
So make the most of what you got
You only get one shot
To hit the top
You got so many big dreams
Don't let them slip out of your hands
Take all the chances that you see
You gonna have to take command

Standing on the edge of time
So many dangerous signs
Don't you know it's now or never
Standing on the edge of time
Hey, don't waste your life
Nothing's ever last forever

Don't you slip, it's a long way down
A hit or miss
Don't you mess around, if you wanna do those things
Gonna have to cut the strings
Don't hesitate, no time to waste
You're strapped to the wheel of fortune
Don't know the cards that time will deal
It can be over too soon
'Cos time has got a heart of steel

Standing on the edge of time
So many dangerous signs
Don't you know it's now or never
Standing on the edge of time
Hey, don't waste your life
Nothing's ever last forever

Standing on the edge of time
So many dangerous signs
Don't you know it's now or never
Standing on the edge of time
Hey, don't waste your life
Nothing's ever last forever

Standing on the edge of time
So many dangerous signs
Don't you know it's now or never
Standing on the edge of time
Hey, don't waste your life
Nothing's ever last forever
