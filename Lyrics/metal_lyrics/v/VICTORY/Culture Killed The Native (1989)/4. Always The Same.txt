We want some action
It's what we came for
No more excuses
'Cos we've heard 'em all before

Gonna make some thunder
Gonna make a storm
We keep getting put down
Enough is enough
'Cos this is a break out
From now on we're playing rough

Can you feel the hunger, danger in the air
New stand's at hand, time to right some wrongs

And it's always the same
No change, like talking to a wall
Always the same
Some day, that big wall is gonna fall
Always the same

They don't understand us
Can't see the real truth
We want some answers
What are we coming to?

Is it any wonder, that we are so confused
No trust, for us, they don't hear the call

Always the same
No change, like talking to a wall
Always the same
Some day, that big wall is gonna fall

And it's always the same
No change, like talking to a wall
Always the same
Some day, that big wall is gonna fall
No change, like talking to a wall
Always the same
Some day, that big wall is gonna fall
It's always the same
