Well, I used to be so carefree
Now all that has changed
And you got a hold on me
Well, I'm in chains
And just your slave
I'm under your control
And locked inside your cage

I feel no reaction coming
I need you
Must have you
Only you I crave, now it's too late

More and more
Not enough, I must score
More and more
Your love is the stuff I'd die for
More and more
You tease and mislead
More and more
You're driving me so crazy, babe
I want you more and more

Hey, which face is on today
Why are you playing games behind the masquerade

I'm burning
Start shaking, breaking
Can't take it
Can't shake it
Oh, you're killing me
I must break free

More and more
Not enough, I must score
More and more
Your love is the stuff I'd die for
More and more
You tease and mislead
More and more

More and more
Not enough, I must score
More and more
Your love is the stuff I'd die for
More and more
You tease and mislead
More and more
You're driving me so crazy, babe

More and more
I must score
More and more
Your love is the stuff I'd die for
More and more
You tease and mislead
More and more
You're driving me crazy
