You're the kind of girl who wants it all
I'm telling you you're heading
You're heading for a fall
You take me for granted
Give nothing in return
And how I'm feeling is not your concern

You cheat and use me
I don't need it, no!
'Cos you are

Never satisfied
Don't know how hard I've tried
Never satisfied
Better use some other guy
No, you're never satisfied

I know you think that I'm some kind of fool
Who'll always be there to jump for you
But I've been pushed and now I'm getting out
It's time you learned what love's all about

You take and fake
I don't need it, no!
'Cos you are

Never satisfied
Don't know how hard I've tried
Never satisfied
I'm glad you say good bye

Never satisfied
I don't know how many times
Never satisfied
I'm tired of all these fights

Never satisfied
Don't know how hard I've tried
Never satisfied
I'm glad you say good bye

You cheat and use me
I don't need it, no!
'Cos you are

Never satisfied
Don't know how hard I've tried
Never satisfied
I don't need it, no!
Never satisfied
