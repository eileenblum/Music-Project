They're on the streets of the big city
They are so young and yet so angry
They hope to achieve the impossible dream
So unaware of the dangers unseen

They're running from the past
How long will ya ever last

So they run!
They wanna break out
In search of better days
Living on the run
So they run!
They wanna break out
All they know is hate
Living on the run, on the run

It's not very long - before they find
Their troubles are not, not left behind
It's a hard fight for survival
And there ain't no rules in our jungle

They're never going back
Live under attack

So they run!
They wanna break out
In search of better days
Living on the run
So they run!
They wanna break out
All they know is hate
Living on the run, on the run

So they run!
They wanna break out
In search of better days
Living on the run
So they run!
They wanna break out
All they know is hate
Living on the run, on the run
They wanna break out
In search of better days
Living on the run
So they run!
They wanna break out
All they know is hate
Living on the run
