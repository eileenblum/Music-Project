Some night, somewhere
Come on, beneath the neon lights
With a face so innocent
Out there the men
With money, but without a name
Are like moths drawn to your flame

So you walk the night again
Hurt so much you feel no pain

Through walls I hear
You scream his name out in the dark
It's your cry from the heart
Will you ever make it good
Wanna help, I wish I could

I see your love's been lost to the night
Since you're living in the shadows
To make it right
Endlessly, lost in the night
'Cos why should you keep on
Paying the price

So sad, you see the scars that cut so deep in me
All your days have turned to nights
Take my hand and walk away
To a place where we can stay

I see your love's been lost to the night
Since you're living in the shadows
To make it right
Endlessly, lost in the night
'Cos why should you keep on
Paying the price

I see your love's been lost to the night
Since you're living in the shadows
To make it right
Endlessly, lost in the night
Why should you keep on
Paying the price
