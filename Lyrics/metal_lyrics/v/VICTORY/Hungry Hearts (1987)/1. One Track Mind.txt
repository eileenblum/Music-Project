(Hey - looking good! - Oh, I don't mean it that way)
I get excited by the wink of an eye
Or just the shake of a little of hip
Please pardon me if my thoughts blow up inside
Don't be embarrassed by a little old slip of the lip
Some things are better left unspoken
I try my best, but often make that big mistake
My friends all think I'm only joking
Please be considerate and just give me a break

'Cause I gotta one tack mind
I get in trouble all the time
A one track mind - what can I do
I got a one track mind
Think what you want, I say what I like
A one track mind - what about you?

I make 'em nervous with a twist on my tongue
Or just a simple little bird that I flip
I must a been denied back when I was young
Oops - oh no, there goes another Freudian slip
No chance to ever be forgiven Bad boy
My reputation's really going down the drain
My friends all think I'm only joking
Please be considerate and just give me a break

'Cause I gotta one tack mind
I get in trouble all the time
A one track mind - what can I do
I got a one track mind
Think what you want, I say what I like
A one track mind - what can I do?

'Cause I gotta one tack mind
Think what you want, I say what I like
A one track mind - how about you?
I got a one track mind
I get in trouble all the time
A one track mind - what can I do
I got a one track mind
Think what you want, I say what I like
A one track mind -- just like you?
