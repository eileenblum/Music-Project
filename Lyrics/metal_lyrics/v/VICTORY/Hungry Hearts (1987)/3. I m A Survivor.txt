Hot lights give me the rights
To take it out of control
Street fights, big city nights
Watch it now 'cause I'm on a roll

I spy the look of blood in your eye
You must have sold your soul
Don't you try messing with me
Pressure's gonna take its toll

Don't make me do it
'cause I'll cast a spell
Don't put me to it
'Cause I bounce back when I fall

I'm a survivor - change with the wind
Chase my love out on the road
I'm a survivor - living in sin
And I fight until the day I win

I fly with my power on high
Kick in adrenaline
Testify - do or die
I blow like nitroglycerin

Don't make me do it,
'cause I'll cast a spell
Don't put me to it
'Cause I bounce back when I fall
Yes I bounce back when I fall

I'm a survivor - change with the wind
Chase my love out on the road
I'm a survivor - living in sin
And I fight until the day I win

I'm a survivor - change with the wind
Chase my love out on the road
I'm a survivor - living in sin
And I fight until the day I win

I'm a survivor - change with the wind
Chase my love out on the road
I'm a survivor - living in sin
And I fight until the day I win
