When you look in my eyes
Dollar signs are all you see
Got a money hungry appetite
Best things in life are free

Got your Cadillac and mink stole
Baby's on a roll
But when you reach into my pocket
Looking for some change
I know something else is on your mind

You're my high dollar honey
Hi $ honey
Got me in a financial squeeze
You know you're making it hard on my credit card
High dollar honey believes
She's got the best of me

You know haste makes waste
Think I got money to burn
Well, when it's time to pay the bills
It ain't your concern

I get you Gucci and some Givenchy
But the thing that really satisfies you
Is when you turn out the light
And you make it all right
You can have your cake and eat it too

You're my high dollar honey
Hi $ honey
Got me in a financial squeeze
You know you're making it hard on my credit card
High dollar honey believes
She's got the best of me

You tell all your friends you got it made
Say I'm your ace in the hole
Let's give my wallet a rest
It's kinda getting out of control

You try to make me believe
There's nothing up your sleeve
So if you want a fat cat,
I'll be your sugar daddy
That's the price you pay to rock'n'roll

You're my high dollar honey
Hi $ honey
Got me in a financial squeeze
You know you're making it hard on my credit card
High dollar honey believes

She's my high dollar honey
Hi $ honey
Got me in a financial squeeze
You know you're making it hard on my credit card
High dollar honey
High dollar honey
She's got the best of me
