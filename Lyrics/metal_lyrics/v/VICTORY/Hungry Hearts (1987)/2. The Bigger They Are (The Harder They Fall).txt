So you're stuck between a rock and a hard place
No room up above
Getting stepped on once too often
Now the push comes to shove
You got what it takes my friend
You'll be the winner in the end

Feels like you got the weight of the world
On your broken back
Take aim, you gotta give it a shot
Can't beat the heat when you attack
Don't lose your faith my friend
You'll be the winner in the end

Just remember
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Little man don't ever stop
The bigger they are the harder they fall
There's plenty of room at the top

Don't get no respect from the boss man
Says you're a big disgrace
Instead of getting a pat on the back
You get a slap in the face
You got what it takes my friend
You'll be the winner in the end

Just remember
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Little man don't ever stop
The bigger they are the harder they fall
You'll always find there's plenty of room at the top

Just remember
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Little man don't ever stop
The bigger they are the harder they fall
There's plenty of room at the top

Just remember
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Little man don't ever stop
The bigger they are the harder they fall
You'll always find there's plenty of room at the top
