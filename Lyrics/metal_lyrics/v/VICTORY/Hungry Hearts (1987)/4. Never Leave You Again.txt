Babe's got tears in her eyes
Sorry to say, but it's true
Can't go on living like this
She needs her freedom to try something new
She says I got stars in my eyes
Saying my dreams are to blame
Can't stay home all alone
Only time will heal the pain

Same old dreams they reappear
Just like that look in your eyes
You cast your spell, now I can't escape
So baby, let me come back
Girl I'll never leave you again,
Leave you again

Last time I hit the road
Fame and fortune were mine
I threw caution to the wind
For one moment of sin
Living and loving it up all the time
Cause I'm a walking stick of dynamite
Got a short fuse
I shoot for the top, never lose
And I ain't gonna let nothing get in my way
I got the power right here when I play

Same old dreams they reappear
When you say your love never dies
You cast your spell with that look in your eyes
So baby, let me come back, girl
Girl I'll never leave you again,
Leave you again
Girl I'll never leave you again,
Leave you again

Same old dreams they reappear
When you say your love never dies
When you cast your spell with that look in your eyes
So baby, let me come back, girl
Girl I'll never leave you again,
Leave you again
Girl I'll never leave you again,
Leave you again
Girl I'll never leave you again,
Leave you again
Girl I'll never leave you again,
I'll never leave you again,
I'll never leave you again,
I'll never leave you again,
