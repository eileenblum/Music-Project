High, high love
Let 'em high

I need a little old sign
Tell me is it true
I need to know, I need to know,
Just what I'm gonna do

You tell me right now
I gotta do it somehow
I gotta try, I gotta try,
Get a message on through

You say it makes no difference
'Cause you won't believe
This pleasure cruise has lost its spell
And changed its course
Headed down a rocky road

So just look in the mirror - who do you see?
Look in the mirror - as plain as day to me
Look in the mirror - and you'll agree
Look in the mirror - only you got the key

I gotta little deal, the real real deal
I gotta deal, gotta deal, a deal that you can't refuse
Only time will tell, it'll really tell
It's a time, it's a time,
If you're gonna win or lose

To me it makes no difference
If you don't believe
This pleasure cruise has lost it's spell
And changed its course
Headed down a rocky road

So just look in the mirror - who do you see?
Look in the mirror - as plain as day to me
Look in the mirror - and you'll agree
Just look in the mirror - only you got the key

So just look in the mirror - who do you see?
Look in the mirror - as plain as day to me
Look in the mirror - and you'll agree
Just look in the mirror - only you got the key

Just look in the mirror - who do you see?
Look in the mirror - as plain as day to me
Look in the mirror
