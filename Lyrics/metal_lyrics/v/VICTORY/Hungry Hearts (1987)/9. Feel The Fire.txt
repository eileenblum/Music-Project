[Herman Frank/White - Charlie Huhn - Tommy Newton - Peter Knorn - Fritz Randow]

I stand here so empty
Frozen in time from the chill of your eyes
No escaping this bad dream
Tormenting my soul and twisting my mind
I knew it right from the start
You grabbed me right by my heart

Through the passion and desire
See my hunger for love
Watch the flames keep getting higher
Couldn't break out fast enough
Knew the danger, but wouldn't read the signs
Now I'm beckoning the call

Feel the fire
Burning what's left of my soul
Feel the fire
Now that your touch has gone cold oh yeah

Misadventure and temptation
Always knocking at my door
Took a step and then I stumbled
Now I'm lost forever more
Tried to change my ways, but never was forgiven
Now I'm echoing the call

Feel the fire
Burning what's left of my soul
Feel the fire
Now that your touch has gone cold oh yeah

I stand here so helpless
Somewhere back in time,
See the warmth of your eyes
With no escaping this bad dream
Tormenting my soul and melting my mind oh yeah

Feel the fire
Burning what's left of my soul
Feel the fire
Now that your touch has gone cold

Feel the fire
Burning what's left of my soul
Feel the fire
Now that your touch has gone cold oh yeah
