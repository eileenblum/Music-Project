[Herman Frank/White - Charlie Huhn - Tommy Newton - Peter Knorn - Fritz Randow]

Fighting all the odds of adversity
Striving for your freedom and security
All those dues you pay and pay but it's never enough
Pour your heart out time and again, going's always tough
The strong will survive so reach for the sky
And make your demands
United we stand
The future is in your hands

So hang tough - hungry hearts
Caught in the crossfire of making your mark
So hang tough - hungry hearts

Living with your back up against the wall
Swear you'll dedicate your life to escape it all
You'd sell your soul if you could get a lucky break
So shoot your best shot, your desire is what you make
So use all your magic, reach for the stars
And give your commands
United we stand
The future is in your hands

So hang tough - hungry hearts
Caught in the crossfire of making your mark
So hang tough - hungry hearts

So hang tough - hungry hearts
Caught in the crossfire of making your mark
So hang tough - hungry hearts
Caught in the crossfire of making your mark
So hang tough - hungry hearts
Caught in the crossfire of making your mark
So hang tough - hungry hearts
Caught in the crossfire of making your mark
So hang tough - hungry hearts
