I been looking at the way you walk
Bet you can really make your body talk
So come on, talk to me

I been watching you for quite some time
I'm just looking - hey, that ain't no crime
Getting testy, can't you see

Got the right circumstances
Take a chance on some quick romancing
I'll make my smooth advance
Hey baby, it works every time

But you run away
You run away
You run away
Come on and stay

I been running 'round eager to please
Taking advantage with my expert tease
Now I'm falling on my knees

You been taking everything you need
You hit and run and then you watch me bleed
Have mercy - baby, please

Got the right circumstances
Take a chance on some quick romancing
I'll make my smooth advance
Hey baby, it works every time

But you run away
You run away
You run away
Come on and stay

You run away
You run away
You run away
Come on baby and stay

But you run away
You run away
You run away
Come on baby and stay

You run away
You run away
You run away
Come on baby and stay

You run away
You run away
You run away
Come on baby and stay
