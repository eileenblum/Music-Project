You must have fallen right out of my dream
So here's a plan guaranteed to let off steam
I'll time my loving exactly right
And make my move in the heat of the night
So get ready, oh yeah

You can't go wrong, if the feeling's strong
Falling head over heels
Gotta have you today

So don't be too tough
Tough on love
No don't be tough
Tough on love
Don't be too tough
Tough on love
'Cause I play rough

I want some and I want it bad
I need more of what I just had with you babe, oh yeah
Listen close and don't you call my bluff
I play for keeps and, baby,
I play rough - so get ready, oh yeah

You can't go wrong, if the feeling's strong
Falling head over heels
Gotta have you today

So don't be too tough
Tough on love
No don't be tough
Tough on love
Don't be too tough
Tough on love
'Cause I play rough

So don't be too tough
Tough on love
No don't be tough
Tough on love
Don't be too tough
Tough on love
'Cause I play rough

Hey what do you saying gone
No I'm busy much
Come on
No I gotta go

You can't go wrong, if the feeling's strong
Falling head over heels
Gotta have you today

Don't be too tough
Tough on love
Don't be tough
Tough on love
Don't be too tough
Tough on love
'Cause I play rough

Don't be too tough
Tough on love
Be too tough
Tough on love
Don't be too tough
Tough on love
'Cause I play rough

Don't be too tough
Tough on love
No don't be tough
Tough on love
Don't be too tough
Tough on love
'Cause I play rough
