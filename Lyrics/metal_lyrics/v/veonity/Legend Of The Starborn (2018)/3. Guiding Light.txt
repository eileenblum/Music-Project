I saw the end, I lived it all
When mother Gaia died
I travelled far and heard the call
And now it's time to rise

A deadly realm where darkness reigned and a rose about to die
My heart was filled with heavenly rage
This time I will not fail

I will never leave your side
The voice that you hear is mine

Come with me far beyond this hell
Together we will stand, we're invincible
Look to the stars, I'm the shining light
That shows you the path and guides you back home

They came in peace to bring you all
Inventions from beyond
But they tried to change your ways of life
And cast your gods aside

As time went by intentions changed
They wanted to dominate
With weapons forged in astral flames
They tried to end our race

The light that will guide you home
Shining on you forever

Will you see it now, will you find the way
Out of the darkness and into the light
Can you hear them now, how they call your name
War cries of Asgard echoes through the night

Deep inside my heart you are still alive
An inner peace that's guiding me
Deep inside my broken heart
I still believe that you and me are destined to be set free
