We followed the righteous path
We were true and believing
In the glorious prophecy
The Starborn will come
For our salvation

Legends of terror and horrible screams
Are finally fading away

The war is now drawing near
With a heart of a dragon we face our fears
Nightfall and darkness in our sacred land, forever

Far in the distance I hear how it calls
Closer and closer
Now it's time to sail

The winds of Asgard blow
Leading the way into open sea
Filling the sails with power and might
That only a Viking can feel
The winds of Asgard roar
Bringing the victory to our swords
Enter into a new world
Where we forever are free

We sail into history
To be legends forever
And when humanity thinks of us
They will know that our death was glorious

We stand at the edge of our enemies blade
And they are ready to strike

We will never bow to them
Freedom and glory for our lands
Vikings united with our swords in hand

Onwards we are struggling
To a land of no return
The path is gone but we still press on
From the land where we were born
To where we hope we will return
When we are free for eternity

So we are riding on the storm
Drifting further from our home
We will search and we will find
A peace in our mind
Breaking loose from all the lies
Our people are reborn forever
