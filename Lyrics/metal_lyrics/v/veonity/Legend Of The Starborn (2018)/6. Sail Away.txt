Call to arms head out to fight
With steel in hand
We must sail out to find the key
We sail away across the seas
Until morning light appears
We praise our gods

For too long you have been trapped
Without a hope to find a way
And all was dark and you were drifting astray
Until I came to lead the way
On to distant shores in a distant place
Let's remember this glorious day
We sailed across the raging sea of fury

Brothers, masters of swords and seas
Brothers, bring us victory in life
Follow me into the island of our dreams

It's time to sail away
It's time to reveal
What's been hidden in time
It's time to break the chains
Break it with the power of gods
And the hammer of Thor

From beyond the seas we'll come
With our hope we found a way
The secret lies beneath the burning flames
The secret of our ancient tale
Onto distant shores in a distant place
We'll arrive in victorious ways
A quest beyond the raging sea of fury

Come bring me power of the sacred steel
Come bring me power of the warrior
Onto the island where the legend ends
And we shall all be free again
