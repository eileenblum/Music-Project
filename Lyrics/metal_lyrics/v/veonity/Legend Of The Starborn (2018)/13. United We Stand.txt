We travelled through space and time
To save mankind
With home in our minds
We cry out these words
Honour us, remember us

We stand at the battlefield in victory
The war has been won, Atlantis is gone
The time has come to leave this world

We stand here in armor with swords to the sky
Shields and hammers raised high
Blood have flown on this moonlit night
And now it is time to move on

We will never return again
To home my friend
With hope in our minds
We look to the sky
Save us now
protect us now

Dream,
we dream of the glorious hall of mighty Thor
With mead in our hands we'll cry out these words
Hail us now
Hail us now

We take off our armors and swords laid to ground
Heads are raised to the sky
The stars will guide us this moonlit night
Valhalla is where we belong

United we stand
United we fall
Warriors and common folk
The gods up in the sky
Together we did fight
Together we shall die
Warriors and common folk
Vikings undefeated in war
