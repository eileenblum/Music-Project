I don't know the man I am
I don't have an inner peace
I don't know what I've become
Lost in history

To a world of horror snow and ice
To Nordic realms that were under siege
From far beyond from darkness I arose
To bring the Vikings their rightful peace

A journey to the mystical isle
I did go on until I found the key
A journey of pain and despair
As foretold in legends to be

Carried by the flames of the holy fire
A gift from the gods above
Into this vortex of Valhalla's grace
In agony we raised our blades and screamed

To the ancient gods of thunder
To the guardians of the sea
I surrender my spirit and soul
To the gods
To the holy gods of glory
To the Warriors Of Time
I surrender now

We came ashore and broke the wall of lies
We raised our swords and our battle cries
Bound to die before the war was done
My death would lead them into the sun

Embraced by the darkness of space
I do not know my destiny
Ascending into the unknown
My spirit is finally free

Graced by the flames of the holy fire
Becoming a god above
Questing through nebulae roaming through space
They silently await the chosen one

My sacrifice to the guards the ancient steel
My sacrifice to the gods of glory
My sacrifice to the guards of the ancient steel
I'll surrender myself
I am god
