A spark that ignites
Paves way for the light
The sorrow is fading away
The slightest of hope
Will loosen the rope
Breath in the free air my heroes

We faced the quest for the human race
So mankind would prevail
The price we paid was high enough
Out of the darkness we go

It's time to go beyond the borders of the sun
It's time for us to reach Valhalla
It's time for us to come home
We're the long awaited sons
It's time for us to be together

Look at the sky, it's bursting to life
The Allfather heeds us at last
Heimdal our friend
We're blessed by your gaze
Show us the way out for heroes

The stars explode and blinds us all
But the darkness won't prevail
Valhalls dÃ¶rrar Ã¶ppna stÃ¥r
Och vi hÃ¤lsas utav Tor
