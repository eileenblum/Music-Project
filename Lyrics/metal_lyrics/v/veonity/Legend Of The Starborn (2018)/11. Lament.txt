Sorrow deep inside my chest
Like a winter storm it rages
Like a thirst that can't be quenched
Like a wound that will not heal

The world fades away
But the memories will stay
For eternity we all will pray

When the flame dies out and all we know is gone
An ember still reminds of our goal

Fallen in war, still we must go on
To the last embrace we carry you my friend
Rest here in peace, your memories still lives
For our time, you gave your life

Hollow deep inside my heart
Like a winter without snow
Like a face that can't be seen
Like a thorn without the rose

The world dies away
And only pain will stay
For all eternity we all will pray

For the fallen we cry
For our freedom they died
Into eternity they go
Lay their bodies to rest in the ground
Look to the sky
And listen to the sound
The lament of a fallen warrior
