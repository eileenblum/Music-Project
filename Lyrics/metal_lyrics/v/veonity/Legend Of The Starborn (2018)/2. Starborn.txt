Darkening skies, omen of coming storms
For all of our lives we stood so strong
Now we find ourselves running out of time
And the road we walk will take us to hell not home

Ages ago, we lost the voice of control
Poisoning even the purest of souls
We got trapped in dark
Without hope in our hearts
But the prophecy reads
He will return here

History came and history passed
Legend of the Starborn arose

Breaking the silence
The Asgard's call
Alliance forever
Standing tall
The war of the Vikings
Burns our soul
The tale of Atlantis rise and fall
Rising out of the ashes into the storm
Lead us the starborn one
Raise your voice and scream

Destiny's child, born out of mankind's despair
Dead and revived, a true Asgard's heir
And the truth is revealed for us all
And the chains that held us now are gone

The night is cold and silent
Forging this alliance
Vikings on the last crusade
A battle of light and darkness
Death is all around us
Still we carry on guided by the starborn one
