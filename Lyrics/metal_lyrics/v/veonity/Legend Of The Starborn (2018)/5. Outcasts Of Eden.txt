What we hope to find
We can not define
When chasing our dreams
Have made us blind
And we hope to save
All the things we have lost

We carry the fire forever more
Into the raging heart of the storm
Never believe in what you see
Believe in what you feel

What we once did hold
Is now dead and cold
Fulfilling the darkest prophecy
But we'll never fade into history

Suffer for all of your sinners
For what they have done
You can't bring us down
We rise above you all

Welcome to a world of fire and ice
We are the outcasts of Eden
The warriors of north
Vikings of winter land
