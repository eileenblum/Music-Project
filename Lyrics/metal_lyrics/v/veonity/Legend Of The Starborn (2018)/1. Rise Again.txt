Closer than ever, a light in the dark
A power within comes alive
Carried by fire, by wind and by might
To bring back the wisdom to steel

Riding through heavens to fight for our life
The warrior of terror must die
Sent by the guardians of space and of time
To fight for the freedom of men

Hail, the Starborn arrives
Hail, destroyer of lies

The fury of the storm, a thunder lights the sky
The burning flames they carry me away

And we shall rise again
To free our world
The power lies within us all
Valhalla lies ahead
We shall rise again
To free our world
The tyrant of Atlantis will fall

Fled from destruction, hatred and pain
But salvation was here all along
We have to unite and be stronger than all
Or else our Eden will fall

Hail, the Starborn arrives
Hail, destroyer of lies

The fury of the storm, a thunder lights the sky
The burning flames they carry me away

Vikings raise your banners high
Swords and axes to the sky
Flames of glory lights the night
Vikings we will win this fight

Rise again
We shall defeat the tyrant
Rise again
Rise and unite for victory

And we shall rise again
And we shall stand as one
