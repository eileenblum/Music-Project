Deep inside the forbidden mountain
In a burning sea of blood
Lies the mysterious hidden weapon
That no one could wield
But now I'm here from beyond the stars
With strength beyond strength
With a heart of fire I rode through time
To defend the human race

A weapon forged in the heat of death
By a god with no name
A million years ago on this day
The quest is almost at end

Pitch-black dark on an endless road
Deeper down we go
Undead souls, an ancient gods
Silently watch us roam
Suddenly we see the light
And a man that's ten feet tall
He turns around and his shining eyes
Pierces through my soul

"Are you the one that the prophecy foretold?
Hold out your hand and we will know."
I know the path I must go

For the future of mankind
I will raise the hammer to the sky
With the power of the gods
I will ride victorious through the light
I'm the warrior of the north

In my hands I hold the power of the gods so high above
The warrior of an ancient prophecy that brings Atlantis to it's knees

On this glorious day
The gods smiled upon us
We have been given the weapon
Needed to fulfill the duty imposed on us
From this day forward, our destiny is now in our own hands
When we ride into war I ask of you all:
Make it a day to remember
And you all shall be remembered
