We have now heeded the Asgard's call
We have fulfilled what was written in stone
It's time to raise our voice and scream
"Heimdal, show us the way!"

Through Bifrost far from our dying land
We'll meet the fate that we all know must come
And now we stand in a far away land
This is the battle where all will end

The war will be won, if we all stand as one
So into the last crusade we go

Proudly we stand at the gates of hell
The price will be paid with the blood of men
And as we die their kingdom will fall
The fire is lit and the flames consumes them all

Our hearts are pure and our purpose clear
We have endured to defend our world
And as we stand at our enemies shores
Their realm shall tremble and die

For all the pain that they brought to us
For all the ones that will fall in this war
To save our world and to rescue mankind
We must believe what the stars have defined

Atlantis enslaved us and brought us despair
We will tear down the walls when the Starborn is here

The sun was setting upon the shores of our realm
We watched it fade away
As we sailed into the storm
And said forever farewell to our home
Farewell, farewell,
Forever farewell

Wield your sword and slash your way through hell
The last words you'll remember
Is this story that we tell
