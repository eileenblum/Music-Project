Stand up tall and face your fate
Death can be fought, but never escaped
The time is now to fulfill your vows
The winner is still unknown

We must believe that the stories are true
We stand united with you

Blood and pain is all I am
Nothing but death in front of my eyes
I came to fight and fight I will
Strike the enemy down

Far in the distance out in the fields
The battle for freedom begins

The freedom Vikings charge
Into history we go
And no matter how it ends
This is our only chance
In every corner of the world
Our battle call is heard
With the last of Atlantis dying
A new world will begin

If you fall, rise again
The deadly wounds will heal my friend
With sword in hand, and pride inside
We will be blessed by the light

For the future of mankind
We have sailed away to die
But when the morning light appears
We will have vanquished all our fears
Freedom

As the scream of the dying fades
I look upon this world
The deeds I've done and the lives I took
Will haunt me until the end
I left my soul in space
To save the human race
I will always do what has to be done
For the salvation of mankind
