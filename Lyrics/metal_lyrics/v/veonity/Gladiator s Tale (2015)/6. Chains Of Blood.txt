Out from the darkness, carried by the gods
A new hope rose inside the gladiator
And the taste of victory awakes his hunger for freedom

As the days are growing darker
And the stains of blood dries up
And my heart is broken
I remember my call
I remember my promises

And follow my heartâs desire
And carry my steel
Cause now thereâs no turning back
Through fire and blood I must go

Oh oh oh
Heading out for war
Oh oh oh
To break the chains of blood
Oh oh oh
Brothers heed my call
Oh oh oh
Letâs ride out to break the chains
The chains of blood

For too long I have been trapped
In the shadows of my mind
With no hope of glory
I was destined to fight,
Taught the way of the warrior

To ride with my sword
Pressed to my steel
Cause now thereâs no turning back
Through fire and blood I must go

Oh oh oh
Heading out for war
Oh oh oh
To break the chains of blood
Oh oh oh
Brothers heed my call
Oh oh oh
Letâs ride out to break the chains
The chains of blood

Oh oh oh oh
Iâm breaking chains of blood tonight
Iâm breaking chains of blood tonight
Iâm breaking chains of blood tonight
Iâm breaking chains of blood tonight

Iâll carry my steel
Cause now thereâs no turning back
Through fire and blood I will go
