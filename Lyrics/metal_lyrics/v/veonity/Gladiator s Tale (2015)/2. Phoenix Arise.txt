The flame Inside him that where quenched long ago is once
again ignited by the memory of his fatherâs word.

Out of the darkness forever, the night is finally gone
Ascending to the next level, time to reap whatâs been sown

Somewhere lies it all, the key to who I am
Lead me through the trap youÂ´ve set
IÂ´ll fool you in the end
Dead and gone still I will revive

Spread my wings like a phoenix IÂ´ll rise
They spoke of truth just to feed me with lies
My ashes will remain, as a sign for all the pain
Spread my wings like a Phoenix IÂ´ll fly
The wounds will close when I pull out the knife
Nothing is forever, like a phoenix I will rise

Gladiator of Rome on the surface
But with vengeance in my heart
When itâs time your neck meets my sword
Your blood will stain the floor

Deep inside your mind
You know what you will find
I will judge you in the end and as you burn in flames
Dead and cold, I have just revived

Flying away like a phoenix
Dead and gone
Fly away
Phoenix arise
