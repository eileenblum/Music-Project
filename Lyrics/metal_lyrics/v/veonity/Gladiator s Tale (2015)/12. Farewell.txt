At the very end, when the fight is finally over and won and justice is done
he embraces his own death and meets his father in the afterlife
Great deeds will echo throughout history.

When you close your eyes
Do you see what I see?
The empire in flames
And when you turn to walk away
Is our mission now complete?

I trusted in steel
Greatness awaits me
See the hammer fall

Soldiers charging in
To serve and protect
An empire burning
I have done what Iâve came do to
Fulfilled my dying fathers wish

The blood burns within my veins
I see the light so clear
Glory in death awaits
Today I have no fear

To my friends I say farewell
But I will remember you
Until the day I die
Because this is my destiny
I'll be on my way to a land far beyond
So this is farewell

Oh I go into the world of metal
Let me go into the world of metal

To my friends I say farewell
But I will remember you
Until the day I die
Because this is my destiny
I'll be on my way to a land far beyond
So this is farewell
