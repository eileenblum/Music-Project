On a blood soaked ground, In the final fight,
he crushes his enemies and wins his freedom

Down in the wasteland
Of the deepest despair
I battled my way
Through blood and dust
In this filthy and unholy game

But I have seen the truth, I have seen paradise
And thatâs the reason why I shall arise

For the glory of the king
For the glory of the gods
For the glory of our beloved home
For the honor and the pride
For the truth I will ride
For the glory of all mankind

By the mercy of the emperor
Through courage and strength
And a heart made of steel
I am free at last
From this filthy and unholy game

Because I have seen the blood, the pain and agony
And that is why Iâll slay my enemy

For the glory of the king
For the glory of the gods
For the glory of our beloved home
For the honor and the pride
For the truth I will ride
For the glory of all mankind

I hear them calling out my name
I hear them cry for Liberty
I heed the call
I carry on

I am the only one, who can restore the realm
I am the only one
