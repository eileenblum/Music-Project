Tired from running and fighting he kneels before the gods
Praying for power and wisdom to carry out the quest he once sat out for

Here I am, born as a warrior
Lost in this empire where love and truth is by long forgotten

Hear me now, as I bow my head
Ancient gods from above give me strength to avenge our slavery

Searching for a light inside the dark
Shadows of fear
Watching as the emperor grows strong
I must go on

And be true to what I know is right
And be true to myself
And be true for all mankind to see
So Iâll be what Iâm meant to be

Iâm born to be a warrior of steel
No one can deny me my destiny
Iâm born to ride on wings of fate
I'll make them believe, I'll force them to see
Iâm the warrior of steel

On my knees praying for wisdom, honor and pride
To charge right into the dragonâs den

So Iâll be true to what I know is right
So Iâll be true to myself
So Iâll be true for all mankind to see
So Iâll be what Iâm meant to be

Iâm born to be a warrior of steel
No one can deny me my destiny
Iâm born to ride on wings of fate
I'll make them believe, I'll force them to see
Iâm the warrior of steel

I know I have failed sometimes before
I know I have stumbled and fall
But still I carry on
Still I carry on
