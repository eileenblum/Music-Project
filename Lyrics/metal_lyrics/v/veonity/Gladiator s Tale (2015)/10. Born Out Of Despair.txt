The darkness that once was a deadly poison is now a vitalizing injection.
Use whatever means necessary to reach the goal.

I have lived for eons, I have walked by your side
Your lies has lead me here
I know thy nature, I have looked in to your eyes
Felt the darkness that grows deep inside

I can grant you your deepest desire
Let me forge your destiny in fire

Born out of despair
Into this world falling forever
Run, you canât be saved
You are my slave
Lives will be torn apart
Your sympathy, it belongs to me
Iâll grant you an epic war
Thereâs no end in sight
Iâm the fading light

I can see your envy, you want what they have
It can all be yours
I can give you glory, I can make your dreams come true
Just say my name and Iâll be there

Gold and flesh, to your desire
Your soul is all that I require

Born out of despair
Into this world falling forever
Run, you canât be saved
You are my slave
Lives will be torn apart
Your sympathy, it belongs to me
Iâll grant you an epic war
Thereâs no end in sight
Iâm the fading light

Your empty life is crumbling with the sands of time
I will always walk by your side till the end
Freedom dies on the other side
I will wait for you in the dark
In your mind, I whisper lies
I will live forever
