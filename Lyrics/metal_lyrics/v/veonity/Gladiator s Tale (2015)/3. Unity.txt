The seemingly endless journey takes its toll on his soul
But in the darkest hours his fatherâs spirit walks beside him
Whispers of the past and the time to come
Encouraging, scaring and forces him to press on

Standing at the gates that leads me to your heart
Will you open it, or close it forever?
The key is in your mind, remember where it lies
And Iâll be there beside you when you open up your eyes

Running out of time, lost inside the void
Falling deep, to eternal sleep

Running in the dark, on a road that is unmarked
Seek the light, we must survive
And make it out alive

The fire in my heart burns forever
Nothing in this world will tear this apart
The truth in your voice cries like thunder
Together for this final fight
In Unity we ride through the night

Walking down the path that takes me straight in to your mind
Where the memories we shared lives forever
Clouded is your sight, it comes as no surprise
For the enemy has poisoned the air with his lies

Trust me with your life, open up your eyes
Remember now, spread your wings and fly

Right here by your side is no need to hide
Brace yourself for this final fight
Our world must survive

The fire in my heart burns forever
Nothing in this world will tear this apart
The truth in your voice cries like thunder
Together for this final fight
In Unity we ride through the night

Standing all alone
Looking in to your eyes as life fades away
What will I become when there is no one left to die for?
Is this the end for us my friend or will we meet again?
