Faith turns and with a broken spirit and no hope of survival there
seems to be only one way out

On the path to the heart of Rome
On my own away from home
Iâm caught alive and dragged to this dome
Chained and enslaved, forced into battle
Never to fulfill what Iâve pledged

Running out time, itâs too late
I wonât return again
I will never be the same again

So let me die
Let me break away from madness and decay
So let me die
I will leave this life in peace and harmony
So let me die
Let me show the world the way
And save a million tears
So let me die
So let me show
Let me break away to live another day

No remorse and no regret
I have played the game as it was set
Iâm a warrior of god, born to fight
This is the way Iâve lived
This is the way Iâll die
With my blood-red sword raised to the sky

Running out time, itâs too late
I wonât return again
I will never be the same again

So let me die
Let me break away from madness and decay
So let me die
I will leave this life in peace and harmony
So let me die
Let me show the world the way
And save a million tears
So let me die
So let me show
Let me break away to live another day
