A fatherâs last story of the betrayal that ruined their land
Although the past is gone, the future lies within his sons grasp
He just has to realize it

When your light is gone I will shine forever
Blinding their sight with our victory

With the morning light they came, bringing fire and destruction
Swords and spears striking down with force, damnation by their hands
Our land lies barren dry, nothing grows or ever will
A way to ensure our death for generations to come

Now when you gaze upon the world, do you see what I see?
Illusions of history, the remnants of our home.
Now itâs time to leave behind what is wrong and what is broken
Now the time is here my son, you will make them pay for what theyÂ´ve done

Yes now the time has come to ride into eternity
I have finally realized

When the darkness falls I will charge right into Rome
Hiding in the open I will bide my time
When your light is gone I will shine forever
Blinding their sight with our victory

I have to go, Iâm gonna leave this world, forever fighting on
Forever strong into another life, time to be free again

When your light is gone itÂ´s my time to shine
I will be free for eternity
