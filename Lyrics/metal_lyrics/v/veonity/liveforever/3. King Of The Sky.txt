In the final hour he has found a way into the chambers of the emperor.
His lust for vengeance and the favor of the gods makes him unbeatable.

War was forced upon our people
An intruder infected our soil
His armies stretched to the horizon
We were outnumbered a hundred to one

But we fought him hard
He grew weaker by the day
We watched as fear grew in his eyes

And we saw the light
That shined on us all
With the wind in our back
We cried out a freedom call

God of wind, rain and thunder
Tear this infidel asunder
Give us wing and make us fly
Hail to you
The king of the sky

Now Iâm heading to heart of the dragon
To get our vengeance and return our land
When he will see the flame that burns deep inside me
Than he will know his empire will fall

So remember all
How we fought and died
For man to be free again

From tyranny
Oppression and hate
In victory our memory remains

God of wind, rain and thunder
Tear this infidel asunder
Give us wing and make us fly
Hail to you
The king of the sky

Through strength of man his world will crumble and
His time will come to an end
For I prepare to die
With the sword still in my hand

So say what you will
I see through your lies
Iâll never surrender
Your here in my sight

Come what may come
I'll stand and fight
For you are the darkness
And I am the light

In history they will not read
That the victory came through the deeds of man

God of wind, rain and thunder
You tore this infidel asunder
You gave us wing and made us fly
Hail to you
The king of the sky
