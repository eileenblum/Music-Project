Trapped inside the Coliseum
All hope seems lost but yet he fights on
Hoping his mission will succeed

Help me now, I stand alone
Forsaken without of faith
An unmarked grave awaits

I am growing weak
I cannot find the strength to carry on
I just wish I could lay down for a wile

I was born to fight and I fight to stay alive
Out of blood and dust a new man will arise
I pay the price

Brothers in arms we are born without fear
Beyond the life lay eternity
When night turns to day, the darkness will fall
We live under the spell of the call
We are slaves in a holy war

As the day goes by
I think of home and life I left behind
I close my eyes and Iâm there, inside my mind

But my faith is sealed; it needs me to stay strong
On the battle field thatâs where I belong
So hear my cry

Brothers in arms we are born without fear
Beyond the life lay eternity
When night turns to day, the darkness will fall
We live under the spell of the call
We are slaves in a holy war

Women and children they run for their lives
Men called to arms they are ready to die
Charging with hammers held high
We ride in like a storm from the sky

Brothers in arms we are born without fear
Beyond the life lay eternity
When night turns to day, the darkness will fall
We live under the spell of the call
We are slaves in a holy war
