The moon is rising again
Shining its empty light
On me and all the warriors
Who lives deep in the night

Tonight I'll rise, Iâll ride again
For mankind and glory
I'll fight, I'll rise and fly again
Always be strong to the end

I will not give up, never give in
Keep on suffering
I will not give up, never give in
Until the day that I die

My body is broken my friend
But my spirit remains the same
I dream to find a better place
To rebuild the human race

Iâm here alive, Iâm born to find
My power and glory
Iâm here, alive, I'm born to fly
Always be strong till the end

I will not condemn my spirit 
To burn eternally
I will not be taken down
By forces I can't see
You can bring me sorrow and
You can bring me pain
But I will fight till the end
