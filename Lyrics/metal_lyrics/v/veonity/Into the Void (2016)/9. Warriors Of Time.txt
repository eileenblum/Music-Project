I thought I met the end
Than life did strike again
But the deepest of my fears calls out to me
-The end of time has come-

8 000 000 light years 
I have travelled through space
Iâve crossed the borders to a spiral galaxy
And there it was, the mystery of space
An entity of nothingness, a presence in the dark

Iâm trapped inside this nightmare, where shadows blind my sight
Paralyzed by panic and I cannot see the light
In the heart of darkness, life is not the same
But the guardians of the universe erase my pain

Oh we are warriors
We are the ones who guard the gates 
We are warriors of time
Oh we are warriors
We are guardians
Of the past and future
We are the warriors of time

Since the dawn of time
They have dwelled and despaired
The gate must be protected till the hero comes
So here I am the traveler of time
Savior of humanity, glory to us all

They carry me through fire, a shadow quest of pain
They see what I desire, my missions not in vain
They send me through the black hole, reversing time again
But the guardians of the universe erase my pain

Fight on
For the future
