âYou have slept for ages
Now itâs time to open up your weary eyes
And gaze upon the lifeless sky
For many million light years
You have roamed across the endless empty void
now the fail-safe has been deployedâ

Slowly coming alive
âAll your vital signs look goodâ
Bring me power and light
âEverything is onâ
Show me where I've arrived
âLocation unknownâ
Is there something ahead of us?

âNothing but infinity, stars and endless space
You will be alone forever, the end of human raceâ
Will I ever reach a planet, a hope for human kind
Or will I end in frozen sadness, an intergalactic grave

âBut Iâm a failure
As my systems crash, I slowly fade away
And everything decays
Initiate the shutdown
And the life support will end in all but days
Find your path and never strayâ

Is this really the end?
âRedirecting power sourceâ
I will never survive
âA solar storm approaching fastâ
A celestial sphere?
âA halo of deathâ
Bring me the power to make it through

âNothingness and empty voids, stars and solar storms
Face your fear and fight forever, eternity may endâ
I shiver so deep down inside, my blood has turned to ice
Will this end in solar madness or will I find a way to rise?
Stars align in the end
They lead me on
The stars will align
To the bitter end I go

âStars align in the end weâll meet again
Stars begin to mend my broken soulâ

âNothing but infinity, stars and endless space
Face your fear and fight forever, eternity must end
Lost in the infinity, in the endless wide of space
You will be alone forever, everything is goneâ
