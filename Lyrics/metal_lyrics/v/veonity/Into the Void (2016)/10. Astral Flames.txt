I think about the lifeless times when life was so unkind
On and on the betrayal kept me tied to anger
But once again I opened up the gate to my mind
And there I was stronger than before

I thought about the times it could be over
But I saw the light, again I will return

In astral flames I drift astray
I break through space and time
In interstellar dreams I hide
Itâs heavenly, but not divine
Marked by infinityâs sign	
I will revive

I found myself in a mystic sphere with no light to be seen
Inside my head a voice from far beyond
âRemember, we denied your soul 
a frozen grave and sent you down your pathâ
And there it was the sign I waited for

In astral flames I drift astray
I break through space and time
In interstellar dreams I hide
Itâs heavenly, but not divine
Marked by infinityâs sign
I will revive

Fighting on Iâm never giving in
Resurrection pierced my dying soul
Lighting up a fire almost gone
The battle of a lifetime has been won
