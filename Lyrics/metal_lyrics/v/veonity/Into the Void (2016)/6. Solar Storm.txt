(Cannibal Coronal Mass Ejection)
Helpless and afraid that death was on its way
And everything I did was in vain
Iâm faster than the speed of light
But I cannot escape
Eruptions from the giants in the sky

Gamma ray arrives
A heliosphere of light
A burst of fire ends the night

Solar storm, devours me
Incinerate my deepest core
A Solar storm, the last frontier
A vortex made of holy light

Experience the force of a total solar storm
Nothing to do when the hammer falls
Melting off my skin as its pulling me in
Inviting me to join them in heaven

Gamma rays so heavenly
Becomes my freedom call
Itâs time to leave this pain at last

Solar storm, devours me
Incinerate my deepest core
A Solar storm, the last frontier
A vortex made of holy light
