Riding through the sky
Dead but still alive
Chained and enslaved for your crimes

Frozen through time
Imprisoned in my mind
Now see the world through my eyes

I drift into infinity
Destination unknown
I'll meet the end alone

Cryogenic dreams
Nothingâs what it seems
Madness is what I believe in

Endlessly in pain
It's driving me insane
Memories of life start to fade

I drift into infinity
Destination unknown
I'll meet the end alone

Fire and water are crushing the earth
Humanity is burning in flames
Remember the good times that carry us home
When the people of earth will be gone
Carry on

When fire burns the world
When fire burns us all

From the raging seas and burning hills our explorer 
courageously took off to the stars. 
Into the cold empty void with a small hope to find refuge in space. 
As the sky opened up, the stars reflected a glimmer of hope in his sparkling eyes
