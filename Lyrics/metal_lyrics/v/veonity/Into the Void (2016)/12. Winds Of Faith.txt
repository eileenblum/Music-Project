I am back in times of old, this fight I will not fight alone
Madness laying further down the line
Where everyone will face the end of time

We are the same in many ways but different in our hearts
Exploration is your goal but Iâm here to take control

I stand up for freedom; we have to save our Eden
My demons defeated, Iâve found the missing pieces
Warriors of life 

Faded away in their silent embrace
The wind beneath my wings
Was created by their dreams
Life passed me by as I travelled back in time
Carried by the winds of faith

They will never understand
That their reign must come to end
All my life Iâve waited for this sign
For something to ease my troubled mind

âYou keep on walking down this path and pushing us aside
You will use your last resource and we are bound to dieâ

Weâre screaming, weâre bleeding, weâll die to save our Eden
Your progress ainât needed, our freedom call is heeded
Warriors of life

Aeons ago we were born out from the night
A journey of deliverance into the glorious morning light
But greed struck us all, the beginning of our fall
I search for life beyond the skies, but I found truth behind the lies
Behind the lies

Their vision my mission, a Nordic expedition
