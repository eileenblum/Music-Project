If the darkness is to deep and your will is far too weak
The demons in your head screams and makes you mad
The present proved you wrong
The future is now gone
And the only things thatâs left 
Is to change your destiny

Never give up, reach for the top
Youâll never fall if you reach for the stars
Cause the fire that burns in your heart will survive
If this hymn still sings in your mind

And with a heart on fire
My mission carries on
And I will ride through time
And answer to the call
And with a heart on fire
In a vessel made of steel
So my destiny can be fulfilled

If your life is built on lies
And the sun never seems to rise
Listen to the sound of a warriorâs battle cry
The power lies within, a new story can begin
Never lose your faith, dream your fears away

We stand by your side warriors of time
Your fears burn away within astral flames
Cause the fire that burns in your heart will survive
With this hymn of magic inside
