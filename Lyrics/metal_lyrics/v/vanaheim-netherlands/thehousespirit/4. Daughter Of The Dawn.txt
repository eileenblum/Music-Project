Storms arise 
With giant waves of death 
When a lightning will strike the earth 
Peaceful vales quake and burst in flames 
Hear the sound of hidden stories 
Which were whispered in the wind 
Walls of stone crush into the depth of the sea 
Never forget the pact between life and death 

Howling wind spreads the seed of heavy rains 
Summon ancient ghosts of the sparkling flame 
In the rhythm of tides time remains 
Wilderness is calling 

Spirits of the oldest realm 
Come alive and bring the fate of our soil 
Fate of our soil 

Power of the sun 
Dry out the deepest lakes 
Force every spark of life into dust 
Where the future lies ahead 
Rain will collect your stream 
All dust turns into bloom 
The night awakes a shadow of silence 
Come and take a breath in the morning dawn 

Coldness of water, warmth of the sun 
Cover the sorrow with your protecting hand 
Create new life where death leads your land 
Come alive daughter of dawn 

Howling wind spreads the seed of heavy rains 
Summon ancient ghosts of the sparkling flames 
In the rhythm of tides time remains 
Natureâs rage is calling 

Natureâs wrath is cold 
Frost takes every life in chains 
Itâs the balance of spring and fall 
That creates fortune or distress 
When the night comes up and the shadows spread again 
Souls of the green slowly fade into a grey 
Till the dawn arises and the time stands still
