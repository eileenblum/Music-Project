In a gnarly forest of the ancient night 
The way is lost and hidden in conspiracy 
A glowing fire is lighting the abode 
Darkness befalls the everlasting green 
The sun has set and there is no way to go 
Surrounded by the whispers of the creaking woods 
Big Shadows are falling from the moon 
Coldness arises from the humid sparkling soil 

From a far coppice where the treetops fall asleep 
Voices are arising along their way 
Getting stronger with every single step 
Never heard this sound amidst of the Night 

Has the time come for a myth coming true? 
The reason for the harm, a reason for the plague 
Is it really true what the old have told? 
Nasty little feet bring the harm in our home 

The story of the old dwarven chant 
Always told by the oldest wood 
Never to be seen, never to be heard 
A human oath since knighthood 
Rumors being spread and lies go around 
Knights will revere and kings were crowned 
No one will bear, no one will dare 
An unforgettable sound 

Now so loud that it shakes the earth 
A reverential murmur, response from the roots 
The wood is pulling tight and the fire starts to flee 
There is no way to hide, no way to go 
A feast has begun in the winterâs decade 
Now they are ready to show their face 
Humanâs harm is their joy of life 
A bloody massacre will end this day 

Should I run or should I rather climb? 
Where is the escape, where am I safe? 
They are near, surrounded by them 
This is the end, the slaughter has come 

A Myth was told 
A myth has been told so long ago 
A Myth was told 
A myth has been told so long ago 

Has the time come for a myth coming true? 
The reason for the harm, a reason for the plague 
Is it really true what the old have told? 
Nasty little feet bring the harm in our home 

Burning roofs and flying axes 
Whetting blades that compose a song 
A forgotten melody refreshed by the blood 
The chant which will once rise again
