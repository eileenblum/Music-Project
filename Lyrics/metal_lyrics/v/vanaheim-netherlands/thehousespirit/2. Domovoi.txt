Little gnome with scraggy hair 
That keeps harm in every morn 
Dark, alone as an elder born 
Letâs summon and hold the scorn 
Within the night a shadows creeps 
Between dreams it stalks and talks 
It makes sounds out of wooden poles ?
Chill in the dark âtill the dawn that comes 

Into the dark, it crawls to kill the one 
A charlatan, that howls in the night 
and occults the sun, souls getting smited 
Unsafe, in front of the evil eyes, it dies 
Another night, unveil the wrath of the damned ancestors 

Domovoi your beard is a witness of time 
We will honor you appearance 
Be gracious 

Oh Domovoi, oh Domovoi 
We will pray for your joy 
Oh Domovoi, bring us luck 
And endow our tribe 

Hundreds of souls contains your mind 
Hollow voices deep in the night 
Whistling, laughing and noisy stumps 
Little ghost above the stove 
Backed bread, milk and salt 
Warming places that cheer your mind 
Swinging dances around the barn 
Daily prayers bring your delight 

Never let the fire come to an end 
and gets cold like a stone to your closest friend 
Where the daily grind covers your soul inside 
There should be no sorrow, but joy and pride 

The smallest things that seem to be hidden 
Alone and dark 
Become alive, beset 
Until you are dead
