There were always a few seconds in between my transformation of the world
Where a thought would sink its fangs in my spirit.
And there were always moments that appeared before my eyes to force me to live the way one ought to live,
If they were interested in living.
All of these were never bad
And never could be bad so long as I was interested in living.
If I were interested in dying then I lived my way to my death.
This way I only saw what ought to have been seen, if one were interested in seeing.
