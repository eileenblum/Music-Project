They were alive now...did not die out The blood relationship that did not die out did not die outThey were alive in They lives... This ageThey called it... "The red carpet day" This Fear... This ageCome again... That Fear Fear lives... This ageThey called it... "The red carpet day" This Fear... This ageThey called it... Yuka ni egakareteita karera wo shoumei suruKubikazari ni niseta shinku no chouIma mo hirakitsudzuketeru akai hanabira ni madoromuFurueru yubisaki ni karamaru
