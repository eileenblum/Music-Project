In terror you cry your fear again
Before the jaws of Abaddon
Feelings are torn off from your skin
Devoured soul returns to hell on earth

A thousand deaths and more you pass
Once born of mortal flesh

A long one is this road of suffering
A dark eternal path of life
Once you saw the light of Satan's star
Too proud, you fool turned away

Ten thousand deaths and more you pass
Once failed to find your Self
Arrogance bred thoughts of being a god
Blind to His works, there's no way

Bow to the truth to pass the gates

Bow to the one behind the jaws

Again you stand and face the torture
In the jaws of Abaddon
The price of another wasted life
Is more than a soul can take

A billion deaths and more you pass
Once turned away from light
Await for Satan to send another spark
To set your soul in flames again
