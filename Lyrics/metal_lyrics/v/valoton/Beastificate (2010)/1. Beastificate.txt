From the top of the man-shaped mountain
Begins a narrow path
Descend to a beast among the others
The ascend to become a star

In the raging seas of Chaos
Frail structures of mankind shake
Not having faith in Satan
Blindly believing in fate

The armies march
Under the bleeding crescent moon
Under the rusted star of David

From the top of the man-shaped mountain
Beastific visions dwell
First to turn slaves into beasts
Then into rulers of Hell

The armies march
Under the bleeding crescent moon
Under the rusted star of David

The mankind crawls
Under incompetent sign of the cross
Under re-enforced eternal wheel of the sun

Be prepared to kill
That what you are
Be prepared to carve
Your soul out from your flesh

Wounds from Satan's sword never heal

Beastificate
