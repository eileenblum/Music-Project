A thermonuclear sunrise
Declaration of destruction to this earth
A morning not brought by nature
But by the greed of man

Morningstar will light our end
Chaos devours this cosmic plane
Rotten course of existence
Will finally rest in ashes

Atom will boil this unpure blood away
Cleansing the decadent flesh
In death and pain
Lies understanding and fulfilment

Man's efforts to control this world
Fall down to dust with his life
Peace does not hold, love does not rule
The eternal life remains unfound

His science does not save him
Blending the cultures won't help
Instead they act as the instruments
Of balance through his demise
