To protect your from the Truth
Sancta Scientia

The light is dim in the  night
It is all they wish to see

Hypnotized by the glow
That reflects from your eyes
Hypocritical sense of control
Over your mind, body and life

Explanations as your shield
Research and studies all you need
To feel safe, secure and without fear
Of the infinite insanity that's unclear

Physics to rule your environment
Chemistry to enslave the elements
Biology to master your physical form
Theology to captivate eternal soul

The light is dim in the night
You don't dare to turn your eyes
Towards the devouring darkness

Sancta Scientia

Comforting words to ease your mind
Sancta Scientia

The Holy Bible of the modern world
Sancta Scientia
