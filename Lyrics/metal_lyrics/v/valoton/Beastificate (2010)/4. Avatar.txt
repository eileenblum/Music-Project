Sent down by the Gods
To lead the war
The holy flame
In his eyes

His voice claims the air
His hands molds the earth
His sword ends nations
For a higher cause

New age of humanity
Grows through atrocity
A path of pain and blood
Leads to utopia

So we work
And we kill

So we work and kill
For Blood and Will

Avatar
The sword of the Gods
