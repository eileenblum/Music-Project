Madness
Deranged
Institution
Mindless slaves
Herd the flock
In the shadows
Men of cloth
Shall burn internal

Lost sheep child abandoned
Innocence betrayed deadly molestation
Holy unholy hidden indoctrination
Perversion disease forbidden manipulation

BLIND you serve your master
WEAK your child the lamb

I reject all religions
I defy your gods
I dictate my existence
I resist enslavement

DEATH will greet him soon
BLOOD the priest will spill

I reject all religion
I defy your gods
I dictate my existence
I resist enslavement

LUST the savage stalks in vain
EVIL the victim tortured prey

DEMONS RITUAL
BLOOD SACRIFICE
KILL INNOCENCE
BETRAYAL IN DARKNESS

I reject all religions
I defy your gods
I dictate my existence
I will kill the priest the MONSTER!
