Abandon the constructs that haunt your mind
Accept the darkness the chaos inside
The black eyes watch over us as we destroy!
The heard overpopulates infections will grow
Release the plague, death has come
The ancients return to claim their sons
The Architects of the Black Death heed their call
Masters, creators, destroyers of all
The Architects of Death
The Architects of Death
