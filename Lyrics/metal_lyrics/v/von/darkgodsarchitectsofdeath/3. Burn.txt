The end has come
They have mislead their flocks
Protocols enslave the weak will fear!
Embrace the final event is here
Burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Witness the destruction
The pain of slow death awaits us all
For unjust brutal punishment
No mercy unfolds in silence 
Burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
Our time is up for its time to die
Internal sickness infects us blind
Our will to survive the luminous death
Fallout will come when the skys turn red
No place to run too you will burn
