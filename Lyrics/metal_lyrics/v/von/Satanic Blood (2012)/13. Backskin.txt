Bleed insides excise within 
Backskin death 
Thoughts final hallucination 
In my dream protecting 

Backskin whore 
Insane mortal 
Pale skin devil 
Peel the skin off 

Rip strip pull the skin off 
How will he live past it never afraid? 
Is it forsake of dying? 
The tide pulls sail off war pig 

Backskin devil 
Insane mortal 
Instant rage 
Murder end game 

Living for years 
Thoughts grew suffering disgrace 
Gone to sea salutation deaths skull devil weeping 
In false skin of death 

False guard instinct 
Bloody thoughts 
On to my last deed 
Kill murder kill 

Insane thoughts 
He wants to live with it 
Insane life 
It'll strap hold of ya 
I fought this 
It crushed me 
Dead 
It's all gone
