Dissection Inhuman from a shallow grave 
Some will settle for to die in vain 
Unless you bury the bones cover the stacks 
Once you pray the blessing fuck it! throw em in the hole 
Your fucking rope pass and pull it 
Pray to the holy mortal make the box 
Lots to burn if you save the eyes 
Death without obstruction dead mortal 
Stick em up on my throne arm to arm 
Bleed out to get our dissident soul 
Dissication of body torn ripped apart 
Tissue taken from the pile of bones 
Torn from a killed body 
The life the dissident soul 
Belongs to me 
I consecrate the soul 

Visions of dead bodies 
InHuman body 
It is a man yet we cannot determine its age 
For its splattered with blood 
All internal within his nasal passage 
Escaping through the piercing screams of his bleeding ears 
Chunks of fatty guts swap each and every step I take 
This horrid soul withered rotten flesh 
Inhuman species crawl upon the bleeding floor 
Feasting upon lucifers things 
Hybreeding sex emerge swollen worms implanted into Venien's skin 
Uncovers intentions to unfold its inhuman nature 
It dies in a rotting death 
As it's strung upon its mortal nature in its sanctum its sanctum is far 
It is far beyond acceptance of any mortal human being 
All that I envision is madness 
For the stray mind unholy lives 
Where its attached to nothing less 
Then the scalped hands of black death itself 
It is evidence 

Dissection inhuman
