Praise Satan fire burn
Eternal unfold the circles unbroken
Ignite end time
We seek a vengeance
Of an unholy prayer
In secret Black Mass
In trance in prisoned within
The soul erupts a darkness a calm
of death it greets us now
The core an evil unspokinvocation
The coming destroyer of faith
O Satan
Satan
