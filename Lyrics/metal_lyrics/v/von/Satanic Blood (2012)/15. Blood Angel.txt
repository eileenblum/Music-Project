Blood Angel

hell-priest wishes thou soul
spitting thy veins in bowls
collecting vile and viles
hell-priest aside Lucifer

diminishing slowly into blood as
Jesus spinning above
thou eyes bleeding
descending into Satan's throat

seeping thru thy body
delivering to hell
fill the chamber of hell
filling it with blood

for thy blood angel bleed forever
Jesus soaking in blood
moistening thy skin
god watch in vain

for is son sleep in blood
for is son sleep in hell
the drapes of heaven
burn in flames

producing an entrance
for Lucifer arrival
death cleans each cell of blood
for the coming of blood angel

blood angel
blood angel
