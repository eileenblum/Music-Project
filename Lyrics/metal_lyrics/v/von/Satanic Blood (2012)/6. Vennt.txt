The blades turn watch this cold retreat 
Against them black snake slide the blade in the lamb 
Fiends die down slave his blade its eyes 
With this disgrace survive I blood stain 

Take thy soul 
Take thy soul 
Take thy soul 
Take my life 

I bleed silver blade earth chains us through fire 
Cunt bride bleed blood fill this structure in 
Since I drift through skies brother lamb lives saves 
Lamb Iv'e sworn I'm done a bleak existence eye on my hand 

Take thy soul 
Take thy soul 
Take thy soul 
Take my life 
Take thy soul 
Take thy soul 
Take thy soul 
Take my life to 
Vennt 

Take thy soul to 
Vennt 
Take thy soul to 
Vennt
