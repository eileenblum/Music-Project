Although it may seem bloody
He shall die with only one drop of human blood
For you will feel his black death with him

Brothers of blood
The invisible images of vast horror is within thoughts
Shall hang mutilated, stale animals
With the veins of Jesus Christ

For it shall sway back and forth
Dripping most unkempt stink
Pig blood
Drop by drop falling
Creating a Satanic blood-face for me
I welcome the blood from these pigs of Hell
May it bleed upon my blood-face eternal

Lucifer killed his unborn child
So he may be a victim of circumstance
Undone evil
The wicked child lays in shallow, crowded graves
This unholy place is where the black sacrifices are performed
Here is where He kills...
