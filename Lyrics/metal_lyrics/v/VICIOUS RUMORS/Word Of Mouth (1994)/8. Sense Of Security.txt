[Lyrics: G.Thorpe, C.Albert // Music: G.Thorpe, M.McGee]

My patience wearing thin - I am a child of sin
Now there's no escape - stand up and (sic)devistate
I never do what I'm told
Live my life on the road
Choices I make
This knife will cut away the plague that's in my way
The course is never clear - no time for bloody tears
I never do what I'm told
Live my life on the road
Chance I take
Around and around - I'm living it time and again
I live yesterday and today and tomorrow
THE END!!
My old familiar friend - On me I can depend
Calm or catastrophe - it's all the same to me
I never do what I'm told
Live my life on the road
Chains that I break
A finger to those who object to the way that I live
And another for those who make promises that they can't keep
I live yesterday and today and tomorrow at once
Say what you will - I answer to no one
My patience wearing thin - I am a child of sin
Now there's no escape - stand up and (sic)devistate
I never do what I'm told
Live my life on the road
Choices I make
