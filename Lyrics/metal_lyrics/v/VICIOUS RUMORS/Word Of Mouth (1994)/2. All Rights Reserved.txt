[Lyrics: G.Thorpe, C.Albert, M.McGee// Music: M.Mcgee, G.Thorpe, L.Howe]

Why try - request denied
As usual - refuse you all you crave
Goin' through the motions
Circumstance, irrelevance
Everyday - another way - that we the people pay
As rights dissolve and freedom falls
Our choices stripped away
Anywhere you go and everyone you know
Is subject to decline - if you do survive
You'll get what you deserve
For all the time you served
All rights reserved / All rights reserved
All rights reserved / All rights reserved
No rights left - a possibility
Constitution - desillusion - it doesn't mean a thing
So let's drink the wine before it's time
And sing the song with you own rhyme
The rights are ours - yours and mine
Anywhere you go and everyone you know
Is subject to decline - if you do survive
You'll get what you deserve
For all the time you served
All rights reserved / All rights reserved
All rights reserved / All rights reserved
All rights reserved / All rights reserved
All rights reserved / All rights reserved
