[Lyrics: M.McGee// Music: M.McGee]

When the night time falls - images come to you
Then the voices call - trying to reach you
[chorus]
If you believe in me - set your heart free
Fantasy will be reality
Open up your eyes - to where your dreams lie
And when the full moon shines -
The future speaks to you
Soon the sun will rise and you will realize
The dream that came to be is reality
[chorus]
If you believe in me - set your heart free
Fantasy will be reality
Open up your eyes - to where your dreams lie
The journey travels on drifting frame by frame
The one you see is real - but you don't know her name
The mists begin to clear - as you feel her near
The look that's in her eyes has you hypnotized
Illusions are no more - now you've opened the door
The truth is now revealed - it's the love you feel
[chorus]
If you believe in me - set your heart free
Fantasy will be reality
Open up your eyes - to where your dreams lie
