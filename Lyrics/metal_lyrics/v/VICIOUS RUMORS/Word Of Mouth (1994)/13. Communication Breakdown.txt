[Limited Edition Bonus Track]

[Led Zeppelin cover]

Hey girl, stop what you're doin'
Hey girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you
But I like it a lot
Won't let me hold you
Let me feel your lovin' charms

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Hey girl, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah
I never gonna let you go
Cause I like your charms

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Communication breakdown, I want you to love me all night
Communication breakdown, I want you to love me, whoa, ah, a whoa, oh
Communication breakdown, I want you to love me, I want you to love

Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
