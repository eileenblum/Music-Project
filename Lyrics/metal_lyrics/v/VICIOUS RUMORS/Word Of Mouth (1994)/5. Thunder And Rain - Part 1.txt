[Lyrics: G.Thorpe, C.Albert // Music: G.Thorpe, M.Mcgee]

Pins and needles won't soften the ice
Freezer burn, a needless sacrifice
Lost a piece of myself last night
I'm older now with blackened eyes
Between thunder and rain
I hear your name
Between thunder and rain
I see your face
It's cold outside
My insides colder still
Mentally crucified, a broken will
Drowning in life, it's so deep
The time has come, to sleep
Between thunder and rain
I close my eyes
Between thunder and rain
I see your face
