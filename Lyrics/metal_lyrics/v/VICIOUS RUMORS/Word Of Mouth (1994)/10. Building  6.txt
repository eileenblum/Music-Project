[Lyrics: G.Thorpe, C.Albert // Music: M.McGee, G.Thorpe]

Lock the door - throw away the key
Shut them out of reality
Made the twisted more insane
Locked inside an evil cage
Made by man - sent from hell
Down below the wishing well
Blackened cross - laced in brick
Atrocities that made me sick
Left behind to die slow
How could man be so cold
Cry out in darkness - no one comes
Cold and dirty - lonely ones
Watching, waiting, yearning, praying
Walls of concrete seal their cries
While three-piece-suits-they tell their lies
"In good hands, they'll get the best"
"Just check right in, we'll take care of the rest"
Void of light - end of hope
In the black like a hangman's rope
Life hereafter waits in vain
While sunlight runs away in shame
Watching, waiting, learning, hating
Welcome to madness - take a look
Is this Hell or Willowbrook
White coats became filthy rich
Massacre in building #6
Screams of anguish from within
Sub-human dwellers - countless sins
Around the corned - out of sight
Administration dims the lights
In a place where greed prevailed
Nothing left - all systems failed
They turned their backs and ran away
Abomination - Hell to pay
Hating, raping, killing, escaping
Welcome to madness - take a look
Is this Hell -no- Willowbrook
White coats became filthy rich
Massacre in building #6
