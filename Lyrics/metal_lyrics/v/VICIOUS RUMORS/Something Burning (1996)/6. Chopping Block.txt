[Thorpe]

I will not go back in line 
I will not go back in time 
Will I see your point of view 
And will you take my blood as something new 
The chopping block is my headrest 
My neck is strong 
How do you like me now
When the game is over and there's no one left 
And there you are 
It's time to find out what you're really made of 
So I dig deep 
Just one more time, won't let it go 
It's time to find out what you're really made of 
Maybe it's not what you thought it was
Tell me, do you feel like a number 
And it's coming up on the chopping block
I embrace what lies ahead 
Until the day I die, or am I dead 
Pack your bags and go away 
And don't forget the nails in my hands 
I will not go back in line 
I will not go back in time
Drum roll please as I await 
The Judgement's handed down - No Fate! 
Standing in my brother's shoes 
'Cause there is no one that can take his place 
I will not go back in line 
I will not go back in time
