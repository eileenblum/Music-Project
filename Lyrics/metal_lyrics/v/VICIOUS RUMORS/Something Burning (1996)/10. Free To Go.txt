[Smyth, Thorpe]

A slap on the wrist and you're free to go 
Nevermind what what you did was so damn low 
Took what you want and the prize was yours 
You got somethin' for nothin'... no one to pay for it
Yeah you're free to go 
You had a job to do 
They'll loosen the cuffs for you 
Yeah you're free to go
The judge and juries are spinning wheels 
Moral obsessions hide the truth 
The man in the black says you got to beware 
To protect and serve above the law of the land
Yeah you're free to go 
You had a job to do 
We'll be seeing you 
Yeah you're free to go
Yeah you're free to go 
Well your job is through 
We'll be seeing you 
Yeah you're free to go
