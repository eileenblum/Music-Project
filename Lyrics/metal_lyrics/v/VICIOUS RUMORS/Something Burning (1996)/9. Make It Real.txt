[Thorpe]

Fragments of a broken day 
Cloud up my mind 
I hate for hatred's sake 
And I don't know why 
I found a love in you 
That blows me away 
In this distortion maze 
Everything will change 
So tell me that you're there 
I can make it real
If you could see the things that I see 
Then you'd understand 
If you could feel the way I feel 
We'd go all the way 
'Cause I could make it real
I see right through you 
And everything you do 
I'll make it real for you 
If you show yourself 
So tell that you're there 
I can make it real
When I look at you for a moment 
My tongue runs dry 
My eyes seal shut 
Oh God!
