[Thorpe]

Oh yeah, I got the ball and I'm runnin' 
With it all the way 
I don't need no one to show me around 
I got the feelin' and I'm believin' a 
Higher state of consciousness 
I don't need no one to bring me down
So I'm runnin' with it 
Till the end of it 
Yeah I'm goin' wlth it
'Cause you know that a ballhog 
Just doesn't drop the ball
Oh yeah. I'm feelin' no shame 
Is everyone insane... well please feel free 
To go for the one 
When I got the ball don't be in my way 
or l'm gonna run right through you 
It won't mean a thing to me
Crazy. Overblown 
I never thought that I could own 
Something no one could take away
