[Thorpe, Howe, Albert]

There's a fire burnin' 
And I feed it with my life 
There's a new beginning 
And I know that this is right
I stoke the fire... feed the flame 
It's comin' again
All and all the world keeps turnin' 
Don't you know we got somethin' burnin' 
On and on the ball keeps rollin' 
Pick it up where we left off... smokin' 
All and all the world keeps turnin' 
Don't you know we got somethin' burnin'... 
Somethin' burnin'
You are bound to feel it 
And you won't get left behind 
Something burning so deep 
Through your body and mind
If I ever come this way again 
I'll burn a trail to Hell and back
