[Thorpe, Albert, Howe]

I hear what you're sayin' 
And you're sayin' nothin' 
You're talking in circles 
A picture's worth a thousand words 
I picture you silent 
Not another word
Oh no! here it comes again 
The sound of your voice 
Must be your only friend
Why can't you understand 
You're makin' me a wreck 
Why can't you understand 
You're boring me to death
Perpetual... 
If I had a dime 
For every reason, rhyme or lie 
I would surely be 
The richest man alive 
They say that talk is cheap 
Well they don't know ya 
They really can't afford ya... 
You break the bank
