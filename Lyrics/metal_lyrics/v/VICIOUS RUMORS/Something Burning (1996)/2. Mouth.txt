[Thorpe, Albert]

You got the power with that tongue 
To break a man down bring him up again 
All that you got is not enough 
To satisfy the hunger of that Mouth 
You want me to be more like you 
I am what I am and that's ok 
I'm coming for you and...
That mouth 
Oh that mouth 
Up your mouth 
Shut your mouth
Horror and pain... shock me again 
Don't misunderstand me everyone wants the girl 
Just when I thought I'd seen it all 
Sisters... gushers... bring it on... mouth
Make me crazy over you 
I can't get away or look away 
I'm comlng to you and... 
From behind I work my way up 
One taste of your lips and I gotta have 
that mouth
Horror... you're driving me insane 
And pain... you give it over again 
Shock me... you shock me one more time 
Again... again with that mouth
