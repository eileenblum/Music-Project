[Sisco, Thorpe]

I see you out there walkin' 
Your crooked smile 
You think that you possess such 
Grace and style... well I say no 
The wind is getting colder 
And you're getting older 
You sit and watch your life go by 
And you can blame yourself
You call me over 
You call me brother 
But I despise you 
Like there's no other
Put you out 
Of my misery 
Put you out 
Get away from me
Take a walk around 
And see the world you live in 
Then reflect if you deserve 
The skin that you wear
So it's almost over 
You will be forgotten 
Or could I be you in the end 
And I'll never walk away
