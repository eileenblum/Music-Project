[Thorpe, Howe]

I can't breathe, I'm open wide 
Start to lose my mind 
Love is falling 
Walls come crashing 
Can't keep track of time 
Now I'm pushed to the edge 
I'll take on the edge
Concentration, set me free 
So I can see again 
Concentration, let me be 
So I can breathe again
Yeah, I can see you beneath my soul 
Yeah, I know you're still there 
I can see you beneath my soul 
Was I really there
Mastermind with an iron spine 
Plant the seed again 
Will we suffer - I think so 
It's up to you my friends
Concentration, set me free 
So I can see again 
Concentration, let me be 
So I can breathe again
