Bastards

Iâm not a compromise
Iâm just fine on my own
Donât need you company
I feel good alone

I donât need a church to tell me what to do
You donât need to try to twist my point of view

Bastards with a masterplan
Not meant for you to understand
Hey, itâs no secret what I want to do
Thereâs just no way in hell
Iâm gonna tell you

Bastards

I donât need attitude
Iâll obliterate this place
Donât need your hesitation
I can see it in your face

I donât need a star to tell me what to do
You donât need to try to twist my point of view
