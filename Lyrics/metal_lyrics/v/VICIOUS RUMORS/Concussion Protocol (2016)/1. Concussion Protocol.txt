The concentrated pain is real
And cannot be denied
It hurts so bad, the fragments shatter
About to lose your mind

The futureâs past will all collide
Your memory plays while your body starts to die
Your mind rejects, thereâs no control
A mass infection for all, you are dismissed

Concussion Protocol established
Relax, release, accept the lavish succumb
Concussion Protocol assumes
Your godâs creatures will surely be consumed

The futureâs past will all collide
Your memory plays while your body starts to die
Your mind rejects, thereâs no control
The protocol to never say goodbye

Cries for redemption fall on deaf ears
Father forgive me for all your sins
Alone at last now the time has come
The shadow is free from the broken sun
When the final protection is stripped away
And all that you know has made you afraid
When the blood moon rise for the very last time
The protocol to never say goodbye

Concussion Protocol enforced
Relax, release, accept the lavish succumb
Concussion Protocol control
Your godâs creatures will surely pay the toll
