Voices of the wicked laminate their faith
A spearhead revival underneath their caves
In the core we find, unearthed a city lost
Corpse of a dying world still remains

Fire, light, a thousand souls have been let out
Fire, accept, a thousand years of battle deaths

Black church screams from the top of the altar
We looked in between its reflections in water
House of war gods, tribute to man
A thousand years of blood soaked lands

Fire, light, a thousand souls have been let out
Fire, accept, a thousand years of battle deaths

The sinister sun couldnât warm up the altar
The monument froze over
A stage to celebrate in all her awe
A concert played for a thousand more

Light it up, light it up
A concert played for a thousand more
Light it up, light it up

Echoes of the lessons on the walls she insists
Fall as her prey deep inside her crypt
Flocks always come, just trying to look in
The art she withheld seeing on the horizon
