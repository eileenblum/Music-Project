Pushing â we go no further
Desperately out of time
An offer is made with one side in mind
Wonât you sign on the dotted line
Pushing for more with a blade at your throat
They shout in your ear

Take it or leave it or take it
Or leave it alone
Take it or leave it or take it
Make it your own
Take it or leave it or take it
Get out of my way
Take it or leave it or take it
But do it today

Tempted beyond desire
Asked to sell your self short
No one can walk on water
No one even comes close
Itâs over weâre thru
This is the only deal for you

A blade so sharp
To cut out your tongue
Twisting my words
When I talk to you
The deal is made
The bitch is in heat
Listen to me
Cause Iâm talking to you
