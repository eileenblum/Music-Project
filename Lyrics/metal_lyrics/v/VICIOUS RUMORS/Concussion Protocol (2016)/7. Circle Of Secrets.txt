He threads the needle thru a slovenly hand
Lacing its life together again
Words it relied on tangled his body
The message consigned

Brain dead players in the dome
Played by a mortal god
Underneath the dome, the circle of secrets expands
All thatâs proven here is the truthâs been stripped away

He threads the needle binding the words of hope
Now the next intertwines, the word passes on
It replaced the stolen truth
Once two minds just two bodies expanding their range
As control narrows down, and the line adds up

Brain dead players in the dome
Played by a mortal god
Underneath the dome
The circle of secrets is coming again
A circle of secrets expands
Just enough to bleed

As the last laces its life to the first, completing the circle
The laughter of a man pulling strings
Drowns in assenting murmur
Accepting the lie to overcome fear
Without lifting a finger, he now lifts them all
The circle of secrets completed
