Life for a life
You want mine
But I took yours
Eye for an eye
Forgiveness lost, the hurt remains
Enough left for all

Life for a life
Why should it be left to chance
Eye for an eye
Why should you be relevant
Relevant at all

Revenge has no time for lies
Forgiveness lost, nowhere to hide
Thereâs no justice in justification
Whereâs the pleasure in this state

Day for a day
Time is only running out
Night for a night
Survive exist to be shut down

What if only time exists
And all you are has fallen
What if only sand is left
And all you are has fallen
What if there is nothing left
All there isâ¦ is emptiness
