If youâre gonna do it, do it right
If youâre gonna do it, make it tight
If youâre gonna go, go all the way
If youâre gonna go you better start today

Cause weâre the last of our kind
Weâve seen it all and left the rest behind
Weâre the last of our kind
And when weâre gone let a new day shine

Itâs lonely, itâs rebellious
Where thereâs anger we have a home
Contagious, itâs evasive
Where thereâs excess weâre not alone

You donât know who I am
I donât need your approval
You donât know the blackest of times
I donât need your approval
I donât need your approval

You donât know who I am
I donât need your approval
We are who we are so never mind
I donât need your approval
