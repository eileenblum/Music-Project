Laying face down in a pool of excuses, struck down
Now that we have you you wonât even know it, knocked out

One more makes it worthwhile
Ten more youâre right in style
Fifteen theyâll be your best friend
Twenty the walking dead

Chemical slave, Chemical slave
The island gets smaller with every pulse
Chemical slave, in a mind insane
The waterâs on fire
Chemical slave, Chemical slave
Walk with me to the abyss
Chemical slave in a toxic grave
The waterâs on fire the worldâs inside out

Now in the depths deep down below
Blood is a venom
Your killer instinct has been subdued
Wrestle the redrum

Six months your skin melts away
Twelve months your face rearranged
Five years you wonât know your name
Ten years end of the game
