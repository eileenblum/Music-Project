You dwell inside a plastic god
Intertwined the passwordâs locked
Fortified you feel strong
As long as you have a charge
Youâre still logged on

Mindful only on the screen
Never more to be seen
No reason left to say a word

Victims of a digital world
Lost without connection
Victims of a cynical world
Itâs a human resurrection

Victims of a digital world
Lost without connection
Victims of a cynical world
Itâs a human resurrection

Enter, control
Weâve hacked into desire
Delete, replace
Whatâs left of human thought

Dissolve the soul with the holy pad
Download the dreams that you used to have
