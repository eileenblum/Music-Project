Welcome here
Won't you come inside
A stained glass temple
The house of lies

If the new mask fits
And becomes your face
You'll pay with your flesh
While jesus saved

Chasing the priest
Chasing the priest
Took over the lake
We took off the leash
Don't knock on my door
We're chasing the priest
Chasing the priest
Chasing the priest
Don't knock on my door
With your book of the weak
Chasing the priest
We're chasing the priest

Organs grinding
A little boy hurt
We looked for the priest
By the edge of the woods
The angels are singing

Holy water and empty words
Locked up tight and so secure
Pay your way to the other side
Just to see you got left behind

We surrounded the church
We came in and had a good laugh
Their ground will never be my earth
Their lies were not my truth

Chasing the priest
Chasing the priest
Took over the lake
We took off the leash
Don't knock on my door
We're chasing the priest
Chasing the priest
Chasing the priest
Don't knock on my door
With your book of the weak
Chasing the priest
We're chasing the priest

Feel at ease with the cash we take
A life was saved with the fee you paid
We stood tall and surround the lake
Gather around and deplete their strength

Chasing the priest
Chasing the priest
Took over the lake
We took off the leash
Don't knock on my door
We're chasing the priest
