Left with a threat the looms overhead
Alternatives to an early death
Make a choice on your own behalf
To rely on a blessing is so fucking sad
I ask for no blessing the thought makes me sick
Iâll take it all on. Iâll dig my own pit

Every blessingâs a curse
The one from you was the worst
Everything from your mouth
Startâs in hell and heads south

Every blessingâs a curse
Every blessingâs a curse
So Iâll make my way first
Every cure has a cost
If you survive from the loss

Donât fear whatâs above
And the fantasy they speak of
Donât fear whatâs above
And the fantasy the dream of
