[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn, Geoff Thorpe]

I'm looking through your eyes 
You're staring back at me 
And we've got so much time 
To drift away...
Here we go, on a journey sailing through the stars 
I've built a castle in my heart 
It's all for you...
This is my dream 
So won't you swim with me? 
In this Cerebral Sea 
Where we'll be free...
I've found the key to my mind's eye 
And I'm unlocking all the doors 
Time and space, There's a distant place 
We can call our own...
On and on we brave the storm 
And hide inside the shadows of our haunted hearts 
On and on we sing the song 
And sail into the eye of our eternal love...
This is my home, this is my dream 
So won't you swim with me? 
In this Cerebral Sea 
We'll be free...
On and on we brave the storm 
And hide inside the shadows of our haunted hearts 
On and on we sing the song 
And sail into the eye of our eternal love...
But this is my home, this is my dream 
So won't you swim with me? 
In this Cerebral Sea...
