[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn, Geoff Thorpe]

I am the prodigal son, the ghost of the chosen one 
I am the god that you want, the god that you need...
Calling out to the young and the old 
The torched, the twisted, metallic and cold 
Forge and fire, unwilling to bleed 
The few, the proud, new metal machines...
Carry the torch over sea, over land 
Cutting my way through the "new master plan" 
Saving the soul of a world that's on crutches 
But I can't save you all, unless you take a stand 
And answer the call...
I am the prodigal son, the ghost of the chosen one 
I am the god that you want, the one that you need...
Neodymium Man, catch me if you can 
Neodymium Man, I'm the master plan 
Neodymium Man, catch me if you can 
Neodymium Man...
Open your arms to the new metal man 
I'm welding your future as fast as I can 
So let it be written, so let it be done 
And listen to the law, my fellow man 
And answer the call...
I am the prodigal son 
So look out here I come 
Adaptation or extinction...
Neodymium Man, catch me if you can 
Neodymium Man, I'm the master plan 
Neodymium Man, catch me if you can 
Neodymium Man...
