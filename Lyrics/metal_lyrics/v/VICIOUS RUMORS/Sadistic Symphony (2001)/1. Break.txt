[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn]

Blackened heart that's beating bloodless 
Victim of this crazy world 
Strapped in my insane asylum 
Breeding anger, fighting my battles alone...
I'm a prison 
I've been strangled by this noose around my neck 
I've been tortured 
Spitting out my heart beside my bed 
In the darkness 
Praying for these chains to break away 
I can feel it, freedom's on its way...
Serpents in the devil's pulpit 
Cracked lips on their acid smiles 
Conjuring their slaves in silence 
Manufactured automatons 
I can break away, I can set it right 
Growing stronger, bound by these shackles too long...
I'm a prison 
I've been strangled by this noose around my neck 
I've been tortured 
Spitting out my heart beside my bed 
In the darkness 
Praying for these chains to break away 
I can feel it, freedom's on its way...
Falling angel, stripped of my power to fly 
Holy savior, lift me back into the sky...
Falling angel, stripped of my power to fly 
Holy savior, bring me back into your light 
I'll never die...
I'm a prison 
I've been strangled by this noose around my neck 
I've been tortured 
Spitting out my heart beside my bed 
In the darkness 
Praying for these chains to break away 
I can feel it, freedom's on its way
Break away, break away 
You know I've gotta break away...
