[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn, Geoff Thorpe]

Fire in the hole, the wretched smell of death 
Maniac on the frontline, and napalm on your breath 
Let the bell toll...
Tortured by the visions, the haunting of your dreams 
It seems like yesterday, can't you hear the screams?
Heartless soldier, the crimson martyr 
Can't atone your own disgrace 
Find your own death before dishonor 
Sacrifice, your saving grace...
But you've got no rules, no rules to keep you sane 
You're a prisoner of pain...
But you've got no rules, no rules to keep you sane 
No way to win 
Still a prisoner of pain...
Heartless soldier, the crimson martyr 
Can't atone your own disgrace 
Find your own death before dishonor 
Sacrifice, your saving grace...
