[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn, Geoff Thorpe]

I've been beaten down, turned inside out 
Pounded through the wall 
Had my share of scars, cherish them all 
Speeding down my own road, headlights to the sky 
No remorse and no regrets 
That's the way I'll die...
I'm the last of my kind 
I've been born again hard 
I've seen sanctity slaughtered 
And watched my comrades fall...
The price for a piece of mind gets higher every day 
I'll pay that toll, charge what you will 
And through it all, you know you get what you deserve 
In the end, boy, remember what you've learned...
Now you're born again, born again, Born Again Hard! 
Rise from your ruin 
Now you're born again, born again, Born Again Hard!
I'm the last of my kind, the last in line 
I've been born again hard, born again hard 
I've seen sanctity slaughtered 
And I've watched my comrades fall 
You know I've seen them fall...
We're the last of our kind 
We've been born again hard, born again hard 
We've seen sanctity slaughtered 
And watched our comrades fall...
