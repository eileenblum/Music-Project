[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn, Geoff Thorpe]

Freakshow circus, hit parade, nightmares walking 
The kids on the Haight, they're begging for change 
Without even talking... Not me!
Gonna live my life on 10 
Gonna go where no one's been 
Take my friends with me 
I'm gonna burn this temple down 
Gonna dig and break new ground 
That's what I believe...
Cranked out carnies flip the switch 
On your little darlings 
They're trapped on this ride, melting inside 
But nobody's crying... Not me!
Gonna live my life on 10 
Gonna go where no one's been 
Take my friends with me 
I'm gonna burn this temple down 
Gonna dig and break new ground 
I won't be deceived...
Life... 
Simple and cruel, scholars and fools, you and me 
Trust... 
It comes and it goes, nobody knows, and nobody cares 
So blame it on me, this hypocrisy of humanity 
Sadistic Symphony...
Gonna live my life on 10 
Gonna go where no one's been 
Take my friends with me 
I'm gonna burn this temple down 
Gonna dig and break new ground 
I've got to believe...
Life... 
Simple and cruel, scholars and fools, you and me 
Trust... 
It comes and it goes, nobody knows, and nobody cares 
So blame it on me, this hypocrisy of humanity 
Sadistic Symphony...
