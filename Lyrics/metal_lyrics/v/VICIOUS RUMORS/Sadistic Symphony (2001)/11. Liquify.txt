[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn, Geoff Thorpe]

I am your hero 
I am everything you'll never be 
Toxic and worshiped 
I'll eat all your ammunition...
A fortress of fear and pain is coming straight ahead 
Bring on your war, don't give a damn 
Your negativity could raise the fucking dead 
Misuse of power is all you understand...
You will drown in me 
Liquefy...
Meltdown, disintegrate 
Your body walks without a soul 
Conquest, contaminate 
Your bullshit drags you down the road...
A fortress of fear and pain is coming straight ahead 
Bring on your war, don't give a damn 
Your negativity could raise the fucking dead 
Misuse of power is all you understand...
You will drown in me 
Liquefy...
You think you can stop me, but you won't 
Because I've got the willpower and you don't 
Becoming the water, flow...
You will drown in me 
Liquefy...
Oceans of anger 
I won't choke on your insanity 
When I, when I Liquefy 
Nothing means a damn to me...
A fortress of fear and pain is coming straight ahead 
Bring on your war, don't give a damn 
Your negativity could raise the fucking dead 
Misuse of power is all you understand...
