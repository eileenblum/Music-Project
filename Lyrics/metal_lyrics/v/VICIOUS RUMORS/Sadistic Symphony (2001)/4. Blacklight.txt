[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn, Geoff Thorpe]

I once knew a girl, when I was still a mortal man 
I dream of being human, to live my life again 
I can dream...
I am a prisoner entangled in your web, let me go 
The song of the siren diva, devouring your dead 
So cold, so very cold...
She's got magnetic eyes and an iron gaze 
They tore my soul apart, all apart 
Feeding on my energy, she dehumanized my heart 
But I can dream...
I am a prisoner entangled in your web, let me go 
The song of the siren diva, devouring your dead 
So cold, so very cold...
As I embrace the other side, the eternal dark 
There's something wicked in your eyes 
I couldn't recognize 
You put your venom in my veins 
I can't take this pain 
Now I'm immortally your man, mistress of the damned 
Black light love affair, black light love affair...
