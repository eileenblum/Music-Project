[Lyrics: Morgan Thorn, Geoff Thorpe]

"I forgive you father for your sins..."
Witness this circus clown act of devotion 
So tired of watching and processing all of these fools 
I've had enough of their lies for a lifetime 
So many in fact, I'm immune...
These monsters in masquerade 
It's all just as well, Elevator to Hell...
Cutting away all that's pure, leaving cancer 
Sutures erupting with greed, we're barely alive 
Somewhere in all this decay lies the answer 
Somewhere inside you, inside of yourself...
"God says I need a new Cadillac..."
These monsters in masquerade 
It's all just as well, Elevator to Hell 
There's no final serenades 
It's all just as well, Elevator to Hell...
