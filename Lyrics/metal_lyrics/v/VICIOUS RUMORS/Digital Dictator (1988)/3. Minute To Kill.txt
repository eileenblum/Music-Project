[Thorpe/Albert/Howe]

Oh oh oh yeah 
Why don't you go out your back door 
It's your only chance to have 
Run your life alone 
As fast as you can 
The road to the top 
Is never what exsists 
A finger from the trigger 
Of the age of suspense
* Time runs out 
Take to the sky 
Don't look back 
Run for your life 
To the edge 
Now is your chance don't sit still 
Minute to kill 
Time's on your side If you try
Out of our windows 
We'll fight to the end 
Let 'em grin 
Corporate masturbation explodes in a jet 
Who tossed the line 
Is that the final thread 
Watch it rule the world 
No matter who's ahead
[* Repeat]
With all of them true 
In our lights 
Time's on your side if you will 
Minute to kill 
Time's on your side if you strife 
Out of my way, now
Up to me to victory 
You'll I never get compressed 
Together we'll exterminate 
The challenge of your best 
I once watches you fight 
You get no second chance 
So put up or shut up or die
[* Repeat]
All of them true 
In our lights 
Time's on your side if you will 
Minute to kill 
Time's on your side if you strife 
You took it to town 
Took it to doubt 
We're sorry your minute to kill
