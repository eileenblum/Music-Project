[Thorpe/Albert/Howe/McGee]

On a mountain road of stone 
Preachers cry out all alone 
Body in their blood runs thin 
All the time he's cashing in
Long hours under the sun 
Nothing left for anyone but him, oh no
Full power 
Never enough 
Sneak off 
We're calling your bluff
Condemned forever 
The quest to stay alive 
Condemned forever 
The one you have survived
Oh, the whole world laughs inside 
All the country left to die 
Men of the living dead 
Don't believe a word he said
Long hours under the sun 
Nothing left for anyone but him, oh no
Full power 
Never enough 
Stand up 
And call your bluff
Condemned forever 
The quest to stay alive 
Condemned forever 
The one who has survived 
Condemned forever 
Wandering through the nights 
Condemned forever 
Freedom is in sight 
Yeah!
Even in all his feeling high 
He makes his way 
Wanted knight 
He only wants to wind up free 
Oh, to hell those miseries, yeah yeah!
Condemned forever 
The quest to stay alive 
Condemned forever 
The one who has survived 
Condemned forever 
What do you do nights 
Condemned forever 
Freedom is in sight
