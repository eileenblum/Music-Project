[Starr/Thorpe/McGee]

Now we're in the barrows 
Of rulers who have lived 
Enjoyed they once had it 
Made his amend
Now here tonight 
You crossed to the edge 
We'll never let you down 
We'd rather drop dead
Rock like hell 
Rock like hell 
Rock like hell
Forces of the wicked 
Travels to the end 
Right up here on stage 
Oh people on our heads 
Just because my leather is black skintight 
When we hit the stage we rock all night
Rock like hell 
Rock like hell 
Rock like hell 
Rock like hell
Fire and water begins to boil 
Who awaits the potion 
Of driving me closer to you 
Closer to you
So when you're taking off 
Back to reality 
Tell me my friend 
What is it that you see
The spice of this encounter 
Cause the boys in the band 
Apparently the truth 
Is what they just can't stand
Rock like hell 
Rock like hell 
Rock like hell 
Rock like hell
