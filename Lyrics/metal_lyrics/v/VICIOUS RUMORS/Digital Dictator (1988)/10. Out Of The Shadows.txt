[McGee/Albert/Thorpe]

Out of the faceless shadows 
Relentless changes in the night 
Will it be alright, Oh 
We're not alone 
The shadow draws me home 
The troubled times we undergo
Out of the shadows into the night 
The seal has broken bearing your souls 
No, no time to lose 
The winds of change's upon us now 
Sweat on your brow 
No, no, you're not alone 
We're riding wind or tides 
Though time has come when choosing sides 
The test of time 
Sail on sail on
Out of the shadows into the night 
The pages turn the story unfolds 
Out of the shadows into the night 
The meaning of sorrier times
Out of the shadows into the night 
The pages turn the story unfolds 
Out of the shadows into the night 
The pages burn the story is told 
Oh
