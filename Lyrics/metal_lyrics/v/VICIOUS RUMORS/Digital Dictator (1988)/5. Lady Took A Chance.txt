[Thorpe]

Alright 
Oh, don't play with fire again 
The pain becomes your only friend 
You must see now a circle growing 
Back to the point of soul determined 
You take your chance when you play the game 
Roll the dice 'cause you're allowed to win 
Pick your number in back of the line 
Check in the shorts for a holiday plan 
Is to wear the shortest axe 
You can do it again, yeah
* Well the lady took a chance 
But there is no guarantees in romance 
Although you may respect her 
Your love will not protect her
The boys beat color others black and blue 
Changes that you put me through 
Know the hate all end up the same 
The time has come to make me pray 
You take your chance when you play the game 
Roll the dice 'cause you're allowed to win 
Pick your number in back of the line 
Shark skin jacket with a tortoise in his pocket 
She was never going anywhere 
You ain't never coming back with her
[* Repeat]
The lady took a chance 
And she lost lost lost lost lost
The lady took a chance 
She really took a chance 
The lady took a chance 
She really took a chance 
She lost
The lady took a chance 
She really lost the fight 
She stretched a little harder 
Just to fleece her appetite 
Yeah
The lady took a chance 
She really took a chance 
It all slipped away 
In a voodoo dance 
Tonight oh yeah
Ice cold day with sordid twitch 
You can eat it on the run 
Or you rub it on a stick tonight
[* Repeat]
