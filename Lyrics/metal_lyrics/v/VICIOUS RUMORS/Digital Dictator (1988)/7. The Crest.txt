[Thorpe]

Rising high in the burning sky 
A kiss of death surrounds you 
Black is the night 
You're fade out of sight 
That no one ever finds you
To live or die 
Never touch the crest 
All the poisoned minds 
Live inside the crest
The guilty and crime 
Assault has survived 
But life is rotting low here 
You'll see what I mean 
If you follow the stream 
The blessed is in control
To live or die 
Never touch the crest 
All the poisoned minds 
Live inside the crest
The trip's our lives 
But time's on your side 
Beware and watch for the shadows 
The lesson we learn 
Don't make the wrong turn 
We will go together
To live or die 
Never touch the crest 
All the poisoned minds 
Live inside the crest
We will go together 
We will go together 
We will go together 
We will go together
