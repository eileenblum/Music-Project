[Thorpe/Howe]

On the verge of a heatwave 
Come on over to my house 
We're gonna go out and play 
We're gonna tear it all down 
When we hit the strip tonight 
Can you feel the power and the flashing lights 
There's a voice that calls out to me 
I can't hold back 
Can't hold back anymore
* Towns on fire 
Burning on the street with a heat of desire 
Towns on fire 
Spending time with the ladies of the metal 
Towns on fire 
This town's on fire 
Towns on fire 
Come on come on
Well my body's electric 
Come out from the air 
Can you taste of my frenzy 
Can you tell where I'm game 
Now I'm heading down that track 
Midnight town and I won't turn back 
There's a voice that calls out to me 
I can't hold back 
Can't hold back anymore 
Anymore
[* Repeat]
The boys come out 
We are playing asunder
Well, what's time is running 
And I've got all day 
With the stakes so high 
I'm the best at the game 
Now I'm heading down that track 
Midnight town and I won't turn back 
There's a voice that calls out to me 
I can't hold back 
Can't hold back anymore 
Anymore
[* Repeat]
The boys come out 
Town 
This town's on fire
