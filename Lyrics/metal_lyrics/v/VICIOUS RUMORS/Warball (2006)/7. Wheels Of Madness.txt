[G. Thorpe / J. Rivera / L. Howe]

Flashed, phenomena, mysteries in sight
Unanswered, but still remains
From the outer world a presence was made
But secrecy sustains
The closer we get to the answers
The further away we go

[Chorus:]
Wheels of madness turning
Will we ever learn
Wheels of madness turning
The candle burns

Abduction foretold, stories of madness
A history self portrayed
From the underground, a secret secured
Forever hidden away
The closer we get to the answers
The sooner we'll know it's a lie

[Chorus]

The blackouts, confusion a state of illusion
It all took place last night
No-one believes you, you must have been dreaming
Or, maybe you're out of your mind
The closer we get to the answers
The sooner we'll know it's a lie

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Aeon years flash before your eyes
The future past, present systematized

[Chorus]
