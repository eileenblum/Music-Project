[G. Thorpe / J. Rivera / L. Howe]

Don't look in the eyes without a face
Don't try to see through time and space
She'll give out her hand for you to take
Only to deceive she will forsake

[Pre chorus:]
She'll promise you the way to the land of opportunity
She'll promise you the key to the door that will set you free

[Chorus:]
Beware Mr. Miracle
Beware Mr. magical

Mistress of sin knocks on your door
With all her wicked charms lost fools adore
Don't you ever let her bring you down
Bound forever to be her own slave

[Chorus]

Mistress of sin knocks on your door
With all her wicked charms lost fools adore
Don't you ever let her bring you down
Bound forever to be her own slave

[Pre chorus:]
She'll promise you a world of wealth prosperity
Can't you see it only leads to your insanity

[Chorus]
