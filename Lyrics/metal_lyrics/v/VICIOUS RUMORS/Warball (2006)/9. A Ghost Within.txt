[G. Thorpe / J. Rivera / L. Howe]

Behold the warriors by my side they're sacred steel
Take on the pressure mounting power that they yield
The signal getting stronger growing every day
We take no prisoners the battle decides our fate

[Pre chorus:]
Can you feel the rage within our eyes
Can you feel the pain of your demise

[Chorus:]
A ghost within awaits his revenge
Saints and sinners run in fear
A ghost within waits on no man
Time is up and he's here to collect

Unbearable the cruelty of man at heart
Genetic break down his source of modern art
We take our power from the cries of the weak
So join with us and live these words we speak

[Pre chorus]
[Chorus]

A ghost within
A ghost within is here to collect
