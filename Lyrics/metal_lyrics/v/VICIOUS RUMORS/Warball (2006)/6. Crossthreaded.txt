[G. Thorpe]

I ask for hot and you give me cold
You want it young and I give you old
You say one thing and I say another
Man against man, sister and brother

[Chorus:]
Crossthreaded history
The same words heard so differently
Crossthreaded misery

The words that are spoken seldom are heard
They twist and they turn they're misunderstood
Communication emergency
I'm screaming out but you can't hear me

[Chorus]

You won't know until it's to late
Time will tell the story creates
A life of its own

Invincible, your silhouette
Confusion is a special gift
Hanging motionless it seems
Attracted to you murderous teeth

[Chorus]
