[G. Thorpe / J. Rivera / L. Howe]

Rolling thunder and acid rain
In my head, inside of my brain
Riding on overload, I'm insane
I'm at the top, at the top of my game

[Pre chorus:]
I'm the immortal fire and rage
I'm the immortal power and rain
You wont hear me till it's much too late
Watch me seal your fate

[Chorus:]
With me you never die
Let me reignite your life

Soaring the night, searching for souls
I'll take my blood from the young and the old
Stakes are high, sun turns night
Take my embrace and give up the fight

[Pre chorus]
[Chorus]

Come back to life

[Pre chorus]
[Chorus]
