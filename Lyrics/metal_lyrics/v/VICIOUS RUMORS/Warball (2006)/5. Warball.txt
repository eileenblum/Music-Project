[G. Thorpe / J. Rivera]

Synchronized the madness starts
Override we're close to launch
Never mind the civil truce
All hands down and warball's loose

[Chorus:]
Warball's on and we 're born again hard
The cycle never ends
A sea of death
Warball's on and we're born again hard
Time to say goodbye
Goodbye my friends

Situation def com 5
No-one gets out of here alive
The betrayal set in stone
A plague unleashed has found its home

[Bridge:]
Darkness and sadness Fills the air

Right back where we started Warball's armed and locked on
Contracts in blood Warball marches on

[Chorus]
