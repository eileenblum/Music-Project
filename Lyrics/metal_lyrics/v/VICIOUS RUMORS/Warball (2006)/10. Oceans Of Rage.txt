[G. Thorpe / J. Rivera / L. Howe]

I'm sealing your fate
You will feel my hate
Death and despair are coming for you
I can't stop, I can't sit still
I'm twisted up on twisted thrills
I'll back it up, I'll make it real
Beneath the core the pain I feel

[Chorus:]
Oceans of rage
Mountains of hate
Pressure builds, I can't concentrate
Sealing your fate
You will feel my hate death and despair are coming for you
I live my life with conviction
A path through the dark, a beacon of friction
I'll bottle your hate and sell it in pills
Four times a day as needed for kill

[Bridge:]
When you look into my eyes
You will feel my hate
As you fall to your knees
When you look into my eyes
Now you will feel my hate
As you fall to your knees
It's just a little too late
Die! Die! Die!
Why won't you die?!

[Chorus]
