[G. Thorpe / L. Howe]

Power and pressure all balled up together
Compounded by hatred surrounded by glass
Fragments will splinter and fragments will shatter
Rip torn and tattered away at your past

[Chorus:]
Louder the hellion Sonic Rebellion
Faster the toxic that bleeds in your mind
Sonic rebellion the beast of the best the last of your kind

Force feed a diet of gutless delusion
Whining and crying is just not for me
Out of the shadows the weak will come out if we show them
A sling shot of decibels reeling with strength

[Chorus]

Take on the pressure if hurts for minute
Drenched from a shower of volume insane
Now you're electric empowered perfection
Riding the force of a champions reign
