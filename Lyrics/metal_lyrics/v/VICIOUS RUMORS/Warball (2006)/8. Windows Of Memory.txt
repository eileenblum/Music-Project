[J. Rivera / G. Thorpe]

Windows of memories is all that he has
Voices like fallen rain
Echo in his head
Vision of my face
His thoughts last embrace
Dear father close your eyes
It's time for you to rest

[Pre-chorus:]
Fly away

[Chorus:]
We take for granted every day
Suddenly it slips away
There's nothing left that I can say

Looking back on your life
You'll be apart of me
From a boy to a man
You gave unselfishly
From the place where you lie
Fly away and be free
Oh father close your eyes
It's time for you to rest

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
