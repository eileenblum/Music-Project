[G. Thorpe / J. Rivera / L. Howe]

Empty cries fill the skies
All across the land
Lonely heart reaching out
Bleeding hands in their hands

[Chorus:]
Dying, dying, dying every day
Crying, crying as they fade away
Dying, dying, dying every day
Crying, crying, watch them fade away

Can you hear the children cry
Cause I can hear them scream
Ripped of all their hopes and dreams
As we watch them bleed

[Chorus]

After all is said and done
What lies ahead in tomorrow's world
Lessons in life they never learned
Will they have their turn?

[Chorus]
