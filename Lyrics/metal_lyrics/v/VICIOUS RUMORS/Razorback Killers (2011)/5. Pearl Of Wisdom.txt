Maybe all you want waits for you
Is all the way, for enough to go
Is all the way, too far for you to go.

Will it fall from the sky
A ray of light, a reason why
Will it come in some disguise.

Right here, in front of you
Pearl of wisdom finds its way
It's sorrow that lives in the dark
Don't chase the light away.

Take a look around, tell me what you see
Did it go the way you planned,
Were you all that you could be
Matters of the heart left a trail of memory.

Will it fall from the sky
A ray of light, a reason why
Will it come in some disguise.

Matters of the heart left a trail of memory.

Cause I fall from the sky
There is no light, it ran away
Now you see my disguise.
