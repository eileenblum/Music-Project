My eyes are open wide,
I can see through the fire
The Metal racing through my veins,
Consumes my desires
There's no escaping from yourself,
Let the beast run wild
My taste for blood, my primal lust,
I'm the devil's child.

My right of devastation, electric storms of rage,
Eternal domination, new violent life begins,
Blackout the sun, it's night all day
You're not alone, don't be afraid
A sacrifice will be made.

My eyes are open wide,
I can see through the fire
The Metal racing through my veins,
Consumes my desires
There's no escaping from yourself,
Let the beast run wild
My taste for blood, my primal lust,
I'm the devil's child.
