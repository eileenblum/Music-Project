Lost adrift for way too long,
Your mind plays tricks and you go along
Left for dead a storm arrives
In the darkest corners of your mind.

Deal up, high card wins
Deal with the devil, you never gonna win
Run so far, try to run away
Deal with the devil, in the end you gotta pay.

Pay the price at any costs
Become the one you thought you lost
Alive or dead, it's all the same
Bloodshot eyes are full or rage.

Our twisted ways have been erased
Humanity has been replaced
Our faded light has grown so dim
We just might live to see the end.

Acid eats Metal in the great revolt
Lake of fire starts to boil
A final curtain call for men
His ash replaces the beach's sand.
