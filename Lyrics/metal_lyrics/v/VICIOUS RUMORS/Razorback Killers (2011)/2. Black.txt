We saw the wings of hell
Rise and crack the sky
We lost the hopes and dreams
Of those who were denied
Locked in a sea of fog,
The sweat has turned to hate
How can we save us from ourselves.

Look around you, is this the final hour
Are you among the ones to be saved
Right behind you the darkness rushing forward
If you listen, you can still here them say
The sun will fade to black.

A sudden strike, an act of war, the daze begins
Lost in a pit of shattered lives
They tried to run away, but it's too late
The warball sure to fly.
