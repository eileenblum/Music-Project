They came from miles around
To share this hallowed ground
Same time next year we'll do it again
Headbangers everywhere
Will meet for three days there
You can hear them scream,
You can hear them shout.

Hey, Hey, Hey, Let me hear you,
All together now, Come on!
Let the garden burn, as the circle turns,
Let the garden burn.

We raise the torch, and the fire still burns
We'll go all night,
And we'll sleep when we're dead
The garden set a blaze,
A frantic Metal maze
You can hear them scream,
You can hear them shout.

Light the fire, let it burn all night,
One more time to get it right
Let it burn all night,
I just want to hear some guitar.

Let the garden burn, as the circle turns,
Let the garden burn.
