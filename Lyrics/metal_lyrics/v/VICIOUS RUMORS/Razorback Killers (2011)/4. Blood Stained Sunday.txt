Together through the night we ride
Neon eyes flashing lights
Another city passes by,
The hour glass is compromised
They pushed as far as they could go
Speeding down this open road
Wash away all past crime,
Life of passion sacrificed.

Living on borrowed time, right to the death
And if today's your last, make it shine.

A toast to the fallen ones,
I hope that you circle the sun
Away from bloodstained Sunday
Got a date with destiny, bloodstained Sunday
Never know who it's gonna be,
All for one, one for all,
If we're gonna fall, we'll take it all, bloostained Sunday.

Break the chains that hold you back
Run it hard, make it last
Make it count for every day,
No matter what the others say.

Thunder cracks the night in half
There's no way to take it back
Memories flash before your eyes
And suddenly you realize.

Living on borrowed time, right to the death
And if today's your last, make it shine.

Now this day we move ahead
Honouring your life and death
On the road we go again
With our faith we will defend
Now this day of sorrow past
Surrounded by the Metal mass
Work it out encased in steel
With Vicious Rumors at the wheel.
