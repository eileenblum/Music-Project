Oh here we go, a rush to my head
I feel ignited, exited again
Live for today, the time is right now
Turn up my life to a boil.

Over the edge, how far will you stray
Pushing past forward with power and strength

Bashing and smashing, engulfed in brutality
Feel my pain.

We'll fight you for our lives,
We'll fight you till the end
Our faith we will defend.

Over the edge, how far till you brake
Faster and faster to win the race
Hammerhead vulture, a constant tormentor
This hell train's on fire, a full speed aggressor
I'm a razorback killer, Razorback blade.

I am the gun at the scene of the crime
I am the light at the end of your life
I'm fast as hell, I can stop on a dime
Borderline psycho, riding the edge
Razorback cocktail that never ends
Drink myself sober by 3 p.m.
Just enough time to do it again.

We'll fight you for our lives,
We'll fight you till the end
Our faith we will defend.

Over the edge, how far till you brake
I'm a razorback killer, Razorback blade
Hammerhead vulture, a constant tormentor
This hell train's on fire, a full speed aggressor
I'm a razorback killer, Razorback blade.
