It's so cruel of you to leave me like this
Wanting more of you and everything I miss
It's so hard to be away for so long
You're all I want, should have never let you go.

All I want is you, it's everything that you do
Together we are free, from fear to eternity
There's no limits, there's no boundaries
There is no-one who can stop us now
You can't stop a shooting star.

Now I feel the loss with every passing day
Wondering why I chose to be so far away
And now the passion grows darker by the hour
Now you know just how, you know just how I feel.

All I want is you, it's everything that you do
Together we are free, from fear to eternity
I'm in trance, I'm hypnotized
Running red on overdrive
Turn me on and take a ride
You might like what ya find inside.

All I want is you, it's everything that you do
Together we are free, from fear to eternity
There's no limits, there's no boundaries
There is no-one who can stop us now
You can't stop a shooting star.

There's no limits, you're the one
There is no-one who can stop us now
You can't stop the rising sun.
