[Lyrics: G.Thorpe, C.Albert // Music: M.Mcgee, G.Thorpe]

Hate is a killer in breeding frenzy 
Growing faster becoming deadly. 
Wake up, together. C'mon fight the beast: 
Tyrant control in the Middle East
Poison, power. Driven by fury 
Digital dictator, blackened expropriator 
Deliver us from evil. Save the people 
Contagion of hatred must be eliminated
Savior, 
Save us from anger 
Put to the test 
Will we ever know?
The hunter, an animal without emotion. 
Mechanical destruction, methodical corruption 
Wake up, can't you see, the peace and harmony 
Is there if you want it
Savior, 
Save us from anger 
Put to the test 
Will we ever know?
