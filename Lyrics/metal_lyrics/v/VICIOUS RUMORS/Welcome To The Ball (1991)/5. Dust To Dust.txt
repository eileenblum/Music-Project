[Lyrics: M.McGee // Music: M.Mcgee, G.Thorpe]

The hands of time have brought you here, 
It's a long hard road to burn. 
The hidden fire of liife has come unturned. 
The river runs, you've just begun, 
To set a course to nevermore, 
Lay down your tracks upon the shore.
Moving on from dusk 'til dawn, 
Passing by the years 
It's dust to dust for you my friend from here
Living on the planet's web, 
It can take you down anywhere you tread. 
Emotions in motion paving the way, 
Trying to make it through another day. 
Your soul is caged, you can't deny, 
You never know when your time lies. 
You're here and gone, like all the rest. 
Walking the line between life and death
Moving on from dusk 'til dawn, 
Passing by the years 
It's dust to dust for you my friend is near
Moving on from dusk 'til dawn, 
Passing by the years 
It's dust to dust for you my friend is here! 
It's dust to dust for you my friend is here!
