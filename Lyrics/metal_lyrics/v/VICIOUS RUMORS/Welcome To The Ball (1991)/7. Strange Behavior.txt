[Lyrics: G.Thorpe // Music: G.Thorpe, M.McGee]

Yesterday was so long ago. 
The sun's coming up again. 
And the bottle that we drank so slow 
Part of no master plan.
Hey, it's that time again, 
To pay with your flesh, 
And you looking down on me, 
Now time for you to see.
(Strange) Strange behavior 
Coming over me again. 
(Strange) Strange behavior 
That's just me and my friends.
What I do and what I say 
Well baby, that's my choice. 
And I choose to be free. 
Can you hear my voice?
Hey, it's that time again, 
To pay with your flesh, 
And you looking down on me, 
Now time for you to see.
(Strange) Strange behavior 
Coming over me again. 
(Strange) Strange behavior 
That's just me and my friends.
[Chorus repeated]
