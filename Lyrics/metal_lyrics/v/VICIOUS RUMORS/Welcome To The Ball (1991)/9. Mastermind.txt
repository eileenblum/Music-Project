[Lyrics: C.Albert, G.Thorpe // Music: G.Thorpe, M.McGee]

Blind leading the blind, 
Indolent nation, stagnation, they lay in repose, 
Silently cursing the lives that they chose.
Planet of remote control, 
Automation will breed indignation -- a matter of time. 
Nothing for you to decide.
No more reasons to think for yourself anymore. 
It's under control.
Mastermind 
Will choose and decide for you. 
Not one thing 
Left for your brain to do.
Wake up toughtless again, 
Mindlessly glance at the paper that's already read, 
Searching for something to fill the void in my head.
I look around only to find 
The essence of life has been taken away from mankind, 
Leaving our life blood behind.
No more reasons to think for yourself anymore. 
What am I for, tell me.
Mastermind 
Will choose and decide for you. 
Not one thing 
Left for your brain to do, it's wasting away.
It's okay, better off this way. 
Having all your choices made. 
No mistakes, no room for error. 
Life without life, the ultimate terror.
Mastermind 
Will choose and decide for you. 
Not one thing 
Left for your brain to do. 
Mastermind 
Will choose and decide for you. 
Mastermind, please, 
would you do away with me too?
