[Lyrics: C.Albert, M.McGee // Music: M.McGee, G.Thorpe]

Ever since you can remember, 
As far back as your memory will go, 
Life has been nothing but fear, haunted.
Nowhere to run, 
Got to find a way out of this place. 
Back to the wall, no way out. 
Is this the end of the chase?
No, no, I won't give up 'til I fall. 
If i have to run to the ends of the Earth 
I'll be damned if I'll crawl.
Like an animal, 
Living in constant unrest, 
Watching each step that you take, 
Hoping it won't be your last.
Nowhere to hide: 
Searching for some place to go, 
Living each day just moments away, 
Fearing what destiny holds.
No, no, I won't give up 'til I fall. 
If i have to run to the ends of the Earth 
I'll be damned if I'll crawl.
Hot on your heels, 
Dancing with life on the edge, 
Hot breath on the back of your neck, 
Learn how the kiss of death feels.
How your head reels, 
Footsteps away from the end. 
I can't go on anymore. 
Give me the strength, give me the will.
No, no, I won't give up 'til I fall. 
If i have to run to the ends of the Earth 
I'll be damned if I'll crawl.
No, no, I won't give up 'til I fall. 
If I have to run to the ends of the Earth 
There I will stand tall.
