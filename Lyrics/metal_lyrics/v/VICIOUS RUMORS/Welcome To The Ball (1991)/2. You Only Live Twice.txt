[Lyrics: C.Albert // Music: G.Thorpe, M.Mcgee]

So many ways to get lost in the haze, 
So many choices to make 
Whatever you choose 
You've got something to lose 
And you don't want to make a mistake.
Time passes by in the blink of an eye 
And you've hardly the time to think clear 
With time running out and the end drawing near, 
I will fight for what's right while I'm here
You only live twice, 
The story never ends, 
You only live twice.
The ignorant youth keep ignoring the truth, 
Running blind even though they can see. 
Just like the old, growing heartless and cold, 
losing touch with their reason to be.
Living the part, coming right from the heart, 
All a piece of the puzzle of life. 
Plotting a course that could end in remorse, 
Seems as though it was all meant to be.
You only live twice, 
The story never ends, 
You only live twice.
Now out of time, it's the end of the line, 
and the light at the end now is clear. 
So when it unfolds and the story is told, 
Be ready to face all of your fears.
Time passes by in the blink of an eye 
And you've hardly the time to think clear 
With time running out and the end drawing near, 
I will fight for what's right while I'm here
You only live twice, 
The story never ends, 
You only live twice.
