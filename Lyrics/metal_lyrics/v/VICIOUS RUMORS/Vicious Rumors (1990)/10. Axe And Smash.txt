[Lyrics &amp; Music: Vicious Rumors]

Axe and smash eternal thrills
Love the ladies on the hill
Late at night when the wind is cold
Gives us power warms our soul
It's the way we always dreamed
Living life to the extreme
I know..
We are the only ones out there one and all
No way out of here we'll carry on.. on ond on!
Conquer all we misbehave
When the lights are low it's all the same
Pound the stage we rage in terror
Cast aside but we know better
Cracking at the slightest touch
We break the speed of sound
I know...
We are the only ones out there.. one and all
No way out of here we'll carry on... on and on!
Can you feel me? Can you see me now?
Do ya like it? Do ya want it?
It's the way we always dreamed
Taking life to the extreme
You know
We are the only ones out there.. one and all
No way out of here we'll carry on on and on!
We are the only ones out there one and all
No way.. out of here we'll carry on!
