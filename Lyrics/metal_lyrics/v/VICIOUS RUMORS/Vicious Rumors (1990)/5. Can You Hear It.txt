[Lyrics &amp; Music: Vicious Rumors]

You've always been the one for me
Yeah, you know it's true
But time's standing still 'til our love breaks free
Can't you see?
Take a look at me, I'm yours for the taking
Or don't you even care?
All those years you've wasted just searching for a love not there
Anywhere
Can you hear it?
A voice inside
It's time you believe it
True feelings just don't lie
So you say to me your heart's been stolen away
How dare you compare those visions of the past to a love untried
Yours and mine
You're chasing illusions, trapped in a dream,
Won't ya throw away those thoughts,
Listen to your heart
And take a chance on me,
Baby please!
Can you hear it?
A voice inside
It's time you believe it
True feelings just don't lie
I've been waiting so long now for you to see the light
The flame is burning and our hearts are yearning for paradise
[Lead]
Can you hear it?
A voice inside
It's time you believe it
True feelings just don't lie
Can you hear it?
Can you hear it?
Can you hear it?
