[Lyrics &amp; Music: Vicious Rumors]

I'm feeling razor sharp riding on the cutting edge.
I'm going back and forth raging like a lunatic
I'm going to do things like never before
Take the key and open the door
Break the rules my will is my way
Light my fuse I'm coming back for more
Take the life that runs in your veins and flow!
Don't look back. or you'll fall
Don't slow down... no not at all...
Hellraiser
Look in his eyes
Hellraiser
Don't be surprised!
I'm feeling energized tantalized electrified
I'm going to find a way; live it up and take what's mine.
And if I have to abuse and destroy
lt's ok that's most of the joy!
Break the rules my will is my way
Light my fuse I'm coming back for more.
Take the life that runs in your veins and flow
Don't look back... or you'll fall
Don't slow down no not at all
Hellraiser
Look in his eyes
Hellraiser
Don't be surprised!
[Lead]
Last night, strapped in never to return
Lost my breath around that last turn
All that power rushing straight to my head....!
Don't look back.. or you'll fall
Don't slow down... no not at all!!!!
Hellraiser
Look in his eyes
Hellraiser
Don t be surprised
Hellraiser can't find your way back
Hellraiser it's time to attack
