[Lyrics &amp; Music: Vicious Rumors]

The key to love is understanding
Will it come down from above or will it fade away yeah
Ohh.. we can make it together
Take it in stride loving each other
Ship of fools take us away from here
What lies ahead is becoming all too clear
Listen and learn-we can start today
Oh can I trust you to trust me or will you throw my heart away
Ohh... we can make it together
Just one more try oh... oh... loving forever
Ship of fools-take us away from here
What lies ahead is becoming all too clear
[Lead]
Ship of fools take us away from here
What lies ahead is becoming all too clear
Ship of fools-oh take us away from here
What lies ahead is becoming all too clear
