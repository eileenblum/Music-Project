[Lyrics &amp; Music: Vicious Rumors]

Running the distance
Alive for the last time
Press on without question... without fear.. oh..
Give to the moon-give to the sun
We're going
Down.. down.. down...
Down to the temple
Don't you know we're going down.. down.. down...
Down to the temple...
Down to the top see the king
Other men of the cloth in a frenzy
Scale the steps to forever
Blood and body racing... oh..
Give to the moon give to the sun
We're going..
Down... down.. down..
Down to the temple
Oh we're going down.. down... down...
Down to the temple.. Clutch the bleeding heart!
[Lead]
Now I know without fear
The end is near
Give to the moon-give to the sun
We're going down.. down.. down..
Down to the temple
Oh ohh we're going down... down.. down..
Down to the temple
Clutch the bleeding heart
