[Lyrics &amp; Music: Vicious Rumors]

Behold the keepers of tomorrow's world
With lungs of iron hear them roar
Soldiers of the night with hearts of steel
Strength in numbers
All for one and one for all
A human machine, alive invincible!
But I know life is what you make it
Come on and take it
Kiss the hell goodbye and stand up!!!
We all want one world church
One world one earth
All blood runs the same!
Never walk alone no, just look around
A common ground we share all right!
A way of life a way to live it up!
A piece of the rock to set us free
Alive and well.. to see another day
A chance to live beyond the blackened past of yesterday
But I know, life is what you make it
Come on and take it
Kiss the hell goodbye and stand up!!!
We all want one world church..
One world one earth
All blood runs the same... spilling over
[Lead]
Prophecies have paved the way
Drug a man from on early grave
Pounded stakes right through his hands
And they expect him to understand
All for one.. and one for all
A human machine, alive invincible
Alive, a master plan
Saturate the earth with the blood of man!!!
We all want one world church.
One world one earth
All blood runs the same... spilling over!!!
