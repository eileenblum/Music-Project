[Lyrics &amp; Music: Vicious Rumors]

Sunday ride through the dark
I'm on my way
All alone win or lose
That's the way I play
Telling the some old lies.. holding what's inside... oh.
Oh I can feel it now.. all right
Adrenaline is flowing hard.. and I don't..
I don't want this feeling to end
The thrill of the hunt again
Challenge me or run
The thrill is in my veins
Not the lust for blood
But the excitement of the chase
Telling the some old lies.. holding what's inside... oh...
Oh I on feel it now.. all right
Adrenaline is flowing hard, and I don't..
I don't want this feeling to end
Oh the thrill of the hunt again
[Lead]
Challenge me or run
The thrill is in my veins
Not the lust tor blood
But the excitement of the chase
Telling the some old lies
Holding what s inside
Ohhh...
Oh I on feel it now.. all right
Adrenaline is flowing hard, and I don't..
I don't want this feeling to end
Oh the thrill of the hunt again...
Ohh.. thrill of the hunt!
