It's really been a pleasure to be such a pain
Oh, like a nasty stain that won't go away
I won't go away
Don't care what you say
Doin' things my way

I've got the hammer to nail you back into your box
I-I'm here to stay
I've got the power to stand up and take what I want

Are we all insane - Hate for hatred's sake
I choose to break away - Runnin' against the grain

I put the puzzle together and I slice my own pie
You know some won't like it - but to me that's just fine
Out of my way I don't want to play
Do you hear what I say
I don't want to play

I've got the pressure to back you right up to the wall
And you - do you hear what I say
This is the hour I welcome you all to the ball

Are we all insane - Hate for hatred's sake
I choose to break away - runnin' against the ... grain

Are we all insane - hate for hatred's sake
I choose... I choose to break away
