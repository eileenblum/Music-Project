Winter is falling, chill's in the air
Angel is calling a spirit somewhere
Memories that bind me, the tears never end

You've taken my brother, you've taken my friend
Taken my only friend

I know the clouds will be clearing away
The seasons will save me from thunder and rain

Loneliness cuts through my veins like a knife
This tortured soul so empty inside
Am I the victim or am I a slave
All these emotions, searching I pray

Now that the clouds have all cleared away
Time will continue, so will the thunder and rain.
