Pounding their way through your head see it all in your eyes
Reflections of overindulgence you're barely alive
Washing away in a swirling mass of confusion you're going to break!

On the edge
Living faster you live
On the edge!

Time after time anytime anyplace.. just don't care
Headstrong and blind plunging headlong no mind, unaware.
Head to the floor, face in the mud
Watch as you turn into ice!

On the edge
Because you do it so well
On the edge!

[Lead]

Now that your eyes hove been opened to what lies ahead
Don't be a loser, abuser, you may wind up dead!
Up off your ass!!! Take control 'cause the key to your destiny lies
within you!

On the edge
Living faster you live..
On the edge...!!!

Into the pit
down the hatch
Sinking fast
Can't get back
No way out
For you now
What the hell
Will you do
