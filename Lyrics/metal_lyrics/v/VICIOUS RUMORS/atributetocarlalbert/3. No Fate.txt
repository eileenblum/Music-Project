All I am, all I feel
All of this isn't real
Destiny questioning
Look at this life, look at your life, look at me

I don't believe in fate
I don't believe I was born too late
Yeah, I believe in destiny
As long as I can choose the one for me - yeah

Countless nights, endless roads
None of these, etched in stone
Free to choose, free to be, free to wander endlessly

I don't believe in fate
I don't believe I was born too late
Yeah, I believe in destiny
As long as I can choose the one for me

I don't believe in fate
I live my life, don't hesitate
I don't believe in heaven sent
I don't believe

I don't believe in fate
I don't believe I was born too late
Yeah - I believe in destiny
As long as I can choose the one for me

I don't believe in fate
I want to set the record straight
I believe in who I am
