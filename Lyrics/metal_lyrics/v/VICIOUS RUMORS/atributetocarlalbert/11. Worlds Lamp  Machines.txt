Everytime I turn around
Someone tries to bring me down
Spinning in a whirlpool
Competition over rules again

Intelligence and arrogance
Free the fire of righteousness
Attitude and sacrifice
Change inside ain't no time, wait

One more vulgar wrote the story
Stops to watch my heart
Catch me if you can

The power that's in front of me
The masters of technology
They fought them in a slaughterhouse
Is all we need to know

They civilize antagonize
Good enough to satisfy
All the needs all the lusts
All the dough

Laugh of a line
Try to decide but we don't
The chips are down
But the prices are up
So we're told
It's the times that I feel
Like I'm losing all control

Back to the worlds and machines
Is where we go
That's the place where we go
Twisting and turning are dreams to the top
Pictures of change and it never stops
Back to the worlds and machines

Acting on the silver screen
Killers everywhere are seen
Going in the streets at night
Taking on the world tonight

Repression is a state of mind
That could explode at anytime
Systems kick in over ride
Look out, missiles fly
Try a why

Sign of the times
Where do we go from here
Future destroyed
No wonder we don't share
Will we live
Will we live to grow old

Back to worlds and machines
Is where we go
That's the place where we go
Back to the worlds and machines we go
Down through the back is where we know
Back to the worlds and machines

Go
That's the place where we go
Go
Twisting and turning are dreams to the top
Pictures of change and it never stops
Back to the worlds and machines
