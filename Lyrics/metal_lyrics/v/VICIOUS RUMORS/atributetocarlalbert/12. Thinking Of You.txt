Been fourteen weeks since I've seen you
I never wondered, but I always knew
You seem to thrive on this macabre situation
Run at the signs of a real confrontation

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you

Justice for some is a high price to pay
There you remain in your self appointed cage
Now that you slept in your own bed of nails
Cry all along realizing that you failed - Ooh

Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you - Ohh

Nothing can save you, there is no escape
Crushed by the power of concentrated hate
(Ahh Ahh)Thinking of you
(Ahh) - Thinking of you - Yeah...
