After God and after taxes
The puppets who betray the masses
Reanimate the commonwealth
Inner structure in bad health

Like a beast locked in a cage
Manipulation time again
In their sleep they're never more sincere

Together we will reign
With everything to gain

Chorus
In this ministry of fear
Retribution is here...right here

Segregation - people cry
While racist hate is on the rise
So you're looking to the church
Something for a world of hurt

They nail your money to the cross
Writing off a corporate loss
In their sleep they're never more sincere

Together we will reign
With everything to gain

Chorus
In this ministry of fear
Retribution is here...right here
Together we will reign
With everything to gain
Life's a little strange
