I'm waiting around 'cause I haven't got paid yet
I'm banging my head on the side of the pavement
You're turning this into some kind of freak show
You gotta stop, I'm still waiting

Abandoned again
I thought you we're my friend
Abandoned again
I thought you we're my friend but you abandoned me again

You're flying your colors for all to see
You're fooling you're friends but you ain't fooling me, no
You closed the door and shut me out
What the hell ya' think I'm talking about?

Abandoned again
I thought you we're my friend
Abandoned so what?
Knife in my gut
No love is lost
Out if the grey, just go away

I've heard it all, enough of your bullshit
About your mouth, it's time you closed it
You've burned all your bridges, there's nobody left

Abandoned again
I thought you we're my friend
Abandoned again
I thought you we're my friend but you abandoned me again
