I believe in you more than myself
I see more in you than anyone else
So here I am with my eyes on you
Ready to go all the way through
All the way till the stars divide
Far away to the other side
I am yours eternally

As we drift away beyond the sands of time
I'm still reaching out my arms open wide
So here I am with my eyes on you
Ready to go all the way through
All the way till the stars divide
Far away to the other side
I am yours eternally
