Here we are tonight we gather around again to have a drink or two
And celebrate with friends we stood the test of time we gave it all we had
You can say we did it all and now here tonight I give it all to you
I thank you very much because you gave it right back too
Through all that was right all that was wrong

Together we unite together we unite
We'll make the wrong seem right if it takes all night

To the ones we lost their honour we hold dear
With pride and respect in our hearts they are still here
Now we meet again back with our old friends
With the strength to carry on

The privilege is mine I will never turn away
My loyalty is true I give it all to you
Thank you once again my heavy metal friend

Together we unite together we unite
We'll make the wrong seem right
If it takes all night together we unite
This is not the end just another place in time
I will see you all again together we unite
