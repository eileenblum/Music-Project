The night begins to close in silence screaming loud again
The heat has cooled but do not forget
The thirst for blood never ends
Welcome to my Hell break the silence tell the tale
Victims start to scream eyes of fire summon me

You hold the key inside the blood of ancient past
Sacrifice is made thirst for a kill
An acquired taste that is best served cold

Welcome to the end demise of man is revealed
Sirens echo screams eyes of fire summon me
Days become weeks on end a month a year around again
Instinct gets the best of me the thirst is still inside of me

The oceans swallow Earth and man wash away rebuild again
Your throat is dry you cannot drink a thirst for a kill
