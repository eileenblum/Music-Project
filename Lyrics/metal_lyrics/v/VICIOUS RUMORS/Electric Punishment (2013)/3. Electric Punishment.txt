We chose the hardest road We took on rock and roll
We watched the great ones rise and fall before they died
It seems so long ago back then we didn't know
The prize that lies ahead we would so long to get

Electric Punishment 
Plug me in turn me on again
I still need you
Turn me up loud as hell
I still hear you

We felt invincible feeding on decibels too much to realize
Then make it twice that size the damage takes its toll
And then you are on your own it is not for everyone
We have seen them cut and run

Through it all your still here then your still free
Some might fade away but not you and me
You got one life to give all you got don't give it away
