[originally by KISS]Well, it is a strange way the way you look at me
And it is a hard time time you been giving me
Come on and open up open up to me
So you can realize that I could set you free
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days

Well, it is a strange place that you have been living in
And it is a strange line you have been delivering
I think I like it but I am not really sure
Do not want to to fight it just want to feel some more
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days
