I'm the shooter I'm the gun the crime committed by everyone
I may cause a little pain live to see another day
I'm the slasher I'm the knife I won't get caught not in this life
I left all I had behind before it all overflows

There's no time to waste I won't be shot down
The evidence I have is clear I won't be shut out
Around the bend you know I'm here

The echoes off the ocean floor
Harmonize the Earth's core
They sing a song a chilling tune
A tale of ancient ruin

I'm the shooter I'm the gun the crime committed by everyone
I'm the shark you fear at sea a product of society
I am the gun it's what I've become
I am security in a life of uncertainty I am the gun

All around the world's changing shifting gears and rearranging
The air and sky become one a tale of ancient ruin
Immortal is a state of mind an endless sea of blue sky
There's no time to wonder why just be the one you thought you were

The evidence is clear I won't be shot down
A time of change is here I can't wait to take you out
I am the gun It's what I have become
I am security in a life of uncertainty I am the gun
