Hellish screams of ecstasy brought about by foolish needs
Tantalized by the flesh no time think of all the rest
Undercover live the lie siphon dreams from their minds
Morbid thoughts he protects
Dime store prophet never forgets
Come with me I'll take you for a ride
Sign right here it's just your life this time
Dime store prophet I feel safe with you

Can't rest or stop this thirst hardcore and well rehearsed
Nothing better to take away take it all Hell with no shame
Spend your hate so foolishly all that bullshit bounces off me
Give it all give it to me misuse of power for centuries
Dime store prophet I feel safe with you
Please tell me that you'll be there too
I know that you will save my soul
And I give you total control

Please feel free to come and go at will
Pay my fee it's how I get my thrills
Come with me I'll take you for a ride
Sign right here it's just your life this time
