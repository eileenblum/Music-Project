[Smyth, Thorpe, O'Connor]

Hey Mister, you on the street 
With no hope in your eyes 
I can see you
Sometimes I will see 
What I want to see 
Sometimes I just watch 
I watch him fade away 
I watch him fade away
If he makes it through 
Through another night 
That it be alright 
Will we ever be surprised
Take a look 
Use your eyes 
Use your head and realize 
Take a look around tell me what you see 
Sometimes I just watch 
I watch him fade away 
take a look around tell me what you see
