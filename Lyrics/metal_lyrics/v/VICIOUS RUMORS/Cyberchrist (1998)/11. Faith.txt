[Thorpe, Smyth, O'Connor]

We follow the wind to new horizons 
A suitcase of dreams in our hands 
An offer to take a chance at freedom
We sail out to sea with hope and madness abroad 
A madness that's out of control 
Living on faith we leave our homes
Here we go, oh yeah... 
Turning things around, heading for new ground 
And in our darkest hour oh yeah... 
We're looking towards the future
We land on the shores of the unknown island 
An island of beggars and thieves 
Now you're left on the streets 
Alone and afraid for so long 
Pounding the pavement again 
Your back's to the wall 
You can not stand it
This life is a test 
Within our body 
A test of our faith 
And our strength 
When you remember 
The darkness will fade into the light
