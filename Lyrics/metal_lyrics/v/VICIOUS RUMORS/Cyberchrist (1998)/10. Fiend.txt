[Smyth, Thorpe]

It's feeding my mind 
Killing time on my hands 
It's eating my mind 
Finding a place to lash out once again
I can't shake the feeling 
That is burning through my veins 
Slam the gates and lock all the doors 
And I won't let nobody in
It's drinking my blood 
Racing straight to my brain 
Talking right through me man 
Fuckin feeling good 
Right now I feel like shit
This fiend is taking over 
And demanding all control 
I've got to make a stand 
Before it crucifies my soul
Fiend, Fiend, Fiend...
