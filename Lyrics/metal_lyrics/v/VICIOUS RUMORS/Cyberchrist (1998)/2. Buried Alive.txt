[Thorpe, Smyth, O'Connor]

You feel it weighing over head 
you worked yourself down to the bone 
burning and baring the scars of the walking dead 
another time another tale
You can't run, you can't hide, your ass is bound and tied 
in your skin you can't win becomes a prison within 
all your cries all your lies they're eatin' you up inside 
Truth is clear truth is now so let there be no doubt
slippin' through my hands life and it's luxuries 
losin' your mind while chasing the time 
working so hard just to pay the bills 
but sometimes it feels your being buried alive 
being buried alive
If you want it and you need it 
you gotta get up and take it 
don't let this world drag you down
Anger builds pressure mounts you have no will to fight 
your own fears your own thoughts they're eating you up inside 
truth is clear truth is now so let there be no doubt 
you must change rearrange or you'll be buried alive
