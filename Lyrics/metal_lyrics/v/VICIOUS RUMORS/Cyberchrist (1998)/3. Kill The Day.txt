[Smyth, Thorpe, O'Connor]

Roll the stone that held down your soul for so long 
The head games they played on your mind like a song 
Take a chance, become one with all your fears 
Seize the moment you waited for all of  these years
Time won't wait for me 
Seize the moment, be on your game, you will succeed
But you are waiting, digging yourself a hole 
Insane, crazy, alone 
Waiting as time passes by 
You are waiting for something to show
To be your best you've got to take it all the way 
You've got the guts now go out and take on the fame 
Make a stand show what your heart has to say
Bring it on you tried so hard, just go all the way 
Don't stop now, you've come so far just to beat the game
