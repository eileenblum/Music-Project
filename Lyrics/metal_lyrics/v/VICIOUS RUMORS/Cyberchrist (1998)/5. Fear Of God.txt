[Thorpe, Smyth]

I'm sweating in the dark 
It's running down my neck 
I've got to break away 
I don't believe a word
I can't make any sense 
Of what's happened here 
We've dug a hole to hell 
And now we're buried there
I'm not the only one who's got the fear of God 
It's running ramped here, false love, hate and fear 
You're not the only one who's got the fear of God 
Now the only test is what you do with it next
I feel I'm being watched 
By eyes around the clock 
Sea of the living dead 
Arise and live again
They try to keep you down 
They're messin' with your head 
But if you keep your faith 
You might not end up dead
My eyes are burning 
But I still see through the fog 
My legs are bound, but I'm still climbing the walls 
My heads on fire, can't feel it at all
