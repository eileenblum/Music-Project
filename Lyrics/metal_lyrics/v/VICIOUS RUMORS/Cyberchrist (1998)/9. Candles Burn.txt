[Thorpe, Smyth]

I would walk a mile in your shoes 
Even though they're way too small 
I would stop the sun for you 
And let the candles burn till dawn 
Let the candles burn till dawn
I know you've  got the love that I need 
I know you've  got the things that I crave 
I know sometimes things fall apart 
So I pick up the pieces everyday
All night let the candles burn 
All night let the flicker burn
I would give my blood to you 
Even though I'm running low 
If it's the last thing I do 
I'll let the candles burn till dawn 
Let the candles burn till dawn
I feel the pressure building, back off 
I want it all and that;s not enough 
I know you've got no time for mistakes 
So I pick up the pieces everyday
