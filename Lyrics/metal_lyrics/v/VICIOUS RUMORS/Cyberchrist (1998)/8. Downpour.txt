[Thorpe, Smyth, O'Connor]

Black clouds are raining down molten lead 
As the chaos unfolds in my aching head 
In a flood of my blood I'm washed away 
Just to wake up and battle another day
Pierces my life on a stick impaled 
Like a freight train of demons straight from hell 
This rain of emotion keeps pounding me 
Got to break the restraints of this misery
This downpour shall never end 
In this downpour no one ever wins 
In this downpour you must stand tall 
In this downpour may God help us all
Now my thirst for survival is quenched with sand 
In a desert of heat tortured barren lands 
Straight jacket of scars it tears my skin 
How I long for the downpour to cleanse my sins 
Downpour
