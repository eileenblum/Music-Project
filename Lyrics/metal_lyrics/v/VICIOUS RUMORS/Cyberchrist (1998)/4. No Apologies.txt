[Smyth, Thorpe, O'Connor]

I won't apologize 
For the way I make you feel 
Cause you're not what you seem to be, yeah!
I can't be sorry for 
All the things said and done 
Or the chain of events that's yet to come
Searching deep inside 
Your body weighed down 
Super adrenalized 
Your head so lost in the clouds
Everybody wants their claim to fame 
I'll get mine, you'll want yours just the same 
Everybody wants their 15 minutes of fame 
But the price tag changes, it changes from day to day
I won't be crucified by 
The actions that you take 
Abused and second rate 
I will be justified 
When the wrecking ball brakes through 
It's the chain of events that's yet to come 
Whatcha gonna do
It all becomes clear 
Wash the filth away 
Super sanitized 
It's a brand new day
