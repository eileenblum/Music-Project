[Smyth, Thorpe, Thorn]

There'll come a day when we throw the switch 
with so much power at our fingertips 
pounding the keys like we're hammering nails 
all the way through
stare at the screen like a man possessed 
fixed on the faith, this is not a test 
we come together for the birth of a God 
a new God
(enter!)
Download the bible in your silicon church 
preachin' the word of the holy man 
you lost your way till you logged on to soul search 
and found your way home
Lords of the world, messiah machines 
they're talkin' in tongues, dreamin' digital dreams 
Cyberchrist loves one and all 
Get high on the rise, come down on the fall 
Exhault the new God
Unto this power I've become a slave 
locked in the web I've been here for days 
I give my all and bow to you 
But still you laugh
I pray to heaven through a modem of hell 
addicted to this virtual drug 
crucify this voodoo machine 
and pull the hallowed plug
