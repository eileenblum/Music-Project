I live in the forests
Spectral talking
I am what I found
Not what I see
I travel, I aviate
On the stones of old
And the speech that is mine

Great and rich ebon vasts
Of the wooden palace
Enthrall, for once
He was there within
And with great feet
Along through the world
The sun passes his eyes
