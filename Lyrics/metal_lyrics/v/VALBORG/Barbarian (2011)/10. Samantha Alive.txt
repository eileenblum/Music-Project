Time has come to leave now
Bygone days of war
Transcend time and dimensions
To follow her call

Are you alive?

Samantha, are you alive?
Are you afraid to die?
Dancer in the moonlight
Are you afraid to die?

Life will never be easy
Until the very end
I lived a thousand years
To hold your hand

Are you alive?

Samantha, are you alive?
Are you afraid to die?
Dancer in the moonlight
Are you afraid to die?

Tell me about your dreams
This will be our last time
Together as one
For one last time

For one last time

I come from the past to love you
Did you forget the meaning of life?
I come from the past to love you
Keep the truth about Samantha alive

We will only unite in death

I come from the past to love you
Did you forget the meaning of life?
I come from the past to love you
Keep the truth about Samantha alive
