Towering clouds
Deities born

Into the smoke of holy prophecies

My heart
The mists of fallen kingdoms

Again it begins, again it ends

Towering clouds
Mighty and eternal
Over fields of fire
And seas of the ancient gods

Cyclopean cities drowning in dreams

Towering clouds
Forlorn beauty, suffering

The ones who were the first will rise again

Showing the world their powers
