I believe in nothing
I am an ethereal entity
My temple, my grave

The dead ride in an amethystine sky
Rotten flesh of the king

None of thy innocent lies ever evoked my chant
Awaken in the crypt of a pandemonic graveyard

Oh, if I ever died
Into an amethystine sky

Oh, so transcendental
Beyond the dusk horizon far
