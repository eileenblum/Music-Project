Deep inside it slumbers
It whines, it hums
Grows louder
Until the shell breaks

It awaits the things to come
So long, it knows none else

Casts off splinters
Licks off discharge and pus
Shortly pants, pushes on
Out into freedom
Leaves its nest
Cold, sounds
Wetness, pain

It awaits the things to come
So long, it knows none else

Life is struggle, struggle is proof of life
It must live on, tear enemies to shreds

It is free
It takes all, just for itself
It knows no other
It must be free
The other I
