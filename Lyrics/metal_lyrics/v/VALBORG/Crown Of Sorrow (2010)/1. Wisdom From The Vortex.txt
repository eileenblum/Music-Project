Praying to the ground
Old angel of decadence
Waiting in the elder cold
Moments of dying in sorrow

Fields of thy return
You are moving temples in the sky
Crowned with gold in stone and times

Come to us - the end of knowledge
Come to us - through broken circles

[Lyrics written by J. Buckard, June 2008]
