Evoke such grandeur
As a dark god I shall descend again
Into the sky of the abyss

The word remains unspoken
Only blades clash into mountains
Enlighten the night
Encircle strongholds

For I am Nihili
Embittered nocturnal lord
Thunderbolt

Ravenous hordes cross the land
Merciless slaughter rages
Now feast your decadence
As impaled abject souls

The row will fade away
And the greatgrand silence will return

[Lyrics written by C. Kolf, October 2008]
