I have created god
I came out of true darkness
Before me there was nothing

I am the father of it all
I raped the sun
I recreated terra
I am the one

Within my shit god was born

I am space
Primitive and old
I am space
Original and cold
I am space
A storm eternal

From my very faeces, god was born
As a crying spectre of eternal misery
I speak into aeons of dust and fire

For I am space and I am coldness itself
Reaching through with glittering claws, undirected
Images of kings and darkness, enthundering

[Lyrics written by J. Buckard/C. Kolf, May 2008]
