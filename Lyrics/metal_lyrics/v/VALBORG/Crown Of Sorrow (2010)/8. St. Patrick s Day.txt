Dreamer

The jewels twinkle
And so your eyes
How great the wish
And how empty the heart

When the light is fading
In the field of dreams
Like a dance in the sky
A waving in the wind

Dreamer

Harvest the jewels
When the world is silent
For all empty hearts
And all great wishes

A gesture in the moonlight
In the field of dreams
For all the tragedies
For all the memories
