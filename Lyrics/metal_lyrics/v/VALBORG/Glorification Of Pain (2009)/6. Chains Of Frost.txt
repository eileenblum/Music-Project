Silence sleeps within the soul
Like fires watch over the earth
Thunder drowns all fears
A guardian weeps with no tears

How long since it has passed?
I gave it to the stars

And for you - the glory
There is no rest
Thus I long for winter nights
The smell of ghosts
And chains of frost

Watch the Horizon
Vast is the gate to honour

Sharpen my teeth for this last rage
My grave will be greeted
Flags will be seen in the skies
But not for you, you bastards
