In the land of the sky when nighttime rises, 
The trees become shades of grey, white and black, 
The water is tinged with a reddish glow, 
The mountains and skies formations change 
With the wind 
The sun sinking beneath 
The waves strands of wonder, through the night 
Descending as the stars, for a past that never was 
And silence falls eternal darkening day 
Turned it into the night 

We seeing the light fade, and the darkness rising 
We feel the shadows creep along the horizon 
Darkness sorrounding us, 
The light darkens rippling across the sky. 
Shadows creep along the horizon, 
Hurtling spears to pierce the night 

As night crept back into the world, 
We farewelled the twilight land 
As beneath the waters swirled, 
The dusk will bring fourth... 
A rebirth 
Lurking the twilight mountains, far over the deep blue ocean 
A dark tale and a song of nautical, 
To the land of ancient night
