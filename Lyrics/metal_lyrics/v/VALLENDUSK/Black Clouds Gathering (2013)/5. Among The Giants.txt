The roots of the mountain, dwell deep in dark earth 
Forlorn against bright stars, wild beasts clamber 
Around in the darkness, feasting on fear 

The howling winds, marching the journey towards the mountain 
The soughing winds, shrouding the giant with the darkness 

Weighty is the sight... 
The spirit flame shall alight... 

The sun is rising 
Shall wear the mountain down 
The might time fall, can break its colossal back 

The nefarious witch of death mountain. Wrapped in the evening cold 
The sky slowly bled, welcoming the foreboding night
