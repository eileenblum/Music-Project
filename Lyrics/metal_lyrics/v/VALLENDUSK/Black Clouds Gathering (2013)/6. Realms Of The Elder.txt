Walk down paths beneath the mountains 
Listen to the wind blow through outstretched forests, 
Carrying ade old stories told by ancient voices 
As they rise above, Reaching their arms to the sky 

Like the spines of serpents 
Among the ivory of darkness creature 

Frozen now, in blankest at our feet 
Doomed to eternal suffering. 
The ground, disturbed by the human 
Carrying ade old stories told by ancient voices 
As they rise above, Reaching their arms to the sky 
Like the spines of serpents 
wrought from the netherworld 

Long lost stories fly on ancient wings 
Forgotten forever 
By the eyes and tongues of humans 
Lost beneath the sands of time
