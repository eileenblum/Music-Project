Floating around a thousand of dust 
An ocean of time and space 
Drift through all of life in grave 

A sign round in our hands reads to earth or burst 
As we are spinning in the darkness of blackest night 

Time is shifting sands have left us behind 
As if exploding through an endless rift 

An ocean of time and space 
Drift through all of life in grave 
Through vast expanses of dark and light 

Over the horizon shines the lunar's many lines 
In all their mighty glory, above the eternal shade, 
As the oceanic breeze begins to fade 
Into the darkness skies 
We are alone in a vast ocean 
Of constellations
