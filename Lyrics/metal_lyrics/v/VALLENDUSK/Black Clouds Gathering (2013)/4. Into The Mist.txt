The journey begins from the hollows 
Through the forest trails 
Creating way on the mossed ground, 
A breeze howling through the air, 
And voices carried out throughout the forest, 
They forge on a head blazing their way like ancestors before 
Into the unknown and dense forest they roam 

The scars remain 
Feeling the swells of the ocean echo 
The growing darkness 
Roaming the woods 
In the labyrinth of a shattered mind 
With the full of mist 
They embraced the portal dream 
Parallel dimensions 

Lurking silently in the mist and haze 
Forgotten by the world 
Isolated from life 
Wandering all alone
