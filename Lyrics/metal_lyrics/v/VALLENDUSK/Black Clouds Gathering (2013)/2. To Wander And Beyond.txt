Wandering... 
Searching for the shadow in an endless field 
The sun is shining but we can't see it. Can't see the sky 
Falling to the ground, with the light of the sunguiding us 
To a trail thick with thorns, in a forest dark and bleak 

Mysteries of night,watching from the skies, 
As the light in blind scenery, 
And the darkness in single strides 

As the twilight realms, shadowed clouds of silence, 
We find a crimson sword, forged in an ancient vale 
where fell a forest hail. We traveled to the hither lands 
Beyond the foaming ocean, the wind blown the shadow 

Over moor and mountain, forest and land, soaring over 
Into the never-ending grasses, 
That move like a thousand hands waving 
Vast expanses of nothingness, 
A solitary figure against the endless sky, 
We came in colours of every shade
