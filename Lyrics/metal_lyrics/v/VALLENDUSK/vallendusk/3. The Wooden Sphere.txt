Secrets of a shadows wind
Whispers unheard
sounds in the night,
Spirit echoes
of footsteps past,
Beckoning closer
a hesitant light..

Silence under midnight skies
Songs of winter to the stars
Voices soft begin to speak
To the snowy mountain peak

Filled with rush of untold danger
Anxiety in heart and mind

Silence under midnight skies
Songs of winter to the stars
Voices soft begin to speak
To the snowy mountain peak

Worry brushed aside in anger
Reckless feet on paths unwind

Frosted icicles that hang
In wait of a more forceful breeze

Silence under midnight skies
Songs of winter to the stars
Voices soft begin to speak
To the snowy mountain peak

Green is gone to white and silver
Bare the branches of the trees
