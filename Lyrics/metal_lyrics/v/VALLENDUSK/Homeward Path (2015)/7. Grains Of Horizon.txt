The clouds break forth the streams of light
To dance upon the earth
As the light swallows into homes
And cradled in the sands of time
A murky rock consumes all the light
A gentle breeze blows through the night
Whispering through the grass
Ripples on the water form
As the rain glistens on the glass
Mother earthâs tears in avalanche
A faint cold fear runs through the veins
Freezes up the heart
Freezes up the heat of life

Almighty nature presence all around
He summons us to go
To the peaceful waters flow
The great cosmic cycles
Cleansing the earth
And the shadows growling still

Lightning shrouds the mountains
A dark herald of things to come
Longings spirits and mages number
The fallen and count the damned sum

A rainbow arcs across the sky
Whiteness overflew, balances corrupted
Everything became so blurry
The autumn leaves in their splendor
Fall gracefully to the earth
And stars proclaim their song at night

The skies darken as the clouds roll in
Blocking out the light
Whips of lightning break the darkness
Flashes of angry light
Then the thunder rumbles
Like a rumbling that shakes the earth
The wind howls like a wounded animal
Leaves and dust fly through the air
The seaweed and petrels the sand
And the mud and the riverâs end
The wind is silenced
The whips and gongs have ended
The blue starts to reappear

Then the gentle of
The sea-motherâs tongue
On the oceanâs evening
And the hum of song through
The shadow and the clouds scudding
Free through the water
A sudden storm in the deep
Miracles in motion
For the soulâs delight.
