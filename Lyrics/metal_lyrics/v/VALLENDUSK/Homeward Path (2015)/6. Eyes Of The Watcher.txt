With eyes of the moon coat of arms of the night
On clouds of soft velvet unfurl the twilight
Stopping you to listen and watch its plight
You might hear the howl of the weakening light.

To gaze upon an empty night showered by the darkest
glow illuminate the woods and morrowâs rise

Slowly sinking into black where path and signs start
to lack. When daylight vanished only darkness left

As the light floats into the sea
And sinks in depths to flee, flashes
Of the eyes rear up the world

To watch the trees and grass glow by an eerie
Iridescent light see the glowing grass
Turn to charred ash

The rule of the stars and shadows deplore
The light and its joy to reign over the dark in rising
Days to be fought and the night was all gone as itâs
Known among all the day won all along.. The rule of
The stars and shadows deplore the light and its joy to
Reign over the dark

Amongst the shadows dancing, beneath a moon lit sky,
Sweeps the depth of darkness no one can defy
And within the nightly air across the forest path
Walks a hidden figure with the structure of a lass

A cry pierces the night sky splitting the clouds like
Lightning, settling down like ashes tasting the leaves
Thunderous echoes follow after while the fogs of
Fear spread below..
