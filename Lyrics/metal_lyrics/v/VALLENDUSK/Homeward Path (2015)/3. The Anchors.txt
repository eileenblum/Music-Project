The sun lost a war long time ago
and the moon retreated in haste
waves wash over shores
the earth is our ship
and we turn through
the ocean of time and space
on the mad waves
of a dark cosmic deep
lost in a vast sea like paint
against a burning horizon
watch the footsteps fade away

Billions of lights are our guides
the soul of stars and lightyears away
that have already died and reborn
swallowed into black mouth

Forsaking creatures to wither and fade
and leaving in our stead thorn and nightshade
to injure and poison in the barren waste
where the wind howls like the wild banshee

We are dreaming
to be reborn
with mind awaken
as we ride the voyage
longing in sea spirits
and reincarnation
lost in delusions
of afterlife
and immortality

In gravitational tides we are pulled
and seafarers draw strange patterns in the sky
we might cut the universe to size
and stop our minds from drowning
we forget to took with fear and awe
in wonder we whisper
it's the world we cannot
touch beyond the hull

And way beyond
in our black ocean
the stars are reborn
the light of millions touches us
through aeons and fill
the empty skies
with sights
that leave us wordless

All energy survives and
recycle into endlessness

We reap the power
of the wayward spirit
and howling in nowhere land
we are immortal
we navigate the skies

We are immortal.....
