Reaching up to the gloomy sky
with hands that stink of death
crawling across the windswept plain
to draw one final breath
shouting out defiant rhymes
an archaic war raging still

As the night falling on the ghastly fields
veiling a scarlet river cross the plain

The rising crescendo of soldier footsteps
each regiment falling in stages
the clanking armors breathe so heavy
a silent moment passing still
a gentle breeze moving through the air

Bodies sprawling like fields of wheat
weapons flashing and blood marching for wards

Lifeless eyes staring out
as the cold wind blows
in the still of night,
a gentle sleep remained unbent
a channeled homage for life,
unrivaled by dissent
reach morning, before the sun,
awoke something else..

Bodies sprawling like fields of wheat
weapons flashing and blood marching for wards

Dissolving the ground into red mud the air is heavy with
the scent of death as the sun sets, red glow bursts,
Darkness enclosing cutting off the sight, fading away

Hail to the fire, earth, water, and air
taking back the elements to the ground.
expoding despair, yearning hearts,
shattered souls, a dying of nostalgia,
caged in bitter cold, seize the treacherous night,
farewell forever.
