The pulse of the earth pounds out a deadly rhythm
Blood of liquid rock erupting forth from beneath
The black sea, however looms dislocated from Earthâs
Divergence it haunts the new convergence with hull-like hollowness.

The beauty lays scattered in the newborn ash shine upon the
World in fiery light island sinks beneath the waves with a
crash screams fill the air as fluttering birds take flight.

The sea serpent precipitates a neon luminescence only to be
swept by the scumbling tides. Their breaths smoke and
Perspire to the lava layer. Rafts of pumice float away to the
distant lands. While in the air, ash distorts the light,
The sky turns hues as it hadnât happened beforehand
As an upshot of the giant might.

Inferno erupting from the waves
Arising the son, as the fire water
Burn the son of flames, born on his
Parentâs grave. In the glare of
Burning lights
The lava bleeds to black, as the scrape thin horns of the
Mighty mountain probing for answers.

Plague and destruction shall wreak again
From the island of the grieving mountains
The genetic impulse of conservation triumphing
Over the temptation

Their breaths smoke and perspire to the lava layer
Raft of pumice float away to the distant lands
While in the air, ash distorts the light
The sky turns hues it hadnât happened beforehand
As an upshot of the giant might.

Vicious red foams bear down
As the invader crawls
Red and blazing like wildfires in the night
Crimson-like bloodstains on the
White fur of an innocent lamb
Reaching its discontented fingers
To the unblemished earth below

Heat oppresses the air
The blood flows to the skin
Verbal fire and brimstone smash
Through fragile walls
When enraged angry flames gruesomely
Cleansing all in its path
Blood runs red in the hearts of the living
Burning through the rebellious veins
The wild smokes curled, seize the day of the sun
Velvet darkness enshrouding
Glares reaching for the sky
Burned and perished
A fire from the ashes shall be woken
Once we lost now regained his crown
