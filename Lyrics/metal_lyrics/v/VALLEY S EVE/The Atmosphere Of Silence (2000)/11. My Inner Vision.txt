Can you hear me?
Do you hear the inner wail out of my soul?
I call for you!
Because I can't go on any longer
My body is dead and I can't feel my own emotions Come and show me the way
The way I have never known
Come and show me the way
That you have chosen for me Every morning in front of my mirror
I asked myself who am I?
I'm furious, evil, disgusted by my own
But when?
Please tell me when you will feel my pain
When my sufferings are over Come and give me a little rest
That I can sleep in silence
And let me drink water out of your hands
To refresh my burning soul Come and show me the way
The way I have never known
Come and show me the way
That you have chosen for me My praying became silent
My faith has vanished
But my hope is still there
Like a flicking light in the dark Now come to me and bring me out of here
To get rid of my inner visions
Come to me, rescue me from
My shackling depressions
Which are always chilling me
