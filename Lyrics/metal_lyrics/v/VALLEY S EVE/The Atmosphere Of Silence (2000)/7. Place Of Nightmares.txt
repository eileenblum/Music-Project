Here I am again
I can't be extinguished easily
Because I am a part of yourself
I come whenever I want, taking your sleep, the quiet
There will be no way to escape from me
And our story will start once again Don't turn back, I'll always be in front of you
Look in the mirror: you will get to know
Everything which you always wanted to know
Look out of the window. Do you remember the days?
It has been a long time. You have forgotten me But I always stayed near by you
Do you remember the night where all the pictures died? Here is the place of you own nightmares
Firmly in my hands
Black angels will come, black angels will leave
Until the day you have defeated yourself Did you feel the pain I have injured you?
As your life went by in pictures, like a movie
In only one mement I have effected all of your dreams
Even without having a bad consciece I'm what you fear most: The other side of your self
And I will stay until you have defeated yourself Here is the place of your own nightmares
Firmly in my hands
Black angels will come, black angels will leave
Until the day you have defeated yourself
