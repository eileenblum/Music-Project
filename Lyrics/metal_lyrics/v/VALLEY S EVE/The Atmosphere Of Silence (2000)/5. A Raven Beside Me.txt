I hope the night will come today
To bring me to the eternal light
To find the only answer
Since so many years I know
That the moment can come each day
That I am living for I hear them every night
Crying in my dreams - night after night I don't know what was going on inside of me
So many tears
I will burn in hell
With the pain of others
For my own satisfaction
And I will atone for it until my end
I know that I will die today Out of the dark - into the light again
Out of the dark - into the light again and again Deep inside, my burning heart
You have destroyed my whole life
I have to fight against yourself
Kill my emotions
A raven besides me - spreads his wings
Covers the face - like a robe
And the shadow - on the wall
Shows me his face Out of the dark - into the light again
Out of the dark - into the light again and again Out of the dark - I see the light again
Out of the dark - inside I'll die
