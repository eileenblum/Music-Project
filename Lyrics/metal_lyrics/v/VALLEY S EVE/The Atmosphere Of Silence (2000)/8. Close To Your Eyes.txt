It has been time to come, my friend
Your dreams and illusions will lead
You only to one way: my way
The confusion You will kneel by the forces of my species
Because you are too weak Close your eyes, and let me direct you
This way could be the last
Close your eyes and let you guide into a world
You have could be the last Your brain tries to get aware myself
But you will loose, again and again
Until the time comes when you will
Give me your personality Your are deeply addicted to my power with all
Of your possession Close your eyes, and let me direct you
This way could be the last
Close your eyes and let you guide into a world
You have could be the last
