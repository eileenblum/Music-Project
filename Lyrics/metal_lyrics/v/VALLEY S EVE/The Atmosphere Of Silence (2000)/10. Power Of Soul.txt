An inner scream
Pain, I live, I die
How do you explain the escape from the grieved heart?
I live, I die
Don't try it, you can not conquer all the confusion
In the centre of your soul
Over your heart Unconsciously we follow
Turns us into stone, day by day
It degenerates into wickedness
Everything only because of you
Remote-controlled humans with their hearts
Only with toil they follow the commands Our hope of life
Becomes rusty from time to time And with it all the dreams are dying
For him, for her, for all
The power of the soul
Which is dead from the birth
