Worn out I'm lying in my bed
My head is filled with emotions
I hear the hands of the clock and feel
The coldness conquer my body
Now it is noon and the sun is shining
Through the window in my eyes
Then I saw the man on the black horse
I have never seen him before
And now time is standing still Who are you? I asked him
He was silent while riding
Towards me a plain black cloth all
Over his head and body
He's coming near and nearer
And my eyes are paralysed
With the blood on his hands I see him escape
My eyes are closing, my soul is rising over me
And the hands of the clock drown My last breath
last breath
My last breath
My last breath
