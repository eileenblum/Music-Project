Countless years have passed
And we managed it to front proof until today
To left the belief defeat our feelings
Eye to eye, death for death
This is what remains from the men
Which have been holy for us All of the books which are learned in a wrong way
For the others as firm as a rock
For the one the holy war
And old wounds begin to bleed
Than the hate comes to take by force your soul and mind We went to honour the holy ground
And returned - the hands covered with blood The sky turns red and we'll become pale
Like the moon conquers the day
Religion, war, and everyone who don't become aware
Will fall down like a tree cut down to the ground
