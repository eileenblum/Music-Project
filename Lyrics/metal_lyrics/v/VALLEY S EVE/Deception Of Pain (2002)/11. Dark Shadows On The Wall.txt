I am the uncalled dream
Out of the dark of the night
My mighty rage turns my senses into force
Do you know how it has been the last time?
Do know what it means if all hope dies?
I am the crack between the dimensions
The picture you'll never see
I am king of your dreams
My brother is the life and my father is death

Dark shadows on the wall
And my blood flows again
Dark shadows on the wall
Forgotten place
Forgotten dream

You think you can understand me
But be careful cause still there are worlds existing
Not everyone is allowed to come in
Worlds you never have seen before
Can you feel my inner bleeding?
Come give me your hand
Can you tell me who I am?
I am king of your dreams
My brother is the life and my father is death

Dark shadows on the wall
And my blood flows again
Dark shadows on the wall
Forgotten place
Forgotten dream
