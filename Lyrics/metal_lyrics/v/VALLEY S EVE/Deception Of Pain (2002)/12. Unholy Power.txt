He was dying thousands of deaths
I am corroded inside by ignorance
You show me all the time
Blinded by  the illusion for never being alone any more
The longing will become my grave

Unholy power
An evil in your eyes
Unholy power
Secrets in your mind
No mercy in his eyes

Wounds will turn into scars
Which exists a whole life
Do not believe in eternity
It might be your fate
Do not believe in mystery
Cause nothing will last forever
This longing will become my grave

Unholy power
An evil in your eyes
Unholy power
Secrets in your mind
No mercy in his eyes
