I have been a prisoner of melodies
Which sounded beautiful
But the angels who had been singing them
Now turned into snakes

The mirror in your eyes
I can see you on the other side
The mirror in your eyes
Tells me all your thoughts
You keep inside

They demand back their lost dreams
Corroding my heart step by step
I see the faces of death
Only one thought controls all the dying

The mirror in your eyes
I can see you on the other side
The mirror in your eyes
Tells me all your thoughts
You keep inside

I see a river with flowing blood
I have to hide myself in unknown places
I hear them screaming for me
You are a murderer

The mirror in your eyes
I can see you on the other side
The mirror in your eyes
Tells me all your thoughts
You keep inside
