I have been falling asleep
And now I am waiting for you
You have the power to appear whenever you like
But I am ready for you
When you come here for the last time

In your head
Your mind is twisted with pain
I'm crucified
In your head
Frustration building up inside
Dark faces in your mind

You cut deep wounds into my soul
He's only a part of the game I'm playing
The demon of my dreams and now he's awake
But I am ready for you
When you come here for the last time

In your head
Your mind is twisted with pain
I'm crucified
In your head
Frustration building up inside
Dark faces in your mind
