When the morning sun rises
I leave my past behind
Looking to the horizon, the sun goes down again
Somewhere over the waters, do I feel them?
As a silent cry, deeply hidden
I see the heaven crying, rivers of tears and seas of pain

Kingdom of pain
A fallen angel holds your past
Kingdom of pain
We are the chosen ones
Beyond the sea of blood

Heaven and ocean begin to darken
Can you hear them whisper again
Now it's time
Of my rebirth into another dimension
Somewhere over the waters, do I feel them?
As a silent cry, deeply hidden
I see the heaven crying, rivers of tears and seas of pain

Kingdom of pain
A fallen angel holds your past
Kingdom of pain
We are the chosen ones
Beyond the sea of blood
