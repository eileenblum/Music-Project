Now I am sitting here in the dark
Time seems to stand still
It has been heaven and hell
We are playing with fire
It gets you for an eternal journey
On the way to the infinity of your soul
Do you hear the complaints of longing deep in yourself?
The sound of the dying?

This is the time
This is the point of no return
And you burn forever

Can you see me?
I am the disease of the time
I let bleed your lips
Without me you are not able to dream
I send you my fears
I'm the evil of your brain
Do you hear the complaints of longing deep in yourself?
The sound of the dying?

This is the time
This is the point of no return
And you burn forever

In the ruins of my dreams
There is a secret
Can you see it?
Then help me out of here

This is the time
This is the point of no return
And you burn forever
