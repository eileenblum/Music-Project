It comes in the morning, it comes in the evening
Creating all sorrows
Nobody can hide from you
Sometimes I long for you
But when you are near I am trying to escape
But when the time will come
I will face you and look into your eyes

The sun will shine again
My spirit burns and fails
The sun will shine again
Black secret is born
When nightmares begin

The night is falling and we are alone
You and I - time stands still
You are the secret in my eyes
The shadows of transience are returning now
But when the time will come
I will face you and look into your eyes

The sun will shine again
My spirit burns and fails
The sun will shine again
Black secret is born
When nightmares begin
