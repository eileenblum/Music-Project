North winds brought him here
While the devil was laughing
Stealing the wings of the storm only by his own
Carrying the dust of death on his skin
Dust from faraway deserts
Death - burned into his heart
Free and wild, without existing law
What he feel and what he thinks
Known only by the wind

When I'm falling
In my dreams again
When I'm falling
Down on my knees
When I'm falling
And pray to my gods
When I'm falling
I will see your face
When I'm falling
And I pray on the ashes of my gods

Baptized in his own blood
Selling his soul to the night
Holding the reign of the iron cross
Carrying the death's head with wings
The evil look becomes his fist
As a wolf smelling the blood
He was seduced only by hate
Free and wild, without existing law
What he feel and what he thinks
Known only by the wind

When I'm falling
In my dreams again
When I'm falling
Down on my knees
When I'm falling
And pray to my gods
When I'm falling
I will see your face
When I'm falling
And I pray on the ashes of my gods
