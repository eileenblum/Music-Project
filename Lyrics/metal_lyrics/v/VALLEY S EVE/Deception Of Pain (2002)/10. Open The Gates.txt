My sick thoughts are misleading
Into the night
A face in the mirror
And I ask myself who it could be
Deep inside you call for me
Can you feel me in your soul

Open the gates
And see the other side
Open the gates
And look behind the mask
And see your face behind the mask

The knife if your holy friend
An evil your companion
The way we have to pass
Is without return
Deep inside you call for me
Can you feel me in your soul?

Open the gates
And see the other side
Open the gates
And look behind the mask
And see your face behind the mask
