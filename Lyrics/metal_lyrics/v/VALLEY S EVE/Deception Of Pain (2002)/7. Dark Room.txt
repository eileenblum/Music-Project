In the darkness where your soul shivers at night
Together with the dust of time
The lie - your heart desires
Gives you wings
The only one who wants it
To return one day

In a dark room we watch alone
In a world of sin and pain
In a dark room we watch alone
You and I
In a world of sin we die

Gain back everything by force
Give a part of it to me
And think about nothing
The deep fall will be my pain
My past will be my future
I have to leave it behind me
Submerged in time
With the burning fire of yesterday
If the believe will die
You'll be a human - without a heart
Then truth has no sense any longer

In a dark room we watch alone
In a world of sin and pain
In a dark room we watch alone
You and I
In a world of sin we die
