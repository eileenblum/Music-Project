The signs at your arms
Visions of my future
Remembrances of my past again
When he will leave
You have to follow
We are building dark bridges
And find the way to the eternity of death
We're praying to foreign gods
The real evolution has begun
An oath of dark

The fire burns in my eyes
Don't be afraid to enter the night
The fire burns in my eyes
And I will take my last breath

A feeling of deception
Buried deep in your soul
And you'll burn
And find the way to the eternity of death
We're praying to foreign gods
The real evolution has begun

The fire burns in my eyes
Don't be afraid to enter the night
The fire burns in my eyes
And I will take my last breath
