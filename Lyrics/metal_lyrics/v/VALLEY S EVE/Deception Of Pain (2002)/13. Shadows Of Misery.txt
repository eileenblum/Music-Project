[bonus track]

Do not follow the ones who come and destroy
Leaving it to the enemies of humanity
Do not run after someone with blinding promises
They are the wrong leaders
The lustful lies causes the suffer of the world
A new millennium starts
With centuries of terror drowned in blood and hate

Shadows of misery
The demons call my name
Dark shadows killing me
My soul is lost

A creations as spirited as we now are
But the same mistakes - again and again
Somewhere in his dreams will be a way
An escape of my soul - every night
As through the dark seven seas
The time will come

Shadows of misery
The demons call my name
Dark shadows killing me
My soul is lost

Although we are lost in the forest of grief
Try to fight hard to cross the hill of death

Shadows of misery
The demons call my name
Dark shadows killing me
My soul is lost
