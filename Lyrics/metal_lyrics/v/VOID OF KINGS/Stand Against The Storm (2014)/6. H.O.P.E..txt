[Part I]

I will wait and call your name.
And I will say, âIâm here for you.â
Donât walk away.

Love is such a short word,
And it takes a lifetime to live out.
Two hearts entangled, two lives twisted into one:
From the top of a tower, from the mountain side,
Standing as giants we screamed,
âWe are skyscrapers, we are skyscrapers!â
The sun could bleach the sky,
Over fields as orange as embers,
Our smiles white, our eyes bright,
While dancing in these golden dreams.

Put your hand in my hand,
We donât need a reason to watch it burn
Put your hand in my hand, itâs only for a season.
I swear weâll make it.

And the warmth inside could melt the hardened stone,
Cutting off the ties, breaking the chains.
Every word is honey, every thought made of sparks.
Every breath is God, every breath is God!

[Part II]

Love is a four letter word.
And it takes two to fall apart.
Two lives, two separate lives.
Two hearts ravaged. Ravaged.

(What once I thought was honey, left a stinging burn)
Her name inside this heart, her name on everything!
Force the wedge between,
Force contempt down your throat.
Erase the memories with flames.

[Part III]

But what is there to gain from bitterness?
What truth do we uncover when burying each otherâs secrets?
We learn to forgive in the time we dig each otherâs graves,
And standing in the earth, we find we only buried ourselves.

Be brief, bear your scars,
Hold your hand to the wound and find redemption.
Hold (Put your hand in my hand,)
On (Put your hand in my hand,)
Pain (We donât need a reasonâ¦)
Ends! (to watch it burn.)
Hold (Put your hand in my hand,)
On (Put your hand in my hand,)
Pain (Itâs only for a season.)
Ends! (I swear weâll make it.)
Yeah!
