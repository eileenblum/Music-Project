This is the darkest place beneath the brightest light

Shine bright!
A study in contrast: Iâve watched the shadows fall
While beings of light reach to the ends of the universe.

Where there is light there will always be shadow.
Lunar cycles build and collapse,
From new to full and back again.
Nightâs horizon is chased by the edge of day.

One thousand moons will pass, one thousand suns will trace
As the Earth breathes in days.
We too fill our lungs in alternating tides
Like waves that crash and then recede.

Oh distant one, darkened to the bone,
Will you bite the hand that feeds and give up on yourself?
You define your life with every breath you take,
Choosing your steps backwards.

Iâm learning of the brightest light that Iâll ever know.
There is a lantern within my soul:
A fire placed that God ignites and leads me to show,
Lighting the path before me to blaze!

Feel the power of the heartbeat within your veins.
You are still meant to climb the rocks of the shores,
To stand against the storm. Stand against the storm!
Feel the power of the heartbeat within your veins.

One thousand trees will fall, one thousand plants regrow,
An oscillating dance.
Still we fill our hearts in alternating beats,
And in time we learn to change.
We can change.

This is the darkest place beneath the brightest light.
Do you see the light shining? Reach out, ask.
This is the darkest place beneath the brightest light.
