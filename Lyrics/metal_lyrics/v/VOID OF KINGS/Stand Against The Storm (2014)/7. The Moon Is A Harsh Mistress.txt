I dream the most awful of things.
In the morning I wake and my hands are blood red
Because all night Iâve wreaked havoc and death.
Iâve burned down the buildings I have built.
Burned it to the ground. Burned it down!

Alone I manifest the gears that set in motion
The systematic collapse of my sanity.
The clock strikes twelve and dies,
The birds that fly will fall.
Upon this stage Iâll set it straight:
Life and death will tangle.

I am the machine!
While I sleep, I can see what Iâve become.
I am the machine!
My veins are wires, my skin is stretched over steel.

As I stare into the mirror,
With every star ripped from the sky,
No regret, and Iâm forgiving myself for what Iâve done.

My chance to get out of this place has come and gone,
Still Iâm standing here before the cheval glass.
This is empowerment. This is the fuel in my blood.
Feel the gasoline in my blood,
Feel the gasoline burn.

Through every adversity,
I found a way to justify,
Now look into my eyes!

My nightmares will come to an end
As a red sun rises over head.
Sunlight floods my eyes, washes out my skin,
The long shadows shorten, another day begins.

Life is new every single day,
And every nightmare shows the beauty of the dawn,
But even in the darkness of cold and starless nights
The Earth sleeps aside her mistress in the sky.
