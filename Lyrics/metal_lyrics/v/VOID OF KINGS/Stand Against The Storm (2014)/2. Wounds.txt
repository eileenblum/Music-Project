Every morning I look at my reflection
And question who is staring back at me.
Do I choose to be bitter, spiteful,
and quick to make enemies?
All my words are daggers,
My tongue is poisonous.

Always quick to judge and slow with forgiveness,
I keep burning bridges before I finish crossing.
Spiral through the free-fall and pray for solid ground,
Spiral through the free-fall, I canât find solid ground.

Reaching towards the heavens, looking for a hand,
A hand Iâve never seen in this darkness.

Who can pull me from this darkness?
Stop the tide from drowning me, in a sea of my regret.
When all hope is fleeting, the waves carry me to shore
So I can start again.

Fix my eyes on a new horizon,
free myself from the burden of my past
And pretend who I was yesterday is gone.

Each time that I claim that I have been reborn,
The voice inside tells me that I can never change.
All my words will always turn to daggers pinning me to the wall.
Now Iâd die just to feel.

Every emotion Iâve shown has been a clever forgery.
Every memory held regret
And I was dying just to feel something real
Besides the shame of feeling every choice I ever made made hurt you.
If it meant I could feel alive,
I would show the world the truth
And let them take me as I am or cast me aside.
At least Iâd feel alive, (feel alive).
Or cast me aside, (cast me aside).
