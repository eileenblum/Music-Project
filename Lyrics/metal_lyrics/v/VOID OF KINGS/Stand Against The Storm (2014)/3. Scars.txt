Digging deep into identity
We unearth whatâs buried: the purpose in the pain.
So dredge the bay inside of me,
Yeah dredge the bay.
Becoming who Iâm made.
Dredge the bay.

All my scars speak to who I am beneath the skin.
Iâll tear away the mask I wore,
And upon release of the weight of the past, recovery will come.
And every breath I inhale will hold inspiration.

I see beauty in the rain, purpose in the pain.
Taste the infinitely sweet in the bitterness of defeat.
Beauty in the rain, purpose in the pain!

And though our scars remain, there is healing.
This broken heart will mend again with every beating.
The darkness breaking, and now I see how every sunrise is a gift.
The weight of the darkness I used to carry
Lifted like a fog and burned away.
I found the life I thought was dead,
And now Iâm holding tight to this second chance.

I will not give in. This is resilience.
I will not give in, I am resilient.

These scars are not a weakness in the fabric from which I was made.
They are reminders to spur me on,
To climb onward to higher heights.
Here and now, eyes to the sky,
Iâll pray for strength to stand.
And when all hope is fleeting,
These waves still carry me to shore.
And each time I get back up
I shake away the sands of the past.

I no longer doubt, that I am here with purpose.
There is a design behind the chaos.
We are all refined through struggles we endure,
Let us never forget the wounds
So every breath we inhale will hold inspiration.

And though our scars remain, there is healing.
This broken heart will mend again with every beating.
The darkness breaking, and now I see how every sunrise is a gift.
