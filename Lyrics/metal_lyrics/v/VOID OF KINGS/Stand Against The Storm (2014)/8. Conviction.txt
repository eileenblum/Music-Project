Behind every child that grew up to make a difference,
Thereâs a life dedicated to a better world,
To build up the strength, to keep fighting.

I saw the need for every heart to beat,
I saw the need for every heart to bleed,
I saw the need for every heart to bloom.
I saw the need for every heart.

Mine was a story of misplaced hope:
You told me I canât, that I would fail.
Even so Iâve found (without you) I still have a voice.
Can I sayâ¦

This is my time. Iâll step up,
I will not shy away. I will not!

This is for you, oh downtrodden:
Do you have the strength to speak your mind?
Then say it with conviction.

Donât waste a minute holding your breath,
You have the power to change the world.
Find what makes you move, hold it tight.
Say to your brother, âItâs my life!â

And when you speak, speak from the heart!

Say the words, and breathe new life.
Live and let live, love and let love!
