Together with all the souls,
Flowing ever onward,
Into the mouth of darkness,
Charon ferries forth:
Always rowing, always pressing forward.
Currents converge.
Sirens sing over waxed ears.

Give me your siren disease.
I hear you, youâre calling to me.
And I canât get enough.
This ship is sinking at best.
And your throat of rust, I canât get enough.

If ever there was a Hell,
If ever Hades spoke,
Iâd know the place of torment,
His song, his signature.
Crossing the Acheron.
If ever Hades spoke,
Crossing the Acheron.

Poseidon, Earth-Shaker, Storm-Bringer,
Drown your chariot here.

Give me your siren disease.
I hear you, youâre calling to me.
And I canât get enough.
This ship is sinking at best.
And your throat of rust, I canât get enough.

Iâd drink the entire river and name myself Lethe
If I could erase the memory of the day the world fell silent.
