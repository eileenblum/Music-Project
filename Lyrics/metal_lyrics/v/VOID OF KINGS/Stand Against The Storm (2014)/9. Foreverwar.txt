The desire of Man is boundless,
The thirst for destruction, endless.
Break free.

When will we believe weâve dug to the bottom of the barrel?
Weâre scraping the floor. There is no more to excavate.

We all fight for control.
Hand over hand, fist over fist.
We all fight for control.

Donât wait. This breath is broken at best. I know you.
Iâll take whatever you give. This want, we fail to save this.
I know you, I know you.

Weâve turned to industry and the thought of progress,
Forsaking the natural world, as though silicone and electricity
Could somehow replace the sanctity of this place.

Frack the shale, poison the wells,
Gut the mountains, and scar the face of the Earth.
Weâre destroying the ground on which we stand.

And if there is a soul tied to the heart of Man,
Would you not want to live to understand?
Break free.

Is this war all weâre fighting for?
Could we fight for something more?
Educate the ignorant, returning hate with grace.
We could transcend this place where
We all fight for control.
We all fight for control.

Donât wait. This breath is broken at best. I know you.
Iâll take whatever you give. This want, we fail to save this.
I know you, I know you.

What have you gained? Was it worth it?

We all fight for something.
We all fight.
