The air weighs heavily on my back and sits as stone on my shoulders. I wake face down on the ground with the smoky taste of burned soil. I open my eyes to a charred landscape of trees and homes scorched to black, of hills of dark and smoldering ash, to towering stacks of
skulls. Death blankets the whole earth like a dust that spreads its wings and settles on everything. The smoke trails on for miles. We fight just to breathe. I am the serotinous seed. Amidst the black I bloom, birthed of blood and fire, built to prosper in the black. I
am serotinous, built to defy the hand of death. The white sun is smeared behind a charcoal sky, the bullets of light pierce through the inky clouds. Blessed with the strength of life, blessed with a life in death. I was made to take the hard road, blessed with a curse.
Bring your fire here, call me to rise, and I will reach the heavens. I am the serotinous seed! Raise the siege, raise the flags. Raise the siege, âCry âhavoc!â and let slip the dogs of war!â
