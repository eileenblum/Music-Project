Every morning I look at my reflection and question who is staring back at me. Do I choose to be bitter, spiteful, and quick to make enemies? All my words are daggers, my tongue is poisonous. Always quick to judge and slow with forgiveness, I keep burning bridges before I
finish crossing. Spiral through the free-fall and pray for solid ground, spiral through the free-fall, I canât find solid ground. Reaching towards the heavens, looking for a hand, a hand Iâve never seen in this darkness. Who can pull me from this darkness? Stop the tide
from drowning me, in a sea of my regret. When all hope is fleeting, the waves carry me to shore so I can start again. Fix my eyes on a new horizon, free myself from the burden of my past and pretend who I was yesterday is gone. Each time that I claim that Iâve been
reborn, the voice inside tells me that I can never change. All my words will always turn to daggers pinning me to the wall. Now Iâd die just to feel. Every emotion I showed has been a clever forgery. Every memory held regret and I was dying just to feel something real
besides the shame of feeling every choice I made hurt you. If it meant I could feel alive, I would show the world the truth and let them take me as I am or cast me aside. At least Iâd feel alive. Feel alive, or cast me aside, cast me aside.
