I never cut you down, never broke your knees. Everything is inspiration, except the words you speak. Kick me when Iâm down, pack the wound with salt. You can break my skin but I would never let you crush my ambitions! Dear doubter, yeah naysayer, I am no soothsayer, but
my will is strong and I will lead this one. There is a difference between us: the rationalist versus the dreamer. This is Morpheus bound by Socrates, the thought of flight layered deep in crude oil. Wave your colors, dig your feet in, show me your teeth, and weâll
prepare for war! Tribes of the world clash. We bury the skulls within the earth, hide the bones beneath, beneath our ancestors, and pretend we can hide our guilt below our apathy. Bleach the flag, bleach the flag. The earth will bleed its colors, the eyes will be bled of
tears, the rivers will run dry. Our flags will be white. There will be peace. Our flags will be white. War has no winner. Put down your gun, rip out your teeth.
