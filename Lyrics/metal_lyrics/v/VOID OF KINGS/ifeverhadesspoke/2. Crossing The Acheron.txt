Together with all the souls, flowing ever onward, into the mouth of darkness, Charon ferries forth: always rowing, always pressing forward. Sirens sing over waxed ears, but Iâm tied to the mast and sleeping. Currents converge. Iâd drink the entire river and name myself
Lethe if I could erase the memory of the day the world fell silent. If ever there was a Hell, if ever Hades spoke, Iâd know the place of torment, his song, his signature. Crossing the Acheron, crossing the Acheron! Poseidon, Earth-Shaker, Storm-Bringer, drive your
chariot here, drown your chariot here.
