I dream the most awful of things. In the morning I wake and my hands are blood red âcause all night Iâve wreaked havoc and death. Iâve burned down the buildings I have built. Burned it to the ground. Burned it down! Alone I manifest the gears that set in motion the
systematic collapse of my sanity. The clock strikes twelve and dies, the birds that fly will fall. Upon this stage Iâll set it straight: life and death will tangle. I am the machine! While I sleep, I can see what Iâve become. I am the machine! My veins are wires, my skin
is stretched over steel. As I stare into the mirror, with every star ripped from the sky, no regret, and Iâm forgiving myself for what Iâve done. My chance to get out of this place has come and gone, still Iâm standing here before the cheval glass. This is empowerment.
This is the fuel in my blood. I feel this gasoline in my blood, feel the gasoline burn. Through every adversity, I found a way to justify, now look into my eyes! My nightmares will come to an end as a red sun rises over head. Sunlight floods my eyes, washes out my skin,
the long shadows shorten, another day begins. As I stare into the mirror, with every star ripped from the sky, no regret, and Iâm forgiving myself for what Iâve done. Life is new every single day, and every nightmare shows the beauty of the dawn, but even in the darkness
of cold and starless nights the Earth sleeps aside her mistress in the sky.
