This time I offer it all for this. This time I lay myself on the line. Youâve got to know Iâd throw myself in, whole heart and whole mind. Push everything else aside, pull my next step over my eyes. Bring the future upon myself, smash it over my head. And I never thought
a night this simple could freeze the hands of time. Youâre the only one who can make time stop. So breathe, just breathe, and feel the air that fills the lungs. Cease the thought, just to be. This is the moment Iâd always longed for. Here we are, face to face. This is
now. I am here and this is now. The power and the glory are yours to take! I now can comprehend the depths that I withheld. My deepest sympathies for ever pushing you away, but from here we move, we continue forward. This is not the end, this is the beginning. As the
future comes like a freight train barreling down the dark tunnel, I see there is no escape hatch. Thereâs no way out, I canât turn back, and this time itâs okay. This time I amâ¦ this time finally, I am not unnerved. This is learning to hold your breath, this is learning
to swim in a hurricane. This is royalty draped in rags, draped in the rags of peasants.
