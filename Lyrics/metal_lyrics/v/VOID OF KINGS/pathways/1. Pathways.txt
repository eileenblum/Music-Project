You can be the candle clearing the spiders from the tomb, showing the faces of the dead to dying men in their graves. You can be the shovel digging deep into this cavern, offering a journey down, six feet under ground. Or, on the other hand, you can be the lightning, an
electric thread of light showing the path between the heavens and this hell. Youâll cut the darkness in two and send it to the corners of Earth. Youâll shoot through the storms, with sights set far and wide. The choice is yours: where will you be? The choice is yours, we
are that free. This is your life, you get one shot, what will you do with the time youâve got? If youâve got hope in the palm of your hand, if youâve got love inside a beating heart, if youâve got faith or a soul renewed, never let it go, never let go. You can be the
lighthouse, the ever-present searchlight spinning, built on firm foundations, never giving up that spark. Youâll call the sick to land and bring the wayward back to home, calling them away from the tempest and leading the weary men ashore. Pointing life to death, or
pointing death to life, I know what I would choose. Res ipsa loquitur. Your legacy is yours alone to leave. Yours alone to leave! The choice is yours: where will you be? The choice is yours, we are that free.
