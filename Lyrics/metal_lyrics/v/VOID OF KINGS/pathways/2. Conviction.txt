Behind every child that grew up to make a difference, thereâs a life dedicated to a better world, to build up the strength, to keep fighting. I saw the need for every heart to beat, I saw the need for every heart to bleed, I saw the need for every heart to bloom. I saw
the need for every heart. Mine was a story of misplaced hope: you told me I canât, that I would fail. Even so Iâve found (without you) I still have a voice. Can I sayâ¦ This is my time. Iâll step up, I will not shy away. I will not! This is for you, oh downtrodden: Do you
have the strength to speak your mind? Then say it with conviction. Donât waste a minute holding your breath, you have the power to change the world. Remember when you speak all your words will affect the world, so speak from the heart. When you speak, speak from the
heart! Live and let live, love and let love!
