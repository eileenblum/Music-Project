I found the restrained Loveless in denial Loveless in a child Met the anger 
child I found the suppressed Lifeless and in its raw Lifeless in a rest 
Faceless I, week and controlled Faceless in a role Faceless in the young met 
the anger one I, rich and fulfilled Look at my allied Look at what I killed 
Cold face love... fading I saw you... dying To the sound of the alarm Murky 
consignment in its cradle And I wish for retribution Me against you all I, 
strange and explained Saw you as a god Saw you as the one Lived to be the 
one Strong is the mind Strengthened by the time Broken to the core Cold face 
love... fading I saw you... dying to the sound of the alarm Murky consignment in 
its cradle And I wish for retribution Me against you all To the sound of her 
death Murky consignment in its waiting And I wish for retribution Me against 
you all A comprehensive challenge But careful now, careful A suitable cheap 
experience But careful, careful now The death of the mother should end this, 
I know But clearly flesh and blood binds me, binds me I'm running for 
clearance to kill you again Mother, face me Take me home A comprehensive 
challenge But careful now, careful A coming home experience But careful, 
careful now I found the restrained Loveless in denial Loveless in a child 
Met the anger child I found the suppressed Lifeless and in its raw Lifeless 
in a rest Cold face love... fading I saw you... dying to the sound of the alarm 
Murky consignment in its cradle And I wish for retribution Me against you 
all To the sound of her death Murky consignment in its waitingAnd I wish for 
retribution Me against you all
