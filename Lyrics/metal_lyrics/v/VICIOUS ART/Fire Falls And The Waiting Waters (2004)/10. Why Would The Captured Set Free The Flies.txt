Right! This sets the story straight Unleashed obsession collisions and 
violence It's all been damaged a true disgrace Unlawful clearance and light 
Winter falls summer rise oppressed by the season All emotions die See the 
connection winter rise So why would the captured set free the flies? Come 
on! Really loud this is the storm progressing Ceasarism installing its skin 
Within the power of this malicious force Is born a landmark callings rise 
Winter falls summer rise oppressed by the season All emotions die See the 
connection winter rise So why would the captured set free the flies? A 
serpent approaches oh precious sight The one with the carvings no longer 
hides Scriptures are forming and breaking ground Breeding a nation Oh 
precious sight Behold the new machinery It takes a lifetime to enter or 
leave Open the prey there is relief inside It is delivered an paid for 
Winter falls summer rise oppressed by the season All emotions die See the 
connection winter rise So why would the captured set free the flies?
