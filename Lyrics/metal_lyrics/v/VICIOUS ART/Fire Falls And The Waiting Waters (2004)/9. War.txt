This ain't binding This ain't binding at all This is a war what she wants 
Reflecting her sorrow to herself War This is control The truth is won in 
battles Personal hell She needs a white flag in her death Woman be still And 
though my efforts are sincere Still Makes her turn away This ain't binding 
This ain't binding at all What is the cost What is the loss Our loved ones 
getting closer I disappear Anger You're in control I too have needs She 
said, she said She needs a white flag in her death Woman be still And though 
my efforts are sincere Still Makes her turn away War, the closure of this 
chapter ends in a war, the strength in her defences ends in a war, her 
weapons of destruction ends in a war, our closest never joins us into the 
lies, how deceitful and demanding aren't the lies, how destructive and 
illusive aren't the lies, how tormenting and displeasing aren't the lies But 
it's my way... This is a war No one can win The closest to perfection I've 
been War Show me your scars And I too can resign Give me your scars She 
needs a white flag in her death Woman be still And though my efforts are 
sincere Still Makes her turn away This ain't binding This ain't binding at 
all
