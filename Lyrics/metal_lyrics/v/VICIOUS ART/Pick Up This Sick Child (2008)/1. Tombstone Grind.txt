Once again I slip in her swallowed blood
I'm feeding not eating
Without common sense in her swallowed blood
I'm walking on air
To feel somewhat calm in her godless shrine
This grave less entrapment
I bow down to what she calls tombstone grind

Lack of faith lack no more
Tombstone faith tombstone whore
I should have cried the tombstone war
Brimstone tears I'm a tombstone whore

Pinching out the scare in my reckless arm
I break out the circles
Out of being dead there will come no harm
I break out the pain
Out of being lost in her cold embrace
I welcome my hunger
Once again the tears in her stone cold face

Lack of faith lack no more
Tombstone faith tombstone whore
I should have cried the tombstone war
Brimstone tears I'm a tombstone whore

I paid good money for this the carvings are done
Will she accept my affection
Now that I'm done

Dancing to the warmth of her inscription
I lick her epitaph as I start to fall
I should have cried the tombstone war
Brimstone tears I'm a tombstone whore
