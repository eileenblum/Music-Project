They made a divorce a brothel of crying
They copied my frame and bent down for years
But I painted the roses followers copycats
I painted the roses she's coming to me

They filed a complaint charlatans pharisees
This is an infringement I knelt down for years
I wrote her the poems stealing it's stealing
I wrote her the poems she's coming to me

Complete travesty hurts
Sometimes to you I advert
That I know the chorus was sung too loud

Who told her to sing my words with my words
Who told her to sing with heaven inside
I gave her the shine in shadows while hiding
I gave her the shine her talent and pride

Complete travesty hurts
Sometimes to you I advert
That I know the chorus was sung too loud

Should be what I allow
Something is better off silent
Cause I know the chorus was sung to loud

This consignment with life in its text
This consignment will ship empty from my heart
I will keep this contempt for their words
It will keep me alive burning through the years

This long buried lie a brothel of crying
This long buried text cracks in its raw
I wrote you the poems stealing they stole me
I painted your roses you're coming to me

Complete travesty hurts
Sometimes to you I advert
That I know the chorus was sung too loud
Should be what I allow
Something is better off silent
Cause I know the chorus was sung to loud
