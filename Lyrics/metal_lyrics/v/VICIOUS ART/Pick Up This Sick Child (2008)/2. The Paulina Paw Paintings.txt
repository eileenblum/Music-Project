I comb I comb I comb my lover clean
And I'm chewing and I'm breeding
Scorn the scorn the scorn is for my sins
And I'm fighting and I'm twisting
Cold the cold the coldness in my steel
And I'm cutting and I'm kissing
God the god the god is for you filth
And you're filthy

Confirm my inner sketch
This one is for your art
I love my precious guilt

Come on come on come on I want to go
And I'm slitting and I'm cutting
You in you in you I want to die
And I'm dying

Confirm my inner sketch
This one is for your art
I love my precious guilt

Pauline I'll fade the paw
Your brush is far too raw
Your pen destroys its light
It's you that I must fight

The scar the scar the scar is yet to dry
This last model for my distant
Face my face my face is in your hands
With my turnings and it's breaking
You in you in you I gonna die
I felt better but I'm kissing
God your god your god is from my face
In my distant in my distant you...

Confirm my inner sketch
This one is for your art
I love my precious guilt

Pauline I'll fade the paw
Your brush is far too raw
Your pen destroys its light
It's you that I must fight

She painted a paw I expected a claw
This dream will bring the colours back

Confirm my inner sketch
This one is for your art
I love my precious guilt

Pauline I'll fade the paw
Your brush is far too raw
Your pen destroys its light
It's you that I must fight
