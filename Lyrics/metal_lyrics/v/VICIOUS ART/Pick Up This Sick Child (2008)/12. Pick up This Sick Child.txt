[Bonus Track]

In this flesh delirium in this lack of love you just have to reap the forbidden sights so can we keep it

Breathing death acid skin nails like razors this morbid grin concrete fists severed limbs but can we keep it

Can we keep it as a child monstrosity monstrosity child monstrosity now this is nature gone wild pick up the

Sick child with the scars of empty lust and this unknown strength we have to adore this forbidden pain but

Can we keep it without skin broken bones to its maker the mortal moans morbid sight monster child but can we

Keep it can we keep it as a child monstrosity monstrosity child monstrosity now this is nature gone wild

Pick up the sick child it will live it will live it will live and we will keep it as a child monstrosity

Monstrosity child monstrosity now this is nature gone wild pick up the sick child child child
