I got to know
This dirty face you had to show
This dirty face you had to kill
Opened the past for the carnal lust
The solid goal of equalling
Our severed you how did you do

I I can't believe
Love we both agree
You this time it's a one
Sickening love you
I can't resist
Kill this dying fist me
I'm living a dream
We're both into killing me

I got to know
This pretty place you had to show
These pretty thoughts I'm wearing out
They occupy this residence
This house of mine I call defence
I call it you how did you do

I I can't believe
Love we both agree
You this time it's a one
Sickening love you
I can't resist
Kill this dying fist me
I'm living a dream
We're both into killing me

When is the time for winning all
To be ahead of killing time
When is the time for suffering
For racing hard against our will
With winning lust and severed ties

I I can't believe
Love we both agree
You this time it's a one
Sickening love you
I can't resist
Kill this dying fist me
I'm living a dream
I I can't believe
Love we both agree
You this time it's a one
Sickening love you
I can't resist
Kill this dying fist me
I'm living a dream
We're both into killing me
