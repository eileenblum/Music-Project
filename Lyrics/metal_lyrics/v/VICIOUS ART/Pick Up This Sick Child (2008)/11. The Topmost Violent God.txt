Pauline when compared to my mind
You're a sun calm dead wishes so empty
Your colourful most powerful lie
I stab you down to the lie core
With my books inside of the lie core
Then stab your face I stab your face

Your face this beautiful look I trace
Calm dead wishes so empty
Your powerful most colourful smile
I need to carve on the inside
Make a gap all clean on the inside
Then stab your face I stab your face

We are one of a kind
Our killings are justified
He's getting aroused
Our topmost violent god

Your Pauline eyes
That could have been free from lies
Calm dead wishes so empty
Your beautiful most beautiful eyes
I carve them out of the blind
Make a gap heal clean in the blind
Then stab your face I'll stab your face

We are one of a kind
Our killings are justified
He's getting aroused
Our topmost violent god
We're perversions and pain
Lost through the scars
Again and again
Our topmost violent god

Frozen explosions in timelines of dirt
Cutting apart prosperous birth
Cutting again the cult is alive
My saviour the cult is alive

We are one of a kind
Our killings are justified
He's getting aroused
Our topmost violent god
We are one of a kind
Our killings are justified
He's getting aroused
Our topmost violent god
We're perversions and pain
Lost through the scars
Again and again
Our topmost violent god
