Night you call upon light
Light you call upon life
Life you fall apart
Child death in this heart night

One star falling away from all that is
This wonderful place of giving
Built upon lies
Chain hooks falling
Your own reason to fall
Scarlet grace upbringing
Your bell whistles in the dark

Truthful vicious son your star finds no angel
Call upon their faith you shall fall no more

Mighty one you stay forlorn
Starborn angel
Mighty one you stay forlorn
Starborn angel
Gone your faith restore
Mighty angel
Divine go forth restore
Mighty angel

Truthful vicious son
Your star finds no angel
Call upon their faith
You shall fall no more
