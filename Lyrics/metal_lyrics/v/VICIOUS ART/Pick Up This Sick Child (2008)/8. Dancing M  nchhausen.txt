Mother is here
I want you sick by noon
Sweet child of mine

Obsessed by more
It gave you a picture
That was made of blood

You can fake this you can fake it all
I can feed you we can change your fall

Mother is here

Palest sister diagnosed

Not changing course
Policed by my presence
You can make me proud
This is my proof see
Now go with god
 you must take this make your mother strong
You can fake this we shall right the wrongs

Mother is here
Know that you're not alone
Mother is here
I want you sick by noon

You must fake this you can fake it all
I can feed you we can change your fall

Mother is here
I want you sick by noon
Sweet child of mine
I want you sick by noon
Mother is here
Know that you're not alone
Mother is here
I want you sick by noon
