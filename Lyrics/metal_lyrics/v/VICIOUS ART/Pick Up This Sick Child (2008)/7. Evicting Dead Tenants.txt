This lodger has something
Something I can take
I gave you my best
Room gave you my best
Care gave you my best time
I made you a small
World made you a small
Dream made you a whole life

Is this satisfying
Is this what you want

I rented you you are rented
Tenant my love time to pay
Get rid of your grump face
It's my room
I rented you you are rented
Pleasures unknown pleasures

I will give you my best
Filth give you my best hate give you my best flesh
This is your one of a kind
Cut your one of a kind
Wound your one of a kind scream

Is this satisfying
Is this what you want

I call you dead called you to die
Tenant my love time to play
Get rid of your crying
It's my world
I call you dead called you to die
Pleasures unknown pleasures

This lodger has something I can take

Is this satisfying
Is this what you want
Is this satisfying
Is this what you want

I call you dead called you to die
Tenant my love time to play
Get rid of your crying it's my world
I call you dead called you to die
Pleasures unknown pleasures
