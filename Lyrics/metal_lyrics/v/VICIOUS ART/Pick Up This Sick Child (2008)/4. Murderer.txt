Fever a promise was made
But the depth of our hunger
Can lead us astray

I heard a storm was rising
I came to taste the seed
The taste of the sun
That burns everyone

Favours a promise was made
But this gathered up pleasure
Will lead us astray

I shiver in temptation
The dormant moves are gone
Aroused as I break
The wild empty fun

What do you want this to be
I am closing this chapter
This level is free
And the stars are aligned
Your feelings are lust
I should have known
Then she said murder murder

Pavement it is written in stone
We begin with the curtains
The curtains alone
The carvings alone are done
We'll tie up the bounds
Strong is the text
Vicious and profound

I came to read the writings
The vicious and profound
Your plan is at stake
The wild and empty fun

What is the use of this lie
Away from the shadows
We're racing the tide
And I gave her the dirt
She wanted so bad
Perfection bait
Then she said murder murderer

I search no remedy
This one's alone
Full size rivalry
This one's alone

I search no remedy
This one's alone
Full size dying
This one's alone

I heard a storm was rising
I came to taste the seed
The taste of the sun
Will bring fallings

What do you want this to be
I am closing this chapter
This level is free
And the stars are aligned
Your feelings are lust
I should have known
But she said
Murder murder murders murders murderer murderer
