What star could I choose to light up her smile
Broken and all in tears she's a goddess divine
What pace is the right one for intentions like these
For the great celebration of her shuddering needs

To cherish the weight of family flesh
To give to the night our family flesh
Broken and all sincere she's a waitress in black
Broken and all in tears she's a waitress in black

It was a secret I told you a secret
You said I was safe you made me feel safe
It's easy to pluck out my pain
You said I could trust you you screamed I could touch you
Weeping your beauty it's easy to take you again
It's time for regret for you to regret

What pain could I choose to stake out her a path
She's lingering lust for life in her dormant wrath
What wounds will affect her reptilian mind
Cause I want her to stay as a goddess divine

I want her to stay as family flesh
To give to the night our family flesh
Broken and all sincere she's the key to my scars
Broken and all in tears she's the key to my scars

It's easy to pluck out my pain
You said I could trust you, you screamed I could touch you
Weeping your beauty it's easy to take you again
It's time for regret for you to regret

Oh what is this feeling I can take something out of him
My own comedy a play my own variety show
My father uses porn with a gun in his hand
I try to catch his desire
I know I can learn this I'm just a child
To light to light his fire
With the patience of a stone
I bide my time
To get my loved ones to serve as I did
Father how

It was a secret I told you a secret
You said I was safe you made me feel safe
It's easy to pluck out my pain
You said I could trust you you screamed I could touch you
Weeping your beauty it's easy to take you again
It's time for regret for you to regret
Our family flesh
