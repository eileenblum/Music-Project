Riding on the back of a demon,
With desecrating hooves of destruction and pain
A storm of demonic lust and chaos
Wings' tearing shreds in the brightness of day

A journey across the eastern, infernal fields
Laughing at their pathetic cries of agony
Aviating above humans in life's decay
Mocking their joy and belief in god

Weep for me, your fear is my strength

I am your plague, I am your reaper
Riding with the forces of darkness
Pray for Death, your soul is mine
In my domain Hell is mercy

Riding on the back of a demon,
With desecrating hooves of destruction and pain
A storm of demonic lust and chaos
Wings' tearing shreds in the brightness of day

So were is your "god" now?
Hiding from this merciless attack, hah?
Well, I bear the torch
And heaven and earth shall burn

My soft side is known as Satan,
And my command comes with the storm

Your crosses wont hurt me, neither your priest
I'll skin him alive and rip out his heart
We'll feast on your flesh, we'll swallow your soul
Go mess with the dark side, and dig your own grave

I am your Lord, I am your Vulture
Riding with the forces of darkness
Pray for Death your soul is mine
In my domain Hell is mercy

Riding the demon!

Crystal night - massacre
Riot and rape - bloodshed
Nuclear war - elimination
End of time - darkness
