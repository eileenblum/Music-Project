Seek the house of "god" in the middle of the night
So it is written, so it shall be done
With petrol and a light you'll set it alight
So it is written, so it shall be done

Go across the graveyard, amongst the stones
So it is written, so it shall be done
Crush the tombstones, turn the crosses upside down
So it is written, so it shall be done

Head for the vicarage, break into the house
So it is written, so it shall be done
Rape his daughters, rape his wife
So it is written, so it shall be done

Behead the vicar, and burn his skull
So it is written, so it shall be done
Rape his daughters, rape his wife AGAIN!
So it is written, so it shall be done

Kill them all and burn the house down
So it is written, so it shall be done

Seek another church in the middle of the night
So it is written, so it shall be done
With petrol and a light you'll set it alight
So it is written, so it shall be done
