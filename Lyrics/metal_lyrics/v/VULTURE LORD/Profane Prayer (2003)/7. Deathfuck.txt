Roaming the streets at night, alone?
You little pretty thing, such a beast, a real fuck-machine,
When you want it, you want fast hard and mean
Well, here I am, the man of your dreams,
Cause I'm a killer, the best you've ever seen, bitch

You thought you were gonna get it the usual way,
You laughed when I tied you down
A little exciting perhaps? Just a bit dangerous?
Tell you what, you wont be laughing now

Deathfuck, I wanna hear you scream
Deathfuck, I wanna watch you bleed
My metal hard-on tears you deep inside
Deathfuck, this is how it feels to die

Blindfolded and body in a stretch
You're so nice to touch,
My metal hard-on gleam, a violent fiend
Quit your whining, we're about to begin
Oh, I can't wait to slide it in
I hereby dub thee pain, and pain is a mortal sin

You thought you were gonna get it the usual way,
You trembled when I put it in
A little painful perhaps? Just a bit different somehow?
Tell you what, you're gonna get it now!

Deathfuck, I wanna hear you scream
Deathfuck, I wanna watch you bleed
My metal hard-on tears you deep inside
Deathfuck, this is how it feels to die
