Searching for victims in the blackest night
Hunting them down like a beast from the dark
Howl like a wolf which warns its prey
A terrible warning which the christians obey

Christian dirt, be aware,
Our bloodlusting souls will hunt you down
Obey, or with your life you will pay

On your knees you will crawl, begging for mercy
Begging to escape the torment of Hell
Our black, pounding hearts will of course let you down
We'll torture your body until you betray your own god

And when you've betrayed him
We'll stab you with our swords of victory
Yeah, we'll stab you and stab you and stab you again

Searching for victims in the blackest night
Hunting them down like a beast from the dark
Howl like a wolf which warns its prey
A terrible warning which the christians obey

Christian dirt, be aware,
Our bloodlusting souls will hunt you down
Obey, or with your life you will pay
