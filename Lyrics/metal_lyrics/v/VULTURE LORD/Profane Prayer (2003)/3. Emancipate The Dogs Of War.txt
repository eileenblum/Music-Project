Emancipate the unholy dogs of war
From the chains of weak, religious laws
Deny the cross and all its kind
And march to war with no remorse

The time has come to take a stand
Prepare to kill all that's in our way
Noone is innocent, they all must die
Let the Anti-christ within your hearts

Merciless left against the right hand path
An earthly Armageddon shall slay the world
A civil war where the weaklings fall
Monuments of flesh, the sign of our victory

Kneel, christian, your cause is lost
You shall burn in the house of god
Crawl, muslim, your end is near
You shall die in your "holy war"
Hail, brothers, the world is yours
Rule as one beneath the horns
Rise, sisters, the work is done
Secure the race of Satan
