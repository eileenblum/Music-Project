[CD Bonus Track]Trapped inside this jungle
A Hell in glass, concrete and steel
A scream subdued
My sanity consumed

It roars like fire
A sick desire
That rages higher
And the screams it grows
My heart breaks like glass
My concrete soul explodes
With fangs and claws of steel
I am gone!

Oh, the jackal am I
Stalking victims, peering through the vicious wolf's eye
A bird of prey, I wait to drop from the sky
I'll eat you alive
Consummate killer

The streets are drenched with blood
The ravaged torsos left behind....your future
This is my territory
And you're the inventory

It roars like fire
A sick desire
That rages higher
And the screams it grows
My heart breaks like glass
My concrete soul explodes
With fangs and claws of steel
I'm reborn!

Oh, the jackal am I
Stalking victims, peering through the vicious wolf's eye
A bird of prey, I wait to drop from the sky
I'll eat you alive
Consummate killer

I am the liar in wait
A brutal force that feeds upon hate
My grizzly vice will be your unmercyful fate
I stand unburdened by time
Your Death is never too late....for Me!

I am gone.....I'm reborn
Consummate killer
I am gone.....I'm reborn
Consummate killer
Consummate killer
Consummate killer
Killer....Killer....Killer....Killer!
