I bear the mark of the Beast upon my winterpale skin
I cast my spells of evil when the moon is full and high
I am the mistress of darkness, fornicator of the light
I have sworn the Devilss oath, bound myself to be free

See me ride the black sky on my way to the sabbath
Our coven is gathered for another sinful night
See us dance naked beneath the diabolical moon
Summoning the dark forces unknown to mankind

We will raise the dead to do as we please
Annex them to the orgy with the Fallen One
Eve of profanation, black magic night

Seek me, Witchfinder General,
Burn me at the stake
Take me, Witchfinder General,
Wrap me in purgatory flames
Free me, Witchfinder General,
Burn me at the stake
Donate Him yet another gift,
Send my soul to Hell
