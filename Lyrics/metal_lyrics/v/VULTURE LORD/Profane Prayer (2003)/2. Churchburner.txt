The moon is lit, it's time to rise
The gathering darkness is killing light
The sheep's asleep, it's time to rise
Wake up and face the night

They're the dogs of war,
let loose upon their "god"
and their dying religion
Burning it down to the ground

Flames enlighten up the sky
God's house shall fry
Turn the holy into ashes
Assaulting the Christian masses

Churchburner, a soldier of Hell
Churchburner, Satan's child
Churchburner, tolling Death's bell
Churchburner of Satanic pride

They're the dogs of war,
let loose upon their "god"
and their dying religion
Burning it down to the ground

The moon is lit, it's time to rise
The gathering darkness is killing light
The sheep's asleep, it's time to rise
Wake up and start the fight
