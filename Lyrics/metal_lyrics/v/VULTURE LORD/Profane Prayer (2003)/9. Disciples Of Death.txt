Flames are ravishing the earth,
As demons are conquering the sun
Abyssic armies slays the angel horde
Evil feast upon the lamb

Disciple
Disciple of death
Charge!

I am the fire in the eyes of demons,
Reared by the wrath of the elder gods
I am the heir of their wisdom and might
I am the usurper, I shall never fall

Disciple
Disciple of death
Disciple
Death's disciple

Show no mercy!

Abuser, seducer of the succubus
Succumb to my unearthly grimness
Kiss my feet, as I step on your "honor"
Await mine arrival, perpetual sunset

I am the cure of old age!

My words are thunder, my love is frost
My caress is disaster, havoc and death
I slay all civilians, both women and children
Let the soldiers live, just to watch them kill each other

No law in battle, no beauty in life
Killing for the pleasures of remorseless murder
So, die bastard, and die "friend"
I shall live to bring the earth to it's end

[music by Ravenloft '98, lyrics by Northgrove '98]
