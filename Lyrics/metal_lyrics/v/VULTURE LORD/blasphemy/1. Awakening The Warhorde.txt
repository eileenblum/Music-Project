Where were you in â92? 
When thoughts became action 
Christ was fought with fire 
Where were you in â94? 
Squealing like a pig 
When they knocked at your door 
Where were you in â96? 
Entering a new scene 
Unaffected by the past 
Where were you in â98? 
Living the lies 
That we once used to hate 

The millenniums should be ours 
United militia beneath the surface 
Ready to strike our feeble foes 
With determination, force and wrath 

Individual thoughts upon a strong foundation 
Would secure the existence of a global (underground) movement 
Where extremity and hate is the essence 
Where all weak links are mercilessly removed 

So, where were you in â92? 
When thoughts became action 
Christ was fought with fire 
Where were you in â94? 
Squealing like a pig 
When they knocked at your door 
Where were you in â96? 
Entering a new scene 
Unaffected by the past 
Where were you in â98? 
Living the lies 
That we once used to hate
