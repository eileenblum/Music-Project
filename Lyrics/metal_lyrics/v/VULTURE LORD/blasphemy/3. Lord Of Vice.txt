[originally by Deliverance]From the depths, you feel my touch 
Look into my eyes 
I am Pan, I am Satan 
Lord of all vice, Antichrist 

Know my mercy, hear my laugh 
See your world, before the storm 

I am Pan, I am Satan 
Lord of all vice, Antichrist 

Drink my blood, eat my flesh 
Feel my pain, my little child 
In the past, where heroes died 
Before my throne, to await the day 
Now your souls, belong to me 
No time for sorrow, no place to flee 

Give to me, the mark of fealty 
Free to ravage, yours the choice 

I am Pan, I am Satan 
Lord of all vice, Antichrist 
Antichrist, Antichrist
