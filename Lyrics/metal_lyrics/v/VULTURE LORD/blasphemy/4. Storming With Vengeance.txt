We await the night in the shadows of (the) day 
Waiting for the sign to rise upon the sky 
Riding on out metalclad machines 
Defend yourself, or you shall surely die 
So grab your crosses as we run you over 
Burn your towns and desecrate your kin 
Hide your daughters, or they shall get it 
Your god is fading in our pagan pride 

Christianized by swords, 
Dechristianized by machinegun fire 
1000 years slumbering, for once again to rise 
No compromise, now that our forces unite 

Heaven sinks in their tears for the damned 
The holy chose drowns in their pity for man 
The trinity gasp for their final breath, 
While mortals still (are) fighting like jackals âtil death 

White, wurstbrot soldiers 
With black pounding hearts 
Are storming with vengeance 
Blood, fucking vengeance!
