Take this life.

One by one
You march away like a fucking cult
Like a false religion serving for the weakest one.
Give it up
Why stand if you stand for no one
You will get, what you give

Why stand if you stand for no one [2x]

Take this life
I'd sacrifice, everything for a moment of truth.
No light, no air, no freedom
Nothing but the memory crawling behind my mind.
If I could rewind and take it all back, I would.
Just to watch you burn,

Alive.
I'll show you what it's like
To be on the other side.
Ear to ear
I'd rip your fucking face apart.

Take this life.

Take this life
I'd sacrifice, everything for a moment of truth.
No light, no air, no freedom
Nothing but the memory crawling behind my mind.
If I could rewind and take it all back, I would.
Just to watch you
burn
