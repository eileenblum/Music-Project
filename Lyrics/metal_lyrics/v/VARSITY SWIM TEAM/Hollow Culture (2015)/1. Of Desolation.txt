I see humans
But no humanity
Soulless creations, nameless machine. Causing destruction amongst its own. Regretting the days we've slaved.
Ears wide open
Eyes sealed shut
A civilization demolished by its own trust. Straying from the path that leads into the light, following the darkness leading us to

Ruination,
it's left us six feet deep alive
Ruination
This is ruin

Art of deception
days of desolation
This is ruin
The master work of a civilization

Ruination
Art of deception
Days of desolation
The master work of a civilization

The master work of a civilization
Side by side, feeding fire with fire
Such a pointless way of life.
Perfection, Straight to abomination

The art of deception
The art of desolation [2x]

Ruination
This is ruin
Art of deception
days of desolation
The master work of a civilization
