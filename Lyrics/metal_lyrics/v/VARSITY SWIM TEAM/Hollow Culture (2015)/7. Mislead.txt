we are all slaves to serve for injustice
We slowly forget everything we could be.
A million voices scream, yet everyone ignored.
Controlled by mindless leaders
shutting down the world.

How does it feel?
We've been misled
We've been controlled
How does it feel?
Laying in the ruins

When everything goes wrong,
Will you act so strong?
Or will you bow to your knees?
Burn down the ones who ran us straight to the ground and left us begging for mercy.
When everything goes wrong,
Will you act so strong?
Or will you bow to your knees?
Burn down the ones who ran us straight to the ground and left us begging

Swallow the pride that keeps you standing.

open your eyes,
We're faceless puppets.
Reborn reprogrammed to deceive.
Fear.

When everything goes wrong,
Will you act so strong?
Or will you bow to your knees?
Burn down the ones who ran us straight to the ground and left us begging for mercy.
When everything goes wrong,
Will you act so strong?
Or will you bow to your knees?
Burn down the ones who ran us straight to the ground and left us begging.
