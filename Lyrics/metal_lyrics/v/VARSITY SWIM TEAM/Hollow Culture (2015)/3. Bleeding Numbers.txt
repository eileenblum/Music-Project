You're nothing more than a bleeding number.
a murderer, with the title of a hero.
Remorse.
Its eating you from the inside out.

I see the fear
running straight through your eyes.
too far, too deep.
The regret will eat you alive.

(It'll eat you alive) [3x]

From the inside out.
I can see the fear, building inside, rotting your mind. Everything turns black when you're hiding behind the mask you've created.

How can you breathe
When you're losing your mind.
They promised fortune and left you with a title, that has no value.
How can you breathe
When you're losing your mind
Why did you rely on them?
Thrown to the streets
Like a deer to the wolves.

The fear will eat you from the inside out. The voices, they pierce through your ears.
"you reap what you sow" [2x]

Signed away your life like you had nothing left to lose. A bleeding number doing the dirty work for a man in a suit. Sown off your eyes, stapled your mouth shut. And when the deed is done they'll throw you back to where you came from.
I can see the fear
in your eyes.
In your eyes.

I can see the fear, building inside, rotting your mind. Everything turns black when you're hiding behind the mask you've created.
