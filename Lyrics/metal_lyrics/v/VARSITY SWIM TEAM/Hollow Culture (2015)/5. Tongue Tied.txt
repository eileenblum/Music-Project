Accept defeat
What are you running from?
burn down the bridges that keep you attached.

Iv seen passed your weak mind
Snake eye, stuck in his past.
What are you running from? Burn off the bridges that keep you attached.
You weak piece of shit.
How the fuck do you live with yourself?

Eyes of a traitor
Eyes of a snake
How do you claim what you did not create? Running in circles running with hate.
Count your damn blessings before its too late.
Brick by brick, soon you will fall and be just another brick on the ground.
Blood, drips from your eyes, with the glare of a coward your tongue tied.

Your fate, will lay in the hands of the shadows that stalk you. Brick by brick, you will fall and be another coward buried in the ground.
(Buried in the ground) [2x]
Brick by brick, you will fall and be another coward buried in the ground.

Lay yourself to rest.
Cause no one wants to bury you.

Rot in hell you fucking coward.
Rot in hell [2x]

Your fate, will lay in the hands of the shadows that stalk you. Brick by brick, you will fall and be another coward buried in the ground.
(Buried in the ground) [2x]
Brick by brick, you will fall and be another coward buried in the ground.
