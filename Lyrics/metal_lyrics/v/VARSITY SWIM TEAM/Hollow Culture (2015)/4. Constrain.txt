Take my away from this place
I rather go fucking blind than watch this world rot from the filth we've created. Trapped inside these walls, five foot thick, all I see is gray.
enclosed, imprisoned, slaved away inside the mind of myself.
Is this what it's come too.
I am a servant with no escape.
so listen closely.
I am a servant with no escape
I am a prisoner slaving away my days
I've been confined in a world so cruel
This bitterness is running straight through my veins.
take me away.
I am my own demise.

I sought my own demise
I sought my own demise
I sought my own demise
I am my own demise
