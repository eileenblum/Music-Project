Fuck, This generation is fucking dead
And you are all to blame
Fuck, You all are nothing more than a walking sickness.

Go count your followers
Go count your fucking tweets
You mindless lifeless clones
Don't do anything
Fucking trash
A worthless breed
A walking sickness
A walking disease

Buried neck deep in shame,
Look at the damage that surrounds you.
Buried neck deep in shame,
No dignity, no love just hate
Buried alive.
Buried alive inside the shame.
Buried alive.

An endless cycle of disgusting
Such weak minds.
So easily, manipulated.

No respect
No dignity, no love just hate.
Greed and ignorance
flowing through your veins
neck deep in shame.
Put out the flame,
End the cycle, end this game.
open your eyes, break free from the chains.

Fuck, This generation is fucking dead
And you are all to blame.
Fucking trash.
A worthless breed
A walking sickness
a walking disease.

Buried neck deep in shame,
Look at the damage that surrounds you.
Buried neck deep in shame,
No dignity, no love just hate
Buried alive.
Buried alive inside the shame.
Buried alive.

This generation is fucking dead
