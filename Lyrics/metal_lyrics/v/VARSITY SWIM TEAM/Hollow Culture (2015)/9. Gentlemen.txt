I'm alive.
How can I believe
When my filthy fucking presence is killing me.
Is this what you wanted?

Tonight
Let me take hold of you
to cherish everything
The rush, the feeling of madness
It's eating my sanity
Numb minds, eyes filled with hate
I'm going insane, I'm going insane.

I'm alive

How can I believe, with eyes of hate
Is this what you wanted?

Tonight
Let me take hold of you
to cherish everything
The rush, the feeling of madness
It's eating my sanity
Numb minds, eyes filled with hate
I'm going insane, I'm going insane.

I rather be dead.
