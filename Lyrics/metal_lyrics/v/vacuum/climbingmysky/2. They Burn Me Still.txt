Alone on magic carpet
We embraced each other
Your eyes tasted blue
Now nothing can ease my grief

More than thousand times
I kissed you lips
Your farewall tears burn me still

I shivered and felt dizzy
In garden of your breast
Now nothing can ease my pain

Touch of outside world
So gloomy cold
Shovering grains of time
So false

Alone on magic carpet
Coldn't soothe each other
Shivering we embraced 
Now nothing can ease my tears
Nothing can ease my tears
Nothing can
And farewell kisses burn me still.
