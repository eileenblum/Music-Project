Silent streaming thorny tear
Of those who fainted like I will

At lonely nights falling to pain
At dreamless nights screaming my name

Forgive dying eternity
Feeling my blues, out of pity

Never do mourn over my kies
Beyond the curtain, without my lips

Have a good cry, innocent cry
Cause in despair once I will die
Once I will die

Is fading sun to blame?
Or weeping dawn in flame?
Screaming my name
Falling to pain

Have a good cry, innocent cry
Cause I'm climbing my sky
Up endless sky.
