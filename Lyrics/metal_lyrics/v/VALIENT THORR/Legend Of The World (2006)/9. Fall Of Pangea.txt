before the dawning of mankind
other creatures roamed this land
they were from a far off time
and they brought with them a plan
from a dying portal in the sky it came, a grey transporter set the sky
ablaze in search of sanctuary to the earth they came all life before
this point had just been washed away asteroids and comets ripped right
through the atmosphere laid waste to all the dinosaurs its a cycle its
a cycle thats been going on since before this world began, even though
they cause destruction they're vital they're a vital part of reality,
the spores in side were alive, when the dust settled over the oceanbed
they watched it they watched the natural process of evolution in the
raw, lifeforms grew in the water and this is what they saw they saw
volcanoes, Earth was a wreck, the cooling of the lava produced a side
effect they saw amoeba combine with light, they saw the first thing
crawl on land and try to walk upright they saw the dolphin, they saw
the ape, the combination of the two would help the world take shape
(they bred them) on the beaches, it was called Pangea population spread
so fast it caused an imbalance, but that couldn't stop em even then,
c'mon!
let's get on the road, i got somethin to show, pull up yr roots, and
pack yr bags, let's go!
let's get on the road, i got somethin to show, pull up yr roots, and
pack yr bags- let's go to the mountain and then you will see the place
where Pangea Ma-jor used to be the tectonic plates moved where workers
had mined the shift in the continents divided mankind Tidal waves broke
the goddamned thing in half, 7 pieces that wouldn't last spread like
germs, thats the human virus form seeds were planted here on earth,
young mothers then gave birth they remembered the men from the sky,
named them gods and never questioned why?
climb up the mountain and see for yrself, the ice caps are melting away
from the shelf the earth is evolving, you must have forgot, the life on
this planet has only one shot.
Tidal waves broke the goddamned thing in half, 7 pieces that wouldn't
last earths been silent many times, u seem to forget:
we are temporary
you are temporary
we're all temporary
