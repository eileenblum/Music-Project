i heard it through the grapevineyards
gossip, data, knowledge, updated classified facts- NO!
it was all an illusion!
these savages use smoke and mirrors to throw you far away from any real
facts.
sight beyond sight and careful scrutiny is required when listening to
your commander in chief we are being faced with a facade of civility
for some reason all hands are on deck and our country is armed to the
teeth and doing everything in their power to disarm everyone else while
simultaneously turning the country into a gigantic money makin, money
spending shit machine this lust for newness is more addictive than any
drug.
we're all hooked and we can all do better.
we should be ashamed for listening to this clown.
only probablility can heal the splintered mind.
