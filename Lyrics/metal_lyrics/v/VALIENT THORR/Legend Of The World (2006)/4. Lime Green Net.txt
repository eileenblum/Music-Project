there's a lime net way up in the cosmos, a giant grid that connects
possiblility the choice in life for instant stimulation, is similar to
the choice of fate or destiny do your choices affect those around you?
back out cher problems and take a look around connect the dots on yr
current situation, retrace yr steps is the only thing ive found that
works.
can u grasp the grid of possibility?
every choice in yr life is one that counts timestreams not a footrace
friction causes all the magnets to make dna greeks and romans thought
of themselves as the gods!
all their choices now are history
technology surpassed the sun
universal expansion has hushed the guh-lo-buh.
some people try to live their life and walk all around this land as if
we're guided by someone else's hand now that we live on earth, we got
responsibility, don't ever trade yr freedom for their security you'll
never catch me without a fight there aint a man in the world who can
stop our rocknroll you wanna taste of OUR choice? Give it to em!
there's a lime net way up in the cosmos, a giant grid that connects
possiblility when u find yrself in that situation, its similar to the
choice of fate or destiny.
there's a lime net way up in the cosmos, a giant grid that connects
possiblility the choice in life for instant stimulation, is similar to the
choice of fate or destiny what will u choose? infinity looms don't
blindly commit to any set path the will to survive will keep u alive
back out of yr thoughts, and fall in the net. [x2]
