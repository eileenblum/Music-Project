Are you searchin' for a higher power? Or
has everything worked out just fine?
I guess the reason that I'm asking
questions, is that several things have
been on my mind.

There are motherfuckers workin' for
peace, and there are people who
couldn't care less
There are soldiers who are dying in the
street, and there are families that are starting to stress.
If you put the quarter in the machine.
Then you give the game all that you got
sometimes you run outta credits.
It all seems rigged, but you know that its not
They only collect once a month
And you have been pumping it every single day.
20 bucks doesn't seem like much
But if you type in the code then you can
blow 'em away!
They don't believe in your religion,
They don't believe in your space,
They only believe in your money,
When they're wiping it all over their face.
Some bloody question mama
Somebody was down in the front
Punch in this code and then press start.
You're the one that they're trying to hunt.
C'mon! They work in the schools
They work for the state
They program their lessons
To look good on your plate
You'll swallow it down
You'll eat every bite
Now the hooks in yer mouth
You won't put up a fight.
They wanted more, more and more
Butcher their husbands,
Kick down the door.
Run to the kitchen, grab ahold of the wives
Increase your stamina, now poke out her eyes.
Is this the life, that you wanted to lead?
Brainwashed for quarters, its freedom you need.
And how do we get it?
By killing our own?
Too late for questions
My silver is gone.
Total destruction!
Land and the sea
Missiles are launching, I'm playing for free!
Millions are dying, thousands are hurt
But I'll live forever, longer than dirt
Somebody watch me! I'll get the high score
You rack up the points by killing the poor
Infinite lives, thousands of men
We live forever! Let's play again!
Infinite lives, you're gonna die
Your codes are worthless
It was a lie, Infinite Lives
It's in your head. No one lives forever
You're already dead
