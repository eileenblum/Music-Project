ll these Caesars, slicker than the oil
they own, scheme plans for years
Crack their fingers and smile real big,
While yet family drowns in tears
Someday, when your feet are up, you'll
soon be shouting NEVER!
I hope the ghosts of the dead come
haunt yer soul forever!
Whatcha gonna do?
Money can't save you
AAAAAIGHHHHHH!!!!
What was that?
Gonna give yourself a heart attack!
My family! They trust you!
The ghosts of my family
Will crush you!
Skeletons in closet
Lawyer suing
Natives reservations
Casinos ruined, all nations!
They trust you!
The ghosts of all nations!
Will crush you!
Drowns in tears
Someday, when your feet are up, you'll
soon be shouting NEVER!
I hope the ghosts of the dead come
haunt yer soul forever!
Its too late to save your skin!
Playing the role of dumb, religious
men
you'll regret all those you've fucked
when your demons eat you up.
(All these Caesars, slicker than oil)
Can't get forgiveness, its too late
(All these years, still the same)
So many wishes drowned in hate
(I would make the more
adequate decisions)
For all of those lives that you made rough
(To not follow in my fathers name)
instant karmas not enough.
All these Caesars, slicker than the
oil they own, scheme plans for years
Crack their fingers and smile real
big, while yer family drowns in tears.
Someday when your feet are up
You'll soon be
shouting NEVER!
I hope the ghosts of the dead come
haunt yer soul forever!
