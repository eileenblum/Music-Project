Wear a mask of sanity, it takes a lot of time
You gotta claw your way from the 
bottom of the ladder if your
gonna stand out in line.
You'd never guess the secret for a
trick to play out so well
You gotta make a deal with someone if
You're gonna reign in hell, c'mon
Running on empty to be free,
You're wearing a mask of sanity
Take care of yer problems and let me be,
You're wearing a mask of sanity
You ain't got no divinity, no
You're wearing a mask of sanity
Get too close and you might see [if you]
Wear a mask of sanity and cover up your tracks.
If you're in for the long 
hual brother you got to watch behind your back.
Don't reveal your sources mama,
Watch who you befriend
If you let them get too close, 
it'll prove to be your end
C'mon! Running on empty to be free
You're wearing a mask of sanity
Take care of yer problems and let me be,
You're wearing a mask of sanity
You ain't got no divinity, no
We all wear a mask of sanity
You got the pieces
You got the power
And no one needs to know
You're in a tailspin, you wanna live forever
Someone wants to be forever
Someone has to get together
My brains are messed up
From all the things I've tried. 
I bought this mask to wear so I can hide
It makes me look normal â now they all think I'm sane,
I put my mask on and wash away the constant pain
I used to look for fun â now I'm too lazy
I put my mask on and then I'm not so crazy
If you are trapped now â 
and you need to be free
Hit the road with a mask of sanity, C'mon
You got the pieces
You got the power
And no one needs to know
You're in a tailspin
You wanna live forever
Something has toget together
Someone must take it home
He's never going home
He's only gonna roam
HE'S NEVER GOIN HOME!
I feel âlet downâ well up inside of me
That's when I put on a mask of sanity.
