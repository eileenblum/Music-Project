sticks and stones might break my bones but yr wordsll never hurt me
the one who cast that first little stone some dayll have to pass right thru me
i trust that all the good little girls know a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
when ya growin up on this earth ya got some problems to solve and yr buddies will too
but you got to keep that third eye open, the one thats in the back of yr head
cause when they sneak up on ya, and they stare into its gaze
watchit when they light that fuse, cause those fireworks might blow up in yr face
and that might hurt a little bit more than some sticks and stones
sticks and stones might break my bones but yr wordsll never hurt me
the one who cast that first little stone some dayll have to pass right thru me
i trust my insticts but i do not trust my superiors orders
if we never question our leaders sticks and stones might stab us in the back
hahahahahahahaha you know they say welcome to the universe? well ill see you at the top baby!
cause thats where i wanna see you, way up at the top, alright.
sticks and stones might break my bones but yr wordsll never hurt me
the one who cast that first little stone some dayll have to pass right thru me
i trust that all the good little girls know a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
your sticks and stones might break my bones but anything you say can be held against you...
haha! oh yeah that's right, you know what im talking about, huuwahwhahahahwhwhahwhwaa
