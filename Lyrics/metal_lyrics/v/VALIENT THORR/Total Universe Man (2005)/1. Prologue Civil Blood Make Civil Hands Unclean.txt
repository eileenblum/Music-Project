alahoy! alahoy!
let's come together now true believers! it seems that once again we find ourselves alive here on this planet, standing here as we do sometimes looking out into that crowd that wants something. yellin out to all those ears something baby. What do those ears bleed for? Hope? Truth? well what if those ears don't like what they hear? what if they decide like many that they are SO free that they don't have to care. and what if my words would not be so pure? seeing the end so many times, only to come back to the beginning, its time for something bigger, its time for something badder than before. its time for the total universe man. Soon the whole of the universe will rejoice into the unknown hallows of itself. Alright true believers! it seems the time has come, i can hear them knocking.... your future is beatin down our door. what are you gonna do? are you gonna sit there? or are you gonna get up and answer it? no ones there! you can't see them, but i know i can help you find them. you gotta take it to the streets. you gotta hunt them down, and you gotta sweat pure energy. Secure the perimeter! sound the alarms and remember one thing, THE DREAMS OF EVERYONE WILL HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IF NONE OF US LIVE ON TO TELL ABOUT IT. alright! let's give em a showdown!
