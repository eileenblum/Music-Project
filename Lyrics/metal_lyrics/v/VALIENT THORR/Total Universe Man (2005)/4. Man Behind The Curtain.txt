im comin down from the mountain, ohohohoh im drinkin from that fountain, on you ill put a hurtin, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.... alright, believe!......
get up, i wanna see em.....(speaks in tongues)
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
the one who can see that will live til the dawn
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
the one who believes will relate to this song
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
and he who denies it won't live very long
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
but try to decieve and you end up its pawn
the one who prevails here will lead us away
but darkness will shroud us all here til that day
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
if only we could see through there to the dawn
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
and he whos behind it will never belong
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
the one that i see it will live til the dawn
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
believe in its power awake on the lawn
the curtain the curtain the curtain is drawn
the one who believes it will never be strong
the curtain the curtain the curtains away
the one who will fly there won't live til this day
(tongues)
