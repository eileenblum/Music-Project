If I can only get a break
So much more than I can take
I try to make amends but
I'm torn apart
Torn apart
Trapped for the reason
You and your personal notes
Hard it is to succumb in
Life inside a rolling stone
Eternal season of black
In this curtain call
No longer the man behind
I've got no tricks left
I've got nowhere to hide
Going over the edge now
Raid within my heart

Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart

I found my shadows of the night
If I could only reach the light
I'd die of blue
I'm torn apart
Torn apart

A close call for sanity
I'll turn up this gruesome fear
My eyes are seeing nothing
as we get followed from this fear
The arbalest gets black
One touch and they knew
Creating wills of fire
If you don't use the tools
The tools use you
Going over the edge now
Brain's ripping my heart

Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
Going over the edge now
Brain's ripping my heart
Going over the edge now
Brain's ripping my heart

Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
Torn apart
