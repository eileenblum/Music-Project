War and fight against the hell,
You're a preacher of the light
I would say you never win,
Cause Satan has the might
Sword and fire against the cross
That's too much for you
You have lost the fight again
Now your soul is lost, too
Evil fight the angels back
The world is burning hot
The king of hell will never quit
And now your soul will rot

Satan's colours
Red and black
Devil's army fight your back

They ride the storm through the night
There is no escape, they're creatures of the night
They're evil made
The leader of this army is Satan lord of night
He takes the life, he takes the soul,
destroys the world tonight

Satan's colours
Red and black
Devil's army fight your back

Think about it come to us
The winners of the war
Disaster and pain to everyone
This is our law
We're bad, we are insane
Creatures of the night
Riding down the way to hell
You never see the light

Now destroy the paradise the snake is seduce you
Eating from the apple tree, that's a great sin, too
It doesn't matter, Satan laughs, you're coming down to hell
You have a glitter in your eyes and now your soul to sell
In red and black we're standing up, 'cause we're dressed to kill
This colours are the satan's one and stands on the hill

Satan's colours
Red and black
Devil's army fight your back

We ride the storm through the night, there is no escape
We are creatures of the night, we're evil made
The leader of our army is Satan lord of night
He takes the life, he takes the soul, destroys the world tonight.

Satan's colours
Red and black
Devil's army fight your back

Think about it come to us
The winners of the war
Desaster and pain to everyone
This is our law
We're bad, we are insane
Creatures of the night
Riding down the way to hell
You never see the light
