In this world of liberty
There is only death to see
A head is lying in the sand
The commoner's fighting till the end
They slaughter down all fucking lords
They kill them just like decayed dogs
But there's a shadow on the floor
It's from this man, the master of war

The exterminator, the exterminator
You don't want to subject yourself,
But he's the stronger man
He has got evil in his brain,
So take care if you can.
The exterminator, the exterminator
You don't have to fight, you don't have to pray
And now lose your life, in the end you say:
The exterminator, the exterminator

When panic's breaking loose today
You're running down the streets of life
Now, you feel rottness in your way
The hangman let you feel his knife
They open all the gates of hell tonight
No freedom and no peace there's only fight
It's called war and battle to be free
One man is laughing about this liberty

Exterminator
