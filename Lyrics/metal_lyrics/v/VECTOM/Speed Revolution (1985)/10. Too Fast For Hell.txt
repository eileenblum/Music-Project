The metal thunder grows to storm
We're playing once again
There's no one who can stop us now
The sound will blast your brain

You want the action, so come on bang your head,
You want the power, we gonna show you how.
You want the action, so come on bang your head,
You want the power, we gonna show you how.

The show begins, we'll do our best,
Your neck will split at once
We'll knock Lucifer dead tonight
So take care of your balls

You want the action, so come on bang your head,
You want the power, we gonna show you how.
You want the action, so come on bang your head,
You want the power, we gonna show you how.

Too fast for the devil, too fast for hell
Too fast for the devil, too fast for hell
Too fast for the devil, too fast for hell
Too fast for the devil, too fast for hell

It drives you wild, you're fuckin' mad
The death is by your side
Your blood is boiling in your veins,
Your ass gets kicked tonight

You want the action, so come on bang your head,
You want the power, we gonna show you how.
You want the action, so come on bang your head,
You want the power, we gonna show you how.

Too fast for the devil, too fast for hell
Too fast for the devil, too fast for hell
Too fast for the devil, too fast for hell
Too fast for the devil, too fast for hell
