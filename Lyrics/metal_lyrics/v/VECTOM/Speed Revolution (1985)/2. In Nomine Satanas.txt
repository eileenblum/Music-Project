The blackest night the sharpest blade,
The sacrifice must go on.
No kruzifix no holy thing
Cause evils work is done.
In the darkness there are gleaming eyes
They always look at you
It burns your brain, slave of hell
And you fight for evil, too
By moonlight blood runs, we rape the virgin now
Rip it out, screaming loud, draw her intestines out.
Watch out! Satan, your master's watching you
Pray to him every night and kill his victims, too.

The kruzifix is inversed, hey preacher, you aren't free.
In nomine satanas you are imprisoned by me.
There is no escape you bastard, now start to cry.
In nomine satanas, in nomine satanas, die!

We all live in the court of hell
The creatures spit at you
Waiting for the son of pain
Before the dawn breaks through
Dance around the fire
Cause evil is still alive
It saws at your live wire
And cuts it with a knife
By moonlight blood runs, we rape the virgin now
Rip it out, screaming loud, draw her intestines out.
Watch out! Satan, your master's watching you
Pray to him every night and kill his victims, too.

The kruzifix is inversed, hey preacher, you aren't free.
In nomine satanas you are imprisoned by me.
There is no escape you bastard, now start to cry.
In nomine satanas, in nomine satanas!

Can't you see the evil eyes?
It's the devil in disguise.
Now it's time for you to sell.
Awaiting you in hell.

The kruzifix is inversed, hey preacher, you aren't free.
In nomine satanas you are imprisoned by me.
There is no escape you bastard, now start to cry.
In nomine satanas, in nomine satanas, die, die!
