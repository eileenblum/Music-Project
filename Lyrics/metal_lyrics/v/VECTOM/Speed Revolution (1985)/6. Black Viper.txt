She brings torment through the black night,
You've no way to hide, no way to hide.

Dangerous creatures brandish the sword,
They will be laud, they will be laud.

Black viper is coming,
The terror sets in, she feels right.
Some die by the sword and the other one
Dies by her bitte,
Dies by her bitte,
Dies by her bitte.

Satanic snake destroy the earth,
For Satan's rebirth, for Satan's rebirth.

Horror creatures fight at her side,
Against the light, yes - against the light.

Black viper is coming,
The terror sets in, she feels right.
Some die by the sword and the other one
Dies by her bitte,
Dies by her bitte,
Dies by her bitte.
