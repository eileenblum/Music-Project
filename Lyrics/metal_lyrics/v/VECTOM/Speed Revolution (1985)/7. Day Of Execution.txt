Sitting in the jail, my end is near
The hangman is waiting for me.
The deuce! I'm eating my last meal.
And suddenly there is someone talking to me

Come back to god, don't you see the light
And pray tonight

But I am hard, I am a dirty man,
My soul is black and will rot.
I don't pray to god, I pray to Satan,
This is my master, this is my god.

Tonight I'm free, yes I see the light
It's dark and it shows me the way.

They take me down to the guillotine,
The blade is cutting my head.
My soul is wandering down to hell,
It's the day of execution you've said

Priest now fight, yield your life to me
And pray tonight

I'm a servant of hell and nobody
Can defeat my plans.
If somebody will stop me,
I'll take him to the execution!

Tonight I'm free, yes I see the light
It's dark and it shows me the way.
Priest of hell, yield your life to me
And pray tonight.
