We all live in a world of rock 'n roll
The music we like to play
We like it fast, we like it loud
That is it, what we want to say
We don't like softrock, heavy is lewd
On stage we show our fight
Against the world and for rock 'n roll
Only heavy metal is right
Come to the concerts and bang your head
Vectom show you the way
Loudness and speed, you like to hear
We give it to you on a tray
The Marshal-power roar in your ears
Get ready for a metal attack
Your voice is always screaming loud
Cause we're ahead of the pack.

What do you want to hear?
- Loudness and speed
Baby the day is near
It's our turn
The killing command for you
- Loudness and speed
It drives you crazy, too
Crying in lust

Jack Daniels is our favourite drink
Backstage ten bottles all day
A lot of groupies in front of the door
Yeah, all this girls for play
Playing guitar on the stage
Fighting all others down
Killing, but not with the sword
Killing with our sound

What do you want to hear?
- Loudness and speed
Baby the day is near
It's our turn
The killing command for you
- Loudness and speed
It drives you crazy, too
Crying in lust
