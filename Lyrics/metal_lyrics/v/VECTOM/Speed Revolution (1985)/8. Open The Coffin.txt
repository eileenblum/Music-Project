The night is rough
You fight again
The urge is still destroying you
It is no sin
That you can't resist
The devil laughs about it, too
There is a earthquake
Under the graves
All the night birds are flying high
Feel the power in your body now
Welcome the devil with a cry.

You have a beast inside
And it breaks out
The devil calls you once again
666 you know
You're a hunter, you're a killing man
You like the darkness
You shy at light
You're a child of night, all
You fight all night,
All night again,
With the devil at your side.

Open the coffin, the massacre begins
Open it and cry
Open the coffin, black might comes out
Open it and die

Break

Open the coffin, the massacre begins
Open it and cry
Open the coffin, black might comes out
Open it and die

All right

Open the coffin, the massacre begins
Open it and cry
Open the coffin, black might comes out
Open it and die

Open the coffin, the massacre begins
Open it and cry
Open the coffin, black might comes out
Open it and die

All right
