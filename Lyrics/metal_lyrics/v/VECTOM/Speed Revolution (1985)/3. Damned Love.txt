When you see a virgin
You can't resist
She is your victim
You become a sadist
You like to bring trouble into her life
And now you get crazy, draw your knife

You are a satanic lover
Your order is clear
Dirty tormentor
The night is near
Hello girls! Better watch out!
I'll show you, if you have doubt.

Damned love, it's a sacrifice
Damned love, it's a sacrifice

Your blood is boiling
Your fingers are hot
This business is cruel
There's no chance to stop
It tastes like shit, this dirty damned love
But you are the killer, you can't get enough.

Evil is stronger
You're damned in gods name
Hey, bloody sinner
You're Lucifer's friend
The demon of love, that's what you want to be
You're ripping the girls for hell's liberty.

Damned love, it's a sacrifice
Damned love, it's a sacrifice
Damned love, a sacrifice

Damned love, it's a sacrifice
Damned love, it's a sacrifice
