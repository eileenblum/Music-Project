Everything around our lives is controlled by something named Destiny
Even if it's our own choice, it has been decided by our own destiny

Free from rules, and blooms of trees
Tame before the extreme storm

Show me the internal bleeding of our mother earth!

All we can feel is the shock
Foams we can see at home
Broken seabed's skin

Save our peace of spaces
Stop the tease of influences

Even if it's our own choice, it has been decided by our own destiny without insanity

Free from rules, and blooms of trees
Tame before the extreme storm

SHOW ME THE INCURABLE FRESH WOUNDS of our mother earth!

Tell me the reason for existence of our thinking powers
Every season will disappear without any rains and any rays
Could not the idea of making bombs erase at all, if nobody were on the earth?

Save our peace of spaces
Stop the tease of influences

Save our peace of spaces
Stop the tease of influences

Stop the tease of influences

Show me the problems of our mother earth!

Tell me the reason for existence of our thinking powers
Every season will disappear without any rains and any rays
Could not the idea of making bombs erase at all, if nobody were on the earth?

Save our peace of spaces
Stop the tease of influences

Stop!
