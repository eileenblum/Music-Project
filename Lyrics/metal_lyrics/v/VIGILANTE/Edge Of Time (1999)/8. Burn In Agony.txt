Alone in the dark place
There's no light
There's no place to hide
All I can do is to breathe
From here to the other side
There's no fight
There's no place to cry
Remember the face of the baby crying

Flame in remains
Snails in decay
Trails on the place after the reign

Time to settle it now
Time to stop it now
Time to retaliate on them

Right to reject it
Right to solve it
With the united efforts of their own

What's mean of the justice
That everybody notices without any doubts?
Can we find the justice
To stop the slaughter without attacks?

Kill for kills
Blood on blood
Tears on tears
Crime for crime
An eye for an eye
Dust to dust
Burn in their agonies
Flame in remains
Burn in their agonies
Snails in decay
Trails on the place after the reign

Fight to stop the killing
Fight to save the living
Fight to threaten the world

What's mean of the justice
That everybody notices without any doubts?
Can we find the justice
To stop the slaughter without attacks?

Kill for kills
Blood on blood
Tears on tears
Crime for crime
An eye for an eye
Dust to dust
Burn in their agonies
Flame in remains
Burn in their agonies
Snails in decay
Trails on the place after the reign
