Thorns stuck in your eyes
Without pains and slaying
Inside your mind
That's the power of your master
The color of the egg was RED!
The color of the rain was BLACK!
Whatever you feel wrong and strange is the proof of your betrayal

Method of madness with sadness with a sigh
Lots of kindnesses with unhappiness with lots of lies
Oh... This travel with awful wonderings
Oh... Your snuggle tooth knows everything

Revolution calling from your god
Resolution falling to your heaven

Rooms lacked in your life
We need rains and playing
Inside your mind
That's the thing we want now, Master!
The flowers in your dream were dead
The tower of your extreme were gone
Whatever you feel wrong and strange is the proof of your betrayal

Method of madness with sadness with a sigh
Lots of kindnesses with unhappiness with lots of lies
Oh... This travel with awful wonderings
Oh... Your snuggle tooth knows everything

Revolution calling from your god
Resolution falling to your heaven

Detect your own way
Or dedicate your whole things
To your freedom!

A lie after lies
Your pride is a desire with your burden
The crime of the infernal majesty
Now it's time to get rid out of this world
Maybe it's circulating forever

Revolution calling from your god
Resolution falling to your heaven

Detect your own way
Your pride is a desire with your burden
Pretext... it's no way!
Dedicate your whole things
To your freedom!
"EDGE OF TIME"
