What I feel good is what you need
What you seek is what I breed
We have believed our roots and brand new takes

Hold the steady thoughts
NEVER SAY DIE!
I've just played my part
For what it's worth
Destiny is calling

Clocks tick away
BLOCKS FALL AWAY
In the whirlpool of time
Prisoner of fate, truth and farce
Without warning, your past was erased

What I feel bad is what you lean
What you keep is what I leave
We have deceived our roots and drunken slaves

Hold the steady thoughts
NEVER SAY DIE!
I've just played my part
For what it's worth
Destiny is calling

Clocks tick away
BLOCKS FALL AWAY
In the whirlpool of time
Prisoner of fate, truth and farce
Without warning, your past was erased

What we feel good is what we make
What we look upon is what we are
We have to think our differences from each side

Hold the steady thoughts
NEVER SAY DIE!
I've just played my part
For what it's worth
Destiny is calling

Clocks tick away
BLOCKS FALL AWAY
In the whirlpool of time
Prisoner of fate, truth and farce
Without warning, your past was erased
