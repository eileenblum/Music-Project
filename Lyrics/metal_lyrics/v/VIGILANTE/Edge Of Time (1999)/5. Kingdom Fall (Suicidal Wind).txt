The hill's covered with flame
The spirit's gonna be haze
That's going up to the air
Who's there?
Is the death for their fame and power?

Clouds are falling down
No stars... Nothing at all shines
Never ending darkness gives eternal silence
Yes!
All we can do is to dream in the fame
That shone in the past tense
In the dark

Oh... Kingdom falls in destiny...
Fall!! Fall!! Fall!!
Nothing for all
Inside out, there were unseen evidences
It's like a ship without a steering wheel
Floating souls fade up out of hail
Pain and agony...

If you can judge, we want to know what it is
Tell us!

Oh... Kingdom falls in destiny...
Fall!! Fall!! Fall!!
Nothing for all
Inside out, there were unseen evidences
It's like a ship without a steering wheel
Floating souls fade up out of hail
Pain and agony...

If you can judge, we want to know what dreams and reality are

Creeping worms on the shell are sleeping
It's just like dream in eternity
Throw it away! That's the shell of sleeping
And their mind bothers us
The reviving ends

Eternal dreams give an omission
(That's called) Suicidal wind!
Suicidal wind
The legends of the mystic force
Are stuck into your heart
And ripping the ties between the king and the freaks
Dawn!

Creeping worms on the shell are sleeping
It's just like dream in eternity
Throw it away! That's the shell of sleeping
And their mind bothers us
The reviving ends

Eternal dreams give an omission
(That's called) Suicidal wind!
Suicidal wind
The legends of the mystic force
And the historic curse
Are stuck into your heart
And ripping the ties between the king and the freaks
Dawn!
