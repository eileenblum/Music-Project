Keep under with your faith
You may lean to their blame and praise for you

A pure embryo's dyed the same color
As his mother's womb deeply in her
It's not his choice
Pre-decided way of thinking
Raindrops are falling in your eyes
But it cannot wash up your mind
Inheritance without any circumstances

"In the dead of night
I'd like to descend to my friend
To my life
And to my sacrifice"
TWIST into FORMS! Nothing in my mind...

Keep under with your faith
You may lean to their blame and praise for you

No one has come to his senses
From his fatal illusion
His judgement day
The end of days of pain
Forever shining drizzle
Something like unavoidable wind
Thank my god to all of my circumference

"In the dead of night
I'd like to descend to my friend
To my life
And to my sacrifice"
TWIST into FORMS! Nothing in my mind...

Keep under with your faith
You may lean to their blame and praise for you
