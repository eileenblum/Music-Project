Deposit your soul
Repose in our hall
Devastating humanities
Bending the power in your life
Leaving the evil whisper in your mind

Ask your own responsibility
We can give you the first opportunity
Look around your insanity
Reality...
SILENT SPREE SILENT SPREE

Inquisitive crows
Dispose for the flow
Assassinating humanities
Repenting of murders in your life
The voice from your god
"You gonna die!!"

See a revolution in the problems
Inside of the madness
There's no time to be lost now
Demoniac shows a steady decline
Vigilant politico plays a farce and whisper
That number is the power bewared

Raise your HANDS UP!
Waste your TIME!
An apparition through your twilight
BREED your endless
GREED for all!
Disqualify their civil rights!

After the ruination
The big stream running through
The mystic land
No place to hide your disgrace
So there's no easy solutions
Save our prides!
Reveal! Carry out!
What do you say?
Silent majority...
Now we must fasten our eyes
We don't suffer fools no more
Save our prides!
Reveal! Carry out!
What do you say?
Silent majority...
I'm expecting it starts to flow

Find our own guilty lying
It's not too late

Ask your own responsibility
We can give you the first opportunity
Look around your insanity
As you can see
Ask your own responsibility
We can give you the first opportunity
Look around your insanity
SILENT SPREE SILENT SPREE

No ones filth away
