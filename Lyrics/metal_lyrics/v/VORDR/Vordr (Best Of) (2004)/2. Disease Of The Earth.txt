Until death takes me
Have I little hope
I dwell
In desperate dreams

The anxiety of life
Growing by the day
Unbearable burden
A solemn sigh of pain

Bleeding
As I wish to enter
The realm of eternal sleep
Beyond time and thought

The drops
Graciously joining in streams
The tyranny of life
Overrun and overtaken

This sadness of the earth
Loathed by itself
Terminal solution
To rise nevermore

Disease of the earth

Until death takes me
Have I little hope
I dwell
In desperate dreams
