The sun sets behind the trees
Old raven cries alone
His song for the moonless sky
When darkness is complete

I wander in the night
Touching serenity
Casting no shadow
Breathing icy breeze

The fire in my heart
It flickers and goes out
Without noticing how dark
How cold it has become

I wander in the night
Touching serenity
Casting no shadow
Breathing icy breeze

In this night I howl
Grasping my memories
Trying to catch the dreams
That flow from open wrists
