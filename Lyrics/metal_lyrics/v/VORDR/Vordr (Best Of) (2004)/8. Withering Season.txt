A longing gaze
At the garden of stones
Frozen death
Has captured my cold heart

I know my end is at hand
This empty shell
Will soon kiss
The freezing soil of the north

I feel the wind
I hear the call
This wintry bleakness
Beckons me

I wonder
If there is life
When this torment comes to an end

I wonder
If I can feel
When I take my own life
