Hanging from the boughs
The beard of the trees
Moss living on rind and bark
Withered leaves and wood decay

The stones stand in circle
In the heart of a giant stub
A petrified pagan altar
To the gods of today and past

Edible and poisonous mushrooms
In this damp forest shadow
The home of the forest king
Rotten trees and fungus

The throne of wisdom
Untouched by a treacherous soul
The heathen sanctuary
Clandestine - Thundergrove
