Wind carries the cries
Long time forgotten
Caught in a web of memories
Only the forest can recall

Once there was a battle
Now there is nothing
Nothing but their voices
In branches and roots

They had names
Even they can not remember
Remaining bound
To this unholy place

Wishing they could travel
Through sadness and hate
To leave this forsaken place
To reach out and be free

Wind carries the cries
Long time forgotten
Caught in a web of memories
Only the forest can recall

Once there was a battle
Now there is nothing
Nothing but their voices
In branches and roots

They had names
Even they can not remember
Remaining bound
To this unholy place
