Sitting by the table
Made of mahogany
Staring at the light
Poured by the candle

The roof is being tapped
By the thickest rain
The window stained with mist
From my breathing

Thoughts weights heavy
With my emotions
Misanthropic wisdom
The joy in depression

Departure...
I rise to the deck
Embracing the veil
Of the cleansing rain
