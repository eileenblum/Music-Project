Winter darkness creeps
Covers the surroundings
In a cloak of snow
Hiding all the withered

Knee-deep in the forest
The wooden home of anger
Breathing the once fresh air
Now stinking foul

My heart is aching
Reminder of the times
Moon of pain rises
Over the landscape

I wander deeper and deeper
Into the mighty forest
Still searching for it
The balance of man and nature
