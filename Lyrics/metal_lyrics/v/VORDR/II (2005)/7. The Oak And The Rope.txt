Walking with my frozen thoughts
Embraced by despair I sought for
Calling for the final gates
But will they let me in?

Seeking for the timeless tree
Whose branches never yield
She's beared the age of a century
She can bare my mortal weight

The oak and the rope

With tears in my itching eyes
Howling dreams are chasing me
Back to live, to see another day
But I refuse to hope again
