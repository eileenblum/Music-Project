Winter clouds hover low
Shaking hands with the mist
One gray alliance (of)
Nature's mystic charm

Over the home in the woods
Silence has landed
Poetry of the wretches
So pale and cold

Freezing atmospheric view
Over ice-covered lake
The trees are struggling hard
To carry all the snow

Over the house in the woods
Silence has landed
Poetry of the wretches
So pale and cold

White, towering icicles
Formed by the rising steam
A warm reminder
From gaps in the soil
