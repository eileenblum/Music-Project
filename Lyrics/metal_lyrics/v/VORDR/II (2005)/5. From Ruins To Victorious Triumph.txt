In this deep, wet cave
Buried from all human thought
I silently wait
For my master's call

I do not care
For the earthly pleasures
Of humanity
I couldn't care less
I couldn't care less

The human morals
Abandoned since ages
The surge within
Left nothing behind

Along with the unseen
I shall rise
From ruins to victorious triumph
My time is yet to come

I do not care
For the earthly pleasures
Of humanity
I couldn't care less
I couldn't care less
Couldn't fucking care

The human morals
Abandoned since ages
The surge within
Left nothing behind

Along with the unseen
I shall rise
From ruins to victorious triumph
My time is yet to come
