The sun shares its last rays
a river bathes under the spell
A piece of bark floats across the rocks
as a starling bids farewell

She sinks behind the tree tops
and the starling takes his leave
The piece of bark floats onwards
'til a lake so cool and deep

Surrounded by a ghostly mist
the old bark now stands still
A choir of nightly birds
sing their lullaby until...

A clan of men in iron
Make their way along the shore
Of steel and shining armour
The trees stand still in awe

Yet another human herd
Their end this night shall meet
But the piece of bark cares not
When sinking into the deep

The moon now appears
in the sky above the woods
The blood of weakling peasants
nourishes the roots

An old pine at the river bank
once again his skin sheds
A piece of old, dry bark
drops to the river bed

The pale moon still glimmers
the river bathes under the spell
A piece of bark floats across the rocks
as the night bids farewell
as the night bids farewell
