A twig cracks in silence
The sun draws below the horizon
The whispers among the trees
Unheard by plugged years

Night's wisdom
In the owl's eye
A glimmering spark
Watching over the lands

No action, no thought
Undetected by its stare
Mesmerizing, everlasting
The knowledge is sinking in

Night's wisdom
In the owl's eye
A glimmering spark
Watching over the lands

For eras of man's kin
The nocturnal hunter has reigned
Supreme in wisdom
With knowledge of grief to come

Reflection of the full moon
In the owl's eye
A glimmering spark
In the freezing forest

In the heart of the wild
One can hear the call
Blood running faster now
Listening to the funeral bells...
