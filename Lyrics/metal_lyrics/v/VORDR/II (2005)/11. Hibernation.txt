Starlight flickering
A fire in the night
Human misery
The ultimate source of strength
Peripheral glimmering
Of the growing flames
Hibernation
Veins hot with eternal blood
The subtle sound
Pyre crackling
Drifts of snow
Slowly melting away
And returning to ice
Surrounded by steam
Inhaling nocturnal fog
Beasts howling at the moon
Nature buried under snow
Breathing silently
Under the frost
Under the frost
Hibernation
Might veiled for centuries
Sleeping with passion and patience
To be once awakened
By malicious call
Of a starless eternity
An entity free of form
Darkness without breath
