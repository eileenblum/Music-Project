Blazing winter fires
Unforgiving frost
Snow blinds the eyes
That seek for light

Hopes are suffocated
Under a pillow of ice
Every breath a razorblade
Carving in the lungs

Born to bare the legacy
Born of stronger blood
Stubborn customs of pride
Heritage of honorable men

Both sword and greed
Have drowned the wisest of men
Hiding the rage inside
Never uttering the miseries

Blazing winter fires
Forever north
