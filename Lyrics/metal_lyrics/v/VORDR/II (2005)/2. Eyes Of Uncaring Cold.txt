Gaze into the hateful blue
The eyes of uncaring cold
Driven deep into your mind
Forever loathing you

Depressed at your words
Sickened by your thoughts
Strangled in the human flesh
yes scars are keys are scars

Rubbing gun-powder
In the wounds
Not much sense in this world
All that of nature is raped
And you still remain prosperous

Gaze into the hateful blue
The eyes of uncaring cold
Driven deep into your heart
Forever making you sick
