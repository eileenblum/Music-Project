For decades now
These pools have served
As mass graves
For my sacrifices

In the spring
My senses awake
And I greet
The blessed souls
Of those that I have chosen
Selected from the ranks
Of mediocrity

This is the pit
That I have dug
Here is where I drink
...and drown
Here I nourish
The sheep's heart
During the tides
With moon's passion

I have quenched my hunger again
Now wandering amidst the crystal lakes
The journey has no direction
The soul is already home
