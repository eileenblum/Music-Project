Now I've almost lost the only way I have
I'm trying to balance on my path
A gift I was given
But I threw it away
I am now like a snake
Creeping on the ground

It's like I've lost
But it feels like victory
I'm forced down to my knees
And my only wish is a second chance
But I can see the light
And I know it in my heart
That I will come back
Someday

Alive but still I can see the story
The memories are like burned in my brain
Surrounded in grey fog alone
My fight is legal, still hopeless

It's like I've lost
But it feels like victory
I'm forced down to my knees
And my only wish is a second chance
But I can see the light
And I know it in my heart
That I will come back
Someday
