[Bonus track]

To Find Eternal Peace
As I see you there before me
You beg me, for my help
I beg you, I beg you, walk with me
To find eternal peace
Your heart must belong to the trinity
To find eternal peace
Your heart must belong to the trinity
All of your life, you have mistreated your soul
Come therefore with me, and join hands
With the capstone, the capstone of all humanity
For if you keep on bite
And devour eachother
You will be destroyed
By eachother
To find eternal peace
Your heart must belong to the trinity
To find eternal peace
Your hearts must be filled by the trinity
