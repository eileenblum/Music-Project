 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[ATHENA:]
Goddess of all the Silent Wastes, thou are not found unkind
There's no Black and White, Thy Truth is not so keen
Although the Crime is Great, withhold your Sovereign Blaze

[APOLLO:]
Rise up rise again after the RING OF FIRE
My friendship's not feigning, your cause is my own
Rise up rise again after the RING OF FIRE
We'll beat them in Sunlight on this Day of Task

[ATHENA:]
Gods and all Athenians, Proud Black Erinyes
Brook no Anarchy, nor bear a Tyrant's Rule
Maintain in balance Fear the Guardian of Grace

[ERINYES:]
Rise up rise again after the RING OF FIRE
A Godless suppliant Burning in Chains
Rise up Ride the Wind, this is the End of Silence
The moment of Never on this DAY OF WRATH...
