[MUSIC BY DAVID DEFEIS &amp; EDWARD PURSINO]

[ORESTES:]
Like the Talon of Mars I'll tear right through the Wall
Thunder and Lightning in Power the Gods reveal all
In the Black where the Siren Reigns
Ravaging the Spirits of the Brave

THE WINE OF VIOLENCE, breaks our control
See the Madness, Burning Angels Glow
THE WINE OF VIOLENCE, I steal your Soul
See the Madness in me grow

I am the Wound and the Scar and the Spear come to Life
Sacred Red Son of the Sun, torn to pieces imbibed
In the Black where the Darkness rains Death
Drowning in the currents of your shame

THE WINE OF VIOLENCE, takes your control
Sin and Madness Burning Kingdoms whole
THE WINE OF VIOLENCE, I steal your Soul
See the Madness in me grow

[ORESTES to AIGISTHOS:]
Fight me you coward, Thief of Stolen Days
Joy is Destruction, driving me insane to Fight
Win the Silence of the Damned, Holy Order, High Command
Eagle tearing Flesh from Bone
Golden Whirlwind, bare the Stars we fly! Fly!!!
Let the Death Mist close your eyes!!!

[ORESTES:]
THE WINE OF VIOLENCE, takes all control
See the Fire Burning down below
THE WINE OF VIOLENCE, I steal your Soul
See the God in me Enthroned!

All Dead, Silent and alone
No more Savior carved in Stone
All Dead nobody will Weep
Icy Water, Death runs Deep... Vengeance is Mine... I regain my Halls...
