 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[ELEKTRA &amp; SLAVE WOMEN:]
Gods of Night, Gods of Death
I release thee
Now from Bondage go forth upon my Quest

Gods of Night, Gods of Death
I beseech thee
Strike with Power, steal the Dragon's Breath

[ELEKTRA to ORESTES:]
KNOW THIS, HE WAS MUTILATED WHEN SHE BURIED HIM
TO CRIPPLE HIS SPIRIT AND MAKE IT UNBEARABLE FOR YOU!!!
