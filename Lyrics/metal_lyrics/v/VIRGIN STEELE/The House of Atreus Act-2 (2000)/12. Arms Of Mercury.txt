 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[ORESTES:]
I raise my head I close my eyes
The Statue stares the Apparition smiles
Am I here living in Mystery to the last
When all Gods must die...
I am yours, Pain lives inside of me
To the End when the Final Rain must Fall... Away...

I raise my head I say Farewell
The Solemn Fears come and Crystallize
Blackened Eyes, Shadows of Misery
To the End when all Gods must die
I am yours, Death walks inside of me
For the last, for my Requiem... Again...

I Fear the ARMS OF MERCURY Surround me
From the Corners of the World I say goodbye
I know the End is coming soon
From the Margent of the World I say Farewell
I know the pain that I've caused
I know the Lives that were Lost
In this Dark Time the Eyes deny to wash all this Blood from my Hands...
In the End will we all pay this Price...

I Fear the ARMS OF MERCURY Surround...
From the Corner of the World I wave goodbye
I know the End is coming soon
From the Cauldron of the World I say Farewell
I know the Pain that I've caused
I know the Lines that were drawn
In the Dark Time will the Gods design to wash all this Blood from my Hands...
Or in the End will we all pay this price...
