[MUSIC BY: DAVID DEFEIS &amp; EDWARD PURSINO]

[KLYTEMNESTRA'S SPIRIT:]
Spirit of the Air... Remember
Spirit of the Earth... Hear my Prayer
Spirit of the Seas... I Summon thee
To the One who has no Name
Veiled is the Night, bright are the Eyes of the Dead
Fire and Water... cleanse... purify
Great Spirit of Power, hear now my Commands
Grant every Wish of Blood... Blood!

Gods of the Dead feel my Rage, enter the Circle of my Sacrifice
Take on the World, free the Plagues with the Smoke of your Word
Dark is the Vision that Burns in my Heart
Kill from within, Conjure the Seven who stand on the Mountains of Dawn
I am the Flame

Spirit of the Air... Remember
Black Gods of the Sun...

Cry out to me, steal the Thrones and the Powers of Him
Black is the Vision of all we despise
Slide on the Wind, Great is the Power that comes in the Back of the Night
I am the Flame

Spirit of the Air... Remember
Black Gods of the Sun, cry to me
Spirit of the Sea, know thy suffering
Black Gods of the Sun, hear my Cry! 

Gods of the Silence, Gods of the Damned 
Offer no Mercy, withdraw your Hand 

Gods of the Silence, Gods of the Sand 
Shorn of your Glory, Kill on Command 

Gods of the Dead, feel my Rage, enter the Circle of my Sacrifice 
Take on the World, She who Reings in the Palace of Night 
Dark is the Vision that Burns in my Heart 
Gilde down the Stars, feel my Hate 
Outcasts of Heaven we meet in the City Below, I am the Flame 

Spirit of the Air. Remember 
Black Gods of the Sun, cry to me 
Spirit of the Earth, know thy suffering 
Black Gods of the Sun, HEAR MY CRY !!!
