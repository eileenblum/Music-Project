 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[ORESTES:]
Gods of All behold this Vow
I see the Flames before my eyes
I will employ your grasp
To lead and not to blame
But I will rise with the Sun
Writhing Mask of Desire

[ERINYES:]
HAMMER THE WINDS to Fury
See your Life's Blood leave
Burning in the Darkness
Where We now shall lead
All of Us in Power on this Night

[ATHENA &amp; CHORUS:]
HAMMER THE WINDS to Fury
Bleach the Darkness Blind
Burning in a Circle
Crowned in Deadlocked Pride

[ERINYES:]
Honoured We Stand, We are All Above... All Above
In despairing Light We Shine
