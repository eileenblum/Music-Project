 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[APOLLO:]
She's the Goddess of the Silent Water waiting
Siren on the Rocks the Heir of Crime
Child of the Sun, Stormwitch of Burning
Black is the Foam of your Birth

Fasten on the Cloak of Silver Dreaming
Drain the Poison Cup or Race the Sky
Smile on the Sun, you are the Savior
Justice is not Matricide!

[APOLLO &amp; SLAVE WOMEN:]
THE VOICE AS WEAPON, THE VOICE AS WEAPON
Kill from without, Kill from within
Where the Sunlight tastes like Rage

[APOLLO:]
Poison on the Sun reveals the Hydra
Burning on the Sword I know is red
Smile on the Son's Fateful endeavor
Now she will see by disguise
Recognize the sound of Silver Screaming
Slaughtering the Nations of thy Soul

[ORESTES:]
I am the one, I own the Power 
Holiness sleeps at the eyes

[APOLLO &amp; SLAVE WOMEN:]
THE VOICE AS WEAPON, THE VOICE AS WEAPON
Kill from without, Kill from within
Where the Sunlight tastes like Rage!

[APOLLO:]
Kill this wanton pair... Or Race the Sky!

[ELEKTRA:]
Keep your Courage and now be a Man
Black Robed Angels of Death you'll Command
You may Kill her and not suffer blame
Heed the Words of Apollo's Oracle

[ORESTES:]
She's the Goddess of the Silent Water waiting
Bathing on the Shores of Murder's Wine
Smile on the Son, I am returning
Back to the Home of my Birth
Blessings on the God's Light Shining
The Crown of Victory I'll wear in time
I have the force no one can tame us
Hermes will be our guide!

[ORESTES:]
THE VOICE AS WEAPON, THE VOICE AS WEAPON
Kill from without, Kill from within
Where the Sunlight tastes like Rage!

[APOLLO, ELEKTRA &amp; SLAVE WOMEN:]
Break the Silence, break the Spirit
In the Palace, Blood will flow...
For the Shadow of thy Father
Bringing Judgment, Blood will flow...
