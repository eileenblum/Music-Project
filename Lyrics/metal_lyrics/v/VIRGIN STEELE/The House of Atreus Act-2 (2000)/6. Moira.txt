 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[KLYTEMNESTRA:]
Tears of Blood, Clouds hide the Sun
The Day goes Black in my arms
Pain and Love the Science of the World
Tears of Blood fill my Heart

[ORESTES:]
Dry your eyes the Son will rise... tomorrow
Born in Blood all must fall

[ELEKTRA &amp; SLAVE WOMEN:]
KILL HER, KILL HER!!!

[ORESTES:]
Mountains arise, the Cities die
(Into the Seas of Blood, Scars of War remain...)
By the Power of the Will and Mind
Drown my Soul within your lips
(Into the Seas of Blood, Scars of War remain...)
The Scars of what might have been...

[KLYTEMNESTRA:]
Seas of Blood, Clouds hide the Sun
The Day goes Black in my arms...
