[MUSIC BY DAVID DEFEIS &amp; EDWARD PURSINO]

[ORESTES:]
I've got the Power of God, I've got the Healing Hand
I'm hear for your Salvation, I will cleanse the Land
Turn Darkness to Light, Burn the Sun through the Night
I bear the Sword of Truth, Hatred can't dispute
NO!
I'll route the Wings of Treason, I'll possess what's mine
Storm the Gates of Madness, Conquer Death and Time
When the Black Wind blows, I will bring the Light
Wash away your Sadness and cleanse the Night

[ELEKTRA &amp; ORESTES:]
Fire and Water and Rain comes down
Underneath the Earth and Sky
You and I we will Shine like Fire on the Wings of the Storm
With the FIRE OF ECSTASY! FIRE OF ECSTASY!

[ORESTES:]
DIE!
APOLLO, DON'T FORSAKE ME!
HAVOC BRINGS OUT FURY... PILE DEATH UPON DEATH!
WAR GOD WILL CLASH WITH WAR GOD, STRIP AWAY THEIR ARMOR
WASH THE HALLS IN BLOOD!
WRAPPED IN A NET OF HATRED YOUR PRECIOUS BLOOD DID FLOW
FATHER, THEY BEAT YOU HELP US DESTROY THEM!!!

[ELEKTRA &amp; ORESTES:]
Fire and Water and Rain comes down
Underneath the Open Sky
You and I we will Shine like Fire on the Wings of the Storm

[ORESTES:]
I've got the Power of God, I've got the Healing Hand
I'm here for your Salvation, I will Rule the Land!

[ELEKTRA &amp; ORESTES:]
Fire and Water and Rain comes down
Underneath the Earth and Sky
You and I we will Shine like Fire on the Wings of the Storm
Fire and Water and Rain comes down
Underneath the Earth and Sky
You and I will Avenge our Father on the Wings of the Storm!
With the FIRE OF ECSTASY! FIRE OF ECSTASY!!!
