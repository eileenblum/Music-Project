 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[APOLLO:]
"WHEN THE FLESH OF LIFE IS RENT BY MURDER MOST FOUL,
AND THE BLOOD OF LIFE IS FREED UPON THE AIR
IT CRIES OUT IN ANGER FOR MORE BLOODSHED, THAT IS THE LAW!
HE WHO INFLICTS DEATH MUST SUFFER THE PAIN OF RETRIBUTION,
IT IS THE ANCIENT WISDOM OF THE AGES... OR..."

[ORESTES:]
Eternal Torment will strike your Heart
The Arrows of the Gods sting
Sent by Fathers who died unjust
To destroy the coward son
They visit him with Plagues - Dark Cancers of the Mind
He'll die in horror, drowning in the Waters of Acheron and Lethe...
