[ERINYES:]
Cold the Blood of an Angel, cold the Blood in my Heart
Never stand between us or lose the Mystic Art

[APOLLO:]
Die cursing the Shadows, die cursing the Light
Everything is changing except the Will to Fight

[APOLLO TO ORESTES:]
By the Rising of the Sun, you will understand this Night
In the Land where your Father died

[ORESTES:]
Into the Mighty Arms of Death
Into the Darkness we fall
Into the Mighty Arms of Death
Into the Darkness we fall

[ORESTES:]
Cold the Blood of an Angel, cold the Blood of the Sky
Everything is Fated, the Gods to me won't lie
Die cursing the Shadows, die cursing the Light
Everything is wasted, except the Will to Fight

[APOLLO &amp; ELEKTRA:]
By the Rising of the Sun, you will understand this Night
In the Land where your Father died

[ORESTES, ELEKTRA &amp; CHORUS OF SLAVES:]
Into the Mighty Arms of Death
Into the Darkness we fall
Into the Mighty Arms of Death
Into the Darkness we fall... Spirit.... Avenge... Fury... Face the Flames...

[APOLLO &amp; CHORUS:]
Come forth rise, take off your chains and fly into the Sky
Stake the Viper, Kill in turn
Fly, make an Oath to the Sky
Win your Kingdom, win the Fame of a God!!!

[ERINYES:]
Cold the Blood of an Angel, cold the Blood in my Heart
Everything is Raging, the Damned will choose their Mark

[APOLLO:]
Kill, Kill without warning, run the Blood of the Free
Fear lives on a Mountain and Ravages our Dreams
By the Rising of the Sun, you will understand this Night of Fire

[CHORUS:]
Into the Mighty Arms of Death
To the Sky we never left
Uncertain Hero you'll win the Day
Violent accounting, Fortune's array!

[ORESTES &amp; CHORUS:]
Into the Mighty Arms of Death
Into the Darkness we fall
Into the Mighty Arms of Death
Into the Darkness we fall... we fall... we fall...
In Darkness.... Descend!
