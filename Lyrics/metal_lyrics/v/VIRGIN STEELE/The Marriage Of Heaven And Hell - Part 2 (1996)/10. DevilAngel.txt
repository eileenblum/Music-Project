Rising up from the bottom of the Sea,
Cryptic eyes watching me
Daughter of the Air, Demon of the Pit,
doesn't matter what you are
Riding on that road, you know it won't be long,
Gypsy child you're mine
One foot in the grave, one hand on the wheel,
Beauty calls freedom moans

Oh your pleasure is caught by the sun
Yeah the Five Senses wed
Reason is lost be quick or your dead

DEVIL/ANGEL you move like a shark on the land
DEVIL/ANGEL the Spirityearns for Sensuality

Twin hearts glow, born of rival heat,
Beauty is the only goal
The flesh becomes the soul, eternal argument,
consummate in Nature's Style
Riding on that road, you know I'm runnin' free,
Gypsy child you're mine
Hangin' on the Cross, caught between two thieves,
Energy is Liberty !!!
Oh remember your forgotten son
Yeah celestial calm
Infernal hate, your wit will disarm

DEVIL/ANGEL you ride with the Ravens of Dawn
DEVIL/ANGEL Virtue acts from impulse not from fules

DEVIL/ANGEL we're free from Tyrannical Law
DEVIL/ANGEL the lightning is all that you need

DEVIL/ANGEL, DEVIL/ANGEL, DEVIL/ANGEL oh oh
