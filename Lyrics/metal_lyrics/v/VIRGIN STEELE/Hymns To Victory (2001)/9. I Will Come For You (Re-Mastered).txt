[Lyrics &amp; Music - David DeFeis]

Under Tortured Skies
From A Land With No Sun
I Will Come For You
From Seven Points Of Darkness
Beyond The Mountains And The Ruins
I Will Come For You
Across The Fields Of Rage And Yearning
With Power In My Hand
I Will Return, I Will Return

Once We Had Beauty Our Sun Blazed In Passion
We Lived Alive
Far From The Reaching Of Closed Minded Preaching
We Lived And Died

Now All In Darkness We Wait For The End
Hunted By Men Of The Cloth
Murder And Torture, They Rape And They Slaughter
Claiming Their Way Of The Cross

Cast Out From Eden Baptized Into Treason
With Sighless Eyes
Lost Clouds Of Reason, False Hope Burning Season
A Godless Lie

Whose God Is Stronger, Who's Made By Its Hand
Primitive Blood Stains The Sand
Murder And Torture They're Raping Your Daughter
Drunk With The Blood Of The Lamb

Fair Child Of The Desolation Cry To Me,
Under Stars That Have Died
Under Skies Of Pain We Are Born
Yeah, We Are Born, Forever We'll Be
Oh My Love I'll Defy Death And Meet On Holy Ground

Under Tortured Skies
From A Land With No Sun
I Will Come For You
From Seven Points Of Darkness
Beyond The Mountains And The Ruins
I Will Come For You
Across The Fields Of Rage And Yearning
With Power In My Hand
I Will Return, I Will Return

Now Like The Sun,
Like The Wind And The Rain
I'll Return Like A Storm,
I Will Rise Once Again
Like The Right Hand Of God,
I Will Strike From Above
'Cross The Oceans Of Time
I Am Called By Your Voice
I'll Return, I Will Return!!!
