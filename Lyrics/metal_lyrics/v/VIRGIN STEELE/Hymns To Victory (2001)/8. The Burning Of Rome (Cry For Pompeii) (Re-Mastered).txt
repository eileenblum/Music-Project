[Lyrics : David DeFeis - Edward Pursino, Music: David DeFeis]

Far From Paradise
Where The Winds Of War Are Blowing Freely
In My Tired Eyes
Run The Bloody Hosts Of Ares' Slaughter
Face To Face
With Fear And Death And Hate
Time To Say Goodbye
Draw Your Last Breath For I Conquer

When I Die In Your Arms
One Child Born To Carry On

Darling Don't Delay
For They're Rushing From A Thousand Thrones Now
Cry Another Day
When The Memory Brings You Back The Vision
Tonight I Die
But My Life Is In You
On My Way
But I Want To Touch You, Want To Love You...

When I Die In Your Arms
One Child Born To Carry On

One Nation, One Kingdom, One Child Survives
One Nation, One Kingdom, One Child Survives
I'll Meet You Again Through The Eyes Of Our Son
Remember To Tell Him The Price We Had To Pay
And Cry For Pompeii - Cry For Pompeii!

Far From Paradise
Where The Winds Of War Are Blowing Freely
In My Tired Eyes
Run The Bloody Hosts Of Ares' Slaughter
Face To Face
With Fear And Death And Hate
Burning Wraiths
Draw Your Last Breath For I Conquer

When I Die In Your Arms
One Child Born To Carry On

One Nation, One Kingdom, One Child Survives
One Nation, One Kingdom, One Child Survives
I'll Meet You Again Through The Eyes Of Our Son
Remember To Tell Him The Price We Had To Pay
And Cry For Pompeii - Cry For Pompeii!
And The Burning Of Rome!!!
Tears... Oh

I'll Meet You Again Through The Eyes Of Our Son
I'll Return
Open The Gates, I'm Coming Home Tonight
Black Tears Will Fall And The Flames Will Crack The Sky
Oh I See You Cry...
I'm Calling You... Open... I'm Coming Home...
