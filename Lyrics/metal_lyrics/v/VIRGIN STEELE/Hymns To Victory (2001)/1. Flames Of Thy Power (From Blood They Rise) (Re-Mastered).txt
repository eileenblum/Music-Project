[Lyrics &amp; Music - David DeFeis]

I Rise On The Mountain,
I Do What The Gods Disdain
Impassive Accounting,
The Ghost Of Your Yesterday

Fear Grips My Soul As I Lie Awake
Hole In The Sky For I Die

Flames Of Thy Power
You Rise With The Blood
Flames Of Thy Power
I Worship The Sun
No One Remembers Standing Proudly
Flames Of Thy Power
To Walk In The Sun Like Gods

The Cries Of Forgiveness,
The Soldiers Of Fallen Grace
The Hope Of Tomorrow,
The Ghost Of Your Yesterdays

Fear Grips My Soul As I Lie Awake
Hole In My Heart For My Crime

Flames Of Thy Power
I Worship The Sun
Flames Of Thy Power
You Rise With The Blood
No One Remembers Standing Proudly
Flames Of Thy Power
They Walk In The Sunlight Blind

Oh, What Can I Do...
I See The Silent Water Closing In Now
Blood Of Yesterday,
Crossing The Silent Waterways
I Rise Into The Skies Of Human Snow,
Hammer The Wind To Your Throne Of Truth
I See Him Shining,
Watch The Sin Pouring Down From Me!

Damn You All...

I Rise On The Mountain,
I See Through The Passage Ways
My Heart Cold And Pounding,
The Ghost Of My Yesterdays
This Is My Soul Washed By The God's Will
Daughter Of Zeus Hear My Cry

Flames Of Thy Power
I Rise With The Sun
Flames Of Thy Power
They Hunger For Blood
No One Remembers Standing Proudly
Flames Of Thy Power
To Walk In The Sunlight Shrine
