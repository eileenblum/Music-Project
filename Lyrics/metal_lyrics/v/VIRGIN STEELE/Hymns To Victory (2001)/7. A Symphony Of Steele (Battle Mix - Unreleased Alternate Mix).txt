[Lyrics &amp; Music: David DeFeis]

The Dawn Rises And With It My Anger
My Hatred Knows No Bounds
I Will End This Day In Victory...
Or Die In Agony...
But Either Way I Will Emerge Victorious
For I Laugh At Death And Fear No One
Bring On The Thunder, Bring On The Rain... It's Time
Meet Me Face To Face On The Fields Of Battle You Fuck
Or I'll Hunt You Down And Slay You Were You Hide!!!

Magick Speaks With Tongues Of Fire,
Fortune Take My Hand
Iron Pounding Songs Of Glory,
Soaring On Command
Screaming I Rejoin The Fray

Take Me Where The Thunder Walks,
A Symphony Of Steele
Take Me Where The Falcon Flies,
A Symphony Of Steele

Sound The Trumpet, Crack The Mountain,
Let The Arrow Fly
Through The Land Of Lamentation,
Let The Tidings Fly
Mercury, The God And I

Take Me Where The Thunder Walks,
A Symphony Of Steele
Take Me Where The Falcon Flies,
A Symphony Of Steele

Spark The Ashes, Free The Temple,
Stem The Crimson Tide
Toll The Bells Of Freedom Shouting
Praise For Those Who've Died
Wield The Sword Of Destiny

Take Me Where The Thunder Walks,
A Symphony Of Steele
Take Me Where The Falcon Flies,
A Symphony Of Steele
A Symphony Of Steele

If Passion Denies You,
Don't Die On Your Knees
Fight With A Vengeance
What Weakness Decrees
The Wrath Of The Tempest,
The Cries Of The Slain
Tragic In Splendor,
In Death You Are Free
I Follow The Sign,
Bring On The Sound Of Thunder,
Bring On The Rain
Spirit Of Dark Enchantment
Remember My Name!!!

Take Me Where The Thunder Walks,
A Symphony Of Steele
Take Me Where The Falcon Flies,
A Symphony Of Steele
A Symphony Of Steele

Take Me Where The Thunder Walks,
A Symphony Of Steele
Take Me Where The Falcon Flies,
A Symphony Of Steele
Take Me Where The Thunder Walks,
A Symphony Of Steele
Take Me Where The Falcon Flies,
A Symphony Of Steele
A Symphony Of Steele

A Symphony Of Steele!!!
