[Lyrics : David DeFeis, Music: David DeFeis - Edward Pursino]

There's A Place Of Gold Not Far Away
It's Across The Sky, Land Of Mist And Ice
I Will Come For You... If You're Not There
With Your Velvet Croak And Your Long Dark Hair...
Shining...

I'll Wait Now For No One But You
I'll Steal The Sun, I'll Shine It For Your Pain

Come To Me Arms Entwined In Golden Mist
To Walk Again The Sunless Halls And Crystal Caves
Beyond... Avalon... Avalon... Avalon....

I'll Wait Forever... My Child...

I'll Wait Now For No One But You
I'll Steal The Sun, I'll Shine It For Your Pain

Come To Me Arms Entwined In Golden Mist
We Will Dwell Forevermore In Crystal Caves
Beyond... Avalon... Avalon... Avalon....

There's A Place Of Gold Not Far Away
In The Fields Of Grace You Long To Stay...
Shining....
