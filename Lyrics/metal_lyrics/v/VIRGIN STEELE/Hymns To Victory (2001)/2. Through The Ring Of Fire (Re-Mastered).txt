[Lyrics &amp; Music - David DeFeis]

Guardian Of The Lies Of Faith
Darker Now This Tale Of Hate
Look Into The Eyes Of Death
Buried In Another's Flesh

Fate Guide My Hand As I Ride Hell's Wind
Hole In The Sky Where The Blackest Spirits Rage

Through The Ring Of Fire
Thorugh The Ring Of Pain
Through The Ring Of Fire,
I Am Born Again
Through The Ring Of Fire
Thorugh The Ring Of Pain
Through The Ring Of Fire,
I Am Born Again

Now You Live And Now You Die
Across The Lake Of Gorgon's Eyes
Crimson Blood, A Hero's Quest
Atone For Death With Still More Death

Hate Guides My Hand As I Smile Within
Hole In The Sky Where The Blackest Spirits Rage

Through The Ring Of Fire
Thorugh The Ring Of Pain
Through The Ring Of Fire,
I Am Born AgainThrough The Ring Of Fire
Thorugh The Ring Of Pain
Through The Ring Of Fire,
I Am Born Again

Right's On The Side Of Our Twin Thrones Of War
Bold Are The Crowns In Their Hands
Bright Are The Signs Of The Godhead
Justice Is Found Where The Proud Eagles Reign

Blind Persuasion,
Crack The Holy Tearless Eyes
Will The True Kings Return,
Thunder Greets You With A Sword

Through The Ring Of Fire,
I Am Born Again
Through The Ring Of Fire,
I Am Born Again

Guardian Of The Lies Of Faith
Harken Now This Tale Of Hate
Noble Deeds Were Done This Day
Welcome Home Your King Betrayed

Fate Guides My Hand As I Plunge This Blade
Hole In Your Heart Where The Blackest Furies Rage

Through The Ring Of Fire
Through The Ring Of Pain
Through The Ring Of Fire
I Am Born Again
Through The Ring Of Fire
Through The Ring Of Pain
Through The Ring Of Fire
I Am Born Again

Hope Is Rising With The Sound Of Our Glory
We Will See Where We Lie

Through The Ring Of Fire,
I Am Born Again
Through The Ring Of Fire,
I Am Born Again
