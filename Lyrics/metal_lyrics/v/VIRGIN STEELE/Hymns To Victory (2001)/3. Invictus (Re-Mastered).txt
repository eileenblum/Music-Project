[Lyrics &amp; Music: David DeFeis]

I Sing Of Power, Magick And Faith
A Sonnet Of Pure Victory
A Hymn To The Spirits Of Freedom And Grace
And Whichever Gods There May Be...
Manacled, Beaten, Blackened And Burned
Cast From The Light Of The Goal
I'll Never Falter, Stumble Or Kneel
Thanks To The Strength Of My Soul

Lashed By The Winds Of Fate
Stung By The Gods Of Hate
I'm Rising In Power,
I'm Rising Unchained
Call This A Sacred Vow
All That I Tell You Now
I May Be Bloody, But I Am Unbowed
I Am Power

Harken The Hour, Season And Day
Phantom Of Dark Misery
Summon Your Demons, Hunger And Hate
Spirit Of Impurity
Ravaged By Fire, Stripped And Enslaved
Torn From The World That I Know
I'll Never Cry Out, Buckle Or Kneel
I Am The King Of My Soul

Stung By The Gods Of Wrath
Blinded By Circumstance
I'm Rising In Power,
I'm Rising Unchained
All That I Tell You Now
Sure As A Sacred Vow
I May Be Bloody, But I Am Unbowed

Die, Fall On Your Sword, Fall On Your Knees
Die Like Your Son Nailed To His Tree
Die By My Hand, Die By My Sword
Right On This Site, Vultures Defile

Die, Fall On Your Sword, Fall On Your Knees
Die In The Sun Nailed To These Trees
Die By My Hand, Die In My Heart
Flung From The Heights, Forever Fall

I Sing Of Power, Magick And Might
A Sonnet Of Pure Victory
A Hymn To The Fearless, The Savage, The Brave
The Spirit Of Our Liberty
Total My Debts, Tally My Sins,
Charge Each Offence On My Scroll
I'll Never Alter The Course Of My Steele,
I Am The King Of My Soul

Lashed By The Winds Of Fate
Stung By The Gods Of Hate
I'm Rising In Power
Through Murdering Rain
Stronger Than Faith Allows
Braver Than Hero's Vows
My Head Is Bloody, But I Am Unbowed
I Am Power... Power!!!
