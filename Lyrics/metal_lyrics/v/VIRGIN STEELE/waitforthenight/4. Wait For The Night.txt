I work so hard all day long
Thinking of you girl when we're apart
'Cause these times are getting tough
A part time love just ain't good enough

I wanna be with you every day
But I just can't find the way
I got to wait for the night
To be with you and hold you tight
Once more I'll wait for the night
Making love to you tonight

Staring up at the clock waiting
Watching the minutes ticking away
Trading my time for money
There's got to be a better way

I wanna be with you every day
But I just can't find the way
I got to wait for the night
To be with you and hold you tight
Once more I'll wait for the night
Making love to you tonight

I wanna be with you every day
But I just can't find the way
I got to wait for the night
To be with you and hold you tight
Once more I'll wait for the night
Making love to you tonight
