The eyes of the Sun rise Eternal blue flame
I wait like the Wind conjuring darkâ¦
The seeds of her illness unholy rage
The Gift of a God can't be returned
The stillborn of Hell arise

Devilhead â worship the Sun?

Prophesy reeling slain for a charm
Oceans accursed, water is blood
I will endure to die
The eyes of the Sun rise molten blue pain
I lie in the Wind summoning dark
To pay for an hour of deathâ¦

Devilhead â worship the Sun?
Devilhead â worship the Sun?
Iâ¦ won't worship the sunâ¦
Cursed, forced, howlâ¦ right!

White bleeds forth from the valley, distorting night's array
Solar King glance forced brideâ¦
I am the scarâ¦ stitched through your soul
A searching  kiss Lunar betrayal

Devilhead â worship the Sun?
Devilhead â worship the Sun?
I won't worship the sunâ¦ I spit in your mouthâ¦
Fuck the sunâ¦
