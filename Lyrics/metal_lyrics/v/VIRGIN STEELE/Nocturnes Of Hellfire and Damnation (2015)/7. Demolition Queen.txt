Tangled hairâ¦
Raven rise at Midnight Eyes are black as coal
When I see her body move
You know I'm gonna lose control
Dark Pagan Magick hardline Voodoo Queen
When I see her shake her hips
The Gods they know what I mean

Win the heat of the Nightâ¦ in the gloom of the day
In the heat of the Nightâ¦
I know what you do with your loveâ¦
Lost without love, deep loveâ¦

She doesn't need redemption or supernatural grace
When I feel her sweat on me my sorrows all erase
Wild Passion â Flower a Rose so Black &amp; Blue
Dark Rebel Angel come to crucify renewâ¦

She never makes up her mind she knows what to do
She never makes up her mindâ¦
She knows what to do with her Love
Dark, dark loveâ¦ thief loveâ¦ die by love!

Your my Demolition Queen
You're the Blood &amp; Thunder Everything
She's my Demolition Queen
Gonna take her like you've never seenâ¦
Like a Heathen King

Princess of ether blaze deep underground
Never let your fire cool retain your primal crown
Climb Venus Mountain beyond this vale of tears
Glorify the Gateless Gate the farther &amp; the near

Win the heat of the Nightâ¦
In the gloom of the day
Oh in the heat of the Nightâ¦
I know what to do with your love
Dark, dark loveâ¦ Demon love

Your my Demolition Queen
Blood &amp; Fire everything
She's my Demolition Queen
Like a Raven Fire â Halloween

Damned Opheliaâ¦ love is more deathâ¦ than lifeâ¦
Take the Magick of your Soul
Where the Night wakesâ¦
On and on we flyâ¦
Through the Fields of Madness where the sun dies
Black desire fill our open eyesâ¦ nowâ¦

Pour onâ¦ all the colder tearsâ¦ Dark Windâ¦
Fill the madder lake
After the fire graves awaitâ¦
After the fire graves awaitâ¦
One Savage Dream arose
Bearing more than mortal life
Find her kneeling thereâ¦

Raven rise at Midnight eyes are blacker souls
When I see your body move
You know I'm gonna lose control
Dark Pain &amp; Magick hardline Voodoo Queen
And when I see her shake her hips
I know you know what I meanâ¦

In the heat of the Night in the gloom of the day
In the heat of the night I know what to do with your loveâ¦
Slaughterhouse Loveâ¦ deep loveâ¦

Your my Demolition Queen
Holy Blood &amp; Fire everything
Your my Demolition Queen
Like a Raven-Fire Serpent Teen
Your my Demolition Queen
Blood &amp; Fire everything

In a Cross of Fire
She is more blest deep inside, Mystic Unionâ¦
