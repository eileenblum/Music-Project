A Garden of Sin a Shining Black Twin
Callous and bruised we remainâ¦
A box of cold cheer a Cauldron of Fear
Sever the roots of Her Nameâ¦
The Soul of the Damned the flesh you demand
Gather the dead refrains
A murderer's wine, a well-versed decline
A union of morbid flame

Passing the days, pissing on graves
Hell bottom bruise displays
Mocking her God she secretly throbs
With pleasure a wound away
Pregnant and fair with cum in her hair

Ghost Flies a Holy mess
The Pattern shifts and thenâ¦
Don't fight your loneliness
Her channel gripsâ¦ and thenâ¦

Naked and wet with soul stripping sweat
She rivals the Gloom Parade
Drunk and Divine I enter her shrine
Virginal routes charade
Flowers are dead the poison has spread
Nature consumes her share
A Gala gone grim a life changing quim
The cupboard is ever bare

Basting her breasts with licorice sweat
The bloom of her youth persuades
Circle despair we're going nowhere
Sensual grooves degrade
With slippery cries her body dividesâ¦

Ghost Nights un-holiness
The Pattern shifts and thenâ¦
Don't fight your loneliness
The camera spits and thenâ¦
Blame it on the Sunrise
Blame it on the Moon's cries
Blame it on the Stars â Delirium
Blame it on the God's lies
Blame it on the Moon's spies
Blame it on the Sun â Delirium

Go forth and breathe mournful air
Drown in her cold emerald stare
Phantom desiresâ¦ no one is there!

Passing the days pissing on graves
With Wine parted lips she sprays
She'll be my Nymphet, my Lolita wet
And I'll be her Baphomet
With victory cries the moment arrives

Ghost White Her Holiness
Her Chalice grips and thenâ¦
Don't fight your loneliness
Her talent tricksâ¦ and thenâ¦
Ghost flies a Holy mess!!!
The hammer hits and then
Don't fight your loneliness
The Manna dripsâ¦ and thenâ¦

Blame it on the Sunrise!!!
Delirium!
Blame it on the Sunrise
Blame it on the Moon's cries
Blame it on the Gods â Delirium
No one's thereâ¦
No one's there, no one's there â Delirium!
Hated by the God's Wives
Hated by the noon flies
Hated by the Sun Delirium!

She said, 'It's your kind of skyâ¦ today'â¦
