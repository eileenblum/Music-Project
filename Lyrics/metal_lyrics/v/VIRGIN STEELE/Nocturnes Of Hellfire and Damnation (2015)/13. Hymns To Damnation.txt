Child Heart with Bestial Eyes
Like tears in spider webs a perfect disguiseâ¦
Down came rain like seas of bloodâ¦
Lost in Salem's Wood entombed in your eyesâ¦

Swift as the Raven's flight
To lieâ¦ here in my arms

Justice Night on Perfect Mist
In every Ring Of Cruel murder remains
Here we live like Thieves Of Blood
The beauty we conceived is never humane

Swift as a Vein Of White
To lieâ¦ here in my armsâ¦

Hymns to Damnation
Hymns to deceive
Life there's no salvation
Reign here with me!

There's no God

Hymns to Damnation
Hymns to deceive
Life there's no salvation
Reign here with meâ¦ Reign!

Dusk appears fallen like a thrown Cross
Wolvesâ¦ Magickâ¦ hungers true like our Ritualsâ¦
There is no Godâ¦ maimed here with meâ¦
Long Shadows spillâ¦
On Gallows Hill, they swing in the cold breezeâ¦
Many have diedâ¦ many too returnedâ¦
To the distant House of Death
Awful the Starsâ¦

Hymns to Damnation
Hymns to deceive
Life there's no salvation
Reign here with meâ¦
Hymns to Damnation
Hymns to disease
Lies there's no salvation
Reign here with meâ¦ Reign here with meâ¦

Bloodstained bride that darkness hides
Like terrors of the sea shipwrecked in your eyesâ¦
