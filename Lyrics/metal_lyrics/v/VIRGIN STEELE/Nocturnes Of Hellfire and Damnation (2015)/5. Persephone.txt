Danger comes from bellow
Cloven darkness glares...

Fallen... fallen like a mountain to the sea spread...
Open, writhing, bound in darkness underworld...
No... seasons just a dying enclosure...
Over, colder every moment torn and raped here
Mourning... summons crying for the new Medusa
Treason seals the torment inside her...

[Demeter:]
I will not bow to the sunrise
I will not bow to the sea
I will not bow to the moonset
Let it first bow down to me

[Hades:]
I will not welcome the dead ones 
I will not answer their plea
I will deny every Omen
'Til you bring me PERSEPHONE

Driving, blinding like a diamond storm against snow
Warring with the truth of our fallout
Cold king of charred light
Killing to the distant horizons...

[Demeter:]
I will not bow to the sunrise
I will not bow to the sea
I will not bow to the moonset
Let it first bow down to me

[Hades:]
I will not welcome the dead ones 
I will not answer their plea
I will defy every moment
'Til you bring me PERSEPHONE...
PERSEPHONE... Rise...

Black horse rise...
from the shattered underworld
Hades wakes... narcissus petals scatter...
Thunder... cracks the earth...
Blacker than hell's dominion...
Brother Gods rape... betray...

She holds the secrets of life in death...
A rose charred by lightning...
Wind torn shadows  mourn...
Cloven darkness glares...
Nothing will grow... here...
[Hades:] "Is sadness here a finite thing?" 

She screams... "Mother... Mother... Mother"...
Nothing will grow here...

[Demeter:]
I will not bow to the sunrise
I will not bow to the sea
I will not bow to the moonset
Let it first bow dawn to me

[Hades:]
I will not welcome the dead ones 
I will not thunder their plea
I will destroy every moment
'Til you bring me PERSEPHONE...
PERSEPHONE...

There'll be no sunlight... there'll be no spring...
No summer... erased... eternal winter...
Is sadness here a finite thing...?
