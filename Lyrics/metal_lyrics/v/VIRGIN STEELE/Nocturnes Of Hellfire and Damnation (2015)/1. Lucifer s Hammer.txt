Howling in mist beyond awake
Cast out the bliss over my grave
Fountain of youth you'll never taste
Wolf claw a bitch criminal grace

Higher in order to claim our prize
Under the ether we lived fought and died
Lightning below the ground patterns of all trinities
You'll remember your God's true name

Lucifer's Hammer lights up the dark
Covering the blackness there with white
Lucifer's Hammer lights up the dark
Coloring the blackness where we lie

Discordant myths you call your own
Commanding a view of Heaven's new throne
Prowling the dark plagues of desire
Prey on the weak wound driven choir

Flowers of evil your bread cross and wine
Plunder the ether to bring forth divine
Lightning above the ground talons of cold misery
You'll remember your God's true name

Lucifer's Hammer lights up the dark
Covering the blackness there with white
Lucifer's Hammer lights up the dark
Coloring the blackness where we lie

Amen
Demonize
Green words
Tranquilize
Gravity
Or perfumed skies

Wondering who mates above
Hollow eyes condemned by love
It's no surprise when I appear
Bill in hand profane austere

Lightning above the ground saddest of all trinities
You'll remember your God's true name

Lucifer's Hammer lights up the dark
Covering the blackness there with white
Lucifer's Hammer lights up the dark
Coloring the blackness where we lie
