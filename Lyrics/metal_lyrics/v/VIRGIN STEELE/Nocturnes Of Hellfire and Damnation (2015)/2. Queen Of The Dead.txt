Marching out Her servants prepare the way
An altar of blood a Symphony of Evil plays
The Earth will shake
The mountains bend and break
The air turns black
When the QUEEN OF THE DEAD walks by...

No sound, kneel down and welcome...
QUEEN OF THE DEAD
QUEEN OF THE DEAD
QUEEN OF THE DEAD

A Black array a procession of rotting flesh
A reek, a stench but at least the flowers are fresh
The crypts and tombs glow with unearthly light
A royal hell when the
QUEEN OF THE DEAD walks by...

No sound, kneel down and welcome...
QUEEN OF THE DEAD
QUEEN OF THE DEAD
QUEEN OF THE DEAD
