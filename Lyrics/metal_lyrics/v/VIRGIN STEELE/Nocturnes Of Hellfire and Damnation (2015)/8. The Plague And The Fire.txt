Sinister Goddess I love you best
Opium Child Angel Of Death
In primitive passion you fall to your knees
A slave to desire damn yourself for me

Typhoon ascends bringing Hell's Reign
Love is a Myth innocence craves

The Plague and the Fire
The Plague and the Fire
From the Plague and the Fire
From the Plague and the Fire
These gifts are mineâ¦

A Devil descending a Dream for the Eyes
Funeral Tears fall Prophets Of Crime
Heaven is stolen an eye for a thigh
Shackled in splendor disease in disguise

Valkyries of ice in the mirror of Flame
Christ is a Pagan condemned just the same

The Plague and the Fire
The Plague and the Fire
From the Plague and the Fire
From the Plague and the Fire
These gifts are mineâ¦

Night breeds Ghostly Passion Beings
And the Skies are awake!
And the Skies are awake!
Shadow Spirits beg forgiveness
After the Plague &amp; the Fire burns us
Still we knowâ¦
Evil is born in the Night
Reason is torn in the Nightâ¦

The coming of Darkness a killer for hire
An engine is burning a Black Mass of desire
No Earthly praying will return you to me
In Acheron waiting I will rape thee

The Plague and the Fire
From the Plague and the Fire
Through the Plague and the Fire
From the Plague and the Fire
These gifts are mine
Evil is born in the Night
Reason is torn in the Night

She waits for the Night â like a newborn Angel
She waits for the Night â setting Suns forever
She waits for the Night â Burning dreams

She waits for the Night â quoting Gods &amp; Devils
She waits for the Night â Drinking Souls and Seasons
She waits for the Night â drowning worlds
