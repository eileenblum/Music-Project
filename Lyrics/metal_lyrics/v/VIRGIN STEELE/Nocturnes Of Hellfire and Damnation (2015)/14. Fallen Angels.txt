Light another candle child, let me know you're here
Tortured cries in the darkâ¦ praise the Devil
Our Secret Writings are a Door
Get Closerâ¦ I'm gonna rip through
There's nothing left but griefâ¦ end law
Stare the Night awakeâ¦
Why suffer Fates yet to receive?
No one wins alive

I am one ripe with sun flies
I am one with the willfull crowd
I'm the One with the scarred wings
I'm the One with the silver shroud

Hold another mirror to your mouth, are you alive?
From where I sit they're busting outâ¦ end daysâ¦
There's nothing left when Seas cry your Name
Entombed the air snakesâ¦
Prayer is like a loanâ¦
Fools weild them your eyes roll back
And Love's doom weeps like a scar burst

I await for the Wind to follow
I await for deceit and laugh
I am one with the Reapers
I'm the One with the sin
Colored moth winged shroud

Woeâ¦ God it seems so longâ¦
Still it seems so free unloved
Like a blood embrace
Now who sleeps?
Fall I shine!!!

One by oneâ¦ Nations march outâ¦ One by one

Hallowed at lastâ¦
I will drive the Wind through the Pines
I just want to be a moving Shout
Nothing comes between Oblivionâ¦ followâ¦
She feels freeâ¦ beyond pain
And Winter comes to greet meâ¦ I'm closer nowâ¦
