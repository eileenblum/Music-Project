A flame leaps from the altar
The voices chant together
A hooded figure screams
His love for Satan's Daughter
Blasphemous words maniacal thirds
A concerto composed in hell
An overturned cross a virgin is forced
An unholy revelry

Black Mass - Satan's Free - Ohhh 
Black Mass - Satan's Free - Ohhh 

With prayer they try to conjure
The presence of their master
Their eyes and bodies writhe
The demon drums beat faster
The high priest will rise and thrust in the thighs
Of the woman upon the altar
Consecrating the host
in her bodies most intimate orifices

Black Mass - Satan's Free - Ohhh 
Black Mass - Satan's Free - Ohhh 

Nocturana - Voluptua - Lascivia
Cold Morgana, Blasphema...
Lucifer's Rising, Lucifer's Rising
Life is reviving... under the Black Sun...
In nomine Satanus La gallina e cacare
Malleus mallificariim e crimini magi e udiquiem
aguaia malleficia.
Discutium... RISE!!!!!

Black Mass - Satan's Free - Ohhh 
Black Mass - Satan's Free - Ohhh 
A sacrifice... Satan's free a sacrifice...
Black Mass!!!!

Lucifer's Rising... come Nocturana my love
In the dusk we'll play forever free...
