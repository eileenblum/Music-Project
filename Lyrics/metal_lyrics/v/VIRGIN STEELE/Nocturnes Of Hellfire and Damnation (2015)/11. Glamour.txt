Nevermoreâ¦
Hell walks with flairâ¦
She screams that it's urgent, all smack and cocaine
She smiles like a secret and asks me to tame
Her wayward divisions a beast with no name
Demanding I enter the Halls of the Slain
Nevermore will I sleep, nevermore awakenâ¦

Counterfeit memories my lover of games
Seducing the Spirits of fools with her flame
I wandered in madness years killed in vain
Until I remembered the wisdom of pain
Fascination â evil eye â malocchio
Vampire law

Glamourâ¦ Whoreâ¦ down come the flies
Glamour â cold withered leaves
Glamour â A Season in Hell
Glamour â Whore-brides wear your veilsâ¦

Feast on my heart bewitch frozen fire
Welts rising we trace the History of Us
Wrought iron destruction
Temptation her cryptic refrainâ¦
Delirious Summer lost under the grain
Dead drunk in the mourning high on Wolfsbaneâ¦
Barbarian slainâ¦

Vampire Lawâ¦ Maleficia!

Moreâ¦ â¦drawn by the blood
Glamour Whore â down come the flies
Glamour â A Season in Hell
Glamour â remorse after death?

Birth's a stillborn equation Life's an un-shed tear
Death walks in stealthy invasion
Lashing her timeless shears
Smoke rings and ashesâ¦ the hours betrayedâ¦
With Love and with Hatred my Music is made
Fascination â evil eyeâ¦
Nevermore will I sleep, nevermore awakenâ¦
