[LILITH:]
While the Sea is burning Red...
They've found me here... bitter time...

[BLACK ANGELS:]
How to bleed a Noble Brow...
To catch them all where I hide...

[LILITH:]
For now I sleep in Hell far, far from Light
God will never heal our vast despite
To fight against this crime
I'll find my way...

[BLACK ANGELS:]
While the Rivers overflow
To murder more but not to die...
When your Shapes of Doom arise
We'll kill your Sons... they will die...

[LILITH:]
NO!!! The Sins of their Father's I will assail
Where you lie sleeping the Ghost of Life

[BLACK ANGELS:]
NO... you will remain here
He'll make you return

[LILITH:]
But I will not answer, for I know the Words...
Yes I know the Name!!!

High Above where the Sunlight rips the Sea
I am Free!
I will Kill for I'm Holier than Thou
I am Wise!

[BLACK ANGELS:]
Your God's not forgiving
He'll leave you in shame

[LILITH:]
But I know the one Charm
For I know the Name! Yeow! Be gone!

[BLACK ANGELS:] Remember your Passion, remember your Oath

[LILITH:]
Remember your answer
For this is not real... no this is not real!!!

High Above where the Sunlight rips the Sea
I am Free!
I will Kill for I'm Holier than Thou
I will rise!

[BLACK ANGELS:] Cry out for Mercy he'll leave you in chains
[LILITH:] The Black Winter Forest is calling my Name!!!

High Above where the Sunlight rips the Sea
I am Free!
I will rise like the Hammer of the Sky
Armed with Wine...
I will Kill for I'm Holier than Thou
I am wise...
I will rise like the Hammer of the Night
ALL WILL DIE!

Negoium Perambulans Ini Tenebris...
Ahhh... kill...
