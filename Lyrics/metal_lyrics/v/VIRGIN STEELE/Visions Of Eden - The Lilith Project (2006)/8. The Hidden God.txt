[SAMAEL:]
I AM HERE! OH YES!!!
And the Dark Waters stirred with the sound of her calling
Wrapped in Black Luminescence &amp; Clouds I appear
Feel me plunder in sleep where nobody knows
I am calling you back!

Blood to Blood, Bone to Bone
Skin to Skin and Sin to Sin
Demon Night, Frost and Fire
Turn me on to Rape Desire

Spill the Blood of your kin
Rejoice in the Madness you win
Wallowing into the Fire
Drawn to my Hellish Mire
THE HIDDEN GOD..HIDDEN GOD...

In your eyes I can see where the Thunder is calling
Storm Clouds gather a Feast for the Wrecking of you
Drip your blood on the shaft of my swollen desire
That's burning &amp; yearning to blister your womb
I am calling you back...

Blood to Blood, Bone to Bone
Skin to Skin and Sin to Sin
Demon Night, Frost and Fire
Turn me on to Rape Desire

Spill the Blood of your King
Rejoice in the Madness it brings
Wallowing into the Fire
Drawn to my Hellish Mire
Dishonored and cast from the Sun
Straight into my Arms you will run
Nurturing insults and grief
Embracing new forms of believe

For the Soul of a Black Dragon King
For the Heartache &amp; Madness you bring
I harrow the Vines of your bleeding
To the One who will know from before
To notice the Way that blights your way home
I cry to the One who's in Chains

[LILITH:] I cry to the One who's in Flame

[SAMAEL:] Forget how you fell... Paradise is something to Fear

[LILITH &amp; SAMAEL:] Paradise is... Fear!!! AHHH!!!

[SAMAEL:]
I am the Darkness that lives in the Sea...
From Rocks I have ripped bleeding Darkness to warm you
Rend your garments tear your hair... open wide... I AM IN!!!
Nobody **cks like you anymore... Let's cum together

And the Dark Waters stirred with the sound of her calling
Wrapped in Black Luminescence &amp; Clouds I appear
Feel me plunder in sleep where nobody knows
I am calling you back!
Back to the Wolves...

Blood to Blood, Bone to Bone
Skin to Skin and Sin to Sin
Demon Night, Frost and Fire
Turn me on to Rape Desire

Spill the Blood of your King
Rejoice in the Madness it brings
Wallowing into the Fire
Drawn to my Hellish Mire
Days of Darkness and Fear
Let your Talons appear
I will bring you Hatred's Sire
The Wine the Planets Conspire
