[GOD:]
When first there was Fire, Water and Air
All boiling together, a mass of despair
Enthroned in the Maelstrom, hurling Atoms with Night
My Thought pierced the Tempest...
Now let there be Light!
Born in Fire, Earth &amp; Dust
Born in Sun to be the Savior, Savior...

[ADAM:]
IMMORTAL I STAND
Before God A Man
Immortal &amp; Brave no Fear of the Grave
I will reveal the Flesh in your Word... IMMORTAL I STAND!

[GOD:]
Watch as I fashion Him from the Dust
Born in my Image, Endowed with my Trust
A living reflection of higher ideals
Sublime perfection... Adam Revealed

Born of Fire, Earth &amp; Clay
Born in Sun to Rule The Day

[ADAM:]
IMMORTAL I STAND
Before God A Man
Immortal &amp; Brave no Fear of the Grave
I will reveal the Flesh in your Word... IMMORTAL I STAND!

[GOD:]
"No Fear of the Grave, no fear of the Dark,
All Life from a Spark
The Rites of the Son, the Dream Flesh begun,
A Union of One..."

Summon the Mighty Forms below...
Enter the silent streets to save us... save us

[ADAM:]
IMMORTAL I STAND
Before God A Man
Immortal &amp; Grand the Soul of your plan

[GOD:]
"The Son is the Eye and Soul of the World
My voice resides within!!!

[ADAM:]
