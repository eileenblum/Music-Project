[EVE:]
The Sins are bare and War resounds...
Blood runs like Gold
The Days grow long, The Death of Hours now
I can't fight no more...
To run like Stone through the Streets alone
His Eyes follow now...

"I WILL BURN THIS PLACE"
"NOW DEATH CALLS HERE"!!!

WHEN DUSK FELL - I saw you dead on the ground
AS DUSK FELL - Black Lightning falls in the Shades now... Burn...

A Thousand years have come and gone
You've lost your Golden wings...
What was so bright, silent Tears for Night
I've found this has no Name...
I run these Streets blinded by a Love
Why I do not know...
I see your Face staring back through Time
Blood runs from my Soul...

I WILL BURN YOUR BLACK HEART!

AS DUSK FELL - I will remember all this
AS DUSK FELL - I still remember your Kiss
WHEN DUSK FELL - White as the Snow
Black Lightning struck on the ground now...

I'll burn your Heart... I'll burn your Fate...

WHEN DUSK FELL - I saw you dead on the ground
AS DUSK FELL - White as the Snow
Black Lightning runs from Above
WHEN DUSK FELL - I will remember all this...
WHEN DUSK FELL - White as the Snow
I will remember all this now...

Fear... all Graves become One here... all Graves become One here...

WHEN DUSK FELL - I saw you dead on the ground
WHEN DUSK FELL - White as the Snow
Black Wolves did light on the ground
WHEN DUSK FELL - I still recall every Wish...

WHEN DUSK FELL - "Black Wolves devoured the Town"
WHEN DUSK FELL...
AS DUSK FELL.."Black Wolves burned Night on their Crowns"
WHEN DUSK FELL...
Rising to the Streets Below... WHEN DUSK FELL, Black Lightning calls...
Remember, remember, remember...
