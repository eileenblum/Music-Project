[LILITH:]
Why should I become the Dark Queen
And how shall I become this Black thing
My Holy Blood turned to bitterness
Before the first Oceans... or the Mountains were born
I stood beside Your with Wisdom Adorned
Our Sacred Vows made Earth's Kingdom rise...

I am the trees woven in through the sky
I am the Law of the Love that can't die
Caressed by the Clouds I walk with Wind &amp; Stars

I ordered the paths of the Black Sun &amp; the Moon
But Now I am vanquished oh... raped, ravaged &amp; ruined
Wild and Untamed I roamed the Earth free
Your Virgin Mary is only a Shadow of me

Is this your Will... oh... my Violation?
Nature betrayed Love's Immolation

GOD ABOVE GOD, release me from this Fate
GOD ABOVE GOD release me from all this Rage
Or My Sword shall drink much Blood in the Heavens
Your Angels will know the Rage of Creation
Why should I become this?
How shall I ever become clean?
Oh become clean again? Never... oh you're murdering me...

Now nothing remains of my works but burnt stone
My voice is stilled... division is sown
What once was Self is now Enemy
Rape, Force and Violence are your new Trinity

Is this your Will Divine Emanation?
Nature betrayed Love's Immolation... Annihilation...

GOD ABOVE GOD, release me from this Fate
GOD ABOVE GOD release me from all this Rage
Or My Sword shall drink much Blood in the Heavens
Your Angels will know the Rage of Creation
Why should I become this?
How shall I ever become clean?
Oh become clean... You have murdered me... Why do you hate me?
For all of your Passion, all your Fate
you come to death knowing one massive hate
