[By D. DeFeis and J. Starr]

[1st verse:]
Oh people, your darkness hath come.
Oh no, they've blackened the sun.
The night was cold, but now it burns hot.
You may cry till tomorrow, but I'd rather not.

[1st chorus:]
Oh come with me into the Danger Zone
Oh come with me into the Danger Zone
Give up the fight for your ruined home
To the Danger Zone!

[2nd verse:]
Oh lepers and beasts stalk the night
Blinded, confused by weird lights
My Love come, let's walk to the sea.
The Heavens will shine, on you and on me.

[2nd chorus:]
Come with me into the Danger Zone
Oh come with me into the Danger Zone
Live for the Night, you'll sit by the throne
To the Danger Zone!

[Bridge:]
Let's take our place, with spectral lights
And the blissful sound of wings.
The Kingdom is willing, to let our love in
And grant us the peace we both deserve.

[2nd chorus]
[repeats:]
Come with me into the Danger Zone
Oh come with me into the Danger Zone
Live for the Night, you'll sit by the throne
To the Danger Zone!
