[By: D. DeFeis and J. Starr]

[1st verse:]
The night erupts and spits its refuse out
"We've no regard for you life," they gleefully shout.
They uleash their hell, and wait on the great beasts call.
Ooh I wanna break the spell, and send those wretches to hell

[1st chorus:]
But. Satan tolls his bell, you all know too well.
It's a Life of Sin.
Just a Life of Sin.
Evil lurks in the wind.
In this Life of Sin, and you can never win,
When you're Living in Sin.
(Ooh, I'm gonna get ya.)

[2nd verse:]
Angelic demons try to blind me with their lies,
But noting escapes me I'm far too wise.
A silvery scream, rips the thread of the night.
Ooh, watch out for me, there's gonna be a hell of a fight.

[2nd chorus:]
But. Satan tolls his bell, it's time to say farewell. cos
It's a Life of Sin, just your Life of Sin.
Do you think you can win,
In your Life of Sin?
No! You can never win, when you're Living in Sin.

[3rd verse:]
Oh prostitution, is that you're final solution.
Crime in the streets make you cower in fear.
Our world is dying, the Demon is rising
You know th answer, come on let's go.

[3rd chorus:]
But. Satan tolls his bell, you all know too well.
It's a Life of Sin, just a Life of Sin.
Dis you think you could win,
In your Life of Sin?

No. You can never win, when you're Living in Sin.
No. Never win when you're Living in Sin.
Never win when you're Living in Sin.
