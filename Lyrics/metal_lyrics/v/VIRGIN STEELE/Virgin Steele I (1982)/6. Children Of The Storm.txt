[By D. DeFeis and J. Starr]

The wicked wind is howling and it's screaming out my name
Above the ring of fire, the necromancer reigns

With thunder and lightning, he enforces his command
Of evil, lust and violence, destruction rules the land

[Chorus:]
Children of the Storm
On and on we run
Children of the Storm
Trying to find the sun

With wrathful hearts we've scaled the fortress
Whose summits reach the sky
In vain we roared and were defeated
His majesty reigns high

Weeping and wailing, another maiden dies
In the wind and ice we gather
To blast this demon from the sky

[Chorus:]
Children of the Storm
On and on we run
Children of the Storm
Trying to find the sun

[Bridge:]
Shadows fly past, but the Black Knight holds fast
And I'll trust in the strength of my song
Over the edge went the dark flame of dread,
And it's all in the strength of my hand

[Chorus:]
Children of the Storm
On and on we run
Children of the Storm
Trying to find the sun

Children of the Storm
On and on we run
Children of the Storm
Trying to find the sun

Keep on your guard, trust in the sword,
Face, face, the Flame, oh face the Flame!!
