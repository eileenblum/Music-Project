[By D. DeFeis and J. Starr]

[1st verse:]
I can't stop crying, since you've been gone
You know we've loved for so long
And I'll always feel something
That love was so strong
And I wish I knew what went wrong, baby.

[Chorus:]
Cos I still in love with you
Oh, oh, still in love with you
Yea, I still in love with you
And I don't know just what to do.

[2nd verse:]
I wonder what you're doin tonite girl.
Are you holding someone tight?
(The way you used to hold me)
I wish you could love me and want to be mine
Take me in your arms and keep me from crying, crying, cryin all the time

[Chorus:]
Cos I still in love with you
Oh, oh, still in love with you
Yea, I still in love with you
And I don't know just what to do.

[Bridge:]
Even the wind, whispers to me your memory
Fires of love, that burned so bright
Fade with the night.
And leave me cold and all alone.

[Ad libs:]
All alone - where did ya go?
You really don't remember.

[Chorus:]
Cos I still in love with you
Oh, oh, still in love with you
Yea, I still in love with you
And I don't know just what to do.
