[1st verse:]
I got pictures on you baby
I'm gonna turn em loose
Oh, don't you cry honey
I'm gonna cook your goose, yeah.

[2nd verse:]
Well, I ain't mean, it's just that you've been bad.
And you're makin, you're makin me, oh so mad

[Chorus:]
How would you mama like it?
How would your daddy take it?
To see you lyin naked
Right on my bead, ha ha

Watch the birdie baby, I'm taking one more shot!!
Stop that naggin noise, etc.
