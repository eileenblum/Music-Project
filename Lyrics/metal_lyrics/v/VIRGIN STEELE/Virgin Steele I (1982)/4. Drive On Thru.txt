[By J. Starr]

[1st verse:]
Ya got no friends, and ya got no money
And no one wants to know you
And no one calls you honey
And there's nothing going right, and you're running out of time

[Chorus:]
There's only one thing left, that you can do
That's drive on, drive on, drive on thru.
There'll always be one car in front of you.

[2nd verse:]
When the world gets you down and no one comes around,
You're out on your own, and you can never go home
There ain't no fun, now ya got to run.

[Chorus:]
There's only one thing left, that you can do
That's drive on, drive on, drive on thru.
There'll always be one car in front of you.

[Chorus repeat:]
There's only one thing left, that you can do
That's drive on, drive on, drive on thru.
There'll always be one car in front of you.
