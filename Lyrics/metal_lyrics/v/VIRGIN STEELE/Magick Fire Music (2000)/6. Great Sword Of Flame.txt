 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[KLYTEMNESTRA:] Iron sounds sear the wound
Hungry screams fill the Air
Kindred Blood, Infant Blood, Child-Flesh for their Feast
Judgment Falls on the Son
Judgment Falls on the King
Storm of Blood Raging Free
Taste the Blood on my Hands
[KLYTEMNESTRA &amp; AIGISTHOS:]
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Split the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Rip the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
[KLYTEMNESTRA:]
Open Veins, Tear his Heart, Rip the eyes from his head
Under God, under Siege bind their Souls to deceit
Vengeance wrought BY THE GODS, Forged in Sin
Forged by me!!!
Seer and Whore, Thunder Lord
Why should I Weep for Thee
[KLYTEMNESTRA &amp; AIGISTHOS:]
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Split the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Rip the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky 
[AIGISTHOS:] 
I am Born from the Blood of the Feast
She is Born from the Altar of Sacrifice
We are Judgment, Jury and Executioner
Dark instruments of Divine Vengeance, Violence and Justice
Children's Blood, Virgin Blood Anoints Our Sovereignty
Weep now and Atone!
[KLYTEMNESTRA:]
OH! She'll embrace you in Hades!
Black Cloud of Slavery, oh...Silver sided Death 
[KLYTEMNESTRA &amp; AIGISTHOS:]
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Split the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Rip the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Split the Night
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME-Rip the Night ,GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in the Sky, 
GREAT SWORD OF FLAME in =he Sky, GREAT SWORD OF FLAME!!! GREAT SWORD OF FLAME!!!
