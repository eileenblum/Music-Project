 BY DAVID DEFEIS]

[KLYTEMNESTRA:] I rejoiced as he rained crimson dew on my hands and face...
From the Depths of my Soul...I Hate thee...
Defiler of this House...Defiler of Innocent lives...
[AGAMEMNON:]
Zeus I am struck...a deep mortal wound
Zeus here I die in the Land of my Birth
Where is my Son?
Where's my reward
For services rendered in your Sacred Name...
I'm coming Home...
