[ELEKTRA:]
There's a Rainbow, cover it in Blood
There's no Light upon my door
There's a Cold Wind, Rising from the Sea
There is Death and nothing more...
But don't turn away with eyes of the blind
There's still Magick in your Soul
There is Magick still...

[ELEKTRA &amp; ELDERS:]
Iron Walls and Chains surround us
Yet we are Proud and Free
Nothing Kills the Ties that Bind us
I'll meet you at the GATE OF KINGS!!!

[ORESTES "in phocis":]
There's a Silence tearing up the ground
Freezing Heart and Shield and Bone
In their grasp I see you as you lay
Broken, cold beneath their Rage
We won't turn away with eyes of the blind
There's still Magick in our Souls
There is Magick still...

[ALL:]
Iron Walls and Chains surround us
Yet We are Proud and Free
Nothing Kills the Ties that Bind Us
I'll meet you at the GATE OF KINGS... THE GATE OF KINGS...

[ALL:]
Iron Walls and Chains surround us
Yet We are Proud and Free
Nothing Kills the Ties that Bind Us
I'll meet you at the GATE OF KINGS
[Repeat]
