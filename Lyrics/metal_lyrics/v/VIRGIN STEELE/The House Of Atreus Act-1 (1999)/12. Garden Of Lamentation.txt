[ELEKTRA:]
Skies of War, Skies of Peace
Who will answer when you weep
I remember you like a child
You were fair in my arms
As I walked through the Flames of our Love

Solemn Night all is Grey
Who will answer, none will say
I recall every Phase of HER Hearts Living Blaze
I remember YOU like a child
You were fair in my arms...
As I walked through the Flames of our Love
