[Music: De Feis/Pursino, lyrics: De Feis]

Meet me in the darkness 
Upon the edge of town 
I'll be waiting there in silence
Let your long hair flow on down 
lt doesn't matter whac went wrong 
It doesn't matter anymore 
Just hold me in your love child 
We'll open up the door 

I've waited a lifetime (babe)
For the answer 
(A love without war) 

[Chorus:]
Wild Fire, woman of mine 
With your head in the clouds 
And your heart on the line 
Wild Fire, she's a woman in love
With a passion that burns 
like a (river of love) 

Don't tell me that tomorrow
Won't right you on your way 
Above the realm of sorrow 
A new dawn breaks today 
I stiil want you by my side 
Wanna have you near 
Just hold me in your love child
There won't be any fear 

[Pre-Chorus] 
(To ride with the wind) 

[Chorus] 
(heaven above) 
... Oh, my babe... 
Meet me in the darkness 

On the edge of town.
