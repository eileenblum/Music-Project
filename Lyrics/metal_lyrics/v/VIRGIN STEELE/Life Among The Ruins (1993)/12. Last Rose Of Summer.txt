[Music &amp; lyrics: De Feis]

There like an angel 
A vision of light 
The last rose of Summer 
The last Rose of Summer 
Bloomed in my sight 

Alone with the wind 
And the sun in her hair 
I've never seen anything so fair 

And you're all I need 
All I need... 

Our love will never die 
I walk with you, 
Last Rose of Summer's day
Make love to me 

Wake with the sunrise 
When dreams walk the sky 
She whispers, "I love you" 
Then sings, laughs and cries 

A song of emotion
Borne of angel wings 
Free as the seasons 
Where love eternal springs

And you're all I need
All I need... 

Our love will never die 
I walk with you, 
Last Rose of Summer's day
Make love to me 

...Sweet love
Don't cry no more
I'm with you babe...
