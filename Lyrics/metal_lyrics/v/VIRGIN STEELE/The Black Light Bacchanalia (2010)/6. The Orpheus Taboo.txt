I have dreams of fallen Gods
When darkness screams and light dissolves
A Word, a Law a doomed command
But not for me, my Will demands...

Ghost colored rainbows appear to deceive
In an act of defiance I vow to conceive

Open your eyes, open alive
Burned in the wind your death will be birth
Open your eyes open a lie
Savior within there is nothing to keep me here...

I believe in what I am
One part God alone and the Flesh of Immortal Man
Spirit healing Nature's cries
Torn from Star Winged Worlds
and the breath of a Titan's soul...
I am falling to the Sun,
bleeding hours born of none

Far beyond knowledge all thought, sight and speech
Blessed with rage and defiance in every heartbeat...

Open your eyes open alive
Burned in the wind (but) your death will be birth
Open your eyes open a lie
Save your within there is nothing to keep me here...
keep me here... keep me here... keep me here...

One Forbidden Thing
The One Forbidden Ring
One Vow to break...
When Lightning laughs and Death is chaste
to kiss the Green World awake...

Man equals God... The Age Of The Hero Is Mine...

God is not apart...
Divinity within and without

One Forbidden Door
The One Forbidden Shore
One Path to take...
To lift the Veil and taste the Fruit
To touch the Bark while Awake

I put forth my hand... I take from the Tree
Fuck you I will not look back...
The Age Of The Hero is mine... self create...

I have dreams of fallen Gods
When Laughter screams... light dissolves...

Open your eyes open alive
Burned in the wind your death will be birth
Open your eyes open a lie
Save your great sin
there is nothing to keep me here...

The Age Of The Hero is mine...
