Come to me like Water
Come to me from the depths of the Moonlight
Come to me my Daughter
Lay with me like the White Rose of Summer
Come child, love child
Night drowns in your arms...

Fire, Communion the Serpent Divine
These are the bonds of Glory...
The Eye of the Mystic
Her Flesh is the Wine these are the bonds we share

Under the Sea, under the Sky
Hell in the boundless Air
Magick denied, Love crucified
Heaven is seared where Faith resides

TO CROWN THEM WITH HALOS - they come and they come
TO CROWN THEM WITH FIRE - their Black work is done
TO CROWN THEM WITH HALOS - they come and they come
TO CROWN THEM WITH FIRE - their Black work is done in the Night

Black Superstition a Cauldron of Crime
These are the Scars of Glory
Savage desires are bound into the Savior's Shroud

Cast from the wall ravished by all
Death wears a coward's face
Torn from your Throne, raped to the bone
Heaven is Fear disguised as Life

TO CROWN THEM WITH HALOS - they come and they come
TO CROWN THEM WITH FIRE - their Black work is done
TO CROWN THEM WITH HALOS - they come and they come
TO CROWN THEM WITH FIRE - their Black work is done in the Night???

Walk through the fire yearning for all your life
Pain never ending, Heaven is breathing Fire
Proud Rebel Angel at War with a future Saint
Blaze like a Beacon for all of us here in Hell...
oh, my Lyzebel...

Angel of Fire
They're burning your tears alive
Where is thy God?
Thorns for your marriage bed...

Counterfeit Myths, Blood from a Kiss
Heaven is Fear disguised as Life

They Thunder the Music of Hatred
they worship the Song of the Nails
They delight in the sound of disaster,
the blood, the lies and the wails...
Their passage has no true fixed center
all their horizons default to a line
Their God is incensed, his anger unquenched
His cruelty is truly Divine...

Come to me like Water
Come to me with the death of the Moonlight
Come to me my Daughter
Lay with me in the ashes of summer
Run child, blood child, with shrouds for your charms...

TO CROWN THEM WITH HALOS - they come and they come
TO CROWN THEM WITH FIRE - their Black work is done
TO CROWN THEM WITH HALOS - they come and they come
TO CROWN THEM WITH FIRE - their Black work is done in the Night
