I know you I taste your essence
With the Blackness of my mind
Pain is me and I'm relentless
The wedding bells of death now chime
In the darkness of your mourning
All your treasures become mine

A living flame
Will be your star to follow
Stolen Splendor I am there...
BY THE HAMMER OF ZEUS AND THE WRECKING BALL OF THOR!!!

Black is my heart in spite of the dawn
Black is my soul with fear, force and malice
I bring the sun out of the dark
Rabid and sharp you'll fell the madness
From my black dead world

Evil winds blow on the water
Fill your mouth with poison wine
All behold the arts of murder
The seven winds of Anu cry
Thunder, spear and sacred iron
Set a course for Man divine

The mountain flame will be your star to follow
Golden splendor... I am there...
BY THE HAMMER OF ZEUS AND THE WRECKING BALL OF THOR!!!

Black is my heart in spite of the dawn
Black is my soul with fear, force and malice
I bring the sun from out of the dark
Rabid and sharp you'll fell the madness
From my black dead world

Savage I start to tear out your eyes
The Gods swarm like flies in the starlight...
True flesh is born to rape Ancient forms
A grave for your world where the God light
Tears your soul

I am the son of the sun, I am the wreaker of pain
I am the son of the sun born to no one
I am the wreaker of pain
Nothing remains of your world...

Savage I start to tear out your eyes
The Gods swarm like flies here on my sacrifice
Kingship has come to Heaven's new son
A grave for your world as starlight bleeds you gold

I know you I claim your essence
In the Blackness of my mind
Pain is me and I'm relentless
The wedding bells of death now chime

The Golden Hawk will be your star to follow
Throne of fire I am there...

BY THE HAMMER OF ZEUS AND THE WRECKING BALL OF THOR!!!
BY THE HAMMER OF ZEUS AND THE WRECKING BALL OF THOR!!!
BY THE HAMMER OF ZEUS AND THE WRECKING BALL OF THOR!!!

Black is my heart in spite of the dawn
Black is my soul with fear, force and malice
I bring the sun form out of the dark
Rabid and sharp you'll fell the madness
From my black dead world
