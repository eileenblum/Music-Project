[SAMAEL:]
You'll never know how much I hate thee
Child born of wind, Goddess born to sin
I gave you life...
You'll never know how much I hate thee
Blast your Seven Heads, blast your Seven Hills
And Twelve Horned Crown

They're getting too wise
They've learned to devise
Send them the floor of the flame...
They eat THE BREAD OF WICKEDNESS
It's in their eyes, it's in their eyes God
Eat THE BREAD OF WICKEDNESS
It's in their eyes, it's in their eyes God

Take them God
Your daughters rape them
Ravish them with grief
How can there be peace
With such as these...
Harlots both disobey You!
Multiply their pains!
Make sex and death the same
In every Eye...

They've stolen Your Fire
They've vanquished the dawn
They've taught those
To worship the moonrise
Cast them in chains, release now your flame
But first one more taste 'fore they drown

They eat THE BREAD OF WICKEDNESS
It's in their eyes, it's in their eyes God
Eat THE BREAD OF WICKEDNESS
It's in their eyes, it's in their eyes God
