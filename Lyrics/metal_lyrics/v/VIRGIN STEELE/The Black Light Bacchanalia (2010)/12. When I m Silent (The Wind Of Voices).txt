[Bonus track]

Oh...beyond all words...
And when you rape me don't ask me what's wrong
And when you Burn my World I won't make a sound
Breathe in the Silence and find yourself alone
To take the Lie and make it Gold
To feed the Fire as it Burns your Soul
You can't recover the Life you've had before

Take my Hand we'll be as One
We'll come together in our shared pain
For There will be nothing but an empty face
When we're Silent... Silent Cold and Dead...

The Wind of Voices Haunts our Tomb
This Hate is Your Child alone in this Room
The Claws of Green Fate anoint your bitter tears
To take the knife and stab your dreams
To cauterize remorseless screams
You'll remember thins you might have done

Take my Hand we'll be as One
Run forever from the Sunrise
There will be nothing but an empty face
When we're Silent, Lord I'm Violent, Soul Divided...
run the other way, run the other way...

Every living thing recalls your name
Every living thing reflects your shame
Say the Word...say the Words...

And bleed yourself now, you bleed for yourself
After the Rain ascends now...
I call your name, call your Name, I call your Name, call your Name...over and over...

Take my Hand we'll be as One
Run forever in the Darkness
They'll be nothing but an empty face
In the Silence, Lord I'm Violent, Soul Divided...
run the other way...

Take my Hand we'll be as One
Run forever through the Darkness
They'll be nothing but an empty face
When we're Silent, Silent Cold and Dead... Oh Dead... Cold &amp; Dead...
Beyond all Hope, beyond all Fear...
Every little bitter breath, every little bitter vreath...
The Face inside the Star...
