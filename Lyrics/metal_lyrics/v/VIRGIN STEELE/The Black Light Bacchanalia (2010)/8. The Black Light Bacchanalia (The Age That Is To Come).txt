Green fires glow in a Sepulchral Sky
Summoning Hell with the blink of an eye
Cast into bondage a Devil will drive
The Spirit of Evil Eternally thrives

13 incisions with plague burning Black
A casket of wet chilled air
Slashing the Skies and plundering Dark
An Ocean of Blood filled Prayer

Unending Fire and unending might
Melting the Life from the Dawn
Raising a Hell where your Heaven had been
A stain in the Heart of the Rose
For The Age That Is To Come...

Vampire mist here the Moon driven cry
Chained to the rack - Heaven moans &amp; dies
Heretic gospels the maimed reply
Dead voices whisper the word defy

Night Ravens call Century's wound
A Crescent of Star Crossed Fear
Brimstone revisions of house the quick
Blood &amp; a Cross to bear

Unending Fire and unending might
Melting the Life from the Dawn
Raising a Hell where your Heaven had been
A stain in the Heart of the Rose
For The Age That Is To Come...
For The Age That Is To Come...
For The Age That Is To Come...

Green fires glow in a Sepulchral Sky
Thundering Visions of Hell arrive
Cold liquid bells summon lies
A City of the Damned cries

A frenzy of feeding, the judgment of sharks
The Spire, the Gallows, the Wheel
Ravage their bodies to savor their souls
An Orphan of Death's Despair

Unending Fire and unending might
Melting the Life from the Dawn
Raising a Hell where your Heaven had been
A stain in the Heart of the Rose
For The Age That Is To Come...
For The Age That Is To Come...
For The Age That Is To Come...
