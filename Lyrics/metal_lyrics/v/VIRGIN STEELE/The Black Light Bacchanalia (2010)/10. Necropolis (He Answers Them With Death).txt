Seek them on each mountain range
On every hill...under each tree
Tear down their pillars and shrines
Burn every thing leave none alive...

Run thru the city and kill everyone inside - (I hear your voice)
Put to the sword all the young and the old alike - (I hear your voice)
Shatter their temples their idols of gold
Light up the Darkness with Crosses of Souls

When she says, ...Father am I not your own...?
And he says, ...Father what's it like upon your throne...?
HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Black Winter on their eyes
HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Great Liar of the Skies
He Answers them...

Murder and torture 'til even the sunlight cries
Burn them to ashes and don't let their Spirits rise
Uncrown their Kings make their virgins your slaves
Rape their Moon Goddess let no one be saved

When she says, ...Father open up your soul...
And he says, ...Father what's it like to be so cold......?

HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Black Winter on their eyes
HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Great Liar of the Skies...
HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Stacked victims brutalized
HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Great Tyrant of the skies...

Oh no, I'll not forsake my name
To live in the bonds of unreason and suffer each day...
Only to die stillborn...

Out Father who's surely not in Heaven
Unhallowed be all thy Names (No...)
Thy Kingdom will not come (I'll offer fires high)
Thy Will...will not be done
Not on this Earth, not in any Heaven...
Forever and Ever...Ahhh...Womb men...

Eat the dust all the days of your life...
...crawl on your belly...
Enmity between your seeds bruising the head and heel
Man return to the Dust from which you are made
The Dust is the Earth, is the Mother...
...so they return to Her...not the Father...

Our Father what truth's have you been told,
What truth's do you uphold,
What fear have you been sold?

Ahhh...the Dust is the Earth, the Earth is the Mother...
So we return to Her...not the Father...
I'm never gonna leave... the Silence so loud...

Are we not your Children are we not Divine?
Are all forms not One in your infertile mind?

When she says, ...Father can I come back home...?
And he says, ...Father...what's beyond your great unknown...?

DEATH!!! - Black Winter on their eyes...
HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Great Liar of the Skies...
HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Stacked victims brutalized
HE ANSWERS THEM WITH DEATH - Great Liar of the skies...

Cold rays stream from the Heaverns
Bold screams her Name from our green tomb
Gold Queen grant us salvation
Old Themes reborn forever...

Victims of deep Mountain rage
I will not fail I will Defeat...!
