Burning are the Angels of the black moonrise
Sons of darkness flayed alive
Like a funeral star I will assail
Death awaits what the Gods unveil

Goddess, Enchantress
Nocturnal youth bride
Return in Chaos Divine...

MY PAGAN HEART - lives for the hour
MY PAGAN HEART - burns to devour
When God will be ripped from the sky
I'll be free

Blinded by the arrows of a black new flame
It burns alive but it will not tame
Not dead but dreaming alive... In your eyes
A cross is torn from the wood we prize
True sons of darkness
We heal by your side 3 days of visions arise
Underworld imprisoned living communion
Waiting for Hel to appear

MY PAGAN HEART - lives for the moment
MY PAGAN HEART â is healed from its torment
When God will be ripped from the sky
I'll be free

Let there be dark!!!
Summoning the presence in the storm of wind
A throne of blood for the snake within
Who is she who is she hot... ghost divine
Cobra Queen of the Ancient Line

Triplicate Goddess the Crossroads of night
Earth Mother, Father and Child...
Bleeding from a thousand wounds in the torchlight
Chaos is what we appear

MY PAGAN HEART - lives for the hour
MY PAGAN HEART - burns to devour
For I am the bull who is torn
And I am the lion who's tearing
Guarding the time of your death in my hands

MY PAGAN HEART - lives for the hour
MY PAGAN HEART - brings forth in power
When God will be ripped from the sky!

MY PAGAN HEART - lives for the answer
MY PAGAN HEART â screams like a panther
To be Free!!!
