[LILITH:] Yea, Ah...ohhh...Blacken the Sunrise

Daylight it Tortures me Daylight Unknown
God's Vow fades with the Sun's Pyre
Cold Fires where the Flames have all gone dim
Drown all your rage; I'll never come back again...
...never...

A Brave Fight...Enter the Night
The same Desire falls...Enter the Night
I'm Haunted by your Lies...Mad Dreams
The same Desire falls...Enter the Night
oh...oh...
I LIVE TOMORROW I can't live today
Seek me in Starlight seek me in Rain
that falls down over thee...oh...
Strange Lights..Enter the Nights
Twin Souls are Torn...Enter the Nights
Wreathed in Blood where do you sleep?
Lost vows... I cannot heal...

I LIVE TOMORROW I won't live today
Seek me in Sorrow
seek me in Rain that falls down over thee
I LIVE TOMORROW,
I can't live today...NO!!!
Seek me in Silence
seek me in Pain...
...seek me in Pain...
