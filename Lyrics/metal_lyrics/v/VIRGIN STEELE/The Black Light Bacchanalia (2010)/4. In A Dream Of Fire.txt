[LILITH:] Oh my love...here we die...

In this Land of Brilliant Sorrow
Clouds and Rain and Darkness follows
A Graveside Kiss an empty Moral
The Sunlight tracks The Death we swallow
Will you run with me through Wild Plains
Will you hunt with me with Wolves
Through the Forest where the Spirits mate
And the Savage Gods are born...

Calling, Howling, Lightning to the One

Oh we are moving far away from the Sun
Or any memory of that there was ever Sun
In our Black fucking Sky

[ADAM:] Is there Thunder in our Heaven
Is Osiris by your side
Who is Jesus and our father?
[LILITH:] He's a Tyrant in disguise
With a rushing and a roaring
Came the Terrible Sons of Mourning
Feel the Beauty of my Weapons
But don't let me kill your Self...

Calling, Howling, Lightning to the One

Oh we are moving far away from the Sun
Or any memory of that there was ever Sun
In our Black empty Sky... Oh lookout, lookout...
Oh under Black Raven Skies???
Calling, Howling, Lightning we follow
Burning down Heaven...Immortal Love,
Immortal Hate, to the One

Oh here we are moving far away from the Sun
Or any memory of that there was ever Sun
While you are drowning in the bowels of the Earth
I will be rising scarred by each of my Births...
Oh we are moving Blackened far from the Sun
Or any memory of that there was ever Sun

[GOD:]
I see our Future it Burns with Moonfire Eyes
Desperate Estrangement War and everyone Dies
Under Black empty Skies...Yeow!Oh!

[LILITH:]
Under Black Raven Skies
The Sun burns Black in Gardens Hollow...

[ADAM:] (This Garden is dead)...

[LILITH:]
Seas of Chaos,
Shadow Darken...

[ADAM:] (Shadow lengthen)

[LILITH:] Sundered from ourselves...waith... we are forsaken...
