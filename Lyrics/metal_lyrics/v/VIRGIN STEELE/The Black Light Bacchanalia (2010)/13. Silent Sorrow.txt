[Bonus track]

She walks in the Garden...
Sunlight, Golden Face...
Treading the Air so Lovely...

What do I think, what do I see
Angels weaving Golden Webs
Entwined in Shrouded Mist
Across the Cold Moors at Dawn...
Spreading here and there and there...and there...

(She says) - Oh I am Beautiful
Ancient Elegance yet such a Child
Oh I'm fanciful
I only hear the Music... ohhh... in my head...

What do I feel, what do I think
The Skies are Cold
And there is no hope for the future...no
Look into my eyes the melting of our gaze turns up empty...
And lips that part to speak make sounds too hard to reach...

I want the words to reach you still
You want to touch the Light upon the hill
You want to feel the things I feel
But the Hour's late and the time isn't now
So we'll part in Silence in the Cold
And hope the time will come when the story will unfold...

We'll part in silence in the cold
And tears will flow as foretold
We'll part in silence in the cold
A fleeting kiss that dies before it's old
From lips that speak to ears that can't comprehend the love the heart can send...
The love the heart can send...
