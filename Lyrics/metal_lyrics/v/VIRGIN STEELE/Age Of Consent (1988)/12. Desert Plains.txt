[Music and lyrics: Tipton/Halford/Downing]

Fool moon is rising, the sky is black
I heed your call, I'm coming back
The road is straight cast, wind's in my eyes
The engine roars between my thighs

[Chorus:]
From desrt plains I'll bring you love
From desert plains I'll bring you love

Wild mountain thunder echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me 'till sunset leaves
My passion screams my heart it bleeds (black blood)

[Chorus]
(Oh feel the hunger)

Then in the distance I see you stand
On the horizon- raise your hand
In burning rubber I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last

[Chorus]

(On the wings of The Raven, On The Wings Of The Night)
(I Will Come For You.. you, you and only you!!)
