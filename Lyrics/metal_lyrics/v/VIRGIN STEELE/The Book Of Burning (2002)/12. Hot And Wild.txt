White hot, white heat
We're gonna blind your eyes
Like a supernova one step closer
We'll leave you hypnotized
A fast guitar, a stage and some action!
A burning heart for you...yeah!

HOT &amp; WILD tonight
Electric Lions stealing the spotlight
HOT &amp; WILD tonight yeah

Ooh, oh, here she comes
I know she's comin for me
She's a fox in leather, whiskey &amp; feathers
The joys and venus are free
Pour the wine in the cup of the future
And raise your glass for today!

HOT &amp; WILD tonight
Electric Lions stealing the spotlight
HOT &amp; WILD tonight yeah
HOT &amp; WILD tonight...hot &amp; wild, wild, ahhh let's go!

Pour the wine in the cup of the future
And raise your glass for today!!!

HOT &amp; WILD tonight
Electric Lions stealing the spotlight
HOT &amp; WILD tonight yeah
HOT &amp; WILD tonight!!!
