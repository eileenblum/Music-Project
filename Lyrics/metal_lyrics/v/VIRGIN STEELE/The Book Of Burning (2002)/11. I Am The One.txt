This evening a star did fall and the sky was all ablaze
It was a sign for me to gather Wings and fly, to fly
The Angels are all crying now for the one that was so fair
They fear that she has fallen, oh no, oh no... oh...

Riding like the rainbow, tearing 'cross the sky
Like the roar of thunder, I'm never gonna die
I've been here before, I'll return again
I'm the one who lights the way

The fire of hatred, the heat of the sun
I am upon you, I AM THE ONE
A choir of angels, get ready to run
I am upon you, I AM THE ONE!

I'm the sound of anger, a cannon in the wind
I'm the great avenger, you'll pay for your sins
You can run for cover, but I'll get you anyway
I'm the one who lights the way

The fire of hatred, the heat of the sun
I am upon you, I AM THE ONE
A choir of angels, get ready to run
I am upon you, I AM THE ONE!

Riding like the rainbow, tearing cross the sky
I'm never ever, ever, ever gonna die
Oh racing with the shadows
Screaming in the night
I'm the one who lights the way

The fire of hatred, the heat of the sun
I am upon you, I AM THE ONE
A choir of angels, get ready to run
I am upon you, I AM THE ONE!
