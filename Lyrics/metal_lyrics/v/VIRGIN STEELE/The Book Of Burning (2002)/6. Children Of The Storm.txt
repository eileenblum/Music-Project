Forget in Fire, tempered in STEEL,
CHILDREN OF THE STORM
Never Kneel !!!

Tear down the Walls!
Break the chain !The wicked wind is howling and it's screaming out my name
Above the ring of fire, the necromancer reigns
With thunder and lightning, he enforces his command
Of evil, lust and violence, destruction rules the landCHILDREN OF THE STORM, on
and on we run
CHILDREN OF THE STORM trying to find the sun

With wrathful hearts we've scaled the fortress
Whose summits reach the sky
In vain we roared and were defeated
His majesty reigns high

Weeping and wailing, another maiden dies
In the wind and ice we gather to blast this Demon from the sky

CHILDREN OF THE STORM, on and on we run
CHILDREN OF THE STORM trying to find the sun

Shadows fly past, but the Black Knight holds fast
And I'll trust in the strength of my song
Over the edge went the dark flame of dread,
And it's all in the strength of my hand

CHILDREN OF THE STORM, on and on we run
CHILDREN OF THE STORM trying to find the sun

CHILDREN OF THE STORM, on and on we run
CHILDREN OF THE STORM trying to find the sun

Keep on your guard, trust in the Sword, face,
face the flames... FACE THE FLAMES!!!
