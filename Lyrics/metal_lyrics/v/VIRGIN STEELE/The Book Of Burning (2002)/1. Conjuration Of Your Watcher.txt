On Sacred Ground
Standing there with Specters all around
Make no Sound
The Circle must be closed before you're found
Light the Light
Break the Seal, perform the Mystic Rite
Ancient Might
Your Blood will spill if you don't Conjure

Soon the Presence fills the Air all around
Waving Flaming Swords in Hand
An Ancient Being from a different Vanished Time
Scred Power Desert Sands

How He's watching now
Seeing them Burn
Watching the Flames taking them all
Megawatt Power Blazing through time
Watcher devours, lust in his mind

Candle Light
Playing tricks with Shadows in the Air
Don't despair
The Vision comes you climb the Sacred Stair
Through the door
Three steps beyond you lies the Magick Gate
Don't be late
The Hour has come for you to meet your fate

He's watching you and every move you make
Waving Flaming Swords in hand
An Ancient being from a different Vanished time
Sacred power brilliant mind

Now He's watching now
Seeing them Burn
Watching the flames taking them all
Megawatt Power Blazing through time
Watcher devours, lust in his mind

Now He's watching now
Seeing them Burn
Watching the flames taking them all
Giving you knowledge beyond the thrones
Black shooting stars the seven stones
