All rise, face the light!
Fall to your knees, repent please, oh yeah

Down from the mountains the Elders came
With a message for man
Fire and brimstone will follow you all
To the ends of the earth
As sure as the stars shine down on you
You must never look back
Abandon all hope Yea who enter here
Spoke the man in black

Lead us from temptation, help us find the way
Show me the direction that leads to my Salvation
Make me Holy againInscribed in blood on the scroll of life
Was the Oracle's will
Death and Damnation will be your destiny
Purgatory awaits
A thousand curses I invoke on thee
In the name of tonight(YOU FUCK!!!)
A hellish fire will follow you all
Better run for your life, life, life!!!
Lead us from Tempation, help us find the way
Show me the direction which leads to my SalvationREDEEMER save our souls
REDEEMER grant us peace
REDEEMER save our souls
REDEEMER save our souls

Born, born again...

Down from the mountains the Elders came
With a message for man
Fire and brimstone will follow you all
To the ends of the earth
As sure as the stars shine down on you
You must never look back
Abandon all hope Yea who enter here
Spoke the man in black

Lead us from temptation, help us find the way
Show me the direction that leads to my Salvation
