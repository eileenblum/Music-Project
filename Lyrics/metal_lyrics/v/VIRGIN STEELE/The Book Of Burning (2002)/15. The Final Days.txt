Nuclear waste, a can of mace
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Virtual living, video sex
A voice keeps saying, "this is only a test" (only a test)
Online, out of time, TV crime
Hey, what's your sign
Thrash, trash Seattle fools
LA's out and New York rules!

This is a world gone crazy
This is a world gone mad
The end is drawing nearer
These are the FINAL DAYS!!! THE FINAL DAYS!!!

Prime time, teenage crime
Too many 12 year olds doing time
Drug dealers in the hall
Phony gangsters in the mall (I'm sick of it)
Aids, clones, cell phones
Can anyone tell me where is home!!! (where is it)
Prophets of doom, talk show goons
Did someone say, "he's coming soon"

This is a world gone crazy
This is a world gone mad
The end is drawing nearer
These are the FINAL DAYS!!!

Hollywood stars, cheap guitars
A headless body in a topless bar
Elephant bones, ice cream cones
Can't we all just get along, get along...
Dead rappers in the news
15 years olds with nothing to loose
Crowded jails, love for sale
Can't touch me, I'm out on bail...
(Don't fuck with me) THE FINAL DAYS!!!

Shock jocks, channel blocks
If you don't like my face hey suck my cock
Blown up airlines in the sky
Can anybody tell us the reason why
Dream date, procreate
Why don't you fucking masturbate
Lap dancer, radical cancer
I wish I did but I don't have the answer!

This is a world gone crazy
This is a world gone mad
The end is drawing nearer
These are the FINAL DAYS!!!
