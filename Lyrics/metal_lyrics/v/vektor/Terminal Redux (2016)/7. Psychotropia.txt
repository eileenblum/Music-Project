I have ended their reign of strife
The land is cleansed with the ebb of the tide
I give you the sands; now we must rebuild
The world is ours to be shaped by our will

[Chorus]
Psychotropia
An ageless utopia
Psychotropia
A reflection to be a

Mirrored image of my reverie
Our thoughts are aligned; connected by screens
Imagine a world where we are the force
That shapes this planet without recourse

Yield from the pain in the path of resistance
Youâre a sheep unshorn, nothing more
Believe in the gain from my path of persistence
A seed unborn, nothing more

In our time we have seen
A new light of liberty
A new dawn now unfurls
We create a perfect world

Revel in the consciousness
Of a world in a waking-life
Watch as all my hopes and dreams
Materialize

Balance attained through stability
We must eliminate change
Change is the force that brings down regimes
Balance must be maintained

[Chorus 2]
Forward we go
Psychotropia
In a world thatâs shaped by our minds
Aspiration designs

Sterilize the population
The ageless have no need to procreate
Genetic banks have my hand-picked genes
If misfortune on someone awaits

[Chorus 2]

We are aligned; weâve bound our minds
A new regime: what will it glean?
What will we find with endless time?
Unleash the hive [3x]

Raze the land to construct a new beacon
That will shine out from every surface
We are Cygnus V.2
We dictate balance and purpose

[Chorus 2]

In our time we have seen
A new light of liberty
Now we spread our cosmic law
Through the skies over all

[Chorus]

Trudging through the heaps of waste
An abstract world outside the screens we embrace
The air imbues a film of scum
The cityâs center rises above the slums
