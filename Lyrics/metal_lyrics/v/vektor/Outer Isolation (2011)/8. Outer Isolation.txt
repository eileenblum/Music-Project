Awoken by a hissing door
The seal of my capsule breaks
Alone I stumble to the floor
Not knowing whatâs at stake
Clinging to the boundaries of my mindâ¦

Auto-pilot takes control
Static on the visual
Flung from the world I know
The dimensions of destiny are unfolding
Looking back, a world thatâs not so kindâ¦

Worlds apart we stare through empty
Voids of darkness through which light is carried

Far from their skies
Beyond their eyes
Cut all my ties
Trapped in my mind
Cryptic journey
Unknown destination
Beyond the edge
Outer isolation

I plummet through a cosmic rift
The foundation of time collapses
Beginnings of a mind adrift
Thereâs no turning back
Is this the end or the beginning of my life?

Worlds apart we stare through empty
Voids of darkness through which light is carried

Standing on the horizon of the universe
I break through the uncharted skies

Destructive forces are trailing me out
But a great wake is forming in front of my bow

Escaping distances forged by time
Scarper from the darkness obliged
Released from the stale picture of their design
Thereâs so much more to life

[Solo: Nelson]

Perceptions are just reflections on a wave
Memories are just the moments that we save
A life is just the wave that it creates
Just one in the turbid seas that we must brave

Creatures on my mind
Touch of death through my spine
Pulse of light drives my fate
As I gleam through the planes
Where dark is light internalized
And colors of the spectrum collide
Through solar storms
The aurora are born
Take solace from scorn
Reaching final form

Iâve wandered endlessly through the beyond
One final door remains before I am done
Break the pressure seal and release me
From this hell

Far from their skies
Beyond their eyes
Cut all my ties
Trapped in my mind
Cryptic journey
Unknown destination
Beyond the edge
Outer isolation

Distances evolved through time
The fuel is burning fast
Flickers of a fading line
Drawn from my past

To meet an end and see beginnings of a lifeâ¦
