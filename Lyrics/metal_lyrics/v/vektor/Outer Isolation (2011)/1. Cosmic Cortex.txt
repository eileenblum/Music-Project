Immersed in a colossal squall
The endless storm grows and evolves
With purpose to accelerate
The progression of the human race

Your mind enters a dimension of thought
Wisping forms flow through it
Just like a moon pulling the tide
The blackened ebb of Zeitgeist

It takes control of all your senses
Tightening its hold, it breaks your defenses

Cosmic Cortex
Bursting with gamma rays
Cosmic Cortex
Youâre pulsing through its veins
Cosmic Cortex
Will melt your brain

It takes its fears and makes them your own
And you become its drone
Youâre trapped between two hemispheres
Enveloped by the years

[Solo: Nelson]

The brain cannot truly create
Only build upon its existing slate
So we expand our totality
A cranial, mass singularity

Taking control of all communications
Watch the Cortex grow
Itâs a mental infestation

Cosmic Cortex
Bursting with gamma rays
Cosmic Cortex
Youâre pulsing through its veins
Cosmic Cortex
Will melt your brain

Feel, Sense, Share
Breathe the looming atmosphere of
Hate, Doubt, Fear
Between the two hemispheres of
Self and Mass, Torn
To create within the same pulsing brain
That will claim to protect: The Cosmic Cortex

All that has passed
All thoughts amassed
Speed through the curve
Too far too fast
To resist is to be destroyed

Terror rises from the East
A neural web flowing like tidal debris
Versed, coerced, immersed
The mastermind that shapes and turns this earth

The cosmic brain appears
As a celestial sphere
Grey matter that collects
Consciousness
The cosmic brain inscribes
Tidal minds
Grey matter that collects
And then infects

No one defies
The ever-growing mind
All thought exhumed in
The all-consuming Cosmic Cortex
Collect, infect
