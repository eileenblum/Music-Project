The gasoline hits the streets igniting greedy eyes
Marching blind through the heat
Collapsing sites of decay mark the end of time
A planetary grave

Slashing and burning, crushing and drilling
Extinction is coming, the oil keeps spilling
Business as usual while toxins are killing
Destroying the land that our waste keeps on filling

Scenes of despair rising up through the noxious air
Cities abandoned left to decay
A world forgotten, pushed aside, left in disarray

The crunch of steel splitting rocks releases bloody soil
Logic is what we mock
The population booms and we must kill to live
The end of our reign is coming soon

Slashing and burning, crushing and drilling
Extinction is coming, the oil keeps spilling
Business as usual while toxins are killing
Destroying the land that our waste keeps on filling

Scenes of despair rising up through the noxious air
Cities abandoned left to decay
A world forgotten, as we live only to rot away

There's photo-enforcement in our streets
The populous walks in defeat
Toxic gases fill our lungs
The bells of chaos have been rung

Welcome to the dying world
Humanity has lost all control

Propaganda shapes our minds
Day to day we cross the line
The seeds of hate lie in the soil
Intoxicated by our spoils

Welcome to the dying world
Humanity has lost control

Strange beast kills more than it can feast on
Boundless need to push what it can reach for
Plastic lifestyle, surgical disaster
Sculpting the Earth
Out of control, it starts moving faster

A self destructive way of life
We continue forth with the end in sight
The blood of the beast is green
The oil of this death machine

[Solo: Nelson]

Welcome to the dying world
Humanity has lost control
