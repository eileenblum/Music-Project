Empty are words that are regurgitated
From type sanctified
Tainted is air when you breathe what is spit in your face
The virus survives

Echoless chamber of your mind
Unknown to the boundaries that are defined

Enter the echoless chamber
Deep inside the core
Enter the echoless chamber
Where the source is pure
Descending through the blackâ¦

Type analyzed without a fleeting notion
Of what lies inside
Stamped to be chained and bound by thoughts
That man has contrived

Enter the echoless chamber
Deep inside the core
Enter the echoless chamber
Where the source is pure

Preconceptions, escape
Foul taste, spit up, too late
Disconnected madness
Persecuted genius
All your thoughts and actions
Based of others' reactions

Echoless chamber of your mind
Unknown to the boundaries that are defined
Descending through the blackâ¦

I awoke to the splashing of footsteps
Deep underground
Before my eyes, dark stalagmites formed
From the dripping sound

Looking down into the dark we realize
We are our own makers
Turn and be blinded by
Your shadow's creator

Shadows steal the color from the world around
Echoes trace the silken web which we are bound

Many times I have sought the sculptor
The architect of thought
Always ending at the beginning
Grasping through the dark

[Solo: Nelson]

Shadows steal the color from the world around
Echoes trace the silken web which we are bound

Realizing I had been chasing reflections
My skin began to glow
Truth resides in this new realm of light
I cast no shadow of my own

Looking down into the dark we realize
We are our own makers
Turn and be blinded by
Your shadow's creator

Shadows steal the color from the world around
Echoes trace the silken web which we are bound
Shadows steal the color from the world around
Echoes trace the silken web which we are bound

Within the shifting chamber
