Fast paced societies jumping forward
Our mind's leap falls short as we plummet toward
Automation through monotony
Magnetic structure binds itself to me
Colorful objects radiating transparent ideals
Robotic drones spreading their vacuum appeal
Robotic culture is high velocity
No time to rebel in a hyper society

Mindless through the mediocrity
Containment of all humanity
Alteration of thought, contaminated perception
Individuality's lost in a state of mental digression
Too involved to realize
Too stubborn to admit
So quickly we accept
Fall in line, and forget
Unable to escape a structure without form
Can't deny my own urge
Into it we are born

Magnetic beacons pulse down concrete halls
Unknown soldiers march without knowing their cause
The effect is a growing emptiness
Boring the mind into a hollowed pit
Dependency on sedation is becoming an addiction
Pulse through the brain, it fills the hole
Vortexial cauldron, shadowed soul
I-beams fly by as I fall deep into the constructs
Surrounded by acceleration, there is no escape

[Solo: Nelson]

Proceed directly through the grey
This will help with efficiency
Perform your function, follow and obey
While this machine operates on your brain

[Solo: DiSanto]

It controls you while your mind is distracted
Dulling your senses while performing personality extraction
'Til all that's left is a sponge for sounds and sights
Routine overkill, hyper socialites.

Automation through monotony,
Magnetic structure binds itself to me.
