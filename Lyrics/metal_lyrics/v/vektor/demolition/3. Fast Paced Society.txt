Fast paced societies jumping forwardOur mind's leap falls short as we plummet towardAutomation through monotonyMagnetic structure binds itself to meColorful objects radiating transparent idealsRobotic drones spreading their vacuum appealRobotic culture is high velocityNo time to rebel in a hyper society Mindless through the mediocrityContainment of all humanityAlterating their thoughts, contaminated perceptionIndividuality's lost in a state of mental digressionToo involved to realizeTo stubborn to admitSo quickly we acceptFall in line, and forgetUnable to escape a structure without formI can't deny my own urgeInto it we are born Magnetic beacons pulsing down concrete hallsUnknown soldiers march without knowing their causeThe effect is a growing emptinessBoring out the mind into a hollowed pitDependency on sedation is becoming an addictionLike plays feeding the brain, it fills the holeA vortexial cauldron of a shadowed soulI-beams fly by as i fall deep into the constructsSurrounded by acceleration, there is no escape Proceed directly through the greyThis will help with efficiencyPerform your function, follow and obeyWhile this machine operates on your brain It controls you while your mind is distractedDulling your senses while performing personality extractionTill all that's left is a sponge for sounds and sightsRoutine overkill, hyper socialities
