They manufactured their fateMachines still echo in these stark landscapesHallucinations of grandeur led them to boastThe distracted culture let the industries clench at their throatsThey were choking in their billowy hasteRising stacks spewed out toxic wasteLethal injections left a toxic traceThe drugged atmosphere was a heavy embraceCorrosive gases thickened the atmosphereThey moved through the unknown with their backs toward the mirror The past comes to life on the Earth sectSecond in line as the Venus ProjectWar was the priority for their futureIt overrode the threat of the fast rising temperature point of no return as they blistered and peeledIt didn't matter though because their fate had been sealedTrapped inside an envelope of nuclear overkillThey ensured all life to be born stillThe earth was pressure cooked as the water fledThe land was filled with the dust from the deadSmall jobs for big egos who let greed corrupt their livesThey knew their future was coming, but illusions diverted their eyes Global dissonance, a scalding air of silenceGeographic reverberations of apathetic violence Reminders of their greatness stand grim and barrenalone and useless over vast expansesThe entirety of their race was brainwashed by scare tacticsUnable to see any truth under a veil of distractionFEAR FEAR FEAR FEARKill them before they kill youThe result of that mentality led to... Lifeless scenes emerge between the clouds of acidic mistMetalloid structures crowd this puke colored abyssThe past is the only thing living on the planetA runaway greenhouse affect destroyed everything organicThe species left their impact with radioactive cratersThe cities lie flat on this nuclear futurePhase ten complete on the Venus ProjectScorched rocks and molten lead will be the fate of manFear echoes strongly in this nuclear wasteland
