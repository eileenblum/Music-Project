The moonbase was hidden from view on the darksideOperations were kept under wraps from the public's eyeI was teh head of the experiments focused on sustaining life on the moonLittle did I know, we would use our findings so soonA rogue government's terrorist operants infiltrated the baseWhen I stumbled upon their plans, it was too lateCommunications had been shut downThere would be no warningThose of us not involved were just left to Stand in the light of a dying daySubterranean cavities beneath the lunar landscapeWould hide their plans in the works to destroy the human raceA biological threat was being sent with hasteThe bombs would reach the Earth in just one day Standing in the light of a dying dayI took a rover to the horizon to have one last look,but as the light pierced my eyes, shame took my gutNow I have one wish as i look at my friendsI wish i was on the earth so I could die with themVirus bombs explode throughout the atmosphereThe virus is absorbed through the lungsOnce the virus enters the system, the blood congeals in the veinsNow the only survivors lie concealed in military bunkersAwaiting and unsure of their fateBlind to the origin of the assault Now suspended in fluid wit wires running through their headsScanning minds of the scientists until there of no more use to themDispose of the bodies to be sureNow our species is pure
