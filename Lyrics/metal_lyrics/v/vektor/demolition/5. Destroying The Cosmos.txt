Waves of light shooting through night
The void destroyed
Eons of terror emerge from the realms to deploy
Big bang, life and death collide at infinite reaches
Spawned from eternity
We are the creatures from the void

The cosmos
A flicker of the past
The cosmos
Infinity at last
Arise into the night
Invasion of the twilight

Doomingly slow
Destruction will follow
The balance is tipping
Evil is falling low
A rippling in time as a new dawn unwinds
A galactic species takes off and leaves from its confines

The cosmos
A flicker of the past
The cosmos
Infinity at last
Arise into the night
Invasion of the twilight

The time has come
The end is near
For anything that is not us
