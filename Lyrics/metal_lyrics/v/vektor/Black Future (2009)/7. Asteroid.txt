Swirling masses of rock, careening through the black,
An orbit unseen, by the distant eyes of man.
Floating through space, a distant planetoid,
Collision course, waiting for the moment to destroy.

Death from above, rocking the world,
An unharbored menace, chaos unfurls,
Death from above, block out the Sun,
Survivors will starve until their imminent... extinction.
An unheard countdown commences,
Even NASA is blind,
But could they say if they knew,
Chaos would ensue, facing the truth of their demise.

[Chorus:]
Asteroid, filling the sky,
Asteroid, reflecting in their wide eyes.
Asteroid, an eternal moment in time...
Paralyzed.

Death from above, rocking the world,
An unharbored menace, chaos unfurls,
Death from above, block out the Sun,
Survivors will starve until their imminent extinction.
The pointless construction of bombs and wars that brought them death,
The destruction that man has wreaked is unmatched by the impending threat.

[Chorus]

Mountains and seas arise and fall,
Crustal flex, the world absolved.
Frozen winds begin to swirl,
Putrid clouds of dust and gas engulf the world.

Massive ejections through the abysmal smog,
Shaking the fleas off of the dog.

Hear to see the end of all,
Apocalyptic wrecking ball,
A cosmic force to seal our fate,
Extinction of the human race.

Burning through the sky with atomic might,
Laid to rest with your fears on the darkest night.

[Solo: Nelson]
