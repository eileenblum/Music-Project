Absorb the radiation into blackness,
Photo-degradation in the depths within,
Shrouds of creation, cold emptiness,
The black serpent writhes in the solar wind.

Conceal the secret knowledge from events before,
Cloud the peering eye from what lies beyond the door.
Slumbering in the black cocoon,
Mistress of the night, a solar moon (solar moon!).

Into the night, seeker of light,
Into the day, impermeate.
Into the sore to find what hurts more,
Into the unknown to see what we own.

Watch it collapse as it contracts,
Watch it unfold out of control.
Unstoppable force, growing remorse,
A magnetic field the future will feel.

The strange ways that we keep face,
Gravitation holds our place.
We never seem to change our pace,
Forward on to win the race.

Congregation in the cell,
Manic pulse of thought upwells.
Deep inside the dark eclipse,
A growing metamorphosis.

Trapped inside deception and lies,
Trapped inside the growing madness in my mind.

All of the time spent, all of the years,
All of the moments that led me to this place.
What will I do now that I am here?

I walked inside the black serpent of the sky,
My eyes were drawn to a Sun within the dark nebula.

The wheel revolves contorting time and space,
Twisting strings that form the astral plane.
The dark creature begins the chase,
Holding the mane of the beast to meet our fate.
A stark contrasting blob infects our sight,
Riding further into the night.
A search to be content with what we are,
And to look and find a place among the stars.

Desperately, we arrive... anywhere,
A place we never planned to be...
