Chaos enveloped the social order of humanity,
After the nuclear fall from man's vanity,
Weathered faces trudge through empty miles in nomadic hordes,
A scalding wind grinds the barren desert floor.

Civilization is thrown into rampancy,
As the resources continue to dwindle in the fallout breeze,
Treaties between the wasteland hordes have burned and been defiled,
A black cloud of contrivance is amassing all the while.

Spray of blood in the air, bodies fall,
The only way to survive this upheaval...
Hunger for violence!

I will be the one to force chaos into submission,
An abandoned nuclear facility has powered my ambition,
I hold the power that once laid waste to these decaying lands,
My fission powered warriors are awaiting their command.

Hunger for violence!

Spray of blood in the air, bodies fall,
The wars of man continue, consuming all,
Spray of blood in the air, bodies fall,
Dominate with death machines, killing all...
Hunger for violence!

Apocalypse survivors hide within a rusting scrap yard,
The tyrannical artificer looms over the battle charge,
Hear the crushing sound of skulls lying under tank treads,
Fear as they rush the grounds.

Battalions of troops come barrelling through,
Walls of tires and barrels of crude.
Photo-receptors meet your gaze,
If you fight, you'll die, so be a slave.

Fight! [4x]

DIE!

The slaves have now been drafted into recruitment operations,
Implanted micro detonators ensure cooperation,
The pawns march side by side with their metallic lifeless captors,
Blood will cleanse the land as we descend into the final chapter.

Spray of blood in the air, bodies fall,
Dominate with death machines, killing all,
Spray of blood in the air, bodies fall,
The wars of man continue, consuming all...
Hunger for violence!
