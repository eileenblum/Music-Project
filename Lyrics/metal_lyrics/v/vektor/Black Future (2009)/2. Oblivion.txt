Spiraling into oblivion, mindless thoughts scream my silent cries
A shroud of blood and body parts are my demise
Shapeless moments crack my memories, a broken mirror inside my mind
The end has come, now time is empty

[Chorus:]
Souls rip through the skin into oblivion
Reborn into nothingness

Sucked through the veins of the universe flows the essence of existence
Time-cluttering, moment-shattering, voidless persistence
Aimless gazes stab through my eyes while they set their sights asunder
Lightning strikes upon me when all I've known is thunder

[Chorus]

On and on through eternity, pathway to the galaxy,
We were, we are, will we be?
Will our cries be heard, or echo endlessly?

[Solo: DiSanto]
[Solo: Nelson]

[Chorus]
