Engineering forms of life,
Splicing DNA,
Cut the strand, extract the base,
What is real can be changed.

Laboratories experiment with the limits of our will,
But there are endless ways to justify,
If we can, we will.

Products of our mind,
Abominations!
Looking from inside,
Strange creations.

Science based on temptation
To what we can achieve,
The desire lies within our hearts to fix the human being.

Cesspool of genes,
Tainted genetics,
Our fingers run down the blade,
Of a double-edged helix.

Journey through the cells,
Unlock the cell doors.

[Chorus:]
Violative manipulation,
DNA, the ultimate temptation.

Further do we travel descending the spiral stair case,
Reality unravels in the presence of our wake.

The hand that feeds is ingenuity,
Progression voices our reprisal.
Our ransacking gaze grips the shrinking world,
And what it comes down to is survival.

They will guarantee... future sanctity,
When the coin is tossed,
Perfection comes at a cost.

[Solo: Nelson]

[Chorus repeat until end]
