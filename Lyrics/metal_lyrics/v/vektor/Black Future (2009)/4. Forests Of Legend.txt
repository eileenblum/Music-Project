A shadowed existence veiled in mystery,
Swallowed by sound from dwellers of the trees,
A strange world thrives on a floor of decay,
From rotting death, breaking through the fray...
A forest!

[Solo: Nelson]

Enter the shadow realm,
Giants hold claim to the sky and ground,
Keepers of gloom and great oddities,
Sustain the ways of the forest keep.

Ancient kingdoms, creeping lines,
Split apart, by roots of time.

Voices from inside seem to pull you in,
Dark wisdom runs on the still, damp wind,
Glow of the eye, fear the gaze,
The great ape returns disconnected and changed.

Ancient kingdoms, creeping lines,
Split apart, by roots of time.

Twisted land, twisted sky,
Twisted circuit we call our mind,
We push our will to change a world,
Which has a spirit, has a soul.

Borneo, Amazon,
Once it goes, it is gone,
The legend is all that remains,
Of the forests of old and grand domains.

Legends only arise in the face of difficult times,
A forest that stands on its own,
In the truth of a desolate world is where the legend will grow.

No cover from the sun,
Carcass fields of fallen ones,
Biding time, seeds remain,
Tyrants fall, earth reclaims.

Ancient kingdoms, creeping lines,
Split apart by roots of time,
A strange world thrives on a floor of decay,
From broken rubble, breaking through the fray...
A forest!
