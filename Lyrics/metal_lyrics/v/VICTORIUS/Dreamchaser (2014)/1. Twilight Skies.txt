The years are passing by so fast
The future now has just begun
The Wheel of time goes on and on

Where do we go from here
Destination still unknown
What lies far beyond our spheres

What does the future hold for you and me
Will we find the answers here and now

Ride to the stars - We ride to the stars
Prepare our odyssey
Side by side we're standing strong
Born to conquer the universe
Back to back we stand as one
On and on through space and time
We are riding the twilight sky

With bravery the quest goes on
A journey to a new home
Leaving mother earth
We follow distant voices
