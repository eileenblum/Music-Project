Burn it down in the name of god
Rise to send you the grace of our lord
We are guided by his will
Blessed will be our swords
Spread the faith with a sea full of blood

March into a holy battle
To fight the sinner - To fight the devil

Battalions of the holy cross
Killing in the name of god
Battalions of the holy cross
They will burn your lies for sacrifice
Crusaders born to die

Raise your arms join the army of light
Show no mercy we're ready to kill
Ready to fight
We are marching through the gates of fire
Start the flame - Higher and higher
In the name of god we will fight
