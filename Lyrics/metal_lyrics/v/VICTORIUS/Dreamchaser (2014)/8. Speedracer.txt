My wheels start to burn the road
Inhale the sweet taste of the dust
The engine is roaring
Game reset I am ready for the blast
A fire inside of me rising high
Ready to explode
I feel the power - The energy
Like a beast out of control

No one can stop the king of the road
Adrenaline and fuel's reload

I'm a speedracer - Chainbreaker
I am hunting the eye of the storm
Speedracer - Stormchaser
I can't get enough - My need for speed

Eternity straight ahead
Man and machine bound to be free
I gamble with hell - Everyday
That's my way to be
Horizon so far away
But we are born to reach the sky
All that we need - Power and speed
Motor generation breed

No one can stop the king of the road
I am diving into infinity
