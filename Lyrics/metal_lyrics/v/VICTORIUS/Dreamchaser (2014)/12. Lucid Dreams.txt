[Bonus Track]Turn off the light
It's close to midnight
time to fall asleep
The night has come
so take your ask
Enter your dream

Prepare your imagination
wonder beneath the surface
into a stream absurd reality

Come, close your eyes and follow me
Be a man you'll never be
create your own fantasy
In your lucid dream

Are you still awake
time for re-play
shut your eyes and be quiet
don't you hear the silence
the sweet melody - the dreamer symphony

Prepare your imagination
wonder beneath the surface
into a stream absurd reality

Come, close your eyes and follow me
Be a man you'll never be
create your own fantasy
In your lucid dream

Time to change your destiny
wake up from reality
It's up to you, what you can be
In your lucid dream

Diving to your dreamworld
enter the secrets of your mind
Walking the path of illusion
and feel you are alive
Fall deeper and deeper
join this magic ride
See, all of this is real
leave all the rest behind

Will you believe, can't you see
diving to this lucid dream
Welcome to infinity

Come, close your eyes and follow me
Be a man you'll never be
create your own fantasy
In your lucid dream

Time to change your destiny
wake up from reality
It's up to you, what you can be
In your lucid dream
