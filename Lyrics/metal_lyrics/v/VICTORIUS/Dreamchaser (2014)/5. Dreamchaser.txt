Sometimes life is like a course
We are bound by
So blind to see that our time is running out
In the big machinery called world
We are their puppets
Left cold and numb
We are the slaves of our own

Wild - Inspiring - Hypnotizing
Take the step - Cross the boundaries

Dreamchaser we are
Escape the nightmare
The voice in your heart
Dreamchaser light up the dark
Light up the dark

Sometimes life seems to be a dream
We have just to wake up
Waiting for the call that
We have to break the spell
Only the reality knows there is no mercy
Of you fight
You can make your dreams come true

Deep in the dark we are hunting for the light
Listen to your heart and we will burn
We will burn the night

We are the light in the dark
