Dragonheart we fly
Eternally we're soaring high
We keep the flame in our soul alive
Dragonheart we ride
Dive into the endless sky
Put the fire in our soul to be alive

We came to conquer we came from the sky
We bring you the roaring thunder
A firestorm tonight
Blazing fields that we've left behind
In your eyes bravery is burning bright

Time to ride the wings of steel
Light up our hearts - A secret reveals

We ride the skies across the seas
To bring you destruction, pain and misery
Burning towns that we've left behind
Out of the heaven we will burn the night

Time to command the flying battlebeast
Light up our hearts - Unchain the mystery
