No longer you can keep me here
No reasons left to stay
In a place so cold and full of fear
Laying six feet under in my grave
I see a distant shadow
Spreading wings in a dying light
Locked in a dark place
Where the dead are alive

Canât keep on moving
Cause I am feeling paralyzed
Black eyes are starring at my soul
They come to take me away

Your time has come you're gonna die
Black wings coming down the sky
Now await the afterlife
Where the ravens fly
Between darkness and the light
Bringer of eternal life
A place our souls divide
Where the ravens fly

My world has changed forever more
When I choose to unlock this secret door
Immortality my new life has just begun
Reborn in a world beyond the living ones
