Tell me why I feel so empty
All the colored memories fade away
Who's the one - Putting me in this situation
See the world turn into black and white

Broken shades of my reality
And the blackened skies
Covered the glory days
Lose my way trying to step away
From all the truth
Not recognize myself - Myself anymore

Left alone in this cold world
Where I am on my own

Paint my world black and white
Trapped here till the end of time
All your words a bitter lie
A cut so deep into my life
Tell me what's wrong or right
I will leave it all behind
Shooting me down and let me die
Broken wings cannot fly

Take a look in the bleak mirror of my soul
In your game I just take the second role
The whole time my eyes
Were just too blind to see
For the reflections of what
What I supposed to be
