Dark alliance - Breed of the night
Driven by the taste of blood
Unholy creatures - Covered by moonlight
Call for the vampiric bite
They smell the fear deep in your veins
Feel every beat in your heart
They find you where ever you are
Wherever you hide

Your holy blood runs down
Fulfil my hungry mind
One bite - You'll be mine
Blood Alliance

Servants of demonic horde
Lusting for the virgin blood
Feed their hunger with an eternal kiss
Immortality - Disbelief
The poison of their dark deceit
Take new life without pain and grief
They smell the fear deep in your veins
Hear every breath you take
They find you where ever you are
Wherever you hide

Now run for your life
Beware the children of the night
Surrender and become one of my kind

Your skin - My delight
Drink the essence of the night
