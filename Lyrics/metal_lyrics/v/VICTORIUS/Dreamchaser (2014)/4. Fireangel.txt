Burning angel
Do you hear my silent call to drain
My wrath and tears
Set a fire - Blaze a symphony
Chaos - Inferno
My pure passion - Your demise
And reveal a darkened demon and
Burn me alive

My soul in rage - burst into flames
Desire and lust - burn it to dust

Inside these flames of fury
Fireangel set it free
Chains of purgatory
Fireangel deep in me

Fallen angel
You will feed my hunger
Fuel my soul and let it burn
Ashes to ashes - Dust to dust
Darkness - Damnation
Seed a flaming paradise
Can't you see this evil monster
Inside my mind
