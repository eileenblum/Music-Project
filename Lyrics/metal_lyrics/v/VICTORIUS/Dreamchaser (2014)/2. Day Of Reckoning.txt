Fear the dark night's cold embrace
The reaper is sent - your soul to take
Spit out by hell - arise from the damned
Fill my hunger with bitter revenge
Face your sins - pray and cry
I will take your precious life
Not even your tears will save you tonight

The echoes will lead you into despair
No chance to survive

This is my day of reckoning - Of reckoning
Now you burn in hell for all your sins
When the demon king calls your name
On your knees and pray
Day of reckoning

Now your nightmares come to live
Hell awaits your soul tonight
It's time to pay - A life full of betray
Burn your sins - Suffer and obey
No escape your soul is mine
Do you see the evil sign
It's too late - Your life is fading away

The shadows will guide you into the death
Now scream for your life
