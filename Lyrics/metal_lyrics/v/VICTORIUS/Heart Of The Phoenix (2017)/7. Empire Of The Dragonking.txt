I was born in the fields of raging firestorms
Raised by the kings ans shadowlords
Chosen to rule and conquer them all
I will rise!
You will fall!

Hail to the crown
Hail to the king
We rise to bring fear within
I'm your majesty
Your dragonking
An everlasting legacy
Hear the anthem
We will sing
For the empire of the dragonking

I am forced to obey
I've seeded the tyranny
Crowned to fulfill a prophecy
Marked by the flames
And signed by the beast
Long live the legacy!

Hail to the crown
Hail to the king
We rise to bring fear within
I'm your majesty
Your dragonking
An everlasting legacy
Hear the anthem
We will sing
For the empire of the dragonking

Hail to the king
Hail to the crown
Hail and obey
Hail your majesty

Hail to the crown
Hail to the king
We rise to bring fear within
I'm your majesty
Your dragonking
An everlasting legacy
Hear the anthem
We will sing
For the empire of the dragonking
