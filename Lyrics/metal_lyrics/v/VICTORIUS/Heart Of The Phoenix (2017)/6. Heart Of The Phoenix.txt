Reborn from a dying flame
From the ashes now we will arise
We are standing tall, never fall
The creature comes alive

As long as our hearts will burn
Our souls will feed the flame
For eternity and victory, the everlasting dream

Rise up now, light the spark
The eternal flame to unleash the fire

Shining bright heart of the phoenix
Blazing fire deep inside, eternally
Victorious, forever free
See the flames in the sky as the phoenix arise
On these wings of fire we ride
Rise up to the sky

Returned, we are back from the dark
See the raging firebird
To infinity, in unity, our voices will be heard

A power, so mighty and strong, our spirits will live on
Through all the years and centuries we rule the inferno

Rise up now, light the spark
The eternal flame to unleash the fire

Shining bright heart of the phoenix
Blazing fire deep inside, eternally
Victorious, forever free
See the flames in the sky as the phoenix arise
On these wings of fire we ride
Rise up to the sky
