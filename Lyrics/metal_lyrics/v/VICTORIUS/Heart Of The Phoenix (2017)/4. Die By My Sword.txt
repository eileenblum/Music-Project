Mighty warrior
Welcome to the fields of war!
Covered in blood
Hungry, waiting for revenge
For many years I walk along the ravens path
Fighting without fear
Face to face with the dead

Now your end is drawing near
It's me not god you have to fear

Your time has come come
Justice shall be done
A warrior reborn
Raised by the sword
One path, one line
Vengeance will be mine
Blaze a raging storm
Tonight you die by my sword!

Fallen warrior
Welcome to the graveyard
Dressed in red
Dancing on the fields of death
Do you dare to fight, to meet the devil's blade?
Your death will be my victory
When you're buried six feet deep
