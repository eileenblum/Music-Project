In quest for our souls, for glory and gold
We are chasing the end of the rainbow
My kingdom will come, the land of the sun, we are one
Our journey has begun

We're starting a journey, through unknown lands
To find the treasure of light
Reveal a secret, kept for thousand years
A secret from the ancient times, from the ancient times!
I dreamed all my life to follow my heart
With glory my wish will come true
Open the gates, enter the stairs to ride into something new

A mysterious key to a long forgotten land
Beyond all imagination come and take my hand

In quest for our souls, for glory and gold
We are chasing the end of the rainbow
My kingdom will come, the land of the sun, we are one
Our journey has begun

We follow the path, complete the quest
Through valleys of secrets and wonders
Reveal the magic, enter the unknown
Take a look what is hidden beyond

A mysterious key to a long forgotten land
Beyond all imagination come and take my hand

In quest for our souls, for glory and gold
We are chasing the end of the rainbow
My kingdom will come, the land of the sun, we are one
Our journey has begun

A mysterious key to a long forgotten land
Beyond what you see, beyond all your dreams, take my hand
