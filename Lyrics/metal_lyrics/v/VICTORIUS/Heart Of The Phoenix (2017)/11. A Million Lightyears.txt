Do you remember my name, do you know I am still alive
You put a fire in my heart, you've shown me how to love
I am counting the days, lonely nights will be forever gone
I promise I will turn around the world
You are my star, my moon my sun

Come break silence now and open up your heart
Can you see the light shining in the dark

A million light years far away
I am searching for the day
Even there is no tomorrow
A million stars up in the sky
Shining diamonds in the night
We are here to stay... A million light years away

It felt like falling apart, I feel the cold from deep inside
Until you melt my frozen heart, illuminating my life
And I was stumbling through the dark
I am locked in by my fears
But once you've healed my scars
And washed away my tears

Come break silence now and open up your heart
Can you see the light shining in the dark

A million light years far away
I am searching for the day
Even there is no tomorrow
A million stars up in the sky
Shining diamonds in the night
We are here to stay... A million light years away

A million light years so far far away
A million light years... So far away
