Our future lies in darkness
We are damned to agony
Cross the borders of our world
To reach our for infinity
War machines burn down the fields
We kill to reach immortality
Praise the kings of disillusion
Feeding what we call humanity

Rise! Iron, fire and steel
For our race the future is sealed
We are breaking the limits of space and time
Out of the ruins we rise beyond the iron sky

Evolution and deception
We are bound by mortality
Do we have the right to play god
The right to change the history
Choose your side, is good or evil
The future lies in our hands
Make your own decision now
The sands of time are running fast

Rise! Iron, fire and steel
For our race the future is sealed
We are breaking the limits of space and time
Out of the ruins we rise beyond the iron sky
