The countdown has begun, the dead is on the run
No escape for the forsaken ones
How long we will survive in the darkest night?
How much time is left until we die?

One way to suicide
There is no place for us to hide
Humanity is dying right here in paradise

Awaken the evil within
Spreading the earth with a killing, toxic disease
Awaken the evil within
Virus drowns the whole world in deadly silence

The dying has begun and soon we are alone
No salvation, one way into oblivion
In the state of decay, will we find a way?
To fight the sickness to erase the deadly plaque

See the dead alive
Coming from inside
Hunters will be hunted and no one will survive

I feel it's crawling
Deep under my skin
My lungs stop breathing
My whole body is freezin'
All life is fading
Nothing stops me dying anymore
