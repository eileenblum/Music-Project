Call out my name!
When the world is sinking into chaos
Call out my name!
When all your hope is dead and gone
I fight them all, getting stronger, standing tall
I won't back down, 'cause I am unbreakable

Time to open my eyes my heart is on fire
The power grows inside justice comes alive

Salvation is near, when there's nothing left to fear
And a hero will rise from the shadows
When damnation has come, we face the evil one
We will call for the rise of the hero to save us all

Call out my name!
When you are lost in the dark
Call out my name!
There you'll find your savior

Fight for the weak I lead you out of the misery
A force unleashed I will be invincible

Time to open my eyes my heart is on fire
The power grows inside justice comes alive

Salvation is near, when there's nothing left to fear
And a hero will rise from the shadows
When damnation has come, we face the evil one
We will call for the rise of the hero to save us all!
