Born into a dynasty full of fear and anarchy
Warlords kill and fight for supremacy
We are the ones, unchained by the sword
Chosen for the way of the great warrior

Oh shogun without fear
We will fight the shattered empire
Mighty shinobi, out of the mist the shadows retreat

Here we are sworn to fight
In darkness we strike
Shadow warriors ninja!
Steel in our hand
Out of the black hide and attack
Deadly shadows will arise the hunters of the night

With justice and honour, we fight for centuries
In blood we paint the pages of our history
We are the ones from the stories they have told
A long forgotten myth a legend unfolds

Oh shogun without fear
We will fight the shattered empire
Mighty shinobi, out of the mist the shadows retreat

Here we are sworn to fight
In darkness we strike
Shadow warriors, ninja!
Steel in our hand
Out of the black hide and attack
Deadly shadows will arise the hunters of the night
