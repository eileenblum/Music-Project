Run my little child
Get up or you drown in your tears
Face the madness in this world
Stand your darkest fears
You can't run away
From the shadows of your past
Let the demons disappear
Or you scars will ever last

No time to cry, you wake the blind
Hear the voices inside

Strike the hammer down
My justice will be done
Face the lies before your sins will bury you
Sweet is my revenge
When I take my chance
Out of the dark we call
The hammer of justice will fall

Fight my little child
Unlock the cage you're living in
Withstand your inner demons
And pay back all their sins
You can get away from sorrow
Madness, fear and pain
Now you have learned to be strong
In a world you've suffered for too long

No time to cry, you wake the blind
Hear the voices inside

Strike the hammer down
My justice will be done
Face the lies before your sins will bury you
Sweet is my revenge
When I take my chance
Out of the dark we call
The hammer of justice will fall
