We come from a world beyond your stars
From a silver stream hidden in the nebula
Outlaws and strangers, the last one of our kind
On the way to new home through the galaxy we ride

We are sailing the dark to find a star
A planet to go on, live and see a new dawn
We need to survive
And seed a new life to save our tribe

Can you see the future, riding on the wings of destiny

Far away from the universe we come
Travel galaxies far beyond
Sons of Orion
Far away from an ancient aeon stream
Born to be strong, to carry on
Sons of Orion

Were crossing the space to dawn a new age
The universe has born a new face
We bring the evolution, new technologies
We settle the fields for a new century

We are facing the earth to build a new world
The time has come there is no return
We can stand as one, children of the sun
Hand in hand we carry on

Where do we go?
Where we belong
In search for new hope
Set the sails and carry on... We stand as one
