1, 2, 3, 4... go!

Here we are, once again we gonna rock, drive you insane 
We are sent to earth, set the whole world on fire
Filled with anger in our hearts we take everything apart 
Our work is done
Revolution now has begun

The age of tyranny is near,
One more time the dead kings show you to fear
Spin the wheel, roll the dice, turn up the cards and pay the price
We make the rules and we decide
It's kick ass time and were ready to... ready to fight

We are the storm, the hurricane, we blow your freakin' minds away
Bring it heavy to the roots, now we have nothing to loose
Filled with nitro in our veins, ready for another game, there is no return
The engine starts and roads will burn

The age of tyranny is near,
One more time the dead kings show you to fear
Spin the wheel, roll the dice, turn up the cards and pay the price
We make the rules and we decide
It's kick ass time, welcome to the age of tyranny

Spin the wheel, roll the dice, turn up the cards and pay the price 
We make the rules and we decide,
It's kick ass time, the countdown begins...

Spin the wheel, roll the dice, turn up the cards and pay the price 
We make the rules and we decide,
It's kick ass time and we're ready to fight, fight, fight... 
We're ready to fight

3, 2, 1 out!
