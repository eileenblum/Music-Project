You start from zero, your energy is pushing you
Ride on the strings
The sound of metal's pounding in your veins 
Smoke fills the air, see the crowd going insane 
Show what you've got
Now you burn the whole roof to the top

Ohohoh, scream it out 
Ohohoh, sing it loud

Feel the metal in your soul, feel the metal in your heart
Open up your eyes and fade away the dark
Follow your dreams, keep the metal flame alive 
Then you hear your metalheart deep inside

You feel the fire, like a poison flowing in your blood 
Natural desire, like a hurricane we show them how to rock
Raise your hands, it is time to hit the stage, now all is set
We blow the fucking brain out of your head

Ohohoh, scream it out 
Ohohoh, sing it loud

Feel the metal in your soul, feel the metal in your heart
Open up your eyes and fade away the dark 
Follow your dreams, keep the metal flame alive 
Then you hear your metalheart deep inside
