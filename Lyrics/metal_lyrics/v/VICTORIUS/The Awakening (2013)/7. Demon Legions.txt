Hear the call of the master in this dark full moon night
Bring them pain and disaster, all your souls shall be mine
Burn this world to ashes, let them suffer, let them die 
All these holy preachers will sink into our night

Until the dust will fall up a new era shall come

Open wide the ancient gates
The shadows come to rule the earth
All your souls will drowning in their flames
Your beloved paradise will burn 
At your faith, where is it gone?
Who is your god, who'll save his sons? 
The sacred oath brings no salvation 
They reap them all, the demon legions

Until the moon will rise a new era shall come

Damnation feeds the hellfire 
Our demon legions rise up high 
Enslave the powers of pure evil 
Unbound the creatures of the night
