Hot winds blowing, they beat up the flames 
Sky spits out glowing embers
They are ten thousand lightyears away 
And belong to eternity

Starfire, burning souls in the night
Starfire, like a phoenix from the ashes they will rise
Starfire, rays of star will ever shine
Starfire, flash of light, one with the time

See the tears from heaven rain down 
Sparks burn all to the ashes
The sky opens up a bright light 
And colours the blackened night

Starfire, burning souls in the night
Starfire, like a phoenix from the ashes they will rise
Starfire, rays of star will ever shine
Starfire, flash of light, one with the time

Starfire, burning souls in the night
Starfire, like a phoenix from the ashes they will rise
Starfire, rays of star will ever shine
Starfire, flash of light, one with the time

With the burning night
