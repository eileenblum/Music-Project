Rise from the ashes of our graves
Taking back our throne to rule the world 
Now it is time for our return
Let the kingdoms burn for a new empire

Oh, we signed in blood with the devil on our side we will rise

We are! We are! We are the seeds of scorn! 
We are! We are! We are the kings reborn! 
We are! We are! We are the raging storm! 
We are! We are! We are the kings reborn!

Kill! With the forces of evil
Command the army of the dead to take our revenge
Fight! None will survive
There's no place for you to hide, the apocalypse is near

Oh, we signed in blood with the master on our side we will rise

We are! We are! We are the seeds of scorn! 
We are! We are! We are the kings reborn! 
We are! We are! We are the raging storm! 
We are! We are! We are the kings reborn!
