Day by day we live in sorrow and despair 
Who can save us from all madness
No mercy, no remorse, the final days will come
Skies turning black for a revolution

What is right, what is wrong 
When yesterday is gone 
The future belongs to those who believe
So rise up and break free 
Rising up to be free again

Take me higher, higher from the depths of our hearts
We will break the silence
Higher, higher open your eyes, the time has come to raise a storm

All the misery hidden in our darkened hearts
The pain inside will never come to an end
The fragile minds, who hide behind these mask of lies
Hear our call, a march of revolution

What is right, what is wrong 
When yesterday is gone 
The future belongs to those who believe
So rise up and break free 
Rising up to be free again

Take me higher, higher from the depths of our hearts
We will break the silence
Higher, higher open your eyes, the time has come to raise a storm
