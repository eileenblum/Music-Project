Plagued by vision, welcome to insanity
Hypnotized I'm longing for redemption
Faced the truth I'm lost in surreality
Caught in this nightmare try to survive

Hear me calling, a voice in the silent night 
Out of blackness into the grace of light

Seeking out what's hidden in the human mind 
Destructive powers which lies deep within 
We are able killing people in a war
You've got to know, you reap what you sow

Hear me calling, a voice in the silent night
Out of blackness into the grace of light

Wake up, open your eyes, feel our hearts are burning inside
Wake up now, start to believe, awaken the world for a new century

Drown in darkness, far beyond reality
And I know the end is almost here
Haunted by the fears from an ancient prophecy
Where are the answers I am searching for

Hear me calling, a voice in the silent night 
Out of blackness into the grace of light

Wake up, open your eyes, feel our hearts are burning inside
Wake up now, start to believe, awaken the world for a new century
(Time to wake up now)
