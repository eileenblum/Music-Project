They're beggin' for mercy, prayin' for a lord, who'll never come
Searchin' for a future, but see this war has just begun
Shattered destinies, a legacy for the weak
Morality, a broken piece of life
Agony, our own created tragedy
They trapped behind the enemy lines 

We are marching on the fields of war
There's no turning back, we are standing strong
One for all and all for one we carry on! Stand up and fight!
We're standing strong! We must unite! 
Until our blood runs cold

They're longing for freedom, innocence in a lost forgotten place
Finding no answers, no reasons for a fallen state
Hidden memories, their wounds will never heal
See them crying a million tears
Agony, our own created tragedy
Awaits the dead behind the enemy lines

We are marching on the fields of war
There's no turning back, we are standing strong
One for all and all for one we carry on! Stand up and fight!
We're standing strong! We must unite! 
Until new hope is born

Liberty for the ones who find victory 
Through all the centuries we carry one 

We are marching on the fields of war
There's no turning back, we are standing strong
One for all and all for one we carry on! Stand up and fight!
We're standing strong! We must unite! 
Until our blood runs cold
