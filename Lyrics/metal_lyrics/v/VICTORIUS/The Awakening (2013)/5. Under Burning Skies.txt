Can't you see all the children paint in blood
Skies are coloured red, full of smoke and dust
There's no mercy for the weak in a world without creed
Who decides? The human race is blind, the human race is blind

Rise above, closer to the sun
Under a burning sky we will be one
Rise above, closer to the sun
Under a burning sky we will be one

We believe, we are safe in our society
But all the lies are hidden in this veil of deceits
All they tell us every minute, every day, will break down
Break down like a wall someday, like a wall someday

Rise above, closer to the sun
Under a burning sky we will be one
Rise above, closer to the sun
Under a burning sky we will be one
We will be one

Rise above, closer to the sun
Under a burning sky we will be one
Rise above, closer to the sun
Under a burning sky we will be one
Rise above, closer to the sun
Under a burning sky we will be one
We will be one
