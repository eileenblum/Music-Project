Never surrender the kings tyranny
We're walking the bridges of fire
Cause we were born in slavery
All we are outlaws in this realm of cruel reality 
Spitting out fire, fight against inhumanity

We will not obey
We'll defeat the pain 
Across the skyline
Hold your head up high

We see the light of day
Set our sails so far away
Lake of hope, light reveal
Beyond the horizon, our way to be free

We see the sunlight at the end of our path
Sailing across oceans, together we will neverlast
Living in freedom, living in wealth and harmony
Our last desires and lake of hope our destiny

We will not obey
We'll defeat the pain 
Across the skyline
Hold your head up high

We see the light of day
Set our sails so far away
Lake of hope, light reveal
Beyond the horizon, our way to be free
