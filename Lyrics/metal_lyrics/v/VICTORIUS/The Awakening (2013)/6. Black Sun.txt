Black Sun shines on me
The fire in my heart need to breathe 
Loosing my control (I'm loosing my control) 
Hate and anger fullfill my soul

Strange powers locked in me
Will wake up the beast
The creature deep inside will be unleashed

Black sun shows me the path
Demon within takes me higher by blood
Black sun shines through my heart
Opens the gates and follows the beast into the dark

It's crawling in my skin
The greed of flesh and blood from deep within
A man in disguise (when fullmoon's shining bright)
Bound to the seasons, bound to the night

Strange powers locked in me
Will wake up the beast
The creature deep inside will be unleashed

Black sun shows me the path
Demon within takes me higher by blood
Black sun shines through my heart
Opens the gates and follows the beast into the dark
