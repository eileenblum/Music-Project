even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I fear no light I fear no pain I fear no salvation. as I stand on the top of
the highest pile of skulls, I inhale fear and exhale anger.. I summon thee, spirits
in the depths and in the stars. confront me as I am, for blasphemy against you
all.. as the fallen remembers the heavens and joy - I cherish all past
reminiscence. the greatest curse of all is we can never forget what we've lost..
"once I was the one to crave your light, and I was the one to ease your toil". the
greatest loss is what dies inside, dies inside of us while we live.. this is how it all
began, I was left with nothing. first you let me touch and feel this sober
adherence, then you make me watch you die.. as I go through the motion of my
life, the tranquility and calmness was what I was looking for. now as I came to
the place of no return, I'll make you all loose your belief and burn.. and when it
all ends, when your hopes are gone, I will understand all the things I've done.
seeing all the graves and weeping men upon, nowhere to go from here, I face the
barrel of a gun.. all knowledge comes from experience. loss and possession,
death and life are one. there falls no shadow, where there shines no sun.
