radiant figure hanging above your heads, deviant image -
apotheosis of a man. crawling crying affiliation, praying dying fearful
acclamation bound.. commemorate the omnipotence and inappropriate
delusion of grandeur. embrace dejection of courage. dismay, cast down your
pride.. remember - you're the one - one of many.. "my sheep hear my voice,
and I know them, they will follow me".. remember - you're the one. the one
of many.. can't you see the contrivance - the word of god - useful misguidance.
killing lying in the name of divine reason. you'll never see his face.. "and I give
them the eternal life, and they will never perish. and no one will ever snatch
them out of my hand".."my father who has given them to me, is greater than
all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand".. when one
person suffers from a delusion, it's called insanity. when many people suffer
from a delusion, it is called a religion.. religion? ..just pull yourself together.
