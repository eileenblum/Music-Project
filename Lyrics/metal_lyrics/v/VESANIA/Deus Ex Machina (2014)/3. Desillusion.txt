the silence, the awakening in the middle of a scornful sky.
examination of conscience, a true believer crescendo of clarity and soul misery,
disintegrating common sense, the human hybris reckoning. for yours is the
kin going and the power and the glory of the possession, the conquering, the
knowing, the fire in the heart and vows to yourself to the world to the lovers to the enemies to deceivers and friends. oh how far can you go in trusting to be
your own god?.. how good does that sound, how sweet is it to your ears.. they
understand, they seize, they teach you to withstand the defeat the confusion
the will to survive with nothing in the end. to maintain a delusion state of mind
of control and of power - blissful sedative. you're free to believe what
you're made of makes some sense. somewhat powerless, roughly hedonist, you
follow the pattern. libertine free of morals, stronger than all you're in control.
damn you oh what a tragedy. the striking irony. relentless soul in a cage of
mortal ghoul.. let others see what you don't see. there is no light in the tunnel..
there is no light whatsoever.. there is this one thing about the mankind -
a bitter lesson to learn, a reason to live: the man is just what others comprehend.
they have their ways to see. so if you seem to have faith in yourself and you're
strong enough to reconcile, acknowledge the fact, that every other conviction
you may have is one miserable pile of secrets.. and no one will ever know,
how deep is your sorrow, how joyful is your happiness. may then your fear of
tomorrow reassure you of your forthcomings.. you'll be dying alone.
