As you keep pushing forward,
you hold on to righteous self for self power sake.
Prove you're not a coward - go on with decisions to make...

In consequence of your creation gods are crying in dismay...

Visions of the future - they will devour you,
Reconciling with the past, what a shame.
Watch the answers change for all questions you ever had.
Comprehend, cogitate, realize it's going nowhere. Obliterate...

The point of absolute prostration,
A man stripped down to the very fear
and none of you shall reach out to him...

Drowned in disease,
Crowned with your fears,
Paralyzing self-righteousness,
All your loves gone in tears.
So close yet so far so distant yet so near.
The aesthetics gives you joy, sweetest of all decoy,
You're barely human, more like a creature.
You may defend what's left, you may pretend to live.
Horrifying death you'll be facing...

I've done everything you wanted,
Like the ancient tragedy.
You're not what you were meant to be.
Means and ends are seen...

"Learning means finding out what you may already know"

But before the curtains close,
To awaken all the hopes again,
Deus ex machina is descending from the top.
The audience holds the breath, faintly rising from their seats,
Eyes wide open, here comes their happy end...
But wait... there's a halter on his neck.
Ghastly pale going down with the ropes...
Averting human's fall in the hangman's dream.
