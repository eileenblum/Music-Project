you're the contamination of earth.. solemn strive for vicious
power, perverse repulse of darkest hour.. and the world will strike back
upon your urge, will hunt you down and you're fertilize this exhausted
soil. why would you even think, why would you even try. for this one and
every moment, your visions are free to die.. solemn strive for real filth,
perverse repulse of sense of guilt.. all of this has happened before, and all
of this will happen again. amor fati, scarab, the recurrence eternal.
hysterical patchwork makes no sense, you catch a piece a glance, and you
tumble down to rise again.. the empires falling, twilights of the gods.
seven deadly joys cacophony. restless hearts sleep alone tonight.
