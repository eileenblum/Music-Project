[performed by Vesania]I light the candles on my own grave 
Deep flames are burning and bleeding 

Night 
Hundreads of eyes without life 
Surround me 
They have darkened dead ones 
Everyone nailed with a golden cross 
To the rocks 

Somewhere 
Surrounded by the dry trees 
On the truncated stump 
Senile from the teers of rain 
Stands a sun-dial 
But there is no sun 
Its face gleams in time with thunders 
Thunders strike the hours 

Woman among the trees 
Has a black ring 
She is going to stand in a magic circle 
Rises her hands 
Tight hand with ring slowly spreads 

Goddess 
Freezed in immobility 
Fingers are growing longrer 
They are creating a thicket 
Of branches 

Her statuesque body 
Becomes a dry trunk 
Now in this place stands a tree 
Dry as others 
But in the place of ring 
Blossoms a black flower 

She was crying 
Now tears fo rain are flowing slowly on her bark 
She was breathing 
Now wind tongles in her branches 
The candles on my grave are burning for her 
They died out 
They succumbed to the breath of wind...
