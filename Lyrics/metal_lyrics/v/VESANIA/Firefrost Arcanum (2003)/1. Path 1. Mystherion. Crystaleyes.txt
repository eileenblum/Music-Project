Shadows of my broken will
Engraved the scar in purity
Yet I shall wear wings I received
For I am to march through
And the blood of Might
Is a frozen tear crystalised

Illuminating black silence

Fallen down through the looking glass
Forsaken by things I used to feel

Follow the path of ice and silver rays

In mirrors luminous blade
Scenario blackheart utopia

Galaxies unveil sources to agonies
Starlit flames crossed the skies
By fire I transcend the transcendance
By fire of everlasting will

No continuity of times
One eternity to one allegiance

Shadows of my broken will
Engraved the scar in purity
Yet I shall wear wings I received
For I am to march through
And the blood of Might
Is a frozen tear crystaliced
