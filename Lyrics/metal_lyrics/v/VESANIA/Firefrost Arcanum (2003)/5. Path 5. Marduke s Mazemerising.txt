Hate you all men!

Blood runs out of your dead lips
You have all got the same eyes
Festered
Stiched ones

You are all so small for me
Almost as small as am I for you

Someday
A Great House of Glass
I will build

I will be going out of It
To take a walk and shoot you

Shoot you all men!

One by one
Slowly

You... and you...
And you motherfucker

Hundert HÃ¶rensÃ¶hne!

But as a first I will shoot this one
Who is guilty of everything
He is right in the middle of my skull
I have got you!
