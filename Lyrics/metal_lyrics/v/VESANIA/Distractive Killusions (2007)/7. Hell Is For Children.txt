Blood of legions runs through my veins
I am the hell of hells
The night lights up the paths
Silently with the thunder
We'll destroy the sun
I play with the angels
Razor sharp blade
Winged creatures frightened
Stampede
They run away loosing feathers
And remains of dignity
Gardens of eden I burn
Vehemence voracious
With the horde of wolves I come
Profanity and death I spit forth
In the silence of my madness
I am the longing spirit
The filthy mass around me, oh!
Kills my joy
Rips my heart out
I wear the mourning for I lost the world
So easily you play with evil
You read the names aloud
All your toys are black
Rebellion for show
Hell that you talk about
Ain't no evil
And let me tell you
You have seen nothing of evil
This hell is for children
Hell is for children
