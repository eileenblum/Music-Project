Command me not!
I am the might that you'll never be
What you've promised us to have after we're gone
This we have here and now, for now is on forever
They judgement day we're feared of
Is the limitation of our minds
Ah! Psychotronic streams
Release the ghosts of the old gods
The one resembling in the looking glass
My demigod
Look at his wings
Slightly too big for the frame
And those transparent eyes...
I'd say the world will crush him down
The thousand suns will die
Before you figure that out
How to handle the burden of those titanic wings
Instead of trying to understand
Enjoy this very moment of clarity
As soon as you die ? the world dies with you
Storm of voices
Winds of brightness
Rivers of gold
Smell the sulphur
Black light!
The radiant prism glows upon the mirror walls
Blindfold and chained fools
Dragging their feet for slaughter
