Far beyond your gods and beliefs
There are worlds you'd never even think of
The question shines through the centuries
If one can get there and back
The history knows so many of them
Who claimed to be enlightened and wise
Their trips made religions for all those
Who look no further than their sight can reach
Spiritual oblivions
Oushing so hard, they made it through the nine gates
And they entered the falls of light and fire
Inaudible astonishment
In awe of the might
Adorned in jewels, shrouded in mists
Challenge the thousand suns!
Do you remember the fallen star
That you have seen from the hill?
You've been waiting for it through your entire life!
And you've lost your wish
For chaining yourself
To this one idea
One thought
One vision
One voice
