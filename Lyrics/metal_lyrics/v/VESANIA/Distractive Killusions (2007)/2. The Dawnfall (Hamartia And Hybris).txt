Up on the hill we stand
Grey worn gowns, motionless
You can't see the faces, you can't see the eyes
All around the hill
As far as the sight can reach
The smoldering ruins
It smells like the incense and burning flesh
Each man kills the thing he loves
By each let this be heard
Some do it with a bitter look
Some with the flattering word
The coward does it with the kiss
The brave man with the sword!
Creation avenged, naught of our fears left
We are the actors of our own perfection
Let the flames burn!
Let the night glow!
Look, this was life!
It was happening all around you
Since now on ? it's all gone
And since now you'll start to feel
That you were the very part of it
Same as go? is nothing without the fairy tale of him
So you are nobody
Without the world that creates you
The world without the end
This night ended up in flames
For all that they have done to us
For all that you have done to us
