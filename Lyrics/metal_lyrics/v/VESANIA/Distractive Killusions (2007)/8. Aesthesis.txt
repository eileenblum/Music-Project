From the south, from the north
Oh snake come forth!
From the west, from the east
Uprising the beast!
The suns collapse in the heavens below!
You deride of my words of aberrant kind
I despise the squareness of your simple minds!
The suns collapse in the heavens below!
Batter my heart, oh three-personed god
This is your time, other is no more
So be careful what you do
This is the last day of the joyless smiles
The swinging pendulum shall knock your heads off!
Rabid looks of your ordained priests
Your tentacles obstinate
Your angels fiery swords
Shall touch me now!
Your obtuse disunity embitters me
Deep abomination to your phantasms
Those children distressed
They don't deserve what they will soon get
All that you will teach them is how to loose the life
As long as you perceive the stars as if they were above you
You're still just a blind and deaf fool
Batter my heart, oh three-personed god
This is your time, other is no more
So be careful what you do
This is the last day of the joyless smiles
The swinging pendulum shall knock your heads off!
