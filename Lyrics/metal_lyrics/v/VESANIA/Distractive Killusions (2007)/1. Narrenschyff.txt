Who are you, servants
And why are you here?
What is this divine displeasure?
Disobeyed disaster is why you're all dismayed
Tertium datum est
For arrogance toward god
For scorning eternal joy
For speaking against god
For the end of power
For envy and hate
For star-gazing
For blasphemy
For the joy of the specter
The foolish mask you wear on
The ringing bells upon your head
Concealed tantrum and bitterness
To withstand his own complete perfections
They who speak, do not know
They who speak, do not know!
They who know, do not speak!
Alas!
Go forwards, legions of faith
Have us prostrated
Ascend the throne of your own dissonance
Manifestation of enlightenment with eyes wide closed
Beware! The stone you used to build of
Turned to dust!
The foolish mask you wear on
The ringing bells upon your head
Concealed tantrum and bitterness
To withstand his own complete perfections
Attach the ropes to your knees and neck
A marionette, a dumb show
And if you feel more
Don't tell anymore
...narragonia...
