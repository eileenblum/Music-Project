Yet underneath laughter and sun
Consequence of all my will and truth
I scatter the ashes of mirrors of me, crushed legions army

Glittering shapes of guardians condemned
Order of proud thoughts awaiting!

Rise on your steel!
But watch the shades on our blades
Why are we loosing their glance and light?!?
There's no one to answer

Heads high, nothing can stand our wrath
Heads high, never stop to dream on
Heads high, no one can bury our realm
Assassination of hypocrites

Now watch them falling
But do you enjoy your dream?
Is 'everything' enough?
Aren't you trying to walk the path you've never understood?

Yet underneath laughter and sun
Consequence of all my will and truth
I scatter the ashes of mirrors of me, crushed
Legions army
