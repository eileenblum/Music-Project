Ugliness, leprosy,
Pestilence on you!

You! I'd hang you
And you! I'd cut your head off, turn out adrift
And kick it on a pavement that one?
I'd drown you in the blood of these two cannot listen to you!
It twists me, when I have you in view
And I feel like vomiting when I think of you!
You're all are right
But live me alone, disappear!

Here the worlds become mixed
Borders interweave
Into dead rolls of events, growing more and more
Each moment bigger with new threads

To be worth dying I'm seeking still
But now I'm loosing my powers

Tonight the monument of everlasting dowry
Crumbled into pieces on the crystal floor
With a dull crash everything will tumble down
Now I know
Just the time is needed
To be back from being desirous of truth
Then just melt into nothingness

I saw the light through the mists abated
To be worth dying I'm seeking still
But now I'm loosing my powers

Now I'm watching their blood flowing
It's dirty and disgusting
Nevertheless it's an awesome feeling to smell its stench
To see, that these ones, who left
Are afraid of it!

Galleries of horizons melting into dusk
Flower-like glares and shadows withering
And blossoming again

Spaces drowning in nothingness
Rest in pain, all of you!
