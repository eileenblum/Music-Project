In a pale glare of candles
I saw heavens wept with blood
Given into eternity oblivion
The battlefield of the holy war

'Who brought the light?
Who turned the glare of our eyes into tears?'

With one piece of melting glass I cried
And this one fell into limbo
Ages long falling
Traversing the far-away galaxies
Kosmos never remembered

'In it the path of stars engraved'

And the light has pealed
Illuminating the omni-existence
The tear fell down upon the monolith
Unveiling the one from myriads of cromlechs

Now, it shines as a crystal-cold flake
The one, who possessed the mystery and become glorified
By those, who know the empire of sins

'In them the path of stars engraved'

And the rain, that rose from the crystal mountain
Washed away the divine blood

Now I shall inherit the strength
With my love and hatred recasted into sword

Among halls of crystals
Palace of me
Frozen mirror-walls reflecting the interior into nothingness
'Eerie labyrinth of paths uneasy'

'Dort wirst du in Flammenmeer erkennen das Eis'

Through dimensions of unforgiven sins
I know that blood must be shed
I will engrave the paths on this earth
Still the light is pale
