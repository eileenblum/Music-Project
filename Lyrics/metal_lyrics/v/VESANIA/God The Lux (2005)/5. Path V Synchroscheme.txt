I walked through the dimensions incorporeal
And I looked with the eyes of the dragon
Through the fabulous gates to the other aeons
To see incredible dreams of mists fosforizing
Enchanting mirages of omnipotent kingdoms

Forget about your earthly wounds,
Grievous disaster, trust no one!
'You are creatures of light
For light have you come, to light shall you go
And surrounding you through every step
Is the light of your infinite being'

'The world of me was not a word
It was not even a thought,
But it was reality more real than this one,
To which I was assigned'

My shadow disappeared at the moment
When I looked at the sun for the last time
'No wonder, therefore in all the world
If a shadow darkens upon my spirit
When I reflect on the fates of men -
How one by one, proud warriors vanish
From the halls that knew them
And day by day, all this earth ages
Droop unto death'

No man may know the wisdom,
Thus spake the sage!

'By your choice dwell you now in the world,
That you have created
What you hold in your heart shall be true
And what you most admire,
That shall you become'

Dreams steal the night
And they go away without farewell
Taking away the consciousness:
What should I become to understand...
