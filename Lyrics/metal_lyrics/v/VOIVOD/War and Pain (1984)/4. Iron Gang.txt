We're always going fast
When it's time to make it high
Don't listen to this scrap
Tonite your gonna fight

Iron gang comes hear
Metal noise is near
The final assault crushes the crowd
And the bestials swffles will explode
Don't stop the rifle fist

The next gang is on my list
Never turn back take care of you

Let's fight...
We're falling in the dark
And taking the leather straps
We always need a shot
When we're given the notch
Iron gang come hear
Metal noise is near
The eye of war fixes your god
No regret we plunge in the riot

[Chorus]

Acid rains fall forever
Soak in the bones
The blood flows like a river
on metal road....

Acid rains fall forever
Soak in the bones
The blood flows like a river
on metal road....
