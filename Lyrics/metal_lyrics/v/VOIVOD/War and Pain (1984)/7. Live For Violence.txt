Armed with a knife in hand
This is my law
Flowing blood on the end
Drink it, drink all
Brought up in hell
Depends on action in agony
Gaining force casting spell
Enduring death
Aahhh! Never die young
Fight for my sound
Ooohh! Betrayers keep out
Of my sight
Live for violence
Yes I live for violence
In the midst of attack
Warrior we fight
Like a savage in a cage
See it, see me
I keep my distance
For my self preservetion
Dead line to meet
Beholder I'm in pain
Cold blooded war
Manipulating all
Battle controls
The Violence is loose
Adenalin shoots
You make me high unwittingly
We whip the flesh
We give you the best
Destroyer call
Not bad after all...
In the midst of attack
Warriors we fight...
Manipulating all
Battle controls
