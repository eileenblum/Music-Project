I'm not afraid when you talk
I can't believe in your money
So we take you by the force
I'm ready to deal today
Suck, suck your bone
Look with fear I'm not alone
Fuck, fuck your soul
We're gonna kidnap and haul
I say go to hell one more time
You don't care for the group
We're gonna rape your child
Watch out here comes the troop

[Chorus]

Why don't you believe on it
You know what we want
Go shit ! I'm not a fish
We're gonna burn your home
