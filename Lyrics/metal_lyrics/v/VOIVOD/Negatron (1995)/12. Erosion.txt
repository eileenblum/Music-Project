Feel deranged
Deep inside
Transparent
Cyanide
Misleading
Illusions
Decide on
A solution
Simulate
Perfection
Disconnect
Reception
Transmit
Insanity
Overlooked
Memeories
The time
The time has come
To turn
To turn around
To see
To see the light
The star
The star beyond
All this pollution
The world
The world is indeed
Will start
Will start to bleed
Your life
Your life becomes
A mess
A mess it's gone
All this pollution
All this pollution
All this pollution
All this pollution
