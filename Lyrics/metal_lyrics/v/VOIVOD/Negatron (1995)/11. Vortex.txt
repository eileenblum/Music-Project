Can you tell me why
Things are not quite right
Look out
This is not fiction
Somehow I'm changing
Watch out
I'm all alone
Out of control
Revolving motion
Wild revolution
Beware
I am paralyzed
Nearly Hypnotized
Get out
I'm all alone
Out of control
I've lost my soul
In Vortex zone
What is going on
Everything is wrong
Want out
Is there a way out
Safer whereabouts
Wipe out
I'm all alone
Out of control
I've lost my soul
In Vortex zone
I'm all alone
