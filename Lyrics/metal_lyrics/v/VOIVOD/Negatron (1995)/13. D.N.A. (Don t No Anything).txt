The rot set in, the rain came in
Searching for a new anaesthesia
Maybe it's time to throw in the towel
I bought the cow, you get the milk for free
Somebody down there likes me
I admit I'm a misfit, you agree, I submit
The night's decayed, the wind is hot
I was born in the USA, I'm deformed by my DNA
Fine example of this great nation
Shrine to humiliation
They said put yourself at my disposal
You'll accept our proposal
But I'm doomed to live
Somebody down there likes me
Cruelty can be unkind
You try to think things are going fine
Or it's a sign that you're going out of your mind
So you submit, so you submit
Don't no anything
I don't say no to anything
I admit I'm a misfit, I submit
Paint thinner &amp; snake juice
It's water from the moon
It's the teardrops of the angels
The nectar of the gods
So so many injections
To handle each and every infection
So many subliminal suggestions
To the president of rejection, I submit
Cruelty can be unkind, drive you out of your mind
Or it's a sign that things are going fine
I admit I'm unfit, I submit
The DNA is DOA all across the USA
Ne sais rien, je ne dis non a rien
Does somebody out there like me?
Have a nice day...
