Aaaargh! Me and my guys are
Trying to keep it high
We'll play all night for you
I'm banging my head 'til I'm dead
As long as you move
We're on the fast way
Delivering the best that I can
Can you see what I'm doing
Running from day to day
Just to let it go
C'mon move your assholes !
Stand up! Right now! Kill off!
Well I've got the command
Did you understand
Attacking is the only way to win
Awaiting the war day and
The inflammation
You're the first who will be burning
If you see the storm,  no time to go down
That's why I'm screaming
No pleasure the pain comes down here
No return don't look back
There's no tomorrow
And if you're a fucker
And don't believe it, I say...
Fuck off and die !
I've got the control
With my heart of stone
I fell the hades in the air
The vibration is in my bones
And the noise keeps the thrill
The adventure has just begun
No religion in this place
You're awaiting for that moment
Forget it and don't loose your time
Don't want to become like that
There's many times to raise hell
There's many ways to live your life
Together we're staying for yell
Don't break your fever
So if you need religion,
Or a god to believe
So if you're a looser or just
A fuckin' wimp...
fuck off and die !!
