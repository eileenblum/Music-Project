There's a new killer in the line
Of the host
He catches his victims and let
Them fall into decay
It's the law of the jungle
One or the other must die
Awaiting unavoidable death in the hole

If you need the horrors of war
See Korgull
The nebulous prowler will come to
Take you and exterminate your life

You take your chance but the
Sky is clouding over
You wanna be out but nobody
Lets you go away
The grand master of fast purification
Know that you'll never survive

If you need the horrors of war
See Korgull
The nebulous prowler will come to
Take you and exterminate your life

Korgull, Korgull is here I'm
Exposed to the direct danger
I'm hearing the echoes of the battle
Korgull walks along the land
He kills and terrorizes me
His name is Korgull...

Awaiting reinforcements
Rematerialize in nothingness
I am not out to reform this world
Just to fight with this creature
I saw him with my own two eyes
He was coming from other worldly
With his vitreous eyes that fix me
It's too late
Korgull rules the earth !!!
