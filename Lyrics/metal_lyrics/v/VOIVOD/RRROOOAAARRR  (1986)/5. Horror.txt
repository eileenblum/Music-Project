We are returning in a
Morgoth land
Far from this fuckin' world
Now I believe that anything exists
And it's for tomorrow
They will come back
Horror! What do you see !
Horror ! We're things of terror
Another fuckin' son of war
Is coming into the wiping out part
He's surviving in the mankind
But horror is found
Every night !....
...Living in the ghetto
With zombies and blood
The horror is real death from above
Here comes the last fighting men
One by one they're passing in the gas
Sin after sin to industrialize
Keep them piteous and left them for dead
Horror! What do you see !
Horror ! We're things of terror
Across the fiery field
To take the flight
People were scared out their wits
Monsters and horrific things
Were on my side
You can't go back don't
Loose your courage
...Living in the ghetto
With zombies and blood
The horror is real death from above
Escaped from the living deads
Gonna be a dreadful thing
Coz the killers are into you
Like me from deep inside
Thrashing with your throat.
...Living in the ghetto
With zombies and blood
The horror is real death from above!
