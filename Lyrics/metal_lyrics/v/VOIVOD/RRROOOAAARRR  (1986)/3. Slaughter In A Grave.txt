It's a killer and it prowls
Night after night
It's a murderer in the vault
It lives for... a fight
It's a story of a soul
That has come for revenge
On murderous grounds he
Seeks his victims for ...the night
Listen to the night for
The shout of the skull
It's the call of death's return
And the vengeance of the god
Slaughter in a grave
It's a badland and the
Storm comes to chill
It's a passage and the killer
Feels remorse to kill... in fear
It's a victim who fixes the man with hate
A dead man drives crime in his
Fate...so near
In the bleak vault the strange
Spirit commands the victim's soul
To return in his body and to
Revenge his bloody murder so cold
On the screaming place the
Mad spirit reigns with his killing soul
On his crazy face his vengeance
Makes its course with fever...
In vaults.
