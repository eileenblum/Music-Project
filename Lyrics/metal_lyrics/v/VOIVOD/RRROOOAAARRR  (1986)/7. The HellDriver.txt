When you take your steering wheel
When you speed up your engine
Your rage makes up your counter
Hell spins and burns your tires
Hit and run again, I eat when I can
I have no limits, my life is a risk
Let's speed the road hog
His sheet iron is hot
The helldriver and his damnation
Speed up in hell to run so fast
When the sound of metal raises
When the smoking valves make a pin
Fuel and oil are my blood
The law is over, I'm out
If you want to stop the speed freak
Prepare a good plan to do it
Coz he's always in the red zone
And he's a runner
of the hell road.
