After the battle in the dark
Side of the desert fields
Am I the winner fight is over
And we'll take the place
Metal burned feel the discord
For a complete destruction
Have no mercy come with us
You're in the meeting
To the death !
Tonite we celebrate
War and our victory
All possessed by the death
To take the force by the blood
Raise your hands for the final slaughter
High pressure marching like
A robot from nowhere
Mutilation we're out to
Conquer all the planet
Creeping weapons see the
Fire blows the sky
Invasion don't stop the
Pressure of pain
Electric power was bursting
In the air
Strange fever it seems like
Your last night
Total disorder brings
The final impact
Come and see what hell looks like
Many men feel the pain endlessly
Forever your country needs you
The world's still waiting to change
Everybody said the thing's
Doing so bad
To the death !
Is what you say
To the death !
Who cares it's the only way
To the death !
Is what you need
To the death !
Turn to black til they bleed.
