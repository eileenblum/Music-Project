I just witnessed
Another club eviction
I wonder what he did
To get this lesson
Just like that crazy singer
Yeah what's his name?

Anyway,
Who will be the next one
To get thrown out?
Just like a garbage bag
Go join your friends
It is time to conform
with conformity
Plastic holds, robot souls

Last call for the rascals
Mr. Clean says
Last call for the rascals

The good old days expired
New kind of people
Prototype generation
All inspected
Shiny chromes, spirit sold

Last call for the rascals
Mr. Clean says
Last call for the rascals

Mr. Clean kills germs
Removal

The homeless out! The poor out!
The punks out!
The colored out! The striped out!
The stains out!
The troubled out! The wilds out!
The wrongs out!
The problems out! The bugs out!
The bands out!

Wipe them out...Wipe them out

The leathers out! The queens out!
The freaks out!
The misfits out! The loud out!
The fly out!
The ugly out! The olds out!
The smalls out!
The bums out! The bad out!
And me out!
And you and you and you all pure?

Nice and clean society
Long live democracy
