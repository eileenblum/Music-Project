There is the need for speed
Everything that exceeds
The point of no return
And this one's gonna hurt
All set before your eyes
A human sacrifice
It's time to clear the ramp
Who wants to take a chance

So let's roll
All night long

I like the smell of fuel
I got myself a bruise
The only time it's real
It's when I shift the gears
A few in every town
The death defying clowns
Gather with all their rigs
And kids are burning wheels

Yeah let's roll
All night long
Always pushing it to the X-Stream
Metal

One game to entertain
The gain is the pain
You might crash in flames
Or jump off the planes
The pavement's made of stones
In parts with broken bones
But you ain't out of luck
You live around the clock

Yeah let's roll
All night long
Always pushing it to the X-Stream
Metal

1001...1002...1003...Open

Another world record
And this one missed the curve
What's gonna make me stop
Who's gonna take my guts
One split second and go
One tire had to blow
C'mon and give me five
I died of what I liked

So let's roll
All night long
Always pushing it to the X-Stream
Metal

1001...1002...1003...Open
