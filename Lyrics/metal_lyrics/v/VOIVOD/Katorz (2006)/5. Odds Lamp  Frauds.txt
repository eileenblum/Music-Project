Odds and frauds
From people above
All suspicions
No suspensions
These bastards
Always have too much power
They're all swindlers
And they work together
Shaking hands
And smile on TV
And not even ashamed

I'm talking millions
Behind closed doors
The politicians
Always want more

Odds and frauds
The people's applause
Puzzles of lies
Monopolize
That's why the food for oil
Won't succeed
The third world countries
Will stay in need
As we watch
The kids die on TV
But no one will complain

I'm talking millions
Behind closed doors
The politicians
Always want more

Odds and frauds
And not even ashamed

Odds and frauds
Made with gloves
Organized crimes
Came into line
Your vote is for those
Who take your money
Your money is for those
Who take your money
Your money is for those
Who make great party
Making cheers
And smile for TV
And not even ashamed

Odds and frauds
Odds and frauds
Odds and frauds
