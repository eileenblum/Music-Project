Here they come
With their guns
March parade
Under the sun
Here they come
Helmets on
Stoic faces
The stand has begun

Fear is growing with the hours
Intensified by the fever
Curfews
Dead town
Black out
Paranoia

With an axe
Special tool
Busting in
Breaking rules
Just like dogs
Hooked on drugs
Blind searching
For marginality

It uses all kind of power
A message is blowing
Through the speakers
Curfews
Strip search
Black out
Paranoia
Propaganda

I put my hands
In the white sand
Here used to be
Paradise island

Vacation goes in order
Terrorized villagers
Supervised foreigners
Covered up massacres

So much of a nonsense
Better hide
The evidence

So much of a disgrace
Better leave
Without a trace

All includes all
