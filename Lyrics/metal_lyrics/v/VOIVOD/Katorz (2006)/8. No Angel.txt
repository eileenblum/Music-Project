I'm trying to escape
But each time I failed
I'm searching the key
The opportunity

The storms over the years
Of screams in my ears
The dust in my eyes
And the violent gusts of lies

My chain is not so long
My dignity is gone
I'm crawling in the mud
Just to get my grub

My heart is locked
In a cage
This treatment
Is not sane
You handcuff
Your loving, your loving
Is a crime
You're no angel

My mind
Is behind bars
The future
Seems to dark
I can see
Your demon's horn
As you stick out
Your reptile tongue
I've got hallucinations
Your loving is a crime
You're no angel

Nah, nah, nah

Free
