Made for you
Which one
Will look the best?
The transformation
Is in process

Made out of vanity
Everything
To reach eternity
100 percent restored
Biologic generator
In tubes
The liquid flows
The plasma
Feeds you by a hose
It's one new you indeed
But the results
Aren't guaranteed

In the valley
Of silly clones
Rebuilt people
To the bone
In the valley
Of silly clones
Where the people
Turn to stone

In the valley
Of silly clones
People made of
Styrofoam
In the valley
Of silly clones
Where the people
Die alone
