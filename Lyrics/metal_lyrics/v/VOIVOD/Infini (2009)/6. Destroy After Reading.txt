The hidden secrets are asleep, this vault is locked and sealed
Taking so long to be revealed, a dead man cannot speak

All the mysteries you can find, who wants to keep you blind
So never believe what they say, be brave, don't be afraid

Go figure, go figure, go figure out!

Black covered words on pages, these files are kept for ages
Who's taking so much precaution, who's making new versions
Revolving doors keep turning, some heads will be rolling
Never underestimate when it's right in your face

Go figure, go figure, go figure out!

The money they spent to fill the ignorance
No time remaining, destroy after reading

All we don't know

Go figure, go figure, go figure out!

All we don't know
