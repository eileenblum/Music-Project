We got to leave now, we got to load now, we got to love now [x3]

All aboard now, time to roll on
1-2-3-4 shut the damn door
All drunk on fun, band on the run
Turn off the lights, live this life twice

So now how does it feel?
So now does it feel real?

Crack the windows, there is freedom one every breath you take
As the wind flows, a rain song is getting to my brain

Miles after miles, songs after songs
Drive through daylights right to the sun
You by my side where you belong
Turn off the lights, live this life twice

So now how does it feel?
So now does it feel real?
