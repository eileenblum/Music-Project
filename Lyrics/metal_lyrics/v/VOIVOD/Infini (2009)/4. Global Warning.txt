Is there a way out? I still live in doubt
When I watch TV and everything I see
People live in dreams, killer war machines
Selling pesticides and forcing genocide

I've got my own approach, I finish up my roach
I think the world is doomed and it's for pretty soon

Is there a way to get everyone in the same pace
To make this waste a better place
It's not a game, it is a race, the future is now!

Is there a way out? I still live in doubt
Don't have the same goals, no one answers the phone
I think after while you got to realize

Everyone lives for themselves and no one shares
And nothing's fair
The truth lives there without a care
The power rules the end is now

Is there a way out? I still live in doubt

Global warning

I've got my own approach, I finish up my roach
I think the world is doomed and it's for pretty soon
Everyone lives for themselves and no one shares
And nothing's fair
The truth lives there without a care
The power rules the end is now
