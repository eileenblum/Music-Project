God phones, God phones
Weird voices on the line that can't be identified
Tell me I'm the chosen one, my mission has begun
God phones, God phones, God phones, God phones

Keep all this for yourself, I swear the god that's what he said

God phones

God phones, God phones
Weird voices on the line that can't be identified
Tell me I'm the chosen one, my mission has begun
