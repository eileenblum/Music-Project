Nature's life, fades away
And the world, is at stake
While our days, are numbered
the lobby's talking, whatever

Blah, blah, blah is that all you say?
Blah, blah, blah is that all you say?

Many times, we have failed
Time for change, but too late
Indicators, long time red
Hell awaits, waits ahead

Blah, blah, blah is that all you say?
Blah, blah, blah is that all you say?
