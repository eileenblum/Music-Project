Here I stand, wait and breath
Looking down to the city
Yes sometimes my anger grows
Makes me want to explode... Volcano!

From the bottom of my core
Pressure build-up, more and more
Can you feel under your feet
All the vibes and all the heat... Volcano!

And before you realize
There'll be fire in the sky... Volcano!

Time to ring the fire bell
I will turn this place to hell... Volcano!

I am not predictable
But I'm so much capable
Of serious mass destruction
and stupendous extinction... Volcano!

And before you realize
I'll be taking all your lives... Volcano!

All in all will be lost
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust... Volcano!

Yes I am burning inside
Waiting, holding it inside
When is always the question
As for my next eruption

But someday will be the day
I will make you go away
Some of you will have to die
Stay away from paradise... Volcano!

And before you realize
There'll be fire in the sky... Volcano!

Time to ring the fire bell
I will turn this place to hell... Volcano!

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
All in all will be lost... Volcano!
