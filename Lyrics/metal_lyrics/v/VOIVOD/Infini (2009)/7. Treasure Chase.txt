I'm a pirate of the modern age
And for some I'm the worst of renegades
Chasing hearts of gold

I'm a thief cruising the seven seas
But nothing compares to what I've see
One day on an island

The treasure I've found in your eyes

I'm the captin of the Roaming Souls
I am lost and my boat is getting old
Alone I'm a ghost

I'm a mad sailor stucked at the port
Drunken singing, sitting on the docks
I'm drawing a map

The treasure I've found in your eyes

All the diamonds out of this world
All the precious stones dug from earth

I must do something or you'll be found
I must do something or you'll be gone

Maybe someone knows the secret
Maybe someone knows how to get

The treasure I've found in your eyes
