In orbit here I float
Spinning around the globe
Fixing a telescope
I've lost the nuts and bolts

In orbit here I stand
Switch buttons in my hand
Jumpstart a satellite
Feels like I'm super bright

I'm so high, in the sky

One cosmic repairman
One earth reflects on lens
I see you, in the blue

In orbit here I cruise
By myself in my suit
I might be just a fool
My harness has broken loose

I'm thinking about you down below [x2]

I can't slow down my entry speed
I am attacked by space debris
I am exposed to sunray heat
Soon I'll burn up in the atmos... fear!

Home Sweet Home [x4]
