The operator chamber is filled with smoke
Click track, then timer, then creation mode
Take your days as a block and crank them loud
Beat the clock like a rock, an answer will come out

Not thinking of anything, guided by fears and dreams
Mixing our emotions loading a rebellion

Confined in a closet, exploring space
What you think, who you are
Becomes the same
It all gets together, visions appear
Then the room gets colder, I think you're here

Not thinking of anything, guided by fears and dreams
Mixing our emotions, loading a rebellion

Images of death, of wars to come
The catastrophes, poison, pollution
And all that is good, became destruction
But so far so good, the end of reason

And all that is good, became illusion
But so far so good... just keep on...
How far to go?
