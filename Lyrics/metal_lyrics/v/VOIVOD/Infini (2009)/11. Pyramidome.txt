Higher, higher, higher in this elevator
Down, down, down, throughout the center
Side by side, trusses in angles
All in all, supported from above

Rapid transit pods, interconnecting nodes
Exoskeleton town, one city off the ground, suspended in the air

Higher, higher, higher in this elevator
Down, down, down, throughout the center
Side by side, floating down under
All in all, we live together now, from birth 'til death

Together now, from birth 'til death

Inmates are giving smiles, they will stay here for life
Walking in these tubes, defying physics rules, suspended in the air

Higher, higher, higher in this elevator
Down, down, down, throughout the center
Side by side, floating down under
All in all, we live together now, from birth 'til death

Together now, from birth 'til death
