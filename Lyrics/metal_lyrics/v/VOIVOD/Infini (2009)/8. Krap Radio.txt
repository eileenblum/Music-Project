Good Morning everyone, another gray day has begun
We want the drama of your life
Talk free, talk free

One word says it all [x4]

Make you cry, put you on your knees
Make you buy something you don't need
Call now, you'll get a second one
For free, for free

One word says it all [x4]

We want to take it out of bounds with some emotional breakdown
If this is happening to you
Speak free, speak free

Give me more horror stories
Give me torture tears and tease
Brought you to you by stupid shit
For free, for free

Krap Radio, is it all you wanna hear?
Krap Radio, Krap Radio, Krap Radio, Krap Radio

You're filling my head (with krap in my head)
