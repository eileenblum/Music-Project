Low ceiling, chains hanging
Shiny Chrome, leave me alone
Neon lights, blind my sight
Dried blood stains, this is insane

You came to see me, don't want to see you
I live in my world, so do not disturb
The thing inside me, won't let me free
It is so unreal, it's not a bad dream

I've lost the time, I've lost my mind
I'm missing you, yes all of you
Is it a shame, to ease the pain?
Me and my bones, want to go home

You're talking to me, should I believe you?
It's sounding so fake, I'm feeling so lame

The thing inside me, won't let me be
The nightmare is real, let me out of me

You came to see me, it's good to see you
I'm in a new world, you're still in yours

The thing inside me, no longer in me
You wish I'm still there, I wish you were here
