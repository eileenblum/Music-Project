Since I was born, my world's a battlefield
Experiences, taught me all for real
Scars are tattoos, with much better stories
And my old bones, reminds me where I've been

From the cave, to the roof, then on stage, on the loose

Me and my pals, we're nomads on the run
No possessions, we're carrying loads of fun
And we know well it won't last forever
Where we're going never really matters

From the cave, to the roof, then on stage, on the loose

Whatever you bring on, we've been fighting for so long
When everything goes wrong
You got to take it... take this... as it comes!

Who needs glory with all that's going on
Small victories will keep us moving on

From the cave, to the roof, then on stage, on the loose

Whatever you bring on, we've been fighting for so long
Like a bottle of your own

You got to take it... take this... as it comes!
