The one so down is alive
It is a part of my plight
The one inside makes a sign
And keeps an eye to the light

I sense panic overboard
Obscure, viscid sprawling fog
I hear a sonar rumour
That says I'm far from the shore

How I am stricken with non-emotion
It crawls up above
Periscopic cognition
Where it strives to dwell
In abnormal contortion

I navigate in my maze
Investigate to be safe safe safe safe

Across the ocean
Of sheer compromise
There is no matrix
Not even a guide

The last wave of sanity
Rolls over my frequency
Skyline under water field
The depths above the high seas

How I am stricken with non-emotion
It crawls up above
Periscopic cognition
Where it strives to dwell
In abnormal contortion

I navigate in my maze
Investigate to be safe safe safe safe

Across the ocean
Of sheer compromise
There is no matrix
Not even a guide

A twilight house keeper
Dim-on dim-off now
A concrete cyclops
Blinking down his dull eye

Does this code signal
Something somewhere somehow?
Why me? It goes on and on and on

Please no

Too late for S.O.S.

Mute island, fish-eye view
Circling the border line
No resource, no rescue
I'm stranded, I'm otherwise

The error is perfect
Like this sub-effect
Of my kind... my mind, my mind

The one so down is alive
It is a part of my plight
The one inside makes a sign
And keeps an eye to the light

To the light
