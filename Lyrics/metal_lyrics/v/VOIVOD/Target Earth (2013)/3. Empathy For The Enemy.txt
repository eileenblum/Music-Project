Stepped out for a smoke
Sun's down, set on cold
Weird thoughts have to go away
Torments to evacuate

Dark side of doomed life
Winter never dies
Black ice, dead end sky
Deep eyes, look inside
Empathy for the enemy
Too bad, I am drilled to say... No!

Regrets will forever last
Images filling up my glass
I drink to my enemies
White shadows in my reveries

Craving for day light
Bad curse never dies
Trouble waits in line
Haunted by these cries
Empathy for the enemy
So far, I've been forced to stay...

No! No!

Heart shield
Heats sleeps
Eyes closed
Night ghosts

Randomize
Analyze
Supervise
Purify
Mystify
Hypnotize
Terrorize
Mobilize
Galvanize
Glorify
Idolize
Justify
Genocide

Each one on its side
We try to figure out why
This non-sense has gone
Way over the borderline
There's no glory day
No victory and no parade
When people pay the price
Uniforms, a disguise

Empathy for the enemy
Will I be able to say...
