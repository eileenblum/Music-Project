I'm still standing, thousands of years old
The wind is whistling on black deserts of coal
The ruins are waiting for invading souls
Vestige of glory, buried in a vault

Wasteland legacy, history carved on walls
Tragic destiny, wounds of ancient wars
Horizon detonates, birds fall from the sky
Fatal morning rays and death forever last

Fire rises, signs of time fade away 

We've gambled our fate
Now's the end of the game
Didn't have a good hand
Bluffing came to an end
Set the world to restart
Hope this time we'll be smart
Set the time to zero
Let's cross the fingers and go

Fire rises, signs of time fade away 

Playing risk has a cost 
All the pawns have been lost
We've been rolling the dice
Betting on our lives
Set the world to restart
Hope this time we'll be smart
Set the time to zero
Let's cross fingers and go

Life grows, leaves glow
Live slow, time flows
Sky moves, ground grooves
Clouds ooze rain, blues,
Wind, fields, roads yield
Should we engage ourselves
Into a brand new world
Should we devote ourselves
To find a brand new world
Can we afford a place to live,
A brand new world
A brand new world
