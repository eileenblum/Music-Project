Auto-creation crash
Viruses spreading fast
Cyber-protection failed
All safety shields disengaged

Corporate dissolutions
Institute disillusions
Toxic assets, unstable
All system trust disabled

Cannot save, cannot trade
Be afraid, you could die!
Cannot search, cannot trace
File erased, you will die!

Crushing down firewalls
All basic structures fall
World's info disappeared
No more access, it's been cleared

No more power, the world's on fire
A few more hours, our time is over

One by one
Leaders gone
One by one
Countries done

I am the space avenger
I execute my orders
A satellite controller
A judgement day creator
Monitoring from my room
Hacking this world that I rule
I am the god eraser
I am a planet killer

One sacrifice, no god, no sign
This sacrifice, for good, for life
One sacrifice, no gold, no harm
This sacrifice, new games, new lives

A few more hours...
