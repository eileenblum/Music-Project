One scene of crime, corrupted sci
The job inside, all lies denied
One drop will make you think
One sip and then you'll sink
A madness being restrained 
The fear to turn insane

The windows shine, daylight defined
Gamma ray tides, the curves of time
One shot will give you strength
One more will make you strange
Visions of dots and stains
This war inside your brain

The secret has been kept
Anonymous project
No one will make me talk
Ain't gonna make that call
Who said you would?
I say, you should!

Locked in a hotel room
These men will get you soon
I say, you should!
Distorted face, fire escape
In all truth there's a lie!
Behind the truth, there's a lie!

Watching the corridors
Eerie noise at my door
No one will make me talk
Ain't gonna make that call
Who said you would?
I say, you should
They know you know too much
Your story will be lost
I say, you should!
Throughout the glass
I'm free at last
In all truth there's a lie
Behind the truth
There's a lie

Scratched wallpapers
Behind, are the words
Reading backwards
News in the mirror
Losing faith, losing face
Chrome reflections
Lights addiction
Reversed images
Negatron spaces
Losing faith, losing face
In this free fall, now I recall
This could be just me, end of story

I can fly, I'm alive
I can fly, so alive!
Throughout the glass
I'm free at last
In all truth there's a lie
Behind the truth
There's a lie
