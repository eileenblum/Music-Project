I kept running in the woods
As fast as the ancients could
Could not fight these kinds of beasts
Who live for gigantic feasts
I don't want 'em to cut my hair
My strength would fall from my head
Changing the way I speak
Until I'm becoming weak

We'll be reborn (Kluskap O'Kom!)
Behind the sun (Kluskap O'Kom!)
Just like the storm (Kluskap O'Kom!)
Will ever come (Kluskap O'Kom!)

There goes the self-esteem
In the fumes of gasoline
