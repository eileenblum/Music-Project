[originally by Hawkwind]I
I just took a ride
In a silver machine
And still feeling mean

Do you want to ride
See yourself going by
The other side of the sky
I got a silver machine

It flies
Sideways through time
It's an electric line
To your zodiac sign

I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
In my silver machine

It flies
Out of a dream
It's antiseptically clean
You gotta know where I've been

Do you want to ride
See yourself going by
The other side of the sky
I'm in a silver machine

I
Said I just took a ride
In a silver machine
I got it still feeling mean

It flies
Sideways through time
It's an electric line
To your zodiac sign

I'm your silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
I got a silver machine
(Silver machine)
