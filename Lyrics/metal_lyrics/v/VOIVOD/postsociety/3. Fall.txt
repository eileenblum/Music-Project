Is it that time again?
Put your jacket on
It's pouring outside, summer is gone

Time to deal with other problems
Feeling deep, remaining silent
Admiring colors as the wind blows

So beautiful it brings out sorrow
Catch the moment coz it won't last
The little ghosts are coming back

Here comes darkness, sooner everyday
And the sky gets confused
the time has come to stay inside
With your monsters in your room

Here comes boredom, roaming around
Walking softly without shoes
Making up stories, telling me lies
Madness, daily abuse

My self is not what it used to be
My self is not what you want to see
Brain decay, inner enemies
Metldown, T.O.X.I.C.

My self is not a peaceful place
My self is not a graceful state
Weird thoughts, soul injuries
Mind fail, P.A.N.I.C.

Marching on frozen dreams
On thin ice of self esteem
My heart is cold, I cannot feel
Fall is here, death is near

And my head is filled with random fears
Each step leads to a dead end street
Every corner, a horror scene

My self is not... My self is not...
My eyes begin to freeze
My mouth starts to bleed
I turn into a zombie

I shall, I must, get out of this place before

My self is not... My self is not...
My body is so sore
Right through the core
Before I'm no more

I should, I do, get out of this place before

My self is not... My self is not...
