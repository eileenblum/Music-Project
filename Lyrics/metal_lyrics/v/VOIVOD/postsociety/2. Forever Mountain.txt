Don't give up, son
Never stop
Climb that rock, son
To the top.

Reach for the sky
Ready to lope
Rift on the ice
Tie up that rope
Dropping supplies
Way down the slope
Before my eyes
There goes all our hopes!

We always knew, it was no easy way
Anything can go wrong
We're following the path of crazy dreams
Constantly falling
Obstinately crawling
No choice but to hold on...on and on.

There comes a time, when the plan disappears
Dilemma keeps you strong
Dancing with death on the edge of our fears
Constantly falling
Obstinately crawling
No choice but to hold on...on and on.

Our remains won't be found here
In this impossible world
Sorry, there's no turning back
Adventure is the word
Never made any promises
Now this beauty is revealed.

So here we are, on the roof of the world
We belong to the sky
Now we have reached the point of no return
Constantly flying
Obstinately crawling
No choice but to go on...on and on.
