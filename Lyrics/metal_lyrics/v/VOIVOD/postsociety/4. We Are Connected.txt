Tie together this old waste
Flight cases and rolls of tape
Connecting, returning home
Chewing cups of styrofoam.

Template for shocking news
Terminal of awful blues
Moving lips, but there's no sound
Final call, and now you're gone.

So far, mind blowing far
So hard, heart breaking hard.

So hard, forced to understand
A whole world has reached its end
I'm fastened to reality
A boarding pass for eternity.

In the desert lives a burning man
There's a probe about to land
All my thoughts are taking off
Above the clouds, where I get lost.

So far, mind blowing far
So hard, heart breaking hard
Sadness fumes
Fuel perfume
Mind excused
Soul exhumed
Spiral down
Swirl around
Without sound
Leave the ground.

Fly forever
Reach the never
Life's not over
Be remembered.

We just keep on traveling
Is it worth giving...
So much in the after?
So much on the future?

We are made for riding
Is it worth saving...
So much to carry on?
Too much for never more!
...Never more!

There's no real destination
In no time, it's a new horizon
The chemtrails across the sky
Are guiding us all through the night.

At the counter of lost and found
Touch the ground, deep and profound
We have a friend, he passed away
We'll meet you there, we'll go one day
So far, mind blowing far.

So hard, heart breaking hard.
