Carbon fibers, roadkill masters

Trail of dust rises in the air
Burning wrecks lie everywhere

Top fuel blowers Helmet crushers

Dark smoke has blackened the sun
The raging phases has begun

Rusted future, blindfold riders

Destiny is speeding out of control
Social crash, it's the end of the road

Stay in your lane
And keep your strength
This land became
A world of pain
Oh such a shame!

Wasteland leaders, life form dealers

quest for power, mindless pursuit
Straight forward on ruining routes

Roaring desert, fear takes over

Only the dead are allowed to escape
And they'll be glad to leave this place

Stay in your lane
And Keep your faith
This life remains
Under the blade
Yeah such a shame!

In order to survive!
Do anything to make the day
Take your chance or stay away
In none we trust, in order to survive...
In order to survive!
There is nothing in front of you
Except this mess, that's sad but true
We all saw it coming but it was too late too soon!

Industrial ghosts, forbidden zones
Electric fence, estricted promise land
Dead sky above, our lives without love
Red moon guiding us back to primal dust
There was a time when we still had time
To make the big change, so now, here's your change

Deep down inside, in the crust of mankind remains
Magma finds its way out, explodes, and rises in the sky, then falls like rain

In order to survive
Do anything to save your soul
Just keep your eyes on endless roads
In hope we trust, in order to survive...
In order to survive!
There is a place I know for sure
Where there is life and the water is pure
But it's not mine and it's not yours...
But it's not mine and it's not yours...
