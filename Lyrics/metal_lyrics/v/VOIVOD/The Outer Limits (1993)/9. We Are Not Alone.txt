We were lost in the valley
Midway between night and day
Which way's the goddamn highway??

"The car breaks down"

So, we walk ten million miles
All across some countryside
Until lightning struck the sky

"The rain came down"

Hey!
This house looks so creepy
Anybody home?
Look out!  There's somebody!
We're not alone

Up three creaking wooden stairs
An old man with no hair...stares!
Sitting in a rocking chair

"Please be my guest"

He says I'm glad you are here
I have been waiting for years
You see, they land in my field

"Tonight's the night"

Hey!
You'll see...Don't you worry
Make youself at home
Maybe they'll be friendly
Or maybe not, but
Hey!
What if we're all crazy?
What if we're alone?
Then the sky is empty
And we're alone
We are alone
We're not alone
Are we alone?...alone...

Looking deep into the night
We'll see if the old man's right
So far...there's nothing in sight

"Except frostbite"

Flying low without a sound
Look out!  They are all around
Spinning down, touching the ground

"Damn he was right!"

Hey!
We see!  We're not worried!
We're not going home
They are green and ugly
Or maybe not...but,
Hey!
They are green and ugly
Who wants to go home?
God!  We are so lucky!
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
(Welcome aboard)
