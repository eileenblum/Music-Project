NOW I'VE COME BACK
CRUSING THE DAY MY MAKER TOOK
MY STRENGTH AWAY
PLANET CONTROL
TO SAVE MY WORLD
MISSION COMPLETE
THOUGH I AM WEAK
LOST IN THIS WORLD
I AM FORLORN
LOSS OF THIS WORLD
I AM FORLORN
I FIGHT ALONE
ME WITH MY SELVES
BATTLING GHOSTS
PART OF THIS HELL
GIVE ME SOME REST
I FEEL SO OLD
MY BLOOD IS DRAINED
TURNING ME COLD
LOST IN THIS WORLD
FEELING FORLORN
LOSS OF THIS WORLD
I AM FORLORN
LOST IN THIS WORLD
FEELING FORLORN
LOSS OF THIS WORLD
I AM ALONE
SHADOWS HERE
IN THIS PLACE
PLANET FEAR
DEATH IS NEAR
ANARK MY GIVEN NAME
CLOSE MY EYES
FADE AWAY...
