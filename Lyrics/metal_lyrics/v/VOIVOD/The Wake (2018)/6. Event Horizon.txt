Water keeps on rising and there's no solution
Miles of ice fade away, what a correlation
Global mess refugees in a mass mutation
Our own enemies are lost in misconception

Micro-bacterias resurrect from their sleep
Frozen deep in the past, heat is all they need
Emissions in the air, a prehistorical disease
Spreading our everywhere, a virus is released

Tell me what it's like
Not knowing where you'll be sleeping at night
Aren't you afraid?
Knowing this world will never be the same
Now it's too late
And we are to blame
irreversible process is engaged!

This is way beyond, way beyond, way beyond
Speculations
Way beyond, way beyond, way beyond
All predictions

Since your birth
A microchip implanted under your skin
Where you are, what you do
They sure know everything
No privacy, no dignity, no self whatsoever
This entity, identity, you're a bar-code number

Does it feel right?
Preconceived future is ruling your life
Oh! What a shame
In the name of progress we fall in disgrace
It's a new phase
We have to face
Irreversible process is engaged!

This goes way beyond, way beyond, way beyond
Expectations
Way beyond, way beyond, way beyond
Any fiction
Way beyond...

Ah!
The human nature always needs more power
Only cares for now, don't look any further
Again, again, again, again
Ah!
These human failures, born to overtake
Steal from brothers, repeat the same mistakes
Again, again, again, again
Ah!

Tomorrow is so grey
Doomy sky, dark landscape
Evil eyes, ravaged face
Dead zone signs, minds encaged
As we go, the level rises
The tension grows, the world is divided
The call for war, decisions made
In space we burst without a trace
