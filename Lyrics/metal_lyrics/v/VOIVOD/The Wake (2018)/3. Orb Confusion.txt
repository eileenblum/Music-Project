Woke up this morning
And maybe I should be afraid
Weird news are leaking
Red flags arise in my brain
Strange things occurred far out in the deep space
Ocean disaster, a mission that failed

Forecasts of conflict
Frenetic panic, all hell breaks loose
Cosmic polemic
High madness on the move
Into the spiral, agreed or denied
Fast rotation in a vortex of lies

Now! What should I do?
Where do I go?
How to escape?
Now! Orb confusion!

Spreading in no time
The viral news are still on
Whole cities on fire
Chaotic religious breakdown
Leaders of nations are hiding away
Maybe the fate of the world is at stake?

Now! What should I do?
Where do I go?
How to escape?
Now! Orb confusion!

No more incredulity
No more false reality

I always knew
This could be the truth

Now it's undeniable
Now it's irreversible

It's not a lie
It fits so right

It's scary, it's crazy
Scary! Crazy!
Social structures falling down
