This nice spot that I found
Connected to the ground
I'm staying here all night
Staring at the open sky
'Til my eyes bleed!

Now, what should I do?
Where do I go?
How to escape?
Now!

You will never switch him off
When you're hypnotized
Don't you dare to call his bluff
He's well organized...

In a coil, ride the void, past destroyed
Spirit interface
In the crust, from the lost
All across, life regenerates!

The wake! The wake!
Look up at the sky
See me passing by
The wake! The wake!
I'm waving goodbye
Enjoying the ride

You live alone, we live alone!
The dream is gone
Your time is done!

In the desert of unknown tales
Gold temples of war disgrace
From the secret vault of Holy Power
Magnified field blasting tower!

Fast! In a maze of your own
Passed! Through the gate

Hard to be heard
No one is listening
You can't be seen
If the sun refused to shine!
Feelings get hurt
And no care is given
Such a lonely star
In darkness confined!

Dragged by the sun
Steady on the run
Caught in a race
Unlock a new space

In my inner galaxy
Is there something left for me?
Through the mirror there i go
Always moving...
Always moving...

Scrolling down in paradise
Castaway and insecure
A wonder world that isn't yours
You might forget to live your life

This is the end of dormancy
From the seabed underneath
Millions of years of dormancy
This thing will change our destiny

This is way beyond
Way beyond, way beyond
Way beyond
Way beyond, way beyond
This goes way beyond
Way beyond, way beyond
Way beyond
Way beyond, way beyond

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
It's scary, it's crazy
Scary! Crazy!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
It's scary, it's crazy
Scary! Crazy!

A new era has arrived
To the ones!
Is there some use for mankind?
To the ones!
The time is still ruled
By the sky, the sky...
To the ones!
