In my inner galaxy
Is there something left for me?
Through the mirror there i go
Always moving
As we speak, the end is near
You're farther than you appear
Gaining seconds in your time
Always moving

Fast! In a maze of your own
Passed! Through the gate
Fast! In your act you have shown
Passed! What it takes

In my future memory
Side by side, separately
We both live on layers of chrome
Always moving
As we meet our final days
The spinning core disintegrates
In raging speed we'll soon collide
Always moving

Dragged by the sun
Steady on the run
Caught in a race
Unlock a new space
Purged in a course
Driven by the force
Time is our mind
What we left behind

In a coil, ride the void, past destroyed
Spirit interface
Laser souls, crack the molds,
Distance folds, depth illuminates
Neutralized, sterilized, purified, energy remains
In the crust, from the lost
All across, life regenerates

To the ones, in the realm of the dead
You'll be forever living in my head
To the ones, those I miss the most
We'll be together lost in the unknown
To the ones...

Fast! In a maze of your own
Passed! Through the gate
Fast! In your act you have shown
Passed! What it takes
