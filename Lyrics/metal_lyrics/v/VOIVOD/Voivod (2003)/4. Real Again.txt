The deal is on the table
I'm happy, but scared
There is no reason why
It should be no sweat
And in the end
I'll find my way home
When I climb up the stairs
Will I be the same one?

Sick as always
This is turning insane
I'm not wasting my time
This one goes overnight

Cool as always
I do things my way
I'm not ruining my life
And this city haunts me again

If you're in, I'm in
Is this real again? Yes!

We'll keep our plan
The way it is
And if something turns bad
I hope God is next door
I am a good soldier
I'll fight until the end
You gotta be careful, full
I've got a broken hand

Broke as always
I get dough where I can
I also have bad sides
When I walk through the night

Dead as always
I'm reborn every day
I don't know what's inside
But this city haunts me again

If you're in, I'm in
Is this real again? Yes!
