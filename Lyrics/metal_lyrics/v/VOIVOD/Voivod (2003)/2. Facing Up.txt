Why do you wish to live in an ideal world?
Why do you think, that God will always be there?
Is it so hard to see things like they are?
Maybe one day, you'll stop living in a dream
Maybe not

Why religion, or magic or anything else?
What do you mean, love is not all we need?
Is it so hard to look at death every day?
Maybe one day, you may say this is for real
Maybe not

Facing up
Maybe not
Facing up
What if not?

So many problems of science involved
Complexity and basic principles
Observations of the empty space
Still searching for the final theory
Yeah the final theory
About our fate
Destiny
The dark energy

Facing up
Maybe not
Facing up
What if not?
