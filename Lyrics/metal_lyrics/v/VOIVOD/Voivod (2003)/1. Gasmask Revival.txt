Yeah! You'll have to wear this my friend
You'll have to throw rocks once again
Hurry up get yourselves together
Because it's for now and for the future
Hold your breath, control your fear
Remember why you're here
Everything else will go wrong
Unless this has settled down

Just keep it in mind

It's a good day to express yourself
It's a nice day to raise hell as well

That's the way I'm feeling too
You're waiting here and you don't have a clue
Beyond the fence they're watching you
And there is not much you can do
We are saying no more lies
Tear gas won't make us cry
Stand for your right and yell my son
And don't forget what they have done

No, I'm no more a good citizen?and never was

It's a good day to express yourself
It's a nice day to raise hell as well
I got hit by a rock on the head
And now I'm seeing red
