So we are ready for more adventures
No crystal ball to see the future
Driven by a need to create
On every mile we ride our fate

In my heart
In my soul
In my blood
In my bones

It really does make you feel strong
Like you would be forever young
Day after day sharing and giving
Reinventing the ways of thinking

In my heart
In my soul
In my blood
In my bones
In my hands
On my face
In my eyes
Here's my rage

This is our time
This is our song
This is our lives
We carry on

No need to say, it's far from pure
Once you've touched it, there is no cure
We ride our way throughout the sun
We just got here, and now we're gone

In my dreams
In my hope
In my fear
In my goals
In the sky
All around
In the light
Underground

This is our time
This is our song
This is our lives
We carry on
