Restricted area
The danger zone
Top secret formula
A power load
The pressure rises
And gets too high

The wheels are rolling
At the speed of sound
The time is coming
To shake the ground

No failure at this point
The core survived
Transfer, recalibrate, and modify
Another test
Are we all set?

The wheels are rolling
You hear that sound
Something's burning
Down in the ground

Alarm lights
Blinking up
On and off
Crazy stuff
Control room
Leaking pool
Pump the fuel
What a mess
Procedures
Safety suits
Out of luck
Hurry up

We cannot stop this thing
Now it's too late
I must say from now on
No one is safe
Abandon site
Run for your life

The wheels are rolling
Explosion sounds
The time is coming
To leave this town

Can't shut down
Crews are dead
Steam blows up
At the top
A problem here
A failure there
And all the plant
Is melting down

As you see
Things can be
So quickly
Very ugly
