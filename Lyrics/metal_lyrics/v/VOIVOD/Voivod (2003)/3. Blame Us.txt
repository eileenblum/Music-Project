Science fascination
Sinful believers
Species in mutation
Sordid disorders

Our leaders missed the point
Forced to dominate and destroy
To get what people want
Cultural coded society

Secret monster machines
Evolve in our spirits
Deeper in mind, digging
To find the ultimate

Deathwatch entertainment
Predictable near-misses
Is this what people want?
One blind reflex society

On the planet, blame us,
In my time, we didn't care enough

New world lies convention
High risk policies
One speech on total power
Leading to suicide

Our leaders missed the point
Forced to dominate and destroy
It's not what people want
It's not what's called society

On the planet, blame us
In my time, we didn't care enough
In my time?
