While NASA tries to read your mind
Research labs create new life
Did we really walk on the moon?
Are you still watching the news?

Strange and ironic
How trusty is this world
Strange and ironic
How we take care of the Earth

While Middle East burns and suffers
The lobby cheers and cracks in laughter

It is a shame, we're not gonna make it
Visions are behind bars
It's like an illness or a disease
It's like we're made for war

Strange and ironic
How we believe in God
Strange and ironic
Since everything's a fraud

While markets trade human parts
We ask ourselves if science is art

It is a shame, we're not gonna make it
Because it is out of our hands
It is out of reach, out of proportions
And soon will come to an end
All I wanted was to disappear

Do or die!

It is a shame, we're not gonna make it
Everything you know is wrong
A race for knowledge, a quest for power
So who is number one?
All I wanted was to disappear
