We are here waiting
A few know this place
With our lens we're looking
Scrutinize the space

Flying cigars
A given name for UFOs
Flying cigars
Fire this one and watch the show

In the sky dancing
They are telling a story
Back and forward moving
An awesome scenery

Flying cigars
The coolest name for UFOs
Flying cigars
Up in the sky, anything goes

Makes me high!
Turns me on!

There are some making loops
There are some spinning 'round
There are some caught in flames
And some land on the ground

Flying cigars

Give me a ride to Mars on these flying cigars
