Diamonds in the grass
Ultra-violet rays
Frosted like the flowers
Insect comes alive

Rise! From the ground up to the grey blue sky
Yeah! Shine! Like a million pixels bursting in my eyes

Good old radiation
Passing through my skin
Stardust medication
I'm so energized

Rise! Bring up all colors in the photosphere
Yeah! Shine! Like atomic bombs blowing constantly
Yeah! Ride! Make it all the way throughout this day
Yeah! Die! Like every other star, one day you'll fade away

Cosmic coincidence

Working on the night shift
One look to the moon
Can't wait for tomorrow
Missing all your light

Rise! Give me just one chance to get out of here alive!
On the dirty windows of this factory
Yeah! Shine! Make the daily darkness go away
Yeah! Die! But not before I've lived, but not before I fade
