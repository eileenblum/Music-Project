You don't decide
What's wrong, what's right
You can't define what's good, what's not
You have to hide all your feelings
Having opinions can be your worst enemy

You will respond without asking
You will perform like all of them
You will behave as predicted
Being a rebel, and it's the purgatory

What about your ego
How did it end up so low
You have been robotized

It's what you eat, it's what you wear
Look around you, it's everywhere
In every action, in every move
A vague impression, having the right to choose

What about your ego
How did it end up so low
Like a seed, it will grow
In your head, it will glow
You have been robotized

You wear the freedom while a child is working
You taste a kingdom while the trees are falling
Loud voice and clear messages
The demons are so creative

There is a little matrix in everyone
