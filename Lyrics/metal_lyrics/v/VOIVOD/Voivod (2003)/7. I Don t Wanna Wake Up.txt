The sun is going down
People came from everywhere
Gathering in this small universe
It is good to see you all

How do you do?

Still in this train
Here we remain
Like yesterday
We feel the same

You know, we never really had it easy
Sometimes, life is too complicated
For now, we just want to forget it
We're here in front of you
And that's what we do

Seems like the past
Will forever last
And time goes too fast

You know, we live in a hurricane
Sometimes, it's hard to stay unaffected
For now, we want to enjoy ourselves
And hear the sound of you
Yeah, that's what we do

Don't you realize
We're under, hypnotized
There is no better sight
When we look in your eyes

You know, it is good to see each other
Sometimes, we are so disconnected
Right now, between hell and heaven
We're flying above you
Yeah, that's what we do

I don't wanna wake up
