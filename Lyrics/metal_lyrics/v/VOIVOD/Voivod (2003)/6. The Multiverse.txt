An eternal mystery
Has been discovered
It is now reality
Never say never
I've been working hard
Down in my basement
I don't know where I am
Where I've been sent

Now if I get it right
I'm trapped in the other side

Esoteric questions
Have been answered
What really matters
Is the anti-matter

Now am I lost in time?
Or caught in the other side
In parts or whole
I'm in this hole
Will I spend my life?
Locked in the other side

The Multiverse

I've moved the time from space
Based on action
I've made only one mistake
I tried it on

If I get it right
I'm trapped in this other side
In parts or whole
I'm all alone
Am I lost in time?
Or caught in this other side
It's in my head
I might be dead
Am I losing my mind?
Locked in this other side
I am losing my mind
Forever, this other side

The Multiverse
