Like the suffering of Christ
Like the screaming of his time
I am the misery
Born with open eyes

Like running blood
Like running slaves
Like warriors impaled on stakes
They scream alive
With closing eyes

I've lived through time
The end of life
True genocide
With ageless eyes
I've lived through time
Born again
I live
When God is dead

Like the burning of the mind
Like the preacher burning lives
I am conversion
Be like me
Or pay the price

Like Hitler's crimes
The plagues survive
Through centuries on lives, I've dined
They scream alive
Born with open eyes

I've lived through time
The end of life
True genocide
With ageless eyes
I've lived through time
Born again
I live
When God is dead

I'm the guns in the children's hands
And I'm the needles for the damned
I am the execution
And I'm in demand

Ther terrorist
The welfare rips
The confrontation still exists
You'll scream alive
Death through death's eyes

I've lived through time
With the end of life true genocide
With egeless eyes
I've lived through time
Born again I live
When God is dead
