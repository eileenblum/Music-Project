Green envious filled with discontent
You desire what others possess
You're ill willed and you're filled with spite
Your deep resentment will tear you apart inside

Grey pain, black heart is cracked
Desolate and you're back now
Submission your downward course
Depression devours, to you knees you are forced

This colour of life
This season of pain
This is what you let it be
This colour of life
This season of pain
This is what you never ever could be

Red with anger and burning hate
Your blood it boils up, seeds of pain
Thoughts that rage for crushing will
Seething temper intending to spill

This colour of life
This season of pain
This is what you let it be
This colour of life
This season of pain
This is what you never ever could be
