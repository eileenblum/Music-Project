I'm what you better address
I come directly from you
I'm in the air
Exist in the sea
And I am poisoning your food

Your burning lungs are from me
Your nerves I strike with disease
Reactions soon they will fade
Internal organs rot
And toxins still you release

Give birth to death
Atrocity
Atrocity
Atrocity
Atrocity

I'm infiltrating your youth
Genetics I'll decimate
This infection I bred
Created by you
My life it seals your fate

Now from mindless neglect
Ignorant years gone by
Catastrophe has begun
And if there is no end
Total world genocide

Give birth to death
Atrocity
Atrocity
Atrocity
Atrocity

And we sit here, as it continues
As we sit here, it continues

As we continue the rape
Our own destructive misuse
Few laws to protect
The coming child
From out own noxious abuse

Does death appeal to you
Do you prefer life in pain
Do you like what you see
Do you cover your eyes
Or have you nothing to gain

Give birth to death
Atrocity
Atrocity
Atrocity
Atrocity
