I'm trapped in this cage while others hold me down
Direct my pen as their fist comes down
They meddle and interfere in my affair
With the written word and God how could you dare,
But you did so.

Killing my words
I misunderstood the word free
Killing my words
Does it even apply to me?

If the mixing of my words makes you scared
They're just that, words, you could not bear
If it's that horrible, hide it and now one will know
It is the coward's way that lets this terror go
And it goes on.

Killing my words
I misunderstood the word free
Killing my words
Does it even apply to me?

And I am one
As they are many
And they cut me down

As I bleed
From my mind
You will hear no sound

I refuse
And they insist
And we battle on
In the end
Who will stand
I believe I will carry on

When I put my pen to the sheet
I describe the things that you cannot see
You have audacity that is beyond compare
Are you restricting my thoughts
And this I cannot bear
And it ends now!

Killing my words
I misunderstood the word free
Killing my words
Does it even apply to me?
