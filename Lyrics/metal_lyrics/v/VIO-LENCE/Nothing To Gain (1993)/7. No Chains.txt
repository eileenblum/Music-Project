Inside I know I'll succeed
I have faith from which I feed
Dreams you see, they're never too far
Don't have others let you think that they are

From what they say and what they suggest
You are one and they would know best
But they are fools that drag their heels along
With no ambition to them, you would belong

If you make the move
And you see it through
No chains can hold
No chains can hold you down

They would chain and drag you around
Pick you up and throw you down
They needle nothing right into your brain
Until they see you break down screaming
The trap of life where victims are caught
All dreams erased and thoughts they rot
An empty cavern just working to feed
On hearts and minds that never succeed

If you make the move
And you see it through
No chains can hold
No chains can hold you down

And you'll work so hard
To break from the pack
And they try so hard to stab at your back
Don't let them deny what you must achieve
You fight
For your sanity

I would work to harvest success
My thoughts a dream that will never rest
And though some badger and rip at my soul

My power positive will bury them whole
So stand aside or roll with the flow
It's time to reach and take full control
Or you could be another welfare case

And you'll make the move
And you'll see it through
No chains can hold
No chains can hold you down
