Division of mind and body
My eyes have never seen this clear
The truth comes cutting through me
Like a knife with pain of so many years

Fear of my reality
It keeps crashing down on me
Relief of my affliction, it comes
Only in my, only in my dreams

Only in my dreams
I hear no violent screams
Psychotic memories
That have no grip on me
Only in my dreams
I hear no violent screams
Mind beyond control
The severing from my soul

Anger breeds within me
The toll of a thousand violent screams
These constant confrontations keep tearing me
Like a fucking disease

Fear of my reality
It keeps crashing down on me
Relief of my affliction, it comes
Only in my, only in my dreams

Only in my dreams
I hear no violent screams
Psychotic memories
That have no grip on me
Only in my dreams
I hear no violent screams
Mind beyond control
The severing from my soul

These eyes of emptiness
Only in my dreams

Only in my dreams
I hear no violent screams
Psychotic memories
That have no grip on me
Only in my dreams
I hear no violent screams
Mind beyond control
The severing from my soul
