Pimp selling whores
Young runners selling crack
Bars on your doors
Shotgun shoved in your back

Thick is the shit
The walking wasted of life
Nothing legit
The screams come from out of sight

What I see makes me feel
Twisted from inside
Get a gun
Kill the scum
Justify what is right

12 gauge justice
Right or wrong
This city's gone to hell
12 gauge justice
Right or wrong,
This city's gone to hell

Cops don't exist
In this unsterile world
Drug filled abyss
Young Minds killed from it

Wild like dogs
Needles hang from their arms
Desperate their eyes
Leading transparent lives

What I see makes me feel
Twisted from inside
Get a gun
Kill the scum
Justify what is right

12 gauge justice
Right or wrong
This city's gone to hell
12 gauge justice
Right or wrong,
This city's gone to hell

Inside I'm loathing
Face down in this hell
My thoughts so scattered
I hold their cold end
My actions race by
My mind fades from reality
No conscience holds me now
I cock and I kill

No holding back
Anger turns into rage
Pick of the piece
Aim it and let it spray
Body counts rise
Scourge dropping at my feet
Unvictimized
My task is complete

12 gauge justice
Right or wrong
This city's gone to hell
12 gauge justice
Right or wrong,
This city's gone to hell

12 gauge justice
Right or wrong
This city's gone to hell
12 gauge justice
Right or wrong,
This city's gone to hell

12 gauge justice
Right or wrong, this
12 gauge justice

12 gauge justice
Right or wrong, this
12 gauge justice
