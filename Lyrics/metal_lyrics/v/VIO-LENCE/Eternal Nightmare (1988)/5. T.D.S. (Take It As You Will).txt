The needing of needles, prick my skin
Cold blood is boiling, start the binge 

Aggressive injection, the track marks run
Intended supression, finale has begun 

COLD DEATH - awaits me now
INFECT - dissect my brain devoured 

I'm needing another shot to please
My poison my life-line, it drops me to my knees 

INJECT
ADDICTION
Straight to my jugular vein 

TO WITHDRAWAL
I CAN'T TAKE
I NEED MORE
Please shoot me up, numb the pain 

No dimebags
No quaters
I'll take the gram 

The heroin
Quick fix
A mainline slam 

Speed ball
It's rolling
Turns all the time 

Injesting
Infesting
It infiltrates my mind 

QUICK PULSE
My heart can't take 

POUNDING
Surrounding all my veins 

I'm nauseous
And playing the basket case 

Die slowly
Die painful
On my strung-out face 

TO INJECT
ADDICTION
INFECTION 

Straight to my jugular vein 

TO WITHDRAWAL
I CAN'T TAKE
I NEED MORE 

Please shoot me up, numb the pain 

Hello world, I'm your residential drug pusher
You kids, they buy from me
Base of coke, a slam of seed
They know I've got the cure 

Just a punk, I'm untouchable by the law
Court room catastrophe
A simple slap upon my wrist
And then they set me free 

Body cold I pound away on his chest in fear
Empty lungs, a cardiac arrest is evidently clear
No one told me that these drugs I take would kill
They just front away and then send you the bill 

Cold displeasured face
Look of pain, look of waste
I'e seen the damages done
Too many times I've witnessed, I've witnessed it run 

Run through your veins alive
Feeding on your mind
Controlling you from inside 

No longer with us now
Pusher's voice it calls you, cower now 

Come with me child, child of fate
A shot to numb your feelings 

Embrace this death, a quick passage
Your pulse hits the ceiling 

No need for ties, no ties to life
The life you've left to linger 

It was your choice
So hold your voice
And don't point your finger
