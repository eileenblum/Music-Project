Up for the dead
Blood-thirsty rulers are bred
Rising up their dreams of hell
Are waiting for you
Their words will cut you in two 

KILLING - HE JUST KEEPS KILLING 

"Save us," they're screaming
As death's hand is weaving
Stitching, quickly killing all
For reasons unknown
They quickly slice to the bone 

BLEEDING - THEY JUST KEEP BLEEDING 

This power stripe upon my arm
Is what my world is running on
So hide your head or join the dead
A place you all will soon be led 

Come with me child, I'll do you no harm
As I violently am clenching her arm 

There is no stopping
The bodies are rotting
Piling up the graves a mass
Are waiting to spew - they're being dug out for you 

DYING - THEY JUST KEEP DYING 

Their cynical laughter
Is what we are after
Coming from the mouth of hell
Is turning to dust
Their cities crumble in rust 

BODIES - THEY'RE JUST DEAD BODIES 

This power stripe upon my arm
Is what my world is running on
So hide your head or join the dead
A place you all will soon be led 

Come with me child, I'll do you no harm
As I violently am clenching her arm 

Gasoline injection into the vein
Starvation, millions of dead are on their way
We could really care less for your lives
We'll gas you, shoot you, stab you with a knife
And if you think you're going to escape
We'll cut you down, like weeds at the gate
Laughing at you loudly as you die
Your wounds bleed profusely, say goodbye
Goodbye! 

They dictate and you live your lives 

BODIES ON BODIES 

A stagnant state, a stench of hell 

BODIES ON BODIES 

A place of death - for you! 

These dying people
Screaming for their lives
Sadistic killers
Ignoring all their cries 

Ruling party
You will see their death
Millions of souls
You have taken their breath 

Science projects, should we kill the rest?
Tell us quickly, which way's the best? 

In the end you will be no more
Your nation crumbling, slam the door 

BODIES ON BODIES ON BODIES ON BODIES 

Massive graves retain their stench 

BODIES ON BODIES ON BODIES ON BODIES 

Lifeless skeletons wear their flesh 

[repeat]

They dictate and you live your lives 

BODIES ON BODIES 

Never leaving until you die 

BODIES ON BODIES 

A stagnant state, a stench of hell 

BODIES ON BODIES 

A place of death - for you!
