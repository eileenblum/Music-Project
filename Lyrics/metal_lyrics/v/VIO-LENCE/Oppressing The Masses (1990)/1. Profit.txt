[Music: Flynn,Demmel]
[Lyrics: Killian]

[ Solo: Flynn ]
Feeling Taken, God Do I Hate.
Pinstripped, Blacktied, Corporate Minds
That Hate.
All That They See Fit To Be Theirs.
Giving Nothing Except Only To Their Heirs.
Desease Kills Constantly Unseen.
The Rich Pad Their Pockets, And Fulfill Their
Money Schemes.
Human Waste, Sucking Off The Cement
They Beg, You See Nothing, You're Too
Innocent.
All That You Hold
If You Owe, They Have Sold.
Interest Indeed
What I See Is Greed
I Profit Off
All That You've Got.
Give It To Me.
Others Worse, They'll Fuck You With Greed.
Friendly Investment, On Their Minds
Embezzling.
Foolish Suckers, You're Born Every Day.
Use Them, Confuse Them, And Then They Are
Kicked Away.
Rip You Off For All That You're Worth.
A Quick Scheme Your Dreams Are Face Down In
The Dirt.
Bleeding Hearts, They've Got No Conscience
For You.
You Luck, Shit Luck, You're Fucked,
You're Through.
All That You Hold
If You Owe, They Have Sold.
Interest Indeed
What I See Is Greed
I Profit Off
All That You've Got.
Give It To Me.
[ Solo: Demmel ]
I Know I'm Not Against A Quick Buck.
Profit Margin, I'd Like To Have One Myself,
But Then, Some Scum, Money Is All That
They Want.
Immaculate Dreamland, For Their Needs They
Will Rip You Off
Give Me Cash, Give Me All That You've Got
Fill My Pockets, Hand It Over, Do Not Conserve.
Rich Making Poor Is All I Want To Be.
I Profit, Embezzle, Cold Cash For Me.
All That You Hold
If You Owe, They Have Sold.
Interest Indeed
What I See Is Greed.
I Profit Off
All That You've Got.
Give It To Me.
Sifting My Hands, Through The Color, The Money,
The Green I Must See, Only This Is No Dream.
I'm No Longer The Scum On The Street Not The Bum
That You Scrape Off Your Shoes As You Turn.
