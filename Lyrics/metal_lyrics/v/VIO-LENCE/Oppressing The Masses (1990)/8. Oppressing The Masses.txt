[Lyrics: Killian]
[Music: Demmel, Flynn]

Land Of Old, This Soil I Now See Turns Grey.
Looking On, I See Crowds That Stand Against
Tyrant Guns,
Blow Them Away.
All For The Sake Of Freedom,
Look To Your Screen They're Screaming, Help.
High Upon A Pedestal, Man's Mind Speaking
Aloud.
What I See, Is What I Hold; Rower And All
That's Around.
Curfew At Dusk, And My Soldiers Litter
The Streets.
This Is For The People, No, We're Breaking,
Taking, Killing.
We Bleed From Tyrants War, Runs Red Through
Streets Of Blood.
The Freedom That We Would Seek Is Screaming
Lost Liberty.
Oppressing The Masses, Could This Be.
Oppressing The Masses, Could This Happen To Me.
Deceiving Things He Says You Might Take
As True.
One Word Believed By Him, His Strings Attach To You.
So We The People Must Unite, And Defy.
Destroy The Power, Fight This Man's Rule
Must Die,
By Our Hand.
Oppressed People Of This Land.
Convert, Exist The Planned Way.
Revolt, With Blood We'll Flow The End.
Oppressing The Masses, Could This Be.
Oppressing The Masses, Could This Happen To Me.
Gone Year's Of Ten
I'm Still Power Alive.
My Dominos Fall On Taking Other Men's Pride.
All For The Need Of Power
Watch As I Devour You!
This Virus Of My Intentions, Infectious.
Your Land My Carnage Forth.
Obviously Death Results.
I Am The Ugly Face, The Spreading Disease
I Am Oppressing, Raping Life, I Do As I Please
And You Pay The Price.
You're Lost Without Arms To Fight
If Given The Spine From Hate
Would You Cower, Or Rise And Say.
Oppressing The Masses, No Not To Me.
Oppressing The Masses, No This Could Never Be.
Oppressing The Masses, To Be Free I Would Rise.
Oppressing The Masses, For To Live Contained,
This
Mind Would Die!!
