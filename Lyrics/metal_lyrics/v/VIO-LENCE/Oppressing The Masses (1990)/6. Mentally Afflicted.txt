[Music: Flynn, Demmel, Killian]
[Lyrics: Killian]

Enter I, Disturbing Peace Of Mind
Pressure Reflects Me.
Manipulate, And Break The Feeling Of Faith.
Weak Fools Obsess Me.
Glare Inside, Shines My Mind
It's Quite Distorted, It's So Cruel.
Afflicted Traits, Extending Outward My Hate
Sharp Words Detest You.
I Am The Thorn In The Side.
Pressure That's Never Denied.
Call Me - Call Me - Call Me Mad.
My Look Is Often A Grin
Cold As It's Sin.
Call Me - Call Me - Call Me Mad.
We Evil Kind, We Evil Subject Your Pride
Intent Oppression.
An Open Sore, Into It Salt We Will Pour
Verbal Aggression!
Conscience Collapsed, Feelings For You Waxed
But My Mental Affliction.
I Carry Pride, I Hold It High At My Side
Cause Your Submission.
I Am The Thorn In The Side.
Pressure That Never Denied.
Call Me - Call Me - Call Me Mad.
My Look Is Often A Grin.
Cold As It's Sin
Call Me - Call Me - Call Me Mad.
[ Solo: Demmel ]
At Times I'd Love To Feel The Break Of Your Spine.
Your Pain, My Hand, My God, That Would Do Me
Just Fine.
But Intelligence Tells Me Constrain, Don't
Do That.
Use Your Wit, Make 'Em Pay, Verbal Attack.
Your Cowardice, Your Whimpering Makes
Me Sick.
In Your Face, Your Ugliness, On It I Could Spit.
Divine Reprisal, I'm Getting Under Your Skin.
Contemptuous Me, I Will Always Win.
Cold Hate.
Feel The Pain To Which I Relate, My
Harsh Hell.
Satisfies, Sanctifies Me As Well.
