[Music: Demmel, Flynn, Killian]
[Lyrics: Killian]

I Reach Out, And Grab The Devil.
Pour His Hell Straight Down My Throat.
Go Home To The Darling
Where's Your Pain, Give Me Pain Ten Fold.
Soft Face On My Backhand.
Soft Heart Broken At My Feet.
Careless Of Your Feelings.
Reach Again, Strike Again, Feel It.
All This And More For You.
These Are The Things That I Put You Through.
Bleed For Me Once, And Again.
It's Not What You're Doing.
Liquid Soul, Inside Of Me
My Conscience Black, Plaqued By Disease.
Losing Mind, I'm Slipping Fast
The Bottle Empties Courage In Me From A Glass.
Next Day My Eyes Have Opened
Look To See My Battered Wife
Living This Depression
Poor Again, Drink Again, Slam It
Savior In A Bottle
Courage Capped And Sealed Tight
Helps Me To See Brighter
Things I Hate Washed Away Leave Me
All This And More For You
These Are The Things That I Put You Through
