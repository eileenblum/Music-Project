[Lyrics: Killian]
[Music: Demmel, Flynn, Killian]

On The Case Of An Unusual Death Tonight.
Corpse Erupt, Sweet Smell Of Cremation
In Flight.
My Eyes Attracted To A Pile Of Ash
In All My Time I Have Never Seen That.
Distinguishable By A Single Leg Intact.
Body Of Flesh Bones All Turned To Ash.
Fire Of No One's Guess Entraps.
I'm Wondering About The Feelings That
You've Felt.
Was It Pain Delivered Straight From Hell ?
Did You Grasp Out, Did You Reach For The Sky ?
Or Did You Collapse, Only Time To Die ?
Burning Story Too Difficult To Tell.
Body Of Flesh, Bones All Turned To Ash.
Fire Of No One's Guess Entraps.
Engulfed, Your Swallowed By The Flames
Temperature Burns Away.
No Crawling, No Feeling The Pain.
[ Solo: Flynn ]
[ Solo: Demmel ]
Engulfed, Your Swallowed By The Flames
Temperature Burns Away.
No Crawling, No Feeling The Pain.
Cases Number, But No Way To Explain
How A Human Just Burst Right Out Into Flames.
The Fire Engulfs Your Body, Attacked
You Hit The Floor, An Oily Of Ash.
And What Is You Can Now Be Swept Away.
Engulfed, Your Swallowed By The Flames
Temperature Burns Away.
No Crawling, No Feeling The Pain.
Engulfed, Your Swallowed By The Flames
Temperature Burns Away.
No Crawling, No Feeling The Pain.
