[Lyrics: Killian]
[Music: Demmel, Flynn]

I'm The Law, I Wield The Stick
So Back Your Ass Up In Fear
This Is My Place, My Burning Face In Full Gear.
We Move In Groups, Head Stomping Boots
And Canisters For Tears.
Move In At Once, Through Hate We Make
Ourselves Clear.
I Am The Cop That Rips You Off
I Steal Drugs For Cash.
No Junkies Run, For Into They Get A Blast.
Big Dealers Pay, I Turn Away
Another Week Of Bought Trust.
But I'll Be Back For More Cash Or A Bust.
[Chorus]
Their Laws Decide - Criminals, Lawbreakers
Who Is Right - Officer Nice
Hit With Sticks - Criminals, Lawbreakers
Move Them Quick - Officer Nice.
[ Solo: Demmel ] 
[ Solo: Flynn ]
Interrogate, Feelings Of Hate For You
Run Thick Through My Mind
The Bleeding Dead, Family Of Ave Left Behind
Murdering Dirt, You In My World
And Here I Dictate The Law.
And As I Swing, Your Scattered Brains Paint
The Wall
