I hardly recognize the face that's in front of me, you've let this be your plague.
It works its way under your skin, the parallel life takes over.
Made you its slave.
I read the tales told by lifeless eyes.
Look deep through your disguise.
We sign our souls away.
Bodies transform into ghosts of our new lives.
As we dissolve into this regime, how clear it stains these walls.
Let blood return to these cold hearts withering away.
As time caves in, pulses beat through the death of our hope.
Let blood return to these cold hearts withering away.
Bodies transform into ghosts of our new lives.
I read the tales told by lifeless eyes.
Look deep through your disguise.

Before we know, were casting eyes over rough seas of storms.
Over barren lands, distant fields that can never be roamed. [x2]

With hands held out, we've lost the touch we crave.
Dreaming of the warmth of skin, rebuild integrity. (repeat to fade)
