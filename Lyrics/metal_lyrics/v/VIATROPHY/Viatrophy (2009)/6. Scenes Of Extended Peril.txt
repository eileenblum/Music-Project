The blind lead the blind, abuse your position.
The blood on your hands leaves stains behind.
Take their hands, watch them perish, skin and bones, let yourself decay.
Your cobbled track turns into a minefield, they'll glorify your faults, archive your every move.
Glamourize your demise, spreading this disease.
A useless path you chose set your plague across the land.
How I'd love to dethrone you and erase that smile across your face.
Create a smoky pathway between your eyes, your spawn, a wretched child, deny your right to life.
Your footprints lasting, deny your right to life.
Turn your back on your creator as you punish this world.
I hope you choke on guilt, crippled by the weight.
This pain will be avenged.
You'll all fade away into the blackest night.
No longer will you sow your seed upon this land, look through your blood-red haze and you'll see me.
