A cold poison runs through your veins, bathe yourself in your self-made sea of sin.
Dig your nails in, pull her tight, a coward's ride.
Draw her in to the comfort of a lie.
A vulgar sight makes us distance ourselves from you, a gleam in your eye all so proud.
This is your secret, a hidden life.
Expired twenty years ago, pushing it far too far.
This is your only dream, eclipsing your existence to me.
The vow you made, cast aside, does not matter anymore.
Abandoned in pain.
Where your beliefs lie; lost dignity.
Clutching at the glimpse of hope, absent from her eyes.
An awkward silence this is the seed you chose to sow.
Your self portrait painted with your lies.
Distant memories of loyal times once served.
Legions infest these grounds, searching for their prey.
I won't be the one, you'll destroy yourselves.
Through scattered ashes, visions of your throne in your eye.
Your crown will be reclaimed, dreams will be denied,
This is your only dream, eclipsing your existence to me.
