A life lived in fear of final judgement, end of days
Grasping on to futile prayers
This paranoia hanging over you
It weeps from every pore
You'll feel it in your every move
Your every step watched over, unreachable freedom
Your saviour yet to show his face
Should he decide my fate?
Conquering the world, a mission so vein
The crisp air pounds my skin
My eyes and senses open in defiance
You're sedated by false promises offering hope
This misery created by your belief
The darkness of this world mists his perfect bliss,
Pray for me.
Lead the beast to rest, repent his sins
Carry your filth to the heavens, while I cleanse in hell
Conscience my only guidance, my only saviour
Does it take a holy man to rest?
Conscience my only guidance, my only saviour
A thousand souls erased in your name
Lead the beast to rest, repent his sins
Carry your filth to the heavens, while I cleanse in hell
