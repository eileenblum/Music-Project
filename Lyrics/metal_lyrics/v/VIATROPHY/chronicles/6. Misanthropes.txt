Grace these tired thoughts,
I'm never giving in.
Don't care what you have to
Offer this time,
I'm never giving in.

Force fed this tired game
I should not play them again
Although I feel compelled
I'll not give in to your fucking hell

This is a statement only you can recognise
See sense and logic through the wet film in your eyes

I will try to hold onto this moment

I know that this is nowhere near where we started
