Like an arrow through his chest
Spinning blade inside his soul
Claws sunken into his skin

The message of this society;
Disregard, selfishness, misery
Bright minds of our youth become this blinded mass
So he seeks escape from reality

Gasping for love
Smothered by hatred

Like an arrow through his chest
Spinning blade inside his soul
Claws sunken into his skin

Like an arrow
A fucking arrow through the chest

From joys of life we don't have to abstain
But rather open our eyes to see each other's pain
How does one in a crowded hall feel like a leafless tree in the fall?
We have to fight for what we stand for united, humble and free
Pray for the hopeless, gather the lost, 'cause to care selflessly is what makes us real
