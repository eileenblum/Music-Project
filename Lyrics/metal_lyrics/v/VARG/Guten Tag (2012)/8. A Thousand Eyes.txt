[feat. Jonne/Korpiklaani]Forest of the wolves
Where the trees have a thousand eyes
Take a primordial breath
Let the ancient spirits rise

Old mother earth
What have they done
Strangers of nature
Their pride is gone

The virus lurkes in the night
Black waters in our seas
Colors turn to grey
The last stand of the elder trees

We will resist
Revolt

Forest of the wolves
Where the trees have a thousand eyes
Take a primordial breath
Let the ancient spirits rise

Forest of the wolves
Where the trees have a thousand eyes
This is the resistance
We will arise

Revolt
Revolt
Revolt
Revolt

The virus lurkes in the night
Black waters in our seas
Colors turn to grey
The last stand of the elder trees

This is the time to fight
The last stand of the oldest trees
We are the final resistance
Revolution in our eyes

Revolt
Unite
Revolt
Arise

Revolt
Arise
Revolt
Arise

Our day will come
With the sun on our side
We will revolt
We will arise

Forest of the wolves
Where the trees have a thousand eyes
Take a primordial breath
Let the ancient spirits rise

Forest of the wolves
Where the trees have a thousand eyes
Take a primordial breath
Let the ancient spirits rise

Forest of the wolves
Where the trees have a thousand eyes
This is the resistance
We will arise
