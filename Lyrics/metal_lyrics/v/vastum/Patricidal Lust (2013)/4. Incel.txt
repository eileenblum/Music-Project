Deprivations of the flesh
A quarantine in abject absence
Euphoria denied: dripping, unsated phantom limb
Suffocated stifled mass can feel the temperature rise
By knowledge unrealized: a tumorous, parasitic grief
Animus erectus
Tension stretching - stretching skin
Disparity of brain and loin
The affliction: a disease of solitude
Limerent objects intrude a stunted psyche
An insane punishment
Amygdalic uprising
Spewing into fathomless deserted depths

Pent up pain
A burning traps secretions inside
Involuntary celibacy
Deprivation by way of obsession
Stiffening with no release
Endless torment with no release 

Eruptions silent, miserable, invisible
Mere echoes of delight
A distant mockery of joy
Unconsummated acts
Consume body and mind
A prison of what could but will never be
Hopeless
Ugly
Destructive
Self
