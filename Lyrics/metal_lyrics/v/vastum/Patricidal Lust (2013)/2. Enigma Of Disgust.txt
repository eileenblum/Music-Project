Enigmatic signs giving life
To the darkest burdens of mind
From the touch of silence is bred
The enigma of eternal disgust

Mothering unconscious
transmission
Of the father's shame
and obsession

Life giving wound

Open, unsated,
Fatal, voracious

Cannot wash the stain of abjection
Turning to Gods for protection
From the desire we've been taught not to trust
By the enigma of eternal disgust

You can't hear the lies of convention
Phallic
dictation
of perception

Life giving wound

Open, unsated,
Fatal, voracious

Ego is born
by being fucked
By the enigma
of eternal disgust

Inherit the shame
Disrobe in disgust
Mask the odors of your lust,
Polymorphous and unlearned

Internalized horror of what lies below the belt

You can't hear the lies of convention
Phallus always dictating perception
Of the desire we've been taught not to trust
By the enigma of eternal disgust
