The dream spills inside
Forcing its way in me
Horrified of what took place
Of what just transpired
A cloud of vague shame lurks
A trace in the corners
Fades into obscurity upon awakening

Impassive figure towers about me
Changing faces rapidly
Upside down, my head is tilted
Expressionless, I surrender 
Light shoves the filth back into the corners of my mind
Feigned, perverted normalcy
Blind spots get me through the day 
Until midnight approaches once again

Violated, a sickening pleasure
Disgusted by the fantasy
Mind conquered by lawless desire
Sublimated by lack of memory
Blackness turns to grey upon consciousness
Shadows shrink as daylight hits my retina
Forgetful, I awake

Towering figure reappears
Larger than the night before
Millisecond glimpse of that everchanging face
I freeze in repulsion, the revelry
Nausea mingled with excitement
I take him in completely
