I awake - 3 AM, debilitated
Jolt of pain - perpetual, waking nightmare
Ruthless - yellow, crimson razor streams
Cry, bleed - drops of fire flush away below me 

Alone in my infection
The price of affection
Cycle of echoing pain
Brings endless sleepless torture
Unpredictable microscopic
Invisible attacker

The object of my affection
The source of my agony
Sound asleep beside me
Unaware that his friction creates
The sensation of a thousand interstitial blades down my center

I awake - 3 AM, debilitated
Piercing pain - pounding, throbbing, waking nightmare
Dysuria - yellow, crimson razor streams
Burn, bleed - drops of fire slice me where I came
