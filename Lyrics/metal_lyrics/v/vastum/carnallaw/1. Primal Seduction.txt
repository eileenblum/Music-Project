Exiled from animality
To obey natural law
The human erected
Still yearning to crawlâ¦

Fall into the light
Grief, animalistic
Cry for return to the night
Anal-sadistic

This is our return
To a lost intimacy
Post-patricidal
Pleasures of animalityâ¦

Feed on the orifice of Night
Rectal communion
Crawl away from the Light
In terror of fusion

This is our religion
The obsession of return
To an extemporaneous Darkâ¦
