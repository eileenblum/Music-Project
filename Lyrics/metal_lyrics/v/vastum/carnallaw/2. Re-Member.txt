I remember
When Iâd rather not
Ashamed, dismembered
Here I rot...

Awake
To a bloody mess
Remembering the pieces
Where they were left

Left the penis with my Father
A womb with my mom
Heart with my Mother
Exogamous lawsâ¦
Brokenâ¦

Iâd rather not remember
But Iâm still alive
Ashamed, dismembered
Into my mind I diveâ¦
