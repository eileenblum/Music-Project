Lifeless growth
Pushes through
Chasms rift
Until it finds
The rot unto which
This life was builtâ¦
Dead ends
Fragments
Mere hints of life
Prescient aging
Relinquished prostrations

Unconscious creations
Of vitality, of life

Crawling
Devolution, bare life
Ancient discovery
Putrescent mines

Cycles reversed
Infant womb
Pregnant with death
A weak attempt to thrive

Feeding
On imprecated psychic depths
Effaced, discovered, desultory
Rotten egoic edifice

Imprecated psychic depths
