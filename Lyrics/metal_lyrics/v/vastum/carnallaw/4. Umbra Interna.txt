Blind deaf kings erect
Spewing lies and sperm
Cold and narrow surge flows pale
Trapping thoughts in dried up stainsâ¦

âNow Iâm awake
Hear screams, feel the dread
Of another day
Disarming the fear
In my headâ

In my headâ¦
Umbra Interna

âFrom the Law of the Father
The Dark promises release
Dualistic scars reopened
Into Light they bleed
They bleedâ

In my headâ¦
Umbra Interna

âAgony
Umbra Interna
The Dark is all I need
Into the Light
My Ego will diveâ

Cloaked and choked
Extinguished flame
Autocratic reign
Fills the mind with silent fear
Ingrained agony

âNow Iâm awake
Into Night, loss of head
Transverberating
Obfuscation of mind
Obeisant dreadâ

Into my headâ¦
Umbra interna
