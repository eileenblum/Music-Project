Enclosed Spirit
Broad visionâ¦
Extinguished

Filtered through
Narrow, hollow
corridors of minds
Force fed placement

Fragments of the self
Unrecognizable, scattered and strewn
In cruel abandonâ¦

Toxicity spreads
Into the nerves
Preventing clarityâ¦

The poison of others
Under the surface
unspoken threat
Makes the air thick
With violenceâ¦

No peace of mind
Or respite
Until its grip is released
Vague anxiety
The oldest of its kind

Thought entities attack
On levels unseenâ¦

Contagious and without reason
Smothered by silence
Spirit abusedâ¦
