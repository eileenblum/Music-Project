[performed by Varathron]Escaped to the hills
the only place where
I feel safe and strong
under the wings of burning sky!!!

The Chariot of fire
I pray to him
on a full moon night!

Far from hypocrisy
pain and cruelty
far from humanity
and their monstrous normality!

The dominion of fear
despair of happiness
I will remain
faithful and indifferent!

That was the day
when I decided never
leave my hills again.
That was the day
when I took an oath
to my glorious dark lord!
And that was the day
when my damned soul began
to suffer from evil spells!

A thought flashes through 
my mind, as clearly as revelation
when they hunting 
me like an animal, for my dark beliefs!!!

During that moment
when time floated
and seemed eternal
I worship the unholy spirit
and they wanted to burn me
like a witch!!!

I'm closer here
to the black angels
who watch over
our nightmares
calm, our fears and keep
our doubts from scarring!

The chariot of fire
I pray to him
on a full moon night!
