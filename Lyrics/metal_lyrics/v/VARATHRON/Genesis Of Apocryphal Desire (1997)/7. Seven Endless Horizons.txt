[From the Genesis of Apocryphal Desire demo]

The dependence of an unholy civilization
The society of ultimate death â The coming from the past
The one who will sigh the future

Forgotten nameless graves â Inside the leper jungles
Desolation of exiled angels

There where the light is dying â An the darkness is ruling forever
Sacrifice for them in the altars of Varathron

The Graal which will give â Life to the Dark Lords
The mystificated mass â Which will sign the world

There where the light is dying â An the darkness is ruling forever
Sacrifice for them in the altars of Varathron

Seven sighs, seven scriptures â Seven gates whom will open
To break out the terrible nightmare
In the whirlwind of a painless end

Seven beasts, seven wizards â Seven endless horizons
Sacrifice myself to the demons â Black window opens in the sky
