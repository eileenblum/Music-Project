[From the Genesis of Apocryphal Desire demo]

Finally from the depths of Egypt
Nocturnal arrival of the strange one
Thy who was worshipped by the nomads
Thy who was followed by beasts

Abyssic born emerging from the sea
Forgotten lands and cold towers â Covered all over with seaweeds
The Earth scratched in two weird plains

Circle within circle, eye within eye
And when the sacred hour comes

From words they passed to obscure deeds
The final step before the apocalypse

Archegonig theory is fallen by reborn
Thy who believed once â Follow the light now
Marking the time to mystical tressbirth

That which saved him made him stronger
And he destroyed everything he had
The Melouzin's child is cast on earth
Nothing but shadows waves remain
