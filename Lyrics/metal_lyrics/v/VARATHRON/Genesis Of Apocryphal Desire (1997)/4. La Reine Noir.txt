[From the Genesis of Apocryphal Desire demo]

Shattering the serpent egg
Black shape reincarnates
Baptized in underworlds places
Domination of mystical worship

A weird shrine with malevolent colors
Manfully conquers the time
Disequilibrium of universal balance
La Reine Noir is cast to Earth â La Reine Noir

Withering in weakly sunlight
Petrified instincts awaken once again - La Reine Noir

Number the corpses in the plundered tombs
Incurable plagues in her immaterial face

A dance in funeral triumph
The daughter rides the chariot of fire

Controls the spirits of all enemies
Diffusing into the deserts of night

Withering in weakly sunlight

Number the corpses in the plundered tombs
Incurable plagues in her immaterial face
