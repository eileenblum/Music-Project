[Previously unreleased]

The golden cities once â Desperately loved to rose
From fathomless grey mass - Blue lakes and abyssic mountains

Fear, for something that will gonna be
Fear, for something that will never (gonna happen)
Mercy and mighty echoes lamentation and tearing
From a voiceless face (without ending)

The shining towers of Hy-Brasyl â Earthy and heavenly paradise
Where men walked with gods â And with beasts of the forest

Time when springtime and harvest
Were as one; flowers and fruits â Hung heavily on every bough
Like a dream beyond the dimensions
The wind was blowing like a loverâs touch
Caressing the highest towers
The mist like a sinful soul â Was searching its salvation

The time when hands moved
Only in grace and giving, the eyes smiled
The lips spoke with love without shame

Spirits travelling on a labyrinth
Without fear but passion â Bravery without bloodshed

Pictures from the past â Unspoken dreams of today
Mysterious visions for the future
Itâs time you will learn from yourself

Total time: 	43:03

VARATHRON:
Necroabyssious â vocals and whispers
Pyrphoros â electric and acoustic guitars and bass
Adrastos â synths and piano
Wolfen â drums
