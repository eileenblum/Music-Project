Looking at the eternal horizons
Where the shine disapears
Where the sea unites with the sky
Where the eye travels into the blue.

Forgotten memories from the past
Turn around in your head
You remember and travelling
To the endless seas of black earth

Remember battles and echoes
Cries, pain and blood
Beyond the galaxial cities of north
Beyond the Abysmal hate of warriors

Somewhere beyond the dark seas
Memories-locked doors of your darkest mind
Terror-eternal curse and silence
