God of darkness
Lord of death
Ruler of shadows
Hear us

Nuada you have come
To a world without pain
And without pleasure
Return now and pain not
Pleasure awaits you
Once entire, you're less
From the loss of an arm
And a powerful kingdom

Empty your heart from the want
Of this ultimate hero
The desire for his soul
Turn his face away from death
Space him for life
In thunder, flood of fire
we await you, spirit od diancecht
Emperor of forgotten souls.

In the shadows of my wings
I shelter the children of nemed
Their beauty I praise
Their grace I celebrate
Their valour I encourage
Their pride I share
We put our souls between
The lord of death and child of the sun

Glory to you ll'dana
Hero bring pride to our land
So we, children of named
May forever run free
Gaze down on Eireann
The green land you bought
With your blood and your boldness
Now glory of myth, glory of legend.

Peace be in your heaven
And peace on our earth
You; re legend, eternal
You're memory turned myth.
