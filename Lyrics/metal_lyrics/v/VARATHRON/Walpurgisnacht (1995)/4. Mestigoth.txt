Deadly pain hovering in the night
Shadows are scared around you
Embossed thought and remorses
To the wall of memories.

Like a spirit, like a shine
Beyond the eternal glaxies
(At the unknown dimensions)
Where the silence re-echo (like a scream!)
Of ultimate fear which posses you.

With awe you looking at yourself
On the waxen mirror that changes endlessly
Loosing your faith and you're crying
For the ultimate gift, they'll promised you.

Look the bloodness skies
Look the blashemous kingdom
Look the shne of victory in their burning eyes
Feel their dark delight

After many-maby centuries and aeons
You will be the one who will write
The Macabre tales on the book of stone
You will narrate to tne next generation
You will speak for their victory
You will scream for the winter
Oh! King of the kings, Emperor of chaos,
dark Lord, Master... I worship you!!!
