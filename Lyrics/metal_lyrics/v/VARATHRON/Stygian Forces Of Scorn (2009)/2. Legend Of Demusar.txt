Beyond the limits of time when the oceans swallowed
The glorious ancient cities when the grand kingdoms
Expanded all around the world at that time!!!
A merciless world, a cryptic world!
Before wish was born when man was
An abstract idea without kingdoms, with no laws
Expanded all around the world at that time!!!
A merciless world, a cryptic world!

The mask of the super natural powers
He who will look at it even once
The Demusar, dies immediately
From its powerful light!!!

The mask of death the legend of Demusar
The avenger of evil full of mortal-nails!

Its light carries you away into an infuriated swirl
Into the rotten tomb of hades flooded
With the martyrdom of insanity
In the dark sea of fear! Rage and pain!

The ancient tribes of Akeron say that in order to dry
The light of the sun you have to swim
In the dark sea of fear! Rage and pain!

There was Demusar then   which feel like a sphere of flames
From the sky on earth, good people found it
It might keep away â the bad ones!
The enigma of the centuries it seems that the power
Of Demusar has two sides! A truly very strange
Object which is used for good or bad-purpose!!
Open the gates of hades
Open the empire of evil
Worship old glorious religions
With absolute hate and apocryphal â pain!!!

The mask of the supernatural powers
He who will loot at it even once
The Demusar, dies immediately
From itâs powerful light!!!

The mask of death the legend of Demusar
The avenger of evil  full of mortal-nails!!!
