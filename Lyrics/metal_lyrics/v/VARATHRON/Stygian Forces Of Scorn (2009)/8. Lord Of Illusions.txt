(There are) two worlds of magic
One is the glittering domain
Of the illusionist.
(the) other is a secret place
Where apocryphal magic
Is a terrifying reality!

Now the time is coming I pay for all my sins
This is an unspeakable dream I try to find myself
Through the gates of a new salvation
When I can only sense the end is here!
How can we travel when our souls are lost
How can we dream when our thoughts are empty!
I try to find myself through the gates of
A new salvation when I can only sense
The end isâ¦ near!!!!

Your soul is fighting among two worlds
Power and illusion reality and sorrow!
Here men have power the power of demons
And death itself is an evil- illusion!

Lord of illusions!!! Lord of illusions!!!!
Lord of illusions!!! Lord of illusions!!!!
