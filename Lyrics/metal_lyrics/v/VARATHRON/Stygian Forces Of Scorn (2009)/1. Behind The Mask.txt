When time stops and the suns rays
Go through the gates of the kingdom of darkness
The cobwebbed aspects of your mind, then will
All the desire and hope of a damned world pour out!

Behind the mask  human behaviors
Which breeds again your inner world.
The revenge has victims guilties and innocents
So you are endlessly looking - deliverance.

The mask which abolishes human behaviors
Reborn through evil your inner world.
The revenge has victims guilties and innocents
So you are endlessly looking - deliverance.

A world that is asking to take revenge while
Trying desperately to restore the equanimity.
A world that is asking to take revenge now
To restore the equanimity of your spiritual deformity!
There where insanity becomes your character
There where the universe becomes your temple
There where insanity becomes your character
And prepares with lust for the last â sacrifice!!!
Sacrifice!!!!!!!
