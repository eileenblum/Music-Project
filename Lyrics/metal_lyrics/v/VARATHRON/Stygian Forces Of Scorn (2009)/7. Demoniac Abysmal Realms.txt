Odd planets and strange worlds
Shining beyond the gates of knowledge
Guarded from malevolent and abysmal demons!

Memories â from those who lived in times (with) no time creation.
Memories â of ages of nihilism when stars not exist!

Oneiric landscapes beyond dimensions of earth
Far from arcane societies (of galaxy)
Beyond memories of infinity there my world was born
Dark and blood colored a malicious and doomed world
Like catacombs of underworld.

An ancient unholy spirit upon the chariot of death
(primeval) scenes before my damned eyes
Engulfed within eternal night!

Where (ultima) thuleâs grand priests invoke the ancient king of doom
The future conqueror him who his breath is terror
Him who devours from the dead!
To him who seeks no light to him who screams at night
To him who pray for ages all the winged tribes of universe!

There in bottomless depths where only the shadows
Of an impious demons tribe lurk
A mystical tribe who expect the chosen!

This is my Stygian realm here I have to breath eternally,
Trapped in my own spells in my own rites!
Because some gates I should never open!
Some dark fears I should never reveal!
And some unspeakable terrors
I could never â stop!!!
I could never â stop!!!
I could never â stop!!!

Memories â from those who lived in times (with) no time creation.

Memories â of ages of nihilism

When stars not exist!
