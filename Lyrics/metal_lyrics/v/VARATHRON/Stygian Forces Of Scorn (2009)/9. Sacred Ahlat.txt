Centuries ago a malicious magician in this country of Ahlat
Conceived the plan of the extermination
Of an ancient dynasty this was reigning over this place!
Using cunning words he convinced his people
Dethroned the king, imprisoned him,
Slaughtered him and sacrificed him to the altar of the temple!

Inhabitants groaned under the tyranny!
(I have seen) rebels, worse than the tyrants
Who they had overthrown!

He was calling himself a prophet and a priest of unknown gods
They were talking only to him about the coming of one of them
So that this god would reign in the sacred Ahlat!!!
This is how he named it, the glorious â Ahlat!!!

Using infernal and unholy rituals he called in this
Field of existence a demon woman from the outside world
To serve the people as a goddess!
But the magician lost the control over the grim-looking, being
So he exterminated him in order to reign
In his place â eternally!

The being, you see, is immortal and itâs power springs
From the ability to steal the souls of the people!
So this country which once upon a time
Was green and peaceful
(now is dried up by itâs vampire thirst now)
Leaving out only Ahlat!!

He was calling him self a prophet and a priest of unknown gods
They were talking only to him about the coming of one of them
So that this god would reign in the sacred Ahlat!
This is how he named it, the glorious â Ahlat!!

The unknown gods will subside and will sent the liberator
To sow the seeds of right and peace on the ungraceful Ahlat!
It will have a name ancient and all powerful
The yells of death
Which echo acrossâ¦. Ahlat!! Ahlat!!! Ahlat!!!!
