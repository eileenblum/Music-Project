Beyond the stellar horizons where our thought
Goes beyond fantasy where ânowâ doesnât exist
More than âthenâ when time flies away
And loneliness frightens you you feel you stand alone
In this interminable world!

Where the walls weep their lost glory
Where the sky is in tears (recalling) the eternal â brightness!

You thing of dying and yet you resist,
Look at the pain around you in the abyss of your eyes!!
Everything tells you to cry for it everything tells you to die for it
The key to your immortality to your unrivalled eternity!!!

Where the walls weep their lost glory
There the sky is in tears (recalling) the eternal â brightness!

On walls without a name you are looking for
The absolute expression of fear
You are looking for the truth and the lie
Among the ruins of souls and minds
Where you resurrected where you tried once
For you last birth!

Where the walls weep their lost glory
Where the sky is in tears (recalling) the eternal â brightness!

Look at the sorrow around you the looks, the screams, the cries,
The cries of a silence listening to the greatest grief.
What I know is everything that goes around
My distant mind memories of battles
Pain and whispers!
War- pain- feed â the black- river!!!!
