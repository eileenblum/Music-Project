Come, I need your darkness!
May the world be ruled by the crows and their queen!
I am the creator! I am the sap of occult forces!
Fear and torment are shaped... by my hands!!!

Ashes, embers and smoke may you fires blaze
Forth once more! May the dark clouds
And the soulless demons immortal creatures - rise up!
My lords, please come forth, pour out of the obscure limbo
That hides your vaporous energies. That holds back the black snakes
The fomorian demons  the frightful - ghouls!

May the evil spell scatter impudent mortal
You have dared to challenge the fomorian lords
(we must drink) blood for life!

âA taste of the immortal salvation nothing will stop the fomorian demons,
The black snakes hunger for your souls!
So when he took your symbol of unity he was excluded and forced
Hide in the shadows.
Like a spirit, imprisoned in the shadows for centuries!
Like my master, I am moved  by the spirit of revenge!â

Nothing will stop the fomorian demons,
The black snakes hunger for your souls!
So when he took your symbol of unity
He was excluded and forced hide in the shadows.
Like a spirit imprisoned  in the shadows for centuries!
Our might rage will reign - forever!
