Powers of the kingdom
Be ye under my left foot
And in my right hand!

Glory and eternity
Take me by the two shoulders
And direct me in the paths of victory

Mercy and justice
Be ye the equilibrium
And splendour of my life!

Intelligence and wisdom
Crown me! Spirits of Malkuth!
Spirits of Malkuth!
Lead me betwixt the two pillars
Upon which rests the whole edifice of the temple!

Angels of Netsah and Hod
Establish me upon the cubic stone of Yesod!

O Gedulael!
O Geburael!

O Tiphereth! Binael, be ye my love!
Ruach Hochmael, be thou my light!
Be that which thou are
And thou shalt be
O Ketheriel! Ishim
Assist me in the name of Shaddai!
Cherubim, be my strength
In the name of Adonai!
Beni-Elohim be my brethren
In the name of the son
And by the powers of Zebaoth!

Eloim, do battle for me
In the name of Tetragrammaton!
Melachim, protect me
In the name of Yod
He vau he! Seraphim, cleanse my love
In the name of Elvoh!

Hashmalim, enlighten me
With the splendours of Eloi and Shekinah!
Aralim, act! Ophanim
Revolve and shine
Haioth ha Kadosh
Cry, speak, roar, bellow!

Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh,
Shaddai, Adonai, Jotchabah, Eiazereie!
Hallelu-Jah, Hallelu-Jah, Hallelu-Jah,
Amen!
