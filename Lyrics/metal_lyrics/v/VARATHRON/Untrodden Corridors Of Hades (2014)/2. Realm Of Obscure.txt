The night has begun
Under most suspicious signs
The most enchanting show
Howling winds and racing rain!

The passing of time
Is different in our world
When you cross the threshold
You can still change your mind!

Just another victim
Of the dark lord's obscure designs!
Just a mysterious passage
To the wrath and merciless pain!

Balor the master of chaos
Emperor of total darkness!
Ruler of the fearful
Dominates the obscure dimensions!

Master of chaos
Total darkness
Dominates the obscure
Merciless pain

Bloody wounds
And hideous pain
A magnificent night
For a terrifying world

In the night of Samain
(he) secretly kidnaps humans
(far from the) endless battle
Sacrificed to the utter gods 
Bloody and hideous pain
A horrible evil night!

Master of chaos
Total darkness
Dominates the obscure
Merciless pain

Thoughts and visions
Like a journey through time 
Towards the absolute empire 
Of Stygian darkness

Emperor of galaxy
Abysmal darkness
Realm of obscure
Apocryphal blasphemy!
