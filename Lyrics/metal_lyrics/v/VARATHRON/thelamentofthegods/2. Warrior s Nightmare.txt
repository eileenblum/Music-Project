I'm Aurelius The Personal Advisor
Tleilaxu, The Warrior King of Allysia.
Tleilaxu Is A Man of Unquenchible Desires
He Lives For Adrenaline And Blood of War,
He Is Cunning As Well As Skilled
In The Martial Arts Has Led Many Armies.
Against The Barbarians
That Have Misfortune
of Residing In Neighbouring Lands !!!

Soon His Empire S[reads Accross
The Continent Until He Grows
(Weary) And Restless From
The Ease of Victory.

Someday, Th Spirit Comes In His Dream
And Ask Him: (Like A Fearful Whisper)
You Forced Nations To War,
Killed Men, Not For Land or Resources
But For Your Own Selfish Ego
You Want To Control Men
To Prove Your Superiority
How By Slaughtering Husbands,
Fathers, Sons And Lovers...

Fearful Whispers, Eternal Whispers,
Creatures That Appear In Your Slumber,
Do Not Exist In Our World
They Are Part of The Dream Realm.
They Are Called Eternals
And They Are More Powerful Than Ordinary Mortals!!!
Tampering With These Beings Can Be Very Dangerous,
They Can Magnify Our Subconscious Fears
And Desires, A Thousandfold
With Recurring Nightmares Driving Us Insane....

Sirens Sound Like An Incubus,
Such Creatures Bring Erotic Dreams To
People, In The Far Reaches of Imagination
Shrouded From Mortal Eyes, Lies...
... The Dream, Realm..
The Royal Chambers of Aletha,
Sister of The Nightmare King,
goddess of Erotica!!!
It's Time To Meet Her
In your Hell - Dreams!!!
