[By Mercyful Fate]

Upon A Cross A Nun Will Be Hanged
She Will be Raped By An Evil Man
Knock Spikes Through Her Hands
Things Will Come She Won't Understand.

You're A Nun You Haven't Had No Fun
Living Your Life As A Virgin Queen
I'm Gonna Change It And I'll Get It Done
Tomorrow You Won't Be A Virgin Queen.

- C.U.N.T. That's What you Are,
You're C.U.N.T., Yeah !

I Get It Up, I Get It Up The Dark
I Make Her Feel I'm Not A Holy Man
Faster Breathing, She's Like A Shark
She Wants More, I'm Gonna Give Her My Cross !!!

Nuns Have No Fun
They Just Have Their Fathers And Sons
But I'll Give Them Hell I Never Fail.

I Get It Up, I Get It Up The Dark
I Make Her Feel I'm Not A Holy Man
Faster Breathing, She's Like A Shark
She Wants More, I'm Gonna Give Her My Cross !!!

- C.U.N.T. That's What you Are,
You're C.U.N.T., Yeah !
