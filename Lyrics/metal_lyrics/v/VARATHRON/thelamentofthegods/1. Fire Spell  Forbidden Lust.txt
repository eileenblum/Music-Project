Once You Want To Learn,
From The Seas of Ideas.
Once You Wanted To See,,
Through The Walls of Values.
Once You Wanted To Run,
Inside The Labyrinth of Ideals.
Once You Wanted To Be Saved,
Under The Flesh of The Dark god!!!

Perhaps You've Been Disappointed,
By The Number of Your Sentiments.
Peraps You've Walked Out on,
The Mob of Your Desires.
Perhaps You've Got Naked In Front,
of The Mirrors of Your Adoration!!!

Now Isolated, Unexpectedly Lone
An Silent Searching,
Escaping, Running After The Impossible
You Wrath At Your Own Decisions
And Bare Your Flesh
Under The Sight of The Dark god!!!

The Following Day Will Apparently Come,
The One You've Been Told of
Like An Old Myth or Legend.
You Will Learn The Pleasure And Pain
At Their Ultimate Condition
Where Meeting Is Inevitable
Where You Repent Cause You Did So
Where You Perceive The Flesh
Through The Infinite Eyes of The Dark god!!!

You Will Remember Journeys
In Unexplored Regions,
You Will Remember Forbidden Pleasures
In Not - Permitting Times.
You Will Remember Remote Souls In Rites.
(You're Afraid of If You Think of)
You Will Remember The Terror In Your Eyes
Forever, Forever, Forever!
Life You Deserve
To Live For Every Soul
They Let you Sacrifice!!!
