[performed by Varathron]Shattering the serpent egg 
Black shape reincarnates 
Baptized in underworlds places 
Domination of mystical worship 

A weird shrine with malevolent colors 
Manfully conquers the time 
Disequilibrium of universal balance 
La Reine Noir is cast to Earth â La Reine Noir 

Withering in weakly sunlight 
Petrified instincts awaken once again - La Reine Noir 

Number the corpses in the plundered tombs 
Incurable plagues in her immaterial face 

A dance in funeral triumph 
The daughter rides the chariot of fire 

Controls the spirits of all enemies 
Diffusing into the deserts of night 

Withering in weakly sunlight 

Number the corpses in the plundered tombs 
Incurable plagues in her immaterial face
