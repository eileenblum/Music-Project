[performed by Varathron]Deep in the dark light 
that covers me
Beyond the gates which mortals live
Where I'll face the everlasting doom
I thank whatever ancients may be 

Journey into moonlight
Dance the macabre
The cult of the dragon
What I call destiny

Where the chariots of fire
cross the sun
and bat shade figures 
hide the moon
The reign of the Black Serpent
Beyond that river
Where the sins of Immortality
are drowned
