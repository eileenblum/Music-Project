[performed by Varathron]Finally from the depths of Egypt 
Nocturnal arrival of the strange one 
Thy who was worshipped by the nomads 
Thy who was followed by beasts 

Abyssic born emerging from the sea 
Forgotten lands and cold towers â Covered all over with seaweeds 
The Earth scratched in two weird plains 

Circle within circle, eye within eye 
And when the sacred hour comes 

From words they passed to obscure deeds 
The final step before the apocalypse 

Archegonig theory is fallen by reborn 
Thy who believed once â Follow the light now 
Marking the time to mystical tressbirth 

That which saved him made him stronger 
And he destroyed everything he had 
The Melouzin's child is cast on earth 
Nothing but shadows waves remain
