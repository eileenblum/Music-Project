We all... tried to touch the sky,
Every body attempted to touch the sun
To touch material without spirit
But all the time bitterness
Remained in their souls!

Through the ancient books
Of the lost kingdoms,
Through the golden book of the deads,
Through the obscure sight of hecate,
The insuperable goddess.

The god you believe in, the god you expected
The god you hoped for, the god you dream of.

Nightmares always to wake you up,
To remind you, you are alive,
A living dead who remembers
Would remember life beyond death!
An ungraceful body with a rotten soul
Which howls through it's leprous
Flesh that... there is no god!!!!
Your god is dead,
Your god a abandoned you,
Because you never trusted yourself
You always wanted everything,
Simply without pain, blood and pleasure!!!!

The god you believe in, the god you expected,
The god you hoped for, the god you dream of.

Blasphemy, your inaccessible dreams!
Hatred, your impious thought!
Irony, your ungraceful life!
Salvation, your ultimate sacrifice!

My name is fear
I come to remind you everything
I'm coming to remind you those
You try to forget,
Those you would sacrifice.
Ten lives, so as to forget them forever!!!
My name is anger
My name is hatred
Which reigns in your soul
Through phobias and shame
Through psychotic flickers
Through the maze
Of your rotten soul!!!!
My name is salvation
(and perhaps) someday I shall return
To save you from your passions
Torments and pricks of conscience,
To lead you to the eternal rest,
Endless peace, mortal calm!!!!

My name is death,
I come to take your soul,
Oh! Disastrous moment
I'm coming to decapitate you
To sacrifice this rotten corpse
And devour your damned soul!!!
I'll burn you in hell!!
I'll burn you in hell!!

Your god is dead,
Your god abandoned you,
You will always be ageing
But not dying,
Everlasting torment,
Everlasting lust,
Without pain, blood and pleasure!
Queer desire! ? Bizarre lust!
Queer desire! Bizarre lust!

We all... tried to touch the sky,
Everybody attempted to touch the sun
To tough material without spirit
But all the time bitterness
Remained in their souls!!!

Through the ancient books
Of the lost kingdoms,
Through the golden book of the deads,
Through the obscure sight of hecate,
The insuperable goddess!!!!

The god you believe in, the god you expected
The god you hoped for, the god you dream of.

There is no god, there is no god!!!
