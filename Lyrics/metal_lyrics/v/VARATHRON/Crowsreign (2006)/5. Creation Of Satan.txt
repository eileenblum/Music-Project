Mind that shadow
That might follow you
Look at her fiery eyes
Listen to her whispering
Whispers of madness!!

An infernal creature
A miasma an impious being
Some abominable
Creation of Satan!!!

Mind those eyes
The eyes of a nightmare
Fall in the arms
Of despair!!!

She is waiting - beyond any concept of time
To give you - the kiss of paranoia
To drop you - to the darkness of loss
To worship you - like an infernal god!

Listen to the sound
Which gains strength in your mind
Its rhythm drives you crazy
Its intensity puts you to death!!

A horrible cacophony
A gathering of madness
That affects your mind
With damned intension!!

Deformed shadows
Demonic brilliances
Howling of the damned
Wake up the dead
In the night!!!
Lost in a maze
Of dark thoughts
With no hope of escape
You listen to
Choked by your sweat!!!

You are waiting for the moment
That all will be over
Absolute silence mocking
You know, it's coming!!!
You know, it's coming!!!
Terror, raider
In your soul
You can't hear your cry
Only the beats of a crying heart!!!
Only the beats of a crying heart!

She is waiting - beyond any concept of time
To give you - the kiss of paranoia
To drop you - to the darkness of loss
To worship you - like an infernal god!!

Mind those eyes
The eyes of a nightmare
Fall in the arms
Of despair!!

An infernal creature
A miasma an impious being
Some abominable
Creation of Satan!!!!
