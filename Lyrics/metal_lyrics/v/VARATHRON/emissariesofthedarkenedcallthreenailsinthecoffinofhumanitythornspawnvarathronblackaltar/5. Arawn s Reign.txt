[performed by Varathron]Aeons ago the demons rise
From the depths
Of The underworld
Monster, abomination, demon
Priest call me the plague

My name is... Arawn

I am the lord of the burnt lands
The god of the other world
The master of shadows
The king of dead
The lord of demon reich

My name is... Arawn

Humans tremble in my presence
For good reasons
I know no pity
I despise weakness
I do not know love and
I am only capably of hatred!

Many have defied me,
Betrayed me or battled me...
Warriors, priests, wizards,
Kings, giants, gods
They had already met
With the acrid taste of hate
Failure, abuse and humiliation

I do not know peace
I am always at war

They become my prey, my toys,
My slaves,
I wanted them to remember
Their defeat
I wanted them to remember

Who their master was

I am the lord of chaos
The god of wrath
The god of revenge
The lord of demon reich

My name is... Arawn!!!
