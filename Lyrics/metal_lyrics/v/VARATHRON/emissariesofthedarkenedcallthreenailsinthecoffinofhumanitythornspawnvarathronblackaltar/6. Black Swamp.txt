[performed by Varathron]Dark waters, black swamp

Centuries ago
In sacred east
Two rival clans
Were engaged in a blody war!
Far beyond the battlefield,
In the castle of the Okada clan
Was the scene of some strange events.

Time went by and winter came
Abandoned by everyone,
Lady orin wandered
Alone by the shores of the lake

Dark waters, black swamp

She discovered the power of the lake,
She was at my mercy,
A prisoner of my lake,
But the night,
Destroy my eternity!
That's what she tried to do!
She knows that the lake water
is holy because her soul
is imprisoned in it!

This desperate act is unforgivable
In the eyes of the gods
And you will never be reborn
To a new life
Accursed to eternity
You will be condemned to roam
between life and ... death!

Dark waters, black swamp

This life or spirit grants me
Forbidden sights of ghastly dimensions
you got condemned ypurself,
To roam among lost souls
The gods made me guardian
Of the sacred water!
I have the power to cross
The frontiers of the invisible.
