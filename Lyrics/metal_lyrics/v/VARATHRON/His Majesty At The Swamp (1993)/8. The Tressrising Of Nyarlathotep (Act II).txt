Finally from the depths of Egypt
Nocturnal arrival of the strange one
Thou who was worshipped by the nomads
Thou who was followed by beasts

Abyssic born emerging from the sea
Forgotten lands and cold towers
Covered all over with seaweeds
The earth scratched in two weird plains

Circle within circle
Eye within eye
And when the sacred hour comes
From words they passed to obscure deeds
The final step before the apocalypse

Archegonic theory is fallen by reborn
Thy who believed once
Follow the light now
Marking the time to mystical tressbirth

That which saved him
Made him stronger
And he destroyed
Everything he had

The melouzin's child
is cast on earth
Nothing but shadows waves remains...
