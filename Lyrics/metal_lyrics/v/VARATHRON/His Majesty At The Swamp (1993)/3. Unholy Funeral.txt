Merciless slaughter
On the altar of darkness
The demons are rattling their swords
The battle started
In the bowels of the earth
(In the bowels of the Tartarus)
Blasphemous warcries, leper sound
Miasma of a damned soul
The graves are opened

The time stopped
The psalms sound
The abyssis reign of blasphemy
The pleasure of sin, last invocation to thy

The bloody revenge boiled
Pain, hate for them
Who will not see the light again
The darkness is ruling
No mercy to the sacrilege dogs
Fire and leper-curse to them
Black mass, unholy invocation
Last confession, ultimate pain
