Hear his howling cries
Cover all silence of the night
Footprints in the weeping ground
It's the beginning of winter

The season of the wolf
The century of promise
Amon reveals the messiah son
This winter will last forever
Lustful father
Mist in the night
Tholio servant
Engrave the magic spells

The hunter now is the hunted
The forest wears its black
All nocturnal nature
Obey this unutterus born

The visions of our monarchy
Reborn in your eyes
We swear faith to you
Proudly (we'll) fight at your side
Lustful father
Embody like a wolf
Lustful father
Into man's skin

The hunter now is the hunted
The forest wears its black
All nocturnal nature
Obey this unutterus born
