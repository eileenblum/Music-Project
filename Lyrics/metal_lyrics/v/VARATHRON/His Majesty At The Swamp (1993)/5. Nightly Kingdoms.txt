Such different pictures
The loneliness kills
Waiting for bells to ring
The strikes to be heard
So much coldness circling me
The murmur of the trees
I'm waiting to see you
My eternal destiny!

The nightly kingdoms
The forgotten ones
Dark-dressed warriors
Searching for the key

At forgotten castles
At unholy graves
In my mystic tomb
Where I rest my soul
Ancient event awakes
An agreement signed in blood
Buried testaments revealed

Oh! I see it - in your eyes!
My name is Elrik
King of kings
Look at my works, ye mighty, and despair

Oh! Dark - wizards
Oh! Mighty - lords
You rule now - our planet
As once signed...
