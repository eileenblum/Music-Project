Unholy dream
Beyond the crucified gods
Unholy awakening
Beyond the forgotten memories
The idol of a false paradise
In the mirror of time
Souls are struggling - silence!
Inflamed from pain

And you are wandering
In an eternal quest
In the forest of souls
Searching salvation
In their shadow realm

Apocryphal invocation
And infernal psalms
Whispers at the wind of doom
Beyond the forgotten realms
Looking in your inner self
You realize, the truth

Your gods will defy
Your existence
In your weakness
You'll worship them
You shall remember
They shall forget
Forever be cursed
Till your soul meets unholiness
