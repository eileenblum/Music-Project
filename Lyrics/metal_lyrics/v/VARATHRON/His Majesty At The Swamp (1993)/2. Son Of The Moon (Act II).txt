The memories shift fast
Into the labyrinth of your mind
As you have forgotten the past
Oh! Son of the sky and the moon

Look upon the beauty of the red sky
Through the cyclones of hate
When the ruins long for the lost grandeurs (Lost grandeurs)
The mourning, the fear, the passion
All those who made you strong
When the fire and steel created the world
You lived and reigned upon, (once)
You trampled on it
Oh! Son of the sky and the moon

The memories swift fast
Into the labyrinth of your mind
As you have forgotten the past
Oh! Son of the sky and the moon

You who spilled the blood of innocents
Upon your feet, along with tears and woe
Your fixed glance is fading away
Into the horizon, as a sunbeam in the rain
You remember and your heart tightens from pain
For the forgotten times of glory
The hatred (your symbol), the fear your motive
Oh! Son of the sky and the moon

Destruction, she who gave birth to you
And replaced, your heart with frozen stone
Do not await deliverance from the priests of the temple of Amon
Who once you engulfed in flames
Only malice and curses, that fear the night as thunder

"Glory to thee who resurrects you
After centuries to sow
The ancient wickedness once more
Oh! Lord of the moon and the unspeakable darkness!
I leave to thee whatever hath been
Left from my divine soul
As a grain of sand in the vastness
Deliver me - Oh! Mighty father
And then - I shall be king!
Beyond the veil of death..."
