Silently it creeps out into my veins, then it crawls back again
Knowing that they have been passed down through time
I can no longer claim these feelings to be mine alone

This blackened heart will never be pure
For feelings like this - there is no cure
Cleansing my blood with lies and lies
That feeds on my hunger for life

Days on repeat
Stuck in this bluprint
I've made for myself

I'm beginning to believe in
The impossibility of things
Ever getting back to normal
