When life becomes a carnival of pain
Impossible to stand for one more day
For one more hour, when it seems to
Get worse, so much worse

I can't imagine how it must feel
When this is over, when this is over
Wrong becomes right for my tired eyes
When this is over, when this is over

Crushed between tons of thoughts
A landslide mind too caught up to find
Any resonable excuses to why you brought
Your nightmares to exchange with mine

Fill in the blanks of your stupidity
With bricks of meat and electricity
And the sounds of reversing your gears
And the wretching sight of my fears
