Weakening, slowly breaking down my defence
Reasoning, your words must be the cause of my distrust

If you give the world a chance
It will beat you down to your knees
If you try to fight it back
It will beat you again and again

There Ã­s a pain much greater than any one you can feel through your skin
Greater than broken bones, cut up flesh or anything physical
When the fabric of you soul is torn to shreds by yourself
Or by others, itÃ­s torture

If you can feel a shiver at the edge of your mind,
Don't be afraid - you've just got your eyes closed.
If you feel something brush against your skin
Don't be afraid and just keep your eyes closed

The one whose face can launch a thousand ships
Has the power to crush the hearts of them all

When you are sinking thru the black void of the ocean
It Ã­s a continuous discomfort that the world is unforgiving
A relentless torrent of punishment

An inward glance of your fragile self
Can be all to immense to comprehend
So turn your eyes of despair towards the sun
Forge your will into steel and slice the wind

If you can feel a shiver at the edge of your mind,
Don't be afraid - you've just got your eyes closed.
If you feel something brush against your skin
Don't be afraid and just keep your eyes closed

If you give the world a chance
It will beat you down to your knees
If you try to fight it back
It will beat you again and again

If you can feel a shiver at the edge of your mind,
Don't be afraid - you've just got your eyes closed.
If you feel something brush against your skin
Don't be afraid and just keep your eyes closed
