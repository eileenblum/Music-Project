The odds outweight me now
I'm facing a calamity from the sky
Too much for any one person to bare
The air is thick and burnt
My friends have succumbed to the pressure
Can I face this colossus alone
If its true that it always feels darkest
Just before it turns pitch black
Where will I turn when the fire engulfs me
Blistering skin only holy can save me
I'm challenging my fate

I know my final destination, but not the road
I've reached as far as I can go
Only the lifestream can heal this wound
Take me away on a highwind
I'm under your wing
I'm in your command
Lady Luck don't fail me now
I trust in you

Put all of your bets on me
My fortitude is now put to the test
I will stand here strong
Until the force devours my soul
Like a ghost in a shell, the remains of myself
Are strewn across the desert of the real - this battlefield
Your prayer Ã­s all that Ã­s left of me - heartfelt angst
Dissolving, Releasing

I know my final destination, but not the road
I've reached as far as I can go
Only the lifestream can heal this wound
Take me away on a highwind
I'm under your wing
I'm in your command
Lady Luck don't fail me now
I trust in you

Is this the end ?
This isn't the end yet
Have we done all that we could do
We've done all that we could do
The lifestream - It's coming.
As I remember you
I think of the words you said
I wasn't there to save you
I'm on my own now
I trust in the lifestream

The words of my mind are spinning in reverse
I summon all my strengh but it turns into dust
It doesn't change anything
When are things ever gonna go my way?
I'm under your wing
I'm in your command
Lady Luck don't fail me now
I trust in you
