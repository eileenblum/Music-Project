Glow, absent sun.
Throw your final light of hope,
I will quench it anyway.
Some will leave and some will stay,
But most important, they will submit to change.

The sky is darker than it has ever been,
A massive night has condensed.
You think that everything will turn and be alright,
but where you are wrong, I am right,
Because I know something that you don't.
Thatâs why I must come back.

I know that I can change you, it's in my hands.
This is our doom and I won't let you live in uncertainty.
For as long as you exist I will never get what I want.
Therefore I choose to suffer, and so should you.

There will inevitably be resistance. I know this all too well.
I have been here before. You shut your eyes and ignore all my words.
I am talking to deaf ears, but mark my words:
You will never see the light of day.
No one can save you now.
