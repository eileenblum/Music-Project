BLOOD WAS SPREAD
THE FIRST VISION WAS LOST

FINAL COMBAT
WILL TAKE PLACE
TRADITION WAS BROKEN
CEREMONY'S BLOODSHED
POISON WAS THROWN
THE EVIL'S FLOWERS WAS SOWED

ROTTEN FLESH WILL SMELL
PULSES ON THE EARTH
THE GRAVE WAS VIOLATED
WHILE THE COWARDS FLED
ANGER WILL TAKE PLACE
NOBODY WILL
CRY FOR THAT

MESSENGER FROM HELL
MESSENGER FROM HELL
MESSENGER FROM HELL

MESSENGER FROM HELL
MESSENGER FROM HELL
MESSENGER FROM HELL

RIDING TO FIND WHO THAT HE SEEKS
