YOU PRETEND TO BE A GOOD MAN
BUT YOUR MIND IS DARK, DYING IN PAIN
LEARNING HOW TO BE MANKIND'S VAIN
TORMENTING YOUR MIND, MAKING YOU BLIND

BURN YOUR SOUL
EXECUTING THE SPELL
IN THE ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL

YOUR SONS ARE DYING
YOU CAN HANDLE THEIR LIVES
FEELING LIKE A MURDERER
WITH A KNIFE IN YOUR HANDS
YOU'VE GOT A CUT THROAT
AND YOU GONNA SINK IN YOUR BLOOD

BURN YOUR SOUL
EXECUTING THE SPELL
IN THE ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL

HIDING YOUR FATE
IN PROFOUND OF HELL
WITH HEART FULL OF HATE
LIKE THE DARKNESS THE DEMONS DWELL

TRAPPED IN YOUR MIND
THERE'S AN EVIL SMILE
STRETCHING OUT YOUR BLOODY HANDS
'COS PEOPLE DIE AT YOUR COMMAND

BURN YOUR SOUL
EXECUTING THE SPELL
IN THE ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL

YOU MET YOUR FATE
TROOP OF MINDED SLAVES
GO RISE ALL THE SPIRITS OF HELL
