IN THE NAME OF GLORIOUS
THE PEN SIGNED THE PAIN
CARRYING THE ENEMY TO FIRE
NO VESTIGE, NEITHER DUST

TRUTH COMES FROM THE VILLAGE
SPREADING RUMORS AMONG THE CANDLES
PUTTING IN A RISK ALL COINS AND
THE RULES OF YOUR GRACE

GOD'S ANGER
TO THE DEVIL'S CRIMINALS
STRIPPED OF HIS POWER

ANIMALS WERE BEWITCHED
THE TRADE IN CHARMS
TO WARD OF WITCHES
EVIL SPIRITS WRITTEN THE PACT
THE TRIAL AND THE PUNISHMENT
FOR SUCH OFFENCES WAS DEATH

TO FIRE WITCHES AND EVIL SPIRITS
HIDDEN FOR OFFENCES BY CHURCH

GOD'S ANGER
TO THE DEVIL'S CRIMINALS
STRIPPED OF HIS POWER

SUFFERING IN THE NAME OF GOD
ANGUISH IN THE NAME OF LORD

ANGELS WEEP AND DEVILS REJOICE
PAY YOUR SIN IN THE ASHES OF BLAZE
FOR THE MOST WILD WITH THE PEN
REJECTING ALL OF THE OWN EVIDENCE
BUILT CHURCHES WITH YOUR BLOOD
THROUGH THE FEAR, TERROR AND LIES
