NOW YOU'RE GOOD, NOW YOU'RE FINE
AND ON EVERY SINGLE DAY
DOWN YOUR KNEES IN A PRAY
PRETENDING BE ANOTHER MAN
WITH THE BIBLE IN YOUR HAND
YOU'RE RELIABLE LIKE SAND
SECRETLY WORKING TO THE DARK
IN YOU HEART, THE EVIL'S MARK

BURN, SINNER BURN
BURN IN HELL, SINNER, BURN

ALL THE GRASS YOU'LL SMOKE
ALL THE ELDERLY YOU'LL STROKE
ALL THE VICTIMS YOU'LL MAKE
ALL THE MONEY YOU'LL TAKE

NOW THEY GOT YOU WITH THE BIBLE
ALL YOU PROMISED THEM WAS MARBLE
FILLED WITH WITH THEIR BLIND'S MONEY
YOU TURNED THEIR LIVES BITTER HONEY

BURN, SINNER BURN

BURN IN HELL SINNER, BURN
COS GOOD PEOPLE YOU WON'T TURN
SHOWING YOURSELF LIKE AN ANGEL
YOU SHOULD BE LOCKED IN A DUNGEON

ALL THE GRASS YOU'LL SMOKE
ALL THE ELDERLY YOU'LL STROKE
ALL THE VICTIMS YOU'LL MAKE
ALL THE MONEY YOU'LL TAKE
BURN, SINNER BURN
