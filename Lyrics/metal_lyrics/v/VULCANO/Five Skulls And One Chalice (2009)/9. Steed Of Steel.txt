BIRDS OF PREY FLYING IN CIRCLES
AWAITING THE MOMENT FOR A SAD NEW BANQUET
GLOOMY AND SOLITARY SICK, OLD WANDERER
ACTS ON BEHALF OF THE BESTIAL LAW

SAD SPIRIT CAUSES HIS OWN RUIN
SCARS IN HIS FACE ARE SHOWING HIS FEELINGS
BLOOD IN HIS HANDS AND SPELLING DARK VERSES
TO GET FROM THIS NIGHT AN ETERNAL MANTLE

STEED OF STEEL THROW SPARKLES TO THE SKIES
STEED OF STEEL COVER THE SEAS WITH BLOOD
STEED OF STEEL BLOW ON THE COSMIC DUST
STEED OF STEEL BE THE FIRE

CONSUMING WITHOUT LEAVING TRACES
IT WILL BE THE ANCIENT FIRE
CONSUMING WITHOUT LEAVING VESTIGES

UNDER THE COVER OF ETERNAL MANTLE
HE WALKS IN THE SHADOWS TO SURPRISE HIS PRAY
READY TO KILL THE THIRST OF HIS SOUL
IN THE COLD HANDS IS TREMBLE HIS BLADE

FRAMES FROM THE PAST TORMENTING HIS MIND
SOUNDS OF SORROW FORGOTTEN TIME
THE BLADE IS SINGING, THE HEADS ARE ROLLING
UNDER A RED BLOOD SUNRISE OF THE KNIGHT
