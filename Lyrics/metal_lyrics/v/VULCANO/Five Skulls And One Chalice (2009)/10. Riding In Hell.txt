WHEN THE WORLD WILL BE OVER HE WILL LIGHT
BETWEEN THE TRASHED AND MISERY
THE DEVIL'S SON WILL COME

RIDING IN HIS HORSE
HE WILL RIDE
IN THE NAME OF SATAN
TO KILL THE CHRISTIANS

AND THEM THE GROUND WILL TAKE
THE EVIL WILL RULE
THE CHRISTIANS WILL DIE
AND HE WILL LAUGH...

RIDING IN HELL
RIDING IN HELL

THE SEA AND THE EARTH WILL REVOLT
AND THE LUCIFER'S ARMS FOR THE
DEVIL WILL FIGHT TAKING REGIONS, DON'T MIND
WITH HUMAN LIVES ONLY WANT TO KILL
