The coming of the chosen 
Bringing death and destruction
These false scavengers
Jackals mercenaries
Who tread our way

During the longest of times 
We'll walk through these lands 
With our shining blades 
By the glow of our minds

Hypocrisy misery 
The ash will cover 
Take our victory 
The show is not over

Just the true ones must stay 
Were sick of your existence 
Find their way out 
And die like a fool

Hypocrisy misery 
The ash will cover 
Take our victory 
The show is not over

Annihilate... all of them! 
Annihilate... one by one! 
Annihilate... one by one!!!!
