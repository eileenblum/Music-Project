The face of the church is marred 
By sins against humanity 
This is the day of salvation 
Pope is out
Religious hypocrisy
Applause himself
The threat church its lambs 
He leading astray

Hallelujah on fire

Gloomy preacher 
The saints with no guiding light 
On this sinner's night 
Peter was always wrong 
Denied the cross and denied himself 
The guardian left his servants

Hallelujah on fire
