Walking on the narrow lane 
At the direction of the noise 
Rats crossing your feet 
Serpent and worms 
Awaiting his fatal fall 
Slave of the senses 
Wobbling undirected 
But souls do not die 
In the whirlwind of coarse elements 
Crossing the threshold of danger 
In the silence of the grave 
Succumbs to temptation first 
In the abyss of eternity
