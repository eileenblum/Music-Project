The creature steps into 
The dead water and black 
Won the first evidence 
But does not triumph over death 
By assiduous worship 
The hands malignant 
Asks by shout
Scream for mercy,
But do not expect anything 
The final minutes will be horrible 
The torn flesh and the endless pain. 
Will take to agony
The eerie creature, it will impose 
The greater the sufferings 
No being ever felt so 
Legs stretched
Arms shattered
Screams of horror increase 
The hatred of the creature
