Compulsive gambler 
No matter win or lose 
I arrive late at my home
Only my dog waiting 
The bone plate 
Broken bones 
Another night without money
But do not spirit lack
The TV off air 
Cans, clothing and vinyls
Deep sleep in hell 
Tomorrow will be another day
I'll take my boots 
And will run behind some coins
Dream deep in heaven
