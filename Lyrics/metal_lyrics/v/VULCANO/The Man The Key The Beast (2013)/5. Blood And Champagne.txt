The popular uprising
Against tyranny
The money comes
From outside to ensure
Glasses of champagne
In the great halls of hotels
Outside
Chemical weapons 
Against targets uncertain 
Forcing the rebels resistance 
A scary sign of combat 
While the last dose 
Drain on their lips 
Joy in the foam of champagne 
The cruelest surprise has began
Gas paralyzes the breathing 
Lethal agent was spread 
Dressed in white scarf 
Cuban cigars
Bubbly champagne 
Threatening tap the button 
Bombing all until the end 
Dressing in uniform 
Cuban cigars, bubbly blood
