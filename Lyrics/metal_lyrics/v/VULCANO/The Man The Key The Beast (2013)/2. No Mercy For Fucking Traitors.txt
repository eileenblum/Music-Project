Lord of metal, shining and solid metal 
Oh lord, master of all masters 
Power from heat 
Master of ligths 
God of sounds

Force of fist, tireless fighter 
Steel claws 
Dreaded master 
Feared lord, live to die

Die by metal! die! die! 
Die by metal! die! die! 
Die by metal!

Death metal... attack 
Against wimps and falses 
They bleed in his hands 
Fainting in agony	

Metal! metal until death! 
Fight to the last chance 
No mercy for fucking traitors 
Metal until death!

Metal! metal until death! 
Fight to the last chance 
No mercy for fucking traitors 
Metal until death!

Die! die! die! 

Die! die! die! die!
