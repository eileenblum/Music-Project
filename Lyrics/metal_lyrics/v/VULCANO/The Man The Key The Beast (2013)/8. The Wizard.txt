Behold the wizard 
With his powers 
In his presence 
The wind blows 
The earth trembles 
A new vibration 
The mace 
The guardian of infinite power 
Relentless is your persuasion 
The way of mage it is fire 
The fire is water 
The water is earth 
Banishing and invoking 
The minor arcana 
Behold the wizard 
Supreme lord of the zodiac belt
