There was a time when the devil reigned 
He won his seat after armageddon 
Without christians, without jews 
God washed his hands 
Religions were destroyed 
And the angels of hell lived among us. 
But a sinister force rising 
Worst of all evil, chaos dominated

The devil escaped from earth 
God hated all 
The sinister era reigned 
Grim forces generating chaos

Total disorder all left alone
There was no human concept
Was the worst of all evils
You know what i'm talking about?
No, do not!
Why can not know

The devil escaped from earth 
God hated all 
The sinister era reigned 
Grim forces generating chaos
