EVEN WORSE THAN HARMING YOUR BQDY
IS HARMING YOUR SOUL LISTNING TO THINGS 
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE

EVEN WORSE THAN SEEING THE SAVAGES OF WAR
IS SEEING FORGOTTEN OLD MEN
BUT THEY'RE NOT ON THE NEWS
THEYâRE NOT ON TV

HUNGRY CHILDREN FILLED WITH HATE 
LOOK AT STORES FULL OF FOOD 
THOUGH THEY DO NOT EXIST
WE MUST PERSIST
TO CHANGE THIS WHITE VIOLENCE 
PRODUCT OF DIRTY CAPITALISM

EVEN WORSE THAN HARMING YOUR BODY
IS GIVING HALF YOUR SALARY TO THESE WORMS
AND WORSE THAN THE SAVAGE OF WAS
IS SEEMING THE CHILDREN DEAD FROM THIS WAR

YOUR CHILDREN
