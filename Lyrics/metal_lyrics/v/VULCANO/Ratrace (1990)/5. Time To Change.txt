YOU TALK BUT YOU NEVER FIGHT
YOU SHOUT BUT YOU NEVER ACT
YOU SEE BUT YOU NEVER CARE
YOU LISTEN BUT YOU REMAIN SILENT

THEY LAUGH WHILE YOU CRY
THEY RIPP OFF WHILE YOU PAY
YOUâVE GOT THE ANSWER BUT YOU NEED COURAGE
YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE WEAPONS
JUST TAKE A STAND

NO TO RACISM 
NO TO DRUGS 
NO TO WAR
NO TO PAIN

YOU MIGHT THINK I'M INCOHERENT
BUT NO, I'VE LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN RIGHT
AND WRONG...
AND IT'S TIME TO CHANGE

THINK ABOUT REALITY AROUND YOU
THINK ABOUT SLAVERY
THINK ABOUT STARVATION
AND THINK IT'S TIME TO CHANGE
