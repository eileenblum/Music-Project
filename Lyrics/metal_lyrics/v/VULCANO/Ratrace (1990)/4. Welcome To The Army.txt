THIS IS THE MAD HOUSE
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN
HOW TO GET CRAZY
THIS IS NO FUN
YOU'LL DO WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO
YOU MUST BE QUITE CLEVER TO GET OUT
BEFORE YOU LOOSE YOUR MIND
THIS IS THE MAD HOUSE
DON'T BE AFRAID
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU
UNTIL YOUR LAST DAY
WELCOME TO HELL
CAN YOU HEAR THE ARMY BELLS
THEY WANT YOU TO BE A SLAVE
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
YES SIR
NO SIR
EXCUSE ME SIR
THANK YOU SIR
NOW. WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
A FRESH CHICKEN RISING FROM HIS MOM'S ASS
HEY BOY. WHATâS WRONG WITH YOUR HAIR ?
YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO KEEP IT LONG
