EVENWORSE THAN HARMING YOUR BODY
IS HARMING YOUR SOUL SEEING THINGS On TV 
THINGS YOU CAN NEVER BUY

EVENWORSE THAN HARMING YOUR BODY
IS HARMING YOUR SOUL LISTNING TO THINGS 
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE

HUNGRY CHILDREN FILLED WITH HATE 
LOOK AT STONES FULL OF FOOD

EVEN WORSE THAN SEEING THE SAVAGES OF WAR 
IS SEEING FORGOTEN OLD MEN
BUT THEY'RE NOT ON THE NEWS

THOUGH THEY DO NOT EXIST
WE MUST PERSIST
TO CHANGE THIS WHITE VIOLENCE
PRODUCT OF DIRTY CAPITALISM

EVEN WORSE THAN HARMING YOUR BODY
IS GIVING HALF YOUR SALARY TO THESE WORMS
AND WORSE THAN THE SAVAGES OF WAR
IS SEEING CHILDREN DEAD FROM THIS WAR

YOUR CHILDREN, WHITE VIOLENCE
