THE MOST NATURAL GREEN AREAS OF THE EARTH
AIR BEING DESTROYED
INDIANS AND ECOLOGISTS SHOUT
AT THE IGNORANT PEOPLE IN SOCIETY
HOW LONG WILL THIS VIRUS SPREAD WITHOUT A SOLUTION ?

WE MUST CUT OUT OUR HABITS OR CUT OFF OUR OWN BREATH

FORESTS AND ECOLOGICAL RESERVES ARE KILLED BY THE
EXPLOITATION
WITHOUT ANY RESPECT FOR NATURE
PLANTS ROT AND DIE ON THE EARTH 
NONE CAN BE REPLACED

SAVAGE CAPITALISM MAKES THE 3RD WORLD
DEVOSTATE OUR FORESTS TO PAY OUR DEPTS
THIS CULTIVATION OF DEATH
SOON WILL EAT UP ALL OF OUR FORESTS AND GOLD
THEY'RE TAKING IT AWAY FROM US...

THE RATS FROM THIS RATRACE
HAVE SHUT DOWN MUCH OF THE EARTH'S LUNG
AND NOW THEY WANT TO RULE AND KILL
IT'S REMAINDER
