HUMAN BEINGS INSTINCT
BORN TO LIVE AND LIVE TO WIN 
THEREâS NO RULES IN THIS GAME 
THIS IS A RATRACE

THEY DON'T CARE IF YOU STEAL
THEY DON'T CARE IF YOU LIE
THEY DON'T CARE IF YOU KILL
THEY DON'T CARE IF YOU DIE

EVERYONE IS IN THIS VICIOUS CIRCLE 
ACTING LIKE CARNIVOROUS BEASTS 
WAITING FOR THE MOMENT TO CATCH YOU 
AND KICK YOU OUT OF THE RACE

QNLY THE STRONG SURVIVE
THERE IS NO COACH IN THIS GAME,YOU'RE THE TEAM! 
THERE IS NO ACE IN THIS GAME, VOU'RE DEAD! 
THEYâVE GOT STRENGHT, WHILE YOU'VE GOT WEAKNESS

WHAT YOU WANT
IS TO RULE THE WORLD
THROUGH YOUR JOB...
WITH YOUR GiRLS.
ON THE STREETS...
IN THE SCHOOL.
STAY ON YOUR FEET....
KILL THE FOOLS..
