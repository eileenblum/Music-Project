PEOPLE ARE REVOLTING 
AGAINST THE TYRANNY 
OF DICTATORS
NATIONS FIGHT TO DESTROY
WEAK SOCIAL SYSTEMS 
THE SHAME REALITY

THEY FIGHT AGAINST STARVATION 
THEY FIGHT AGAINST EXPLORATION 
THEY FIGHT TO SURVIVE
IT'S A MATTER OF TIME

THE EARTH IS IN AGONY
AND MANKIND HAS NOW JUST REALIZED IT
MANY INSTITUTIONS FIGHT TO PRESERVE THE PEACE
FIGHT FOR LIBERTY
FIGHT AGAINST DICTATORS
FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL
BUT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
UNTIL ALL IS FINISHED

THEY FIGHT AGAIN5T STARVATION.THEY FIGHT 
THEY FIGHT AGAINST EXPLORATION,THEY FIGHT 
THEY FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL,THEY FIGHT
