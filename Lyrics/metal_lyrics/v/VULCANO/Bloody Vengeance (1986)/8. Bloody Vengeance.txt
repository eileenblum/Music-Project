Dark and cold
So horrible, so terrible
My bloody vengeance

I'll take my vengeance
For the prince's name and hell's
Crown

I'll take my vengeance
Your blood, your blood
Your flaming blood
In my hand

I'm an avenger
A blood-minded avenger
All for the prince's name and hell
And fire land

Running away from the vile lane
And you run by the dirty narrow way
Your terrified steps won't save
Yourself from the pain

Your blood, your blood
Your flaming blood
In my hand
Be cursed
Your destination
Your flesh, your flesh
