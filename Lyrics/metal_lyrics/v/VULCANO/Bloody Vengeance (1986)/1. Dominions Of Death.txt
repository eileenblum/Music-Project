Rapid black thunders
Shake the sky
While headbangers
Shake 'till die
The sound is detoned
'Till the highest volume
And altars burn
As hell's wombs

Rituals begin
Lucifer will be free
Demons are called
To serve the evil

And the black metal forces
Powerfull like death
Still in command
To destroy your mind

Dominions of death
Dominions of death

The moon is full
Satan's rule
Bloody become free
Demons spreaded in the sky
Bodies blaze in flames
Children run away with fear
Panic become gloomy
We're in a real hell

There is no more life
The earth is over
The Christian souls
Become Satan's rules
Angels are murdered
Crosses are broken
Priests lost their lives
To defend God
To defend God
