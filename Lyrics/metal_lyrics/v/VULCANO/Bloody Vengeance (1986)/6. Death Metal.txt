I become a possessed
I start shaking
The pentagram flames
Bring shine to my eyes
The sacred cross burning to call
For the sabbath beginning
The sacrifice acclaimed for all

Death Metal
Destroyin' your body
Death Metal
Downin' your mind
Death Metal
Mortal holocaust
Death Metal
Metal chaos

Now the demons from my mind
Take freedom
And I stay taken by chains
Because sooner or later I'll have
To kill or die...
