The night comes you asleep
And I look for you
To your dreams come true
Tearless and taken by my power
Your dreams burning in this night
In thousant orgy
Fuck your soul and suck your force
When you feel your body coming

Call me Incubus - the luxury demon

I'm the way you want in your own
Illusion
Fuckin' your soul like a bestial
Sound
Restless you awake to your dirty life
Sure you like bein' in the paradise
But in my paradise

Call me Incubus
