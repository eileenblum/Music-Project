The sky burns in fire
It's coming the ritual time
Satan's slaves getting ready
To rise up spirits of evil
Children are killed
To be offered to a jackal
Who's prepared
To receive the darkness master

Bougies are lighted
Above a pentagram
Blood became food
Of Satan's slaves
Agonizing screams are listened
Coming from rituals
Heaven and hell
Soon will be alone

Spirits of evil
Commanding the death
Spirits of evil
Will brand their regress

Blasphemies are venerated
Against religions
While they wait
The end of times
Dances and songs
Are played
To please the spirits of evil

Now priest
Already have to be afraid
The christianism is getting over
Over the earth
The beast rage will fall
Raging everything that is in
His way...
