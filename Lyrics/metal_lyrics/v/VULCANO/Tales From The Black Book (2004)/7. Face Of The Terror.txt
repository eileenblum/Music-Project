[Lyrics: Zhema &amp; Fabiano Barroso]
[Music: Zhema &amp; Vulcano]

DAMNED THE AVID WHO RUNS WITH IMPLACABLE HATRED
PRESSES HIS TEETH READY TO SLAUGHTER THE VICTIM
ANCIENT TOTEM RAISED IN IGNEOUS ROCK
BRASS MASK HIDING THE UNCHANGABLE TIME

ARIDITY OF THE HEART PROJECT WITHIN DISTANT EYES
CRUSHES THE ENEMIES BENEATH HIS FEET
TEMPLE COLUMNS COVERED WITH SAND
HIDDEN PORTALS OPENED BY SCREAMS

JEWLLED KNIFE STAINED WITH BLOOD
REPRESENTS THE UNQUENCHABLE UNFORTUNATE LOOK
SLAVES CHANTS MELANCHOLIC TUNES
OF THESE HUMAN RAGS BLINDED BY DARKNESS

AT THE ORACLE OF A GOD THAT HANDLES WITH LIVES
HE TREADS BY HIS OWN FOR THE FOLLOWERS FEAR HIM
MAKING HIM STRONGER BY SACRIFICE RITUALS
INNER AND SOLITARY HE SMILES AT FUTILE DEATHS

DAMNED THE AVID WHO RUNS WITH IMPLACABLE HATRED
PRESSES HIS TEETH READY TO SLAUGHTER THE VICTIM
ANCIENT TOTEM RAISED IN IGNEOUS ROCK
BRASS MASK HIDING THE UNCHANGABLE TIME

JEWLLED KNIFE STAINED WITH BLOOD
REPRESENTS THE UNQUENCHABLE UNFORTUNATE LOOK
SLAVES CHANTS MELANCHOLIC TUNES
OF THESE HUMAN RAGS BLINDED BY DARKNESS
