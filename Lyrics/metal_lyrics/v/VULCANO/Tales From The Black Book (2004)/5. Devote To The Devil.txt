[Lyrics: Zhema &amp; Fabiano Barroso]
[Music: Zhema &amp; Vulcano]

AMID SCREAMS OF HORROR
AND THE SAD GROAN OF THE DYING ONES
THE SMOKE RISES ON THE DESERTED FIELD
AMID THE CHAOS OF DESTRUCTION

DEVOTE TO THE DEVIL
DEVOTE TO THE DEVIL
DEVOTE TO THE DEVIL

OVER THE BROKEN BONES
MEAT AND WORMS ARE MIXED
MEN WERE KILLED BY THE MORBID APPEARANCE
WERE HARVESTED BY THE POISONED AXE

THE CREATURE FLIES AT NIGHT ON TWISTED WINGS
ITS EYES OF FIRE WITHOUT MERCY
THAT WHIP THE SOUL WITH TORTURES AND ANGUISH
ITÂ´S THE PRINCESS OF HELL REVENGE
BLACK AND SOLITARY EXECUTIONER
THE VISION CAN FREEZING MEN'S BLOOD
AND IT'S STILL FLYING
TOTAL DESTRUCTION COMES CLOSE
