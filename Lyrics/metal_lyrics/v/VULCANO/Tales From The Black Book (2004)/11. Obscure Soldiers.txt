DRUMS SOUNDING IN THE DISTANCE
IN THE NIGHT OF THE FATALITY
THE PRINCEâS SOLDIERS ARE MARCHING THROUGH THE LAND,
LIKE OBSCURE MACHINES

THEY CROSS FOR MORBID LANES
COVERED BY UNKNOWN FOG
THERE IS NO RETURN ANYMORE...

HIDDEN BY THE THICK FOG
FETID WARRIORS LEAVE THE
HOLES AND DARK CAVES
FOR THE ENCOUNTER WITH HELL CREATURES!

MOVE FORWARD TO THE FIGHT
JUMP OVER THE ENEMY TO SLAUGHTER THEM
VIOLENT DOMAIN !!!
ATTACKING AMONG THE FIRE

DANGER OMEN !!!
GOING TORWARDS THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE LETHAL RIOT
DANGER OMEN !!!
FACE TO FACE WITH THE LETHAL DEATH

BLADES OF FIGHT; BLOOD AND STEEL
WARRIORSâ SCREAM ; ANGRY TO KILL
SHOCK OF HARD IRON
IMPACT OF HARD IRON
A STROKE! BLOOD AND STEEL
DAMAGE!
DEVASTATION BY THE METALS
